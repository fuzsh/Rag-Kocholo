        "text": "i can't watch those videos right now, but from what i remember the top five guys at the top were supposed to be can't-miss franchise players.\n\nthe comparisons i remember:\n\ndaigle - center version of guy lafleur\n\npronger - robinson\n\ngratton - baby lindros\n\nniedermayer - yzerman\n\nkozlov - lemieux\n\nand kariya was outside of that top five, even though he blew them all away at the WJC.\n\ni also remember kenny jonsson and thibault being majorly hyped. sundstrom had been on the record breaking forsberg/naslund WJC line so he was a known quantity, though with well-reasoned fears that his linemates were making him look better than he really was. and todd harvey... they talked about that guy the way people talk about jonathan toews now.\n\ni don't, however, remember even hearing the name jason arnott until the moment he was drafted.\n\nbefore the draft, mind you i was about to turn 12, but if you'd asked me right before the draft to predict the order of the top ten, i would have said: daigle, pronger, kozlov, gratton, niedermayer, jonsson, kariya, thibault, harvey, and probably sundstrom at the last spot.\n\nand does anybody remember ashley buckberger? i feel like there was a time when he was considered a top ten guy too, and as i recall they compared him to wendel clark. then again, he played for swift current which maybe explains how he fell to the bottom of the second round by the draft.\n\nThere's a fun little montage at the beginning, and lots of hyperbolic comparisons:\n\nDaigle - Lafontaine/Sakic/the fire of Maurice Richard!\n\nPronger - Robinson\n\nGratton - Muller\n\nKariya - Gretzky\n\nNiedermayer - Messier\n\nKozlov - Lemieux\n\nI guess this was before a lot of those big names were cemented as absolute all-time greats, or maybe if it's reporting in that era was more naive, but man oh man, those comparisons wouldn't be made today.\n\nAlso, it was interesting to see Bob Clarke opt to pick fifth in 1993 so they could pick first in 1994. The Ducks then stepped up and drafted Paul Kariya.\n\nI watched these a couple months ago and meant to post about it here. I didn't really start watching the draft until 1995, so this was a nice refresher from before my time. I told my buddy to watch it and see if he would agree with me on which prospect had the best mullet.\n\nWhat I found interesting was that they did the coin flip between Anaheim/Florida right before the draft started. I would have thought that'd be something they would have figured out far in advance of the draft.\n\nI think the announcers alluded to the Panthers preferring Rob Niedermayer while knowing that the Ducks liked Paul Kariya, so they figured it was better to take the #1 pick in 1994 while still getting Niedermayer. The other 'hilarious in hindsight' moment was that the reporter asks Bobby Clarke whether they were eyeing Jason Bonsignore with the top pick in 1994.\n\nAnother funny story about Clarke was that he extorted a pick out of Hartford. The league announced that the Whalers had traded up to the #2 pick but I don't think the full details were disclosed at the time.\n\nSan Jose wanted Viktor Kozlov and Hartford included a conditional 1994 1st round pick if Kozlov wasn't available at #6. Florida got wind of this information and threatened to take Kozlov at #5 unless Hartford gave them a 1994 2nd rounder for nothing. Burke apparently didn't want to see if Clarke was bluffing and gave them the pick.\n\nYears later, Burke still was pissed about it. He claimed that somebody must have leaked that info. I'll have to rewatch that portion of the video, but I could have sworn that Burke alluded to a conditional pick to San Jose during an interview.\n\nI watched these a couple months ago and meant to post about it here.

I'll have to rewatch that portion of the video, but I could have sworn that Burke alluded to a conditional pick to San Jose during an interview.\n\nI missed the Hartford pick extortion, but Burke did blab on about the extra pick should Kozlov not be there. Man Kozlov sucked given the Lemieux like hype attached to him.\n\na couple articles from way back:\n\nQuebec currently has the 10th and 14th picks and is hoping to package them in a trade up in the draft to get a shot at Daigle. The Nordiques are building a good team in their French-dominated city. They hope to erect a big, new arena, and Daigle would help them gain momentum toward that end. With his Luke Perry hairstyle, his sideburns and his attitude -- just short of cocky -- Daigle cuts an impressive figure.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/26/sports/hockey-he-shoots-he-scores-in-2-languages.html\n\nGetting in now would guarantee Anaheim one of the top five amateur players in the world--and this year's draft pool is said to be the deepest since the Lemieux draft of '84, which also yielded Kirk Muller, Ed Olczyk, Al Iafrate, Petr Svoboda, Gary Roberts and Kevin Hatcher in the first round.\n\nAlexandre Daigle is receiving \"The Next Lemieux\" treatment, Viktor Kozlov is a 6-5, 220-pound version of Pavel Bure and Rob Niedermayer, Chris Pronger and Chris Gratton all bear \"franchise player\" notations on their individual scouting reports.\n\n\"For an expansion team coming in,\" Quinn said, \"the player pool this year will be better than just about anything we've seen historically.\"\n\nhttp://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-08/sports/sp-1263_1_news-leaks\n\nand a couple years ago, THN did a retrospective take on the '93 draft. the kozlov and arnott scouting reports were right on the money. and the sundstrom one was hilarious--\n\nWhen Jason Arnott officially announced his retirement after a solid 18-year career, it further dwindled one of the most underrated draft classes in NHL history.\n\nThere are just four NHL players from the 1993 draft – Saku Koivu, Todd Bertuzzi, Hal Gill and Kimmo Timonen – still active in the NHL. Chris Pronger, the second overall choice and the best player in that draft, is still considered an active player, but Philadelphia Flyers GM Paul Holmgren told thn.com recently that Pronger will never play again. Miroslav Satan, another player from the ’93 draft, is playing for Bratislava Slovan of the KHL and will perform for Slovakia in the Sochi Olympics.\n\nThere has been better top-end talent in other drafts to be sure, but few drafts compare to ’93 when it comes to sheer volume of NHL players produced. Pronger is the only Hall of Famer in the bunch and it did spawn one of the bigger No. 1 overall busts in history in Alexandre Daigle, but where the draft class is most impressive is in its overall production of NHL talent.\n\nFor example, 19 of the 26 players taken in the first round that year played at least 400 career games. That’s 73.1 percent, which puts it only behind the 1978, ‘79,’83 and ’91 drafts in that department. Just as impressively, each of the first 14 players taken in the draft hit the 400-game plateau. The only draft with a better record than that was the 1979 draft, which saw each of the top 17 picks play at least 400 games. But you have to remember that 1979 was when the 18-year-old draft came into being, which basically made the crop a double cohort of the best 18- and 19-year-old players available.\n\nIt will be interesting to see which of the players will be the last one standing. All four who are left are pending unrestricted free agents. Timonen has already said this will be his last season and Gill has played only two games for the Flyers this season. That leaves Koivu and Bertuzzi, who will likely both play beyond this season.\n\n1993 DRAFT TOP 10\n\nPictures from THN’s ’93 Draft Preview\n\n1. Alexandre Daigle (THN ranking in '93: 1)\n\nGames: 616. Goals: 129. Assists: 198. Points: 327.\n\nPlayed for: Ottawa, Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, NY Rangers, Pittsburgh, Minnesota.\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “He’s the best player. I can see signs of greatness in him.”\n\n2. Chris Pronger (2)\n\nGames: 1167. Goals: 157. Assists: 541. Points: 698.\n\nPlayed for: Hartford, St. Louis, Edmonton, Anaheim, Philadelphia.\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “I don’t see how any team, other than Ottawa, could possibly pass on Pronger. To get a defenseman that big, that skilled, and that smart, well, they just don’t come along very often.”\n\n3. Chris Gratton (3)\n\nGames: 1092. Goals: 214. Assists: 354. Points: 568.\n\nPlayed for: Tampa Bay, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Phoenix, Colorado, Florida, Columbus.\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “There is an awful lot of Kirk Muller in Chris Gratton. He plays the game the way it is meant to be played.”\n\n4. Paul Kariya (5)\n\nGames: 989. Goals: 402. Assists: 587. Points: 989.\n\nPlayed for: Anaheim, Colorado, Nashville, St. Louis.\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “The small a player is, the more difficult it is to carry a team on his shoulders. So you just have to ask yourself before you draft him, ‘Do you expect him to carry your team?’”\n\n5. Rob Niedermayer (4)\n\nGames: 1153. Goals: 186. Assists: 283. Points: 469.\n\nPlayed for: Florida, Calgary, Anaheim, New Jersey, Buffalo.\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “He’ll get his share (of goals) and do far more than just score.”\n\n6. Viktor Kozlov (6)\n\nGames: 897. Goals: 198. Assists: 339. Points: 537.\n\nPlayed for: San Jose, Florida, New Jersey, Washington\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “He’s not posting good numbers at any level. His intensity is out more than it is in. But there have been shifts when he has done it all. He could still turn out to be a premier player.”\n\n7. Jason Arnott (8)\n\nGames: 1244. Goals: 417. Assists: 521. Points: 938.\n\nPlayed for: Edmonton, New Jersey, Dallas, Nashville, Washington, St. Louis.\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “He still has to learn the physical game. There is a very big upside here because of his offensive skills, but some risk, too. He’s going to have to increase his determination level by a lot.”\n\n8. Niklas Sundstrom (9)\n\nGames: 750. Goals: 117. Assists: 232. Points: 349.\n\nPlayed for: NY Rangers, San Jose, Montreal.\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “You could call him a poor man’s Peter Forsberg. He might turn out to be just as good as Forsberg.”\n\n9. Todd Harvey (7)\n\nGames: 671. Goals: 91. Assists: 132. Points: 223.\n\nPlayed for: Dallas, NY Rangers, San Jose, Edmonton.\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “He’s in the Bobby Clarke mold. He’s tough as nails, wins faceoffs, scores goals, he does it all.”\n\n10. Jocelyn Thibault (14)\n\nGames: 586. SP: .904. GAA: 2.75. Wins: 238.\n\nPlayed for: Quebec/Colorado, Montreal, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Buffalo.\n\nScout from 1993 Draft Preview: “I’ve seen his psychological profile and this kid loves pressure and the challenge of proving himself.”\n\n1993 REVISIONIST HISTORY TOP 10\n\n1.
