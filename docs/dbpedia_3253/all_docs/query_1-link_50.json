Missed remainder of 2000-01 season with concussion and broken nose, suffered when he was checked into the boards by Shane Doan in Tampa Bay's Dec. 14, 2000, game at Phoenix and went face-first into his own stick as he fell. The injury led to post-concussion syndrome, which ended his career. When it became apparent he could not come back, he finally opted to retire from the NHL following the 2001-02 season at the age of 36.\n\nDraft Day Surprise: Had he not spent his junior career behind the Iron Curtain in Czechoslovakia, Svoboda would have been a top candidate for the 1984 draft. But because he was unlikely to be allowed to enter the NHL, Svoboda was expected to be a late-round pick. But Montreal Canadiens general manager Serge Savard turned the draft on its head, surprising even the hometown Canadiens fans by taking Svoboda with his team's first-round pick. Savard made the bold move because he knew -- unlike other GMs -- that Svoboda had already defected from Czechoslovakia and escaped to West Germany. Svoboda had done this while competing with the Czechoslovakian National Junior Team at the 1984 European Championships in West Germany. He slipped away from the team and took a bus to his aunt's house in Munich. The Canadiens had arranged for him to be in Montreal for draft day, and when he was called, Svoboda was right there to pull on a Montreal sweater. The entire league, which had been led to believe that Savard would draft Shayne Corson, was shocked. At the time, Svoboda spoke no English or French, and had to take language classes to be set for training camp. He also revealed that the Canadiens had told him three days before the draft that they would take him at No. 5 overall, and denied that he had been lured out of Czechoslovakia by any specific NHL team. One day before the 1984 draft, the Canadiens flew Svoboda to Montreal and hid him in a hotel so other general managers wouldn't know of his availability. Montreal reportedly had already agreed with Svoboda on a five-year, $750,000 deal. Ironically, the Canadiens still managed to draft Corson, making a trade with St. Louis so they could pick again with the Blues' first-round pick in the No. 8 overall slot."
