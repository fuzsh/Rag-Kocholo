With LB backing up on the big club ...and Ellis/Starett likely in Bakersfield. Wells possibly back in the OHL as an over ager...I wonder if the Oilers try and convince him to come over and push for an AHL job against Starett...either way 1 of the 2 would end up the starter in Wichita (ECHL)\n\nLooks like he just signed a contract with HC Plzen a month ago that'll get him to be a starter in the Czech pro league finally(he's been in the second tier Czech league the last couple years). I doubt he'll come over to play ECHL but it might be worth it to sign him to an ELC and then loan him back to that squad for the year and see how he does.\n\nI think it's always worthwhile to have a goalie developing overseas.\n\nBy the looks of HC Plzen's roster, he has a good chance to start in the top Czech league next season.\n\nIt can't hurt to let him play a year or two over there and then figure out if he's worth bringing over, IMO."
