The Calder criteria means that some prospects who would otherwise be considered will be discounted due to age (Andrew Miller doesn’t qualify, even if the ambiguity inherent in the NHL’s age definition might make you think he does) or because of games played (Leon Draisaitl, who passed the threshold last year, is also exempt).\n\nWith that criteria set David Staples, Bruce McCurdy and myself each voted on the pool of 33 players who qualified for inclusion. The top 25 players on our list will each get their own write-ups, but in this introductory post we’ll take a quick look at the players below that threshold, who are as follow:\n\nNo. 26 C/RW Tyler Vesel (2014 rank: No. 24 overall). Vesel just barely slipped outside the top 25 this year and is an interesting prospect. He was drafted as an over-ager after a pretty impressive season in the USHL, and as we noted in last year’s write-up players with similar backgrounds have gone on to play NHL hockey (with Joe Pavelski and Matt Read particularly deserving of attention. Vesel recorded 23 points in 39 games at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, which is slightly less than the line in the sand (0.75 points/game) we suggested in last year’s piece but was also managed with minimal power play work. Expectations for 2015-16: Offensive growth. Vesel’s bread and butter is scoring and he needs to deliver more as he continues his college career.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNo. 27 LW Evan Campbell (2014 rank: Longshot, outside top-30). Campbell came on late in 2013-14, posting 11 points in his final 22 games after going 0-for-11 to start his college career. Still, that wasn’t nearly enough, and we described the winger as a suspect rather than a prospect. So it’s nice to be able to say that 2014-15 was a big improvement, as the 22-year-old put up 27 points in 34 games (including two shorthanded markers). He has decent size and if he keeps scoring and killing penalties at the college level he might end up being a pretty interesting prospect for Edmonton. Expectations for 2015-16: Offensive growth. He was just shy of the point-per-game mark last year and if he hits it this season he’ll likely climb our rankings again.\n\nNo. 28 LD Martin Gernat (2014 rank: No. 7 overall). What a collapse. Gernat slipped a little in last year’s rankings and this season imploded utterly. He was bad in training camp (and probably hurt Martin Marincin, too, who he was often paired with) and he tumbled down Oklahoma City’s depth chart in his second year with the team. He went from 21 points to nine, played in fewer games, and went from ‘prospect with warts’ to ‘career in need of resuscitation’. If his ELC had expired this year, I fully expect Edmonton would have cut him loose. Expectations for 2015-16: Be an everyday defenceman at the AHL level.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNo. 29 LW Aidan Muir (2014 rank: Longshot, outside top-30). Muir turns 20 in August, so it’s worth remembering that he has a few years before he’ll be at the same stage in his career as guys like Campbell and Vesel, who have comparable college experience. We suggested 0.5 points/game last year as a reasonable goal in college, and Muir fell below it, albeit barely (15 points in 36 games). He’s 6’4” and 212 pounds and has speed, so if he can find the range offensively he’ll be interesting. Expectations for 2015-16: As with Vesel and Campbell, offensive growth.\n\nNo. 30 G Zach Nagelvoort (2014 rank: No. 22 overall). Nagelvoort was a fourth-round pick in 2014 after an outstanding season with the University of Michigan. In 2014-15, he fell from a 0.929 save percentage down to 0.906, allowing undrafted backup Steven Racine to claim more starts than he had the year before. It was a heavy blow to his ranking here. Expectations for 2015-16: A rebound performance. Nagelvoort clearly outplayed Racine in 2013-14 and needs to do so once again, making it clear he’s a No. 1 at the college level.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNo. 31 G Miroslav Svoboda (2014 rank: N/A, drafted No. 208 in 2015). Svoboda is big, he’s a goalie, and that’s pretty much all we know. The Oilers traded their extra seventh-rounder for 2016 to draft this guy, so they obviously like him. He’s been loaned to a second division team in the Czech Republic again for this coming season. Expectations for 2015-16: Svoboda is a total wildcard, but if he can establish himself as a workhorse in the second Czech league it will be a step forward.\n\nNo. 32 G Keven Bouchard (2014 rank: Longshot, outside top-30). Bouchard didn’t exactly inspire confidence with his work in 2013-14, which earned him a seventh-round selection by the Oilers, and 2014-15 represented a step backward. He was outplayed by and ceded the starting job to Ettiene Montpetit, who is a year younger and wasn’t selected in the 2015 Draft. If 2015 had been his first year of eligibility, it’s reasonable to believe Bouchard would have been passed over, too. Expectations for 2015-16: Bouchard was traded and will need to play well enough to get another shot at the No. 1 job if he is to earn a contract from the Oilers.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNo. 33 RW John McCarron (2014 rank: No. 26 overall). McCarron had a wretched year. He fell to just four goals (two of them on the power play) and 12 points, with the latter representing a 50 percent reduction from the previous season. He’s big and strong but doesn’t bring nearly enough offence for an NHL contract. Expectations for 2015-16: McCarron’s rights are owned until August 15, so while he’s technically on the list now we do not expect that he’ll be signed by the Oilers. If he lands a minor-league contract with Bakersfield, showing he can be an everyday AHL’er (even on the fourth line) would be a big step forward.\n\nThese eight players represent this year’s longshot group. Which has the best shot at an NHL career? Staples and McCurdy both favour Vesel as the best of this set, while I voted for Campbell. Gernat has tremendous talent and could rebound, Muir’s size/speed combination is hard to find, and goalies are voodoo, so it’s hardly clear-cut.\n\nPrevious prospect rankings\n\n2014 rankings: Leon Draisaitl leads big, heavy prospect group\n\n2013 rankings: Oscar Klefbom, Darnell Nurse vie for top ranking on defence-heavy depth chart\n\n2012 rankings: Nail Yakupov’s offensive potential makes him best of Oil prospects\n\n2011 rankings: First overall pick Ryan Nugent-Hopkins is Edmonton’s top prospect\n\nFollow Jonathan Willis on Twitter!\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
