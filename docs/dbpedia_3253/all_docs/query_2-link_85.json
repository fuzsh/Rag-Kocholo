        "text": "I think we are all generally disappointed with the Oilers right now. Alot of blame going around, but how much of it should lie with Peter Chiarelli? Everyone with a platform has their views, myself included. *Cough follow me at @EdmontonRaider on twitter dot com.* Anyways I’ve seen alot of talk about how Chiarelli could have done just about nothing and the team would be in a better situation going forward. This reminded me of a couple articles I really enjoyed.\n\nCanucks Army did a wonderful article a few years ago talking about Jim Benning vs a Vacuum Cleaner. This itself was an homage to PPP’s Nonis vs a Potato.\n\nThis has lead me to the idea to look at how Peter Chiarelli matches up vs an inanimate object. With so many inanimate objects in and around Edmonton how can we choose just one. Despite some other ideas I’ve decided to settle on the infamous Bobby Nicks Burger.\n\nSome ground rules to star. We as the Bobby Nicks Burger cannot sign or extend UFA’s. RFA’s are resigned at 150% of previous salary at 3 years. In cases where the player would clearly not sign that we’ll give them 200%. The Bobby Nicks Burger likes bridge deals and isn’t a great negotiator. If a player is clearly above that level of play maybe we will have a hold out! Find out more later! Borderline NHLers will get 2 years at 150% and 1 year at 150% for minor leaguers. Draft wise we’re going to take who was best available according to Bobby Margarita’s list, and we’ll allow picks beyond that list to stick as listening to the scouts. If the team doesn’t have enough of a near NHL level position on the roster specificly at goaltender, we’re going to sign the best unsigned veteran according to TSN’s free agency rankings who is still unsigned on July 5th at an inflated cost than their actual signing.\n\nLet’s start.\n\nSpring of 2015, instead of hiring Peter Chiarelli The Bobby Nicks Burger enters the fray.\n\nThe Bobby Nicks Burger does not hire Todd McLellan, the Bobby Nicks Burger keeps Todd Nelson. 86 overall does not go to San Jose as Compensation.\n\nDraft Time!\n\nThe Bobby Nicks Burger enters the draft with some good picks. 1st overall, 16th overall, 33rd overall, 57 overall, 79 overall, 86 overall, 117 overall, 124 overall, 154 overall, 208 overall.\n\n1st Overall Pick: Connor McDavid! Easy enough, #1 on Bobby Macks list. Done and done.\n\n16th Overall Pick: Well by god, we don’t have a trade. The Reinhart experience is wiped from history. Bobby Nicks Burger drafts Matthew Barzal. I don’t think I need to comment on the quality of this prospect.\n\n33rd Overall Pick: Bobby Nicks Burger pounces on Paul Bittner, 20th on the final rankings, great value at 33. How it turns out? To this point Bittner struggled with some injuries only playing 25 games in 15-16, and then 31 in the AHL in 16-17 where he had no goals and only three assists. As of Nov 19th he has 7 points in 10 games. Starting to turn it around a bit? Only the Bobby Nicks Burger can foresee the future.\n\n57th overall Pick: Oh No! First clear win for Pete here. This wipes out the Cam Talbot trade. This will hurt. Bobby Nicks burger selects Oliver Kylington. Swedish defender, who Flames fans know from his dominance in the AHL is looking good. Ranked 24th overall on Makenzie’s Final Rankings. Bobby Nicks Burger is feeling good about it’s picks so far.\n\n79th overall Pick: Ryan Pilon! He was drafted 147th overall in reality, but the list has him ranked 55. The Burger is acting smug at this point. Little does the Bobby Nicks Burger realize that the reason Ryan Pilon dropped was his lack of desire to continue playing hockey. He has since retired and I find it highly unlikely that a Burger no matter how delicious and decadent could convince young Ryan to continue playing.\n\n86th overall Pick: Austin Wagner from Regina a left winger. Went 99 in the real world, ranked 64 on the list. He had 66 points in 64 games before tearing apart his shoulder and arm. He will not play this year. Jury is out on this one.\n\n117th overall Pick: Nikita Korostelev, the Russian winger from Sarnia who went 185 in reality to the leafs becomes the Oilers next pick. We do not select one of our favorite prospects in Caleb Jones. Scoring above a PPG each year in the OHL since being drafted. Jury is out.\n\n124th overall Pick: Oh No! The final rankings list is empty. Let’s ask the scouts, I guess we pay them for something. Ethan Bear it is. We all know Ethan Bear. We all like Ethan Bear.\n\n154th overall Pick: John Marino. Same as before scouts pick.\n\nWe no longer have the 208th pick so Miroslav Svoboda was not selected as Bobby Nicks burger does not make draft day trades. Oilers retain 2016 7th rounder.\n\nWe no longer have the 209th pick so no giant Russian Prince in Paigin. Too bad.\n\nThe Oilers have not traded away Marincin for Brad Ross and the pick that became Gryba. They retained Travis Ewanyk. The Oilers have not traded Boyd Gordon for Lauri Korpikoski. They have not traded for Anders Nilsson so we retain Liam Coughlin.\n\nEven tho there were only about 4 teams with the cap space to sign Sekera this offseason at his ask and it was clear that the Oilers needed a LD one would assume even the worst GM would have considered him, but alas, The Bobby Nicks Burger doesn’t even have that much talent. Sekera and Letestu are not signed. Ouch again. Braden Christoffer never got an invite to rookie camp, therefor was not signed. Klinkhammer was not resigned after coming over from the Perron trade. Oscar Klefbom does not get his dream 7 year extension. All the talks about extensions with Klefbom that were happening before Chiarelli arrived and the tidbits of information that were reported to have insinuated Talbot talks with Sather happened again, prior to Chiarelli’s hiring are all flushed down the drain. For the Bobby Nicks Burger does not read emails. Entry Level deals we will keep.\n\nWe enter the season as this as the depth.\n\nPouliot – McDavid – Yakupov\n\nHall – Nuge – Eberle\n\nLander – Draisaitl – Purcell\n\nHendricks – Gordon – Pitlick\n\nPakarinen, Gazdic\n\nKlefbom – Schultz\n\nMarincin – Fayne\n\nNurse – Nikitin\n\nFerence – Davidson\n\nScrivens\n\nBroissiot\n\nYou may not like that first line, but your mileage may vary.\n\nDavidson, Pitlick, and Schultz Pakarinen, and Marincin are resigned at 1.5X their previous salaries.\n\nMarincin 1.09M x 2, Pitlick 1.3M x2, Davidson 925K x2, Schultz 5.56M x 3. Pakarinen gets 2 years at 1.35M (Damn this Bobby Nicks Burger sucks at RFA deals)\n\nEnter the Season!\n\nIn Season Transactions.\n\nGlendenning, Cracknell, Pardy are never claimed from waivers. We do not trade Scrivens for Kassian, We do not trade the 4th and Gernat for Maroon. We never had Nilsson, so we didn’t trade him. Larsen isn’t traded for the 2017 5th rounder, Purcell and Schultz are not traded for the 2016 3rd round picks each.\n\nI think it’s fair to assume this team would not do well given the quality of the defense and goal tending. Let’s just to make this fair, assume the Oilers ended up in the same lotto spot as before as we don’t want the Bobby Nicks Burger to have advantages Mr Chiarelli did not have.\n\nDraft time!\n\nOilers enter the draft with these picks. 4th overall, 32nd overall, 63rd overall. Picks 84 and 91 are no longer Edmontons because the Burger did not trade Schultz or Purcell for 3rd rounders. No Matt Cairnes, No Filip Berglund. The Oilers retain pick 93 as it did not go for Patrick Maroon, as well they have lost 149, which was from the Nilsson trade, so no Graham McPhee. They still have 153rd, 183rd, and 206th overall.\n\n4th overall: Jesse Puljujarvi. Ranked 3rd, available at 4. Pick remains the same.\n\n32nd Overall: Libor Hajek! Czech defender 6’1 and a half. Put up the same amount of points 26 in his draft +1 year in 4 less games, signed an ELC with Tampa and is now in the AHL 1 goal in 9 games. Chiarelli took Benson, but Libor Hajek was ranked 26th on the Makenzie final rankings.\n\n63rd Overall: Well lookey lookey! Markus Niemelainen, same pick we made he was ranked 38th on the list so good value.\n\n93rd Overall: Jack Kopacka! This was the highest available player on Makenzies list and just who the Ducks took here. Big left wing who scored udner a ppg in his draft + 1 year, but did tally 30 goals. Currently 12 goals 6 assists in 20 games in OHL and has signed a deal with the Ducks.\n\n153rd Overall: The Makeznie list has been exhausted so we’ll end up with Aapeli Rasanen. Arguably Graham McPhee might have been available here because he was taken in the real world just a few picks before by the Oilers, but we can’t be sure.\n\n183rd Overall: Vincent Desharnais again. Same deal as before with Rasanen we can’t be sure he’d be available, and we’ll use that logic for not taking Desharnais at 206 if that chain reaction made Rasanen here.\n\n206th Overall: The Oilers had no picks left or earlier picks who were not selected so for arguement lets just use Otto Sompii the player Tampa took with the pick.\n\nFree agency.\n\nExpiring Contracts:\n\nScrivens, Fayne, Gazdic, Purcell, Hunt, Miller, Nikitin, and Gordon Walk.\n\nRFA’s:\n\nKlefbom – Bridge 3 years at 200% and we’ll use bonus totals for some semblance of of realism, 2.48M Since he’s earning 3M in the first years of his real life extension I think we can feel okay with a 3 year bridge at this amount. YMMV on this.\n\nBrossoit – He’s earning more in this time line most definitely. Two year bridge at $1.850M. As the back up well put him in the two year extension range as a likely shakey year infront of that defense last year is unlikely to have him shining. No cheating to make the Potato look better tho so we’re giving 2 years at 150% salary.\n\nMusil – 1 year extension 900K\n\nOesterle – 2 year extension 1.15M a year\n\nEntry Level deals will be signed.\n\nUFA’s:\n\nMilan Lucic is not signed.\n\nMatthew Benning is not signed\n\nDrake Caggulia is not signed.\n\nTaylor Beck is not signed.\n\nJonas Gustavsson is not signed.\n\nPatrick Russell is not signed.\n\nNick Ellis is not signed.\n\nJere Sallinen is not signed.\n\nKris Russell is not signed.\n\nDepth Chart\n\nPouliot – McDavid – Yakupov\n\nHall – Nuge – Eberle\n\nHendricks – Draisaitl – Pitlick\n\n? – Lander – Pakarinen\n\nPuljujarvi, Slepyshev, Khaira, Moroz, fight for that last top 12 spot and the extra forward as this team carries 8 defenders.\n\nKlefbom – Schultz\n\nNurse – Davidson\n\nMarincin – Fayne\n\nSimpson – Oesterle\n\nG\n\nBroissiot\n\nIR: Ference\n\nWe have some severe shortages on goaltenders in the organization. Time to check the scrap heaps.\n\nThese were the goalies with NHL history who signed after July 5th.\n\nRichard Bachman 2 years 1.15M total, on July 13th.\n\nJhonas Enroth August 22nd, 1 year 750k total.\n\nThe Bobby Nicks Burger has no idea how to solve the goaltending issue as it’s an inanimate object! So what he does is signs the only two goalies with NHL experience that were unsigned after July 5th that ended up signing in the NHL. As a poor negotiator he decides that they are both worth an extra 50% on what was paid.\n\nEnroth 1M, and Bachman two years at 862.5K\n\nNew Goaltender depth.\n\nBroissiot\n\nBachman\n\nEnroth\n\nThis is less than ideal.\n\nIt’s safe to say this season would not end up with us having that playoff run, but there is a lot of offensive firepower. Maybe Todd Nelson can keep Yakupov and Lander on the right path.\n\nThe Oilers would entered into the Expansion draft with the following. Bold protected, bold and italic exempt. This is 4 forwards 3 defenders, so they can still go 8 skaters or the 7-3-1 route. It’s all up to the Burger! (You’d think Katz would intervene at some point)\n\nPouliot (4M 2 yrs) – McDavid (3.775M 1 yr ELC) – Yakupov (RFA)\n\nHall (6M 3 years) – Nuge (6M 3) – Eberle (6M 2 yrs)\n\nSlepyshev (0.925M 1yr) –Draisaitl (RFA) – Pitlick (UFA)\n\nHendricks (UFA) – Anton Lander (RFA) – Puljujarvi (3.425M 2 yrs ELC)\n\nKhaira (RFA) – Pakarinan (RFA)\n\nNotable exempt: Barzal, Bittner,\n\nKlefbom (2.44M 2 yrs) – Schultz (5.56M 1 yr)\n\nNurse (0.925M 1 yr ELC) – Davidson (RFA)\n\nMarincin (RFA) – Fayne (3.625M 1 yr)\n\nOesterle (1.15M 1 yr)\n\nNotable exempt: Kylington, Bear, Hajek\n\nBroissiot (1.85M 1 yr)\n\nBachman (0.865M 1 yr)\n\nTotal Cap commitments Pre-Expansion counting McDavid at full hit and Nurse/Slepy/JP as salary before bonuses.\n\n43.115M 14/23 roster spots filled. $31.885M in available space or 3.542 M per roster spot.\n\nTo keep this thing going we’re going to have decide that the AHL affiliate is filling a roster and signing some contracts but we’ll assume they have failed in all aspects and have brought in nothing of any substance at an NHL level.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nThis was proven wrong, as for some reason the KHL is not considered a “professional league” in the CBA. This is some cold war buffoonery to not even call a previous rival a pro league because you can. This is the same quirk that allows Panarin at age 24 with 6 seasons in the KHL to maintain rookie status and steal the Calder from our Lord and Savior. I’ll keep the article up because everyone needs to remember they are often wrong.\n\nEarlier this Afternoon Jason Gregor spoke too how he was informed that Anders Nilsson does not need to pass through waivers. While this appeared to be good news for the Oilers, more specifically good news for Ben Scrivens this does not appear to be the case if I’m reading the CBA correctly. Sorry Ben. I believe Jason’s source is mistaken\n\nNow as per Section 13 of the NHL CBA goaltenders signed at age 20 have 4 years of waiver exemption as opposed to the 3 that skaters receive.\n\nNilsson signed his entry level deal in Friday May 25th 20011. This was two years after his draft year making him “aged 20” when he signed his ELC. This means for purposes of the CBA he gets 4 years of waiver ineligibility.\n\nIf a player is 20 years or older a professional game is considered any NHL regular season or playoff game. AHL regular Season or Playoff Games and any professional games played in Europe on loan.\n\nThe first season in which a player plays his first professional game (NHL or AHL) constitutes the first year for calculating the number of years of waiver exemption that he has.\n\nHe started with 4 years.\n\n2011/12 NHL games 4 AHL 25\n\n3 years left.\n\n2012/13 NHL games 0 AHL games 25\n\n2 Years left.\n\n2013/2014 NHL 19 AHL 29\n\n1 Year left.\n\n2014-2015 Zero games (played a year in the KHL).\n\n1 year left right? Maybe not.\n\nThe CBA clearly refers to years from when you sign the contract. This is one of the differences in interpretation from Jason Gregors source and my own. I can’t find a single section that talks about what makes a year eligible to count towards the 4 years. All I can find that might be relevant is this.\n\n“For purposes of Regular Waivers, the six (6) year exemption for an 18 year old goalie and the five (5) year exemption for a 19 year old goalie shall both be reduced to four (4) years commencing the first season that the 18 or 19 year old goalie plays in eleven (11) NHL Games or more. The next three (3) seasons, regardless of whether the goalie plays any NHL Games in any of those three (3) seasons, shall count as the next three (3) years toward satisfying the exemption.\n\nThe clock seems to start and tick down regardless of whether they play NHL games or not for 18/19 year olds once they start the timer. The system appears to be based on years from the start date and not counting years that meet a criteria. This seems to set a precedant of counting actual years not years where certain conditions are met.\n\nNow how does this relate to a goalies aged 20/21 when they sign.\n\n“The first season in which a Player who is age 20 or older plays in one (1) or more Professional Games shall constitute the first year for calculating the number of years he is exempt from Regular Waivers.”\n\nNow this above might not apply to him as it’s all just speculation. However while reading I came across another interesting section. It appears that the rules for waivers might work in a similar fashion to the slide rules for contracts. When you send a player back to juniors, their contract slides. If they play the threshold amount of games required to count as their first season they are locked in and count from that point on.\n\nThe waiver eligibility chart in section 13.2 says a skater who signs his ELC at age 19 would have 4 years of waiver ineligibility.\n\nhowever it also says this.\n\n(b) An 18 year old drafted in the 2013 Entry Draft who does not sign an SPC until July 2014 at the age of 19, and plays eleven (11) NHL Games in the 2014-15 season, will be exempt as follows: Season Regular Waivers 13-14 n/a 14-15 Exempt 15-16 Exempt 16-17 Exempt 17-18 Eligible\n\nSo he doesn’t actually get to keep the 4 years from signing like the chart says because he played 11 NHL games (the requirement to use up a year of eligibility as a 19 year old skater). This stops the ability to slide the waiver eligibility to the full 4 years. I think once you are counting years you only get the 3 years you always get.\n\nLet’s examine the rules for goalies who are 20/21 as the case with Nilsson. They get 4 years exemption.\n\nHowever, they do not need the 11 NHL games to start their year counter\n\n“The first season in which a Player who is age 20 or older plays in one (1) or more Professional Games shall constitute the first year for calculating the number of years he is exempt from Regular Waivers”\n\nWould Nilssons 4 year now shift into the more tradition 3 years like it did with the 19 year old skater case from above?\n\nI think so.\n\nIf his source is from the team and if I am right, then this is just another in a long list of waiver faux pas by this team. Let’s hope I am wrong as we just recently replaced our accident prone capologist. Please someone smarter than me correct me if I am wrong.\n\nYou can yell at me on twitter @EdmontonRaider"
