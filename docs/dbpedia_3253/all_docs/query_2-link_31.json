        "text": "The Hurricanes have recalled Scott Darling from his conditioning stint with Charlotte (AHL).\n\nDarling has missed the first nine games of the season with a lower-body injury, but appears ready to return to the Hurricanes crease following a one-game conditioning stint with Charlotte. Darling was sharp with the Checkers, stopping 25 of the 26 shots he faced to earn a 3-1 win against the Utica Comets on Wednesday. Darling could make his season debut Friday against the Sharks.\n\nThe Senators have recalled Christian Wolanin from Belleville (AHL).\n\nWolanin had three points (1G / 2A) in 10 games with the Senators last year after turning pro following his Junior year at the University of North Dakota. Wolanin started 2018-19 in the AHL but has been called-up because Mark Borowiecki was suspended for one-game.\n\nThe Hurricanes recalled Nicolas Roy from Charlotte (AHL).\n\nRoy was a fourth round pick of the Oilers in 2015 and has started the season with five goals and two assists (seven points) in his first six AHL games. The 21-year-old centre played one game with the Hurricanes last season.\n\nThe Canucks have recalled Darren Archibald from Utica (AHL).\n\nArchibald has had a surprisingly strong start to the season with the Comets, scoring four goals with two assists (six points) in eight games. Archibald was recalled because Brock Boeser suffered a lower-body injury on Monday.\n\nThe Blackhawks have recalled Luke Johnson from Rockford (AHL).\n\nJohnson has split the early part of the season between the NHL and AHL. The 24-year-old forward had no points in three games with the Blackhawks but picked up two points (1G / 1A) in two games with the IceHogs.\n\nForsberg has cleared waivers and been assigned to Rockford (AHL).\n\nWith Corey Crawford back for the Blackhawks, they have sent Forsberg back to the AHL, where he was 27-17-2 with a 2.28 GAA, .926 SV% and four shutouts in his last stint.\n\nThe Red Wings have sent Filip Hronek to Grand Rapids (AHL).\n\nHronek had three points (1G / 2A) in his first six games with the Red Wings. With Trevor Daley and Jonathan Ericsson back and Mike Green potentially returning on Friday, Hronek will head to the AHL where he had 39 points (11G / 28A) in 67 games last year.\n\nThe Devils have recalled John Quenneville from Binghamton (AHL).\n\nQuenneville has not recorded a point in four NHL games or one AHL game this season. He will take Drew Stafford’s spot on the roster but has only registered four points (1G / 3A) in 18 career NHL games.\n\nThe Devils have recalled Eric Gryba from Binghamton (AHL).\n\nGryba was a minus-2 in his first game with Binghamton and could make his Devils debut after being recalled to take Ben Lovejoy’s spot on the roster.\n\nThe Kings have recalled Sean Walker from Ontario (AHL).\n\nWalker, 23, was an undrafted free agent out of Bowling Green State University. Walker had 28 points (7G / 21A) in 64 games during his first pro season with Ontario in 2017-18 and has amassed six points (3G / 3A) in his first seven games this season. His call-up means the Kings are carrying eight defenseman on their active roster right now.\n\nThe Kings have sent Jaret Anderson-Dolan to Spokane (WHL).\n\nAnderson-Dolan, 19, had one assist in five games with the Kings and was given a look up and down the lineup, including PP1 usage at times. Overall, the Kings think it is best for the 2017 second-round pick to return to Juniors, where he had 91 points (40G / 51A) in 70 games last season.\n\nThe Devils have recalled Yegor Yakovlev from Binghamton (AHL).\n\nYakovlev, 27, signed with the Devils this summer after six seasons in the KHL. Yakovlev had nine points (5G / 4A) in 35 KHL games last season and has picked up seven assists in seven AHL games this year. He could make his NHL debut on Thursday if Ben Lovejoy is still sidelined.\n\nThe Devils have recalled Kevin Rooney from Binghamton (AHL).\n\nRooney made his season debut with the Devils on Saturday, but went back to the AHL post-game. Rooney is one of the best penalty killers in the Devils organization, but doesn’t bring a lot of offence to the table—just 34 points (14G / 20A) in 71 games with Binghamton last year.\n\nThe Stars have recalled Justin Dowling from Texas (AHL).\n\nDowling has recorded two goals and four assists (six points) in seven games with Texas this season. The 28-year-old centre has registered just two assists in nine career NHL games.\n\nThe Predators have reassigned Miroslav Svoboda to Milwaukee (AHL).\n\nSvoboda was called up from the ECHL to backup Juuse Saros on Saturday, but switches spots with Troy Grosenick and earns a promotion from the ECHL to the AHL. He was 2-0-0 with a 1.50 GAA and .946 SV% in two starts with the Atlanta Gladiators this season.\n\nThe Predators have recalled Troy Grosenick from Milwaukee (AHL).\n\nGrosenick has gone 3-0-0 with a 2.60 GAA and .918 SV% in three starts with the Admirals this season. Grosenick was recalled to take Miroslav Svoboda’s spot as Juuse Saros’ backup while Pekka Rinne is on injured reserve. Grosenick has appeared in just two career NHL games, going 1-1-0 while allowing just three goals on 58 shots (.948 SV%).\n\nThe Rangers have sent Marek Mazanec to Hartford (AHL).\n\nMazanec was called up to serve as Henrik Lundqvist's backup over the last two games. He swapped spots with Alexandar Georgiev, who needed to get some work in at the AHL-level to stay sharp.\n\nThe Rangers have recalled Alexandar Georgiev from Hartford (AHL).\n\nGeorgiev got two starts with the Wolf Pack while Henrik Lundqvist started the Rangers’ three games last weeks. Georgiev went 1-1-0 while allowing six goals on 63 shots (.905 SV%) in his tow starts and returns to the NHL, where he might not start a game for a few weeks—their next back-to-back isn’t until Nov.9-Nov.10.\n\nThe Oilers have recalled Cooper Marody from Bakersfield (AHL).\n\nMarody, 21, has recored two goals and four assists in his first five games with Bakersfield so far this season. Since turning pro following a 51-point (16G / 35A) season at the University of Michigan, Marody has registered three goals and six assists (nine points) in eight career AHL games."
