        "text": "The Nashville Predators work at the 2018 NHL Draft in Dallas is done. For the first time in Predators franchise history the organization didn’t select in either the first, second, or third round. The Predators traded what would have been their first selection of the draft, third round (eighty-ninth overall) pick, to the Florida Panthers in exchange for their third round pick in next year’s draft. The end result sees the smallest draft class in franchise history with only four selections taken.\n\nJáchym Kondelík was the first selection of the Predators at the 2018 NHL Draft. The 18-year old Czech forward was taken in the fourth round with the 111th overall pick in the draft.\n\nContinue reading “2018 NHL Draft: Predators Recap” →\n\nThe Nashville Predators did not take long to react to yesterday’s news regarding Paul Fenton. The organization has promoted three individuals from within following Fenton’s move to the Minnesota Wild. Jeff Kealty has been named Assistant General Manager and Director of Scouting, Brian Poile becomes an Assistant General Manager and Director of Hockey Operations, and Scott Nichol has taken over the role as General Manager of the Milwaukee Admirals and Director of Player Development.\n\nContinue reading “Scott Nichol Named New Admirals General Manager” →\n\nPerhaps the biggest change for the Milwaukee Admirals next season has just been triggered. The Minnesota Wild have announced that Paul Fenton will be their next General Manager. Fenton has been with the Nashville Predators since their inception as a franchise and has acted as General Manager of the Milwaukee Admirals in his time as Assistant General Manager to David Poile.\n\nContinue reading “Paul Fenton Named General Manager of the Minnesota Wild” →\n\nThe Nashville Predators have signed defenseman Filip Pyrochta to a two-year entry-level contract. The 21-year old spent last season in his native Czech Republic with Bílí Tygři Liberec. He also played two seasons in the QMJHL with both Victoriaville Tigres and Val-d’Or Foreurs. He was teammates with Anthony Richard in 2015-16 with Val-d’Or.\n\nContinue reading “Nashville Sign Filip Pyrochta to Entry-Level Contract” →\n\nThe American Hockey League (AHL) have approved of it’s divisional alignment for the 2018-19 season. The Central Division as we know of it from this past season is changing. The Cleveland Monsters will officially move out and join the North Division in the AHL’s Eastern Conference. Yet, their departure is minimized with the additions of both the Texas Stars and San Antonio Rampage who switch over from the Pacific Division.\n\nIt is unclear as of yet if the arrival of the Colorado Eagles to that Pacific Division will finally mean a league-wide 76-game regular season schedule or if that division will continue to play a 68-game regular season schedule. Though, based on alignment, one can hope that is he case and that the age of “points percentage” can end. All teams that worked a lesser schedule are now grouped together.\n\nContinue reading “2018-19 AHL Alignment Announced” →\n\nThe Nashville Predators have reassigned Frédéric Allard, Brandon Bollig, Tyler Gaudet, and Emil Pettersson back to the Milwaukee Admirals. The Predators currently trail the Winnipeg Jets 3-2 in their second round match-up. Game 6 is Monday night at 8:30 PM CDT and will take place at the Bell MTS Place.\n\nContinue reading “Allard, Bollig, Gaudet, and Pettersson Reassigned to Milwaukee” →\n\nThe Nashville Predators have announced this morning that they have signed goaltender Miroslav Svoboda to a two-year entry-level contract. The signing of the 23-year old Czech native comes not too long after the Predators had also signed Finnish goaltender Niclas Westerholm to a three-year entry-level contract. With Troy Grosenick under contract for next season it could well be that the 2018-19 goaltending picture for the Milwaukee Admirals has already been set.\n\nContinue reading “Nashville Sign Goaltender Miroslav Svoboda” →"
