        "text": "Article content\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers saw a busy draft weekend to a close with a pair of consecutive seventh round picks, Czech netminder Miroslav Svoboda (described here by Jonathan Willis) at #208, followed immediately by Russian defenceman Ziyat Paigin (alt. Paygin). The latter is a 20-year-old defender who played last season with Ak Bars Kazan of the KHL, for whom he played 33 games. His boxcars of 1-1-2, 2 PiM, +3, suggest limited ice time and modest success. Paigin also played for Russia at the World Juniors, where he won a silver medal.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nThe first thing that grabs one’s attention about Paigin is his immense size, currently listed at 6’6, 209 pounds.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nEdmonton Oilers wrap up 2015 draft by selecting gigantic defender Ziyat Paigin 209th overall Back to video\n\nInternational Scouting Services ranked this player at #112 overall, with a generally postive scouting report:\n\nThe big, lanky defender was an imposing figure on the back end for Ak Bars Kazan in the KHL and with Russia at the 2015 U20 World Championships. Paigin’s upside is based around his raw frame and active, intense defensive game. Long active stick and angles well, needs to focus on foot speed and mobility which will benefit when he adds muscle to his massive frame. Thrives in physical play, likes to finish hits and mix it up along the wall. Can be beat wide by quick opposition forwards catching him on the pivot. Decent skill-set on the puck, although at his best when he simplifies his game. Good shot although not much upside in this department at the next level.\n\nScouts’ comments include mixed reviews on his physical play and backhanded compliments like “good mobility for his size”, but consistently note his good net-front coverage and shot-blocking ability. Said one: “stayat-home d-man that keeps his game simple and boxes out well. PK work was strong all tournament. Knows his limitations and doesn’t try to do too much.”\n\nZiyat Paigin career statistics at Elite Prospects\n\nThe above suggests that Paigin has a contract through the 2016-17 season, but such are typically flexible in the KHL. At this point he looks to be a draft-and-follow, though there may be an option to bring over to the AHL at some future point as he develops.\n\nOther picks/trades at the 2015 NHL Draft\n\nOilers draft C Connor McDavid No. 1 overall\n\nOilers acquire D Griffin Reinhart from the Islanders for the No. 16 and No. 33 picks\n\nOilers acquire G Cam Talbot and the No. 209 pick from the Rangers for the No. 57, No. 79 and No. 184 picks\n\nOilers send No. 86 pick to the Sharks as compensation for head coach Todd McLellan\n\nOilers acquire F Brad Ross, No. 107 pick from Maple Leafs for D Martin Marincin\n\nOilers acquire D Eric Gryba from the Senators for F Travis Ewanyk and the No. 107 pick\n\nOilers draft D Caleb Jones No. 117 overall\n\nOilers draft D Ethan Bear No. 124 overall\n\nOilers draft D John Marino No. 154 overall\n\nOilers draft G Miroslav Svoboda No. 208 overall\n\nOilers draft D Ziyat Paigin No. 209 overall\n\nFollow Bruce McCurdy on Twitter\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
