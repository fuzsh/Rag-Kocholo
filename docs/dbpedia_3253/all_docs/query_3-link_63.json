But we can’t really be focused on that, we’re just excited to rally behind Juuse and we’re really confident with him as well.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFollowing the collision, Rinne stayed in the game and made an excellent save on James Neal a few minutes later, a follow-up stop in traffic on defenceman Rasmus Andersson and then turned away Bennett’s rebound attempt.\n\nRinne then left the game during that stoppage and was replaced by Saros, who made an outstanding save seconds into his stint with the game tied 3-3. Nashville went on to win the game 5-3, extending their winning streak to five games.\n\n“We never want to see that happen to Pekks, he’s such a big part of our team and is playing really well to start the year here, following up from last year,” said Predators head coach Peter Laviolette. “But this is part of the game, it happens to all teams. It’s happened to us right now. Juuse has given us no reason to think he can’t handle this. He’s been outstanding for the last few years.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“(Friday) night was a perfect example. You’re sitting in that game and it’s a close game with him entering the game within 15 seconds he had to make the toughest save maybe on the year so far for him, a back-door play where he had to get across. That’s what he’s done since he’s been here and that’s why there’s a lot of confidence in the players that play in front of him and the team.”\n\nRinne, 35, the reigning Vezina Trophy winner, is 3-1-0 this season with a 2.11 goals against average and .929 save percentage. After his nine-save performance in Calgary, where he was awarded the win, Saros went into Saturday’s game against the Oilers with a 3-0-0 record, 2.22 goals against average and .917 save percentage.\n\nNashville recalled goaltender Miroslav Svoboda from Atlanta in the ECHL for logistical reasons to backup Saros in Edmonton. They’ll recall Troy Grosenick from the Milwaukee of the AHL next week to replace Rinne on the roster.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHaving placed Rinne on IR, he will be out for at least a week and not available for the Predators in their next three games.\n\n“Pekka is probably the best goalie in the league, but at the same, time we have Juuse ready to go,” Forsberg said. “He came in (Friday) night and made a huge couple of saves in the end and helped us win the game. He’s one of the best upcoming goalies in the league as well. We’d rather have Pekka healthy, but the situation is what it is, and we are definitely very confident with Juuse as well.”\n\nThe Predators are currently the top team in the Western Conference. They have confidence in Saros, who is among one of the best backup goaltenders in the league. A fourth-round selection (99th overall) by Nashville in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, the product of Forssa, Finland had a 23-11-5 record last season with a 2.44 goals against average and .925 save percentage.\n\n“You could call him the best backup goalie in the league or you can call him one of the best goalies in the league,” Forsberg said. “He can definitely be a starter on any other team if he wasn’t behind the Vezina Trophy winner. We’re very comfortable playing with him and nothing changes.”\n\nEmail: dvandiest@postmedia.com\n\nOn Twitter: @DerekVanDiest\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
