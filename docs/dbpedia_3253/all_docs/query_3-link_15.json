        "text": "On April 18, 2015, the Edmonton Oilers won the draft lottery, securing the rights to Connor McDavid, the best teenage hockey player in a decade. Six days later, the Oilers hired Peter Chiarelli as their general manager.\n\nPrevious GM Craig MacTavish had been adding picks for what was going to be a watershed draft that summer, dealing David Perron for the No. 16 pick, Jeff Petry for No. 57 and Ales Hemsky for No. 79, among others.\n\nOn the day Chiarelli took over, the Oilers owned the Nos. 1, 16, 33, 57, 79, 86, 117, 124, 154 and 184 picks in the 2015 draft. Combined with the fact it was an extremely deep draft, those 10 picks could have formed the foundation of a championship team.\n\nThat’s the kind of draft cluster that helped the Pittsburgh Penguins build a champion from 2003-06 and the Chicago Blackhawks do something similar from 2002-07. A general manager can’t expect his scouting staff to turn every pick into a quality NHL player, but six picks in the top 90 should lead to at least three quality players.\n\nUrgency\n\nThere must have been something close to panic in the organization when Chiarelli took over. The Oilers had just completed their ninth consecutive year out of the playoffs, and with Rogers Place just over one year away from opening (to higher ticket prices), owner Darryl Katz needed some good news in a hurry.\n\nChiarelli walked to the podium to select McDavid with the first pick and proceeded to ignore a year’s worth of scouting by trading a first-round pick and several second- and third-rounders over the course of the weekend.\n\nThe acquisitions over those 48 hours ranged from quality (Cam Talbot was an excellent goaltender) to curio (a bizarre NHL rule, now deleted, forced the Oilers to send the No. 86 selection to the San Jose Sharks for hiring head coach Todd McLellan).\n\nThe nadir of draft weekend was the trade for Griffin Reinhart in exchange for Nos. 16 and 33. The only way that deal made any sense was if Reinhart was a plug-and-play NHL defenceman at the start of the season. He is still matriculating five years later.\n\nSince that draft, there have been many reports about what happened that weekend. Fans have spent five years mourning after missing out on Mathew Barzal with that first-round pick, but credible intel suggests Joel Eriksson-Ek was the target and Brandon Carlo was the favourite to go at No. 33 if Edmonton kept those picks.\n\nTale of the tape\n\nWith seven rounds in 2015, the six picks left Edmonton a little short. Additionally, two of Edmonton’s picks (No. 208 and 209) were among the final four in the draft, and 115 picks were made between the drafting of McDavid and Caleb Jones at No. 117.\n\nNinety-six players who were drafted in 2015 have played at least one NHL game. That’s an average of three per team. Edmonton has four picks (McDavid, Jones, Ethan Bear and John Marino) who have made the grade.\n\nPlayers drafted in 2015 have appeared in an average of 111 games; Edmonton’s four picks have averaged 139 games. That total has been boosted by McDavid, but all four are now NHL regulars.\n\nLet’s see how Edmonton fared with the benefit of five seasons of evaluation.\n\nConnor McDavid\n\nIt’s difficult to identify the most impressive accomplishment by McDavid over his first five seasons. He led a flawed team into the playoffs in 2017 and last season and won the Hart Trophy in 2017, the Lindsay Memorial Award in 2017 and 2018 and the Art Ross in 2017 and 2018.\n\nHe recovered from a devastating injury with a mind-numbing rehabilitation program before last season and then scored 97 points in 64 games.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive accomplishment for McDavid over his first five seasons has been wearing the weight of a losing team as captain and not allowing the burden to impact his performance. Thankfully, there is some help on the horizon. Leon Draisaitl, the Hart Trophy winner last season, emerged as a centre who can push the river on his own, and the Oilers are a hot goalie and good health from a long playoff run.\n\nCaleb Jones\n\nJones took most of the five years after he was drafted to emerge as an NHL player, but his 43-game audition last season was borderline spectacular. He’s an excellent passer, has great wheels and has grown defensively since draft day. Credit should be given to his coaches along the way, including Jay Woodcroft and Dave Manson of the Bakersfield Condors, but most of that is Jones’ natural ability and his willingness to adapt quickly.\n\nIt’s a good bet he will begin next season playing on the left side of the second pair. Puck IQ suggested he is the best option available to replace Oscar Klefbom while he recovers from injury.\n\nJones’ cap hit ($850,000 for next season and 2021-22) is likely to be a good value, giving general manager Ken Holland more freedom to add to the roster.\n\nOne item that remains a mystery: Who in the organization was most responsible for drafting Jones? He was ranked No. 115 by Central Scouting but didn’t generate significant draft buzz. Nick Boka played for the USA U-18 team that year, was ranked No. 117 by Central Scouting (two spots behind Jones) and went No. 171 to the Minnesota Wild.\n\nMy suspicion has always been Chiarelli was the reason Jones was chosen. Before Jones, the last USHL defenceman drafted by Edmonton was Jeff Petry in 2006, and the last player from the U.S. Development Program picked by the Oilers was Geoff Paukovich in 2004. After Chiarelli arrived, the Oilers more routinely chose players from the program (Jones, Graham McPhee, Skyler Brind’Amour and Philip Kemp).\n\nEthan Bear\n\nBear was ranked No. 97 on Central Scouting’s North American list and TSN’s Craig Button had him at No. 77, four spots ahead of Jones. His scouting report on Bear: “There is a lot of ability in his game to impact the game in a positive way. He gets where he needs to be, he never gets himself in trouble. He’s a body-on-body, one-on-one competitor. If you want to play against him in the defensive zone, you’ll have to earn everything you get. He can get the puck out of the zone well. He knows what his options are (and) doesn’t get himself into trouble. Smart player.”\n\nWe see that in Bear’s game and it helps explain why he was able to take on such a difficult role as a rookie. He played more than 460 minutes against elites, according to Puck IQ, and Edmonton outscored opponents 25-19 while he was on the ice in those situations. If coach Dave Tippett plays Adam Larsson and Tyson Barrie against elites more heavily this season, Bear could show his considerable offensive ability. He is an exceptional outlet passer who has great awareness, according to Button.\n\nBear’s selection has become even more impressive because it happened so late. The last Oilers player drafted in the fifth round to have the same kind of impact as a rookie was Miro Satan, who was drafted in 1993 and scored 18 goals in 1995-96.\n\nJohn Marino\n\nMarino played for the South Shore Kings in Foxborough, Mass. The coach and general manager at the time was Scott Harlow, who was also a part-time scout for the Oilers (he accepted a full-time role in 2016) so we’re probably safe giving him partial credit for finding Marino.\n\nMarino, a fine two-way prospect with impressive offensive flair, played one quality USHL season and then attended Harvard for three years. He was a splendid defender but his offensive potential was obscured by brilliant offensive defender Adam Fox.\n\nThe Oilers were unable to sign him, so Marino was dealt to the Pittsburgh Penguins in July 2019. He settled in and played a fine rookie season. He played effectively on the top four against elite competition and looks poised for a long and successful career.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThe final two players in the class, Miroslav Svoboda and Ziyat Paigin, showed some promise after draft day but are not expected to make it to the NHL. We have reached the five-year point after the 2015 draft and can safely make the call.\n\nMcDavid has delivered — and then some — on his enormous potential in his first five years. We are watching a historic hockey player. His ability to shock and delight with speed and skill remains breathtaking. The only downbeat is the team success, and it’s folly to blame the captain for not being able to lead the Oilers, who have so many holes, to the promised land.\n\nJones, Bear and Marino are just getting started on their NHL careers, with each having a rookie season that was encouraging. It’s safe to say a team that procured the three of them would consider it a success.\n\nThe Oilers’ scouts hit several home runs despite watching their draft picks disappear.\n\nChiarelli failed with the 2015 draft. It’s uncertain if the moves were made due to pressure from ownership or if the plan he put in place on arrival was his vision. Either way, the only thing we can criticize five years later is the reckless pick-trading. Many of the struggles since then could have been solved by simply making the picks. The scouts were ready.\n\n(Photo of Connor McDavid, left, and Ethan Bear: Jason Franson / Canadian Press via Associated Press)"
