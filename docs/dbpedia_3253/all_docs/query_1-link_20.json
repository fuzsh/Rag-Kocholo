No surprises here. McDavid is now the most important piece of the Oilers’ franchise, the rock that the team will be built on for the next decade. Edmonton is incredibly fortunate to get this player.\n\nOilers acquire D Griffin Reinhart from the Islanders for the No. 16 and No. 33 picks. Edmonton adds the big ex-Oil King it has coveted for many years. Reinhart should be expected to compete for a third-pairing job in training camp next season. A natural left side defenceman, he also has experience on the right.\n\nOilers acquire G Cam Talbot and the No. 209 pick from the Rangers for the No. 57, No. 79 and No. 184 picks. The Oilers out-waited Rangers’ GM Glen Sather, and ended up with the goalie they coveted at a pretty reasonable price.\n\nOilers send No. 86 pick to the Sharks as compensation for head coach Todd McLellan. A little housekeeping costs Edmonton a third-round pick, but takes care of their compensation obligation toward San Jose immediately.\n\nOilers acquire F Brad Ross, No. 107 pick from Maple Leafs for D Martin Marincin. Polarizing defenceman Martin Marincin gets a fresh start with a new organization; the Oilers add a draft pick.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOilers acquire D Eric Gryba from the Senators for F Travis Ewanyk and the No. 107 pick. So long, No. 107; we hardly knew you. With one third-pair defenceman gone, the Oilers immediately replace him with a new one from Ottawa.\n\nOilers draft D Caleb Jones No. 117 overall. Now, you do eventually plan to have draft picks, at this entry draft, right? After doing everything but draft, Edmonton adds Seth Jones’ little brother in the fourth round.\n\nOilers draft D Ethan Bear No. 124 overall. Immediately after drafting Jones, the Oilers add an intense shutdown defenceman in the WHL’s Ethan Bear, who only just turned 18 on Saturday.\n\nOilers draft D John Marino No. 154 overall. The blue line was a theme late, as Edmonton added 6’2″ right-shooting rearguard Marino as their third consecutive defence pick. He’s Harvard-bound.\n\nOilers draft G Miroslav Svoboda No. 208 overall. Edmonton did suggest that a goalie would be entering the system at the draft, though possibly most expected him to be added al ittle earlier in the day. This pick came via trade from Tampa Bay for a 2016 seventh-round pick the Oilers had previously got from Dallas.\n\nOilers draft D Ziyat Paigin No. 209 overall. Back to the blue line for the Oilers’ final pick. Paigin is a big KHL defenceman and continues Edmonton’s recent interest in Russia as a draft day fishing hole.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
