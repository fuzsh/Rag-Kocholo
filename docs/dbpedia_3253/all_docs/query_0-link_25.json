        "text": "Recent events might change the Edmonton Oilers’ 2019 draft plans, but as of today the pick isn’t among the team’s tradeable assets. Oilers Entertainment Group CEO and Vice Chair Bob Nicholson told everyone on Jan. 23, “We will look to try to bolster the offence and the defence, but again, we’re not trading away our first pick.” So fans can assume it’s business as usual at the top of the draft. Things might change when a new general manager is named, but for now the plan is to continue building.\n\nThe 2018 draft and Oilers trends\n\nEdmonton’s draft board last summer was once again populated with North American kids. Evan Bouchard (Central Scouting No. 4 North American), Ryan McLeod (No. 16 on the same list), Michael Kesselring (No. 75) led the way, while goalie Olivier Rodrigue ranked No. 2 on the NA goalie list. Only Finnish winger Patrik Siikanen (No. 70 on the European list) was chosen outside Canada or the United States.\n\nThat dovetails with recent Oilers draft trends. During the Peter Chiarelli era (that included Bob Green, Director of Player Personnel for all four drafts) the club spent more draft gold and silver in the top junior leagues in Ontario, Canada’s western provinces and the USA. That includes the 2017 and 2018 drafts, both directed by now interim general manager Keith Gretzky. Here’s a breakdown of Oilers drafts by league since 2015:\n\nOHL (7): Connor McDavid, Markus Niemelainen, Dylan Wells, Dmitri Samorukov, Kirill Maksimov, Evan Bouchard, Ryan McLeod\n\nWHL (4): Ethan Bear, Tyler Benson, Kailer Yamamoto, Stuart Skinner\n\nUSHL (4): Caleb Jones, Graham McPhee, Skyler Brind’Amour, Phil Kemp\n\nJr. Sm-Liiga (2): Aapeli Rasanen, Patrik Siikanen\n\nSm-Liiga (1): Jesse Puljujarvi\n\nSHL (1): Filip Berglund\n\nUSHL Prep (1): John Marino\n\nCzech (1): Miroslav Svoboda\n\nKHL (1): Ziyat Paigin\n\nOJHL (1): Matthew Cairns\n\nNCAA (1): Vincent Desharnais\n\nCzech Jrs (1): Ostap Safin\n\nQMJHL (1): Olivier Rodrigue\n\nUS High School (1): Michael Kesselring\n\nOf the 27 names listed, only seven (26 percent) were drafted from European leagues. What’s more, three of those draft picks (Rasanen, Puljujarvi, Safin) spent their draft plus one seasons playing in North America. Edmonton’s European footprint, specifically the team’s Swedish procurement, has been reduced drastically since 2015.\n\nOnce Keith Gretzky arrived (summer 2016, impacting the last two drafts), the North American focus became even more pronounced. Of the team’s 12 picks in the 2017 and 2018 drafts, 10 were playing in North America and another (Safin) was heading to the QMJHL. Only Siikanen, drafted in the seventh round in 2018, is playing hockey in Europe this season. Note: As with all draft pick analysis in a small sample, we can read things into the actual picks that don’t exist. For instance, Edmonton might have had a Swedish (Adam Boqvist) or Russian (Vitali Kravtsov) pick slotted at No. 10, only to be dashed by the teams picking in front of them. Still, the trend toward North Americans seems real.\n\nThe 2019 draft\n\nLast year at this time, I identified 10 names as possible Oilers selections based on the organization’s own past; one of those names identified was Evan Bouchard. No bonus points there; the club badly needed a right-handed defenceman who could move the puck expertly and quarterback the power play.\n\nThis year’s team needs are similarly obvious. Edmonton needs explosive offensive forwards, with an emphasis on scoring goals. Current standings indicate the team will once again draft inside the top 10 in 2019 (should the Oilers keep the pick).\n\nCentral Scouting’s midterm list is out, as is the industry standard ranking via Bob McKenzie of TSN. We know Edmonton needs goals, and we know Bob Nicholson mentioned “character” being a priority.\n\nThe top three picks at the 2019 draft are likely to be Jack Hughes, Kaapo Kakko and Vasili Podkolzin. There are three WHL kids (Kirby Dach, Dylan Cozens and Bowen Byram) likely to go in the middle of the top 10 overall.\n\nAfter that, the window for Edmonton’s selection opens and leaves the team some exceptional young scoring forwards. USHL stars Matthew Boldy, Trevor Zegras and Cole Caufield would be excellent scoring options for the Oilers. WHL forward Peyton Krebs would also be in the conversation, with Arthur Kaliyev representing an intriguing sniper option from the OHL.\n\nTrading down or out of the first round\n\nDespite Nicholson’s comments this past week, it is known much upheaval is about to take place in the front office. Changes in attitude are likely to be a part of that shuffle. It’s possible Edmonton’s new general manager might feel trading the pick for immediate help is the best course of action. If the goal is to turn the club around in one summer, the list of truly valuable assets who can be moved without immediate negative impact on the big club leads one to believe the pick will eventually be in play.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nIf management is focused on turning this Oilers team north as quickly as possible, then we’re going to see an impact scoring forward added this summer. I think it’ll be via trade. And if the pick isn’t used, then names like Darnell Nurse and Evan Bouchard might be in play. I don’t see the organization trading either player, so the first-round pick is the likely asset out.\n\nIf the Oilers decide to stay the course and use the selection, my guess is we see one of Matthew Boldy, Peyton Krebs or Arthur Kaliyev chosen. A wild-card pick for the second round? Maxim Cajkovic, who is leading an overwhelmed Saint John Sea Dogs team. He was brilliant in Sweden one year ago, and his exceptional talent is being obscured by playing on a poor QMJHL team.\n\n(Photo of Evan Bouchard: Kevin Light/Getty Images)"
