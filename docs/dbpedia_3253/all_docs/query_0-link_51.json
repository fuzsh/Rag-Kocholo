        "text": "The 2015 NHL Draft is finally upon us.\n\nThe first round gets underway on Friday at 7 p.m. ET on NBC Sports Network, while the final six rounds will be completed on Saturday at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThere will be 211 players selected in the draft this year over the span of seven rounds. The Edmonton Oilers hold the first overall pick once again, while the Stanley Cup Final winning Chicago Blackhawks don't possess a single pick in the first round. Thanks to multiple draft day deals, the Boston Bruins hold three consecutive draft picks in the first round.\n\nUnlike most years, there is no mystery as to who will be taken first overall. Connor McDavid, lauded as one of the best prospects since Sidney Crosby, is expected to be taken by the Oilers at the top of the draft. The Buffalo Sabres will in all likelihood take Jack Eichel from Boston University second overall. Both are considered potential franchise altering talents at center.\n\nFor live updates all night and the most up-to-date pick order, follow along with SB Nation's NHL Draft Pick Tracker."
