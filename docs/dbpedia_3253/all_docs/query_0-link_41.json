        "text": "The NHL's off-season continues as the NHL Draft has concluded and teams prepare for Free Agent Frenzy on Monday. Follow all the latest right here on TSN.ca.\n\nKey Links: TSN Trade Tracker Signing Tracker\n\nMaple Leafs acquire rights to Tanev\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs acquire the rights to pending free agent Chris Tanev from the Dallas Stars for forward Max Ellis and a 2026 seventh-round draft pick.\n\nTanev, 34, finished last season with the Stars after he was acquired from the Calgary Flames for defenceman Artem Grushnikov and a draft pick on Feb. 28.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 right-shot defenceman recorded two goals and 19 points in 75 games split between the Flames and Stars. He added two assists in 19 playoff games before the Stars were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers in the Western Conference Final.\n\nTanev is coming off a four-year, $18 million deal he signed with the Flames in October of 2020.\n\nOriginally signed as undrafted free agent by the Vancouver Canucks in 2010, Tanev has 33 goals and 190 points in 782 career games split between the Canucks, Flames, and Stars.\n\nValimaki, Utah HC agree to two-year extension\n\nThe Utah Hockey Club has re-signed defenceman Juuso Valimaki to a two-year, $4 million contract extension, the team announced on Saturday.\n\nValimaki, 25, spent the last two seasons playing for the Arizona Coyotes after claiming him off of waivers at the start of the 2022-23 season.\n\n“We are looking forward to having Juuso return to our team for a third season,” said Utah’s general manager Bill Armstrong. “He is a big, strong, two-way defenceman who has been a great addition to our defensive group over the past two seasons.”\n\nThe Finnish blue liner appeared in 68 contests for Arizona last season, recording two goals and 15 assists while blocking 90 shots.\n\nIn 228 career NHL contests, Valimaki has posted nine goals, 58 assists and 119 penalty minutes across five seasons spent with the Coyotes and the Calgary Flames, who drafted him with the 16th overall selection in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nHe was set to become a restricted free agent on July 1.\n\nFlames working to extend Kylington, still no deal in place\n\nD Oliver Kylington and the Calgary Flames are still attempting to work out a new deal before free agency begins, but the two parties have not been able to agree on terms, as reported by TSN’s Salim Valji.\n\nKylington, 27, has spent his entire career with the Flames after the team selected him with the 60th overall pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nThe Swedish defenceman has recorded 17 goals and 55 points in 201 contests for Calgary in his six year NHL career.\n\nHe is set to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1 unless both sides can come to an agreement before Monday.\n\nSabres to buy out Skinner\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres are in the process of buying out the remainder forward Jeff Skinner's contract.\n\nThe move comes as the NHL's first buyout window of the off-season opened Thursday. It will close on Sunday.\n\nSkinner is signed through the 2026-27 season at a cap hit of $9 million. The 32-year-old forward had 24 goals and 46 points in 74 games this season after topping the 30-goal mark in each of the previous two campaigns. The 32-year-old crossed the 1,000 NHL game mark this season (now at 1,006) but has never appeared in a playoff game.\n\nBuying out Skinner frees up $7.56 million in cap space for the Sabres this summer and save $4.56 million in 2025-26 and $2.56 million in 2026-27, compared to his $9 million currently on the books. It also, however, leaves the Sabres with a cap charge of $2.44 million in the three seasons from 2027-2030.\n\nSabres general manager Kevyn Adams was coy when asked about whether he would buyout Skinner when asked last week.\n\n“There are rumblings on different scenarios,” Adams told reporters. “What I can tell you is from the day our season ended, after my conversations with Terry (Pegula) and kind of where we go from here, every single thing that we’re doing this offseason we ask the question, ‘Does this help our team get better? Does this put us in a position to improve?’\n\n“And we’ve made a lot of decisions up to this point of where we sit today with that in mind and we’re gonna continue. So nothing’s off the table. We’re going to talk about everything. We’re gonna look at every scenario. But that’s probably as far as I’d go on specifics right now.”\n\nThe Sabres have turned back to Lindy Ruff as their new head coach as the team looks to make the playoffs next season for the first time since 2011, when Ruff was also head coach. Buffalo finished with a 39-37-6 record this season under Don Granato, who was dismissed after missing the postseason for the third year in a row.\n\nNHL Draft Round 7:\n\n194.

He was acquired from the Philadelphia Flyers in June of 2023 for a draft pick.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 centre is on the sixth season of a seven-year, $50 million deal with an annual cap hit of $3.57 million with the Flyers eating a portion of his salary.

He added an assist in two playoff games before his team was eliminated by the New York Rangers in the second round.\n\nUtah acquires Sergachev from Lightning, Marino from Devils\n\nThe Utah HC have acquired defenceman Mikhail Sergachev from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for defenceman J.J Moser, prospect Conor Geekie, pick No. 199, and a second round pick in 2025.\n\nSergachev, 26, recorded two goals and 19 points in 34 games in a season that was mired with injuries. He appeared in two playoff games before his team was eliminated by the Florida Panthers in the first round.\n\nDrafed ninth overall by the Montreal Canadiens in 2016, Sergachev has 48 goals and 257 points in 475 career games split between the Canadiens and Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nMoser, 24, recorded five goals and 26 points in 80 games with the Arizona Coyotes last season.\n\nDrafted 60th overall by the Coyotes in 2021, Moser has 16 goals and 72 points in 205 career games.\n\nGeekie was drafted 11th overall by the Coyotes in 2022 and recorded 43 goals and 99 points in 55 games split between the Swift Current Broncos and Wenatchee Wild of the WHL last season.\n\nThe Lightning are not retaining any of Sergachev's salary, according to LeBrun, which could be space made to re-sign captain Steven Stamkos, according to TSN Hockey Insider Pierre LeBrun.\n\nUtah also acquired defenceman John Marino from the New Jersey Devils on Saturday in exchange for the No. 49 pick and the Edmonton Oilers second-round pick in 2025.\n\nMarino, 27, appeared in 75 games with the Devils last season, recording four goals and 25 points.\n\nThe 6-foot-1 right-shot defenceman is entering the fourth season of a six-year, $26.4 million deal with an annual cap hit of $4.4 million. He is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2026-27 season.\n\nDrafted 154th overall by the Oilers in 2015, Marino has 18 goals and 107 points in 328 career games split between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Devils.\n\nSharks place Knyzhov on waivers\n\nThe San Jose Sharks have placed defenceman Nikolai Knyzhov on unconditional waivers on Saturday\n\nMaple Leafs trade down\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs have traded pick No. 58 to the Florida Panthers for pick No. 225 and a second round pick in 2025.\n\nKings add Jeannot\n\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning have traded forward Tanner Jeannot to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for No. 118 and a second-round pick in 2025.\n\nJeannot, 27, appeared in 55 games last season, recording seven goals, 14 points, and 75 penalty minutes. He added an assist in four playoff games before his team was eliminated by the Florida Panthers in the first round.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 winger is on the final season of a two-year, $5.33 million deal with an annual cap hit of $2.665 million. He is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nJeannot was acquired from the Lightning from the Nashville Predators in exchange for defenceman Cal Foote and five draft picks in February of 2023.\n\nThe Estevan, Sask., native’s best season came during the 2021-22 campaign, registering 24 goals, 41 points and 130 penalty minutes in 81 games with the Predators.\n\nOriginally signed as an undrafted free agent by the Predators in April of 2018, Jeannot has 42 goals, 80 points, and 314 penalty minutes in 227 career games.\n\nUtah making a splash?\n\nTSN Hockey Insider Darren Dreger is keeping an eye on the Utah Hockey Club, who are believed to be getting ready to make a significant trade.\n\nUtah selected Tij Iginla out of the Kelowna Rockets of the WHL last night with the sixth overall pick on Friday.\n\nSabres acquire Malenstyn\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres have acquired forward Beck Malenstyn from the Washington Capitals in exchange for the No. 48 pick in Saturday's draft.\n\nMalenstyn recorded six goals and 21 points in 81 games with the Capitals last season. He also appeared in four playoff games before his team was eliminated by the New York Rangers in the first round.\n\nThe 6-foot-3 winger is a restricted free agent and is coming off a two-year $1.525 million deal he signed in June of 2022.\n\nDrafted 145th overall by the Capitals in 2016, Malenstyn has eight goals and 24 points in 105 career games.\n\nRed Wings, Rangers talking Trouba\n\nLarry Books of the New York Post reports that the New York Rangers and the Detroit Red Wings are discussing a trade that would send Rangers captain Jacob Trouba to the Motor City.\n\n\"A well-placed source has told The Post that [Rangers] GM Chris Drury is working on a deal to send the captain to the Red Wings, a trade that the Michigan native would presumably accept after having played as a freshman for the Wolverines in 2012-13,\" wrote Brooks. \"We are told the Rangers may retain $2.5 million per year on the two remaining seasons of Trouba's $8 million annual cap charge.\"\n\nTrouba, 30, recorded three goals and 22 points in 69 games with the Rangers last season. He added a goal and seven points in 16 playoff games before his team was eliminated by the Florida Panthers in the Eastern Conference Final.\n\nDrafted ninth overall by the Winnipeg Jets in 2012, Trouba has 73 goals and 309 points in 748 career games split between the Jets and Rangers.\n\nTrouba won the Mark Messier Leadership Award in 2024 after captaining the New York Rangers to a 55-23-4 record to win the Presidents' Trophy.\n\nThe Rochester, N.Y., native represented the United States three times at the World Championship, taking home a bronze medal in 2013. He also represented Team North America at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey in a fifth-place performance.\n\nBlue Jackets prepare to be active\n\nGeneral manager Don Waddell told team reporter Jeff Svoboda on Friday that the team is looking to make some hockey trades.\n\nWaddell said it may be easier to be active on day two of the draft now that the first round has been completed.\n\nThe Blue Jackets are looking to find a partner to trade forward Patrik Laine after both sides agreed a fresh start was best for the 26-year-old winger.\n\nLaine is entering the third season of a four-year, $34.8 million deal with an annual cap hit of $8.7 million.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 winger recorded six goals and nine points in 18 games in a season that was mired with injuries.\n\nLaine also entered the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program in January citing the need to look after his mental health.\n\n“After careful consideration and discussion with my support network and the team, I have recognized the importance of prioritizing my mental health and well-being,” Laine said on Instagram. “Hockey has been my passion and my life, but I have to come to realize that in order to perform at my best, I need to take this time to focus on myself.”\n\nMaple Leafs eyeing Tanev, Zadorov\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs would like to add a defenceman when free agency opens on Monday, but their cap situation could hinder their ability to do so.\n\nMaple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving has been linked to free agent defencemen Chris Tanev and Nikita Zadorov, but they may not be able to compete with the other teams that want their services, according to TSN Hockey Insider Pierre LeBrun on Friday.\n\n\"Treliving would like to compete for free agent defencemen Tanev and Zadorov, but it's not unlimited cap space for the top contenders and certainly not the Maple Leafs,\" said LeBrun.\n\nLeBrun notes that the Vancouver Canucks have offered Zadorov a contract that is worth $5 million annually in order to keep him in Vancouver but the 6-foot-6 left-shot defenceman elected to test free agency.\n\n\"[The Canucks] came in late and they went as high as $5 million AAV,\" said LeBrun. \"So, it would make a lot of sense that he can get that [on the open market]. Can he get it from the Maple Leafs? I'm told there are 10 teams with considerable interest in Zadorov and the Maple Leafs are among them. They like him for a lot of different reasons and there's history with Treliving, but it comes down to a cap situation for Toronto.\"\n\nOilers to buy out Campbell?\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers solidified their goaltending position on Friday after re-signing backup netminder Calvin Pickard to a two-year, $2 million contract.\n\nEdmonton now switches their focus to goalie Jack Campbell, who is entering the third season of a five-year, $25 million contract he signed in July of 2022.\n\n\"The Oilers have had some talks on moving Campbell to get off his contract and if they don't, the buy out window closes on Sunday, and they're willing to use it,\" said TSN Hockey insider Chris Johnston on Friday.\n\nA buyout would save the Oilers $3.9 million on their cap next season, $2.7 million in 2025-26, and $2.4 million during the 2026-27 campaign. The Oilers would then take a cap hit of $1.5 million the following three seasons.\n\nKane, Red Wings in discussions\n\nThe Detroit Red Wings are making efforts to retain free agent forward Patrick Kane, according to Johnston.\n\nKane, 35, signed with the Red Wings in November of 2023 and recorded 20 goals and 47 points in 50 games.\n\n\"Patrick Kane is still in discussions with the Red Wings and I think that there's at least a reasonable chance he stays there,\" said Johnston. \"There's been a lot of people connecting him with the New York Rangers [where he finished the 2022-23 season] and maybe his hometown Buffalo Sabres, but it sounds like Detroit is still in decent position if they can get an agreement on term.\n\nStamkos in play for Predators\n\nThe Nashville Predators are expected to make a major pitch for Tampa Bay Lightning captain Steven Stamkos should he become a free agent on Monday, according to Johnston\n\n\"A team that I'm really going to focus on here is the Predators,\" said Johnston on Friday. \" They are quite motivated to try and bring him in there and they offer some of the same benefits as living in the Tampa bay area. Certainly, if he hits the open market they'll be a top suitor.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-1 centre had been working hard to come to an agreement to stay in Tampa Bay, but his agent Don Meehan announced on Friday that he expects his client to enter unrestricted free agency.\n\nLeBrun believes that the two sides are about $1.5 to $2 million apart per year and the Lightning have reached their limit on what they can afford in their current salary cap structure. However, he also noted that the Pittsburgh Penguins were in a similar situation with star forward Evgeni Malkin during the 2022 off-season, but they were able to come to an agreement at the 11th hour.\n\nMcGroarty market heating up\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets are expected to trade prospect Rutger McGroarty this off-season and his trade market for the former first-round pick is heating up as the NHL Draft continues on Saturday.\n\nJohnston reported on Friday that the Montreal Canadiens have had discussions with the Jets regarding McGroarty while taking offers on their No. 5 overall selection, which was eventually used to draft forward Ivan Demidov.\n\n\"I know at one point [the Canadiens] had discussions on McGroarty, not necessarily for the fifth overall pick itself,\" said Johnston. \"Ultimately when Demidov was available, that stuff went away but it wasn't for lack of trying from general manager Kent Hughes. You wonder if some of those trade conversations pick up when we return for day two of the draft.\"\n\nThe Canadiens weren't the only team interested in McGroarty as TSN Hockey Insider Darren Dreger reports a number of teams are interested in the 20-year-old forward and specifically named the Minnesota Wild as a possible suitor.\n\n\"McGroarty is on the radar for a lot of teams and clearly [Jets general manager] Kevin Cheveldayoff didn't get a trade offer that made sense,\" said Dreger. \"You have to keep in mind this prospect was drafted 14th overall in 2022, so the Jets put themselves in a position with a really good player that they considered to be a big part of their future. So, there's a level of disappointment in all this, but maybe Montreal steps up, maybe Minnesota steps up, there's plenty of interest.\"\n\nOn Friday, Mike McIntyre of the Winnipeg Free Press noted that the Boston Bruins, New York Islanders, Buffalo Sabres, and Columbus Blue Jackets also checked in on McGroarty.\n\nContentId(1.2141988): What can be expected from Canadian teams on second day of NHL Draft?"
