        "text": "Princess Madeleine of Sweden was in a joyous mood as she found herself back in Stockholm, Sweden, for a royal family reunion in honour of a special occasion. Madeleine and her husband, British-American financier Christopher O’Neill, made the journey from their home in Florida to toast her sister Crown Princess Victoria on her 46th birthday.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Duchess of Edinburgh and the Duchess of Gloucester join forces to support the King and Queen\n\nThe Duchess of Edinburgh, elegantly attired in Etro, was among those invited to a royal reception at Windsor Castle\n\nCrown Princess Victoria, the king and queen's eldest daughter and heir to the throne, marked the occasion at the grand Borgholm Castle. She was joined by her parents; her husband Prince Daniel and their two children; her brother Prince Carl Philip and his wife Princess Sofia; and Princess Madeleine and Christopher.\n\nThe Swedish royal women coordinated in floral, floaty and feminine dresses with touches of pinks, pastels and white. Princess Madeleine opted for a floral embroidered dress, matched with some charming flower-shaped earrings and delightful green sandals.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Crown Prince of Dubai – the action man royal – delights followers with his latest daring feat\n\nIn typically intrepid fashion, the Crown Prince of Dubai, Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, embarked on a difficult hike in Yosemite National Park\n\nMadeleine, the youngest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden, is reportedly planning a permanent return to her home country next year. The couple has lived in Florida since 2018 but in March of this year, they announced their intentions to move back to the princess’s home city of Stockholm. Originally, the couple was planning to move back with their children later this year, but it was sadly postponed until 2024 for logistical purposes. As a result, the children will be starting their academic school year in the US.\n\nPrincess Madeleine of Sweden and her husband have lived the ultimate jet-settling lifestyle, having lived in London and New York, before settling in sunny Florida. The couple’s children are no longer titled his/her royal highness due to the Swedish monarchy’s intention to streamline their royal family (in a similar vein to the Danish monarchy).\n\nRead More\n\nStockholm on hold: Princess Madeleine of Sweden’s move to her homeland postponed\n\nPrincess Madeleine of Sweden and her family are swapping America for Sweden in due course\n\nThis means that Princess Madeleine’s children will no longer be required to perform royal duties. In a statement posted on Instagram back in 2019, Princess Madeleine commented on the change in procedure. ‘Chris and I think it is good that our children now have a greater opportunity to shape their own lives as private individuals in the future’."
