        "text": "Sweden's Princess Sofia is taking a break from her royal duties to join the front line fight against coronavirus by taking a job in a hospital.\n\nThe royal, who is married to the eldest son of King Carl XVI Gustaf, underwent a training scheme at a Stockholm university before becoming a medical assistant at Sophiahemmet hospital.\n\nShe shared a photo of her wearing full scrubs on social media, and has been widely praised for stepping up to help at this awful time.\n\nThe snap shows her name badge, which simply says 'Sofia'.\n\nA statement from the Swedish Royal Family said: \"In the crisis we find ourselves in, the Princess wants to get involved and make a contribution as a voluntary worker to relieve the large workload of health care professionals.\n\nHer new role will see her cleaning, helping with patient care and assisting in the kitchens.\n\nSofia, 35, was a model before marrying husband Prince Carl Phillips, who is fourth in line to the throne, and the couple have two children - Alexander and Gabriel.\n\nLast year King Carl XVI Gustaf stripped the couple's children and their three younger cousins of their HRH titles in a bid to slim down their Royal Family - not too dissimilar from Prince Charles's vision for the British family.\n\nThis means they will no longer perform any royal duties and will not get any taxpayer money.\n\nTheir titles - which they shall retain - will not be passed on to their future spouses or children. They themselves are still in the line of succession to the Swedish throne.\n\nThe whole royal family had been involved in the decision, and it had been an ongoing debate for several years.\n\nIt's believed the idea was to provide a better idea of the future roles of the children of the two younger children of the king.\n\nIn a statement from Fredrik Wers√§ll, the royal house said: \"His Majesty The King has decided on changes to The Royal House.\n\n\"The purpose of these changes is to establish which members of The Royal Family may be expected to perform official duties incumbent on the Head of State or related to the function of the Head of State.\n\n\"His Majesty The King has decided that the children of Their Royal Highnesses Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia, and the children of Her Royal Highness Princess Madeleine and Mr Christopher O'Neill will no longer be members of The Royal House.\""
