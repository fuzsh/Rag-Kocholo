        "text": "Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt (born March 31, 1757, St. Mårtens, near Turku, Finland, Kingdom of Sweden [now in Finland]—died Aug. 19, 1814, Tsarskoye Selo [now Pushkin], near St. Petersburg, Russia) was a Swedish statesman prominent in diplomacy and military affairs.\n\nAppointed gentleman to Gustav III of Sweden in 1781, Armfelt was employed in the negotiations with Catherine II of Russia (1783) and with the Danish government (1787) and was one of the king’s most trusted and active counselors during the war with Russia in 1788–90. In 1786 Armfelt became a founding member of the Swedish Academy. In 1788, when the Danes invaded Sweden and threatened Gothenburg, he, under the king’s direction, organized the Dalarna levies. He remained faithful to Gustav when nearly all the nobility deserted him; and he was the Swedish plenipotentiary at the Peace of Värälä (1790).\n\nOn his deathbed in 1792, Gustav III entrusted his son to Armfelt and made him a member of the council of regency; but the duke-regent Charles (afterward Charles XIII) sent Armfelt as Swedish ambassador to Naples to get rid of him. From Naples Armfelt communicated with Catherine II, urging her to make a military demonstration in favour of the Gustavians. The plot was discovered by the regent’s spies, and Armfelt escaped only with the help of Queen Caroline of Naples (1794). He then fled to Russia. When Gustav IV Adolf attained his majority, Armfelt was rehabilitated and sent as Swedish ambassador to Vienna (1802), but he had to quit that post two years later for attacking the Austrian government’s attitude toward Napoleon Bonaparte. From 1805 to 1807, he was commander in chief of the Swedish forces in Pomerania, where he retarded the French conquest."
