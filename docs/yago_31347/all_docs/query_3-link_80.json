        "text": "The big move for the daughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia has been in the works for years\n\nPrincess Madeleine and her family are moving back to Sweden after spending the past years in Florida.\n\nAs the Swedish princess celebrated her 42nd birthday on June 10, the Royal House of Sweden revealed that the royal and her husband, Christopher O'Neill, were relocating back to her home country from the United States with their three kids — Princess Leonore, 10, Prince Nicolas, 8, and Princess Adrienne, 6.\n\n\"Today marks the birthday of H.K.H. Princess Madeleine 42 years,\" the court captioned a formal portrait of the family of five coordinating in blue ensembles on Instagram, per a translation.\n\n\"Princess Madeleine and her family are now moving home to Sweden. After several years living abroad, the Princess and Mr. Christopher O'Neill have decided that the family will live in Stockholm for the time being,\" the message said.\n\nRelated: Princess Madeleine of Sweden Posts 'Private Moments' from Her Royal Wedding on 10th Anniversary\n\nThe Royal House of Sweden's information manager Margareta Thorgren previously said the family would move in stages, Expressen reported.\n\nPrincess Madeleine is the youngest daughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, and her move back to her home country has been in the works for years. In March 2023, the Royal House of Sweden announced that Madeleine, Christopher and their kids were moving back to Sweden after living in Florida since 2018. The palace said that the princess and her family planned to \"relocate to Sweden indefinitely\" and intended to make the move in August 2023. However, it emerged that summer that the plans were bumped back to 2024.\n\nRelated: Meet the Swedish Royals: A Guide to Sweden's Royal Family Tree\n\n\"The plan is for the family to move to Sweden. It will be postponed until 2024, according to the information I have,\" Thorgren told Expressen.\n\n\"It is simply that the time for the family with all that a move entails, it has been a little too short,\" she added about the reasoning behind the decision.\n\nPrincess Madeleine and Christopher’s love story began in the U.S., and they called the country home for the last six years. The royal met the British-American financier in 2010 in New York City, where she was working for Queen Silvia's World Childhood Foundation. The Swedish Royal Court announced their engagement in October 2012, and the couple wed at the Royal Palace in Stockholm that summer.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

The family of three moved to Stockholm in 2015 shortly before Prince Nicolas was born and relocated again to London later that year, Hello! reported. Princess Adrienne was born in Stockholm in 2018, and the family made the transatlantic move to Florida a few months after her arrival.\n\nDuring their time in the United States, Madeleine and Christopher, 49, embraced the American holiday of Halloween (festivities for which are still \"relatively new\" in Sweden!\") with their family while staying connected to Swedish heritage traditions and visits. In September 2023, Princess Madeleine and her husband traveled to Sweden for King Carl XVI Gustaf's Golden Jubilee events commemorating his 50-year reign, and the royal mom posted a photo with her crew to celebrate Sweden’s National Day last June. Madeleine, Leonore and Adrienne wore traditional dress, while Christopher and Nicholas twinned in suits.\n\nThough Princess Leonore, Prince Nicolas and Princess Adrienne go by their royal titles, the appellations are the extent of their royal styling. In 2019, King Carl XVI Gustaf announced that Princess Madeleine and Christopher’s kids, as well as the children of Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia, were no longer official members of the royal house and lost their official HRH (His/Her Royal Highness) titles. The King's grandchildren retained their titles of prince or princess, but the titles became personal and any future spouses or children will not have a right to them.\n\nThe shakeup did not affect Princess Estelle, 12, and Prince Oscar, 8 – the children of heir to the throne Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel. Unlike their cousins, both Estelle (who is expected to become monarch after her mother) and Oscar remain part of the royal house.\n\nAfter the announcement, Princess Madeleine voiced her support for her dad's decision.\n\n\"This change has been planned for a long time. Chris and I think it's good that our children are now getting a greater opportunity to shape their own lives as private individuals in the future,\" she wrote on social media.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
