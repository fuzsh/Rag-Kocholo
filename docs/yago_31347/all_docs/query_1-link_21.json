        "text": "born on January 13 Julian and\n\nJanuary 24 Gregorian calendar 1746 in Stockholm, Sweden\n\ndied on March 29, 1792 in Stockholm, Sweden\n\nHe was from the ducal house of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorf and King of Sweden from 1771 to 1792.\n\nReference to the Goldener Adler\n\nOn October 25, 1783 Gustav III. of Sweden visited us on his trip to Italy. He traveled incognito and visited Archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria.\n\nHe visited Ambras Castle and the Court Church in the afternoon. In the evening at half past eight he started his departure.\n\nLife and facts\n\nGustav III. was born on January 24, 1746, the eldest son of Adolf Friedrich, later King of Sweden, and his wife Luise Ulrike of Prussia, a sister of Friedrich II.\n\nHe is said to have been intelligent, eloquent, kind, ambitious and full of drive as a youth, but also lacking in seriousness, perseverance and moderation. He was very fond of the fine arts.\n\nThe founding of the Royal Opera, which he pursued, the establishment of his own Swedish theatrical troupe in 1773, was and remained a significant step for Sweden in terms of cultural history.\n\nFor political reasons, he had to marry Sophia of Denmark in 1766.\n\nHe carried out a series of reforms in finance and law, guaranteed freedom of the press and religion, and expanded the navy, which became one of the largest in Europe. Through his efforts, Swedish trade rose to new heights.\n\nGustav was purposefully shot at a masquerade ball and died from the gunshot wound almost two weeks later on March 29, 1792.\n\nBefore that, he established a regency for his underage son Gustav IV Adolf."
