The couple met through mutual friends after she moved to New York.\n\nTRENDING: Princess Kate makes hilarious confession about little Prince Louis\n\nTheir romance was confirmed when he accompanied Princess Madeleine to the christening of her niece, Princess Estelle, in May 2012.\n\nThe Princess went on to find love with Christopher O'Neill\n\nLater that year, Christopher proposed to Madeleine after obtaining permission from her father, and on 25th of October 2012, the engagement was officially announced in a video posted on the Royal Family's website.\n\nIn the video, Chris stated: \"Madeleine and I have known each other for the past two years. Recently I summoned up the courage to ask her to marry me. Thankfully she said yes.\""
