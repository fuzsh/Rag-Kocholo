He was the eldest son of Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Queen Louisa Ulrika of Prussia.\n\nGustav was a vocal opponent of what he saw as the abuse of political privileges seized by the nobility since the death of King Charles XII. Seizing power from the government in a coup d'état, called the Swedish Revolution, in 1772 that ended the Age of Liberty, he initiated a campaign to restore a measure of Royal autocracy, which was completed by the Union and Security Act of 1789, which swept away most of the powers exercised by the Swedish Riksdag (parliament) during the Age of Liberty, but at the same time it opened up the government for all citizens, thereby breaking the privileges of the nobility.\n\nMore information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_III\n\nSophia Magdalena of Denmark (Danish: Sophie Magdalene; Swedish: Sofia Magdalena; 3 July 1746 – 21 August 1813) was Crown Princess of Sweden by her marriage to Gustav III. She was liked by many in the Caps party, believing she was a symbol of virtue and religion. In 1771, Sophia's husband ascended to the throne and became King of Sweden, making Sophia Queen of Sweden. Their coronation was on 29 May 1772.\n\nQueen consort of Sweden:\n\nTenure: 12 February 1771 – 29 March 1792\n\nCoronation: 29 May 1772\n\nBorn: 3 July 1746\n\nCharlottenborg Palace, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nDied: 21 August 1813 (aged 67)\n\nUlriksdal Palace, Sweden\n\nBurial: Riddarholmen Church\n\nSpouse: Gustav III of Sweden\n\n​(m. 1766; died 1792)​\n\nIssue: Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n\nPrince Carl Gustav, Duke of Småland\n\nHouse: Oldenburg\n\nFather: Frederick V of Denmark\n\nMother: Louise of Great Britain"
