        "text": "Gustav has been called the first public child, from the age of 3 he is a public person. At the time of his mother's conspiracy he is about 10, and all this obviously has an effect on him. The question of how to create a strong monarchy will never leave him. And neither will the understanding that you have to play the game and hide your true feelings and thoughts, if you wish to reach your goal.\n\nGustav's relationship with his mother is a complicated one. He grows up very tightly bonded to her, but he is shy of other women. Still, he has to get married. The Queen was Prussian and has her heart set on a daughter-in-law from her native country. But it's the Riksdag, or Parliament, who will decide. At the age of 4 Gustav is engaged to a Danish princess of the same age, Sofia Magdalena. They marry when they are 20. When Sofia Magdalena arrives in Stockholm the Queen doesn't even pretend to like her. And what about the young married couple, how did they get on? Not well. Gustav and Sofia Magdalena will never be happy together.\n\nOne evening in 1771, Gustav's father, Adolf Fredrik sits down to a huge meal of smoked fish, caviar, lobster, sauerkraut, meat and turnips - all washed down with a bottle of champagne. Not surprisingly, he gets a bad tummy ache and 45 minutes later he is dead. The very same evening, Gustav is declared King: Gustav III.\n\nThe King is dead - long live the King!\n\nSo, where is this new King? In Paris, visiting King Louis XV, having the time of his life and meeting everyone who is anyone. It takes over two weeks for the news to reach him. How does he react? He is silent for a moment. Then he says that he's deep-ly sorry to become King so soon. He will never again have friends. He says:\n\n\"People in general rarely have friends. Kings never do.\"\n\nHe is 25 years old.\n\nPhoto Alexander Roslin - King Gustav III of Sweden and his Brothers - Google Art Project by Alexander Roslin is licensed under public domain"
