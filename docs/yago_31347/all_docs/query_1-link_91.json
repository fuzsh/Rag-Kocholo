He led Sweden to military supremacy during the Thirty Years War, helping to determine the political as well as the religious balance of power in Europe.\n\nAt this time Sweden controlled much of Germany. [1]\n\nGustav II Adolf commissioned the construction of the ship Wasa. On its maiden voyage in August 1628 it sank only a few hundred meters from the shipyard in a light squall (wind force 3, a light wind).[2][3][4]\n\nBirth\n\nGustav Adolf was born December 9, 1594 at Stockholm Castle as the seventh child of Karl IX Vasa.
