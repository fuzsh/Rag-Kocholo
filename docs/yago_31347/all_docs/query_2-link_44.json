        "text": "The Vasa era – Independence and power struggle\n\nThe first room of the exhibition presents armour and artefacts from the Vasa era. In the 16th century, Sweden became a united and independent kingdom with a royal power that was hereditary and a church that obeyed the King.\n\nSweden Expands\n\nRoom two of the exhibition features, among other things, Queen Kristina’s coronation robe and Gustav II Adolf’s warhorse Streiff. These artefacts have a strong connection to the age of Sweden as a major power.\n\nThe age of the Great Wars\n\nIn room three, there are artefacts such as Karl XI’s Roman armour and Ulrika Eleonora’s late 17th-century masquerade jacket. During the second half of the 17th century, Sweden’s geographical distribution was at its greatest. It was also an age of constant wars.\n\nThe age of liberty and revolutions\n\nRoom four shows artefacts such as Princess Sofia Magdalena’s wedding dress and the hat and mask worn by Gustav III at the masquerade on 16 March 1792. Sweden lost large tracts of land during this period, but was still the strongest of the Nordic countries.\n\nNationalism and New Ideals\n\nRoom five contains, among other things, Queen Victoria’s dress that she wore to the silver wedding in 1906 and the red velvet boots with sewn-on gold crowns worn by Karl XIV Johan at the coronation. The 19th century brought crisis and drama. It was no longer self-evident that the Swedish monarchy would live on.\n\nMonarchy in the age of democracy\n\nThe last room of the exhibition contains royal artefacts from the modern era, such as Crown Princess Victoria's 1995 coming of age dress. There is also the royal baptismal cradle made for Karl XI, in which both Prince Carl Philip and Princess Estelle have lain."
