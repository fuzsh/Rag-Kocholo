        "text": "Princess Madeleine was reunited with her family in Sweden this weekend after it was confirmed that her move back to Stockholm has been postponed.\n\nThe royal, 41, and her financier husband, Christopher O'Neill, attended Crown Princess Victoria's birthday celebrations at Borgholm Castle.\n\nMadeleine looked beautiful in an Alexis floral embroidered dress with voluminous sleeves. She teamed her outfit with a pair of sage green sandals and a pair of statement flower-shaped earrings.\n\nMeanwhile, Crown Princess Victoria, who turned 46 on Friday, opted for a H&M cream lace off-the-shoulder dress, while her sister-in-law, Princess Sofia, 38, chose a pink number from byTiMo.\n\nThe only royal children present for the special concert and photocall were Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel's kids, Princess Estelle, 11, and Prince Oscar, seven.\n\nMadeleine and Christopher are parents to Princess Leonore, nine, Prince Nicolas, eight, and Princess Adrienne, five, while Sofia and Prince Carl Philip share three sons â€“ Prince Alexander, seven, Prince Gabriel, five, and Prince Julian, two.\n\nLast month it was confirmed that Madeleine and her family's return to Stockholm from Florida in the US has been delayed until 2024.\n\nMargareta Thorgren, who is Information Manager at Sweden's royal palace, told newspaper Expressen that the reason was not a migration issue and not related to the house sale, adding that there hasn't been enough time for the family with all that a move entails.\n\nShe also confirmed that Leonore, Nicolas and Adrienne will start their respective school and preschool semesters this autumn in the US.\n\nThe family-of-five first moved to Florida five years ago, but have also lived in New York and London.\n\nAs of November 2019, Leonore, Nicolas and Adrienne, and Prince Carl and Princess Sofia's sons are no longer styled His/Her Royal Highness as part of a move by King Carl XVI Gustaf to strictly associate Swedish royalty to the office of the head of state.\n\nThe young royals are not expected to carry out full-time public duties in future. Learn more about European monarchies in the clip below...\n\nMadeleine posted a statement on her Instagram account at the time, writing: \"This change has been planned for a long time. Chris and I think it is good that our children now have a greater opportunity to shape their own lives as individuals in the future.\""
