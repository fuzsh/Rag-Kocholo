Photo: Binz, Berlin.\n\t\n\tItalian actor <strong>Fosco Giachetti</strong> (1900 –1974) was the leading man in several fascism propaganda films of the 1930’s and 1940’s.\n\t\n\tFosco Giachetti was born in 1904 in Livorno, Italy. He was the brother of actor Gianfranco Giachetti. Among his first film appearances were the protagonists of Luci sommerse/Dimmed Lights (1934, Adelqui Migliar) and of Lo squadrone bianco/The White Squadron (1936, Augusto Genina). He became the leading man in such fascism propaganda films as Tredici uomini e un cannone/Thirteen Men and a Cannon (1936, Giovacchino Forzano), Sentinelle di bronzo/Sentinels of Bronze (1937, Romolo Marcellini), Scipione l'Africano/Scipio the African (1937, Carmine Gallone), the Italian version of Carmen fra i rossi/Carmen Among the Reds (1939, Edgar Neville), L'assedio dell'Alcazar/The Siege of the Alcazar (1940, Augusto Genina) with Mireille Balin and Maria Denis, and Bengasi (1942, Augusto Genina) with Amedeo Nazzari. At the Venice Film Festival 1942 Fosco Giachetti won the Best Actor award for Bengasi. He co-starred with Alida Valli and Rossano Brazzi in Goffredo Alessandrini's unauthorized 1942 film version of Ayn Rand's novel We the Living. The film appeared in Fascist Italy in two separate parts: Noi Vivi/We the Living and Addio, Kira/Goodbye, Kira. They are essentially one film. It was the grim story of post-revolutionary Russia, the forced collectivization of the economy and the brutal suppression of human rights, all told from the viewpoint of one woman, Kira. Ayn Rand's novel was autobiographical and was essentially a diatribe against the loss of individuality in totalitarian societies.The film attracted a sizable audience in Italy. The Fascist government saw the film(s) as a condemnation of Soviet misery but when it became aware that the film(s) implied a condemnation of all totalitarian states, left and right, it withdrew them from distribution.\n\t\n\tDuring the WWII Fosco Giachetti acted also in Un colpo di pistola/A Pistol Shot (1942, Renato Castellani), and Fari nella nebbia/Headlights in the Fog (1942, Gianni Franciolini), but with less success than he used to have before the war. After the war, he returned to the stage. He worked in Spain with Edgar Neville in Nada/Nothing (1947) and in Carne de horca/Sierra Morena (1953, Ladislao Vajda). In 1959 he had a supporting role in Dino Risi's successful comedy Il mattatore/Love and Larceny, starring Vittorio Gassman. In 1964, he appeared in an tv adaptation of A. J. Cronin's novel The Citadel, La Cittadella. Other films in which he appeared were La Monaca di Monza/The Nun of Monza (1962, Carmnine Gallone), the musical Samba (1965, Rafael Gil) with the popular Spanish star Sara Montiel, and the masterpiece Il Conformista/The Conformist (1970, Bernardo Bertolucci).. Fosco Giachetti died in 1974, Rome, Italy, because of heart problems. In 2003, in Sesto Fiorentino a galleria was opned in tribute to him, the name is Galleria Fosco Giachetti.\n\t\n\tSources: Wikipedia, and IMDb.",
