It highlights the values and passions\n\nthat distinguish Siena and render it as unique in all the world.\n\nThe Palio of Siena is indeed an impassioned local festival,\n\nbut it is not to be mistaken for some sort of pageant\n\nperformed for tourists. Everything that transpires on the tuff in\n\nthe Piazza del Campo has a precise significance, a clear\n\nimportance that is profoundly felt and evident in the\n\nsolemnity of the ancient rites which the Sienese have proudly\n\npassed down from generation to generation.\n\nThe anthropologist Alessandro Falassiâs seminal essay\n\ntreats the reader to an authentic image of the Palio. It is\n\ncomplemented by a series of photographs which illustrate the\n\npreparations that precede the races of July 2nd and August\n\n16th and the elaborate arrangements carried out by the city\n\ncouncil. Also included are informative profiles on each of the\n\n17 Contrade to identify the protagonists of the festival,\n\nfollowed by a selection of comments dedicated to the Palio\n\nfrom celebrated figures and numerous Sienese people.\n\nThe purpose behind this latest edition, with these new\n\nimages and citations, is to clearly outline the implications and\n\nnuances behind this trademark event of a city where identity\n\nis not merely an abstract concept, but rather a highly regarded\n\nprecious possession.\n\nP\n\nP:08\n\nA Municipality,\n\na Festival and a City\n\nP:09\n\n8 uite when\n\ndid the Palio\n\nbegin? The\n\nquestion appears\n\nevery summer in\n\nthe thoughts of all\n\nSienese. If no precise date exists, an answer still can be found: the Palio is as old\n\nas Siena, running through the cityâs\n\nmyths, legends, and history. Over the\n\ncenturies it came to be the distinctive element of the city, many would say to the\n\npoint of becoming the fourth dimension\n\nof the cityâs reality, the indispensable,\n\nthe primary mechanism moulding the\n\ncity, giving meaning to all that the city is\n\nand does. The Contrada shapes the\n\nstrong social identity of the Sienese and\n\nthe Palio gives them a model of how\n\nthings are to be done. Even in politics,\n\nsays a local proverb, the Palio is run all\n\nyear long.\n\nSiena was an Etruscan city, modest but\n\nwell-connected to the major centers of\n\nEtruria: Fiesole and Chiusi, Cortona and\n\nVolterra. Many have pointed out fascinating analogies between the first Palios\n\nand the equestrian games of the Etruscans and earlier still of the Greeks. In\n\nPoggio Civitate, not far from Siena, there\n\nis a fragment of pediment, from the 6th\n\ncentury b.c., showing a series of horsemen lined up, riding bareback like todayâs jockeys and, like their modern\n\nMyths, Legends, and the\n\nLinear Palio (1000-1300)\n\ncounterparts, they are equiped with riding crops and hats, all set to run their\n\nEtruscan Palio.\n\nAnother myth of the raceâs origins â favoring Siena as born from the rib of\n\nRome and founded by the fugitive sons\n\nof Remus â depicts those men reaching\n\nthe fateful place after a great race,\n\nchased by the horsemen of Romulus.\n\nSenio and Aschio thus founded Siena at\n\nthe end of a mythic âlinear Palio.â The\n\ninsignia of the new city was to be white\n\nand black after their horses and the\n\nclouds of smoke that rose from the two\n\nsites where they offered their sacrifices to\n\nthe gods.\n\nThe Balzana (the old Roman insignia in\n\nblack and white) remained the Coat of\n\nArms of Siena, perhaps because, as Geno\n\nPampaloni wrote, it is the perfect symbol\n\nof the extreme character of the city. It\n\nseems the irreducible opposition of white\n\nand black, yet the Balzana in fact presents the fusion of all colors in the white\n\nand their absolute absence in the black. The Madonna of the Vow (XIII c.), in the Cathedral of Siena, even\n\ntoday receives the homages of the Contrade and of the city\n\nQ\n\nP:10\n\n9\n\nThe same is true of the Palio: the\n\nBalzana is omnipresent as the insignia\n\nof the Municipality and as a sign of everything, reductio ad unum of the agreeable disagreement, of the seeming harmony between between Contrade\n\nwhich, with their individual colors and\n\nflags, are divided and oppose each other, set themselves apart and clash. But\n\nthey refind each other and unite in the\n\nBalzana, like the Sienese people when\n\nthey are happy to run into each other\n\naway from home or when they pit themselves against the rest of the world. The\n\nobsessively black and white marbles of\n\nthe Cathedral, symbol to some of the\n\nglory and pain of the Madonna, render\n\nthe building a kind of âsacred Balzana,â\n\nand thus the appropriate setting for the\n\noffering of candles, the benediction of\n\nthe Palio banner, the Te Deum of victory, for the most intense and tumultuous\n\nmoments of popular religiousness,\n\nwhich may be archaic in form, but fully\n\nheartfelt as an indispensable and evercurrent part of the Palio rites.\n\nIt was in the church-square of the black\n\nand white New Cathedral in the 1200s\n\nthat the insignia of the City-State was\n\nplaced to mark the finish line of the race\n\nof the barb horses, the linear Palio which\n\nin previous centuries had been run\n\nthrough the tortuous city streets all the\n\nway to the old Cathedral, dedicated to\n\nSan Boniface, as recorded in documents\n\nfrom the 11th century. When Siena became one of the richest and most cultured cities in Medieval Europe, the\n\nPalio was the sporting event and culminating moment that crowned and concluded the spendid annual festivals in\n\nhonor of Our Lady of August, Virgin\n\nMary of the Assumption, queen and patron of Siena and of its State. To her was\n\nthe city dedicated and entrusted. The\n\nkeys of the city were offered to her in the\n\nmost critical moments of the cityâs history, from the eve of the Battle of Monta- The Mayor Luigi De Mossi, on March 15th 2020, offered the keys of the city to the Madonna of the Vow asking her to\n\nprotect Siena from the Covid-19 pandemic. This international emergency saw the cancellation, in the same year, of\n\nthe Palio on July 2nd and on August 16th, an event that has never occurred since World War II.\n\nP:11\n\n10 perti in 1260 to passage of the Front in\n\n1944, and in 2020 because of the Covid19 pandemic.\n\nFor the Festival of the Assumption Siena\n\nbecame an âopen city.â Arrests were suspended; exiles could return and freely\n\nwalk the town; goods and livestock\n\npoured into the marketplace; streets\n\ncame alive with musicians and minstrels, mimes and jesters who entertained the crowds; acrobats and strongmen, teeth-pullers and healers, trinketsellers and harlots, wine-merchants and\n\nvendors offered their wares and their\n\nservices. The city displayed tapestries\n\nand flags, decorations, festoons and\n\ngarlands: in 1329 the City-State ordered\n\n600 of these to be made. In 1378 monies\n\nwere spent on fireworks, then considered a marvel.\n\nThe culmination was the offering of candles and tributes in the Cathedral, a religious and political rite, an act of\n\nSienese devotion to the Madonna and\n\nof subordination to the vicars, the leaders of the City-State. The collective oath\n\nof allegiance was its own precise ritual:\n\na scroll from 1200 describes it, referring\n\nto an article in an older statute, since\n\nlost. The quantity of fine waxen tributes\n\nto be offered varied according the importance of whoever made the offering,\n\nbut all citizens (from 18 to 70 years old)\n\nwere dutibound to make offerings, as\n\nwere all institutions of Siena and its\n\nState, most notably the Municipality\n\nwhich offered a gold-leafed and painted\n\ncandle, as it does today. In the years of\n\nthe greatest splendor, the Sienese who\n\npacked the Cathedral watched as, before their Madonna to whom vows were\n\noffered, there kneeled former enemies,\n\nnow become fellow citizens: the Counts\n\nof Scialenga and the Counts Gherardesca, the wise Aldobrandeschi and\n\nthe Guidi, legendary warriors. The wax\n\nthat the workers of the Catherdral\n\namassed beneath the dome reached a\n\nAccording to tradition, the two poles inside the Cathedral are\n\nthose of the Florentine Carroccio wagon of Montaperti\n\nP:12\n\n11\n\nweight of 30,000 lbs.,then redistributed\n\nto the small churches and parishes of the\n\ndiocese, representing the ancient\n\nparadigm of the ritual donation, with\n\nthe symbolic obligations of giving, receiving, and reciprocating. In the words\n\nof a saying much cherished by Boccaccio, âThe Church is like the sea, from everyone it takes and to everyone it gives.â\n\nThe Municipality played an analogous\n\nrole in the secular aspects of the festival.\n\nPrisoners to be freed from the dungeons\n\nwere drawn by lot, as were the names of\n\nvirtuous and needy maidens whose\n\ndowries were provided for âat the public\n\nexpense.â Public reconciliations between\n\nfactions and families gave relief to feuds\n\namong the citizenry. Food and drink\n\nwas provided for all. In the act of submission of Montelaterone (1205), the\n\nMunicipality committed itself to giving\n\nvictuals to anyone who brought a tribute\n\nof fine wax to Siena. This was the first\n\ndocumentation of the custom that was\n\nto continue in the banquet offered by\n\nthe Signoria and today in the dinners on\n\nthe eve of the Palio sumptuously laid out\n\non the streets for thousands of celebrants. In the period of the âculture of\n\nhungerâ â experienced by even the most\n\nsplendid cities such as Siena â the festival was a moment of liberation from the\n\nstrict daily rations of bread and wine.\n\nThe city found, gave, and abounded in\n\nfood and drink for everyone, wines and\n\nmeats, cookies and blancmanges, the\n\nprecursors of cavallucci and riccarelli,\n\ncopate and panforti, the Sienese delicacies of today.\n\nTo organize the Palio the Municipality\n\nannually nominated the Deputees of the\n\nFestival, mentioned in records from the\n\n1300s with tasks and status greater than\n\nthose of today. Running in the Palio\n\nwere the nobles and notables on their\n\nbattle-horses: the medieval games were\n\nmimed battles, training for war. The linear track ran from outside the walls all\n\nthe way to the Cathedral, from the outlying fields to the streets, over muddy\n\nroads like Pantaneto to the marble of\n\nthe Cathedral, from the country to the\n\nThe linear Palio at the Chiasso Largo (print from the XVIII c.)\n\nP:13\n\n12 city. The prize was the Pallium, a long\n\npiece of precious cloth, sometimes\n\nstitched in vertical bands, stuffed with\n\nhundreds of vaio fur pelts. The Pallium\n\nlater gave its name to the race and then\n\nto the festival. This linguistic fact underlines a tie between sign and context,\n\nsymbol and ceremony, meaning and\n\nthe meaningful.\n\nFrom the start the race was sensational\n\nand dramatic, full of accidents and\n\nevents.\n\nThe oldest document recording the\n\nPalio, from 1238, deals with Palio justice.\n\nA fine of 40 farthings was to be paid to\n\nRistoro di Bruno Ciguarde because ârunning in the Palio and having arrived last,\n\nhe did not take the pig, the derisory prize\n\nassigned by the regulation to the most\n\nlosing of all the losersâ (at that time, last\n\nplace; today, 2nd place). Such a âpurgeâ\n\nhelped define victory and defeat, establishing hierarchies ofwinners and losers,\n\ndictating the symbolic order of homo ludens.\n\nAnother sign of the times lies in the Constitution of 1262, in which it is decreed\n\nthat the qui current eques, the participants of the Palio, the noble jockeys of\n\nthat era, could not be prosecuted for homocide or injury occurring during the\n\nrace, because âpredicta maleficia non\n\ncommitterint studioseâ â âthey didnât do\n\nit on purpose.â What was asked of jockeys was above all a theatrical show of\n\nhonesty.\n\nThese first Palios were an affair of the\n\nnoblemen. The Contrade participated,\n\ninstead, in the crude games in which\n\nmasses of contestants opposed each\n\nother on the basis of territory (eg.,La CittÃ against Camollia and S. Martino).\n\nSiena was born plural, on three hills. The\n\nthree primeval castles expanded into\n\nThirds (CittÃ , Camollia, S. Martino)\n\ngrowing until they met and almost dictated the site of the Campus Fori, the Piazza del Campo. The Contrade grew up\n\nwithin this 3-way partitioning, an Indoeuropean matrix there since the Etruscans and which in Siena stubbornly\n\nrefused the 4-way partitioning laid out\n\neverywhere by the Romans.\n\nThe oldest documentation of the ConThe Palio of the Etruscans, coroplast of the 6th century BC, from Poggio Civitate (Siena)\n\nP:14\n\n13\n\ntrade lies in the regulations of 1200, prescribing that all citizens were to bring a\n\ncandle to the Catherdral cum hominibus\n\nsue contrate.\n\nHistorian Andrea Dei affirms that the\n\nSienese âbegan to create companies in\n\nthe city of the Contradeâ in 1209. Contrada originally meant âa main inhabited street,â then âneighborhood,â and finally the association of a districtâs inhabitants.\n\nGiovanni Cecchini, authoritative writer\n\non Palio historiography, notes, âthe Contrada, as a territorial and administrative\n\ndistrict, is as old as the city itself.â E.\n\nWilliam Heywood, an important Palio\n\nhistorian, adds, âFor the past 400 years\n\nthe Contrade have been the distinguishing characteristic of life in Siena, the\n\nequivalent of which can be found in no\n\nother Italian city.â\n\nThe Contrade used to be far more numerous. After the Plague of 1347, their\n\nnumber was reduced to 42. They took\n\ntheir names from streets, gates, fountains, churches or illustrious families\n\nwithin their territories. They fulfilled religious, administrative, military, and\n\nrecreational functions. The head of the\n\nContrada was the Sindaco, the Mayor,\n\nwho was directly answerable to the\n\nPodestÃ , aided by popularly elected\n\ncounsellors. The Contrada was subject\n\nto taxes, it ran its own police force, saw\n\nto the upkeep of streets, and carried out\n\nother services for the public good.\n\nThe finish of the linear Palio in the Piazza del Duomo (print from the XVIII c.)\n\nP:15\n\n14 n the 1400s ever\n\nmore frequent,\n\nconsistent\n\nrecords report the\n\nmodern na mes of\n\nthe Contrade, which\n\nbegan to appear in the public festivities\n\nand to take part in the ritual games with\n\ngroups of men in livery.\n\nLe pugna was a kind of collective boxing\n\nmatch with hundreds of contestants, the\n\nheir of gladiatorial games and forerunner\n\nof modern boxing. In Siena this game was\n\nin vogue during the low Middle Ages, often banned because of the deaths and riots it regularly provoked.\n\nIn the pugna recorded by Gentile Sermini\n\nin a short story dating back to 1424, written in a style that antipicated live newsreporting, readers learn of the groupings\n\nof the Snail, of the Giraffe, and of the Val\n\ndi Piatta (the modern day Forest). In the\n\npugna games of 1494, mentioned in the\n\nChronicles of Allegretto Allegretti, written\n\nin honor of the Cardinal of San MalÃ²âs visit\n\nto Siena, participating groups included the\n\nSnail, the Dragon, the Giraffe, the Wave,\n\nand Camollia (todayâs Porcupine). The\n\ngame went on for a long time. In the 1800s\n\nNiccolÃ² Tommaseo defined pugilism as âa\n\ngame played in the style of pugna: much\n\nused among the Greeks and carried on up\n\nuntil the recent years among the Sienese.â\n\nFrom the pugna arose the theatrical yet\n\nvirulent pugnacity that lives on today.\n\nLe cacce, âthe hunts,â marked the entry of\n\nthe costumed representatives of the Contrada in the Piazza, along with allegorical\n\nfloats of exotic or imaginary animals, symbolizing mythic events or noble virtues. In\n\nthe transition from the 1400s to the 1500s,\n\nthe Contrade completed the fantastic\n\nmenagerie from which they took their emblems. Lacking precise records, one can\n\nhypothesize a spontaneous process by\n\nwhich Contrade came together to construct the machines. The Contrade, chose\n\ntheir emblematic animals from the\n\nheraldic repertory in vogue in Siena and\n\nthroughout Italy, using ideas and symbols\n\nfrom the crests of kings and nobles, of\n\nmercenary companies, of the arts and\n\nprofessions, of towns and cities, or from\n\nMedieval âbestiaries,â like those of Brunetto Latini.\n\nOne might reconstruct and hypothesize for\n\nThe Renaissance:\n\nFloats, Symbols, and\n\nColors (1400-1500)\n\nThe oldest source and print of the Palio: It is an anonymous\n\naccount in verse of the August festival of 1506. Siena, Library of\n\nthe Intronati\n\nI\n\nP:16\n\n15\n\neach Contrada a path and process that is\n\nindividual and different from all others.\n\nFor example, the enterprise of the Borghesi was perhaps the source for that of the\n\nDragon Contrada, the enterprise of the\n\nMarescotti for the Eagle Contrada.\n\nIn the case of the Caterpillar, the symbol\n\nis that of the art of the silk-makers, as documented in 1370. As for the Panther, historians have hypothesized a possible direct link with the presence in Siena of a\n\ncolony of silk-makers from Lucca. And in\n\nthe case of the Porcupine, composed of\n\nthe men of Camollia, it is very possible to\n\nimagine a derivation from the emblem of\n\nthe Ricci (literally âhedgehogâ) family, or\n\nfrom the emblem of King Louis XII of\n\nFrance.\n\nAllegorical floats could be found in many\n\ncities. In nearby Florence, for example, a\n\nhunting procession included a wooden Giraffe-shaped machine, and in 1514 floats\n\nwere to be seen in the shapes of a Porcupine and of a Tortoise.\n\nThese machines, with various men inside, served to frighten and to rouse the\n\nanimals, and were used as shelters by the\n\nhunters who poked the animals from\n\ninside with spears around the Piazza, to\n\ncreate the impression that the wooden\n\npredators did battle with the real ones;\n\ntotem against ferocity, myth against\n\nreality.\n\nIn Siena in 1482, according to the Histories of the erudite prelate Sigismondo\n\nTizio, the inhabitants of San Marco built\n\na Snail-shaped float and those of San\n\nPietro a Ovile a machine in the shape of\n\na Giraffe.\n\nIn 1506 the Eagle Contrada, the Snail, the\n\nDragon, the Giraffe, the Porcupine, the Lionphant (todayâs Tower), the Ram, the\n\nShell, the Goose, the Wave, and the Forest, each with its costumed representatives, took part in âhunting processionâ in\n\nthe Piazza del Campo held for the feast of\n\nOur Lady. In 1546, in the report on the\n\nfeast of the Assumption drawn up and\n\nprinted by Cecchino Chartaio, all 17 of todayâs Contrade are named: the Eagle, the\n\nCaterpillar, the Snail, the Owl, the Dragon,\n\nthe Giraffe, the Porcupine, the Unicorn,\n\nthe She-Wolf, the Shell, the Goose, the\n\nWave, the Panther, the Forest, the Tortoise, the Tower, and the Ram.\n\nTheir symbols were the same then as now.\n\nTheir colors were to undergo a longer,\n\nmore complex evolution. The Eagle and\n\nthe Snail came out in 1546 with their present colors (but they were to vary occasionally); 5 other Contrade took on their\n\nThe machine and the costumed representatives of the\n\nPorcupine at the bull-hunt (det. by Vincenzo Rustici, XVI c.).\n\nSiena, Headquarters of the Monte dei Paschi Bank\n\nThe machine and the costumed representatives of the Tower at\n\nthe bull-hunt (det. by Vincenzo Rustici, XVI c.).

Over the\n\ncenturies, all changed their borders and\n\ngeometrical figures, their stripes and\n\narabesques, proving that nothing about\n\nthe Palio is ever unchanging.\n\nThe City-State had its own float as far\n\nback as the 14th century. The âWagon of\n\nthe Angelsâ was a machine holding up\n\nyouths dressed as angels, and a complicated system of ropes and pulleys made\n\nthem rise and fall around an image of the\n\nMadonna. A receipt from 1406 documents\n\n36 farthings spent on the oranges the\n\nyouths threw to the crowd as good-luck\n\nprojectiles. On the Wagon of the Angels,\n\nand later on the Carroccio wagon, the\n\nPalio was carried, mounted on a painted\n\npole topped by a silver lion.\n\nThe precious fabric of the âGreat Bannerâ\n\noften came from elsewhere, from Florence\n\nor Lucca, from Bologna or Venice. To stuff\n\nthe 1430 Palio with silk rosado, 18 âSienese\n\narmsâ long (13.42 meters), with fringe and\n\nbands of silk and gold, 1,400 vaio pelts\n\nwere needed. In 1447 the Palio was made\n\nof crimson velvet, and 30 âarmsâ (22.38\n\nmeters) were purchased.\n\nThe Great Banners of this period are no\n\nlonger in existence because, unlike those\n\nof today, they were functional, not merely\n\nsymbolic, prizes. As a rule, they were used\n\nto make altar cloths, canopies, tapestries,\n\nand sacred vestments, yet one may suppose that they ended up being worn by\n\nthe winners and by their earthly madonnas, who often in the days of the Palio\n\nwore precious stones and dresses of silk\n\nand velvet, making show of the luxury\n\nwhich ordinarly the sumptuary laws of the\n\nRepublic did not allow. The days of the\n\nPalio were world events: to the city came\n\nthe great names of Italyâs born and moneyed aristocracy, high prelates, and\n\ncrowned heads of Europe (such as Emperor Sigmund who attended the 1432\n\nPalio), the Borgias, Gonzagas, Medicis,\n\nMalatestas, the Marquises of Mantua, the Vincenzo Rustici: The Costumed Representatives of the Contrade at the Bu\n\nP:18\n\n17\n\null-Hunt in the Piazza del Campo (XVI c.). Siena, Headquarters of the Monte dei Paschi Bank\n\nP:19\n\n18\n\nlords of Milan. Since the lords no longer\n\nparticipated personally in wartime battles\n\n(that work being delegated to mercenaries), they stopped running in the Palio,\n\ndelegating the job to the jockeys. the Palio\n\nbecame for them a spectacle to be seen,\n\nthe race an event to which they invited\n\ntheir racers and their color-bearers, putti\n\nor ragatii (âkidsâ) with nicknames as picturesque as their blouses.\n\nRunning in the 1461 Palio were the rowdy\n\nyouths called Paganinus Pagani of Romania, Furaboscus of Cremona, Fallatutti\n\nFactinnanzi of Schiavonia, Tremalmondo\n\nof Ferraria, Setacchiappo Barilis of Montefiascone, Fiascus Barilis of Montefiascone.\n\nIn 1492 the jockey of Cesare Borgia made\n\na false start in the race and the Municipality awarded the Palio to the Marquis of\n\nMantua. In 1514 Muccia Farasche won the\n\nPalio for his illustrious and bizarre patron\n\nSodoma, riding a dark horse that was\n\nâdecorated Turkish-style on its flanks and\n\non its head.â The other horses were two\n\nbrown sorrels, a black roan, 2 bays and 2\n\ngreys.\n\nBut history stepped in to deal with Siena.\n\nIn 1559, after a desperate and memorable\n\nwar of siege, with a Government in exile\n\nin Montalcino, Siena received a condemning sentence with no chance of appeal\n\nfrom the tractate of Cateau-CambrÃ©sis,\n\nwhich gave a new territorial map to Europe.\n\nSiena was reduced to a province of the\n\nGranduchy which, moreover, had its capital in the ever-unpopular Florence; Siena\n\nwas no longer the master of its own fate,\n\nbut was to be steered by Florence until the\n\nRisorgimento.\n\nThe festivities of mid-August, apart from\n\nthe religious component, suddenly lost\n\ntheir political meaning of triumph for the\n\ncity. Instead of receiving the annual\n\nhomage from all lands and castles, from\n\ncities, hamlets and lords for the feast of its\n\nMadonna, Siena was forced to pay yearly\n\nhomage to St John of the Florentines, in\n\na ceremony that Siena knew well, having\n\nbeen on the receiving end. Thus with a\n\nbrusque âdesemanticizing and resemanticizing,â a turn-around of meanings, the\n\nfeast was no more a celebration of the\n\npresent but a reminder of the past â history and memory, dream and nostalgia\n\nfor the golden age when Siena had been\n\nfree, independent, and sovereign.\n\nPerhaps it is from this end of the great\n\nfeast that there arose, in the second half\n\nof the 1500s, the teeming festivities and\n\ngames and neighborhood Palios which\n\nstrengthened the invisible walls of the\n\nContrade, making them definitively cities\n\nwithin the city, guardians of memories\n\nand traditions of a city that turned its back\n\non history and closed itself within itself.\n\nA probing example: the summer feast of\n\n1581. Sienaâs Governor, Federigo di Montuato, wrote to Florence, âalmost all the\n\nContrade wanted to run their own Palio,\n\nsome with horses, others with mares, others with mules... others with water buffaloes like the Roman custom.â\n\nThe courtiers and costumed representatives were rich in whims, fables, stories,\n\naccompanied by lovely music and ingenious printed poems. The feasts included\n\nthe dramatic presence of the maiden Virginia, a country girl who ran in the Palio\n\n(finishing 3rd) charming all with her grace\n\nand skill; Montuato gifted her a horse. The\n\nriotous joy was shared by all: âAfter the\n\nrunning of the Palios, the winners go\n\naround in triumph before everyone, visiting the most ancient Contrade, almost\n\nholding court decked with wines and tables.â The Contrade paid dowries for\n\nneedy maidens and freed prisoners from\n\nthe dungeons, as the Municipality had\n\ndone in the August festivities in the days\n\nof the Republic.\n\nBelow: The Costumed Representatives of the Contrade in the\n\nPiazza del Campo (det. by Vincenzo Rustici, XVI c.). Siena,\n\nHeadquarters of the Monte dei Paschi Bank\n\nP:21\n\n20 Il Seicento:\n\nil Palio in Piazza\n\now in the first\n\nde cades of the\n\n1600s the Palio\n\nconcluded its transfer to the Piazza del\n\nCam po and its tran -\n\nsfor mation into a popular festival. The\n\nproposal of running the Palio in the Piazza\n\nwas officially made to the Municipality on\n\n11 July 1695 by the Deputies of the Festival\n\nfor the August Palio, Captain Sigismondo\n\nSanti and Knight Fortunio Martini. Various reasons supported the proposal: the\n\nPalio with horses running through the\n\nstreets was dangerous and it was impossible to enjoy the entire spectacle. In the\n\nPiazza, instead, âeveryone could see everything at once in a bigger space for as\n\nlong as it lasts.â The length of the race in\n\nthe Piazza had to be equal to the distance\n\nfrom the Santuccio to the Cathedral,\n\nequal to what the length had always\n\nbeen. And if the Palio were to be run not\n\nby private people but by Contrade (as was\n\nalready happening in neighborhood festivals), then the banner and the other\n\nprizes would remain in Siena. âThe Palio\n\nstaying in the city, donations would be\n\nmade to the churches and to sacred\n\nplaces, as always used to be made by the\n\nContrade, when they won in similar\n\nraces.â Beyond the increased spectacle,\n\nthere would be a tangible increase of cultural goods for the city.\n\nThe idea immediately caused a breach\n\namong the Sienese. After other races in\n\nthe Piazza of uncertain documentation,\n\nthe 1632 print of Bernardino Capitelli\n\ngives a clear date and sure proof of a circular Palio run in the Piazza. In the image, the jockeys ride bareback; they are\n\nat the finish of the race and are exchanging furious blows with the sovatto, a kind\n\nof cat-oâ-nine-tails with a handle in the\n\nshape of an animal paw, half-weapon,\n\nhalf-amulet. In the Piazza the Contrada\n\nmembers greet the victory, jumping\n\ndown from the stands; the Masters of the\n\nField rush on horseback to keep order.\n\nThe circular Palio was run in the Piazza\n\nwith ever-greater frequency, yet until the\n\nmiddle of the century it coexisted with\n\nthe water-buffalo race popular in Siena\n\nand in all of Italy. Then in 1597 the Council of Trent launched its lightning bolts\n\nagainst the bull-hunts and other public\n\ngames not so much because they were violent as because they were throwbacks to\n\npagan rites (Dionysian and Bacchic)\n\nwhich the Council sought to remove from\n\nItalian customs once and for all.\n\nThe water-buffalo races had been run in\n\na circle around the Piazza. Presented by\n\nN\n\nTablet of Ownership (1693). Siena, Contrada of Tortoise\n\nP:22\n\n21\n\nthe Contrade, the buffaloes were escorted by 12 goaders, armed with a long nailstudded staff. No one can be sure if these\n\nwere used to prod the Contradeâs own\n\nwater-buffalo or to poke the animals and\n\ngoaders of the rivals. The race, which\n\nlasted for 3 laps of the Piazza, started at\n\nthe Vicolo S. Paolo, and the start was\n\nmarked by a trumpet blast.\n\nImmense and heartfelt was the participation of the Contrade, even in the coarse\n\ndonkey races which, on occasion, were\n\nheld in the Piazza with a carnival-like atmosphere and a heated fighting spirit,\n\nrun between donkeys painted in Contrada colors, pushed around the Piazza by\n\nContrada members, while the donkeys of\n\nrival Contrade were subject to being\n\npushed out of the track by every conceivable means.\n\nIn the end, in 1656, the Palio around the\n\nPiazza took on its definitive form, uniting\n\nthe passions of the populace with those\n\nof the nobility. Add to this the final element that had been missing, in a city\n\nwith such ignited mysticism: the dedication to the Madonna. Not the Madonna\n\nof the Assumption, but to the Miraculous\n\nMadonna of the Trench, venerated for\n\nthe graces received and for miraculous\n\nhealings in the then infamous and lively\n\nProvenzano, the district inhabited by\n\nSpanish soldiery and by the prostitutes\n\nwho gravitated around them.\n\nThe cult grew to great proportions when\n\nthe story circulated of a drunken Spanish\n\nsoldier who wanted to fire his harquebus\n\nat the sacred image; the harquebus exploded, instantly killing the sacrilegous\n\nmiscreant. The festival pertaining to the\n\ngrand church, which had been raised\n\nwith unusual speed to house the sacred\n\nimage, suddenly became the concern of\n\nits neighborhood and of the entire city;\n\nfrom 1656 onward the Miraculous\n\nMadonna of Provenzano had its own\n\npopular Palio, which was run in the Piazza del Campo by the Contrade, as a conclusion to the annual liturgical feast.\n\nThe Palio of Provenzano immediately\n\ntook on a set form: from 1659 onwards it\n\nwas organized directly by the Biccherna,\n\nthe office of the magistrature that had the\n\ntask of organizing ceremonies pertaining\n\nto civic continuity and representativeness. Supervision of the festival was\n\nthe duty of the three âLords of\n\nthe Merriment,â who offered\n\n90 thalers as a prize to the\n\nwinning Contrada. One\n\nmight assume they\n\npaid also to have their\n\nfamily crests placed on\n\nthe Great Banner.\n\nIn 1657 the chronicler\n\nFlaminio Rossi wrote,\n\nâIt was the first Great\n\nBanner with the image of\n\nthe Holy Virgin of Provenzano, and the three noble\n\ncoats of arms of the Lords of the\n\nFestival.â\n\nThe jockeys were mercenaries from the\n\nstart. They were the well-equiped horsemen who had competed in the tumult of\n\nMasgalano in chiselled and embossed silver, won by the\n\nTortoise Contrada, showing the rape of Europa (XVI c.).\n\nSiena, Tortoise Contrada\n\nP:23\n\n22 the water-buffalo races and who brought\n\nto the circular Palio a virulence that the\n\naristocratic linear Palio had to a much\n\nlesser degree. If in the linear race the jockeys had run essentially halfway, in these\n\ncircular races they did battle, even one\n\nagainst the other. The adolescent who\n\nhad substituted the nobleman on horseback in the ancient Palios became an\n\nambiguous senex puer of greater age,\n\nsometimes deformed and grotesque like\n\nthe dwarves who in other cities fought in\n\nthe terrible farsical bullfights of the\n\nBaroque period, or, clumsily, rode waterbuffaloes. Such masques lived on in\n\nmemory with crude and cruel nicknames: Stumpy, Lame, Dry Mount,\n\nEpileptic, Twisted, and an array of gobbi\n\n(hunchbacks) - Gobbo, Gobbo Chiarini,\n\nGobbo Faenzi, Gobbo of Empoli, Gobbo\n\nSaragiolo.\n\nImmediately there arose the never-to-be\n\nresolved problem of regulating the award\n\nrelating to winning jockeys. Beyond a set\n\npayment, jockeys received the power to\n\nrequest bonuses from the victorious Contrada. The request is recorded for 1657,\n\nwhereas after the victory of 1666 the\n\nWave brought into its assembly the jockey Domenico of Barberino and invited\n\nhim to choose between a payment of 10\n\nscudi as final settlement or 40 lira plus\n\ntips. The jockey chose the latter, which\n\nwas voted upon and passed by 20 white\n\nballs among 20 voters.\n\nIn the first circular Palios inside the Piazza, the Contrade had to find their own\n\nhorses, but to keep the chances of winning more even, from 2 July 1676 onward\n\nthe Contrade each presented a horse,\n\nand the horses were then assigned by a\n\ndrawing. In 1657 it was determined that\n\njockeys would ride âalla bisdossa,â bareback, and that the victorious horse would\n\nfollow its jockey into the Church of\n\nProvenzano for the Te Deum of thanksgiving, soon to become a hymn to the\n\nMadonna, over the centuries screamed\n\nContrada of the Snail: the oldest book of articles (1663)\n\nP:24\n\n23\n\nout in unison with only approximative\n\nwords (Maria Mater Grazie, and so on).\n\nIn the 1800s the very cultured Abbot Giuliani wrote that he had been scandalized\n\nby listening without having understood\n\nâa single healthy word.â\n\nIn 1666 the College of BalÃ¬a deliberated\n\nthat on the Eve of the Assumption, for\n\nthe linear Palio, the horsemen should\n\nbring the barb horses to have them\n\nblessed at the portals of the Cathedral.\n\nThose that ran in the circular race came\n\nto be blessed within the churches of the\n\nindividual Contrade in a ceremony which\n\nto many seems superstitious and pagan,\n\nbut which instead perpetuates a very\n\nChristian ritual, the beneditio equorum et\n\nanimalium of the Church since its first\n\ncenturies.\n\nThe same period saw the rise of theâtrattaâ (from trahere or tirare a sorte, meaning to âto be drawn by chanceâ). The random drawing for the assignment of horses to the Contrade took place on the\n\ngreen of Camollia, outside the city walls.\n\nAfter a trial race from the Palazzo Diavoli\n\nto the Church of San Bernardino at the\n\nAntegate, the first horse received an\n\naward of a testone, but was discarded,\n\nas was the last to arrive.\n\nThus was born the custom, still very\n\nmuch alive today, of selecting an equally\n\nmatched horse-race. The Drawing immediately took on great importance because\n\nin that period the order of assignment of\n\nthe horses also determined the order of\n\nthe entrance in the Piazza of the groups\n\nof costumed Contrade representatives in\n\nthe procession before the race, and indeed the order of the line-up at the raceâs\n\nstarting rope.\n\nFrom the first codification of its regulations, the Palio embodied its endemic\n\npassion for chance.\n\nIn 1682 it was established that the Contrade had to pay a âvettura,â literally a\n\nâcarriage,â to each horse-owner in exchange for use of the horse; in 1698 they\n\nhad to repay owners for injuries to horses\n\noccurring during the Trials (today called\n\nthe âprove,â called the âcomproveâ back\n\nthen) run at various hours throughout\n\nthe day in the Piazza, which was covered\n\nwith earth that year several days before\n\nthe Palio.\n\nAs of 1685, the Contrade were obliged to\n\nrun the Palio even if they had a poor\n\nhorse. Participation became an honor\n\nand a civic obligation.\n\nThe Contrade, too, underwent their own\n\nprocess of evolution. On the one hand\n\nthey began to give themselves statutory\n\narticles, or in other words true written\n\nconstitutions, and on the other they became clearly differentiated from the miliatry companies (with which at times they\n\nhad been confused), furthermore distancing themselves also from the laymenâs companies with which they had\n\nonce lived in a symbiosis that eventually\n\nproved uncomfortable.\n\nFor example, the brothers and sisters of\n\nTablet of Ownership (1693). Siena, Snail Contrada\n\nP:25\n\n24 the laymenâs company of St Catherine in\n\nFontebranda, which held devotional and\n\nsocial services within the neighborhood\n\nas its aims, were also members of the\n\nContrada of the Goose, the elected head\n\nof which, the Governor, assumed the title\n\nof Prior of the Companies, and the articles of the Companies were the same as\n\nthose of the Contrada. In 1600 the Goose\n\nsuddenly broke away altogether from the\n\nCompany which remained within the domain of the Domenicans. Disagreements\n\narose over guardianship of the relics of St\n\nCatherine (the âSacred Headâ). The disgreements grew into the Gooseâs attempt\n\nto seize the relics with great furor among\n\nthe people during a procession for the\n\nFeast of St Catherine in May of 1609.\n\nThe first circular Palios were not short of\n\ndrama and discord. Prince Mattias dei\n\nMedici, a great lover of horses, was made\n\npromoter of the Palio and occasionally\n\njudge of the victory, not without several\n\nclamorous errors of judgment. In 1664,\n\nduring a Palio that was considerably\n\nâheated,â the She-Wolf set off in first with\n\nthe jockey Bacchino, who fell in the 3rd\n\nlap; the horse continued and won. But,\n\nas one chronicler wrote, âthe Owl Contrada, for whom Mone was running, having\n\ncome in second was awarded the Palio\n\nbecause so decided the imbecile Principe\n\nMattias.â\n\nThe chronicler explained the insult,\n\nâsince good sense says that itâs the horse\n\nwho wins, not the jockey.â\n\nThe rule of good sense was soon to become official after 3 centuries of controversy. Ever since, it is the horse who wins,\n\nwith or without a jockey on its back. And\n\na barb who wins âscosso,â âriderless,â is to\n\nthe people of Siena the surest, most\n\nbeautiful sign of fate and of joy.\n\nThe oldest image of the circular Palio, etched in 1632 by Bernardino Capite\n\nP:26\n\n25\n\ntelli. Siena, Library of the Intronati\n\nP:27\n\n26 he century of\n\nthe Enlightenment ope -\n\nned with the introduction of a second\n\nPalio of the Contrade besides the Palio alla lunga, or linear Palio, continuing to take place on15\n\nAugust. Already the linear Palio had\n\nbeen unseated in the hearts of the\n\nSienese by the circular race, with its intimate theatricality.\n\nThe idea came from the Goose Contrada, winner of the Palio of July, 1701.\n\nThe Goose asked to ârerun the Palio\n\nwon,â to put the victory up for grabs, calling for another race to be run on 16 August for the Feast of the Assumption.\n\nThe ancient charm of the Feasts during\n\nwhich the Sienese summer reached its\n\nzenith, the wish to give the Festivials new\n\nvital blood, the Contradeâs desire to be\n\nmore central in the holiday and in its organization, the proud ambition of a great\n\npeople to declare itself primus inter pares\n\nby means of a gesture, a gift, an idea, all\n\nset the scene for the August Palio to begin its history. The Goose made available\n\nthe 60 thalers it had won in money, 20\n\nfor expenses and 40 as a prize for the\n\nwinning Contrada.\n\nAt the beginning the process was spontaneous, and if Julyâs winner did not wish\n\nto rerun the Palio, there was always anThe 1700s:\n\nthe Proclamation of\n\nViolante\n\nand the Rules\n\nof the Modern Palio\n\nother Contrada eager to step in as substitute with generosity and perhaps a\n\nhint of contentious emulation. When in\n\n1747 the Goose declined, the Tower offered itself as substitute; in 1750, the entire citizenry opted to pay the expenses\n\nby general collection.\n\nIn 1774 the Municipality ratified the organization of the two Palios.\n\nThe Palio also took on its definitive regulations.

One of many proofs of this is the\n\ndocument with which the ecclesiastical\n\nauthority conceded the use of the Church\n\nof the Giraffe, advising that ââ¦above all,\n\nin the case of meetings, there shall not be\n\nin the abovementioned chapel any tumults and so forth as often happens in\n\nsuch occasions.â Almost in response,\n\nmany Contrade formed the habit of covering sacred images during meetings in\n\nthe church, âso they wouldnât see and\n\nthey wouldnât hearâ what went on in the\n\ntumultuous meetings called together by\n\nthe sound of the bell. In the meetings,\n\nthen as today, the common good was\n\nsought and propositions were voted on\n\nusing black and white balls, as in ancient\n\ntimes.\n\nThis form of popular, lay government, in\n\nwhich everyone participates and for\n\nwhich the Contrade have long prided\n\nthemselves, did not stop the city from\n\npaying solemn honor to visiting high\n\nprelates or crowned heads with an impromptu day-off, with pageantry, torchlit\n\nprocessions, and with an extraordinary\n\nPalio.\n\nFor the entrance of Violante of Bavaria\n\nsplendid festivities were held in 1717. The\n\nVeridico Ragguaglio, a âTrue Clarification,â illustrated and annotated recently\n\nby Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli, remains\n\na primary source to learn about the history of the Palio.\n\nIn 1739, when Francesco II passed\n\n29\n\nmemoration of the Siena that once was,\n\na âmemento moriâ like the reminders\n\nwhispered in the ears of heroes in the triumphal processions of ancient Rome.\n\nThe Eagle narrowly escaped the same\n\nfate after it had won the water-buffalo\n\nrace in 1610 and then, from 1622 onwards, was a long time absent from public spectacles in Siena.\n\nWhen in 1718 the Eagle wanted once\n\nagain to participate in the August festival, it was met by the opposition of its\n\nneighboring Contrade, the Wave, the\n\nTortoise, the Panther, and the Forest,\n\nwho had made claims to the territory\n\nand population of a Contrada dorment\n\nfor so long. The controversy went before\n\nthe Biccherna, dragging on so long as to\n\nattract the attention of the decisive Governess of Siena. Her proclamation, which\n\ntook into account also the need for demographic equilibrium, set the number\n\nand the boundaries of the 17 Contrade ,\n\nâtaking away the power to bring back old\n\nones or to create new ones.â More than\n\n250 years have passed, yet the Proclamation of Violante is still law in Siena, at\n\nleast for the territory that it covers, the\n\ncity within the walls. Made strong by this\n\ndefinitive division, the Contrade of the\n\n1700s continued their growth. Each wrote\n\nup its own articles, or constitutions, to\n\nregulate the lives of these associations.\n\nThey acquired, in perpetual rented use\n\nor in ownership, their headquarters and\n\ntheir churches, taking advantage of the\n\nelimination under Leopold of the laymenâs companies decreed between 1770\n\nand 1780.\n\nCommenting on Siena, Peter Leopold\n\nwrote a series of sober, enlightened and\n\nsharp observations: âThe city of Siena is\n\ndivided into many Contrade, each of\n\nwhich has its own Captain, insignias, and\n\nchapel, which is rarely officiated, but\n\nthese serve to say the eveningâs rosary\n\nand to deliberate on the race of the Palio.\n\nLong ago these were the places where\n\nP:31\n\n30 through Siena, an extraordinary Palio\n\nwas run, and another was dedicated to\n\nhim in 1745 when he rose to the imperial\n\nthrone. On that occasion the prize\n\nreached the exceptional amount of 60\n\nthalers. For Peter Leopold, a race was\n\nrun on the 13th of May 1767 with especially supervised and well-prepared\n\nchoreography. Together âthe Contrade\n\n[entered] the Piazza in military fashion\n\nwith pikes in hand, trimmed hats, and\n\ngarments of various colors according to\n\nthe colors of the insignia of each Contrada.â The allegories represented on the\n\nfloats were unprecented. âAlong came a\n\nvery beautiful wagon with Munificence,\n\nHappiness, Misery, festive Siena, and\n\ntwo rivers...â\n\nAn ever more attentive theatricality sent\n\ninto the Piazza, along with historic and\n\nclassical floats, new allegories dear to the\n\nEnlightenment and to its branches\n\nknown to be dear to the sovereign and to\n\nhis vision of the world: the floats became\n\nsigns of their time. In the Palio of 1786 after the Temple of Happiness (by an unfortunate choice, the Contrade not running in the race took part) the Piazza witnessed the appearance of the personifications of Religion, Science, Agriculture,\n\nand Justice. Allusive written messages\n\nrefered to the Granduchy and its cities:\n\nAncient Siena, Beautiful Florence, Powerful Livorna, Florid Pisa.\n\nIn 1791 Public Happiness paraded in the\n\nPiazza among shepherds and shepherdesses and above all Commerce improved by Peter Leopold.\n\nIn contrast to the rarefied climate of the\n\nProcession and the abstractions of its allegorical floats, the circular race occurred\n\naccording to the dictates of the roughest,\n\nmost immediate expressionistic realism.\n\nThe horses were often recruited forcibly\n\nby the Municipality which sometimes, to\n\nfind the required number, obliged all the\n\nPost Offices of the surrounding environs\n\nto send at least one to each drawing,\n\nwhich from 1761 onwards took place at\n\nthe Palazzo, at the Biccherna door.\n\nHorses and horsemen in this century\n\nwere rarely of noble origin. There was the\n\nhorse of Savino the innkeeper, the bay\n\nhorse of Signor Bagnacci, the white horse\n\nof Signor Mascagni and the brown horse\n\nof Signor Giannetti, the hatmaker in the\n\nPiazza nicknamed âthe Bomb.â\n\nThe inclusion of the jockeys in the new\n\nEnlightened choreograpy and the new\n\nsemiotic context of the Palio proved impossible, whatever steps were taken to\n\nshape them to the tastes of the time. An\n\neffort was made to oblige them to parade\n\nin full costume on the big parade horses.\n\nGiovan Battista Stratico, from the Accademia dei Rozzi, wrote in 1775 an\n\nOlympian ode to the victorious jockey. A\n\nfew years later Vittorio Alfieri brought his\n\nhorses to the Piazza and versified about\n\nBastiancino and Carnaccia. In 1793 he\n\nwrote to Siena, asking âwho is hero\n\namong the jockeys,â and the next year\n\ncomplained about his friend Bianchi,\n\nânot even after 15 August were two\n\nverses written to tell me how the festivities went? to tell me of the glories of Bastiancini, Batticuli, and the others?â\n\nThe jockeys of that era, in truth, were not\n\nthe stuff of poems and Pindaresque\n\nodes. The Contrade were already suspicious about the secret clans of jockeys\n\nthat fixed race results and divvied up the\n\nearnings, official or otherwise.\n\nAmong these clans, competition was\n\nanything but Olympian, and it appeared\n\nin riots and assaults, threats and furious\n\nfights such as those which, between 1787\n\nand 1788 set the âclan of the Sieneseâ\n\nagainst âthe clan of the Maremmansâ the\n\nhead of which was the Maremman\n\nIsidoro âDorinoâ Bianchini who won 13\n\nPalios for 9 Contrade. After clamorous\n\nreinings and furious whiplashes, with\n\nvendettas on the subsequent race,\n\nDorino, Ciocio, and the jockey for the\n\nPanther met each other at the starting\n\nP:32\n\n31\n\nrope on2 July 1778 with such forceful\n\nwhiplashes that they ended up on the\n\nground where âthey fought as if to kill\n\neach other if the civil troops hadnât separated them, throwing the jockeys of the\n\nShe-Wolf and of the Panther in jail.â The\n\njockeys were released the next day, with\n\nan injunction to leave the city immediately.\n\nBut these wars were like the fights of the\n\nproverbial thieves of Pisa. In order to\n\nstay, Dorino, perhaps the greatest of the\n\ncentury, taken by the reins by the SheWolf in 1787, ran for them the next year;\n\nwhipped until he bled by the Owl, won a\n\nPalio for them two years later; having\n\nwon the Palio for the Tortoise in 1786 he\n\nran the following year for the archrival,\n\nthe Snail, and though assaulted by the\n\nTortoise, two years later he returned to\n\nrun and win for them; solemnly whipped\n\nby the Wave in 1787, he wore their colors\n\nin 1787 and brought them a victory.\n\nThe Palio of the jockeys has always been\n\nthe anti-Olympics par excellence: winning, not participating, is what counts.\n\nYet the end of the century the Piazza del\n\nCampo witnessed events of greater\n\ndrama and violence. After the French\n\nOccupation, the reactionary squadronmobs from Arezzo reached Siena in\n\n1799, to cries of âViva Maria!â In the Piazza, upon the pieces of the destroyed\n\ntree of liberty, 10 cadavers were burned.\n\nIn July of 1799 the Palio was suspended\n\nfor reasons of public order; soon it was\n\nunderstood that to protect public order it\n\nwas riskier to ban the Palio than to let it\n\nbe run.\n\nThe Banner with its Madonna of Provenzano was assigned to the August race.\n\nYet again the Palio proved that the life of\n\nthe city went on.\n\nBanner of July 1719. It is the oldest remaining,.\n\nSiena, Contrada of Eagle\n\nP:33\n\ninitials of the Deputies of the Festival:\n\nsoon, however, the monograms were\n\noverhung by the new enormous crest of\n\nEmperor Napoleon.\n\nThe height of political interference in the\n\nPalio came about in August, 1808, when\n\nthe centuries-old celebration of the Assumption became a celebration of Saint\n\nNapoleon. Fortunately the innovation did\n\nnot last.\n\nThe rock-bottom of misguided inventions\n\nwas reached in April 1810. The decision\n\nwas made to offer in the Piazza del Campo a great banquet for the paupers of the\n\nContrade, each Contrada having to find\n\nand invite 6 such individuals. The paupers were set up in tents bearing the insignia of the Contrade to which they belonged, while a crowd of pharisaical curious onlookers watched them eat. In the\n\ncenter, a bigger pavillion brought together\n\nthe paupers of the Eagle, the Panther,\n\nand the Tortoise. This union revealed the\n\nmotivation of the grotesque event disguised as philanthropy: The colors of the\n\n3 flags alluded to France, Austria, and the\n\nEmpire, and to the recent political-dynast the start of\n\nthe century the\n\nCivic Com mu -\n\nnity adopted two\n\nhistoric mea sures,\n\nthe brain children in\n\n1802 of Gonfaloniere Forteguerri. He ordained âthat jockeys are not to hold back\n\nor beat each other until after the race has\n\nbegun and the starting rope has dropped,\n\nand they have completely passed the\n\nLord Judgesâ Stand, upon penalty of imprisonment.â Thus ended the indecorous\n\nspectacle of jockeys whipping and hitting\n\neach other before the Start.\n\nIn another measure the Civic Magistracy\n\ndivided into 2 parts the prize which had\n\nalways been given to the winner of the linear Palio on 15 August, a crimson velvet\n\ndrape worth 110 thalers. From then on, 70\n\nthalers were given in cash to the winner\n\nof the linear Palio, and 40 to the Contrada\n\nwinning the circular Palio. Thus the long,\n\nprocess of popularization of the Palio was\n\nconcluded, renewing the aspect of a feast\n\nfor one and all, an official celebration of\n\nthe city.\n\nA drastic change is found in the paintings\n\non the Great Banners, caused by the\n\nFrench dominion over Tuscany. A reflection of the new egalitarianism from across\n\nthe Alps, between 1808 and 1813 the\n\nheraldic symbols of the Great Banner\n\nwere reduced to the simple, intertwined\n\n32 The 1800s:\n\nFrom the Risorgimento\n\nto the Society of Mutual\n\nAid\n\nMargherita of Savoy in an embroidered portrait, late-1800s.\n\nSiena, private collection\n\nA\n\nP:34\n\npatria never stopped the Sienese from\n\nparticipating on the front lines of history.\n\nAs an example of what recent anthropological reflection has dubbed âmultiple\n\nidentity,â the Sienese of the 1800s were at\n\nonce aware of their identity within the\n\nContrada and staunchly patriotic\n\nthroughout the Risorgimento. Virgilio\n\nGras si, meticulous historian of the Palio,\n\nunderlined the Sienese Contradeâs contribution in the Risorgimento; a stone was\n\nplaced on Palazzo Spannocchi in honor of\n\nthe âhelpful Contrade Dragon, Goose,\n\nand Forest.â The Contrade raised funds\n\nto support the volunteers in the Wars of\n\nIndependence, as an âoffering to the volunteers who, coming back from patriotic\n\nbattles, find themselves in the neediest\n\ncircumstances.â In July 1848 the Palio did\n\nnot take place. The sum that would have\n\nbeen spent on the race went instead to\n\nthe support of the volunteers who fought\n\nin Lombardy. In 1839, as a poster records,\n\nno military draft was necessary, so great\n\nwas the influx of Sienese volunteers under\n\nthe tricolor flag.\n\ntic wedding of Napoleon and Marie\n\nLouise of Austria.\n\nThe continuing homages to the\n\nsovereigns of the moment were paid willingly by the people (homages were a âtollâ\n\npaid in order to have future Palios) and\n\nby the nobles (homages were occasions to\n\nshow pomp and to meet otherwise unreachable sovereigns and notables). In\n\nthe space of a few years there were celebrations for the French Revolution, the\n\nKingdom of Etruria, Napoleon, Elisa Baciocchi, then in 1818 Ferdinand III of Lorena, and in 1819 Metternich was made\n\nwelcome. What may appear flunkeyism\n\nor indifference in the case of the Sienese\n\ncame from their initially forcible and then\n\nendemic detachment from history, their\n\never more marked âdream of the Middle\n\nAgesâ: despite the floats with neoclassical\n\nallegorical figures, in the procession of\n\n1813 the Carroccio wagon reappeared, recalling even today the great, ephemeral\n\ntriumph at Montaperti.\n\nSienaâs passion for its own history and for\n\nthe tradition of the Contrada as a small\n\n33\n\n1853 sketch of the costumes âin Piedmont-styleâ of the Giraffe.

The\n\npatriots who saw in the flag the Italian tricolor applauded warmly wherever the\n\nflag was seen, so much so that from 1849\n\nto 1859 the authorities changed the colors\n\nto white, pink, and green.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi, who attended the\n\nPalio in 1867 along with his Red Shirts,\n\nwas particularly celebrated by the red insignia of the Tower, which along with its\n\nshare of its applause received the fervent\n\ncheers of the âextreme party,â as note was\n\nmade in a report by the Kingâs police.\n\nEven Siena, though, was not without its\n\nAustria-lovers, who strongly opposed the\n\nadoption of the âPiedmont-styleâ costumes seen in the Piazza in 1836, and\n\nused later on other occasions.\n\nThe Risorgimento definitively liquidated\n\nthe pretense of likening jockeys to the\n\nheroes of Olympus. The Sienese knew the\n\njockeys all too well. If the 1700s was the\n\ncentury of ferocious combat between\n\njockeys, the 1800s saw their most savage\n\nand sensational betrayals.\n\nThe champion of this ilk was Francesco\n\nSantini, the Gobbo (âHunchbackâ) SaraThe Risorgimento was mirrored in the\n\nflags of the Contrade. Though in 1845 the\n\nMunicipality issued an ordinance that immutably codified the colors, their definitive arrangement had to await the Unity\n\nof Italy.\n\nThe Eagle never stopped unfurling its yellow insignia with the bicipital eagle, which\n\naccording to tradition was given by Carlo\n\nV in person on one of his visits to Siena.\n\nFor the whole Risorgimento the Eagle received upon its entry in the Piazza salvoes\n\nof whistles, intended for the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nThe same happened to the Tortoise,\n\nwhich back then unfurled a yellow and\n\nblack insignia that recalled the insignia of\n\nthe Austrians. Full of enthusiasm for Pius\n\nIX, in 1847 the Tortoise substituted the\n\nblack with white, thereby unfurling the\n\npapal colors. The whistles turned into applause. But two years later, liberal enthusiasm for the Pope having vanished, the\n\ninsignia went back to yellow and black\n\nand the whistles started up again, hushed\n\nonly in 1859 when the Tortoise took on its\n\npresent colors.\n\nThe opposite fate touched the flag of the\n\n34 Votive offering that the jockey for the She-Wolf had his wife paint as thanks for the grace he received in the Palio of 28/9/1862. The jockey,\n\nwho fell at the Start, had been stepped on by the horses of the Ram, the Eagle, and the Panther. (Siena, private collection of Notary Magi)\n\nP:36\n\ncustom that endures even today.\n\nIn the regulations of 1852, signed by Gonfaloniere Angelo Piccolomini, it was prohibited to give enlivening substances to\n\nhorses, under the responsibility of the\n\nCaptain. The legend of the beverone\n\nâgreat beverage,â half magical potion, half\n\nherbal tonic, philosophersâ stone of the\n\nContrada stalls, was to last a long time,\n\nwith its promise of the metamorphosis of\n\na nag into a Pegasus.\n\nIn the second half of the century the first\n\nhero among horses appeared: Stornino of\n\nBelforte, noted for his intelligence and for\n\nhis attachment to the Palio. Indeed stories\n\nwere told that as he felt Palio time growing close, he changed personality, turning\n\nfrom the tranquil horse of a country curate into the barb worthy of the fiery ancient race. He won 18 Palios, the last in\n\n1877,when he was 21. Upon his death the\n\nAcademy of Physio critics embalmed him\n\nWith the Risorgimento completed, the\n\nContrade showed their vitality. Yet again,\n\nfaced with great changes in history, with\n\nthe enigmas and uncertainties of new\n\ntimes, the Contrada members reassured\n\nthemselves by huddling closely around\n\ntheir traditions.\n\nInside the Contrade of Siena, fin-de-siÃ¨cle\n\nâassociationismâ developed, giving rise to\n\nmyriad societies whose members rarely\n\nnumbered more than 50. Several of these\n\nwere in direct affiliation to the Contrade,\n\nothers were based on neighborhood or\n\noccupation. In the first years, the main\n\naim of such societies was mutual aid: assistance was offered to unfortunates,\n\nwidows, invalids, and the elderly. These\n\nwere the goals of the Fan of the Tower, or\n\nRomulus and Remus founded in the SheWolf around 1870, of which Garibaldi was\n\nmade honorary president. Others included public education and literacy programs among their aims. Among these\n\nthere was the Society of Mutual Aid, Instruction and Education of the Star in the\n\nWave. Other societies promoted confergiolo, who changed flags for 30 years. He\n\nran for 15 Contrade, flattered them, despised them, betrayed them all. He won\n\n15 times for 7 different Contrade. When\n\nin 1855 with one of the favored horses he\n\nwent straight at San Martinoâs corner on\n\npurpose and was asked why, he burst out,\n\nâWhy should I win for you miserable lot\n\nwho gave me 140 coins when I earned\n\n170?â Like Judah, someone noted, he had\n\nbetrayed for the price of 30 coins. Sometimes, the roads not being closed off back\n\nthen at San Martino and at the Casato,\n\nfeckless jockeys left the Piazza at top\n\nspeed and galloped off past the city gates.\n\nThis was what Baicche did in 1877 and\n\nagain in 1885. In 1896 Ansanello, in the\n\nmiddle of the night, went to ring the bell\n\nat the gates of the Monks of the Osservanza, still dressed in the racing jacket of the\n\nTower. âThereâs a man who wants to\n\nsleep here. He looks like a stick of sealing\n\nwax,â the amazed guardian father reported to his superior.\n\nThe horses were still the anonymous barb\n\nhorses of previous times, but with a new\n\ndifference: in the drawing of August 1837\n\nmares were accepted, and in tact males\n\nwere discarded to avoid âinconvenient\n\nanti-aesthetics.â Thus was instituted a\n\n35\n\nFlag of the Society of Mutual Aid and Education in\n\nFontebranda, founded in 1870. Siena, Goose Contrada\n\nP:37\n\n36 ences and debates: in 1893 at the Garden, a society arising in the Caterpillar,\n\ndebates were held on the topic of female\n\nemancipation. The renewed role of the\n\nContrada in the life of the city was evident\n\nwhen a proposed law sought to abolish\n\nthe University of Siena, one of the oldest\n\nAthenea in Europe, as part of a general\n\nreordering of the Universities of the Kingdom. In January 1893, representatives of\n\nthe Contrade called an assembly and a\n\npublic demonstration, hanging posters\n\neverywhere. They protested invidividually\n\nas well: the Tower sent a telegram to Giolitti, the Goose to Crispi, the Shell to the\n\nKing of Italy. The proposal, âunworthy of\n\na government entrusted with the care of\n\nthe liberal franchises,â was in the end\n\nshelved forever.\n\nThe next year the 17 Priors of the Contrade founded the Magistrature of the\n\nContrade, a body set up for direction, discussion, and coordination on all matters\n\nof common interest to the Contrade. In\n\n1895 the Magistrature began its activities,\n\nruled by a statute which even today prescribes the annual election of a Rector\n\nand of a Deputation of 4 members to assist the Rector.\n\nAntonio Hercolani.

Sketches presented to the Contrade and approved by\n\nthe Municipality were realized then by the\n\nContrade themselves.\n\nThe Risorgimento over, the House of\n\nSavoy initiated a conscientious policy regarding the festivals and traditions of\n\nItaly. The royals made a Grand Tour of\n\ntheir new kingdom, encouraging the revival of ancient festivals. In Italy there was\n\nthe reinvention of tradition. Legnano,\n\nPontida, Barletta were treated like ancestors of the new state and of the much desired new monarchic and national-popular consciousness. The same, as the studies of George Mosse and of E.J. Hobsbawm show, happened throughout Europe between 1870 and World War I.\n\nHumbert I and Margherita of Savoy came\n\nand returned to Siena, and after the visit\n\nof 1887 there appeared in the heraldic\n\nsymbols of the Contrade the Savoy trouvailles that can still be seen today: Cyprus\n\nroses, knots and daisies, initials and collars of the Annunciation. The city expressed even greater affection for Mar -\n\ngherita than for the King, making her its\n\nnth proctectrix; it dedicated to her a variation on the medieval panpepato, the\n\npanforte margherita; it named her in\n\ncoarse but affectionate popular songs; it\n\nsent its most beautiful children to offer\n\ndaisies (margherite) and mumbled verses\n\nof poetry; she was offered the keys to the\n\nhouse of St Catherine.\n\nSiena celebrated in its own way the Unity\n\nof Italy and responded to the festive politics of the Savoys: in the last decade of\n\nthe century, 28 Palios were run.\n\nP:39\n\nt the turn of\n\nthe century\n\nthe Contrade\n\nand the Municipality were caught up in\n\na renewal of costumes which, in 1904, assumed definitively the Medieval-Renaissance look\n\ntested a generation before and which,\n\nbetween purism and fin-de-siÃ¨cle, was\n\nrooted in Sienese tastes. In the\n\noleographs and the overly derided âpanforte styleâ dictating the architectural and\n\nfurniture designs of that period, in everything from wrought iron to upholstery,\n\nthe polar star was the Exhibition of Ancient Sienese Art in 1904. Called for by\n\nMayor Alessandro Lisini (also a historian\n\nof the Contrade), the exhibition gathered\n\nin 40 areas of the Palazzo Comunale\n\nsome 2,000 items from the 1200s to the\n\n1700s, works of art both major and minor,\n\nsacred and secular. On17 April Vittorio\n\nEmanuele III inaugurated the exhibition,\n\nsending echoes around the world. If\n\namong scholars the scientic study of art\n\nfrom Sienaâs golden age was relaunched,\n\nthe popular imagination of the Sienese\n\nset the mythic period of âSiena-nessâ in a\n\nvision of the 1300s romanticized and embellished by fantasy.\n\nThe new Historic Procession, inaugurated\n\nfor an Extraordinary Palio, placed behind\n\nthe Carroccio a 2nd wagon portraying the\n\nAllegory of Peace as painted by Ambrogio\n\nLorenzetti in the Palazzo Comunale. The\n\nHistoric Procession, with its explicit conjuring of the erstwhile pomp of the city and\n\nthe old City-State, expressed the historic\n\nmemory of Sienaâs identity, a past once\n\nagain present and real. A sort of âmyth of\n\nthe eternal return,â such as those dear to\n\nMircea Eliade, it was enacted in the Piazza del Campo, the âtheater of the\n\nSienese.â\n\nParadoxically the âmetahistoricalnessâ of\n\nthe Palio was not found an unchanging\n\nritual, but in continual innovations to\n\nkeep the present in tune with the past. Innovation had to speak the language of\n\ntradition. Thus in 1919, after the War, for\n\nthe veterans who attended the Palio the\n\nâflag-waving of victoryâ was introduced,\n\nper formed by 17 Stardard-Bearers, each\n\nin time to the beats of his own drummer,\n\nimmediately before the horses came out\n\ninto the Piazza from the Courtyard. The\n\ninnovation immediately became ritual\n\nbecause it was congenial, because it represented the eruption into the Piazza of\n\nan excited âorder-disorderâ after the impeccable, studied, slow rhythms of the\n\nHistoric Procession.\n\nRepresenting âdisorder,â the entropy\n\nthat verges on\n\nthrowing into crisis\n\nthe rules and order\n\nof things, there\n\nwere, as always, the\n\nchaotic Start and the race\n\nitself, which soon found\n\nnew heroes. The jockeys\n\ncame from the Plain of\n\nEmpoli, Monte Amiata,\n\nthe Maremma and\n\nupper La zio. Among\n\nthem, Angelo\n\nâPicinoâ Meloni\n\nexcelled, one of\n\nthe all-time\n\ngreats.

Despite a disabled\n\narm, he rode with gusto, riding crop flying.\n\nIn August 1909 he won for the Dragon, using his whip on the Shell and the Panther.\n\nThe next year he won for the Ram, taking\n\nhis whip to the Shell and the Wave. Artfully controlling his horse, he won for the\n\nPorcupine in 1913. His predominance in\n\nthe Piazza was mitigated by the fact that\n\nin 1907, for fear of the secret clannish\n\ndeals between jockeys, a rule was passed\n\nto bar close relatives from running in the\n\nsame Palio: Meloni made room for âMeloncino,â his son Corrado, who went on to\n\nwin two Palios. Meloni had several supporting actors. Domenico âScansinoâ Fradiacono won twice for the Tower in 1896.\n\nAstride the turn of the century, Scansino\n\nran 30 Palios, of which he won 7. Aldo âBubboloâ Mantovani was a rarity: one of\n\nfew jockeys to be a native Sienese. He first\n\nran in 1910, took part in 31 Palios, and\n\nwon 4. Alduino âZaraballeâ Emidi used to\n\nintroduce himself in a rather direct way,\n\nalmost his personal slogan: âMy name is\n\nZaraballe, I come from Apulia, and Iâve\n\ngot good thighs.â With those thighs, from\n\n1902 to 1922, he rode 22 horses in the\n\nPalio, winning twice.\n\nBetween the Two Wars\n\nAfter the pause imposed on the Palio and\n\nthe Contrade by the War, the community\n\nlife of the Associations refound its vigor,\n\nbut with the advent of Fascism it passed\n\nunder the aegis of the National Recreational Organization. Historic seats and\n\nchurches of the Contrade remained untouched. Change was not always peaceful; the new authorities disbanded the\n\nmore riotous Contrada associations, such\n\nas the âDawnâ in the Caterpillar and the\n\nâRhinocerosâ in the Tower. To avoid the\n\nsame fate, the âCastelmontorioâ in the\n\nRam Contrada disbanded itself. But new\n\nSocieties were founded, negotiating with\n\nthe new regime for their own kind of autonomy, in keeping with the always and\n\n40 The victory of the Dragon Contrada.

There,\n\nmingling their own with other\n\nshows of âvirile gamesâ which\n\nthe regime had resuscitated\n\ndeeming them useful in forging\n\nâagile, swift, and eagerâ youth,\n\nthe representatives of the Palio\n\nsaluted Hitler and Musolini.\n\nVittorio Emanuele III came often to the Palio, almost always\n\nprivately. Siena became a frequent side trip during his vacation in San Rossore. The King\n\nwatched the Palio from the\n\nPalazzo Comunale, from the\n\nwindow at which Carlo V had\n\nonce appeared.\n\nThe jockeys all raised their riding crops to the King in July,\n\n1937 before going to the starting\n\nrope, introducing an innovation\n\nstill part of the Palio ritual. The\n\n1936 Palio was dubbed âthe\n\nEmpireâ for it celebrated the\n\nAfrican enterprises of Facsicm.\n\nThe Banner won by the Giraffe\n\nwas then autographed by the\n\nâEmperor King.â The Giraffe for\n\nthat felicitous win and with the\n\nbacking of the royal house, began to call itself âimperial.â With\n\nthe calmness and distance the\n\nPalio has always shown to\n\nregimes, it described itself in its\n\nhymn as âroyal, imperial, re41\n\nDario Neri:\n\nPoster for the Palio of 2 July 1928. Siena, Historic\n\nArchive of theMunicipality\n\nP:43\n\nBetween the 2 wars the Historic Procession became ever more splendid and\n\nsolemn. The renewal of the costumes and\n\nof the Carroccio wagon occurred in 1928,\n\nunder the supervision of a commision of\n\nâartists and experts on the subjectâ presided over by the PodestÃ . Expenses, paid by\n\nthe Municipality, by the Monte de Paschi\n\nBank, by the Contrade, and by underwriting from private citizens amounted to\n\nmore than a million lira. The style chosen\n\nfor the costumes was that of the late\n\n1400s, for in that time the Contrade had\n\nstarted to appear in the Piazza. The Procession thus began to quote its own past\n\nexplicitly, closing itself off symbolically in\n\na full-circle as had occurred in the transition from the linear to the circular Palio.\n\nThe new Carroccio wagon, adorned with\n\nContrade allegories painted by Federigo\n\nJoni, was pulled not by horses but by 6\n\nchianina oxen, as if in homage from the\n\nSienese countryside to the city. In 1936\n\nfigures were introduced standing for corpublican once again!â The Palio sees\n\nregimes as ephemeral compared to the\n\nPalio itself: They belong to short-term\n\nhistory and to superficial structures; the\n\nPalio feels part of deep structures and of\n\nlong-term history. âHe will have to go and\n\nI will remain,â Savonarola said about\n\nLorenzo deâ Medici, expressing a similar\n\nview.\n\nMussolini showed himself sensitive to the\n\nrequest of the Municipality of Siena,\n\nwhich even then sought to protect the\n\nPalio from other revivals that sprang up\n\non the Peninsula. In answer to a request\n\nsubmitted by PodestÃ Bargagli Petrucci,\n\na letter reached the Prefect of Siena in\n\n1935, communicating that âthe Duce has,\n\nby appropriate ordinance, decreed that\n\nthe name Palio shall be reserved exclusively for the Palio of Siena.â Yet Mussolini never came to the Palio. The joke went\n\naround that the Duce, believing himself\n\nunique, ill-tolerated the idea of coming to\n\na city that already had 17 Duci.\n\n42 Federigo Joni: The Carroccio Wagon of 1928 (painted on wood).

Spear-carriers of\n\nthe Palazzo increased, escorting the Carroccio wagon, two drummers sonorously\n\nclosing the Procession.\n\nThe theatrical activities of Silvio Gigli met\n\nwith great popularity among the Contrade. Luigi Bonelliâs operetta âRompicolloâ with its Palio setting was performed in\n\nItaly and abroad. In 1932 Alessandro\n\nBlasetti came to Siena to shoot âPalio,â a\n\nmystery film (the script borrowed several\n\nshort stories by Bonelli) shown in cinemas\n\nthroughout Italy with success.\n\nBut the new phenomenon was the founding in the Contrade of sporting groups\n\nand football teams: in 1928 , 11 such\n\nteams were active.\n\nFor the last time, some people read political allusions into Contrada colors: the red\n\nof the Tower against the tricolor of the\n\nGoose. But for the Sienese the Tower remained the neighborhood of Salicotto\n\nand the Goose the neighborhood of\n\nFonte branda. In the Piazza, the Goose\n\nand the Tower faced each other as always, no punches held. The Goose was\n\npart of T.O.N.O. (Tartuca, Onda, Nicchio,\n\nOca), the single, precarious Contrada\n\ncoalition in Palio history. It won several\n\nPalios but disbanded with rancor in 1934\n\nwhen the Goose won against the agreements (âThat of â34/ weâve tied around\n\nour finger as a reminder/ of the Discombobulated Duckâ the Shell sang bitterly).\n\nThe Tower teamed up with Ganascia, the\n\ntrue successor to Meloni who beat his\n\nmaster with his own favorite weapon, the\n\nriding crop, in 1933 (âThe whip of\n\nGanascia/ is made round / to whip the\n\nGoose and the Waveâ went a song of the\n\nTower). Ganascia was loved for what appeared to be generous combativeness. In\n\ntruth he was a meticulous calculator who\n\ntried to leave nothing to chance. His\n\nstrategies were devised in endless sessions in the long winters of Monticello\n\nAmiate, where the twice victorious jockey\n\nDomenico âIl Moroâ Leoni was born.\n\nGanascia, too, wore the colors of almost\n\nall the Contrade, 15 in 20 years, winning\n\n8 Palios, among which was the memorable âovercoatâ (2 victories for 1 Contrada in 1 year) for the Tortoise in 1933,\n\nwhatâs more on the same barb, the legendary Folco.\n\nFolco was a sorrel with a mild temperament, one of the maremman half-breeds\n\nfor decades making up the majority of\n\nbarbs in the Piazza.

He returned to\n\nSiena to reconcile his needs with his passions: his Contrada and the Palio. Out of\n\nhis stalls came many leading horses in\n\nthe Piazza and at least as many famous\n\njockeys, from Meloni to Aceto.\n\nOther famous names in Siena included\n\nMargiacchi, the Papis, and Dedo Pianigiani, luckiest of all, for he had the good\n\nfortune to be elected Captain of the Ram,\n\nhave his own horse Belfiore assigned to\n\nhim, and win with that horse.\n\nBut none of the best horses of this period\n\nâ la Giacca, Lina, Lola, Margiacchina, Ruello, or Wally (named in dubious homage\n\nto Simpson) â conquered Sienese hearts\n\nas much as Folco, who found a friend in\n\nPappio, groom of the Dragon. Many stories live on about their friendship. Folco\n\nfollowed Pappio without so much as a bridle, waited for him in front of taverns\n\nwhere he stopped for a glass and a chat,\n\nand people swear that the horse, when\n\nspoken to, replied with a friendly neigh.\n\nThe War began and Folco was hidden in\n\nthe woods of the Capriano estate by the\n\nowners, the family of Dario Neri who, as\n\nmanager, would steer Sclavo and found\n\nthe Electa publishing house, and who, as\n\nartist, would create the costumes for the\n\nWave, the still-in-use Palio poster, a Great\n\nBanner, and an unsurpassed portrait of\n\nthe Sienese Chalkdowns,, praised by such\n\nfriends as Bernard Berenson and Carlo\n\nEmilio Gadda.\n\nWord War II interrupted the activities of\n\nthe Palio and of the Contrade; even in\n\nthat grave moment the Palio was ever in\n\nthe hearts of the Sienese. On a Piazza del\n\nCampo drawn in the sand in a prison\n\ncamp in Tunisia, 10 Sienese ran their Palio\n\nin August 1943, wearing paper plumes.\n\nThe cannon was a gasoline tin. The\n\n44 Federigo Joni: The âDeadâ Contrade, 1928 (painted on wood). Siena, private collection\n\nP:46\n\nCaterpillar won, celebrated by little wine\n\nand much song.\n\nAfter the War\n\nThe War over, the Sienese returned to\n\ntheir daily traditions. They remembered\n\ntheir war dead, welcomed returning veterans, and the Contrada Associations reopened their doors. The Eagle and the\n\nTower held dinners for the1939 victories\n\nthe outbreak of war had stopped them\n\nfrom celebrating. And the Sienese asked\n\nfor an extraordinary Palio. The first\n\npeace-time mayor, caught up in other priorities arising from the important moment, incautiously uttered from a triple\n\nwindow in the Palazzo Comunale words\n\nthat no mayor of Siena must ever say:\n\nâCitizens, either me or the Palio!â The\n\nreplies of the noisy crowd in the Piazza are\n\neasily imagined. In the end the mayor\n\nstayed on, but the Palio of Peace was held\n\non 20 August 1945.\n\nIn the race a law student at the Sienese\n\nAtheneum triumphed, Gioacchino âRu -\n\nba cuoriâ CalabrÃ², riding Folco, the old,\n\nmuch-loved hero. The Palio was particularly tumultuous. There were fist-fights in\n\nwhich soldiers of the Allied troops got involved. After the race, disappointed\n\nmembers of the Caterpillar chased Ru -\n\nbacuori and ripped the Great Banner to\n\nshreds. The Dragon keeps a copy they\n\nhad painted at their own expense.\n\nIn 1950, thanks to the initiative of the\n\nFriends of the Palio, the Masgalgano was\n\nreinstituted, the prize given for the demeanor of the costumed representatives\n\nand for the skill of their Standard-Bearers\n\nand drummer. Designation of the winning Contrada was based on points\n\nawarded by commissioners around the\n\ntrack.\n\nThat same year an important innovation\n\nmodified the Start, which since then has\n\nbeen set on the Judgesâ Stand by a mechanical device invented by a Sienese\n\nnamed Aldo Sprugnoli. The order is\n\nlearned at the last moment, when the\n\n45\n\nVittorio Giunti (1894-1962): The Benediction of the Horse in the Church of the Goose Contrada. (Oil on canvas). Siena, private collection\n\nP:47\n\nhorses are at the Casato and are headed\n\ntoward the starting area. With this device\n\nthe Start is determined by chance. Previously the mayor had prepared the order,\n\nfilling out by his own discretion 3 lists, one\n\nof which was drawn.\n\nIn the Palio of August, 1946 the jockey\n\nfrom Manziana, Giuseppe âCianconeâ\n\nGentili achieved the first of his 9 successes; he remained inarguably foremost\n\namong the jockeys of the Piazza until the\n\nrise of Andrea De Gortes. Gentili was a\n\njockey of great intelligence and unsurpassed skill, loved and hated, feared and\n\nrespected as few others in Palio history.\n\nHis detractors called him âBeppe the\n\nGreedy,â his admirers called him âthe\n\nprofessor,â a nickname then handed on\n\nto Aceto. Several of his winning races are\n\nremembered as having been perfectly\n\nrun. But in 1961, running for the Goose,\n\nthe starting rope found him in the 9th\n\nposition. The Tower, eternal archrival,\n\nwas 10th, the position of âthe running\n\nstartâ that prompts the Start. Vittorino,\n\njockey for the Tower, shot past Ciancone,\n\nbrushing against him. Ciancone had no\n\ntime to block the adversary or to show\n\neveryone that at least he had tried to get\n\nin his way. Vittorino proceeded to win.\n\nâMy horse took a wrong step,â Ciancone\n\ntried to justify himself to the furious\n\nmembers of the Goose who were ready\n\nto lynch him; theTower, in mocking\n\nsongs, sang of a raise in the price of betrayal for a turn-coat: 3, 5, 6 million.\n\nGentili, despite his stuntman-like\n\nphysique, felt the aches of the Contradaâs wrath even 6 months later.\n\nThe same years also witnessed the lovely\n\nfable of Vittorino and Gaudenzia. Giorgio\n\nTerni came from Monte Amiata; in 1953\n\nhe arrived in the Shell, which became his\n\nContrada, home, and workplace. He ran\n\nfor the Shell in 10 races and won 3; all in\n\nall, he collected 21 races and 6 victories.\n\nAthletic, cool and with lightning-fast reflexes, he was famous for fiery starts after\n\nunnervingly long waits. Vittorino was the\n\ntrainer to Gaudenzia, a maremma dapple-grey mare who came into the Piazza\n\nat 10 years of age in 1952. Gaudenzia was\n\ndocile and fast, precise and generous:\n\nideal traits for Vittorinoâs gifts with which\n\nto make an unbeatable pair. In August1954 luck and Contrada strategy divided Gaudenzia and Vittorino and had\n\nthem run against each other. Gaudenzia\n\nlost her rider â on purpose, so they say â\n\nand for 2 circuits tried to pass Vittorino\n\nwho was first and who tried to keep her\n\nbehind. Despite the whiplashes, Gaudenzia passed him in the last meters of the\n\nrace and won, with the Piazza in delirium. Vittorino went to hug her with tears\n\nin his eyes. Her adventure in the Palio\n\nended in glory, Gaudenzia returned to\n\nthe hills of Celsa, on the estate of Benito\n\nGiachetti, where she died at 30, surrounded by the Contrada membersâ love.\n\n46 The Senior Page of the Unicorn Contrada in the costume of 1955\n\nP:48\n\nGaudenzia was not the only heroine of\n\nthose years. In August of 1957 the Eagle\n\nwas represented by the jockey Diavola,\n\nthe nickname for Rosanna Bonelli, once\n\nthe stand-in for Diana Dors who, with Vittorio Gassman, filmed Luigi Zampaâs âLa\n\nragazza del Palioâ in Siena. Diavola made\n\na great impression during the Trial Runs,\n\nand in the Palio she was third when she\n\nfell at San Martinoâs corner. The Contrada members feted her, despite her unfortunate race.\n\nOn the 2 July 1955 new costumes appeared in the Piazza, following the by now\n\nestablished rhythm of a renewal in every\n\ngeneration. The insignia of Montalcino\n\nhas been paraded with special emphasis\n\never since because that spring the Sienese\n\nheld the first long march to that city in remembrance of the asylum received by the\n\nGovernment in exile of the Sienese Republic. The march is repeated every 8\n\nyears.\n\nThe last structural change in the Palio\n\ntook place between the 1950s and the\n\n1960s, with the arrival of horses and then\n\nof jockeys from Sardinia.\n\nThe maremma horses were indeed becoming scarcer; breeding centers were\n\nclosing and, with the rise of mass mo -\n\ntorized transportation, work- and\n\ndraught-horses\n\nhad almost disappeared. The\n\nPalio, however,\n\ncalled for horses\n\never faster and\n\nmore precise. Thus began the era of the Sardinian horses. The first\n\nof the great Sardinian horses was a\n\nmare called Uberta\n\nde Mores, who in 1960\n\nand 1961 won 4 consecutive Palios. She was trained by\n\nGentili, who ran her in the\n\nprovince or with other horses and jockeys\n\nin the Palio of CinecittÃ , giving her the\n\nchance to be among the âwalk-onsâ in\n\nthe first spaghetti westerns. Soon the\n\npresence of Sardinian horses became\n\npredominant. In the August,1962 Palio; 9\n\nof the 10 horses were Sardinian. Up\n\nagainst them was the last legendary\n\nmaremma horse, who often changed\n\nname and ownership: he was called Eucalipto, Ettore, Dragone, and finally\n\nTopolone. In 17 races he won 7 victories.\n\nBorn in 1954, Topolone was big, powerful, short in the mid-section (âItâs like sitting in an armchair,â said jockeys who\n\nrode him), precise like few other barbs\n\never seen in the Piazza. His victorious\n\nrace for the Shell won him the praises of\n\nsinger, Gianni Brera, who in his epinicion\n\nwrote, âAh, Topolone, Saracen devil! /\n\nAh, my Topolone, ah Shell!â In 1969\n\nTopolone won the fastest Palio until\n\nthen, in 1 min. 15 secs, a record, so they\n\nsaid, unbroken since 1926. After him, in\n\nthe 1970s, the Piaz za greeted Urbino de\n\nOrzieri, a horse that was capricious and\n\nshadowy, nervous and victorious. Between 1978 and 1979 Urbino de Orzieri\n\nwon 3 Palios, set a record for the\n\ntrack, and then left the scene, victim of the complex reasons connected to Palio strategy and,\n\nabove all, of his inarguable\n\nsuperiority.\n\n47\n\nKnight representing the\n\nUgurgieri Family in the\n\ncostume of 1981\n\nP:49\n\n48 With the last venture of Gentili, winner\n\nfor the Wave at 55 years\n\nof age, the era of the Tuscan-Lazial jockeys ended. Following the Sardinian horses, jockeys came from the same island in\n\n2 great waves. The first was that of jockey-farmers who found their natural habitat in the agricultural, pastoral communities of Sardinians relocated en masse to\n\nthe Sienese Chalkdowns. The second\n\nwave was that of Sardinian jockeys who\n\nreached the Piazza by way of other racetracks. Among them was Andrea De\n\nGortes who would go on to earn the title\n\nâKing of the Piazzaâ and to dominate the\n\nworld of jockeys and the Palio scene for a\n\nquarter of a century.\n\nFrom the start, Aceto showed an impeccable style, cool nerves and a great determination. He capitalized on his adversariesâ errors and his own good fortune,\n\nmaking several of his Palio victories absolutely sensational. In other Palios he triumphed by strength or by cunning. He\n\nbound himself to the Goose, but often\n\nmanaged to convince the same Contrada\n\nthat the best strategy to make the rival\n\nTower lose was for him to run for other\n\nContrade to which chance had given the\n\nbest horses. Struggling against him and\n\nhelping him there were mainly 2 jockeys:\n\nBastiano, a lanky Arcadian from Ve sco -\n\nna in the Sienese Chalkdowns, and\n\nCanapino, descended from the maremma cowboys, a great breeder of Palio\n\nhorses on his ranch in the area of Asciano.\n\nIn his oustanding career, Aceto would win\n\n14 times wearing the colors of almost all\n\nthe Contrade. Aceto became a nationally\n\nfamous personality, to whom myriad articles, innu merable television interviews,\n\nand, today, 3 biographies have been dedicated. Aceto transformed the image of\n\nthe Palio jockey. His requests were those\n\nof a professional who levelheadedly neThe Contrade and the rites of passage: Contrada baptism,\n\nwedding, and funeral\n\nP:50\n\n49\n\ngotiates the terms of his services according to the laws of demand and offer. After\n\na sensational divorce from the Goose, he\n\njoined up with the Tortoise, then with the\n\nTower. Though he has stepped back from\n\nthe Piazza, his influence in the world of\n\njockeys remains, as does the national attention he attracts. Many fans await his\n\nreturn, his nth sensational gesture.\n\nThe Contrade Today\n\nBeyond the Palio and the Piazza, the city\n\nchanges. The center empties. Neighborhood life grows thin. The majority of Contrada members, about 90%, live outside\n\nthe boundaries of their neighborhoods and\n\nonly commute to it. But stopping the city\n\nfrom changing face altogether there is still\n\nthe iron-like, invisible 4th dimension of the\n\nContrade, a dimension in symbolic space.\n\nToday the Contrada, in the territory of its\n\nboundaries, has a series of meaningful\n\nplaces, first of all a symbolic âgate,â unmarked by special architectural signs but\n\nknown by tradition, facing the center of\n\ntown. The church, the most ancient place\n\nof the Contrada, serves as chapel for the religious ceremonies of the Contrada and of\n\nindividual members. The Contrada Association is a vast recreational circle that is\n\nopen every day, run by Contrada volunteers. Usually a wide green space is connected to the Contrada, owned by the\n\nContrada or used with the liberal consent\n\nof the Municipality, wisely committed to\n\ndefending the green valleys within the city\n\nwalls, in the belief that the Contrade are the\n\ngroups best equipped to guard them and\n\nto put them to socially important use. The\n\nAssociations take on the task of the daily\n\nsocialization among members through the\n\norganization and management of free\n\ntime, creating and searching for new opportunities to promote social life in step\n\nwith the times. Once societies open only to\n\nmen, the Associations have become ever\n\nmore clubs for âmembers and families.â\n\nP:51\n\n50 In the streets of the neighborhood, Sienese children play the Palio\n\nA group of flag-makers of the Ram Contrada at work\n\nP:52\n\n51\n\nWithin the Associations groups of various\n\nages and interests form and hold their\n\nmeetings. Life in the Association has taken on the same functional and symbolic\n\nrole held by life in the neighborhood in\n\npast generations. The Association is the\n\nsecular arm of the Contrada. Fountains\n\nbearing the crests of the Contrade have\n\nspread throughout the city. They are used\n\nfor baptism within the Contrada, and\n\nabove all they constitute the most characteristic archi tectural sign of the Contrada; the tabernacles of the Contrada take\n\non color and Contrada connotation once\n\na year when the children decorate them\n\nLeft: The costumed representatives of the Owl Contrada\n\nprepare for the rounds of paying honors to the protectors\n\nDrummers and Standard-Bearers of the Eagle Contrada along\n\nthe city streets\n\nP:53\n\n52 Crucial moments of the Palio: the Start, horses at San Martinoâs corner, the victorious finish with riding crop raised\n\nP:54\n\n53\n\nwith flowers and colors for the Feast of the\n\nMadonna on 3 September.\n\nThe Historical Seat/Museum is referred to\n\nby the members as the âContradaâ\n\nthrough antono-masia, and they refuse\n\nto think of it as âa museum.â For them\n\nindeed, the building is a natural extension\n\nof home, a communal home that carefully houses and proudly displays objects of\n\nhistoric, artistic, and archival value purchased or donated by the members.\n\nSimilarly the population of the Contrada\n\nis considered by members as the natural\n\nextension of their biological family. To observers who have searched for analogies\n\nwith other times, places, and cultures, the\n\nContrada has appeared a metropolitan\n\ntribe, a Mediterranean clan, a modern\n\njunto or faction, a modern âclanâ of mixed\n\nsocial classes. The Sienese instead prefer\n\nto underline the Contradaâs historic and\n\nsociological uniqueness.\n\nThe Contrada continues to take part in\n\nthe Palio and to deliver rites of passage\n\nand of identity confirmation. It is there at\n\nbirths, weddings, and funerals with its\n\npage and its flag; on the special occasions\n\nP:55\n\n54 in the lives of its members, the Contrada\n\nsends cards of greeting, congratulations,\n\nsolidarity, condolescence.\n\nThe Contrada loves to posit itself as a\n\nsmall autonomous patria, a city in the\n\nSienese âconfeder ationâ of cities. In this\n\nlight, after the War twin nings between the\n\nContrade and other Italian cities flowered:\n\nthe Eagle and Aquila, the Snail and\n\nVenice, the Porcupine and Perugia, the\n\nPanther and Lucca, and so forth. But the\n\nconsubstantial in compatibility of the Contrada with all that happens âoutsideâ has\n\nleft such twinnings as mostly formal, practically inactive acts. It is Siena, following a\n\nEuropean trend, that has twinned itself\n\nand carries on active cultural exchanges\n\nwith Weimar, Wetzlar, and Avignon and\n\nintensive relations with Tartu, Siviglia, and\n\nthe chinese cities of Nantong, Nanchino,\n\nYangzhou in the district of Jangsu.\n\nTraditionally one belongs to a Contrada\n\nin different ways. The oldest is jus soli, by\n\nbirth within the boundaries of the Contrada. Many are the stories of pueperae taken to give birth in the right place, or of the\n\nsoil of the Contrada spread under the\n\nhospital bed to reconstruct there the ancestral land. More recently, births in private homes having almost disappeared,\n\njus soli applies to the Contrada in which\n\nthe newborn has its legal address.\n\nAccording to tradition one may belong to\n\na Contrada also through jus sanguinis, direct descent from members. When parents belong to different Contrade, the\n\nmembership of the children is carefully\n\nnegotiated, taking into account the family\n\ntree of both parents and their importance\n\nwithin their Contrade.\n\nJubilation of the victorious Contrada members before the\n\nJudgesâ Stand, after the handing over of the Great Banner. In\n\nthis photo from 1997 both Great Banners of the âcappottoâ\n\n(âthe overcoat,â or double victory in a single year) won by the\n\nGiraffe are clearly visible\n\nAfter the victory the celebrating Contrada members bear the\n\nGreat Banner to the Cathedral for the tumultuous Te Deum of\n\nthanksgiving to the Madonna of the Graces\n\nP:56\n\n55\n\nP:57\n\n56\n\nP:58\n\n57\n\nA third criterion is a sort of jus affinitatis,\n\nby custom, when neither of the above motives applies to become a member of the\n\nContrada which one simply choses to frequent, where one has close social relationships; this criterion applies also to people\n\ncoming from other towns or countries,\n\npeople who make their first Sienese friendships within a certain Contrada.\n\nThis custom, too, is ancient. In their first\n\ncenturies the Contrade had ânoble protectorsâ (representing the Contrade to the\n\npublic authorities before the role and status of the Prior were broadened) who\n\ncould even be resident outside the Contradeâs territories. The Proclam ation of Violante explicitly upheld the Contradeâs\n\nright to seek and maintain protec tors beyond their boundaries. Today each Contrada has a steady number of âprotectorsâ\n\nwho financially support it through voluntary contributions. The identity of such\n\ncontributors is secret. The number of protectors is secret, too, but may be estimated between several hundred in the less\n\npopulated Contrade and several thousand in those with greater populations.\n\nThe Contrade, highlight social, noble, and\n\nprofessional titles of their members, but\n\nat the same time they make a point of underscoring that within the Contrada people have always applied the notion calling\n\neach other by the informal form of the\n\nword âyou,â and no one has ever shied\n\naway from bold exchange of opinions.\n\nThe Contrada thus represents both the\n\nreal hierarchy of Sienese society and the\n\nideal communitas in which all members\n\nhave equal rights and responsibilities,\n\nfreedom and dignity, and they face each\n\nother with their individual humanity. In\n\nthe balance of these two contradictory\n\ncharacteristics lies the anthro-pological\n\nThe victory dinner of the Wave Contrada in 1995. At the end\n\nof the summer the victorious Contrade celebrate with a grand\n\ndinner laid out in the streets of the neighborhood, at which a\n\nplace of honor is reserved for the horse\n\nP:59\n\n58 originality of the Contrada as complex social structure.\n\nIt is, the Sienese insist, a âdemocraticâ\n\nstructure, even if Contrada democracy\n\nhas manners and features more easily\n\nrecognized in the Renaissance than in the\n\nmodern age. The Contrada demonstrates\n\nthis, among other examples, in its electoral mechanisms and in the distribution\n\nof its offices. Elections are generally held\n\nevery 2 years. Candidates are proposed\n\nby an electoral commission of 10 or so\n\nmembers, designated for election by the\n\nbodies in charge; the commission selects\n\nnominees for the list that will be voted on.\n\nA General Council is elected (usually 100\n\nor so members) as is a Presidency of 15 or\n\nso members who govern the Contrada.\n\nThe Prior is head of the Contrada, assisted by the Vicar. Concerning the Palio, the\n\nContrada is led instead by the Captain,\n\nhelped by 2 lieutenants, who, in various\n\nContrade, are either elected or appointed\n\nby the Captain or by the assembly.\n\nThe Corrector, priest of the Contrada, is\n\nelected and then designated with the\n\nplacet of the Curia. He officiates at all the\n\nreligious ceremonies in Contrada life. A financial attachÃ© coordinates the capillary\n\nwork of the numerous appointees to collect the donation pledges â all of which\n\nare secret â for a âPalio victoryâ or for t"
