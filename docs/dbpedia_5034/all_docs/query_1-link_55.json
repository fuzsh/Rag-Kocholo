        "text": "Effects of nifedipine on the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide in rats: possible role of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibition by nifedipine.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Jin-Seok; Choi, In; Choi, Dong-Hyun\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nifedipine on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of repaglinide in rats. The effect of nifedipine on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 activity was evaluated. The pharmacokinetic parameters of repaglinide and blood glucose concentrations were also determined in rats after oral (0.5 mg/kg) and intravenous (0.2 mg/kg) administration of repaglinide to rats in the presence and absence of nifedipine (1 and 3 mg/kg). Administration of nifedipine resulted in inhibition CYP3A4 activity with an IC50 value of 7.8 Î¼M, and nifedipine significantly inhibited P-gp activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared to the oral control group, nifedipine significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-â) and the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of repaglinide by 49.3 and 25.5%, respectively. Nifedipine significantly decreased the total body clearance (CL/F) of repaglinide by 22.0% compared to the oral control group. Nifedipine also increased the absolute bioavailability (AB) of repaglinide by 50.0% compared to the oral control group (33.6%). In addition, the relative bioavailability (RB) of repaglinide was 1.16- to 1.49-fold greater than that of the control group. Compared to the intravenous control, nifedipine significantly increased AUC0-â of repaglinide. Blood glucose concentrations had significant differences compared to the oral control groups. Nifedipine enhanced the oral bioavailability of repaglinide, which may be mainly attributable to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of repaglinide in the small intestine and/or in the liver and to inhibition of the P-gp efflux transporter in the small intestine and/or reduction of total body clearance by nifedipine. The current study has raised awareness of potential drug interactions by concomitant use of repaglinide with nifedipine.\n\nDevelopment of coated nifedipine dry elixir as a long acting oral delivery with bioavailability enhancement.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Jae-Yoon; Jin, Su-Eon; Park, Youmie; Lee, Hyo-Jong; Park, Yohan; Maeng, Han-Joo; Kim, Chong-Kook\n\n2011-10-01\n\nTo develop the long acting nifedipine oral delivery with bioavailability enhancement, a nifedipine dry elixir (NDE) containing nifedipine ethanol solution in dextrin shell was prepared using a spray-dryer, and then coated nifedipine dry elixir (CNDE) was prepared by coating NDE with Eudragit acrylic resin. The physical characteristics and bioavailability of NDE and CNDE were evaluated, and then compared to those of nifedipine powder. NDE and CNDE, which were spherical in shape, had about 6.64 and 8.68-8.75 Î¼m of geometric mean diameters, respectively. The amount of nifedipine dissolved from NDE for 60 min increased about 7- and 40-fold compared to nifedipine powder in pH 1.2 simulated gastric fluid and pH 6.8 simulated intestinal fluid, respectively. Nifedipine released from CNDE was retarded in both dissolution media compared with that from NDE. After oral administration of NDE, the C(max) and AUC(0â8h) of nifedipine in rat increased about 13- and 7-fold, respectively, and the Tmax of nifedipine was reduced significantly compared with those after oral administration of nifedipine powder alone. The AUC(0â8h) and T(max) of nifedipine in CNDE increased markedly and the C(max) of nifedipine in CNDE was significantly reduced compared to those in NDE. It is concluded that CNDE, which could lower the initial burst-out plasma concentration and maintain the plasma level of nifedipine over a longer period with bioavailability enhancement, might be one of potential alternatives to the marketed long acting oral delivery system for nifedipine.\n\nManagement of preterm labor: atosiban or nifedipine?\n\nPubMed\n\nde Heus, Roel; Mulder, Eduard J H; Visser, Gerard H A\n\n2010-08-09\n\nPreterm birth is strongly associated with neonatal death and long-term neurological morbidity. The purpose of tocolytic drug administration is to postpone threatening preterm delivery for 48 hours to allow maximal effect of antenatal corticosteroids and maternal transportation to a center with specialized neonatal care facilities. There is uncertainty about the value of atosiban (oxytocin receptor antagonist) and nifedipine (calcium channel blocker) as first-line tocolytic drugs in the management of preterm labor. For nifedipine, concerns have been raised about unproven safety, lack of placebo-controlled trials, and its off-label use. The tocolytic efficacy of atosiban has also been questioned because of a lack of reduction in neonatal morbidity. This review discusses the available evidence, the pros and cons of either drug and aims to provide information to support a balanced choice of first-line tocolytic drug: atosiban or nifedipine?\n\nNifedipine--a calcium channel blocker--in asthmatic patients. Interaction with terbutaline.\n\nPubMed\n\nSvedmyr, K; LÃ¶fdahl, C G; Svedmyr, N\n\n1984-01-01\n\nSeven asthmatic patients were studied in a single-blind randomized, crossover study after oral administration of 20 mg nifedipine or placebo. Four increasing doses of i.v. terbutaline were then given with 30 min interval. The study was concluded with inhalation of five terbutaline puffs. FEV1 measurements 30 min after intake of nifedipine did not show any difference compared to placebo. During the terbutaline treatment, however, there was a more pronounced bronchodilation after nifedipine than after placebo (P less than 0.05). Terbutaline-induced skeletal muscle tremor was similar after nifedipine and placebo pretreatments. After nifedipine intake there was a decrease of diastolic blood pressure and a reflexogenic tachycardia. Thus, this study showed a small potentiation of the beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated bronchodilation, which is of importance when treating patients with simultaneous asthma and hypertension or angina pectoris.\n\n[Management of pre-term labor: use of nifedipine in Conakry, Guinea].\n\nPubMed\n\nSy, T; Diallo, F B; Diallo, Y; Camara, M K; Diallo, A; Cissoko, M; Lontsi, G R; Diallo, M S\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThis purpose of this prospective and descriptive study was to evaluate the utility of a calcium-channel inhibitor, i.e. nifedipine, for management of preterm labor in our work setting in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness in comparison with betamimetics classically used for this indication. Study was carried out over a six-month period in the department of Gynecology-Obstetrics Department of Ignace Deen National Hospital in Conakry, Guinea. Pregnant women meeting the following criteria were included: 28 to 33 weeks of amenorrhea, six days of hospitalization either for preterm labor or for another diagnosis that was associated with the occurrence of preterm labor during hospitalization, and absence of contraindications for tocolysis using nifedipine. A total of 42 women were included. Pregnancy was extended for more than 48 hours after the first dose of nifedipine in 86.8% of cases. Administration of nifedipine failed in 5 cases including one case in which it was necessary to change the tocolytic and 4 cases in which delivery occurred less than 48 hours after the first dose of nifedipine. In 68% of cases, 90 mg of nifedipine were sufficient to stop uterine contractions within 48 hours. In 39.5% of cases, no side effects were observed. Adverse effects in the other cases were dizziness (39.5%) and headache (18.4%). The mean term of delivery was 36 weeks +/- 5 days of amenorrhea with a mean extension of 6.2 weeks. Apgar score was low in 30.5% of the newborns and normal in 69.5%. One newborn (2.8%) died. The results of this study indicate that nifedipine is an effective, economical and safe drug for tocolysis and that it can be used as an alternative to betamimetis in countries with limited resources. An information campaign is needed to promote use of nifedipine as a tocolytic in obstetrical facilities of our country.\n\nNifedipine capsules may provide a viable alternative to oral powders for paediatric patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nHelin-Tanninen, M; Naaranlahti, T; Kontra, K; Savolainen, K\n\n2007-02-01\n\nTo compare content uniformities between different sizes of extemporaneously compounded nifedipine oral powders and capsules, in order to find out if capsules could be used instead of oral powders as paediatric medications. Actual content and content uniformity of extemporaneously compounded 1-mg nifedipine oral powders and capsules were evaluated by a high performance liquid chromatographic assay. Capsules and powders were prepared by triturating 10-mg nifedipine tablets with different amounts of lactose or microcrystalline cellulose with a mortar and pestle using a standard geometric dilution technique. Oral powders were weighed individually and capsules were filled by a hand-operated capsule-filling machine. Four different sizes of powders (500, 300, 100 and 50 mg) and three different sizes of capsules (numbers 1, 3 and 4) were prepared. Ten oral powders and 10 capsules from each batch were randomly selected and individually assayed for nifedipine amount. The extemporaneously prepared nifedipine oral powders and capsules were within acceptable limits for content uniformity, as defined by the European Pharmacopoeia, but the results indicate that the loss of nifedipine during the preparation process may be considerable for both preparations. The concentration on nifedipine decreased while the total mass of the oral powder decreased. These results demonstrate that nifedipine oral powders can be replaced by capsules, whose contents are emptied for use, in paediatric medications. Compounding small capsules, such as size number 3 or 4, is acceptable when considering the average drug content. The total weight of the oral powder should be at least 300 mg. The preparation of nifedipine in all studied capsule sizes was safe with either lactose monohydrate or microcrystalline cellulose as excipients. Thus, emptied capsules seem to be a good choice for delivering a paediatric medication. The loss of nifedipine was considerable in oral powders with low total weight.\n\nDa-Chaihu-Tang alters the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine in rats and a treatment regimen to avoid this.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Ju-Xiu; Ohno, Kenji; Tang, Jun; Hattori, Masao; Tani, Tadato; Akao, Teruaki\n\n2014-11-01\n\nTo investigate the influence of co-administrated Da-Chaihu-Tang (DCT; a traditional Chinese formulation) on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine, as well as the safe optimal dosing interval to avoid the adverse interactions. A single dose of DCT was administered with nifedipine simultaneously, 2âh before, 30âmin before or 30âmin after nifedipine administration. Pharmacokinetics of nifedipine with or without DCT were compared. The influences of DCT on nifedipine intestinal mucosal and hepatic metabolism were studied by using rat in-vitro everted jejunal sac model and hepatic microsomes. A simultaneous co-administration of DCT significantly increased the area under concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf ) of nifedipine. In-vitro mechanism investigations revealed that DCT inhibited both the intestinal and the hepatic metabolism of nifedipine. Further study on the optimal dosing interval for nifedipine and DCT revealed that administration of DCT 30âmin before or after nifedipine did not significantly change the AUC of nifedipine. The bioavailability of nifedipine is significantly increased by a simultaneous oral co-administration of DCT. This increase is caused by the inhibitory effect of DCT on both the intestinal mucosal and the hepatic metabolism of nifedipine. The dose interval between DCT and nifedipine needs to be set for over 30âmin to avoid such drug-drug interactions.

If gut microbes are involved in the metabolism of nifedipine, plateau hypoxia may regulate the bioavailability and the therapeutic effect of nifedipine by altering the metabolic activity of the gut microbiota. We herein demonstrated for the first time that gut flora is involved in the metabolism of nifedipine by in vitro experiments. In addition, based on the results of 16S rRNA analysis of feces in rats after acute plateau, we first confirmed that the plateau environment could cause changes in the number and composition of intestinal microbes. More importantly, these changes in flora could lead to a slower metabolic activity of nifedipine in the body after an acute plateau, resulting in increased bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of nifedipine. Our research will provide basis and new ideas for changes in the fecal flora of human acutely entering the plateau, and contribute to rational drug use of nifedipine.\n\nEffect of nifedipine on choroidal blood flow regulation during isometric exercise.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmidl, Doreen; Prinz, Ana; Kolodjaschna, Julia; Polska, Elzbieta; Luksch, Alexandra; Fuchsjager-Mayrl, Gabriele; Garhofer, Gerhard; Schmetterer, Leopold\n\n2012-01-25\n\nTo determine whether nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, alters choroidal blood flow (ChBF) regulation during isometric exercise in healthy subjects. The study was carried out in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, two-way crossover design. Fifteen healthy male subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or nifedipine on two different study days. Subfoveal ChBF was measured with laser Doppler flowmetry while the study participants performed isometric exercise (squatting). This was performed before drug administration and during infusion of nifedipine and placebo, respectively. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured noninvasively, and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) was calculated as &frac23; MAP-IOP. MAP and OPP increased significantly during all squatting periods (P < 0.01). The increase in ChBF was less pronounced than the increase in OPP during isometric exercise. Nifedipine did not alter the OPP increase in response to isometric exercise, but it significantly augmented the exercise-induced increase in ChBF (P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Although ChBF increased by a maximum of 14.2% Â± 9.2% during the squatting period when placebo was administered, the maximum increase during administration of nifedipine was 23.2% Â± 7.2%. In conclusion, the data of the present study suggest that nifedipine augments the ChBF response to an experimental increase in OPP. In addition, it confirms that the choroidal vasculature has a significant regulatory capacity over wide ranges of OPPs during isometric exercise.

J.; Smits, Paul; Lagro-Janssen, Antoine L. M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPURPOSE Nifedipine is commonly prescribed for the treatment of chilblains (pernio, perniosis) on the basis of observational studies and a single small, older clinical trial. We aimed to confirm the proposed superiority of oral nifedipine 60 mg per day over placebo for treatment of chronic chilblains in primary care. METHODS We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial, closely following the design of the older trial. A total of 32 patients with chronic chilblains were randomly assigned to nifedipine (30 mg controlled release twice a day) or placebo. The primary outcome was patient-reported complaints; the secondary outcome was patient-reported disability. Both were assessed from daily ratings on 100-mm visual analogue scales recorded in a diary. We took ambient temperatures into account and checked for a carry-over effect, and monitored for adverse effects. RESULTS After 6 weeks of treatment, mean scores on the visual analogue scale on complaints showed a nonsignificant difference of 1.84 mm (95% CI, â6.67 to 2.99 mm) in favor of nifedipine (P = .44). Mean scores on the visual analogue scale on disability showed a nonsignificant difference of 0.56 mm (95% CI, â2.97 to 4.09 mm) in favor of placebo (P = .75). There was no carry-over effect of prior study treatment. Nifedipine was associated with significantly lower systolic blood pressure and a significantly higher incidence of edema. CONCLUSIONS In our study, nifedipine was not superior to placebo for treating chronic chilblains. These findings contrast with those of the older study and do not support routine use of nifedipine for this condition. PMID:27621162\n\nEvaluating the Teratogenicity of Ritodrine and Nifedipine using a Frog Embryo Teratogenesis assay (FETAX).\n\nPubMed\n\nBoÄa Pekmezekmek, Ayper; Binokay, UÄur SeÃ§il; SeÃ§ilmiÅ, Mehmet Ata; Kumcu, Eda; ÅimÅek, Erhan; AkillioÄlu, KÃ¼bra; Sertdemir, YaÅar; Ãzaykan, Besim\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay-Xenopus (FETAX) was used to assess the teratogenic potential of two tocolytics. Embryos of the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, were exposed to ritodrine or nifedipine. Exposure media were changed and monitored at 24-hour intervals. The 96-hour LC50 (Lethal concentration), the 96-hour EC50 (Malformation), and the No Observable Adverse Effect Concentrations (NOAEC) and the Lowest Observable Adverse Effect Concentration (LOAEC) for mortality, malformation and length were determined for each drug. Nifedipine was determined to be the more toxic and teratogenic than ritodrine, with a LC50 of 0.606âÂµg/L, an EC50 of 0.006âÂµg/L, and a teratogenicity Index (TI) value (LC50/EC50) of 101. On the other hand, the LC50 of ritodrine was 28.571âmg/L. In addition; the LC50, EC50 and TI values for nifedipine in the 5âmg/L ritodrineâ+ânifedipine combination group were determined as 1.050âÂµg/L, 0.868âÂµg/L and 1.5 respectively. For ritodrine, the NOAEC and LOAEC values were determined as 2âmg/L and 4âmg/L, respectively. For the nifedipine and the ritodrineâ+ânifedipine groups; while the LOAEC values of these groups were 0.0001âÂµg/L and 0.1âÂµg/L, respectively. NOAEC value couldn't be determined. Our results demonstrated that nifedipine administration was associated with higher levels of teratogenic and toxic effects. However, the ritodrineâ+ânifedipine combination form reduced the toxic and teratogenic effects of nifedipine on Xenopus embryos. Further studies should be conducted in order to investigate the optimal combination concentrations of these substances for the treatment of preterm labor.\n\nPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between nifedipine and metformin in rats: competitive inhibition for metabolism of nifedipine and metformin by each other via CYP isozymes.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Young H; Lee, Myung G\n\n2012-05-01\n\nIt has been reported that hypertension exponentially increases in the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus, this study was performed to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between nifedipine and metformin, since both drugs were commonly metabolized via hepatic CYP2C and 3A subfamilies in rats. Nifedipine (3 mg/kg) and metformin (100 mg/kg) were simultaneously administered intravenously or orally to rats. Concentrations (I) of each drug in the liver and intestine, maximum velocity (V(max)), Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)), and intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) for the disappearance of each drug, apparent inhibition constant (K(i)) and [I]/K(i) ratios of each drug in liver and intestine were determined. Also the metabolism of each drug in rat and human CYPs and blood pressure were also measured. After the simultaneous single intravenous administration of both drugs together, the AUCs of each drug were significantly greater than that in each drug alone due to the competitive inhibition for the metabolism of nifedipine by metformin via hepatic CYP3A1/2 and of metformin by nifedipine via hepatic CYP2C6 and 3A1/2. After the simultaneous single oral administration of both drugs, the significantly greater AUCs of each drug than that in each drug alone could have mainly been due to the competitive inhibition for the metabolism of nifedipine and metformin by each other via intestinal CYP3A1/2 in addition to competitive inhibition for the hepatic metabolism of each drug as same as the intravenous study.\n\nThe interaction of nifedipine with selected cyclodextrins and the subsequent solubility-permeability trade-off.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeig, Avital; Miller, Jonathan M; Dahan, Arik\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction of 2-hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (HPÎ²CD) and 2,6-dimethyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (DMÎ²CD) with the lipophilic drug nifedipine and to investigate the subsequent solubility-permeability interplay. Solubility curves of nifedipine with HPÎ²CD and DMÎ²CD in MES buffer were evaluated using phase solubility methods. Then, the apparent permeability of nifedipine was investigated as a function of increasing HPÎ²CD/DMÎ²CD concentration in the hexadecane-based PAMPA model. The interaction with nifedipine was CD dependent; significantly higher stability constant was obtained for DMÎ²CD in comparison with HPÎ²CD. Moreover, nifedipine displays different type of interaction with these CDs; a 1:1 stoichiometric inclusion complex was apparent with HPÎ²CD, while 1:2 stoichiometry was apparent for DMÎ²CD. In all cases, decreased apparent intestinal permeability of nifedipine as a function of increasing CD level and nifedipine apparent solubility was obtained. A quasi-equilibrium mass transport analysis was developed to explain this solubility-permeability interplay; the model enabled excellent quantitative prediction of nifedipine's permeability as a function of CD concentrations. This work demonstrates that when using CDs in solubility-enabling formulations, a trade-off exists between solubility increase and permeability decrease that must not be overlooked. This trade-off was found to be independent of the type of CD-drug interaction. The transport model presented here can aid in striking the appropriate solubility-permeability balance in order to achieve optimal overall absorption. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Complete pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 23 of these patients. Blood pressure and heart rate changes were compatible with the known properties of the drug. Impaired renal function did not affect the maximum plasma concentrations or bioavailability of nifedipine after single or multiple dose administration of nifedipine GITS, nor was there any evidence of excessive drug accumulation in the presence of renal impairment.\n\nIs nifedipine a suitable first-line treatment for essential hypertension in general practice?\n\nPubMed\n\nSullivan, F M; Murray, T S; Gaw, N; Langan, J J; Adams-Strump, B J\n\n1987-11-01\n\nNifedipine has been used in hypertension, mainly as a third-line drug for rapid blood pressure reduction, for over 10 years. More recently it has been shown to be effective and safe in reducing mild to moderate blood pressure when used alone in a slow release formulation. A placebo-controlled study investigating the efficacy and safety of nifedipine in comparison with cyclopenthiazide-potassium has now been carried out by 4 general practitioners in the Glasgow area. Ninety-four patients were entered into the study. After a 4-week placebo run-in phase, patients were randomly allocated to receive either slow-release nifedipine 20 mg b.d., or cyclopenthiazide 0.25 mg with 8.1 mmol potassium daily. The dose was doubled at week 8 for non-responders, and at week 12 the alternative drug was added if there was still no response. The patients were studied for up to 28 weeks. Nifedipine was found to have similar blood pressure lowering efficacy to cyclopenthiazide-potassium, but withdrawals from nifedipine due to side-effects at an early stage were more common.\n\nA squeeze-type osmotic tablet for controlled delivery of nifedipine.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Jung Soo; Shin, Jun Hyun; Lee, Dong Hun; Kim, Moon Suk; Rhee, John M; Lee, Hai Bang; Khang, Gilson\n\n2008-01-01\n\nOsmotic delivery systems are based on osmotic driving force. Nifedipine tablets, available under the trade names Procardia XL (Pfizer) and Adalat (Bayer), are commercialized drug-delivery systems of an elemental osmotic pump that the push-pull osmotic tablet operates successfully in delivering water-insoluble drugs. For the improvement of the release pattern and the solubility of the drug, we developed a squeeze-type osmotic tablet (SQT) for nifedipine as a model drug. The SQT was composed of one or more ring type of squeeze-push layer (squeeze-disc) and a centered drug core. Squeeze-discs were stacked up with different physicochemical properties with gradient such as viscosity, swelling ratio and water absorption ratio using the osmotic agents from a disc of bottom to top. The present work investigated the effect of different preparation factors, such as hydrophilic polymers, the molecular weight of polymers, coating process, orifice size and types of excipient on release performance of nifedipine. With the purpose of delivering water-insoluble nifedipine at an approximate zero-order rate and step-function rate for 24 h, SQT has been successfully prepared, and significantly improved in the release rate and patterns in comparison with the Adalat push-pull system in vitro release features.\n\nIsosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine treatment of achalasia: a clinical, manometric and radionuclide evaluation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGelfond, M.; Rozen, P.; Gilat, T.\n\n1982-11-01\n\nThe effects of sublingual isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg) and nifedipine (20 mg) were compared in 15 patients with achalasia. The parameters examined included the manometric measurement of the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, the radionuclide assessment of esophageal emptying and the clinical response. The mean basal lower esophageal sphincter pressure fell significantly after both drugs (p less than 0.01), with a maximum fall of 63.5% 10 min after receiving isosorbide dinitrate, but by only 46.7% 30 min after nifedipine. The esophageal radionuclide test meal retention was significantly less (p less than 0.01) only after receiving isosorbide dinitrate. The drug improved initialmoreÂ Â» esophageal emptying by its effect on the lower esophageal sphincter and by relieving the test meal hold-up noted to occur at the junction of the upper and midesophagus. Eight patients cleared their test meal within 10 min after isosorbide dinitrate administration while only two did so after nifedipine. Subjectively, 13 patients had their dysphagia relieved by isosorbide dinitrate and 8 by nifedipine. However, this relief was not confirmed in 4 patients by the radionuclide study and they, as well as the other 3 patients who did not respond to therapy, were referred to pneumatic dilatation. Side effects were more prominent after nitrates. Three of the patients are currently receiving nifedipine and 5 patients received isosorbide dinitrate therapy for 8-14 mo. The radionuclide test meal is currently the best way of objectively evaluating drug therapy in patients with achalasia. Isosorbide dinitrate is more effective than nifedipine in relieving their symptoms.Â«Â less\n\nLabetalol Versus Nifedipine as Antihypertensive Treatment for Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nWebster, Louise M; Myers, Jenny E; Nelson-Piercy, Catherine; Harding, Kate; Cruickshank, J Kennedy; Watt-Coote, Ingrid; Khalil, Asma; Wiesender, Cornelia; Seed, Paul T; Chappell, Lucy C\n\n2017-11-01\n\nData from randomized controlled trials to guide antihypertensive agent choice for chronic hypertension in pregnancy are limited; this study aimed to compare labetalol and nifedipine, additionally assessing the impact of ethnicity on treatment efficacy. Pregnant women with chronic hypertension (12 +0 -27 +6 weeks' gestation) were enrolled at 4 UK centers (August 2014 to October 2015). Open-label first-line antihypertensive treatment was randomly assigned: labetalol- (200-1800 mg/d) or nifedipine-modified release (20-80 mg/d). Analysis included 112 women (98%) who completed the study (labetalol n=55, nifedipine n=57). Maximum blood pressure after randomization was 161/101 mm Hg with labetalol versus 163/105 mm Hg with nifedipine (mean difference systolic: 1.2 mm Hg [-4.9 to 7.2 mm Hg], diastolic: 3.3 mm Hg [-0.6 to 7.3 mm Hg]). Mean blood pressure was 134/84 mm Hg with labetalol and 134/85 mm Hg with nifedipine (mean difference systolic: 0.3 mm Hg [-2.8 to 3.4 mm Hg], and diastolic: -1.9 mm Hg [-4.1 to 0.3 mm Hg]). Nifedipine use was associated with a 7.4-mm Hg reduction (-14.4 to -0.4 mm Hg) in central aortic pressure, measured by pulse wave analysis. No difference in treatment effect was observed in black women (n=63), but a mean 4 mm Hg reduction (-6.6 to -0.8 mm Hg; P =0.015) in brachial diastolic blood pressure was observed with labetalol compared with nifedipine in non-black women (n=49). Labetalol and nifedipine control mean blood pressure to target in pregnant women with chronic hypertension. This study provides support for a larger definitive trial scrutinizing the benefits and side effects of first-line antihypertensive treatment. URL: https://www.isrctn.com.

However, it remains unknown how nifedipine stimulates urinary iron excretion in the kidney. We speculated that nifedipine might inhibit the TfR1/ DMT1 (transferrin receptor 1/divalent metal transporter1)-mediated iron uptake by proximal tubule cells in addition to blocking L-type Ca2+ channels, leading to an increase in iron in lumen-fluid and then urinary iron excretion. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of nifedipine on iron content and expression of TfR1, DMT1 and ferroportin1 (Fpn1) in WKPT-0293 Cl.2 cells of the S1 segment of the proximal tubule in rats, using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer and Western blot analysis, respectively. We demonstrated for the first time that nifedipine significantly enhanced iron content as well as TfR1 and DMT1 expression and had no effect on Fpn1 levels in the cells. We also found that ferric ammonium citrate decreased TfR1 levels, increased Fpn1 expression and had no effect on DMT1 content, while co-treatment with nifedipine and FAC increase TfR1 and DMT1 expression and also had no effect on Fpn1 levels. These findings suggest that the nifedipine-induced increase in cell iron may mainly be due to the corresponding increase in TfR1 and DMT1 expression and also imply that the effects of nifedipine on iron transport in proximal tubule cells can not explain the increase in urinary iron excretion.

However, some patients develop tachyphylaxis and the fissure fails to heal, suggesting that other agents are needed. This study assesses the effects of nifedipine (a calcium channel antagonist) in modulating resting tone and agonist-induced contractions in human internal anal sphincter (IAS) and rectal circular muscle. Smooth muscle strips from the IAS and rectal circular muscle from ten patients undergoing surgical resection were mounted for isometric tension recording in a superfusion organ bath. The effects of noradrenaline and carbachol were assessed in the presence of various perfusates. LAS strips developed tone and spontaneous activity. Noradrenaline produced dose-dependent contractions. In calcium-free Krebs solution, tone and activity were abolished and no contractions were elicited in response to noradrenaline. Nifedipine also abolished tone and spontaneous activity, but contractions to noradrenaline were only slightly attenuated. In contrast, rectal smooth muscle strips developed spontaneous activity but no resting tone and contracted in response to carbachol. In calcium-free Krebs solution, the spontaneous activity and carbachol contractions were abolished. Addition of nifedipine to the perfusate abolished spontaneous activity and greatly reduced contractions. These data suggest that spontaneous activity and resting tone are dependent on extracellular calcium and flux across the cells. Agonist-induced contraction in the IAS is attributable mainly to the release of calcium from intracellular stores, whereas rectal circular smooth muscle depends principally on extracellular calcium entering the cell for contraction. The attenuation of contractions in both tissues and the abolition of resting tone in the IAS suggest that nifedipine may be useful in the management of patients with anorectal disorders.\n\nCharacterisation of indomethacin and nifedipine using variable-temperature solid-state NMR.\n\nPubMed\n\nApperley, David C; Forster, Angus H; Fournier, Romain; Harris, Robin K; Hodgkinson, Paul; Lancaster, Robert W; Rades, Thomas\n\n2005-11-01\n\nWe have characterised the stable polymorphic forms of two drug molecules, indomethacin (1) and nifedipine (2) by 13C CPMAS NMR and the resonances have been assigned. The signal for the C-Cl carbon of indomethacin has been studied as a function of applied magnetic field, and the observed bandshapes have been simulated. Variable-temperature 1H relaxation measurements of static samples have revealed a T1rho minimum for indomethacin at 17.8 degrees C. The associated activation energy is 38 kJ mol(-1). The relevant motion is probably an internal rotation and it is suggested that this involves the C-OCH3 group. Since the two drug compounds are potential candidates for formulation in the amorphous state, we have examined quench-cooled melts in detail by variable-temperature 13C and 1H NMR. There is a change in slope for T1H and T1rhoH at the glass transition temperature (Tg) for indomethacin, but this occurs a few degrees below Tg for nifedipine, which is perhaps relevant to the lower real-time stability of the amorphous form for the latter compound. Comparison of relaxation time data for the crystalline and amorphous forms of each compound reveals a greater difference for nifedipine than for indomethacin, which again probably relates to real-time stabilities. Recrystallisation of the two drugs has been followed by proton bandshape measurements at higher temperatures. It is shown that, under the conditions of the experiments, recrystallisation of nifedipine can be detected already at 70 degrees C, whereas this does not occur until 110 degrees C for indomethacin. The effect of crushing the amorphous samples has been studied by 13C NMR; nifedipine recrystallises but indomethacin does not. The results were supported by DSC, powder XRD, FTIR and solution-state NMR measurements.

Dry powder aerosols are of great interest compared to traditional aerosolized liquid formulations in that they may offer improved stability, ease of administration, and simple device design. Particles 1â5 Âµm in size typically facilitate lung deposition. Nanoparticles may be exhaled as a result of their small size; however, they are desired to enhance the dissolution rate of poorly soluble drugs. Nanoparticles of the hypertension drug nifedipine were co-precipitated with stearic acid to form a colloid exhibiting negative surface charge. Nifedipine nanoparticle colloids were destabilized by using sodium chloride to disrupt the electrostatic repulsion between particles as a means to achieve the agglomerated nanoparticles of a controlled size. The aerodynamic performance of agglomerated nanoparticles was determined by cascade impaction. The powders were found to be well suited for pulmonary delivery. In addition, nanoparticle agglomerates revealed enhanced dissolution of the drug species suggesting the value of this formulation approach for poorly water soluble pulmonary medicines. Ultimately, nifedipine powders are envisioned as an approach to treat pulmonary hypertension.

After successful intravenous tocolysis with magnesium sulfate, 69 women with preterm labor at <35 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to nifedipine (20 mg orally every 4-6 hr), or diltiazem (30-60 mg orally every 4-6 hr). The primary outcome was the percentage of patients achieving 37 weeks gestation. Maternal cardiovascular alterations and neonatal outcomes were also assessed. Sixty-nine patients were available for final analysis. Less patients on diltiazem as compared to nifedipine achieved 37 weeks (15.1% vs. 41.7%, P = 0.019). Gestational age at delivery was also less for patients receiving diltiazem (35.5 +/- 3.5 weeks vs. 33.4 +/- 3.9 weeks, P = 0.022). There were fewer days gained in utero from randomization to delivery with diltiazem as compared to nifedipine; however, this difference was not statistically significant (22.4 +/- 16.3 days vs. 31.2 +/- 24.4 days, P = 0.084). Maternal blood pressure and pulse during tocolysis did not differ significantly between groups. Despite the theoretical advantages of diltiazem tocolysis, maintenance tocolysis with diltiazem offered no benefit over nifedipine in achieving 37 weeks gestation. The cardiovascular alterations with either drug in normotensive, pregnant patients appear minimal.\n\nAngiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in chronic stable angina: effects on myocardial ischaemia and comparison with nifedipine.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIkram, H.; Low, C. J.; Shirlaw, T. M.; Foy, S. G.; Crozier, I. G.; Richards, A. M.; Khurmi, N. S.; Horsburgh, R. J.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVES--To determine the anti-ischaemic effects of a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril, compared with nifedipine, alone and in combination, in chronic stable angina caused by coronary artery disease. DESIGN--Placebo controlled, double blind, latin square design. SETTING--Regional cardiology service for a mixed urban and rural population. SUBJECTS--40 patients with stable exertional angina producing at least 1 mm ST segment depression on exercise test with the Bruce protocol. 34 patients completed all four phases of the trial. INTERVENTIONS--Each patient was treated with placebo, benazepril (10 mg twice daily), nifedipine retard (20 mg twice daily), and a combination of benazepril and nifedipine in the same doses, in random order for periods of two weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--Total duration of exercise was not increased by any treatment. Exercise time to the development of 1 mm ST segment depression was not significantly changed with benazepril alone or in combination with nifedipine but was increased with nifedipine from 4.18 (1.8) min to 4.99 (1.6) min (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.28 to 1.34; p < 0.05). There was a significant relation between increase in duration of exercise and resting renin concentration (r = 0.498; p < 0.01). Myocardial ischaemia during daily activity, as assessed by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, was reduced by benazepril and by the benazepril and nifedipine combination. This was significant for total ischaemic burden (451(628) min v 231(408) min; 95% CI -398 to -41 min; p < 0.05) and maximal depth of ST segment depression (-2.47(1.2) mm v -2.16 mm; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57; p < 0.05) for the combination and for maximal ST segment depth for benazepril monotherapy (-2.47 (1.2) mm v -1.96(1.2) mm; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.91; p < 0.05). Benazepril significantly altered the circadian rhythm of cardiac ischaemia, abolishing the peak ischaemic periods at 0700 to 1200 and 1700 to 2300 (p < 0\n\nQuercetin, an in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A, does not contribute to the interaction between nifedipine and grapefruit juice.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRashid, J; McKinstry, C; Renwick, A G; Dirnhuber, M; Waller, D G; George, C F\n\n1993-01-01\n\nQuercetin, a flavonoid present in various fruits, is a potent in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A. Its role in the reported interaction between grapefruit juice and nifedipine has been determined in vivo in humans. Eight healthy volunteers were given in random order 10 mg nifedipine orally, either alone or with 200 ml double strength grapefruit juice, or with 400 mg quercetin. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for nifedipine with grapefruit juice (mean 320 ng ml(-1) h) was increased significantly (P < 0.01) compared with the AUC when nifedipine was given alone (mean 218 ng ml(-1) h). The time to peak plasma concentration for nifedipine with grapefruit juice (1.5 h) was also increased (P < 0.05) compared with control (0.5 h) suggesting delayed absorption. Although quercetin delayed the time to peak nifedipine concentration (1.3 h) it did not alter the AUC of either the parent drug (mean 209 ng ml(-1) h) or its first-pass metabolite. The results suggest that quercetin does not contribute to the effects of grapefruit juice (which contains <10 mg of quercetin 200 ml(-1)) on the metabolism of nifedipine. Oral doses of quercetin, similar to those possible from the ingestion of other fruits such as strawberries, do not produce in vivo inhibition of CYP3A mediated metabolism of nifedipine.

Since PPARÎ³ agonists, such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, are effective in reducing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis in animal models, we examined the protective effects of nifedipine, as compared with bezafibrate, a PPARÎ± agonist, in a NASH model induced by an L-methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet. An MCD diet for 20 weeks changed the color of the rat liver to yellow with an irregular surface, whereas the color of the liver in both the bezafibrate and nifedipine treatment groups was markedly changed to yellow-brown with a smooth surface. Furthermore, nifedipine, as well as bezafibrate, significantly prevented liver fibrosis induced by an MCD diet, as assessed by Masson's trichrome staining, accompanied by a significant decrease in serum AST. Overall, nifedipine treatment resulted in an improvement in NASH, similar to bezafibrate, in a rat model. In hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome, nifedipine may provide additional benefits, beyond its blood pressure-lowering effects, to prevent NASH and fatty liver disease.\n\nModelling nifedipine photodegradation, photostability and actinometric properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaafi, Wassila; Maafi, Mounir\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThe photodegradation of drugs obeying unimolecular mechanisms such as that of nifedipine (NIF) were usually characterised in the literature by zero-, first- and second-order kinetics. This approach has been met with varying success. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a novel approach for unimolecular photodegradation kinetics. The photodegradation of the cardiovascular drug nifedipine is investigated within this framework. Experimental kinetic data of nifedipine photodegradation were obtained by continuous monochromatic irradiation and DAD analysis. Fourth-order Runge-Kutta calculated kinetic data served for the validation of the new semi-empirical integrated rate-law model proposed in this study. A new model equation has been developed and proposed which faithfully describes the kinetic behaviour of NIF in solution for non-isosbestic irradiations at wavelengths where both NIF and its photoproduct absorb. NIF absolute quantum yield values were determined and found to increase with irradiation wavelength according to a defined sigmoid relationship. The effects of increasing NIF or excipients' concentrations on NIF kinetics were successfully modelled and found to improve NIF photostability. The potential of NIF for actinometry has been explored and evaluated. A new reaction order (the so-called Î¦-order) has been identified and specifically proposed for unimolecular photodegradation reactions. The semi-empirical and integrated rate-law models facilitated reliable kinetic studies of NIF photodegradation as an example of AB(1Î¦) unimolecular reactions. It allowed filling a gap in kinetic studies of drugs since, thus far, thermal first-order or a combination of first- and zero- order kinetic equations were generally applied for drug photoreactions in the literature. Also, a new reaction order, the \"Î¦-order\", has been evidenced and proposed as a specific alternative for photodegradation kinetics. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, the chelating structures and energetic characters of nifedipine-Ca(2+) in the gas phase are explored, and 25 isomers are found. The most favorable chelating mode is a tridentate one, that is, Ca(2+) binds to two carbonyl O atoms and one nitryl O atom, where Ca(2+) is above the plane of the three O atoms to form a pyramidal structure. Accurate geometric structures, relative stabilities, vertical and adiabatic binding energies, and charge distributions are discussed. The differences in the geometries and energies among these isomers are analyzed from the contributions of chelating sites, electrostatics and polarizations, steric repulsions, and charge distributions. The interconversions among isomers with similar geometries and energies are also investigated because of the importance of the geometric transformation in the biological system. Furthermore, certain numbers of water molecules are added to the nifedipine-Ca(2+) system to probe the effect of water. A detailed study is performed on the hydrated geometries on the basis of the most stable isomer 1. Stepwise hydration can weaken the nifedipine-Ca(2+) interaction, and the chelating sites of nifedipine are gradually replaced by the added water molecules. Hexacoordination is found to be the most favorable geometry no matter how many water molecules were added, which can be verified by the MD simulations. The transfer of water molecules from the inner shell to the outer shell is also supported by MD simulations of the hexahydrated complexes.\n\nImpact of tamsulosin and nifedipine on contractility of pregnant rat ureters in vitro.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaddad, Lisette; Corriveau, StÃ©phanie; Rousseau, Eric; Blouin, Simon; Pasquier, Jean-Charles; Ponsot, Yves; Roy-Lacroix, Marie-Ãve\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the in vitro effect of tamsulosin and nifedipine on the contractility of pregnant rat ureters and to perform quantitative analysis of the pharmacological effects. Medical expulsive therapy (MET) is commonly used to treat urolithiasis. However, this treatment is seldom used in pregnant women since no studies support this practice. This was an in vitro study on animal tissue derived from pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. A total of 124 ureteral segments were mounted in an organ bath system and contractile response to methacholine (MCh) was assessed. Tamsulosin or nifedipine were added at cumulative concentrations (0.001-1âÎ¼M). The area under the curve (AUC) from isometric tension measurements was calculated. The effect of pharmacological agents and the respective controls were assessed by calculating the AUC for each 5-min interval. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Both drugs displayed statistically significant inhibitory activity at concentrations of 0.1 and 1âÎ¼M for tamsulosin and 1âÎ¼M for nifedipine when calculated as the AUC as compared to DMSO controls. Tamsulosin and nifedipine directly inhibit MCh-induced contractility of pregnant rat ureters. Further work is needed to determine the clinical efficacy of these medications for MET in pregnancy.\n\nThe blockade of excitation/contraction coupling by nifedipine in patch-clamped rat skeletal muscle cells in culture.\n\nPubMed\n\nCognard, C; Rivet, M; Raymond, G\n\n1990-04-01\n\nThe effects of the dihydropyridine derivative, nifedipine, well known as a blocker of calcium channels, were tested on cultured rat myoballs. Membrane currents and contractions were simultaneously recorded by means of the patch-clamp technique and a photoelectric transducing method. High concentrations of nifedipine (5 microM) inhibited the contractile responses and inward calcium current (ICa) elicited by long depolarizations. In the absence of ICa (1.5 mM cadmium in the bath), nifedipine inhibited both the ICa-independent contractile component and the outward current, supposed to depend on the intracellular calcium released during contraction. At low concentrations (0.5 microM) the blocking effects of nifedipine could be strongly enhanced by shifting the membrane potential towards less negative values (-60 mV) for 50 s prior to the test pulse. A blocking effect of nifedipine, at a usually ineffective concentration (0.1 microM), could also be observed when long-lasting (3 min) prepulses to 0 mV were applied from a reference membrane potential of -60 mV. This effect could be relieved by long-lasting cell hyperpolarizations (-90 mV). The blocking effects of nifedipine unrelated to ICa could be interpreted as an action on a molecule (voltage sensor) in the T-tubule membrane involved in the excitation/contraction coupling process and as a preferential binding of the dihydropyridine derivative on the inactivated form of this molecule, favored by the weak negative potentials or long-lasting depolarizations. The results provide data in favor of the existence of strong similarities between the calcium channels and voltage sensors since their operation was inhibited in a voltage-dependent manner by nifedipine.\n\nEthnic differences in nifedipine kinetics: comparisons between Nigerians, Caucasians and South Asians.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSowunmi, A; Rashid, T J; Akinyinka, O O; Renwick, A G\n\n1995-01-01\n\nNifedipine was administered to 12 healthy Nigerian volunteers as a single oral dose of 20 mg capsule under fasting conditions. The pharmacokinetic results were compared with published data using the same protocol and analytical method for 27 Caucasians and 30 South Asians. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of nifedipine in Nigerians (808 +/- 250 ng ml-1 h) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that in Caucasians (323 +/- 116 ng ml-1 h) and the difference remained significant (P < 0.001) when corrected for body weight. The elimination half-life was also significantly higher (P < 0.01) in Nigerians (5.03 +/- 1.96 h) than in Caucasians (2.78 +/- 1.11 h). No significant differences were observed between Nigerians and South Asians in either AUC or half-life of nifedipine. The AUC of the nitropyridine metabolite was higher (P < 0.01) in Nigerians (220 +/- 51 ng ml-1 h) compared with that in Caucasians (154 +/- 56 ng ml-1 h) but the difference was not maintained when corrected for body weight. The AUC corrected for body weight and the elimination half-life of the metabolite were significantly higher in South Asians compared with those of Nigerians and Caucasians. The pharmacokinetics of oral nifedipine in Nigerians were similar to those in South Asians and therefore may also arise from a lower systemic clearance compared with Caucasians as has been reported previously for South Asians.

For this reason, tocolytics are often administered for 48 h; however, there is no consensus about which drug results in the best maternal and neonatal outcomes. In the APOSTEL III trial we aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine and the oxytocin inhibitor atosiban in women with threatened preterm birth. We did this multicentre, randomised controlled trial in ten tertiary and nine teaching hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium. Women with threatened preterm birth (gestational age 25-34 weeks) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either oral nifedipine or intravenous atosiban for 48 h. An independent data manager used a web-based computerised programme to randomly assign women in permuted block sizes of four, with groups stratified by centre. Clinicians, outcome assessors, and women were not masked to treatment group. The primary outcome was a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes, which included perinatal mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and necrotising enterocolitis. Analysis was done in all women and babies with follow-up data. The study is registered at the Dutch Clinical Trial Registry, number NTR2947. Between July 6, 2011, and July 7, 2014, we randomly assigned 254 women to nifedipine and 256 to atosiban. Primary outcome data were available for 248 women and 297 babies in the nifedipine group and 255 women and 294 babies in the atosiban group. The primary outcome occurred in 42 babies (14%) in the nifedipine group and in 45 (15%) in the atosiban group (relative risk [RR] 0Â·91, 95% CI 0Â·61-1Â·37). 16 (5%) babies died in the nifedipine group and seven (2%) died in the atosiban group (RR 2Â·20, 95% CI 0Â·91-5Â·33); all deaths were deemed unlikely to be related to the study drug.

DMD is characterized in humans and in mdx mice by a severe and progressive destruction of muscle fibers, inflammation, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and cell death. In mdx muscle fibers, we have shown that basal ATP release is increased and that extracellular ATP stimulation is pro-apoptotic. In normal fibers, depolarization-induced ATP release is blocked by nifedipine, leading us to study the potential therapeutic effect of nifedipine in mdx muscles and its relation with extracellular ATP signaling. Acute exposure to nifedipine (10 ÂµM) decreased [Ca(2+)]r, NF-ÎºB activity and iNOS expression in mdx myotubes. In addition, 6-week-old mdx mice were treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of nifedipine, 1 mg/Kg for 1 week. This treatment lowered the [Ca(2+)]r measured in vivo in the mdx vastus lateralis. We demonstrated that extracellular ATP levels were higher in adult mdx flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers and can be significantly reduced after 1 week of treatment with nifedipine. Interestingly, acute treatment of mdx FDB fibers with apyrase, an enzyme that completely degrades extracellular ATP to AMP, reduced [Ca(2+)]r to a similar extent as was seen in FDB fibers after 1-week of nifedipine treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated that nifedipine treatment reduced mRNA levels of pro-oxidative/nitrosative (iNOS and gp91(phox)/p47(phox) NOX2 subunits) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) genes in mdx diaphragm muscles and lowered serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. In addition, nifedipine treatment increased muscle strength assessed by the inverted grip-hanging test and exercise tolerance measured with forced swimming test in mdx mice. We hypothesize that nifedipine reduces basal ATP release, thereby decreasing purinergic receptor activation, which in turn reduces [Ca(2+)]r in mdx skeletal muscle cells.

This study aimed to investigate the changes in biochemical and biophysical properties of heart mitochondria induced by captopril and nifedipine antihypertensive treatment. Materials and Methods: Male, 12-week-old Wistar rats in two experimental models (in vivo and in vitro) were used. In four groups, the effects of escalating doses of captopril, nifedipine and combination of captopril + nifedipine added to the incubation medium (in vitro) or administered per os to rat (in vivo) on mitochondrial ATP synthase activity and membrane fluidity were monitored. Results: In the in vitro model we observed a significant inhibitory effect of treatment on the ATP synthase activity (P<0.05) with nonsignificant differences in membrane fluidity. Decrease in the value of maximum reaction rate Vmax (P<0.05) without any change in the value of Michaelis-Menten constant Km, indicative of a noncompetitive inhibition, was presented. At the in vivo level, we did not demonstrate any significant changes in the ATP synthase activity and the membrane fluidity in rats receiving captopril, nifedipine, and combined therapy. Conclusion: In vitro kinetics study revealed that antihypertensive drugs (captopril and nifedipine) directly interact with mitochondrial ATP synthase. In vivo experiment did not prove any acute effect on myocardial bioenergetics and suggest that drugs do not enter cardiomyocyte and have no direct effect on mitochondria.

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, women with a singleton fetus in breech presentation and a gestational age of 36 weeks or more were eligible for enrollment. Participating women received two doses of either nifedipine 10 mg or placebo, 30 and 15 minutes before the external cephalic version attempt. The primary outcome was a cephalic-presenting fetus immediately after the procedure. Secondary outcome measures were cephalic presentation at delivery, mode of delivery, and adverse events. A sample size of 292 was calculated to provide 80% power to detect a 17% improvement of the external cephalic version success rate, assuming a placebo group rate of 40% and alpha of .05. Outcome data for 310 of 320 randomly assigned participants revealed no significant difference in external cephalic version success rates between treatment (42%) and control group (37%) (relative risk 1.1, 95%; 95% confidence interval 0.85-1.5). The cesarean delivery rate was 51% in the treatment group and 46% in the control group (relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.4). Nifedipine did not significantly improve the success of external cephalic version. Future use of nifedipine to improve the outcome of external cephalic version should be limited to large clinical trials.\n\nEffect of nifedipine on atrioventricular conduction as compared with verapamil. Intracardiac electrophysiological study.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRowland, E; Evans, T; Krikler, D\n\n1979-01-01\n\nIntravenous nifedipine, a powerful calcium antagonist, had no obvious effect on atrioventricular conduction when administered to 11 patients during routine intracardiac electrophysiological studies. Verapamil on the other hand showed potent antiarrhythmic properties, depressing atrioventricular nodal conduction. Nifedipine thus appears safe in patients with angina pectoris who have disorders of atrioventricular nodal conduction, and in those receiving beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. There appear to be differential effects on the slow inward channels of cardiac cells with different 'calcium antagonists'.

The cardiomyoblasts were treated in 24 or 96-well plates (according to the test being performed) and maintaining the treatment until the end of hypoxia induction. The molecules were tested at concentrations of 10 and 100Î¼M, cells were treated 24h after assembling the experimental plates and immediately before the I/R. Cell viability, apoptosis and necrosis, and generation of reactive oxygen species were evaluated. Nifedipine and 3,5-dipalmitoyl-nifedipine were used to assess radical scavenging potential and metal chelation. All tested molecules managed to reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species compared to the starvation+vehicle group. In in vitro assays, 3,5-dipalmitoyl-nifedipine showed more antioxidant activity than nifedipine. These results indicate the ability of this molecule to act as a powerful ROS scavenger. Cell viability was highest when cells were induced to I/R by both concentrations of anandamide and the higher concentration of DPN. These treatments also reduced cell death. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the process of hybridization of nifedipine with two palmitic acid chains assigns a greater cardioprotective effect to this molecule, thereby reducing the damage caused by hypoxia and reoxygenation in cardiomyoblast cultures.

Mean circulatory filling pressure (Pmcf) was determined during transient circulatory arrest induced by acetylcholine at baseline circulating blood volumes and after increases of 5 and 10 mL/kg. Central blood volumes (pulmonary artery to aortic root) were determined from transit times, and separately determined cardiac outputs (right atrium to pulmonary artery) were estimated by thermodilution. Nifedipine (n = 5) increased Pmcf at all circulating blood volumes and reduced total vascular capacitance without a change in total vascular compliance. Central blood volume, right atrial pressure, and cardiac output were increased with induced increases in circulating blood volume. In contrast, captopril (n = 5) did not alter total vascular capacitance, central blood volume, right atrial pressure, or cardiac output at baseline or with increased circulating volume. Thus, at doses producing similar reductions in arterial pressure, nifedipine but not captopril increased venous return and cardiac output in ganglion-blocked dogs.\n\nRegression of nifedipine-induced gingival hyperplasia following switch to a same class calcium channel blocker, isradipine.\n\nPubMed\n\nWestbrook, P; Bednarczyk, E M; Carlson, M; Sheehan, H; Bissada, N F\n\n1997-07-01\n\nPatients with nifedipine-induced gingival hyperplasia (GH) often require continued calcium channel blocker therapy. Switches to diltiazem and verapamil have been described; however, these drugs are of a different chemical class and present therapeutic limitations in some patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on nifedipine-induced GH of a switch to a dihydropyridine derivative with a low incidence of GH. Fourteen patients with nifedipine-induced GH were given a medical exam and a periodontal exam. The following parameters were assessed: probing depth (PD), gingival margin (GM), gingival thickness (GT), plaque index (PI), and gingival index (GI). Intraoral photographs, study models, and a gingival biopsy for histological examination were taken. Following baseline measures, patients were randomized to continued treatment with nifedipine or an equivalent dose of isradipine in a single-blind fashion. Biweekly periodontal parameters were taken for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, some patients elected to receive 4 weeks of open label isradipine therapy, with biweekly examination continuing through the open label phase. The isradipine treatment arm showed a mean decrease in PD of 0.59 mm at week 8 (P < 0.05). No other measured parameter (GM, GT, PI, GI) was significantly changed, compared either to baseline or to the alternate treatment arm. Clinically, 60% of patients treated with isradipine exhibited a decrease in hyperplasia, while 66% of patients treated with nifedipine demonstrated an increase in hyperplasia, a significant difference (P < 0.05). When combined with open label data, patients switching therapy to isradipine exhibited an increase in GM (increase in recession) of 0.74 mm from baseline to week 12 (P < 0.05). No patients treated with isradipine exhibited an increase in gingival overgrowth. All patients exhibited adequate control of hypertension. We conclude that in hypertensive patients with nifedipine-induced GH, switching\n\nEffect of nifedipine and atosiban on perinatal brain injury: secondary analysis of the APOSTEL-III trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nNijman, T A J; Goedhart, M M; Naaktgeboren, C N; de Haan, T R; Vijlbrief, D C; Mol, B W; Benders, M J N; Franx, A; Oudijk, M A\n\n2018-06-01\n\nBrain injury in neonates born prematurely is associated strongly with poor neurodevelopmental outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether tocolysis with nifedipine or atosiban in women with threatened preterm birth can reduce the incidence of overall brain injury in neonates born prematurely. This was a secondary analysis of the APOSTEL-III trial (Dutch Clinical Trial Registry, no. NTR2947), a randomized clinical trial in which women with threatened preterm labor between 25 and 34âweeks of gestation were allocated to treatment with nifedipine or atosiban. In this secondary analysis, women delivered at â¤â32âweeks of gestational age in the two main contributing centers were included. Primary outcome was the presence of neonatal brain injury, which was defined as presence of abnormalities on ultrasound investigation and classified into mild and severe. To evaluate type and severity of brain injury, all neonatal ultrasounds performed during neonatal intensive and medium care admission were analyzed. To test the robustness of our results, a sensitivity analysis was performed assessing differences in baseline or known risk factors for brain injury. A total of 117 neonates (from 102 women) were studied, of which 51 had been exposed to nifedipine and 66 to atosiban. Brain injury was observed in 22 (43.1%) neonates in the nifedipine group compared with 37 (56.1%) in the atosiban group (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.29-1.24). Presence of mild brain injury was comparable between the nifedipine (33.3%) and atosiban (48.5%) groups (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25-1.13). Severe brain injury was also comparable between the groups, observed in 9.8% of neonates in the nifedipine vs 7.6% of those in the atosiban group (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.36-4.85). Intraventricular hemorrhage (â¥âGrade I) was the most frequently seen ultrasound abnormality, observed in 18 (35.3%) neonates in the nifedipine group vs 25 (37.9%) in the atosiban group (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.42-1.91).

A randomized and multicenter study assessing the tocolytic effect of nifedipine versus fenoterol in patients admitted to the participating maternity units with a diagnosis of TPL and a cost-savings study for economic assessment. For a power of 80% and an Î± error equal to 0.05, 132 consecutive patients were recruited during the study period; 66 patients were assigned to each group. A Ï(2) analysis and a mean differences test were performed according to variable types and survival curves per intention-to-treat. Demographics were similar in both groups. The latency period was similar in both groups (26.7 vs. 25.6; p = 0.3). There were no differences in the results obtained. Nifedipine failed more frequently to obtain tocolysis when used as a first-line agent (80 vs. 90%, p = 0.0001). The group treated with fenoterol showed more drug adverse events (57.8 vs. 19.0%, p = 0.0001). The economic assessment did not evidence a significant difference in terms of cost savings between groups treated with either drug. The present study failed to demonstrate either clinical or economic superiority of any of the two drugs used in TPL management. The highest failure percentage of nifedipine when used as a first-line agent should encourage further research. Copyright Â© 2012 S.

Thin amorphous films of nifedipine and felodipine and amorphous molecular level solid dispersions with PVP were stored at various relative humidities (RH) and the nucleation rate was measured. The amount of water sorbed at each RH was measured using isothermal vapor sorption and glass transition temperatures (Tg) were determined using differential scanning calorimetry. The solubility of each compound in methyl pyrrolidone was measured as a function of water content. Nifedipine crystallizes more easily than felodipine at any given polymer concentration and in the presence of moisture. The glass transition temperatures of each compound, alone and in the presence of PVP, are statistically equivalent at any given water content. The nifedipine systems are significantly more hygroscopic than the corresponding felodipine systems. Variations in the physical stability of the two compounds could not be explained by differences in Tg. However, the relative physical stability is consistent with differences in the degree of supersaturation of each drug in the solid dispersion, treating the polymer and water as a co-solvent system for each drug compound.\n\nThe photobase generator nifedipine as a novel matrix for the detection of polyphenols in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nNguyen, Huu-Nghi; Tanaka, Mitsuru; Komabayashi, Genki; Matsui, Toshiro\n\n2016-10-01\n\nMatrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is widely used for the detection and analysis of ionizable compounds. However, the method has less potential for the analysis of neutral compounds, such as polyphenols, owing to their lack of favorable proton-attachment or -removal groups. In this study, we reported for the first time that nifedipine (2,6-dimethyl-3,5-dicarbomethoxy-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine), which is a strong photobase generator commonly used in polymerization, can abstract protons from neutral compounds in negative mode-MALDI experiments. When nifedipine (5âmg/ml) was used as a matrix reagent, the limit of detection (LOD) for epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) was determined to be 100âfmol/spot, which constitutes >50-fold improvement compared to the LOD obtained when trans-3-indoleacrylic acid, a matrix reagent previously reported for polyphenol detection, was used. Of the dihydropyridines investigated, only nifedipine facilitated the detection of EGCG, suggesting that the nitrosophenyl pyridine derivative of nifedipine formed by photoreduction under laser irradiation at 355ânm plays a crucial role in detecting polyphenols in negative mode. Reduced MS detection of 5-O-methylnaringenin indicated that nifedipine may preferably remove a proton from the 5-position OH group in the A ring of the flavonoid skeleton. The significant MS detection by nifedipine was extensively observed for polyphenols including flavones, flavonones, chalcones, stilbenoids and phenolic acids. In conclusion, nifedipine can act as a novel matrix for improving polyphenol detection by MALDI-MS in negative mode. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Four DoE models were applied to optimize formulation parameters for the preparation of pH sensitive nifedipine nanoparticles. Stability studies were performed on the optimized formulations to monitor any possible variation in particle size distribution, homogeneity index, surface charge and drug release (pH 1.2 and pH 6.8). Stability studies were performed for 3 months at 4Â°C, 25Â°C and 40Â°C. A combination of Eudragit Â® L 100-55 and polyvinyl alcohol was determined to be the most effective in stabilizing the nanoparticle suspension. The average particle size distribution, polydispersity index and surface charge of the optimized pH sensitive nifedipine nanoparticles were determined to be 131.86Â±8.21nm, 0.135Â±0.008 and -7.631Â±0.146mV, respectively. Following three months storage, it was observed that the formulations stored at 4Â°C were stable in terms of particle size distribution, polydispersity index, surface charge, drug loading and drug release, whereas those stored at 25Â°C and 40Â°C were relatively unstable. A predictive model to prepare stable pH sensitive nifedipine nanoparticles, was successfully developed using multiple linear regression analysis. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 7395 patients were included in 564 outpatient clinics. Patients received 30mg or 60mg of nifedipine GITS, which could be up- and down-titrated if necessary. Efficacy, safety and tolerability data were collected at up to three follow-up visits. Patient documentation was completed using standardised and barcoded case report forms. Descriptive and explorative analyses of the data were performed. At endpoint, 93% of patients were receiving 30mg of nifedipine GITS and 7% were taking 60mg of nifedipine GITS. The mean observation period was 9 +/- 7 weeks. At endpoint, the mean BP reduction was 27.7/14.8mm Hg; 43% of patients had a systolic BP <140mm Hg, and 58% had a diastolic BP <90mm Hg. BP control as recommended by international guidelines was achieved in 43.5% of all patients. A total of 3163 patients (42.8%) received additional antihypertensive medication, of which ACE inhibitors were most commonly used (40.7%), followed by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (25.8%).Twenty-nine patients (0.4%) experienced a total of 39 adverse events. Subjective physicians' assessments of efficacy, tolerability and patient acceptance of nifedipine GITS treatment returned ratings of 'very good' and 'good' in 91-95% of each category. Nifedipine GITS proved to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of hypertension in 7395 Chinese patients under normal daily practice conditions.

A 16-week, double-blind, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of controlled release nifedipine (nifedipine CR) plus valsartan vs. that of amlodipine plus valsartan. The primary endpoint was the target blood pressure achievement rate. Eligible patients were randomly allocated to nifedipine CR-based or amlodipine-based treatment groups. Patients were examined every 4 weeks to determine whether the blood pressure had reached the target level. When the target level was not achieved, the drug regimen was changed; when the target blood pressure was achieved, the same study medication was continued. A total of 505 patients were enrolled in the study (nifedipine CR group: 245 cases; amlodipine group: 260 cases). After 16 weeks of treatment, blood pressure was significantly reduced in both groups, but to a larger extent in the nifedipine CR group than in the amlodipine group (p < 0.01). The target blood pressure achievement rate was also significantly higher in the nifedipine CR group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of drug-related adverse events between the groups. These results indicate that the nifedipine CR-based combination therapy was superior to the amlodipine-based therapy for decreasing blood pressure and achieving the target blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension.\n\nAcute treatment of hypertensive crisis with nifedipine.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuysmans, F T; Sluiter, H E; Thien, T A; Koene, R A\n\n1983-01-01\n\nTen patients with a hypertensive crisis and a decreased renal function were treated with 10 (n = 7) or 20 (n = 3) mg nifedipine sublingually.

We have previously found that nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the AGE-induced mesangial cell damage in vitro. However, effects of nifedipine on proximal tubular cell injury remain unknown. We examined here whether and how nifedipine blocked the AGE-induced tubular cell damage. Nifedipine, but not amlodipine, a control CCB, inhibited the AGE-induced up-regulation of RAGE mRNA levels in tubular cells, which was prevented by the simultaneous treatment of GW9662, an inhibitor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-{gamma} (PPAR{gamma}). GW9662 treatment alone was found to increase RAGE mRNA levels in tubular cells. Further, nifedipine inhibited the AGE-induced reactive oxygen species generation, NF-{kappa}B activation and increases in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and transforming growth factor-beta gene expression in tubular cells, all of which were blocked by GW9662. Our present study provides a unique beneficial aspect of nifedipine on diabetic nephropathy; it could work as an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory agent against AGEs in tubular cells by suppressing RAGE\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis of hypertension treatment: controlled release nifedipine and candesartan low-dose combination therapy in patients with essential hypertension--the Nifedipine and Candesartan Combination (NICE-Combi) Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFujikawa, Keita; Hasebe, Naoyuki; Kikuchi, Kenjiro\n\n2005-07-01\n\nSocietal interest in pharmaco-economic analysis is increasing in Japan. In this study, the cost-effectiveness of low-dose combination therapy with controlled release nifedipine plus candesartan and up-titrated monotherapy with candesartan was estimated, based on the results of the NICE-Combi study. The NICE-Combi study was a double-blind, parallel arm, randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of low-dose combination therapy of controlled release nifedipine (20 mg/day) plus candesartan (8 mg/day) vs. up-titrated monotherapy of candesartan (12 mg/day) on blood pressure control in Japanese patients with mild to severe essential hypertension who were not sufficiently controlled by the conventional dose of candesartan (8 mg/ day). The incremental cost effectiveness of each cohort during the 8-week randomization period was compared, from the perspective of a third-party payer (i.e., insurers). The average total cost per patient was 29,943 Japanese yen for the combination therapy group and 33,182 Japanese yen for the candesartan monotherapy group, while the rate of achievement of the target blood pressure was significantly higher in the combination therapy group than in the up-titrated monotherapy group. In the combination therapy group, higher efficacy and lower incremental treatment cost (\"Dominance\") were observed when compared to the monotherapy group. The sensitivity analyses also supported the results. In conclusion, these results suggest that combination therapy with controlled release nifedipine and low-dose candesartan (8 mg) is \"dominant\" to up-titrated candesartan monotherapy for the management of essential hypertension. This conclusion was robust to sensitivity analysis.\n\nEffects of nifedipine on gravi-dependent germination of moss spores\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhorkavtsiv, O. Y.; Demkiv, O. T.\n\nInfluence of gravity on germination of spores and dependence of the generation of a polar axis on a Ca2+ influx were investigated. The germination of spores does not depend on gravity but outgrowth polarity is controlled by light and gravity (Sytnik et al., 1989; Pundiak et al., 2001). We have shown that gravity determines the polarity of germination of spores and development of rhizoid and chloronemal outgrowths in both moss species -- Ceratodon purpureus and Pohlia nutans, the alignment of polar of germinating spores in C. purpureus, however, is less dependent on gravistimulus than in P. nutans. In 48 h after sowing onto culture medium+0,2% glucose in vertically oriented petri dishes in darkness spores of P. nutans germinated positively gravitropic rhizoid at the lower spore side and negatively gravitropic chloronema at the opposite one. The germination of C. purpureus spores is similar but the outgrowths show the lower level of alignment to the gravity vector than that of P. nutans, the dispersion of angles being 8,9 vs. 1,2 respectively. The cellular mechanism by which gravity acts remains unknown. The intracellular signaling Ca2+ ions play a crucial role in gravity perception and ability of a single cell to respond to gravity. We determined relative intensity of Ca2+ luminescence in the spores before their germination and at the early stages of outgrowth formation after treatment with the nifedipine and in a dependence on gravity vector. Gravity determined the position of outgrowth initiation zone and later on the growth direction of spore filaments. Treatment with nifedipine suppressed the gravity-directed calcium channel influx and distrupted polar growth of outgrowths. In experiments with calcium channel blocker sterilized spores were pregerminated on normal Knop's agar one day after were transferred to 50 Î¼ M nifedipine just before emergence of the germ tube. After 48 h on nifedipine treatment, 50% spores did not germinate, 35% grew apolarily and in 15\n\n[Management of ureteric colic with ketorolac and nifedipin vs. ketorolac and tamsulosin in the emergency room].\n\nPubMed\n\nMontiel-JarquÃ­n, Ãlvaro J; Rocha-Rocha, Valeria M; SolÃ­s-Mendoza, Hugo A; Romero-Figueroa, MarÃ­a S; Etchegaray-Morales, Ivet; Alvarado-Ortega, Ivan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUreteric colic is the most common symptom of lithiasis. It is caused by the presence of stones accumulated in the renal papillae. These stones often migrate down the ureter, causing a ureteric colic, characterized by a severe pain in the lumbar region. The aim of this study was to compare the use of ketorolac and nifedipine vs. ketorolac and tamsulosin for the medical treatment of pain caused by stones in the lower ureter. Longitudinal study of 150 patients of 21-years or older with stones in the lower third of the ureter. 50% received ketorolac and nifedipine and the other 50%, ketorolac and tamsulosin. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) was used for the assessment of pain at admission and 4 and 12 hours after the treatment was administered. We used descriptive and inferential statistics (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon, chi-squared and Poisson regression). Mean age was 38.17 years; 54.7% were male and 45.3% female. NPRS mean was 9.69 (initially), 7.42 (at 4 hours) and 2.05 (at 12 hours). There were no significant differences in the initial measurement of pain between groups (p < 0.005); four and 12 hours later the pain decreased more in patients managed with ketorolac and nifedipine, p = 0.0041. There were no complications nor side effects in both treatments. The use of ketorolac and nifedipine is more effective than the use of ketorolac and tamsulosin for the management of pain caused by lower ureteral colic during the first 12 hours of treatment.\n\nAnalysis of nifedipine in human plasma and amniotic fluid by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and its application to clinical pharmacokinetics in hypertensive pregnant women.\n\nPubMed\n\nFilgueira, Gabriela Campos de Oliveira; Filgueira, Osmany Alberto Silva; Carvalho, Daniela Miarelli; Marques, Maria Paula; MoisÃ©s, Elaine Christine Dantas; Duarte, Geraldo; Lanchote, Vera Lucia; Cavalli, Ricardo Carvalho\n\n2015-07-01\n\nNifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker used for the treatment of hypertension in pregnant women. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for analysis of nifedipine in human plasma and amniotic fluid. Separation of nifedipine and nitrendipine (IS) was performed using a LiChroCART(Â®) RP-Select B column and a mixture of water:acetonitrile:glacial acetic acid (30:70:0.5 v/v) as the mobile phase. Aliquots of 500Î¼L of biological samples were extracted at pH 13 using dichloromethane:n-pentane (3:7 v/v). The validated method was applied to a study of the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine in human plasma and amniotic fluid samples collected up to 12h after administration of the last slow-release nifedipine (20mg/12h) dose to 12 hypertensive pregnant women. The estimated pharmacokinetic parameters of nifedipine showed a mean AUC(0-12) of 250.2ngh/mL, ClT/F of 89.2L/h, Vd/F of 600.0L and t1/2 5.1h. The mean amniotic fluid/plasma concentration ratio was 0.05. The methods proved to be highly sensitive by showing a lower quantification limit of 0.1ng/mL for both matrices. And this study reports for the first time the complete development and vali"
