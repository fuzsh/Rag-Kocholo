The films are reflexive about performance and in their play with intertextuality, and their emphasis on fictional narratives is drawn from theater, opera, literature, and folklore. Nevertheless, the films are often trivialized as \"escapist\" and written off as Fascist because in their fascination with wealth, upward mobility, and security, they are said to have diverted audiences from the harsh realities of life under Fascism.1 These conflicting views cannot be harmonized, but the notion of \"escapism\" can be enlarged to a level of complexity that redeems it from the familiar charge of vacuity, frivolity, and evasion of conflict. Never totally removed from everyday or social conflicts, the texts draw on the folklore of sexual politicsfamilialism , gendered and sexual identity, work, leisure, and conflicts over power and authority-coded in the conventions of genre.2 Through their focus on theatricality, the films share with their audiences knowledge of their status as commodities, a slippery relationship to conformity and opposition, and a simultaneous sense of involvement and detachment . Their treatment of spectacle is aligned to a reflexive use of gesture , costume, and mise-en-scene, stressing artifice of setting and highlighting impersonation, disguises, doubling, carnival, and spectacle. In this essay, I discuss six exemplary films of the era to identify the ways in which they address and exploit \"theatricality,\" the term I use to designate a mode of escapism in which life is equated with performance - not authenticity. While the narratives remain attached to familiar im250 Theatricality and Impersonation 251 ages of gender, sexuality, and work; conflicts between the home and the world; the public and private spheres; and personal desire and perceived social imperatives, their reflexivity about performance produces an ambivalent and dialectical interplay between realism and fiction, social conflict and fantasy, entertainment and seriousness, and affective involvement and distanciation. I examine how their allusions to live entertainment and the presence of role-playing are essential to the films' conception of community, and how impersonation, doubling, and disguises are central to the development of images of life as amenable to control and management. The sixth and final film that I discuss, Sorelle Materassi, is, I argue, a dissection and mordant critique of escapism. Life, Opera, and \"Putting on a Show\" The cinematic form most identified with escapism is the film musical, where song and dance are considered to be evasions of the hardships of life-failure, aggression, unrequited interpersonal relations, and abuses of power. The prime characteristic of musicals is their emphasis on a show within a film, which serves to mirror art as life .and to celebrate performance over naturalism.3 Their escapism is mainly identified in their exaltation of artifice, romance, and resolution of conflict. One of the first Italian sound films was Figaro e la sua gran giornata (Figaro's Big Day, 1931), a musical directed by Mario Camerini. In the tradition of musicals, the film parallels life and art.4 Figaro is indebted to Rossini's The Barber of Seville and to a play by Arnaldo Fraccaroli, Ostrega che sbrego! (Oh, What Fun!). The narrative is structured around the attempts of a baritone, Basoto (Gianfranco Giachetti), to insert himself into a performance of The Barber of Seville to be given by a visiting opera troupe. His boasting about his once-great career is not matched by his singing performance. By contrast, Nina (Leda Gloria), a victim of parental control, is vocally talented, and Basoto and Rantolini , the manager, seek to enlist her as their Rosina in the performance of the opera. Her father is opposed to her performing in public, and, for reasons of jealousy, so is her lover, Chiodini (Maurizio D'Ancora ). Her life is also complicated by the refusal of her parents to approve her marriage to Chiodini. The film relies on counterparts in romance and theatrical performance-between the Rossini opera and the trials and tribulations of Nina and her relationship to Chiodini. However , just as obstacles to artistic achievement in the film's treatment of opera are eliminated, so also are obstacles to romance overcome. As is characteristic of film musicals, \"the symbolic wedding celebrates the ongoing relationship between film and spectator as much as [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-15..."
