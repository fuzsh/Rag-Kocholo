        "text": "Opening what he hopes will be a \"cinema Italiano permanente\" in the Teatro Venezia at Fifty-ninth Street and Seventh Avenue, Commendatore Clemente Giglio is presenting an interesting bit of the romantic career of Giuseppe Garibaldi entitled \"Gesuzza, la sposa Garibaldina\" (Gesuzza, the Garibaldian Wife).Despite its technical defects, this sketch of the happenings in Sicily and in Italy proper just before the landing of the great patriot with his heroic \"1,000\" (in fact there were 1,070 in the gallant band) at Marsala on May 11, 1860, which culminated in the freeing of Naples and Sicily from the Bourbon yoke, is bound to grip both Italians and Am√©ricans familiar with the history of those days. Ending with the Battle of Calatifimi on May 15, where the \"mille\" defeated 3,000 Neapolitan troops, the picture leaves the spectators hoping for another installment of a story which needs no retouching by scenarists.Perhaps with a view to future productions, the gigantic figure of Garibaldi is kept rather in the background and the camera puts the spotlight up on the comely Aida Bellia, typifying the heroic women whose love of liberty equalled that of their men folk; up on Giuseppe Gulino, as the ideal private soldier in the war against tyranny, and upon Gianfranco Giachetti, representing the members of the clergy who stood by the people in the struggle for freedom. All of them act well, as do the rest of a numerous cast.\n\nAt the Teatro VeneziaGESUZZA, LA SPOSA GARIBALDINA, a dialogue film in Italian; directed by Alessandro Blassetti; a Cines Pittaluga production.Gesuzza . . . . .
