Along the way, the peasant hero encounters many colorful Italians, differing in class and age, and holding political opinions of every type. There is a key train scene, and the film ends on the battlefield, Italian unification a success, despite brutal losses.",

        "text": "A Black and white AND Italian movie? I'm so getting my kino card now.\n\nI learned about this film through History class and thought it would be interesting enough to watch. It turned out pretty above average, it's no hidden masterpiece but it isn't unwatchable either. The characters are neat, I quite liked our main hero. He looks exactly like the gigachad meme which I found amusing, and he acts like a real chad throughout the film. He easily gets the best moment in the film, where he flies into a rant about how the Nationalists in Piedmont are partying hard while the Bourbons are butchering Sicily. Some of the bit players are memorable, but they don't get much toâ€¦\n\nA really good film from which to start looking at 1930s Italian productions -- high level of rural-Sicily pictorialism, occasional throwbacks to 1910-20s film style, and narrative content that anticipates lots of what was best in postwar cinema, from Bandits Of Orgosolo and The Leopard to Christ Stopped At Eboli and Salvatore Giulani. If the creeping fascism of the year is visible in the script, it isn't overpowering.\n\nSomewhat reminiscent of Renoir on the popular front (Toni and Grand Illusion specifically), if not necessarily in political intentions but in its tactics, excellent location shooting, decentralization of the primary emotional narrative through the constant zooming in to the individual emotions and out into the historical dramatics, and the extremely important fact that What Is To Come is inseparable from the films effects when viewing it now. A messier subject (Italian Unification) begets a messier disposition, although I think it is largely to its benefit, the spirit of its construction is very much in keeping with the spirit of the film.\n\nMaybe this is true for all art to a certain extent, but it is always interesting to me how for Cinema, form doesn't really follow function except in the extreme, form instead takes off from history, technological/political of course, but I would argue from a more social and psychological version of it.\n\nmy prof really said \"oh you can watch this movie that's a little over an hour long and has eng subs or you can watch this other one that's almost 3 hours long and has no eng subs\" and expected me to pick the other movie... ma'am u underestimate how little i want to do work\n\nThe movie is well shot with many striking scenery shots, but I failed to grasp the full charm of the story. Guess one have to have some basic knowledge about 1860 and the war that was going on, something which I lacked going into this movie. And since the movie ends in the middle of a battle I was none the wiser getting out of it."
