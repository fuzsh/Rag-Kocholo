Moreover, a film that can last up to 20 minutes is able to convey strong emotions to the viewer, leaving her or him 'out of breath'.\n\nInitially, fiaticorti was condensed into a single evening, namely an awards night. However, from the 4th edition on, the format has been enhanced, and the festival develops over four stages, during which the best works are presented.\n\nIn 2006 the section FiatiVeneti was introduced, to reward short film-makers from the Veneto region.\n\n2011 represented fiaticorti’s turning point. Not only did longtime artistic director Gianni Billio pass the baton to Bartolo Ayroldi Sagarriga (the new artistic director), Andrea Grespan and Simone Perotto, but the quality of the films in competition increased dramatically, together with the number of foreign participants, mainly from France, Great Britain, Romania and Spain. fiaticorti increasingly became an international event.\n\nBut the identity of the festival, connected to the Italian film club culture of the Seventies, has always remained the same. Its goal is that of transmitting culture and passion for short films. That’s why the artistic direction has chosen not to accompany the festival with events of other kinds.\n\nInternational Festival\n\nShort film festival\n\nFiction Documentary Animation Fantastic Terror Experimental\n\n3.

Ten years later, Chilean filmmakers organized to commemorate that day as Chilean Film Day, a date that was distorted with the arrival of democracy, since the large exhibition chains saw a business opportunity, relegating the true meaning of the date. From 2010 onwards, university attempts and the Museum of Memory began to retake the true meaning of the day of Chilean cinema, with almost the only venue being the Metropolitan region. 50 years after the civil-military coup d'état, the Municipality of Valparaíso decided to commemorate November 29 by showing the film \"El Realismo Socialista\" by Ruiz-Sarmiento, with photography by Jorge Müller.\n\nThis year 2024 marks 50 years since the disappearance of the filmmaker couple, the same year that the audiovisual table is created and in this sense, is that we seek to enhance from a regional processes of vindication of our historical memory, linking our audiovisual work to the community in our territories.\n\nInternational Festival\n\nShort film festival\n\nFeature film festival\n\nFiction Documentary Animation Fantastic Terror Other Experimental"
