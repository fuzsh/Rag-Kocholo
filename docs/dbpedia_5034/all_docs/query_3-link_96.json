Final report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNONE\n\n1982-09-01\n\nThis report is a summary of the Energy Engineering Analysis for the Milan Army Ammunition Plant (MAAP) in Milan, Tennessee. It includes the recommendations for the development of a Basewide Energy Plan consisting of energy conservation projects and other recommendations for reduction of the installation`s 1985 source energy consumption. Milan Army Ammunition Plant, containing 22,541 acres, is situated in both Gibson and Carroll Counties, Tennessee, and is approximately equally divided longitudinally into the two counties. The Milan area experiences typically short mild winters and long warm summers. With the exception of a few modernized facilities, the overwhelming majority of buildingsmoreÂ Â» at MAAP were constructed for World War II ammunition production.Â«Â less\n\nDemonstration Results of Phytoremediation of Explosives-Contaminated Groundwater Using Constructed Wetlands At The Milan Army Ammunition Plant, Milan, Tennessee Volume IV.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1998-12-01\n\n1030 1 DEMONSTRATION RESULTS OF PHYTOREMEDIATION OF EXPLOSIVES-CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER USING CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS AT THE MILAN ARMY...88826V Report No. SFIM-AEC-ET-CR-97059 UTIC QUALITY INSPECTED 4 Demonstration Results of Phytoremediation of Explosives-Contaminated Groundwater...SUBTITLE Demonstration Results of Phytoremediation of Explosives-Contaminated Groundwater Using Constructed Wetlands at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant\n\n3Demonstration Results of Phytoremediation of Explosives-Contaminated Groundwater Using Constructed Wetlands at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant, Milan, Tennessee Volume III.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1998-12-01\n\n10301 ~>& DEMONSTRATION RESULTS OF PHYTOREMEDIATION OF EXPLOSIVES-CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER USING CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS AT THE MILAN ARMY...Demonstration Results of Phytoremediation of Explosives-Contaminated Groundwater Using Constructed Wetlands At The Milan Army Ammunition Plant...December 1998 2.

TITLE AND SUBTITLE Demonstration Results of Phytoremediation of Explosives\n\nThe water footprint of Milan.\n\nPubMed\n\nVanham, D; Bidoglio, G\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study quantifies the water footprint of consumption (WFcons) and production (WFprod) of Milan. The current WFcons amounts to 6,139 l/cap/d (a volume of 2.93 km(3) annually), of which 52 l/cap/d (1%) is attributed to domestic water, 448 l/cap/d (7%) to the consumption of industrial products and 5,639 l/cap/d (92%) to the consumption of agricultural products. The WFprod is 52 l/cap/d. Milan is thus a net virtual water importer, predominantly through the import of agricultural products. These are produced outside city borders, both in Italy and abroad. This shows the dependency of city dwellers on water resources from other river basins. In addition, the WFcons for a healthy diet (based on Mediterranean Food-Based Dietary Guidelines) and a vegetarian diet are analysed. The current Milanese diet consists of too much sugar, crop oils, meat, animal fats, milk and milk products and not enough cereals, rice, potatoes, vegetables and fruit. The latter two diets result in substantial WFcons reductions: -29% (to 4,339 l/cap/d) for a healthy diet and -41% (to 3,631 l/cap/d) for a vegetarian diet. Indeed, a lot of water could be saved by Milan citizens through a change in their diet. A sustainable city should account for its impacts beyond its borders.\n\nScreening submersed plant species for phytoremediation of explosives-contaminated groundwater from the Milan Army Ammunition Plant, Milan, Tennessee. Final report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBest, E.P.; Sprecher, S.L.; Fredrickson, H.L.\n\n1997-11-01\n\nAs an alternative to other groundwater extraction and surface treatment techniques, phytoremediation systems are currently being evaluated by civilian and military administrators for their ability to enhance removal of potentially toxic or mutagenic munitions materiel such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5- trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and their degradation products. To guide selection of aquatic plants for use in demonstration phytoremediation lagoons at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant (MAAP), Milan, TN, this study evaluated the relative ability of ten species to decrease levels of TNT and RDX explosives and related nitrobodies in contaminated MAAP groundwater.\n\nStatus of the MARE experiment in Milan\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFerri, E.; Arnaboldi, C.; Ceruti, G.\n\n2009-12-16\n\nAn international collaboration has grown around the project of Microcalorimeter Arrays for a Rhenium Experiment (MARE) for a direct and calorimetric measurement of the electron antineutrino mass with sub-electronvolt sensitivity.MARE is divided into two phases. The first phase (MARE-1) consists of two independent experiments using the presently available detector technology to reach a sensitivity of m{sub v}{<=}2eV/c{sup 2}. The goal of the second phase (MARE-2) is to achieve a sub-electronvolt sensitivity on the neutrino mass.The Milan MARE-1 experiment is based on arrays of silicon implanted microcalorimeters, produced by NASA/GSFC, with dielectric silver perrhenate absorbers, AgReO{sub 4}. We present here themoreÂ Â» status of MARE-1 in Milan which is starting data taking with 2 arrays (72 detectors). In this configuration a sensitivity of about 5 eV can be achieved in two years. We describe in details the experimental setup which is designed to host up to 8 arrays (288 detectors). With 8 arrays, two years of measurement would improve the sensitivity to about 3 eV. This talk reports on the activity of the group for the MARE project in Milan.Â«Â less\n\nSuperfund Record of Decision (EPA Region 4): Milan Army Ammunition Plant, O-Line Ponds Area, Milan, TN, September 1993\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNot Available\n\n1993-09-01\n\nThe decision document presents the selected remedial action for Operable Unit Two (OU2) at the O-Line Ponds Area, Milan Army Ammunition Plant, Milan, Tennessee. The goal of the overall cleanup activities at the site is to prevent migration of contaminants from soil at the site and to prevent exposures to these contaminants, so that no adverse health effects will result from current or future off-post or on-post use. Soil contaminated with explosives compounds is known to exist in the O-Line Ponds area, and under current conditions, this contamination poses a potential threat to groundwater at the site. Currently contaminated groundwatermoreÂ Â» is being addressed by separate remedial actions under different Operable Units (OUs).Â«Â less\n\nAre we ready for routine precision medicine? Highlights from the Milan Summit on Precision Medicine, Milan, Italy, 8-9 February 2018.\n\nPubMed\n\nMazzarella, Luca\n\n2018-01-01\n\nOn 8 and 9 February 2018, the IFOM-IEO campus in Milan hosted the Milan summit on Precision Medicine, which gathered clinical and translational research experts from academia, industry and regulatory bodies to discuss the state of the art of precision medicine in Europe. The meeting was pervaded by a generalised feeling of excitement for a field that is perceived to be technologically mature for the transition into clinical routine but still hampered by numerous obstacles of a methodological, ethical, regulatory and possibly cultural nature. Through lively discussions, the attendees tried to identify realistic ways to implement a technology-rich precision approach to cancer patients.\n\nEarly Greek Typography in Milan: A Historical Note on a New Greek Typeface.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWallraff, Martin\n\n1997-01-01\n\nDiscusses the history of Greek typography, focusing on the first book to be entirely printed in Greek in 1476 and the series of new typefaces that resulted.

A survey has been planned to evaluate the application of HACCP plan, in order to select a statistically representative sample of food services (restaurant, pizza-shop, bar, ..) in two Milan area' Public Health Units (PHU). During the inspections a proper check-list has been filled up in order to give a conformity evaluation about the global situation and about three specific sections: hygiene of food-handlers, procedures control, temperatures management. The food services have been found satisfactory in 9/106 and 5/54 cases in Milan City and in hinterland, respectively; among the two areas, highly significant differences have been revealed about temperatures management (68% and 28% unsatisfactory, respectively). In Milan City restaurants provided with HACCP plan scores are significantly different from unprovided restaurants scores (global and the three sections' evaluation); in Milan hinterland differences between provided and unprovided HACCP plan restaurants regard temperature management scores only. Useful suggestions to improve the quality of surveillance activity come from complex and heterogeneous findings shown in this study.\n\nSuperfund record of decision (EPA Region 4): Milan Army Ammunition Plant, operable units 3 and 4, Milan, TN, October 2, 1995\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNONE\n\n1996-03-01\n\nThis decision document presents the selected remedial action for the soil within the northern industrial area of Milan Army Ammunition Plant, Milan, Tennessee. The goal of the cleanup activities at the northern industrial areas of MAAP is to remove the soil contaminated with explosives compounds above risk-based levels. The excavated soil will be treated using a bioremediation process to reduce the concentrations of explosives compounds, the toxicity of the leachate, and the mobility of the remaining organic compounds. The treated soil will then be placed in an on-site solid waste landfill in compliance with State of Tennessee regulations. Additionally, inmoreÂ Â» areas where excavation of the explosives-contaminated soil is infeasible, the soil will be covered with an engineered cap to prevent worker exposure to the explosives compounds and prevent leaching of these compounds to groundwater.Â«Â less\n\n[Sociodemographic and health conditions of the RomÃ¡ population in Milan].\n\nPubMed\n\nColombo, Cinzia; Galli, Andrea; Pero, Margherita; Giani, Riccardo; Jucker, Simonetta; Oreste, Pierluigi; Giommarini, Claudia; Aiolfi, Ernestina; Judica, Elda\n\n2011-01-01\n\nTo analyze the socioeconomic and health status of rom a people mainly living in not authorized settlements in Milan. Evaluation of socioeconomic and healthcare data collected by the mobile unit of Naga, a voluntary association based in Milan, during two years of activity (2009-2010). Healthcare data have been classified using an operational classification. Settlements located in Milan where rom a people live. 1 142 rom a people living in 14 settlements of Milan (only one authorized) were visited.Mean schooling years were 4.9. The mean number of children per family was 2.8. Of 803 people older than 13 years, 129 had an occupation (16%). 56%of subjetcs older than 12 years were smokers (53% females vs. 59%males); among smokers, 17%were heavy smokers (12%females vs 22% males). The most frequently reported diseases were: respiratory diseases (21%of total diagnoses), disorders of the orthopedic-rheumatologic-traumatology area (13%), gastroenterological diseases (10%) and dental problems (8%). Most residents had no healthcare coverage (94%). Almost all settlements (except the authorized one) had no sanitary facilities, no garbage collection system and were definitely overcrowded. Mild diseases were the most commonly found pathologies, with few chronic diseases reported probably due to difficulties in investigating more complex diseases in the study setting,and to the impossibility to follow the patients over time. Furthermore, the access to healthcare services for diagnostic tests and specialist visits is very very difficult for these patients. Poor living conditions, low educational level, low employment rate, barriers in the access to healthcare services are all risks factors for the health status of rom a people.\n\nTuberculosis Outbreak in a Primary School, Milan, Italy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFaccini, Marino; Codecasa, Luigi Ruffo; Ciconali, Giorgio; Cammarata, Serafina; Borriello, Catia Rosanna; De Gioia, Costanza; Za, Alessandro; Marino, Andrea Filippo; Ferrarese, Maurizio; Gesu, Giovanni; Mazzola, Ester; Castaldi, Silvana\n\n2013-01-01\n\nInvestigation of an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) in a primary school in Milan, Italy, found 15 schoolchildren had active TB disease and 173 had latent TB infection.

Although the baseline of the MARE project consists in a large array of rhenium based thermal detectors, a different option for the isotope is also being considered. The different option is Ho-163. The potential of using Re-187 for a calorimetric neutrino mass experiment has been already demonstrated. On the contrary, no calorimetric spectrum of Ho-163 has been so far measured with the precision required to set a useful limit on the neutrino mass. The first phase of the project (MARE-1) is a collection of activities with the aim of sorting out both the best isotope and the most suited detector technology to be used for the final experiment. One of the MARE-1 activities is carried out in Milan by the group of Milano-Bicocca in collaboration with NASA/GSFC and Wisconsin groups. The Milan MARE-l arrays are based on semiconductor thermistors, provided by the NASA/GSFC group, with dielectric silver perrhenate absorbers, AgReO4. The experiment, which is presently being assembled, is designed to host up to 8 arrays.\n\nDownstaging therapy followed by liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan criteria.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Young; Stahl, Christopher C; Makramalla, Abouelmagd; Olowokure, Olugbenga O; Ristagno, Ross L; Dhar, Vikrom K; Schoech, Michael R; Chadalavada, Seetharam; Latif, Tahir; Kharofa, Jordan; Bari, Khurram; Shah, Shimul A\n\n2017-12-01\n\nOrthotopic liver transplantation is a curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria, but these criteria preclude many patients from transplant candidacy. Recent studies have demonstrated that downstaging therapy can reduce tumor burden to meet conventional criteria. The present study reports a single-center experience with tumor downstaging and its effects on post-orthotopic liver transplantation outcomes. All patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were evaluated by our multidisciplinary liver services team from 2012 to 2016 were identified (NÂ =Â 214). Orthotopic liver transplantation candidates presenting outside of Milan criteria at initial radiographic diagnosis and/or an initial alpha-fetoprotein >400Â ng/mL were categorized as at high risk for tumor recurrence and post-transplant mortality. Of the 214 patients newly diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, 73 (34.1%) eventually underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. The majority of patients who did not undergo orthotopic liver transplantation were deceased or lost to follow-up (47.5%), with 14 of 141 (9.9%) currently listed for transplantation. Among transplanted patients, 21 of 73 (28.8%) were considered high-risk candidates. All 21 patients were downstaged to within Milan criteria with an alpha-fetoprotein <400Â ng/mL before orthotopic liver transplantation, through locoregional therapies. Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma was higher but acceptable between downstaged high-risk and traditional candidates (9.5% vs 1.9%; P > .05) at a median follow-up period of 17Â months. Downstaged high-risk candidates had a similar overall survival compared with those transplanted within Milan criteria (log-rank P > .05). In highly selected cases, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma outside of traditional criteria for orthotopic liver transplantation may undergo downstaging therapy in a multidisciplinary fashion with excellent post-transplant outcomes. These data support an\n\nNumerical models of pore pressure and stress changes along basement faults due to wastewater injection: Applications to the 2014 Milan, Kansas Earthquake\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHearn, Elizabeth H.; Koltermann, Christine; Rubinstein, Justin R.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe have developed groundwater flow models to explore the possible relationship between wastewater injection and the 12 November 2014 MwÂ 4.8 Milan, Kansas earthquake. We calculate pore pressure increases in the uppermost crust using a suite of models in which hydraulic properties of the Arbuckle Formation and the Milan earthquake fault zone, the Milan earthquake hypocenter depth, and fault zone geometry are varied. Given preâearthquake injection volumes and reasonable hydrogeologic properties, significantly increasing pore pressure at the Milan hypocenter requires that most flow occur through a conductive channel (i.e., the lower Arbuckle and the fault zone) rather than a conductive 3âD volume. For a range of reasonable lower Arbuckle and fault zone hydraulic parameters, the modeled pore pressure increase at the Milan hypocenter exceeds a minimum triggering threshold of 0.01 MPa at the time of the earthquake. Critical factors include injection into the base of the Arbuckle Formation and proximity of the injection point to a narrow fault damage zone or conductive fracture in the preâCambrian basement with a hydraulic diffusivity of about 3â30 m2/s. The maximum pore pressure increase we obtain at the Milan hypocenter before the earthquake is 0.06 MPa. This suggests that the Milan earthquake occurred on a fault segment that was critically stressed prior to significant wastewater injection in the area. Given continued wastewater injection into the upper Arbuckle in the Milan region, assessment of the middle Arbuckle as a hydraulic barrier remains an important research priority.\n\nAir pollution monitoring network on Milan district area structure and results\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCavallaro, A.; Gualdi, R.; Tebaldi, G.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nA discussion of air pollution surveillance in the Milan area covers the geographic and winter characteristics of the Milan area; the monitoring network established by the Provincial Laboratory of Hygiene and Prophylaxis, including 25 sulfur dioxide monitors, 3 automatic dust monitors, 6 weather stations, 2 nitrogen oxide monitors, 3 airport noise sensors, and a coordination center; the statistical procedures used to analyze sulfur dioxide concentration data for each month during the period Oct.-Mar. of the winters of 1970-71 through 1974-75; and concludes that the reduction in sulfur dioxide levels is caused by either the reduction in fuel sulfur content (frommoreÂ Â» 1.77Vertical Bar3< to 1.27Vertical Bar3< in the interval under study) or to improved management of heating plants.Â«Â less\n\nHealth assessment for Milan Army Ammunition Plant, Milan, Carrol and Gibson Counties, Tennessee, Region 4. CERCLIS No. TND210020582. Preliminary report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNot Available\n\n1989-04-10\n\nThe Milan Army Ammunition Plant Site (MAAP) is located in Milan (Carrol and Gibson Counties), Tennessee. MAAP produces munitions for the U.S. Army. From 1942 to 1978 wastewater from a munition demilitarization process line was discharged into 11 unlined settling ponds. These ponds were dredged in 1971 with the soils placed near the side of the ponds. A multilayer cap was placed on top of the ponds and the dredged soils (1984). Access to the site is restricted. Removal actions have not occurred. Preliminary on-site groundwater sampling results have identified cyclonite (RDX), homocyclonite (HMX), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. In addition,moreÂ Â» cadmium, chromium, and lead were detected in on-site groundwater. Off-site surface water sampling results identified RDX and HMX. The site is considered to be of potential public health concern because of the risk to human health caused by the possibility of human exposure to hazardous substances. Direct contact and ingestion with groundwater from on-site wells, off-site soils and bioaccumulation of site-related contaminants in fish, waterfowl, and crops with uptake from irrigation, and subsequent ingestion by area residents are possible human exposure pathways.Â«Â less\n\nThe Italian Linguistic Landscape: The Cases of Milan and Udine\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nColuzzi, Paolo\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis article looks at the linguistic landscape in two Northern Italian cities: Milan and Udine.

This was the culmination of a period of accelerated industrial growth that modern-day historiography considers to be when Italy's first real industrial revolution began. The twenty-five years between the National Industrial Exhibition of 1881, which was also held in Milan, and the 1906 Exhibition truly reflected a period which was crucial for this transformation to take of. Alongside industry, which was then going through a phase of reorganization and development, Milanese civil society was increasingly turning its interest and attention to what was called the \"social question\". In an atmosphere of debate and exchange of ideas and experience with Turin, another major industrial city of the north and the birthplace of the Italian engineering and automobile industries, social organizations, political parties and trade unions began to be established thus heralding the Italian approach towards twentieth-century welfare. This is the context in which the first International Congress on Occupational Diseases was held in Milan from 9 to 14 June 1906 within the framework of the International Exhibition. The success achieved with this initiative. organized by Luigi Devoto and Malachia De Cristoforis, which was to continue with the founding of the International Permanent Commission on Occupational Health, showed that the time was ripe for a new subject to appear on the scene--the occupational health physician--who from then on was to play an important role in the promotion of workers' health. The article outlines the main features of the Italian industrial transformation at the turn of the new century with special attention focused on Milan, the capital of industry in Italy. It also describes the impact on public opinion caused by the events surrounding the epic construction of the transalpine railway tunnels which began in 1856 with the Mont Cenis tunnel\n\nPreliminary Statistics from the NASA Alphasat Beacon Receiver in Milan, Italy\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZemba, Michael J.; Nessel, James A.; Morse, Jacquelynne R.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and the Politecnico di Milano (POLIMI) have initiated a joint propagation campaign within the framework of the Alphasat propagation experiment to characterize rain attenuation, scintillation, and gaseous absorption effects of the atmosphere in the 40 GHz band.

The main parameters of the facility and the design criteria are discussed in details.\n\nPredictive Factors of Downstaging of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Beyond the Milan Criteria Treated with Intra-arterial Therapies\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBova, Valentina; Miraglia, Roberto, E-mail: rmiraglia@ismett.edu; Maruzzelli, Luigi\n\n2013-04-15\n\nThis study was designed to analyze the clinical results in patients suitable for liver transplantation with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who exceeded Milan criteria, which underwent intra-arterial therapies (IAT), to determine predictive factors of successful downstaging. A total of 277 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and HCC were treated by IAT (transarterial oily chemoembolization, transarterial chemoembolization, transarterial embolization) in a single center. Eighty patients exceed the Milan criteria. Patients with infiltrative HCC, hypovascular HCC, and portal vein thrombosis were excluded, with a final study population of 48 patients. Tumor response to IAT was evaluated with CT and/or MRI according to modified RECISTmoreÂ Â» criteria. Successful downstaging was defined as a reduction in the number and size of viable tumors to within the Milan criteria, and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) <100 ng/mL, for at least 6 months. Nineteen patients (39 %) had their tumors successfully downstaged; 29 patients (61 %) did not. Multivariate analysis showed that AFP level <100 ng/mL and 3-year calculated survival probability using the Metroticket calculator were the only independent predictors of successful downstaging (p < 0.023 and p < 0.049 respectively). Biological characteristics of HCC as AFP levels <100 ng/mL and high 3-year calculated survival probability may predict a good response to downstage after IAT.Â«Â less\n\nEvent-Based Surveillance During EXPO Milan 2015: Rationale, Tools, Procedures, and Initial Results\n\nPubMed Central\n\nManso, Martina Del; Caporali, Maria Grazia; Napoli, Christian; Linge, Jens P.; Mantica, Eleonora; Verile, Marco; Piatti, Alessandra; Pompa, Maria Grazia; Vellucci, Loredana; Costanzo, Virgilio; Bastiampillai, Anan Judina; Gabrielli, Eugenia; Gramegna, Maria; Declich, Silvia\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMore than 21 million participants attended EXPO Milan from May to October 2015, making it one of the largest protracted mass gathering events in Europe. Given the expected national and international population movement and health security issues associated with this event, Italy fully implemented, for the first time, an event-based surveillance (EBS) system focusing on naturally occurring infectious diseases and the monitoring of biological agents with potential for intentional release. The system started its pilot phase in March 2015 and was fully operational between April and November 2015. In order to set the specific objectives of the EBS system, and its complementary role to indicator-based surveillance, we defined a list of priority diseases and conditions. This list was designed on the basis of the probability and possible public health impact of infectious disease transmission, existing statutory surveillance systems in place, and any surveillance enhancements during the mass gathering event. This article reports the methodology used to design the EBS system for EXPO Milan and the results of 8 months of surveillance.

Environmental investigations conducted by the US Army have detected low concentrations of RDX, a compound used in the manufacture of explosives, in two of the three city water supply wells. The RDX is traceable to the Milan Army Ammunition Plant nearby. The levels of RDX are being monitored and current trends indicate that levels in the wells will exceed the EPA Health Advisory Limits in the near term. In order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of acceptable quality drinking water for the city residents, the ArmymoreÂ Â» prepared and is implementing a Contingency Plan. The plan evaluated remedial alternatives to be implemented once a trigger level of RDX is reached, including institutional controls, installation of an RDX treatment system for the water supply system, and construction of a new well field. Institutional controls include: shutting down existing wells; continued monitoring; and promulgation of ground water ordinances. Treatment technologies evaluated include: ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide; or removal using granular activated carbon.Â«Â less\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis of liver resection versus transplantation for early hepatocellular carcinoma within the Milan criteria.\n\nPubMed\n\nLim, Kheng Choon; Wang, Vivian W; Siddiqui, Fahad J; Shi, Luming; Chan, Edwin S Y; Oh, Hong Choon; Tan, Say Beng; Chow, Pierce K H\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBoth liver resection (LR) and cadaveric liver transplantation (CLT) are potentially curative treatments for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria and with adequate liver function. Adopting either as a first-line therapy carries major cost and resource implications. The objective of this study was to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of LR against CLT for patients with HCC within the Milan criteria using a decision analytic model. A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients aged 55 years with HCC within the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis, undergoing LR or CLT, and followed up over their remaining life expectancy. Analysis was performed in different geographical cost settings: the USA, Switzerland and Singapore. Transition probabilities were obtained from systematic literature reviews, supplemented by databases from Singapore and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (USA). Utility and cost data were obtained from open sources. LR produced 3.9 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) while CLT had an additional 1.4 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CLT versus LR ranged from $111,821/QALY in Singapore to $156,300/QALY in Switzerland, and was above thresholds for cost-effectiveness in all three countries. Sensitivity analysis revealed that CLT-related 5-year cumulative survival, one-time cost of CLT, and post-LR 5-year cumulative recurrence rates were the most sensitive parameters in all cost scenarios. ICERs were reduced below threshold when CLT-related 5-year cumulative survival exceeded 84.9% and 87.6% in Singapore and the USA, respectively. For Switzerland, the ICER remained above the cost-effectiveness threshold regardless of the variations. In patients with HCC within the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis, LR is more cost-effective than CLT across three different costing scenarios: the USA, Switzerland, Singapore.

The facility was constructed in 1941 to produce and store fuses, boosters, and small- and large-caliber ammunition. The ROD addresses an interim remedy for the contaminated ground water beneath and immediately downgradient from the former ponds as OU1. The primary contaminants of concern affecting the ground water are VOCs, including carbon disulfide; other organics, including HMX, RDX, 2,4,6-TNT, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, 1,3-DNB, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, and nitrobenzene; and inorganics, including nitrate.\n\nPreliminary experience of shared clinical management between Milan and Pointe Noire using the INteractive TeleConsultation Network for Worldwide HealthcAre Services (INCAS): telemedicine between Milan and Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nMalacarne, Mara; Lesma, Alessandro; Madera, Angelo; Malfatti, Eugenio; Castelli, Alberto; Lucini, Daniela; Pizzinelli, Paolo; Pagani, Massimo\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThis paper describes preliminary experience in shared clinical management of patients located in Pointe Noire, Africa, and a referral center, Sacco University Hospital, located in Milan, Italy. The employed infrastructure INteractive TeleConsultation Network for Worldwide HealthcAre Services (INCAS) jointly developed by CEFRIEL (Center of Excellence For Research, Innovation, Education & Industrial Labs partnership) and ENI (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi) is based on commercial off-the-shelf technology. This minimizes maintenance problems, while permitting a simple and friendly sharing of data using the telephone and e-mail for store-and-forward applications. The critical aspect of the flow of events comprising the exchange of information is discussed. In 60% of cases, only one telemedicine consultation was required. In the remainder 40%, a number of telemedicine consultations were required for appropriate management of clinical cases. The project demonstrated flexibility as documented by the wide range of pathologies that can be dealt with it. Finally the possibility of using shared clinical management as a learning tool is highlighted by the steep and rising learning curve. We conclude, however, that the patient, although handled in a \"virtual\" manner, should be viewed as very \"real,\" as some of them elected to close the gap physically between Pointe Noire and Milan, and chose to be treated at the referral site.\n\nSound quality indicators for urban places in Paris cross-validated by Milan data.\n\nPubMed\n\nRicciardi, Paola; Delaitre, Pauline; Lavandier, Catherine; Torchia, Francesca; Aumond, Pierre\n\n2015-10-01\n\nA specific smartphone application was developed to collect perceptive and acoustic data in Paris. About 3400 questionnaires were analyzed, regarding the global sound environment characterization, the perceived loudness of some emergent sources and the presence time ratio of sources that do not emerge from the background. Sound pressure level was recorded each second from the mobile phone's microphone during a 10-min period. The aim of this study is to propose indicators of urban sound quality based on linear regressions with perceptive variables. A cross validation of the quality models extracted from Paris data was carried out by conducting the same survey in Milan. The proposed sound quality general model is correlated with the real perceived sound quality (72%). Another model without visual amenity and familiarity is 58% correlated with perceived sound quality. In order to improve the sound quality indicator, a site classification was performed by Kohonen's Artificial Neural Network algorithm, and seven specific class models were developed. These specific models attribute more importance on source events and are slightly closer to the individual data than the global model. In general, the Parisian models underestimate the sound quality of Milan environments assessed by Italian people.\n\nEvaluation of Various Organic Fertilizer Substrates and Hydraulic Retention Times for Enhancing Anaerobic Degradation of Explosives-Contaminated Groundwater While Using Constructed Wetlands at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant, Milan, Tennessee.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1998-05-01\n\nCODES FIELD GROUP SUB-GROUP 18.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on all elective consecutive surgical procedures for tumor resection between January 2012 and December 2014 at the Second Division of Neurosurgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta of Milan. A prospective database dedicated to reporting complications and all clinical and radiological data was retrospectively reviewed. The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) was used to classify each patient's health status. Complications were divided into major and minor and recorded based on etiology and required treatment. A logistic regression model was used to identify possible predictors of clinical worsening after surgery in terms of changes between the preoperative and discharge KPS scores. Statistically significant predictors were rated based on their odds ratios in order to build an ad hoc complexity scale. For each patient, a corresponding total score was calculated, and ANOVA was performed to compare the mean total scores between the improved/unchanged and worsened patients. Relative risk (RR) and chi-square statistics were employed to provide the risk of worsening after surgery for each total score. RESULTS The case series was composed of 746 patients (53.2% female; mean age 51.3 Â± 17.1). The most common tumors were meningiomas (28.6%) and glioblastomas (24.1%). The mortality rate was 0.94%, the major complication rate was 9.1%, and the minor complication rate was 32.6%. Of 746 patients, 523 (70.1%) patients improved or remained unchanged, and 223 (29.9%) patients worsened. The following factors were found to be statistically significant predictors of the change in KPS scores: tumor size larger than 4 cm, cranial nerve manipulation, major brain vessel manipulation, posterior fossa location, and eloquent area involvement\n\nEnergy conservation investment program FY93 limited energy study Milan Army Ammunition Plant Milan, Tennessee.

Last week, the ESO Council held its semi-annual meeting in Milan (Italy) [1]. During a break in the long agenda list, Council members had the opportunity to visit the Ansaldo factory in the outskirts of this city and to see for the first time the assembled mechanical structure of one of the four 8.2-metre VLT Unit telescopes. This Press Release is accompanied by a photo that shows the ESO Council delegates in front of the giant telescope. After a long climb up the steep staircase to the large Nasmyth platform at the side of the telescope where the astronomical instruments will later be placed, Dr. Peter Creola (Switzerland) , President of the ESO Council and a mechanics expert, grabbed the handrail and surveyed the structure with a professional eye: `I knew it was going to be big, but not that enormous!', he said. Other delegates experienced similar feelings, especially when they watched the 430 tonnes of steel in the 24-metre tall and squat structure turn smoothly and silently around the vertical axis. The Chairman of the ESO Scientific Technical Committee (STC), Dr. Johannes Andersen (Denmark) , summarized his first, close encounter with the VLT by `This is great fun!' and several of his colleague astronomers were soon seen in various corners of the vast structure, engaged in elated discussions about the first scientific investigations to be done with the VLT in two years' time.

To assess the rate of tumor growth as selection criteria for LT in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We identified all patients who underwent LT for HCC in our institution from 2002 to 2008. Total tumor volume (TTV) was calculated as the sum of the volumes of all tumors on pretransplantation imaging [(4/3)Ïr3, where r is the maximum radius of each HCC]. The rate of tumor growth was calculated as per-month change in TTV on sequential pretransplantation imaging before any locoregional therapy. A Kaplan-Meier plot was constructed and Cox regression analysis performed. Ninety-two patients were included in the study. The median follow-up was 19.5 (range 10.7-30.7) months during which 12 patients (13%) experienced recurrence of HCC. Twenty-four patients (26%) had HCC beyond the Milan criteria, and the overall survival rate of the entire group was 72%. Higher pre-LT alpha-fetoprotein (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01; P=.001), poorly differentiated tumors (HR 13; P=.039), the presence of microvascular invasion (HR 7.9; P=.001), higher TTV (HR 1.03; P<.001), and faster tumor growth (HR 1.09; P<.001) were significantly associated with the risk of recurrence. A cutoff value of tumor growth of 1.61 cm3/mo was chosen on the basis of the risk of recurrence with the use of a receiver operating characteristic curve. Patients beyond the Milan criteria with tumor growth<1.61 cm3/mo experienced less recurrence (11% vs 58%; P=.023) than those beyond the Milan criteria with tumor growth>1.61 cm3/mo. Similarly, rate of tumor growth predicted HCC recurrence in those beyond the University of California of San Francisco (UCSF) criteria.

Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the ethical review board, and the need to obtain informed consent was waived. Between November 1, 2006, and December 31, 2011, 132 HCC tumors (diameter, 10-45 mm; 39 tumors â¥ 30 mm) in 108 consecutive patients (106 with cirrhosis) that met Milan criteria were treated with no-touch multibipolar RFA, which consisted of activating, in bipolar mode, three or four electrodes inserted just beyond the tumor margins. Follow-up was performed every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months thereafter with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging. Survival probabilities were computed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictive factors of tumor progression and overall survival were assessed by using the Cox proportional hazard model. Results No technical failure occurred, and complete ablation was achieved for all the nodules. After a median of 40.5 months (range, 2-84 months) of follow-up, 3- and 5-year local and overall tumor progression-free survival were 96%, 94%, 52%, and 32%, respectively. Neither tumor diameter greater than 30 mm nor location abutting a large vessel were associated with local tumor progression. Tumor diameter greater than 30 mm was the only parameter predictive of overall tumor progression (P = .0036). Independent factors associated with shorter overall survival were Child-Pugh class B disease, age greater than 65 years, and platelet count of less than 150 g/L (P < .003). Three major complications occurred (2.7%): hemothorax in one patient and liver failure in two, with major portal-systemic shunts. One patient (0.9%) died, and one underwent transplantation. Conclusion No-touch multibipolar RFA for HCC tumors that meet Milan criteria provides a high local tumor progression-free survival\n\nBinder characterisation of mortars used at different ages in the San Lorenzo church in Milan\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBertolini, Luca, E-mail: luca.bertolini@polimi.it; Carsana, Maddalena, E-mail: maddalena.carsana@polimi.it; Gastaldi, Matteo, E-mail: matteo.gastaldi@polimi.it\n\nThe paper describes a study on the mortars of the basilica of San Lorenzo in Milan, which was carried out to support an archaeological study aimed at dating and documenting the construction techniques used throughout the centuries. The church, which was founded between the 4th and 5th century, at the end of the period when Milan was the capital of the Roman Empire, was subjected in time to extensions, collapses and reconstructions that lasted until the Renaissance period and even later on. Thanks to the good state of conservation, San Lorenzo church is a collection of materials and construction techniquesmoreÂ Â» throughout a period of more than a millennium. Mortars were investigated in order to compare the binders used for structural elements built in different historical ages. From an archaeological study, samples of mortars attributed to the late Roman period, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance were available. The binder of each sample was separated by the aggregates and it was characterised on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Constituents of the binder were identified and their origin is discussed in order to investigate if they could be attributed to the original composition of the binder or to possible alteration in time due to atmospheric pollution. Results show that, even though the binder is mainly based on magnesian lime, there are significant differences in the microstructure of the binding matrix used in mortars ascribed to the different historical periods. In the Roman period, in correspondence of the structural elements that required higher strength, also hydraulic cocciopesto mortars were detected. Gypsum was found in most samples, which was maybe added intentionally. - Highlights: â¢ Binders of mortars of San Lorenzo church in Milan were investigated. â¢ Roman, Middle Ages and Renaissance samples were studied by XRD, TG and SEM. â¢ Magnesian-lime binders containing silico\n\nCryogenic Design of the Setup for MARE-1 in Milan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchaeffer, D.; Arnaboldi, C.; Ceruti, G.; Ferri, E.; Kilbourne, C.; Kraft-Bermuth, S.; Margesin, B.; McCammon, D.; Monfardini, A.; Nucciotti, A.; Pessina, G.; Previtali, E.; Sisti, M.\n\n2008-05-01\n\nA large worldwide collaboration is growing around the project of Micro-calorimeter Arrays for a Rhenium Experiment (MARE) for a direct calorimetric measurement of the neutrino mass.

Our experiment in Milan is based on compensated doped silicon implanted thermistor arrays made in NASA/GSFC and on AgReO4 crystals. We present here the design of the cryogenic system that integrates all the requirements for such experiment (electronics for high impedances, low parasitic capacitances, low micro-phonic noise).\n\nPhosphoric acid fuel cell 1.3 MW plant in Milan\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nColombo, M.; Vigano, A.\n\n1997-07-01\n\nAt the end of the 80`s Aem, ENEA and Ansaldo Ricerche began to design and build a 1.3 MW phosphoric-acid-fuel-cell power plant for the production of electrical power and heat; this plant was built and installed in the Bicocca site, in the north-east area of Milan, where a great development is being promoted. Aem has been taking over the plant since July 1995. Its aim is to test the extensively advantages of this technology for both conversion efficiency and low environmental impact. The experimentation will have to recognize the key elements in order to plan and create the multi-megawatt plantsmoreÂ Â» with the phosphoric acid technology, opening the experimentation to international partners, like users, industries and Universities interested in the development and the application of these new systems of energy cogeneration.Â«Â less\n\nCarlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, in the Midst of Religious Disciplining, Pastoral Renewal and Christian Education (1564-1584)\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPatrizi, Elisabetta\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe twenty year period of pastoral action of the Milan Archbishop Carlo Borromeo, are examined in the light of the \"social disciplining,\" that was a basic component of the Reform, and a sign of the evolution of the modern State and society after the Tridentine turning point.

In the strategic plan for poliomyelitis eradication, the environmental surveillance of poliovirus (PV) has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an activity that can complement the surveillance of polio. Having wastewater samples available for PV surveillance allows us to study nonpolio enteroviruses (NPEVs) circulating in the study population, which are widely spread. This study was carried out according to the WHO guidelines for environmental surveillance of PV and analysed the circulation of PV and NPEVs through the isolation of viruses in cell cultures in Milan area; from 2006 to 2010, 321 wastewater samples were collected, regularly over time, at the inlet of three diverse waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). Culturable HEVs were isolated in 80% of sewage samples: all isolates belonged to the HEV-B group and those circulating more intensely were CVB5 and Echo 6, while CVB4 was the predominant serotype found in 2010. In this study, two type 2 PVs were isolated, both characterized as Sabin like. Environmental monitoring of HEVs in Milan has proved to be an interesting tool to investigate the circulation and distribution of viruses. The detection of PV and other NPEV could be predictive of possible re-emergence of these viruses with an impact on public health. NPEV monitoring could also be a powerful public health tool to investigate the possible role of NPEV in different clinical manifestations.

PM10 characterisation included elements (Mg-Pb), main inorganic ions (NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-), SO(4)(2-)), levoglucosan and its isomers (mannosan and galactosan), and organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC). PMF resolved seven factors that were assigned to construction works, re-suspended dust, secondary sulphate, traffic, industry, secondary nitrate, and wood burning. Multi Linear Regression was applied to obtain the PM10 source apportionment. The 4-hour temporal resolution allowed the estimation of the factor contributions during peculiar episodes, which would have not been detected with the traditional 24-hour sampling strategy.

We conclude that the first field harmonic compensation of beam off-centering is ineffective in the region of the operating diagram where the Walkinshaw resonance precedes the ..nu.. /SUB r/ =1 resonance. Asymmetric dee-voltage compensation is considered in these cases, and the domain of validity of the method determined. A semi-empirical relation for dee-voltage distribution is deduced, and the extraction efficiency discussed.\n\nBacterial and fungal deterioration of the Milan Cathedral marble treated with protective synthetic resins.\n\nPubMed\n\nCappitelli, Francesca; Principi, Pamela; Pedrazzani, Roberta; Toniolo, Lucia; Sorlini, Claudia\n\n2007-10-15\n\nSurfaces are continuously exposed to physical, chemical and biological degradation. Among the biological agents that cause deterioration, microorganisms are of critical importance. This work is part of a research programme for the characterisation of the alterations of the Milan Cathedral (Italy). Four stone samples of the Milan Cathedral were chemically analysed and the microbiological growth assessed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that calcite was always present in each sample and one sample was also characterised by the chemical form of alteration gypsum. Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) together with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), it was possible to prove that the samples were consolidated with the synthetic acrylics and epoxy resins. The green-black biological patinas of the specimens were studied using cultivation, microscope observations and a method for single-cell detection. Sampling for fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH), with ribosomal RNA targeted oligonucleotide probes, was also performed using adhesive tapes. The bulk of the prokaryotes were Bacteria but some Archaea were also found. The bacterial cells were further characterised using specific probes for Cyanobacteria, and alpha-, beta-and gamma-Proteobacteria. In addition, black fungi isolated from the stone and the fungi of the standard ASTM G21-96(2002) method were employed to test if the detected synthetic resins could be used as the sole source of carbon and energy. One isolated Cladosporium sp. attacked the freshly dried acrylic resin. Results show that the detected bacteria and fungi can cause severe damage both to the stone monument and its synthetic consolidants.\n\nIntegrating Laser Scanner and Bim for Conservation and Reuse: \"the Lyric Theatre of Milan\"\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUtica, G.; Pinti, L.; Guzzoni, L.; Bonelli, S.; Brizzolari, A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe paper underlines the importance to apply a methodology that integrates the Building Information Modeling (BIM), Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and the Laser Scanner tool in conservation and reuse projects. As it is known, the laser scanner technology provides a survey of the building object which is more accurate rather than that carried out using traditional methodologies. Today most existing buildings present their attributes in a dispersed way, stored and collected in paper documents, in sheets of equipment information, in file folders of maintenance records. In some cases, it is difficult to find updated technical documentation and the research of reliable data can be a cost and time-consuming process. Therefore, this new survey technology, embedded with BIM systems represents a valid tool to obtain a coherent picture of the building state. The following case consists in the conservation and reuse project of Milan Lyric Theatre, started in 2013 from the collaboration between the Milan Polytechnic and the Municipality. This project first attempts to integrate these new techniques which are already professional standards in many other countries such as the US, Norway, Finland, England and so on. Concerning the methodology, the choice has been to use BIM software for the structured analysis of the project, with the aim to define a single code of communication to develop a coherent documentation according to rules in a consistent manner and in tight schedules. This process provides the definition of an effective and efficient operating method that can be applied to other projects.\n\nAgip oil discovery near Milan may fuel Italy's next expansion\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNot Available\n\n1988-06-20\n\nA promising crude oil discovery by Agip SpA just over 18 miles northwest of Milan could set Italy on course for another substantial expansion in oil production. Flow was boosted last year by the start-up of output from the country's biggest oil deposit, the Vega field offshore Sicily. Vega production is scheduled to reach a peak of 60,000 b/d, but the average production for 1988 is expected to be only 25,000 b/d because of water production problems. Italian crude-oil production averaged 80,137 b/d during 1987 with Agip contributing 47,260 b/d. This year output it projected to rise to more thanmoreÂ Â» 82,000 b/d. Development of Agip's new discovery is likely to be fraught with difficulties.

Electrotherapy already represented an important therapeutic approach for nervous system diseases, although not specifically for rabies. In the present paper, the authors discuss the use of electrotherapy in the treatment of humans affected by rabies in an experimental study conducted at the Maggiore Hospital of Milan, with the aim of establishing the discovery of a possible specific therapy. By analyzing the printed scientific sources available in the Braidense Library of Milan, the authors describe four experiments conducted on patients of different ages. Symptoms and effects both during and after the electrotherapy are also highlighted. The experiments demonstrated that electricity is not an effective therapy in the treatment of rabies, being rather able to cause serious functional and organic alterations in all the patients. Analyzing the Milanese experiments, the authors reported specific Italian history of a scientific and medical approach to rabies at the end of the 18th century, which led to the promotion of health education, reinforced prevention strategies and opened the way to the vaccination era.\n\nObservations on self-incineration characteristics in 24 years (1993-2016) of autopsies in the city of Milan.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmadasi, Alberto; Boracchi, Michele; Gentile, Guendalina; Maciocco, Francesca; Maghin, Francesca; Zoja, Riccardo\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSelf-incineration is one of the most dramatic and lethal suicide methods. It is rarely reported in Western countries and is more frequent in developing regions. We illustrate the forensic cases of self-immolation occurring over 24 years in the city of Milan, Italy, highlighting the main issues of such a complex and rare suicide. We selected 33 cases of self-incineration among 23,417 autopsies (4022 suicides) performed at the Department of Legal Medicine of the University of Milan over a period of 24 years (1993-2016). Several parameters were included and analysed: gender and age of the victims, pathological history, previous suicide intentions/attempts, duration of burning, place of death or discovery of the corpse, circumstantial data of fatal events and autopsy findings, with particular attention to thermal injuries. Self-incineration was found in 0.8% of total suicides and 0.14% of total autopsies. One of these cases involved a complex modality (association with plastic-bag suffocation). The typical characteristics of the victim were an Italian man with psychiatric illness, frequently moved by passion, existential discomfort and economic problems. During the 24-year period, the number of cases of self-incineration progressively reduced. This study provides a general overview in one of the biggest metropolitan Italian areas and is one of the few works performed on this topic. It may be helpful in understanding and studying such an unusual manner of suicide.\n\nAlpha-fetoprotein and (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography predict tumor recurrence better than Milan criteria in living donor liver transplantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHong, Geun; Suh, Kyung-Suk; Suh, Suk-Won; Yoo, Tae; Kim, Hyeyoung; Park, Min-Su; Choi, YoungRok; Paeng, Jin Chul; Yi, Nam-Joon; Lee, Kwang-Woong\n\n2016-04-01\n\nGiven the organ shortage for liver transplantation (LT) and the limitations of the current morphology-based selection criteria, improved criteria are needed to achieve the maximum benefit of LT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We hypothesized that a combination of biological markers may better predict the prognosis than the Milan criteria. HCC patients (n=123) with preoperative data on serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) positivity underwent live-donor LT between January 2003 and December 2009. The cut-off values for serum AFP levels (200 ng/ml) and (18)F-FDG PET positivity (1.10) for tumor recurrence were determined by c-statistics using receiver operating characteristic curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses with preoperative variables were performed to find pre-transplant prognostic factors. Disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates were analysed with regard to serum AFP levels and (18)F-FDG PET positivity. The 5-year disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates were 80.3% and 81.6% respectively. (18)F-FDG PET positivity (hazard ratio (HR) 9.766, 95% CI 3.557-26.816; p<0.001) and serum AFP level (HR 6.234, 95% CI 2.643-14.707; p<0.001) were the only significant pre-transplant prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis; tumor number and size were not significant. A combination of criteria showed that the biologically high-risk group (AFP level â©¾200 ng/ml and PET-positive) had an HR of 29.069 (95% CI 8.797-96.053; p<0.001) compared with the double-negative group. Use of the Milan criteria yielded an HR of 1.351 (95% CI 0.500-3.652; p=0.553). The combination of the serum AFP level and (18)F-FDG PET data predicted better outcomes than those using the Milan criteria, improving objectivity when adult-to-adult living donor LT is contemplated.

The study focused on the CERCLA site and selected RCRA regulated units identified by previous studies as potential sources of contamination. A broad range of chemicals including metals, explosives, and other organic compounds were found in source areas and in groundwater. The results of a risk assessment indicate that unacceptable levels of human health risks potentially exist. Conceptual models of sitemoreÂ Â» and unit characteristics were formulated to explain major findings, and areas not contributing to the problem were identified. For many source areas, major unknowns exist regarding hydrology, extent of contamination, and current and future impacts to groundwater quality.Â«Â less\n\nA rare moderateâsized (Mw 4.9) earthquake in Kansas: Rupture process of the Milan, Kansas, earthquake of 12 November 2014 and its relationship to fluid injection\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nChoy, George; Rubinstein, Justin L.; Yeck, William; McNamara, Daniel E.; Mueller, Charles; Boyd, Oliver\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe largest recorded earthquake in Kansas occurred northeast of Milan on 12 November 2014 (MwÂ 4.9) in a region previously devoid of significant seismic activity. Applying multistation processing to data from local stations, we are able to detail the rupture process and rupture geometry of the mainshock, identify the causative fault plane, and delineate the expansion and extent of the subsequent seismic activity. The earthquake followed rapid increases of fluid injection by multiple wastewater injection wells in the vicinity of the fault. The source parameters and behavior of the Milan earthquake and foreshockâaftershock sequence are similar to characteristics of other earthquakes induced by wastewater injection into permeable formations overlying crystalline basement. This earthquake also provides an opportunity to test the empirical relation that uses felt area to estimate moment magnitude for historical earthquakes for Kansas.\n\nMicroRNA Profile Predicts Recurrence after Resection in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma within the Milan Criteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSato, Fumiaki; Hatano, Etsuro; Kitamura, Koji; Myomoto, Akira; Fujiwara, Takeshi; Takizawa, Satoko; Tsuchiya, Soken; Tsujimoto, Gozoh; Uemoto, Shinji; Shimizu, Kazuharu\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is difficult to manage due to the high frequency of post-surgical recurrence. Early detection of the HCC recurrence after liver resection is important in making further therapeutic options, such as salvage liver transplantation. In this study, we utilized microRNA expression profiling to assess the risk of HCC recurrence after liver resection. Methods We examined microRNA expression profiling in paired tumor and non-tumor liver tissues from 73 HCC patients who satisfied the Milan Criteria. We constructed prediction models of recurrence-free survival using the Cox proportional hazard model and principal component analysis. The prediction efficiency was assessed by the leave-one-out cross-validation method, and the time-averaged area under the ROC curve (ta-AUROC). Results The univariate Cox analysis identified 13 and 56 recurrence-related microRNAs in the tumor and non-tumor tissues, such as miR-96. The number of recurrence-related microRNAs was significantly larger in the non-tumor-derived microRNAs (N-miRs) than in the tumor-derived microRNAs (T-miRs, P<0.0001). The best ta-AUROC using the whole dataset, T-miRs, N-miRs, and clinicopathological dataset were 0.8281, 0.7530, 0.7152, and 0.6835, respectively. The recurrence-free survival curve of the low-risk group stratified by the best model was significantly better than that of the high-risk group (Log-rank: Pâ=â0.00029). The T-miRs tend to predict early recurrence better than late recurrence, whereas N-miRs tend to predict late recurrence better (P<0.0001). This finding supports the concept of early recurrence by the dissemination of primary tumor cells and multicentric late recurrence by the âfield effectâ. Conclusion microRNA profiling can predict HCC recurrence in Milan criteria cases.

In this perspective the CALGRID modelling system has been applied to Milan metropolitan area, located in the Po Valley, the most industrialised and populated area in Italy. For the first modelling exercise, a simulation domain of 100Ã100 km 2 has been considered and a summer period, characterised by high photochemical activity, has been selected. Hourly emissions have been derived by spatially and temporally disaggregating national inventories data, while standard upper-air and ground-based meteorological data have been used as input to the CALMET pre-processor. A careful analysis of simulation results versus local network monitoring data has revealed some critical points, related to both modelling assumptions and practical data availability. A satisfactory reproduction of daytime ozone behaviour has been, in fact, accomplished, both in urban and suburban sites, while nighttime primary pollutants accumulations and consequent ozone consumption simulated by the model have not found correspondence in the measurements. Nitrogen dioxide has been also successfully modelled, mostly in city surroundings, whereas higher discrepancies have been found in some urban stations. Possible explanations of these facts are discussed in the paper, giving an insight for further work.\n\nAn air-mass trajectory study of the transport of radioactivity from Fukushima to Thessaloniki, Greece and Milan, Italy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIoannidou, A.; Giannakaki, E.; Manolopoulou, M.; Stoulos, S.; Vagena, E.; Papastefanou, C.; Gini, L.; Manenti, S.; Groppi, F.\n\n2013-08-01\n\nAnalyses of 131I, 137Cs and 134Cs in airborne aerosols were carried out in daily samples at two different sites of investigation: Thessaloniki, Greece (40Â° N) and Milan, Italy (45Â° N) after the Fukushima accident during the period of March-April, 2011. The radionuclide concentrations were determined and studied as a function of time. The 131I concentration in air over Milan and Thessaloniki peaked on April 3-4, 2011, with observed activities 467 Î¼Bq m-3 and 497 Î¼Bq m-3, respectively. The 134Cs/137Cs activity ratio values in air were around 1 in both regions, related to the burn-up history of the damaged nuclear fuel of the destroyed nuclear reactor. The high 131I/137Cs ratio, observed during the first days after the accident, followed by lower values during the following days, reflects not only the initial release ratio but also the different volatility, attachment and removal of the two isotopes during transportation due to their different physico-chemical properties. No artificial radionuclides could be detected in air after April 28, 2011 in both regions of investigation. The different maxima of airborne 131I and 134,137Cs in these two regions were related to long-range air mass transport from Japan, across the Pacific and to Central Europe. Analysis of backward trajectories was used to confirm the arrival of artificial radionuclides following atmospheric transport and processing. HYSPLIT backward trajectories were applied for the interpretation of activity variations of measured radionuclides.\n\nIncreased arterial smooth muscle Ca2+ signaling, vasoconstriction, and myogenic reactivity in Milan hypertensive rats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLinde, Cristina I.; Karashima, Eiji; Raina, Hema; Zulian, Alessandra; Wier, Withrow G.; Hamlyn, John M.; Ferrari, Patrizia; Blaustein, Mordecai P.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe Milan hypertensive strain (MHS) rats are a genetic model of hypertension with adducin gene polymorphisms linked to enhanced renal tubular Na+ reabsorption. Recently we demonstrated that Ca2+ signaling is augmented in freshly isolated mesenteric artery myocytes from MHS rats. This is associated with greatly enhanced expression of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-1 (NCX1), C-type transient receptor potential (TRPC6) protein, and sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2) compared with arteries from Milan normotensive strain (MNS) rats. Here, we test the hypothesis that the enhanced Ca2+ signaling in MHS arterial smooth muscle is directly reflected in augmented vasoconstriction [myogenic and phenylephrine (PE)-evoked responses] in isolated mesenteric small arteries. Systolic blood pressure was higher in MHS (145 Â± 1 mmHg) than in MNS (112 Â± 1 mmHg; P < 0.001; n = 16 each) rats. Pressurized mesenteric resistance arteries from MHS rats had significantly augmented myogenic tone and reactivity and enhanced constriction to low-dose (1â100 nM) PE. Isolated MHS arterial myocytes exhibited approximately twofold increased peak Ca2+ signals in response to 5 Î¼M PE or ATP in the absence and presence of extracellular Ca2+. These augmented responses are consistent with increased vasoconstrictor-evoked sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release and increased Ca2+ entry, respectively. The increased SR Ca2+ release correlates with a doubling of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 and tripling of SERCA2 expression. Pressurized MHS arteries also exhibited a â¼70% increase in 100 nM ouabain-induced vasoconstriction compared with MNS arteries. These functional alterations reveal that, in a genetic model of hypertension linked to renal dysfunction, multiple mechanisms within the arterial"
