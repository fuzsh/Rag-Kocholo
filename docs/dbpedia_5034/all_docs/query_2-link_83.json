        "text": "When Simon Brown speaks his voice belies the hardened warrior that lurks deep inside. A tinge of a light Jamaican accent is heard and images of him landing devastating left hooks couldn’t be further from the back of one’s mind. But for a period in the late eighties and early nineties, Brown was on the pound for pound lists, a fierce puncher who ruled the welterweight division, his reputation such that getting fellow elite fighters to share the ring with him would become virtually impossible as they preferred to look in an alternative direction.\n\nBorn 15 August 1963 in Clarendon, Jamaica, Brown was the fourth of six children. His mother and father earned their living growing yams, bananas and sugar cane. The children were all given their own spot to plant and Brown is of the opinion that this taught him patience, the patience of the seasons and how long things took to grow. He would be reminded of this patience when problems raised their head later in his career. After spending his formative years here, his family decided a move to Washington D.C. would provide more opportunities for them all. In 1974, his mother and father travelled to set things up as his grandparents took care of him and his siblings, with the children joining them two years later. However, fate may have played a part in this decision, as it was here that the young Simon first discovered the noble art.\n\nHis family never had a television in Jamaica but upon moving to the States this changed. And the world of boxing opened up to Brown when he was able to view the likes of Sugar Ray Leonard and Michael and Leon Spinks at the 1976 Olympics. It changed his life forever. He was hooked.\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nPepe Correa ran the Latin Connection boxing club and had built the makeshift gym in a corner of the basement at the Calvary Methodist Church, fashioned with hemp rope, exposed pipes and crumbling brick. The bags were held together with masking tape and sometimes the ring would collapse, sending both boxers tumbling and becoming tangled in the fraying ropes. The Ritz it wasn’t. One day a 14 year old Brown walked in with a friend named “Poochy”. He sat watching the boxers go through their routine before asking if he could try. But he didn’t take to it straight away.\n\nThe sessions were three hours long and Brown discovered that he didn’t particularly like getting hit. When it was time to spar, he shied away, even going as far as to wear a bandage around his knee to feign an injury. But the technical side of the sport had fascinated him. He would call Correa late at night asking to show him how to throw a certain punch. Then one day the bandage came off.\n\n“The real Simon Brown emerged” recalled Correa, “So I took him in to the ring. One day he caught my attention with a couple of left hooks. He was 132 lbs and he stung me. That’s when I knew he’d be somebody”.\n\nTwo years later, Brown had become so smooth that he had been given the same nickname as former welterweight champion Jose Napoles, “Mantequella”, translated from Spanish as ‘butter’. High praise indeed. It was also around this time that he would strike up a lifelong friendship with another boxer who would play an integral role, both personally and professionally, in his life; Maurice Blocker.\n\nThe pair became inseparable, meeting outside the gym after school at around 5pm. They were the most regular of all the kids, following Correa’s rules, “No cursing, no fighting outside of the ring”, and listening to his philosophy of life. But they rarely sparred in those days as Correa was unwillingly to put pressure on their friendship. That would be tested much later.\n\nLesson From A Legend\n\nBrown had just sixteen amateur bouts, and as he prepared to make his professional debut, a surprise guest made an appearance at the Colombia gym in Northwest Washington D.C. Hitting the heavy bag, Brown noticed that everyone in the gym appeared to stop what they were doing. He turned to see that guest was none other than “Sugar” Ray Leonard. “I lit up” said Brown, “There he was. Wow! To see him there, it was unbelievable”.\n\nHe returned to hitting the bag when all of a sudden Leonard was beside him. “You’re throwing the hook too wide” he said “Throw it this way”. Leonard then demonstrated, throwing several short left hooks in the air. “See, real snappy, real short”. Brown absorbed the advice, firing a series of hooks on the bag. “That’s it, now you’ve got it” acknowledged Leonard, “Keep them short, snappy”. The lesson was brief but the impact was everlasting. “Ray was my idol” Brown said, “I wanted to be like him so much”.\n\nHe made his leap in to the professional world on 16 February 1982. But it wasn’t meant to originally be his introduction. Blocker was scheduled to make his debut that day and Brown went to support his friend. But at the weigh-in it transpired that a fighter named Ricky Williams was scheduled to appear but his opponent had been a no-show. Correa put Brown’s name forward and he obliged, winning a points decision over four.\n\nHe reeled off a further 16 wins, 13 inside schedule, as his ring education caught momentum. In early 1984 though, that education was taken to unprecedented heights when he was brought in to help Leonard prepare for his comeback fight against Kevin Howard. Six weeks of sparring three to four rounds, five days a week, elevated both his skill set and belief.\n\n“No one could do anything to me after that”, Brown remembered, “After I stepped into the ring with him, I knew I would never fear another man again. What could anyone do to me that he hadn’t?”.\n\nBack in action, he won his next four before challenging for his first title, the USBA welterweight title, held by the vastly more experienced Marlon Starling. Starling (34-3, 20 KO’s) had shared the ring with some of the best in the division, with wins over Floyd Mayweather Sr (twice), Tommy Ayers, Lupe Aquino and Kevin Howard. He had also twice lost close decisions to WBA & IBF champion Donald Curry. He would go on to become a two-time champion but for now, he was a test that many could not pass.\n\nThe First Defeat\n\nOn 22 November 1985, Brown found out just what it would take to earn a seat at the top table of the 147 lb division as he surrendered his unbeaten record to ‘The Magic Man”. The relaxed, smooth, low-left hand style that had proved so effective against lesser opposition was dissected this night against one of boxing’s finest ring generals. Boxing behind his high guard, Starling countered Brown’s jab continually throughout with the overhand right, pushing him back, and generally outworking the young prospect. Tellingly, Brown’s best work came when up close, planting his feet and ripping short hooks, a blueprint that was being laid for his future. After twelve rounds a split decision, that should have been unanimous, was awarded to Starling. For Brown it was time to reflect and rebuild.\n\nHe returned to action four months later with a seventh round stoppage of fringe contender Kevin Howard. But it was his next opponent that would help raise his profile to a higher level.\n\nCanada’s Shawn O’Sullivan was a decorated amateur and had won silver at the 1984 Olympics, with many believing that he was robbed in the final against Frank Tate. Unbeaten in eleven fights, eight inside the distance, O’Sullivan was being fast-tracked up the rankings, managed and advised by none other than “Sugar” Ray Leonard. Brown was selected as the opponent to springboard him in to the top ten.\n\nTravelling to Toronto, Canada on 8 June 1986, Brown demonstrated that the step O’Sullivan was attempting to make was more of a chasm. As O’Sullivan advanced, Brown, now defensively tighter than against Starling, tagged his upright opponent with right hands and used his shoulder and subtle movement to avoid being caught cleanly. On the occasions he was, he would blast back with sharp counters. By the third, it was obvious that O’Sullivan was in over his head. Brown blasted him throughout until a big left hook right hand combination sent him reeling in to a corner. A couple of heavy follow up shots forced the referee to intervene. Brown was now ready to prove he was a major player.\n\nLost Momentum\n\nIn the aftermath of victory, Correa called out the names of reigning champion Donald Curry and Leonard as prospective opponents. Leonard had been highly impressed with Brown. “I think he has power and speed, the ingredients to be a champion”, he said. “He changes style during a fight; sometimes he’s the fighter, then the boxer”.\n\nHowever, behind the scenes Brown’s relationship with Correa had been unravelling. Correa had a falling out with the promoter he had found for Brown, Don Elbaum. As a result of this, Elbaum sued the pair for breach of contract. An out of court settlement was reached, but Brown was fuming for having to pay a percentage to Elbaum for something that he had been caught up in the middle of. “I didn’t trust my career in his hands anymore”, Brown said of Correa.\n\nHe then made a huge decision to remain inactive until his contract with Correa expired. It was a huge blow and any publicity he had gained from his victory over O’Sullivan would be lost. But Brown stubbornly refused to fight.\n\nHe trained everyday, but financially, times were tough. As previous funds ran low, old “friends” from the streets started rolling by in their flash cars and cash on the hip, trying out their speil on Brown; “You’re not fighting, you’re only training? You’re crazy! You could make money dealing or running. You can make a thousand dollars a night dealing cocaine”.\n\n“It was tempting”, he said, even telling his wife Lisa who told him “I love you, but if you go that way I won’t be with you”. But he had been raised by a deeply religious mother. “She knew what was out there”, Brown said “A lot of my friends were dead or in jail. I’d never even been arrested. It wasn’t for me. I’d rather starve”.\n\nTheir respective families helped them with extras they needed until Elbaum came to see him with business partner Allen Baboian. Baboian instantly took to Brown whom he saw as a decent family man. Knowing of his struggles he wrote Brown a cheque for $5000. “You don’t have to sign with me for this”, Baboian reassured him, “If you decide you want to sign with someone else, fine. Life goes on. Just pay some of your bills. I want to make sure your mind is clear”.\n\nIt wasn’t just clear, it was made up. Brown wanted Baboian as his new manager. “He took a chance on me when I didn’t have a dime”, acknowledged Brown.\n\nKick-start\n\nAfter fifteen months out, Brown returned on 25 September 1987 stopping one Dexter Smith in six rounds to shake off some ring rust. The following month welterweight champion Lloyd Honeyghan lost his WBC title to Jorge Vaca in a big upset. But as his IBF title wasn’t up for grabs, the title was declared vacant. The door was now wide open for Brown to face top contender Tyrone Trice to find a successor.\n\nDetroit’s Trice was a sharp and heavy handed puncher. With twenty eight wins against just one reverse, he had halted twenty three of his opponents. It would be his first title opportunity too.\n\nChampion..In A War\n\nThe pair met at the Palais des Sports in Berck-sur Mer, France on 23 April 1988. And what a fight they produced. Trice started the faster as Brown, fighting more flat-footed and aggressive, appeared a little off pace and rusty. Trice was anything but as he caught Brown with stiff rights. In round two, Brown got a complete demonstration of Trice’s power when his legs were buckled by a left hook. Struggling to remain upright, Brown staggered in to the ropes where a follow up right sent him crashing to the canvas. It was the first time he had been knocked down and he was in trouble. Surviving the round, he now knew the size of task he had to overcome.\n\nTrice took the next two rounds as Brown started to warm in to battle. From the fifth round on, Brown started to find his rhythm, his jab setting up shots to Trice lean torso. Trice early assault had taken a huge amount out of him as he now became the pursued.\n\nBrown almost dropped Trice in round ten when a right had Trice buckling like a drunk uncle at a wedding. Gamely he survived that, and also the eleventh, as Brown searched for the finisher. And in round twelve it looked like he found it. A short left hook sent Trice down by the ropes. Almost on instinct he rose but it wasn’t long before a second knockdown followed. He rose once again, but was driven face first in to the canvas by a right hand. It looked all over but, astonishingly, Trice peeled himself off of the floor as the the bell rang to save him. Brown had flung himself on to the canvas in celebration before being told the fight was still on.\n\nThere was no doubting that the fight should have ended there but Trice was allowed to continue. Clinging on for dear life and moving, Brown found his slippery target difficult to catch with a clean shot. Amazingly, Trice came out for the fourteenth letting his hands go. But it was one last fling of the dice. A grazing right from Brown sent him down on his front. Arising, he was in serious trouble and Brown went in for the finish, pummelling Trice until a left hook nearly separated his head from his shoulders. Referee Steve Smoger finally stopped the beating as Brown became the new IBF champion.\n\nHe became an active champ, defending his title twice before the end of the year. First up was a return to the country of his birth, Jamaica, against former WBC titleist Jorge Vaca. Brown was in devastating form, blasting Vaca to the canvas five times before it was mercifully stopped in round three. Then it was on to Switzerland where he outpointed the tough Mauro Martelli.\n\n1989 saw him rack up a further four defences, beginning with a three round demolition of Jorge Maysonet in Budapest. Mandatory challenger Al Long was knocked out in seven, whilst Bobby Joe Young was stopped in two. He rounded off the year outpointing Luis Santana, establishing himself as one of the best fighters in the sport, with his style gradually morphing in to a stalking puncher with a wrecking ball left hook.\n\nBut frustration was kicking in. Many now started to recognise him as the best welterweight in the world. But proving that was becoming the problem. As talented as he was, his profile was low, meaning rival champs Marlon Starling (WBC) and Mark Breland (WBA) were reluctant to face him. He had come a long way since his sole loss to Starling and many felt he would reverse that result if the met again. Indeed, Starling had demanded $1mlllion to face Brown but had then accepted a lower payday to step up TWO divisions to meet IBF middleweight champion Michael Nunn.\n\nThere were also rumours that Julio Cesar Chavez was on the verge of moving up to 147. “Fighting Chavez would be a good challenge”, said Brown. “I’m not making a million dollars a fight, but I’m doing it the right way. I’m keeping busy. I’m a champion and I can’t waste it. I’ll make a million dollars some day. By god, I’m making it!!”.\n\nHis next defence was a rematch with Trice, this time at home in Washington. On 1 April 1990 at the DC Armory, the pair put on another entertaining fight, although less enthralling than their previous one. Brown had grown in to his role as champion and it showed from the start.\n\nTrice opted to try to keep things at length this time, and counter Brown on the way in. But Brown’s pressure and intensity forced Trice to work and defend harder than he had anticipated. Landing the occasional hard shot, Trice was coming off second best as Brown slammed home hooks to the head and body, remembering how hard this man had made it for him last time. Brown broke through in round eight when a big left hook sent Trice stumbling to backwards to the canvas. He survived the round, and the ninth, but Brown closed the show in round ten when a barrage of punches drove Trice limply to the ropes, forcing the referee’s intervention.\n\nUnsettlement within his camp had seen Brown change trainers for a few fights, dispensing with Correa to briefly hook up with Teddy Atlas before moving on to former world champion Emile Griffith. Now he wanted a big fight to showcase his talent and bank balance. But the only fighter prepared to meet him was also his best friend: WBC champion Maurice Blocker.\n\nBlocker (32-1, 18 KO’s) had outpointed Starling to take his title after suffering his only loss three years previous in his first title effort against Lloyd Honeyghan. Known for being more of a boxer than puncher, ‘The “Thin Man” not only possessed the skills to trouble Brown but also had intimate knowledge of his friend’s strengths and weaknesses. Both men knew it was the only way they could both make a decent payday. “Neither one of us are taking this personally”, said Blocker, “This is just a competitive sport”. But how would they handle putting their friendship aside to do battle for twelve rounds?\n\nUnification…With A Tear\n\nOn 18 March 1991 at the Mirage Hotel, Las Vegas, Brown and Blocker put on one of the best welterweight fights since Leonard vs Hearns ten years previous. And as chief support to the main event of Mike Tyson vs Razor Ruddock, their battle was seen worldwide.\n\nBrown came out throwing a wide left hook, missing but raising gasps from the crowd. However, the point was made; he meant business. He pressed forward, looking to land bombs. But Blocker drew on their ring time together, offsetting Brown with a snappy jab and well placed hooks and uppercuts. While it was obvious that Brown possessed the heavier artillery, Blocker’s activity banked the first two rounds.\n\nBrown started the third more purposely, bringing a strong jab in to play. A high left hook sent Blocker stumbling in to the ropes, eliciting a roar from the crowd. He was intent on ending matters early but Blocker fiddled his way through the round. Round four saw the action pick up. Brown slammed home several big rights as Blocker stood in the pocket with him, outworking him with flurries. But Brown’s shots were having the bigger impact.\n\nRounds 5 & 6 continued the pattern, although Blocker showed a tremendous chin as he absorbed a vicious right uppercut. Going in to round seven it was still all up for grabs. Blocker’s strategy of letting two and three punches go before tying Brown and keeping him off balance, was being executed superbly as he took the next three rounds. Brown’s frustration was evident as he searched for that one fight ending punch.\n\nAnd in the opening minute of round ten, the explosive power of Brown resurfaced. A right cross set up a huge left hook that buckled Blocker’s knees before he involuntarily fell backwards to the canvas. Bravely rising, both men now faced their worse moment; Brown now had to go in for the finish. Blocker did everything he could to try to ride out the storm, holding on when close and then trying to stay at distance. But Brown knew he had to bring this fight, the one neither truly wanted, to a conclusion. One final clean right hand sent a dazed Blocker staggering across the ring as referee Mills Lane stepped between them. It was a truly, bittersweet victory.\n\nBrown briefly, reluctantly, raised his arms in celebration before rushing his way to tightly embrace his best friend. Business can be brutal, but he was now the WBC & IBF champion. Big fights would surely now come his way.\n\nBut he made sure his best friend’s career could also continue at the same level, relinquishing the IBF belt, knowing Blocker would fight Glenwood Brown for the vacant title. Blocker won, becoming champion again on points. Brown would now prepare to face a very tough challenge in the shape of number one contender James “Buddy” McGirt.\n\nBeaten By Buddy…And The Scales\n\nThe plan was for Brown to get by McGirt and then land a big fight with Julio Cesar Chavez or move up to face Terry Norris. But McGirt was one of the most stylish and smoothest fighters in the sport.\n\nA former IBF junior welterweight champion, McGirt (54-2-1, 43 KO’s) had been on a sixteen fight win streak since losing his title to Meldrick Taylor. He was a throwback fighter with slick counterpunching skills and had been waiting three years for another title opportunity.\n\nThey met on 29 November 1991, The Mirage in Las Vegas playing host. Brown was expected to overpower the smaller McGirt but unbeknownst to many, he was battling two opponents that night.\n\nBrown had been struggling to stay at 147 lbs for a while now. But the preparation for this fight really brought home to him that his time in this division was over. He had hardly eaten in the week before the fight, going from over 170 lbs down to the welterweight limit. Even the night before the fight he had to lose 4 1/2 pounds. It was a huge amount to take off. And it would come at a price.\n\nFacing McGirt at full strength would have been hard enough but Brown was facing a lost cause. He was outboxed from the get go, with McGirt dominant behind his jab and sharp combinations. Never able to get set due to McGirt’s tactics, Brown was reduced to following his opponent for round after round with limited success. And each round took that bit more out of him. In round ten, he walked on to a left hook that sent him tumbling face first to the canvas. Wearily rising, he survived the round. It was the cherry on the cake for McGirt as he continued his display, taking Brown’s crown with a one-sided unanimous decision.\n\nBrown spent five days in hospital after, suffering the effects of dehydration. “I’m not fighting anymore at welterweight”, he said after, “I’ve been at this weight since 1979”.\n\nMoving On Up\n\nBrown parted ways with trainer Griffith, replacing him with Ritchie Giachetti on the recommendation of Don King who had been promoting Brown. But this pairing only lasted for Brown’s first two fights in ’92 at junior middleweight before he reunited with Adrian Davis, whom had been a part of his camp a while back. Davis wanted to take Brown back to his boxing more, feeling that he had become over-reliant on his power.\n\nThree wins to start 1993 put Brown in line for a shot at division leader and WBC champion “Terrible” Terry Norris. Norris (36-3, 22 KO’s) was an explosive boxer-puncher who sat very high on many experts pound for pound list. Having effectively “retired” “Sugar” Ray Leonard and Donald Curry whilst making ten defences of his title, he had established himself as one of the hottest fighters in boxing.\n\nBut a grudge existed between the two. They were originally meant to have met the previous year on 26 September 1992. But just hours before the fight, Brown pulled out citing dizziness and feeling unwell. It was later confirmed to be an inner ear infection. Norris was more dismissive though, claiming that Brown was running scared. Rubbing his nose in it further, Norris then destroyed Blocker in just two rounds in February. Brown vowed to gain revenge for the pair of them.\n\nUpset …And Revenge\n\nBrown was well aware of the task in front of him, acknowledging that he had to treat this like it could very well be his last chance to become world champion. He spent a month in Mexico beforehand, acclimatising to the altitude. A big underdog, he had prepared diligently for this moment.\n\nOn 18 December at the Estadio Cuauhtemoc, Puebla, Brown came out cautiously behind his jab. But Norris had been on a path of destruction lately and he felt he could go through Brown, staying on top of him and ripping in tight, short punches. His power was evident, but Brown always had a sturdy beard. The same could not always be said of the defending champion.\n\nAs the end of the round approached, Brown stepped in with a heavy jab. The punch connected on the side of Norris jaw and it looked like someone had yanked a rug out from under his feet. He hit the canvas, flat on his back. As he arose, it was apparent his legs weren’t quite with him. The round ended before another punch could be thrown, but Brown had made his intentions clear; he was here for the title.\n\nNorris started the second like nothing had happened, going straight on the attack. Brown took a few shots but also rode some off of his shoulder, showing the influence that Davis had made. And as the round wound down, he struck again. A thudding right hand high on Norris head took the strength from his legs again. Norris was in trouble as the bell ended the round.\n\nBut still Norris kept coming. He appeared refreshed after the rest and fired off more right hands. Brown started to connect more throughout the third. But once again, with five seconds to go, Brown caught Norris flush with a right left hook right combo that sent Norris legs splaying in all directions. As the bell sounded, he had to be helped back to his corner.\n\nEntering round four, the scent of a huge upset lingered around the arena. Brown had dropped Norris and hurt him badly twice. But the resounding question was “Could he knock him out?”. Brown started in a southpaw stance, pushing Norris back as he gained momentum. Norris was still dazed and the writing was appearing on the wall. With just a minute gone in the round, Brown slammed over a big right hand, the punch hitting Norris between the neck and back of his head. He pitched forward, rolling on to his back as he was counted out. Brown was back on top of the world.\n\nThere was no chance of resting on his laurels when just six weeks later, he defended the title against hardened challenger Troy Waters. It was an industrious display from Brown, who took a majority decision over the Australian to retain his title.\n\nNext was a return with Norris. Don King advertised the card as “Revenge: The Rematches” with four world titles on the line against former opponents. Despite his previous, convincing win, Brown was once again considered an underdog.\n\nEx-Champion\n\nAt the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on 7 May 1994, Brown surrendered the title back to Norris in a one-sided spectacle. Norris adapted his approach, this time using foot and hand speed to make himself an elusive target as he racked up the points. Brown was unable to pin down his rival and land punches like he had previously. He lost a wide, unanimous decision.\n\nAfterwards, Brown offered no excuses. “He outmoved me and he outboxed me”, he admitted before adding, “He moved a lot, I expected that, but he just wouldn’t stand still at all”.\n\nBut Brown still presented dangerous opposition against the right style of fighter. And after two comeback wins, that right fighter appeared to have been found.\n\nVincent “The Ambassador” Pettway was the reigning IBF junior middleweight champion. He had won the title off of long reigning holder Gianfranco Rosi with a fourth round knockout, having drawn their first fight. His record of 37-4-1, 1 NC, also featured 30 wins via knockout, indicating the power he carried. But his defeats also exposed his vulnerability, with all four coming inside the distance. This also included suffering several knockdown’s too along the way. It was a combination on paper that appeared to not bode well against Brown.\n\nTHAT Knockout\n\nThey met on 29 April 1995 at the US Air Arena in Landover. Brown had come looking for the knockout. He pursued the champion who had adopted a box and move approach. It was a quiet opener until, with 30 seconds left on the clock, Pettway caught Brown with a sharp left hook. Brown responded with his own, thudding high on Pettway’s head. His legs disconnected from his legs as a further hook catapulted him to the canvas. He rose but was saved by the bell.\n\nPettway got back on his bike in the second as Brown looked to repeat his earlier success. Pettway’s strategy looked sound as the challenger struggled to connect.\n\nThe pattern continued through the first part of the third. Then with just over half of the round gone, Pettway caught Brown on the end of a right hand counter. Brown’s legs stiffened as he fell back to the canvas. The crowd went wild at the sudden turn of events. Brown sat in a squatting position as he listened to the referee’s count. The action resumed and Brown’s legs were buckled with another right. The bell rang to take him out of harm’s way.\n\nBut Pettway got back on his bike in round four, failing to press his advantage. Brown caught Pettway with some stiff shots, sending a message that he was still there. Things got wild in the fifth when a low blow led to Pettway being sent half way through the bottom rope, courtesy of a follow-up right from Brown. Pettway was fuming and retaliated instantly. Unfazed, Brown kept coming. But Pettway wasn’t letting it go and punches were exchanged after the bell as each respective corner voiced their anger. The crowd were loving it.\n\nThere are moments in boxing that will stay forever etched in your mind. And midway through round six became one of them. With his back to the ropes, Pettway launched a devastating left hook, the punch detonating on to Brown’s unguarded jaw. He fell back like a chopped down tree, flat on to the canvas, his eyes closed tight. Eerily, he continued to throw jabs, his left arm flicking out involuntarily. There he lay as he was counted out for the first time in his career.\n\nSeveral months after, Brown recalled the knockout. “I was winning that fight until that split second”, he said, “I made a mistake and I paid for it…”. He continued. “I remember the punch. My hands had always been up where I could catch it. But not that time. There are always obstacles in life to overcome. This was one for me”.\n\nHis contract with King was over and he signed with promoter Bob Connelly and also re-signed with Elbaum to act as advisor.\n\nBrown moved up to middleweight, chasing a championship in a third division. However, his first fight in five months didn’t go quite as planned. In with former WBA welterweight champion Aaron Davis, Brown boxed relatively well. But in a high quality bout, he just wasn’t busy enough, dropping a unanimous decision.\n\nIt was viewed as a minor setback, but it was also a signal that Brown was in the veteran stage of his career. And he was still considered a world class opponent and a “name”. So two wins later, he was offered the chance to capture a version of the 160 lb championship. Step forward WBO king Lonnie Bradley.\n\nBradley was unbeaten (24-0, 19 KO’s) and was searching for his breakout fight. Whilst Brown wasn’t the marquee name he desired, he was still a step up from his previous competition.\n\nThey met on 30 August 1996 at the Municipal Centre, Reading, Pennsylvania. And it once again, highlighted Brown’s trouble with movers. Whilst he remained competitive in the fight, the scorecards painted a different picture. Bradley’s jab and footwork were the key. They gave him the edge in nearly every round, and he retained on a wide, unanimous decision.\n\nBut Brown still had one more title chance in him. Two victories put him next in line to face the man regarded as the number one middleweight in the world; IBF champion Bernard “The Executioner” Hopkins.\n\nLast Hurrah\n\nHopkins (33-2-1, 25 KO’s) was still in the early stages of what would turn out to be an astonishing Hall of Fame career. At this point, he was a more aggressive boxer-puncher, before his metamorphosis in to the wily technician that he became known for. Brown would be his seventh defence.\n\nAt the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, on 31 January 1998, Brown saw the beginning of the end of his career. Hopkins was just too much of everything for him, breaking the proud warrior down, before sending him to the canvas at the start of round six with a short right uppercut. Bravely rising, Brown was overwhelmed by an onslaught of punches against the ropes, whilst still trying desperately to find that one last fight changing left hook. But he was taking too much. The referee stepped in, ending his final aspirations of becoming world champion again.\n\nBrown wouldn’t see victory again, losing his final five fights against opponents he would have beaten in his prime.\n\nHis final record: 47 wins, 12 defeats, with 34 KO’s.\n\nOn 22 August 2021, he was inducted in to the Atlantic City Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter retiring, Brown became a trainer, moving to Los Angeles to work alongside his former trainer and manager Correa in the “All American Heavyweight” program. But in 2013, he was ready to move back to Maryland.\n\n“My wife Lisa and I were looking around, thinking Hagerstown is pretty good, a little more country, laid back, quiet”, he said, “so we decided to move here”.\n\nIn 2017, he opened up his own gym, The Simon Brown Boxing Academy. He works with all age groups, with the mission not just being about creating champions, but also changing lives.\n\n“It’s a lovely sport and keeps a lot of guys out of trouble”, he explained. “Instead of running on the street, they can be here, doing something instead. I try to pull all the guys that I can in, and 90 percent of the guys, I don’t charge them anything. My dream for this is to keep a lot of young guys off the streets, to stay off drugs and alcohol and stop running the streets and carrying guns. If I can pull them into this gym, that’s my goal”.\n\nReflecting on his own career and his difficulty in getting the superfight he so deserved and craved, he said “They were all scared of me. They didn’t want to get hit by this left hook. They all ran away from me as much as possible”.\n\nAnd despite his caring and thoughtful nature, a competitor still lurks deep inside. “My only regret looking back is, I wish I’d got those big, big money fights with Chavez and Breland”, he admitted, before the champion of old appeared one more time; “I’d have beaten them both”.\n\nDean Berks\n\n“They want to see blood, action and entertainment. That’s why I am here. I hate fighters who run. I am here to fight. I feel sorry for the people who buy a ticket and they have to see guys run around the ring. I am respectful of the fans who pay to see people fight. If my opponent wants to run, let him run a marathon. I am here to fight and not to run. I like fighters. I hate runners”.\n\nJorge Arce proudly made this statement in an interview with ESPN back in 2006. For him, the thought of not engaging and giving his all was unacceptable. It was this endearing attitude that made him one of the most exciting lighter weight fighters in recent memory. But it was also his diminutive frame that prevented him from gaining the same recognition as fellow pugilistic warmongers Arturo Gatti and Diego Corrales. In recent years, the rise of Roman Gonzalez, Juan Estrada and Naoya Inoue amongst others, has led to greater attention on boxing’s “little guys”, but this wasn’t always the case, with many established fighters being used to pad out pay-per-view cards or fill the lesser popular television slots, especially in the States. Thankfully, Arce did garner attention, and the ride he took fans on would etch itself in to boxing folklore.\n\nBorn in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico on 27 July 1979, Arce (Full name Jorge Armand Arce Armenta) was the eldest of two sons (his younger brother Francisco also boxed professionally). His father Oscar never had the chance to chase his dream of becoming a fighter so, aged ten, Arce decided he would live his father’s dream for him by donning the gloves. But just two years later, his father was left fighting for his life after a welding accident at the hospital where he worked had caused a fire. The young Arce went to see his father and was devastated by what he saw.\n\n“Son, I’m very tired”, his father said to him, “I’m going to go. He’s calling me”.\n\n“Who?” Arce heartbreakingly asked.\n\n“My God”, his father answered, “Take care of your Mom”.\n\n“Please don’t go”, Arce pleaded, “I promise I will be the champion of the world. If you fight, I will win the title and you will win it with me. Stay with me”.\n\n“OK”, his father replied, “I promise”.\n\nArce left the hospital, not knowing if he would ever see his father again. He went to church daily, praying that his father would recover. Approximately six months later, his mother came in one day, a big smile adorned her face.\n\n“Your dad is safe”, she said, “No more therapy”.\n\nThe news changed Arce’s world. Highly charged, he shot back to the gym with new found energy and a determination that would drive him throughout his career. He would never give up.\n\nBy the age of sixteen, Arce had decided to turn professional. He had amassed an estimated 45 fights as an amateur, losing just twice. But it was losing a disputed decision to future world champion Martin Castillo for a spot on the 1996 Olympic team that had made his mind up. He felt that Castillo had been given the decision as he was already on the team. So on 19 January 1996, ‘El Travieso’ (Mischievous Boy) made his debut with a first round knockout of Adan Aldama.\n\nHe won his next three before being stopped in the first round by future WBC light-flyweight champion Omar Romero, then drew over four with Gabriel Munoz, learning curves that can happen with such a young fighter. Undeterred, he won his next ten, picking up the Mexican and WBA Fedecentro titles along the way, before dropping a points decision to future IBF champion Victor Burgos. The loss didn’t slow him down as four straight victories earned him his first shot at major honours, the WBO light-flyweight title held by Argentinian Juan Domingo Cordoba. Cordoba had outpointed two-time titleist Melchor Cob Castro to become champion and had made one defence.\n\nOn 4 December 1998, Arce delivered on his promise to his father when he scored a fourth round knockdown en route to taking a wide unanimous decision and capturing his first world title at the tender age of 19. Beforehand, so enthralled with his opportunity, he had booked flights, hotels and food for all of his family. This prompted his promoter Fernando Beltran to bewilderedly ask;\n\n“Are you crazy? The purse is only $10,000!!”.\n\nWhen Arce explained to him the promise he had made, Beltran began to cry.\n\n“I’m so sorry”, he said, “I will pay for your family”.\n\nFour months later, Arce travelled to Italy, stopping Salvatore Fanni in six rounds in his maiden defence, before securing a big opportunity to meet former four-time champion Michael Carbajal.\n\nCarbajal had been an outstanding fighter, but it was felt that time was now catching him up. Even so, a win over him would propel Arce’s career to the next level. But on 31 July 1999, Arce was brought down to earth with a thud and shown he still had much to learn. Despite taking control of the action, basic mistakes would prove to be his undoing. He was guilty of dropping his left hand after throwing it, and when throwing a left hook to the body, he stood upright and in front of Carbajal, leaning over to try to land it, both actions that left him open for a straight right hand. And a veteran puncher like Carbajal exploited this, dropping and hurting Arce in round six. Arce survived the round, but was stunned again early in round seven. His head gradually cleared as he boxed himself back in to control. He looked like he was on his way to an impressive points win, until the former champion nailed him again with the right in round eleven. This time Arce was unable to recover as the referee stepped in to end matters. His title was gone and it was time to rebuild.\n\nHe reeled off nine straight wins, picking up the interim WBC title that took him to a shot at the champion South Korean Yo Sam Choi. Choi had made three defences but had been out of action with an injury. He would find out that returning against a much improved Arce was a decision he would soon regret. On 6 July 2002, Arce travelled to South Korea for his second title opportunity. On the attack from the first bell, Arce zeroed in with his short left hook throughout, the punch finding the target with much regularity. Choi bravely tried to punch with the relentless challenger, who had now started to find a home for his straight right on the lefthand side of Choi’s jaw, but Arce would not be denied. In the sixth round, the referee rescued Choi after he absorbed several head snapping shots. Arce was once again a world champion.\n\nHe now started to live up to his early potential. He had corrected his earlier mistakes, carrying his left hand a lot higher than before, and now combined strategic boxing with his hard punching style, breaking down opponents in his rousing manner. He defended the title three times to start 2003, before he took part in the Televisa version of Big Brother, with his engaging personality seeing him finish third.\n\nHis burgeoning career was once again on the move as he racked up a further four defences before relinquishing his title in search of further glory at flyweight. He met once beaten Australian Hussein Hussein in an eliminator for the WBC title held by Thailand’s Pongsaklek Wonjongkam. In what ESPN named their Fight of the Year, the pair set a frantic pace, the two-way exchanges typifying an Arce performance. Badly cut on the bridge of the nose, Arce eventually broke Hussein’s resistance in round ten, pounding his opponent to the canvas before his corner called a halt to matters.\n\nHowever, an opportunity against Wonjongkam was put on ice due to an injury to the champion. So Arce went in with Colombian Angel Antonio Priolo for the vacant WBC “interim” title, duly collecting with a third round stoppage. Keeping active, he rematched Hussein, this time scoring a conclusive second round win, then twice stopped former two weight champion Adonis Rivas in succession (TKO 10, TKO 6). Former three-time titleist and veteran Rosendo Alvarez was Arce’s final foe at the weight, being knocked out in round six.\n\nUnable to secure a “full” title shot, Arce set his sights on further challenges. He stepped up to super-flyweight, stopping former WBO light-flyweight belt holder Masibulele Makepula in four. His popularity had soared after finishing fourth place on TV show Dancing with the Stars, and he entered his next fight against Julio Ler, riding a horse, complete with his traditional black cowboy hat and lollipop, to a rousing ovation. Even with no title on the line, Arce was a “must watch” fighter. And he put on his usual exciting performance, outpointing Ler over twelve to cement his position as number one contender to countryman and WBC champion Christian Mijares.\n\nMijares had won the “interim” title by outpointing Japan’s Katsushige Kawashima before being upgraded to “full” champion. He was a slick southpaw but Arce was favoured to emerge victorious. But on 14 April 2007 at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, Arce found Mijares just too slick to pin down. Mijares peppered the non-stop pressing Arce with right jabs and straight lefts throughout, as Arce struggled to gain any advantage. The challenger finished a bloody mess, losing a wide, unanimous decision. It was his first defeat in eight years.\n\nHe returned five months later, stopping future champion Tomàs Rojas in a six round punch-out, then blasted out former champion Medgeon Singsurat in the opener with a vicious left hook to the body, to see out the year. He then faced once beaten Thai Devid Lookmahanak in an eliminator for the WBC title. Not too much was known about his opponent, but he almost derailed Arce’s path to another chance at championship glory. Once again he struggled against a southpaw opponent. Instead of moving to his left, Arce continually moved to his right and directly in to the path of Lookmahanak’s straight left. He was caught cleanly throughout in a tense battle, but fortunately his workrate had been enough to scrape a majority decision win. He was now the number one contender to Mijares, who by this time had added the WBA title to his WBC one.\n\nHowever, Mijares had opted to attempt to add the IBF belt to his collection, so Arce was offered a shot at WBA “interim” trinket holder Rafael Concepciòn, with the right to challenge the winner of the unification. Arce forced Concepciòn to retire after nine rounds and defended the belt two months later on the same night as Mijares unification fight. Arce stopped Isidro Garcia in four, but Mijares lost both of his titles to one of boxing’s pound for pound best, getting stopped in nine rounds. That formidable champion would now face Arce in the Mexican’s toughest test to-date.\n\nArmenian Vic Darchinyan had been a destructive force at flyweight, winning and defending the IBF title six times before shockingly getting stopped in five by a then-relatively unknown Nonito Donaire. He rebounded to knockout Dimitri Kirilov in the fifth to win the IBF super-flyweight belt before unifying against Mijares. With 26 KO’s in a 31-1-1 record, Darchinyan had refined his approach, forging him in to a more rounded fighter than before. He would be making the first defence of his newly acquired crowns.\n\nThey met on 7 February 2009 at the Honda Center, California. Arce, although the crowd favourite, entered as the underdog. And it didn’t take long to see why. With the southpaw stance once again proving to be an achilles heel for Arce, the challenger once again moved to his right and on to the powerful lefts of the champion. Darchinyan bossed the opening two and half rounds as Arce struggled to find his range, until midway through the third, he stung the Armenian with a left hook right hand combination. Another left hook near the end of the round triggered an exciting exchange as the crowd voiced their approval. Arce looked to have found his rhythm, having success throughout the fourth. But Darchinyan stiffened his legs with a solid left uppercut, delivering the punch for a second time to knock Arce in to the ropes. The pair took turns over the next few rounds testing each others durability, exchanging heavy blows. But it was becoming apparent that Darchinyan was packing the heavier artillery and that he also had another gear that he was preparing to move in to. Creating distance, he started to break Arce down, a short right hook now combining with the left cross/uppercut that was landing cleanly on Arce’s features. In round eleven, Arce absorbed some hefty punches, in the process suffering a nasty looking cut around the right eye. At the end of the round, the ringside doctor halted the action as the dejected challenger accepted his defeat. Full of class, he plotted his next move.\n\nHe got back to winning ways four months later with a third round knockout of Fernando Lumacad. Darchinyan then opted to move up in weight in a losing challenge for the IBF bantamweight title. But after refusing to meet number one contender Simphiwe Nongqayi, Darchinyan opted to vacate that organisation’s super-flyweight strap. Arce was pitted against Nongqayi to establish it’s successor.\n\nSouth African Nongqayi was unbeaten in sixteen fights, predominately in his own country. But, in a strange turn of events, he had outpointed Arce’s younger brother Francisco in an eliminator for the title. Now he would face the more decorated of the siblings. They met on 9 September 2009. Arce was out of sorts this night, struggling to keep up with Nongqayi. He dropped a unanimous decision and many felt that he had the look of an aged fighter, that the wars that had made him such compelling viewing were now showing their effect. But write off a man like Arce at your own peril, for what looked like the beginning of the end was in fact the beginning of the most successful and rewarding period in his career. It was where his legacy was cemented.\n\nHe admitted that his career may well have been catching him up but, with a shot at the vacant WBO super-flyweight title on the table, he decided to continue a little longer, although if he lost, he would retire. He hired legendary trainer Ignacio “Nacho” Beristàin to take care of him. It proved to be an astute decision. He would face little known Indonesian Angky Angkotta on 30 January 2010 in Mexico City. Arce had his work cut out before a cut eye in round seven took the decision to the scorecards. Arce was declared victor and once again had a world title strapped around his waist.\n\nNonetheless, he opted to relinquish the belt in order to chase bigger opportunities. And he did indeed mean bigger. Rising two divisions, Arce accepted an offer to fight undefeated WBO super-bantamweight champion Wilfredo Vàsquez Jr. Vàsquez father was one of the finest fighters from Puerto Rico, holding world titles in three divisions. Aside from being the third father-son combination in history to both become champion, they were also the first to do it in the same weight class. Even more remarkable was the fact that Vàzquez Jr had never boxed at amateur level. Now here he was making the third defence of his crown against his most experienced and biggest “name” opponent to date. Arce was a 10-1 underdog and was thought to be an easy stepping stone. It would prove to be a serious error of judgement.\n\nOn 7 May 2011 at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas, the fight was the chief support to Manny Pacquiao vs Shane Mosley. It ended up stealing the show. Taking the fight to the younger man, Arce whipped in hooks to the body as he took the battle up close. Vàsquez responded with sharp counters, including a left hook that briefly sent Arce skidding to the canvas at the end of the fourth. The war of attrition continued, each fighter giving as good as they got, with absorbing exchanges throughout. Going in to round eleven it was difficult to separate them both on the judges scorecards. Then midway through the round Arce’s body attack gained fruition as Vàsquez started to wilt. Arce put his foot on the gas, piling the pressure on as he eagerly sought a finish. Vàsquez survived the round but Arce was now like a shark with the scent of blood in his nostrils. He came out for the final round energised by the previous rounds turn of events. Even so, he still displayed his class and sportsmanship as hugged Vàsquez to start the round. His arms went in to perpetual motion as pummelled the exhausted soon-to-be ex-champion on the ropes. With a minute gone it was over, referee Joe Cortez stepping in to rescue a beaten Vàsquez. Arce had upset the odds and was now a three-weight champion.\n\nHis next three fights were against familiar opposition and history was also equalled in one. First up was a defence of his newly won title against former conqueror Nongqayi. Arce looked a different animal on this night, stopping the South African in four. He then chose to relinquish his belt and returned to bantamweight. On 26 November 2011, he once again faced Indonesian hard man Angky Angkotta for the vacant WBO title. Angkotta once again pushed Arce hard, his grit and determination giving Arce some uncomfortable moments, as the pair put on a gruelling battle. It was a close affair, although the scorecards didn’t reflect this, as Arce joined compatriot Eric Morales as a four-weight champion, courtesy of a unanimous decision. It had been a stunning turn of events for Arce, as his achievements now equalled his popularity.\n\nRelinquishing the title without a defence, Arce moved back to super-bantamweight with his eyes firmly set on the division’s leader, pound for pound entrant Nonito Donaire. First he set the record straight against Lorenzo Parra, bettering their previous draw with a fifth round knockout, then followed that with a no-contest with Jesus Rojas and a points win over Mauricio Martinez to earn his opportunity against the formidable Filipino. Donaire, a hugely talented boxer-puncher, was a three-weight world champion with many more years and accomplishments in front of him. He had already captured multiple titles and was arguably at the peak of his powers. The 33 year old Arce would be a decisive underdog.\n\nOn 15 December 2012, the pair met at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. And the odds makers were spot on with their prediction on this night. Donaire was dominant from the start. He had an answer for everything Arce threw at him, countering with crisp, sharp punches throughout the opening three minutes. In the second things got worse for the Mexican veteran when he walked on to a right hand that sent down. He rose quickly but the writing was already on the wall. And in the third it was shown to him. A right hand staggered him again before a quick combination reunited him with the canvas for the second time. He once again clambered up, his legs betraying the steely determination that his resolve desperately wanted to display. Donaire exploded with a crushing left hook, the punch driving Arce flat on his back, bloody and beaten. It was a devastating finish with the referee waving the fight over.\n\nIn a perverse way, that would have been a fitting finale to this blood and guts warrior’s career, a live by the sword, die by the sword mantra. And Arce did indeed announce his retirement after the fight;\n\n“My careers over. I have my family to take care of and my children, and I promised them that if I lost, I would leave”.\n\nBut the fire still burned within him as he sought one more championship. He returned almost a year later, this time up at featherweight, against late notice substitute Colombian Jose Carmona. If ever a fight was to bring home the harsh and brutal realities of the sport, this was the one. Arce showed his experience against his younger foe, wearing him down before scoring an eighth round knockout. But afterwards Carmona was rushed to hospital to reduce swelling on his brain. Deeply affected by what had transpired, Arce visited his former opponent, giving his family $10,000 to help pay his medical bills. To this day he still sends a monthly contribution to help with Carmona’s recovery.\n\nArce returned four months later on 8 March 2014, stopping Aldimar Silva in five, then stopped Jorge Lacierva in eight. These wins sent him in to what would turn out to be the final fight of his career, a challenge to countryman and WBC featherweight champion Jhonny Gonzalez. The heavy handed Gonzalez was in his second reign as champion, having blasted out the previously unbeaten and favoured Abner Mares in the opening round to regain the title. He had also worn the WBO belt down at bantamweight and was making his second defence. For Arce history beckoned as he sought to become a five-division champion.\n\nOn 4 October 2014, they squared off in front of their countrymen. But those who had come to witness one more miracle came to a quick realisation that Arce had another opponent facing him that night, one that could never be beaten; Father Time. Gonzalez dominated from the start, busting up and knocking down the ever determined and courageous Arce three times before the referee rescued him in the eleventh round. After the fight his father pleaded with him;\n\n“Retire. No more fights. You promised one world championship. Now you’re going to kill me because I am afraid for you”.\n\n“Okay”, Arce replied “I promise I won’t fight anymore”.\n\nHe hung up his gloves, his final record: 64 wins, 8 losses, 2 draws, 1 no-contest, 49 by KO.\n\nHappy in retirement, Arce has regularly been a commentator on Mexican boxing channel Televisa and wisely invested his money in to properties. His career achievements saw his name added to the 2021 list of nominations to the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Whilst not getting selected this time, it is only a matter of “when” and not “if”.\n\nWhen looking back on the colourful and, at times, wildly exciting career of Jorge Arce, one explanation from the man himself sums it up more than any;\n\n“When people ask why I don’t surrender, I say “My dad didn’t surrender on his life, so why would I surrender in a fight?”.\n\nAnd it was that approach that helped lluminate the lighter weights of boxing and gain them the recognition they, and he, so thoroughly deserved.\n\nDean Berks\n\nIt was early 1955 and twenty one year old George Benton strolled in to Johnny Madison’s gym for his workout. As he entered, his friend Charlie Scott called out to him, “Hey George. Guess who you got turned down by today?”. “Who?” quizzed Benton. “You won’t believe this” came the reply. “Who?” Benton asked again. “Sugar Ray Robinson”. “You’re crazy” answered Benton. “Honest to God” continued Scott. “George Gainford called Herman Taylor for an opponent”, referring to Robinson’s manager Gainford and Philadelphia promoter Taylor, “And Taylor replied, ‘Yeah I got a guy, George Benton’. But when Taylor heard that he replied, ‘We don’t want him’.” At the time, Robinson had just started a comeback after two years out, and he ended up fighting Tiger Jones instead. And losing.\n\nThe above story from Dave Anderson’s fantastic “Ringmasters” book sums up just how highly regarded Benton was as a fighter. He journeyed from number one middleweight contender to one of history’s finest trainers and is generally associated with, and assumed the originator of, the Philly shell defence. With his left hand low and chin tucked inside his left shoulder, Benton could stand in front of an opponent, slipping and rolling with the oncoming punches before effortlessly firing back with his own counters. He was as smooth as they came and Philadelphian to the core.\n\nBorn in the City of Brotherly Love on 15 May 1933, Benton, one of eleven children, grew up watching Henry Armstrong, the aforementioned Robinson, and Philadelphia’s own lightweight champion Bob Montgomery. Starting boxing when 8 years old, he had his first amateur bout at 13, and learned all about avoiding punches whilst sparring with a fighter named Jimmy Collins. “You couldn’t hit him with a handful of rice”, was how he described being opposite Collins. Then one day, Collins complained to Benton’s trainer Joe Rose that he didn’t want to spar the young Benton anymore as he was getting “too big”. But the reality was that Benton was figuring Collins out and giving him all he could handle.\n\nHe won the 147 Ib title in the Inquirer Diamond belt tournament, finishing his amateur career with a 67-10 record, before turning professional on 18 July 1949, aged just 16, with a first round knockout of one Chico Wade. Benton then won his next six before losing a six round decision to Al Mobley. During this period, as he was held in such high regard in his gym, he would look after the other fighters when Rose had to go out of town to work. They listened and respected the youngster and Rose knew that when he returned, the fighters would be fit and ready for action. The seeds of a great trainer were already being sewn.\n\nBenton reeled off seventeen wins, including a points win over the highly regarded Holly Mims, before losing a majority decision to Joe Blackwood. He continued with seven victories and a draw before he was drafted in to the United States Army in 1956. Whilst in there, he coached the boxing team when he was stationed in Korea. Needless to say, the team won all of their tournaments.\n\nAfter leaving in 1958, he resumed his career, but inconsistency had set in. He won two fights before Willie Dockery took a ten round split decision over him. He then split two ten rounders with former victim, and now ranked contender Charley Joseph, racked up two more wins, but lost back-to-back decisions to Mims and Henry Hank. Two months later Gene Washington was stopped in nine, followed by a ten round decision over future junior middleweight champion Freddie Little. Benton then travelled to Scotland, losing on points to John McCormack. It was after this setback that he decided to retire. The division’s depth added to the fact that many avoided him and he was struggling to get fights, so he decided that a regular job was the way to go. Almost twelve months to the day though, after realising that he could earn more money in the ring than out of it, he returned with a third round stoppage of Chico Corsey.\n\nThe break appeared to have revitalised him as he went on a nine fight winning streak, the highlight being a points win over future middleweight champion and number two ranked contender Joey Giardello. However, in a time when having the right connections meant everything, it was Giardello, who had upset Sugar Ray Robinson on points to become the number one contender, who received a shot at world champion Dick Tiger, taking the title on a fifteen round decision. And Giardello’s manager, Lou Duva, made sure that his man would never face Benton again, especially with the title on the line, a story that Duva would relay to Benton when they ended up working together many years down the line!!\n\nNow ranked number three in the world, Benton’s reputation was growing. He had once sparred former heavyweight champion, and the much feared, Sonny Liston. Reports had Liston swinging for air as the decidedly smaller Benton put on a boxing clinic, and now, after years of frustration and having done enough to earn his shot, he was once again finding himself avoided and denied a chance to become champion. Back in the ring, he moved on with three straight stoppages before being upset on a split decision by rising contender Rubin “Hurricane” Carter. It was a fight that could have gone either way, but for Benton it meant he was back to being deemed to dangerous a fight for the top contenders.\n\nHe had come so close to the top, but now his chance to become middleweight champion had gone. He won four of his next five, before outpointing one Jimmy Ellis over ten. It was a win that got better with time as Ellis not only went unbeaten for the next five years, but he also went up in weight to become WBA heavyweight champion. But his career was unwinding. He won his next fight before losing three on the bounce, being stopped twice. The first was against Cuban great Luis Rodriguez who, after an evenly fought contest, topped Benton on a badly cut left eye in round 9. He was outpointed by Milo Calhoun, before meeting fellow Philadelphian hard man Bennie Briscoe. The now 33 year old was worn down by the pressure of the young and heavy handed Briscoe, being stopped on his stool before the tenth round. He continued against lower grade opposition, winning his next eight, but lost to Juarez de Lima in what would turn out to be his final bout.\n\nOne night in 1970 changed Benton’s life forever. Walking down a street in his hometown, he heard someone call out his name from a doorway. He knew the man as “Chinaman”. Benton walked over and the man said he wanted revenge for an incident that had happened earlier on in the evening. It turned out that this man had tried to pick up Benton’s sister in a bar and his brother had knocked him out. He then vowed to get revenge on any Benton. He had found George. He pulled out a thirty-eight calibre pistol and shot Benton in the back, chipping and lodging in to his spine. Benton grabbed his attacker, headbutting him until he dropped the weapon. The action saved his life, but his in-ring career was over.\n\nHe was in and out of hospital for the next two years. The bullet had pierced his bowel, which in turn had infected his spine. He had to wear a body cast and his weight fell from 165 lbs down to 105 lbs. Laying in the hospital bed one night he claimed to have heard a voice say to him “You were a good fighter and a good hustler, but I’m going to take that all away from you. I want to see if you can come back”. He never forgot the voice as he knew it was challenging him to make something of himself once again. When he got out of the hospital, he had a couple of jobs but then started training fighters. One day former heavyweight champion Joe Frazier approached him about keeping an eye on the fighters in his gym whilst head trainer Eddie Futch was out of town. Benton gladly accepted. When Futch came back, Frazier asked to keep Benton around. He was back in boxing.\n\nAs assistant to Futch he learned more about the mental aspect of being a trainer, learning how to approach different personalities and how to impart advice. And, combined with his own knowledge, the importance of knowing how to break down styles. He worked with former opponent Bennie Briscoe, taking him on a twelve fight unbeaten run, culminating with a shot at middleweight champion Rodrigo Valdes, then he was in the corner alongside Futch for the historical “Thrilla in Manila” rubber match between Frazier and Muhammad Ali, on 1 October 1975.\n\nIn a brutal contest between the now past their best rivals, Frazier was retired on his stool at the end of the fourteenth round with both eyes rapidly closing. Ali himself was close to exhaustion in the opposite corner. While never second guessing Futch’s decision, Benton had admitted that if he had been chief second, he would have told Frazier to jump up and down in the corner, raring to go, as he had observed Ali’s corner and had seen the champion virtually depleted of energy. His feeling was that Ali may well have, at that moment, thrown the towel in. The fact that Ali voiced afterwards that he felt “it was the closet thing to death” he had experienced may have added further weight to that judgment.\n\nThree years later, he would get another crack at the self proclaimed “Greatest” when 1976 Olympic gold medalist Leon Spinks recieved a surprising shot at the title. Spinks was just 6-0-1, with 5 KO’s whilst Ali, now 36 years old, was vastly more experienced at 55-2, with 37 KO’s. Ali had chosen Spinks as he knew a fourth fight with Ken Norton would be ordered by the WBC. He would make a lot of money fighting who he had perceived as a lesser threat in Spinks. Benton had helped train Spinks for his previous fight and his manager Butch Lewis had requested his help once again. He went to work, devising a strategy where Spinks pressed Ali, throwing straight punches, knowing that Ali would pull out of the range of hooks. He knew the strength of Ali’s jaw so told Spinks to just keep busy and not load up on punches. In sparring, Spinks would fire his jab just under his opponents left shoulder, with the effect being felt in the later rounds when Ali would struggle to lift that arm.\n\nOn the night of 15 February 1978, Spinks upset Ali with a fifteen round split decision. But fame and fortune grasped “Neon” Leon as he basked in the glory of becoming heavyweight champion. Benton could barely get near him, as family, friends, ex-marine buddies, and hangers-on all took up his time. He signed for a rematch with Ali and was promptly stripped of the WBC title for refusing to face Norton. Training for this fight was a calamity. Benton had advised the same strategy as before, but this was an unprepared Spinks and a fully focused Ali.\n\nOn fight night, 15 September 1978, the corner was pure chaos. Firstly, no one had thought to bring his protective cup, water bottle or bucket, all of which had to be borrowed off of Mike Rossman, who had won the WBA light-heavyweight title on the undercard. Then Benton was told that Sam Solomon, Spinks head trainer, his brother Michael and himself, would take turns talking to Leon between each round. Benton had to wait until round five to speak after even his marine friends had got in on the act!! Spinks had hardly done a thing up to that moment. Benton got in his ear and Spinks had his best round. But when Benton went to climb the steps at the end of the round, someone else went up. Benton had had enough, storming back to the changing room and grabbing his coat, before promptly leaving the arena. Needless to say, Spinks lost the title on a unanimous decision.\n\nBut success was to come when in a strange twist of fate, Lou Duva, now manager with his son Dan at Main Events Promotions, sought out Benton to train the fighters at their stable. He worked with world champions Johnny Bumphus, Rocky Lockridge and Leo Randolph. Then in 1984, things jumped up a notch when Main Events signed Olympic gold medalists Pernell Whitaker, Meldrick Taylor and Tyrell Biggs, plus bronze medal winner Evander Holyfield. It was an extraordinary array of talent.\n\nIn Whitaker, Benton found a kindred spirit in their respective styles. Settling Whitaker down, he educated him in the art of defending and countering whilst staying in the pocket, skills that were mastered and executed to perfection. Whitaker went on to win titles in four divisions and is generally regarded as one of the top five lightweight champions in history. In a later interview, Whitaker heaped praise on his former trainer. “It was always a teachable moment with George” he reflected, “There was always something in the ring that he was able to talk to me about. He gave me everything from the old school that worked for me and it worked. Whether it was aiming for the chest or aiming for the shoulders, just the way he would have fought in the 50’s and the 60’s, and I fell in love with that style of boxing. And I was able to put that out there along with the skills and speed that I already had. It was a gift given to me and a gift that nobody else had”.\n\nTaylor represented the Philly fighter in Benton’s heart. Blessed with blurring speed and toughness, Taylor considered himself a fighter first and a boxer second, electing, at times, to war in the trenches as opposed to employing his natural gifts. He went on to win world titles in two divisions, but his legacy was cemented in his unification with fellow unbeaten champion Julio Cesar Chavez. Taylor put on a dazzling display, outboxing the Mexican for long periods, but shipping a lot of punishment along the way. He was eventually dropped and stopped with just two seconds left in the fight, whilst ahead on two of the scorecards. Before the last round, Benton, unsure of how the fight was being scored, instructed Taylor to outfight Chavez instead of boxing and moving. Taylor felt in the aftermath that the advice had contributed to him losing. He was never quite the same fighter again and he had lost some of the faith in Benton and Duva. After losing his WBA welterweight title to Crisanto Espana, they parted ways.\n\nWith Biggs it was a very different story. He never really quite adapted to the professional ranks, struggling it times with fringe contenders, as well as a substance abuse problem. He was put in with then heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, prematurely for many, for his one and only title shot. Biggs took a beating, as Tyson handed him a seventh round stoppage loss.\n\nBut it was with Holyfield that Benton had his biggest success. From cruiserweight champion to four-time heavyweight champion, Holyfield’s grounding started with Benton. But when he first turned pro, he suffered with terrible stamina problems, blowing out after just three rounds. Benton knew it was more of a psychological barrier than a physical deficit and worked on “convincing” Holyfield that he was okay. When Holyfield was on the bags or sparring, Benton, with stopwatch in hand, would con him by telling him he had done three minutes of work when, in fact, he had just completed two minutes. So when the time was increased back to three, Holyfield believed he had done four. And he went from strength to strength.\n\nBenton spent hours analysing styles and formulating strategies for his fighters, drilling the lessons in to them that they must learn to adapt to and conquer all styles of boxing. When Holyfield was to face James “Buster” Douglas for the heavyweight title, he observed that Douglas double jabbed before throwing a right uppercut from distance. He had Holyfield repeatedly rocking back on his right leg in training before countering the uppercut with a straight right. The constant repetition was instinctively rewarded when the same move knocked out Douglas in the third round and handed Holyfield the title. Benton had his first “true” heavyweight champion. He had also taken stock of the fact that boxer’s who over-rely on their jab had a tendency to use it less when jabbed back, a tactic that had also seen Holyfield outbox Douglas over the first two rounds.\n\nHolyfield made three defences before running in to Olympic silver medalist Riddick Bowe. Bowe was trained by Benton’s former mentor Futch who had done a remarkable job of transforming him from a fighter with a lackadaisical attitude to serious heavyweight contender. Holyfield had sparred Bowe previously and, despite giving away all physical advantages, Benton believed that the champion had the skills and speed to outbox his younger rival. And the first round appeared to confirm this, with Holyfield following the gameplan that had been mapped out. But pride can be a dangerous thing, and when Holyfield was tagged with a big right in round two, the strategy went out of the window. From that point, Holyfield set out to prove he could outpunch the much bigger Bowe. It proved his undoing and cost him the title as he lost a unanimous decision. Briefly retiring, by the time Holyfield returned, it was with a new team, and Emanuel Steward had taken over from Benton.\n\nBut behind the scenes, things were unravelling. Benton’s relationship with Duva had become strained. While the main issue was never disclosed, it was believed that Benton had become tired of Duva’s theatrics and was left feeling unheralded in their partnership. So in 1994, he walked away from Main Events, bringing an end to a highly successful era that also included stints training Mike McCallum and Michael Moorer.\n\nBenton continued working, and was in the corner for one of the most bizarre moments in boxing history when Oliver McCall met Lennox Lewis on 7 February 1997 in a rematch for the vacant WBC heavyweight title. Lewis dominated the first three rounds as McCall barely mustered up any interest in fighting, hardly throwing any punches. At the end of the third McCall wandered around the ring, refusing to sit down. Benton could only look on, bewildered by what was unfolding in front of him. But things were to get stranger. After another listless round, McCall started sobbing in the ring. Referee Mills Lane asked him if he wanted to continue and McCall nodded. But after only a brief period of the fifth, and McCall once again showing no inclination of wanting to box, Lane stopped the fight. McCall instantly climbed out of the ring. It was the first time a fighter appeared to have a mental breakdown in the ring. Afterwards, Benton commented in the media that he had been aware of McCall’s troubled past but had thought he was now clean. He warned others of the dangers of drugs, using McCall as a perfect example.\n\nFrom here Benton would seldom be seen in the corner. Throughout his life, he rarely mixed with “boxing people”, preferring his own company. As he put it himself, “Nobody gets close, no man, and especially no woman”. He had enjoyed the parties and nightlife in his heyday, and had fathered eleven children, nine out of wedlock. He called himself “the luckiest guy in the world” for what boxing had given him. When asked if there was any fighter he would have liked the opportunity to have trained, he always said ‘Sugar’ Ray Leonard, not to discredit Angelo Dundee or Janks Morton, but he felt that he could have got a little bit more out him. After having seen what he had achieved, there is every reason to believe that he could have too.\n\nIn both 1989 and 1990, he was recognised by the Boxing Writers Association of America as ‘Trainer of the Year’, being awarded the ‘Futch-Condon Award’. In 2001, he was inducted in to the International Boxing Hall of Fame for his achievements.\n\nOn 19 September 2011, Benton sadly passed away after battling pneumonia. He was 78.\n\nWhen boxing’s greatest trainers are discussed, George Benton will always be one of the names mentioned. Widely recognised and appreciated for his defensive wizardry, his knowledge and experience would always benefit fighters of all ages and experience. The list of fighters who benefitted from his expertise is an impressive one. He was one of the finest teachers in boxing, part of a bygone era that, especially in the modern boxing world, feels further and further away. As he liked to say, “Styles. It’s all about styles”. It would be wise to listen to the man who became known to his students as ‘The Professor’.\n\nDean Berks"
