        "text": "Biomedical Sciences – Biomechanics\n\n6557 - Ipsilesional upper limb reaching movements in poststroke patients: A quantitative biomechanical assessment\n\nFranco Molteni1, Giulio Gasperini1, Alessandro Scano2, Eleonora Guanziroli1\n\n1Villa Beretta Rehabilitation Center, Ospedale Valduce, Costa Masnaga, Italy, 2UOS STIIMA Lecco - Human-Centered, Smart and Safe, Living Environment, Italian National Research Council, Italy\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: In post-stroke hemiplegic patients, the ipsilesional limb has been less investigated than the contralesional. However, a better understanding of the motor capability of the ipsilesional limb may shed light on mechanisms of motor impairment and motor recovery. Methods: 38 hemiplegic patients were divided in three cohorts depending on their motor impairment (severe, moderate, mild), and assessed with a kinematic and dynamic evaluation protocol on their ipsilesional upper limb during reaching movements. Measurements were repeated in the acute and subacute phases. Ten healthy age-matched control subjects were recruited and their motor capabilities were evaluated. Healthy and patients were compared to determine whether patients' ipsilesional limb has equal performance to healthy people's limb. Results: With our assessment, we determined that the ipsilesional limb presented significantly different kinematic and dynamic performance. For the ipsilesional limb, we found: limited range of motion of shoulder elevation angles and lower energy and power outputs for both elbow and shoulder joints. Patients showed higher motor deficits in the acute phase with respect to the subacute one and the “severe” group presented highly significant differences with respect to healthy controls. Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that patients' ipsilesional limb is different from healthies', as previously reported from the literature and adding further significant assessments based on movement dynamics. These results have relevant clinical implications while treating and evaluating post-stroke subjects.\n\n6506 - Quality of life predictors in patients with melanoma: A machine learning approach\n\nMonica Pinto1, Nicola Marotta2, Corrado Caracò3, Ester Simeone3, Antonio Ammendolia2, Alessandro de Sire2\n\n1Istituto Nazionale Tumori - IRCCS - Fondazione G. Pascale, Rehabilitation Medicine Unit, Department of Strategic Health Services, via Mariano Semmola 53, Naples, Italy, 2University of Catanzaro “Magna Graecia”, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Unit, Catanzaro, Italy, 3Istituto Nazionale Tumori - IRCCS - Fondazione G. Pascale, Department of Melanoma, Naples, Italy, 4University of Catanzaro “Magna Graecia”, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Unit, Catanzaro, Italy.\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important recognized health outcome in cancer patients. We aimed to explore and weight factors via a machine learning approach in the perception of the quality of life in patients with melanoma. Methods: In this observational study, patients with melanoma, with no ongoing regional or metastatic disease, were recruited from January 2020 to December 2021 with a follow-up of at least one year. Demographic variables and clinics were collected, and 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) was adopted to assess HRQoL. All the variables were processed in a random forest model to weigh at each node of each tree of this machine learning regression model, their actual weight in SF-12 score. Results: A total of 203 melanoma patients (mean age of 59.25±15.1 years, 136 [67%] Females and 67 [33%] males) were included: 56 (27%) affecting the upper limbs and 147 (73%) affecting the trunk. The model of 142 patients with no missing value, generating 92 trees (MSE = 0.45, R2 of 0.78), reported that the lesion site was the most influencing variable on HRQoL. In this scenario, we built two distinct models for lesion sites and demonstrated that the variable that most influenced the quality of life in upper limb melanoma was lymphedema, while BMI was in the trunk. Conclusions: The machine learning model for detecting the HRQoL predictor in melanoma patients indicates that the experienced lymphedema and BMI may influence the HRQoL perception.\n\n6503 - Comparing the association of a secondary motor and cognitive dual-task with disease severity in Parkinson's disease?\n\nKaren Welman1, Chantelise Watkins2, Megon Sam2\n\n1Stellenbosch University, South Africa, 2Department of Sport Science, Stellenbosch University\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Turning tasks are associated with higher fall risk in individuals with Parkinson's disease (IwPD) and exacerbated under dual-tasking. We endeavoured to determine if there is a relationship between cognitive-motor (CM) and motor-motor (MM) dual-task (DT) turns and disease severity, specifically motor functioning, in IwPD. Methods: 17 IwPD (Hoehn & Yahr I-III; MDS-UPDRS: 62.2 ± 21.0 AU; Women: 6 & Men: 11; age: 73.2 ± 4.7 years) with no severe cognitive impairment (MoCA: 24.9 ± 2.3 AU), randomly completed MM- and CMDT 360° turns. Disease severity was assessed via MDS-UPDRS focusing on Motor Experiences of Daily Living (UPDRS II) and Motor Examination (UPDRS III). Participants executed 360° turns under single-task conditions, while carrying a tray with waterfilled glasses (MMDT) and a serial 3 subtraction task (CMDT). Besides No. of errors, mean Turn angle, duration, velocity and No. of turns were collected with APDM Mobility Lab®. Results: In CMDT, No. of errors showed weak associations throughout (r≤-0.34; R2≤11%) while moderate correlations were found for Turn angle (r=-0.54; R2=29%), No. of turns (r=-0.40; R2=16%) and Turn velocity (r=-0.40; R2=16%) with Total MDS-UPDRS, along with Turn angle (r=-0.52; R2=27%) and Turn velocity (r=-0.45; R2=20%) with UPDRS II (p<0.05). With MMDT moderate correlations were found for Turn angle (r=-0.42 to -0.46; R2=17-22%), No. of turns (r=-0.49 to -0.58; R2=24-34%) and Turn velocity (r=-0.40 to -0.53; R2=16-28%) for Total MDS-UPDRS and UPDRS II (p<0.05). Whereas CMDT and MMDT correlated poorly to negligible with UPDRS III throughout (r ≤-0.17; R2≤3%). Conclusion: DT turning activities imitate the complex demands of daily activities as it relates to disease severity and activities of daily living somewhat more than to motor functioning in IwPD.\n\n6376 - Physical and rehabilitation medicine impact in COVID-19 patients: Functional evolution analysis in continuum care\n\nBruno Guimarães1, Catarina Aguiar-Branco1, Ana Cristina Carvalho1, José Barreto1, Jorge Moreira1, Pedro Cubelo1, Joana Silva1, Bruno Guimarães1\n\n1PRM Department, Centro Hospitalar Entre o Douro e Vouga (CHEDV), Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal.\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: In 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic, with relevant impact on healthcare and rehabilitation worldwide, reflected by an exponential increase in hospital inpatients. The present study explores functional effects of an early rehabilitation program (RP) in COVID-19 patients in UCI's, other hospital services and till 12 weeks after hospital discharge. Methods: Randomized, controlled, double-arm clinical trial-analysis. Patients were randomized into two groups: intervention group (IG), control group (CG). IG was submitted to an individual functional (respiratory, neuromotor) RP and CG to an immobility syndrome prevention RP. After discharge, IG had a supervised and orientated hospital tele-RP. CG was in community. Several metric instruments were applied. Results: 96 patients were considered, in a 1:1 ratio (48 CG and 48 GI). At admission, there were no differences in patients' functional level. IG showed shorter hospital stay (GI vs CG: 12.9±5.8 vs 15.6±6.7, p=0.037). At discharge, IG showed better functional status (FS) (GI vs CG; MRC-SS: 54.4±3.7 vs 52.1±4.1, p=0.005; Hang Grip (HG): 23.3±5.1 vs 21.2±4.3, p=0.032; mMRC Χ2(4) = 11.77, p=0.02). After 4 weeks discharge (wd) differences were found in FS (GI vs CG; MRC-SS: 58.9±1.1 vs 57.9±2.3, p=0.008; 6 minutes walking test (6MWT): 604±67 vs 571±57, p=0.018; Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale (BRPE) (after 6MWT): 11.7±2.1 vs 12.5±1.8, p=0, 048), with no differences in the HG (GI vs CG: HG: 27.1±4.4 vs 25,9±5.1, p=0.220) and dyspnea perception (mMRC Χ2(2) = 1,667, p=0.43). After 12 wd, differences were found in FS (GI vs CG; 6MWT: 639±53 vs 611±53, p=0.025; BRPE (after 6MWT):11.3±1.6 vs 11.9±1.6, p=0,025); no relevant differences in HG and MRC-SS. Conclusion: This study reflects the importance of an early RP in COVID-19 patient's functional recovery.\n\n6230 - Effects of cognitive impairment on dysphagia in stroke patients undergoing specific rehabilitation\n\nBenedetta Basagni1, Sara Marignani1, Francesca Cecchi1, Silvia Pancani1, Andrea Mannini1, Bahia Hakiki1, Claudio Macchi1, Antonello Grippo1\n\n1Centro Maria ai Servi, Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, Parma, Italy\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Dysphagia represents one of the most frequent symptoms in people suffering from stroke in the acute phase, leading to serious complications. Considering the heterogeneity of neurological disease consequent to stroke, swallowing impairment often has various comorbidities, including cognitive deficits. Few studies have addressed the effects of cognitive functions on the evolution of dysphagia. This study aims to investigate the role of cognitive impairment in patients attending a specific rehabilitation program. Methods: Patients admitted to four rehabilitation centres for stroke, entered a dysphagia rehabilitation program performed by one qualified speech and language pathologist. At admission the Montreal Cognitive Screening Test (MoCA) was administered. The change in the FOIS score from admission to discharge was considered as the outcome measure of the study. Results: 61 patients were included in the study. Higher FOIS at admission (β =0.222, p=0.027), younger age (β=-0.346, p=0.002), presence of hemorrhagic stroke (β=0.295, p=0.008), and higher MOCA score (β=0.512, p<0.001), were found to be significantly associated to a higher functional level of food and liquid intake at discharge. Conclusion: Our results seem to confirm the hypothesis that the outcome is influenced by the incoming dysphagia severity. Moreover, patients with a better cognitive profile upon admission had a higher FOIS at discharge than those with a lower one. Both age and type of stroke seemed to be related to the rehabilitation outcome, too. Clinical implications of our results consist in the importance to integrate a cognitive assessment to the dysphagia evaluation and to consider cognitive rehabilitation as a part of dysphagia recuperation.\n\n6174 - Consistency in three-dimensional gait measure interpretations between analyses performed with personal and standard footwear\n\nMargaux Baron1, Baptiste Ulrich2, Brigitte Jolles-Haeberli2, Patrick Omoumi3, Julien Favre2\n\n1Swiss BioMotion Lab, Lausanne University Hospital/University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Swittzerland, 2Department of Swiss BioMotion Lab, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland, 3Service of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: During three-dimensional gait analysis, patients are usually analysed either in personal or standard footwear. Selecting the footwear condition is not straightfoward, particularly because the impact of footwear on the interpretation of gait measures is unclear. This study aimed to characterise the consistency of gait measures between personal and standard footwear, and determine the influence of age or sex. Methods: The gait of 148 healthy participants walking at a comfortable speed was recorded by a single investigator, in a laboratory equipped with a marker-based motion capture system and force plates. Both footwear conditions were recorded on the same day in a random order. Seventy-five common measures were used to describe lower-limb kinetics and kinematics. Consistency was assessed using the intra-class correlation (ICC). Sensitivity analyses were performed with respect to age and sex. Results: Good to excellent consistency (ICC>0.75) was found for 81% of the measures and moderate consistency (ICC>0.5) for 18% of the measures. Lower ICCs were generally found at the ankle and in the transverse plane of the knee. Age or sex did not affect the results. Conclusion: Personal and standard footwear generally yield consistent interpretations of lower limb gait measures, indicating that in most cases, the analyses could be performed with one or the other footwear condition. Inconsistencies were nonetheless observed for some measures, for which precaution must be taken when concluding an absence of effect from footwear. Further research should determine if consistency varies with pathological gait.\n\n5838 - Development of quantification methods of spontaneous movements associated with early neurological development in preterm infants\n\nWoo Hyung Lee1, Hyung-Ik Shin1, Moon Suk Bang1, Sung Eun Hyun1, Hye Min Ji1, Hyun Iee Shin2\n\n1Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea, 2Chung-Ang University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: To develop quantitative assessments of spontaneous movements in high-risk preterm infants based on a deep learning algorithm. Methods: Video images of spontaneous movements were recorded in very preterm infants at the term-equivalent age. The Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) was performed in infants at 4 months of corrected age. Joint positional data were extracted using a pretrained pose-estimation model. Similarity and complexity indices of joint angle and angular velocity were compared between the infants with HINE<60 and ≥60. Results: Video images of spontaneous movements were recorded in 65 preterm infants at term-equivalent age. Complexity indices of joint angles and angular velocities differed between the infants with HINE<60 and ≥60 and correlated positively with HINE scores in most of the joints at the upper and lower extremities (p<0.05). Similarity indices between each joint angle or joint angular velocity did not differ between the two groups in most of the joints at the upper and lower extremities. Conclusion: Quantitative assessments of spontaneous movements in preterm infants are feasible using a deep learning algorithm. The results indicated that complexity indices of joint movements at both the upper and lower extremities can be a potential candidate in detecting cerebral palsy in preterm infants.\n\n5516 - Rehabilitation in patients with lymphoma\n\nBhasker Amatya1, Fary Khan2, Michael Dickinson3, Thomas E Lew3\n\n1Department of Rehabilitation, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia, 2Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia, 3Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Victoria, Australia\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Lymphomas and its treatments are associated with physical, cognitive, psychosocial impairments; limiting patients' daily activities and participation. Currently, a range of rehabilitation interventions are trialled in patients with lymphoma (PwL). This review evaluated existing evidence from published systematic reviews for the effectiveness and safety of rehabilitation interventions in PwL. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was undertaken using a multipronged. Two reviewers independently selected and assessed potential systematic reviews for methodological quality and graded the quality of evidence using validated tool. Results: Twelve systematic reviews (with 101 primary studies; 87,132 PwL) were included, which evaluated three broad categories of rehabilitation interventions: physical modalities, nutrition and complementary medicine. There was a marked heterogeneity amongst the included reviews. Most reviews were just as of moderate to low methodological quality. The findings suggest moderate-quality evidence for exercise programs for improved fatigue and sleep disturbance and low-quality evidence for exercise therapy alone and Qigong/Tai chi for improved symptoms and overall quality of life, and an inverse association between sunlight/ultraviolet radiation exposure on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma incidence. There was inconclusive evidence for the beneficial effects of yoga and the association of physical activity and lymphoma risk. Conclusion: Rehabilitation programs are an integral part of the management of PwL. Despite a range of rehabilitative modalities used for PwL, high-quality evidence for many is sparse. More research with a robust study design is required to determine the effective rehabilitation approaches.\n\n4360 - Evaluation of the efficacy of intra-articular injective treatment with reticular hyaluronic acid (mo.re. Technology) in amateur athletes with over-use gonarthrosis\n\nFrancesco Agostini1, Andrea Bernetti1, Massimiliano Mangone1, Marco Paoloni1, Teresa Paolucci2, Raoul Saggini2, Valter Santilli1\n\n1Department of Anatomical and Histological Sciences, Legal Medicine and Orthopaedics, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy, 2Unit of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, G. D'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic inflammatory and progressive disease characterized by cartilage degeneration, pain, functional disability and quality of life alterations. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) has proved to be able to improve symptoms and slowing down the progression of joint degeneration. The aim of our study was therefore to analyze the efficacy of the intra-articular mobile reticulum HA, 24 mg / 3 ml, in amateur athletes with low to moderate over-use gonarthrosis. Methods: Amateur athletes (30-70 yy) of both sexes with radiographic diagnosis of gonarthrosis (II-III K-L) were recruited. Patients underwent 2 knee intra-articular injections with HYADD®4-G, 2 weeks apart. Patients were evaluated using pain scales (VAS) and disability related to gonarthrosis (KOOS; WOMAC), at baseline, after 1 month, 3 months and 6 months since the last injection. Results: 30 amateur athletes were recruited. VAS Scale showed a statistically significant reduction in pain between T1 and T2 and between T2 and T3 (p-value <0.007). KOOS Scale, for the pain item, there were statistically significant differences between T0 and T1, between T1 and T2 and between T2 and T3 (p-value <0.001). With regard to items related to symptomatology, sports and recreational activities and quality of life, there was a statistically significant improvement between T0 and T2 (p-value: <0.047; <0.034; <0.04 respectively). Conclusion: Based on our experience, intra-articular HA injections, thanks to the innovation of the mobile reticulum, is certainly an effective and safe method in athlete management with low-moderate over-use gonarthrosis.\n\nBiomedical Sciences – Genetics (0)\n\nBiomedical Sciences – Molecular and Cellular Biology\n\n5664 - No blood dysimmune profiles in postpoliomyelitis patients: A case-control study\n\nIsabelle Laffont1, Thierry Vincent2, Christophe Hirtz3, Pierre Portales2, Fanny Pradalier4, William Camu5, Claire Palayer6, Marion Soler7, Florence Galtier8, Valérie Driss8, Nathalie Michel2, Claire Lozano2, Claire Duflos9, Raul Juntas Morales5\n\n1Department of PRM, Montpellier University Hospital, Euromov Digital Health in Motion, Montpellier University, Montpellier, France, 2Department of Immunology, Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier University, Montpellier, France, 3Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Montpellier Hospital, Montpellier University, France, 4Department of PRM, Nimes University Hospital, Montpellier University, Nimes, France, 5Department of Neurology, Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier University, Montpellier, France, 6Department of PRM, Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier University, Montpellier, France, 7Clinical Research and Epidemiology Unit, Montpellier University, Montpellier, France, 8Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier University, Montpellier, France, 9Clinical Research and Epidemiology Unit, CHU Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Poliomyelitis is a global disabling disease (12-20 millions of people). Post poliomyelitis syndrome (PPS) may affect up to 80% of polio survivors (1): increased muscle weakness, pain, fatigue, functional decline. It relies on aging of an impaired neuro-muscular system with ongoing denervation processes. A late involvement of humoral or cellular pro-inflammatory phenomenons is also suspected (2). Methods: This monocentric study compared PPS patients and controls on their lymphocyte subpopulations and humoral immune factors (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, RANTES, MCP1, CCL20, IL-10, TGF-β). Patients were further compared according to their dominant clinical symptoms. Sample size guaranteed a power >90% for all comparisons. Results: We recruited 74 participants: 47 patients, 27 controls. The two groups were comparable in gender, age and weight. Most patients had lower limb motor sequelae (45, 95.7%), a minority had upper limb motor impairment (16, 34.0%). Forty-five were able to walk (94%), 35/45 with technical aids. The mean of the two-minutes walking test was 97.16 (± 45.86) metres. Eighteen (38%) required help in their daily life. Their quality of life was low (SF36). All described an increase in muscular weakness, 40 (85%) a general fatigue, and 39 (83%) muscular or joint pain. Blood count and serum electrolytes were comparable between patients and controls, except for creatine phosphokinase that was significantly higher in PPS patients. T and B lymphocyte subpopulation analysis and cytokine dosages were also similar between the two groups. None of these variables differed between the 20/47 patients whose late main symptoms were pain or fatigue, and other patients. Conclusion: Our results do not sustain the dysimmune hypothesis of PPS.\n\nBiomedical Sciences – Neurosciences\n\n6844 - Spatial neglect encompasses impaired verticality representation after right hemisphere stroke\n\nRémi Lafitte1, Marie Jeager2, Céline Piscicelli2, Shenhao Dai2, Anne Chrispin2, Patrice Davoine2, Eve Dupierrix2, Dominic Pérennou2\n\n1Department of NeuroRehabilitation South Hospital, Univ. Grenoble Alpes, UMR CNRS 5105 Neuropsychology and NeuroCognition, CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France, 2Department of NeuroRehabilitation South Hospital, CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackgrounds and Aim: There is mounting evidence that, after stroke, impaired internal model of verticality is strongly related to spatial neglect. It raises questions as to which modalities of spatial neglect and verticality perception are related to each other? We assume that this link stems from a strong relationship between body neglect (BN) and postural vertical (PV), both referring to the body. Our aim was to analyse relationships between BN, non-body neglect (NBN), PV, and visual vertical (VV), in a series of individuals with right hemisphere stroke (RHS). Methods: We investigated a series 77 of individuals with RHS, with complete assessments of BN and NBN (four tests each), VV and PV, performed at the same time between one and three months post-stroke. Abnormality was diagnosed from at least two pathological tests both for spatial neglect and verticality perception. Composite scores were computed for BN and NBN. Results: All individuals (Median age = 67) with verticality representation impairment (n = 26) had spatial neglect (n = 52), but the reverse was not true. Whatever the modality, spatial neglect and verticality biases were moderately correlated (r ranging from -0.64 to -0.41; all p <.001). A principal component analysis revealed that data variance was mainly explained by one component, comprising all factors with the following loadings: BN = 0.88, NBN = 0.84, PV = -0.80, VV = -0.73. Conclusion: Our results reveal that spatial neglect encompasses impaired transmodal verticality perception, suggesting that biased verticality representation is a form of graviceptive neglect. BN, NBN, PV, and VV belong to the same dimension. The attentional component of spatial neglect likely explains their moderate correlations.\n\n6550 - The reorganization of egocentric spatial representation in patients who had a right hemispheric stroke, an FMRI study\n\nStephanie Leplaideur1, Isabelle Bonan1, Elise Bannier2\n\n1University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France, 2Univ Rennes, CNRS, Inria, Inserm, IRISA UMR 6074, EMPENN ERL U 1228, Rennes, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: The egocentric referential frame is used in activities of daily living, and its impairment after stroke is detrimental. This study aimed to investigate, using neuroimaging, how patients with a right stroke perform egocentric tasks. Methods: Fourteen patients who had a right stroke within nine months underwent a functional 3T MRI scan. They achieved the subjective straight ahead (SSA) exploring the extracorporeal space and the subjective longitudinal body plane task (SLB) involving the corporeal space. Results: Brain activations were too heterogeneous to find significant results at the group level. At the individual level, we observed three kinds of activation patterns in decreasing rank: 1) bilateral activations; 2) only contralesional activations; 3) predominantly ipsilesional activations. During SSA, we located activations in the right inferior frontal gyrus, posterior cerebellum, middle temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus and posterior parietal cortex; and left cuneus and superior parietal lobule. During SLB, patients activated the right posterior cerebellum, middle temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus, angular and middle occipital gyrus. Left activations were found in the middle occipital gyrus, cuneus, middle temporal gyrus, precentral and superior frontal gyrus. Conclusion: Neuroimaging suggests different activation patterns in right stroke patients during egocentric tasks related to their lesion's characteristics. Studies of the networks underlying these egocentric activations could upgrade knowledge about the potential reorganization in high-level integration brain areas during spatial cognition tasks. Furthermore, identifying reorganization profiles could allow adapting their rehabilitation program.\n\n6372 - Comparison of EEG biomarkers in mirror therapy and video therapy in normals and hemiplegic stroke patients\n\nAhmed Adham1, Faustine Monin2, Diana Rimaud2, Pascal Giraux3\n\n1Department of Adult PRM, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, France Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Trajectoires Team, Bron, France, 2Department of Adult PRM, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, France, 3France and Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Priest-En-Jarez, France\n\nE-mail:[email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Mirror Therapy (MT) and Video Therapy (VT) are two rehabilitation techniques used in post-stroke hemiplegia for motor training of the upper-limb. The neurophysiological mechanisms behind their clinical efficacy have to be further characterized. The aim of this study is to identify and compare EEG markers in MT and VT rehabilitation in post-stroke hemiplegic patients, compared to healthy subjects. The influence of the motor task performed by the impaired limb is also assessed. Methods: EEG data (32 channels) from 10 chronic stroke patients and 15 healthy subjects were collected during standardized finger movements in MT (mirror) and VT (IVS™, Dessintey) during 2 randomized experimental sessions, with three distinct motor tasks conditions: passive observation, motor imagery and motor execution. Time-frequency maps were analyzed, including Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) and β-rebound. Results: In healthy subjects, a sensorimotor ERD is shown to be comparable in MT and VT, with a contralateral predominance of the ERD in VT compared to MT (bilateral ERD). In addition, there is a modulation of ERD and β-rebound according to motor tasks (observation, imagery, and execution). In patients, a still partial analysis, shows similar results, with however a variability according to the topography of the lesions and the level of motor recovery of the patients. Conclusion: The comparison of EEG markers obtained in MT and VT in healthy subjects and hemiplegic patients shows the greater ipsilesional selectivity of VT, especially regarding β-rebound. The modulation of ERD and β-rebound according to the motor task performed are potential markers of subject engagement in the clinical practice of these therapies.\n\n5949 - Validation of a virtual reality system to test simple reaction time\n\nYing-Chun Chen, Huey-Wen Liang\n\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Taiwan University Hospital and College Medicine, Taipei City, Taiwan, ROC\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Reaction time (RT) is known to be related to cognitive function, and has been a valuable research parameter for variable studies, for example, in visuospatial attention. Head-mounted display for virtual reality (HMD-VR) provides standardize the external visual conditions and could be a promising tool for measuring RT. The purpose of this study is to establish the feasibility, reality and validity of a HMD-VR-based software in evaluating simple RT (SRT). Methods: Twenty-one young and healthy participants volunteered the study after signing informed consents. A SRT test was created by VIVE ProEye (HTC, Inc.). The participants responded with a keyboard when a square target in random intervals for 100 trials. They performed a re-test within 1 week to investigate the reliability and a similar task with a computer-based software, RehaCom (HASOMED, Inc.) to test the concurrent validity. Median SRT was obtained was tested among each 25-trial block to test potential fatigue effect. Results: The median SRT for the first test from the VR-based and computer-based systems was 322 and 310 ms respectively, with Pearson's correlation coefficient as 0.88 (p<0.001) and significantly higher RT for left hand with the VR-based system (p=0.025 by Wilconxon signed Ranks test). The test-retest reliability of VR-based system was good, computed with intraclass correlation coefficient as 0.78 (p<0.001). Longer RT was observed at the last 25-trial block for the left hand only as computed Friedman's test with Bonferroni's correction. Conclusion: Our results supported a good reliability and high concurrent validity of this HMD-VR-based RT testing. Higher RT was observed for VR-based system for left hand only. Fatigue effect was observed for left hand for a 100-trial tests.\n\n5816 - Evaluating the trajectory of recovery of prolonged postconcussion symptoms with rehabilitation therapy\n\nJohn Olver, Bianca Fedele, Rose Acher\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation, Epworth HealthCare, Monash University, Richmond, Victoria, Australia\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Following concussion, approximately 15% of patients experience various neurological, physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms that persist beyond three months. This is known as Prolonged Post-Concussion Symptoms (PPCS). This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and severity of symptoms on presentation, their impact on lifestyle and their recovery with rehabilitation intervention for patients admitted to Epworth HealthCare's Rehabilitation Concussion Clinic. Methods: Symptoms are assessed on clinic admission and discharge using the Oregon Post Concussion Symptom Checklist. Patients rate the presence and severity (0 – none to 6 – severe) of 23 symptoms which are clustered into physical, thinking, sleep and emotion subscale scores. Symptom presentation on admission then directs an individually tailored multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. Results: The analytic sample consisted of 222 patients with complete data. The top five symptoms reported on admission were: difficulty concentrating, headache, fatigue, feeling mentally foggy and feeling slowed down. The mean time in rehabilitation treatment was 279 days. By clinic discharge, there was a statistically significant decrease in all subscale scores and an increase in daily activity levels (from 42.7% to 76.0%). Compared to patients referred early to the clinic (≤3 months), patients with a delayed referral (>3 months) demonstrated significantly increased subscale scores and decreased daily activity levels (67.6% vs. 80.6%) on discharge. Conclusion: For individuals with PPCS, meaningful gains can be made through rehabilitation targeted at alleviating symptoms. Referral time for treatment can have a significant impact on the degree of recovery, and so a focus should be on the early detection of PPCS.\n\n5681 - Cortical activation of unilateral upper limb tasks: Perspectives for stroke rehabilitation\n\nCamille Muller1, Karima Bakhti2, Makii Muthalib2, Denis Mottet1, Marion Delorme3, Jérôme Froger3, Stéphane Perrey1, Isabelle Laffont2\n\n1EuroMov Digital Health in Motion, Univ Montpellier, IMT Mines Ales, Montpellier, France, 2Department of Physical Rehabilitation and Medicine, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France, 3 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, CHU Nîmes, Le Grau du Roi, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Post-stroke brain activations and their evolution through rehabilitation is a subject of major interest. Two non-invasive neuroimaging methods allow for recording the task-related brain activation for bedside use or in field monitoring: functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (fEEG) respectively based on haemodynamic response and electrical activity of brain regions. Coupling both methods could lead to a better spatiotemporal mapping of the movement-related cortical activity to unveil underlying mechanisms of upper limb (UL) recovery. This fNIRS-fEEG study aims to depict reference activation patterns of motor cortex related to motor performance during UL functional tasks. Methods: Young healthy participants realized two unilateral UL tasks: i) a reaching target task and ii) a circular tracing task with speed and accuracy. A combined fNIRS-fEEG system was used to record motor cortex activations during each task. Results: With 20 healthy young subjects we replicated the classical kinematics results of the healthy UL movement. Neuro-imagery results provided by the fNIRS showed a co-activation of both motor cortex with a greater contralateral activity. With the EEG we highlighted power modification in the alpha-beta rhythm with a desynchronization occurring at movement. Conclusion: In parallel to the description of the reference brain pattern of UL movement, we showed that combined fNIRS-fEEG can be used in a rehabilitation unit to provide a “Holter of the brain plasticity” during functional movement. Further analysis with the older healthy subjects will give us information about ageing effects. Perspectives of this project will be the exploration of these brain-movement patterns in post-stroke patients in rehabilitation.\n\n5625 - Lateropulsion after hemispheric stroke: A form of spatial neglect involving graviception\n\nShenhao Dai, Céline Piscicelli, Emmanuelle Clarac, Monica Baciu, Marc Hommel, Dominic Pérennou\n\nDepartment of NeuroRehabilitation South Hospital, Univ. Grenoble Alpes, UMR CNRS 5105 Neuropsychology and NeuroCognition, CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Cedex 9, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: To test the hypothesis that lateropulsion is an entity expressing an impaired body orientation with respect to gravity, in relation to a biased graviception and spatial neglect. Methods: Data from the DOBRAS cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03203109), were collected 30 days after a first hemisphere stroke. Lateral body tilt, pushing and resistance were assessed with the Scale for Contraversive Pushing. Results: Among 220 individuals, 72% were Upright and 28% showed lateropulsion (Tilters=14% less severe than Pushers=14%). The three signs had very high factor loadings (>0.90) on a same dimension, demonstrating that lateropulsion was effectively an entity comprising body tilt (cardinal sign), pushing and resistance. The factorial analyses also showed that lateropulsion was inseparable from the visual vertical (VV), a criterion referring to vertical orientation (graviception). Contralesional VV biases were frequent (44%), with a magnitude related to lateropulsion severity: Upright -0.6 (-2.9;2.4), Tilters -2.9 (-7;0.8), Pushers -12.3 (-15.4;-8.5). Ipsilesional VV biases were less frequent and milder (p<0.001). They did not deal with graviception, 84% being found in upright individuals. Multivariate, factorial, contingency, and prediction analyses congruently showed strong similarities between lateropulsion and spatial neglect, the latter encompassing the former. Conclusion: Lateropulsion (pusher syndrome) is a trinity constituted by body tilt, pushing and resistance. It is a way to adjust the body orientation in the roll plane to a wrong reference of verticality. Referring to straight above, lateropulsion might correspond to a form of spatial neglect (referring to straight ahead).\n\n5622 - Preliminary results of an executive function training program coupled with transcranial stimulation in brain-injured patients: A single-case experimental design\n\nClaire Lebely1, Sebastien Scannella2, Evelyne Lepron2, Quentin Chenot2, Alizée Lelievre3, Rodolphe Besse-Armisen3, Philippe Marque3, Evelyne Castel-Lacanal3, Xavier De Boissezon3\n\n1Toulouse NeuroImaging Center, UMR 1214-Inserm/UPS-ToNIC, Purpan Hospital, Toulouse University, Pavillon Baudot, Toulouse, France, 2ISAE-SUPAERO, Toulouse, France, 3PMR, University Hospital of Toulouse, Toulouse, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Cognitive remediations (CR) are designed to address the crucial need for symptom improvement in acquired brain injury patients with deficit in executive functions. The aim of our study is to investigate a CR using virtual reality (CoVirtua), coupled with a transcranial stimulation session (tRNS), to improve performance during ecological situations in brain damaged patients with dysexecutive syndrome. Methods: Five patients were included in this multiple single case study (SCED). Three phases A1-B-A2 followed each other over 12 weeks. Phases A1 and A2 correspond to conventional occupational therapy and phase B corresponds to the intervention under study. The start of phase B is randomised (multiple baselines). The intervention lasts four weeks and consists of four Covirtua sessions per week, each coupled with a 20-minute tRNS session (1 active electrode in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 4 return electrodes, maximum intensity 1 mA). The effect of the intervention is assessed by the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) in the short (A1 vs B) and long term (A1 vs B+A2) with 3 goals defined per patient. Results: Visual and statistical analysis of the GAS scores show an effect of the intervention in both the short and long-term for 2 goals for P01 (“Mailbox management” p= 0.01; “Concentration” p = 0.02); and for 1 goal for P03 (“Managing a shopping list” p=0.02). Regarding long-term effects only, the intervention shows its effectiveness for 1 goal for P02 (“Following a household chores schedule” p=0.03); and for 2 goals for P06 (“Following a recipe” p=0.005; “Managing groceries” p=0.02). Conclusion: These initial results show of a positive effect of Covirtua coupled with tRNS mainly in the long term on executive functioning in daily life.\n\nBiomedical Sciences – Physiology\n\n6193 - The six minutes walking test is a good predictor of the VO2peak in breast cancer patients\n\nStephane Mandigout1, Elise Deluche2, Sophie Leobon2, Laurence Venat2, Nicole Tubiana-Mathieu2\n\n1Disability, Activity, Aging, Autonomy and the Environment (HAVAE), Limoges University, Limoges, France, 2CHU Limoges, Limoges, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: The practice of adapted physical activity (APA) appears to be beneficial for women with breast cancer during treatment. The main objective of this study is to determine the relation between the six minutes walking test (6MWT) and the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) before and after a period of 27 week with or without training program in breast cancer patient. This study was conducted in women during adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: This retrospective study was based on two prospective studies (SAPA and APAC), including a total of 138 patients with breast cancer during their treatment period. In this sample size, 85 patients participate to an APA program lasting 27 weeks with 3 physical activity sessions (two aerobic and one strength training) per week. Before (T0) and after (T1) the training program, each participant realized a CPET to measure VO2peak and a 6MWT on the corridor of the hospital. Results: Considering all the sample size, there is a positive correlation at T0 (r=0.3, p<0.0001) and T1 (r=0.5, p<0.0001) between CPET and 6MWT. We observed the same results for the group with the APA program and the group without it. Conclusion: The 6MWT could be a good predictor of VO2peak in breast cancer patient during their treatment period. The professional of physical activity could use it regularly to estimate the aerobic capacity of the patient.\n\nClinical Sciences – Complications – Other\n\n7013 - Cognitive and mental health impairment 1 year after COVID-19\n\nSónia Tomé, Sara Ribeiro Silva, Joana Ramalho, Gonçalo Engenheiro, Vítor Costa Pereira, Luísa Viana Pinto, Catarina Aguiar Branco\n\nPRM Department, Centro Hospitalar Entre o Douro e Vouga (CHEDV), Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Cognitive impairment has been described in the acute phase of COVID-19, but recent literature suggests it may persist as part of the Long-COVID condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of cognitive deficits and mental health status in COVID-19 survivors. Methods: This was a prospective uncontrolled cohort study. We selected survivors of COVID-19 evaluated in our PRM service who reported memory impairments in a previous telephone interview (n=31). They underwent multiple tests (Mini-mental [MM], MoCA, Subjective memory complaints [SMC] test, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [HADS-A/D] and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]). Results: We interviewed 31 patients (48,4% female), mean age 55,48 years (min. 26; max. 73). Mean time after discharge was 12,48 months (min. 4; max. 22). Most had moderate to severe disease (26 were admitted in ICU, 4 needed intubation and 26 Helmet-CPAP). Mean time of hospital admission was 13,94 days, and mean ICU stay was 6,32 days. The 96,8% had SMC, which were not present before COVID-19. 21% had cognitive impairment in MoCA test and 61,3% had memory impairment in MoCA test. Regarding mental health status, 48,4% had anxiety symptoms in HADS, 42% and 48,4% had depressive symptoms in HADS and BDI, respectively. Conclusion: A significant percentage of survivors reported memory complaints 1 year after COVID-19, and suffered from anxious and depressive symptoms. Despite lacking a control group, our patients denied memory impairment before COVID-19 or reported worsening of symptoms. Only 6 patients had previously diagnosed anxiety or depression. Our study highlights the need of high quality controlled studies, which could help establish the potential burden for patients and healthcare.\n\n6702 - Prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in patients admitted to intensive care for COVID-19: One-year follow-up\n\nMerce Avellanet1, Esther Pages1, Meritxell Ros1, Elvira Gea2, Anna Boada-Pladellorens1\n\n1Department of Rehabilitation, Hospital N Sra de Meritxell, Les Escaldes, Andorra, 2Hospital N Sra de Meritxell Pharmacy, Les Escaldes, Andorra\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV) is a risk factor for oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) after endotracheal intubation (ETI). The prevalence of OD in critical patients varies between 3 and 62%. Studies in patients with COVID-19 who have required ETI hypothesize about motor and sensory alterations. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of OD in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to COVID-19 and at 1-year follow-up (FU). Methods: Prospective study of patients admitted to ICU for COVID-19. Motor, nutritional, and cognitive aspects including OD were assessed with a comprehensive protocol from the beginning of the pandemic. The diagnosis of OD was established 48h post-extubation by clinical examination, volume-viscosity examination test (MECV-V modified) and/or modified BlueDye test in patients with tracheostomy and flexible fiberoptic endoscopy (EF). Results: 149 patients were admitted (110 -73.8% men and 39 -26.2% women) with a mean age of 64.15 years. Sixty-eight patients were excluded, 48 due to death before extubation, 20 patients do not required intubation. The prevalence of post-extubation OD was 53.1% (43/81). The average number of days with ventilatory support was 24.77 (5-116 SD 20.8) and 41 patients (51.3%) required tracheostomy. EF was required for diagnosis and/or follow-up in 44%. A statistically significant relationship was found between the OD and the number of days of MV and length of stay in ICU. No differences were found by age or by days of hospital admission. At 6 months FU, 6/37 patients continued with OD, and 3/23 at 1 year. Conclusion: The prevalence of OD in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU was 53.1%. OD can be a sequel and should be considered.

Neutropenia and immunosuppresion can put patients at higher risk for infection and potentially increased the risk of transfer off of inpatient rehabilitation. Severe thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of physical activity related bleeding. How to safely deliver cancer rehabilitation and incorporate physical activity is a major concern for physiatrists and therapists. Fortunately, recent research publications and clinical experience can be useful guides to allow patients to safely obtain the benefits of exercise and rehabilitation. The presenters will discuss the evidence and discuss potential solutions with respect to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (including exercise precautions and neurogenic bowel and bladder management), medical fragility of cancer patients, considerations for lymphedema patients and the use of modalities in patients with cancer.\n\n5705 - Pelvic floor prehabilitation for rectal cancer surgery to prevent bowel symptoms and pelvic floor dysfunctions: RCT protocol\n\nCinara Sacomori1, Luz Alejandra Lorca2, Mónica Martinez-Mardones2, Marta Natalia Pizarro-Hinojosa2, Jorge Plasser2\n\n1Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile and Universidad Bernardo O´Higgins, Chile, 2Hospital del Salvador, Chile\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) is a common complication after rectal cancer sphincter preserving surgery, presenting symptoms of fecal urgency and anal incontinence. The aim of this study is to describe the rationale for a clinical trial protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of a pre- and post-surgical pelvic floor rehabilitation program on the bowel symptoms, pelvic floor function and quality of life of rectal cancer patients (CAncer of Rectum REhabilitation Trial - CARRET protocol). Methods: Protocol for a RCT with parallel groups (pelvic floor rehabilitation versus control group). Participants and Setting: 56 stage I to III rectal cancer patients undergoing sphincter preservation surgery at Hospital del Salvador, Chile. Main outcome measures: ICIQ-B questionnaire for intestinal symptoms, high-resolution Anorectal Manometry (Alacer Multiplex 24-channel) for anorectal function, pelvic floor muscle strength with Oxford Modified Scale, and a quality-of-life test with the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Interventions: one pre-rehabilitation session (pre-surgery) and 9 to 12 sessions of rehabilitation, including: patient education, pelvic floor muscle exercises, pelvic floor electromyography biofeedback, and capacitive and sensory rectal training with a balloon probe. Rehabilitation will begin 3-5 weeks before the ileostomy is removed (four sessions) and around three weeks after stoma removal (5-8 sessions). Results: We expect the preventative protocol to prevent bowel symptoms and pelvic floor dysfunctions and improve quality of life. Conclusion: More prospective approaches aiming at preventing common cancer treatment problems are needed as to minimize disabilities among rectal cancer survivors.

This prospective cohort study aims to describe the limitations of functioning and the quality of life of Covid-19 survivors at one year of hospitalization. Methods: We studied 70 out of 85 adults consecutively hospitalized for Covid-19 in non ICU wards from March 2020 (age: 63±11, 47 men). Primary study outcomes at three months (T3) and one year (T12) from diagnosis were pulmonary and neurological symptoms and functional data assessed through modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Barthel Dyspnea (BD), vocational and work activity level, SF-36. Results: 71% of survivors were discharged at home. At T3, their condition was worst compared to pre-admission (F=-4.1; p<,0001), with 19% of subjects showing moderate disability (MRS>2/5). Predictors of MRS decrease by one point at T12, compared to pre-admission, were: age, pre-Covid19 MRS score, and pneumonia severity. At T12, 28% of people still showed Covid-19-related neurological signs, like memory impairment, confusion, apathy, and tremor (F = 12.9; p = .003). Dyspnea, moderate or mild at T3 (mean BD= 91), improved at one year (p =.0002) and was the main predictor of a restriction in vocational activities, observed in 54% of subjects at T3 and 40% at T12. At T3, health-related well-being was valued 68%, on average, increasing at T12 though never exceeding 80%. Conclusion: One year after hospitalization for Covid-19, 39% of survivors showed mild to moderate disability and partial or no recovery of vocational activities. Pneumonia severity, age, and pre-existing disability are the main determinants of limitations of functioning characterizing post Covid-19 condition.\n\n6273 - Correlations between disease's severity and rehabilitation outcomes in patients recovering from COVID-19 infection\n\nSheer Shabat, Zeev Meiner\n\nDepartment of Physical Medical Rehabilitation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: COVID-19 pandemic has long-lasting deleterious effect on many aspects of the survivors' life. However, the correlations between the severity of COVID-19 infection and rehabilitation outcomes are still unknown. Methods: 61 post-acute COVID-19 patients underwent a customized rehabilitation program in a rehabilitation daycare facility. The severity of COVID-19 infection was measured according to the WHO clinical progression scale (CPS). Motor, cognitive, psychological and functional variables were measured using standard and specified scales. 19 out of 61 patients underwent nerve conduction studies. Results: Mean age of participants was 54 (range 18-84), 66% were males. 65% had severe disease according to CPS. The mean length of acute hospitalization was 5.6 ± 4.2 weeks, mean rehabilitation time and mean follow up time was 3.2 ± 2.1 months and 7.2 ± 3.2 months, respectively. A significant improvement was found in ADL functions as well as in hand motor strength and walking endurance. Cognitive and psychological findings showed minimal cognitive impairment, minimal anxiety and depression and severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and fatigue level among the survivors. A significant correlation was found between higher CPS and older age, prolonged acute hospitalization and ventilation, lower admission FIM and higher delta FIM. No correlation was found between CPS and FIM at discharge score. Moreover, lower CPS was correlated with anxiety, depression and fatigue and anxiety was correlated to lower delta FIM. Conclusion: As expected, the severity of acute COVID-19 infection affects the rehabilitation outcome in the pandemic survivors. This finding emphasizes the importance of customized multidisciplinary rehabilitation program in order to improve their daily functions and well-being.\n\n5987 - Impact of social distancing and changed health care practice, during COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective cohort study of breast cancer survivors' postsurgery functional condition\n\nPaola Bisoglio1, Alice Lambertucci1, Anna Gastaldi2, Manuela Marchegiani2, Bianca Mosconi1, Elisa Andrenelli1, Maria Gabriella Ceravolo1, Marianna Capecci1\n\n1Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Politecnica delle Marche University, Ancona, Italy, 2Neurorehabilitation Clinic, University-Hospital Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Ancona, Italy\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic led to social distancing and changes in health care practice especially in the first half of 2020 in Italy. This observational retrospective cohort study aimed at describing possible changes in rehabilitative management of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery by comparing the functional conditions of patients admitted to rehabilitation in 2019 and 2020. Methods: Clinical records of the subjects referred to the rehabilitation facility of a Breast Unit were examined and the following data were stratified across the periods 03/2019-02/2020 and 03/2020-02/2021 for the descriptive and comparative analysis: medical visits, breast surgery-related clinical and functional problems, subjects referred for rehabilitation, rehabilitation sessions carried out and outcome. Results: Ninety-two out of 786 (12%; 93% mastectomy) subjects undergoing breast surgery were referred to the physiatrist in 2020 compared to 367 out of 866 (42%; 61% mastectomy) in 2019. They were assessed 64 days after surgery in 2020 and 29 days in 2019 (F= 8.2; p=.004). Fifty-four (60%) needed physiotherapy for the management of post-surgical complications in 2020, 196 (53%) in 2019. In the post-acute phase, women were twice as compromised in shoulder function (QuickDASH) in 2020 compared to 2019 on admission to rehabilitation (F = 8.2; p= .005). The outcome of physiotherapy was the same in 2020 compared to 2019, notwithstanding a significant increase in the number of sessions needed to achieve the goal in 2020 (15 vs 10; F= 5.1; p= .02). Conclusion: This study demonstrated reduced access to rehabilitation services due to COVID-19, which may significantly impact the functional well-being and the care burden of women in the acute post-surgical phase.\n\n5917 - Extracorporeal shock wave therapy, a new therapeutic tool in hypertrophic burn scar: A systematic review\n\nJoão Santos Faria, Carla Hovenkamp, Lurdes Rovisco Branquinho, João Nuno Malta, Alexandra P. Coelho, Joana Santos Costa\n\nPRM Department, Centro Hospitalar, Universitário de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Post-burn hypertrophic scarring is a common complication in burn injuries. It's often associated with impaired function and esthetic deformities. A wide range of treatments has been advocated for this issue. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been applied in the past years in rehabilitation programs. Lately, it has been proposed as a therapeutic tool in the management of scars. This study aims to review the literature for published evidence on the use of ESWT in hypertrophic postburn scars. Methods: We carried on a search on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases with the following terms: “(Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy OR ESWT OR Ultrasonic Therapy [MeSH]) AND (Hypertrophic Scar OR Burn Scar)”. The PRISMA statement was followed for optimal reporting. Results: This search found 351 articles of which 50 were duplicates. After the screening process, 40 articles were assessed for eligibility. A total of 5 articles matched the criteria and were reviewed [Figure 1]. [Table 1] summarizes the retrieved qualitative data. A total of 192 patients were included.\n\nConclusion: Evidence suggests that ESWT has benefits both in esthetic and functional outcomes in postburn hypertrophic scars. It's a feasible and cost-effective method that can add value to non-invasive management of these patients. Large-scale trials should be conducted to establish a standardized protocol.\n\n5861 - The PRINCOVID study – A predictive model for pressure injuries amongst critical COVID-19 patients\n\nAna Vaz1, Mafalda Oliveira1, David Almeida e Reis1, Tiago Moreira2, Ana Isabel Silva1, Afonso Rocha1, José Artur Paiva3\n\n1Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Alameda Prof. Hernâni Monteiro, Porto, Portugal, 2Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Porto, Portugal, 3Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Porto, Portugal\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Intensive care support, required in up to 5% of COVID-19 patients, implies an increased risk of complications, namely pressure injuries (PI). We aim to characterize PI on critically ill COVID-19 patients, identify risk factors and develop a predictive model for PI at intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a consecutive sample of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19, between May 2020 and September 2021. Socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical and laboratory findings at ICU admission and presence of PI, its' severity and location were abstracted from clinical records. Results: 205 patients were included, mostly males (73%) with a mean age of 62 years old. 58% developed PI, mostly multiple (52%). PI were depicted in 14 locations, most often on sacrum (62%) and face (32%). Univariate analysis showed an association between PI and male gender (OR=2.28 p=0.01), hypertension (comorbidity; OR=1.76 p=0.04), hemoglobin (Hb) (OR=0.83 p=0.01), albumin (OR=0.92 p=0.01), C-Reactive Protein (OR=1.03 p=0.04) and Creatine Kinase (CK)-MB (OR=0.99 p=0.02) at ICU admission. On multivariable analysis, male gender, hypertension and low Hb, albumin and CK-MB were all independently associated with PI. The PRINCOVID model (male gender, hypertension, Hb, CK-MB and albumin at ICU admission) reached an area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.72 (p<0.01), surpassing the Braden Scale (AUC-ROC=0.61; p=0.01), with statistical significance (p=0.046). Conclusion: Predictive models at ICU admission are of upmost importance to increase prevention strategies for PI. The PRINCOVID is a multivariable model with higher AUC-ROC in comparison with the Braden Scale, that includes several factors easily assessable on ICU admission.\n\n5397 - The influence of pharyngeal width on poststroke laryngeal aspiration by stroke stage and lesion\n\nKwang-Ik Jung, Jane Chung, Wonil Kang, Jeongeun Lee, Eunjee Lee, Woo-Kyoung Yoo, Suk Hoon Ohn\n\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, South Korea\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: The present study sought to determine whether the pharyngeal width was related to not only laryngeal aspiration but also laryngeal penetration in patients with dysphagia following stroke. Methods: Using the lateral neck roentgenograms, the average of the two pharyngeal widths, [A+B]/2, was calculated in 690 stroke patients. The patients were subdivided into acute stroke (≤ 30 days) and chronic stroke (> 30 days) groups based on stroke duration and subdivided into cerebrum (Rt or Lt hemisphere), cerebellum, and brainstem stroke groups based on stroke lesion location. After the swallowing study, the physician rated the patient on the penetration-aspiration scale (PAS). The pharyngeal widths based on the stroke stage and the stroke lesion location were compared using an ANOVA test. Furthermore, the pharyngeal widths according to the aspiration severity of VFSS were compared using an ANOVA test in each stroke group. Moreover, the optimal cut-off points were determined for predicting the penetration and aspiration so that the difference between the penetration and the aspiration could be elucidated. Results: The pharyngeal widths in each stroke group were wider than the controls (p < 0.05). The pharyngeal widths of the right cerebral hemisphere and brainstem lesion group were wider than that of the control group (p < 0.05). The pharyngeal width was larger in patients with aspiration (PAS 6–8) than patients without penetration/aspiration (PAS 1) (p < 0.05) and patients with penetration (PAS 2–5) (p < 0.05). The optimal cut-off point of the pharyngeal width was 1 mm lesser for the prediction of penetration than for aspiration. Conclusion: The pharyngeal width could be an ancillary method for detecting penetration and aspiration in stroke patients.\n\n5382 - Effect of frailty on hospital outcomes in cancer patients\n\nMuni Rubens, Adrian Cristian\n\nMiami Cancer Institute, Miami, Florida, USA\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: To understand the effects of frailty on hospital outcomes such as in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and healthcare cost among cancer patients using a large database. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of Nationwide Inpatient Sample data, 2005-2014. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay, and cost. We defined prolonged length of stay as stay ≥75th percentile. Propensity-score matching analysis was done to examine whether frailty was associated with length of stay and in-hospital mortality. Results: There was a total of 10,463,083 cancer hospitalizations during the years 2005 to 2014, of which 1,022,777 (9.8%) were frail. The proportion of patients having prolonged length of stay was significantly higher among frail group, compared to non-frail group (53.3% vs 25.3%, P <0.001). Similarly, unadjusted mortality (12.0% vs 5.3%, P <0.001) and hospitalization costs ($29,726 vs $18,595, <em>P<0.001) were significantly higher for frail patients. A total of $28 billion was expended on hospitalization of frail cancer patients during the study period. In propensity score-matched analysis, the odds of in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.50-1.58) and length of stay (OR, style=”color:black”>2.23; 95% CI, 2.18-2.27) were significantly greater for frail patients. Conclusion: Our study found that frailty was associated with an adverse hospital outcome such as increased length of stay, mortality, and healthcare cost among all cancer types. Our findings provide valuable information for risk stratification of cancer patients based on frailty. Concerted efforts by the physiatrists, oncologists, and surgeons towards identifying frailty and incorporating it in risk estimation measures could help in optimizing management strategies for cancers.\n\n5381 - Impact of the suspension of neurogenic detrusor overactivity treatment with botulinum toxin due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nEduardo Freitas Ferreira1, Rui Silva2, Anabela Ferreira2, Maria Paz Carvalho2, Paulo Vale3, Filipa Faria2\n\n1Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando Fonseca, Amadora, Portugal, 2PRM Department, Centro de Medicina de Reabilitação de Alcoitão, Alcoitão, Portugal, 3Department of Urology, Hospital Cuf Descobertas, Lisboa, Portugal\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed an additional pressure on health systems worldwide. Patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) were especially vulnerable to inadequate care. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the suspension of NDO treatment with Botulinum Toxin (BT) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients with spinal cord injury and NDO, who underwent BT treatment in 2018/2019 and, whose scheduled administration in 2020/2021 was suspended. The study protocol was divided into two parts. Phase 1 consisted of data collection from the clinical processes and in phase 2 a standardized telephone questionnaire was applied. Statistical analysis used the McNemar test and the Wilcoxon test with a p-value ≤ 0.05 as level of significance. Results: 21 patients with mean age of 42.0 years and mean disease duration of 16.9 years were included. On average patients were undergoing treatment with BT for 7.6 years and mean inter-treatment frequency was 2.3 years. Mean time since the last BT administration was 2.3 years and mean reported BT effect duration was 11.9 months. A significant increase in the percentage of patients with involuntary urinary loss (p=0.004) and urgency (p=0.031) was found. Additionally, a significant decrease in mean catheterization interval from 4.5 to 3.6 hours (p=0.002) and increase in daily oxybutynin dosage from 8.5 to 12.1 mg (p=0.002) was found. Conclusion: Overall, no significant changes were found for recurrent urinary infections or darifenacin/mirabegron dosages. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic originated clinical worsening of patients undergoing regular intravesical BT treatment for NDO. Thus, interruption of intravesical BT treatment severely affected these patients and needs to be avoided.\n\n4547 - Neurovesical dysfunction in children with Hirschsprung's disease\n\nHasnaa Boutalja, Sanaa Mdarbi, Fatima Lmidmani, Abdellatif El Fatimi\n\n1Department of PRM, University Hospital Center Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, Morocco\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Usually in Hirschsprung's disease (HD), long-term sequelae in children are related to abnormalities in defecation. However, some of these patients also develop lower urinary tract problems. The aim of this study is to assess and define the effects of transanal endorectal pull through procedure in patients with HD on lower urinary tract function by means of urodynamic studies (UDS) performed before and after surgery. Methods: The study was conducted at IBN ROCHD University Hospital during the period from 2012 to 2019. Thirty-eight patients with HD were subjected to urodynamic studies before and after the different definitive surgical procedures. The main outcome measurements were maximum cystometric capacity, compliance, unstable detrusor contraction and residual urinary volume. Results: All patients were males with a mean age of 3 years. Urodynamic findings, were normal in 29 (76%) children, and abnormal in 9 (24%) children. In uroflowmetric study, dysuria with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia and significant post void residual urine were found in the 5 symptomatic children. In cystometric study, nine children had unstable detrusor contraction, low bladder compliance and small-capacity bladder. Conclusion: In HD, neurovesical dysfunction may exist preoperatively and though the incidence of postoperative changes in neurovesical function may appear high. Children who present with urinary problems after surgery should be assessed urodynamically.\n\nKeywords: Hirschsprung's disease, urinary dysfunction, urodynamic study\n\nClinical Sciences – Complications – Spasticity\n\n7018 - Botulinum toxin A for the treatment of poststroke shoulder pain: Randomized controlled trial\n\nMarcelo Riberto1, Eduardo de Melo Carvalho Rocha2\n\n1Associated Professor, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, 2PRM Department, Santa Casa de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Post stroke shoulder pain (PSSP) is highly prevalent and further impairs functioning of spastic stroke survivors. Its etiology is multifactorial and appropriated treatment often depends on a multidisciplinary approach. Botulinum toxin type A (TXB-A) has been indicated for PSSP, although the literature is not definite about pain control following spaticity control in these patients. The aim of our study was to verify the efficacy of the use of TXB-A in two adductor shoulder to reduce pain in PSSP subjects compared to the injection of saline solution after one and four months. Methods: This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized and placebo controlled trial. PSSP subjects were randomly allocated for TXB-A injection in the pectoralis major and subscapularis muscles (Dysport 200 UI each muscle) or the same volume of saline injection. Baseline assessment and after one and four months used pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS), McGill questionnaire, Modified Ashworth Scale, goniometry, Fugl-Meyer scale for upper limbs (FM) and the caregiver's perception of distress in routine tasks. Results: Improvement in pain and spasticity levels were noticed in both groups, more intense in the toxin group, but without statistical significance, although there was significant improvement in caregivers' perception of daily activities with the upper limbs in the TXB-A group (washing the arm p=0.04, removing the shirt p=0.01, wearing buttons p=0.03, doing home exercises p=0.25 and removal of buttons p=0.26). Conclusion: The use of TXB-A in the subscapularis and pectoralis major muscles resulted in a reduction in shoulder pain in spastic hemiplegic patients with passive and active movement although not statistically significant. However, the burden and distress of caregivers were significantly reduced after 1 and 4 months of injection.\n\n6637 - Changes of spasticity across time in prolonged disorders of consciousness: A retrospective study\n\nSchnakers Caroline1, Winters Benjamin2, Kuluris Bruce3, Pathmanaban Rita4, Vanderwalt Hannelise4, Thibaut Aurore5\n\n1Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare, Pomona, California, 2Department of Psychology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, 3Neurorestorative, CA, USA, 4Neurorestorative, CA, USA, 5Coma Science Group, GIGA Consciousness & Centre du Cerveau, University and University Hospital of Liège, 4000 Liège, Belgium\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: In this retrospective study, we investigated how spasticity developed in patients diagnosed with a prolonged DOC over almost a two-year observation period (21 months) and how it related to the patients' age, gender, time since injury, etiology, level of consciousness, and anti-spastic medications. Methods: 19 patients with severe brain injury and prolonged DOC admitted to a long-term care facility were included in the study (14 male, age: 46±15 years; 10 traumatic brain injury: 1±1 year after brain injury; 11 minimally conscious state vs. 8 vegetative state). Each patient was assessed at admission and then quarterly totaling in eight assessments over 21 months. Spasticity was measured with the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) for both upper and lower limbs. The Western Neuro Sensory Stimulation Profile (WNSSP) was administered to assess the level of consciousness. The other medical and demographic information of interest were also obtained through medical records. Linear mixed models were used to assess each variable's impact on the change of spasticity over time. Results: Significant differences were observed in the evolution of spasticity in patients based on their etiology for the upper limbs and on their level of consciousness for the lower limbs. Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that spasticity evolves differently according to the type of brain lesion and the level of consciousness. Spasticity in DOC might therefore be mediated by different mechanisms and might have to be treated differently among patients. Future longitudinal studies should be performed prospectively in a bigger cohort and starts data collection earlier after brain injury to confirm our results and better understand the evolution of spasticity in this population.\n\n6406 - Percutaneous needle lengthening tenotomy for the treatment of equinovarus in adults with brain injury\n\nFlavia Oana Coroian1, Bertrand Coulet2, Clément Richaud1, Sylvain Fazilleau1, Isabelle Laffont1\n\n1Department of PMR, University Hospital Montpellier, Montpellier, France, 2Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University Hospital, Montpellier, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aim: Equinovarus is frequent in adults with brain damage. It can have consequences on pain, standing, footwear, gait or walking capacities. The aim of our work was to assess the results and complications of percutaneous needle lengthening tenotomy of Achilles' tendon performed by a PMR doctor. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was carried out between October 2017 and December 2020. Patients were evaluated at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after the procedure, using the Goal Attainment Scale. Achilles' tendon tenotomy was performed with a 18-gauge needle in the operating room, with the patient sedated. Procedure consisted in three Achilles' tendon hemisections associated to an ankle dorsal flexion up to 0°, knee extended. A 6 weeks ankle immobilization in a resin cast was associated. The tenotomy of the toe's flexors was performed in all cases. Results: Twenty-three patients were included (12 men). Both feet were involved in six cases (26, 03%). Achilles' tendon contracure had occurred following stroke (n = 8), head trauma (n = 6), cerebral palsy (n = 4), neurodegenerative diseases (n = 5). Patients' mean age was 53.6 y (28-77). The mean equinus value was 37.14 (20-50). Varus of the hindfoot was associated in 10 cases (35, 71%). For 15 patients (60, 8%) the main outcome was walking capacities. Outcome was reached at 3 months and maintained at one year in all cases. One patient presented an overcorrection. No vascular, skin or nerve complications occurred. Conclusion: Percutaneous needle lengthening tenotomy is an efficient technique for treating equinovarus in patients with brain injuries, even if functional outcome. As previously reported, it has a very low rate of complications. Patient's sedation allows the tenotomy to be performed under better conditions. This procedure can be realized by a trained PMR doctor.\n\n5600 - Reduced spasticity-associated pain in adults following treatment with incobotulinumtoxin A: A pooled analysis\n\nJörg Wissel1, Alexandre Camões Barbosa2, Georg Comes3, Michael Althaus3, Astrid Scheschonka3, David M. Simpson4\n\n1Department of Neurorehabilitation and Physical Therapy, Vivantes Hospital Spandau, Berlin, Germany, 2Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Central, Lisbon, Portugal, 3Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany, 4Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, New York, USA\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aims: Spasticity-associated pain (SAP) of limbs post-stroke or from other aetiologies limits mobility and quality of life and impacts psychosocial well-being. This pooled analysis evaluated the efficacy of incobotulinumtoxinA (incoA) for treating upper limb SAP in adults. Methods: Pain-relief data were pooled from six phase 2 or 3 studies (four double-blind, placebo-controlled) of incoA (one to four injection cycles [ICs], each 12–14 weeks) for treating upper limb spasticity in adults. SAP was assessed at baseline and 4 weeks post-injection using the Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) for pain; response was defined as a ≥1-point improvement in score from baseline. Only data for patients with pain at baseline were analysed. Response rates for incoA versus placebo were evaluated at IC1 week 4 using a Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis (odds ratio [OR] and 95% Wald confidence interval [CI]). Complete pain relief (DAS pain score=0) at IC1 week 4 was compared between treatments using a Chi-square test. Results: Overall, 544 (incoA, N=415; placebo, N=129) of 937 patients (58.1%) experienced SAP at baseline. At week 4 of IC1, 52.1% of incoA- versus 28.7% of placebo-treated patients had a response (p<0.0001). IncoA-treated patients were 2.6 times more likely to achieve a response than placebo-treated patients. (OR 2.62 [95% CI 1.62–4.24]; p<0.0001). At IC1 week 4, 27.1% of incoA- versus 12.4% of placebo-treated patients reported complete pain relief (p=0.0006). Pain response and relief rates were sustained and showed a cumulative effect throughout the study. Conclusion: To optimize patient-centric care, pain relief may be considered a treatment goal in adults with SAP. These study results support the use of incoA to treat upper limb SAP.\n\n6214 - Real-life prognosis of neurologic complications of botulinum toxin used in the fields of neurology and PRM: A pharmacovigilance study\n\nVincent T. Carpentier1, Nicolas Weiss2, Joe-Elie Salem3, Charles Joussain4, Jonathan Levy4, Louise-Laure Mariani2, François Montastruc5, Julien Mahé6, Bénédicte Lebrun-Vignes7, Djamel Bensmail8, Pierre Denys8, François Genet8, Kévin Bihan3\n\n1Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Raymond Poincaré Hospital, ISPC Synergies, APHP Paris Saclay University, Garches, France, 2Department of Neurology, APHP Sorbonne University, La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France, 3Regional Pharmacovigilance Center, APHP Sorbonne University, La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, France, 4Department of PRM, AP-HP.

However neurologic complications of botulinum toxin can lead to respiratory failure or death. This study aims to characterize real-life prognosis and clinical features of botulinum toxin related neurologic complications. Methods: A nationwide pharmacovigilance study of all neurologic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to use of botulinum toxins A and B in France in the fields of neurology and PRM between 1994 and 2020. Accessing data from the unique French pharmacovigilance database allows the study of detailed narrative safety descriptions reported by healthcare professionals using share methods of causality assessment. Results: 151 neurologic systemic complications and 40 with local complications were included, with a patient's age of 53 [36; 66] years; 107 (56 %) were women. Except three miscellaneous cases, all cases presented symptoms belonging to the clinical spectrum of botulism, either as an isolated symptom (41%) or as multiple symptoms (59%), with a time to onset of 12 [7; 15] days after injection and a duration of 54 [28; 90] days. Eighty three percent of cases were spontaneously recovered or were recovering on the date of notification. Reported drugs were not different between cases with local or systemic ADRs, although the doses were higher in cases with systemic ADRs (P < .001). Serious cases were more frequent for systemic ADRs (67% versus 34%; P < .001). Three complications resulted in death, all after treatment for cervical dystonia or sialorrhea. Conclusions: Neurologic complications related to botulinum toxin are often serious, but with a good prognosis; only injections in the cervical region are associated with complications resulting in death.\n\n5894 - How effective is management of spasticity-associated pain with botulinum toxin in upper limbs: Do treated segments matter?\n\nSérgio Pinho1, Luisa Medeiros2, Filipa Correia2, Adriana Pascoal3, Jorge Jacinto2, Ricardo Sousa2, Jorge Jacinto2\n\n1Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, Lisbon, Portugal, 2Centro de Medicina de Reabilitação de Alcoitão, Alcabideche, Portugal, 3Centro de Medicina de Reabilitação da Região Centro – Rovisco Pais, Tocha, Portugal\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aims: Post-stroke spasticity (PSS) patients commonly experience pain in affected limbs, which impacts quality of life. However, treatment success in reaching individual goals using Botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) is not well documented. This study aims to analyze the achievement of pain-related goals in patients treated in the upper limb (UL). Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively, non-interventionally collected data of PSS patients treated with BoNTA in 2001-2021. Patients were divided in 2 groups by location of UL BoNTA injection (shoulder: G1 vs non-shoulder: G2). Mean Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) T-score (achieved and change) and success rate for pain goals (GAS≥0) were compared between groups (SPSS v.25). Results: From an initial sample of 2635 treatment sessions (288 patients), 395 were included for analysis of treatment success in UL pain goals. Mean patient age was 58.37±12.05 years, 58.2% females and 63.5% ischemic strokes. Abobotulinum BoNTA was used in 66.6%, Onabotulinum in 21%, and Incobotulinum in 12.4%. G1 included 277 sessions and G2 118 sessions. Most treatment sessions in both groups presented an expected or greater than expected outcome regarding pain goals (G1:86.3% vs G2:85.6%), this proportion was independent of the anatomical region injected (p=0.856). The mean GAS T-score achieved was better in G1 (49.17±5.14) compared with G2 (47.87±4.55) with a statistically significant difference (p=0.018), as well as the mean GAS T-score change (G1:12.68±5.18 vs G2:11.35±4.30, p=0.015). Conclusions: Success rates for pain related goals were good and similar between groups. Achieved T-scores and T-score changes were significantly favorable to G1. Spasticity-related pain seemed to respond better to BoNTA injections of shoulder muscles than other locations in UL.\n\n5847 - Triceps surae muscle characteristics in spastic hemiparetic stroke survivors treated with botulinum toxin type A: Clinical implications from ultrasonographic evaluation\n\nAlessio Baricich1, Marco Battaglia2, Lucia Cosenza3, Alberto Loro2, Paola Morlino4, Paolo Prandi4, Marco Polverelli3, Lorenza Scotti5, Michele Bertoni6, Andrea Santamato7\n\n1Department of Health Sciences, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Università del Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy, 2Department of Health Sciences, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Università del Piemonte Orienta, Vercelli, Italy, 3Rehabilitation Unit, AO AL National Hospital, Alessandria, Italy, 4Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Ospedale Maggiore della Carità University Hospital, Novara, Italy, 5Department of Translational Medicine, Università del Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy, 6Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, ASST Settelaghi, Varese, Italy, 7Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Università di Foggia, Foggia, Italy\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aims: Equinovarus foot is the most common condition in post-stroke spasticity (PSS), leading to impaired gait and poor functional performances. Notably, spastic muscles undergo a dynamic evolution following typical pathophysiological patterns, reporting fibroadipose infiltration and contractile mass loss. Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A (BoNT-A) is the gold standard for focal spasticity treatment. Due to its pharmacological mechanism, a possible role in spastic muscle evolution has been widely discussed. This study aims to assess, in stroke survivors, changes in ultrasonographic muscle structure in relation to BoNT-A treatment. Methods: we enrolled patients affected by PSS addressed to our Unit for BoNT-A treatment. We acquired images of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus (SOL). Images were processed to measure the muscle thickness (MT, cm), the cross-sectional area (CSA, cm2), the pennation angle (α,) and the mean grey value (MGV, range 0-255). Results: 53 patients were enrolled. Compared to the unaffected side, MG and SOL alterations appear to depend on the spasticity only and not on the BoNT-A treatment. In functionally preserved patients (functional ambulation classification, FAC > 3; modified Ashworth scale, MAS ≤ 2), the ultrasonographic changes of MG compared to ipsilateral SOL observed in the paretic limb alone seems to be due to histological, anatomical, pathophysiological and biomechanical differences between the two muscles. In subjects with poor walking capability and more severe spasticity, such ipsilateral difference was found in both calves. Conclusions: BoNT-A treatment, even when applied in repeated cycles, does not seem to influence muscle degeneration, which appears to be primarily related to the already reported spastic muscle evolution.\n\n5746 - Perioperative botulinum toxin to enhance outcomes of surgeries on spastic limbs: A review of current literature and implications for clinical practice\n\nRajiv Reebye1,2,3, Heather Finlayson4, Sepehr Saeidiborojeni1\n\n1Canadian Advances in Neuro-Orthopedics for Spasticity Congress, Canada, 2Division of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, 3GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre, Vancouver, BC, 4CANOSC - Division of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, UBC, Vancouver, Canada\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aims: We present the results of our recent studies regarding perioperative use of Botulinum Toxin (BoNT). Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the evidence for perioperative injection of BoNT to enhance outcomes of surgeries on spastic limbs.[1] We then published the first case series of patients with different spasticity etiologies who benefited from BoNT administration pre-, intra-, and postoperatively to optimize their surgical outcomes.[2] Lastly, we performed a cross-sectional survey of Canadian physicians with expertise in spasticity management regarding their implementation of perioperative BoNT in clinical practice.[3]Results: Our systematic review found level 1 evidence that preoperative BoNT is effective for reducing pain, spasticity, and analgesic use in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy, but that intraoperative BoNT is not. Our case series demonstrated that perioperative BoNT improved surgical outcomes in patients with spasticity due to different etiologies. In our national survey, spasticity management specialists responded they administer perioperative BoNT to improve outcomes of surgeries on spastic limbs, with optimal timing suggested to be 2-3 weeks pre-surgery, and no known perioperative complications or adverse events. Conclusions: Perioperative BoNT injections can improve surgical outcomes on spastic limbs. Our studies highlight a need for more robust research to clarify the optimal timing for perioperative BoNT injection, and to enhance awareness and collaboration among physicians and surgeons when planning surgeries on spastic limbs.\n\nReferences\n\nSaeidiborojeni S.

Simpson4\n\n1Department of Neurorehabilitation and Physical Therapy, Vivantes Hospital Spandau, Berlin, Germany, 2Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Central, Lisbon, Portugal, 3Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany, 4Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, New York, USA\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aims: Spasticity-associated pain (SAP) of limbs post-stroke or from other aetiologies can vary in severity, and relief of this pain is an important treatment goal. This pooled analysis evaluated the efficacy of incobotulinumtoxinA (incoA) for treating upper limb SAP in adults by baseline pain severity. Methods: Pain-relief data were pooled from six phase 2 or 3 studies (four double-blind, placebo-controlled) of incoA for treating upper limb spasticity in adults. SAP was assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks post first injection using the Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) for pain; response was defined as a ≥1-point improvement in score from baseline. Only data for patients with pain at baseline were analysed. Response rates for incoA versus placebo by baseline pain severity (mild, moderate, severe) were evaluated using a Chi-square test. Results: Overall, 544 of 937 patients (58.1%) experienced SAP at baseline, of whom 415 received incoA (mild SAP, n=177; moderate SAP, n=175; severe SAP, n=63) and 129 received placebo (n=58, 46, 25, respectively). At week 4, response rates with incoA versus placebo were 43.9% versus 19.0% for adults with mild SAP (p=0.0007), 54.7% versus 34.8% for those with moderate SAP (p=0.0165) and 67.7% versus 40.0% for those with severe SAP (p=0.0169). At week 4, a greater number of incoA- than placebo-treated patients reported a lower level of pain severity compared with baseline, regardless of baseline pain severity (p<0.05 for incoA vs placebo in all severity groups). Conclusion: To optimize patient-centred care, pain relief may be considered an important treatment goal in adults with upper limb SAP, irrespective of baseline pain severity. These results support the use of incoA to relieve upper limb SAP of any severity level.\n\n4641 - Motor nerve blocks in the management of spasticity in 88 Tunisian patients\n\nInes Aloulou1, Leila Ghidaoui2, Amamni Meherzia Khezami2, Imen Miri2, Sonia Lebib2, Fatma Zohra Ben Salah2, Catherine Dziri2\n\n1Institut Kassab, médecine physique, Tunis, Tunisie, 2Service de médecine physique réadaptation, Institut national d'orthopédie MT Kassab, La Manouba, Tunisie\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aims: Local treatment of spasticity with Botulinium Toxin can improve motor and function capacities. However, it's not simple to determine if inhibition of spasticity will be benefic. The aim of this study was to expose our medical approach of spasticity by Motor Nerve Block (MNB). Methods: This study was descriptive and retrospective including patients hospitalized in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation unit in Kassab Institute, Tunis/Tunisia, from January 2018 to January 2021, having spasticity with neuroorthopedic and/or functional disorders. Data collected was age, sex, etiology and neurological status. MNB consists in local anaesthesia of a nerve by Lidocaine 1%. Clinical assessment before and after MNB included spasticity by using Modified Ashworth scale, range of motion in degrees, function of upper limb by Frenchay scale, gait for lower limb and satisfaction of the patient. MNB was considered positive if it improves range of motion and/or function. Results: We included 88 patients with medium age 31 years, sex ratio 1.4, children 26%, hemiparesia in 40% and tetraparesia in 38%. Cerebral palsy was the etiology in 50%. MNB was done in upper limb in 39% and was positive in 80%, for lower limb, it was done in 70% and was positive in 79%. Botulinium Toxin was not prescribed after positive blocks in 2% because of dissatisfaction of patients. Surgery was indicated in 5% of patients not improved after MNB. Conclusion: The approach of the assessment of muscles involved in a spasticity pattern by MNB is important before Botulinium Toxin injections. The satisfaction of patients must be considered in the decision of treatment.\n\n4556 - Diagnostic motor nerve blocks: E-survey of current practices in physical rehabilitation medicine in France\n\nHélène Spittler1, Isabelle Laffont2, Manuella Fournier-Mehouas1, Flavia Coroian2, Claire Jourdan2, Fanny Pradalier2, Pierre Blanc1, Xavier Capdevila3, François Feuvrier2\n\n1Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Nice University Hospital, Nice, France, 2Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier, France, 3Department of Anesthesiology, Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aims: Spasticity resulting from a central nervous system damage can be responsible for functional disorders, although it can be helpful. Motor nerve blocks (MNB) are used to assess spastic pathological patterns and to guide treatment options. The SOFMER and SFAR (Société Française de Médecine Physique et Réadaptation - Société Française d'Anesthésie et de Réanimation) guidelines on MNB practice in Physical Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) were published in 2019. The objective of our survey was to analyze the impact of these guidelines on current MNB practice by PRM physicians in France. Methods: An online survey, addressed by email to PRM physicians across France, was conducted from June to August 2020 including 28 questions. Results: A total of 73 PRM physicians, from 25 different departments in France, participated. Forty-seven percent of the responders were not performing MNB before the new guidelines. The reasons highlighted were a lack of training and knowledge on the topic (87%, 27/31 responders), a lack of previous recommendations (23%, 7/31 responders) and time constraints in medical practice (16%, 5/31 responders). The SOFMER-SFAR guidelines led to an increase of the rate of MNB practiced for 20% of the responders (14/70 responders) and resulted in 14% (10/70 responders) of physicians to start practicing MNB. MNB were performed most of the time by a PRM physician (96%, 48/50 responders) and not by an anesthesiologist. Fifty eight percent (36/62 responders) found the guidelines “very useful”. Conclusions: The 2019 SOFMER-SFAR guidelines clarified numerous points and laid solid practical foundations to perform MNB for assessing spasticity. Our survey highlights the growing interest to perform MNB in PMR departments in France.\n\nClinical Sciences – Diagnostic Approaches – Electrodiagnostics (3)\n\n6309 - Electromyographic findings in patients with vocal cord dysfunction; a clinical study\n\nMansoor Rayegani1, Ahmad Raeissadat1, Mahboobeh Karimi-Galougahi2, Mina Heidari1\n\n1Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, 2Chronic Respiratory Disease Research Center, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung, Tehran, Iran\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aims: This study was aimed to evaluate electromyographic findings in patients with vocal cord dysfunction referred to the physical medicine and rehabilitation department, Shohada Tajrish hospital, Tehran, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional analytical study was carried out on 27 patients with vocal cord dysfunction (between March 2019- December 2020). participants were candidates for performing larynx electrocardiogram of the cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid muscles to evaluate the outer branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, and involvement of laryngeal nerve recurrent, respectively. Demographic information and electromyogram findings were recorded and analyzed using SPSS ver. 22 with chi square test. Results: 27 subjects enrolled in which 18 subjects (66.7%) were male and 9 subjects (33.3%) were female. In terms of patient's history, 9 patients (33.3%) with the head and neck surgery history, 5 patients (18.5%) with longtime intubation, 4 patients (14.8%) with tracheostomy, 4 patients with trauma history, and 5 patients (18.5%) with other reasons were reported. Moreover, recurrent laryngeal and superior laryngeal were reported in 14 (51.9%) and 2 (7.4%) patients, the rest were defined by both nerves (11 patients, 40.7%). Regarding the EMG severity, 9 subjects (33.3%) with normal findings, 8 subjects (29.6%) with high grade and 10 subjects (37%) with low grade were confirmed. There were significant associations between the phonation with laryngoscopy findings (P=0.01), EMG severity with laryngoscopy findings (P=0.04), and vocal cord with EMG findings (P<0.001). Conclusion: Defining etiology, severity, and prognosis of nerve injuries related to vocal cord impairments, electromyographic profile evaluations would be an effective diagnostic method to reach better results in the illness management.\n\n4477 - Kinematic analysis and sEMG for the quantitative analysis of movements in facial nerve palsy\n\nAndrea Demeco, Nicola Marotta, Lucrezia Moggio, Ilaria Pino, Annalisa Petraroli, Antonio Ammendolia\n\nUniversity Magna Graecia of Catanzato, Catanzaro, Italy\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nBackground and Aims: Facial nerve palsy (FNP) worsens the patient's quality of life. In individuals with FNP undergoing facial rehabilitation, methods for measuring the severity of loss of function are useful in diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. The aim is to propose a new evaluation protocol with kinematic analysis coupled with sEMG for patients with FNP, quantifying the degrees of excursion of the facial muscles and the symmetry of voluntary movements. Methods: Kinematic and sEMG analyzes were performed on 20 healthy adults (group A) as a starting point to have a normal range and to assess reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and 10 patients with facial nerve palsy (group B) followed until the end of the rehabilitation program. Results: The protocol shows high intra-subject and inter- intra rater reliability (ICC>0.9 for most part). Group B reported a significant improvement in the movement of frontalis muscle (P=0,0118) after 4-week treatment from the beginning (T0) 9,8±4,5 mm to the end of rehabilitation (T1) 16,3±5,8 mm and orbicularis oris (P=0,0143) from T0 14,8±5,5 mm to T1 20,3±3,3 mm and, a reduction of % of maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) at T1 for frontalis and orbicularis compared to T0. Conclusions: This protocol provides meaningful data in a simple, cheap, reliable and objective way for the functional evaluation of patients with PNF and guides the physician on the most appropriate treatment strategies.\n\nReferences\n\nRobinson MW, Baiungo J.
