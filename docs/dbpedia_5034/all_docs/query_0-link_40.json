        "text": "Over the course of 40 years, Vincenzo Funghini (1828-1896) accumulated a wide range of maiolica objects that are now treasured in many private and public collections. Born in Castiglion Fiorentino, in Arezzo's district, Tuscany, Funghini was an engineer, architect and archaeologist that became one of the most important nineteenth-century collectors and antiquarians of Italian maiolica. During his lifetime, he published texts related to his collections including a booklet accompanying the national industrial exhibition in Milan of 1881, where he showcased 72 items from over 4000 examples of his prehistoric weapons. On the subject of Italian ceramics, he wrote about the Medici porcelain to provide a context for two treasured pieces from his collection. In response to publications by Federigo Argnani, Funghini published also on the maiolica production in Cafaggiolo, Mugello and Faenza, at that time thought to be the most significant ceramic centres in Italy of around 1500. To this list of writings, it is important to add the twenty-five diaries preserved in the State Archives in Arezzo. In large part unpublished, the volumes provide invaluable information for the analysis of the life of the collector. In this article I will briefly reconstruct Funghini's approach to his collection, as seen through the lens of his personal accounts. Subsequently, I will focus on his contacts with international collectors. These diaries inform our understanding of the appreciation for Italian Renaissance maiolica across Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, tin-glazed earthenware dishes known as maiolica became an interactive means of entertaining viewers in the context of dining through the combination of painted imagery and inscriptions. Beginning around 1530, painters of a type of narrative-painted maiolica, known as ‘istoriato,’ began to include lengthy inscriptions on the reverses of dishes that often identified subjects and included excerpts of poetry. These inscriptions demonstrate three important features: first, dishes must have been handled by viewers in order to read the inscriptions, either while on display or during a meal; second, the more complex inscriptions were intended to encourage greater engagement between the viewer and ceramic dish and generate increased interaction and conviviality among guests, and third, maiolica painters were attempting to raise their standing in court circles by demonstrating their literary knowledge through the addition of these inscriptions. These inscriptions are discussed in the context of Renaissance banquets where discussions of literary subjects took place."
