The independent British film Ex Machina was distributed by Universal Pictures. It made $33 million worldwide after its release. To market the film to its target audience of 15-25 year olds interested in technology and sci-fi, the distributors used social media, the film's website, and promoted the filmmakers. They sold the film digitally through iTunes and as Blu-Rays, which would appeal to the tech-savvy audience. The film was a success, winning four awards at the British Independent Film Awards including best film and best director for Alex Garland.
