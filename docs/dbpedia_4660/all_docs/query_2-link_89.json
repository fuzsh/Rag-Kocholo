        "text": "Topline\n\nDirector and producer Christopher Nolan will be working with Universal Pictures for his new World War II movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the nuclear bomb, according to multiple news outlets, stepping back from Warner Bros. Studios for the first time after working with the studio exclusively for 19 years.\n\nKey Facts\n\nKey Background\n\nNolan has worked with Warner Bros. since his 2002 film Insomnia, directing a trio of high-grossing Batman movies,as well as , Inception, Dunkirk and Interstellar. When the coronavirus pandemic began, studios had to figure out how to adjust to the widespread closure of movie theaters and fears of contracting the virus that depressed ticket sales when they were open. Warner Bros. was the first big studio to say it would release its 2021 movies both on streaming and in movie theaters, which met with pushback from Nolan and other directors and actors. Director Patty Jenkins said at a recent CinemaCon 2021 panel that the decision to release her movie Wonder Woman 1984 on HBO Max and in theaters at the same time was a “heartbreaking experience and hugely detrimental to the movie” because her film was made with movie theater screens and surround sound in mind. The decision to premiere Black Widow on streaming service Disney Plus also led to a lawsuit from its star Scarlett Johansson, who said the move breached her contract for a wide theatrical release.\n\nWhat We Dont Know\n\nIf Nolan will return to work with Warner Bros. in the future. When asked about the Nolan situation in June, Warner Bros. Group Chairman Toby Emmerich told the L.A. Times, \"Only Chris Nolan knows what his next movie's going to be, but we do hope it will be at Warner Bros.\"\n\nFurther Reading\n\nScarlett Johansson Sues Disney For Releasing ‘Black Widow’ On Streaming Service (Forbes)"
