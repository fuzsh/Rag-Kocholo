        "text": "American animation studio\n\nUniversal Animation Studios LLC[5] (formerly known as Universal Cartoon Studios) is an American animation studio and a division of Universal Pictures, which is a subsidiary of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast. It has produced direct-to-video sequels to Universal-released feature films, such as The Land Before Time, An American Tail, Balto, and Curious George, as well as other films and television series.\n\nThe actual animation production is done overseas, usually by foreign animation studios such as AKOM, Wang Film Productions and Rough Draft Studios, while pre-production and post-production is United States-based.\n\nThe television animation divisions of Universal and DreamWorks merged on August 23, 2016 after Universal completed its acquisition of DreamWorks Animation, who began producing a majority of Universal Pictures' family friendly TV shows.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nUniversal Animation Studios was established in 1990 as Universal Cartoon Studios, the animation division of MCA Inc.[7] It was originally a subsidiary of Universal Family Entertainment, which was headed by Jeff Segal.[8] Its debut work was Back to the Future: The Animated Series, which was announced on March 22, 1991, and premiered on CBS on September 14 the same year.[9][10]\n\nIn 1996, the two groups Universal Family Entertainment and its subsidiary Universal Cartoon Studios were absorbed into MCA Television Entertainment.[11]\n\nIn 2005, Universal Cartoon Studios was absorbed into Universal Studios Family Productions, and later on, it was renamed to Universal Animation Studios.[12][13]\n\nFranchises\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is not including the original films of An American Tail, The Land Before Time and Balto made by either Hanna-Barbera Productions, Sullivan Bluth Studios or Amblimation.\n\nTitles Release dates Movies TV Seasons Woody Woodpecker 1991–present1 2 6 An American Tail 1986–1999 4 1 The Land Before Time 1988–2016 14 2 Balto 1995–2004 3 0 Alvin and

development and awaiting Steven Spielberg's approval in June 1993.[24] The series would have centered on John Hammond's attempts to finish Jurassic Park and open it to the public, while InGen's corporate rival Biosyn is simultaneously planning to open their own dinosaur theme park in Brazil, which ultimately ends with their dinosaurs escaping into the jungles.[25][26][27] Artist William Stout was hired to work on the series and subsequently made a trailer to demonstrate how the series would look, and how it would combine traditional animation with computer animation. The series required Spielberg's final approval before it could go into production. However, Spielberg had grown tired of the massive promotion and merchandise revolving around the film, and never watched the trailer.[28] On July 13, 1993, Margaret Loesch, president of the Fox Children's Network, confirmed that discussions had been held with Spielberg about an animated version of the film. Loesch also said, \"At least for now and in the foreseeable future, there will not be an animated Jurassic Park. That's Steven Spielberg's decision, and we respect that decision.\"[29]\n\nA pair of traditionally animated cutscenes were produced for the 1996 video game Crash Bandicoot to serve as the game's intro and outro, as well as act as source material for a potential animated series if the game was well-received and commercially successful. The hand-drawn cutscenes were dropped after Sony Computer Entertainment picked up Crash Bandicoot for publication, as Sony desired to push the PlayStation's 3D polygonal graphics. The cutscenes were uploaded to YouTube by producer David Siller in 2015.[30][31]\n\nJurassic Park: Chaos Effect, an animated television series based on The Lost World: Jurassic Park, was confirmed to be in development within the third part of a four-part comic adaptation of the film published by Topps Comics in July 1997.[32][33] In November 1997, it was reported that the cartoon would be accompanied by Jurassic Park: Chaos Effect, a series of dinosaur toys produced by Kenner and based on a premise that scientists had created dinosaur hybrids consisting of DNA from different creatures.[34][35] That month, it was also reported that the cartoon could be ready by March 1998, as a mid-season replacement.[34] The Chaos Effect toyline was released in June 1998,[35] but the animated series was never produced, for unknown reasons.[36]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nIllumination\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nDreamWorks Animation Television\n\nList of Universal Pictures theatrical animated feature films\n\nList of unproduced Universal Pictures animated projects\n\nList of animation studios owned by Comcast NBCUniversal"
