        "text": "Variants:\n\nOn a black background, we see a globe on the top left with Carl Laemmle smiling in the middle whilst the globe is rotating at a normal pace. On the bottom right hand corner we see \"Carl Laemmle\" in a script font like the normal logo and says \"Presents\" below it.\n\nAnother variant has the rotating globe but with the \"CARL LAMMMLE\" text in a capitalized font.\n\nClosing Variant (Smouldering Fires): On a black background it says \"It's a Universal Picture\", with \"Universal\" in a cursive font.\n\nFX/SFX: The globe rotating.\n\nMusic/Sounds: An organ theme for the normal logo whilst for the variant it has a descending orchestra which could be an opening to the movie. On both prints of the film it would be normally silent like the original film.\n\nAvailability: Like most early Universal logos, extremely rare. Can be seen on the silent film Smouldering Fires, and the variant can be seen on another silent film Head Winds.\n\nEditor's Note: This is an unusual Universal logo, as it is the only one where the globe is not the focal point.\n\n6th Logo\n\n(1927-September 17, 1936)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/48802f8e4bda1e2fb6a71a22705ce15f62e50c49\" width=\"265\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/6809d70430f6f9960998a53342504bba409d994b\" width=\"265\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/a1678609576e07f2953d64202c3c42d48be2c2c9\" width=\"265\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Airplane Passing Globe II\", \"Biplane II\", \"Cheesy Globe IV\" \"Golden Age Globe\", \"Earth Globe III\"\n\nLogo: On a cloud-like background, an earth globe rotates. No clouds are visible on the globe. As the globe rotates, a biplane flies around it, with \"A UNIVERSAL PICTURE\" being wiped in diagonally as the biplane passes the globe.\n\nTrivia: The biplane is a Lockheed 8C Sirius.\n\nVariants:\n\nThe position of the globe varies per movie.\n\nThe logo was cropped to 1.85 for Universal's 75th Anniversary logo in 1990. However, full screen prints of the logo retains the full aspect ratio.\n\nClosing Variants:\n\nThe words \"THE END\" are seen superimposed over the globe and the sky is darker. Then, seconds later, \"IT'S A UNIVERSAL PICTURE\" fades in.\n\nAnother closing variant exists where the globe is at the bottom right corner rotating. On the top it says \"The End\" in a cursive font. \"It's a Universal Picture\" (also in cursive) is superimposed over the globe. A ray of light also shines down on the globe. On some films, the text is on the bottom left corner. Starting around 1933, the text is in a Broadway font.\n\nOn short films, instead of the text saying \"It's a Universal Picture\", the text is replaced with \"It's a Universal Short\".\n\nOn cartoons, it says \"It's a Universal Cartoon\" in a script font.\n\nFX/SFX: The biplane, wiping on of letters, and the globe. The biplane and globe are both models.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Just the sound of the biplane's engine.\n\nAvailability: Rare. Can be seen on films of this era. This logo can sometimes be seen after the current Universal logos on certain movies. The earlier DVD releases of Frankenstein and Dracula have plastered this with the B&W variation of the 1997 logo, while the later VHS releases of the films plaster this with the B&W variation of the 1963 logo. Early Betamax and VHS releases of the films do not use a logo at all, though it can be seen on the alternate opening for the former on its 2005 Special Edition DVD and the 2012 DVD & Blu-ray of the two aforementioned titles. This is also seen on Bride of Frankenstein, including its 1984 MCA Home Video VHS release. It appears on TCM's print and the Criterion and Universal DVD releases of My Man Godfrey, although several public domain prints of the film have the logo removed entirely.\n\nEditor's Note: This is an impressive logo for its era.\n\n7th Logo\n\n(May 11, 1936-August 16, 1946)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"167\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/683b08bad3eba9012c261d4c6ca3da400385c318\" width=\"295\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"167\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/0f756c111e897f985e17d3571af591419b80c031\" width=\"295\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"The Art-Deco Globe\", \"Rotating Letters\", \"Cheesy Globe V\", Cheesy Universal \"Golden Age Globe II\"\n\nLogo: A stylized glass globe is seen, tilted at an angle. Around the globe, the words \"A UNIVERSAL PICTURE\" rotate, in a stylized 1930's font. Stylized five-point stars (a la the stars on the Paramount logo) surround the globe.\n\nVariant:\n\nOn some color releases, like colorized Woody Woodpecker cartoons at the time,the logo is tinted blue.\n\nOn the colorized versions of the Universal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1t1H8SIcCpfv2WkStdn9rpM4ALgXvSRg\" target=\"_self\">Sherlock Holmes movies</a>, the letters are gold colored.\n\nLike the previous logo, this logo was also cropped to 1.85 for Universal's 75th anniversary logo in 1990. The full screen version retains the full aspect ratio.\n\nClosing Variant: Superimposed on a special background or in the last seconds of a movie, we see the words \"The End\" with lettering that varies on the movie along with the text \"A Universal Picture\" or \"A Universal Release\".\n\nFX/SFX: The stars, globe, and rotating letters, done in live action, which looks pretty impressive for its time.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A proud, bombastic orchestral fanfare, composed by Jimmy McHugh. Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid uses a remix of the tune. From about 1945 onwards, the opening theme of the movie was used instead of the fanfare.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. Can be seen on Universal releases of the era. This doesn't show up that often on TV since the movies it appears on don't appear as often as newer movies (so you might have to look on home media), but Svengoolie on Me-TV happens to be one of the best sources of this logo (and other older logos from other movie companies). The last regular appearance of this logo was on the Woody Woodpecker cartoon \"Woody the Giant Killer\".\n\nEditor's Note: A stylish logo for the time.\n\n8th Logo\n\n(August 28, 1946-May 8, 1964)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/ccecd13a1d4ef318232923731a1e499465c00c33\" width=\"266\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/4b80dda8060f79db0eccda957592fe0ca369f80f\" width=\"197\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/8041786e01279b8c242fbd6049b8b0ad923cb621\" width=\"265\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/4e6f237e646e1c06a584232f03367d4f004e565f\" width=\"265\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/b52563ebee31274fc15e02184a84ee985fe15802\" width=\"265\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/43c2d9df10137bb5baee4d810ecf6d886d0d4312\" width=\"265\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/aa363b9d6a5fd8c91cd4c12d72bbba1eec29fa36\" width=\"265\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Rotating ('40s) Globe\", \"Cheesy Globe VI\", \"50s Globe\", \"Earth Globe IV\"\n\nLogo: On a space background, a model globe (harkening back to the 2nd logo; still no clouds though), rotates. Superimposed onto the globe are the words \"Universal International\" (in white for B&W films or yellow-orange for color films) in a italic Roman font with \"U\" and \"I\" bigger than the rest of the letters, symbolizing Universal's merger with International Pictures.\n\nVariants: There are widescreen and color versions of the logo.\n\nByline: Later on, the credit \"EDWARD MUHL, IN CHARGE OF PRODUCTION\" would appear in the lower-left corner.\n\nClosing Variant: Same as above, but the text is \"A Universal-International Picture\".\n\nFX/SFX: The rotating globe. Compared to the previous logos, the model animation used in here is actually pretty nice.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None or the opening theme of the movie. However, on some films such as The Egg and I and The Naked City, the bell theme from the International Pictures logo is used.\n\nAvailability: Again, seen on Universal International releases of the period. Sometimes, the 13th logo would precede it on later releases of movies from the period (like the DVD release of To Kill a Mockingbird).\n\nEditor's Note: The longevity of this logo, with 18 years in use, made this a very iconic one.\n\n9th Logo\n\n(June 26, 1963-May 18, 1990)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/688dbb4042032987c8c8a2824f604a34fdc0c460\" width=\"265\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/66ba6a29b988db25459283b91b22325883c69562\" width=\"265\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/6f687664a76933763d370bcd86e2e0f3705d695f\" width=\"265\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/f2e11ebfc634637128d6c15013e0bfd9e76b6eef\" width=\"265\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/f6abb93ff0f981179cdc6ae541948926a6485e38\" width=\"265\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Zooming Globe\", \"Gaseous Globe\", \"Famous Globe\", \"MCA Globe\", \"Zooming MCA Globe\", \"Classic Globe\", \"Earth Globe V\"\n\nLogo: We zoom through space, and a pair of Van Allen radiation belts start to form. The rotating earth globe appears in the distance, and as we get closer to it, the word \"UNIVERSAL\", in a bold, planetary font (named Futura Bold), fades in close-up to us and zooms out to a comfortable distance. When the word and the globe are in position, the byline \"AN MCA COMPANY\", fades in below it, in a bold yellow font (named Eurostile Bold). Two Van Allen belts surround the globe.\n\nTrivia: The logo was animated and designed by Universal Title and Optical (commonly known as \"Universal Title\"), who was also responsible for the animation for the Universal Television logos, and handled all of the titles and optical effects for all Universal films and television series until 1990. The globe was hand painted on a rubber ball by Eyvind Earle, who also did the space background and the Van Allen belts as well.\n\nVariants: Several renditions of this logo have been discovered. This is going to get complicated, so let's explain this simply. There are many main variations of this logo:\n\n1963-1973: \"A UNIVERSAL PICTURE/RELEASE\", with the \"UNIVERSAL\" text sandwiched between \"A\" and \"PICTURE\" or \"RELEASE\". This can also be seen on newer movies that use this logo for a retro effect.\n\n\"PRESENTS\" is underneath the \"UNIVERSAL\" text. Sometimes, \"UNIVERSAL PRESENTS\" starts blurred, but becomes clearer as the globe zooms in fast. This variant is seen on movies like Secret Ceremony, The Killers (1964) and Two-Lane Backdrop.\n\n1971-1990: The byline \"AN MCA COMPANY\", in a yellow Eurostile Bold font, appearing below the \"UNIVERSAL\" text.\n\n\"Scope\": Shown in a wide ratio of 2.20:1 or 2.35:1 widescreen, the globe appears to zoom in rather slowly, and the \"UNIVERSAL\" text is blurred when it fades in, becoming clearer as it zooms out. The logo is much wider than usual, to accommodate the extra space. This is seen on films shot in this format such as High Plains Drifter, The Sugarland Express,Jaws, The Car,Halloween II and III, The Thing, Scarface, The Dark Crystal, The Last Starfighter andThey Live. It also had a bylineless variant of its own, Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here (1969) and The Day of the Jackal (1973). A sepia-tone variant can be found on The Deer Hunter.\n\n\"Flat\": Presented in 1.37:1 academy or 1:85:1 \"matted\" widescreen, the logo appears to move somewhat faster than the widescreen version. The \"UNIVERSAL\" text is not blurred, and simply fades in. Seen on films such as Coogan's Bluff, Duel,Charley Varrick,The Sentinel,An American Werewolf in London, Videodrome,Cat People (1982), Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, The Breakfast Club, Back to the Future I and II, Brazil, and Somewhere in Time. In an earlier variant, used in tandem with the normal version, \"A UNIVERSAL PICTURE\" starts blurred, but becomes clearer, along with the Edward Muhl byline. The globe zooms in faster in this variant, used on movies like Shenandoah, Send Me No Flowers, Charade and Father Goose. A B&W version of this variant can also be seen on Kitten with a Whip, which was featured on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (with the logo intact). It was also the default pan-and-scan version of the logo and plastered the above variant on older VHS copies of most, if not all, Universal films shot in scope (a notable exception being the original VHS of The Dark Crystal, which was released by Thorn EMI Video).\n\nOff-center: Only known to exist on old video prints of Charade, the logo is slightly off-center, due to a sloppy job reformatting the aspect ratio of 1:85.1 into 4:3. Another off center version can be found on the MCA Discovision, MCA Videocassette Inc. and MCA Home Video releases of Jaws.\n\nIn the early years of the \"Flat\" version of the logo, Universal had a small registered trademark symbol (®) below the \"L\" in \"UNIVERSAL,\" which faded in alongside the zooming text. By 1975, Universal added a larger ® in the same position, though it fades in after the text zooms out. However, you can still see the smaller ® behind the bigger ®.\n\nA credit for Edward Muhl, the then-head of Universal, can be seen on the lower-left of the first movies to feature this logo.\n\nThe 1971-1990 version is bylineless on some films.\n\nThe 1971-1990 version, but with \"PRESENTS\" underneath the byline in a smaller font. This was seen on American Graffti.\n\nThe widescreen version of Jaws 3-D has the MCA byline in a more extended font.\n\nThere is an end-title variation that contains the word \"RELEASE\" below the MCA byline. This was used to plaster the Paramount logo on 1980s reissue prints of Alfred Hitchcock films owned by Hitchcock himself (including Rear Window and 1956's The Man Who Knew Too Much).\n\nA black-and-white version was seen at the beginning on both 1981 MCA Videocassette, Inc. VHS release of Scarface (1932), the 1980 VHS release of Psycho, and the 1965 unsold TV pilot Dark Intruder, which got a theatrical release.\n\nThere is another scope variant where the 1.85 version is cropped to 2.35. This can be found on Coupe De Ville, Bird on a Wire,and Jaws: The Revenge. However, the GoodTimes DVD of the latter uses the regular scope variant. The cropped Scope variant also appears, in reverse, on The House with a Clock in Its Walls (more can be read about that on this company's Logo Variations page).\n\nOn most movies from 1989 and 1990, the MCA byline has more of a red orange tone to it. The Van Allen belts also have a more purple tone to them This can be found on Parenthood, Uncle Buck, Field of Dreams, Born on the Fourth of July (the VHS release), Opportunity Knocks, Coupe De Ville (which was a co-production with Morgan Creek), Bird on a Wire and the theatrical trailers for Back to the Future Part III and Problem Child (both of which used the 75th Anniversary variant of the 11th logo on the actual movies). However some movies from 1989 such as Back to the Future Part II, The Dream Team and K-9 would still use the original variant of the MCA byline. A clip of this variant was used for the Universal 75th Anniversary logo, which also used clips from the 7th and 8th logos.\n\nClosing Variants:\n\nAt the end of some films from the era. We see a blue background with the then current print logo inside a yellow circle with \"UNIVERSAL STUDIOS\" written under it. Around the yellow circle is a red ring with the following inside, \"THE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER OF THE WORLD\". Above & below it is the following, \"PRODUCED AT\" above it & \"CALIFORNIA, U.S.A\" below it. It then fades to a slide with a red bus outside of a set in Universal Studios in Hollywood. On the top left corner of the screen is the following text in yellow, \"When in Hollywood Visit Universal Studios\".\n\nA variant of this had \"(Ask for Babs)\" fade in under the text. This a reference to the 1978 comedy: National Lampoon's Animal House were one of characters named Barbara \"Babs\" Jenson becoming a tour guide at Universal Studios. Animal House director John Landis would use this variant at the end of all the movies he did for Universal. Such examples include The Blues Brothers, An American Werewolf In London (the theatrical release only. All home video releases and TV broadcasts edit it out with the exception of a 2001 VHS release) Into The Night, and Amazon Women On The Moon. If you did ask for \"Babs\", you would of likely gotten a discount or free entry to Universal Studios according to this <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2013/02/19/did-universal-studios-used-to-offer-an-incentive-based-on-a-joke-from-animal-house/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"source\">source</a>. In 1989, Universal announced that they would no longer be giving out free entries or discounts.\n\nAnother variant also lacked the \"PRODUCED AT\" & \"CALIFORNIA U.S.A\" text.\n\nFX/SFX: The rotating globe zooming-in, the Van Allen belts forming, and the \"UNIVERSAL\" text zooming out. This was very advanced for the 1960s, and its longevity is amazing, especially during the '80s, when computerized logos were making their debut.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Usually it did not have music, but it did occasionally have the opening theme of the movie. Such memorable instances include Father Goose (composed by Nelson Riddle), The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, Scarface,The Dark Crystal, and The Night Walker (both composed by Vic Mizzy). The opening tag from the latter film was also heard in abridged form on The World of Abbott and Costello. The 1972 feature length pilot of the TV series Emergency! used a dramatic, drum-driven fanfare based upon the series' theme.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nOn the U.S. DVDs of the Battlestar Galactica movie (which is really the pilot episode \"Saga of a Star World\" released as a theatrical film in Europe), the 1963 logo is heard with the CIC fanfare.\n\nOn the 1984 MCA Home Video VHS of The Man Who Knew Too Much, this logo has the Paramount VistaVision music, though it fits the logo quite well.\n\nSometimes, It even has an updated version of the 1936-1947 fanfare (composed by Jimmy McHugh).\n\nOn select foreign versions of Conan The Destroyer, the MGM lion roar is heard! That is because Universal own North American rights while MGM owns overseas rights from the control of the Dino De Laurentiis catalog. A similar occurrence happens on some foreign prints of Firestarter as well. Nevertheless, this interesting error is most likely due to sloppy plastering.\n\nOn a print of The Projected Man featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, the logo curiously uses the Les Baxter-composed fanfare from the 1960-1963 American International Pictures logo (despite the latter having nothing to do with this film's production). However, the Shout! Factory Blu-ray just use the opening theme.\n\nAvailability: Common as this was used for a total of 27 years, the longest-used logo since the classic era of movies.\n\nThis was never plastered over, except the 20th Anniversary version of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial plasters this with the E.T. 20th Anniversary variant of the 1997 Universal logo, but is still seen on the original version of said film with the 1988 and 1996 VHS releases, the theatrical DVD and Blu-ray, and HBO and Cinemax airings as well as the 2015 Nickelodeon airing.\n\nIt debuted on Charade and made its last regular appearance on Bird on a Wire.\n\nThe \"PRESENTS\" variation of the logo is seen on Silent Running and Journey to the Far Side of the Sun, followed by the \"a GERRY ANDERSON CENTURY 21 CINEMA PRODUCTION\" logo.\n\nStrangely, on Airport, this logo is seen after the end credits with the opening P.A. track for the film playing over it (pan-and-scan releases apparently had the logo and track at the start of the film, if the 1981 MCA Videocassette, Inc. release is anything to go by); a similar occurrence appeared on The Thing (without any audio; this time around, the Universal logo remains at the end even on pan-and-scan prints).\n\nThe logo is also seen on the Don Bluth/George Lucas and Steven Spielberg productions An American Tail, The Land Before Time, and the Paul Newman comedy Slap Shot. A sped-up or cut-short version was seen on a few movie trailers from 1985-1990 (including those for all 3 Back to the Future films, the last of which actually uses the 10th logo), but most went without it.\n\nNOTE: This was not seen on the following films originally: The Electric Horseman, 1941, The Blues Brothers, Torn Curtain, Family Plot, and Frenzy. The Emergency! version can be found only on the pilot episode, available as part of the season 1 DVD set. (The episode is not rerun as part of the series' syndication package.)\n\nThe original 1963 version of this logo makes a surprise appearance on the trailer for By The Sea.\n\nThe 1971-1990 logo was also retained on the 30th Anniversary theatrical re-release of Back to the Future and Back to the Future Part II, which were shown for one night only, Wednesday, October 21, 2015 in select areas.\n\nIt is unknown if this appears on any prints of Watchers.\n\nIt appeared on theatrical prints of On Golden Pond, but most video prints have this logo omitted.\n\nThe closing variant is common on VHS and laser videodisc, but extremely rare on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nIt was deleted from Jim Henson Video's VHS of The Dark Crystal, but is still intact on Sony Pictures Home Entertainment's VHS and DVD releases of the film.\n\nIt was also seen on the theatrical release and an HBO airing of The Great Muppet Caper, but all home video releases of the film delete the logo.\n\nEditor's Note: A favorite of many, thanks to its advanced (for the time) animation and longevity. In fact, it lasted 27 years, making it one of the longest running film logos."
