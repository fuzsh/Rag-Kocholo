        "text": "Laden with nonsensical dialogue and boring interludes, Submergence remains true to its unfortunately fitting title.\n\n⭐\n\nZachary Cruz-Tan\n\nSubmergence is a dull, tiresome plod through a series of events that are no doubt meant to be shocking and romantic, but simply end up resembling a dying fish flopping about on the shore. It is a joyless, merciless experience at the movies, the kind where your attention begins to stray, and you start admiring the scenery more than the actors. Its director, Wim Wenders, has made some spectacular, insightful films in his long career. This one, sadly, is thin soup.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to be worth Alicia Vikander’s and James McAvoy’s time, who star as lovers torn apart by their careers. This could have been a wonderful premise, where two lovebirds are more or less destined to be together but can’t because their jobs keep getting in the way. What we get instead is a long, drawn out, non-linear narrative in which McAvoy is constantly chained to things and Vikander gazes longingly into nothingness.\n\nMcAvoy plays James, a British intelligence agent who pit-stops at an idyllic beach resort in France before executing a mission in Somalia. Vikander is Danielle, an oceanographer who’s set to plunge into the black depths of the Atlantic. They meet at the French hotel, succumb to boneheaded dialogue (“I love the smell of sweat”) and fall madly in love, despite neither of them possessing personalities more arousing than a wet sponge.\n\nThey engage in pseudo-intellectual banter about such intrinsic and gripping subjects as the layers of the ocean, Danielle’s yellow submarine and James’ fears as a soldier, all in a witless attempt to fool us into thinking their romance is real. And then James gets caught and tortured in Somalia while Danielle prepares to submerge. Woe is them.\n\nRomance movies first have to deliver believable characters before love and heartbreak can develop between them. It’s why When Harry Met Sally (1989) remains a rom-com cornerstone. Submergence fails because its characters fail, and then it is filmed and edited to resemble a tribute montage for a funeral. The bits in Somalia are more interesting than the scenes aboard Danielle’s science vessel, but it would take a complete screenplay and editing overhaul to make us care about that as well. It’s rare to find a movie in which nothing works. This comes as close as any.\n\nSubmergence is available in Australian cinemas from August 16\n\nImage courtesy of The Backlot Films\n\nLara Croft goes back to basics in this punchy reboot starring Alicia Vikander.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nRhys Graeme-Drury\n\nIf ever there was a film series that benefited from rose-tinted glasses, it’s the original Tomb Raider duology starring Angelina Jolie; filled with pounding Euro techno, robots and riding motorbikes on the Great Wall of China, they didn’t just jump the shark, they punched said shark right in the face. I mean, who does she think she is – Mick Fanning?\n\nAnyway, what I’m trying to say is, the original Tomb Raider films weren’t exactly all that hot to begin with, which is why the arrival of this ‘gritty reboot’ (two words that should be banned from Hollywood lingo) should come as a welcome change of pace. Swapping Jolie for Academy Award-winner Alicia Vikander and giving the character the Casino Royale treatment by taking things back to basics, this reboot is solid and satisfying, if not spectacular.\n\nDrawing heavily from Square Enix’s equally graphic 2013 reboot of the videogame series, Tomb Raider sees a young and orphaned Lara Croft (Vikander) swept up in a conspiracy that involves her missing presumed dead father (Dominic West) and a shadowy organisation called Trinity. On the trail for the truth behind her father’s disappearance, Lara bounces from London to Hong Kong and the remote Japanese island of Yamatai, where resides an ancient witch called Himiko, or so legend has it.\n\nAlthough some of the game has been stripped away (gone are characters like Jonah, Roth and Sam), the basic premise and underlying tone is there. Norwegian director Roar Uthaug doesn’t pull his punches, with Lara dealt a series of gut-wrenching situations that are a far cry from Jolie’s dizzying Matrix-esque kicks and flips. Alone and hunted by a band of mercenaries, it’s ugly and painful when Lara is forced to kill for the first time – and Vikander really sells this vulnerability and grim determination.\n\nThat said, Tomb Raider still struggles to excel and rise above standard genre fare territory; the action is murky and chopped to pieces, the CGI is patchy and Tom Holkenborg’s score doesn’t afford this iteration of the character any potent or memorable motifs. Worst of all, its supporting cast is bland as anything; the likes of Daniel Wu, Nick Frost and Kristin Scott Thomas are unreservedly wasted.\n\nDoes Tomb Raider qualify as a quote/unquote intellectual movie? No, of course not – what were you expecting? It’s a Tomb Raider movie. It exists for the sole purpose of pitching a perky English heiress with dual pistols against dusty crypts, death traps and ancient curses. So in that regard, it sets out to fulfil more or less what it should, which is to be a diverting and entertaining two-hour adventure populated with all of the above.\n\nIt’s far from perfect, but it’s a marked step up; bloody and muddy, I’d be more than happy to step into the ring for a second round with Vikander’s steely take on this videogame icon.\n\nTomb Raider is available in Australian cinemas from March 15\n\nImage courtesy of Roadshow Films\n\nTulip Fever burns slower than it takes for a tulip to grow and bloom.\n\n⭐\n\nElle Cahill\n\nIt’s 17th Century Amsterdam and a wealthy Dutchman, Cornelis Sandvoort and his wife, Sophia, are having trouble conceiving. Despite the young wife’s fears that her much older husband will soon divorce her, he pays for up-and-coming artist Jan van Loos to paint their portrait. As he paints the couple, van Loos quickly falls in love with the young Sophia and they start a passionate affair.\n\nThere is a lot going on in Tulip Fever, and for the most part it’s hard to keep up with all the different storylines. For almost every character that is introduced in the film, we are given a sliver of their story without any real development, both from a story and character perspective. I counted a total of seven storylines, which is too big a number to fit into a 105-minute film, particularly when the film is also trying to set up the historical backdrop of the tulip mania that took over Amsterdam in the 17th Century, and plays a large part in the overall story.\n\nTulip Fever has a phenomenal cast including Judi Dench, Christoph Waltz, Alicia Vikander, Tom Hollander, Jack O’Connell, and many more, but director Justin Chadwick fails to utilise their full potential. Dench effortlessly steals every scene she’s in as the head nun of a local parish in charge of growing the tulips for auction, as does Waltz in his portrayal of husband Cornelis Sandvoort, who genuinely loves Sophia (Vikander) and wants to do right by her but is desperate for her to deliver an heir. Hollander also get’s an honourable mention as the sleazy doctor who brings moments of comic relief to an otherwise contrived plot. But this is far from being their best work and feels like a huge waste of talent.\n\nThe most interesting part of the film is its attempt at exploring the tulip mania. While it fails to truly show the significance of the mania, it helps establish the film’s setting, and also give a basic insight to the craze that overtook Amsterdam. Unfortunately, like the rest of the film, it gets muddled up with all the concurrent character arcs and fails to bring anything other than tulips to the story.\n\nThere is some beautiful cinematography by Eigil Bryld, particularly when Sophia’s on the beach at various points in the film, but most of the time these scenes feel overly indulgent.\n\nTulip Fever is a real slow-burner that has a lot going on across the various storylines without any proper development taking place. Its failure to pick a central character leaves you feeling confused at the end, as you’re not invested in any of them. I also can’t tell you who or what the antagonist is in this film because it’s never properly identified. This film should serve as a warning as to what happens when indulgence trumps quality.\n\nTulip Fever is available in Australian cinemas from November 23.\n\nImage courtesy of Roadshow Films 2017.\n\nThe austere beauty of the visuals and the quiet strength of the performances are at times overwhelmed by the predictable melodrama at the centre of the film.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nCharlie Lewis\n\nWith his rugged jawline and haunted, piercing eyes, Michael Fassbender was born to be filmed looking pensively out to sea. It is a talent that Derek Cianfrance’s sweeping tear jerker The Light Between Oceans (based on M.L Stedman’s novel) regularly calls upon.\n\nFassbender plays Tom Sherbourne, a WWI veteran who takes a job as a lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock off the coast of Western Australia. The purposeful solitude of this role is all he wants after the horrors of the Western Front. When he is forced to talk to other people, he is terse and quiet, until the person he’s talking to is Isabel (Alicia Vikander), a local girl who punctures Sherbourne’s world like a sunbeam through overcast skies. The pair eventually marry and after their initial idyll, fate imposes more hardship and loss on two people who have had enough of both to fill several lifetimes.\n\nThe early sequences in The Light Between Oceans are lyrical and affecting, particularly as Tom and Isabel fall for one another; their chemistry glows against the perpetual gloom of the island’s austere terrain. Tom’s self-loathing survivor’s guilt and Isabel’s determination to create something better for them drive the most consequential moments of the film.\n\nBut as the misfortune and cruelty pile up, the film severs the connection between us and the characters. They gradually cease being the recognisable humans we fell in love with, and become silent targets for punishment. By the time the film snaps back into focus, the damage is done. The distancing is furthered by the casting. I welcome the peppering of Australian character actors (Garry McDonald, Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown) and I understand, without approving of, the decision to cast three non-Australian’s in the biggest roles, but the combination is distracting.\n\nStill, for all its broad melodrama and unmistakable Oscar bait tendencies, The Light between Oceans delivers stirring imagery and giddy yet understated romance early on.\n\nThe Light Between Oceans is available in Australian cinemas from November 3\n\nImage courtesy of eOne Films\n\nTom Munday\n\nHollywood’s night of nights, the 88th Academy Awards, did exactly what it needed to do. Avoiding any major fluffs, offensive slip-ups, or John Travolta appearances, this year’s ceremony said what we were all thinking. In an awards season of diversity issues, upsets, and Ricky Gervais’ antics, the show was, at the very least, not completely embarrassing or rote.\n\nComedian Chris Rock, the perfect host in light of the recent controversies, refused to pull his punches. Refusing to rehearse his set before the event, Rock let loose on white privilege and the lack of care for minority performers in tinsel-town. Pulling out all the stops, the comic made his high-end audience uncomfortable with gags referencing rape, lynching, protests, and stereotypes. Referring to Hollywood’s particular form of racism and misogyny, his opening monologue ended with a witty retort about the ‘Ask Her More’ campaign.\n\nUnlike preceding Oscar ceremonies, this year’s event had a brash, hyperkinetic sense of humour. Rock’s hand in the writing stage paid off, with several gags balancing between necessary and inappropriate. Despite the perfunctory ‘2015 in Film’ montage introducing the show, its skits let many acclaimed performers let their guards down. One skit, inserting African-American actors Whoopi Goldberg, Tracy Morgan, and Leslie Jones into nominated features, was a standout moment.\n\nThe night was packed with easy-to-predict winners, well-deserved honours for technical achievement, and jaw-dropping surprises. Deservedly so, Spotlight picked up Best Original Screenplay for its brutal, electrifying dissection of this century’s biggest journalistic endeavour. However, The Big Short’s concoction of convoluted, Wall Street jargon unfairly picked up Best Adapted Screenplay over four more-deserving nominees.\n\nThe acting gongs became an entertaining mix; acting titan/supermodel wrangler/environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, after five preceding nominations, finally picked up his first Oscar for his grizzly, near-wordless turn in The Revenant. After a standing ovation, the 41-year-old megastar launched into a romantic speech about a life in cinema and our lives in the midst of climate change.\n\nBrie Larson’s captivating performance in Room earned her the Best Actress statuette. Shockingly, despite a solid subdued performance in Bridge of Spies, Mark Rylance beat out crowd-favourite Sylvester Stallone for Best Supporting Actor. Overcoming The Danish Girl’s shoddiness, 27-year-old Alicia Vikander pipped Kate Winslet to the post for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThis year’s ceremony, although more refined and impactful than previous shows, proved the Academy needs its own multi-million-dollar reboot. Highlighting the overwhelming political overtones, Sam Smith’s lacklustre Bond theme, Writing’s on the Wall, won best Original Song, proving just how useless that category is. Seriously, get rid of Best Original Song for something substantial like stunt coordination or casting! Even Vice President Joe Biden couldn’t help Lady Gaga get her song’s message across.\n\nOur film industry stole the night, with the highest number of Australian nominees and winners per event. Mad Max: Fury Road pulled off a miracle, turning from troubled production to one of the most critically and commercially viable blockbusters in history. The film swept the technical awards, collecting six trophies including Production Design, Costume Design, and Editing. Its recipients screeched and drawled into the microphone in true Ocker fashion, perplexing their American counterparts.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, the biggest awards came and went without surprise. Inside Out and Son of Saul showed no sign of slowing down in the Best Animated Feature and Best Foreign Film slots respectively. For the second consecutive year, Alejandro G. Inarritu picked up Best Directing for the squalid, visceral thrills and harsh production conditions The Revenant has become notorious for. Spotlight, by far the best of a mixed bunch, scooped Best Picture away from the favourites.\n\nThe finale – with Rock, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Keaton eating Girl Scout cookies on the world’s grandest stage – made for a more human moment than anything the eight film nominees had delivered.\n\nFull List of Winners\n\nBest Picture\n\nSpotlight\n\nBest Director\n\nAlejandro G.

Alicia Vikander was the ‘it’ girl of 2015, starring in almost every second film to critical acclaim. The 26-year-old actress’ career trajectory has taken turns most performers could only dream of; working under esteemed directors and alongside A-list acting royalty over just a couple of years.\n\nLike fellow 20-something stars including Jennifer Lawrence, this Swedish actress takes chances, throws herself into many confronting situations, and has never been afraid of the spotlight. She is already Hollywood’s most accomplished actress under 30, with a grace and presence different to any blonde bombshell, action-badass archetype, or Keira Knightley/period-piece type.\n\nIn the early 2010s, two films, A Royal Affair and Anna Karenina, showcased Vikander’s raw tenacity and talents in a limited space of time. The actress, learning Danish over two months and immersing herself in the main cast and crew to perfect her dialect for the first of these two films, wished to become a part of the production more so than standing out as the ‘talent’.\n\nPlaced on the BAFTA shortlist after A Royal Affair, the actress outlined an all-star cast in Joe Wright’s re-imagining of the Leo Tostoy classic. Playing naïve lovebird Kitty, the actress overshadowed Keira Knightley in her first English-language project. Vikander’s momentum continued to pick up steam, starring in key roles in docudrama The Fifth Estate and war-drama Testament of Youth. Opposite everyone from Benedict Cumberbatch to Bill Condon, her on-screen presence has become difficult to ignore.\n\nHer performances in three 2015 films, in particular, showcase her phenomenal range, charm, and respect for the craft. Her most-talked-about role is as human-esque cyborg Ava in Ex Machina. British writer/director Alex Garland’s sci-fi flick provided Vikander with one of the year’s most challenging and thought-provoking roles. Thanks to phenomenal visual effects, along with co-stars Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac, she portrays a soft, delicate balance between human and machine.\n\nIn contrast, her role in spy flick The Man from U.N.C.L.E. took a swift turn from her preceding roles in dramas and think-pieces. Stealing scenery from Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, her character is a potent mix of boisterous and determined. Throughout the film, her endearing charisma elevates the familiar material. Her dramatic and comedic sides harmonise with the film’s light-hearted tone.\n\nMost recently, her Oscar-nominated performance in The Danish Girl proved she could overcome being the best thing in a polarising film. Eclipsing Oscar-winning leading man Eddie Redmayne, Vikander portrays her real-life character with subtlety and punch. Her character, forced to watch her husband transition from male to female over several decades, is a tough, relentless role for any actress. Peppering the overwhelming dramatic moments with touches of humour and sarcasm, she comes into her own throughout the film’s confronting journey.\n\nVikander’s run of projects of varying genres, scopes, and pedigrees is only growing stronger. Upcoming Australian drama The Light Between Oceans sees her star opposite real-life partner, and fellow A-lister, Michael Fassbender. Tulip Fever will push her into a different stratosphere, playing opposite veteran acting titans Judi Dench and Christoph Waltz. She will then star opposite Matt Damon in the 5th Bourne flick.\n\nImages courtesy of Universal Pictures\n\nTo kick off the new year with a bang – and force ourselves to forget the terrible films we discussed in our last post – we’ve decided to now celebrate the greatest films of 2015. It was a long and arduous process to be able to bring you this list. We underwent a battle of wits; challenging one another with our varying opinions. We debated. We squabbled. Blood and tears were spilled (well, sort of… not really…) but we came through in the end to bring you the top 10 films of 2015 as voted by the Hooked On Film team. Enjoy!\n\n10. Ex Machina\n\nMaybe Oscar Isaac is the key to a successful Sci-Fi these days?\n\n“Ex Machina’s underlying intensity builds throughout the crackling keep-you-guessing narrative. Divided up via “Ava: Session…” titles, Garland’s taste for hyper-violence and psychosexuality hurls the audience into a twisted vision of the not-too distant future”. Read more\n\n9. Youth\n\nPaolo Sorrentino + Michael Caine + Harvey Keitel… do I really need to say anymore?\n\n“Others who can put up with darkly blunt revelations and sudden jumps between dream-like imagery and reality are in for an enormously rewarding experience, one that will perhaps cause them to look again at themselves and their own family – from the young to the old”. Read more\n\n8. 99 Homes\n\nAndrew Garfield may have 99 problems in 99 Homes, but his performance ain’t one!\n\n“99 Homes is so unrelentingly intense and scary that it could almost be labelled a horror movie. But this is a film grounded in reality, and perhaps the first to give us an honest look at the heartbreaking emotional turmoil that encompasses eviction.” Read more\n\n7. Selma\n\nIt don’t matter if you’re black or white.\n\n“David Oyelowo, a devout Christian, stated in an interview that he believes God called upon him to play Martin Luther King, Jr. Even non-believers will have a difficult time debating this after witnessing the actor ignite the screen”. Read more\n\n6. Sicario\n\nPrepare yourself for chills and thrills!\n\n“Sicario soon rumbles along with the tenacity and mercilessness of its core subjects. With the US Presidential election and US-Mexico relations key to world news, the film provides a fresh, blistering take on such a harrowing topic.” Read more\n\n5. Inside Out\n\nIt’s OK to be sad sometimes, but you’ll be feeling anything BUT sad after watching this!\n\n“Disney and Pixar have outdone themselves with this beautiful new idea that expresses how the mind works, and how personalities develop through memories and emotions. As Amy Poehler said; it’s so great to have a story tell children that it’s OK to feel sad sometimes, particularly in a world where all are so busy in the pursuit of happiness.” Read more\n\n4. Birdman\n\n“People, they love blood. They love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical bullshit” says the Birdman… well, this film begs to differ!\n\n“Birdman is a rare delight of a film that works on every level. Multilayered and incredibly complex beneath its darkly humorous surface, it represents a departure from the gloomy tone of Iñárritu’s previous films (21 Grams, Biutiful).Read more\n\n3. Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nIt’s a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world… and it’s awesome!\n\n“As our heroes are pursued further into the barren deserts, Miller unleashes the full extent of his imagination in a series of astounding action scenes that transcend our expectations for modern filmmaking. Fury Road is a symphony of mayhem that effortlessly dances across the screen”.\n\nRead more\n\n2. The Martian\n\nSuck on this Interstellar. Ridley Scott > Christopher Nolan.\n\n“Every line in this film’s script radiates with wit, and Damon’s character in particular is given some hilarious quips to overcome his unbearable loneliness.

They are immensely interesting individuals who share on-screen chemistry, and have set up personal stories that are more than capable of going the distance of a trilogy.” Read more\n\nImages courtesy of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Lucasfilm, Roadshow Films, Pixar Animations, Twentieth Century Fox, Madman Entertainment, Universal Pictures and StudioCanal\n\nKGB agents! Femme fatales! Exotic locations! Yes, it’s back to the sixties for some Cold War-era spy nostalgia in Guy Ritchie’s ode to the suave styles and erotic thrills that defined the secret agent genre.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nCorey Hogan\n\nDespite the brilliance of the most recent, reinvented James Bond films, it must be said that amidst the darker, grittier tone and heavier emotional complexities, 007 has lost that sense of espionage fun he once embodied. But while Bond has fallen and risen and resuscitated himself over the past twenty years, another spy caper with roots in the sixties has struggled to escape the cold clutches of development hell and see the light of day. Based on the TV series of the same name, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. has been through more than a dozen script changes, several directors (including Quentin Tarantino, Matthew Vaughn and Steven Soderbergh) and had just about every Hollywood leading man attached to it at some point – from Ryan Gosling to Bradley Cooper to Tom Cruise, and many more. At long last it lives, thanks to cockney gangster king Guy Ritchie (Snatch, RocknRolla), and pleasantly defies expectations of any film lost on the movie-making blacklist for so long.\n\nTaking us back to that simpler period of early-60’s Cold War, two agents – the American Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and the Russian Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) face off as they hunt down Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), the daughter of a missing German scientist for the CIA and KGB respectively. After nearly killing each other, Solo and Kuryakin are instructed to work together as agents for U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) on a mission to infiltrate, and stop a covert criminal organisation led by femme fatale Victoria Vinciguerra (Elizabeth Debicki) before her plan to destabilize the international power balance by means of nuclear weapons is executed.\n\nThere is something so very refreshing to this delightfully breezy and retro through-and-through escapade; no dark, sombre themes, no social commentary, no overload of flashy visual effects – the scope is smartly kept intimate, offering a light-hearted and pure experience that brings to mind the Sean Connery-era Bond films (no surprise, since 007 author Ian Fleming was involved in the original U.N.C.L.E.’s conception).\n\nStrands of Guy Ritchie’s early works pop up throughout, particularly during the often hilarious action scenes (Solo’s outrageous rescue of Kuryakin while helping himself to a gourmet Italian sandwich is a show-stopper), though overall this is closer in tone to his Sherlock Holmes films, matching mystery sleuthing with a dynamic pair’s witty banter and chemistry. Hammer’s Kuryakin is the straight man to Cavill’s wise-cracking Solo, an original odd couple upon which the film structures and stabilises itself to great effect – anytime the duo is onscreen amuses; particularly when they infiltrate an enemy base together, each using their own preferred methods and scoffing at the other’s. But equally entertaining is love interest Gaby Teller, brought to life by 2015’s breakout starlet Alicia Vikander; subtly sexy and incredibly amusing as she and Kuryakin go undercover as fiancés. Props to Hugh Grant too as the head of U.N.C.L.E., definitely showing his age but proving his charm hasn’t faded.\n\nAny complaints can be directed towards the story itself, playing second-fiddle to the slick style and enticing character charms. It is serviceable, with a number of double and triple-crosses and twists keeping our spies bounding from one sizzling set piece to the next, but is rather pedestrian, and winds up leaving the film a little forgettable. Nonetheless, this is the antidote to the bleak, overstuffed blockbuster fair of late – U.N.C.L.E. is accessibly paced, hugely likeable and witty, and above all enormously entertaining; the resurgence of the spy flick is more than welcome.\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E is available in Australian cinemas from Thursday 13 August\n\nImages courtesy of Warner Bros / Roadshow Films\n\nSmart, scintillating, and scary – Ex Machina is one of the most discomforting and intelligent films of 2015 so far.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nReview by Tom Munday\n\nIn Ex Machina, typical office drone Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a week of pristine luxury with his company’s charismatic, game-changing CEO Nathan (Oscar Isaac) at his tantalising abode in the middle of nowhere. The dynamic, however, is tested after Caleb is tasked with communicating, via Turing Test, with a humanoid Artificial Intelligence being named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Surrounded by Nathan’s peculiar assistant Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), Caleb, Nathan, and Ava become embroiled in each other’s psyches.\n\nWriter/director Alex Garland, no stranger to ambitious genre cinema thanks to 28 Days Later and Dredd, has constructed a thought-provoking and impactful sci-fi-thriller with a twist, or ten. Made for just $13 million, Garland and co. efficiently turn Nathan’s uber-modernised home/research facility into a dangerous, labyrinthine maze. The facility’s polished, futuristic aesthetic crafts a balance between original vision and derivative touches. In the vein of Stanley Kubrick, Christopher Nolan, and Danny Boyle, Garland’s eerie, atmospheric style welds you to the seat throughout its appropriate 108-minute run-time. The transition from awe-inspiring to discomforting separates Garland’s work from that of any bigger name. Thankfully, light comedic reprieves come thick and fast; Nathan and Kyoko’s dance number is weird, wacky, and wonderful.\n\nEx Machina’s underlying intensity builds throughout the crackling keep-you-guessing narrative. Divided up via “Ava: Session…” titles, Garland’s taste for hyper-violence and psychosexuality hurls the audience into a twisted vision of the not-too distant future. Acclaimed cinematographer Rob Hardy captures Nathan’s enviable Scandinavian surroundings immaculately. Like similar Garland-Driven vehicles (Sunshine and The Beach, in particular), paranoia and deception become powerful weapons in the hands of his sniveling, irritable subjects. Testing his characters and audience, Ex Machina strives at subverting and criticizing blockbuster conventions. It proves less really is more.\n\nThis sci-fi thriller, despite its overwhelming technical accomplishments, only plunges into the shallow depths of its thematic allure. Juggling Artificial Intelligence and social networking amongst other monolithic topics, its top-heavy introspection merely says what we are already thinking. Sadly, like most recent, similar sci-fi flicks, it fails to craft new perspectives or concepts. Its insight into human interaction and pornographic titillation, cynically points the finger without reason. Conversations between Caleb and Nathan thrust the techno-fear messages front and centre. In addition, the third act is a head-scratcher for right and wrong reasons.\n\nThe central trio brings gravitas and charm to this cold, distant Twilight Zone-like tale. Gleeson, son of character-actor Brendan, fuses innocence and sliminess throughout his intriguing lead role. Coming off About Time and Unbroken, this flick might just hurl him into the A-list stratosphere. Gleeson and Isaac, though fitting into familiar roles, convincingly play off one another. Isaac’s raw charisma elevates his moustache-twirling villain character. Vikander also steps into the spotlight with an immeasurable performance, capturing many jaw-dropping ticks and mannerisms. Her character’s signature look, complete with mesh-like torso and intricate circuits, accentuates the movie’s taste for originality and detail.\n\nDespite its minor flaws, Ex Machina’s attention to detail, interesting characters, and glorious style elevate it above recent sci-fi schlockers (Jupiter Ascending, Chappie). This sci-fi thriller, unlike many, is not afraid to tackle the past, present, and future simultaneously.

Instead, James Kent’s deeply moving direction couples with some breakout performances to make for one of the more poignant wartime tales in recent years, arriving just over a century on from the outbreak of the Great War.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nReview by Rhys Graeme-Drury\n\nTestament of Youth is a coming-of-age tale in which renowned 20th century pacifist Vera Brittain (Alicia Vikander) finds her place in the world as war rips her family, and future apart. With her brothers (Taron Egerton, Colin Morgan), and the love of her life (Kit Harrington) sent into the fight against Germany, Vera finds herself torn between becoming an educated writer, and suffragette at Oxford, or following her family onto the frontline as a nurse.\n\nI found that this film worked really well as both an absorbing biopic, and an emotive war piece. Sometimes this concept works really well, such as in The Imitation Game, and other times the two separate halves can lose their way; Unbroken and American Sniper are prime examples. Thankfully, Testament of Youth falls firmly into the former category; as the film tears our two baby-faced protagonists from one another, we’re not just compelled to learn more about Vera Brittain as a person, but also to follow her, and the supporting characters onto the battlefield.\n\nFurthermore, the film is able to carry out something that I found quite remarkable; it succeeds in conveying the horror of war without firing a single bullet or landing a single shell. Instead, we view the terror unfolding in France through Vera’s eyes. It’s an unsettling approach where we never directly bear witness to the chaos of battle, and are only subjected to the charred, decimated aftermath where Vera, and the hundreds of nurses around her are left to pick up the pieces.\n\nIt’s a creative decision that pays off enormously; not only are we left with an impactful, thought-provoking film that doesn’t trade substance for style, but one that also thematically builds towards establishing Vera as the renowned pacifist she is known as today. We get to see her character arc unfold throughout the film in a way that feels natural and logical.\n\nBy shielding the audience from the battle itself, Kent is able to maintain a firm focus on Vera, and how she develops from a naïve young girl for whom war is synonymous with glory, to a more mature, weary woman who realises she should have known better.\n\nAnchoring the film is a stirring and assured performance from rising star Alicia Vikander. Testament of Youth is the Swede’s biggest credit to date since appearing in Aussie crime drama Son of a Gun last year, and she grabs the opportunity by the horns, and rides it for all its worth. Her performance really captures the mental strain of being surrounded by death and sorrow. Expect to see much more of Vikander in the coming year; a starring role in Alex Garland’s provocative Ex Machina is already receiving rave reviews, and she’ll also crop up in Guy Ritchie’s 60’s spy thriller The Man From U.N.C.L.E this August.\n\nHarrington, Egerton and Morgan provide fantastic support as the trio of Edwardian gents who trip over themselves to serve king and country, only to find war isn’t all glory and medals. Harrington’s subtle acting style personifies this sense of shock and awe the threesome face.\n\nTestament of Youth is an understated and harrowing account of war that, as its title suggests, has something to say about that fateful generation over a century ago who rushed headlong into battle, only to emerge shaken on the other side. Similarly, don’t expect to emerge from this film without feeling a little stunned yourself. Four stars.\n\nTestament of Youth is available in Australian cinemas as of Thursday 23rd April\n\nImages courtesy of Transmission Films"
