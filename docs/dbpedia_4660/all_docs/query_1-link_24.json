        "text": "Ex Machina\n\nFilm 4 Productions, DNA Films, A24, Universal Pictures\n\nEx Machina, a sci-fi movie from 2015, was written and directed by Alex Garland, who also wrote 28 Days Later and Dredd. Having interesting ties to the new Star Wars movie, with both casting Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson, Ex Machina doesn’t have very many actors in it at all, with basically three main players, and one supporting character. It’s the story of Caleb, played by Gleeson, who “wins” a contest to go to the compound of Oscar Isaac’s character, Nathan, who is an eccentric techie billionaire with a secret to share. That secret is that he has created Artificial Intelligence. Our own Noodlethedoodle and Bigmattress have a conversation about this unique movie.\n\n!Spoilers abound!\n\nBigmattress\n\nEx Machina was probably my most pleasant cinematic surprise from the last year. Not that I didn’t hear good things; I did, from our own Noodlethedoodle, but I wasn’t expecting it to be THIS good. I’d even say it’s great.\n\nThe scale of the movie was the first thing I noticed. It’s basically three or four people in a basement, having conversations. That’s it. And really, that’s all you need when it’s done as well as it is here. In this movie the dialogue is pretty much it, rounding out the characters, the story, and giving us a reason to become involved mentally and emotionally. The actors are great, don’t get me wrong, we”ll get to that, but to me it’s wonderful how simple the execution was.\n\nNoodle, what were your first impressions of Ex Machina? Should we talk about the dance scene?\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nNo. Thinking about this movie as a whole, I am struck by how claustrophobic it was. Caleb at work in his cubicle, Caleb in a helicopter, Caleb in Nathan’s lair. Nathan clearly is not a man who wants an open floor plan for his mad scientist doings. I know I’m not the first person to notice this, but I also thought the stark contrast between Caleb and Nathan’s moral centers was made obvious by their physical contrasts. Caleb: doughy, pale, and gentle, versus Nathan: muscular, swarthy, and aggressive.\n\nI’d seen Domhnall Gleeson in Dredd (great movie, everyone should see it, go do it right now then come back and finish reading this), but I’d never seen Oscar Isaac in anything (yes it is nice under this rock, thanks for asking). I will sheepishly admit that I spent the first half of the movie amazed at David Krumholtz‘s acting, much improved since I’d last seen him in Numbers and 10 Things I Hate About You, before finally checking IMDB and learning Oscar Isaac’s name.\n\nBigmattress\n\nGreat call! That’s something I didn’t pick up on while watching it; the physical difference between Caleb and Nathan. I did notice how they made it a point to show Nathan working out, and I wondered if it was a way to establish his dominant personality, but I didn’t pick up on the comparison between the two. Nathan was just an intimidating dude, and not just physically. He was always steering the conversation away from where he didn’t want it to go, sometimes to frustrating or comical effect. The dude is OBVIOUSLY up to something, and I think Caleb definitely picked up on it, but he was powerless for most of the movie to take control of anything.\n\nAnd Alicia Vikander, my goodness. My goodness. I’d not seen her in anything before this, but she is amazing. The vulnerability, the wickedness, the eagerness to learn…she displayed all these things with her eyes. I do want to go in depth into her sessions with Caleb, but what were your thoughts on Ms. Vikander? Or do you want to talk about the dance scene now?\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nNo, I don’t. I had never heard of Alicia Vikander at all before this movie. She was a complete unknown, which I think only helped. I’m used to seeing and accepting actors in all sorts of different roles (well, not Jason Statham, that guy seriously has one character in all his movies), but this time I didn’t have to, which was okay with me. Back to Alicia Vikander – she was amazing. I can’t imagine that anybody could have done a better job – you can totally see why Caleb was so smitten with her. The way she could convey so much just by changing the angle of her head was unreal.\n\nAs to her appearance (the CGI was seamless), I’m sure Nathan had her obviously looking like a robot (android? fembot?) so that Caleb wouldn’t be embarrassed. Can you imagine if Ava had been totally nude – how uncomfortable Caleb would have been with that? I’m cringing just thinking of it. Now Nathan wasn’t afraid to make a bunch of naked lady robots to keep himself company, but Nathan obviously didn’t deny himself anything. Again, more contrast between the two men.\n\nAva’s appearance also made the test harder – could Caleb forget that she was a machine even though she looked like one? Nathan was so arrogant about his genius and his creation that he obviously thought that Caleb would.\n\nBigmattress\n\nAwesome, awesome points. Let’s get to the sessions. These are maybe the key to the whole “all you need is great dialogue” stance I have toward this movie and others like it. It’s an actual conversation between two characters, but it goes deeper than that, especially as the movie goes on. The seeds of doubt that get planted, not only by Nathan, but by Caleb’s growing infatuation with Ava, eventually left me wondering what, if anything, coming out of Ava’s mouth was true. But that’s not the way I felt during the first session. The first session was all discovery and wide-eyed willingness to go along with the test. It’s only later that the undercurrent of the sessions was Ava collecting information, or data, to devise a plan to not only get the heck away from Nathan, but to experience the real world.\n\nAnd the way the sessions were shot were indicative of the underlying issues, and the progression of doubt within Caleb, and the control Ava was exerting over him. Caleb goes to see Ava in her “room”, which makes us feel like Nathan has her on display like an animal in a zoo, but the way the scene is shot makes it seem like Caleb is actually the one in a box, where he has no room to move around, and Ava has a lot of space to pace back and forth, almost like a lion stalking her prey, which is exactly what she’s doing. But we don’t find that out until later. Throughout the sessions the struggle for dominance is conveyed with the framing, and it almost seems like Ava is manipulating this dominance to get what she needs from Caleb. When she needs to seem like a submissive innocent, she grabs a seat. When she needs to exert her power, we get a low angle shot of her lording over Caleb in the scene.\n\nWhat were your thoughts on the sessions? What about the dance scene?\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nI don’t want to talk about the dance scene. The sessions were gripping. Caleb was invested from the start and would have happily sat and talked with Ava forever. Ava was like a blank slate with her odd way of moving (she managed to be both robotic and incredibly graceful at the same time) and beautiful, expressionless face. I knew it was a movie and that there was a human actress in there, but I couldn’t take my eyes off her either.\n\nI agree that it was perfect how Caleb thought she was in the cage when clearly he was (that tiny glass room – he was like a lonely orchid in there). When Ava was picking out her clothing I wondered why somebody like Nathan would buy her such girlish items (all small prints and fuzzy sweaters), but later realized that naturally he would make her as unthreatening as possible. It goes back to how Ava was the only AI who wasn’t naked – Caleb wouldn’t have been able to deal with it. Can you imagine if Ava’s closet had contained halter dresses and sexy heels? Dress her like she’s going to the club and put a long tousled wig on her (instead of that Raquel Welch Collection one she had) and Caleb would have been struck dumb and completely unable to talk with her.\n\nBigmattress\n\nVERY interesting, the points you’re making about her wardrobe. I had thought about Ava being “nude” and how that would have affected Caleb. And now, looking back, the only time we do see her nude was when she was “gearing up” for the world, stealing skin from other robots and placing them over her own robotic parts.\n\nBut I never thought about her wardrobe as anything more than a way to cover her robot parts in an effort to humanize herself for Caleb. I did notice her wig selection when she dresses up for Caleb. She intentionally passes by the long hair, the blonde, the black, and goes for the innocent pixie cut in an effort to look innocent and submissive. And at first I thought this was Nathan at work, going with Caleb’s porn tastes, as is later hinted, but this is Ava at work. And then later, when she goes out into the world, she grabs the long hair, ready to assert her dominance having freed herself.But I never considered the prints and fuzzy sweater and all that, the details of her clothes and what they stand for. They were very wholesome in appearance in an effort to keep Caleb on task or to maybe mislead the viewers into seeing her as more innocent than conniving. And yeah, sexy heels and halter tops would have made for a very uncomfortable viewer and Caleb. Poor Kyoko had nothing to wear but impossibly short skirts and stiletto heels. Very uncomfortable stuff for a maid to wear.\n\nAlso, Nathan keeping Ava robotic when he had all his previous models “nude”, which we see when Caleb snoops in his archived video files, tells me that Nathan was taking extra effort to keep her from seeming too feminine or human, at least at first, to Caleb. Based on Nathan’s sessions with his previous models, Caleb should have been talking to Ava as she sat there starkers.\n\nGreat, great stuff! And how about that dance scene?\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nKyoko! She was fascinating to me, both before and after I knew what she was. I’m unfamiliar with that actress, but she seriously did so much without saying a word. Still waters and all that.\n\nShe was the only supporting character in this movie. Nathan was the Creator, Eva was the creation, and Caleb was the poor schlub drawn into it all. I obviously have a lot of feelings toward Caleb, mostly pity. He could not have been more sympathetic and sad, which made Eva’s betrayal (and of course Nathan’s, without whom none of this existed) that much harsher.\n\nBigmattress\n\nKyoko…that actress whose name is…*googling*…Sonoya Mizuno, WAS great! And this is only her second credited role! And that character brings up many more things about Nathan. The first time I saw her, I thought to myself: “She’s a robot and she’s created to bring sexuality to Nathan’s world”, and I think I happened to be right on that one. Like I said, stilettos and tiny skirts aren’t ideal garb for a maid, I would think. I don’t know.\n\nAnd then we see Nathan getting busy with her, and I was all “Maybe not”, but then when she pulled her face off for Caleb, I realized I was right and really wished I wasn’t. Creating a sentient being strictly for the purpose to serve him in any way he can think of (including dance routines) is one of Caleb’s ickier points. Dude has issues. But dancing isn’t one of them, am I right?\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nI had no idea that Kyoko was an AI. I thought the twist would be that she really DID speak English and was conspiring against Nathan the whole time. I mean, how on earth can you guarantee that somebody doesn’t speak a language? By building them from scratch, that’s how. I thought he was a big creep who was mean to her (I stand by my assessment of his character).\n\nI read an interesting conversation about Nathan and his ‘pleasure bots’ (by the way, ewwwwwww). The argument was that they were machines, just like a toaster or car, and his to do what he wanted with them. That is a valid point, but the fact that he went to great lengths to make these machines look like extremely attractive, completely realistic women is the icky part. If his AI’s looked more like toasters I’d be less offended by his various uses of them – dancing included.\n\nBigmattress\n\nAnd even though it’s a valid point that they are his creations, like a toaster or whatever, the fact that he’s striving to make them as real as possible, while also making them impossibly good looking AND having to submit to his every whim (eww is right), that just makes it extra creepy, for more than just making them attractive, in my opinion. If they looked like toasters, sure, who cares what you do to them, and if you’re going to make sex bots, well, yeah, make them hot. But to work so hard toward making them sentient…THAT is the issue I take with Nathan’s fembots.\n\nMike Mousseau sent some opinions to me about Ex Machina, and I don’t know if he thought of them himself or came across them somewhere. If I knew where credit was due, I’d give it, because I didn’t think of these points, I only wish to bring them to light.\n\n1. The locked doors. The easy and obvious prediction is that one of them, either Ava, Nathan or Caleb, will get locked in by them at some point. The twist we think we see coming as the movie progresses, and from one of their “secret” conversations, is that Caleb will hack the locks and get Ava out after she triggers them. The REAL twist, the thing that actually happens, that I feel just about NO ONE could have seen coming, was that Ava simply kills Nathan, with the help of Kyoko, and locks Caleb in, after getting him to help her.\n\n2. Kyoko doesn’t speak English, so we start to assume that she’s an AI, too. Bu it can’t be so simple that she’s simply a non-English speaking house girl, right? Especially when we see Nathan having his way with her. She must be an AI, too. But that’s the easy call, like you said. There’s got to be something else there, like your thought that maybe she really did speak English and was plotting with Ava. Then we see that she’s just one of many sexually convenient (icky poo) AI’s that Nathan keeps around for shits and gigs. The real twist, is that she gets pretty much destroyed and Ava leaves her behind, too. Ava is COLD.\n\n3. The Artificial Intelligence that Nathan created is completely realistic. The knee-jerk guess is that maybe Caleb is an AI, too. But that’s disproven as soon as he cuts himself to find out. Nathan sees this and basically says “Yeah, I get that, and I figured you would.” Chilly stuff. The real twist is that Ava puts on skin so she can go out in the real world, as an unknown. Consider how many people she will come across that will bend over backward for her beauty and charisma, only to find out, probably too late, that she’s not human. It would be nice to think that she’ll just go out and have fun and meet people and soak in the world for its beauty, but truthfully, she’s got no conscience and will use and abuse any one she sees fit, as long as it benefits her. Crazy.\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nAlright…let’s do it.\n\nBigmattress\n\nThe dance scene?!?\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nThe dance scene.\n\nBigmattress\n\nYAY! OMGOMGOMG Okay, I have so many questions, like-\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nHow often do they practice? Why do they do it in the first place? Did Nathan have to teach Kyoko the moves like a cyber-stage-mom, or just program it into her memory?\n\nBigmattress\n\nYes, and-\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nDid he lift the routine from a Dance Dance Revolution game and just copy and paste the code, or did he come up with it by himself? Who knew Oscar Isaac was such a good dancer?\n\nBigmattress\n\nUh…also-\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nThe look on Caleb’s face during the dance scene says it all. This scene…I cannot get enough of it. It’s so great. It’s scary and hilarious and wonderful and amazing. Anything to add, Bigmattress?\n\nBigmattress\n\n*sigh* No, it’s fine. You got it all.\n\nNoodlethedoodle\n\nIn the end:\n\nNathan: big creep, got what was coming.\n\nAva: cunning, remorseless creation of a cunning, remorseless man.\n\nCaleb: object of sympathy on every possible level (orphan, lonely, naive).\n\nKyoko: still waters run deep.\n\nI agree that this movie is something special. It made me think about it afterwards, it was insanely compelling while I was watching it, it was a little twisty in places (but without broadcasting it ahead of time), and it was something different. Really different. Back to you, Bigmattress. *(mic drop)*\n\nBigmattress\n\nIn the end, what a movie. What a great flick. I will go see anything Alex Garland writes or directs from this point forward. I really hope Ex Machina‘s popularity grows and grows over the years, because it’s amazing on so many levels. This is the type of movie I strive to find, the ones just left of center with FAR MORE going on than almost anything going on in mainstream cinema these days. Just about as satisfying as a movie can get. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a dance routine to perfect…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
