        "text": "Wolfs will be at the door of Apple TV+ even sooner than we thought.\n\nThe new action comedy film starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney will debut on the streamer on Friday, Sept. 27, just a week after it premieres in theaters, our sister site Deadline reports. Apple had originally planned a wide theatrical release for the film, but now it will get a limited theatrical release beginning Friday, Sept. 20. (TVLine has reached out to Apple for confirmation.)\n\nPitt and Clooney, reuniting here after teaming up for the Ocean’s 11 films, star as a pair of professional fixers who are both hired to cover up the same high-profile crime. When “the two ‘lone wolves’ are forced to work together, they find their night spiraling out of control in ways that neither one of them expected,” per the official synopsis.\n\nThe cast also includes Austin Abrams (Euphoria), Amy Ryan (Sugar) and Poorna Jagannathan (Never Have I Ever). Jon Watts, who directed the recent Spider-Man blockbuster film trilogy starring Tom Holland, serves as writer and director.\n\nApple is interested in more Wolfs, though: They’ve signed a deal with Watts to write, direct and produce a sequel vehicle for Pitt and Clooney, per Deadline."
