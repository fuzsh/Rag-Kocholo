        "text": "Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure™ at Universal’s Islands of Adventure\n\nWith rich environments, a captivating storyline and a forest with 1,200 trees, this is our most highly themed, immersive coaster experience yet. We worked directly with filmmakers of the Harry Potter™ film series to take guests to the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where groundbreaking coaster technology brings the attraction to life – launching guests seven times and dropping them nearly 17 feet.\n\nUniversal’s Aventura Hotel at Universal Orlando Resort\n\nWe took interior design to a new level to create our most modern and stylish hotel yet. Features include white chandeliers with 327 light fixtures, polished concrete floors, spa-like bathrooms, and an in-room iPad to control temperature, television, and more.\n\nJurassic World – The Ride at Universal Studios Hollywood\n\nJurassic World – The Ride introduces a new generation of fans to the Jurassic franchise. We combined highly creative scenes and special effects to tell a brand-new story starring fan-favorite dinosaurs such as the Indominus Rex and the Mosasaurus.\n\nSing On Tour at Universal Studios Japan\n\nWe collaborated with Universal Studios Japan Entertainment to create this one-of-a-kind stage show based on the hit Illumination film “Sing.” Guests can sing along with characters from the film as part of an immersive experience featuring sophisticated animatronics, cutting-edge kinetic lighting, and an enormous LED screen.\n\nUniversal Beijing Resort\n\nOur development of the world’s newest Universal theme park is underway in the Tongzhou District of Beijing. In addition to classic and cutting-edge attractions, the resort will also include a Universal CityWalk entertainment complex and hotels.\n\nUniversal Destinations & Experiences is an equal opportunity employer.\n\nUniversal elements and all related indicia TM & © 2024 Universal Studios.
