        "text": "Ryan Coogler‘s Proximity Media has boarded an untitled Prince music inspired film at Universal Pictures, Deadline has confirmed.\n\nRyan Coogler, Zinzi Coogler, and Sev Ohanian are producing, and Rebecca Cho will executive produce through Proximity Media. Chairman and CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group Jody Gerson will also produce.\n\nBryan Edward Hill (Titans TV series) wrote a previous draft for the film.\n\nProximity Media is a multi-media company founded by the Cooglers and Ohanian, and co-founded by 2x Oscar winning composer Ludwig Göransson, Archie Davis and Peter Nicks with a mission to create event-driven feature films, television, soundtracks, and podcasts that bring audiences closer together through stories involving often-overlooked subject matters. Proximity’s film projects include two-time Academy Award-winning Judas and the Black Messiah and Space Jam: A New Legacy.\n\nUpcoming, Proximity is readying production on Ryan Coogler’s highly anticipated untitled event film at Warner Bros. The film stars Michael B. Jordan and is set for a March 2025 IMAX release. The company produced the documentary Homeroom with Hulu, directed by Proximity partner Peter Nicks as the final chapter of Nicks’ Oakland trilogy (following The Waiting Room and The Force).\n\nLast year, Proximity co-produced Stephen Curry: Underrated, a documentary on NBA superstar Steph Curry, with Apple Original Films, A24 and Unanimous Media, as well as Anthem, a documentary showing Kris Bowers and Dahi’s quest to reimagine the U.S. national anthem, with Onyx Collective as part of the company’s overall deal with Disney Television.\n\nProximity’s Creed III, co-produced with MGM Studios, was released last March and grossed over $276M worldwide.\n\nThe InSneider first had the news on this one."
