        "text": "Topline\n\nBritney Spears has announced a biopic of her life is in the works after being acquired by Universal Pictures, which will likely cover Spears’ career and experience under a controversial 13-year conservatorship that put her in the spotlight after the #FreeBritney movement to release her from the arrangement went viral.\n\nKey Facts\n\nKey Background\n\nSpears released “The Woman in Me” in October 2023. The book details her life and career, particularly her conservatorship under her father, James P. Spears, which began after two hospitalizations in 2008. Spears said in her memoir that “everything was scrutinized and controlled” under the conservatorship, which gave her father control over both her estate and personal life, including finances, travel and relationships. It lasted for 13 years until a judge ruled that it was no longer necessary in 2021. In a court hearing, she called the arrangement “abusive.” The trial to end the conservatorship was heavily publicized and dominated by the #FreeBritney movement, which started in 2019 and was led by fans of the singer who had long been concerned about her well-being under the conservatorship and claimed that Spears was being controlled against her will. Fans posted on social media with the #FreeBritney tag and gathered around the courthouse during the trial to show support for Spears.\n\nWhat We Don’t Know\n\nUniversal Pictures has not yet announced a release date for the biopic, and the cast of the film is also yet to be confirmed.\n\nTangent\n\nSpears has not released her own music since 2016, when she released her album “Glory,” though she appeared on collaborations with will.i.am and Elton John in 2022. She said earlier this year in a since-deleted Instagram post that she will “never return to the industry,” but Rolling Stone reported on the same day her team was working on new music for the singer.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBritney Spears Biopic Film Set at Universal With ‘Wicked’ Director Jon M.
