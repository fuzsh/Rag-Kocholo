        "text": "They’ve been giant and deadly; they’ve been chatty and contemplative; they’ve been acrobatic and futuristic. Robots in movies have served all kinds of functions in becoming an important part of the cinema landscape. So when filmmakers place a robot at the center of their work, the way it looks and behaves compared with those that have come before must be considered.\n\nThat was the case for Alex Garland, the British novelist (“The Beach”) turned screenwriter (“28 Days Later”), who is making his directing debut with the science-fiction film “Ex Machina,” due April 10. His addition to the robot canon is Ava (Alicia Vikander, above), a sleek, very humanlike artificial intelligence created by a reclusive Internet mogul (Oscar Isaac). Ava is the subject of an experiment to test how well she conveys human qualities.\n\nAs Mr. Garland wrote “Ex Machina,” he mulled what Ava’s design needed to get across. “She had to look, in a completely unambiguous way, like a machine,” he said by telephone from London. “If she looked like she might be a human in a robot suit, then it would introduce into the film the idea that she may or may not be a machine.”\n\nOld Ideas Are Left Out\n\nTo develop Ava, Mr. Garland called upon the comic book artist and illustrator Mark Simpson, known as Jock, whom he collaborated with on the science-fiction film “Dredd.” Jock made sketches — like the one here — that gave a sense of how he thought Ava’s design could go. The sketches began to give Ava shape and influenced her final look, but they also raised an important issue. “The thing we realized was that inadvertently we were referencing or just too close to previous film robots,” Mr. Garland said. They didn’t want to make her arms or breast area metallic, because it would feel too much like the robot from “Metropolis.” They avoided the color gold, so she wouldn’t be compared with C-3PO. And they aimed to minimize white plastic, so she wouldn’t resemble the robot in female form at the center of Chris Cunningham’s music video for Björk’s song “All Is Full of Love.” Mr. Garland, whose father is a cartoonist, also contributed sketches and worked with Jock to create and more solidly refine Ava. Using mesh was a breakthrough, as was creating transparent elements for her torso and arms.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
