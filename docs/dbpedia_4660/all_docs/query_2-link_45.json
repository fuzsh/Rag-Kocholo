        "text": "Amidst the vast industry of Hollywood production companies, Universal Pictures is one studio that doesn’t get nearly as much credit as it should. It may seem odd since Universal is one of the major studios and continues to produce quality movies and franchises. However, I think Universal has a distinct advantage over all the other studios by creating critic-proof blockbusters.\n\nNow, what do I mean by “critic-proof” blockbusters? It’s pretty self-explanatory, but I would describe it as a film that general audiences enjoy, regardless of poor critical reception. This doesn’t necessarily imply that the film is misunderstood by critics. Most of the time, critics accurately represent the reaction to a movie or how it should be, regardless of personal preference.\n\nExamples of this phenomenon have been the films Venom and Bohemian Rhapsody. While both films were poorly received by critics, they both garnered positive reception from audiences. They did well at the box office, earning around 800 million dollars worldwide. How does this happen? Well, there are a couple of factors to consider.\n\nFirstly, it’s important to note that both are based on popular intellectual properties that most are familiar with. Secondly, both have highly talented actors who are very much the glue that holds their projects together. Rami Malek stars as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, while Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock in Venom. Last but not least, these films offered something not many movies did at the time. With Venom, it was the awkwardness of the entire movie. With Bohemian Rhapsody, it was the nostalgia of Queen’s popular music. Thus, despite the critical slander, both films did well at the box office.\n\nOur attention was then drawn to Universal’s film slate, which has thrived on critic-proof blockbusters or, more accurately, critic-proof franchises. From Jaws, Jurassic World, Halloween, and The Fast And The Furious to Illumination’s Minions franchise, there are two common threads. To begin with, they are designed to be viewed on the biggest screens possible, regardless of the quality, because, for better or worse, they are thrill rides that play on the audience’s reactions. Second, each series offers something that can’t easily be compared to a superhero film or a generic action film.\n\nThis is why franchises such as Jurassic World and Fast and Furious have survived for so long. They offer something that not a lot of franchises provide and are not flooding the market yearly. There is a problem with Warner Bros. and Disney because some of their biggest franchises, such as Marvel and DC properties, are released annually. This results in audience fatigue in contrast to Universal, where big franchise releases are spaced out over two or three years, creating a greater appetite for that brand regardless of the quality.\n\nAlthough Universal doesn’t always have the best films, they still hold a significant position in the summer blockbuster landscape. People often forget that they are the second-largest studio behind Disney and are a fierce rival. Consider how Jurassic World managed to stand toe-to-toe with Pixar movies like Incredibles 2, Inside Out, and Lightyear despite all odds, reaching 1 billion dollars.\n\nIllumination’s latest release, Minions: The Rise Of Gru, was able to fight off the leggy Top Gun Maverick and even surpass Lightyear’s abysmal 190 million worldwide in one weekend with a 216 million dollar opening weekend. Clearly, Universal’s blockbuster strategies weren’t a fluke, as evidenced by the box office figures. As for where the future of the studio is heading? That’s a little uncertain to answer.\n\nThis is because many of the franchises are ending — Jurassic World Dominion being the final chapter in the trilogy, Fast 10 and 11 wrapping up The Fast Saga, and Halloween End completing that trilogy. As a result, many big brands are ending, leaving the studio with an uncertain future. Still, I’m sure with the model they used for their blockbusters, they will create or resurrect franchises that audiences love. To quote Jeff Goldblum from Jurassic Park, “Life finds a way.”"
