        "text": "May 15, 2024\n\nThe official trailer for Jon M. Chu’s two-part film adaptation of the Tony Award-winning musical Wicked is finally here.\n\nOver the past few decades, Wicked has become a rite of passage for so many families to have found, not just entertainment, but powerful empowerment in this wonderful story. The journey of ‘Wicked’ actually began at Universal 20 years ago. The property was workshopped there and developed on its way to the Broadway stage. Since then, the stage production has gone on to garner more than $5 billion in ticket sales and has been seen by more than 63 million people worldwide.\n\n— Donna Langley, Chairman, NBCU Studio Group & Chief Content Officer\n\nGo Behind-the-Scenes of Universal's Wicked\n\nNBC will air Wicked behind-the-scenes special Defying Gravity: The Curtain Rises on Wicked on Nov. 25 ahead of the Nov. 27 release of the film. The special will then be available for streaming on Peacock.\n\nLeading up to the trailer’s release, Universal also released a BTS look at the cast and crew of Wicked including footage from Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo receiving the news that they were cast in the film.\n\nAbout Wicked\n\nAfter two decades as one of the most beloved and enduring musicals on the stage, Wicked makes its long-awaited journey to the big screen as a spectacular, generation-defining cinematic event this holiday season.\n\nWicked, the untold story of the witches of Oz, stars Emmy, Grammy and Tony winning powerhouse Cynthia Erivo (Harriet, Broadway’s The Color Purple) as Elphaba, a young woman, misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, who has yet to discover her true power, and Grammy-winning, multi-platinum recording artist and global superstar Ariana Grande as Glinda, a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart.\n\nThe two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship. Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh as Shiz University’s regal headmistress Madame Morrible; Jonathan Bailey (Bridgerton, Fellow Travelers) as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince; Tony nominee Ethan Slater (Broadway’s Spongebob Squarepants, Fosse/Verdon) as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student; Marissa Bode in her feature-film debut as Nessarose, Elphaba’s favored sister; and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz.\n\nThe cast of characters includes Pfannee and ShenShen, two conniving compatriots of Glinda played by Emmy nominee Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live) and Bronwyn James (Harlots); a new character created for the film, Miss Coddle, played by Tony nominee Keala Settle (The Greatest Showman) and four-time Emmy winner Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones) as the voice of Dr. Dillamond.\n\nDirected by acclaimed filmmaker Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Wicked Part Two is scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 26, 2025.\n\nWicked is produced by Marc Platt (La La Land, The Little Mermaid), whose films, television shows and stage productions have earned a combined 46 Oscar® nominations, 58 Emmy nominations and 36 Tony nominations, and by multiple Tony winner David Stone (Kimberly Akimbo, Next to Normal), with whom Platt produced the blockbuster Wicked stage musical. The executive producers are David Nicksay, Stephen Schwartz and Jared LeBoff."
