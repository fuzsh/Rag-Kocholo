Culture resides at the core of the ambitious transformative journey taken by our country under the leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and His Royal Highness the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The Saudi Vision 2030 states that culture is “indispensable to our quality of life” and stresses the need to boost the Kingdom’s cultural output. Our mission at the Ministry of Culture is based on building our nation’s cultural legacy and contributing to fulfilling the objectives of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030.

Saudi culture stands on solid foundations with Saudi creatives across various cultural sectors. We come from a land rich in creative industries across different cultural domains and blessed with human capital whose creativity transcends borders. The Ministry of Culture will work hand in hand with the Saudi creator, the true asset of our culture, in going to great lengths to provide an ideal environment for creativity to thrive. We will leave no stone unturned in opening new doors for Saudis to channel their creative talents. Saudi culture will remain an essential part of our lives.

With a vibrant heritage and a diverse set of traditions spanning 13 regions, Saudi Arabia is home to award-winning multi-disciplinary creatives whose work has been featured regularly on the global stage. These strengths will fuel our flight into higher horizons that not only complement our nation’s standing in the world but pay a rich tribute to its authentic culture
