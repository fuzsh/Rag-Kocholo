        "text": "ISTANBUL, Türkiye\n\nThe Arab nations of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and Yemen on Sunday all strongly condemned an Israeli Cabinet minister’s statement that dropping a bomb on Gaza is one of Israel’s “options” going forward.\n\n\"The failure to immediately dismiss the minister from the government and merely suspending his membership reflects the utmost disregard for all human, ethical, religious, and legal standards by the Israeli government,\" said the Saudi Foreign Ministry, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.\n\nJordan also condemned the official's statements, calling them a \"call for genocide and a hate crime that cannot be ignored, as well as incitement to murder and the commission of war crimes, in addition to the crimes committed against the people of the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nSufyan Al-Qudah, spokesperson for Jordan’s Foreign Ministry, said “such statements represent a blatant and unacceptable violation of international law and humanitarian law, and constitute a dangerous escalation that requires the international community to take immediate action against it.”\n\nHe added that “combating hate speech involves effective steps that would compel Israel, as the occupying power, to cease its ongoing attacks on the Palestinian people in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, as well as its violations of international law and humanitarian law.”\n\n\"Qatar strongly condemns the threat made by an Israeli minister to strike Gaza with a nuclear bomb and considers it a serious incitement to a war crime,” said the country’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday, adding its voice to the chorus of denunciations.\n\nQatar also decried Israel's leniency towards the official's threats by merely suspending him, not dismissing him.\n\nThe statement stressed that the provocative and odious remarks are extensions of the Israeli government’s escalation politics in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nYemen also condemned the Israeli official’s remarks on Sunday, saying in a Foreign Ministry statement that they reflect “unprecedented levels of hatred and extremism.”\n\nYemen called on the international community to put an end to racist and inflammatory rhetoric, as well as the daily crimes against the Palestinian people.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said that “one of Israel’s options in the war in Gaza is to drop a nuclear bomb on the strip,” The Times of Israel reported.\n\nIn a radio interview, Eliyahu also “voiced his objection to allowing any humanitarian aid into Gaza.”\n\nAfter the remarks, Eliyahu was suspended from government meetings indefinitely, the premier’s office said, adding that his statements “are not based in reality.”\n\nIsrael and the Israeli army “are operating in accordance with the highest standards of international law to avoid harming innocents,” the office said."
