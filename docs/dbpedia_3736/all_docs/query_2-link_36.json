It is an independent administrative and financial agency, associated with the Economic Affairs and Development Council. The system coordinates with all sectors and state agencies to implement the Premium Residency System, which is distinguished for those who wish to obtain a distinctive residence in Saudi Arabia through its electronic services system, its various departments, and its direct contact with customers from everywhere.\n\nPlease note that the only verifiable source for the Premium Residency Visa is the link provided on the Embassy's website.
