        "text": "Iran's IRGC Chief-Commander Hossein Salami, in a message, congratulated Yahya Sinwar on his appointment as the head of Hamas' political bureau and expressed hope that under Sinwar's leadership, Israel will \"soon be uprooted from the holy land of Palestine.\"\n\n\"As always, we will spare no effort in helping you and other steadfast fighters,\" he added.\n\nHezbollah looks increasingly like it may strike Israel independent of whatever Iran may intend to do, CNN reporter citing two sources familiar with the intelligence.\n\n“The Lebanon-based militant group is moving faster than Iran in its planning and is looking to strike Israel in the coming days,” the report said citing one of the sources. Iran, meanwhile, appears to still be working out how it plans to respond, multiple officials have told CNN.\n\nMany are left wondering could the Egyptian warning to pilots against using Iran’s airspace early Thursday be the window that Iran will use to retaliate against Israel.\n\nExperts advise caution on reaching conclusions just yet. The answer, they said, is not a simple yes or no, but rather a myriad of reasons.\n\n\"No one has a clear sense of Iran's timing for a response,\" Bessma Momani, a Professor of Political Science at the University of Waterloo in Canada, told Iran International.\n\nMomani said it would be be highly unusual for Iran to share information of a potential strike on Israel with Egypt.\n\n\"Regional actors are trying to get prepared and to signal their preparedness but I doubt Egypt would be privy to any information on when or if Iran and its allies plan on responding to Israel with a military attack,\" she added.\n\n\"Cordial but not warm,\" is how Momani described Egypt-Iran relations.\n\nThe French president Emmanuel Macron told Israeli prime minister to avoid a cycle of retaliation, following a similar conversation with the Iranian president Wednesday.\n\nMacron told Netanyahu the \"logic of de-escalation \"should apply to all parties in the region,\" according to the official report of the phone conversation.\n\nHe also reiterated that France's \"absolute urgency\" is an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, as well as delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe White House press secretary refused to comment on Iran's potential retaliatory attack against Israel, making it clear instead that US policy was to push for de-escalation.\n\n\"It's up for Iran to say what it will or will not do,\" Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday. \"They've been very public about what their next steps are going to be in responding (to Haniyeh's killing).\"\n\n\"What we're going to do is to continue to have conversations with Mideast partners and leaders and urge de-escalation. Our focus is on de-escalating Mideast tensions,\" she added.\n\nThe Biden administration has warned actors in the Middle East to refrain from escalatory moves.\n\n\"The message that we are impressing upon everyone in the region is that no party should take any steps to escalate this conflict,\" the US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday.\n\n\"We are in the final stages, hopefully of a ceasefire deal, and escalation has the potential to make every problem the region faces worse,\" Miller said, calling the current situation \"delicate\", where \"tensions are high\".\n\nIran’s president Masoud Pezeshkian has pleaded with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to hold back a promised retaliatory attack on Israel, warning that further escalation would have a devastating impact on his new-won presidency, sources familiar with the matter told Iran International on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a recent meeting with Khamenei, Pezeshkian urged the 85-year-old ruler to prevent any direct Iranian attack on Israel to avoid a full-blown war that would deepen Iran's existing socio-economic woes.\n\nThe sources told Iran International that Pezeshkian warned that a potential Israeli retaliation targeting Iran's energy infrastructure could cripple the Iranian economy and even lead to the state's collapse.\n\nDespite this grave warnings, Khamenei remained noncommittal during the session, neither validating nor opposing the president's concerns, according to the sources.\n\nRead more here.\n\nJordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warned about potential \"devastation\" in the Middle East and called for \"transformative\" actions to get a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\"We need to do something really transformative here, regardless of where Iran is, where Israel is at this point, if we are to forces Israel to accept a ceasefire, end the aggression in Gaza,\" he told CNN.\n\nJordan did help in the joint operation with the US and others to intercept Iran's missiles and drones in the last round of escalation in April.\n\n\"We have two paths: a path that drives the region further to the abyss of war or a path that would say enough is enough and save the region from the devastation of an all-out war,\" he added.\n\nIranian acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani called on Muslim countries to support Iran's right to defend itself against \"acts of aggression\".\n\nKani is in Jeddah for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which has convened at Iran's request following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nIran has blamed Israel and the US for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed to \"avenge\" his blood.\n\nKani criticized the west for \"failing to condemn\" the assassination, accusing them of having \"no interest in regional stability\" and wanting \"perpetual insecurity\" instead.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the country’s readiness for both offense and defense during his visit to the Tel Hashomer army recruitment base, where he met with draftees to the IDF’s Armored Corps and Combat Engineering Corps.\n\n“We are continuing forward to victory. I know that Israeli citizens are on alert, and I ask you one thing — stay calm and composed. We are striking our enemies and are also determined to defend ourselves,” Netanyahu told the troops.\n\nHe expressed his pride in the soldiers, both those in the reserves and the standing army, calling them the “backbone of the nation.”\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has emphasized that the election of Yahya Sinwar as the leader of Hamas sends a clear message that the Palestinian issue is now significantly controlled by Iran and Hamas. Katz stated, \"The election of Yahya Sinwar as the leader of Hamas must send a clear message to the world that the Palestinian issue is now completely controlled by Iran and Hamas.\"\n\nKatz warned of the consequences of Israel withdrawing its military presence in Gaza, saying, \"Without Israeli action in Gaza, the area would fall entirely under Hamas control.\" He further explained that in Judea and Samaria, the survival of Abbas and the Palestinian Authority is due to \"Israel's intensive military operations against Hamas and Islamic Jihad infrastructure, which are supported and promoted by Iran.\"\n\nHighlighting the regional threats, Katz noted, \"Iran is working to smuggle weapons into Jordan to destabilize the Jordanian regime and then flood the refugee camps in Judea and Samaria and the entire area with weapons and funding to establish another terror front from the east against Israel’s major population centers.\"\n\nKatz proposed a solution: \"The solution is Palestinian self-management in Judea and Samaria, allowing them to manage their own lives.\" However, he stressed that \"Israel must maintain control over security and foreign affairs to prevent the establishment of another Iranian-Islamist extremist stronghold and enable Palestinians to manage their internal affairs. Anything else will lead to the creation of another Iranian outpost in the region, which will explode in the face of the world and all regional countries.\"\n\nKatz concluded by urging global support for Israel: \"The world must see reality as it is and support Israel, which currently stands at the forefront of the battle against the Iranian and extremist Islamist axis.\"\n\nIn a phone conversation with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Ali Bagheri Kani, acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic, criticized European countries for their passive stance on the assassination of Haniyeh.\n\nHe stated that their failure to condemn this “action that violates international peace and security” resulted in a missed diplomatic opportunity.\n\nBagheri Kani also held the United States, the United Kingdom, and France responsible for the actions of what he described as the sole malevolent entity in the region.\n\nThe United States and Australia have denounced Iran's destabilizing behavior, including its support for armed proxies and militant partners.\n\nThe statement was released after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III hosted Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense Richard Marles on August 6 in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nThey condemned threats to shipping and freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Gulf of Aden, stressing the need to defend navigational rights and freedoms.\n\nThey also slammed Tehran’s arbitrary and unjust detention of foreign and dual nationals, as well as targeting, intimidation, and harassment of dissidents overseas.\n\nThe statement alsoexpressed concerns over Iran's nuclear-related expansions, proliferation of ballistic missiles, and provision of drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine.\n\nThe secretaries and ministers also slammed Iran's human rights violations and abuses, especially against women, girls, and members of minority groups and expressed a shared commitment to standing with the people of Iran.\n\nWhite House officials said Tuesday that they believe President Joe Biden’s efforts to prevent a war in the Middle East \"may be paying off\" and \"Iran may be reconsidering a plan for major retaliation\" following the killing of the Hamas chief in Tehran, Washington Post reported.\n\n\"The Iranian response has been complicated by seeming confusion over the circumstances of Haniyeh’s death. Tehran at first claimed he was killed by an Israeli missile, requiring a similar Iranian response. But officials say that Tehran has concluded privately that he was instead eliminated by a concealed bomb, perhaps prompting a different response,\" read the article.\n\nTehran may also be dissuaded by the US show of force this week, and secret White House communications passed via the Swiss embassy in Tehran and the Iranian mission at the United Nations, the report said.\n\n“Iran understands clearly that the US is unwavering in its defense of our interests, our partners and our people. We have moved a significant amount of military assets to the region to underscore that principle,” a senior administration official\n\nAccording to media affiliated with Iran-backed Houthis, US and UK forces carried out two airstrikes targeting Houthi positions in Yemen's Taiz province on Tuesday night.\n\nThe report came after CENTCOM, the United States Central Command, issued a statement announcing that its forces had successfully intercepted and destroyed an uncrewed aerial vehicle and two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles launched from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen toward the Red Sea.\n\nThroughout Tuesday, continuous exchanges of fire were also reported between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah.\n\nA day earlier, an Iran-backed militia in Iraq launched a rocket attack on US troops at Iraq's Ain al-Assad base, injuring several American soldiers. Iraq has arrested three people in western Anbar suspected of carrying out the rocket attack.\n\nThe US has also moved an F/A-18 squadron from the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt to a regional partner base on Monday, in addition to the F-22 squadron arriving in the coming days, to help defend Israel and US assets ahead of expected Iranian attack, The Wall Street Journal reported citing a Pentagon official."
