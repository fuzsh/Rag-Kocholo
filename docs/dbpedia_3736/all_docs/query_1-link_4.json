        "text": "After Saudis killed the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, Vice Media joined many other American companies in publicly distancing themselves from the Saudi Arabian government, whose agents carried out the killing.\n\nNow, Vice is in talks to expand its business in the kingdom.\n\nThe youth-focused digital media company is exploring a deal with MBC, a media giant partly owned by the Saudi government, to start a new content partnership in the region, according to two people with knowledge of the talks who would speak only on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe deal, which may include the creation of a media brand focused on lifestyle coverage and training local media workers, could be worth at least $50 million over multiple years, one of the people said. Shane Smith, a co-founder of Vice, has been involved in some of the discussions.\n\nVice is talking with MBC at a pivotal time for the company, which has struggled to live up to its lofty $5.7 billion valuation and has been weighing a sale of its business. Any significant deal with MBC could increase the price it is able to command from a suitor. But the talks could still fall through, and any prospective acquirer could try to distance the company from entities affiliated with the Saudi government.\n\nThe potential deal could also cause internal blowback at Vice.\n\nIn April last year, the company’s decision to open a commercial office in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, became a point of contention. In a call with the staff to discuss the new office, one producer called the decision “morally bankrupt.”\n\nA Vice spokesman said in a statement that the company was focused on young audiences underserved by existing media organizations, especially in countries like Saudi Arabia where a majority of the population is under 35.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
