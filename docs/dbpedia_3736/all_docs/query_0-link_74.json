The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:06 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Gilman, Morella, Shays, Mr. Davis of Virginia, Ose, Mrs. Jo Ann Davis of Virginia, Weldon, Schrock, Duncan, Sullivan, Waxman, Maloney, Norton, Cummings, Tierney, Schakowsky, and Clay. Staff present: Kevin Binger, staff director; James C. Wilson, chief counsel; David A. Kass, deputy chief counsel; S. Elizabeth Clay and Caroline Katzin, professional staff members; Allyson Blandford, staff assistant; Robert A. Briggs, chief clerk; Robin Butler, office manager; Elizabeth Crane, deputy communications director; Joshua E. Gillespie, deputy chief clerk; Nicholis Mutton, assistant to chief counsel; Leneal Scott, computer systems manager; Corinne Zaccagnini, systems administrator; David Rapallo, minority counsel; Ellen Rayner, minority chief clerk; and Jean Gosa and Earley Green, minority assistant clerks. Mr. Burton. If everybody will take their seats. Good morning. A quorum being present, the Committee on Government Reform will come to order. I ask unanimous consent that all Members and witnesses written and opening statements be included in the record. Without objection, so ordered. I ask unanimous consent to include in the record a letter to the committee from former Ambassador Raymond Mabus, and without objection, so ordered. I ask unanimous consent that all the written questions submitted to witnesses and answers provided by witnesses after the conclusion of this hearing be included in the record. Without objection so ordered. I ask unanimous consent that a set of exhibits relating to this hearing, which have been shared with the minority staff prior to the hearing be included in the record and without objection so ordered. Mr. Waxman. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Burton. Yes, sir. Mr. Waxman. May I just make a request. There are some exhibits that have been furnished to us and we don't think we're going to have any objection to making it a part of the record, but we would like to have a chance to review them because we haven't had a chance at the staff level. So if you can just withhold those requests until the end of this hearing, we'll get an answer to you. Mr. Burton. OK. That is fine. I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits and extraneous or tabular material referred to be included in the record, and without objection, so ordered. What is happening in the Middle East right now is critically important. We have strategic interests. We have economic interests, and we have military interests. So it is imperative that we win the war on terrorism, and to do that, we have to have strong allies in that region. We need access to airfields and military bases there. It is also imperative that we preserve the flow of oil from the Middle East. We get about 55, 56 percent of our oil from that area. Our economy depends on that stable supply of oil and that can't be ignored. Our commitment to Israel's security is another important strategic interest. It's a commitment that we must keep. Managing our relationships in the Middle East is one of the most difficult challenges faced by every administration. It has been a problem for every President and every Secretary of State since World War II. With all of these massive strategic interests hanging in the balance, it is no wonder that sometimes the problems of average everyday people get swept aside. Humphrey Bogart once said, and I usually don't quote movies in this hearing, but this is one of my favorite movies, Casa Blanca. Humphrey Bogart once said, ``the problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world.'' Great statement. Sometimes that is just the way it is, and there is nothing you can do about it, but there are also times when we have to set aside all of those big global issues and do the right thing by the people we're elected to serve. There are times when someone has to say, time out. Let us stop and take a good hard look at what we're doing. And that is the purpose of this hearing. We need to take a time-out and take a hard look, a good hard look at our relationship with Saudi Arabia. The specific problem that I'm talking about is that Saudi men who kidnap their American children and take them away to Saudi Arabia must be taken to task. We've seen cases where three men have violated court orders, taken their children away against their will and kept them away from their mothers for years, if not decades. Despite the fact that arrest warrants have been issued for some kidnaps, the Saudi Government has refused to lift a finger to help us solve these cases. In fact, the Saudi Government has created a safe haven for these child abductors in a country where women and children are treated like property. Maybe the saddest thing of all is that our government, our State Department, has done very little to help bring these children home. And one of the cases we're going to talk about today, a mother went to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh. After her two children, she was trying to rescue them from their abusive father. And the Embassy kicked them out and after she was kicked out, she was arrested and put into prison in Saudi Arabia. I don't understand that. One of the reasons I decided to hold this hearing is that I was so appalled at the lack of effort we've made to take the Saudis to task for letting these things happen. We have a lot at stake with Saudi Arabia. We need their cooperation. But at what price? If we're not willing to stand up and fight for American citizens whose children have been kidnapped, then what kind of priorities do we have? Today we're going to hear the stories of three mothers who had their children snatched away from them. Three things stand out in each of these stories: One, the brutal treatment of women in Saudi Arabia; two, the incredible courage of these women who did everything they could to rescue their children; and three, the total lack of effort by our State Department to challenge the Saudi Government. These stories are also powerful, that I'd like to talk about each one of them in detail. But I'm not going to do that, because I can't tell their stories nearly as well as they can. But I do want to mention a few key facts. Pat Roush has been living this nightmare for 16 years. In those 16 years, she has seen her two daughters one time for 2 hours. Her ex-husband came to the United States in 1986, kidnapped their two young daughters in violation of a court custody order and took them to Saudi Arabia. An arrest warrant was issued here in the United States, but the Saudi Government did absolutely nothing. The year before that when Pat went to Saudi Arabia to try to salvage their marriage, her husband beat her so badly that two of her ribs were broken, and the Saudi police didn't do anything then either. Over the last 16 years, U.S. Ambassadors have come and gone in Riyadh. Some have tried to help and some have not, but it is clear that the Saudis were never told by senior officials that this was a problem that was going to affect the relationship between our two countries. In 1986, the U.S. Ambassador was told by his boss that he had to maintain impartiality in the Roush case. Why? Pat Roush's husband broke the law. An arrest warrant was issued. Why should we maintain impartiality? To me that attitude goes right to the heart of this problem. Ambassador Mabus deserves special credit in this case. In 1996 he started a new policy. No one from this man's family was allowed to get a visa to come to the United States. This was a big influential family. When they couldn't get visas to come to the United States, it caused a big problem for them. Unfortunately, after a year, Ambassador Mabus returned to the United States and his policy was discontinued. If this policy had been kept in place, it might very well have put the pressure on them to return these children to their mother. I'm very disappointed that didn't happen. We were told just this week that Pat's youngest daughter, Aisha, who is now 19, was recently forced into a marriage with a Saudi man. Pat's older daughter, Alia, was forced to marry one of her cousins a year ago. Now, let me say a few words about Monica Stowers. In 1985 she went to Saudi Arabia with her husband and two young children. When she arrived, she realized for the first time that her husband had a second wife and another child. She didn't know about that. Their marriage fell apart after 6 months. Her husband divorced her and had her deported without her children. In 1990, Monica heard that her ex-husband was abusing her children. She went back to Saudi Arabia. She took her children and went to the U.S. Embassy to ask for help. Did they put her on the next plane to America? No. At the end of the day, they told Monica that she had to leave the Embassy. She pleaded with them not to kick her out. She told them that she would be arrested for overstaying her visa, but the consul general had the marine guards carry them out. Sure enough, she was arrested and put in jail and her children were taken from her once again. Can you imagine that, an American citizen is in a crisis, a mother and her young children, and the Embassy staff tell their Marines to drag them out of the Embassy so they can be arrested? That actually happened. Monica is not here today. For most of the last 12 years, she has stayed in Saudi Arabia to protect her children. She can leave any time she wants, but her husband refuses to allow their daughter to go. Her ex-husband tried to force her daughter into a marriage when she was only 12 years old, and Monica will not abandon her. While Monica can't be here to testify, her mother Ethel Stowers is here to speak on her behalf and we're very glad to have her here. The third story we're going to hear about today is about Miriam Hernandez-Davis and her daughter, Dria. They're both here to testify today. The reason they can both be here today is not because anybody in the U.S. Government came to their rescue. The reason that Miriam's daughter is here today is that Miriam was able to scrape together $180,000 to pay two men to smuggle Dria out of Saudi Arabia. Even though Miriam's husband kidnapped her daughter in 1997 and even though the FBI issued an international warrant for his arrest, she got almost no help from the State Department or our Embassy. The courage of these women, Pat Roush, Monica Stowers and Miriam Hernandez, and their kids, is just incredible to me. You've all endured terrible pain as a result of what has happened, and it is a real honor to have all of you here today. These are not isolated incidents. These are three examples of a much bigger problem. The State Department has a list of 46 recent cases involving as many as 92 U.S. citizens who have been held against their will in Saudi Arabia. The route cause of this problem is the Saudi Government. They have refused to respect U.S. law and U.S. arrest warrants. The law in Saudi Arabia lets Saudi men keep American women and children in Saudi Arabia even when they are in violation of court orders, even when arrest warrants have been issued and even when they have abused their wives and their children, and that is just wrong. We can't let this go on. Our relationship with Saudi Arabia is important, but this just can't be allowed to continue. The only way we're going to resolve this problem and get these kids home again is by elevating this issue, letting the American people and people throughout the world know about it. This has to be raised with the Saudis at the highest levels. The Saudis have to be made to understand that if they let this go on, their relationship with us is going to suffer, and I don't think that has happened yet. I am preparing a letter to the President, and I'm going to ask all of my colleagues on the committee to sign it. We're going to ask the President to raise this issue with Crown Prince Abdullah to try to get it resolved. Just a couple months ago, President Bush raised the case of Lori Berenson with the President of Peru. Lori Berenson was twice convicted of terrorist activities in that country. Surely the Roush family and the Stowers family deserve at least as much. We in Congress have to do our part as well. We've got to continue to hold hearings like this and write letters and do whatever we can to keep the pressure on. My colleague, Mr. Lantos, who I'm sure will be here in a few moments, held hearings and had Pat Roush testify way back in 1987, 15 years ago. He deserves a lot of credit for constantly pushing human rights issues, and we all need to keep doing it. I want to thank Pat Roush and Ethel Stowers and Miriam and Dria Hernandez for being here today, and I want to tell you how much I really admire you and your tenacity. I also want to thank our witnesses on the second panel, Diane Andruch and Ryan Crocker from the State Department; former U.S. Ambassador Hume Horan; Daniel Pipes from the Middle East Form; and Doug Bandow from the Cato Institute. We look forward to hearing from all of you as well. One final issue. More than 2 months ago, I wrote the State Department and requested documents on these three cases. Getting those documents has been very difficult and painfully slow. There is a stack of documents several feet high that are still in the Embassy in Riyadh. They haven't even been sent to Washington yet. We received some documents from the State Department here in Washington, but they still have documents here that haven't been provided to us. And these documents that we have received have redactions. They crossed things out that simply aren't acceptable. We need that information. I think the legislative affairs office at the State Department has been trying hard to get these documents, and I appreciate that, but the bureaucracy at the State Department is so bad that 2 months have gone by and we only have a small fraction of the documents in these cases. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. I'm going to issue a subpoena today to make sure all of these documents are produced to us, and without redactions. And with that, Mr. Waxman, thanks for being patient and I yield to you. Mr. Waxman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this hearing. I think it is an important one, and I want to commend you for bringing the witnesses before us today. The United States and Saudi Arabia have sharply different values. We are a pluralistic democracy. They are a monarchy without elected representative, institutions or political parties. We embrace religious freedom. They rule through religious police. Economically, diplomatically and socially, the Saudi Arabian Government has long promoted policies that challenge American beliefs and undermine the basic human rights of their own people. And as this hearing will show, even some of our people. In no area are these distinctions more important than in the treatment of women. Although women in Saudi Arabia make up half the population, they can't vote. They can't even drive cars. They are entirely excluded from certain professions and they are required to be shrouded in a black abaya when they appear in public. Saudi women cannot apply for identity cards, receive medical treatment or leave the country without permission from their nearest male relative. In many areas of the country, women cannot even leave their homes without being escorted by a male relative. The injustice of such discrimination is only exacerbated by the serious cases of abuse that it facilitates. Today, the committee will learn the devastating impact these misguided policies have had on American women who have been trapped in Saudi Arabia by fathers and husbands, who have used these laws to refuse their release. We will hear today from Alexandria Davis, who was kidnapped by her father when she was 11 years old and forced to live in Saudi Arabia for 2 years. We will hear from Pat Roush, who has been fighting for 16 years to get her daughters back after they were kidnapped by their father and taken to Saudi Arabia. We will also hear from Ethel Stowers, who will tell us about her daughter, Monica's efforts, to get her children Rasheed and Amjad out of Saudi Arabia. Their stories are chilling, and their tragedy is compounded by the fact that there are dozens of other American families facing a similar situation. The U.S. Government must do more to intervene on behalf of its citizens. We must hold the Saudi Government accountable for these irresponsible policies that are shielding kidnappers, abusive fathers and husbands from prosecution. Mr. Chairman, I know we're going to hear from people who will say there are marital problems whenever you have marriages from parties from different nationalities. Well, most countries abide by international agreements that don't let one parent or the other just simply kidnap the children. Saudi Arabia is not willing to abide by these international agreements and to enter into the treaties with us and other countries. We will hear that this is their own internal decisionmaking in Saudi Arabia, and it is not our business to tell them how to run their affairs. Perhaps that is true, but the United States is fighting in Afghanistan at the present time to--and we fought in part to bring down a regime that discriminated against women. In fact, First Lady Laura Bush commended the fact that in Afghanistan, women were not going to be oppressed any longer. Well, we need the First Lady and the American Government to stand up for the human right of women all over the world, and in Saudi Arabia, the problems we're seeing with American citizens are compounded by the Saudi treatment of women as chattel, as property and not as human beings. I think we have to speak out for human rights for all people wherever they may be, but we certainly have to go to bat for our American citizens who are being treated in the most inhumane way when it comes to holding their families together. If we are pro-human rights, if we are profamily, the U.S. Government needs to do more and I thank you very much for holding this hearing. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mr. Waxman. [The prepared statement of Hon. Henry A. Waxman follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. Mr. Gilman. Mr. Gilman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for conducting this important hearing. In the aftermath of September 11th, President Bush offered a potent challenge to world leaders that exhibited a dose of moral clarity that is too often absent from diplomatic discourse between our Nation and its foes and allies alike. And the President said, ``you are either with us or against us.'' The President's statement represented a moment of truth not only for the leaders of the world, but for the future course of our foreign policy. While continuing to pursue our national interest in conjunction with our close allies, our Nation can no longer afford to ignore the often tremendous gulf between our values and those of our allies in the war on terrorism. It was also vividly illustrated in the hearing that I presided over in the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia and our International Relations Committee on June 22, entitled, ``the Future of U.S.-Saudi Relations.'' The U.S.-Saudi relationship has always been a complex one, grounded in common interests stemming from the geopolitical realities of the Persian Gulf region. However, if we're to remain true to the words of our President, we must no longer avoid the conclusion that American and Saudi values are often at odds. It may be prudent to ask what it is about the values of the Saudi Government has imparted to their citizens that gives rise to support for the ideologies undergirding terrorism. To understand this phenomenon most accurately, it is essential to consider Saudi's denial of political, of civil and religious rights to its own population. The lack of transparency in its justice system, and its poor human rights record. Not only do Saudis suffer at the hands of their own government, but so do American citizens in Saudi Arabia as well, and our government has done much too little to address this problem until now. We're here today to examine whether our Nation should do more to help our citizens who have been held against their will in Saudi Arabia. This hearing is particularly relevant to us today. If we shy away from addressing this issue directly with the Saudi authorities, as issue that centers around something as fundamental as the rights of American citizens, we'll not be able to handle the even more difficult issues at the core of our war against terrorism, when American and Saudi interests come into conflict--as they undoubtedly will. Our government must do much more to ensure the rights of our American citizens who happen to be in Saudi Arabia. We've consistently failed to hold these Saudi authorities accountable for their own laws which result in blatant infringements upon the rights of American nationals. As the testimony today will illustrate, American citizens are being held against their will in Saudi Arabia, and often in violation of our laws against child abductions. Even if our legal standards are not recognized by the Saudi authorities, it is essential that our diplomatic engagement with Saudi Arabia reflect a genuine concern for the welfare of our citizens who happen to be held in Saudi Arabia. Why is it that until now our government has failed to apply sufficient diplomatic pressure on their Saudi counterparts to ensure the release of our Americans? As Members of Congress, it should be our primary goal to defend the rights of American citizens whether they be in the United States or abroad, demanding an effective and unapologetic response to those Nations that seek to deny these rights. Mr. Chairman, may this hearing serve as a wakeup call to those who seek to downplay the harm to our citizens. May it highlight the results of our Nation's failure, our unwillingness to address difficulties in our U.S.-Saudi relationship. If, as the President said, states are either with us or against us in our war on terrorism, it is essential, too, that we hold to account even our allies for their divergence from the clear moral path that has been so clearly laid before us. Terrorism and the propagation of hatred must be condemned at all levels, and basic human rights must be observed if our mission to rid the world of evil terrorist ideologies is to be true to its goals. Most importantly, we must be prepared to address all of the difficult issues in our relationships with the Saudis if we're truly able to count Saudi Arabia as an ally in our war against terrorism, and to this end, our Nation must ensure that the rights of our citizens in Saudi are guaranteed. I look forward to hearing from the parents who are willing to come before our committee today and to examine their testimony, and then we look forward to hearing from the administration officials with regard to their response. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mr. Gilman. Ms. Schakowsky. Ms. Schakowsky. Mr. Chairman, I thank you so much for convening this hearing, and I thank these witnesses so much for their courage and their persistence in coming forward today. I want to say to you, I know this hearing is about you. We do want to hear from you, but it is important that all of us who are speaking now are supporting you and saying very publicly that we support your efforts and that we cried when this happened to you. So I also thank you for your patience in listening to our statements. Year after year, the U.S. Government has reported severe human rights abuse against women in Saudi Arabia, and some of these abuses have even been experienced by the U.S. citizens. The State Department's country reports on human rights practices stated that in Saudi Arabia, ``women of many nationalities were detained for actions such as riding in a taxi with a man who was not their relative, appearing with their heads uncovered in shopping malls and eating in restaurants with males who were not their relatives. Many such prisoners were held for days, sometimes weeks, without officials notifying their families or in case of foreigners, their Embassies.'' I am a strong supporter of defending women's rights in Afghanistan, and I'm proud to say that these rights are finally being recognized. The women there are currently involved in the decisionmaking process to help shape the new Government of Afghanistan, to make sure that women of Afghanistan will never again be treated like second-class citizens. If such change can happen in a war-torn country like Afghanistan, it baffles me that Saudi Arabia refuses to reform its laws on women's rights and join the rest of the world in the 21st century. What has happened to Ms. Roush, Ms. Stowers, Ms. Davis and her mother is a tragedy. These women have been physically and emotionally battered and have had their children stolen by their husbands. I'm aware that under Saudi law, the husband has complete control over his wife and children, deciding on how they live, whom they see and even when they are allowed to leave the country. We simply cannot ignore these violations against the basic rights of both Saudi and American women. The Saudi Government has been an ally of the United States for a number of years, but we must give the cases of these women and others the attention they deserve. I understand that according to the Department of State, we are very limited in what we can do to force the Saudi Government to allow these women to leave with their children. However, this is not an excuse to ignore the situation and do everything we can. I'm eager to hear from the witnesses that are with us today, and I look forward to working toward a solution that will be in the best interest of the children and families involved in these and all similar cases. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Ms. Schakowsky. Mr. Ose. Mr. Ose. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have a long statement. I want to welcome Ms. Roush to the witness table today. I came to this hearing today having read the testimony-- I would like to find in the course of our hearing today the name, the person who told the Marines to take American citizens out of the American Embassy and place them outside of where they could be arrested. I want the name of that person. Mr. Chairman, I will be back to you with requests for subpoenas to have these people come to our committee and explain their actions in light of the consequences that they knew would occur when these people were removed from the Embassy, having shown valid American passports to have the American authorities forcibly remove American citizens from American soil in this manner. I have to tell you, I stayed up late last night wondering why in blazes did I come to Congress? Why did I come to Congress? Did I come to Congress so some bureaucrat could take American citizens, refuse to help them, evict them from an American Embassy, from American soil, knowing that the consequence of doing that would be their arrest and the loss of their children? I have to tell you, Ms. Roush and I have spoken before. I have communicated with the State Department for the past few years about her case in particular. A woman named Mary Ryan, who is the Assistant Secretary of something or another having to do with the Near East. These are American citizens. Now, if we can send our young people over to the Middle East to protect them from Saddam Hussein or whatever, or if we can send them to Afghanistan to establish the rights of the people of Afghanistan, then we can darn well take the time to bring in front of this body and in front of this committee the people who are making the decisions that say, well, no, you're less-- you don't even have the rights of an American convicted of a crime in these countries. So at the risk of belaboring the subject, I'm going to stop, Mr. Chairman, but I'm coming back, and we're going to find these names and I'm going to ask you to bring those people in front of this committee. Because they need to tell the American people what happened, why they did this. This is unbelievable. I yield back. [The prepared statement of Hon. Doug Ose follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. I can assure you that the subpoena that we're going to be issuing right after this hearing will cover all of these documents, and we will get the names of those people, and I'll certainly let you know as soon as I get all that information. Mr. Cummings. Mr. Cummings. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, today we meet to bring attention and focus on the problem of American children who live with their Saudi fathers and who, because of Saudi law, are not free to leave Saudi Arabia. These cases predominantly involve fathers who abduct children and take them into Saudi Arabia in order to take advantage of a legal system that gives mothers, especially nonMuslim mothers, few rights. Specifically, we need to determine if the U.S. Government has done enough to aid U.S. citizens who have been held against their will in Saudi Arabia. Many of our U.S. citizens like the witnesses before our committee today, have tried unsuccessfully to get their children back from Saudi Arabia by going through the State Department, by employing Saudi lawyers and by working with the U.S. Congress. My heart goes out to them. The State Department has treated these cases as custody dispute issues. However, the real question becomes which country's law has the domain over such custody disputes? Will it be American laws or Saudi law in customs? I agree with former Ambassador Raymond Mabus, when he stated in a letter to this committee that the Roush case and the similar cases should be about protecting American citizens and the court orders of American courts. Many have said the United States has failed to uphold the American and international abduction or kidnapping laws. It has been argued that cases such as the ones before us are merely child custody issues. While that is true, these cases should also be considered as parental kidnapping or child abduction cases. This morning I saw a report about the subject of today's hearing on one of the morning talk programs. I believe that shining the spotlight on parental abductions of American children to Saudi Arabia by this committee and the media will bring this issue to the forefront and persuade the State Department to reevaluate its policies. I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses who will present their stories about trying to get their children out of Saudi Arabia. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for shining the spotlight on this issue and I yield back. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mr. Cummings. [The prepared statement of Hon. Elijah E. Cummings follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. Mr. Schrock. Mr. Schrock. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with everything everybody said here, especially Mr. Ose. I couldn't have said it better. I'd probably have made a fool of myself if I'd said it, because this sort of thing really angers me. I am here mainly because of the article the chairman sent us yesterday that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on December 21st about Ms. Roush and her two daughters, and I was absolutely outraged that this is allowed to happen and continues to be allowed to happen. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Schrock. I'm anxious to hear what these four ladies have to say, but I'm particularly interested in hearing the next panel. They are the ones whose feet need to be put in the fire and held in the fire until they do something about it. You know, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia doesn't mind coming sit in the Oval Office telling our President what he wants him to do. I think it's maybe time for the man in the Oval Office to call him and say we want our kids back and we want them back right now. And I think the sooner we do that, the sooner these subpoenas are done--I just hope this committee doesn't adjourn today and just ignore this, because although I've only been here 17 months, I don't want to come back in 4 or 5 years and have these same witnesses appearing before us. We need to get something done and get it done right now. This is unacceptable and our State Department better get off the dime and get something done before this gets even worse, or somebody is going to have to be held accountable, and it is us here who have to do that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mr. Schrock. Ms. Norton. Ms. Norton. May I begin by thanking you, Mr. Chairman, for wonderful leadership and making the American people and the Congress understand that this is a problem and that this is a problem that we can do something about. It is a problem that occasionally one hears some interested journalist get ahold of and gives us snippets and bits of, but a problem upon which there has been no concerted attention, and I thank you for your work in bringing this kind of attention to this problem. The fact that we have a close relationship with a country should not mean that country is free from just and justifiable criticism, and Saudi Arabia has been an ally in many respects, but in many respects and increasingly, Saudi Arabia doesn't act like an ally. To be an ally, it seems to me, you have to walk like an ally, talk like an ally and act like an ally, and when it comes to the heartache that Saudi Arabia has brought to these mothers and their children not only is Saudi Arabia not an ally, it is not a friend. Certainly the country should not be immune to criticism, and we ought to call this issue what it is. This is a human rights issue, and this is a horrible violation of human rights. If it were done by a country that we did not have friendly relationships with, we'd be up and down screaming about kidnapping and outrageous behavior toward mothers and their children. We cannot allow a double standard to develop just because we're dealing with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is very adamant in sticking to its own standards, and it seems to me we are in violation of our standards and of our laws when we allow this to go on. And, Mr. Chairman, by bringing this to public attention, I think you are doing something for the first time that may in fact change this horrific condition, and once again, I thank you, sir. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Ms. Norton. Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I applaud you for holding this hearing and shining some light on a very serious situation. You know, one of the main jobs of our Embassies, of our personnel at the State Department is to protect our citizens and to uphold American law, and I think we've fallen short of this. I hope this hearing will give us a path where we can correct some of these egregious issues that have been raised over the years, and I applaud you for holding the hearings. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mr. Davis. Mr. Clay. Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to thank you also for conducting this hearing, and perhaps we can get to the bottom of some of these issues that we're going to hear more about today. I would like to submit an opening statement to you. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Duncan. Mr. Duncan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I'm not going to make a full statement. I'll simply say as Mr. Schrock did that I agree with everything that you said and that others have said thus far, and I thank you for calling this hearing. I would like to read something that was in last week's U.S. News and World Report, a column written by Michael Barone entitled, ``Our Enemies, The Saudis.'' He said ``15 of the 19 September 11th hijackers were Saudis. Perhaps as many as 80 percent of the prisoners held at Guantanamo are Saudis. Osama bin Laden is a Saudi and Al Qaeda was supported by large contributions from Saudis including members from the Saudi royal family. The Saudi's cooperation with our efforts to track down the financing of Al Qaeda appears to be somewhere between minimal and zero . . . .'' And it goes on with many, many examples of things that the Saudis have done or not done that they should have done, and he ends up by saying they are effectively waging war against us. Now, that is a very strong column by Michael Barone in last week's U.S. News and World Report, but there is this clamor in some corridors here to go to war against Iraq, with which I disagree, and I'm not saying we should go to war against Saudi Arabia. In fact, I wouldn't have written a column as strong as Michael Barone did, but I think it points out what many people have already mentioned, that this relationship with the Saudis is becoming very, very troublesome to this country, and the witnesses that are here today are the prime examples of these problems that have developed and are continuing. And so I think this is a very important hearing, and I thank you for calling the hearing. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Judge Duncan. Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. Maloney. Thank you, Chairman Burton, for calling what is a critically important hearing on an issue that is truly gender apartheid. And as we listen to the testimony of our distinguished guests here, we cannot really divorce the policies of Saudi Arabia from the policies that are in front of us. What they are going to be talking about are family disputes, but the values in Saudi Arabia are really very different from any other western country. The government restricts freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion and movement. And just to give an example, a few months ago there was a fire in a girl's religious school in Saudi Arabia, and the girls fled. Many of them did not have the abaya or the head dress to cover themselves. The religious police forced them back into the burning building to get the proper head dress, and some of them died. I believe this demonstrates the state of human rights that is really despicable in Saudi Arabia, and they practice gender apartheid. There are many places where women cannot go to eat. They can't go to lunch counters. They can't have identity cards. They can't vote and they can't drive. They are excluded from professions, and they are required to cover themselves, be shrouded with the abaya when they appear in public. And so when you talk about custody cases, which I'm sure we'll hear from our panel today, you can't divorce--these are not simply custody cases. This is a human rights violation. They don't follow the laws and human rights of other countries, and in many ways, practice violence against women. Recently along with Congressman Fossella, we did a letter to Secretary O'Neill, really calling on them to freeze the Saudi Arabian money here in the United States as we did with Iraqi money during the war, and this was based on their television broadcasts where they were literally appealing to their population to raise money for terrorist families, those who were giving their lives to murder innocent people in Israel. And I feel that you have to hold the country accountable to their actions, and I feel that--I hope that not only that most Members of Congress will join us in this important letter, that we take steps to hold them responsible for really collecting blood money to give to terrorist families. But I appreciate the efforts of our country to be helpful to American citizens who have suffered under this same type of gender apartheid that women suffer under every day in Saudi Arabia, and I look forward to the testimony. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Jo Ann Davis of Virginia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For the sake of time, I don't have a formal statement, but I will say that as a woman and as a mother, I'm outraged to hear what happened in our own Embassy, having a Marine escort their women and children out knowing they would be arrested, and I just certainly hope we on this committee do everything we can to correct the errors--potential errors that were made by our U.S. Embassy and that this does not happen to American citizens, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mrs. Davis. We now have a new member of the committee, and I want to welcome him to the committee, Congressman John Sullivan of Oklahoma. He was elected in a special election in January to replace our old buddy, Steve Largent, I think who is running for Governor out there. So we want to welcome you and we're looking forward to working with you and I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Sullivan be appointed to the Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Natural Resources and Regulatory Affairs, and I also ask unanimous consent that Congressman Dan Miller be removed from the Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Affairs, and with that, welcome to the committee and you're recognized. Mr. Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that, and I'm eager to hear your testimony, and I admire your courage for being here today. I have three kids, and I can just--I think it would be very difficult to be separated from them. As a new member of this committee and in the process of learning about these issues, I must say I was shocked to learn of not only the number of U.S. citizens detained against their will in Saudi Arabia, but the freedoms and liberties that are not allowed even though they are U.S. citizens. Not only do we have children being detained who are American citizens with no intervention from the U.S. Government on their behalf, we also have a complacent Federal Government allowing them to languish in these situations with years with no help. These children may be abused or subjected to restrictive religious practices or to a religion they do not claim. Their rights are null and void, especially for women and children. This is unconscionable that our government is not doing more to protect them. As a representative of the First District of Oklahoma, I speak for my constituents. Any of my constituents who would learn of such inaction by their own government for their safety would be appalled. My questions are their questions, such as why are there up to 92 U.S. citizens being held against their will in Saudi Arabia, and why is our government doing nothing? Why are we not doing a better job, at least checking to see that these children are being abused? Children cannot seek refuge in the U.S. Embassy without being returned to their Saudi parents. It is estimated that as many as half of the Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay are Saudi. A poll conducted by the Saudi Government estimated that 95 percent of Saudi men between the ages of 25 and 41 sympathize with Osama bin Laden. The Saudi Government refuses to fully cooperate in the investigation of many bombings. Religious freedom is forbidden by law, and women have few rights in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has recommended that Saudi Arabia be named a country of particular concern, placing it in a category with North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Sudan. State-owned media outlets are often full of anti- American and anti-Semitic propaganda. Calling the Saudi Government an ally is close to the old cliche, ``with friends like this, who needs enemies?'' We have sold out rights of a few for the safety of many, bartering away their rights in order to placate this government under the guise of making allies in the war against terrorism. If that is the case, we have started down the very slippery slope that allows anybody's rights to be rescinded for the good of the many, and our basis of freedom is and will be dually eroded. Certainly we must have allies, all of which we may not like, but we must decide where the line begins and ends in this regard, and does that line include advocating for each and every American citizen or not? And if not, why? Although the State Department conveniently defines these situations as private custody disputes, any time the rights of U.S. citizens are abridged, we must act. This level of complacency is not acceptable. I look forward to hearing the testimony and finding out what both the executive and collective branches can do to ensure the safe return of all U.S. citizens from any and all countries from which they desire to leave in order to return home to the United States. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. Mrs. Maloney has something she'd like to put in the record. Mrs. Maloney. I request unanimous consent to put in the record an article about the 15 girls who died in a school when the religious police would not permit them to leave, one of the police said, ``it is sinful to approach them.'' And I would like to put this in the record and just briefly add that we will hear from our witnesses today about terrible discrimination and their custody suits, and we as a government must hold the Saudi Government accountable for these irresponsible acts of shielding kidnappers and abusive fathers and husbands from prosecution. And I, again, thank the chairman for having this meeting. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mrs. Maloney. We will without objection put this in the record. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. Mrs. Morella. Mrs. Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the courtesy of allowing me to make a very brief opening statement. Thank you for having this very important hearing. In 1991, a powerful movie entitled, ``Not Without My Daughter'' awakened many American's eyes to the harsh realities and inequities of life in Iran, especially for women. This film was based on a book by Betty Mahmoody, an American housewife who risked torture and death to escape from Iran with her young daughter, Mahtob in 1986. Sadly, there are three individuals gathered here today who could tell harrowing tales of their experience with Saudi Arabian inequity and whose stories would be equally powerful if made into movies, rather unbelievable. The events of September 11 and the discovery that 15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and that many Al Qaeda operatives are Saudi-born have led much of the American public and many U.S. officials to probe deeper into our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And not only are many U.S. officials looking more closely at the U.S.- Saudi relationship, but many are also looking closely at the conditions inside Saudi Arabia. Just the other day I chaired a congressional human rights caucus hearing on the role of women in Saudi Arabia and mention was certainly made of the young women who were burned to death. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has recommended that Saudi Arabia be named a country of particular concern, placing it in a category with North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Sudan. And as Chairman Burton pointed out in his testimony, one particularly unjust aspect of our relationship with Saudi Arabia is that U.S. citizens can be held against their will with the full blessing of the Saudi Government, and often in violation of U.S. law. And while some noble individuals within the State Department have tried to remedy the problem, the United States has, in many cases, subverted attempts to reunite families. In addition, the Saudi Arabian Government has done little to rectify any disputes between families. The three witnesses on the first panel that you've assembled, Mr. Chairman, will give more details about their tragic plights in trying to reunite with family members. I only hope that their words which have, for many years fallen on deaf ears, will finally be heard by the United States and Saudi Governments. I yield back the balance of my time, and again, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mrs. Morella. [The prepared statement of Hon. Constance A. Morella follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. Mr. Shays. Mr. Shays. No statement, Mr. Chairman. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank you for having this hearing, but I don't have a statement. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Mr. Shays. I'd just like to say to the witnesses, one of the reasons that we have everyone make opening statements is it sends a very clear message to the Saudi Government that this is not just the chairman's position or the ranking member's position, but the entire membership of the committee, and I believe the entire membership of the Congress. So if the Saudi Government is paying any attention to what is going on today, this isn't just me or Mr. Waxman; this is the attitude of the U.S. Congress, in my opinion, and I think if you talk to all 435 Members, you'd get the same answer, that we want American laws recognized, and we want the Saudi Government to work with us and comply and not to allow kidnappers to take these kids out of the country and never return them and to treat the mothers like dirt. And if they don't get that message today, I presume they never will, but we are looking forward to hearing your testimony. With that, we swear in our witnesses so that we have everything on the record and under oath. So would you please rise and raise your hands. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Burton. Our first panel is Pat Roush, Ethel Stowers, Miriam Hernandez-Davis and Dria Davis. We welcome you here. We'll start off now with Ms. Roush first. Ms. Roush, you're welcome to make an opening statement. STATEMENTS OF PATRICIA ROUSH, MOTHER OF ALIA AND AISHA GHESHAYAN; DRIA DAVIS, ACCOMPANIED BY HER MOTHER, MIRIAM HERNANDEZ-DAVIS; AND ETHEL STOWERS, MOTHER OF MONICA STOWERS, AND GRANDMOTHER OF RASHEED AND AMJAD RADWAN Ms. Roush. Good morning, Chairman Burton, and members of the committee. I'm pleased to participate in this panel and present you with my testimony. Terrorism takes on many forms, and for 16\\1/2\\ years, my two American daughters, Alia and Aisha Gheshayan and I, have been victims of the worst emotional, psychological and spiritual terrorism possible. We have been separated from each other by two systems of evil that have broken the moral law that governs all human beings. My daughters have been taken hostage by a medieval totalitarian system, and the central authority of our government, the U.S. Department of State, has done everything to enable that system to destroy the lives of my beloved daughters and shatter my family. I have previously testified before the House International Relations Committee in 1987, Subcommittee for the Near East, concerning violations of human rights of American citizens by the Saudi Arabian Government. The honorable Tom Lantos was Chair, and his very powerful words addressing Assistant Secretary of State Marion Creekmore continue to remain with me. ``Is this the image that you want to portray of the United States, that of the impotent giant that cannot get back two little innocent children from Saudi Arabia?'' Secretary Creekmore's response was, I don't think the withholding of visas to the United States for Saudis is the proper way to resolve this. By way of background, for the last 16 years, I have tirelessly pioneered the issue of American children kidnapped and taken abroad. My relentless efforts over the years led to the creation of the Office of Children's Issues at the State Department in 1987, and to the enactment of the International Parental Kidnapping Act in 1993. The Hague Treaty on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction was signed in 1987 by the United States because of the high profile of my case in the Congress and the press. The Office of Children's Issues unfortunately has never been what it was intended to be, which is a place of authority that U.S. citizens can turn to for assistance when their children are abducted to a foreign country. Instead, it is merely another file and data collecting agency of the Federal Government. Working to free my daughters has become a mission- impossible assignment that I have accepted as part of my daily life. Before my two daughters were kidnapped, my 7-year-old would sing with such delight, ``Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you tomorrow. It is only a day away.'' This was her favorite song from the movie Annie about a little girl who was lost and found. But the happy ending from the Hollywood movie never materialized for my little girls, and as the Arabic folk expression states, 20 years will soon be tomorrow, became their reality. The girls are now women, ages 23 and 19. They were kidnapped and taken to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia by their Saudi national father in 1986. They were 3 and 7 at the time. This is a father they hardly knew and feared, who had a documented history of a severe mental illness with a paranoid and violent ideation. He has been their master for almost 17 years. They fear him and have learned to submit and suffocate themselves to his demands. Saudi Arabia has violated my human rights and the human rights and Constitutional rights afforded to my daughters as American citizens. The U.S. State Department is an accessory and active conspirator in the denial of these rights. The U.S. Government receives benefits from the Saudi Arabian Government in various forms, which induces to violate these rights. Everyone is entitled to freedom from fear. The U.S. State Department and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have both intentionally used their great power to create fear to intimidate and threaten my daughters and me. My daughters are victims of forced religious conversion as outlined in the International Religious Freedom Act. My Christian daughters were forced to convert to Islam, and as you know, religious choice is not an option in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They could be put to death if they even spoke the name of Jesus. This is also an act of ethnocide. My daughters have had their culture and society taken away and been denied their heritage. Do they know that their mother's family has been on the U.S. soil since 1711 and fought in all the wars to keep America free? Do they even know what freedom is? My daughters have been stolen and kept in captivity for 16 years incommunicado with the entire western world. They have no knowledge of the rest of the world except by way of Saudi Arabian censored television and the males that are their masters. They are denied the rule of law, denial of due process. Saudi Arabia is a totalitarian state where my daughters are locked up, wrapped up and shut up. This is a cover picture from National Geographic magazine showing that well-known photograph of a young green-eyed Afghan girl on the cover 20 years ago, now wearing the dreaded burqa. The caption says, found. And this is a picture of what my daughters are wearing today, basic black from head to toe. They have no choice. The Saudi Religious Police can arrest, imprison or kill them for not wearing this garb. This little insert picture of my little girls in the white dresses with puffed sleeves is 17 years old. It is the last picture I have of them. Underneath the picture it also says, ``found.'' Yes, we found them, but they were never lost. We always knew just where they were but couldn't save them from their destiny which is no different from the destiny of this poor Afghan woman. They are also condemned to a life behind a vail without any rights, the life of silence, submission and servitude. They are treated as Saudi women, not American women living in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Government doesn't even recognize their American citizenship. They are the property of their husbands. They can be put to death by these men if the men so choose to dispose of them. It is called honor killing, and the price of honor in Saudi Arabia for women is quite steep. The State Department called me yesterday to--yesterday was my 56th birthday. My girls were kidnapped when I was 39. The State Department called me on my 56th birthday to tell me that my youngest daughter Aisha was sold to a man that she hardly knew. This selling of my youngest daughter was in retaliation because their father and the Saudi Government knew about this hearing. President Bush has created a special White House liaison for Afghan women's rights, but there is no one in the entire U.S. Government working for my daughter's rights, an American woman locked up in Saudi Arabia. No, I am told that there is nothing the U.S. Government can do for them, because under Saudi law, their father, and now their husbands, have total power and control over them. And even Allah, himself cannot help them. Contrary to the statements appearing in the Saudi-owned press, Asharq Al Awsat, listed on the official Web site of the Saudi Embassy, SaudiEmbassy.net, which recently published a very biased, slanderous article about me concocted by the Saudi Government and Gheshayan. These are American women not ``Saudi daughters.'' The Saudi Government continues infantile employs to place this ordeal and my daughters in the middle of an international chess match. The playing field is far from even, and they have a great advantage, the physical possession of my daughters and my unborn grandchild, yes, I found out by reading this Saudi-owned newspaper that I will be a grandmother. I have no knowledge of the well-being or status of my daughters, none. And the little bit of information I have gotten over the years has been second-hand. National Review Magazine posed the question to Prince Abdullah in April when he was in Crawford with the President. The caption over their little pound puppy photo read ``hey Abdullah, how are the girls?' I wish I knew how they are. The State Department claims that when these child victims of international parental abduction become 18 years of age, the interest of the State Department doesn't end. The concerns of these now adult American citizens are undertaken by the Office of American Citizens Services until the American parent no longer requests intervention. My daughters are 23 and 19 years of age and know one has seen either of them since they turned 18. When they were children, the State Department only saw them three times in 14 years. If they were prisoners in a Riyadh jail, the State Department, the Embassy would have seen them more times then because they were upheld by their Saudi Arabian father. Is this how the State Department shows their concern for American citizens? In fact, the State Department staff have admitted--I'm sorry. In 1986, just 10 months after the girls were kidnapped, the Riyadh Governors' office and the American Embassy worked out a deal to have the girls released. This was due to the tremendous pressure in the U.S. Senate organized by former U.S. Senator, Allan Dixon of Illinois. The Governor of Riyadh's office was going to allow the girls to leave the kingdom and his representative Saleh Hejeilan was making all the arrangements. He only requested the presence of the then U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Walter Cutler at the meeting in the Governors office. I was in constant communication with the DCM of the mission, Edward Walker. He told me, Pat, the Embassy telexed us twice this week. They will not allow the Ambassador to go into the meeting. I have telexes from the State Department to the Embassy telling them to remain, ``impartial and neutral.'' Hejeilan then told me your government doesn't want you. Your State Department will not help you. You will see your children if and when we decide. He then videotaped my young daughters like prisoners on display, all within the presence of the American Council general, who remained silent. He later told me that my 8-year-old daughter, Alia, was forced to say on tape that she hated her mother and the United States. Her eyes had a wild glazed look and she looked terrorized. The Saudis then began to systematically put me through a 16-year torture with one lie and broken promise after the other. They delighted in this sadistic game and used their control over the lives of my daughters to taunt me. Another time Hejeilan told me you are being punished for going to the politicians and the press. In 1995, U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Raymond Mabus began a campaign to help me. He is a true hero, a man of integrity who stood up to the Saudis and got me into the kingdom to see my girls. He went to every Saudi prince, including Crown Prince Abdullah for the release of my daughters. I was only able to see the girls once for 2 hours, but they told me they loved me and asked me to take them out of there. They were 16 and 13 at the time, terribly emotionally abused by their father. The Saudis wouldn't allow me to see them again, and I spent 21 days of heart wrenching pain inside a hotel room in Riyadh. But Ray Mabus called me in the hotel room and he said, Pat you go home and remember that there are people in this Embassy who care about you and your girls. I will do everything to get your daughters back to California. He held up the visas to the United States of my ex- husband's family, which is a very effective tool. He received a diplomatic note from Prince Saud bin Faisal, Saudi foreign minister allowing the girls to come home for the summer of 1996. Mabus also got a quid pro quo from Crown Prince Abdullah, the release of the girls for the saving the life of one of his generals, a relative of Gheshayan who needed treatment for cancer. It was finished, a done deal. But it wasn't finished yet. Mabus told me he was going to resign as Ambassador for personal reasons. I was in agony. I knew what would happen. Mabus reassured me and said Pat, don't worry. I have made believers out of these guys at the Embassy. I will fully brief the incoming Ambassador, who is also a political appointee. Nothing is going to happen, Pat. We are at the finish line. I wish I could be here when they come home, but I have to go back to Mississippi. In August 1996, Wyche Fowler, Jr., the new political appointee arrived in Riyadh as U.S. Ambassador. Ray Mabus fully briefed him on the urgency of the situation. I sent him a long detailed fax concerning the background of--and what Mabus had accomplished and what we needed to do. No response. I called Fowler and asked if he had received my faxes. He denied receiving them. I explained that we needed his help. Ray Mabus was on the verge of getting my girls out of Saudi Arabia and it was up to him to just make the contact for us. It was finished, all wrapped up. We had the promise of the Crown Prince. My girls could come home. He said to me Ms. Roush, I am in the middle of an Iraqi war here and I don't have the time right now to deal with this. I am aware of your situation and you are not doing any bit one good by cross- examining me. He dismissed me like an impertinent school girl who was way out of line by even speaking to him. He lifted the visa censorship of the Gheshayan family, the only effective tool I had to persuade the Gheshayan family to return my girls. No, Wyche Fowler had other things to do which didn't include the release of my girls. The Glasgow Evening Times quoted that this 55-year-old married, newly assigned U.S. Ambassador was having an affair with a 24-year-old Scottish woman he had met on a plane that summer. All he had to do was go back to the Crown Prince and finish the deal Mabus had set up. He told my lawyer, ``the deal is dead. Pat Roush can either come here and see her daughters another time or she can let the chips fall where they will.'' My attorney said to Fowler that means the girls are forgotten then. Why not do what Ray Mabus did? And Fowler replied why not get Ray Mabus then. You seem to get my name in the papers. The ball is in your court. The Saudis trust me. Take it or leave it. Wyche Fowler was in Saudi Arabia for 6 years. He lobbied hard for that job and made a lot of money. He is now the grand statesman about town, the Mideast expert and chairman of the board of the Mideast Institute. He gives speeches, goes to dinner parties and I am sure has many Saudi friends. He appears on television as an expert on Saudi Arabia. His wife divorced him after that Scottish-girl incident. He should be held responsible for what he did to my family. He is a criminal and condemned my daughters. He is responsible for the marriages of both of my daughters. If he had done the right thing in 1996, they would have never been married. He has cost us 7 more years of hell. It would have been so easy for him to finish the job Mabus started. What was the downside for him? The Bible states that the measure you give is the measure you shall receive and you shall be known as you are known. Both of Gheshayan's parents came into the United States for medical treatment from American doctors and nurses when they became ill. They used U.S. medical technology to try to save their lives, and in the meantime, kept my daughters away from me without so much as a phone call. I would call their house to speak with my girls and they would hang up on me. They came in with diplomatic passports, accompanied by their international criminal son who broke U.S. law, even after there were U.S. State and Federal warrants issued for his arrest. He was allowed to enter the United States on a diplomatic passport with his father. They made a mockery of U.S. law. If Members of Congress are so concerned about the human rights and fair treatment of Saudi al Qaeda killer prisoners held in Cuba and even make special trips to inspect that facility at Guantanamo, why aren't they outraged about what has happened to my daughters? Why don't they make an exchange? My innocent daughters for the Saudi al Qaeda killers? If President Bush can advocate for the release of Lori Berenson, an American woman jailed in Peru for suspected terrorism, why can't he pick up the phone and call Crown Prince Abdullah and ask that my innocent daughters be allowed to come home? My daughters are forced to live in a society where 15 young Saudi school girls were burned alive because they were wearing the wrong clothing. The religious police forced them back into an inferno. My daughters could have been in that fire. This is a recent story in the Italian press about a little girl with an Italian mother and an Algerian father who was taken to the Italian Embassy in Algiers by her mother for asylum. The child remained inside the Italian Embassy for 2 years while the Italian Government negotiated for her release with the Algerian authorities. She was just taken back to Italy on an Italian military aircraft. That is how much her government cared about her. I am asking for your help and the help of the entire U.S. Congress to free my daughter and Alia's baby. The State Department must issue a Demarche to the Saudi Arabian authorities to have my family returned to America immediately. This is a moral decision of conscience. As Moses pleaded with the obdurate heart of the Egyptian pharaoh for the release of his people, I am beseeching you, let my family go. Saudi foreign minister Prince Saud bin Faisal is coming into town today or tomorrow. It would be a great opportunity for Members to approach him, a telephone call from him can release my daughters tonight. I am now authoring a book entitled, ``At Any Price, How America Betrayed My Kidnapped Daughter for Saudi Oil,'' available in February 2003. Remember there are no hopeless situations. There are only men who have grown hopeless about them. Thank you. Mr. Burton. Thank you, Ms. Roush. [The prepared statement of Ms. Roush follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. Gosh, it's hard to believe those kinds of things happen, especially with the government we have and the State Department people who are here will carry the message back very loud and clear, and we will write a letter; I will author a letter to the President asking him to impose a limitation on passports for anybody that is involved in any kind of a kidnapping, like the one you involved, and I want you to draft that letter today. And we'll get as many Members to sign it and we'll see if we can't go back to what Mr. Mabus did and impose every kind of block that we can to keep Saudis out of this country if they're involved in any kind of activity like that. Mr. Ose. Mr. Chairman, if I may. Mr. Burton. OK, Mr. Ose, go ahead. Mr. Ose. Ms. Davis has a son also in Saudi Arabia, if I recall correctly from the testimony. There were two testimonies that I read last night, one involving Ms. Roush's daughters and another involving a son and a daughter of an American citizen. I would hope that the letter we are going to draft will address both those situations. As memory serves, both children are--in the second case are now in the United States. But this should be very focused on the Saudi---- Mr. Burton. We'll be very focused on these individuals. But we want the letter to encompass others who are not here to be able to speak for themselves who--we have something like 92 people that we know of right now. We haven't gotten all the documents from the Saudi Embassy over there, our Embassy in Saudi Arabia, but there are 92 people that we believe are being held along with the ones we are talking about today. We have a tape of Monica Stowers that was prepared at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh a couple of weeks ago. The tape arrived in the United States yesterday but we received it just 25 minutes before the hearing because the State Department wanted to watch it and copy it before they gave it to us. I don't know why they wanted to do that. We could let them have a copy after we saw it. But nevertheless, they wanted to see it first. I presume they may have wanted to censor it so Congress couldn't see everything. Nevertheless, we got it. Therefore, we haven't had a chance to review it fully. It's 25 minutes long and all of it is highly relevant and deeply moving. We're going to play the first 10 minutes of it and while the hearing is going on, we'll see if there are some other segments that are very important that we should play. So will you play the first 10 minutes? And I want all the members of the committee and everybody in the audience to pay particular attention to this. I know it is a lengthy hearing. We are hearing a lot of testimony from the witnesses, but this is a very special case and we're going beyond our normal 5 minutes testimony because we think it is so special. So will you roll the tape. [Portion of videotape played.] Mr. Burton. We're going to review the last 15 minutes of this, but I think we all have a pretty good idea of the tragedy that occurred. I can't believe this. I cannot believe this. I just--who is the next witness? Mrs. Stowers, Mrs. Stowers, do you want to make your statement now and then we'll go to questions after we hear from Ms. Hernandez-Davis. Mrs. Stowers, you are recognized to make a statement if you like. Do you want to make a statement or do you think you can? Mrs. Stowers. I came here today to plead for my daughter and my granddaughter's life. My granddaughter's father has threatened to destroy her as soon as he can get Monica out of the country. He wants to have her--he wants to kill her because she won't marry anybody that he chooses for her at age 12, he tried to marry her. Well, he did marry her off to an older man, a terrorist. And she ran away. But he keeps chiding with Monica that as soon as she leaves Saudi Arabia to come to the United States for treatment--my daughter has cancer--that he will destroy Amjad because she disobeyed him. We haven't been able to get any help for her, Monica and my granddaughter. She's at the mercy of people that hate us and want to kill us. I'm sorry. Mr. Burton. No, that's fine. Mrs. Stowers. I'm just so upset about this whole thing. Our family has been totally destroyed by the Radwan family in Saudi Arabia, by the children's own father. They have been beaten and raped and my grandson went to the police in Riyadh and asked them for help. He asked them to please get his father to stop the rape and the beatings. His answer was, you have to learn how to obey your father. They stripped his shirt off, threw him on the ground and beat him and kept him in jail for 2 days. And then when he was sent home, his father beat him again and threatened to kill him. Rasheed has had two mental breakdowns and he finally escaped from Saudi Arabia and he lived with me in Houston. The horrible nightmares that Rasheed had, he couldn't function as a normal human being. In the middle of the night, he had these horrible nightmares. But he was able to get some treatment and he did finish high school, and one semester at the University of Houston. He had to go back to Saudi Arabia. He had to try to take care of his mother because she was so sick. She's been destroyed by this. This whole thing. She tries to protect her daughter and she would die for her daughter. We have begged the State Department, our Senators and our Congress for help. We got nothing but silence. There was nothing they could do. Why is it that the Saudis can ask for the U.S. Army to protect them, but they can't protect our children? They can't help our children. Can anyone tell me why they can't do something for our children? Please. Help our children. My daughter, I think she said it all on this tape. She needs to come to the States to get cancer treatment. I wouldn't have recognized her out on the street she's so sick. Mr. Burton. Ms Stowers. Mrs. Stowers. But she will not leave her daughter. Mr. Burton. Well, Ms. Stowers, Ms. Stowers, can you hear me. Mrs. Stowers. But I'm pleading with someone to help us please. Mr. Burton. Can you hear me. Can you hear me now? We will convey your feelings in correspondence and directly with the President. We'll try to get information to him today. I'm supposed to be down at the White House at 4. I'm going to have a letter prepared covering these issues and I will give it to him today and we will not let this rest. We will continue to push, I promise you, as long as I'm chairman, we'll do everything we can to get this resolved. [The prepared statement of Mrs. Stowers follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. We'll now go to Ms. Hernandez-Davis for your testimony. Ms. Hernandez-Davis. Good morning, Chairman Burton, members of the committee. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this panel, present you with my devastating experience trying to rescue my daughter out of captivity in Saudi Arabia. My daughter, formerly known as Yasmin and now known as Dria, was taken against her will to Saudi Arabia at the age of 11 and forced to live there until she was rescued 2 years later. She endured a great deal of physical emotional abuse and religious persecution by her Saudi father and his family. She is, to my knowledge, the only American child kidnapped to Saudi Arabia that has escaped. The Saudi Government as well as the American government, the State Department and the American Embassy, never helped me with my daughter's release. Dria was one more case, one more file, one more American child taken to Saudi Arabia never to be seen again. While held against her will in Saudi Arabia, my daughter was beaten to say she was Muslim. She was scared into thinking that she and her Christian family would burn in the flames of hell. Because she would not conform and pray, she had to eat on the floor. Dria was neglected and unattended because she would not say she was Muslim. My daughter's spirit was stronger than her Saudi father and family expected. Every night she prayed a simple prayer her grandmother taught her in Spanish and she hung on to her faith. The American Embassy in Riyadh warned me that if I reported the abuse, it would only get worse. It is common practice for Saudi fathers to beat or mistreat their children and their wives. While in Saudi Arabia, Dria's letters, cards, pictures that she had of her family, friends and of me were taken by her father and destroyed. During her many hidden telephone calls to the United States, Dria told me that she was scared she could not picture my face anymore. She was forgetting what I looked like. She sounded more and more depressed and told me she would rather die than to continue to live in Saudi Arabia. Her situation was deteriorating and no one was helping. I was naive in thinking that my country would help protect its citizens. Dria was an American citizen whose rights had been clearly violated. My protest in front of the White House and foreign Embassies, with parents of other missing children, letter writing campaigns addressing foreign officials, communications with the State Department, and American Embassy in Riyadh did nothing to elicit response that could help me with the release of my daughter. It took a year to plan Dria's escape from Saudi Arabia. My mother and I had to sell our home, furniture, empty our savings account in order to finance Dria's escape from hell. This extremely brave 12-year-old knew that her life was in danger if caught. Knew that she would be beaten to death by her father if the plan failed. But she did whatever she had to do in order to escape. All that mattered to her was getting home, getting her life back. How did this devastating experience begin? In 1984, I married what seemed to be a very nice, chivalrous young man, a graduate of the University of Miami that was born and raised in Saudi Arabia. Khalid Shalhoub had been living in the United States for 8 years and was very Americanized. He intended to continue to live in the United States once we married. I lived in Saudi Arabia for a year and a half. It was meant to be temporary, but my Saudi husband changed his mind once we were there and wanted to make the stay permanent. He went from being very Americanized and liberal while living in the United States to joining in on the hate rhetoric for Israel and the Jews prevailing the Middle East. He even went so far as to argue that the Holocaust never existed; it was conjured up by the Jews to gain sympathy. While in Saudi, I was shocked to see how women were treated. Women in Saudi Arabia are treated as second class citizens and as a possession of their father or husband. They have no rights. And they have little or inferior education. Their marriages are arranged and they may be forced to marry as young as age 12. They are forced to wear black abayas and cover head to toe. Their religious police have the right to use whips or stones to beat women in public who they think are not properly dressed or attracting attention. Women are not allowed in certain places of business or in certain restaurants in Saudi Arabia. Women can't play sports, go for a walk, read a magazine about what's going on in the world because of the extreme censorship of materials, magazines, news, etc. Living in Saudi Arabia poisoned my marriage with Khalid. I managed to return to the United States when I was pregnant with Dria knowing that if I mentioned divorce in Saudi Arabia, I would not be allowed to leave. I was stunned to find out the men had to give their wives, daughters, sisters written permission to leave the country or to travel, no matter how old they are. Khalid and I were divorced in Miami when Dria was 2 years old. Khalid felt humiliated by the divorce because it was I, the woman, who initiated the divorce, not he. In Saudi Arabia, it is customary that men divorce their wives, or just take on another wife. As a result, he vowed that he would make me pay for what I had done to him. He would take our daughter to Saudi Arabia and never allow me to see her again. Although I had custody of Dria and was raising her with little or no help from Khalid, the family court in Miami awarded him unrestricted travel when Dria was 6. The family court judge was well aware of Khalid's threats and was not concerned with the fact that I had no recourse if Khalid chose to take Dria to Saudi and keep her there. Khalid began to take Dria on trips to London when she was 8 years old. London was his place of residence at the time. He enjoyed the freedom and lack of restrictions that he could not have in Saudi Arabia. Every time he took her on a trip, I worried and prayed that he would bring her back. The day I dreaded finally arrived when Khalid called me from Saudi Arabia in August 1997 and told me I had a few minutes to talk to my daughter. He did not know how long he would keep Dria or if I would ever see her again. I briefly spoke to my daughter who had no clue what was going on. And I got to say that I loved her. I pleaded with him to meet me in Europe so that we could discuss his decision. We were both parents and needed to do what was best for Dria. He laughed in an evil way and hung up. It took the FBI about a month to write a report. I even had to show them a copy of the Federal law that Khalid had broken. It took the U.S. attorneys office 1 year to prosecute Khalid and charge him with the international kidnapping. I was a relentless nag that did not give up. It seemed that the issue of kidnapping a child by a parent was completely acceptable, and an issue that most officials were not interested in dealing with. The prosecutor that handled my case told me they did not want to take on these types of cases to the Grand Jury because they don't make an arrest, and these type of cases hurt their department statistically. The State Department's Office of Children's Issues' role in the kidnapping of my daughter was to keep a file on the case, send me a packet on international abductions and recommend to the American Embassy in Riyadh to conduct a welfare and whereabouts visit. Letters to officials should have been written on her behalf but were not. I also asked the State Department to give me a list of other parents' names and contact numbers whose children had also been kidnapped to Saudi Arabia. And if that was not possible, I asked them to give out my name and phone number to those parents. For some reason, the State Department did not want to see parents uniting in a common cause. The first and only welfare and whereabouts visit that the American Embassy conducted on my daughter took place in a hotel lobby in Riyadh and was controlled by Khalid. He initially agreed to the visit by the American Embassy consul because he wanted to be in good standing with them in case he wanted to travel to the United States. He did not know yet that he could be arrested. Dria was threatened by her father to act and say certain things or a beating would follow did she not comply. The American Embassy should have negotiated with Khalid during this meeting or even pressured him. Khalid's travel restrictions hurt him and he could have--this could have been a negotiating point. He loved to travel throughout Europe for pleasure and for business. The Saudi Arabian Government does not issue tourist visas and does not admit mothers seeking to visit their abducted children unless the Saudi father provides a letter of no objection. By some miracle and constant pressure from Congressman Diaz-Balart's office, the Saudi Embassy issued me a visa in February 1989 without the consent of my former husband. My passport, however, indicated that he was sponsoring me, even though he was unaware of this consent. I had to travel with my uncle as my male chaperone. Once in Saudi Arabia, I was naive to think the American Embassy would help Dria and me leave the country. After all, the American Embassy had a copy of my daughter's passport on file, documentation showing that I had custody and that my former husband had broken State and Federal laws when he kidnapped her. Everyone at the Embassy and State Department was aware that Dria's case was different. She was almost 12, had been raised in the United States and was set in her religion, was very happy in school and terribly wanted to go home. Her rights were clearly violated. She wanted her life back. I asked Sally Beth Brumbrey, the consul and first secretary at the time, to help me bring my daughter home. I asked the following questions: If Dria could get to the Embassy on her own, would I be able to take her home? If Dria and I were able to meet anywhere in the country or close to the Bahrain border, would the American Embassy help us get through? If Dria and I were able to go to the U.S. military base in Saudi Arabia, would the military help us get out? I posed many different scenarios that would lead to getting my daughter out of Saudi. I was simply told the American Embassy and its officials were guests in Saudi Arabia and no one could risk doing anything of that nature. Sally Beth Brumbrey, I learned, was leaving Riyadh shortly for a new position in Australia and could not afford to risk her job. Other consul associated offered no help. During my 1-month stay in Saudi Arabia, Khalid agreed to let me see my daughter under strict supervision five times. I was threatened not to hug her, whisper or show any emotion that would suggest I wanted her home with me. Khalid went on to threaten me that in Saudi Arabia he was the law. He would choose whether or not I would see my daughter again. I understood that she could never leave the country even as adult woman. Luckily, my daughter and I were able to speak in Spanish, accomplished much in those short five meetings. But I could not describe in words how hard it was to leave my daughter in Saudi Arabia and hear her beg me to take her. She cried and told me, ``mom, don't leave me here, I want to come home. I miss Abuela. I want to be with you, mom. I can't stay here 1 more day. Please don't leave me.'' All I could say and had time to say was to be patient and strong. The same way that I sneaked in to see you and let you know that I have not abandoned you or given up, I'll find a way to get you out I am not going to leave you here, I promise. I wanted to protect her from everything she was going through, the pain she was enduring, but I couldn't and my government was not helping us. Dria has been home safely for 3 years. She was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress when she came home and still has trouble sleeping. We fear that Khalid, who is currently being represented by several attorneys in the United States, will get his charges dropped and come after us. The number of cases of children and women kidnapped and kept hostage in Saudi Arabia is now too alarming to ignore. American citizens, especially our young citizens of the future, need to be protected at all costs. Thank you. Mr. Burton. These are all heart rending stories. [The prepared statement of Ms. Hernandez-Davis follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Burton. Would you like to make a statement now that you're back? Ms. Dria Davis. Yes. Mr. Burton. Well, we'll recognize you and you can tell us what you went through in trying to get out of Saudi Arabia. Would you pull the mic close to you. Would you also tell us how you were able to get her out or would you rather not? I mean, is that--if that is going to endanger somebody else maybe we shouldn't know. Maybe it shouldn't be made public. Ms. Hernandez-Davis. No. Some of it has been published and you know, the generality of it. Whenever she was able to call me, we had many, many plans for about a year. And if I could get to talk to her I could tell her OK leave. You have to leave at 2 a.m., try to get your dad's keys sneak out of the house. There'll be people waiting for you. There were many plans. Mr. Burton. You did that in Spanish. Ms. Hernandez-Davis. Yes, because they were taping our conversation. Mr. Burton. He didn't speak Spanish? Ms. Hernandez-Davis. No. And one of those occasions, one of those plans finally hit. I would get called sometimes, you know, she couldn't get out. No she couldn't get out and it was just heartbreaking. But on one occasion, I did get to speak to her and the plan was well on the way. Her father dropped her at her school and she had an abaya so that she could cover. What she was supposed to do was go into the school, act as if she was fumbling in her bookcase. Put on the abaya, pretend she was walking out past two security guards as if she left something in her dad's car. And she did just that. The security guard called her back but she just kept walking and she went toward a car that had a sign on it. You know, they had a little red ribbon around the antenna. That was the car she was supposed to get into. And then they had to keep her from being caught for about 4 hours. In that 4- hour period if she was caught--she could have potentially been caught but she was very smart in calling the American--no, she called her father and told her father that she was at the American Embassy and she was not coming back. So while he called the American Embassy and figured out that she wasn't there, that covered the 4 hours that you know we needed to get her safely out, and she went to Bahrain, passed the border there, dressed as a woman, a Saudi woman, someone's wife, and they didn't question it. She was very tall at the time and they couldn't uncover her to make sure. And basically that is how she got out. Mr. Burton. And it cost you $180,000? Ms. Hernandez-Davis. Yes. Mr. Burton. OK. You want to testify. Go ahead. Would you pull the mic a little closer? Thank you. Ms. Dria Davis. Good morning, Chairman Burton and members of the committee, my name is Alexandria Davis. I was formerly known as Yasmin Alexandria Shalhoub. My name no longer reflects my Saudi father's last name as a result of the nightmare I experienced when I was held against my will in Saudi Arabia from June 1997 to April 7, 1999. I changed my name to try to forget--to help me forget what I had to endure in Saudi Arabia, but it will be with me until I die. At the time I was kidnapped, I was an 11-year-old living in Miami with my mother and grandmother. I was attending Epiphany Catholic School in Miami and did what most girls do. I enjoyed swimming with my friends, jumping on the trampoline, rollerblading, taking care of my pets and I played soccer with a local YMCA team. I attended church on Sundays, as that was also part of my religious "
