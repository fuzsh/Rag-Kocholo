        "text": "The Ministry of Media is the entity responsible for overseeing the content of visual, audio, and printed media in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Its responsibilities include developing the national media system, issuing, renewing, and canceling media licenses, and promoting the identity of the Kingdom.\n\nThe formal regulation of the Saudi media sector began for the first time in the Kingdom with a decision from the Founding King, Abdulaziz Bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, to establish Umm al-Qura Newspaper in 1924. This was about eight years before the declaration of the Kingdom's unification. Umm al-Qura published all decisions and statements issued by the state concerning citizens. Subsequently, a decision was made to establish the Saudi Radio in 1949 to connect the Kingdom with the outside world. In 1955, a decision was made to name the radio as the General Directorate of Radio. Four years later, the Law of Printed Material and Publication was issued, and the General Directorate of Press and Publication was established, leading the ministry to its current state.\n\nHistory of the Ministry of Media\n\nThe Ministry of Media was established during the rule of King Saud Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in 1963. Prince Faisal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, then-crown prince, issued a decree transforming the General Directorate of Press and Publication into a ministry named the Ministry of Media. In 2003, a decision was made by the Council of Ministers to change its name to the Ministry of Culture and Media. It then was reverted to its original name, the Ministry of Media, in 2018.\n\nOver approximately sixty-two years, until 2023, fourteen ministers have served at the helm of the Ministry of Media. The first person to hold the position of minister of media in the Kingdom was Jameel al-Hujailan.\n\nThe Ministry of Media is headed by a minister who is appointed by a Royal Order and is a member of the Council of Ministers. The ministry coordinates its operations from its main headquarters in the capital, Riyadh, and manages the media system in the Kingdom in collaboration with several entities, mainly the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), the Saudi Broadcasting Authority, the General Commission for Audiovisual Media, and the Center for Government Communication.\n\nRole of the Ministry of Media\n\nThe ministry works to promote and preserve the Saudi identity, spread the true Islamic image and values in the life of the Saudi citizen, and showcase the Kingdom's achievements and positive role in various regional and international forums and events.\n\nThe ministry also contributes to raising awareness about the Kingdom's roles on local, regional, Islamic, and global levels. It also counters any misleading information about the Kingdom.\n\nThe development of the media system in the Kingdom\n\nThe Saudi media system is marked by significant historical milestones throughout its journey. These include the start of the first local radio broadcast from Jeddah's station in 1949, the beginning of the official television broadcast in black and white from both Riyadh and Jeddah stations in 1965, the establishment of the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) in 1971, and the first colored broadcast in the Kingdom from Jeddah television station in 1974.\n\nThe controls for carrying out media activities, the media policy in the Kingdom, the Law of Printed Material and Publication and its executive regulations, and the executive regulation for electronic publishing activity represent the most prominent legal foundations for the ministry's work."
