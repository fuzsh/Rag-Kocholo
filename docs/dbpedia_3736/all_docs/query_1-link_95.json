        "text": "For nearly nine decades since the founding of the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, the title of king has passed from its first ruler, Abdulaziz ibn Saud, to a succession of aging sons.\n\nA peaceful transition has remained critical to the stability of the world’s top oil exporter, a major power in the Muslim world and key U.S. ally in the tumultuous Middle East.\n\nUpon taking the throne in 2015, the octogenarian King Salman placed a powerful nephew in the line of succession but soon replaced him with one of his sons, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nPrince Mohammed has sought to consolidate power by appointing members of his inner circle to key positions in the government. He appointed his brother, Khalid, as ambassador to Washington—the kingdom’s most important overseas post—and then deputy defense minister.\n\nHe also has sidelined rival princes who have tried to resist the dominance of the Salman branch of the family. In March 2020, authorities detained possibly the most formidable challengers to the throne—Prince Ahmed, a brother of King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the king’s nephew and former crown price.\n\nThe moves have increased expectations that Prince Mohammed might soon try to accede to the throne, cementing a transition to the next generation of the royal family and potentially setting off a perilous succession quarrel, the likes of which helped bring down a previous Saudi kingdom in the mid-19th century."
