        "text": "London Stock Exchange is working to process all submitted LEI requests as soon as possible.\n\nAll submissions are validated as per the GLEIF/ROC validation standards. If there is any missing information on your LEI request, your record will be placed on hold to seek the required details which will inevitably delay the issuance of the LEI.\n\nIn order to ensure your LEI is processed as quickly as possible, please check your request is complete and accurate and that you have provided us with the necessary supporting documents as required.\n\nIf you are applying for a Trust, please provide us with a HMRC tax return form or trust deed that confirms the name and address of the trust\n\nIf your entity is registered on a business registry that is not publicly available, please provide us with certificate of incorporation or registry documents that confirm the entity name and address\n\nOne of the key benefits of the Legal Entity Identifier is the annual renewal and verification of the data, ensuring trustworthy high quality data. The quality of this data means that firms can rely on it to reduce counterparty risk and improve their operational efficiencies.\n\nWith over 1m LEIs now in existence, the importance of timely renewal of your LEI(s) has increased. Firms are required to contact their Local Operating Unit with updated information, who then in turn manually re-verify the data. With this in mind firms are being encouraged by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) to take action early. Any LEI that is not actively re-verified within one year of its creation will become ‘lapsed’, potentially providing complications when it comes to certain regulatory reporting regimes and in some cases will affect organisation's ability to trade.\n\nGLEIF have written a blog to help firms understand the LEI renewal process and the potential consequences of lapsed data. For more information please see their blog here.\n\nAs your Local Operating Unit (LOU), we will send you an email renewal reminder 60 days, 30 days then 7 days before your renewal date. This email will contain a step by step guide on how to submit your renewal. You can submit your LEI for renewal up to 60 days before the renewal date."
