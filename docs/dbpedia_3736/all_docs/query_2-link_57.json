THE LINE and the connectivity of our regions will be a model for the future- setting new global standards for livability.\n\nWhat does\n\nNEOM mean?\n\nThe name NEOM is derived from two words. Envisioned by His Royal Highness Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince and Chairman of the NEOM Company Board of Directors, the first three letters come from the Ancient Greek prefix neo – meaning 'new'. The 'M' is the first from 'Mustaqbal', an Arabic word meaning 'future'. The M is also the first letter of the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nNEOM LEADERSHIP\n\nTo bring NEOM to life requires the world’s most forward-thinking innovators leading the way. Meet the ambitious professionals doing exactly that, and learn more about their distinguished experience.\n\nNEOM SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ANNUAL REPORT\n\nTo build the cities of the future, we need to build the communities of the future. At NEOM Social Impact, we are developing transformative educational and training programs that empower students, entrepreneurs and individuals to be part of NEOM’s sustainable society."
