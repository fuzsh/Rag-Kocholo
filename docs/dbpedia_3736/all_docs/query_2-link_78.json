        "text": "In this op-ed, Jasmine Bager explains why Saudi Arabia lifting the ban on women driving is so important.\n\nOn the morning of September 26, I was giddy to visit the DMV in New York City. To most people, this visit would be a dreaded and boring routine stop, but not for me. I was excited to be able to go at all. Unless you grew up as a woman in Saudi Arabia, as I did, I truly don’t think anyone could comprehend how emotional a visit to the DMV could be.\n\nJust hours after successfully renewing my driver’s license, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman declared by royal decree that Saudi women would officially be allowed to drive in the country for the first time in history. Dr. Awwad bin Saleh Al-Awwad, the Minister of Culture and Information, said, “the decision affirms the continuation of reform and development process in the kingdom in which women constitute a major part.”\n\nAs a Saudi woman, my relationship with driving is unique: When I was 16, my father taught me how to drive in an abandoned parking lot behind a remote park on the eastern coast of the country. I remember climbing into the driver's seat for the first time, feeling like it was a throne. My eyes fixed at the road with such intensity that my father cracked a joke, telling me not to grip the wheel too hard or I’d break it. This would be a normal activity to most young women, but we were in Saudi Arabia, where such an act was forbidden.\n\nBefore this new decree, women in Saudi Arabia would be jailed for driving. Hours after announcing the lift of the driving ban, the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., announced the appointment of their first woman spokesperson, Fatimah Baeshen. Women were afforded the right to sit in the national stadium for the first time last weekend, and earlier this summer, the country marked the first time it allowed women to officially participate in sports at public schools — before this, only boys had physical education classes.\n\nA year after my dad taught me to drive in Saudi Arabia, I moved to attend college in Miami, Florida, where I passed the permit exam on the first try. I was the first of my Saudi friends to learn how to drive and pass the test. When I was 18, I crashed my car on my first night trip alone, during a rainstorm. After collecting my scattered car parts and calling roadside assistance, I called my dad in tears, telling him that I didn’t want to drive again, ever. He told me that I needed to get back on the horse and that he couldn’t fly from Saudi to Florida to drive me each time I needed a ride.\n\nMy American friends didn’t understand how I felt, and neither did my Saudi ones, but I took his advice and kept trying. I found myself slowly exploring new streets and learning about new places that I could visit on my lunch break while in Miami. I didn’t need to ask or wait for anyone, which seemed like such an American concept.\n\nBut that is about to change. Saudi women will soon be able to get behind the wheel: no more waiting for a ride from a father, brother, or hired driver. We will now be able to take ourselves to our appointments or to get groceries, with no need to spend so much of our paychecks to hire a foreign driver. The logistics of the lift are still unclear, however, and there are rumors swirling around social media saying that women would likely need to abide by a curfew, would likely need to be over the age of 30, and only be able to drive to specific areas.\n\nIn a tweet, the newspaper Okaz quoted the king’s son as saying that women would not require permission from their guardians to apply for a license. It was an unprecedented alert, as women are required to have permission from male guardians for every major decision. Government ministries are required to prepare reports within 30 days and women will start being allowed to drive starting in June 2018, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nWaad Janbi, a self-proclaimed feminist from Makkah who lives in Brooklyn, was the first person I called when I found out about the news. “Really, I am so happy I could die now,” she said. “But I need to live long enough to drive at home. I have always told myself that I don’t mind living in Saudi as long as I’m driving my own car…This is about independence.”\n\nAlaa Balkhy, a Brooklyn-based designer from Jeddah, actually asked me to pick up a paper application while I was at the DMV so she could apply for a permit, which has been on her bucket list since she was a child. “It changes how I feel about Saudi,” she said of the news. “It eases my heart. I think about all the times my mother needed to beg the driver not to quit. She taught my younger brothers how to drive but not me. This should be our moment...This is our time as women.”\n\nAl Arabiya notes that between 800,000 and one million men work solely as drivers to Saudi women in the country. Reham Sinan, whose aunt was one of the women who protested the driving ban in the 1990s, wondered what would happen to them. “My initial reaction is that it is great, but I was a bit apprehensive. Saudi has one of the highest fatality rates in terms of traffic accidents and a greater percentage of people driving on the streets could be a problem. This also means that a portion of the billions of Saudi riyals pouring out of the country via the expat drivers to their home countries will be reinvested in the local economy.”\n\nCareem, a car service, confirmed to the Saudi Gazette that the company was ready to immediately register women to work as drivers, noting that “women joining our team will enhance customer experience in the safest and safest service ever.”\n\nFor me, it was never about driving a car. It was about freedom of movement. It is time that Saudi women move beyond what history thinks we are and show ourselves who we are. We don’t have it all figured out, but we at least can take the first step.\n\nRelated: Girls in Saudi Arabia Will Can Soon Take Gym Class\n\n[#cneembed: e mbedjs/557f398061646d4fc4260000/playlist/5862dee3fd2e61173f000009.js?autoplay=1&muted=1]||||||"
