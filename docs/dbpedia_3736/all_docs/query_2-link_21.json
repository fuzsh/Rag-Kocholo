        "text": "Fadhili\n\nThe cutting edge Fadhili Gas Plant (FGP) is emblematic of Saudi Aramco’s broad impact on not only boosting gas supply to displace crude burning, but also driving economic growth, developing the Saudi workforce, spearheading technology deployment, and reducing CO2 emissions. FGP construction started in 2016 and was completed and put fully onstream in 2020.\n\nWith a total processing capacity of 2.5 BSCFD, FGP is the first plant in the region to have the capability of sweetening low BTU gas, then directly powering an independent power plant, yet able to switch to regular sales gas as needed. In addition, Fadhili is the first plant to treat nonassociated gas from both onshore and offshore fields.\n\nFGP is also the first SA Gas plant to deploy the Sulfur Recovery Unit Tail Gas Treatment process to attain a sulfur recovery rate of 99.9%, helping to protect air quality, and reducing SO2 emissions by more than 18,000 Metric Tons per year as compared to the conventional Claus process.\n\nThe development of Fadhili added billions of dollars to the local economy through IKTVA. 46% of the project’s materials and services were sourced and manufactured in Saudi Arabia.\n\nA unique feature of Fadhili is that its multiple downstream treated gas pipelines enhanced the connectivity, reliability, and responsiveness of Saudi Aramco’s Master Gas System (MGS), as those pipelines are connected to the northern and central sections of the MGS.\n\nHawiyah\n\nWe are expanding the gas processing capacity of our Hawiyah gas plant by more than 1 BSCFD. The new gas processing facilities, expected to be on stream in 2022, are anticipated to raise total production capacity of the plant to approximately 3.6 BSCFD, making it one of the largest gas processing facilities in the world.\n\nWe are making improvements to sustain gas production from both the Haradh and Hawiyah fields for the next 20 years and boost production by an average of 1.2 BSCFD. The program includes installing gas compression facilities, liquid separation stations, and transmission lines to our Haradh and Hawiyah gas plants, along with expanding the existing gas gathering pipeline network.\n\nWasit\n\nWasit, one of the largest gas plants we have ever built, was brought onstream in October 2015 and reached full operating capacity in mid-2016. Unlike our other gas plants, Wasit is designed to process solely nonassociated gas.\n\nTo feed Wasit, we brought gas production onstream from the big bore nonassociated gas wells in our offshore Arabiyah and Hasbah fields, situated approximately 150 km northeast of Jubail Industrial City in the Arabian Gulf. With the startup of production from these two fields, more than 40% of our nonassociated gas now comes from offshore fields.\n\nOur continued success in increasing supplies of cleaner burning natural gas makes it possible for us to reduce emissions, enable new industries and release more crude oil for value-added refining or export.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nAbqaiq\n\nAs the company's largest oil processing facility and the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world, Abqaiq plays a pivotal role in our day-to-day operations.\n\nAbqaiq oil facilities receive sour crude oil from gas-oil separation plants (GOSPs), process it into sweet crude oil, and then transport it to Ras Tanura and Jubail on the east coast, Yanbu' on the west coast and to Bapco Refinery in Bahrain. The off gases from the spheroids and stabilizer columns that are part of the conversion process are then sent to Abqaiq natural gas liquids (NGL) facilities for further processing.\n\nAbqaiq is the main oil processing center for Arabian Extra Light and Arabian Light crude oils.\n\nGhawar\n\nThe northern-most portion of the Ghawar field lies approximately 100 kilometers west of Dhahran. The field comprises six main areas (Fazran, Ain Dar, Shedgum, Uthaminyah, Hawiyah and Haradh) and extends southward over more than 200 kilometers as one long continuous anticline. It is approximately 36 kilometers across at its widest point.\n\nWe believe that the Ghawar field is the largest oil field in the world in terms of conventional proved reserves, totaling 58.32 billion barrels of oil equivalent as at 31 December 2018. It has accounted for more than half of the total cumulative crude oil production in the Kingdom.\n\nThe Ghawar field facilities and infrastructure remain a central component in our long-term strategic framework for optimizing both technical recovery of resources and the economic of resource management.\n\nShaybah\n\nThe Shaybah field, located in the Rub’ al-Khali or Empty Quarter, was discovered in 1968. Its remote location, local summer temperatures in excess of 50 degrees Celsius and sand dunes higher than 300 meters presented serious challenges. So for technical and economic reasons, development was held off until 20 years later. However, by the 1990s, advances in 3D seismic imaging technology, horizontal drilling and other technologies gave us the tools we needed to begin production.\n\nThe field is approximately 13 kilometers wide and 64 kilometers long. Due to the field's remoteness, its facilities include a dedicated NGL recovery unit, an airfield and accommodation for staff.\n\nOur second 250,000 bpd expansion project at Shaybah came on-stream in 2016, raising its overall production capacity to 1 million bpd of Arabian Extra Light crude oil — double the facility’s original capacity.\n\nJazan Refinery\n\nAramco operates one of the world’s largest refining businesses, and its integrated petrochemical refinery complex at Jazan City for Primary and Downstream Industries is part of the Company’s vibrant downstream growth strategy.\n\nIn 2020, Aramco confirmed that it would proceed with the divestment of the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Combined Cycle Plant into a Joint Venture (JV) between Aramco, Air Products, ACWA Power, and Air Products Qudra, integrating the Air Separation Unit into the JV.\n\nWith the addition of our Jazan Refinery Complex, Aramco has five wholly owned refineries within the Kingdom, three of which were built specifically to supply transportation and utility fuels for the domestic marketplace. Aramco’s four domestic affiliated refineries within the Kingdom are highly competitive with other world-class facilities based on scale, configurations and product yields.\n\nYanbu Aramco Sinopec Refining Company\n\nThe Yanbu Aramco Sinopec Refining Company (YASREF) Ltd., a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is a world-class, full-conversion refinery that covers about 5.2 million square meters in the Yanbu Industrial City, and is the key anchor project in Yanbu. YASREF uses 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Arabian heavy crude oil to produce premium transportation fuels, as well as high-value refined products for both international and domestic markets.\n\nYASREF is a significant addition to the impressive downstream portfolio of Saudi Aramco, while building on and cementing the strategic partnership with Sinopec, Saudi Aramco’s largest crude oil partner and buyer. Both companies bring commercial and technical expertise to the joint venture to enhance trade of transportation fuels between a significant energy producer and its consumer.\n\nIn addition, YASREF represents a continuing step forward in the strategies of Saudi Aramco and Sinopec to drive growth further downstream to capture additional value along the hydrocarbon chain.\n\nWEBSITE"
