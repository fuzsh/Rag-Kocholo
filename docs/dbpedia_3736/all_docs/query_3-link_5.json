        "text": "The Council of Ministers, also called the Cabinet, advises the King and facilitates the countryâ€™s development. It represents 22 different government ministries and is presided over each week by the King or his deputy.\n\nThe Cabinet is responsible for drafting and overseeing implementation of the internal, external, financial, economic, education and defense policies as well as the general affairs of the State.\n\nThe Cabinet consists of the Prime Minister (the King), the Deputy Prime Minister (the Crown Prince, who currently is also a Minister with portfolio), 21 other ministers with portfolio and seven ministers of state.\n\nIt is the final authority for financial, executive and administrative matters. Its resolutions are non-binding unless agreed upon by a majority vote. In case of a tie, the prime minister casts the tie-breaking vote. It functions in accordance with the Basic System of Governance and is advised by the Majlis Al-Shura (Consultative Council).\n\nEstablished in 1953 by King Saud, the Cabinet was restructured by King Fahd in 1993 and King Salman in 2015."
