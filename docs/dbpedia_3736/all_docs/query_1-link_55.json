Saudi Arabia mangroves is also an important carbon sink and carbon rich, play its role in climate change mitigation and vital for biodiversity and marine life. The mangroves serve as a sanctuary for a myriad of waterfowl, fish, including commercially valuable shrimps, and serve as the breeding and spawning grounds for many fish population.Threats to mangroves and coastal habitats in the regionPlaying a pivotal role in the food chain, food security, and the livelihoods of many fishermen and nomads, major part of mangroves in the region are facing multiple threats such as grazing by camels, timber cutting, pollution from solid wastes and sewage, as well as physical alterations to the coastal habitat. These threats, as highlighted in a 2004 report by PERSGA/GEF, span from local activities to global issues including uncontrolled coastal development, various forms of coastal and marine pollution, unsustainable utilization practices, shipping impacts, and disturbances linked to projected climate change.The report unveiled that the degradation of wetlands, mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass beds has been linked to various factors, including excessive filling and dredging of coastal waters for industrial, residential, and road construction, accounting for 70 percent of the degradation. Additionally, uncontrolled browsing and grazing by camels contribute to 20 percent, while sand encroachment accounts for 5 percent. The remaining 5 percent is attributed to oil spills, pollution, and toxic sewage discharge. Awareness campaign on Mangrove Conservation Day\"The imminent degradation and deforestation of our wetlands, mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass beds demand immediate attention and action from the National Center for Vegetation Cover Development and Combating Desertification (NCVC) to combat threats posed by human activities,\" stated Ahmed AlMansi at the special pavilion located at the headquarters of the National Center for Vegetation Cover Development and Combating Desertification in Riyadh. The pavilion, dedicated to raising awareness about the significance of mangrove trees and their crucial role, in conjunction with the celebration of the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem and it was also featured in other locations such as Dammam (Eastern Province), Jazan, Aseer and Jeddah.\"NCVC has been actively planting mangroves since 2020, and it has been a significant success. To date, NCVC has planted more than 37 million saplings along the coasts of the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf in collaboration with local stakeholder and partners such as Aramco, Ma’aden, Red Sea Global and the local community,\" said Ahmed proudly and added, “Our vision for 2030 is to plant 100 million mangrove trees, contributing to marine ecosystem health and blue carbon preservation.”Mangrove honey production and community benefits\"Six tonnes of mangrove honey were produced in 2023. These mangrove tree plantings enable another income generation for communities along the coasts and improve the marine ecosystem accordingly,\" explained Abdullah. H. Alwabaid at awareness campaign to spread the significance of mangrove trees and their crucial role in sustaining ecological balance and biodiversity.FAO and NCVC collaboration for sustainable mangrove management\"Through the integration of innovative technologies and capacity building initiatives for local communities and institutions, FAO aims to establish a comprehensive and sustainable management system in collaboration with NCVC,\" stated Raees Khan, Technical Adviser at the FAO Forestry unit for Natural Resource Management (NRM) in Saudi Arabia. \"Our team will and jointly work with NCVC to develop context specific management plans, assessing the current state of forests, identifying causes of degradation, and proposing appropriate interventions and technologies of restoration, climate change mitigation, and promoting livelihoods, coastal resilience and biodiversity conservation.\" Raees emphasized that joint working will be based and capitalized on FAO's vast global experience and expertise in mangrove management and plantation establishment to further promote the conservation, development and protection of mangrove ecosystems for a greener future of Saudi Arabia.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n12 August 2024\n\nStrengthening Capacities for Developing the Sustainable Land Management Framework in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\nThe National Center for Vegetation Cover Development and Combating Desertification (NCVC) in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT), jointly organized a training workshop on 14 to 18 July 2024, for about 46 participants from 14 national stakeholders. These stakeholders include several departments of NCVC, Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture (MEWA) and relevant universities, focused on strengthening their capacity in developing a sustainable land management (SLM) framework in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Training workshop strengthens NCVC, MEWA and universities’ capacity for developing SLM framework in Saudi Arabia“The cooperation between NCVC and FAO has been instrumental in enhancing joint efforts for sustainable natural resources development in Saudi Arabia,” said Mohamed Al Saeed, Director of the Department of Mitigation of Drought, speaking on behalf of the NCVC at the opening ceremony of the training workshop held at Crowne Plaza Hotel in Riyadh. Al Saeed emphasized the importance of collaborating with an elite group of experts, specialists and stakeholders to strengthen partnership and unify efforts in protecting the environment, improving vegetation cover and combating desertification. He noted that the stakeholders’ engagement reflects the extent of their commitment to environmental and sustainability issues and underscores the importance of cooperation between different parties to achieve Saudi Arabia’s environmental goals.“Environmental challenges in Saudi Arabia necessitate strong cooperation, solidarity and the adoption of best global practices in natural resources management,” added Al Saeed as he spoke about the series of fruitful meetings held to discuss compatibility and ways to enhance the joint efforts. Through this workshop, NCVC aims to strengthen its technical and administrative capabilities, and to exchange ideas and experiences with our international partners.Al Saeed extended his deepest appreciation to FAO and WOCAT for their continued support and cooperation and thanked the participants for their active engagement and great keen interest in environmental and sustainability issues. He concluded by expressing NCVC’s aspirations and anticipation of achieving positive and tangible results through this constructive cooperation. Saudi Arabia's commitment to sustainable rural agriculture“Efforts to combat climate change and enhance sustainable agriculture are crucial for securing food security and improving livelihoods in hyper-arid regions,” Kakoli Ghosh, speaking on behalf of FAO Saudi Arabia, and welcoming the WOCAT team and participants from different sectors. Ghosh commended Saudi decision-makers for their strong support for the development of scientific and sustainable solutions in reducing land degradation and mitigating sand encroachment to improve the rural economy. She emphasized FAO’s commitment to providing best practices to achieve food security through piloting innovative and suitable solutions in the agriculture sector. She stressed that these efforts should continue, focusing on value addition, conserving natural resources and improving livelihood and income.Collaboration between FAO with WOCAT“Our collaboration with WOCAT is pivotal in developing SLM framework, which will play a key role in addressing land degradation and desertification in Saudi Arabia while engaging a wide range of stakeholders to promote environmental sustainability,” said Jeremiah Njeru, Chief Technical Adviser of Natural Resources Management at FAO Saudi Arabia. He highlighted the collaboration between FAO and WOCAT through a Letter of Agreement, aims on strengthening the SLM in Saudi Arabia by developing an SLM Framework in partnership with the NCVC and MEWA. Njeru emphasized that an SLM framework will enable Saudi Arabia to effectively tackle land degradation and desertification, promote SLM technologies and practices across the Kingdom, and develop a platform for engaging all land sector stakeholders including government institutions, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and local communities.Njeru also emphasized the overarching goal of promoting innovative SLM technologies and practices to prevent degradation, enhance ecosystem resilience, and contribute to the long-term environmental sustainability goals of Saudi Arabia, including the Saudi Vision 2030 and other climate, biodiversity, and environmental initiatives such as Saudi Green Initiative. He welcomed the WOCAT team and highlighted the workshop as the initial step in documenting and implementing sustainable land management in Saudi Arabia.Saudi gains essential knowledge in SLM and readinessThree experts from WOCAT, namely Rima Mekdaschi, Jonas Chastonay and Joren Verbist, actively participated in the 5-day training workshop. They presented a common understanding of SLM, a brief introduction to WOCAT focusing on database and its use, SLM and the landscape approach, WOCAT documentation, criteria for assessing the sustainability and suitability of good land management practices, using WOCAT data within the context of the SLM framework for Saudi Arabia and initial ideas for a platform specific to Saudi Arabia. Additionally, four experts from FAO Saudi Arabia, namely Sami Albarih, Mona Dawelbait, Mosaed Majrashi and Yahya Alotaibi, contributed by presenting the status of land degradation in Saudi Arabia, identifying hotspots and focus areas as well as organizing a field day in Thadiq governorate to document three technologies and one approach.Extensive discussions were held with 46 participants, with strong participation of Saudi females throughout the workshop. The training workshop concluded successfully, featuring a range of topics, including individual tutorials and practical sessions for participants to reflect on and apply their newly acquired knowledge in suitability, sustainability and documentation of technologies and approaches in the WOCAT platform.On the final day, a planning presentation highlighting the next steps was delivered, with ongoing efforts planned to document SLM practices in Saudi Arabia and establish a framework for integration into the proposed Arabic platform of SLM for Saudi Arabia. The skills and knowledge gained will be instrumental and play a crucial role in combating desertification in Saudi Arabia through the implementation of SLM practices.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n27 June 2024\n\n“Our strong bond with the land weaves us together, creating timeless connections that breathes life into our past, present and future,” - Sidr Al-Jawf Community\n\nToday, Al-Adhraa National Park stands as a symbol of resilience and community spirit, where individuals are united by their love for the land and engaged in a remarkable journey of restoration and growth. Situated near desert terrain, this agricultural centre has a deep connection with the arid landscape, influencing both recreational activities and a sense of identity among villagers. Observing the gradual decline of vegetation due to desertification, in 2017, Al-Adhraa’s young, dedicated group had successfully rehabilitated and replanted the area with its original natural and indigenous plant life through joint efforts with volunteers and the local municipality in Al-Adhraa. Unfortunately, the project was unsustainable due to insufficient support, expertise, and a lack of technical knowledge in managing such endeavors.“We never gave up! Drawing lessons from past setbacks, we formed a volunteer environmental team and set up the \"Al-Adhraa National Park\" in a new location closer to the village” said one of the communities in Al-Adhraa known as \"Sidr Al-Jawf.\" Inspired by the dedication of the Al-Adhraa community in combatting desertification and revitalizing the vegetation in their region, their commitment and hard work did not go unnoticed. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in partnership with the National Center for Vegetation Development and Combating Desertification (NCVC) collaborated on the project “Strengthening Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture’s capacity to implement its Sustainable Rural Agricultural Development Programme, (UTF/SAU/051/SAU)” to support the Al-Adhraa community in their transformative journey. By offering expertise, technical guidance and a distance training course, FAO and NCVC strong collaboration significantly improved the efficiency of work in the Al-Adhraa National Park. “The good practices shared by FAO and NCVC experts provided me and my friends with opportunities to strengthen our skills, knowledge and awareness in combatting desertification, sand encroachment, and promoting sustainable vegetation development in Al-Adhraa,” expressed a leader of the Al-Adhraa community. “I am proud to be part of the team as I gained valuable insights and experiences from diverse international and local experts.” The community shared that the significant increase in awareness within the \"Sidr Al-Jawf\" association led them to officially register the “Sidr Al-Jawf Association” to the “Sidr Wild Trees Association” with the status of a National Center for the Non-Profit Sector.“I was amazed by the experiences shared by the Chinese” said one of the community members during their study trip to China, where they were selected to be part of a delegation exploring Chinese expertise in combating desertification and reducing sand encroachment jointly organized by FAO and NCVC. Reflecting on the trip, a community member shared, “The visit to China provided me and my friends with a wealth of knowledge and inspiration.” The participants were inspired and exposed to a variety of practices rooted in scientific research and successful on-the-ground experiments. With the support of FAO, the visit to China instilled great hope and motivation in the community to continue in their efforts in combatting desertification in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n01 July 2024\n\nSaudi Arabia's Continued Commitment to Combating Corruption\n\nMajor Funding and SupportThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through its Oversight and Anti-Corruption Authority (Nazaha), has reaffirmed its commitment to global anti-corruption efforts. Following an initial $10 million contribution in 2020, Saudi Arabia has now provided an additional $20 million for developing and maintaining a secure communication platform for the UNODC’s GlobE Network.Recent DevelopmentsOn June 10, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly and Nazaha President Mazin Ibrahim Al Kahmous signed a new agreement in Vienna for the platform’s development. This initiative will enhance the Network’s ability to provide a secure environment for anti-corruption practitioners to share information and collaborate on cross-border cases. “The GlobE Network is one of our most powerful tools for international cooperation against corruption,” said Ms. Waly.Background: The Initial FundingIn 2020, under Saudi Arabia's G20 presidency, Nazaha and UNODC signed a $10 million funding agreement to establish the GlobE Network. This initiative, known as the Riyadh Initiative, supports anti-corruption authorities with regular meetings, an online hub, a secure communication platform, and capacity-building programs.The Need for Secure CommunicationCorruption cases often span multiple countries, requiring swift and secure communication.

To promote a socially responsible and environmentally sound mining sector, UNIDO’s Director General, Gerd Müller, announced the establishment of a “Global Alliance and Partnership for Responsible and Green Minerals”, in cooperation with international partners and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, at the Ministerial Roundtable of the Future Minerals Forum in Riyadh. All countries are invited to participate, although initially countries at the forefront of critical minerals mining in Africa, Asia and Latin America will be targeted to join, many of them developing and least developed countries. In his opening remarks of the Ministerial Roundtable, Müller emphasized that “without critical minerals, there is no green energy transition, no green industrialization\". He highlighted that “a Global Alliance for Responsible and Green Minerals, with binding environmental and social standards for the mining industry and an independent certification system, has advantages for all market participants. It creates a real win-win situation for the countries with the raw materials. It will increase local value addition and production alongside jobs in the mining regions, and hundreds of millions of people, primarily in artisanal and small-scale mining, will benefit from living wages, adherence to fundamental human rights, as well as standards in the sector. Finally, it will help reduce and minimize damage to the environment.” The Alliance will work to set up international guidelines and benchmarks for sustainable critical minerals supply chains, help countries with the implementation of standards and policies, supported by a sound certification system. Participating countries and industry stakeholders will benefit from knowledge transfer and capacity building. Alignment of policy, technology and financing approaches will be at the core of the new Alliance, promoting a fair and green sector that supports inclusive and sustainable economic development. UNIDO will support with policy advice, capacity building, and implementation of standards and certification, and will act as the convener of this Alliance, bringing together governments, the mining industry, industry associations, relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, international financial institutions, technology providers and academia to advance the capacities of partner countries for sustainable critical minerals supply chains. The launch of the new Alliance and accelerating progress in promoting a sustainable mining sector globally took centre stage during Müller’s meeting with Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources, Bandar Alkhorayef. They also reviewed recent progress on the further strengthening of cooperation between UNIDO and Saudi Arabia. Several new flagship initiatives and concrete programmes are in the pipeline and will be launched soon. Sound industrial policy is crucial for the diversification of the Kingdom’s economy, in line with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 and its National Industrial Strategy. UNIDO will support in areas such as industrial development advice, statistical data availability, and capacity building for industrial policymakers. Supporting the diversification of Saudi Arabia’s economy was also the topic of Director General Müller’s meeting with Minister of Economy and Planning Faisal F. Al Ibrahim. They discussed avenues of cooperation to support developing countries in achieving their industrial development goals, with a particular focus on least developed countries (LDCs) and landlocked developing countries. Joint initiatives to increase local value addition and industrialization in areas like access to energy, food security through water management, agritech and agribusiness were explored. One particular issue discussed was UNIDO’s support for the development of industrial policies, statistics observatories and economic diversification strategies in the Kingdom and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, both in terms of what UNIDO can offer for the development of methodologies and the provision of expertise as well as for implementation. The visit of the Director General to the Kingdom further intensified the new quality of cooperation between UNIDO and Saudi Arabia. At the 20th UNIDO General Conference, UNIDO’s Member States decided that Saudi Arabia will host the next UNIDO General Conference in Riyadh from 23 to 27 November 2025.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPress Release\n\n21 February 2024\n\nStatement by the Director, Mr. Salah Khaled, UNESCO Regional Office for the Gulf States and Yemen to mark the International Mother Language Day 2024\n\nSince then, this day has been observed globally, uniting people in their shared commitment to preserving linguistic diversity and cultural heritage. It is a day to celebrate linguistic diversity across the globe, to recognize that every language is a treasure of knowledge, history, and tradition. It is a reminder that linguistic rights are human rights, and that we must strive to protect and promote the languages of all peoples, especially those endangered or marginalized.Today, 40% of the world’s population does not have access to education in a language they speak or understand. In some countries this figure rises to over 90%. However, strides are being made in multilingual education, especially in early schooling. Research shows that the use of learners’ own language in schools provides a solid foundation for learning, boosts self-esteem and critical thinking skills, and opens the door for inter-generational learning, language revitalization, and the preservation of culture and intangible heritage. The theme for this year’s celebration is ‘Multilingual education is a pillar of intergenerational learning’. UNESCO believes that literacy programmes and methodologies respond to the needs of learners when they are context-relevant, possibly multilingual and support intercultural understanding within the framework of lifelong learning. UNESCO promotes multilingualism, that is the use of more than one language in daily life, especially in contexts where different linguistic groups exist in the same country. Multilingual education based on the mother tongue(s) in the early years of schooling plays a key role in the transition from home to school and fosters respect for diversity. Multilingual education also extends to families and communities. By preserving and revitalizing languages, we bridge generational gaps and ensure that cultural heritage is passed down and cultural identity is protected. With students learning in their mother tongue language, parents and families are more likely to be involved in the learning of their children. UNESCO recognizes the importance of cultural and linguistic diversity for building sustainable societies. Our languages serve as conduits for transmitting and preserving traditional knowledge and cultures. They foster tolerance, respect, and understanding among diverse communities. Let us celebrate our linguistic diversity and heritage. Each language contributes to the rich tapestry of humanity. By preserving languages, promoting multilingual education, we build bridges across generations, and people, ensuring our cultural legacies, and realizing one of the key objectives of education, which is to learn how to live together.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPress Release\n\n23 January 2024\n\nUNESCO Regional Office for the Gulf States and Yemen's Statement on the International Day of Education\n\nThe world is at a unique historical juncture, grappling with increased uncertainty and complex issues that shift at an unprecedented speed. Our education systems are confronted with multiple challenges and are highly impacted by technology – related developments, ecological and sociological trends that require them to adapt and transform. The world is seeing a surge in conflicts paralleled by a concerning rise of intolerance and discrimination. In particular, disinformation, misinformation, hate speech can take dangerous forms that not only cause harm at the personal level and incite group-targeted violence but are also an attack on inclusion, diversity and human rights. Quality, equitable and lifelong education remains the most transformational power to redress injustice and entrenched inequalities, shape just, sustainable and peaceful societies and futures. Education, in its various forms, has the power to transcend boundaries, challenge prejudices, bridge gaps between people and cultures, and ultimately, foster a sense of global citizenship, a sense of belonging to a common and diverse humanity, respecting the needs and the rights of each others, and our shared planet Earth, which we all bear responsibility for. All of this is eloquently articulated in the UNESCO Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights and Sustainable Development unanimously adopted by 194 Member States in November 2023, which underlines the importance of education being positioned at the center of our commitment to peace. The Recommendation focuses on how teaching and learning should transform to bring about lasting peace, a concept deeper than the absence of violence and conflict that includes dynamic, and long-term efforts to build the ability to value human dignity, our well-being and the good state of our shared planet. The Recommendation reaffirms human rights, gender inclusion in and through education, and sustainable development, despite threats and challenges. In doing so, it promotes 14 guiding principles and priority action areas that can help empower learners with the necessary knowledge, competencies, and attitudes to become agents of peace in their immediate communities.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPress Release\n\n11 October 2023\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UN-Habitat Sign An Agreement to Advance Sustainable Urban Development in the Kingdom\n\nThe Host Country Agreement will fortify the ongoing collaboration between UN-Habitat and Saudi Arabia in urban transformation, while expanding partnerships with stakeholders from government, academia, civil society and the private sector.
