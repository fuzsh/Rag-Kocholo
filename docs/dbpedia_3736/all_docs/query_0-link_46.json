This year's theme is \"21st Century Culture: Sovereignty or Globalism?\"\n\n”Culture is a common language that brings people together. In the framework of the Forum, we shall raise current trends and relevant vectors of expanding the contemporary cultural environment, including the topics of cultural sovereignty and globalism. The business program will embrace debates within 10 thematic sections, each led by an individually chosen curator,“ remarked Head of the Organising Committee, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova.\n\nEach of the 10 sections is dedicated to diverse cultural perspectives.

Among the issues discussed are new vistas for dialogue between Russian and Chinese theatres, the potential and formats of theatrical interaction between the BRICS countries, the cultural sovereignty of Russia, the want of professional human resources and the quality of domestic education in the area of culture.\n\nLed by the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Lenfilm Studio Fyodor Bondarchuk and the CEO of the Federal Fund for Social and Economic Support of Domestic Cinematography (Cinema Fund) Fyodor Sosnov, the ”Cinema“ section explores contemporary cinematic art both as a reflection of today's reality and as a tool for shaping it up.\n\nThe ”Museums“ and ”Circus“ thematic sections will be run by the Director General of the State Hermitage, President of the Union of Museums Mikhail Piotrovsky and the Director General of the Grand Moscow State Circus on Vernadsky Avenue Edgard Zapashny, respectively. The former section is focused on museum as a social laboratory and the search for national identity, paradigms of collaboration that meet the challenges of modern times. The leading theme of the latter is international cooperation and the preservation of national circus traditions in the context of globalization, inclusiveness and the expansion of circus art.\n\nFirst Deputy Director General of ITAR-TASS Mikhail Gusman will take up the issues of ”Media Culture“. The section participants are going to discuss journalistic ethics when covering cultural events and the development of ethical standards for artificial intelligence in the media.\n\nDirector General of the State Academic Capella of Saint Petersburg Olga Khomova and Russian virtuoso pianist, People's Artist of Russia Denis Matsuev, along with other experts, are to share the experience of Russian and global concert management at the ”Musical Culture“ debates.\n\nThe central venues for the Forum’s business program will customarily be the General Staff of the Hermitage and the State Academic Capella of Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe organizers of the X St. Petersburg International Cultural Forum are the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, and the Government of Saint Petersburg.
