It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity. It's also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza,\" Blinken told reporters.\n\nBlinken's comments came as fears grow of an attack by Iran and its allies on Israel in retaliation for its killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah figures in strikes last weeks.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden, whose country has sent extra warships and fighter jets to the region in support of Israel, was to hold crisis talks with his national security team.\n\nThe head of the US military command covering the Middle East, General Michael Kurilla, arrived in Israel and met Israel's military chief Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi for an assessment, an Israeli military statement said.\n\n2123 GMT â€” American personnel wounded in Iraq attack\n\nSeveral American personnel have been injured in a suspected rocket attack on a base in Iraq, a US defence spokesperson said.\n\n\"There was a suspected rocket attack today against US and coalition forces at al-Asad Airbase, Iraq. Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on Ain al-Assad air base.\n\n2019 GMT â€” Israel kills 3 in Lebanon, including two Hezbollah fighters\n\nLebanon's Health Ministry said Israeli strikes killed three people in the country's south, with Hezbollah announcing the death of two of its fighters and a rescue group mourning a paramedic.\n\nThe ministry said an \"Israeli enemy strike that targeted a motorbike\" in the southern village of Ebba killed one person, wounded another and caused a pregnant woman who was near the site to miscarry due to \"shock\".\n\nEarlier, the ministry said an \"enemy raid\" near the cemetery in the border village of Mais al-Jabal \"killed two people\".\n\nLebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said one of the dead in Mais al-Jabal was a paramedic with the Risala Scouts association, which is affiliated with the Hezbollah-allied Amal movement.\n\nHezbollah, in separate statements, announced the death of two fighters, one from Mais al-Jabal.\n\n1940 GMT â€” 'No change' in arms export licenses approach to Israel: UK\n\nRebuffing reports that the UK had imposed a \"secret arms embargo\" on Israel amid its ongoing carnage in besieged Gaza, the British government said there has been \"no change\" in its approach to arms export licenses to Israel.\n\n\"There has been no change to our approach to export licenses to Israel. We continue to review export license applications on a case-by-case basis against the Strategic Export Licensing Criteria,\" a government spokesperson told Anadolu Agency.\n\nThe official added: \"We are reviewing the advice regarding exports to Israel, and no decision has been made.\"\n\nLoading..."
