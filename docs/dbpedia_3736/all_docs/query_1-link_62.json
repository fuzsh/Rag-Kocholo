        "text": "KIA is an independent public authority established in Kuwait and managed by its Board of Directors. The Board has complete independence in its decision making process and is responsible for long-term asset allocation and overall performance; while the executive management formulates and executes investment strategies.\n\nKIA’s assets and performance are presented to the Kuwait National Assembly in an annual special session on the State’s Financials.\n\nKIA’s accounts are reviewed, audited, and approved by an external audit firm. In addition, KIA is required by law to submit semi-annual statements of its assets under management to the independent State Audit Bureau. KIA presents an annual statement of its accounts to the Council of Ministers (Kuwait’s Cabinet) and it presents an annual statement of its accounts to the National Assembly (Kuwait’s Parliament). KIA appears before various committees at the parliament on a periodic basis to discuss KIA’s performance. KIA’s Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, with members from the private sector representative of the Board.\n\nKIA’s Board Audit Committee and Internal Audit Office assess the effectiveness of the internal control systems for safeguarding company assets and investment portfolios, and review the integrity of the financial reporting process.\n\nAs an independent public authority, the KIA complies with the rules and regulations of Kuwait’s Civil Services Commission and Ministry of Finance controllers.\n\nKuwait Investment Authority manages its funds on behalf of the people of Kuwait – current citizens and future generations. KIA’s investments are completely transparent to the State of Kuwait, as presented in a detailed annual report to the Council of Ministers on assets under management and performance as well as the National Assembly at least annually during a parliamentary session on the State’s Financial Situation.\n\nThough KIA reports its annual performance directly to Government and to the National Assembly, it is the responsibility of all to protect the integrity of the portfolio.\n\nLaw No. 47 of 1982 regarding the establishment of KIA has select clauses related to dissemination of information. Clause 8 prohibits the disclosure to the public of any information related to KIA’s work. Clause 9 states the penalties for unauthorized disclosure of information to the public.\n\nEstablished as the Kuwait Investment Board in February 1953 and later reorganized into the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in 1965. KIO’s foundation predates the independence of the modern State of Kuwait. HH Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem, the Amir of Kuwait, at the time had the vision to build a fund for the future of all Kuwaitis. At the time, KIO was the first and only sovereign wealth fund in the world.\n\nIn the years that followed a focus on asset allocation and diversification into new geographies, expanding beyond the United Kingdom to include the United States, Asia and select Emerging Markets. ​​​​\n\nIn 1976, the Future Generations Fund (FGF) Amiri decree was passed which is the most important event in the history of the KIO after its establishment. With that law, a minimum of 10% of the State of Kuwait’s revenues are transferred to the FGF. This created a constant flow of funds to the FGF which helped grow it over the years.\n\nThe KIO played a pivotal role during the first Gulf War in 1990 and the liberation and reconstruction efforts that followed; acting as the Ministry of Finance for the government in exile. As state assets were frozen, KIO organized the transfer of funds globally and to the Kuwaiti Government, in exile, in Saudi Arabia.\n\nKIO Today\n\nLocated in the City of London, KIO is a global investor in one of the world’s leading financial centers with access to markets, financial institutions, and industry leaders and experts.\n\nKIO’s mission statement is focused on 3 elements:\n\nManage that portion of the Future Generations Fund entrusted to it by the State of Kuwait\n\nPreserve the funds capital and achieve a fair return over the long term by exceeding and outperforming its benchmark\n\nContinuously evolve KIO’s reputation as an expert and progressive institution that invests in the international financial markets\n\nIn addition, KIO has a strong focus on not only investing the future generations fund of Kuwait but also developing the future generations of Kuwait. KIO’s team of professionals include highly skilled Kuwaitis who play an important role in managing the assets of the FGF.\n\nKIO’s team of investment professional all based in London are split into various asset classes and invests directly in: equities, fixed income and alternatives including infrastructure and real estate across the globe.\n\nKIA realized the importance of investing in China and the Far East. During a visit to China that was held in 2009 by His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Amir of Kuwait, the KIA signed agreements that laid the groundwork for such investments. One of which saw the establishment of Kuwait Investment Authority’s first ever representative office in Beijing. This office was a gateway to expanding KIA’s investment throughout China.\n\nFurther to KIA opening a representative office in Beijing in 2011, during the second visit of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Amir of Kuwait, the KIA has upgraded its structure with a Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (WOFE) license. Becoming the second overseas investment office after Kuwait Investment Office – London, dated back to 1953, the Kuwait Investment Office established an office in Shanghai in 2018.\n\nAs part of a joint effort to be actively involved in regional investment opportunities, KIA aims to further expand the depth and width of the investment horizon in China and Asia Pacific areas. Furthermore, the relocation of the office from Beijing to Shanghai reflects KIA’s belief to the increasingly importance of Shanghai as a global financial center."
