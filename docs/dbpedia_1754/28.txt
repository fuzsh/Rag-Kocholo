The principal function of the Court is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the parties to the Convention and its Protocols.

The Court is comprised of 46 judges, elected by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The judge elected in respect of Ireland, Dr Síofra O’Leary, has served as President of the Court since 1 November 2022, and is the first woman to do so.

The Court hears applications from individuals, non-governmental organisations, or groups of individuals who claim to be the victim of a violation of the Convention or its Protocols.

The contracting states undertake to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they are parties. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe supervises the execution of the Court’s judgments.
