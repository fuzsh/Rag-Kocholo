A donor is found two weeks later, but the ambulance transporting the organ is hijacked by a group of bank robbers (Mark Kiely, Heath Lourwood and Blake Adams) trying to pay off a ruthless loan shark (Lee Arenberg)-- whom Sydney busted three years before ascending to Rangerhood-- after their getaway results in one of the robbers being injured. In the process of hijacking the ambulance and stealing the liver (the latter of which they have no knowledge of or interest in), the robbers kill one paramedic while abducting the other, needing him to treat the injured robber. Even worse, Faith's current liver begins to fail rapidly than expected. As Dionne agonizes at the prospect of losing her granddaughter, having already lost her daughter (Faith's mother) to a drug overdose, the Rangers are left with very little time to track down the thieves, rescue the paramedic and recover the liver.\n\n19011\"Golden Boy\"Eric NorrisStory by : Chuck Norris\n\nTeleplay by : Raymond C.
