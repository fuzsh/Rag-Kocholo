Email me at beer.snob@yahoo.com.\n\nEp 52: The Continuing Saga of Hanging Hills\n\nHere’s an episode for anyone interested in the risky side of owning a brewery. In Ep 52, I sit down with Joe Ploof, owner of Hanging Hills Brewing, which nearly died a tragic death after closing its tasting room doors in Hartford, Conn. It’s now in a second life, contract brewing at East Rock Brewing in New Haven, Conn.\n\nIn this episode we talk about the problems that Hanging Hills faced, how COVID nearly struck a fatal blow to the company, and the resurrection of a brand.\n\nEp 51: Brewing local with author Stan Hieronymus\n\nIn ep 51, I had the privilege of talking to a giant in beer publishing. Stan Hieronymus has the rare ability to write for the casual and intensely informed reader. We focused primarily on the topic of using local ingredients in beer, as I recently read his 2016 book “Brewing Local: American-Grown Beer” (Brewers Publications). We veer off into how a recent love of the sweet in beer squares with tradition, and the commitment it takes to incorporate local ingredients like roots, mushrooms, honey, and spelt.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Back East Brewing in Bloomfield, Connecticut. Background music courtesy of Pixabay.\n\nEp 50: Instagram educators Em Sauter and Proper_Josh\n\nEp 50 (woo!) focuses on learning about beer from an unlikely place. As much as I enjoy scrolling through Instagram, it’s primarily a fun factory of nonsense. However, Em Sauter (@pintsandpanels) and Proper_Josh (@proper_josh) make it a bit more educational. Em creates cartoons and Josh makes tasting videos and they both delve into beer from angles that are both informed yet fun. (You can go to Em’s website, http://www.pintsandpanels.com for more of her work.\n\nJoin me for the Afterparty, where I discuss Brass Works Brewing‘s Mango Habanero Fowl’d Up IPA.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Back East Brewing.

Thanks!\n\nEp 49: Barb Baker, Siren of Stout\n\nIt was a delight speaking with Barb Baker for episode 49. Known as the Siren of Stout, this Michigan-based beer blogger works with Fermenta, an organization that raises money to help women achieve more in the fermented arts, including brewing. She’s partnered up with others to create her own pastry stout and honey wine, and she’s always promoting others and passing along information on her Instagram account (@sirenofstout).\n\nWe talk about the poise and confidence it takes to be an African-American woman in beer and her experience as a model, car show host, and actress. She’s insightful and inspiring.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by the good people at Back East Brewing in Bloomfield, Conn. The Afterparty beer is Abel Coconut Vanilla Porter from Brass Works Brewing in Waterbury, Conn. Background music is courtesy of Pixabay. Photo by Darrel Ellis for SeenTheMagazine.com.\n\nEp 48: Old Dad, New Baby, Low ABV Beer\n\nIn ep 48, I confront the complicated feelings that low and no alcohol beer bring out in my rapidly aging body. Like this episode, I am also 48, and I have a toddler. To make sense of my new love of low-ABV beer without giving up my tiny amount of cool cred, I turned to experts and trusted friends: Good Beer Hunting reporter Kate Bernot, Bottle Stop beer buyer Kevin Thomas, Athletic Brewing brewer John Walker, and all-around nice guy Art Hendrickson Jr.\n\nThis is my first “narrative” episode and was a labor of love. It’s not a straight interview, but a story told with many voices. I did the editing and even the music myself, with some help from Pixabay.\n\nSpeaking of music, during the Afterparty, I spin the single “Strangers” by Coleus, so stick around for that.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Brass Works Brewing in Waterbury, Connecticut. [Aired 2/5/2021]\n\nEp 47: Cooking and baking with The Beeroness, Jackie Dodd Mallory\n\nIn episode 47, I chat with author and recipe creator Jackie Dodd Mallory, known as The Beeroness. She makes baking and cooking with beer seem easy and fun and she teaches me some valuable basics on when and how to use beer as an ingredient, the importance of yeast, why brown ale is like a bass player, how to take better beer photographs, and more.\n\nStay for the Afterparty, when I talk about the past and future of this nearly 1-year-old podcast.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Back East Brewing of Bloomfield, Connecticut.\n\nYou can learn more about Jackie at her website: www.thebeeroness.com.\n\nMusic: “Dreamy Day” by Caffeine Creek Band and “Summertime” by JuliusH (royalty-free from Pixabay.com/music), and a snippet from “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” performed by Ella Fitzgerald\n\nPlease follow, rate, and recommend It Starts With Beer podcast. [Aired 12/27/2020]\n\nEp 46: Counter Weight Brewing’s Matt Westfall\n\nIn ep 46, we meet Matt Westfall, founder of the award-winning Counter Weight Brewing Company of Hamden, Connecticut. We discuss how he branched out on his own after 9 years with iconic New England Brewing Company, what it’s like to weather COVID-19 restrictions, and how he’s planning to build a new brewery.\n\nDuring the Afterparty, I discuss the recent draconian Connecticut Consumer Protection mandate that forces breweries to essentially become brewpubs or face hefty fines. And we listen to the Afterparty track: “Songbird” by Jason Ingriselli and The Miles North Band.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Brass Works Brewing of Waterbury, Connecticut.\n\nYou can find more episodes at beersnobwrites.com/podcast, and you can email me at beer.snob@yahoo.com.\n\nBackground music:\n\nIntro: “Dance of the Sugar-Plum Fairy” by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, performed by the Apollo Symphony Orchestra\n\nOutro: “Cali” Wataboi, from Pixabay.com/music.

Canvas Podcast delves into the artist’s role in creating a label’s look and impact. I take AJ into another virtual pub; this one is designed like a giant museum that features beer art only. We talk about the process of creating beauty that most likely will end up in a recycling heap and why that matters in the ecosystem that is craft beer.\n\nThis ep is sponsored by Back East Brewing of Bloomfield, Connecticut.\n\nStay for the Afterparty track after the interview, where I feature Shane Scarazzini and Eightfingers and their song, “West Virginia Girl.”\n\nRoyalty-free background music from Pixabay.com: “U said it” by Wataboi and “Midnight” by JuliusH.\n\nSpecial effects from Zapsplat.com.
