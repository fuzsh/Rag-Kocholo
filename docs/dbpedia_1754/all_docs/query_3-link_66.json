        "text": "The Moçambique rule provides that an English court may not adjudicate on title to foreign immovable property. This article considers the primary exception to that rule: where the court assumes jurisdiction in personam to enforce a contractual or equitable claim concerning foreign immovable property against a defendant subject to the court's personal jurisdiction. It addresses two questions: how should the English court decide whether to assume jurisdiction in relation to foreign land, and if the positions are reversed, should an English court recognize or enforce the order of a foreign court affecting English land? As to the first question, this article argues that the orthodox English approach is anachronistic. English law applies the lex fori exclusively to determine whether an obligation exists which the court has jurisdiction to enforce. Instead, modern conflict of laws principles demand that the court should apply the proper law of the substantive claim in determining whether a sufficient equitable or contractual obligation exists. As to the second question, this article argues that despite the prevailing view that foreign non-money judgments are not enforceable in England, foreign orders in relation to English land are in principle entitled to recognition in a subsequent action in England by the successful claimant.\n\n2 This article is not concerned with the position within Europe, as to which see Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters [2001] OJ L 12/1, to be replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) [2012] OJ L 351/1.\n\n23 See the cases cited in Dicey (n 5) at [34–084] and McLachlan, CA, ‘International Litigation and the Reworking of the Conflict of Laws’ (2004) 120 LQR 580 at 601–2Google Scholar, doubting the wisdom of an apparent ‘retreat from choice of law’ in relation to equitable obligations. In hindsight this may not have been so much a retreat as a continuation of the practice dating back to the days of a separate Court of Chancery: see White, RW, ‘Equitable Obligations in Private International Law: the Choice of Law’ (1986) 11 Syd LR 92Google Scholar cited by McLachlan at n 120.\n\n25 Garnett, R, Substance and Procedure in Private International Law (Oxford University Press 2012)Google Scholar at [3.26]. See eg Attorney General for England and Wales v R [2002] 2 NZLR 91 (NZCA) at [28]–[30] (but cf apparently Birch v Birch [2001] 3 NZLR 413 (HC) at [50] per Paterson J); Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von Uexhull [2006] SGCA 39, [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [75]–[76], followed in Murakami (SGCA) (n 24) at [28]; OJSC Oil Company Yugraneft v Abramovich [2008] EWHC 2613 (Comm) at [171]–[223]; Fiona Trust & Holding Corp v Privalov [2010] EWHC 3199 (Comm) at [155]–[159]; Murakami v Wiryadi [2010] NSWCA 7, (2010) 268 ALR 377.

For resulting trusts see Dicey (n 5) at [29–077]; Harris (2012) at 967; Whung v Whung [2011] FamCA 137, (2011) 258 FLR 452 at [198].\n\n44 See Rogerson, PJ, Collier's Conflict of Laws (4th edn, Cambridge University Press 2013) at 383–4Google Scholar; Dicey (n 5) at [23–047]. See also Cheshire (n 5) at 485, which attempts to explain the cases on the basis that in ‘exceptional circumstances’ the court might nevertheless enforce an equity against a third party, and that in the River Plate case it was justified because the third party's conduct was ‘clearly unconscionable’.\n\n66 This is proceeding CIV 1264 of 2006. The other two Australian proceedings involved an equivalent allegation in relation to an Australian property (CIV 1009 of 2005, judgment given in Singh v Kaur Bal [2011] WASC 303), and an allegation that another Malaysian property (apparently on the same street as the first Malaysian property) was held on express trust by the defendant (CIV 1677 of 2004, judgment given in Singh v Singh (No 3) [2010] WASC 64). The fourth proceeding is in Malaysia. For the avoidance of doubt cross-references are not used when referring to the cases in this dispute.\n\n85 Megarry J applied the rather impressionistic alternative of asking whether the courts of the situs would ‘stand aghast at the spectacle of a purchaser living within the English jurisdiction being ordered by an English court to carry out his agreement to purchase land’ abroad: Richard West & Partners (Inverness) Ltd v Dick [1969] 2 Ch 424 (Ch) at 430. Cf Duke v Andler (n 13) at 742, relying on Re Courtney (n 7) at 250, where the Supreme Court suggested that the distinction was whether it would be enforced by the courts of the situs.\n\n88 cf Dicey (n 5) at [23–046]. Note also that in Re Courtney no unsecured creditors who would be prejudiced by the order had been identified, whereas the position of such creditors was noted in Waterhouse (n 7) at 257. Yet several decisions have given priority for plaintiff security-holders in such circumstances: see eg Ex p Holthausen, In Re Scheibler (1874) 9 LR Ch App 722 (CA), Re Smith (n 8); In re Anchor Line (Henderson Brothers) Ltd [1937] 1 Ch 483 (Ch).\n\n90 Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations [2008] OJ L 177/6, art 4(1)(c) (but subject to art 3); alternatively a contract is likely to be ‘manifestly more closely connected’ with the situs than anywhere else: art 4(3).\n\n92 Again, this may be explained by the fact that the Court of Chancery required a connection between the subject matter of the dispute and England before taking jurisdiction, and the fact that the contract was made in the jurisdiction was a sufficient connection: see text to n 47 above. That requirement acted as a proxy for what would now be achieved by the choice of law process, but had the effect that when jurisdiction was assumed English law was usually applied.\n\n93 For example, the headnote of Paget v Ede (1872) LR 18 Eq 118 appears to confine the rule in that case to land in ‘the colonies’; see also Lord Cranstown v Johnston (n 20) at 182 and Dicey (n 5) at [23–051], but cf Ewing v Orr Ewing (1883) LR 9 App Cas 34 (HL) at 40. Dicey (n 5) at [33–038] cites a number of the cases discussed above as authorities where the contract was more closely connected to England rather than the situs, but they must be read with caution now.\n\n109 Whether as a matter of substance or procedure. At [37]–[38] Hasluck J appears to suggest that the imposition of a constructive trust should follow the finding of a breach of section 89(1) as ‘consequential relief’, relying on Muschinski v Dodds (1985) 160 CLR 583 at 613 for the bare proposition that a constructive trust can be imposed to preclude retention of beneficial ownership where that would be inequitable.\n\n111 Fentiman notes that oral examination of witnesses may sometimes be dispensed with in favour of affidavit evidence; in other words, an expert's evidence is not automatically inadequate simply because it was given by affidavit: Fentiman, R, Foreign Law in English Courts (Oxford University Press 1998) at 204Google Scholar. See generally on the adequacy of proof of foreign law Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd [2005] HCA 54, (2005) 223 CLR 331. Of course it is a matter of domestic civil procedure whether the court will take into account evidence already filed by a party in default of appearance, and it may not.\n\n112 [2009] WASCA 53, (2009) 253 ALR 575 at [43]. One could thus argue that the court should have applied the rule that, in the absence of proof of foreign law, the lex fori applies. This raises the difficult issue of whether that rule should have been excluded in circumstances where Western Australian law was statutory and inherently applicable only to Western Australian land, thus creating a ‘special institution’: see eg Shaker v Al-Bedrawi [2003] Ch 350 (CA) at [64] citing Österreichische Länderbank v S'Elite Ltd [1981] QB 565 (CA) at 569, but see the argument that the position may be different where the applicable foreign law may be expected to contain a provision equivalent to the lex fori: at [68]. See also Schnaider v Jaffe (1916) 7 CPD 696 (Cape of Good Hope Provincial Division) at 700–1, cited in Damberg v Damberg (2001) 52 NSWLR 492 (CA) at [140], and Dicey (n 5) at [9–025]–[9–029].\n\n127 For example, the court may give leave to serve a defendant outside the jurisdiction on the basis of a long-arm statute, which is sufficient for the purpose of Penn v Lord Baltimore jurisdiction (see Re Liddell's Settlement Trusts [1936] Ch 365 (CA) at 374) but under English rules does not suffice for the purpose of enforcement in the absence of submission.\n\n134 Although Smith J's assumption may be justified in the case of a default judgment (unless the plaintiff itself pleaded and proved the content of foreign law), it is still unclear why it provides a basis for refusing to enforce a judgment; the English court will not re-examine the merits of the foreign judgment: Dicey (n 5) Rule 48 at [14R–118], citing (inter alia) Godard v Grey (1870) LR 6 QB 139.\n\n137 Edinger, E, ‘Is Duke v Andler Still Good Law in Common Law Canada?’ (2011) 51 CanBusLJ 52 at 62Google Scholar. In Shami v Shami (n 3) at [37] Deputy Judge David Donaldson QC suggests that the Supreme Court misinterpreted the Californian judgment and thus proceeded on a premise of ‘dubious accuracy’. This confusion appears to have arisen because the Commissioner had effected a transfer of the land since the Californian judgment, and the plaintiffs asked the Canadian court (in the alternative) to effectively sanction that conveyance; the result was that the plaintiffs were in that sense seeking to enforce in the Canadian courts something other than the Californian court's order itself.\n\n145 Shami v Shami (n 3) at [29]. Cf eg the Convention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Canada providing for the Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (entered into force 1 January 1987) [1988] UKTS 74, art V(2), in which the equivalent exclusion in relation to immovable property only prevails over some of the heads of in personam jurisdiction, but does not prevail where the judgment debtor submitted by appearing or counterclaiming: see Patterson v Vacation Brokers Inc [1998] IL Pr 472 (Ont CA) at [7].\n\n159 Either where the plaintiff lost entirely in the foreign proceedings or where the plaintiff seeks to ‘top up’ their damages award in subsequent English proceedings: Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, section 34; see Republic of India v India Steamship Co Ltd [1993] AC 410 and (No 2) [1998] AC 878.\n\n168 [1999] 1 AC 119 (HL) at 140. See also Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc (trading as Caesars Palace) [2009] SGCA 60, [2010] 1 SLR 1129 at [27], where the Singapore Court of Appeal found that a Californian judgment (which set aside the fraudulent transfer of Californian land and declared the existence of a constructive trust) did not order the payment of a sum of money, and was thus not capable of enforcement. However the Court did not express a view on whether non-money judgments could ever be enforced, because the plaintiff's claim was premised on its argument that the Californian judgment created an obligation to pay a sum of money; indeed, the Court noted that the California judgment had been executed and so there was nothing left to enforce: at [33].\n\n172 Excluded by section 11(2). There is a little more to it than that. Section 11(2) excludes matrimonial causes from the definition of ‘action in personam’. That means for the purpose of determining whether the Israeli court had jurisdiction the catch-all provision in section 4(3)(c) applies, which provides that where an action is neither in rem nor in personam the question is whether the foreign court had jurisdiction ‘recognised by the law of the registering court’."
