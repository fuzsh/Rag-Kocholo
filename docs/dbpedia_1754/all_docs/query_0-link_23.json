        "text": "Megha Majumdar\n\n“Politics and Power”\n\nThursday, November 18, 2021 at | 7:30 p.m.\n\nMegha Majumdar and Klay will speak on the topic of “Politics and Power.” In her universally acclaimed book, A Burning, Majumdar tells the story of the aftermath of a terrorist attack in modern India through the lives of three characters caught up in the subsequent political hysteria. In what The New Yorker’s James Wood declared an “immersive” and “masterly” narrative, Majumdar richly inhabits different voices and perspectives in a tale at once sophisticated about the workings of power and deeply humanistic in its depictions of characters struggling at the margins.\n\nKaitlyn Greenidge\n\n“The Weight of History and the Search for Freedom.”\n\nMonday, November 1 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nInspired Writers Series host Phil Klay engaged in a conversation with Kaitlyn Greenidge titled “The Weight of History and the Search for Freedom.” Hailed by The New York Times as “a feat of monumental thematic imagination” and by Publisher’s Weekly as a “genius work of radical historical fiction,” Whiting-prize winner Greenidge’s Libertie explores the questions of personal freedom, trauma, motherhood, and Black liberation through the story of Libertie Sampson, a Black girl in Reconstruction-era Brooklyn whose doctor-mother expects Libertie to follow in her trailblazing path.\n\nDavid Philipps\n\n“The War for the Soul of the Navy SEALS”\n\nThursday, September 16 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Philipps and Inspired Writers Series host Phil Klay will discuss Philipps’ new book, Alpha: Eddie Gallagher and the War for the Soul of the Navy SEALs. Considered a war hero by some and a war criminal by many of the members of his own platoon, former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher rose to national prominence when Donald Trump pardoned him for his misconduct overseas. Utilizing a large array of sources including interviews, court documents, and contemporary texts and emails, Philipps' book carefully reconstructs the events of Gallagher’s deployment, the debates that raged among the members of his unit, and the disturbing response of their leadership when they came forward with concerns about war crimes.\n\nCo-Hosted by MFA Professor Phil Klay and Jacob Siegel\n\nSpecial Guest: Vinson Cunningham\n\nManifesto! A Podcast\n\nThursday, April 22, 2021\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nFree Virtual Event\n\nPresented in partnership with the Quick Center for the Arts\n\nSpecial Live Episode: “Fratelli Tutti and Fairview”\n\nJoin us for a live recording of Manifesto! A Podcast, your regular visit to the archives of vanity, where men and women who had stopped making myths turned to issuing commandments.\n\nYour guides for this journey are Fairfield University MFA Professor Phil Klay, author of Missionaries and the National Book Award-winning Redeployment, and Jacob Siegel, a senior writer at Tablet magazine. Our special guest, Vinson Cunningham, is a staff writer and a theater critic at The New Yorker. We will be discussing the most recent encyclical from Pope Francis, Fratelli Tutti, as well as the play Fairview, by Jackie Sibblies Drury.\n\nHosted by MFA Professor Phil Klay\n\n“Broken and Invaluable Institutions”\n\nThursday, May 6, 2021\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nFree Virtual Event\n\nAs a series of political, economic, and natural crises have exposed the weaknesses of American institutions, a number of writers have explored the complex ways those institutions shape our lives, for good and ill. Few do so in a more viscerally powerfully way than the writers Kirstin Valdez Quade and Ryan Leigh Dostie.\n\nThe Five Wounds, Quade’s highly anticipated debut novel, delicately explores the way a local religious association and a nonprofit program for teen mothers influence the lives of one family in New Mexico, exposing them to opportunity, pain, abuse of power, and fellowship.\n\nFormation, Ryan Leigh Dostie’s memoir of her time in the military, charts her deployment, her growth as a soldier and a person, as well as the military’s horrific mishandling of her rape at the hands of a fellow servicemember.\n\nWar By Other Means\n\nMarch 2, 2021\n\n8 p.m.\n\nFree Virtual Event\n\nPresented in partnership with the Quick Center for the Arts\n\nIn a world where political debate often feels like a pitched battle, and sometimes devolves into actual violence, three military veterans and fiction writers discuss their recent novels which move beyond the narrow scope of combat to tackle broader subjects of politics, protest, and identity.\n\nMatt Gallagher's Empire City, veterans in an alternate version of America find themselves caught up in political violence and electoral intrigue. Elliot Ackerman's Red Dress in Black and White, meanwhile, takes us to the 2013 Ghezi Park protests in Istanbul, while Dewaine Farria's Revolutions of All Colors ranges from the Black Panthers in 1970s New Orleans to the work of modern-day contractors in Somalia to expatriate life in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nThe evening will be moderated by MFA writing professor and author Phil Klay and the writers will discuss the intersection of politics, war, and art.\n\nAlumnae Author Panel: A Writer's Journey To Page and Stage\n\nTuesday, October 20, 2020\n\nArt in the Aftermath of Violence\n\nFairfield MFA in Creative Writing professors Carol Ann Davis and Phil Klay in conversation with Rev. Thomas Fitzpatrick, S.J.\n\nNovember 16 at 7 p.m.\n\nWilliam Egginton\n\nThe Splintering of the American Mind\n\nTuesday, September 17, 2019\n\nTuesday, March 20, 2018 at 7 p.m.\n\nLisa Lucas\n\nDirector, National Book Foundation\n\nThe Need for Literature in Politically Challenging Times\n\nDolan School of Business Dining Room\n\nLucas is the Executive Director of the National Book Foundation. Prior to joining the Foundation, she served as the Publisher of Guernica, a non-profit online magazine focusing on writing that explores the intersection of art and politics with an international and diverse focus and as Director of Education at the Tribeca Film Institute. Lucas also serves on the literary council of the Brooklyn Book Festival. Find her on Twitter at @likalucaEndFragment\n\nThis event is free and open to the public and is co-presented by The Dean's Office of the College of Arts & Sciences, Connecticut Center for the Book, the Connecticut Writing Project, the DiMenna-Nyselius Library, the Humanities Institute, Departments of English, Politics and Philosophy, Core Writing, the Center for Faith and Public Life, the Women & Gender Studies Program, the Office of Student Engagement, the Office of Residence Life.\n\nThursday, February 22, 2018 at 7 p.m.\n\nBaron Wormser\n\nTom O’Vietnam\n\nFairfield University Bookstore – Downtown Fairfield\n\nBaron Wormser’s fifteenth book, Tom o’ Vietnam, traces the travels of a Vietnam vet in the fall of 1982. Tom o’ Vietnam is a very American road novel but also an evocation and investigation of Shakespeare’s King Lear. Like Tom o’ Bedlam, Tom is hiding out, “impersonating a person,” as he puts it. Tom journeys on one bus after another across a landscape that makes him wonder what he was fighting for. From Santa Fe to Washington, D.C., he meets fellow Americans who have their own stories to tell and who wonder about his. Along the way he spends time with his three sisters, all the while attempting to deal with the demons of the war and the ghosts of the Shakespearean tragedy he carries with him. Tom o’ Vietnam blends poetry, history, and dark wit, as it bears witness to the depths of eloquence and grief, anger and endurance.\n\nBaron Wormser is the author of nine books of poetry and a poetry chapbook. He is the co-author of two books about teaching poetry and the author of a memoir along with a book of short stories and a novel. He teaches in the Fairfield University MFA program. He also is the Founding Director of Frost Place Conference on Poetry and Teaching in Franconia, New Hampshire. He served as poet laureate of Maine from 2000 to 2005.\n\nThis event is free and open to the public and is presented by the MFA in Creative Writing\n\nTuesday, November 14, 2017 at 7 p.m.\n\nChristian Madsbjerg\n\nSensemaking: The Power of the Humanities in the Age of the Algorithm\n\nDolan School of Business Dining Room\n\nChristian Madsbjerg's Sensemaking is a provocative stand against the tyranny of big data and scientism, and an urgent, overdue defense of human intelligence. He argues that our fixation with data often masks stunning deficiencies, and the risks for humankind are enormous. Blind devotion to number crunching imperils our businesses, our educations, our governments and our life savings. Too many companies have lost touch with the humanity of their customers, while marginalizing workers with liberal arts-based skills. Contrary to popular thinking, Madsbjerg shows how many of today's biggest success stories stem not from \"quant\" thinking but from deep, nuanced engagement with culture, language, and history. He calls this method sensemaking.\n\n\"Madsbjerg thinks that if businesses accept pure data as the only truth, they are in danger of losing their ability to understand people.

The eldest of three sons born to a trucker and an office-worker, who lived in the idyllic village of Apple Creek, Ohio, Tullis was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at age 15. In short order, the sports-mad teenager found himself on the cancer ward of Akron Children’s Hospital. One of the lucky ones, he walked out and kept on going.\n\nYears later, as a journalist and college professor, Tullis began to wonder about all the friends and caregivers he’d left behind on 4-North. As his curiosity intensified, he decided to seek them out. Running With Ghosts is about friendship, loss, triumph, and closure: one man’s effort to understand more fully a life shaped by a random mutation in the code of his DNA.\n\nMatt Tullis is an assistant professor of digital journalism and English at Fairfield University. He is the host and producer of Gangrey: The Podcast and is an associate editor for River Teeth: A Journal of Nonfiction Narrative.\n\nThis event offers free inspiration for writers.

Philip, an award-winning prose writer, wrote poems. Evans, an internationally renowned sculptor, made watercolors. Water Rising tells the story of this remarkable collaboration. Philip’s realist poems—about nature, beauty, love, and loss, set amongst Evans’ abstract, deeply hued, layered watercolors, create a book which is more than just a gorgeous read and a visual feast. What emerges in this book is a stunning and original collaboration, which, as Worcester Art Museum Director, Matthias Waschek, points out in his introduction, extends how we think about the relationship between painting and poetry.\n\nLeila Philip is the author of three books of nonfiction prose. The Road Through Miyama, Hidden Dialogue; A Discussion Between Women in Japan and the United States, and the award-winning memoir, A Family Place: A Hudson Valley Farm, Three Centuries, Five Wars, One Family.

Weaving narratives of family, the university classroom and administration, her husband’s work as a police officer, and her work with students and the Poetry for Peace effort that her writing center sponsors in the local schools, she recounts her efforts to respond to moments of violence with a pedagogy of peace. “Can we not acknowledge that our experiences with pain anywhere should render us more, not less, capable of responding to it everywhere?” she asks. “Compassion, it seems to me, is an infinitely renewable resource.”\n\nElizabeth H.

Taken together, these ten figures illuminate the hidden cultural history of Nazi Germany, while individually providing haunting portraits of people facing excruciating life choices and grave moral and aesthetic questions. Their personal stories provide a radically new way of coming to grips with a regime which Hitler sought to make a “dictatorship of genius.” It is a story, by turns, of despair and determination, of illusion and reality, of hope and tragedy.\n\n\"A persuasive, nuanced and surprising picture of German culture under the Nazis.\" - Kirkus Review\n\nJonathan Petropoulos is the John V.

The Bills' incredible skill and teamwork on the field was matched only by their single-minded determination as, in the four years spanning 1991 to 1994, the team won four consecutive conference championships, and lost four consecutive Super Bowls. The peaks and nadirs of their record reflect a fascinatingly dynamic, uneven, and—at times—uncontrollable array of talents. Valerio renders in sharp detail how the Bills' unique culture was formed by an unlikely ecosystem of world-class athletes hunkered down in bleak western New York, far away from the celebrity playgrounds of other pro teams. Meticulously researched and carefully crafted, this one-of-a-kind look inside the Super Bowl-era Buffalo Bills is based on extensive interviews with the key players, coaches, and management, including Hall of Famers Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, as well as coach Marv Levy, general manager Bill Polian, and many others, including players and coaches from opposing teams, and the reporters who covered them.\n\n‌Wednesday, April 15 at 7 pm\n\nRachel Basch\n\nThe Listener\n\nFairfield University Bookstore\n\n499 Post Road, Fairfield CT\n\nThe Listener explores the ways in which we conceal and reveal our identities.
