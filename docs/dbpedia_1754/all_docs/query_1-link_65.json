        "text": "Compiled by Barbara Lewis Burger\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nIllustrations\n\nOrganization of the Guide and Scope of the Entries\n\nPart I. Federal Records\n\nPart II. Donated Materials\n\nIndex\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for administering the permanently valuable noncurrent records of the Federal Government. These archival holdings include documents, maps, drawings, printed matter, photographs, motion picture films, video recordings, sound recordings, and electronic records. The records date from the time of the Continental Congress, 1774-89, and include most of the basic records of the Federal Government produced by Congress, the courts, the executive departments, and independent agencies.\n\nThe purpose of this guide is to describe pictorial materials among the holdings of the National Archives of the United States and to assist researchers in locating these documents. All of the records described in this guide are in the custody of the Still Picture Branch of the Special Archives Division. Not covered by this guide are photographs and illustrative materials that are integral parts of reports, studies, and other textual records housed in other branches in the National Archives; photographs in the Regional Archives, Federal Records Centers, and Presidential libraries; or aerial mapping photographs among the holdings of the Cartographic and Architectural Branch, Special Archives Division.\n\nThe National Archives began acquiring still pictures from Federal agencies shortly after its establishment in 1934. Today, the Still Picture Branch maintains approximately 6 million photographs and graphics from over 170 departments, agencies, and bureaus. The Branch also maintains a small collection of donated materials.\n\nAs with other units in the National Archives, the records in the Still Picture Branch are organized for administrative and physical control by record group. A record group most frequently consists of the records of a single agency (and its predecessors) at the bureau level of Government, such as the records of the Children's Bureau (RG 102). The records of the head of an executive department and units with department-wide responsibility may be assigned to a general record group, such as the General Records of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (RG 207). Less frequently, records of a number of agencies may be brought together on the basis of similar function, such as the Records of Agencies for Voluntary Action Programs (RG 362).\n\nEach record group is assigned a number. When the National Archives record group system was developed in 1944, record groups 1 through 190 were established and numbered consecutively in the order in which the first records in each group were accessioned. Subsequent record groups generally have been numbered in the order in which they were established.\n\nWithin each record group, the basic archival unit of control is the series, which is a body of records arranged in some serial order or logically grouped together for some other reason. NARA attempts to keep the records within series in the order in which they were maintained by the creating agency, but agency filing systems were designed for administrative purposes and do not always benefit researchers. In order to assist researchers, NARA has prepared subject guides and preliminary inventories for many record groups. These publications provide information regarding agency histories, series titles, series dates, the quantity of records, the types of records, and brief descriptions of the subject content of series.\n\nIn this guide the same information is provided, but the emphasis is pictorial records, with attention given to both the type of record (medium) and the content of the series. The diverse nature of the contents of most of the series prohibits the compilation of exhaustive series descriptions, but an effort has been made to identify subjects, events, and personages. Occasionally photographs of unusual interest are mentioned specifically. It is hoped that this guide will lead the reader to explore more detailed descriptions and relevant finding aids available in the Still Picture Branch.\n\nThis guide should also be used in conjunction with the Guide to the National Archives of the United States (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1974). The National Archives Guide provides descriptions of all the holdings that were in NARA's custody on June 30, 1970, as well as a detailed explanation of the record group concept, and general regulations for the use of NARA records. Most importantly, detailed administrative histories of agencies, and the titles of available finding aids for each record group are included. A new edition of the Guide is in progress.\n\nSeveral National Archives publications contain information on still pictures and graphic arts. These publications include Select Audiovisual Records leaflets: Pictures of Indians in the United States, Photographs of the American West. 1861-1912, Pictures of the Civil War, Pictures of the Revolutionary War, United States Navy Ships. 1775-1941, Pictures from the Harmon Foundation: Artworks and Art Activities, Contemporary African Art from the Harmon Foundation, and Pictures of the American City. Also relevant are Broadsides and Posters from the National Archives (NARA 1986), The National Archives of the United States (Abrams, 1984), The American Image: Photographs from the National Archives, 1860-1960 (Pantheon Books, 1979), and War & Conflict: Selected Images from the National Archives, 1765-1970 (NARA, 1989). A list of other NARA publications is available from the National Archives upon request.\n\nMost of the records described here are readily available to researchers. Some records, however, may be temporarily unavailable or may have restrictions on access. It is suggested, therefore, that researchers query the Still Picture Branch about the availability of records in advance of their visit. Researchers should inquire also about guidelines and the rules and regulations governing research in the Still Picture Branch.\n\nPhotographic reproductions of Still Picture Branch records are available for a fee. The majority of records in the branch are in the public domain, but because agencies often acquire photographs from private sources, some items may be under copyright or carry publication restrictions, the owners of the rights to these images may impose certain fees for their use. NARA knowledge of these restrictions though is often limited. For further information on ordering and using photographs furnished by the National Archives, contact the Still Picture Branch.\n\nI wish to express my sincere appreciation to the many staff members of the National Archives who provided invaluable assistance. Special thanks go to Edward J. McCarter, Jonathan Heller, Paul White, James H. Trimble, and Patricia Richter whose advice, encouragement, and unqualified support helped me over many rough spots.\n\nI am thankful for the technical support given by Marie Allen who devoted many hours to getting this publication off the ground. Many thanks also to Robert M. Kvasnicka and Virginia C. Purdy of the Archival Publications Staff who edited this guide and made many helpful suggestions.\n\nI also wish to thank to the current and past Chiefs of the Still Picture Branch, Elizabeth L. Hill, Jack Saunders, Richard F. Myers, and Joe Doan Thomas who supported me throughout these many years. William H. Cunliffe, Director of the Special Archives Division, must also be thanked for allowing me the time to complete this guide. But it is to Sheila V. Mayo and Holly Reed of the Still Picture Branch to whom I extend my heartfelt gratitude. They worked indefatigably and were unflagging in their support. Without their help this guide could not have been completed.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBarbara Lewis Burger is an archivist in the Still Picture Branch, Special Archives Division, National Archives and Records Administration. She has served as the Assistant Chief for Reference in the Still Picture Branch, and as the Assistant to the Director of Special Archives Division. Mrs. Burger has a master's degree from The Catholic University of America and an undergraduate degree from Howard University, and has worked with still pictures for over twelve years.\n\nIllustrations\n\nThis section will include information on interpreting the captions of the photos included in the guide and general ordering instructions.\n\nOrganization of the Guide and Scope of the Entries\n\nGeneral Organization\n\nThis guide is organized into two parts. The first part, \"Federal Records,\" describes the accessioned records of the Federal Government in the custody of the Still Picture Branch as of June 30, 1989, according to the record group to which the records have been allocated. The record groups are in order numerically. The Still Picture Branch does not hold records from some agencies for which record groups have been established. Thus there are gaps in the numerical sequence followed in this guide.\n\nThe second part of the guide contains descriptions of photographic and graphic materials donated to the Branch and the National Archives. Information on the donations is by collection. The collections are arranged roughly in chronological order according to the content dates of the materials described.\n\nScope of the Entries\n\nThe following key illustrates the important elements of the format of entry descriptions in both Part I and Part II of this guide.\n\n(A) In Part I, this is the record group title. In Part II, it is the section heading. Collection titles for donated materials are indicated elsewhere (F).\n\n(B) RG is the abbreviation for record group, followed by the record group number. This does not apply to Donated Materials.\n\n(C) These are the informational content dates of the still pictures in this record group or collection. This date represents the time period for the subject pictured and is not necessarily the date the records were created, accumulated, or organized. Those organizational dates when known are indicated in the body of the description, if they differ from the informational content date. This departure from usual NARA practice was made because we believe that the readers of this guide are primarily interested in knowing the time frames of the subjects pictured, particularly since many of the agency files contain retrospective information.\n\n(D) The number of items (discrete images) in a record group or of all of the Donated Materials under the custody of the Still Picture Branch. The count for individual series is not given.\n\n(E) The type of record or medium if easily identifiable. Terms:\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS - A general term that refers to both prints and negatives.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS - A more specific term. Printing types when known are indicated, such as cyanotypes.\n\nCard Photographs - refers to photographic print on commercially produced cardboard mounts of standard sizes.\n\nStereographs - refers to photographic prints only.\n\nPanoramas - refers to photographic prints only.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC NEGATIVES - A more specific term that refers to film base items usually. Where entire series consist of glass negatives it is noted.\n\nSLIDES - refers to positive transparencies in cardboard mounts - 2\"x2\" in size.\n\nLANTERN SLIDES - refers to positive transparencies made or mounted on glass - usually 3 1/4\"x4\" in size.\n\nART, WORKS OF ART - General terms. When specific art techniques are known, they are indicated.\n\nPOSTER - Generally refers only to printed items, not the original art from which posters are printed.\n\nPORTRAIT - Refers to photographs of an individual only, usually a bust-length image.\n\nAERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS - Primarily oblique angle images, usually not taken under mapping purposes to scale.\n\n(F) Series descriptions. Descriptions are usually arranged chronologically. Series with similar content information are often described together. Collection titles for donated materials are indicated here.\n\n(G) Informational content dates for a series.\n\n(H) Names of photographers when known are noted.\n\n(I) Series designators. Often several series are described together, and so several series designators may follow a description. When referring to series, please cite the record group number or collection title for donated materials and the series designation.\n\n(J) This is the entry number for the descriptions in this guide. When referring to individual descriptions you may also cite this guide and the entry number.\n\nPart I.
