        "text": "Abstract\n\nSinonasal malignancies (SNMs) adversely impact patients' quality of life (QOL) and are frequently identified at an advanced stage. Because these tumors are rare, there are few studies that examine the specific QOL areas that are impacted. This knowledge would help improve the care of these patients.In this prospective, multi-institutional study, 273 patients with SNMs who underwent definitive treatment with curative intent were evaluated. We used the University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQOL) instrument over 5 years from diagnosis to identify demographic, treatment, and disease-related factors that influence each of the 12 UWQOL subdomains from baseline to 5 -years post-treatment.Multivariate models found endoscopic resection predicted improved pain (vs. nonsurgical treatment CI 2.4, 19.4, p = 0.01) and appearance versus open (CI 27.0, 35.0, p < 0.001) or combined (CI 10.4, 17.1, p < 0.001). Pterygopalatine fossa involvement predicted worse swallow (CI -10.8, -2.4, p = 0.01) and pain (CI -17.0, -4.0, p < 0.001). Neck dissection predicted worse swallow (CI -14.8, -2.8, p < 0.001), taste (CI -31.7, -1.5, p = 0.02), and salivary symptoms (CI -28.4, -8.6, p < 0.001). Maxillary involvement predicted worse chewing (CI 9.8, 33.2; p < 0.001) and speech (CI -21.8, -5.4, p < 0.001) relative to other sites. Advanced T stage predicted worse anxiety (CI -13.0, -2.0, p = 0.03).Surgical approach, management of cervical disease, tumor extent, and site of involvement impacted variable UWQOL symptom areas. Endoscopic resection predicted better pain, appearance, and chewing compared with open. These results may aid in counseling patients regarding potential QOL expectations in their SNM treatment and recovery course.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.23386\n\nView details for PubMedID 38884276\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground Sinonasal debridement is typically performed in the weeks following endonasal skull base surgery (ESBS). In the pediatric population, this second-look procedure may require general anesthesia; however, there is currently little evidence assessing the benefit of this practice. Methods This was a multicenter retrospective study of pediatric patients (age <18 years) undergoing a planned second-look debridement under general anesthesia following ESBS. Intraoperative findings, interventions performed, and perioperative complications were reviewed. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify associations between intraoperative findings and clinical factors. Results We reviewed 69 cases of second-look debridements (age mean 8.6 ± 4.2 years, range: 2-18 years), occurring a mean of 18.3 ± 10.3 days following ESBS. All abnormal findings were noted in patients age ≤12 years. Synechiae were noted in 8.7% of cases, bacterial rhinosinusitis in 2.9%, and failed reconstruction with cerebrospinal fluid leak in 4.5% (two cases of flap malposition and one case of flap necrosis). All failed reconstructions were noted following expanded endonasal cases for craniopharyngioma, and in each case, a revision reconstruction was performed during the second-look surgery. Synechiae were not significantly associated with younger age, revision cases, or cases with reconstructive flaps. There were no perioperative complications. Conclusion Second-look debridement under general anesthesia may be useful in the identification and intervention of sinonasal pathology following endoscopic skull base surgery, particularly in children ≤12 years old or those with pedicled flap reconstructions. Larger controlled studies are warranted to validate this practice and refine indications and timing of this second procedure.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1055/a-2048-7564\n\nView details for PubMedID 38721369\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11076083\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is common among people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). The Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) is a validated instrument that evaluates olfactory-specific quality-of-life. The QOD minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and factors associated with olfactory improvement after elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor have not been determined for PwCF.METHODS: Prospective observational data were pooled from three studies that enrolled adult PwCF with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). QOD scores and disease characteristics were assessed. To evaluate internal consistency and calculate the QOD MCID, Cronbach's alpha and four distribution-based methods were employed. For participants who enrolled prior to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, QOD scores were obtained at baseline and after elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor initiation. Multivariable regression was used to identify factors associated with QOD improvement.RESULTS: Of 129 PwCF included, 65 had QOD scores before and 3-6 months after starting elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Mean baseline QOD score was 6.5±7.9. Mean Cronbach's alpha was ≥0.85. The MCID estimates were as follows: Cohen's effect size=1.6, standard error of measurement=2.5, baseline standard deviation=4.0, and minimal detectable change=6.9. Mean MCID was 3.7. Of those with pre/post elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor QOD scores, the mean change in QOD was -1.3±5.4. After elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, QOD improvement surpassed the MCID in 22% of participants (14/65). Worse baseline QOD scores and nasal polyps were associated with improved QOD scores after elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (both p<0.04).CONCLUSION: The QOD MCID in PwCF was estimated to be 3.7. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor led to qualitative but not clinically meaningful improvements in QOD score for most PwCF; PwCF with worse baseline QOD scores and nasal polyps improved in a clinically significant manner.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.23312\n\nView details for PubMedID 38145393\n\nAbstract\n\nTo investigate how eustachian tube dysfunction symptoms change following surgical treatment of nonsinusitis-related nasal obstruction.Retrospective chart review.Single academic center.We assessed patients who underwent septoplasty, turbinate reduction, or both for nasal obstruction. Chronic sinusitis patients were excluded. Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) symptoms were studied using the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7), collected preoperatively and postoperatively (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months postop). Patients with preoperative ETDQ-7 > 14.5 were considered to have clinically significant symptoms. Sinonasal outcomes test scores were also assessed. Pre- and postoperative ETDQ-7 scores were compared using t test. Multivariate linear regression analysis identified factors associated with ETDQ-7 change.We analyzed 259 patients. Preoperatively, 37.5% of patients with nasal obstruction had clinically significant ETD symptoms. These patients exhibited significant improvement in ETDQ-7 at all postoperative timepoints from 23.3 ± 7.6 at baseline to 19.1 ± 9.1 at 1 week, 16.5 ± 8.0 at 1 month, 16.2 ± 7.8 at 3 months, and 16.7 ± 10.4 at 6 months (all P < .01). In patients without baseline ETD symptoms, (baseline ETDQ-7: 9.1 ± 2.3) ETDQ-7 scores did not change significantly at postoperative timepoints, except for an acute worsening at 1 week postoperatively (10.7 ± 5.1, P < .001). Regression analysis showed that higher preoperative ETDQ-7 score (β = -0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.10 to -0.59) and postoperative antihistamine spray usage (β = -8.70, 95% CI: -14.20 to -3.20) were associated with ETDQ-7 improvement, while comorbid GERD (β = 7.50, 95% CI: 3.42-11.58) and asthma (β = 5.62, 95% CI: 0.80-10.45) were negatively associated with improvement.Surgical correction of nasal obstruction may improve ETD symptoms.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/ohn.607\n\nView details for PubMedID 38037398\n\nAbstract\n\nCurrent olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) staging systems inadequately delineate locally advanced tumors, do not incorporate tumor grade, and poorly estimate survival and recurrence.The primary aims of this study were to (1) examine the clinical covariates associated with survival and recurrence of ONB in a modern-era multicenter cohort and (2) incorporate Hyams tumor grade into existing staging systems to assess its ability to estimate survival and recurrence.This retrospective, multicenter, case-control study included patients with ONB who underwent treatment between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2021, at 9 North American academic medical centers.Standard-of-care ONB treatment.The main outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) as C statistics for model prediction.A total of 256 patients with ONB (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [15.6] years; 115 female [44.9%]; 141 male [55.1%]) were included. The 5-year rate for OS was 83.5% (95% CI, 78.3%-89.1%); for DFS, 70.8% (95% CI, 64.3%-78.0%); and for DSS, 94.1% (95% CI, 90.5%-97.8%). On multivariable analysis, age, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, involvement of bilateral maxillary sinuses, and positive margins were associated with OS. Only AJCC stage was associated with DFS. Only N stage was associated with DSS. When assessing the ability of staging systems to estimate OS, the best-performing model was the novel modification of the Dulguerov system (C statistic, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.59-0.76), and the Kadish system performed most poorly (C statistic, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50-0.63). Regarding estimation of DFS, the modified Kadish system performed most poorly (C statistic, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.51-0.66), while the novel modification of the AJCC system performed the best (C statistic, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.66-0.80). Regarding estimation of DSS, the modified Kadish system was the best-performing model (C statistic, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94), and the unmodified Kadish performed the worst (C statistic, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.51-0.68). The ability for novel ONB staging systems to estimate disease progression across stages was also assessed. In the novel Kadish staging system, patients with stage VI disease were approximately 7 times as likely to experience disease progression as patients with stage I disease (hazard ratio [HR], 6.84; 95% CI, 1.60-29.20). Results were similar for the novel modified Kadish system (HR, 8.99; 95% CI, 1.62-49.85) and the novel Dulguerov system (HR, 6.86; 95% CI, 2.74-17.18).The study findings indicate that 5-year OS for ONB is favorable and that incorporation of Hyams grade into traditional ONB staging systems is associated with improved estimation of disease progression.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaoto.2023.1939\n\nView details for PubMedID 37535372\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives Sinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) is an extremely rare and challenging sinonasal malignancy with a poor prognosis. Standard treatment involves complete surgical resection, but the role of adjuvant therapy remains unclear. Crucially, our understanding of its clinical presentation, course, and optimal treatment remains limited, and few advancements in improving its management have been made in the recent past. Methods We conducted an international multicenter retrospective analysis of 505 SNMM cases from 11 institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, and continental Europe. Data on clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes were assessed. Results One-, three-, and five-year recurrence-free and overall survival were 61.4, 30.6, and 22.0%, and 77.6, 49.2, and 38.3%, respectively. Compared with disease confined to the nasal cavity, sinus involvement confers significantly worse survival; based on this, further stratifying the T3 stage was highly prognostic ( p < 0.001) with implications for a potential modification to the current TNM staging system. There was a statistically significant survival benefit for patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy, compared with those who underwent surgery alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-0.96, p = 0.021). Immune checkpoint blockade for the management of recurrent or persistent disease, with or without distant metastasis, conferred longer survival (HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.25-1.00, p = 0.036). Conclusions We present findings from the largest cohort of SNMM reported to date. We demonstrate the potential utility of further stratifying the T3 stage by sinus involvement and present promising data on the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors for recurrent, persistent, or metastatic disease with implications for future clinical trials in this field.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1055/s-0042-1750178\n\nView details for PubMedID 37405239\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10317567\n\nAbstract\n\nBudesonide irrigations (BI) are commonly used to control inflammation in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). In 2016 we reported an analysis of long-term budesonide irrigation with regard to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. We present a follow-up analysis in a larger cohort of patients with longer follow-up.Patients were candidates for stimulated cortisol testing after regularly performing BI for CRS at least daily for ≥ 6 months. We retrospectively evaluated all patients who received stimulated cortisol testing at our center between 2012-22. We correlated cortisol levels with use of BI and other forms of corticosteroids.We analyzed 401 cortisol test results in 285 patients. The mean duration of use was 34 months. Overall, 21.8% of patients were hypocortisolemic (<18 ug/dL) at first test. In patients who used only BI the rate of hypocortisolemia was 7.5%, whereas in patients who also used concurrent oral and inhaled corticosteroids, the rate was 40-50%. Lower cortisol levels were associated with male gender (p<.0001) and concomitant use of oral and inhaled steroids (p<.0001). Duration of budesonide irrigation use was not significantly associated with lower cortisol levels (p = 0.701), nor was greater dosing frequency (p = 0.289).Prolonged use of BI alone is not likely to cause hypocortisolemia in the majority of patients. However, concomitant use of inhaled and oral steroids, and male gender may be associated with hypocortisolemia. Surveillance of cortisol levels may be considered in vulnerable populations who use budesonide irrigations regularly, particularly in patients using other forms of corticosteroids with known systemic absorption.

Primary analysis was performed on patients who underwent post-RT procedures, who were split into non-DTI and DTI groups. Patients were classified as DTI if they (i) required >1 attempt to intubate, (ii) failed to be intubated, or (iii) experienced complications attributed to airway management. Secondary analysis was performed between patients who underwent post-RT procedures (procedure group) and those who did not (control group).RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty patients were included, and 71.3% underwent post-RT procedures, with no differences in characteristics between the procedure and control groups. One-hundred and fifty procedures were identified, and 28.0% were categorized as DTI. There was no difference in patient characteristics or airway assessment measures between DTI and non-DTI groups. Regression analysis revealed concurrent cervical mobility restriction, and trismus increased DTI incidence by 7.1-fold (p=0.011). Being non-White was an independent predictor of DTI. The incidence of high-grade intraoperative laryngoscopic view was lower in the non-DTI compared to the DTI group (20.4% vs. 64.3%, p<0.0001). Failure to intubate occurred in 2.0% of cases, and 6.0% cases had perioperative complications. Based on preoperative assessment, sensitivity of predicting DTI was 54.8% and specificity was 63.9%.CONCLUSION: NPC patients frequently undergo post-RT procedures requiring complex airway management. Rates of DTI and failed intubation are significantly higher than those in the general surgical population, and the ability to predict DTI with standard preoperative airway measures is poor.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4 Laryngoscope, 2023.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lary.30767\n\nView details for PubMedID 37249176\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Social media (SM) is an increasingly popular medium for the medical community to engage with patients, trainees, and colleagues. This review aimed to identify reported uses of SM in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS), assess the quality of evidence supporting these uses, and identify gaps in the literature. With the relative lack of regulatory guidelines for the development of SM content, we hypothesized that the quality of content available on SM would be highly variable.DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: A scoping review was performed of English-language peer-reviewed studies published to date discussing SM use in any form within OHNS. Three reviewers independently screened all abstracts. Two reviewers independently extracted data of interest from the full text of articles identified from the preliminary abstract screen.RESULTS: 171 studies were included, with 94 (54.9%) studies published between 2020 and 2022. 104 (60.8%) studies were conducted in the US. 135 (78.9%) used cross-sectional or survey-based methodology; only 7 (4.1%) were controlled studies. SM was most commonly employed for professional networking (n=37 [21%]), and within subspecialties of otology (n=38 [22%]) and rhinology/allergy (n=25 [15%]). Facebook was most frequently used for study recruitment (n=23 [13.5%]), YouTube for patient education (n=15 [14.6%]), and Twitter for professional networking (n=16 [9.4%]).CONCLUSION: SM use within OHNS is increasing rapidly, with applications including patient education, professional networking, and study recruitment. Despite myriad articles, there remains a paucity of well-controlled studies. As SM becomes integrated into healthcare, particularly for applications directly impacting patient care, higher levels of evidence are needed to understand its true impact.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce intraoperative blood loss and improve the visual field. This study evaluates the clinical efficacy of TXA when given at end of surgery to reduce postoperative bleeding.METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted from April to November 2021. Patients scheduled to undergo endoscopic sinus or nasal surgery were randomized to receive an intravenous dose of 1g TXA or saline intraoperatively prior to extubation. A 10-inch visual analog scale (VAS) was used to query patients regarding postoperative bleeding each day for one week. The medical record was examined to determine the need for additional evaluations or interventions for epistaxis.RESULTS: 40 patients completed the study. The mean/SD postoperative bleeding VAS for the TXA group on the day of surgery was not significantly different from the saline group (4.82 [2.18] in vs 5.03 [2.14] in, p = 0.8). There were no significant differences between treatment arms on any postoperative day through day 7 (0.67 [1.84] in vs 0.87 [0.99] in, p = 0.7), nor in the reduction in VAS compared to the respective baseline on the day of surgery. There were no significant differences in terms of additional interventions (e.g. additional evaluation in recovery, ED, or clinic, need for packing, or return to OR).CONCLUSION: While TXA has previously demonstrated efficacy to reduce intraoperative bleeding during sinonasal surgery, when postoperative bleeding is already minimal at baseline, TXA does not appear to reduce it significantly further.

In this prospective study, we evaluated 107 consecutive primary pituitary adenomas operated on by a single neurosurgeon including 28 corticotroph, 27 gonadotroph, 24 somatotroph, 17 lactotroph, 5 null-cell and 6 plurihormonal. In each case, we performed direct endoscopic intraoperative inspection of the medial wall of the cavernous sinus, which was surgically removed when invasion was visualized. This was performed irrespective of tumor functional status. Medial wall resection was performed in 47% of pituitary adenomas, and 39/50 walls confirmed pathologic evidence of invasion, rendering a positive predictive value of intraoperative evaluation of medial wall invasion of 78%. We show for the first-time dramatic disparities in the frequency of medial wall invasion among pathological subtypes. Somatotroph tumors invaded the medial wall much more often than other adenoma subtypes, 81% intraoperatively and 69% histologically, followed by plurihormonal tumors (40%) and gonadotroph cell tumors (33%), both with intraoperative positive predictive value of 100%. The least likely to invade were corticotroph adenomas, at a rate of 32% intraoperatively and 21% histologically, and null-cell adenomas at 0%. Removal of the cavernous sinus medial wall was not associated with permanent cranial nerve morbidity nor carotid artery injury, although 4 patients (all Knosp 3-4) experienced transient diplopia. Medial wall resection in acromegaly resulted in the highest potential for biochemical remission ever reported, with an average postoperative day 1 GH levels of 0.96 ug/L and surgical remission rates of 92% based on normalization of IGF-1 levels after surgery (mean = 15.56 months; range 3-30 months). Our findings suggest that tumor invasion of the medial wall of the cavernous sinus may explain the relatively low biochemical remission rates currently seen for acromegaly and illustrate the relevance of advanced intradural surgical approaches for successful and durable outcomes in endonasal pituitary surgery for functional adenomas.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41598-022-12980-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 35705579\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: Telemedicine and telementoring have had a significant boost across all medical and surgical specialties over the last decade and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this scoping review is to synthesize the current use of telemedicine and telementoring in otorhinolaryngology and head and neck surgery.Data Sources: PubMed and Cochrane Library.Review Methods: A scoping review search was conducted, which identified 469 articles. Following full-text screening by 2 researchers, 173 articles were eligible for inclusion and further categorized via relevant subdomains.Conclusions: Virtual encounters and telementoring are the 2 main applications of telemedicine in otolaryngology. These applications can be classified into 7 subdomains. Different ear, nose, and throat subspecialties utilized certain telemedicine applications more than others; for example, almost all articles on patient engagement tools are rhinology based. Overall, telemedicine is feasible, showing similar concordance when compared with traditional methods; it is also cost-effective, with high patient and provider satisfaction.Implications for Practice: Telemedicine in otorhinolaryngology has been widely employed during the COVID-19 pandemic and has a huge potential, especially with regard to its distributing quality care to rural areas. However, it is important to note that with current exponential use, it is equally crucial to ensure security and privacy and integrate HIPAA-compliant systems (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the big data era. It is expected that many more applications developed during the pandemic are here to stay and will be refined in years to come.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/2473974X211072791\n\nView details for PubMedID 35274073\n\nAbstract\n\nGiven its role in the disease pathophysiology, inhibition of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis has received attention as a potential strategy to reduce epistaxis associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This study evaluates the efficacy of a submucosal injection of bevacizumab, a VEGF-inhibitor, in reducing the severity of epistaxis and improving quality of life when given at the time of operative electrocautery.This randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a single institution from 2014 to 2019. Patients scheduled to undergo operative bipolar electrocautery of nasal telangiectasias were randomized to receive a submucosal injection of saline or bevacizumab at time of surgery. Surveys to assess epistaxis severity and quality-of-life (QOL), including the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) and Short Form 12 (SF-12), were administered preoperatively and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months postoperatively. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of the ESS instrument is reported to be 0.71.Of 39 patients enrolled, 37 (94.9%) completed the study. The saline group demonstrated reduced ESS versus baseline at 1 (-1.2, p = 0.01) and 4 (-1.2, p = 0.05) months post-procedure. The bevacizumab group demonstrated reduced ESS versus baseline at 1 (-2.3, p<0.001), 2 (-2.3, p<0.001), 4 (-2.0, p = 0.003), and 6 (-1.3, p = 0.05) months post-procedure. The additive benefit of bevacizumab over saline exceeded the MCID at 1, 2, and 4 months but the difference was not statistically significant.The addition of a single treatment of submucosal bevacizumab may be associated with additional clinically meaningful benefit for up to 4 months when compared to electrocautery alone.

The objective of this study was to assess the rate and risk factors for VTE in endoscopic skull base surgery (ESBS).METHODS: This was a retrospective review of adults undergoing ESBS at a tertiary academic center. Incidence of VTE in the 30-day postoperative period was recorded. Logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with VTE.RESULTS: 1122 ESBS cases between 2009 and 2019 were studied. Almost no cases (96.1%) employed perioperative VTE chemoprophylaxis. The overall incidence of VTE was 2.3% (26/1122). Malignant pathologies had a higher rate of VTE compared to nonmalignant pathologies (4.5% vs 2.0%, OR 2.85, 95%CI 1.22-6.66). Factors associated with an increased risk of VTE included a Caprini score greater than 5 (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.28-1.83); multiple preoperative endocrinopathies such as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) (OR 22.48, 95% CI 3.93-128.70), adrenal insufficiency (OR 5.24, 95% CI 1.82-15.03), hypercortisolism (OR 4.46, 95% CI 1.47-13.56), and hypothyroidism (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.66-8.20), each 10-hour increment of lumbar drain duration (OR 1.16, 95%CI 1.08-1.25), and each 10-hour increment for duration of hospitalization (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.06).CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VTE following ESBS is relatively low. Factors with a higher association with VTE include malignancy, preoperative endocrinopathies, higher Caprini score, prolonged lumbar drain duration, and prolonged hospitalization. Further study is needed to validate these findings and to refine clinical decision making around perioperative VTE prophylaxis. This article is protected by copyright.

We sought to examine the effects of ESS timing on pulmonary health in this population.METHODS: A retrospective review of all adult lung transplant patients with CF who underwent ESS at our academic medical center over a near 25-year period was performed. Patients were split into two groups based on median time from lung transplantation to ESS. Twenty-three patients were included (12 ESS early and 11 ESS delayed). Outcomes included changes in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) from baseline, pre-operative to post-operative measurements, the number and duration of hospitalizations for pulmonary exacerbations, and the number of antibiotic courses used specifically to treat pulmonary exacerbations during the 12 months before and after ESS.RESULTS: Baseline demographics, operative history, and pulmonary function characteristics were similar between groups. While the ESS early group saw significant improvement from pre-operative percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1 ) at 12 months post-operatively (CI: 0.729 - 11.452, P=0.030), there were no significant post-operative PFT changes for the ESS delayed group. Post-operative improvement in FEV1 and ppFEV1 at 12 months was significantly higher for the ESS early group relative to the ESS delayed group (CI: 0.010 - 0.583, P=0.043; CI: 1.240 - 16.692, P=0.025; respectively). The ESS early group had a significant reduction in the need for total antibiotic courses compared to the ESS delayed group (ESS early median: -1, IQR: -1.5 to -0.5vs ESS delayed median: 0, IQR: 0 to 0; P=0.027).CONCLUSION: Earlier ESS interventions following lung transplantation may improve pulmonary function and attenuate pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients.

Recent studies have shown a broad range of analgesic prescription patterns following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS).Objective: To compare the efficacy of different analgesic regimens after ESS.Design, Setting, and Participants: This multi-institutional, nonblinded randomized clinical trial was conducted at 6 tertiary centers across the US and Canada and included participants who underwent ESS for acute or chronic rhinosinusitis. The study was conducted from March 2019 to March 2020, and the data were analyzed in November to December 2020.Interventions: All participants received acetaminophen, 650 mg, as the first-line analgesic. From there, patients were randomized to either oxycodone rescue (oxycodone, 5 mg, as second-line therapy) or ibuprofen rescue (ibuprofen, 600 mg, as second-line therapy, with oxycodone, 5 mg, reserved for breakthrough pain).Main Outcomes and Measures: Baseline characteristics and disease severity were collected at enrollment. Medication logs, pain scores, and epistaxis measures were collected until postoperative day 7. The primary outcome was the postoperative visual analog scale score for pain. Brief Pain Inventory Pain Severity and Pain Interference Scores were also collected.Results: A total of 118 patients were randomized (62 [52.5%] oxycodone rescue, 56 [47.5%] ibuprofen rescue; mean [SD] age, 46.7 [16.3] years; 44 women [44.0%]; 83 White [83.0%], 7 Black [7.0%], and 7 Asian individuals [7.0%]). After exclusions for loss to follow-up and noncompliance, 51 remained in the oxycodone rescue group and 49 in the ibuprofen rescue group. The groups had similar demographic characteristics and disease severity. Thirty-two (63%) in the oxycodone rescue group had adequate pain management with acetaminophen only, while 19 (37%) consumed at least 1 oxycodone dose. In the ibuprofen rescue group, 18 (16%) required only acetaminophen, 28 (57%) used only acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and the remaining 13 (26%) consumed 1 or more oxycodone doses. The groups had similar average acetaminophen (9.69 vs 7.96 doses; difference, 1.73; 95% CI, -1.37 to 4.83) and oxycodone (1.89 vs 0.77 doses; difference, 1.13; 95% CI, -0.11 to 2.36) use. Both groups had similar postoperative visual analog scale scores. A subanalysis that compared opioids users with nonusers showed clinically significant lower pain scores in nonusers at multiple postoperative points.Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, most patients who underwent ESS could be treated postoperatively using a nonopioid regimen of either acetaminophen alone or acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Ibuprofen as a second-line therapy did not reduce overall narcotic consumption, but the overall narcotic use was low in both groups.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03783702.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaoto.2021.1839\n\nView details for PubMedID 34351376\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Management of sinonasal malignancy (SNM) often includes surgical resection as part of the multimodality treatment. Treatment-related surgical morbidity can occur, yet risk factors associated with complications in this population have not been sufficiently investigated.METHODS: Adult patients with histologically confirmed SNM whose primary treatment included surgical resection were prospectively enrolled into an observational, multi-institutional cohort study from 2015 to 2020. Sociodemographic, disease, and treatment data were collected. Complications assessed included cerebrospinal fluid leak, orbital injury, intracranial injury, diplopia, meningitis, osteoradionecrosis, hospitalization for neutropenia, and subsequent chronic rhinosinusitis. The surgical approach was categorized as endoscopic resection (ER) or open/combined resection (O/CR). Associations between factors and complications were analyzed using Student's t test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression modeling.RESULTS: Overall, 142 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three subjects had at least 1 complication (16.2%). On unadjusted analysis, adjuvant radiation therapy was associated with developing a complication (91.3% vs 65.5%, p = 0.013). Compared with the ER group (n = 98), the O/CR group (n = 44) had a greater percentage of higher T-stage lesions (p = 0.004) and more frequently received adjuvant radiation (84.1% vs 64.4%, p = 0.017) and chemotherapy (50.0% vs 30.6%, p = 0.038). Complication rates were similar between the ER and O/CR groups without controlling for other factors. Regression analysis that retained certain factors showed O/CR was associated with increased odds of experiencing a complication (odds ratio, 3.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-11.19).CONCLUSIONS: Prospective, multicenter evaluation of SNM treatment outcomes is feasible. Undergoing O/CR was associated with increased odds of developing a complication after accounting for radiation therapy. Further studies are warranted to build upon these findings.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.22833\n\nView details for PubMedID 34176231\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction: The current study aimed at investigating the occurrence and features of olfactory dysfunction in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.Materials and Methods: Patients with laboratory and clinically confirmed COVID-19 infection were enrolled in this longitudinal study. They were managed in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. The demographic, clinical, and outcome data were retrieved from patients' medical records. Olfactory dysfunction features, including the onset pattern, duration, and recovery time were investigated. The visual analog scale (VAS) was utilized as a self-rating subjective measurement of olfactory function.Results: According to the results, the mean age of the patients (n=502) was obtained at 46.8±18.5 years; moreover, 52.4% and 47.6% of cases were female and male, respectively. It was also revealed that 35.4% and 64.5% of the subjects were outpatients and hospitalized, respectively. Based on the findings, 178 (38.4%) subjects had olfactory dysfunction. The mean values of VAS in hyposmic patients were estimated at 2.5±2.5, 8.3 ±2.1, and 9.4±1.6 at the first evaluation, in 2 weeks, and after 1 month of follow-up (P<0.001). The onset of olfactory dysfunction was more suddenly (58.7%). The majority of cases experienced olfactory dysfunction at the same time as other symptoms 72(51.1%). Based on the results, 0.4% of subjects infected with COVID-19 had olfactory dysfunction as an isolated symptom. The olfactory dysfunction was recovered after 2 weeks in 18 (25.3%) anosmic and 37(46.8%) hyposmic patients.Conclusion: Olfactory dysfunction seemed to be an important symptom of COVID-19 infection. The occurrence of this disturbance as a transient self-limited condition was significantly higher among female subjects.\n\nView details for DOI 10.22038/ijorl.2021.51614.2750\n\nView details for PubMedID 34222108\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) can be salvaged with re-irradiation, open nasopharyngectomy, and more recently endoscopic nasopharyngectomy. However, long-term outcomes of endoscopic approaches are lacking. Thus, we report 5-year outcomes following endoscopic nasopharyngectomy for rNPC.METHODS: Patients who underwent endoscopic nasopharyngectomy for rNPC between January 2000 and January 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included if they had their first endoscopic nasopharyngectomy at least 5years prior to this study. Presenting (cTNM) status and recurrent (rTNM) status for each recurrence was determined. Outcomes included margin status, disease recurrence, death, and complication rates.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Four patients had a prior open nasopharyngectomy. Mean time follow-up was 74.3months (range=56.4-96months). Negative margins were achieved in 77% of initial cases. Positive margins were associated with higher rT stages. Re-recurrence was seen in 6 patients, which was also associated with a higher cStage and rStage. All patients with positive margins had re-recurrence. Four patients required repeat endoscopic nasopharyngectomy and two received chemoradiation. All four with a second endoscopic procedure had further disease recurrence. Five-year local disease-free and overall survival rates were 53.9 and 84.6%, respectively. The minor complication rate was 52.6%, major operative complication rate was 0.0%, and late complication rate was 23.1%.CONCLUSION: Endoscopic nasopharyngectomy demonstrates promising 5-year overall survival rate for rT1 and rT2 cases of rNPC with favorable complication rates. Lower rStages were associated with a higher disease-free rate, and lower cStages were associated with improved overall prognosis. Close surveillance and prompt management of recurrences can be associated with favorable long-term tumor control.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s40463-020-00482-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 33597031\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough oral corticosteroids are commonly prescribed following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyposis, there are little data to suggest that this is a beneficial practice.To assess the efficacy of oral corticosteroids following ESS in CRS without polyps.This prospective double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized noninferiority clinical trial conducted in a single academic tertiary rhinology practice included adults with CRS without polyps undergoing ESS. Of 81 patients recruited, 72 completed the study.Patients were randomized into 2 treatment groups: a 12-day postoperative taper of oral prednisone vs matched placebo tablets. All study patients also received a uniform 2-week postoperative regimen of oral antibiotics, fluticasone nasal spray, and saline rinses.The primary outcome measures were Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores and Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores, collected preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Scores were compared between treatment groups at each time point using longitudinal difference between treatment groups and analyzed using 2-way, repeated measures analysis of variance. Secondary outcome measures included treatment-related adverse effects.Overall, 72 patients (mean [SD] age, 49.4 [14.9] years; 36 men, 36 women) completed the study, with 33 in the prednisone arm and 39 in the placebo arm. When comparing longitudinal differences between treatment groups, there was no clinically meaningful difference observed in SNOT-22 total (F[4254] = 1.71, η2 = 0.01 [95% CI, 0.00-0.05]) or Lund-Kennedy scores (F[4247] = 1.23, η2 = 0.02 [95% CI, 0.00-0.50]). In SNOT-22 subdomain analyses, there was no clinically meaningful difference between treatment groups for rhinologic, extranasal rhinologic, ear/facial, or sleep subdomains. However, the prednisone group had worse longitudinal scores for psychological dysfunction compared with the placebo group (F[4254] = 3.18, η2 = 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.09]). Reported adverse effects were similar between the 2 treatment groups.In this randomized clinical trial of patients with CRS without polyps, oral prednisone following ESS conferred no additional benefit over placebo in terms of SNOT-22 total scores, SNOT-22 rhinologic subscores, or Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores up to 6 months after surgery. Patients receiving prednisone, however, did demonstrate worse SNOT-22 psychologic subdomain scores. These results suggest that the risks of oral corticosteroids may outweigh the benefits; thus use of oral corticosteroids after ESS for CRS without polyps should be carefully considered.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02748070.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaoto.2021.0011\n\nView details for PubMedID 33662124\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: There is no data currently available to direct nuanced treatment for recurrent acute and chronic rhinosinusitis (RARS, CRS) in patients on daily, long term medications that suppress the immune system.OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate the outcomes of different treatment pathways when treating immunosuppressed patients with chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.METHODS: A retrospective review of patients on immune suppressing medication presenting to a tertiary care center with RARS or CRS between the years 2014-2019 was completed. Patients were categorized into three groups based on treatment: medical management alone (MM), surgery after medical management (SAMM), or upfront surgery (US). Lund-Kennedy scores (LKS) and SNOT-22 scores were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months from presentation.RESULTS: 68 patients met inclusion criteria, with no difference in demographics between groups. Patients who were treated with US and SAMM had significantly higher baseline LKS than those who were treated with MM alone (p=0.050, p=0.039). Once this difference was controlled for, there was no significant difference in overall change of LKS between the three groups over time. There was no significant disparity in baseline SNOT-22 scores between the three groups, but patients who underwent US had a significantly higher improvement in SNOT-22 from baseline compared to those undergoing MM alone (p=0.013).CONCLUSION: Patients experiencing chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis who are taking immunosuppressive medication can significantly improve from both medical and surgical management, but upfront surgical management appears to result in greater disease resolution relative to medical management in those with CRS. More study is needed in the RARS patient population regarding upfront surgery versus medical management.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/1945892420947932\n\nView details for PubMedID 32746611\n\nAbstract\n\nPediatric craniopharyngiomas that were once thought to be inoperable or considered only for salvage medical therapy are now being reconsidered for aggressive surgical resection via endoscopic endonasal approaches. Here we review the operative video case of an 11-year-old with a giant complex craniopharyngioma that was resected via an endoscopic endonasal approach. Due to the extent of tumor burden near the basilar apex, a transclival approach was necessary. To accomplish this, a wide sphenoidotomy, posterior ethmoidectomy, and resection of the middle turbinate were necessary to create enough working space for the resection. We also highlight several key innovations in pediatric endoscopic endonasal surgery management and underscore a multidisciplinary approach that allows for the safe and successful treatment of these lesions. Our multidisciplinary team involves an experienced fellowship-trained endoscopic skull base surgeon and otolaryngologist, as well as a pediatric neurosurgeon, pediatric endocrinologist, pediatric anesthesiologist, and pediatric intensivists who play important roles in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care of the patient. Finally, we discuss critical surgical decision points including pituitary transposition, which has a lot of conceptual appeal when it is anatomically feasible but unfortunately, in our experience, has low functional preservation rates. Initially, we always aim to utilize pituitary transposition for tuberoinfundibular craniopharyngiomas, and once the relationship between the tumor and the stalk is determined, a decision on whether to preserve or sacrifice the stalk and pituitary gland is made. In this particular case, there was a salvageable stalk and the transposition was performed knowing that the chances for functional preservation were low.

Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification System class 1 or 2 were included. Anesthesia was administered by topical 4% lidocaine/oxymetazoline and submucosal injection of 1% lidocaine/1:200,000 epinephrine. Vital signs and pain were measured at baseline, postinjection, and 5-minute intervals throughout the procedure. Anxiety levels were scored using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors significantly associated with changes in each hemodynamic metric.Twenty-five patients were studied. This cohort was 52% male, mean age of 57.8 ± 14.4 years, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) median of 2. Mean procedure duration was 25.0 ± 10.3 minutes. Mean maximal increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 24.6 ± 17.8 mmHg from baseline. Mean maximal heart rate increase was 22.8 ± 10.8 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline. In multivariate regression analysis, when accounting for patient age, cardiac comorbidity, CCI, and ASA, older age was significantly associated with an increase of >20 mmHg in SBP (p = 0.043). Mean pain score during procedures was 1.5 ± 1.3 with a mean maximum of 4.0 ± 2.6. STAI anxiety scores did not change significantly from preprocedure to postprocedure (32.8 ± 11.6 to 31.0 ± 12.6, p = 0.46). No medical complications occurred.Although patients appear to tolerate office procedures well, providers should recognize the potential for significant fluctuations in blood pressure during the procedure, especially in older patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.22460\n\nView details for PubMedID 31899857\n\nAbstract\n\nThe sinonasal microbiome remains poorly defined, with our current knowledge based on a few cohort studies whose findings are inconsistent. Furthermore, the variability of the sinus microbiome across geographical divides remains unexplored. We characterise the sinonasal microbiome and its geographical variations in both health and disease using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 410 individuals from across the world. Although the sinus microbial ecology is highly variable between individuals, we identify a core microbiome comprised of Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella species in both healthy and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cohorts. Corynebacterium (mean relative abundance = 44.02%) and Staphylococcus (mean relative abundance = 27.34%) appear particularly dominant in the majority of patients sampled. Amongst patients suffering from CRS with nasal polyps, a statistically significant reduction in relative abundance of Corynebacterium (40.29% vs 50.43%; p = 0.02) was identified. Despite some measured differences in microbiome composition and diversity between some of the participating centres in our cohort, these differences would not alter the general pattern of core organisms described. Nevertheless, atypical or unusual organisms reported in short-read amplicon sequencing studies and that are not part of the core microbiome should be interpreted with caution. The delineation of the sinonasal microbiome and standardised methodology described within our study will enable further characterisation and translational application of the sinus microbiota.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/all.14276\n\nView details for PubMedID 32167574\n\nAbstract\n\nExternal approaches to the frontal sinus such as osteoplastic flaps are challenging because they require blind entry into the sinus, posing risks of injury to the brain or orbit. Intraoperative computed tomography (CT)-based navigation is the current standard for planning the approach, but still necessitates blind entry into the sinus. The aim of this work was to describe a novel technique for external approaches to the frontal sinus using a holographic augmented reality (AR) application.Our team developed an AR system to create a 3-dimensional (3D) hologram of key anatomical structures, based on CT scans images. Using Magic Leap AR goggles for visualization, the frontal sinus hologram was aligned to the surface anatomy in 6 fresh cadaveric heads' anatomic boundaries, and the boundaries of the frontal sinus were demarcated based on the margins of the fused image. Trephinations and osteoplastic flap approaches were performed. The specimens were re-scanned to assess the accuracy of the osteotomy with respect to the actual frontal sinus perimeter.Registration and surgery were completed successfully in all specimens. Registration required an average of 2 minutes. The postprocedure CT showed a mean difference of 1.4 ± 4.1 mm between the contour of the osteotomy and the contour of the frontal sinus. One surgical complication (posterior table perforation) occurred (16%).We describe proof of concept of a novel technique utilizing AR to enhance external approaches to the frontal sinus. Holographic AR-enhanced surgical navigation holds promise for enhanced visualization of target structures during surgical approaches to the sinuses.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.22546\n\nView details for PubMedID 32362076\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Research surrounding outcome differences for patients with recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) is scarce. This investigation explored quality of life (QOL) and sinonasal attributes in patients during acute episodes (AEs) and in-between AEs of RARS.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective outcomes research.METHODS: Data from patients with RARS were collected from two academic institutions between 2009 and 2017 using prospective and retrospective methodology. During clinical presentation, subjects were classified as with or without an AEs using guideline definitions of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). Between-group differences in 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) survey and Lund-Kennedy (LK) endoscopy scores were assessed.RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-three clinical visits from 202 patients were included. Visits during an AE (168/423, 40%) were associated with significantly worse SNOT-22 total scores compared to between AEs (255/423, 60%; median = 53.0 [interquartile range (IQR) = 24.0] vs. 34.0 [IQR = 29.5]) and all SNOT-22 subdomain scores (all P <.001). LK scores were available for 167 visits, with 56 (34%) completed during an AE. Compared to visits without an AE, endoscopy findings associated with an AE were less frequently normal (LK score = 0, 45% vs. 62%, P =.031) with worse median LK scores (2.0 [IQR = 4.0] vs. 0.0 [IQR = 2.0], P =.005).CONCLUSIONS: AEs are associated with significantly worse QOL and mildly worse endoscopic findings. Almost half of visits during AEs had negative endoscopy, identifying a disparity between patient symptoms and objective findings and calling into question alternative or concomitant diagnoses. Diagnostic criteria for ABRS or AEs in RARS do not require objective confirmation of inflammation, presenting a conundrum for clinicians. The potential for overdiagnosis of ABRS and AEs should be considered when determining the risk/benefit ratio of treatments for RARS.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2c Laryngoscope, 2019.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lary.28460\n\nView details for PubMedID 31837149\n\nAbstract\n\nA 2-yr-old patient with a giant craniopharyngioma presented with seizures and panhypopituitarism. The lesion was initially approached at an outside institution with a transfrontal cyst fenestration, but progressive growth occurred later. Multiple management options were considered; we recommended an endoscopic endonasal approach with the goal of maximal safe resection. Virtual reality simulation and 3-dimensional printing were employed to evaluate whether the absence of pneumatization of the sinuses and the overall size of the nasal cavity could preclude effective surgical access. Our lab results suggested the binostril approach was feasible. A wide surgical exposure was performed from planum sphenoidale to clivus and from orbit to orbit. After removing the large calcified tumor portion, we found an accurate plane of dissection between tumor capsule, hypothalami, and visual pathways. By the end of resection, arterial bleeding was encountered secondary to an avulsion of the posterior communicating artery from the posterior cerebral artery. An angled aneurysm clip was placed with a single-shaft applier to secure the site of injury without narrowing the parent artery. Immediate and delayed magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography studies showed gross total resection, no stroke, and no pseudoaneurysm formation. On postoperative day 9, patient developed neurological decline and pneumocephalus secondary to necrotic nasoseptal flap. Two endonasal repairs with a lateral nasal wall flap were attempted with no success. A temporoparietal fascia flap was then harvested and transposed from the temporal to the pterygopalatine fossa to successfully repair the skull base defect. The patient has made an extraordinary recovery with no neurological sequalae. The patient's parents provided consent for the procedure and use of intraoperative photos and videos for academic purposes. Institutional Review Board approval was not required.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/ons/opz384\n\nView details for PubMedID 31814025\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to analyze the current rhinology workforce in the United States in terms of demographics, fellowship training, and regional distribution.METHODS: The American Rhinologic Society (ARS) member database was queried for workplace zip code, age, gender, and fellowship training of practicing U.S. rhinologists through 2017. The San Francisco Match data were examined for rhinology fellowships from 2006 through 2017. Each rhinologist was assigned to a specific hospital referral region (HRR) determined by the Dartmouth Healthcare Atlas to assess geographic distribution and market density.RESULTS: There were 296 ARS members self-identifying as rhinologists. Of those, 69.2% were fellowship-trained (FTR). The median age of FTRs and non-FTRs were 41 and 54 years, respectively (P <0.001). Eighty percent of FTRs were male compared to 85.7% non-FTRs. Given the recent growth of rhinology fellowships, the number of FTRs is currently expanding at approximately 16% per year. HRRs with the most rhinologists were Los Angeles, Boston, and Manhattan, all with 14. Approximately 100 million people live in HRRs without a practicing rhinologist. A wide variation in rhinologist density was observed, ranging from 133,047 to 3,636,809 people per rhinologist, with a median of 747,864.CONCLUSION: There may be a need for rhinologists in select parts of the country. Whereas the ARS database is likely an underestimation of the growing workforce, under current training rates we could pass the ideal number of U.S. rhinologists within 5 years.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA Laryngoscope, 2019.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lary.28157\n\nView details for PubMedID 31246279\n\nAbstract\n\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of cryoablation of the posterior nasal nerve (PNN) for treatment of chronic rhinitis.This was a prospective single-arm trial of 98 adult patients at six U.S. centers with chronic allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. PNN cryoablation was performed in-office under local anesthesia using a handheld device. Patients discontinued use of intranasal ipratropium 3 days prior to treatment and throughout the study period. Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) was measured at pretreatment baseline and posttreatment at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. The Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) was completed at pretreatment and 3 months posttreatment. Adverse effects and postprocedure medication usage were recorded.Ninety-eight procedures (100%) were successfully completed. rTNSS significantly improved over pretreatment baseline (6.1 ± 1.9) at 1 month (2.9 ± 1.9, P < 0.001), 3 months (3.0 ± 2.3, P < 0.001), 6 months (3.0 ± 2.1, P < 0.001), and 9 months (3.0 ± 2.4, P < 0.001) postprocedure. Nasal congestion and rhinorrhea subscores improved significantly at all time points (P < 0.001). Both allergic and nonallergic rhinitis subcohorts showed improvement (P < 0.001), with a comparable degree of improvement between groups. RQLQ significantly improved over pretreatment baseline (3.0 ± 1.0) at 3 months (1.5 ± 1.0, P < 0.001), and all RQLQ subdomains demonstrated improvement. Of 54 patients using intranasal medication at baseline, 19 (35.2%) were able to discontinue use.

Patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine on 1 side of the nasal cavity vs plain saline on the other side in preparation for ESS. Both groups received topical application of 1:1000 epinephrine. Surgical videos were recorded and Wormald surgical field grading scale was assigned by 2 blinded reviewers. The number of extra 1:1000 epinephrine pledgets used during the surgery, estimated blood loss, and surgical duration were also recorded.There were no statistically significant differences in Wormald surgical field grading scale, number of extra pledgets used, or estimated blood loss between the nasal cavity side infiltrated with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in comparison to infiltration with saline. The side infiltrated with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine had a reduced operative time compared to the side infiltrated with saline (p = 0.002). There were no differences in postoperative bleeding from questionnaire completed by patient at the first postoperative visit.Addition of infiltration of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 to topical application of epinephrine 1:1000 for preparation of ESS does not significantly improve surgical field of view compared to topical epinephrine alone.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.22468\n\nView details for PubMedID 31671251\n\nAbstract\n\nWe recently introduced a patient-specific rhinologic virtual surgical environment (VSE) that has shown potential for surgical rehearsal of various skull base lesions. Our aim in this study was to validate the usefulness of the rhinology VSE in performing the Draf 3 procedure.An outside-in Draf 3 procedure was performed on 4 cadaver heads. Computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained before and after cadaver dissection (CD). Pre-dissection CT scans were used to construct a cadaver-specific VSE. A virtual Draf 3 dissection (VD) was performed using the same technique. Validation was conducted by comparing the final common frontal outflow tract. A subjective comparison of the post-dissection endoscopic findings (CD vs VD) and an objective measurement using the post-dissection CT scan for the CD and the reconstructed CT scan obtained from the data after the VD was performed.Subjective overall resemblance of the 2 dissections (CD vs VD) assessed by the 4-point Likert scale (0-3) was 2.5 (median interquartile range [IQR], 0.25) for the 4 cadavers. The median difference for the anteroposterior dimension of the frontal neo-ostium (CD vs VD) assessed in the midsagittal view was 0.11 mm, whereas the median difference for the lateral dimension assessed in the coronal view was 2.71 mm. Thus, no statistical difference was observed.VD showed nearly matching results with the actual cadaver dissection. With further validation, our rhinologic VSE may be used for presurgical planning and rehearsal before the actual Draf 3 procedure is performed in the operating room.\n\nView details for PubMedID 31012526\n\nAbstract\n\nThe impact on quality of life (QoL) of bilateral inferior turbinate reduction (BITR) performed in the setting of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been a point of controversy. The aim of this study was to determine whether addition of BITR to ESS is associated with improved QoL when compared with ESS alone.This study presented findings a multi-institutional, retrospective analysis of a prospective open cohort of patients electing ESS for failed medical management of CRS. QoL parameters were compared between patients who underwent ESS alone vs those who underwent ESS with BITR.A total of 571 patients with CRS who elected to undergo ESS were identified. Sixty-one of these patients also underwent concurrent BITR, whereas 510 patients underwent ESS without BITR. Mean length of follow-up was 15.1 months. Comparison between baseline and last postoperative QoL, olfaction, and endoscopic scores revealed significant improvement in both groups. Overall, BITR surgery was not significantly associated with clinically significant incremental improvement in QoL in either the polyp or non-polyp group. Nevertheless, statistically significant improvement was noted for the nasal congestion/blockage symptom in polyp patients (p = 0.006) and in primary surgery patients (p = 0.027) who underwent BITR.BITR in the setting of ESS for CRS is not associated with significant incremental improvement in overall QoL vs ESS alone. However, BITR in polyp and primary surgery patients undergoing ESS appears to offer a significant incremental improvement in nasal congestion/blockage symptoms compared with ESS alone. Future studies are warranted to better corroborate these findings.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.22356\n\nView details for PubMedID 31220413\n\nAbstract\n\nTransnasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches constitute an essential technique for the resection of skull base tumors in adults. However, in the pediatric population, sellar and suprasellar lesions have historically been treated by craniotomy. Transnasal endoscopic approaches are less invasive and thus may be preferable to craniotomy, especially in children. In this case series, the authors present their institutional experience with transnasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches for pediatric skull base tumors.The authors retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients (age ≤ 18 years) who had undergone transnasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches for either biopsy or resection of sellar or suprasellar lesions between 2007 and 2016. All operations were performed jointly by a team of pediatric neurosurgeons and skull base otolaryngologists, except for 8 cases performed by one neurosurgeon.The series included 42 patients between 4 and 18 years old (average 12.5 years) who underwent 51 operations. Headache (45%), visual symptoms (69%), and symptoms related to hormonal abnormalities (71%) were the predominant presenting symptoms. Improvement in preoperative symptoms was seen in 92% of cases. Most patients had craniopharyngiomas (n = 16), followed by pituitary adenomas (n = 12), Rathke cleft cysts (n = 4), germinomas (n = 4), chordomas (n = 2), and other lesion subtypes (n = 4). Lesions ranged from 0.3 to 6.2 cm (median 2.5 cm) in their greatest dimension. Gross-total resection was primarily performed (63% of cases), with 5 subsequent recurrences. Nasoseptal flaps were used in 47% of cases, fat grafts in 37%, and lumbar drains in 47%. CSF space was entered intraoperatively in 15 cases, and postoperative CSF was observed only in lesions with suprasellar extension. There were 8 cases of new hormonal deficits and 3 cases of new cranial nerve deficits. Length of hospital stay ranged from 1 to 61 days (median 5 days). Patients were clinically followed up for a median of 46 months (range 1-120 months), accompanied by a median radiological follow-up period of 45 months (range 3.8-120 months). Most patients (76%) were offered adjuvant therapy.In this single-institution report of the transnasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approach, the authors demonstrated that this technique is generally safe and effective for different types of pediatric skull base lesions. Favorable effects of surgery were sustained during a follow-up period of 4 years. Further refinement in technology will allow for more widespread use in the pediatric population.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3171/2019.4.PEDS18693\n\nView details for PubMedID 31200365\n\nAbstract\n\nAcute invasive fungal sinusitis (AIFS) is a rare, aggressive infection occurring in immunocompromised patients. In this study we examined factors that affect survival in AIFS, and whether immune-stimulating therapies (IST) improve survival.Pathology records of biopsy-proven AIFS were reviewed from 3 academic institutions from 1995 to 2016. Univariate and multivariate Cox regressions were performed at 1 and 3 months from diagnosis.One hundred fourteen patients were included; 45 received IST. In the univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with worse survival: hematologic malignancy (3-month hazard ratio [HR], 3.7; p = 0.01); recent chemotherapy (within 1 month of AIFS diagnosis) (3-month HR, 2.3; p = 0.02); recent bone marrow transplant (BMT) (3-month HR, 2.5; p = 0.02); and infection with atypical fungi (1-month HR, 3.1; p = 0.04). The following were associated with improved survival in univariate analysis: increasing A1c% (1-month HR, 0.7; p = 0.01) and surgical debridement (1-month HR, 0.1; p = 0.001). One third of patients with a hematologic malignancy had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1000 at the time of diagnosis. ANC was not associated with prognosis in these patients. The following were associated with worse survival in multivariate analyses: hematologic malignancy; recent chemotherapy; atypical organisms; and cavernous sinus extension. In multivariate analyses, IST was associated with a 70% reduction in mortality at 1 month (p = 0.02).We presented the largest series of AIFS. Further studies are needed to examine the importance of ANC in diagnosis and prognosis. Patients diagnosed with atypical organisms may be at higher risk of death. IST likely improves short-term survival, but prospective studies are needed.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29979836\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground The concept of unified airway disease has linked bronchiectasis with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), much in the same way as in asthma and CRS. Although the outcomes of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) on comorbid asthma have been relatively well studied, the outcomes of ESS on comorbid bronchiectasis have rarely been examined. Objective We sought to determine sinonasal and pulmonary clinical outcomes of ESS in bronchiectasis patients with CRS. Method We reviewed all bronchiectasis patients who had ESS for CRS at our institution from 2006 to present. The sinonasal outcome test 22 (SNOT-22) was administered preoperatively and at 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years postoperatively. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were measured preoperatively and at 6 months and 1 year post operation to assess the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced viral capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC values. Paired t test and Pearson correlation were used to compare pre- and postsurgical results. Results A total of 141 bronchiectasis patients who had ESS for CRS were studied. The most common cause of bronchiectasis was cystic fibrosis (CF) (42.55%). SNOT-22 scores improved at 3 months post operation and were maintained at 1 year and 3 years post operation ( P < .001). All SNOT sub-domains showed a significant improvement after surgery ( P < .01). However, PFTs did not change at 6 months post operation and 1 year post operation ( P > .05). There were significant differences in the outcomes in CF versus non-CF patients ( P < .05) but not by sex or age. Conclusion ESS is effective in improving long-term sinonasal outcomes in bronchiectasis patients with CRS. However, ESS does not appear to improve the pulmonary function.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30112923\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: In uncomplicated chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a consensus regarding appropriate medical therapy (AMT) before surgical intervention has been published in the form of \"appropriateness criteria\" for endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). We sought to determine why tertiary surgeons may deviate from the suggested criteria and evaluated whether those deviations result in change in outcomes.METHODS: Patients with uncomplicated CRS were prospectively enrolled over the course of 1 year. The 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22), a general health outcome out of 100, and a physician form, indicating management pathway and decision making, was completed at each visit over a 6-month follow-up period. A descriptive analysis was used to quantify reasons for veering from the \"appropriateness criteria,\" and repeated linear regression modeling was used to measure whether compliance impacted SNOT-22, general health, and Lund-Kennedy (LK) scores over the period of study.RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients were enrolled. Sixty-eight percent followed the appropriate management pathway based on their presentation and the suggested criteria. Disparate reasons were documented for deviation in the other 32%, and, despite establishing several predictive categories, \"other\" was the most common reason, with various explanations well documented. SNOT-22, general health, and LK scores were not statistically impacted by compliancy status (p > 0.05).CONCLUSION: The suggested \"appropriateness criteria\" predict a management pathway for the majority of CRS patients. However, in a tertiary sinus center, surgeons may deviate from that model with a significant minority of their patients, for multiple reasons, without causing a change in outcomes.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29999595\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Since first described in the 1990s, the endoscopic modified Lothrop procedure (EMLP) has been the subject of a growing body of literature. We performed a review to compare indications and outcomes of EMLP in an early cohort of publications (1990-2008) versus a contemporary cohort (2009-2016) and compare outcomes associated with follow-up ≥2 years versus <2 years.DATA SOURCES: PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases.REVIEW METHODS: An English-language search of the PubMed and Ovid databases was conducted to identify publications from 1990 to 2016 reporting clinical outcomes of EMLP. Meta-analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis System 9.4.RESULTS: A total of 1,205 patients were abstracted from 29 articles with a mean follow-up of 29.1 ± 10.3 months. The overall rate of significant or complete symptom improvement was 86.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 84.2%-88.7%). The overall patency rate was 90.7% (95% CI: 89.1%-92.3%), with a revision rate of 12.6% (95% CI: 10.6%-14.3%). Compared to the early cohort, patients in the contemporary cohort underwent EMLP more often for tumors (P < .001), had higher rates of complete or significant symptom improvement (90.0% vs. 82.6 %, P < .001); and trended toward greater patency rates (92.1% vs. 88.6%, P = .052). Compared to the short-term follow-up cohort, the long-term cohort showed no differences in symptom improvement or patency, but the revision rate was higher (14.5% vs. 9.2%, P = .016).CONCLUSIONS: In the last decade, EMLP has been performed more frequently for tumors. Recent studies have demonstrated improved symptom outcomes and a trend toward improved patency rates. The revision rate increased significantly when follow-up exceeded 2 years.

Critical evaluation and understanding of this literature is important to appropriately utilize this knowledge in the care of AR patients. The International Consensus statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Allergic Rhinitis (ICAR:AR) has been produced as a multidisciplinary international effort. This Executive Summary highlights and summarizes the findings of the comprehensive ICAR:AR document.The ICAR:AR document was produced using previously described methodology. Specific topics were developed relating to AR. Each topic was assigned a literature review, evidence-based review (EBR), or evidence-based review with recommendations (EBRR) format as dictated by available evidence and purpose within the ICAR:AR document. Following iterative reviews of each topic, the ICAR:AR document was synthesized and reviewed by all authors for consensus.Over 100 individual topics related to AR diagnosis, pathophysiology, epidemiology, disease burden, risk factors, allergy testing modalities, treatment, and other conditions/comorbidities associated with AR were addressed in the comprehensive ICAR:AR document. Herein, the Executive Summary provides a synopsis of these findings.In the ICAR:AR critical review of the literature, several strengths were identified. In addition, significant knowledge gaps exist in the AR literature where current practice is not based on the best quality evidence; these should be seen as opportunities for additional research. The ICAR:AR document evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the AR literature. This Executive Summary condenses these findings into a short summary. The reader is also encouraged to consult the comprehensive ICAR:AR document for a thorough description of this work.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.22070\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000424909200002\n\nView details for PubMedID 29438600\n\nAbstract\n\nEndoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is often recommended for symptomatic patients with recurrent acute or chronic rhinosinusitis who have failed conservative treatment. Postoperative care has been felt to be critical for both maintaining the surgical patency of the operated sinuses and improving patient symptoms. Debridement of the sinonasal cavities is one such postoperative care measure that has frequently been studied in the literature, often with conflicting conclusions.To assess the effects of postoperative sinonasal debridement versus no debridement following endoscopic sinus surgery.The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); PubMed; EMBASE; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 21 May 2018.Randomised controlled trials comparing postoperative nasal debridement versus no debridement in adult patients with recurrent acute or chronic rhinosinusitis undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. We included studies in which the patients acted as self-controls (i.e. one side of the nose underwent debridement and the other side did not) only for the secondary endoscopy outcomes.We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome measures were: health-related quality of life, disease severity (patient-reported symptom scores) and significant adverse effects (bleeding requiring intervention, severe pain, iatrogenic injury). Secondary outcomes were: postoperative endoscopic appearance of the sinonasal surgical cavities (endoscopic scores), recorded use of postoperative medical treatment and rate of revision surgery. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.We included four studies (152 participants), with a follow-up duration ranging from three months to 12 months. In two studies patients acted as self-controls, i.e. one side of the nose underwent debridement and the other side did not ('split-nose' studies). The risk of bias in all studies was high, mostly due to the inability to blind the patients to the debridement procedure.Primary outcomesDisease-specific health-related quality of life scoresOnly one study (58 participants) provided data for disease-specific health-related quality of life. At six months follow-up, lower disease-specific health-related quality of life scores, measured using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22, range 0 to 110), were noted in the debridement group but the difference was not statistically significant (9.7 in the debridement group versus 10.3 in the control group, P = 0.47) (low-quality evidence).Disease severity (patient-reported symptom score)Only one study (60 participants) provided data for disease severity measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) score. No significant differences in total symptom score were observed between groups postoperatively (low-quality evidence).Significant adverse effectsSignificant adverse effects related to the debridement procedure were not reported in any of the included studies, however it is not clear whether data regarding adverse effects were not collected or if none were indeed observed in any of the included studies.Secondary outcomesAll four studies assessed thepostoperative endoscopic appearance of the sinonasal cavities using the Lund-Kennedy score (range 0 to 10). A pooled analysis of endoscopic scores in the two non 'split-nose' studies revealed better endoscopic scores in the debridement group, however this was not a statistically significant difference (mean difference -0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.35 to 0.72; I² = 0%; two studies; 118 participants) (low-quality evidence). A sub-analysis of the adhesion formation component of the endoscopic score was available for all four studies and revealed a significantly lower adhesion rate in the debridement group (risk ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.68; I² = 29%; four studies; 152 participants). Analysis of the number needed to treat to benefit revealed that for every three patients undergoing debridement, the endoscopic score would be decreased by one point in one patient. For every five patients undergoing debridement adhesion formation would be prevented in one patient.Use of postoperative medical treatment was reported in all studies, all of which recommended nasal douching. Steroids (systemic or nasal) were administered in two studies. However, the data were very limited and heterogeneous, therefore we could not analyse the impact of concomitant postoperative medical treatment.The rate of revision surgery was not reported in any of the included studies, however it is not clear whether these data were not recorded or if there were no revision surgeries in any of the included studies.We are uncertain about the effects of postoperative sinonasal debridement due to high risk of bias in the included studies and the low quality of the evidence. Sinonasal debridement may make little or no difference to disease-specific health-related quality of life or disease severity. Low-quality evidence suggests that postoperative debridement is associated with a significantly lower risk of adhesions at three months follow-up. Whether this has any impact on longer-term outcomes is unknown.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD011988.pub2\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000455159600021\n\nView details for PubMedID 30407624\n\nAbstract\n\nIgD is an enigmatic antibody isotype best known when coexpressed with IgM on naive B cells. However, increased soluble IgD (sIgD) levels and increased IgD+IgM- B-cell populations have been described in the human upper respiratory mucosa.We assessed whether levels of sIgD and IgD+ B cell counts are altered in nasal tissue from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We further characterized IgD+ B-cell populations and explored clinical and local inflammatory factors associated with tissue sIgD levels.sIgD levels were measured by means of ELISA in nasal tissues, nasal lavage fluid, sera, and supernatants of dissociated nasal tissues. IgD+ cells were identified by using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Inflammatory mediator levels in tissues were assessed by using real-time PCR and multiplex immunoassays. Bacterial cultures from the middle meatus were performed. Underlying medical history and medicine use were obtained from medical records.sIgD levels and numbers of IgD+ cells were significantly increased in uncinate tissue (UT) of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) compared with that of control subjects (4-fold, P < .05). IgD+ cells were densely scattered in the periglandular regions of UT from patients with CRSsNP. We also found that IgD+CD19+CD38bright plasmablast numbers were significantly increased in tissues from patients with CRSsNP compared with control tissues (P < .05). Among numerous factors tested, IL-2 levels were increased in UT from patients with CRSsNP and were positively correlated with tissue IgD levels. Additionally, supernatants of IL-2-stimulated dissociated tissue from patients with CRSsNP had significantly increased sIgD levels compared with those in IL-2-stimulated dissociated control tissue ex vivo (P < .05). Tissue from patients with CRS with preoperative antibiotic use or those with pathogenic bacteria showed higher IgD levels compared with tissue from patients without these variables (P < .05).sIgD levels and IgD+CD19+CD38bright plasmablast counts were increased in nasal tissue of patients with CRSsNP. IgD levels were associated with increased IL-2 levels and the presence of pathogenic bacteria. These findings suggest that IgD might contribute to enhancement mucosal immunity or inflammation or respond to bacterial infections in patients with CRS, especially CRSsNP.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28625807\n\nAbstract\n\nA novel, bioabsorbable, fibrinogen-based implant has been developed as a mucosal dressing after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). This implant can be formulated with fluticasone propionate (FP) for local elution of corticosteroid to reduce postoperative inflammation and promote mucosal healing.This study investigated the biocompatibility and pharmacokinetics of the implant in a rabbit model.Implants with and without FP were placed on both intact and demucosalized maxillary sinuses of 33 New Zealand White rabbits. Sinuses with either intact or denuded bone without implants acted as controls. Histopathologic assessments were carried out at 5, 15, and 28 days. Concentrations of FP in the maxillary sinus mucosa, nasal cavity mucosa, and plasma were measured for up to 44 days.Implants placed on intact mucosa or denuded bone were grossly integrated within 15 days. Minimal foreign body reaction was seen with negligible differences for inflammation, fibrosis, or bone remodeling among controls, sinuses with the implant, or sinuses with the implant plus FP, at all time points. All samples also showed complete or near-complete percentage reepithelialization at 28 days, although the denuded bone controls demonstrated greater percentage reepithelialization at 5 days compared with denuded bone with the implant or implant plus FP (p < 0.0001). The maxillary sinus mucosa demonstrated levels of FP of >140 ng/g up to 44 days. Plasma concentrations of FP were generally very low and were undetectable after day 7.The implant and the implant plus FP seemed to be biocompatible in rabbits. The implant plus FP effectively eluted steroid locally over at least 44 days, with negligible plasma concentrations. Further studies are warranted regarding potential therapeutic applications in patients undergoing ESS for chronic rhinosinusitis.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29122083\n\nAbstract\n\nEndoscopic posterior nasal nerve (PNN) resection has been described as an efficacious surgical treatment of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, but the requirement for surgery under general anesthesia has limited its acceptance. We report the first series of patients treated for chronic rhinitis using a novel device designed for office-based cryosurgical ablation of the PNN.Twenty-seven patients with chronic rhinorrhea and/or nasal congestion for >3 months were recruited (allergic or nonallergic rhinitis), with minimum rhinorrhea and/or congestion subscores of 2 as part of the Total Nasal Symptom Score [TNSS]). Under local anesthesia, the cryotherapy device was applied endoscopically to the posterior middle meatus and was used to freeze the PNN region bilaterally. Patients were followed up after 7, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days to assess TNSS.The procedure was successfully completed in 100% of patients, with no complications; 74% reported no or mild discomfort by the first postprocedure day. TNSS was reduced significantly at 30 days (mean ± standard deviation: 6.2 ± 0.5 at baseline, 2.6 ± 0.3 at 30 days, n = 27, p < 0.001), with continued reduction at 90 (2.7 ± 0.4, n = 24, p < 0.001), 180 (2.3 ± 0.5, n = 21, p < 0.001), and 365 days (1.9 ± 0.3, n = 15, p < 0.001). Both rhinorrhea and congestion subscores decreased significantly at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Allergic and nonallergic subcohorts both appeared to benefit from treatment.Office-based cryotherapy of the PNN region is safe and well tolerated. Symptom scores were significantly decreased by 7 days postprocedure and remained lower at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28799727\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective A radioanatomic study of surgically relevant variations in the greater palatine canal (GPC) on computed tomography (CT) was performed to determine susceptibility during endoscopic endonasal procedures. Study Design Blinded radioanatomic analysis. Setting Tertiary university hospital. Subjects and Methods Fifty consecutive paranasal CT scans (100 sides) were analyzed. Measurements were standardized to landmarks such as the inferior turbinate (IT) and floor of the nasal cavity (FNC) to assess variability and vulnerability of the nerve. Measurements included (1) incidence of maxillary sinus pneumatization posterior to the GPC, (2) distance from the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus to the GPC at the IT and FNC, (3) width of bone containing the GPC, (4) incidence of medial GPC dehiscence, and (5) angle of the GPC extending from the IT to FNC. Results Ninety-one percent of maxillary sinuses were pneumatized posterior to the GPC. The distance from the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus to the GPC was 2.8 ± 1.7 mm (range, -2.3 to 5.9) at the posterior attachment of the IT and 4.1 ± 3.1 mm (range, -6.3 to 11.9) at the FNC. The width of bone containing the GPC was 3.3 ± 1.3 mm (range, 1-8.9), and the medial bony GPC was dehiscent in 38% of cases. In the sagittal plane, the angle of the GPC between the IT and the FNC was 31.9 ± 6.9 degrees (range, 10.8-45). Conclusion The GPC has considerable anatomic variability relative to important surgical landmarks in endoscopic procedures. Preoperative review of CTs to assess vulnerability may prevent postoperative complications.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28608764\n\nAbstract\n\nThe indications for surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are poorly defined. In this study we compare outcomes of medical versus surgical treatment and examine trends associated with the transition from medical to surgical therapy in CF patients.One hundred thirty-six patients with CF referred to a tertiary rhinology practice were retrospectively divided into 3 cohorts: Medical, Upfront Surgery, or Crossover, if they converted from medical to surgical management. The 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were assessed up to 48 months.Compared to patients initially managed medically (n = 90), those who pursued upfront surgery (n = 46) had a greater incidence of nasal polyposis (p = 0.0011), prior sinus surgery (p = 0.0025), lower percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV1 ) (p = 0.0063), and higher Lund-Mackay (p = 0.0025) and SNOT-22 (p = 0.0229) scores. Within the medical group, 35.5% converted to surgery after a mean of 14.3 months. Crossover (n = 32) was associated with a 6.1-point increase in SNOT-22 and a 4.5% deterioration in %FEV1 . Despite worsened symptom severity, the Crossover cohort ultimately achieved similar postoperative SNOT-22 scores (p = 0.831) and %FEV1 (p = 0.114) as those who underwent upfront surgery. Although the Medical cohort had the lowest baseline SNOT-22 scores (p < 0.001), surgery at any time normalized scores to the same baseline level (p = 0.652). Neither medical therapy nor surgery improved PFTs.Surgery effectively reduces CRS-related symptoms in CF patients but may not improve pulmonary function. In patients who first pursue medical therapy, symptomatic decline may prompt eventual conversion to surgery. Patients who delay surgery may achieve similar outcomes as those who pursue surgery upfront.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.21912\n\nView details for PubMedID 28218486\n\nAbstract\n\nDirect comparisons of microscopic and endoscopic resection of sellar lesions are scarce, with conflicting reports of cost and clinical outcome advantages.To determine if the proposed benefits of endoscopic resection are realized on a population level.We performed a matched cohort study of 9,670 adult patients in the MarketScan database who underwent either endoscopic or microscopic surgery for sellar lesions. Coarsened matching was applied to estimate the effects of surgical approach on complication rates, length of stay (LOS), costs, and likelihood of postoperative radiation.We found that LOS, readmission, and revision rates did not differ significantly between approaches. The overall complication rate was higher for endoscopy (47% compared to 39%, OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.53). Endoscopic approach was associated with greater risk of neurological complications (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11-1.55), diabetes insipidus (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.37-2.00), and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.07-3.13) compared to the microscopic approach. Although the total index payment was higher for patients receiving endoscopic resection ($32,959 compared to $29,977 for microscopic resection), there was no difference in long-term payments. Endoscopic surgery was associated with decreased likelihood of receiving post-resection stereotactic radiosurgery (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.90) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.93).Our results suggest that the transition from a microscopic to endoscopic approach to sellar lesions must be subject to careful evaluation. Although there are evident advantages to transsphenoidal endoscopy, our analysis suggests that the benefits of the endoscopic approach are yet to be materialized.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28691009\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients frequently are advised to abstain from nose blowing following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), despite a lack of evidence supporting this recommendation. This randomized study assessed whether nose blowing in the first postoperative week affects subjective and objective clinical outcomes.Forty patients undergoing ESS were randomized into an interventional arm in which patients blew their nose at least twice daily for the first 7 postoperative days, or a control arm in which patients refrained from nose blowing. All patients were allowed to blow their nose after 7 days. The frequency and degree of epistaxis was documented by daily diary and visual analog scale (VAS). At 1 and 4 weeks postoperatively, Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) were collected, and endoscopies were recorded for blinded Lund-Kennedy scale scoring.There were no differences between the two groups in terms of frequency and duration of bleeding events, VAS epistaxis scores, SNOT-22 scores, and NOSE scores at every postoperative timepoint. Lund-Kennedy scores also were similar at the 1-week (P = 0.0762) and 4-week (P = 0.2340) postoperative visits, but the nose-blowing group had improved nasal discharge subscores at the first (P = 0.0075) and second (P = 0.0298) postoperative visits.Nose blowing after ESS does not appear to measurably improve symptoms of nasal congestion or general sinonasal quality of life, nor does it seem to adversely affect the frequency or severity of postoperative epistaxis during the first postoperative week. Judicious nose blowing may be permissible immediately after uncomplicated ESS.1b.

The secretion rates of the nasal submucosal glands of the three groups in response to carbachol and forskolin were measured by using time lapse digital imaging of mucus bubbles from single glands as they formed on the mucosal surface under oil.Carbachol-stimulated secretion rates were the following: controls, 1670 ± 381 pl·min(-1)·gland(-1); CRS, 965 ± 440 pl·min(-1)·gland(-1); and CF, 933 ± 588 pl·min(-1)·gland(-1) (p = 0.23, Kruskal-Wallis test). Forskolin-stimulated secretion rates were the following: controls, 229 ± 14 pl·min(-1)·gland(-1); CRS, 154 ± 48 pl·min(-1)·gland(-1); and CF, 22 ± 15 pl·min(-1)·gland(-1) (p = 0.008, Kruskal-Wallis test). The ratio of the average secretion rate induced by forskolin to that induced by carbachol was 13.7% in the controls, and 15.9% in CRS and 2.3% in CF groups.The only significant difference in this small study was decreased forskolin-stimulated secretion in subjects with CF relative to the other subjects. However, there was a trend toward reduced carbachol-stimulated secretion rates in subjects with CRS and with and without CF relative to controls. Additional studies are needed to determine if nasal submucosal gland hyposecretion occurs in CRS either as a contributor to or as a consequence of CRS pathogenesis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2500/ajra.2015.29.4213\n\nView details for PubMedID 26358343\n\nAbstract\n\nA majority of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and/or nasal polyps, both of which may be secondary to reduced fluid secretion from nasal submucosal glands.To determine whether decreased fluid secretion from nasal submucosal glands also occurs in patients without CF and with CRS.Inferior turbinates of the nasal cavity were harvested from controls, subjects with CRS, and subjects with CF (n = 5-7 per group).

We studied outcomes of medical vs surgical treatment of RARS, anatomic variants associated with RARS, and factors predicting crossover from medical to surgical treatment.A total of 220 RARS patients treated between 2006 and 2014 were retrospectively divided into 3 cohorts: medical only (MED); surgical only (SURG); or medical crossing over into surgical (CROSS). Twenty-two item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores, modified Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores, and prevalence of anatomic variants by computed tomography (CT) were compared. A total of 220 CT scans obtained for non-sinus indications served as controls. A logistic regression model was used for analysis.The mean baseline SNOT-22 scores for all cohorts were similar (MED = 48, SURG = 49, CROSS = 45, p < 0.0001). The SURG cohort showed greater reduction of SNOT-22 scores compared to the MED cohort at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up (p < 0.0001). The crossover cohort converted to surgery after escalation of SNOT-22 score by a mean of 15 points (p < 0.03), and showed significant reduction postoperatively (p < 0.0001). Haller cell (odds ratio [OR] 3.9; p < 0.0001), concha bullosa (OR 3.7; p < 0.003), and accessory ostium (OR 2.2; p < 0.01) were more common in the entire RARS group vs controls; however, there were no inter-cohort differences in prevalence.RARS patients can benefit from both medical and surgical treatment strategies, but surgica"
