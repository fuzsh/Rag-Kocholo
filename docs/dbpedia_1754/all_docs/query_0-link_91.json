        "text": "Cases\n\nBailey v. Flood\n\n[2000] IESC 11\n\nJudgment of the Court delivered by The Hon. Mrs. Justice Denham on the 14th day of April, 2000\n\n[*2] This is an appeal by Thomas Bailey, Caroline Bailey and Bovale Developments Limited, the applicants/appellants, hereinafter referred to as the applicants. The applicants are appealing against the judgment of the High Court, Morris P., delivered the 6th March, 2000, in proceedings in which the applicants claim relief by way of judicial review of a decision of the respondent.\n\n1. The applicants sought judicial review of the ruling made on 8th February, 2000 of the Sole Member of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, hereinafter referred to as the respondent.\n\n2. The said ruling concluded:\n\n“I believe in the light of my knowledge of the issues and the events which have occurred to date that it is appropriate that the witnesses in question be called before the Tribunal to give evidence on oath of the matters which are relevant to the Tribunal’s inquiries. It has been urged upon me that in view of the private nature of the proposed inquiry touching as it does upon the expenditure of money and acquisition of assets by the parties that such inquiries should be conducted in private. The Tribunal of Inquiries Evidence Act specifically provides for the evidence to be heard in public unless it is expedient to the public interest that I sit in private. I do not believe that there are sufficient grounds open to me to conduct the intended examination of the witnesses in private in the public interest and accordingly I believe that the examination of the witnesses should proceed.”\n\n3. The factual background to this case is set out in the judgment of the learned President. There is no conflict between the parties on these facts.\n\n4. Counsel for the applicants, Mr. John Gordon, S.C., opened the appeal by referring to two basic grounds, namely,\n\n(a) That the relevance of the evidence to be given had not been established.\n\n(b) That the respondent was incorrect in concluding that he must hear the evidence in public rather than in private.\n\n[*3] That the applicants have a constitutional right to privacy is beyond debate. It is equally well established that this is not an absolute right but one which must in certain circumstances be weighed against or balanced with the exigencies of the common good. Again, the common good may require that matters, resolved by democratically elected representatives in the Houses of the Oireachtas to be of urgent public importance, be inquired into by the tribunal. It is of the essence of such tribunals that the inquiries be held in public. If this is not done public disquiet, which lead to the appointment of the tribunal, could not be allayed. These principles have been established and reviewed exhaustively in recent years (see Goodman International v. Mr. Justice Hamilton [1992] 2 I.R. 542, Redmond v.Mr. Justice Flood [1999] 1 I.L.R.M. 241; Lawlor v. Mr. Justice Flood (Unreported, Supreme Court, 8th October, 1999); Murphy v. Mr. Justice Flood (Unreported, High Court, Geoghegan J., 30th April, 1999). These principles were correctly analysed and applied by Mr. Justice Morris in the judgment under appeal. The concept that public interest includes the interest of the public in the right of privacy of a person or persons was addressed by the President. He stated at page 30 of the transcript of his judgment:\n\n“… I am prepared to accept, without deciding, that the protection of constitutional rights can constitute a public interest that might justify the exclusion of the public from the proceedings of a tribunal of inquiry.”\n\n5. The novel feature of the present case was the argument that the evidence of the applicants should be heard by the tribunal in private in the first instance and, if it was then established or emerged that the evidence so given was relevant or material, the hearing could be repeated in public. Assuming, without deciding, that such a procedure was permissible, a decision as to whether that course should be adopted was one which fell to be made by the [*4]\n\ntribunal itself. That decision must conform to the standard of reasonableness laid down by this court in The State (Keegan) v. Stardust Victims Compensation Tribunal [1986] I.R. 642 and O’Keefe v. An Bord Pleanala [1993] 1 I.R. 39. No doubt any determination of reasonableness would have regard to the subject matter and consequences of the decision as was so clearly illustrated by the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in R. v. Lord Saville [1999] 4 ALL ER 860. Those principles having been examined in full by the learned President, he stated at page 27 of the transcript of the judgment:\n\n“The legislature has entrusted a broad measure of discretion to such tribunals, including the discretion to decide how the inquiry will proceed and what evidence will be admitted, and it is no part of the duty of this Court to whittle down that discretion, with the inevitable deleterious effects that would have on the effective discharge of the important public tasks with which tribunals of inquiry are burdened.”\n\n6. The learned President stated and applied the law correctly and in so doing disposed of the issues which arise. The Court will therefore dismiss the appeal.\n\nKennedy v. Ireland\n\n[1987] IR 587\n\nHamilton P.\n\nH.C.\n\nThe facts in this case are not in dispute.\n\nAt all relevant times both the first and second plaintiffs were distinguished and well known political correspondents with Irish national newspapers with extensive circulation within the state. The third plaintiff was and is the spouse of the second plaintiff, a free-lance journalist and an active participant in the Women’s Political Association. In the course of their work and in their private capacities, each of the plaintiffs made extensive use of telephones from their respective homes. The first plaintiff’s private telephone number was 280006 and the second and third plaintiffs’ was 805575.\n\nIn para. 7 of the statement of claim delivered on behalf of the plaintiffs it was alleged that:”\n\n“On dates unknown between the 28th July, 1982, and the 16th November, 1982, in respect of the first-named plaintiff’s telephone number and between the 10th May, 1982, and the 12th July, 1982, in respect of the second-named plaintiff’s then telephone number, the said telephones were illegally tapped. The said telephone tapping was carried out by one or other or either of the servants or agents of the first defendant pleaded herein. Recordings and transcripts were illegally made by the said servants or agents of the State.”\n\nIn para. 4 of the defence delivered on behalf of the defendants, it is stated that:”\n\n“The defendants admit the facts set out in para. 7 of the statement of claim herein but deny that by reason of any of the said facts there was any illegality or any breach of any of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights either as alleged or at all.”\n\nThe plaintiffs had in their statement of claim alleged that the activities of which they complained and which were admitted on behalf of the State were not authorised by law, were in breach of contract and in breach of the constitution.\n\nIt appears from a statement made by the then Minister for Justice on the 20th January, 1983, and which was by consent of the parties to these proceedings admitted in evidence, that he confirmed that both telephones were in fact “tapped”, that the facts showed that the system of safeguards which successive Ministers for Justice had publicly declared in Dail Eireann to be an integral part of the system was either disregarded in the cases in question or, what amounts to the same thing, was operated in such a way as to be rendered meaningless and that the facts showed that there was no justification for the ‘tapping’ of either of the two telephones and that what occurred went beyond what could be explained as just an error of judgment.\n\nWarrants authorising the communication to Assistant Commissioner T.J. Ainsworth by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of particulars of all communications on the said telephone numbers were issued by the then Minister for Justice on the 14th May, 1982, in respect of telephone number 805575 and 30th July, 1982, in respect of telephone number 280006.\n\nIt is submitted on behalf of the defendants that the right to issue such warrants is recognised by the provisions of s. 56 of the Post Office Act, 1908.\n\nIt is conceded by the State that such warrants are issued only in very limited circumstances such as for security purposes or for the prevention and detection of serious crime. It is further conceded by the State, as appears from the statement of the then Minister for Justice made on the 20th January, 1983, already referred to, that there was no justification for the tapping of either of the two telephones in question in this case.\n\nIt is submitted by Mr. Fennelly on behalf of the defendants herein, the State and the Attorney General, that while the ‘tapping’ of the telephones was improper, it was not illegal and did not interfere with any constitutional rights of the plaintiffs or either of them.\n\nThis is a submission which I cannot accept.\n\nConstitutional Rights\n\nIn their statement of claim the plaintiffs, inter alia, claim:”\n\n(1) that their rights under Article 40, s. 3 of the Constitution include the personal right to privacy and to be free from unlawful and unwarranted intrusions into their private telephone conversations,\n\n(2) that the State has failed:”\n\n(a) to defend and vindicate their personal rights,\n\n(b) to respect the privacy of the plaintiffs in the exercise of their profession as political journalists and in the living of their private lives by not interfering with, listening to and tapping their telephone conversations,\n\n(c) to respect the guarantee to all citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions, including criticism of Government policy,\n\nand\n\n(3) that the State has:”\n\n(a) interfered without any lawful cause or justification into the private lives and liberties of the plaintiffs,\n\n(b) tapped the telephones of the plaintiffs and taken transcripts of conversations in a manner intended to interfere with the plaintiffs in the exercise of their guaranteed rights.\n\nThe personal right to privacy is not one of the rights actually acknowledged by Article 40 of the Constitution but as stated by Mr. Justice Kenny in Ryan v. The Attorney General [1965] I.R. 294 at p. 313:”\n\n“[T]here are many personal rights of the citizen which follow from the Christian and democratic nature of the State which are not mentioned in Article 40 at all.”\n\nThe personal right to privacy is one of such rights. In the course of his judgment in Norris v. The Attorney General [1984] I.R. 36 at pp. 100 and 101 of the report, Mr. Justice McCarthy stated:”\n\n“The Constitution does not guarantee or, in any way, expressly refer to a right of privacy ” no more, indeed than does the United States Constitution, with which our Constitution bears so many apparent similarities. In the United States Constitution the right to privacy in one form or another has been founded upon the First Amendment ( Stanley v. Georgia (1969) 394 U.S. 557); the Fourth and Fifth Amendments ( Terry v. Ohio (1968) 392 U.S. 1); in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights ( Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) 381 U.S. 479) ” the contraceptives case; in the Ninth Amendment ( Griswold v. Connecticut ); and in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment ( Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) 262 U.S. 390).\n\nIn our Constitution a right of privacy is not spelt out. As stated by Mr. Justice Henchy in his judgment, there is a guarantee of privacy in voting under Article 16, s. 1, sub-s. 4 ” the secret ballot; a limited right of privacy given to certain litigants under laws made under Article 34; the limited freedom from arrest and detention under Article 40, s. 4; the inviolability of the dwelling of every citizen under Article 40, s. 5; the rights of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions, to assemble peaceably and without arms, and to form associations and unions-all conferred by Article 40, s. 6, sub-s. 1; the rights of the family under Article 41; the rights of the family with regard to education under Article 42; the right of private property under Article 43; freedom of conscience and the free profession and practise of religion under Article 44. All these may properly be described as different facets of the right of privacy, but they are general in nature (as necessarily they must be in a Constitution) and do not set bounds to the enumeration of the details of such a right of privacy when the occasion arises. In our jurisdiction this is best exemplified in the McGee Case [1974] I.R. 284 where, whilst Mr. Justice Walsh rested his judgment upon the provisions of Article 41, Mr. Justice Budd, Mr. Justice Henchy and Mr. Justice Walsh relied upon the guarantees of Article 40, section 3. I would respectfully share the latter view of the true foundation for what the McGee Case upheld ” the right of privacy in marriage.\n\nWhilst the Constitution of the Irish Free State (SaorstÃ¡t Ã‰ireann ) 1922, did not, as it were, isolate the fundamental rights of citizens in a manner in which the present Constitution of 1937 has done, articles 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of that Constitution indicate the manner in which certain rights were spelt out but, to a degree, highlight the absence of such guarantees as are contained in Article 40, s. 3, and Article 41 of the Constitution. There may well be historical reasons for these differences ” a greater awareness of the need for the annunciation of fundamental rights was present during the 1930s than at the time of the negotiations for the Treaty that led to the enactment of the Constitution of the Irish Free State. At all events, since 1937, the concept of judicial dynamism in constitutional law has grown, thereby identifying more readily the role of the Courts, and in particular, this Court as the judicial organ of government, not merely by way of a supervisory jurisdiction on the actions of the legislative and executive branches of government but by way of legal interpretation ” thus playing its part in “seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of prudence, justice and charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured . . .” as most strikingly evidenced by the decision in the McGee Case .\n\nHow then, to identify the nature of the personal right of privacy? The right to privacy has been called by Brandeis J. of the\n\nUnited States Federal Supreme Court “the right to be let alone” ” a quotation cited by the Chief Justice in this case and by Mr. Justice Walsh in his dissenting judgment as a member of the Court of Human Rights in Dudgeon v. United Kingdom (1981) 4 E.H.R.R. 149. By way of definition it has brevity and clarity and I would respectfully adopt it as accurate and adequate for my purpose but, to a degree, the very definition begs the question. The right to privacy is not in issue, the issue is the extent of that right or the extent of the right to be let alone.”\n\nThough not specifically guaranteed by the Constitution, the right of privacy is one of the fundamental personal rights of the citizen which flow from the Christian and democratic nature of the State. It is not an unqualified right. Its exercise may be restricted by the constitutional rights of others, by the requirements of the common good and is subject to the requirements of public order and morality.\n\nThere are many aspects to the right to privacy, some of which have been dealt with in the cases referred to by Mr. Justice McCarthy in the passage which I have just quoted from his judgment in Norris’s Case [1984] I.R. 36 and the remaining aspects remain to be dealt with when suitable cases come before the courts for determination. The question to be determined in this case is whether the right to privacy includes the right to privacy in respect of telephonic conversations and the right to hold such conversations without deliberate, conscious and unjustified interference therewith and intrusion thereon by servants of the State, who listen to such conversation, record them, transcribe them and make the transcriptions thereof available to other persons.\n\nI have no doubt but that it does.\n\nAs stated by Mr. Justice Henchy in his judgment in Norris v. The Attorney General [1984] I.R. 36 at p. 71:”\n\n“Having regard to the purposive Christian ethos of the Constitution, particularly as set out in the preamble (“to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored, and concord established with other nations”), to the denomination of the State as “sovereign, independent, democratic” in Article 5, and to the recognition, expressly or by necessary implication, of particular personal rights, such recognition being frequently hedged in by overriding requirements such as”public order and morality” or “the authority of the State” or “the exigencies of the common good”, there is necessarily given to the citizen, within the required social, political and moral framework, such a range of personal freedoms or immunities as are necessary to ensure his dignity and freedom as an individual in the type of society envisaged. The essence of those rights is that they inhere in the individual personality of the citizen in his capacity as a vital human component of the social, political and moral order posited by the Constitution.\n\nAmongst those basic personal rights is a complex of rights which vary in nature, purpose and range (each necessarily being a facet of the citizen’s core of individuality within the constitutional order) and which may be compendiously referred to as the right of privacy.”\n\nThe nature of the right to privacy must be such as to ensure the dignity and freedom of an individual in the type of society envisaged by the Constitution, namely, a sovereign, independent and democratic society. The dignity and freedom of an individual in a democratic society cannot be ensured if his communications of a private nature, be they written or telephonic, are deliberately, consciously and unjustifiably intruded upon and interfered with. I emphasise the words “deliberately, consciously and unjustifiably”because an individual must accept the risk of accidental interference with his communications and the fact that in certain circumstances the exigencies of the common good may require and justify such intrusion and interference. No such circumstances exist in this case.\n\nThere has been, as is admitted on behalf of the defendants, a deliberate, conscious and unjustifiable interference by the State through its executive organ with the telephonic communications of the plaintiffs and such interference constitutes an infringement of the constitutional rights to privacy of the three plaintiffs. Though the second plaintiff is not a citizen of this state, he is entitled to the same personal rights as if he were. Such interference constituted an infringement of the plaintiff’s constitutional right to privacy and, in the words of Mr. Justice Walsh spoken during the course of his judgment in Meskell v. CIE [1973] I.R. 121 at p. 134, such interference was “unlawful as constituting a violation of the fundamental law of the State.”\n\nIn the same case, Walsh J. further stated at pp. 132 and 133:”\n\n“[A] right guaranteed by the Constitution or granted by the Constitution can be protected by action or enforced by action even though such action may not fit into any of the ordinary forms of action in either common law or equity and that the constitutional right carries within it its own right to a remedy or for the enforcement of it.”\n\nIn this case the plaintiffs and each of them claim damages for breach of constitutional rights, abuse of power and breach of contract. In the events which have happened, the only remedy which the plaintiffs can obtain in this court, which, as one of the organs of the State is obliged to respect, defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizens, lies in damages. Damages may be compensatory, aggravated, exemplary or punitive.\n\nIn the course of argument in this case I stated that, in my opinion, the plaintiffs were not entitled to punitive damages in this case. I still adhere to that view because of the action of the then Minister for Justice, in the course of the statement made by him on the 20th January, 1983, already referred to, in openly acknowledging that both the telephones referred to in this case were in fact “tapped”, that the system of safeguards which successive Ministers of Justice have publicly declared in Dail Eireann to be an integral part of the system was either disregarded or, what amounted to the same thing, was operated in such a way as to be rendered meaningless and that the facts showed that there was no justification for the tapping of either of the two telephones and that what occurred went beyond what could be explained as just an error of judgment. In doing so he, though belatedly, vindicated the good names of the plaintiffs herein, in particular the first and second plaintiffs.\n\nIt is quite clear from a consideration of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, and in particular s. 7, sub-s. 2 and s. 14, sub-s. 4 thereof that Irish law recognises a distinction as between “punitive damages” and “exemplary damages”. In determining the damages to which the plaintiffs are entitled, I must have regard not only to the distress which was suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the infringement of their constitutional right to privacy, the implication thereof and the publicity consequent thereto but also to the fact that the infringement was carried out deliberately, consciously and without justification by the executive organ of the State which is under a constitutional obligation to respect, vindicate and defend that right.\n\nIn the course of his speech to the House of Lords in Rookes v. Barnard [1964] A.C. 1129, at p. 1226, Lord Devlin distinguished between aggravated and exemplary damages and stated that exemplary damages may be awarded where there has been “oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants or the government”.\n\nThe action of the executive in this case in “tapping” the telephones of the plaintiffs without any lawful justification and in interfering with and intruding upon the privacy of the plaintiffs constituted an attack on their dignity and freedom as individuals and as journalists and cannot be tolerated in a democratic society such as ours is and our Constitution requires it to be and the injury done to the plaintiffs has been aggravated by the fact that it has been done by an organ of state which is under a constitutional obligation to respect, vindicate and defend their rights. The plaintiffs are in my opinion entitled to substantial damages and it is, in the circumstances of this case, irrelevant whether they be described as “aggravated” or “exemplary”damages.\n\nI have carefully considered the evidence of the plaintiffs which I accept as honest and truthful with regard to the effect that the knowledge that their telephones had been “tapped” had on them and the distress that they suffered, which distress was accentuated by the realisation that the only justification for such tapping lay in security reasons or in connection with the investigation of serious crime. I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have not suffered any loss and am not satisfied that the change in the second plaintiff’s career as a journalist is attributable to the actions of the executive. I am also satisfied, particularly having regard to the statement of the Minister for Justice already referred to, that the reputations of the plaintiffs and each of them, have been vindicated. That being said however, the injury done to the plaintiffs’ right to privacy was serious, the distress suffered by them as a result thereof significant and in the case of the first and second plaintiffs was done consciously, deliberately and without justification. In the case of the third plaintiff, who is the spouse of the second plaintiff, the injury was not done consciously or deliberately but incidentally.\n\nIn all the circumstances of this case, I will award to the first plaintiff the sum of £20,000 damages, to the second plaintiff the sum of £20,000 damages and to the third plaintiff the sum of £10,000 damages.\n\n[Reporter’s note: The final order further directed the defendants to return to the plaintiffs all transcripts of the conversations recorded on their respective telephone lines].\n\nStone v South East Coast Strategic Health Authority & Ors\n\n[2006] EWHC 1668\n\nCase No: CO/10426The applicable legal principles\n\nArticle 8 of the Convention is in these terms:\n\n“Article 8. Right to respect for private and family life.\n\n1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of other.”\n\nArticle 10 of the Convention is in these terms:\n\n“Article 10. Freedom of expression.\n\n1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”\n\nWere this to be a claim based on ordinary “reasonableness” grounds it would manifestly be unfounded. The Defendants (and the Panel) have plainly considered the matter with great care. They applied the correct principles; they gave Mr Stone the opportunity to make representations and considered them; they took into account the relevant factors and did not have regard to irrelevant factors; and a conclusion to publish in full could not possibly be styled as perverse or irrational.\n\nBut that, of course, is not the test in a context such as the present. The focus is not on the decision making process but on the substance of the decision reached. The questions that have to be asked are whether Mr Stone’s rights under Article 8 of the Convention have been breached; whether the decision to publish the report is an interference with his right to privacy which is not justified under Article 8(2). Reference may be made to R (SB) v Governors of Denbigh High School [2006] 2 WLR 719 at paragraphs 29-30 [2006] UKHL 15 (Lord Bingham) and paragraph 68 (Lord Hoffmann). That, of course, was a case relating to Article 9 of the Convention, but the reasoning and approach is equally applicable in the present case by reference to Article 8.\n\nFor this purpose, it is also well established that the Court is required to adopt an intensity of review conditioned by the requirement that the proposed limitation of the Convention right be necessary in a democratic society and that such interference is really proportionate to a legitimate aim being pursued: see R (Daly) v Secretary of State for Home Department [2001] 2 AC 532 at p547E-540D (per Lord Steyn).\n\nIn the present case it seems to me that the review of the court must be of a very high intensity. As has been emphasised in the European Court of Human Rights, the protection of personal data, and the need for appropriate safeguards, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of the right to respect for private and family life provided by Article 8: and that is particularly so in the case of medical data: see Z v Finland (1997) 25 EHRR 371; MS v Sweden (1997) 28 EHRR 313. Moreover it seems to me of importance that in the present case Mr Stone is not seeking simply to assert his private rights and private interest (although he is doing that): he is also himself asserting a matter of public interest. That consists not only of the upholding of the general principle of a right to privacy but also the upholding of a wider matter of public interest: viz. that a person can freely and frankly discuss sensitive matters with his or her doctor, probation officer and social worker etc. and, further, can cooperate with an inquiry of the present kind without being deterred by the risk of subsequent disclosure.\n\nIn the case of Campbell v MGN Limited [2004] 2 AC 457 [2004] UKHL 22 which involved the internationally famous model Naomi Campbell (and which raised issues under Article 8 and Article 10) Lord Hope of Craighead said this at paragraph 113:\n\n“But decisions about the publication of material that is private to the individual raise issues that are not simply about presentation and editing. Any interference with the public interest in disclosure has to be balanced against the interference with the right of the individual to respect for their private life. The decisions that are then taken are open to review by the court. The tests which the court must apply are the familiar ones. They are whether publication of the material pursues a legitimate aim and whether the benefits that will be achieved by its publication are proportionate to the harm that may be done by the interference with the right to privacy. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights explains how these principles are to be understood and applied in the context of the facts of each case. Any restriction of the right to freedom of expression must be subjected to very close scrutiny. But so too must any restriction of the right to respect for private life. Neither article 8 nor article 10 has any pre-eminence over the other in the conduct of this exercise. As Resolution 1165 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (1998), para 11, pointed out, they are neither absolute nor in any hierarchical order, since they are of equal value in a democratic society.”\n\nThe same judge had also said in R v Shayler [2003] 1 AC 247, [2002] UKHL 11 in paragraph 61 (in dealing with the application of proportionality principles):\n\n“…it is not enough to assert that the decision that was taken was a reasonable one. A close and penetrating examination of the factual justification is needed if the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention are to remain practical and effective for everyone who wishes to exercise them.”\n\nI propose to apply that approach. It seems to me that a compelling case needs to exist to justify publication of this report in its present form.\n\nArticle 8 is not the only Convention right that has to be considered. As Campbell v MGN Ltd makes clear, Article 10 also has to be considered and given due weight. In the present case, it is now (albeit it was not in the original grounds) accepted on behalf of Mr Stone that – even though the three Defendants, as public bodies, cannot themselves directly invoke the provisions of Article 10 – such Article comes into play: if only because of the general corresponding right of the public to be free to receive information where it is sought to be published.\n\nThe actual methodology to be employed in such cases has to be related to its own facts and own circumstances, a “close and penetrating examination” being adopted. But what is of course clear is that in all such cases a balancing exercise has to be undertaken. And in a case such as the present an ultimate balance has to be struck not only by weighing the considerations for and against a restriction on the right to privacy by reference to Article 8 itself but also by weighing the considerations for and against a restriction on publication by reference to Article 10. An example of this can also be found in the House of Lords decision in re S (a Child) [2005] AC 593 [2005] UKHL 47. That was a decision in a factual context very different from the present – albeit raising issues under Articles 8 and 10. But, if I may respectfully say so, the actual approach adopted by Lord Steyn is very informative. Also very informative are his general comments – which I propose to follow in this case – at paragraph 17 of his opinion:\n\n“The interplay between articles 8 and 10 has been illuminated by the opinions in the House of Lords in Campbell v MGN Ltd [2004] 2 AC 457. For present purposes the decision of the House on the facts of Campbell and the differences between the majority and the minority are not material. What does, however, emerge clearly from the opinions are four propositions. First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each. For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test. This is how I will approach the present case.”\n\nThe overall balancing exercise in this case\n\n(a) The redaction exercise\n\nAs I have said, Mr Stone has accepted that some report should be put into the public domain. One of his complaints has been, however, that the Defendants have taken an “all or nothing” approach to the issue of publication. It is submitted on his behalf that it is a fundamental principle that where there is to be an interference with Convention rights then such interference must be kept to the minimum necessary. That there is indeed such a general principle is borne out by authorities too numerous to require citation. Building on that, Mr Stone’s advisers have in the course of these proceedings submitted, for illustrative purposes, a draft of extracts from what is currently contained in Chapter 8 of the report, redacted so as to delete citation from, or extensive reference to, medical etc. records. They say that this is illustrative of an approach which could and should, as a matter of proportionality, properly be adopted for the rest of the report.\n\nThe Defendants had in fact themselves considered some such approach. They had commissioned in 2001 an experienced journalist to prepare a summary of the full report with a view to publicising just the summary. Such a summary was duly prepared. It was included in the confidential bundle of evidence placed before me. The Defendants decided that, notwithstanding the best efforts of the journalist involved, such summary was not appropriate for publication: it was unable to cover all the fundamental points; it could not contain the amount of detail needed for the report to be of sufficient value to persons reading it; and its effect, by reducing the text, was to distort the report itself and to devalue its conclusions. I have considered that summary. It is sufficient for me to say – although my view will also find reflection in some of my comments later in this judgment – that that plainly was a justified decision.\n\nAs to the exercise in redaction undertaken by the Claimant’s advisers in respect of Chapter 8, my more specific points on that are set out in Confidential Annex “A” to this Judgment. (These annexes, as agreed by Counsel and for reasons which I trust are obvious, must remain for the time being confidential, until further order of the court). But, having carefully considered the proffered redacted version of Chapter 8, I can set out in summary form in this public judgment my reasons for agreeing with the Defendants and with the Second Interested Party (Josie Russell) that such an exercise cannot be justified if there is to be publication:\n\n37.1. First, the redactions tend to give a very misleading picture as to what Chapter 8 of the Report (in its unexpurgated form) is actually saying and what it is seeking to do.\n\n37.2. Second, the deletions of the details would have the effect of depriving the public of knowing precisely what facts had prompted the conclusions and comments of the Panel as set out in Chapter 8. The conclusions and comments are necessarily based on the preceding details.\n\n37.3. Third, the actual details of what was in the medical etc notes is crucial for assessing (and for forming an opinion on) what other professionals, dealing with Mr Stone either at the time or subsequently, should have known or should have done. That is to say, what did they know but not act upon? Or what did they not know but which they should have known? What information and records were (or as the case may be were not) passed on to other agencies?\n\n37.4. Fourth, to the extent that individuals and procedures are criticised (or not criticised) in the report, the reader needs to know the details of what such individuals knew or could reasonably be expected to have known in order to assess such criticisms.\n\n37.5. Fifth, such redactions tend to an impression of arbitrariness. For example – and it is only an example – dates are sometimes deleted, sometimes not.\n\n37.6. Sixth, the scale of the redactions is such (and the proposed redactions extend not only to deletion of citations from medical records but also to some parts of the Panel’s actual conclusions or comments) that it can be said – as the Defendants and Mr Francis on behalf of the Panel do say – that such report in such form virtually ceases to be the report of the independent inquiry and would be rendered “wholly valueless.”\n\nMr Clayton in fact saw fit generally to criticise the “style” of the Report. That is a completely misplaced criticism – the style of the report is a matter for the Panel. A further criticism that the style adopted led to comments or conclusions which could not be linked to the preceding factual details, and so (it was said) could justify an exercise in redaction, is also completely misplaced.\n\nI might add that I consider that there is a degree of force in the observation that publication of a summary or redacted version of this kind might be viewed with scepticism by the public, who might even suspect a cover-up. In any event, I agree overall with the Defendants’ blunt submission that a redacted report of the kind proposed cannot and will not work. It is not practicable to publish a report without disclosing details of Mr Stone’s private medical information.\n\nAs I have mentioned, the Defendants’ own solicitors had, during 2004, put forward to the Panel a list of suggested possible deletions and modifications to the report. That exercise is itself criticised by Mr Clayton. He says that the discussions between Mr Mason and Mr Francis were fundamentally inadequate. He says that they failed to deal with the “overarching question of justification for the wholesale revelation of information derived from confidential medical records”; and that such points as they did discuss were only “the tip of the iceberg” (a view point which subsequently found reflection in the Claimant’s subsequent exercise of wholesale expurgation by way of redaction in respect of Chapter 8).\n\nMy specific comments on the points advanced are set out in Confidential Annex “B” to this judgment. For the purposes of this judgment, I here place on record my view that Mr Francis’ justification for retaining these points in the report to be published, and with which the Defendants agreed, was well-founded. My reasons in essence correspond to those set out in paragraphs 37.2-37.4 of this judgment.\n\nThose submissions on behalf of Mr Stone, however, are again illustrative of the general approach taken on his behalf: which is to the effect that it was not necessary and not of any high priority for the public to know the precise details and records of Mr Stone’s treatment or discussions with health professionals, probation officers and other such people: some of which information, indeed, Mr Clayton was disposed to dismiss as mere “general background”. Nevertheless, it is important to record that Mr Clayton also, fairly and rightly, conceded that the public should be in a position to know what went wrong and should have an intelligent understanding of the conclusions reached; and he accepted that the lessons derived from the inquiry had a high priority.\n\n(b) The balancing exercise\n\nIn my judgment, the following points are particularly relevant in the balancing exercise for the purposes of Article 8.\n\nSo far as Mr Stone is concerned, much the most weighty point in his favour, as it seems to me, is his very entitlement to claim a right of privacy: in respect moreover of an aspect of private information (medical information) which – as the jurisprudence from Europe shows – is regarded as a vital and central element of that which should be protected under Article 8. Further, that is reinforced by other and wider considerations of the public interest: first, that persons may talk freely with their doctors, probation officers and other such persons without being deterred by risk of subsequent disclosure (although it has to be said such a risk in any case exists under English common law rules relating to confidentiality, where disclosure is necessary in the public interest); second, that such persons may give access to such information for the purposes of an inquiry without being deterred from doing so through fear of such matters later being released into the public domain.\n\nBut it seems to me that the force of those points is significantly outweighed by a number of other considerations (albeit some of them overlap):\n\n45.1. First, there is the concession on behalf of Mr Stone that there should be some publication (to the public) of the report and that the public should be able to know what went wrong and should be able to form an intelligent understanding of the conclusions reached: that is to acknowledge that there is indeed a public interest in that regard. But, as I have indicated in my conclusions on the proposed redaction exercise, a system of expurgation which both involves removal of actual reference to the contents of medical notes and (in some respects) involves the editing of some of the comments and conclusions of the inquiry is not viable: the proposal made in that regard on behalf of Mr Stone’s advisers thus wholly devalues the proffered concession. In effect, such exercise – while of course limiting the intrusion into the privacy of Mr Stone – would turn the report into a report which is not, in truth, the report of the inquiry having regard to its terms of reference: and could indeed mislead. It was precisely for those reasons that the Defendants informed me at trial that, if that were to be the conclusion, then they would not publish the report at all. I did not regard that as an in terrorem argument: rather it reflected a realistic and understandable viewpoint.\n\n45.2. Second, there is a true public interest in the public at large knowing of the actual care and treatment supplied (or, as the case may be, not supplied) to Mr Stone: and knowing, and being able to reach an informed assessment of, the failures identified and steps that may be recommended to be taken to address identified deficiencies. This is not simply in the context of the murder of Lin and Megan Russell by Mr Stone in circumstances of such great publicity. It also has a bearing for the future. As Mr Badenoch pointed out, it seems, regrettably, all too likely that in the future – and as has happened in the interim – there will be other instances where persons receiving psychiatric treatment or care in the community will commit acts of murder or extreme violence. The existence of potentially dangerous persons at liberty in the community affects the entire community. That community has a reasonable and justified expectation that an inquiry undertaken after such a high profile case as the present will be publicised in full, so that the public is not left in the dark (or in the shade) about how it happened or left to speculate about the lessons that have been or should be learned and about the recommendations made, with a view to implementation, to reduce the risk of such occurrences in the future.\n\n45.3. Third, and following on from the second point, such objectives are not met simply by releasing a full version of the report to relevant health professionals.\n\n45.4. Fourth, where individuals or agencies involved in Mr Stone’s treatment are (or are not) to be criticised the public can legitimately expect to know the full reasons for that.\n\n45.5. Fifth, the information to be disclosed is to be disclosed solely with the aim of providing an informed view as to what went wrong in this case with a view to important lessons being learned for the future, both for the assistance of other people in the position of Mr Stone and for the protection and reassurance of the public. The actual details of the case are crucial for an informed assessment of the Panel’s conclusions and comments and for forming a view on that. (This would still be so, as I see it, even in circumstances where any established failures are not found to be causative of the subsequent criminality). The position is quite different from that pertaining in the cases of Campbell or of Z v Finland, where there was no corresponding public interest of the present kind.\n\n45.6. Sixth, it is, I think, of importance as a justification for restricting Mr Stone’s right to privacy in this context that this inquiry, and all this publicity, have arisen out of Mr Stone’s own acts – acts found to have been criminal. He has, as it were, put himself in the public domain by reason of those criminal acts, which inevitably created great publicity. Of course that is not to say that a convicted murderer forfeits all his rights under Article 8; of course he does not. But here the information sought to be disclosed relates – and relates solely – to the investigation foreseeably arising out of the very murders which he himself committed.\n\n45.7. Seventh, I also think it a point of considerable importance as a justification for restricting Mr Stone’s right to privacy in this context that a great deal of information relating to the background, treatment and mental health of Mr Stone has already been put in the public domain, and at a significant level of detail (see the numerous newspaper articles mentioned above and the StoneChronology prepared by Professor Gaber). The essential nature of his observed mental and personality disorders is already known. When so much has already been divulged, it seems to me highly material to a decision whether to permit disclosure of more such information. Indeed I think it also noteworthy that the Panel make clear that they also wish to correct certain errors and inaccuracies in previous public reporting. I agree with Mr Clayton that previous publication of private information in the public domain does not mean that an individual necessarily loses his right to privacy in respect of a proposal to put yet more such material in the public domain (cf. Editions Plon v France 18th May 2004, unrep. decision of the European Court of Human Rights, Second Section). But, as it seems to me, it must be relevant to the balancing exercise and to the issue of proportionality: and here the previous disclosure in the public domain has already been very extensive indeed. That must tell against the asserted detrimental impact of publication of further, albeit more detailed, information.\n\n45.8. Eighth, Josie Russell and Dr Russell – the victims (directly or indirectly) of these crimes – support publication. So do – quite apart from the Panel itself and all the Defendants – the Secretary of State and relevant Mental Health authorities.\n\nMr Stone has raised a concern that publicising this report in full will give rise to risks as to his own personal safety. But the evidence shows that that has been assessed by the prison service, who conclude that there is no such increased risk.\n\nAs to the point made by Mr Clayton that others will be deterred in the future from cooperating with inquiries of this kind, that is a legitimate point of principle and cannot be ruled out as a possibility. The evidence, however, in this case indicates that in the past other offenders have cooperated fully and have consented to providing information to inquiries in the knowledge that a report is to be published. There is also no actual evidence that access to the relevant information has in fact been restricted in such cases because of concerns as to subsequent publication.\n\nThere are a number of other points I should mention:\n\n48.1. I gained the distinct impression that Mr Stone – who, as I have said, continues to assert his innocence – was concerned that publication of this information would incline the public against his assertions. I cannot attach any significant weight to that. First, Mr Stone already has been convicted; in the eyes of the public he is entitled to be considered guilty. Second, and in any case, such publication of these details is unlikely, realistically, to be significantly more damaging to him with regard to his criminality than the previous publicity he has experienced.\n\n48.2. Mr Stone is also concerned as to how the press will publicise the matter: he fears adverse sensationalism. But, broadly speaking, and within the parameters of the law of defamation, it is a matter for the Press as to how it reports matters. Besides, it is not to be presumed that further press publicity will necessarily be unfairly hostile in the way Mr Stone fears. There were indications from a number of the press articles following his conviction that a thoughtful line was being taken as to the need for lessons to be learned. It is not fanciful to think, in fact, that some readers of the report perhaps may be inclined, having access to the full facts, to take a more sympathetic view of Mr Stone than, in the absence of full information, they hitherto may have been inclined to take.\n\n48.3. Publication of the report in full can, in my view, only assist the legitimate and ongoing public debate with regard to treatment of the mentally ill and of those with disturbed personalities in the community: which has already resulted, among other things, in extensive proposed revisions to the Mental Health legislation.\n\nFor all these reasons (which in many ways reflect the reasons given by the Panel itself as set out in paragraph 18 above and the reasons given by the Defendants, and with which I agree) I think that a compelling case in favour of publication in full is made out, balancing the relevant considerations under Article 8 alone. It seems to me, by reference to that Article, that such a decision is proportionate and justified as being necessary in the public interest.\n\nTurning then to Article 10 – which is conceded to be engaged and relevant – and balancing the considerations there, as I see it that can only operate to confirm such a viewpoint. The considerations set out above – not least the fact that in essence much of the information is (albeit without the detail of the report) already in the public domain – seem to me to tell strongly against an interference with the operation of Article 10 being justified.\n\nMr Clayton made the point that this is not a case of publication by the press, the freedom of which the courts, generally speaking, seek to uphold. That is true. But the reality is that, for much of the public, access to the report will depend on informed comment by the media. It surely is desirable for the press and other media to have access to the full report – the more so when one of the purposes of the report is to correct previous publicised inaccuracies – so that their summaries and their comments for public consumption are based on knowledge of the full facts and details as set out in the report. It is moreover, in my view, important that the conduct of the public authorities in a context such as the present are seen to be subject to public scrutiny, with consequential legitimate and informed public debate on the conclusions to be drawn and lessons to be learned.\n\nFor these reasons, and on the ultimate balancing test, I am of the clear view that the decision to publish the report in full was entirely justified.\n\nThe Data Protection Act 1998\n\nI turn to the argument based on the Data Protection Act 1998. This was rather shortly addressed in the written submissions but was greatly expanded in oral argument. If the argument is correct, it would of course mean that there could be no publication as the Defendants seek. Indeed, publication would also then not be “in accordance with law” for the purposes of Article 8.\n\nHowever I consider that the Claimant’s argument is unjustifiably restrictive and is not correct.\n\nThe Data Protection Act 1998 was made in consequence of Directive 95/46/EC of 24th October 1995. As a matter of principle, the Act should be sought to be interpreted so as to accord with the policy and purpose behind the Directive.\n\nThe recitals to the Directive are extensive. Respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, “notably the right to privacy”, is much emphasised: see recitals (1)-(3), (7), (8), (10) and (33). Recital (34) provides as follows:\n\n“(34) Whereas Member States must also be authorized, when justified by grounds of important public interest, to derogate from the prohibition on processing sensitive categories of date where important reasons of public interest so justify in areas such as public health and social protection – especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the health insurance system – scientific research and government statistics; whereas it is incumbent on them, however, to provide specific and suitable safeguards so as to protect the fundamental rights and the privacy of individuals.”\n\nArticle 1 of the Directive provides as follows:\n\n“1. In accordance with this Directive, Member states shall protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.\n\n2. Member States shall neither restrict nor prohibit the free flow of personal data between Member States for reasons connected with the protection afforded under paragraph 1.”\n\nArticle 8 (in the relevant respects) provides as follows:\n\n“(1) Member states shall prohibit the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life.\n\n. . . .\n\n(3) Paragraph 1 shall not apply where processing of the data is required for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment or the management of health-care services, and where those data are processed by a health professional subject under national law or rules established by national competent bodies to the obligation of professional secrecy or by another person also subject to an equivalent obligation of secrecy.\n\n(4) Subject to the provision of suitable safeguards, Member States may, for reasons of substantial public interest, lay down exemptions in addition to those laid down in paragraph 2 either by national law or by decision of the supervisory authority.”\n\nThe structure of the Data Protection Act 1998 – reflecting that of the Directive – is to provide for “personal data” (defined in section 1) and then (in section 2) to make provision for “sensitive personal data”. Sensitive personal data expressly includes personal data consisting of information as to a data subject’s physical or mental health or condition: section 2(e). “Data controller” and “data processor” are given wide definitions in section 1. “Processing” is also given a wide definition in section 1: see also the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Campbell case [2003] QB 633. Section 4 then sets out the principles to be applied by every data controller. The first principle (as set out in Schedule 1) is that: “Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless:\n\na) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met; and\n\nb) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.”\n\nThat language connotes that more than one condition in Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 is capable of being satisfied in any given case.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Defendants’ decision to publish would involve “processing” of “sensitive personal data” relating to Mr Stone.\n\nIt is clear in this case – and is conceded on behalf of Mr Stone at this stage of the argument – that a condition in Schedule 2 is satisfied: viz. paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 2 (“The processing is necessary… for the purpose of any other functions of a public nature exercised in the public interest by any person”). It is common ground that the word “necessary”, as used in the Schedules to the 1998 Act, carries with it the connotations of the European Convention on Human Rights: those include the proposition that a pressing social need is involved and that the measure employed is proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued.\n\nThe issue in the present case thus is whether one or more conditions set out in Schedule 3 is satisfied.\n\nParagraph 7 of Schedule 3 provides that one such condition is where “the processing is necessary…. (b) for the exercise of any functions conferred on any person by or under an enactment”.\n\nThat the Defendants have the power to commission an inquiry and promulgate its report is, as I have said and as Mr Clayton ultimately accepted, established under s.2 of the National Health Service Act 1977 and paragraph 3 of the 2002 Regulations. Such power is properly described as a “function” – indeed is so described in paragraph 3(3) and Schedule 1 of the 2002 Regulations themselves. Further the Defendants, by reference to the 2002 Regulations made pursuant to the 1977 Act, are exercising functions “under” an enactment. Consequently since the processing is – consistently with the earlier part of my judgment and the Claimant’s concession by reference to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 – “necessary”, one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is satisfied.\n\nMr Clayton’s response to this, in his submissions in reply, was very wide ranging. It came to this. The inclusion of such provision has to be traced back, he submitted, to Article 8(4) of the Directive. Article 8(4), however, is qualified by the words “subject to the provision of suitable safeguards”. But paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 does not, he submits, make provision for any such safeguards (in contrast, for example, with paragraph 9 of Schedule 3): and he submits it should be read, consistently with the Directive, so as to include the provision of appropriate safeguards.\n\nI cannot accept this for a number of reasons:\n\n65.1. First, the Directive clearly leaves a margin of appreciation to Member States in implementation.\n\n65.2. Second, Article 8(4) itself leaves it to Member States to decide what “suitable safeguards” are to be provided in a particular case.\n\n65.3. Third, the structure of the 1998 Act – reflecting the Directive – is to build in safeguards. By way of example, an exception has to be justified where it is “necessary”.\n\n65.4. Fourth, Parliament clearly has distinguished paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 from paragraph 9: in the latter “appropriate safeguards” are expressly made requisite; in the former (which relates to the exercise of functions by or under an enactment, with the attendant responsibilities that entails) they are not.\n\n65.5. Finally, if an additional requirement for “appropriate safeguards” is somehow to be read into paragraph 7 it is left unexplained as to what different result that would or should actually lead to in the present case.\n\nMr Havers and Miss Laing also argued that the Defendants came within paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 (which reflects what is provided in Article 8(3) of the Directive). In view of my decision on paragraph 7 it is not strictly necessary to express a concluded view on this: but I will, in deference to the arguments I heard, state – albeit briefly – my opinion on that.\n\nParagaph 8 of Schedule 3 provides as follows:\n\n“(1) The processing is necessary for medical purposes and is undertaken by:\n\n(a) a health professional or\n\n(b) a person who in the circumstances owes a duty of confidentiality which is equivalent to that which would arise if that person were a health professional.\n\n(2) In this paragraph “medical purposes” includes the purposes of preventative medicine, medical diagnosis, medical research, the provision of care and treatment and the management of healthcare services.”\n\nThe publishing of the report would, I consider, be within the ambit of “medical purposes”, for the purposes of paragraph 8, as relating to “the management of healthcare services”. It would also, essentially for the reasons I have already given, be “necessary” for such medical purposes. Furthermore the processing would be by the Defendants, who are within the class of persons owing a duty of confidentiality equivalent to that which would arise if they were health professionals. Accordingly, the processing would fall within the ambit of paragraph 8.\n\nI was attracted by Mr Clayton’s argument that such paragraph was intended to relate to (for example) an exchange of professional views on a medical case between two separate medical departments: the safeguard being that each is under a duty of confidentiality. But as against that paragraph 8 focuses on the processing and the person undertaking the processing: it does not focus on the recipient of the information. Further, a safeguard is built in, in that the duty of confidentiality owed is such that, under English law, there in any event could be no processing or disclosure unless it had first been concluded that (assuming the absence of express consent) the public interest so required.\n\nOverall, therefore, I preferred the submissions of Mr Havers and Miss Laing on the availability of paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 here to sanction the publication of the report, in addition to paragraph 7 of Schedule 3.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe public interest requires publication of the report in full. The decision to publish was justified and proportionate, and does not constitute an unwarranted interference with Article 8 of the Convention. Further, no breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 is involved.\n\nAccordingly, this claim fails and I refuse to grant Mr Stone any of the relief that he seeks.\n\nANNEX “A”\n\nMichael Stone\n\n-and-\n\nSouth East Coast Strategic Health Authority\n\nand Others\n\n1. Chapter 8 of the Report is headed “Addiction Services”.\n\n2. The Claimant’s illustrative redaction exercise relates to the first four sections of the Chapter and to sections thirteen and fourteen.\n\n3. The view of the Panel, whose report it is, is clearly set out in the second witness statement of Mr Francis dated 14th June 2006. He quotes in it the view of Dr Higgins as representing in summary the Panel’s view:\n\n“The proposed draft seeks to exclude any detail of Mr Stone’s psychopathology and behaviour and how this was reported by him and how others reported it in turn and what the responses and consequences were. This renders the report virtually valueless, in my view.\n\nHis case and its variable management was extremely complex over a considerable period of time. It involved many individuals and agencies. Rarely did anyone have close to the full picture that we, in retrospect and with much endeavour, arrived at. Not describing accurately and in full what any individual did know or could have known at any particular point makes it quite unfair to criticise actions or omissions by anyone involved and, equally as important, to describe how well some individuals performed in such trying circumstances.\n\nThis is even more important in this case for other reasons. Marked inaccuracies have already been reported in the media. It has already been put about in the media that this was a straightforward case in which some individuals performed to a poor standard.\n\nFinally, it was our remit to describe what happened in all its detail, complexity and uncertainty, exactly as and when it happened, and as events seemed to those at the time, in order that the true story is told and what lessons can be drawn from the tragedy are learned. The bowdlerised version as clearly intended by this draft chapter is quite inadequate to this task.”\n\n4. Mr Francis, after commenting in detail on the proposed redactions, himself says that if comparable amendments were to be made to all chapters of the report he would consider that “the purpose of publishing it would be entirely defeated”. Having considered the entirety of the proposed redacted parts of Chapter 8, I agree with the views of Dr Higgins and Mr Francis and am of the clear viewthat these comments are justified.\n\n5. By way of example, the starting section, headed “Overall Evaluation of the Addiction Services” is subject to extensive redaction. The purpose is unclear in many respects. For example (and it is only an example) in dealing with the Manor Road Clinic the report says “No systematic or comprehensive addictions assessment was carried out and no full substance abuse history was taken”. These words are redacted; and what is substituted are the words “There were deficiencies in the assessment of his condition”. In the same paragraph the report refers to “relevant notes of attendances at counselling sessions were brief and uninformative”: in the redacted version the words “of attendances at counselling sessions” are deleted.\n\n6. This straightaway indicates the problem. A bland reference to “deficiencies in the assessment of his condition” leaves the public to wonder what the deficiencies were and who (if anyone) is intended to be criticised and what should in consequence be improved. As to the notes, again the public is left wondering as to the source of the notes and to what they relate.\n\n7. Again, under a heading “Changing the Diagnosis” etc the entirety of the report’s overview reads as follows:\n\n“Mr Stone made several requests for in-patient detoxification treatment, and on one occasion a plan for in-patient admission following community detoxification was formulated. None of these resulted in an admission. No offer of a bed was ever made to Mr Stone by the Addictions team. In-patient detoxification was not actively or clearly encouraged even when he reached his pre-determined target for admission. The reasons for this are not recorded”.\n\nThe redaction exercise deletes that in its entirety and substitutes for it: “The Panel identified a number of shortcomings in relation to the service’s approach to possible in-patient detoxification”.\n\n8. This bland rewording is, as it seems to me, a good example of how the report is effectively being rewritten. It completely dilutes the impact of what the Panel is saying and the identification of specific deficiencies.\n\n9. Yet further, in section 3.1 whole swathes of what the panel have written are deleted and entirely reworded in, generalised language. There is, of course, a wholesale deletion of details from the relevant medical notes: for example that a GP was in February 1993 reporting to a psychiatrist that Mr Stone had “bizarre fantasies and urges to attack people”; that the GP’s reported view was that Mr Stone was “very paranoid and a threat to children and people outside” and “Mr Stone also feels that he is a threat and expressed a wish to be locked away in Broadmoor”. References from the notes on another occasion are to the effect that Mr Stone’s favourite drug was heroin or methadone because they “calm him down and stop him from being aggressive.” All this detail is removed – thereby preventing the public from making an informed view as to who knew what, what was in consequence being done (or, as the case may be, not done) and so on. Precisely the same criticism can be made of wholesale deletions of other parts of section 3.\n\n10. The same objection can be made to the redaction exercise undertaken in section 4. There is wholesale deletion of citations from medical notes, or reports of health professionals based on those notes, with a brief and uninformative “summary” – in wholly new language – of that information. Thus (by way of example) in sections 4.6 and 4.7 of the actual report there is a description of the notes of Dr W, a community psychiatrist, who had seen Mr Stone on 9th March 1993 setting out his comments about the effect of drugs on Mr Stone and the notes of Mr Y (a mental health nurse who saw Mr Stone at this time) are also described in detail: these include comments to the effect that Mr Stone “could be a danger to himself or other people. Mr Y said he realised he would have to inform other people very quickly if things became unstable”.\n\n11. These points are clearly of great relevance. The details matter. Yet the redacted exercise – which also for some reason sometimes deletes dates, thereby distorting the level of contact going on at the time – turns the wording into “Dr W described to the Panel his experience of meeting Mr Stone”. That is virtually useless as information to the reader. So far as Mr Y is concerned this becomes: “Mr Y – RMN told the Panel about his experience of seeing Mr Stone and his impression as regards his behaviour towards others and his drug use. He expressed views about the likely nature of his prospective relationship with Mr Stone.” What was that impression? What were these views? What could be the consequences?\n\n12. This kind of approach is consistently repeated in the redaction exercise. The consequence is a distorted report, with a vitiating lack of information. Indeed it has two wider consequences:\n\n(1) First the Recommendations made at the end of Chapter 8 are left unredacted and unaltered. But these Recommendations are intended to be founded on the details contained in the preceding parts of the Chapter: the redaction exercise thus leaves the Recommendations to a significant extent without their factual base and justification.\n\n(2) Moreover the summary Comments of the Panel in Section 4 are themselves the subject of redaction in places. Thus a criticism of the Panel was that no addictions assessment was conducted pulling all the relevant information “together” in one place in the form of notes”. But these crucial last words are proposed to be deleted, thereby distorting the Panel’s point. The Panel then go on to say that “In particular there was no evidence of”: [and then it sets out a number of analyses, appraisals and assessments that were not made.] All these are deleted too.\n\n13. I do not need to say more. What I have sought to say above by way of example is clearly borne out, I consider, by a study of the redacted parts of Chapter 8, read as a whole. I accept as justified the assessment of the Defendants (as set out in the further witness statement of Mr Marsden and Mr Underwood). Thus, as Mr Underwood says: “the overall effect of omitting so much details is to make Chapter 8 sparse, unsubstantive and lacking credibility. Most importantly, it fails to give an accurate account of what happened.” I agree. I also agree with Mr Badenoch’s submission that the Panel’s factual conclusions derive their force and validity from the Panel’s detailed enquiry into, and description of, the observed and recorded history of Mr Stone and his presentation to the variousagencies; from the consequential response (or lack of it); and from the rationale for the decision making and responses (or lack of them) on the part of those agencies and relevant personnel. That is what the public interest requires to be known. I think that Mr Badenoch was justified in his submission that the Claimant’s attempts to redact Chapter 8 if anything in fact established the need for publication in full.\n\nANNEX “B”\n\nMichael Stone\n\n-and-\n\nSouth East Coast Strategic Health Authority\n\nand Others\n\n1. I have referred in the body of the judgment to the Defendants’ solicitors’ letter to Mr Francis dated 8th June 2004. Mr Francis provided a lengthy response, on behalf of Panel, on 9th July 2004. In that letter, Mr Francis reiterated that the Panel had borne in mind throughout the question of privacy; and that, to the extent that – as the Panel thought – the public interest required disclosure, it should be limited to that required for the identified purposes. In my judgment, the latter shows clearly that the Panel had approached the matter in the right way.\n\n2. The particular points raised by Mr Mason as being of possible concern were 24 in number.\n\n3. The first and second points were queries as to whether background information from 1972 including assorted test results was really necessary. Mr Francis’ response was that it was considered necessary to include a full account from childhood records to show the history of disturbance from an early age, and also to note positive features in Mr Stone’s character that stage. Mr Francis went on to say “we found it of concern that those involved in the care and treatment of Mr Stone in adult life apparently had no knowledge of the childhood background”. These are valid points.\n\n4. The third point is a query to a reference in the report to the use of “hammers” conversed in Mr Stone’s discussions with health professionals (a point also made by the solicitors with regard to similar references in other parts of the report). It seems to me self-evident – as it did to Mr Francis – that such references were necessary: not simply because of the manner of the deaths of Lin and Megan Russell but because such references were highly material to the assessment of Mr Stone’s dangerousness and to management needs. As Mr Francis said, with regard to the judgments the professionals needed to make: “Merely to refer in general terms to a history of acts and threats of violence would be insufficiently specific and would indeed be inaccurate. They were faced with specific information about Mr Stone’s actual use of, and thoughts concerning the use of, a specific type of weapon”. That is a valid point.\n\n5. The same points, in my view, are validly made as to the solicitors’ queries to references variously in the report to records of Mr Stone referring to stabbing; to dismembering; to threats of murdering someone; to threats to kill prison officers; to his reporting fantasies about killing children. These can all be justified. Precisely what professional staff knew – either at the time or subsequently when reviewing the files – was relevant to risk assessment and perceptions of dangerousness and to the responses needed in consequence.\n\n6. A query was raised as to the reference to Mr Stone’s previous convictions. But those in themselves were relevant to the assessment process. In any event, they were in the public domain, having been read out at trial for sentencing purposes.\n\n7. A query was raised as to whether it was necessary to make a reference to Mr Stone’s sexuality. That was most briefly done, the report simply saying (at p.222) that in October 1996 a detailed multi-disciplinary review was carried out; and that “his sexuality was also reviewed at some length”. That nothing further than that was said on this aspect is in my view illustrative of the fact that the Panel throughout was trying to keep the disclosure of private detail to the minimum necessary for the task in hand. However that there was such a review is, as Mr Francis observed, material to whether a competent review was undertaken at that time. Clearly there was room for suspecting psycho-sexual issues might be present (indeed such a point had been raised in at least one newspaper article).\n\n8. It is not necessary to say more on this. I accept Mr Havers’ submission that all these points are necessarily made, and form part of the detailed information on which the Panel’s ultimate conclusions necessarily are based. I reject the Claimant’s criticism of the inclusion of these points – for reasons which broadly correspond to my rejection of the proposed redaction exercise.\n\n9. I only add that these points as queried by the Defendants’ Solicitors had virtually all, to a greater or lesser extent, emerged in the media and thus, as points, were in the public domain: even if, of course, not raised with the detail or precision of the report itself.\n\nNiemietz v Germany\n\n16 EHRR 97, [1992] ECHR 80, [1993] 16 EHRR 97, (1993) 16 EHRR 97, (1992) 16 EHRR 97, [1992] ECHR 13710/88, [1992] 16 EHRR 97\n\nI. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nMr Niemietz lives in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, where he practises as a lawyer (Rechtsanwalt).\n\nOn 9 December 1985 a letter was sent by telefax from the Freiburg post office to Judge Miosga of the Freising District Court (Amtsgericht). It related to criminal proceedings for insulting behaviour (Beleidigung) pending before that court against Mr J., an employer who refused to deduct from his employees’ salaries and pay over to the tax office the Church tax to which they were liable. The letter bore the signature of one Klaus Wegner – possibly a fictitious person -, followed by the words “on behalf of the Anti-clerical Working Group (Antiklerikaler Arbeitskreis) of the Freiburg Bunte Liste (multi-coloured group)” and a post-office box number. It read as follows:\n\n“On 10.12.1985 the trial against Mr [J.] will take place before you. We, the Anti-clerical Working Group of the Freiburg Bunte Liste, protest most strongly about these proceedings.\n\nIn the FRG, the Church, on the basis of the Hitler concordat and in violation of the State’s duty to maintain neutrality, enjoys most extensive privileges. As a result, every non-Christian citizen of this State has to suffer disadvantages and daily annoyance. Among other things, the FRG is the only State which acts as Church-tax collector. It requires employers, whether they be Christians or not, to pay over Church tax for their Christian employees and thus relieve the Church of financial administrative work. [J.] has, for years, courageously and consistently refused to support the financing of the Church in this way and has made an appropriate arrangement whereby the Church tax of his Christian employees is paid without his own involvement.\n\nThis attempt – in a State which counts the separation of State and Church among its basic principles – to insist upon just such a separation has not only exposed [J.] to persistent vexation and interferences on the part of State authorities, culminating in the tax office employing coercive measures, such as attachment, to collect from him Church tax which his employees had already paid a long time previously. It has in addition involved him – when he called these underhand methods by their name – in the present proceedings for alleged insulting behaviour.\n\nWere it your task as the competent judge to conduct an unbiased examination of this ‘case of insulting behaviour’, then it must be said that you have not only failed to carry out this task, but also abused your office in order to try – by means which give a warning and a reminder of the darkest chapters of German legal history – to break the backbone of an unloved opponent of the Church. It was with extreme indignation that we learned of the compulsory psychiatric examination which was conducted on your instructions, and to which [J.] has had to submit in the meantime. We shall use every avenue open to us, in particular our international contacts, to bring to public notice this action of yours, which is incompatible with the principles of a democratic State subscribing to the rule of law.\n\nWe shall follow the further course of the proceedings against [J.] and expect you to abandon the path of terrorisation which you have embarked upon, and to reach the only decision appropriate in this case – an acquittal.”\n\nThe applicant had, as a city councillor, been chairman for some years of the Freiburg Bunte Liste, which is a local political party. He had also played a particularly committed role in, although he had never been a member of, its Anti-clerical Working Group, which sought to curtail the influence of the Church.\n\nUntil the end of 1985 certain of the mail for the Bunte Liste, which had as its address for correspondence only the post-office box number that had been given in the letter to Judge Miosga, had been delivered to the office (Bürogemeinschaft) of the applicant and a colleague of his; the latter had also been active on behalf of the party and had acted for it professionally.\n\nOn 13 January 1986 the Director of the Munich I Regional Court (Landgericht) requested the Munich public prosecutor’s office (Staatsanwaltschaft) to institute criminal proceedings against Klaus Wegner for the offence of insulting behaviour, contrary to Article 185 of the Criminal Code. Attempts to serve a summons on him were unsuccessful. The applicant’s colleague refused to give any information about Klaus Wegner or his whereabouts and other attempts to identify him failed.\n\nIn the context of the above-mentioned proceedings the Munich District Court issued, on 8 August 1986, a warrant to search the law office of the applicant and his colleague and the homes of Ms D. and Ms G. The warrant read as follows:\n\n“Preliminary investigations against Klaus Wegner concerning Article 185 of the Criminal Code\n\nDecision\n\nThe search of the following residential and business premises for documents which reveal the identity of ‘Klaus Wegener’ [sic] and the seizure of such documents is ordered.\n\n1.. Office premises shared by the lawyers Gottfried Niemietz and …,\n\n2.. Home (including adjoining rooms and cars) of Ms [D.] …,\n\n3.. Home (including adjoining rooms and cars) of Ms [G.]\n\nReasons\n\nOn 9 December 1985 a letter insulting Judge Miosga of the Freising District Court was sent by telefax from the Freiburg post office. It was sent by the Anti-clerical Working Group of the Freiburg Bunte Liste. The letter was signed by one Klaus Wegener.\n\nUntil now it has not been possible to identify the signatory. The Freiburg Bunte Liste could not be contacted by mail otherwise than through a box number. Until the end of 1985 such mail was forwarded to the office of Niemietz and …, and since the start of 1986 to Ms [D.]. It has therefore to be assumed that documents throwing light on the identity of Klaus Wegener can be found at the premises of the above-mentioned persons.\n\nFurthermore, it is to be assumed that there are such documents in the home of Ms [G.], the Chairwoman of the Freiburg Bunte Liste.\n\nFor these reasons, it is to be expected that evidence will be found in the course of a search of the premises indicated in this decision.”\n\nThe search of the law office, the need for which the investigating authorities had first tried to obviate by questioning a witness, was effected by representatives of the Freiburg public prosecutor’s office and the police on 13 November 1986. According to a police officer’s report drawn up on the following day, the premises were entered at about 9.00 a.m. and inspected in the presence of two office assistants. The actual search began at about 9.15 a.m., when the applicant’s colleague arrived, and lasted until about 10.30 a.m. The applicant himself arrived at 9.30 a.m. He declined to give any information as to the identity of Klaus Wegner, on the ground that he might thereby expose himself to the risk of criminal prosecution.\n\nThose conducting the search examined four filing cabinets with data concerning clients, three files marked respectively “BL”, “C.W. -Freiburg District Court …” and “G. – Hamburg Regional Court” and three defence files marked respectively “K.W. – Karlsruhe District Court …”, “Niemietz et al. – Freiburg District Court …” and “D. – Freiburg District Court”. According to the applicant, the office’s client index was also looked at and one of the files in question was its “Wegner defence file”. Those searching neither found the documents they were seeking nor seized any materials. In the proceedings before the Commission, the applicant stated that he had been able to put aside in time documents pointing to the identity of Klaus Wegner and had subsequently destroyed them.\n\nThe homes of Ms D. and Ms G. were also searched; documents were found that gave rise to a suspicion that the letter to Judge Miosga had been sent by Ms D. under an assumed name.\n\nOn 10 December 1986 the Chairman of the Freiburg Bar Association, who had been informed about the search by the applicant’s colleague, addressed a formal protest to the President of the Munich District Court. The Chairman sent copies to the Bavarian Minister of Justice and the Munich Bar Association and invited the latter to associate itself with the protest.\n\nIn a reply of 27 January 1987, the President of the Munich District Court stated that the search was proportionate because the letter in question constituted a serious interference with a pending case; hence no legal action on the protest was necessary.\n\nThe criminal proceedings against “Klaus Wegner” were later discontinued for lack of evidence.\n\nOn 27 March 1987 the Munich I Regional Court declared an appeal (Beschwerde) lodged by the applicant, pursuant to Article 304 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, against the search warrant to be inadmissible, on the ground that it had already been executed (“wegen prozessualer Überholung”). It considered that in the circumstances there was no legal interest in having the warrant declared unlawful. It had not been arbitrary, since there had been concrete indications that specified material would be found. There was no ground for holding that Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 21 below) had been circumvented: the warrant had been based on the fact that mail for the Freiburg Bunte Liste had for some time been delivered to the applicant’s office and it could not be assumed that that mail could concern a lawyer-client relationship. In addition, personal honour was not so minor a legal interest as to render the search disproportionate. There could be no question in the present case of preventing a lawyer from freely exercising his profession.\n\nOn 28 April 1987 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint (Verfassungsbeschwerde) against the search warrant of 8 August 1986 and the Munich I Regional Court’s decision of 27 March 1987. On 18 August a panel of three judges of the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) declined to accept the complaint for adjudication, on the ground that it did not offer sufficient prospects of success.\n\nThe Federal Constitutional Court also found that the Munich I Regional Court’s decision of 27 March 1987 that the applicant’s appeal was inadmissible was not objectionable in terms of constitutional law. Furthermore, as regards the actual execution of the warrant, Mr Niemietz had not exhausted the remedy available to him under section 23(1) of the Introductory Act to the Courts Organisation Act (Einführungsgesetz zum Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz).\n\nII. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n\nThe search complained of was ordered in the context of criminal proceedings for insulting behaviour, an offence punishable by imprisonment for a maximum, where no physical violence is involved, of one year or a fine (Article 185 of the Criminal Code).\n\nArticle 13 para. 1 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) guarantees the inviolability of the home (Wohnung); this provision has been consistently interpreted by the German courts in a wide sense, to include business premises (see, in particular, the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment of 13 October 1971 – Entscheidungssammlung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, vol. 32, p. 54).\n\nArticle 103 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the home and other premises (Wohnung und andere Räume) of a person who is not suspected of a criminal offence may be searched only in order to arrest a person charged with an offence, to investigate indications of an offence or to seize specific objects and provided always that there are facts to suggest that such a person, indications or objects is or are to be found on the premises to be searched.\n\nSearch warrants may be challenged, as regards their lawfulness, in proceedings instituted under Article 304 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and, as regards their manner of execution, in proceedings instituted under section 23(1) of the Introductory Act to the Courts Organisation Act.\n\nIn Germany a lawyer is an independent organ in the administration of justice and an independent counsel and representative in all legal matters.\n\nAn unauthorised breach of secrecy by a lawyer is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a fine (Article 203 para. 1(3) of the Criminal Code). A lawyer is entitled to refuse to give testimony concerning any matter confided to him in a professional capacity (Article 53 para. 1(2) and (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The last-mentioned provisions, in conjunction with Article 97, prohibit, with certain exceptions, the seizure of correspondence between lawyer and client.\n\nIII. CASE-LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES\n\nIn its judgment of 21 September 1989 in Joined Cases 46/87 and 227/88 Hoechst v. Commission [1989] European Court Reports (“ECR”) 2859 at 2924, the Court of Justice of the European Communities stated as follows:\n\n“Since the applicant has also relied on the requirements stemming from the fundamental right to the inviolability of the home, it should be observed that, although the existence of such a right must be recognized in the Community legal order as a principle common to the laws of the Member States in regard to the private dwellings of natural persons, the same is not true in regard to undertakings, because there are not inconsiderable divergences between the legal systems of the Member States in regard to the nature and degree of protection afforded to business premises against intervention by the public authorities.\n\nNo other inference is to be drawn from Article 8(1) (art. 8-1) of the European Convention on Human Rights which provides that: ‘Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence’. The protective scope of that article is concerned with the development of man’s personal freedom and may not therefore be extended to business premises. Furthermore, it should be noted that there is no case-law of the European Court of Human Rights on that subject.\n\nNone the less, in all the legal systems of the Member States, any intervention by the public authorities in the sphere of private activities of any person, whether natural or legal, must have a legal basis and be justified on the grounds laid down by law, and, consequently, those systems provide, albeit in different forms, protection against arbitrary or disproportionate intervention. The need for such protection must be recognized as a general principle of Community law. In that regard, it should be pointed out that the Court has held that it has the power to determine whether measures of investigation taken by the Commission under the ECSC Treaty are excessive (judgment of 14 December 1962 in Joined Cases 5 to 11 and 13 to 15/62 San Michele and Others v. Commission [1962] ECR 449).”\n\nThis statement was affirmed in the same court’s judgments of 17 October 1989 in Case 85/87 Dow Benelux v. Commission [1989] ECR 3137 at 3157 and Joined Cases 97 to 99/87 Dow Chemical Ibérica and Others v. Commission [1989] ECR 3165 at 3185-6.\n\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\nIn his application (no. 13710/88) lodged with the Commission on 15 February 1988, Mr Niemietz alleged that the search had violated his right to respect for his home and correspondence, guaranteed by Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, and had also, by impairing the goodwill of his law office and his reputation as a lawyer, constituted a breach of his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). In addition, he submitted that, contrary to Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention, he had no effective remedies before German authorities in respect of those complaints.\n\nBy decision of 5 April 1990, the Commission declared the complaints under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nIn its report of 29 May 1991 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention and that no separate issue arose under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment….\n\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT\n\nAt the hearing, the Agent of the Government invited the Court to find that the Federal Republic of Germany had not violated Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention in the present case.\n\nThe applicant, for his part, requested the Court to hold that the search of his office had constituted a breach of the Convention.\n\nAS TO THE LAW\n\nI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 (art. 8) OF THE CONVENTION\n\nMr Niemietz alleged that the search of his law office had given rise to a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n\n2.. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\n\nThis submission was accepted by the Commission, on the basis that the search constituted an unjustified interference with the applicant’s private life and home.\n\nA. Was there an “interference”?\n\nIn contesting the Commission’s conclusion, the Government maintained that Article 8 (art. 8) did not afford protection against the search of a lawyer’s office. In their view, the Convention drew a clear distinction between private life and home, on the one hand, and professional and business life and premises, on the other.\n\nIn arriving at its opinion that there had been an interference with Mr Niemietz’s “private life” and “home”, the Commission attached particular significance to the confidential relationship that exists between lawyer and client. The Court shares the Government’s doubts as to whether this factor can serve as a workable criterion for the purposes of delimiting the scope of the protection afforded by Article 8 (art. 8). Virtually all professional and business activities may involve, to a greater or lesser degree, matters that are confidential, with the result that, if that criterion were adopted, disputes would frequently arise as to where the line should be drawn.\n\nThe Court does not consider it possible or necessary to attempt an exhaustive definition of the notion of “private life”. However, it would be too restrictive to limit the notion to an “inner circle” in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle. Respect for private life must also comprise to a certain degree the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings.\n\nThere appears, furthermore, to be no reason of principle why this understanding of the notion of “private life” should be taken to exclude activities of a professional or business nature since it is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant, if not the greatest, opportunity of developing relationships with the outside world. This view is supported by the fact that, as was rightly pointed out by the Commission, it is not always possible to distinguish clearly which of an individual’s activities form part of his professional or business life and which do not. Thus, especially in the case of a person exercising a liberal profession, his work in that context may form part and parcel of his life to such a degree that it becomes impossible to know in what capacity he is acting at a given moment of time.\n\nTo deny the protection of Article 8 (art. 8) on the ground that the measure complained of related only to professional activities – as the Government suggested should be done in the present case – could moreover lead to an inequality of treatment, in that such protection would remain available to a person whose professional and non-professional activities were so intermingled that there was no means of distinguishing between them. In fact, the Court has not heretofore drawn such distinctions: it concluded that there had been an interference with private life even where telephone tapping covered both business and private calls (see the Huvig v. France judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-B, p. 41, para. 8, and p. 52, para. 25); and, where a search was directed solely against business activities, it did not rely on that fact as a ground for excluding the applicability of Article 8 (art. 8) under the head of “private life” (see the Chappell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 March 1989, Series A no. 152-A, pp. 12-13, para. 26, and pp. 21-22, para. 51.)\n\nAs regards the word “home”, appearing in the English text of Article 8 (art. 8), the Court observes that in certain Contracting States, notably Germany (see paragraph 18 above), it has been accepted as extending to business premises. Such an interpretation is, moreover, fully consonant with the French text, since the word “domicile” has a broader connotation than the word “home” and may extend, for example, to a professional person’s office.\n\nIn this context also, it may not always be possible to draw precise distinctions, since activities which are related to a profession or business may well be conducted from a person’s private residence and activities which are not so related may well be carried on in an office or commercial premises. A narrow interpretation of the words “home” and “domicile” could therefore give rise to the same risk of inequality of treatment as a narrow interpretation of the notion of “private life” (see paragraph 29 above).\n\nMore generally, to interpret the words “private life” and “home” as including certain professional or business activities or premises would be consonant with the essential object and purpose of Article 8 (art. 8), namely to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities (see, for example, the Marckx v. Belgium judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 15, para. 31). Such an interpretation would not unduly hamper the Contracting States, for they would retain their entitlement to “interfere” to the extent permitted by paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2); that entitlement might well be more far-reaching wher"
