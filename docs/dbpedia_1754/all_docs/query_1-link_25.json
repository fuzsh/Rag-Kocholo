Prior to joining the Eck Institute, she was a Visiting Assistant Professor of Global Health in the Keough School of Global Affairs, University of Notre Dame. Dr. Adams was previously an Assistant Professor in the WellStar School of Nursing at Kennesaw State University. She received her PhD in Nursing Science from Michigan State University College of Nursing and her Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nAdams’ research addresses maternal health disparities that lead to mortality. More specifically, her research is dedicated to improving postpartum health outcomes among women most vulnerable to maternal mortality. She is highly motivated and passionate about using research interventions to improve maternal health, promote safe motherhood, and decrease maternal mortality and morbidity among vulnerable populations in the United States, and in Sub-Saharan Africa where the burden of maternal mortality is most severe. Her current research builds on her various experiences in maternal health research and her clinical experience as a mother/baby nurse. As PI and Co-I on multiple projects, she has experience conducting patient focused research examining both patient and healthcare facility factors that influence access to quality postpartum care and education.

Specifically, his research group leverages information regarding intra- and inter-specific variation in tree performance to understand and predict the past, present and future distribution of forest biodiversity. In pursuit of these research goals, the group follows two guiding principles. First, the team believes that the grand challenges facing scientists today require integrative approaches that draw from the concepts and techniques from many fields. The team achieves this within the lab by attempting to tackle problems from genomes to forest canopies. Second, the research approach necessitates the collection and analysis of large datasets that document the distribution and dynamics of plant species on a global-scale. These data allow the team to quantify the drivers of tree distributions and demography, which is an essential step for predicting the fate of individual species and forests in the future\n\nView Bio Page\n\nNick Swisher\n\nIDEA Center\n\nDirector, Marketing, Communications and Events\n\nnswisher@nd.edu\n\n372B Leighton And Quinn Halls\n\nNick Swisher was one of the four founders of the IDEA Center and currently serves as its first director of marketing, communications and events.\n\nPrior to joining the University of Notre Dame in 2017, Swisher worked in the same role for six years at the University of Utah's Technology Commercialization Office during the time when it was the top academic commercialization office in the United States.
