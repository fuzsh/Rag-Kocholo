        "text": "4. Discussion\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether number of traumatic events, perceived intensity of traumatic events or age at trauma exposure is more likely to be associated with HR mental states. To achieve this, the prevalence of past traumatic experiences and the constituent characteristics of those experiences were compared between samples of individuals at HR of developing psychosis and HVs.\n\nThe finding that HR participants had both a higher incidence of trauma and reported repeated exposure to trauma than HVs supports the possibility of an association between trauma and psychotic-like symptoms. Several studies have reported that repeated exposure/increasing frequency is linked to stronger associations with sub-clinical psychotic symptoms (de Loore et al., 2007, Arseneault et al., 2011) and transitions to psychosis (Read et al., 2005, Thompson et al., 2009, Bechdolf et al., 2010). Another alternative explanation for these findings could be the role of the HR׳s individual behaviour in the occurrence of traumatic events. Kendler et al. (1999) reported the association between stressful life events and onset of depression can be explained by individuals selecting themselves into high risk situations. In concurrence, Stein et al. (2002) proposed that individual differences in personality influence environmental choices. These genetic factors can increase an individual׳s risk of exposure to some forms of trauma. Therefore, it is possible that the HR individuals in this study were more likely to self-select a high risk environment.\n\nTraumatic events involving physical abuse with intention to harm accounted for the largest proportion of reported trauma for both groups and showed the largest differences between HV and HR participants. This supports previous conjecture that an element of threat, or a perception of threat, rather than the nature of the trauma (e.g., physical, sexual or emotional) could be more important in understanding any links between psychotic symptoms and trauma (Arseneault et al., 2011).\n\nIt is possible that this large difference can be explained by the conjecture that HR individuals are prone to paranoid thinking. Conversely, it has been suggested that beliefs about threat to the self can emerge as a response to interpersonal stress and trauma. Pre-existing negative beliefs about the self can combine with threatening appraisals of others resulting in anxiety. Feelings of threat and paranoia ensue leading to an increased likelihood of persecutory delusions (Freeman et al., 2002). Furthermore, anxiety has been shown to be predictive of the occurrence of paranoid thoughts (Freeman et al., 2008) and of the persistence of persecutory delusions (Startup et al., 2007). Indeed, Freeman and Fowler (2009) proposed that trauma influences persecutory thinking non-specifically via the creation of anxiety. This association between negative beliefs about self and others, anxiety and paranoia is supported by the high levels of anxiety in this study׳s HR group.\n\nAssociations between trauma and psychotic symptoms have also been found for emotional and physical trauma (Read et al., 2005), with more severe trauma (e.g. sexual) displaying the strongest associations (Read et al., 2005, Bechdolf et al., 2010, Thompson et al., 2014).\n\nConversely, in the present study, events involving sexual abuse were comparatively low for both groups: 16.6% in HR and 6.6% in HV. Two recent studies reported much higher rates of 27% and 28% in samples at clinical high risk for psychosis (Thompson et al., 2009, Bechdolf et al., 2010). This was particularly notable considering the age range of the participants in the present study was 10 years greater than these two studies. Indeed, Bechdolf et al. (2010) found that history of sexual trauma predicted conversion to psychotic disorder. Even longitudinal data from individuals at HR suggested a relationship between experience of sexual abuse and the medium-to-long term development of a psychotic disorder (Thompson et al., 2014). It could be argued that lack of sexual abuse in the present study may be an ameliorating factor against transition.\n\nResults showed that although HR participants experienced significantly more traumatic events than HVs, they did not report any more distress in relation to these events. Despite 60–70% of all individuals reporting distress in response to traumatic events, it is of note that, for both groups, 30–40% of traumatic experiences were not judged to be emotionally distressing. This was corroborated by the presence of only a single case of PTSD in the whole sample. An explanation of this finding is that because HR individuals are exposed to more recurrent traumatic events, they have become more desensitised to the impact and therefore, the threshold for distress associated with the events is reduced. This may go some way to explaining their greater risk of exposure. Another consideration is the possibility that the perceived intensity of trauma is a future predictor of psychopathology other than psychosis. This highlights the relevance of understanding the emotional impact of trauma on the subjective perceptions of the individual which can extend our understanding of why particular events cause traumatic stress in particular individuals.\n\nFirst incidents of trauma and total number of traumas occurred at earlier ages for HR participants and HR participants experienced significantly more traumas during the developmental period between the ages 0 and 8 years. To date, there has been no conclusive research identifying the most vulnerable developmental period for the risk-increasing effects of trauma (Wigman et al., 2012b) and previous studies have found that the cumulative effect of trauma during early to late childhood, rather than the timing, confers the highest risk for developing psychotic symptoms (Arseneault et al., 2011).\n\nA key finding of the current study was that both incidences of trauma and age at which trauma occurred were the most likely predictors of becoming HR, not the degree of distress reported as result of the trauma. Certainly, previous studies have consistently found strong associations with early childhood trauma and psychotic symptoms (Freeman and Fowler, 2009, Arseneault et al., 2011) and it has been suggested that this is because young children may lack the coping strategies needed to deal with the consequences of experiencing trauma (Arseneault et al., 2011). In this study the higher instances of trauma occurred between 9 and 24 years rather than 0 and 8 years. Also, the median age for first trauma was 9 and for all traumas 14. In light of previous findings, it is possible to interpret this lack of earlier trauma as another ameliorating factor against transition to full psychosis, although a longitudinal design would be necessary to substantiate this. Similarly, previous research revealed a high prevalence of trauma in patient cohorts with established psychotic disorder (Read et al., 2005) and in those at risk of developing psychosis (Thompson et al., 2014). Also, associations have been reported between numbers of traumatic events and clinically high risk samples in recent studies, reporting a 97% and 69.6% prevalence rate of at least one trauma (Thompson et al., 2009, Bechdolf et al., 2010), although incidence of successive trauma was not delineated in either of these studies. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the accumulation of trauma increases the risk to develop subclinical psychotic experiences in a dose–response fashion (de Loore et al., 2007). This seems to suggest that, in this study, regardless of the subjectively perceived distress as result of the trauma, both higher incidents of trauma and younger ages at trauma exposure increased the likelihood of being at HR. Higher ages for trauma exposure and lack of sexual abuse could be ameliorating factors for the HR individuals in this study.\n\nPrevious research has found the majority of help-seeking individuals at HR initially present with anxiety disorder or major depression (Velthorst et al., 2009, Addington et al., 2011, Wigman et al., 2012a, Hui et al., 2013) and the association of trauma and paranoia can be explained by levels of anxiety (Freeman and Fowler, 2009). The high levels of anxiety and depression found in our HR group replicate these findings. Combined with the very low transition rates to date, our low initial conversion rate adds credence to the argument that there is a lack of diagnostic specificity and predictive value in the HR model. Therefore, it is possible to speculate that a HR mental state is not a specific marker for psychosis. Supplement this with the prevalent co-presence of anxiety and depression in this group, it is feasible to consider that trauma may play a role in this manifestation of symptoms. Indeed, other authors (Spauwen et al., 2006) have also speculated that exposure to trauma may be a hidden factor explaining a substantial part of the morbidity associated with sub-clinical psychosis. This is especially pertinent in light of recent research that suggests the incidence of psychotic experiences decreases significantly when exposure to trauma ceases (Kelleher et al., 2013).\n\nThe low transition rates could be explained by the short follow up in this study. The risk for transition is highest in the first 2 years, but transitions can occur up to at least 10 years after presentation (Nelson et al., 2013). Alternatively, it is possible to consider the lack of transitions as an indicator that trauma is not a predictor of psychosis. Therefore, if traumatic experiences are considered as a non-specific marker of psychopathology, their consideration and assessment become paramount. As Carlson et al. (2013) emphasised, traumatic events may not directly cause symptoms, but may precipitate mental disorder in individuals who are vulnerable because of previous, existing or later biological, psychological or social factors. Conversely, a recent study looking at childhood adversity, including diverse events such as separation and abuse, concluded that the combination of childhood abuse and exposure to further stressors establishes an enduring susceptibility to psychosis (Morgan et al., 2014). This accentuates the importance of a detailed consideration of potentially traumatic life events during clinical assessment. The presence of these events combined with the subjective interpretation could be related to the experience of psychotic or psychotic-like phenomena.\n\nThere is debate around the events that are included in the measurement of trauma. McNally (2009) has expressed concern that including non-catastrophic events in trauma scales creates an excessively broad definition of a traumatic event, resulting in increased numbers of PTSD diagnoses based on exposure to relatively minor stressors. Shalev and Ursano (2003) contended that if traumatic stressors are only distinguished by perceived threat of injury or death, the essential nature of human traumatisation is lost. They argued that treat is not a necessary condition for being traumatised and elements such as separation, relocation, loss, isolation and uncertainty can be traumatising. Other authors agree, positing that the defining features of traumatic events are negative valence, lack of controllability and suddenness (Carlson and Dalenberg, 2000). Therefore, the authors of the THS maintain that also assessing events involving severe emotional loss or pain such as ‘sudden move or loss of home’ and ‘possessions and sudden abandonment by family or loved ones’ is valid. These events have been associated with posttraumatic symptoms as strongly as Criterion A stressors (Carlson et al., 2013, Van Hooff et al., 2009). Such experiences are common for refugees, survivors of natural disasters and war, and for children in low socioeconomic status families (Carlson et al., 2011). We felt that inclusion of these items in the present study was justified as HR cohorts can have comparable experiences.\n\nNotwithstanding the strengths of this study, the results must be interpreted in light of the following limitations. First, the healthy volunteers were statistically significantly older than the high risk participants and this might be interrelated with number of events or age of trauma. However, HR participants still had higher amounts of trauma at younger ages. It is possible that were the groups of a similar age, the differences would only have been greater between the two groups. To adjust for this, age at study entry was entered as a covariate in the logistic regression model. Second, our findings are based on self-report. It is possible that the HR mental state may lead to inaccuracy in the recall and reporting of traumatic experiences. Trauma was measured by the respondent׳s subjective information and not corroborated by independent information; therefore it was not possible to ascertain if trauma was under or overestimated. However, research has shown that even individuals with psychotic disorders can be as accurate in recalling traumatic experiences as a population sample (Kelleher et al., 2013). Conversely, confidential self-report produces twice the number of childhood traumas reported compared with a psychiatric interview (Dill et al., 1991). This indicates that including a combination of methods would yield the most accurate record of trauma. Third, only a crude, one-item measure of distress was used in this study. Future research should include a valid measure to elucidate any relationships between distress, trauma, anxiety and psychotic experiences/symptoms. Fourth, although the THS (Carlson et al., 2011) does examine trauma involving physical abuse as a child and events that induce feelings of fear, helplessness and horror there is no specific question concerning bullying. It is possible that a large proportion of traumatic experiences were missed due to this omission; particularly as research has found an elevated risk for psychosis among bullied children (Arseneault et al., 2011, Addington et al., 2013). Fifth, the study is cross-sectional; without further longitudinal data it is not possible to fully ascertain particular trauma characteristics as predictors of conversion to psychosis or as a contributing factor to HR mental states. Finally, there was no clear definition between the measurement of actual trauma and stressful life events. This may account for the high prevalence of reported trauma in our sample. However, an objective of the THS is to provide substantial information about exposure to potentially traumatic stressors and responses to stressors. Furthermore, we considered it important to include all events that individuals identified as traumatic, as the accumulation of these events may have an impact on the development of psychotic-like experiences as proposed by Morgan et al. (2014). Life stressors as well as true trauma are important considerations in developing psychopathology, irrespective of the character of the psychotic phenomenon.\n\nOur work adds to the literature concerning the understanding of trauma in HR mental states. It emphasises the clinical importance of thoroughly assessing trauma characteristics in individuals at clinical HR in order to enable differentiation between psychotic-like experiences that may reflect dissociative responses to trauma and genuine prodromal psychotic presentations. Subsequently, this will help understand the links between traumatic events, psychotic-like symptoms and other non-psychotic psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety."
