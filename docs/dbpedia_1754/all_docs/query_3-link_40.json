THE BACKGROUND TO THIS REPORT\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\n\nThis Report contains the Law Reform Commission's final recommendations with respect to privacy in the specific context of surveillance and the interception of communications. This Report does not cover the entire sweep of privacy but focuses on one discrete aspect, namely the invasion of privacy through surveillance and interception. While this Report covers in a general way the privacy problem posed by surveillance in all contexts it does not address the peculiarities that may arise in highly specific contexts such as employment, healthcare and the prison system. These areas pose additional and discrete problems best addressed /separately and later.\n\n1.2\n\nThis Report should be read against the backdrop of the extensive comparative research and provisional recommendations contained in our Consultation Paper on the subject which was issued in September 19962. What that research revealed above all else was the growing nature of the problem of surveillance in contemporary society, the inadequacy of existing law and a trend toward the adoption of legislative solutions3.\n\n1.3\n\nPrivacy is listed as one of the Commission's main areas of review in its Programme of Work4and this Report should therefore be seen as one element of work under that Programme on the general privacy issue.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=1\n\n1.4\n\nIn brief, our core recommendation is for the enactment of a civil tort directed against acts of privacy-invasive surveillance in circumstances where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists. We also make another recommendation for the enactment of a new but related civil tort of harassment. These torts would be directed to infringements of the privacy of natural (i.e. human) persons, not of bodies corporate, though (as pointed out by the European Court of Human Rights) this does not mean that infringements of the privacy of natural persons cannot occur in a corporate setting.\n\n1.5\n\nOur main ancillary recommendation is for the enactment of a related civil tort directed against the unjustified disclosure through publication or otherwise of information, images, etc., obtained as a result of the tort of unlawful surveillance or harassment. This does not amount to a full privacy law as conventionally understood  a prohibition on the publication of all manner of private material. Rather, the ambit of our ancillary recommendation builds on our main recommendation which is aimed at surveillance and interception. We make provision for a public interest defence to the tort of disclosure of information obtained as a result of unlawful surveillance.\n\n1.6\n\nWith respect to criminal law we recommend that sanctions should be limited and confined to the most outrageous forms of intrusion in circumstances where the expectation of privacy is at its highest (in a dwelling) or where the activity in question is inherently private (e.g. private conversations), with supplementary prohibition of disclosure of information obtained by means of infringements of these provisions. Consistent with these recommendations we also propose an offence of trespass on private property effected for the purpose of obtaining personal information.\n\n1.7\n\nLastly we make several specific recommendations with respect to regulatory safeguards in the context of certain types of surveillance of both public and private places conducted by the Gardaí and certain types of self-protective surveillance by owners or occupiers of premises, and other miscellaneous technical matters including the amendment of existing legislation.\n\n1.8\n\nTo facilitate understanding of our recommendations we provide in Chapter 10 a detailed draft Heads of Bill setting out the new statutory torts and criminal sanctions we envisage together with explanatory notes for the Heads.\n\n1. Why Privacy is Worthy of Legal Protection in a Democratic Society\n\n1.9\n\nWhy is privacy so important? The distinctive feature of this Report is that it is animated throughout by a human rights approach to privacy. Privacy is not merely instrumental5 to the achievement of other goals but is a basic human right that applies to all persons in virtue of their status as human beings.\n\n5\n\nSee generally Charles Fried, Privacy, 77 Yale L.J. 475 (1968).\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=2\n\nIt is not possible to overstate just how fundamental privacy is in a developed and civilised legal system. A sense of its importance can be gleaned by rehearsing briefly some of the many important overlapping values that are served by it6.\n\n1.10\n\nFirst, privacy is closely connected to notions of inherent human dignity. The intimacies of private life go to the very core of what it means to be human. Privacy is therefore worthwhile in itself in protecting human personality or the inherent dignity of the person7. This is reflected in what the European Court of Human Rights refers to as the physical and moral integrity8 of the person.\n\n1.11\n\nSecondly, privacy is closely related to human freedom, autonomy and self-determination. Privacy provides vital space for personal growth and development and for the exercise of freedom. Human beings are not means to the ends of others but are ends in themselves and are free to choose their own goals in life. Self-determination means, in part, the freedom to select which aspects of one's personality should be shared with others and on what terms. Central to autonomy and the selection of personal life-choices is freedom from coercion and manipulation and the preservation of space for emotional release, self-evaluation and growth. This explains why privacy is so closely connected to the protection of human personality found in many constitutions including that of Germany. As the European Commission on Human Rights expressed this point:\n\n1.12\n\nThe pursuit of private goals will often involve the formation of voluntary relations with others of varying degrees of intimacy. As the European Commission pointed out, privacy therefore entails the right to establish and to develop relationships with other human beings, especially in the emotional field for the development and fulfilment of one's own personality10. Another way of looking at this is that privacy is necessary to give efficacy to the exercise of many different liberty interests including freedom of association.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=3\n\n1.13\n\nThirdly, privacy is much more than a tool for protecting the seclusion of the individual. It is an organising principle of civil society11. Although man is a social animal and not a hermit, an orderly civil society is itself impossible without some sanctuaries away from everyday life. Privacy is at the heart of the implicit social contract in every society by which the terms of peaceful co-existence are set12. In short, privacy entails much more than the protection of the person in seclusion; it is a way or organising society.\n\n1.14\n\nFourthly, privacy is closely connected to the democratic life of the polity. This is so in at least two senses. First, democratic theory itself points strongly to the need for personal space. This is so because democracy rests on  and is bounded by  the dignity and equal inherent self-worth of all human beings. Democracy is not merely a process but also a value system. Secondly, an assurance of some secluded space away from public gaze is necessary to provide reassurance to those who have a contribution to make and who wish to enter public life.\n\n1.15\n\nPrivacy is important for all these reasons and is therefore indispensable to the full flourishing of the human personality in a free society. We stress that while personal space is at its most visible in private places or on private property, it is not premised on, nor is it limited to, conceptions of property. Indeed, the chief deficiency of much existing law is that it tends to protect privacy  if at all  through property and through legal tools that protect property interests. Considering the values honoured by privacy, as set out above, one may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in many different contexts. It follows, in our view, that there may well be a residuum of privacy or a reasonable expectation of privacy even in a public place. This view accords with the overall approach being adopted by the European Commission and Court of Human Rights in interpreting Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights13.\n\n1.16\n\nSince privacy is so deeply connected to the inner sanctum of the person its violation can inflict deep and raw wounds and leave lasting damage. Intrusion into personal space can often be fairly characterised as a violation of the person. Furthermore  and due to the value and role of privacy in an orderly civil and democratic society  one person's loss of privacy is almost always of some broader social significance. In an important sense, one person's loss is every person's loss since it tears away at the terms of peaceful co-existence in society. Cumulatively such losses jeopardise every person's privacy and cannot be long ignored in democratic society.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=4\n\n2. The Dangers Posed by New Technology\n\n1.17\n\nDoes surveillance pose a threat to privacy and, if so, how grave is the threat today? We believe that there is a privacy problem arising out of surveillance and that it is grave enough to warrant a legislative response. Two factors explain why there is a privacy problem in this regard today in Ireland:\n\n1.18\n\nSuch an information-gathering interest may range from the perfectly legitimate (e.g., prevention and detection of crime by the Gardaí) to the utterly depraved (e.g., voyeurism) with many shades of grey in between.\n\n1.19\n\nThe technological breakthroughs have been spectacular. It is surprising if not shocking to learn of the ease with which this technology can pry open personal space which may previously have been considered safe. Specific examples of listening and optical surveillance devices which are generally available were listed by the Australian Law Commission as long ago as 1983. The gravity of surveillance as a threat to personal privacy in today's world can be understood from considering the following list:\n\n1.20\n\nIndeed, the range and sophistication of technological devices which can be used for surveillance purposes have increased substantially since the Australian Law Reform Commission studied the topic of privacy, and technological innovation continues at an amazing rate. We pointed this out in our Consultation Paper and gave the following examples of recently developed surveillance devices:\n\n1.21\n\nMore recently, surveillance technology is reportedly being developed using systems that can operate outside the visible light spectrum, such as:\n\n1.22\n\nThe next development in the technology will reportedly involve the development of an interactive link between surveillance technology and computerised data banks (CCTV surveillance networks). This will potentially allow for automatic tracking of the movements of individuals.17 Technology is\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=6\n\nalready available to broadcast the footage generated by CCTV systems over the internet.18\n\n1.23\n\nAn enormous range of devices with extraordinary potential for intrusiveness (including for example a video camera in the form of a shower head) is now available cheaply by mail order over the internet,19 and there is a corresponding market in anti-surveillance devices similarly available. We allude in this Report20 to copious accounts in the newspapers that sophisticated surveillance technology is being used in Ireland.\n\n1.24\n\nAt the same time that this technological revolution is taking place, Ireland is, in common with most other countries, making the transition to the Information Society. In such societies information is the key to wealth and power. Surveillance is nearly always (though not invariably) done for a purpose and that purpose is usually connected to the collection of information, images and other material. It is not relevant here whether the information, etc., is subject to automatic processing within the meaning of data protection legislation. What is at issue is the growing demand for information which in turn generates a demand for further and better methods of acquiring such information through, inter alia, surveillance. The subsequent use of the information (whether legitimate or otherwise) is separate from the phenomenon of a seemingly growing demand to pierce the veil of privacy to obtain that information in the first place.\n\n3. The Inadequacy of Existing Irish Law\n\n1.25\n\nThe issue of the inadequacy of existing Irish law is explored in detail in Chapter 3.\n\n1.26\n\nA growing public concern in most countries, including Ireland, at the lack of comprehensive or effective legal protection in this area was noted by us in our First Programme for law reform. Many countries, including Ireland, have a web of laws that protect isolated aspects of privacy. A few countries, mainly European, have tailor-made privacy laws that adequately protect privacy in the round and directly. The subject has already been looked at by a variety of law reform bodies throughout the world and continues to attract much attention.\n\n1.27\n\nDue to its very nature, surveillance is as unobtrusive as it is intrusive. Even where the victim happens to detect the use of surveillance there is often nothing he/she can do in law. Existing law provides little opportunity for full or effective redress. It is highly unlikely that most individuals would be able to\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=7\n\ndetect the occurrence of surveillance unless the fruit of the surveillance is used openly against them. Even where private information that has been obtained as a result of, or by means of, surveillance, is published the individual in question has little incentive to come forward and complain since to do so might compound his/her embarrassment at the revelation of true (but private) information.\n\n1.28\n\nMoreover, even where the purposes for using surveillance are perfectly legitimate (surveillance cameras mounted by the police in semi-public or public thoroughfares for the purposes of prevention and detection of crime) there exists no specific legislative or regulatory regime providing safeguards against abuse and assurances to the public at large.\n\n1.29\n\nCan existing Irish law cope adequately with the privacy problems associated with the threat to personal space posed by surveillance? We believe that it cannot.\n\n1.30\n\nTo grasp the inadequacy of existing law it is necessary to keep in mind the high human values honoured by privacy. It is also necessary to realise that there are different  but intimately related  aspects of privacy which are the subject of protective measures in the legal system. This is quite apart from the authority of the protective norm in question, e.g., treaty law, Constitutional law, common law, statutory law. No overall or integrated doctrine has yet emerged to unify these three aspects. The human rights vision helps us identify the deficiencies of these fields both in isolation and as they relate to one another.\n\n1.31\n\nAlthough, as we indicate in Chapter 3 below, the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court recognises a right of privacy, the content and boundaries of that right remain unclear and in the absence of legislation are dependent for their future development on the fortunes of case law. Among other things, case law depends to a considerable extent on the involvement of persons who can afford to bring (or defend) cases. This cannot meet the immediate need for a clear statement of the rights and obligations of citizens as a whole in circumstances where, in our view, the right of privacy is under an actual and present threat.\n\n1.32\n\nThe amalgam of common law doctrines that constitute the privacy shield/s (e.g., trespass, nuisance) was historically constructed to protect privacy in the context of property and in the enjoyment of property. This was usefully labelled territorial privacy by a Canadian Task Force in the 1970s21. There are several problems connected with territorial privacy problems or deficiencies that give rise to the need for comprehensive legislation. These along with other aspects of the law of tort which incidentally bear on the right of privacy are listed in Chapter 3 below. It is clear that they do not meet the present-day need for protection of privacy from surveillance and disclosure or publication of private information obtained thereby.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=8\n\n1.33\n\nCurrent Irish law does offer some piecemeal protection for personal information. This chiefly occurs in the areas of data protection law22; rights of anonymity in certain criminal proceedings23, in family matters24 and in matters connected with personal taxation25; the legal or equitable doctrine of confidence26; and freedom of information legislation27. There is, however, no overall protection of private information under Irish law at present. There is, in short, no tailor-made privacy tort with which to prevent the publication of private information.\n\n1.34\n\nInformation privacy is not, however, the core focus of this Report. Most acts of surveillance will be targeted at information. Sometimes that information will be of a private nature and sometimes not. Either way, surveillance carried out with a view to the accessing of that information prima facie entails a breach of the privacy shield and this is our core focus in this Report. Only to the extent that the information so extracted is private in its nature is there an overlap between information privacy and the focus of this Report.\n\n1.35\n\nThe privacy shield which we propose to protect in this Report is essentially information-insensitive. What is important in the concept of a privacy shield is that a person has a right to be protected against intrusion into his/her private space whenever he/she has a reasonable expectation of privacy irrespective of whether such intrusion actually results in the obtaining of private information (or indeed any information) about the person intruded upon.\n\n1.36\n\nAs the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales states in its Issues Paper on Surveillance:\n\nIntrusion upon one's house is a prime example, but the unjustified and systematic surveillance or surreptitious watching of a person even in public would be another.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=9\n\n4. The Need for Law Reform\n\n1.37\n\nThe issue of the need for law reform is explored in detail in Chapter 4.\n\n1.38\n\nAfter much comparative research and after the benefit of submissions29 on our Consultation Paper on this subject as well as an extremely useful listening exercise30 involving all those who made submissions and many other interested parties, we now recommend the introduction of legislative protections for privacy in Ireland in the specific context of surveillance and the interception of communications. The real question, in our view, is not whether privacy as a human right is deserving of protection through the legal system but how other competing rights and interests can be appropriately accommodated. We are confident that our specific recommendations will, if enacted, adequately respect the competing interests and rights at stake.\n\n1.39\n\nOur main concern is to craft recommendations aimed at perfecting the privacy shield and making it play a more visibly direct and effective role in protecting privacy in the context of the threats posed by surveillance.\n\n1.40\n\nWe believe that we demonstrate in this Report that there are three general reasons why this is an area appropriate for law reform.\n\n1.41\n\nFirst, and not least, as already stated, privacy is under a constant and growing threat especially from new technology. The threat did not originate in technology but the introduction of high technology makes its resolution all the more urgent.\n\n1.42\n\nSecond, established legal doctrine, which only indirectly protects privacy, can no longer cope or keep up with these developments. The legal regulation of telecommunications and the absence of comparable legal regulation governing other forms of surveillance creates an unjustifiable imbalance in the protective coverage of the law. Nor is it safe to simply assume that time-honoured boundaries will be respected and that this technology will not be used in a privacy-invasive manner or with privacy-invasive effects.\n\n1.43\n\nThird, the theoretical possibility of a constitutional action is no substitute, we feel, for adequate legislative provision. As stated in paragraph 3.25 of our Consultation Paper and further emphasised both above and in Chapter 3 below, although it is now established by case law that the personal rights of the citizen guaranteed by Article 40.3.1° of the Constitution include a right to privacy, the scope and content of this right are as yet ill-defined and require further and much more specific development if there is to be an effective and clear privacy law available to citizens.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=10\n\n1.44\n\nSimilarly, though the genius of the common law lies in its capacity for organic growth and renewal, reliance on the courts to reform the existing patchwork quilt constituted by the relevant common law is not, in our view, a satisfactory way to proceed.\n\n1.45\n\nIt must also be remembered that privacy is qualitatively different from many other legitimate goals of State policy. It is not merely a desirable objective in any civilised society but is also a basic human right. It is protected in principle not merely under the Constitution but also under various international human rights treaties to which Ireland is a party including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Ireland's primary obligation under that Convention is to secure the rights protected under that Convention for everyone (Article 1 ECHR). Taking rights seriously entails a comprehensive evaluation of the capacity of the legal system to provide practical protections and remedies. Such analysis reveals that privacy is inadequately protected in Ireland at the moment against the growing threat posed by surveillance and interception activities. Our view, which is outlined in chapter 5, is that the legislation we propose would be well within Ireland's margin of appreciation under that Convention.\n\n1.46\n\nWe are not opposed in principle to effective schemes of self-regulation. Quite the reverse. We, of course, warmly welcome the introduction of voluntary codes of practice and the evolution of self-regulation in broadcasting and the mass media. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission was set up pursuant to the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976 and RTÉ has its own Code of Practice adopted pursuant to the Broadcasting Acts. The latest example of this laudatory trend is the Code of Practice on Privacy adopted by the National News Papers of Ireland in 1997. Indeed, we strongly encourage more self-regulation particularly in the private investigators' industry where nationwide self-regulation has been lacking until now. Our view is that the enactment of appropriate legislation does not mean that private actors cannot or should not regulate their own activities. We do not view appropriate mechanisms of self-regulation and the enactment of legislation as mutually exclusive. Rather, we see self-regulation and legislation of the type we recommend as mutually reinforcing. Self-regulation could be made work best, in our view, if developed under and directed towards fulfilling the requirements of legislation that reassures the public by the provision of judicially enforceable protections.\n\n1.47\n\nIn the last analysis, self-regulation  no matter how commendable and necessary  cannot be a substitute for legally enforceable rights which can only be provided for by legislation. The ultimate arbiters of issues concerning the infringement of the citizen's right of privacy must be, and can only be, the courts.\n\n1.48\n\nIn our view the provision of civil remedies must be supplemented by the enactment of appropriate criminal sanctions. The criminal law provides the vital element of deterrence and ensures that the Gardai have a role in clearly defined circumstances. Naturally, different considerations of a qualitative kind arise in the context of the criminal law where a much sharper focus on particularly\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=11\n\negregious acts of intrusion is required. We have taken great care in this regard to confine criminal sanctions to the minimum and to define the constituent elements of the proposed new offences with added particularity and clarity.\n\n1.49\n\nDifferent considerations again arise in the context of regulatory safeguards where it is safe to assume the legitimacy of some surveillance activities but necessary to consider the introduction of protections against abuse.\n\nB. OVERVIEW OF REPORT\n\n5. Objective  Protecting Reasonable Expectations of Privacy against Surveillance\n\n1.50\n\nOur understanding of a reasonable expectation of privacy is set out in detail in Chapter 2 below.\n\n1.51\n\nThere are many different variables to be taken into account in determining whether an invasion of privacy has occurred through surveillance and what form the appropriate legal or regulatory response should take. The surveillance may be overt or covert. The place under surveillance may be private or public. The technique of surveillance may be aural or visual. The category of user varies greatly as does the degree of legitimacy of the interest in engaging in surveillance.\n\n1.52\n\nThe law must acknowledge all these variables and allow in particular as much space for the pursuit of legitimate interests as is compatible with respect for the right of privacy. This requires flexibility of the law as well as adequate procedural safeguards. Apart from aural interception, privacy interests do not presently figure prominently in regulating the use and manner of use of the full range of surveillance techniques in Ireland. In introducing privacy into the overall equation we emphasise that what we seek to advance and protect is what the ordinary man on the street would consider to be a reasonable expectation of privacy. Naturally, everyday living exposes all of us to varying and generally acceptable levels of being observed. Such ordinary and natural incidences of everyday living including, for example, tourist or recreational photography, are not materially affected by our recommendations. We explain below and particularly in chapter 2 what we mean by a reasonable expectation of privacy and the kinds of indicators that we consider to be relevant in determining whether such expectation arises on the facts of any given case.\n\n1.53\n\nOur approach in protecting reasonable expectations of privacy navigates between more extreme approaches exemplified in the laws of other countries. On the one hand there is the stringent protection of privacy in a civil law country\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=12\n\nsuch as Germany, and on the other hand there is the more relaxed approach seen in U.S. law.31\n\n6. Privacy and the Public Interest, Including Freedom of Expression\n\n1.54\n\nOur understanding of the public interest and the public interest defence is set out in detail in Chapter 2 below.\n\n1.55\n\nBringing privacy to the fore of legal consciousness does not, of course, mean ignoring other human rights that may come into play. Privacy is a way of organising human co-existence; it does not deny such co-existence. It is a relational right whose boundaries depend in part on perceptions and judgments about the right relations between people.\n\n1.56\n\nThe boundary to privacy is particularly problematic when it comes to the competing right of freedom of expression. In providing for the possibility of balancing privacy with other rights we are particularly aware that many of these rights can have a value both for the individual and for more generalisable social interests. Freedom of expression is obviously one such competing right.32 It enables the press to perform a vital watchdog role in democratic society. It honours what is commonly referred to nowadays as the people's right to know certain information. The public interest involved here is obviously and powerfully present in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights which sets very demanding standards in the area of media liability. These standards are generally much higher than those set under Irish law.\n\n1.57\n\nA pattern is, however emerging whereby Irish statutory law and constitutional interpretation is moving towards an acknowledgement that the public has a right to information in some cases. For example, the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 protects against the disclosure of personal or private information. That protection can, however, be overridden if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in secrecy (Section 28(5)). It is of interest that the Irish law of confidence has been interpreted by the Supreme Court in the sensitive sphere of banking to yield where there is a clear public interest in the disclosure by the media of allegations of serious misconduct to the public at large.33 Furthermore, the people's right to know certain information is evident in a recent decision of the Supreme Court which upheld media\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=13\n\npublicity connected with an ongoing criminal trial and with the discretion of trial judges in controlling the same in the interests of the administration of justice.34\n\n1.58\n\nThe main question is not whether the public interest should be allowed as a reckonable factor in our Report but how. We believe that the tasks of protecting privacy and maintaining an open and vibrant marketplace of ideas are in fact mutually reinforcing although a clash between them is possible in some circumstances. We provide for this possibility by recommending a new public interest defence to disclosure through publication and otherwise when such results from privacy-invasive surveillance. We envisage a public interest arising in circumstances involving the detection or prevention of serious crime, the exposure of serious illegality or wrongdoing, the need to inform the public on a matter of public importance, and the need to prevent the public from being misled by public conduct (including statements) of a person having or seeking public office where the matter disclosed is relevant to the performance or capacity to perform the functions of that office. The sort of protection for privacy we envisage is not a haven for those who may seek to keep information from the public on matters where there is a clear public interest.\n\n1.59\n\nWe insist, however, that the public interest secured by the people's right to know a particular piece of information is not synonymous with whatever happens to interest the public. Mere newsworthiness is not a reliable proxy for the public interest. As stated succinctly by the Royal Commission on the Press in its Report of 1977 (the McGregor Report)35:\n\n1.60\n\nThe exposure of true facts does not, in our view, have any absolute value.37 We emphasise that respect for privacy and for the rule of law is as much in the public interest as is the people's right to know.\n\n1.66\n\nIt must be remembered that, in so far as our recommendations go to publication, they go to the publication of truthful information (whether private\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=14\n\nin its nature or otherwise) obtained by illegal means (i.e., contrary to the new statutory torts we propose) and not to the publication of truthful (but private) information simpliciter.\n\n7. The Conformity of Our Recommendations with the European Convention on Human Rights\n\n1.67\n\nIn our reflections and in our final Report we have taken great care to test our recommendations with Ireland's existing international obligations and especially those arising under the European Convention on Human Rights. Put simply, our view is that Article 8 of the European Convention which protects the right to respect for private life is at the very least permissive toward the kind of protective legislation we propose. Indeed it is plausible to read the case law under Article 8 as requiring Ireland to take positive measures to ensure that privacy is protected as between private parties. Furthermore we are confident that the legislation we propose, bearing in mind particularly the public interest defence we recommend with respect to wrongful publication, is quite compatible with Ireland's margin of appreciation under Article 10. This margin is expansive enough to allow contracting States to apprehend a pressing social problem with respect to privacy and to opt for legislation as an appropriate solution with the proviso that adequate space be left for a public interest defence. In short, we consider that our recommendations, suitably qualified by the public interest defence, would, if enacted, amount to an appropriate and proportionate response to the privacy problem thus apprehended and be fully compatible with the obligations of the State under the Convention.\n\n8. Privacy in the Global Village  The International Dimension\n\n1.68\n\nIn making our final recommendations we are painfully aware that Ireland is now firmly integrated within the Global Village. Our growing interdependence with the world  especially within the European Union but also beyond  is a complicating factor in the context of this Report.\n\n1.69\n\nFor one thing, this interdependence is reflected in the fact that a worldwide market now exists for surveillance technology. Furthermore, the ongoing process of economic deregulation has dispersed this technology widely into private hands with the result that traditional legal protections that focus almost exclusively on the State as the sole potential abuser miss a large part of their target. Non-State actors pose just as much a threat as the State itself. The demand for such technology by private actors seems set to grow and not diminish. Restricting this market using traditional tools like import controls, a licensing regime for vendors, a licensing regime for users, etc., is unwieldy and likely to be piecemeal and ineffective.\n\n1.70\n\nOur interdependence is also reflected in the fact that a secondary worldwide market also exists for private information which is being treated more\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=15\n\nand more as a commodity. The demand for such information, whether obtained through surveillance or otherwise, is quite varied and is only likely to grow as Ireland becomes, in common with other countries, a knowledge-based Information Society and economy.\n\n1.71\n\nThe Irish market is not therefore an isolated one. Solutions to the problems of privacy, especially since the market for surveillance devices and indeed the market for private information is global, should ideally take a multilateral form. Indeed the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has itself recently called for the drafting of a detailed convention on privacy38. The Motion for a Resolution calling for the drafting of a privacy convention was referred to the Parliamentary Assembly's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights for a report. The rapporteur to that committee (Mr Schwimmer) convened an open hearing on the topic in December 1997 and issued his report in June 199839. The rapporteur rejected the argument for a new convention on the basis that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights is satisfactory and on the assumption that national law either already is, or ought to become, sufficient in itself to handle the matter. He proposed instead that a draft resolution should be presented to the Parliamentary Assembly calling on those governments that have not yet done so to pass legislation guaranteeing the right to privacy.\n\n172.\n\nThe Schwimmer report was debated in the Parliamentary Assembly on 26 June 1998 and a resolution on the Right to Privacy was duly adopted40. The final resolution mirrors and indeed strengthens the draft put forward by Mr Schwimmers. It rejects the call for a privacy convention for the same reasons outlined by Mr Schwimmer (i.e., adequacy of Article 8 and the existence of effective national legislation)41. With respect to those Member States that do not yet have privacy-specific legislation the resolution calls the introduction by those states of such legislation along certain guidelines provided (see para. 1.74 below)42. This would include Ireland.\n\n173.\n\nAmong the more notable features of the resolution are the following. First, the resolution acknowledges that personal privacy is often invaded even in countries with specific legislation to protect it since people's private lives have\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=16\n\nbecome a highly lucrative commodity for certain sectors of the media43. Secondly, the resolution notes that public figures must recognise that the role they play in public life automatically entails increased pressure on their privacy44. This is not, however, the same as stating that the private lives of public figures are an open book. Thirdly, the resolution defines public figures generally to include those who play a role in public life, whether in politics, the economy, the arts, the social sphere, sport or any other domain45. Fourthly, the resolution asserts that [i]t is in the name of a one-sided interpretation of the right of freedom of expression...[under Article 10]..that the media invade people's privacy, claiming that their readers are entitled to know everything about public figures46. Fifthly, the resolution concedes that the public has a right to know certain things about the private lives of public figures which therefore calls for a careful balancing of privacy and freedom of expression47. Sixthly, the resolution asserts that the two rights in question (privacy and freedom of expression) are neither absolute nor in any hierarchical order, since they are of equal value48.\n\n174.\n\nThe resolution calls for privacy-specific legislation where none exists (or the supplementation of existing legislation) along the following lines (para. 14);\n\n1.75\n\nFurthermore, the resolution calls on the Governments of the Member States to encourage professional bodies to draw up standards for entry into the profession as well as standards for self-regulation and a code of journalistic conduct, to foster the development of media education, and to facilitate access to the courts and simplify the legal procedures relating to press offences in order to ensure that the rights of victims are better protected (para 16).\n\n1.76\n\nWhile this resolution is not legally binding it does have significant moral authority since it was adopted under the authority of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe which represents some 40 European countries. The approach taken in the resolution strongly reinforces our own analysis of the need for legislation and for the kind of legislation required. The full text of the resolution is reproduced in annex V.\n\n1.77\n\nWe are strongly of the view that we cannot and should not wait for multilateral action to take place before taking steps in the right direction under domestic law. In recognition of the cross-border nature of the market for private information we do make a specific recommendation dealing with civil liability for disclosure through publication or otherwise in Ireland of private material obtained overseas by methods which, if employed in Ireland, would be contrary to our recommended tort of privacy-invasive surveillance.\n\n9. Overview of Recommendations\n\n1.78\n\nConcerning terminology in this Report, we use the generic term surveillance to include aural and visual surveillance, irrespective of the means employed, and the interception of communication. The concept of surveillance implies in its ordinary usage some form of watching, spying, eavesdropping, besetting or following a person about for the purpose of invading that person's privacy, whether by means of technical devices or not, including listening to or recording a conversation or message to or from a person, otherwise than as a lawful party thereto.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=18\n\n1.79\n\nIn addition to this, we propose that two particular forms of privacy-intrusive behaviour which may not strictly speaking fall within the everyday meaning of surveillance should be included within the meaning of that term for the purposes of our recommendations on the civil side in this Report. These are the act known as participant monitoring in which one party to a message or conversation records the message or conversation in whole or in part without the knowledge of another party thereto; and third party monitoring in which a person not a party to a message or conversation records that message or conversation in whole or in part with the agreement of one party thereto but without the knowledge of another. Both of these acts are to be regarded in our view as involving privacy-invasive surveillance of the unknowing party.\n\n1.80\n\nOur main recommendations can be summarised as follows:\n\n10. Outline of Report\n\n1.81\n\nThe remainder of this Report is divided into three Parts as follows.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=22\n\n1.82\n\nThere are seven annexes to this Report:\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=23\n\nPART I  GENERAL\n\nCHAPTER 2: WHAT WE MEAN BY PRIVACY AND WHAT WE MEAN BY THE PUBLIC INTEREST\n\nA. WHAT WE MEAN BY PRIVACY\n\n1. General\n\n2.1\n\nAs stated in our Consultation Paper, privacy as a concept includes a wide range of personal interests or claims which place limits on the right of society and of its members to acquire knowledge of, and to take action regarding, another person. At its core lies the desire of the individual to maintain control over information, possessions and conduct of a personal kind, and, as a corollary, to deny or control access thereto by others. As such, it is now universally recognized as a human right, and is to be distinguished from other interests such as secrecy and confidentiality.\n\n2.2\n\nSuch definitions of privacy as have been attempted tend not to be all embracing; yet one such definition which refers to privacy as the right to be left alone1 strikes a common chord with the particular aspects of privacy which we consider in this Report: freedom from privacy-invasive surveillance (including the interception of communication) and harassment, with the concomitant protection against the publication of material obtained by means or as a result of such surveillance or harassment.\n\n2.3\n\nThe meaning and scope of privacy as a legal concept has received attention in other jurisdictions. In particular, in the early 1970s a Canadian Task Force identified three categories of claims to privacy:\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=24\n\n2.4\n\nSignificantly, the Australian Law Reform Commission in its research on privacy added a fourth category:\n\n2.5\n\nThis category of privacy however is not separate from those identified by the Canadian Task Force; it is connected with and is indeed a particular aspect or segment of all three of the latter. Thus, the category of privacy known as surveillance and communications privacy, which is the primary subject matter of this Report, is based on the idea of a legal shield or boundary, the penetration of which by outside persons is prohibited except under specific circumstances laid down by law, which protects the individual from privacy-invasive surveillance (and, as recommended in this report, harassment) in all of the spheres recognised by the Canadian Task Force. Moreover, an unlawful crossing of that boundary (e.g. by placing an electronic device in a person's home, by tapping his telephone or by systematically spying on his movements even in public places) may occur even though no private or intimate information is in fact obtained as a result.3\n\n2.6\n\nThe right not to be harassed is more specific than the right of privacy and is more easily capable of statutory definition than the latter. Harassment and privacy-invasive surveillance can go hand in hand and accordingly, harassment, though conceptually distinct from surveillance, is covered by the recommendations in this Report. In the remainder of this Chapter, however, which is concerned with the meaning and scope of the concept of privacy, especially in the context of surveillance, harassment is not expressly mentioned, but references to surveillance may be taken to include harassment where appropriate.\n\n2.7\n\nThe particular area of the law of privacy known as the law of confidences, or confidentiality, is not within the scope of this Report. The law of confidentiality applies to information imparted within a relationship of confidentiality, expressed or implicit between two or more parties, such that the\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=25\n\nperson in whom trust or confidence is placed will infringe the obligations imposed by that relationship if he or she discloses the information to another without authority.\n\n2.8\n\nThe law of confidentiality is already covered to a considerable extent both at common law and in equity though it requires further clarification and development. The English law of confidence is showing signs of considerable development at the hands of the judiciary and there is even English authority to suggest that it may be extended so as to cover at least some cases of disclosure of information obtained by surreptitious surveillance without any prior relationship of confidence (see Chapter 3 below). However, it differs in principle from the law concerning surveillance in that confidentiality assumes a specific relationship of trust between persons leading to an obligation of confidentiality whereas under our proposals, unlawful surveillance assumes no such relationships and may occur without any private or confidential information being obtained or conveyed by or to anyone.\n\n2.9\n\nIn this chapter we focus on what we mean by privacy and the circumstances under which a reasonable expectation of privacy against surveillance may arise. Later in this Report we outline the various factors that should be taken into account in determining whether surveillance that violates this reasonable expectation of privacy can be defended as legitimate.4\n\n2. Factors Relevant to a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy\n\n2.10\n\nThe existence and extent in the particular case of a right of privacy in the sense of freedom from privacy-invasive surveillance (for short, surveillance privacy) is an issue which is less cut-and-dried than is the case with some other human rights such as the right to private property or the right to vote. Surveillance privacy is one of those rights whose existence and extent will inevitably depend to a very high degree upon the circumstances of the case and will vary depending on these circumstances. A person's right to freedom from privacy-invasive surveillance may for the purposes of this Report be broadly defined as that freedom which a reasonable person in the circumstances of the case is entitled to expect.\n\n2.11\n\nSince we view privacy as a personal right and one that follows the personal space of the person it follows that a reasonable expectation of privacy may even exist in public places. The practical application of this concept is ultimately a matter for the courts in interpreting the legislation having regard to the relevant circumstances and to the accepted customs and mores of society at the relevant time. Nonetheless it is possible to identify a number of factors which in the view of the Law Reform Commission are, without being exhaustive, liable to be of particular relevance and assistance to citizens as well as to the courts in\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=26\n\ndeciding whether or not in the particular case a particular act is an illicit invasion of a person's right to such privacy.\n\n2.12\n\nThe factors which, among such others as the courts may consider appropriate, should in our view be considered by the courts in deciding whether the privacy shield has been breached, are as follows:\n\n(a) Place\n\n2.13\n\nThe place of surveillance: the home or private premises as against public places\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=27\n\n(b) Object\n\n2.14\n\nThe object or occasion of the surveillance: intimate or private life as against the commonplace or banal\n\n(c) Use\n\n2.15\n\nThe use to which material obtained by surveillance is to be put: intended publication or other use which may be objectionable to the subject, as against innocuous use\n\n(d) Means\n\n2.16\n\nThe means of surveillance used: the naked eye or natural hearing as against high technology\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=28\n\n(e) Status\n\n2.17\n\nThe status or function of the person subjected to surveillance: public as compared to private persons\n\nPeople who are in the public eye (especially where they have placed themselves in the public eye by their own volition, such as politicians running for election, pop stars or other celebrities) cannot have the same reasonable expectation of privacy, and a corresponding level of immunity from surveillance, as the ordinary citizen.\n\nYet even their status in the public eye does not mean that they have no privacy rights. Even public persons enjoy the right to privacy in respect of the intimate details of their private lives  a right they do not abandon upon entering public life.\n\nWe navigate between two extreme views as to the effect of the status of the person on the level of reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nOn one view  a view that is loosely characterised as representing the US approach  the fact that a person may have a public persona is sufficient in itself in rendering practically every aspect of that person's life open to scrutiny. Even though only one aspect of that person's persona may protrude into the public side of the public/private line, every aspect of his persona follows. That being so, there is no logical limit to the power to lay bare the secrets of a private life since, by definition, nothing is private any longer.\n\nOn another view  a view that is loosely characterised as representing the German approach  certain aspects of a person's private life are always deemed off limits to scrutiny even though the matter in question may, for example, go directly to the functioning or capacity of a public person to hold public office, or may (for example in the case of a secret entry in a person's private diary containing a confession of a crime) be directly relevant to the enforcement of the criminal law against that person.\n\nThe first approach suffers from the defect that it is insufficiently sensitive to the extent to which it is possible (indeed desirable) to be both private and public at the same time. On this approach, since a person's life is either completely public or completely private there is little room for discernment between private matters that go to a person's public persona and other private matters that do not. As a matter of human psychology it may well be difficult to divide a person's life into two fixed realms of public and private. But as a matter of ethics and law such a division is imperative. Furthermore  and equally important  attractive though the so-called American approach may seem in some cases, it tends to lead to a situation in which there is a free for all right of media intrusion into the private lives of public persons, on the view\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=29\n\nthat the people are entitled to know everything about their actual or prospective leaders, with the lowest common denominator in terms of media standards becoming the norm, and the law becoming the law of the jungle. We are of the view that this ought to be unacceptable in a civilised society.\n\nThe second approach suffers from the opposite defect that some private matters are never acknowledged to go to a person's public persona when in fact they do.\n\nWe steer a middle course between these two extremes. We reject the view that once a person can be characterised as public that he or she loses all legitimate expectations of privacy. The public/private line may be blurred in such cases but it is still there. We similarly reject an overly rigid view of the public/private line  one that would not allow for the possibility that purely private matter may, on occasion, be of relevance to a person's persona or function. It follows that a person's public status will affect  but not destroy  his/her legitimate expectation of privacy. As will be seen later in Chapter 8 we seek to reflect the fluidity that must perforce exist on the borderline between public and private in a public interest defence to wrongful publication. Lying at the heart of the defence is a recognition that some (but certainly not all) private matter may be of some (but not unlimited) relevance in the public sphere.\n\n(f) Consent\n\n2.18\n\nAny previous conduct by the person subjected to surveillance indicating encouragement of interest by others in his or her private life, or amounting to a partial waiver of his or her right to privacy\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=30\n\n(g) Relationships\n\n2.19\n\nThe relationship(s) between the parties\n\n3. The Non-Exhaustive Nature of the Indicators\n\n2.20\n\nBetween the opposite ends of the various scales of circumstances and factors, some of which are indicated above, which are relevant to the existence and extent of the right to be free from privacy-invasive surveillance, there are a great number of possible cases and combinations of circumstances which in the last analysis require the assessment of the courts. This should, if our recommendations are enacted into law, result in the building up over time of a body of jurisprudence which, within the framework of the legislation, would define by reference to actual cases the limits and conditions of the right to be free from privacy-invasive surveillance. It would be neither possible nor desirable to attempt to lay down rigid or exhaustive legal rules for this purpose in the legislation itself.\n\n2.21\n\nThe impossibility of a specific, fully defined, all-embracing statutory definition of the right of surveillance privacy (and of the factors which may override that right which are dealt with later in this Report), which would provide a slide rule for liability in every case, does not however constitute a flaw in our recommendations (it has not been considered a flaw other countries which have advanced and long-standing privacy laws, much of which is judge-made, such as Germany). The absence of a precise delineation of the borderline between what is and is not to be permitted would not in the vast majority of cases prevent the making in advance of reliable judgments by those concerned as to whether a particular act in the circumstances of the case would cross the borderline between lawful action and the tort of privacy-invasive surveillance.\n\n2.22\n\nWhere doubts persisted our recommendations would provide a legislative framework for their resolution by the courts. For this purpose we suggest (see para. 2.10 above) the inclusion in the recommended privacy legislation of a series of non-exhaustive factors or considerations which the courts might take into account in assessing the existence and extent of the right to surveillance privacy in particular cases.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=31\n\n2.23\n\nOur reliance on the good judgment of the courts is well-justified. The Constitution of Ireland itself has depended for its full development on what is now a very substantial corpus of judge-made law concerning the full range of fundamental constitutional rights which has been built up in the last 60 years. The legislation we propose would introduce much-needed specificity to the law concerning surveillance privacy while allowing the courts the necessary room to interpret and apply that law so as to deal satisfactorily with the myriad of situations, many of them unforeseeable in advance, which may arise.\n\nB. WHAT WE MEAN BY THE PUBLIC INTEREST\n\n2.24\n\nWe set out below the general movement toward the concept of the public interest in freedom of expression doctrine under the Constitution. We then add our own understanding of the kind of shape such a concept would take in the context of providing a defence to wrongful publication of material obtained as a result of privacy-invasive surveillance.\n\n2.25\n\nWe consider that a public interest defence to wrongful publication as a result of surveillance is warranted both with respect to the case law under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (see chapter 5 and the detailed analysis in Annex I) as well as under the Constitution as presently interpreted by the Superior Courts.\n\n2.26\n\nAs will be seen under the Heads of Bill, the public interest concept we propose can also operate as an argument to inhibit the issuance of an injunction and as an argument against a motion to hold relevant proceedings in camera.\n\n1. The Emergence and Authority of the Public Interest Concept\n\n2.27\n\nFreedom of expression is protected under Article 40.6.1°i of the Constitution. It states\n\n2.28\n\nThe nature of this guarantee was comprehensively explored in our previous Report on the Civil Law of Defamation5. Many interpretative possibilities were explored in that report on the question whether the media enjoyed less, the same or more rights than ordinary members of the public. On the basis of existing case law at that time it did not appear as if the courts were inclined to afford an expansive interpretation to the provision  one that might recognise the special role of the media in Irish democratic life and carve out appropriate or enhanced latitude to publish on matters relating to the public interest. However, since that Report and indeed since the publication of our Consultation Paper on privacy, the Supreme Court has produced a seminal judgment concerning press freedom: The Irish Times et al. v. Ireland, the Attorney General and His Honour Judge Anthony G Murphy6.\n\n2.29\n\nIn that case the Supreme Court stood back from the text of Article 40.6.1°i and read it in light of democratic theory and the exigencies of accountability in democratic society. Specifically, a plurality of the judgments appear to accept that the press enjoy expansive freedom of expression rights under Article 40.6.1° and that this freedom (despite previous doubts to the contrary) includes a freedom to report facts as well as opinions and convictions7. The case itself involved a clash between the right to a fair trial (Articles 38.1 and 40.3) and the public right of access to (and publicity about) judicial proceedings (Article 34.1). The net issue posed concerned an order made by the trial judge in a drugs prosecution to drastically curtail media reportage of ongoing and contemporaneous court proceedings. Significantly, a plurality of judgments invoked Article 40.6.1° to further augment the public right of access and publicity under Article 34.1.\n\n2.30\n\nLying at the heart of the plurality judgments was the view that the public had a right to know how judicial proceedings are being conducted and that the media performs an important function in democratic society in communicating that information. The media is, in essence, the vital bridging link between the demand for (i.e., the democratic right of the people to know the relevant information concerning the trial) and the supply of this information. This right to know and to receive the information and the corollary right to impart that information could be grounded on Article 34 or more generally on Article 40.6.1°.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=33\n\n2.31\n\nIn the instant case all judges were of the view  as had been established in previous precedents  that the right to a fair trial took precedence over the right to know. The relevant test was whether there was a real risk that the right to trial might be jeopardised. On the facts of the case the Supreme Court held that the trial judge could not reasonably have come to that conclusion. Implicit, however, in the ruling is the possibility that had the evidence been more persuasive the trial Judge might properly have imposed appropriate restrictions on publicity.\n\n2.32\n\nWhat is the significance of this case in the context of this Report? First of all, the acknowledgement by the Supreme Court that the press enjoy an expansive freedom of expression fits with our overall approach which fully acknowledges the value of the media in democratic society. That is precisely why, at the outset, we endeavoured to test our recommendations against the higher standards set under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It may well be that the Irish Supreme Court is being progressively influenced by the values and spirit of Article 10 in its overall approach to interpreting Article 40.6.1°i. Indeed, at least one judge (Barrington J.) specifically mentions Article 10. Secondly, the expansive interpretation given to the right to include reportage on factual matters makes sense because the most important democratic function of the media is to impart information on which people can make up their own minds on matters of public concern.\n\n2.33\n\nThe Irish Times case itself obviously focused on a matter of legitimate public concern. Indeed, it would be hard to find a matter more of public concern than the conduct of ongoing judicial proceedings concerning charges of a serious criminal offence. The Supreme Court did not put forward  because it did not have to  any coherent theory according to which one might determine what was and was not of legitimate public concern or in the public interest. The case does not in any way detract from the validity of the distinction which we make in this Report, and which is vital to the public interest defence we propose, between matters that are of legitimate public concern and matters which are not (such as items which are merely newsworthy in the sense that they are liable to arouse curiosity or whet the appetite of some for sensational or scandalous material for its own sake).\n\n2.34\n\nWe do not make the unrealistic claim that all private matters are never of public concern or legitimate interest. We acknowledge that there may on occasion be a public right to know, and a corollary right of the media to impart, private information so long as there is sufficient and demonstrable connection between that matter and the public interest. That is exactly why we propound a public interest defence to the new tort of wrongful publication and that is why we empower a trial judge to take explicit account of the public interest in determining whether there is a good case for curtailing publicity connected with ongoing judicial proceedings connected to the kinds of civil and criminal actions we envisage.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=34\n\n2.35\n\nThere can, of course, be no doubting that some implicit principle of proportionality should be adhered to in any legislative proposals of the sort we make8. The overall obligation on the State under Article 40.3.2° of the Constitution is to protect and vindicate the right of privacy against unjust attack and as best as it may. We do not read into this a preference for self-regulation to the exclusion of statutory regulation. We are of the view that the public interest defence we recommend would, by allowing for a calibration of the people's right to know with the right to privacy, ensure ample compliance with any proportionality test in the context of this Report.\n\n2.36\n\nWe note in passing the recommendation of the Constitution Review Group (which was mentioned in several submissions made to us) to the effect that Article 40.6.1°i should be replaced with a new provision modelled on Article 10 of the European Convention9. The adoption of that proposal would not in any way impinge upon our recommendations, because our recommendations take full account of the European Convention on Human Rights (see below Chapter 5 and Annex I). For the sake of completeness we also note that the Constitution Review Group recommended that a general right of privacy should be specifically mentioned in Article 40.3 of the Constitution.10\n\n2. Our View as to the Public Interest in the Disclosure of Information Obtained by Surveillance\n\n(a) Elements of the Public Interest\n\n2.37\n\nThe issue raised here is what kinds of matter would count as being in the public interest for the purposes of the Heads of Bill notwithstanding that they are private in their nature and obtained as a result of privacy-invasive means ? The following, contained in our recommendations, is a non-exhaustive list.\n\nDetection and Prevention of Crime\n\n2.38\n\nFirst of all, there is a potential public interest in the detection and prevention of crime [see Head 3(3)(a)]. There arises a civic responsibility to bring any well-grounded suspicion of criminal activity to the attention of the Gardaí. In our view, the fact that this could have been done but was not done may well be one factor that a court might take into account in determining whether this aspect of the public interest properly lies in any given case of publication. On the other hand a court might be swayed in the other direction if, for example, the view is taken that the detection and prevention of crime by the public authorities might benefit by publication or in the event, albeit unlikely, that the conduct of the public authorities themselves is at issue. It is to be noted\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=35\n\nthat one would not normally expect that, in such a case, the information in issue would be about a person's private life, but it may have been obtained by surveillance that intrudes into private space.\n\nExposure of Serious Illegality or Wrongdoing\n\n2.39\n\nSecondly, there is a potential public interest in the exposure of serious illegality or wrongdoing [see Head 3(3)(b)]. Such wrongdoing may involve fraud on the public purse or may point to shortcomings in legislation or in the regulatory system. The illegality or wrongdoing in question must be serious and not trivial. Furthermore, there must be actual exposure of illegality or wrongdoing and not merely the publication of a bare and insubstantial belief in the existence of illegality or wrongdoing.\n\nNeed to Inform Public on a Matter of Public Importance\n\n2.40\n\nThirdly, there is a potential public interest involved in the need to inform the public on a matter of public importance [see Head 3(3)(c)]. This aspect of the public interest resonates with the latitude allowed by the European Court of Human Rights for publication of matter that is colourably political or on matters of genuine public interest. There is, in our view, no necessary or automatic link between aspects of a person's private life (or indeed their private history) and their fitness for office. Information about a public figure's private life might nonetheless well connect with, and thus have relevance to, his/her fitness for, or function in, public life. However, such a connection would need to be positively established before publication could take place under this defence. We see nothing in the case law under the European Convention on Human Rights that is at variance with this position. While this defence will in practice relate mostly to classic public figures such as politicians it might also potentially apply to others with a similarly high profile including leading corporate executives.\n\nNeed to Prevent Public from Being Misled\n\n2.41\n\nFourthly, there is a potential public interest in publishing information concerned with a person's private life in order to prevent the public from being misled by the public utterances or positions taken by them [see Head 3(3)(d)]. In our view this defence should only be available where the public figure (or putative public figure) has by his/her own conduct or statements put an issue into the public domain. It is not the status of the person simpliciter that activates the public interest under this strand of the defence. It is some voluntary act or statement that helps to establish or maintain a position or profile that is at odds with the person's true convictions or actual private behaviour. Thus, an exposé on the private life of a silent backbencher would not be warranted under this heading. Furthermore, it is only that which shows the contradiction between a public stance and a private reality that is potentially exposable under this defence. The publication of unrelated aspects of a person's private life in order to corroborate a suspicion about a contradiction between a public utterance and private beliefs or behaviour to the contrary ought not normally to count.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=36\n\n(b) Qualifications to the Public Interest Defence\n\n2.42\n\nWe envisage the following qualifications to the public interest defence as outlined above.\n\nPublic Interest Defeated where Harassment Involved\n\n2.43\n\nFirst of all, as already mentioned, it does not apply where the information, etc., has been obtained by way of harassment. The case for publication on the grounds of the public interest is less convincing where the information has been obtained by means of harassment, with its overtones of physical intimidation, than when it has been obtained by surveillance. The public interest in publication is overborne in our view by the immediate and direct public interest in preventing harassment which disturbs the public peace. No encouragement or comfort whatever should be provided whether directly or indirectly by the law to those who engage in harassment or to those who (innocently or otherwise) seek to gain by the results of such harassment.\n\nRequirement of Proportionality\n\n2.44\n\nSecondly, the publication of details of a person's private life for the sake of salaciousness should be considered excessive and therefore unlawful [see proviso (b) to Head 3]. It is entirely right that some notion of proportionality should apply since the power to publish in the public interest is an exception to the right of privacy and must be read accordingly.\n\nDefence not Available in Cases of Complicity\n\n2.45\n\nThirdly, the entity engaged in the publication must not have been party to or privy to the act of privacy-invasive surveillance. It would be entirely unconscionable in our view to allow such an entity to gain a direct advantage through its own wrongdoing [see proviso (a) to Head 3].\n\nDefence not Available Where Criminal Acts Occur\n\n2.46\n\nFourthly, the defence should not be available where the acts of privacy-invasive surveillance in question involved, in the opinion of the court, the commission of any of the acts specified in the list contained in the Schedule to these Heads [see proviso (a) to Head 3]. Most of these already  or will be if our recommendations are acted on  constitute criminal offences. The list includes illegal interception, breaches of the Data Protection Act, 1988 and the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, spying on conversations by using aural or visual surveillance devices and unlawfully entering or remaining on private property in order to obtain personal information. We view it as axiomatic that no one should be allowed any benefit arising from the infraction of the criminal law even if they themselves were not party to the infraction.\n\nDefence Only Goes to Publication  Not to Newsgathering Acts that Violate Civil or Criminal law\n\n2.47\n\nFifthly, this defence applies only with respect to publication. We do not recommend that it be made available with respect to acts of privacy-invasive surveillance undertaken for the purpose of information-gathering. We have\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=37\n\nconsidered carefully whether the public interest defence should extend to such news-gathering acts preparatory to publication and we have decided that it should not.\n\n2.48\n\nThe argument for so extending the public interest defence builds on the insight that the rationale behind the public interest defence in the context of publication concerns enhancing the quantity and quality of political ideas and information in the democratic marketplace. If so, the argument runs, then the defence should reach further back along the chain of activities that may start with surveillance and end with publication.\n\n2.49\n\nHowever logical that argument may appear to be,11 sooner or later it clashes with one of the central tenets of the rule of law; namely, that the law should apply equally to all. To allow the defence to reach news-gathering activities would tend to make the individual news-gatherer a judge in his own case. Stories might be chased and information obtained in a privacy-invasive manner on a mere hope or expectation that the public interest defence would apply. Actions might be justified retrospectively if at all. We fear this gives too much scope for self-serving interpretations of the law.\n\n2.50\n\nFurthermore, the public interest defence is itself a creature of peculiar norms that explicitly protect expression. To be sure, the European Court of Human Rights in its recent decisions has begun to recognise that the formal act of expression cannot be completely separated from the environment within which journalists function. This entails an alertness against legal norms that unnecessarily impede those activities. However, that does not mean that every information-gathering act can or should be made immune to suit under a public interest theory.12 We are reinforced in our view by what the U.S. Supreme Court described as\n\n2.51\n\nAs the court explained in that case,\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=38\n\nTherefore, both because of the imperatives of the rule of law and because the public interest theory is generally derived from legal protections that protect expression, the public interest defence should apply only in relation to disclosure.\n\n14\n\nibid.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=39\n\nCHAPTER 3: THE PRIVACY PROBLEM AND THE INADEQUACY OF EXISTING LAW IN IRELAND\n\n3.1\n\nIn this chapter we review briefly the nature of the problem posed by surveillance and the inadequacy of domestic law to cope. We then proceed in the next chapter to build the case for reform in the shape of fresh legislation.\n\n1. The Existence of a Privacy Problem\n\n3.2\n\nWe distinguish between two levels where intrusion can occur. The primary level  the core focus of this Report  concerns particular acts of surveillance including, for example, the use of long-range telephoto cameras or listening devices. The secondary level  which is not our core focus but which is nevertheless implicated by our core focus  concerns the publication of information obtained as a result of privacy-invasive surveillance.\n\n3.3\n\nAs already indicated in detail in section 3 of Chapter 1 of this Report our answer to the question whether there is a privacy problem with respect to the primary level i.e., acts of privacy-invasive surveillance  is an unqualified yes.\n\n3.4\n\nSurveillance and interception activities are often unobtrusive and, for that very reason, difficult to notice and detect. Most people are (and remain) ignorant of the fact that they are  or have been  the subject of privacy-invasive surveillance. This is through no fault of their own but is a function of the nature of the technology in question which is as unobtrusive as it is highly intrusive. Easy assumptions about ease of mind in public places are no longer as well-founded today as in the past.\n\n3.5\n\nFurthermore, the very existence and widespread availability of sophisticated technology  technology designed to scrutinise private life  renders it highly implausible to think that it is not used (and, in the absence of legislation to control its use, abused on occasion) by a variety of actors. This problem is likely to get worse and not better given the free availability of the technology (including through mail order delivery) and in the context of a legal vacuum where the use of that technology is not comprehensively regulated. Moreover the list of monitoring devices contained in chapter 1 above makes it clear that many of the devices are capable of, or are even specifically adapted for, spying on people in private places.\n\n3.6\n\nAs is natural in any process of rapid change, society has tended to passively acquiesce in the introduction and use of new technology without a full\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=40\n\nappraisal of its dangers as well as advantages. The result has been uncertainty about the reach of the existing legal regime and the creation of a legal vacuum. For example, there are no legal safeguards dealing specifically with the installation of surveillance devices in public places. The Gardaí are not required to undergo any form of due process requirements before resorting to surveillance. This is not to say that this power has been misused by the Gardaí but it is to say that there is a privacy problem in as much as satisfactory assurances in law against misuse are not presently provided for.\n\n3.7\n\nIt must be added that modern technology is not the only reason why protection under the law is required against privacy-invasive surveillance. Surveillance including privacy-invasive harassment by more traditional methods remains a continuing source of serious problems.\n\n3.8\n\nWhen the possibilities which flow from the use of highly sophisticated privacy-invasive technology are added to the use of such more traditional methods, the case for protection under the law becomes all the more imperative. This is a case of technology outpacing the capacity of the law to cope and is a classic case for law reform. The number of proven instances of abuse is not determinative. The crucial variable is the element of almost helpless exposure and insecurity introduced by new technology.\n\n3.9\n\nIn response to the question whether there is a problem at the secondary level i.e. publication as a result of privacy-invasive surveillance  our answer is a qualified yes.\n\n3.10\n\nThere arises the temptation, so far generally resisted in the Irish media, to follow the example of sensationalist and privacy-insensitive foreign media imports in order to match circulation. This temptation is likely to grow and not diminish as the penetration of foreign media into Ireland increases. Ireland is already one of the most open markets in the world for foreign media penetration and is therefore more vulnerable than most to these kinds of market pressures. It is entirely prudent to seek to maintain high standards and, in so doing, to take full account of the growing threat posed by some elements of the foreign media.\n\n3.11\n\nA general law to which all media outlets are equally bound would deny any one actor a competitive advantage in succumbing to this temptation. Such a law would introduce a genuine level playing field where any deviation from high standards would not confer a commercial advantage.\n\n3.12\n\nAny process of self-regulation which merely administers a rebuke after the fact is not likely to prove robust enough to maintain standards in the face of increasing market temptation in our view. The enactment of a law forbidding privacy-invasive surveillance is, in our view, as much in the interests of the media as it is in the interests of the right of privacy.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=41\n\n3.13\n\nIt is doubtless true, as was pressed on the Commission in submissions, that there has been a low level of official complaints about invasions of privacy  and especially as a result of surveillance  in Ireland.1\n\n3.14\n\nIn view however of the availability in particular of the sophisticated surveillance technology already described, and of copious reports from the media that it is being used2, we consider that it would be an error to draw the conclusion that there is no problem which requires to be addressed in this country. As stated in paragraph 2.4 of our Consultation Paper, the precise extent to which surveillance occurs in Ireland is unknown, but media reports suggest that surveillance by both public and private actors (including the media themselves) is not uncommon. When one takes also into account the established existence in Ireland of a substantial and so far unregulated private investigation and detective industry (which however is responsible for a part only of the surveillance which takes place) it seems to us that it would be extremely naive to conclude otherwise than that there is a real threat to the human right of privacy in this country.\n\n3.15\n\nThere is no shortage of potential human subjects from all walks of and stations in life for privacy-invasive surveillance in today's Ireland. Some but by no means all of these are seen to belong to the rich, powerful and influential classes, both Irish and foreign. Surveillance of ordinary people is well capable of yielding highly profitable material. In the absence of privacy-protective legislation there are now many inviting targets for gratuitous surveillance by both national and international media and other interests.\n\n3.16\n\nWhile many, perhaps most, of the actors who use surveillance technology may have some legitimate reason for doing so, there is in our view a clear necessity to regulate surveillance and so provide adequate assurances to the public in the form of remedies, both civil and, where appropriate, criminal, which are likely to prove effective to prevent abuses before they occur or compensate adequately for or penalise intrusions after the fact.\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=42\n\n3.17\n\nIf there is a problem regarding surveillance then there is, at least prima facie, a corresponding problem to be addressed regarding the disclosure or publication, where this occurs within the State, whether by the media or others, of the fruits of such surveillance. When one takes into account the openness of the Irish market to penetration by low-priced tabloid newspapers from the United Kingdom in particular it becomes difficult to escape this conclusion. The fact that there is no legislation in the United Kingdom in the area covered by the recommendations in this report does not alter the fact that British Governments over the past thirty years or more have commissioned reports from a number of expert committees as to the need for such legislation and have repeatedly been advised, having regard to experience in that country of privacy-invasive behaviour by the media in particular, that such legislation, covering both intrusions into personal privacy and the disclosure and publication of information thereby obtained, is called for. Although it is accepted that the standards observed by the media in Ireland have in general been considerably higher than those of some of their counterparts in the United Kingdom, it would to say the least be imprudent to ignore the potential influence on standards in Ireland of those of the media in the United Kingdom.\n\n3.18\n\nIn short, Ireland can no longer be taken to be an island either in the surveillance sense or in the sense of disclosure and publication of information obtained by surveillance, but is part of a larger information market in which, for reasons which we make clear in this Report, it has already been widely (if not universally) accepted that legislation to protect the right of privacy is necessary. Unfortunately, the supply of the fruits of media intrusion into people's private lives tends to create its own demand and to offer a premium for further such intrusion and publication. We are firmly of the view that the time is now ripe for measures to control this situation in the interests of the general public. As far as these measures would affect the media we would seek to buttress high standards there while not taking away from the liberty of the media to champion the people's right to know in suitable cases.\n\n3.19\n\nIn remainder of this Chapter we review briefly the constitutional template supporting a general right of privacy and the question whether it is sufficient without legislation.\n\n2. The Constitutional Template\n\nThe Constitutional Right of Privacy\n\n3.20\n\nIrish constitutional law does place great emphasis on human dignity and strongly supports a right of privacy. But, as will be seen below, we are of the view that reliance on constitutional means of redress alone is insufficient. There is a palpable need to move beyond general constitutional protection to create effective means of redress in positive law. Irish positive law fails to deliver a comprehensive and effective means of protection at present. The glaring gap\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=43\n\nbetween high constitutional promise and practical legal provision needs to be closed.\n\n3.21\n\nThe right of privacy is now well established in Irish constitutional law. Although it is nowhere specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution, its existence has been implied by the courts from several textual sources including Article 41 (the Family) and Article 40.3.1. (unenumerated rights of the person).\n\n3.22\n\nThere are at least two general anchorage points to privacy in Irish constitutional law  both of which offer strong and positive support for the recommendations of this Report.\n\n3.23\n\nThe first anchorage point turns on the implication of a right of privacy from a variety of rights already protected explicitly in the text of the Constitution. These include textual rights dealing with\n\n3.24\n\nThe courts typically imply privacy in or from these textual rights in order to give them a heightened measure of efficacy.\n\n3.25\n\nThe family based on marriage is a special and highly valued kind of human association under Article 41. It was felt necessary by the Supreme Court in McGee v. Attorney General4 and its progeny to imply privacy into Article 41 in order to advance the interests of the family and its members and to more fully honour the social functions it serves. Some confusion seems to exist over whether privacy should be conceptualised exclusively as a shield that immunises decision-making capacity or autonomy over certain matters from outside intrusion or whether it attaches more to those matters themselves that lie behind the shield. If the latter approach is correct then the question naturally arises whether those matters should more properly be the subject of separately denominated constitutional rights (e.g., the right to beget children within the family). This confusion merely reflects the more general distinction alluded to earlier in this Report between viewing privacy as a shield and/or viewing it as\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=44\n\nattaching to certain matters (and only those matters) that lie behind that shield.\n\n3.26\n\nRegardless of whichever approach one takes, it is clear that marital privacy receives quite strong protection under Article 41. This constitutional anchor is of relevance to this Report. It points strongly in favour of a presumption that, with respect to the intimacies of marital life, and absent a compelling and clearly established case, such intimacies ought to be immune from unwarranted intrusion through surveillance and any resulting publication.\n\n3.27\n\nThe inviolability of the dwelling as protected by the Constitution (Article 40.5) is also of particular relevance to the subject of this Report. This may be conceptualised as a way of protecting privacy albeit in the limited context of a private dwelling. This, no doubt, reflects the value placed by the common law on property and on the associated right to enjoy the amenities of private property in privacy. It thus forms an added element of the overall privacy shield. However, it was not constitutionalised under the rubric of property but instead under Article 40 which deals more generally with the fundamental rights of the person. Hence, although the protection afforded by the right attaches to a dwelling, it primarily avails persons who inhabit or simply visit dwellings. Such persons need not have any property interest in a particular dwelling to benefit from this right. This points to a presumption of a very strong protection of privacy within the confines of a private dwelling. The right would seem to be equally capable of violation whether by physical intrusion or by using long-range audio or video devices.\n\n3.28\n\nThe right of private property, which is protected under a combination of Articles 43 (property) and Article 40.3.1° (the guarantee to protect and vindicate rights against unjust attack), further bolsters the right of privacy. The legal concept of property relates primarily to relations between persons with respect to things. To denominate property as private means to establish a relationship of relative exclusivity between an owner of a thing and others in relation to that thing. The right or prerogative to exclude is bound up with the concept of property and is therefore, inter alia, one more way of protecting privacy. This points to, and further augments, the protection of the inviolability of the dwelling and arguably extends it to cover other real property including a garden, curtilage or office. Indeed Article 8 of the European Convention is now been interpreted to apply in an office and commercial setting (see chapter 5).\n\n3.29\n\nThe second anchorage point for privacy in the Constitution turns on a consideration of human personhood  on what it means to be a human being and the need for some islands of withdrawal in which the person may flourish. Hence, some judges in McGee let privacy rest on the more general provisions dealing with the unenumerated rights of the person under Article 40.3.1°. In this vein one judge in a later case viewed privacy as necessary for the expression of\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=45\n\nthe individual personality5 and as flowing from the Christian and democratic nature of the State.\n\n3.30\n\nThis anchor rests on a much more plenary view of the person detached from any particular relationships he or she may have. Furthermore, it is not tied to property or a dwelling. It therefore presumptively creates personal space that can follow the person from context to context and stands to be calibrated (but not extinguished) as the person passes through different spaces (public and private or vice versa). This anchor is of relevance to this Report since it makes it plain that privacy may be violated outside the intimacies of personal relationships by, inter alia, intrusions into purely personal space.\n\n3.31\n\nIn this context it is relevant to recall the words of Hamilton P. in Kennedy v. Ireland where he wrote that the\n\n3.32\n\nIt is this connection to dignity that affords privacy such a potentially expansive character. This finds strong echoes in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights which premises the Article 8 conception of privacy on the physical and moral integrity of the person (see chapter 5).\n\n3.33\n\nThis points to a personal right of privacy that exists no matter the context (albeit affected by the context) and regardless of whether privacy is already indirectly protected e.g. through property or the inviolability of a dwelling. It gives rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy even in public places.\n\n3.34\n\nFrom the above it can be fairly deduced that\n\nSurveillance in Constitutional Litigation\n\n3.35\n\nThe specific issue of surveillance has received some attention in the courts from the perspective of constitutional law.\n\n3.36\n\nFor example, in Kane v. Governor of Mountjoy Prison the Supreme Court endorsed the police surveillance involved in that case provided adequate justification exists for it on the facts of the case and considering the importance of the duty being discharged by the police (apprehension of a person for whom the delivery of an extradition warrant was imminent) and the extent and nature of the surveillance. This was not a case of covert surveillance but involved overt surveillance where an added concern about personal liberty was in issue. That this issue could be aired before the superior courts is a good thing. However, it would be preferable, in our view, to provide a basis in positive law for such police action especially where it involves covert surveillance. The need for a positive legal basis for such official action is in fact required under Article 8 of the European Convention (see chapter 5).\n\n3.37\n\nIn Kennedy v. Ireland7 the High Court established that a person enjoys a personal constitutional right of privacy in his/her telephone conversations and the right is breached by deliberate, conscious and unjustifiable interference with such communication. Interference might be justified where required on the grounds of the protection of the constitutional rights of others, the common good and public order and morality. No such grounds arose properly on the facts of the case. This case was one of the factors that led to the introduction of comprehensive legislation governing telephone interception in 19938.\n\n3.38\n\nIn DPP v. Kenny9 the High Court held that it was not a breach of privacy for those who have lawful custody of a person to observe him. Common sense alone would dictate that a person's right of privacy is drastically altered (though not eliminated) whilst under lawful incarceration. This case finds echoes\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=47\n\nin the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. The limits of the privacy-intrusive prerogatives of those who are in lawful custody were not adumbrated but undoubtedly exist under Irish constitutional law.\n\n3.39\n\nMore problematically, the High Court in Nason v. Cork Corporation10 the High Court ruled that photographic evidence that tended to show that the plaintiff in a personal accident case had not in fact suffered the injuries complained of was admissible. The Court rationalised the admissibility of the evidence on the ground that the plaintiff had a reduced expectation of privacy even when in her own home with the curtains undrawn and on a public street and furthermore that it would be anomalous to require answers to questions in court that opened up the plaintiff's private life and yet not to allow for far less intrusive photographic evidence. In a sense, the greater power of the court to compel answers was taken to include the lesser power of a photographer to take photographs in public or semi-private places. It might have been preferable to handle the privacy issue presented in this case in terms of the strength of the countervailing rights, powers and duties of the defendant (and its agent, the investigator-photographer) rather than simply assume that the greater power of the court always includes the lesser power of the private investigator. In its own way this case shows the need for detailed legislation governing the kinds of activities involved.\n\n3.40\n\nIn Devoy v. The Right Honourable Lord Mayor, Aldermen & Burgesses of Dublin, Beattie, Heavey & Brooks11 the High Court allowed the admission of a secret tape recording of a workman into disciplinary proceedings by analogising it to a photograph. This was a form of participant-monitoring. An issue of this kind could be handled under our present proposals by announcing (or rejecting) a reasonable expectation of privacy against such secret taping of a conversation, having balanced the intrusion against other individual rights and interests.\n\nConclusion\n\n3.41\n\nThe existing caselaw of our Superior Courts contains clear statements of a constitutional right of privacy and of freedom from unjustified surveillance. Nonetheless, the content and limits of this right are unclear and do not permit the citizen, the media or others concerned to determine with even reasonable certainty their rights and obligations in this sphere. How can this uncertainty best be addressed? In our view, expansive judicial interpretation of the Constitution or judicial reform of the common law are likely to remain a poor substitute for legislative change in the sphere of privacy. To say this is neither to criticise the role of the courts nor to criticise the judiciary. Judge-made law is entirely dependent on the claims that happen to make it to court. Only those parties with sufficient resources are likely to have the wherewithal to test the\n\nTHIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE-BREAK: PAGE NUMBER=48\n\nouter limits of the law. The fact that impecunious plaintiffs, in particular, can sometimes succeed in securing legal representation does not alter the general truth of this statement. The kinds of claims that make it to court will be narrowed down to a series of net points which may not adequately capture the full spread of concerns (and competing rights) at play in the field. This merely points to the weakness of the adversarial processes as a way of engaging in rational law reform. Furthermore, standing will be allowed only for those directly involved in the case at bar. In an area of such public importance as this, it is surely better for the law to evolve in a manner that allo"
