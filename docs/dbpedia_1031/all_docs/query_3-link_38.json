A former U.S. intelligence officer convicted of trying to pass defense information to China was solemn as he was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in prison and said he \"would give anything\" to change his actions.\n\nRon Rockwell Hansen, 60, wearing a gray jumpsuit, apologized in a trembling voice to his family and former colleagues for \"pain and damage\" he caused.\n\n\"Your honor there simply are no words to accurately and fully express the depth of regret I have for my decisions and actions...

Colombia's armed forces' intelligence chief resigned on Monday after media found President Ivan Duque had presented fabricated evidence of \"narcoterrorist\" activity in Venezuela.\n\nIn a press release, the Defense Minister said that the director of the Armed Forces' Joint Department of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, Brigadier General Oswaldo PeÃ±a, had requested his resignation.\n\nPeÃ±a's department provided the information with which Duque and Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo sought to substantiate the government's claim that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was colluding with ELN guerrillas and FARC guerrillas.

A source close to the Egyptian intelligence told The New Arab's Arabic language service that the undersecretary of Egypt's General Intelligence Agency, who is also Sisi's son, issued a decree to ban intelligence officers from travelling while he undergoes an investigation on those who want to overthrow the president.\n\nMahmoud al-Sisi is reportedly doing this after hearing rumours that there are officials within Sisi's close circles that want him to be removed as Egypt's president.\n\n\"Sisi's son commissioned a committee of security leaders to start an extensive investigation on intelligence officers which will include a detailed report on their bank transactions and communications\", an anonymous source said.\n\n\"A large number of officers have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation is over,\" they added.

He has written some of Britain's best-loved espionage novels, filled with Cold War double agents inspired by real people he met while spying for the British Government in West Germany.\n\nJohn Le CarrÃ©, whose real name is David Cornwell, left MI6 in 1963 and built a new career on secret plots of a fictional kind.\n\nBut the novelist has been accused by a real-life spymaster of being \"obsessed\" with his secret service career, despite having only serving for three years, and writing \"corrosive\" books that undermine the UK's intelligence services.\n\nSir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, said Le CarrÃ©'s novels are \"exclusively about betrayal\" and trade on the author's limited experience as an intelligence officer to make spying seem immoral.

On the morning of Feb. 2, 1993, Jim Woolsey sat in a confirmation hearing to become the director of the CIA and made a sobering statement: the Soviet Union had collapsed; the Cold War was supposedly over.\n\nIt was the conclusion of a brutal, tense, all-or-nothing, 40-year struggle during which much of the world teetered on the brink of possible extinction with powerful arrays of nuclear weapons on both sides.\n\nPolitical pressure, Western intelligence victories and paranoia among the Soviet leadership - according to historical documents - eventually toppled the communist regime and the U.S. emerged as the world's only remaining superpower.\n\nWoolsey told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that morning, \"We have slain a large dragon. But we live now in a jungle filled with a bewildering variety of poisonous snakes. And in many ways, the dragon was easier to keep track of.\" [Read more: Green/WTOP/27September2019]\n\nBBC's Excellent Documentary on The Troubles is Now Focusing on the Intelligence War Against the IRA. While the opening three episodes of BBC's enthralling documentary series Spotlight on The Troubles: A Secret History have provided an in-depth retelling of the conflict, it appears that the next episodes will be delving into the murkier waters of espionage, collusion, and state secrets.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the upcoming episode will focus on the Loughall ambush, an incident which occurred on 8 May 1987 in the village of Loughgall, Armagh.\n\nDuring this firefight, an eight-man unit of the Provisional IRA's East Tyrone Brigade were shot dead after they loaded a 200lb bomb onto a stolen digger and smashed through the gates of the RUC barracks in Loughgall.\n\nThe bomb exploded and destroyed almost half of the base.

He walked two blocks behind me and insisted on a cafÃ© or restaurant that was sparsely populated. Given the circumstances, I couldn't blame him.\n\n\"Levan,\" as I'll call him, was once a senior official in Georgia's interior ministry. According to two current Georgian officials, he was also the recruiter and handler of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, the 40-year-old ethnic Chechen from Georgia's Pankisi Gorge region who was shot in the head and killed in central Berlin on Aug. 23 as he headed to a local mosque to attend Friday prayers.\n\nKhangoshvili's daylight murder in the Kleiner Tiergarten, a park full of people, bore all of the hallmarks of a carefully orchestrated assassination, a fate common to Kremlin opponents, the kind of killing to which Europe has lately grown accustomed.

Ji Chaoqun easily blended in among the 2,900 international students at the Illinois Institute of Technology, a private school just off the Dan Ryan Expressway near White Sox park.\n\nExcept Ji was not just any student on campus. Federal authorities allege he was secretly working for a Chinese spy agency.\n\nChinese spies focused on stealing the secrets of major U.S. aerospace companies had recruited Ji for assistance in Chicago, according to court records. Ji is alleged to have secretly met with his handlers in China and was tasked with gathering biographical information on eight Chinese nationals working in the U.S. Prosecutors say the Chinese government planned to try and recruit the eight as spies - most of whom worked for defense contractors as scientists and engineers.\n\nJi now finds himself in the middle of an ongoing national security investigation that also led to the arrest and unprecedented extradition to the U.S. last year of Ji's handler, a senior intelligence officer in China's main spy agency. It marked the first time a Chinese spy has been brought to this country to face criminal prosecution.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is unleashing a new generation of autonomous underwater robots that will fundamentally change the way future naval wars are fought. The U.S. Navy surely has an advantage, being slightly further along the development and doctrinal path than other less well-funded navies. But as is the nature of AI and robotics, it is a space where others can disrupt the established order of things.\n\nChina is about to show the world what it has been working on. The government is expected to put on its largest military parade ever October 1 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It will be jam-packed with the latest weapons technologies. Much of the new equipment that will be on show is still under wraps, literally. Pouring over grainy candid smartphone photographs of the rehearsals posted on Chinese language social media, military watchers have spotted something hiding under a canvas that I believe will be significant.

The world is a particularly confusing and daunting place these days: Russian bots, North Korean nukes, trade wars and climate emergencies. To understand it better, Foreign Policy and the Brookings Institution are teaming up for an 8-part podcast series. On each episode, host Jonathan Tepperman and a guest from Brookings discuss one of the world's most vexing problems and trace its origins.

Mitchell during Watergate, Representative Michael Myers during Abscam, Fawn Hall during Iran-contra, Monica Lewinsky during the Clinton affair, and spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen in their espionage cases.\n\nIn addition to his newsworthy clients, Plato gave graciously of his time and expertise to anyone who needed his help.

He enjoyed time with family and friends, preferably at Bethany Beach.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 64 years, Ethel D. Cacheris, a daughter, son, and other family. [Read more: WashingtonPost/26September2019]\n\nBill Hawley, CIA Officer\n\nFrederick William Hawley, 88, CIA and Department of State Officer, died 15 September 2019 in Sarasota, FL.\n\nBill attended The Choate School, Wellington College (UK), and Princeton University prior to joining the Central Intelligence Agency. From 1954-57 he served in the US Army, training to become a Ranger Infantry Officer in the 82nd Airborne Division. He continued serving his country in a wide range of international responsibilities with the CIA and Department of State until 1972, including tours in Germany, Holland and Austria. In 1972, he joined the White House to serve as Assistant Director to the Council of International Economic Policy.\n\nIn 1975 he moved to the private sector, where he rose to serve as Director of International Government Relations at Citibank, N.A. until his retirement in 1998.\n\nBill served on the Boards of several professional and community organizations, and was a member of the Cosmos Club in Washington, DC. He also served as President of the Hawley Society for 10 years. A lifelong pianist, who toured with the Princeton Triangle Club, Bill was passionate about music. He was also a skilled photographer and an avid reader of history.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 58 years, Valeska Seelmann Hawley, by three daughters and a son, and other family.\n\nHis family and friends will forever cherish his devotion to family, intellectual curiosity, endearing wit, and compelling stories. A Celebration of Life is being planned for January in Sarasota.\n\nRobert Lewis, Librarian, CIA Analyst\n\nRobert John Cornelius Koons Lewis, 81, Librarian, CIA Officer, died 21 September 2019.\n\nBorn in Washington, DC, he graduated from George Washington University with a BA in History and Religion.

He had several club memberships.\n\nHe is survived by two sons, a sister, and other family.\n\nJoe Wilson, Former Ambassador Who Challenged Iraq War narrative; Husband of CIA Officer Valerie Plame\n\nJoseph Charles Wilson IV, 69, a long-serving American diplomat who contradicted White House claims in 2003 that Iraq had purchased yellowcake from Niger for making bombs, died of organ failure 27 September 2019 in Santa Fe, NM.\n\nWilson undermined President George W. Bush's claim by writing an Op-Ed in the New York Times, an act seen as a betrayal which lead to the unmasking of his wife, Valerie Plame, as a CIA officer.\n\nMr. Wilson's act changed the politics of the war and forced the White House to concede, grudgingly, that Mr. Bush had built the case for war on a cherry-picked intelligence.\n\nWilson graduated in 1972 from the University of California at Santa Barbara, where he was a self-described \"surf dude.\" He worked as a carpenter, but a facility with languages earned him a position with the State Department in 1976. He worked in several African countries, including Niger, South Africa and Burundi, and in the mid-1980s served on the congressional staffs of Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) and Rep. Tom Foley (D-Wash.).\n\nFrom 1988 to 1991 he was the second-ranking diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, during the run-up to the 1991 Gulf War. In September 1990, after Iraqi forces had attacked Kuwait, about 60 Americans sought refuge at the U.S. ambassador's residence.\n\nIn 2002, by then a private citizen, he was asked by the CIA to travel to Niger to verify reports that it had sold a nuclear material, uranium yellowcake, to Iraq in the 1990s. Wilson concluded that the reports of a Niger-Iraq deal were false. When President Bush, in his January 2003 State of the Union Message said that \"the British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa,\" and then ordered an American invasion of Iraq seven weeks later, Wilson was livid and felt the record needed to be corrected.\n\nHe wrote an Op-Ed published in the New York Times on 6 July 2003 titled, \"What I Didn't Find in Africa.\"\n\nA week after the Op-Ed, a conservative syndicated columnist wrote a column identifying Ms. Plame as a CIA operative, a breach given that her work required secrecy since she was serving as a NOC.\n\nAn investigation into the leak of Ms. Plame's identity led to charges against Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby Jr., not for leaking but for lying about his conversations with reporters about Ms. Plame and for obstruction of justice. President Bush commuted his 30-month prison sentence, and last year President Trump gave him a full pardon.\n\nFor Joe Wilson, the decision to write the Op-Ed was a matter of patriotic duty and he wrote about that decision in a 2004 memoir,The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity...A Diplomat's Memoir, followed three years later by Plame's own memoir. The books formed the basis of a 2010 film, \"Fair Game,\" in which Mr. Wilson was portrayed by Sean Penn and Plame by Naomi Watts.\n\nMs. Plame, whose marriage to Mr. Wilson ended in divorce in 2017, said he had never regretted the decision.\n\nIn addition to his third ex-wife, Valerie Plame, Joe Wilson's first two marriages, to Susan Otchis and French diplomat Jacqueline Giorgi, also ended in divorce. Survivors include twins from his first marriage, and twins from his marriage to Plame, and other family.\n\n[Read more: NewYorkTimes/27September2019]\n\nJobs\n\nFireEye Has Many Intelligence Positions Available For You - Worldwide - Contract, Full-time, Part-time, Interns\n\nExplore the many career and contractor intelligence jobs available here.

Features Jonna Mendez, former CIA Chief of Disguise, co-author of The Moscow Rules: The Secret CIA Tactics That Helped America Win the Cold War, and Vince Houghton PhD, Spy Museum Historian, discussing his just released The Nuclear Spies: America's Atomic Intelligence Operation against Hitler and Stalin.\n\nJonna Mendez's presentation starts at 11 a.m. Mendez (Spy Dust: Two Masters of Disguise Reveal the Tools and Operations That Helped Win the Cold War), share (with late husband Tony Mendez) their experiences as spies in Moscow during the height of the Cold War in the mid-1980s. The authors begin with the initial list of \"the Moscow Rules\" and continue to discuss briefly the current state of affairs in Russia under Vladimir Putin, and how they interfered with the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nVince Houghton PhD, historian and curator of the International Spy Museum, makes his presentation at 1 p.m. on The Nuclear Spies: America's Atomic Intelligence Operation against Hitler and Stalin.

The Communist Party of China deceived the West into believing that its system and the Party-ruled People's Liberation Army were peaceful and posed no threat. In fact, these misguided policies produced the emergence of a 21stcentury challenge that may be as dangerous to the United States and its allies as the Soviet Union was. How can it meet this challenge?\n\nBill Gertz, national security columnist, The Washington Times, is author of seven books, including Breakdown: How America's Intelligence Failures Led to September 11 and The China Threat: How the People's Republic Targets America.\n\nWhere: Westminster Institute, 6729 Curran St, McLean, VA 22101.

Kim Dong-shin, South Korea Minister of National Defense (ret.)\n\n16 October, 4:30 - 6 pm: US-NK Relations: The Post-Hanoi Summit with a senior policy panel, to include:\n\nGen.

A new, relatively untested leader with a burgeoning weapons inventory – both nuclear and conventional, and a penchant for unpredictability, Kim Jong-un represents both an enigma and an unprecedented dilemma. From what appeared to be a relatively promising first ever meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting U.S. President in Singapore to a disappointing sequence of events in Hanoi, the current situation on the Korean peninsula remains potentially extremely volatile.\n\nAbout the Speaker and Panel Members: On 15 October, former ROK Minister of National Defense, Gen. Kim Dong-shin will present a lecture based on his significant experiences as part of the national leadership during the myriad inter-Korean dialogue as well as his assessment as to the path forward in addressing what is undoubtedly one of the most pressing national security and foreign policy issues of our time.\n\nOn 16 October, panel members in addition to Gen. Kim, include Gen. John Tilelli, Jr., former Commander in Chief of the United Nations Command, and concurrently Commander of U.S. Combined Forces, and U.S. Forces Korea; Dr. Victor Cha, former Director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council and currently a senior advisor and holder of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Mr. Bruce Klingner, former CIA Deputy Director for Korea analysis and currently the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center.\n\nLocation: The Institute of World Politics, 1521 16th St NW, Washington, D.C.

Fox was in her last year as an undergraduate at Oxford when her writing mentor Daniel Pearl was captured and beheaded. Galvanized by this brutality, Fox applied to Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, where she created an algorithm that predicted, with uncanny certainty, the likelihood of a terrorist cell arising in any village around the world. At 21, she was recruited by the CIA. At 22, she was fast-tracked into advanced operations training, sent from Langley to \"the Farm,\" learning how to use a Glock, how to get out of flexicuffs while locked in the trunk of a car, how to withstand torture, and the best ways to commit suicide in case of captivity. At the end of this training she was deployed as a spy under non-official cover as an art dealer specializing in tribal and indigenous art and sent to infiltrate terrorist networks in remote areas of the Middle East and Asia. Join Fox this evening as she discusses her ten years in the CIA clandestine service and launches her riveting new memoir Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA. Life Undercover will be available for sale and signing at the event. Tickets for the general public: $15 (or $35 including book); tickets for Spy Museum members: $10 (or $30 including book).

She didn't let a hunting accident which robbed her of a leg slow her down.

Three years after being chased from office, the former president discovers the identity of the man who released his secret file. The ex-President begins to exact revenge while plotting his return to power. A fatwa makes CIA pilot Duncan Hunter the most wanted man in America. Then an airliner disappears over the Pacific Ocean. The new President gives the CIA two time-sensitive missions: find and eliminate his traitorous predecessor, and stop a self-radicalized computer scientist before another airliner goes missing. Duncan Hunter is in the race of his life to stop a jumbo jet from crashing. The CIA believes they have finally located the former president. All roads lead to Dubai where a showdown between good and evil begins on the top floor of the world's tallest building. Event is free.
