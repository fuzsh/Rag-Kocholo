        "text": "Remember, Honor, Build, and Preserve\n\nRemember - Each year, the KWVMF hosts several ceremonies at the Korean War Veterans Memorial to help carry out its mission to honor those who have served and sacrificed for our country during the Korean War.\n\nHonor - The Korean War Veterans Honor Roll pays tribute to every Veteran who served in the Korean War, including those who made it home. While their names are not on the Memorial Wall of Remembrance, they are never forgotten.\n\nBuild and Maintenance - The Wall of Remembrance is a new, permanent addition to the Memorial, including the names of more than 36,000 American servicemen and over 7,100 members of the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army. They gave their lives defending the people of South Korea.\n\nPreserve - The memorial commemorates the sacrifices of the 5.8 million Americans who served in the U.S. armed services during the three-year period of the Korean War. The War was one of the most hard fought in our history.\n\nA new focal point to the Korean War Veterans Memorial on the National Mall was open to the public on July 27, 2022 — a remembrance wall featuring the names of more than 36,000 Americans who died supporting the War and over 7,100 Koreans who died while augmenting the Army.\n\nDuring the Wall of Remembrance construction, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation also rehabilitated the 25-year-old Memorial.\n\nOur newly designed website and mobile application help educate the public about the Korean War. Through education, we honor the veterans of the Korean War and the families of the fallen heroes. We hope that the Korean War is no longer the ‘Forgotten War’ but the ‘remembered victory’ that these veterans won"
