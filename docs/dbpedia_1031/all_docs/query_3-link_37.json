        "text": "As we celebrate our bicentennial, we invite you to explore our rich history, from our origins in Delaware, to our many decades as a respected military college, to the thriving, agile university we are today. The cover illustration features our 200-year anniversary logo, which combines elements of the three current alumni eras: Pennsylvania Military College, from 1892 to 1972; Widener Pioneer, from 1972 to 2006; and Widener Pride, from 2006 to the present. The bugle represents our PMC alumni, the infamous Dome of Old Main was celebrated during the Pioneer days, and the historic shield element was introduced as part of the Widener logo during the Pride era. The pictures above show the Pride lion mascots, Chester and Melrose, and Rocky the Pioneer mascot."
