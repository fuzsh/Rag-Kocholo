WickhamInsigniaDistinctive Unit Insignia\n\nUnited States Forces Korea (USFK), also known as Headquarters, U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), was established on July 1, 1957 as a subordinate-unified command of U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM). USFK is the joint headquarters through which U.S. combat forces would be sent to the South Korea/US (ROK/U.S.) Combined Forces Command’s (CFC) fighting components – the combined ground, air, naval, marine and special operations forces component commands. Major USFK elements include Eighth U.S. Army (EUSA), U.S. Air Forces Korea (Seventh Air Force) US Naval Forces Korea (CNFK), Marine Forces Korea (MARFORK), and Special Operations Command Korea (SOCKOR). USFK has Title 10 authority, which means that USFK is responsible for organizing, training and equipping U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula so that forces are agile, adaptable and ready. With 28,500 American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines in South Korea, U.S. forces in South Korea are a forward presence in the region and a key manifestation of the U.S. government’s rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific. Given the threat that North Korea poses to South Korea and the region, the USFK mission also includes planning noncombatant evacuation operations to ensure that if the need arises, U.S. and other previously agreed upon countries citizens are removed from harm’s way. To this end, USFK conducts routine exercises to ensure that this process is effective, efficient, and orderly.\n\nShoulder sleeve insignia[]\n\nDescription[]\n\nA shield-shaped embroidered device 3 1/8 inches (7.94 cm) in height and 2 1/2 inches (6.35 cm) in width overall blazoned: Azure, in chief four mullets bendwise Argent, all above a stylized American Bald Eagle, issuant from sinister base volant to dexter chief; the eagle’s body Gules surmounted by two bendlets, wider at base, of the second throughout; head of the second, eyed of the field, leg and talons of the second grasping a laurel branch and seven arrows Or. The entire shield shape is edged with a 1/16 (.16 cm) White border. Attached above the device is a designation band in Scarlet inscribed “USFK” in White letters. The entire device is edged with a 1/8 inch (.32 cm) Blue border.\n\nSymbolism[]\n\nThe shield shape reflects the United States Forces Korea’s steadfast commitment to defend the sovereignty of South Korea. The abbreviation “USFK” stands for United States Forces Korea which activated on 1 July 1957. The four stars symbolize the service and contributions of the United States army, United States Navy, United States Air Force, and the United States Marine Corps. The stylized American Bald Eagle represents cohesion and unity among the services. The laurel sprigs and arrows depict the mission of the United States Forces Korea to defeat aggression if necessary. Red, white, and blue are the colors of the flag of the United States of America. Red symbolizes hard work and honor, white represents innocence and purity, and blue refers to justice and perseverance. Yellow signifies wisdom and intuition\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe shoulder sleeve insignia was approved on 18 June 2012. (TIOH Dwg. No. A-1-1077).[1]\n\nComponents[]\n\nUS Army: 8th US Army; Headquarters: Yongsan Garrison, Korea; authorized about 20,000 Soldiers\n\nUS Air Force: 7th US Air Force; Headquarters: Osan AB, Korea; authorized about 8,000 Airmen\n\nUS Navy: Commander, Naval Forces Korea (CNFK); Headquarters: Yongsan Garrison, Korea; authorized about 300 Sailors\n\nUS Marine Corps: Marine Forces Korea (MARFORK); Headquarters: Yongsan Garrison, Korea; authorized about 100 Marines\n\nSpecial Operations Command Korea (SOCKOR): Headquarters: Camp Kim, Yongsan, Korea; authorized about 100 members\n\nMission[]\n\nSupport the United Nations Command and Combined Forces Command by coordinating and planning among US component commands; and exercise operational control of US forces as directed by US Pacific Command.\n\nUnited Nations Command and Combined Forces Command[]\n\nWhile USFK is a separate organization from United Nations Command (UNC) and CFC, its mission is to support both UNC and CFC by coordinating and planning among US component commands and providing US supporting forces to the CFC. As such, USFK continues to support the ROK-US Mutual Defense Treaty.\n\nIn response to the North Korean attack against South Korea on June 25, 1950, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) established the UNC as a unified command under the US in UNSC Resolution 84 on July 7, 1950. The UNC mission was to assist South Korea to repel the attack and restore international peace and security in Korea. Throughout the war, 53 nations provided support to the UNC; 16 nations provided combat forces and five sent medical and hospital units. After three years of hostilities, the commanders of both sides signed the Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953.\n\nHostilities today are also deterred by this bi-national defense team that evolved from the multi-national UNC. Established on November 7, 1978, CFC is the warfighting headquarters. Its role is to deter, or defeat if necessary, outside aggression against the ROK.\n\nTo accomplish that mission, the CFC has operational control over more than 600,000 active-duty military personnel of all services, of both countries. In wartime, augmentation could include some 3.5 million ROK reservists as well as additional US forces deployed from outside the ROK. If North Korea attacked, the CFC would provide a coordinated defense through its Air, Ground, Naval and Combined Marine Forces Component Commands and the Combined Unconventional Warfare Task Force. In-country and augmentation US forces would be provided to the CFC for employment by the respective combat component. The transfer of wartime control of the defense of South Korea to the South Korean government has been delayed many times with another reconsideration of the current December 2015 target date scheduled for early 2014.[2]\n\nNorth Korean threat[]\n\nKim Jong-un is the unchallenged leader of North Korea following his elections as First Chairman of the National Defense Commission (NDC), Supreme Commander of the Korean People’s Army (KPA), and First Secretary of the Korean Worker’s Party (KWP). Kim has focused on strengthening the KWP control over the government including the military. His domestic agenda has centered on revitalizing the economy and expanding education while his international focus has been on luring foreign investment, seeking international acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear state, and legitimizing his ballistic missile program. Kim is portrayed in North Korean media as a wise, caring, and natural leader similar to his grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, the nation’s founder. Although North Korean conventional capabilities continue to slowly erode due to shortfalls in equipment modernization and advanced training, they remain dangerous.\n\nAsymmetric capabilities[]\n\nNorth Korea continues to focus on asymmetric capabilities with deployments and development of new ballistic missile systems and increased emphasis on specialized light infantry/special operations forces. North Korea has a sizeable stockpile of chemical weapons with a full range of chemical agents, including nerve, blister, choking, and blood agents. It also has a biological warfare capability and possesses biological warfare production and dispensing technology. North Korea would likely use chemical weapons in a major conflict; additionally, it has sufficient quantities of chemical munitions for an extended campaign.\n\nMore importantly, North Korea views its ballistic missile programs as a source of international power and prestige, strategic deterrent, means of exerting regional and international influence, and a source of hard currency for export. Despite severe fiscal difficulties, it commits significant resources to develop and produce ballistic missiles for both deployment within North Korea and for export. Exports have been hampered due to sanctions and a weak global economy.\n\nKim Jong-un has clearly communicated intent to continue with ballistic missile testing, however the time line on future tests remain unclear. Following the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2087 Jan. 22, 2013, and UNSCR 2094 March 8, 2013, North Korea has indicated in multiple statements that it intends to bolster its strategic missile deterrent. The North Korean Foreign Ministry, NDC, KWP, and media commentaries have indicated intentions to launch multiple satellites, long-range rockets, and conduct high-level, nuclear tests.\n\nFurthermore, North Korea continues to focus on the development of its nuclear capabilities. While we assess North Korea now has several plutonium-based nuclear weapons, the development of a uranium enrichment capability could enable North Korea to produce weapons-grade uranium to support its nuclear weapons program. Although North Korea’s nuclear weapons capability is undetermined, even modest achievements could mean a more destructive capability. Concerning international cooperation, North Korea and Iran have agreed to strengthen strategic projects between the two countries, including development of nuclear program and ballistic missiles.\n\nNorth Korea is also developing formidable cyber capabilities. It has been assessed that it is conducting attacks against ROK and U.S. networks, and it continues a robust training program for cyber hackers. Additionally, North Korea has one of the world’s largest Special Operations Forces (SOF). Approximately 60,000 SOF are prepared to infiltrate the ROK by ground, air, and sea. It maintains an additional 130,000 SOF light infantry forces capable of conducting limited asymmetric operations. In 2012, North Korea completed construction on a naval base at Koampo, approximately 60 kilometers from the ROK’s Northwest Islands on the west coast. This base can accommodate up to 70 of North Korea’s hovercraft putting them approximately 30 minutes travel distance from the Northwest Islands.\n\nDespite these capabilities, North Korea’s military lags considerably behind Combined Forces Command’s advantage in technological and combined/joint capabilities. However it is still capable of offensive operations and threatens Seoul with a multitude of artillery, rocket, and missile systems. It continues improving asymmetric capabilities, with emphasis on missiles and light infantry forces, but because its ability to wage conventional war has declined over the past two decades due to a lack of resources, the regime recognizes it is not capable of prosecuting a successful reunification by force.[3]\n\nCommanders, U.S. Forces Korea[]\n\nImage Name Start End General George Decker July 1, 1957 June 30, 1959 General Carter B.

Most of these incidents took place near either the Korean Demilitarized Zone or the Northern Limit Line. This list includes engagements on land, air, and sea, but does not include alleged incursions and terrorist incidents that occurred away from the border.\n\nMany of the incidents occurring at sea are due to border disputes. The North claims jurisdiction over a large area south of the disputed western maritime border, the Northern Limit Line in the waters west of the Korean Peninsula. This is a prime fishing area, particularly for crabs, and clashes commonly occur. In addition, the North claims its territorial waters extend for 50 nautical miles (90 km) from the coast, rather than the 12 nautical miles (22 km) recognized by other countries. According to the 5 January 2011 Korea Herald, since July 1953 North Korea has violated the armistice 221 times, including 26 military attacks.[4]\n\n1950s[]\n\n16 February 1958: North Korean agents hijack a South Korean airliner to Pyongyang en route from Pusan to Seoul; 1 American pilot, 1 American passenger, 2 West German passengers, and 24 other passengers were released in early March, but 8 other passengers remained in the North.[5]\n\n1960s[]\n\nMay 1962: Private Larry Allen Abshier abandoned his post in South Korea in May 1962 when he crept away from his base and crossed the DMZ into North Korea. Lary Abshier was the first to defect. Also in May 1962, Corporal Jerry Parrish crossed the DMZ into North Korea. His reasons for defecting, according to Jenkins' autobiography The Reluctant Communist, were \"personal, and [Parrish] didn't elaborate about them much except to say that if he ever went home, his father-in-law would kill him.\"[6]\n\nAug 1962: James Joseph Dresnok was a Private First Class with a U.S. Army unit along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Soon after his arrival, he found himself facing a court martial for forging signatures on paperwork that gave him permission to leave base and which, ultimately, led to him being AWOL (Absent Without Official Leave).[7] Unwilling to face punishment, on August 15, 1962, while his fellow soldiers were eating lunch, he ran across a minefield in broad daylight into North Korean territory, where he was quickly apprehended by North Korean soldiers. Dresnok was taken by train to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and interrogated.[8]\n\n1964: North Korea creates an underground group: Revolution Party for Reunification, this group is ground down and eliminated by South Korean authorities by 1969 [9]\n\nJan 1965: Charles Jenkins, the most notable case, defected to North Korea. In South Korea, Jenkins was assigned to night patrols. As a result of fears that he would be transferred to combat duty in Vietnam, he grew depressed and anxious, and started drinking alcohol. On the night of January 4, 1965, after reportedly drinking ten beers, he set off on his nightly patrol of the Demilitarized Zone. In the early morning, he told his patrol that he was going to investigate a noise.[10] He subsequently crossed into North Korea and surrendered to forces there, in hopes of being sent to Russia and then, through prisoner exchange, eventually returned to America. Shortly thereafter, North Korean propaganda declared that a U.S. sergeant had defected, and broadcast statements allegedly made by the defector, reportedly in stilted English. The U.S. Army claimed Jenkins wrote four letters stating his intention to defect (an allegation Jenkins denies); however, the original letters are reportedly lost. His relatives maintained throughout his absence that he was abducted.[10]\n\nApril 27, 1965: Two North Korean MiG-17s attack a United States EC-121 Warning Star reconnaissance plane in the waters east of the Korean Peninsula, 80 km (50 mi) from the North Korean shore. The aircraft was damaged, but managed to land at Yokota Air Base, Japan.[11][12]\n\nJanuary 17, 1968: In an incident known as the Blue House Raid, a 31-man detachment from the Korean People's Army secretly crosses the DMZ on a mission to kill South Korean President Park Chung-hee on January 21, nearly succeeding. The incursion was discovered after South Korean civilians confronted the North Koreans and informed the authorities. After entering Seoul disguised as South Korean soldiers, the North Koreans attempt to enter the Blue House (the official residence of the President of South Korea). The North Koreans are confronted by South Korean police and a firefight ensued. The North Koreans fled Seoul and individually attempted to cross the DMZ back to North Korea. Of the original group of 31 North Koreans, 28 were killed, one was captured, and two are unaccounted for. Additionally, 68 South Koreans were killed and 66 were wounded, the majority of whom were soldiers and police officers. Three American soldiers were also killed and three were wounded.[13]\n\nJanuary 23, 1968: The United States Naval ship the USS Pueblo is boarded and captured, along with its crew, by North Korean forces in the waters east of the Korean Peninsula. The entire crew of 83 is captured, with the exception of one sailor killed in the initial attack on the vessel, and the vessel was taken to a North Korean port. All the captives were released on December 23 of the same year via the Bridge of No Return at the DMZ. The USS Pueblo is still in North Korean possession and is docked in Pyongyang and is on display as a museum ship.[14]\n\nOctober 30, 1968: From October 30 to November 2, 120 to 130 North Korean commandos land on the northeast shore of South Korea, allegedly to establish a base in order to wage a guerrilla war against the South Korean government.

A rescue operation recovered 58 survivors but 46 sailors were killed. On May 20, 2010, a South Korean led international investigation group concluded that the sinking of the warship was in fact the result of a North Korean torpedo attack.[19][20] North Korea denied involvement.[21] The United Nations Security Council made a Presidential Statement condemning the attack but without identifying the attacker.[22]\n\nNovember 23, 2010: North Korea fired artillery at South Korea's Greater Yeonpyeong island in the waters west of the Korean Peninsula and South Korea returned fire. Two South Korean marines and two South Korean civilians were killed, six were seriously wounded, and ten were treated for minor injuries. Approximately seventy South Korean houses were destroyed.[23][24][25] North Korean casualties were unknown, but Lee Hong-gi, the Director of Operations of the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), claimed that as a result of the South Korean retaliation \"there may be a considerable number of North Korean casualties\".[26]\n\nControversy[]\n\nThe Gwangju Movement and the United States\n\nThe 1980s marked a surge in Anti-Americanism in Korea, widely traced to the events of May 1980.[27] Gwangju convinced a new generation of young [Koreans] that the democratic movement had developed not with the support of Washington, as an older generation of more conservative Koreans thought, but in the face of daily American support for any dictator who could quell the democratic aspirations of the Korean people. The result was an anti-American movement in the 1980s that threatened to bring down the whole structure of American support for the ROK. American cultural centers were burned to the ground (more than once in Gwangju); students immolated themselves in protest of Reagan's support for Chun.[28] Fundamental to this movement was a perception of U.S. complicity in Chun's rise to power, and, more particularly, in the Gwangju massacre itself. These matters remain controversial. It is clear, for example, that the U.S. authorized the Korean Army's 20th Division to re-take Gwangju – as acknowledged in a 1982 letter to the New York Times by then-Ambassador Gleysteen. [General Wickham], with my concurrence, permitted transfer of well-trained troops of the twentieth R.O.K.A. Division from martial-law duty in Seoul to Gwangju because law and order had to be restored in a situation that had run amok following the outrageous behavior of the Korean Special Forces, which had never been under General Wickham's command.[29] However, as Gwangju Uprising editors Scott-Stokes and Lee note, whether the expulsion of government troops left the situation lawless or \"amok\" is very much open to dispute.\n\nIn 2002, anti-American sentiment in South Korea spiked after two U.S. soldiers in an armored vehicle accidentally hit and killed two South Korean teenage girls in the Yangju highway incident.[30]\n\nAn expansion of Camp Humphreys later in the decade saw protests, drawing thousands of South Korean citizens[31] resulting in occasional violent clashes and arrests.[32] Following a series of large protests against the U.S. and Republic of Korea governments' plan to expand Camp Humphreys and make it the main base for most U.S. troops in South Korea., residents of Daechuri and other small villages near Pyeongtaek agreed to a government settlement to leave their homes in 2006 and allow for the base expansion.[33][34] Compensation for the land averaged 600 million won (about 600,000 USD) per resident.[35]\n\nU.S. soldiers have frequently abandoned foreign wives and children; in June 2010, U.S. forces initiated a service to identify and locate the soldiers responsible.[36][37] Western princess (prostitutes servicing U.S. soldiers) have resulted in a negative image for Korean women who have relationships with American men.[37][38]\n\nExercises[]\n\nEach year the ROK, the US and a selection of Sending States from the United Nations Command participate in multiple defense-oriented, combined and joint training events designed to defend the Republic of Korea, protect the region, and maintain and increase stability on the Korean peninsula.\n\nUlchi Freedom Guardian, Key Resolve, and Foal Eagle, in addition to multiple Rehearsal of Concept (ROC) Drills, are the three theater level exercises.\n\nUlchi Freedom Guardian (UFG) is an annual simulation driven, command transformation-oriented Command Post Exercise (CPX). Elements of the ROK and US governments participate, as well as ROK and US forces from on and off the Korean peninsula. UFG integrates the annual ROK government exercise “Ulchi”, which focuses on procedures for transitioning to war, government support. Ulchi also emphasizes ROK procedures for coordination between government and military organizations from the national to local level. UFG typically incorporates the following components: a Crisis Management Exercise focused on strategic and operational decisions needed to de-escalate a crisis, or posture the command for successful execution of the appropriate OPLAN if the enemy actions dictate; a Senior Leader Seminar (SLS) designed to foster senior-level discussion on a variety of topics related to crisis management and warfighting; and a two-week Computer Assisted Exercise that exercises the transition to war, defense, and counteroffensive phases of the warfight. The exercise culminates in detailed senior leader level After-Action Reviews (AARs).\n\nKey Resolve (KR) is over the course of a two week long CFC and ROK crisis management and warfighting exercise. It provides invaluable opportunities to evaluate, train, and improves combined and joint coordination, procedures, plans and systems necessary for the conduct of contingency operations by ROK and US forces. It is a simulation driven Command Post exercise that exercises the defense of the ROK and the ability of the US to bring forces into the Theater of Operations to participate in that defense. The exercise culminates in detailed senior leader level AARs.\n\nFoal Eagle (FE) is a series of component-sponsored joint and combined Field Training Exercises (FTX) that support training of OPLAN related tasks via participation of selected off-peninsula units. FE demonstrates US power projection and rapid deployment capabilities and is conducted concurrently, but not linked to, the KR CPX. Tactical units are the primary FE FTX training audience exercising all aspects of CFC's mission; rear area security, support operations, RSOI, special operations, ground maneuver, expeditionary operations, air combat operations, and maritime operations.\n\nSee also[]\n\nMilitary of South Korea\n\nMilitary of North Korea\n\nUnited Nations Command (Korea)\n\nSpecial Operations Command Korea\n\nCommander Naval Forces Korea\n\nKATUSA (Korean Augmentation to US Army)\n\nUnited States Forces Japan (USFJ)\n\nList of United States Army installations in South Korea\n\nU.S.–South Korea Status of Forces Agreement\n\nUnited States Army Military Government in Korea (1945–1948)\n\nMutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of Korea\n\nAftermath of the Korean War\n\nDivision of Korea\n\n38th parallel north\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
