A very entertaining and informative presentation by a member of the team.\n\nKatherine (Kate) Hall has a 35-year career with the CIA in which Kate made her way from an 07 rank to lead thousands of analysts deployed around the globe.

The result was thirteen more years with CIA which included heading operations for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Her last five years in Washington D.C. were as Vice President and General Manager of BAE Systems where she headed global operations supporting several US Intelligence Agencies and the US military.\n\nFor more information, please contact Tom VanWormer at robsmom@pcisys.net and/or Steve at steve13507@gmail.com.\n\nThursday, 17 January 2019, 6 - 7:30PM - Alexandria, VA - NIP Third Thursday Social features RDML Brookes speaking on \"\"Perspectives on the Role of the Information Warfare Commander Afloat and Naval Intelligence at Fleet Cyber Command/U.S. 10th Fleet.\"\n\nNaval Intelligence Professionals kick-off their Third Thursday Social with guest speaker Rear Admiral Michael Brookes, Deputy Commander, U.S. 10th Fleet, discussing \"Perspectives on the Role of the Information Warfare Commander Afloat and Naval Intelligence at Fleet Cyber Command/U.S. 10th Fleet.\" RDML Brookes' operational tours include Imagery Intelligence Officer for VF-211 embarked aboard USS Nimitz (CVN-68); Assistant Intelligence Officer (N21) for Cruiser-Destroyer Group One, embarked aboard USS Constellation (CV-64); Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (N2) for Carrier Strike Group 7, embarked aboard USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76); Deputy Director of Intelligence (DJ2) for Joint Special Operations Command, where he deployed to Bagram, Afghanistan as Director of Intelligence (J2) for a joint special operations task force.\n\nPlease join us for camaraderie and professional insight.

Known by millions and the press as a champion of freedom and a self-appointed 'whistleblower' exposing IC activities which some saw as a violation of the civil rights of Americans. These are some of the myths surround Snowden's claims, and promoted by anti-IC minions in the press and nonprofit world. Almost all information in the public domain about Snowden is false; the vast majority of the \"Snowden narrative\" crafted, skewed, and provided by Snowden himself and swallowed whole by his media fans, never verified. Snowden has repeatedly lied about himself, his supposed expertise, the NSA, and his motivations. David Major will expose the truth about the man, his background, and the duplicity of his claims. These are essential corrections of the Snowden Myth which professionals need to know to counter continuing false claims made by Snowden and his supporters.\n\nLarry LOFTIS's presentation starts at 11 a.m.: Code Name: Liseâ€”The True Story of the Woman Who Became WWII's Most Highly Decorated Spy, by Larry Loftis recounts the story of Odette Sansom (1912-1995), a Frenchwoman living in England, wife of an Englishman and mother of 3 daughters, who was recruited into Britain's Special Operations Executive to conduct espionage in France during World War II with her commander, and yet-to-be second husband, Peter Churchill. Leaving her daughters in a convent school and with relatives, she joined the rigorous training program, becoming proficient with a wide range of weapons, learning the fine points of spycraft, and perfecting her new identity with the code name Lise. In France she proved herself fearless. Hunted by the Germans, in 1943, Odette and Peter were captured, imprisoned, and tortured. Loftis describes Odette's ordeal in grisly detail. Two lies saved her: She pretended that she and Peter were married (they would be after the war) and that Peter was related to Winston Churchill. In defeat, the Gestapo hoped to use her as a bargaining chip.\n\nWatch this brief 83-second video about the book.

One person, the spyâ€“typically a foreign national with access to informationâ€“passes it to another person, called a handler or case officer. At the heart of this activity is the relationship between the spy and his handler. This panel of former CIA case officers will explore the nature of that relationship through exploration of a variety of questions:\n\nWhat does it mean to persuade another human being to break the trust he has with his own country and work for the benefit of the United States?\n\nWhat obligations does the U.S. government have in such situations?\n\nWhat is the personal connection between spy and case officerâ€“is it totally cynical, or is there an authentic relationship?\n\nHow do we mitigate the risk to human dignity in the conduct of this intelligence activity?\n\nJoin moderator Nicholas Dujmovic (assistant professor and director of the University's Intelligence Studies and 26-year veteran of CIA, having served as an analyst, manager, editor of the President's Daily Brief, and CIA staff historian) and the following panelists for a great discussion:\n\nJohn Bennett is a former Director of the National Clandestine Service at the Central Intelligence Agency.

This presentation, based upon the speaker's first book Most Secret and Confidential: Intelligence in the Age of Nelson, gives a close look at the methods used to obtain and analyze secret material and deliver it to operational forces during the Great Age of Fighting Sail. The British experience from 1793 to 1815 is the main focus, but it also includes French and American activity. In addition, it examines how commanders used the information to develop strategy and tactics and winâ€”or sometimes loseâ€”battles. And, it informs on how Vice Admiral Lord Nelson and his associates dealt with intelligence obstacles and how the outcomes affected their own futures and, in some cases, the history of the modern world.\n\nSteve Maffeo retired in 2008 as a Navy captain Ã¢Â€Â“ after 30 years (both enlisted and commissioned) in the Colorado Army National Guard, the U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Naval Reserve. His last three assignments were as the commanding officer of reserve shore-based units supporting the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Joint Intelligence Center Pacific, and the National Defense Intelligence College. Steve then retired in 2015 as the Associate Library Director at the U.S. Air Force Academy. He holds a B.A. (English) from the University of Colorado; an M.A. (Library Science) from the University of Denver; and an M.S. (Strategic Intelligence) from the U.S. National Defense Intelligence College. His civilian career was for the most part as a library administrator. He's worked at Martin-Marietta Aerospace, the University of Northern Colorado; the U.S. Naval War College; and the Aurora (Colo.) Public Library.\n\nSteve has published several journal and encyclopedia articles as well as four books: Most Secret and Confidential: Intelligence in the Age of Nelson; Seize, Burn, or Sink: The Thoughts and Words of Vice Admiral Lord Nelson; The Perfect Wreck: \"Old Ironsides\" and HMS JavaÃ¢Â€Â”A Story of 1812; and U.S. Navy Codebreakers, Linguists, and Intelligence Officers against Japan: 1910-1941.\n\nFor more information and to reserve a seat, please contact Steve at steve13507@gmail.com.\n\nFriday, 22 March 2019, 2 - 3:15 pm - Washington, DC - From Syria to Venezuela: From Crisis to Conflict, Presentation by Joseph Humire at the Daniel Morgan Graduate School\n\nMr. Humire will discuss the roots of the Venezuelan crisis, its geopoltical complexity and potential solutions that the US and the international community might pursue.\n\nJoseph M.

The brief captures many major challenges by recommending classic Estimative Intelligence Methodologies in Annual Regional and Country Geopolitical Formats for regular review by senior national security staffs thus facilitating the demand for Special Estimates and Crisis Scenario Development during emerging crises. The absence of these finished intelligence products exponentially increases the liabilities of risk management and miscalculation exactly at a time when leaders demand accuracy in assessing adversary intentions in a complex world.\n\nGail Nelson, Ph.D. a veteran DOD Intelligence Officer, received his Political Science BA at California State College, Long Beach, in 1966 and completed doctoral work at the University of Colorado in 1979. His career assignments include US Army Europe, US Air Forces Europe, and US European Command specializing in Russian and East European Geopolitical Affairs. He later was appointed Senior Advisor to the Afghan Chief of Military Intelligence; and performed similar responsibilities in the Philippines and Iraq. His published monographs explore the Political Psychology of Nazi Genocide; Soviet Defense Decision Making; Warsaw Pact Crisis Management; and biographies on Security & Intelligence leaders.

When motivated by a sense of imminent success, apocalyptic-millennial movements move into active phase. The most dangerous of all these movements are those which believe in an active cataclysmic scenario (we are the agents of the necessary and massive destruction of evil that will clear the path), leading to an imperial millennial dream (we will rule the world). Currently Global Jihad represents one of the largest and most dangerous of all such movements known in history. The current ignorance of Westerners about this dimension of the problem and its dynamics constitutes a major weakness in our ability to resist. Worse, certain Western responses enable this movement.\"\n\nDr. Landes taught history at Boston University for 25 years and was Director and co-founder of the Center for Millennial Studies.

He spent 444 days until January 1981 as a \"guest\" of the Ayatollah Khomeini, who had replaced the Iranian monarchy with an Islamic Republic in March 1979. It was the longest hostage crisis in recorded history. Bill will speak to his experiences as a hostage.\n\nBiography: William (Billy) Gallegos was born in Pueblo, Colorado. His Marine Corps career started in 1977. He attended Marine Corps Depot in San Diego, CA. He was then assigned to Marine Security Guard Battalion in Quantico, VA. Upon graduation from Marine Security Guard school he was assigned to the American Embassy Tehran, Iran. Upon his release from captivity, Sgt. William Gallegos completed his military enlistment and was honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps. During his military service he earned numerous military awards including the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Prisoner of War Medal, Good Conduct Medal and the Department of State Award for Valor. Upon his discharge, he returned to Colorado where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice and Criminology from Metropolitan State University in Denver, Colorado.\n\nBill Gallegos then began a career in law enforcement as a Denver Sheriff and joined the Denver Police Department in 1994. His assignments with the Denver Police Department include street patrol officer, Vice and Narcotics and Denver police Intelligence unit where he was on loan to the Federal Bureau of Investigation/Joint Terrorism Task Force from 2004 to 2018. His police awards include numerous commendations as well as three Denver Police Distinguished Service Crosses and a Purple Heart. He retired from law enforcement in November 2018.\n\nPlease contact steve13507@gmail.com for more information.\n\nThursday, 18 July 2019, 9:30 - 11 am - Washington, DC - \"Political Transition in Central Asia\" Panel at the Daniel Morgan Graduate School\n\nCentral Asia is undergoing a period of profound transformations. Islam Karimov, who ruled Uzbekistan from 1989, died in office in 2016. His successor former Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev has embarked on a series of reforms to create a more efficient bureaucracy, attract investment, soften repression and rebuild ties with neighboring states.\n\nKazakhstan's first President Nursultan Nazarbayev resigned in March 2019. Zhomart Toqaev, his anointed successor, called a snap election on June 8th, winning with over 70% of the vote. But citizens have reacted angrily to perceived political stagnation with over 1000 arrested in protests around the country.\n\nTajikistan, the region's poorest state is also looking toward transition. President Emomali Rahmon, in power since 1992, appears to be grooming his son Rustam for power; presidential elections are scheduled for 2020. This comes at a time of instability in the country, with over thirty killed in a prison riot in May.\n\nThese ongoing developments are interlinked and pose questions around the sustainability of post-Soviet models of authoritarian governance in the region. To discuss these developments, Daniel Morgan Graduate School and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) will assemble a roundtable of experts who follow the region closely.\n\nSpeakers:Torokul Doorov, Director of RFE/RL's Kazakh Service; Salimjon Aioubov, Acting Director of RFE/RL's Tajik Service; Alisher Syddiq, Director of RFE/RL's Uzbek Service; Erica Marat, Associate Professor, College of International Security Affairs, National Defense University.

Our afternoon speaker will be from 1300 Ã¢Â€Â“ 1430 with adjournment by 1500. Our morning presenter is Peggy Adler. Peggy has served as AFIO/NE chapter president for 3 years and as program coordinator for 8 years She is also a recipient of AFIO National's coveted General Stilwell Award presented in 2001. Peggy's topic covers the Richard Brenneke October Surprise where in 1991, she was retained by self-proclaimed ex-CIA agent, arms dealer and money launderer, Richard Brenneke, to co-author his autobiography. Discovering evidence in his files contradicting claims regarding his presence at October Surprise conspiracy meetings, she contacted former CIA analyst-turned-journalist, Frank Snepp. This evidence was the basis of Snepp's February 1992 article for the Village Voice which outed Brenneke as a con artist. Adler worked with Snepp on additional articles for the \"Voice\" which went on to prove that the so-called \"October Surprise\" was a hoax. Adler's work was also the subject of a chapter in Robert Parry's book, Trick or Treason: The October Surprise Mystery and she was interviewed by PBS' Frontline in this regard for an episode which aired in April 1992. In mid-1992, learning that the House October Surprise Task Force was investigating whether or not there actually had been an October Surprise, she contacted investigative journalist and author Steven Emerson, who put her in touch with the Task Force so that she could turn over to them the seventy cartons of documents she had hauled east from Brenneke's home in Portland, Oregon, in order to write his memoirs. Subsequently, she worked as a consultant to the Task Force, and assisted in drafting and editing the Brenneke section of their final report.\n\nOur afternoon presenter is Damien Cregeau. Mr. Cregeau's one-hour PowerPoint presentation, \"Spies, Lies, and Alibis: Spying and Tradecraft During the American Revolution,\" will focus on the espionage efforts in and around New York City, including the Major Benjamin Tallmadge's Culper Ring and the Dayton Ring run by Colonel Elias Dayton. It will also include an analysis of the failed Captain Nathan Hale operation as well as the successful counterintelligence efforts regarding the failed Tory plot to capture or kill Generals George Washington and Israel Putnam. The talk will also look briefly at the special invisible ink developed by Sir James Jay, brother of John Jay, as well as two common misunderstandings regarding the treachery of Major General Benedict Arnold. Finally, there will be a brief look at the unheralded efforts of Sgt. Daniel Bissell, a Continental Army soldier who posed as a deserter to operate behind British lines. Damien earned his bachelor's in history from Hillsdale College and his master's in history from Colorado State. After teaching history at preparatory schools for several years he became an independent historian. He is a scholar of the American Revolution specializing in espionage of the era. He has spoken on spies in the Revolution since 2007 at the FBI's New York Office, the Fraunces Tavern Museum in New York City, as well as to historical societies and organizations throughout the northeast, including Boston, Vermont and New Hampshire. He serves as president of the Connecticut Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He has been published in seven historical journals, including Leatherneck Magazine, Financial History, the Journal of the American Revolution and the DAR's American Spirit. He and his wife own two homes from 1765 in Connecticut: a private's house in Wethersfield and the General Jedediah Huntington House in Norwich.
