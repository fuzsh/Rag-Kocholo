Biography[Edit][]

Ella Fitzgerald had a difficult and poor youth. She was the year for her big break even homeless. She was discovered at an amateur contest in the fall of 1934 in the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. Chick Webb then took her in his Orchestra, and thus amassed Fitzgerald her fame. With him she took from 1935 for Decca Records plates on, of which her adaptation of the children's song A-Tisket, A-Tasket a hit . When Webb died in 1939, the Orchestra was renamed Ella Fitzgerald and her Famous Orchestra, with moderate success.

Fitzgerald decided to go solo In 1941, because they are too young and too inexperienced was for leading the old fashioned big band that slowly out of fashion began to hit. She chose her repertoire since then less and less from bebop swing and more out, the latter especially because they toured with Dizzy Gillespie and the master-bebopper well-known bandleader Duke Ellington.

During this period she continued to record for Decca, which offered her a bad and limited repertoire. Thereby she could hardly grow as a singer.Concertimpresario Norman Granz (also founder of Clef and Norgran labels ) started in 1949 to her out of the stifling regime of Decca and her for his own labels. However, Fitzgerald's contract ran until 1956, but from 1949 she performed in the touring concert series on Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic ,.

In 1955, she played in a movie with Peggy Lee, Pete Kelly's Blues, and then she signed at Granz ' Verve Records, where she completed her well-known songbooks with music of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen and Duke Ellington. Of these albums is strictly speaking only the last jazz. Her career took a flight from 1956 and left Fitzgerald work with a variety of artists such as, Roy Eldridge, Oscar Peterson, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, Nelson Riddle, Joe Williams, and many others.

Norman Granz sold Verve label In 1960, but he remained Fitzgeralds personal manager. Fitzgerald remained successful recording, although they now deserved to go with enough pension . She performed again in a movie: Let No Man Write My Epitaph, but which was not a success.

In 1963, 1964 and 1965 Fitzgerald worked with Roy Eldridge and Tommy Flanagan Trio, then with the Duke Ellington Orchestra in 1965, 1966 and 1967. In the meantime, she recorded many singles on, Can't Buy Me Love which became a hit. Other singles, such as I'm A Poached Egg and We Three, the last of which is actually a duet with himself, were not as a great success.

In 1966 ran off the contract with Verve, and Fitzgerald went freelance work. This resulted in a number of recordings of country-and-western music and spitituals, in order to draw the younger crowd, something a lot of jazz lovers are surprised about. They made some-by the critics less esteemed-trips to theSunny pop music (and I Heard It Through the Grapevine ).

In 1972 to Fitzgeralds comeback in the jazz scene. This was the plate Jazz at the Santa Monica Civic, with Count Basie and Tommy Flanagan. After this she signed at Norman Granz ' Pablonew label. They brought there from 1973 to 1989 plates out. The best of these are the four albums with Joe Pass, two with Basie and a number of live performances at the Montreux Jazz Festival.

Fitzgerald got from 1970 to contend with the effects of diabetes, which resulted in blindness. Her voice remained until the early 1980s, vital, but went from 1984 strong backwards. Her latest record, with saxophonistBenny Carter, who had discovered her in 1934, gives here demonstrate. France Gall In 1987 made a song about her yet: Ella, elle l'a Kate Ryan in 2008, where a renewed version of. In 1989 or 1990 would not another plate, which Fitzgerald was released.

Her very last recording dates back to 1991, when they for the Setting Sun the Japanese movie soundtrack inzong. The end of 1992, she had her last public appearances. Although she was asked in 1993 for a duet on an album by Frank Sinatra, remained them live at home in Beverly Hills. Due to diabetes in 1993 both her lower legs had to be amputated. During the 1990s they experienced more effects of diabetes, to which they also would die eventually in 1996 at the age of 79.
