        "text": "Born:\n\n25th April 1917 in Newport News, Virginia, USA.\n\nElla Fitzgerald’s grave in Inglewood\n\nDied:\n\n15th June 1996 in Beverly Hills, California, USA.\n\nBuried:\n\nInglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California, USA.\n\nSome great singles.\n\nA Tisket A Tasket (1938).\n\nOh, Lady Be Good! (1947).\n\nMac the Knife (1960).\n\nHow High is the Moon (1960).\n\nPlus many more!\n\nSome great albums:\n\nThe Complete Recordings 1935–39.\n\nThe Complete Songbooks (1956–1964).\n\nElla at the Opera House (1957).\n\nElla in Berlin (1960).\n\nJazz at Santa Monica ’72 (1972).\n\nElla in London (1974).\n\nThe Best Is Yet to Come (1982).\n\nNice Work If You Can Get It (1983).\n\nAll That Jazz (1989).\n\nPlus many more!\n\nSome interesting facts:\n\nShe was one of the greatest jazz singers ever! In fact, she is often called the “First Lady of Song”.\n\nShe also sang other types of music, such as popular music.\n\nShe didn’t really write any of her own songs. Instead she sang songs by other people in a new and great way. The main exception to this ‘A Tisket A Tasket’ which she helped to write.\n\nShe made some great albums with other great jazz artists such as Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Louis Armstrong.\n\nShe recorded her singing over period of almost 60 years!\n\nUnlike a lot of jazz artists, Ella Fitzgerald was very shy.\n\nIn the beginning she wanted to dance more than sing. In fact she entered a talent competition in 1934 and was going to dance. However when she saw some good dancers perform before her, she decided to sing instead—and won the competition! There was no thoughts of dancing after that!!\n\nShe became very good at &#8216scat singing’ (this is a type of singing that uses nonsense syllables, instead of words).\n\nIn her recording of ‘Mac the Knife’ on the album ‘Ella in Berlin’ she started scat singing because she had forgotten the words! This turned out to be one of her great recordings!!\n\nOfficial Website\n\nHere is a video of Ella Fitzgerald singing Angel Eyes.\n\nElla Fitzgerald singing ‘Angel Eyes’\n\nAnd here is a video of an older Ella Fitzgerald singing St Louis Blues.\n\nElla Fitzgerald singing ‘St Louis Blues’\n\nPicture credits:\n\nElla Fitzgerald.
