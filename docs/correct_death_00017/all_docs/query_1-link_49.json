        "text": "Ella Fitzgerald, who died in 1996, lived in Yonkers on School Street for part of her childhood in the 1920s.\n\nYonkers will honor the centennial of Ella Fitzgerald's birthday on Tuesday by celebrating the jazz singer's local roots and her music.\n\nThe Friends of the Yonkers Public Library will present \"Queen of Jazz,\" a free, all-ages program with musical performances, a short film highlighting her life and a birthday cake decorated with her image.\n\nFitzgerald, who died in 1996, lived in Yonkers on School Street for part of her childhood in the 1920s. In honor of that connection, there is a statue of Fitzgerald next to the Yonkers Station downtown.\n\nBy the early 1930s, she moved to Harlem after her mother's death and made her stage debut at one of the Apollo Theater's amateur nights in 1934 at the age of 17. By 1936, she made her first recording.\n\nAlthough Fitzgerald represents a long-gone era unfamiliar to many of the children who frequent the Yonkers Public Library, the event organizers said they want to educate children and adults about Yonkers' history.\n\n\"We hope that we can teach and show them what an important figure she was,\" said Eric Schoen, president of the Friends of the Yonkers Public Library.\n\nSchoen said many young people are only familiar with pop music stars from Yonkers like Mary J. Blige or DMX.\n\n\"They think these are the only musicians from Yonkers, but there was an important jazz musician that came out of Yonkers,\" he said.\n\nFitzgerald's accomplishments are significant. In her more than 50-year career, she recorded more than 200 albums and about 2,000 songs, according to the Ella Fitzgerald Foundation, which is also celebrating her centennial.\n\nRecognition for her musical accomplishments include 14 Grammy Awards and the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded by President George H. W. Bush.\n\nThe event runs from 4 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. on the second floor in the Small Peopleâ€™s Place at the Riverfront branch, 1 Larkin Center.\n\nTwitter: @ErnieJourno\n\nMore Yonkers news\n\nVIDEO: Mall to begin roof collapse fix\n\nLIBRARY: Vote set for $1.8 million renovation of Will library\n\nPOLITICS: Yonkers Brewing co-owner running for City Council\n\nNOISE: Yonkers adopts new rock crushing hours"
