Ella Jane Fitzgerald was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz, and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a "horn-like" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing. After tumultuous teenage years, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with performances on many stages in the Harlem New York area.

Yet did you know that in 1993, she had to have both of her legs amputated below the knee due to the effects of diabetes and her eyesight was affected as well?

In 1996, tired of being in the hospital, she wished to spend her last days at home. Confined to a wheelchair, she spent her final days in her backyard of her Beverly Hills mansion in Los Angles California. "I just want to smell the air and listen to the birds" she reportedly said. On her last day, she was wheeled outside one last time, and sat there for about an hour. When she was taken back in, she looked up with a soft smile on her face and said, "I'm ready to go now." She died in her home on June 15, 1996 at the age of 79.

Her story hit close to home for me, since I too escaped two leg amputations and I am currently partially disabled.
