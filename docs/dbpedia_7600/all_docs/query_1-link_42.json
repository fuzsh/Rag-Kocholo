The journal intends to revive a critical discussion on the auteurs, celebrate new directors and accented cinema, and examine Italy as a geo-cultural locus for contemporary debate on translocal cinema.",

        "text": "This is an exploratory article engaging with an advertisement that appeared on the billboards of Milan’s metro network in December 2017. Investigating discourse as the prominent site for identifying the ideological assumptions embedded in language use and the existing social conventions emerging from them, the author argues that the use or frequency of sexist stereotypes does not necessarily mark a brand’s alignment with sexism. The methodology adopted is a form of Bakhtinian stylistics, i.e., an analysis of texts with a view to evaluate the addressivity and answerability of utterances and investigate their heteroglossic and interindividual nature as well as their positioning within a specific community, time and place. Based on a constructionist and critical sociolinguistics matrix, this study focuses on style meant as the particular ways an individual uses language as social practice through which ideological assumptions emerge."
