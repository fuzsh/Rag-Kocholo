        "text": "Photo by Chiara Meierhofer Muscar\n\nAs the name suggests, Italian brutal death metal outfit Fulci has dedicated its music to the movies of Lucio Fulci, the director who made a series of gory horror films in the late 1970s and 1980s amid a long career of hack work in comedy, spaghetti westerns, softcore “erotica” and giallo. The sensationalistic, clumsily executed bloody violence of those horror flicks is not always without wit; see especially the notorious zombie vs shark sequence in Zombi 2 (1979). But mostly Fulci’s work is marked by the sort of moist, trashy schlock for which some death metal freaks have unslakable appetites. It might be a match made in a specific iteration of subcultural heaven, if Duck Face Killings weren’t so irredeemably repugnant and reactionary.\n\nMusically, there’s not much to complain about in Fulci’s sound. It’s competent, up-tempo brutal death metal, with compositions often oriented in the direction of slam’s knuckleheaded pleasures. What sets Fulci apart is its concept, and the band has gone deep this time, making a record devoted to the director’s most execrable horror movie, The New York Ripper (1982). Song titles might give you a sense for the record’s vibe: “Morbid Lust,” “Fucked with a Broken Bottle,” “Stabbed, Gutted, and Loved.” Set around the porn and sex-work clubs, bookstores and theaters of New York’s 42nd Street, pre-Giuliani-time, the movie features a serial killer who talks, quacks and squeals like Donald Duck. The narrative is as incoherent as it is insipid, the visual effects are unconvincing but mean spirited and none of the actors appears to have much interest in the characters they are alleged to portray. This reviewer can attest to those facts—he has seen the flick so you do not have to.\n\nFulci’s movie is more moronic than cynical—but it’s pretty cynical, a fantasia of misogyny barely dressed up in motley, as slasher-horror and as psychologically driven police-procedural. Mostly it just wants to subject a series of more or less interchangeable young blonde women to meaty violence, with switchblades, straight razors and (yep) broken bottles. But the array of characters and scenarios is not entirely adrift from some very pressing social realities: that sex work is an industry, and a massively profitable one; that unregulated sex work can too frequently be enormously dangerous for the workers; that those dangers manifest in horrific violence and in asymmetrical confrontations with indifferent or outright hostile structures of public morality and law enforcement. Early in the movie, our sort-of protagonist, homicide detective Fred Williams (Jack Hedley), notes, “Eleven people a day are murdered here in Fun City, and over half of them are women.” But he delivers the line with smug dismissiveness.\n\nFulci the band uses a different voice from The New York Ripper to start the record; pathologist Barry Jones (Giordano Falzoni) describes the serial killer’s stabbing of one of the women this way: “He used a blade. Stuck it up her joy trail. Split her wide open. He could have done a slightly better job if he’d had more time. But overall, it was a good, efficient butchery.” It’s a familiar move in death metal, which previous (and odious) bands like Jig-Ai and Gut took to far greater extremes decades ago. What’s troubling is the sheer persistence of these tropes and symbolics, the tenacity of the hate and of the eyebrow-waggling sensationalism the bands and their fans use to justify it, inasmuch as some of them feel any need to do so.\n\nIt’s by turns depressing and exasperating. Fulci the band deploys a different variety of apologia for its symbolic violence, a sort of anti-hipster hipness, a knowledge of semi-obscure mass culture that plays in areas that feel (at least to some) vaguely dangerous or scandalous. But The New York Ripper ends up reifying the established, traditional libidinal-economic relations that make sex work so dangerous, and the band’s celebration of the film couldn’t be further from anything substantively transgressive. It requires no courage to vilify sex workers. Official culture—cops, priests, politicians and the rhetorics of moral rectitude they love to mouth—encourages us to do so.\n\nWant to do something really shocking? Make a metal record about unionizing sex workers. Write a song for each of the 321 sex workers murdered in the US and Puerto Rico between 2012 and 2020 (see the data in the 2024 study published in The Journal of Forensic Sciences). Then write another song noting that such data are massively underreported; maybe call it “No Humans Involved.” Make a benefit record to fund the more careful and comprehensive collection of such data world-wide. That would really freak people out. Isn’t that what transgressive culture is for?\n\nJonathan Shaw"
