I often glance through them looking for South Asian/Muslim sounding names. For a long time, I would mostly have luck in animation, graphics and sounds section. Occasionally I would see them in the cast for supporting roles, and often these were stereotypical roles - your casual convenience store owner, taxi driver or more commonly, a peace-disturbing individual. But the tide is changing now. These familiar names are now appearing more - in the main cast in mainstream movies and even in movie direction. Some have made it and are now opening doors for others. That is why I am so excited for Voices of Muslim Women Foundation's next event, ‚ÄúMaking It‚Äù where we get a chance to experience the journey with two film industry superstars. Aliza Vellani, actress and producer, and Kashif Pasta, director, writer and producer, are sitting down together for the first time to give us a glimpse. If you are in the Lower Mainland, interested in film or arts, or need some inspiration to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù in the industry, join us on Feb 25 in Riverport Cinemas in Richmond for a movie, some snacks and an interesting discussion. Tickets are at https://lnkd.in/gCyDiBKy and only $20 if you use our Promocode VMWFilm #representationmatters #womenempowerment #film #womeninfilm\n\nExcited to share that I am hiring a Senior Financial Analyst for my team!
