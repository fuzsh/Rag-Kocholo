        "text": "Kevin Costner is back in action hero mode in the first trailer for the McG-directed thriller “3 Days to Kill.”\n\nThe 58-year-old actor plays an elite assassin tasked with watching his teenage daughter (Hailee Steinfeld) the same week he learns he only has three days left to live — unless he kills a bunch of people for the agency he’s trying to quit, spearheaded by a mysterious blonde (Amber Heard), in exchange for an experimental drug that might save his life.\n\nSee video: Kevin Costner, Denis Leary Take ESPN Behind the Scenes of Football Movie ‘Draft Day’\n\nDespite all of the danger, it appears that Costner’s character still tries to pack in plenty of bonding time with his daughter.\n\nIn one scene, she calls him to say she wants to make spaghetti for dinner and needs his help. Luckily, he’s holding a real, live Italian man hostage, so he knows exactly where to go for a good recipe.\n\n“3 Days to Kill” hits theaters on Feb. 21."
