        "text": "The allure of French Polynesia is intoxicating. It’s the beat of pahu drums, the smell of tiaré flowers on the wind, the vivid blues of the sea, and swaying palms with a breeze that ever-so-perfectly tickles your skin.\n\nHere, days may range from those on a lounge chair, ordering another rum punch, to ones spent trekking past coconut trees in the presence of Ancient Polynesian temples. You may even surf the region's infamous waves—however you choose to divide your time, French Polynesia has decidedly more to offer than most people give it credit for. (No wonder Marlon Brando was so enamored he bought an entire atoll here in the ’60s—it's now home to the dreamy Brando resort.)\n\nThis diversity of experiences is a large part of what drew me to plan a trip, yet determining what to pack for French Polynesia was another story. With such a rich itinerary, and little puddle-jumper planes the go-to mode of transportation from one island to the next (translation: it’s a real headache for everyone if you overpack), knowing what to bring and what to wear each day was an art I had to refine in real time. Plus, when visiting such a bucket list destination, getting your packing plan on lock is simply due diligence.\n\nNow as I close my suitcase, leaving The Brando's Tetiaroa after jaunts in Bora Bora and Tahiti as well, I’ve learned a thing or two about how to pack for French Polynesia—especially if you’re hopping between more than 1 of the 118 islands, which most travelers are. Below are the outfits I wore again and again, strategically missing the block heels and long skirt that withered at the back of my suitcase. Oh and don’t worry: A desire to look half as fabulous as these sceneries was always in the back of my mind, especially since every inch of land is worth documenting—your camera will be out at all times.\n\nWhere I stayed:\n\nJump to:\n\nOutfits\n\nToiletries\n\nAccessories\n\nOutfits for daily excursions\n\nOn most islands, including Tetiaroa, a mix of water and land excursions are on offer. I learned to always wear a bathing suit under my clothes—the opportunity to get in the water usually manifests—and to lean into waterproof shoes (why risk getting your nice leather sandals soggy?). Bathing suits should fit well, so you can dive off the back of a boat without your bikini top sliding around, but opt for looser clothes, especially if you’re asking for a sunburn or visiting during the sticky summer.\n\nFor exploration by land\n\nFor snorkeling and scuba adventures\n\nFor boat tours\n\nFor grabbing lunch\n\nFor dinner at the resort\n\nFor hikes (and the gym)\n\nFor travel days\n\nMust-pack toiletries\n\nWhen it comes to toiletries, the best hotels in French Polynesia are going to have big dispensers of fabulous shampoo and conditioner, and maybe even reef-safe sunscreen and bug spray. But with so much exposure to sun, sand, and sea, it's nice to make sure you have products you know you love, easily on hand—and remember, the spaciousness of island resorts means you don't want to be running back to your room every hour for something.\n\nFor your day-bag\n\nFor your Dopp kit\n\nOther essentials\n\nYou really could just pack a bikini and pareo and call it a day—but hey, if you're already filling a suitcase, a few creature comforts can't hurt. You're already in paradise, why not make sure you have the exact things you need to settle in?"
