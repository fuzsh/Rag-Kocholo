Examines techniques and strategies used to construct films, including mise-en-scène, editing, sound, and the orchestration of film techniques in larger formal systems. Surveys some of the contextual factors shaping individual films and our experiences of them (including mode of production, genre, authorship, and ideology). No previous experience with film studies is required.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2023, Fall 2022, Fall 2021, Fall 2020.\n\nWhat does it mean when we say that we live in the age of media? First, we will examine some of the classical theoretical texts that define the study of media and look at new forms of modern mass media that emerged in the twentieth century, such as radio and television. Later, we will look more closely at our contemporary world of computerized media and information technology, including software and social media. Throughout the course, we will examine the factors that influence media as well as the ways in which media influences society and individuals. Texts include films by Jordan Peele, Ryan Coogler, Allan J. Pakula, Sidney Lumet, and Billy Wilder, students’ students’ own social media practices, and theoretical texts by Marshall McLuhan, Friedrich Kittler, and Alexander R. Galloway.

Explores the dramatic cultural, political, and physical transformations that Berlin underwent during the twentieth century and thereby illustrates the central role that Berlin played, and continues to play, in European history and culture, as well as in the American cultural imagination. For each time period studied, compares Anglo-American representations of Berlin with those produced by German artists and writers, and investigates how, why, and to what extent Berlin has retained its status as one of the most quintessentially modern cities in the world. No knowledge of German is required. Note: Fulfills the non-US cinema requirement for cinema studies minors. (Same as: GER 1152)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2020.\n\nFrom silent films (which were always accompanied with music and were therefore never really “Silent”) to today’s computer enhanced blockbusters, music has always been an integral part of cinema, allowing for suspension of disbelief, establishing mood and emotion, and cogenerating narrative. Through lectures and film viewings, discussion sections, small group projects, and readings (hyperlinked to movie clips), students in this course will gain the ability to critically analyze the musical language of cinema and understand how its related aesthetics, technology, and economics have changed over the last 100 years. Films studied will include works scored by Desplat, Herrmann, Junkie XL, Korngold, Ligeti, Public Enemy, Raskin, Simon, Tamar-Kali, Vangelis, and Williams.

(Same as: ASNS 2075, ENVS 2475)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2021.\n\nHow has Hollywood treated Asia and Asians? To what extent have Hollywood film productions engaged in either erotic fascination or racial prejudice, when presenting Asia as a cinematic setting and Asians as a cultural other? Examining Hollywood’s imaginative visions of the east, the course takes students on an exploratory journey from classic Hollywood films to contemporary blockbusters. Issues may include race and stardom in \"Shanghai Express\", yellowface in \"Good Earth\", the exotic Asian female in \"The World of Suzie Wong\", stereotypes of Tibetans in \"Seven Years in Tibet\", and an American’s perception of Tokyo in\" Lost in Translation\". We will also explore the Orientalist imagination through sexualized Geisha or masculinized Mulan as well as transnational crossings in the animated film \"Kungfu Panda\". In addition to analyzing themes and the social-cultural implications of films, the course also introduces students to the cinematic language: mise-en-scene, cinematography, and editing. Counts toward the major in Asian studies and the minor in cinema studies. (Same as: ASNS 2900)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2024, Spring 2022.\n\nThe onset of COVID-19 has led to anxiety and fear in our daily lives. The spread of this infectious disease and its destructive power prompts us to look to the film screen for ways we might comprehend the urgent subject confronting us. In considering how cinema has treated pandemics, the course will exam a number of thematic categories through cinematic articulations. The topics include but are not limited to: pandemics in history, the politics of pandemics, the fantasy or horror of pandemics, pandemics in Asia, and pandemics and animals. A carefully chosen roster of films include: The Seventh Seal, Outbreak and Contagion, The Flu that Killed 50 Million, Casandra Crossing, the South Korean productions of Flu and The Train to Busan, as well as 28 Days Later and Twelve Monkeys. The course meets the requirement for a major or minor in Asian studies, as well as the minor in cinema studies. (Same as: ASNS 2078)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2023, Spring 2021.\n\nAsian Americans have often been portrayed as the stereotyped other by both American cinema and mainstream media. This course presents an alternative vision and a counter-cinema: films directed by Asian American filmmakers, about Asian American experiences, and from Asian American perspectives. Themes and genres addressed include the family melodrama, the coming-of-age story, transnational migration, diasporic border-crossing, processes of racialization, and gender and sexual politics. We will explore how Asian American films recast images of Asian Americans through first-person narratives, how racial difference is reclaimed from white-centric imaginations, and how Asian American cinema as a communal practice negotiates sociocultural and institutional hegemonies. At the heart of the course is the building of an Asian American spectatorship whereby Asian Americans can view themselves on their own terms. This course is part of the college-wide Asian American initiative in 2023-2024. This course fulfills the non-US cinema and the film theory requirements for Cinema Studies minors (Same as: ASNS 2081)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2023.\n\nThis course will survey the history of modern Central America, from the Nicaraguan revolution and the Salvadoran and Guatemalan armed conflicts, through film. In addition, this class will examine broader region-wide experiences such as the ownership of the Panama Canal and the assassination of key figures in Central America including Berta Cáceres in Honduras. Mainly through a variety of film genres, including historical drama, adaptations, and documentaries, this course will analyze the role of the United States in Central America, including the long history of military occupation in Nicaragua, the CIA-backed coup in Guatemala in 1954, and the financial aid provided to El Salvador and Guatemala during their civil wars. Finally, this course will explore the legacy of the violence from the twentieth century in the present. As a result, this class will address key topics such as transitional justice, migration, gangs, drug trafficking and organized crime, gender relationships, and neopopulism. (Same as: LACL 2352)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2023.\n\nHow does the figure of the teen mobilize different ideologies of gender, sexuality, and queerness in various genres of film? How do contemporary sociocultural circumstances affect the creation, reception, and interpretation of teen films produced throughout the decades? In this course, students will examine how different films frame, approach, and at times misrepresent adolescent experience. Students will explore how understandings of adolescence, gender, and sexuality have shifted over the decades, how teen sexuality is visually aestheticized, and how representations of gender and teen sexuality are inflected by other domains of identity such as race and class. In addition to learning how to “close read” these films, taking notions such as editing, sound, form, and style into consideration, students will explore and apply queer and feminist frameworks to unlock innovative and politically viable ways of critiquing these so-called vapid and uncritical cultural productions. Attendance at weekly evening screenings is mandatory. (Same as: GSWS 2320)\n\nPrerequisites: GSWS 1000 - 2969 or GSWS 3000 or higher or CINE 1000 - 2969 or CINE 3000 or higher.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2022, Fall 2020.\n\nA consideration of the diverse production contexts and political circumstances influencing cinema history in the sound era.

Attendance at weekly evening screenings is required.\n\nPrerequisites: CINE 1101 or CINE 2201 or CINE 2202.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2021.\n\nExamines a diverse range of nonfiction media from past to present. Films will be read as both discrete works of cinema and as socio-political objects. In addition to surveying milestones from the global documentary tradition and emergent digital practices, this course also explores works that use nonfiction footage in ways distinct from popular modes of documentary, such as city symphonies and found footage films, as well as more prosaic nonfiction modes such as newsreels, propaganda, and science films. The course pursues several related modes of inquiry: What aesthetic techniques have filmmakers employed to represent reality? How have filmmakers and scholars theorized documentary practice and ethics? And how has nonfiction filmmaking been conceived of as ideologically “useful”? This is accomplished through close readings of film and written texts, in-class discussion, written responses, and longer analytical papers. Fulfills the film theory requirement for cinema studies minors. Attendance at weekly evening screenings is required.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2022.\n\nConcentrating in large part on the classical Hollywood period, we will explore films that center on women's experiences and that are (or seem to be) intended for a female audience. We will examine the genres of melodrama, film noir, gothic, and comedy in relation to the performance of female identity; representations of gender, class, race, and sexuality; and theories of spectatorial identification. The last part of the class will consider ways in which contemporary women’s films draw on and reconfigure the themes brought up by earlier narratives. Directors might include Arzner, Cukor, Haynes, Hitchcock, Mankiewicz, Varda, and Vidor. (Same as: GSWS 2273)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2021.\n\nHollywood has become synonymous with the blockbuster, a category defined by big expectations — big budgets, big special effects, big stars, big marketing campaigns, and big controversies. This course examines this ubiquitous mode of film production by approaching it as a formal style, industrial strategy, mode of production, and cultural phenomenon. The course explores cinema’s history as spectacle and topics including narrative conventions, special effects, franchises, transmedia storytelling, and fandom. Films will be read alongside media paratexts (such as trailers and merchandising) that position these products in the marketplace. The course also addresses how blockbusters have become visible sites for efforts to reform Hollywood culture in response to demands for racial, gender, and pay equity. In this multivalent approach, this course explores the conditions that inform the past, present, and potential futures of American commercial filmmaking on a global scale.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2023.\n\nThis course explores U.S. film history by surveying the contributions of women directors, actresses, and behind-the-scenes workers from the silent era to the 1990s. The course investigates a range of questions: What types of work have women performed? How have political, cultural, and industrial factors shaped opportunities available to women? How have women produced and experienced racial, ethnic, gender, and sexual identities on screen and in the workplace? How has difference affected opportunities available to women and the stories that get to be told? Are there distinctive stylistic or narrative preoccupations that characterize made by women? What does it mean to practice feminist filmmaking, criticism, and history? How might highlighting the experiences of women in the film world empower us to rewrite dominant film histories? To address these questions, the course surveys a range of feature films, documentaries, and experimental works created by both the renowned and the unsung. (Same as: GSWS 2272)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2023.\n\nExamines the genre of the horror film in a range of cultural, theoretical, and literary contexts.

Texts may include works by Craven, Cronenberg, De Palma, Freud, Hitchcock, Kristeva, Kubrick, Poe, Romero, and Shelley. Note: Fulfills the film theory requirement for Cinema Studies minors. (Same as: ENGL 2426, GSWS 2426)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2024, Fall 2021.\n\nThe celebrated German film director Fatih Akin has stated, \"Film is a two dimensional thing—it goes up and down and left to right but if you put music into that two dimensional medium, it acquires a third, fourth, and fifth dimension.\" This course will explore the myriad ways that music creates deeper meaning in film. This will be accomplished through both analysis of preexisting films scores and composing original music for five common filmic categories: establishing sequences, montage sequences, dialogue underscoring, and action and love scenes. Students will need to be able to read music notation. (Same as: MUS 2502)\n\nPrerequisites: MUS 1401 or MUS 2403 or CINE 1000 - 2969 or CINE 3000 or higher.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2022.\n\nAn introduction to Italian cinema with an emphasis on Neorealism and its relationship to other genres, including Comedy Italian Style, the Spaghetti Western, the horror film, the \"mondo\" (shock documentary), and mafia movies, among others. Readings and discussions situate films within their social and historical contexts, and explore contemporary critical debates about the place of radical politics in Italian cinema (a hallmark of Neorealism), the division between art films and popular cinema, and the relevance of the concept of an Italian national cinema in an increasingly globalized world. No prerequisite required. Taught in English (films screened in Italian with English subtitles). Note: Fulfills the non-US cinema requirement for cinema studies minors. (Same as: ITAL 2553)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2023.\n\nExamines the subject of collective memory and reconstructions of the past in post-socialist Eastern European cinema, focusing primarily on Russian-language films. How does this area of the world, with its fraught histories of wars, revolutions and other social upheavals, describe or inscribe the past in recent films, from the historical blockbuster to more intimate contemporary narratives haunted by past events? And how do these films about the darkest episodes of the region’s history shed light on the ways in which we either commemorate or repress historical traumas in our own culture(s) today? Scholarship on nostalgia, cultural taboos, repressed memory, reconciliation, and collective memory will help us to form a complex understanding of how filmmakers not only represent the past in their work, but also recreate it anew on the screen in order to fit the needs of the current moment. (Same as: RUS 2413)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2022.\n\nSurveys Indigenous-produced film from around the globe, with an emphasis on contemporary Native North American and Aboriginal Australian cinema.

While founding myths of Germanic culture (e.g., Nibelungen) are considered, focuses especially on myth in relation to fairy tales, legends (including urban legends of the twentieth century), and borderline genres and motifs (e.g., vampires, witches, automatons), as well as on questions of mythmaking. Examines why modern culture of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, which seemingly neglects or overcomes myths, heavily engages in mythicization of ideas (e.g., gender roles, the unnatural) and popularizes myths through modern media (film, television, the Internet), locations (e.g., cities), and transnational exchange (Disney; the myth of the Orient). Aside from short analytical or interpretive papers aimed at developing critical language skills, students may pursue a creative project (performance of a mythical character, design of a scholarly Web page, writing of a modern fairy tale). Note: Fulfills the film theory and non-US cinema requirements for cinema studies minors. (Same as: GER 3395)\n\nPrerequisites: GER 2204 - 2969 or GER 3000 or higher or Placement in GER 3000 level.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2022.\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall and the concomitant end of the Cold War ushered in what many cultural critics call the era of globalization. An exploration of how contemporary German culture (1990-present) grapples with both the possibilities and uncertainties presented by globalization. Examines a myriad of cultural texts -- films, audio plays, dramas, short fiction, novels, photographs, websites -- as well as mass events (i.e., the Love Parade, the 2006 World Cup) within their political, social, and economic contexts to show how Germany’s troubled past continues to affect the role it plays on the global stage and how its changing demographics -- increased urbanization and ethnic diversity -- have altered its cultural and literary landscape. Critically considers issues such as migration, terrorism and genocide, sex tourism, the formation of the European Union, and the supposed decline of the nation-state. Frequent short writings, participation in debates, and a final research project based upon a relevant topic of individual interest are required. All materials and course work in German. (Same as: GER 3397)\n\nPrerequisites: GER 2204 - 2969 or GER 3000 or higher or Placement in GER 3000 level.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2024, Spring 2021."
