        "text": "Important question: have you ever seen the movie Chef? If not, get ON it! The food in that film is absolutely incredible and the movie itself is hilarious, entertaining, creative, and just so much fun. Today I'm sharing on of the most well known recipes in the movie, pasta aglio e olio (aka pasta with garlic and oil).\n\nI'm also particularly found of the molten chocolate cake scene and based a whole recipe on it 🤣. Oh and I havn't even mentioned the grilled cheese. Just trust me, watch this movie. But maybe not on an empty stomach.\n\nTBH the main reason the recipes in this film are so mouth watering is because they're straight from Roy Choi. He's known for pretty much starting the gourmet food truck movement and is a big proponent of delicious food that isn't too fancy. Pasta aglio e olio is one of his staples. Choi has said makes this dish every Sunday, calling it “transcendence through a handful of humble ingredients”.\n\nSo. On. Point. Pasta aglio e olio is ridiculously simple and yet AMAZINGLY delicious. It's fresh, light, and comforting at the same time. Oh and it takes 20 minutes start to finish 😎.\n\nYour list of ingredients: spaghetti, olive oil, fresh garlic cloves, parsley, red pepper flakes, and some lemon juice. Parmesan cheese optional but I love me some cheese so obviously.\n\nThat's literally it.\n\nWatch Chef, and try this pasta aglio e olio. Trust.\n\nPrint"
