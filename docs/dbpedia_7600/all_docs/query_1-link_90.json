        "text": "At Hood Famous, a Filipino café in Seattle’s burgeoning Chinatown-International District, a slice of buko pie — a coconut-custard confection that hearkens back to the big, fat Pinoy potlucks of my childhood in Hawaii — is not served à la mode but rather à la conundrum.\n\n“Do you like your buko pie hot or cold?” asked owner Chera Amlag, who opened Hood Famous with her rapper husband, Geo Quibuyen, in 2019. Until that moment, I never fathomed applying heat to buko pie beyond its actual bake time because the toothsome coconut and stiff custard of a chilled slice was all I had ever known as a Filipina.\n\nWhile buko pie is traditionally made with slices of tender young coconut suspended in an eggless, condensed-milk custard, the Hood Famous version features shredded coconut for a jammier filling and an apple pie-inspired brown sugar streusel topping.\n\nAgainst my own instincts, Amlag gently warmed my slice in a convection oven. The reheated sample revealed a deeper coconut flavor, amplified sweetness, and gooier texture. Still, these highly palatable attributes failed to sway my lifelong preference for a chilled wedge. Ultimately, Amlag agreed. “I like buko pie both ways,” she revealed. “But if I had to choose, I would eat it cold.”\n\nI tried Hood Famous’ buko pie warm.\n\nA preference for cold dishes over their more digestible and objectively more flavorsome warm counterparts is largely cultural, according to Bay Area culinary scientist Ali Bouzari. Though the exothermic reaction of heat pre-digests food and releases flavor molecules, upgrades in eating that have been enjoyed since early hominids discovered fire, sometimes our modern palates prefer the chewier textures and milder flavors of cooled eats. Anyone who has found comfort and nourishment in cold leftover pizza can attest to this evolutionary backpedal.\n\n“Food is undeniably a choose-your-own-adventure experience, informed by our culture and environment,” says Bouzari, author of Ingredient: Unveiling the Essential Elements of Food and a judge on the Netflix series Snack vs. Chef.\n\nOne of Bouzari’s favorite snacks is cold saffron basmati rice. “Cold rice is pretty hard to defend from a culinary perspective,” he says. “The starches crystallize and get really brittle. It’s almost the exact texture of staleness. But cold saffron rice — Iranian rice — takes me back to summer mornings as a kid, walking barefoot across a hardwood floor to get a spoonful of rice from the refrigerator.”\n\nBecause many cold-food preferences are enmeshed in our memories, the drawbacks of cold food can be easily disregarded. Bouzari hypothesizes that my affinity for cold buko pie may be because I am an undiagnosed coconut purist. Makes sense, given that most people from Hawaii learn to scrape the sweet, slippery, semisoft flesh from young green coconuts at an early age, forever bonding them to the drupe’s unique raw texture.\n\nLike Bouzari, I also have a fondness for cold rice, specifically in the form of ginger chicken congee, another pillar of my food memories. Even though our taste buds are more constricted when we’re eating cold foods, and flavor molecules are also less likely to, as Bouzari says, “swim out,” day-old rice porridge straight from the fridge — filling and economical — still tastes better to me than when it’s fresh off the stove.\n\nHere’s why, according to a Cook’s Illustrated experiment on “better-tasting” leftovers: Soups and stews age particularly well because “many chemical reactions that produce flavor enhancers continue to take place during the cooling process.” Cold leftovers still accrue lip-smacking levels of amino acids like glutamate, one of the “flavor enhancers” that trigger umami.\n\nChe Fico chef David Nayfeld doesn’t prefer his pizza cold.\n\nPizza masterfully develops umami over time, owing to salty pork toppings, ripening tomato sauce, and a liberal flourish of what one can only hope would be authentic Parmigiano Reggiano; as this hard cheese loses moisture during its typical 24 months of aging, its glutamate becomes more concentrated. In spite of this ticking umami bomb, I know of at least one pizza expert, James Beard-nominated chef David Nayfeld of San Francisco’s Cal-Italian restaurant Che Fico, who shuns cold leftover pie.\n\n“I cannot get on board,” says Nayfeld, whose naturally fermented, high-hydration, sourdough crust is a bit of a genre anomaly with its blistered and bubbly perimeter, strewn with Parmigiano Reggiano. Reminiscent of a gougère, the steamy, pillowy splendor of Che Fico pizza is probably best experienced as the chef intended: promptly extracted from an 800-degree wood-fired oven named Loretta.\n\nNayfeld’s heavy opposition to the poster food of cold leftovers belies his true affection for the category. As a young chef in his 20s, his day-off ritual involved takeout dim sum, enough for six people. “I’d camp out on the sofa, pull out one box of dim sum at a time from the refrigerator, and eat like that all day and night,” he says wistfully.\n\nThe simplicity of cold spaghetti pomodoro, with its more al-dente bite and mellower, three-ingredient tomato sauce, is another comforting snack for the chef, whose nightly restaurant menu may include more painstaking pasta dishes like lasagna verde with duck ragù and agnolotti dal plin stuffed with braised short rib.\n\nChe Fico’s bavette steak makes for a delicious sandwich.\n\nThese days, Nayfeld saves a few slices of Che Fico’s binchotan-grilled bavette steak to make himself a sandwich the next day. But this level of forethought — aren’t leftovers really just edible forethought? — has less to do with the flavor imparted by the entrée’s accompanying salsa of maitake mushrooms, hazelnuts, and green garlic, and more to do with the meat’s texture.\n\n“Since bavette is lean, it’s rather tender served cold,” explains Nayfeld of the cut’s flexible, open grain. “Something fattier like ribeye would not be as enjoyable cold because the texture of fat would be undesirable.” To wit, Bouzari likens the icebergs of cooled fat and collagen in cold barbecue brisket to “really tough pâté.” Instead, Bouzari prefers brisket hot off the smoker, juicy and glistening with rendered fat and collagen.\n\n“I know there are people out there who like chewing on cold brisket gristle and who don’t mind the creamy, greasy feeling of congealed fat coating their mouths,” Bouzari says. “So much vibe, so much environmental training goes into these personal preferences.” He’s got a point: If you think of leftovers as the sentimental souvenirs of a well-fed past, then it’s no wonder nostalgia is often a dish that’s best served cold.\n\nLeilani Marie Labong is a San Francisco-based writer who has contributed to Elle Decor, Architectural Digest, Travel + Leisure, San Francisco Chronicle, and Coastal Living.
