        "text": "In 1932 the Italian Futurist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published La cucina futurista, provoking the public with his \"crusade against pasta\" and promise to expand minds and publics with his wildly unusual recipes. Though Marinetti's debt to past cookbooks has been acknowledged, most modern readers have characterized the text as a successful but minor example of a late Futurist avant-garde foray into the sober and codified world of nineteenth century cooking. Yet from its inception, the Italian cookbok has in fact figured itself as a nuanced and potent political tool, used first in the early modern Italian court to instigate movement up the hierarchy, and later as the peninsula tried to become a cohesive whole after the Risorgimento. This article explores Marinetti's cookbook in light of the more complex historical tradition and political valences of the genre, demonstrating the serious intentions of the apparently insubstantial text.\n\nThis study was carried out in order to prove that food whose function has constantly been consump-tion, has added another interesting purpose to itself being art. The waft food is making in our soci-ety today has gotten to a reckoning point and that is the rationale for undertaking this research work. As a result of this rapid movement, the need to discover why food has transformed from normally being eaten to being a work of art should be considered. Applying the qualitative case study research method, which includes a food tasting session at the ‘Signore te ne ringrazi’ restaurant, in-depth and personal interview with the chef and general observations, this study was achievable. After a scrupulous study on the bone of contention ‘How food can be art?’ from many pieces of lit-erature such as books and articles of philosophers, gourmands and personal observation, the out-come of this issue from the researcher’s point of view remains that food should be considered as a work of art even if it has to be Contemporary arts. Nonetheless, Michele Biagiola who is suggested to be an artist from the light of this investigation disagreed with the fact food should be grouped under arts because it is ephemeral. Furthermore, these generalizations according to the researcher will have a more reliable result when a deeper exploration will be done in this field. This will involve spreading the scope to a wider au-dience such as celebrity chefs and gastronauts from diverse parts of the world in order to understand this matter better and achieve a more convincing upshot. Key Words: gastronomy, food, arts, aesthetics, Michele Biagiola, Signore te ne ringrazi.\n\nAbstract: From the late nineteenth century, the changing pace of “modern life”, with faster forms of transport and growing urbanisation, created a particular emphasis on motion, which some avant-garde artists sought to incorporate in painting. This project helped engender novel modes of representation such as Impressionism, Expressionism and Cubism, which became known collectively as “modernist”. This paper examines how modernist pictures of repasts and even “still lifes” were animated by a sense of the movement that was seen to be characteristic of modern life. It examines how a sense of movement in art could be generated by the interactions of figures, through formal means like the strategic use of brushstrokes, or how it might be influenced by perceptual tendencies. According to Gestalt psychology, perception involved a predisposition for orderly, balanced images. Gestalt theory could imply a need for imaginary adjustments to the image in order to regain balance, but this could also create a sense of movement. Food has long been a ubiquitous theme of art. In the modern period, when the experience of movement entered painting, food items previously represented as static became unstable. This paper shows how food demonstrates the innovatory character of modernist art in creating a sense of movement.\n\nIn the years of the Economic Miracle in Italy (1958–63), popular magazines, advertisements, and cookbooks mostly portrayed adult women as housewives and mothers, whose primary responsibility was feeding the family. Images of women in the kitchen were ubiquitous in the visual culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s, which often represented them as caught between tradition and modernity. Trendy magazine columns, images printed on the packages displayed in supermarkets or neighborhood stores, as well as traditional social habits asked women to allow an external model to shape their behavior in the domestic realm. Creativity was hardly presented as a quality of the ideal woman before a seminal marketing campaign promoted by Barilla in 1964. However, female consumers were not always passive followers of the guidelines delineated by others. Looking at the use of the historic cookbooks owned by the Biblioteca Gastronomica Academia Barilla in Parma, Italy, gives us a hint of the independence with which at least some female consumers related to standardized messages, partially resisting them even before gender equality become an open battle in the mid-1960s. This resistance reflects religious, political and social values, which competed with the rise of consumerism.
