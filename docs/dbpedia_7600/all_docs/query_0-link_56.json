        "text": "All I had to do was mention that I was compiling a list of the 100 greatest American foods, and people would start giggling and guffawing.\n\n“It’ll be a real gourmet list, will it?” asked one colleague rhetorically.\n\n“It’s a joke, isn’t it?” a friend said.\n\nAfter all, they insisted, France has a cuisine. So do Italy, China and India. America just has food, most of which was borrowed from someplace else. We suffer from an inbred sense of culinary inferiority to other nations with longer histories … well, except for England.\n\nI was inspired to assemble the list by the incredibly lively debate that ensued after the release of the American Film Institute’s list of Top 100 American films, the Modern Library’s 100 best English language novels of the century, and Entertainment Weekly’s list of all-time greatest lists. I knew that while few of us have seen most of the movies or read the novels, almost all of us have eaten the foods on the list.\n\nCompiling a list of the 100 greatest American foods offered more questions than answers, including the big one: Which foods are truly American, as American as apple pie … a dish imported from England?\n\nI have included USA-defined foods. Some, like pizza, may be direct imports from other countries, but they are American foods now. Whatever pizza was or is now has little to do with Italy and everything to do with what Americans have made of it.\n\nFor better or worse, here are the foods, beverages, ingredients, dishes and meals that Americans have created, influenced and actually eat, ranked by how great – how quintessentially American – they are. These are the foods we have exported with great success to the rest of the world. We sell French fries to the French, tacos to the Mexicans, pizza to the Italians, and fried chicken and ice cream to everybody.\n\nThe rankings could have easily been twice as long. Many foods didn’t make the final cut, including grits, margarine, frozen orange juice, fried green tomatoes, chocolate pudding, cheesecake, Bing cherries, Crisco, succotash, cream-style corn, Parker house rolls, Pop Tarts, deep-fried onion blossoms, scrapple, fish sticks, lox, chicken and dumplings, apple butter, mint julep, red zinfandel wine, salt water taffy, Cheet-os, Egg McMuffins and spaghetti pie.\n\nTop 100 American Foods\n\n(ranked according to importance)\n\n1.
