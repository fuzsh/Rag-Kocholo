        "text": "Our Work\n\nGuyana is comprised of 10 regions. Rainforest Foundation US focuses its work in regions 7, 8 and 9, which comprise much of the country’s mountainous interior. We also work in regions 1 and 2, which are home to a number of coastal Indigenous communities that protect and restore carbon-rich mangrove ecosystems.\n\nOur primary work in Guyana revolves around three strategic priorities: advancing land rights, protecting and monitoring territories, and strengthening regional Indigenous governing bodies, known as District Councils.\n\nOur current initiatives in Guyana include:\n\nRainforests\n\nGuyana is one of the most densely forested countries in South America, with rainforests covering nearly 91% of its landmass—an area larger than Washington state. As part of the unique geological formation known as the Guiana Shield, Guyana’s rainforests are instrumental in regulating rainfall throughout the Amazon basin, significantly impacting global climate regulation. Protecting this vital ecosystem is critical for the health of the region and in mitigating climate change.\n\nGuyana’s rugged interior is a blend of towering mountains, sprawling savannas, and vast rainforests. This biodiverse haven hosts around 4% of all known animal species, including iconic Amazonian species such as jaguars, giant river otters, harpy eagles, tapirs, giant anteaters, and giant armadillos. The distinctive tepui formations and natural savannas in Guyana lead to exceptionally high levels of endemism, meaning many species are unique to this specific geographic location.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nGuyana is home to nine distinct Indigenous peoples, comprising nearly 80,000 individuals or about 11% of the country’s population; the majority reside in the country’s interior, across 250 communities. These communities hold titles to some 18% of the forested territories, although their traditional lands extend even further.\n\nThe Amerindian Act—established in 2006—serves as the country’s legal framework for Indigenous people’s governance and land management. Unfortunately, it contains many outdated and misguided clauses that severely undermine territorial security for Indigenous peoples. Passing comprehensive reforms to the Act is one of the highest priorities for the Indigenous movement in Guyana.\n\nAlthough 96 Indigenous territories are officially recognized, they encompass only a fraction of the actual Indigenous customary lands; and even titled territories remain vulnerable to threats from extractive industries. Dozens of communities are currently seeking collective titles to protect their forests and the surrounding savannahs that are essential for hunting, fishing, and other traditional practices.\n\nThreats\n\nMining for gold, diamonds, and bauxite is a major driver of forest degradation and deforestation in Guyana. Illegal mining not only devastates Guyana’s forests but also pollutes vital water sources that communities depend on for fisheries, drinking, bathing, and cooking.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2022, Guyana lost nearly 600,000 acres of tree cover, a concerning trend exacerbated by illicit logging. While many logging activities are legal on paper, rampant corruption combined with weak law enforcement often results in over-harvesting and logging outside approved areas, leading to conflicts with Indigenous communities.\n\nGuyana is currently a net carbon sink, maintaining relatively low deforestation rates compared to other countries in the region. However, the discovery of some of the world’s largest offshore oil reserves has the potential to change this status dramatically. While oil drilling means increased financial resources for Guyana, it also poses new potential risks for previously isolated Indigenous communities in the interior of the country, following an increase in large-scale development projects, including roads, agribusiness, and energy infrastructure.\n\nIn 2020, the Guyanese government placed all of the country’s forests on the carbon market, pledging to protect them in exchange for investments. While this may sound like a positive step to halt deforestation, the move drew criticism from regional and national Indigenous organizations, which cited an inadequate consultation process around a deal that involves their lands. The first deal, worth $750 million, was tendered by oil company Hess Corporation, further highlighting the controversial role of fossil fuel companies in the carbon offset market and other schemes aimed at combating climate change."
