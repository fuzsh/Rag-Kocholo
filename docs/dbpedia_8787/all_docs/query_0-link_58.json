        "text": "In his address at the opening of the April 16 Local Content Summit in Georgetown, President of Guyana, Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali, said the “Guyana Brand” has reached unprecedented levels of global recognition and influence, signaling a new era for the nation’s development and potential.\n\nAli argued that the country’s brand has a role to play in redefining Guyana’s position globally. He declared, “Guyana’s giving all of you a new brand position. Erase all the noise that we have here locally. This country this brand ‘Guyana’ is helping to position all of you differently. All of us differently even as leaders.”\n\nIn support of this point, Ali condemned negative attitudes towards the national brand and asked listeners to shift their perspective.\n\nHe also lamented the underutilization of the Guyana brand, stating that citizens also have to build the brand to make it stronger.\n\nHe called for a collective effort to bolster the national image, emphasizing, “You want to create world-class health care? Start selling the brand that’s world-class health care. Start celebrating all the accomplishments we are having at Georgetown Hospital, second to none in a rapid pace. Some of the finest surgeries finest doctors we have. Start celebrating each other. Celebrate the brand!”\n\nConcluding his address, Ali urged the audience, especially youth and local businesses, to embrace available opportunities and contribute actively to the nation’s growth trajectory. “The future is ours. You decide how you shape it,” he said.\n\nThe Local Content Summit was a collaboration between MBW Energy Support Services, Prestige Management Consultations, and the Ministry of Natural Resources’ Local Content Secretariat."
