        "text": "Geography\n\nGuyana is the size of Idaho and is situated on the northern coast of South America, east of Venezuela, west of Suriname, and north of Brazil. A tropical forest covers more than 80% of the country. The Amazon rainforest is to the south of Guyana with Guyana’s rainforest region known as Iwokrama.\n\nIn 2011, the Kanuki Mountains in the Upper Takut-Upper Essequibo area were designated as a National Protected Area and is home to around 20 different indigenous communities made from the Macushi and Wapishana people who retain a subsistence way of life.\n\nThe country has three main geographical zones: the coastal plain, white sand belt, and interior highlands.\n\nCoastal plain: This represents only around 5% of the county’s territory but contains 90% of the population. The coastal plain follows along the east coast of the Correntyne River and consists of rich and fertile clay.\n\nWhite sand belt: An area to the south of the coastal zone which consists mainly of low sandy hills and outcrops of rock. Hardwood forests can be found in this area as well as many of Guyana’s reserves such as gold, bauxite, and diamonds.\n\nInterior highlands: The interior region that’s dominated by grassland and flat-topped mountains with the Pacaraima Mountains along the western part of the interior. Other prominent features include Mount Roraima on the border with Venezuela and the Acarai Mountains along the southern border.\n\nGeorgetown is the capital city of Guyana and is by far the largest city in the country with a population of around 235,00 (2021). The next largest city is New Amsterdam with a population of 44,690 (2021). Georgetown is home to the National Assembly of Guyana and all of the main gov and court buildings.\n\nThe city also features the National Cultural Centre, the University of Guyana, and Guyana National Park which includes the Guyana Zoo.\n\nNew Amsterdam has developed as a prominent port with its name and architecture deriving from the time of Dutch colonization. The other main Guyanese towns are Linden, Anna Regina, Princetown, Bartica, and Rose Hall.\n\nHighest Single-Drop Waterfall\n\n‘Guyana’ is an indigenous word that translates as ‘Land of Many Waters’ with waterfalls being a particular feature of Guyana’s landscape. This includes the world’s longest single-drop waterfall which is found on the Potaro River in the Kaieteur National Park. At a height of 251 meters (822 feet), Kaieteur Falls is four times the height of Niagara Falls.\n\nClimate\n\nGuyana has a tropical climate with two wet seasons that take place from December to February and April to August. Temperatures are warm and remain fairly consistent throughout the year, ranging between 60°F and 93°F. The northwest of the country experiences the highest rainfall with the lowest levels in the southeast.\n\nGovernment\n\nGuyana is a republic with the official title of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana. The country operates a parliamentary democracy with the President of Guyana fulfilling the dual role of head of state and head of government. Executive power is held by the president and government with legislative power shared with the National Assembly of Guyana.\n\nThe National Assembly has 65 members who are elected using proportional representation. Twenty-five members are elected to serve the ten geographic constituencies with 40 selected from a national block vote. The National Assembly meets at the Parliament Chambers within the Parliament Building in Georgetown.\n\nPolitics\n\nPolitical support in Guyana tends to follow ethnic lines. The two main parties are the People’s Progressive Party/Civic (PPP/C) and the People’s National Congress Reform (PNCR). Generally, support for the PPP/C is strongest among the Indo-Guyanese population while the PNCR is backed mainly by Afro-Guyanese.\n\nThe third largest group is the Alliance for Change (AFC) which was created by politicians disaffected with the two main parties and is regarded as a multiracial party.\n\nGuyanese elections have often triggered disputes over alleged fraud and rigging. The 2020 election of President Ali only took place after multiple legal challenges had been resolved.\n\nInternational Affairs\n\nGuyana has been involved with several international situations that have drawn eyes from around the globe, including the following.\n\nInternational Disputes\n\nGuyana has adopted a general foreign affairs policy of remaining politically non-aligned but one area where they come into conflict with adjacent states is territorial integrity. The nation has had border disputes with both Suriname and Venezuela.\n\nThe Suriname claim was for rights to a sparsely populated territory to the east of the Correntyne River. A provisional border was created by British and Dutch colonial powers but no formal agreement had been made. The dispute was settled by a 2007 maritime arbitration which determined that the border follows the western coast of the Correntyne River.\n\nThe border dispute with Venezuela concerns the Guayana Esequiba region which covers around 158,500 km (61,600 sq mi) of land to the west of Guyana. This area often appears on maps with a dashed line border to denote the disputed nature of the territory.\n\nThe dispute has its roots in the 19th-century actions of colonial powers operating in the region with the influence of Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. In 1966, the area was made subject to the Geneva Agreement and a commitment to finding a peaceful resolution.\n\nIn December 2020, the International Court of Justice accepted a case submitted by Guyana to settle the dispute. Venezuela has opposed the legal case which aims to ratify the 1899 Arbitral Award which Guyana argue gives them rights to the land.\n\nCulture\n\nThe culture of Guyana reflects the history of the land with a diverse mix of influences that include African, Amerindian, British, Portuguese, and Dutch cultures. It is the only South American country to have English as its official language but most people speak Guyanese Creole.\n\nThe varied mix that makes up Guyana culture is seen in the range of popular music with calypso, reggae, chutney, and Soca. Notable Guyanese performers include Eddy Grant, Aubrey Cummings, and Terry Gajraj.\n\nAmong the notable Guyanese painters are Aubrey Williams, Donald Locke, and Emerson Samuels. The literature of Guyana is heavily influenced by its colonial history and figured heavily in the work of novelist and essayist Wilson Harris who died in 2018. Other notable writers include Sharon Maas, Beryl Gilroy, and Wordsworth McAndrew.\n\nSports\n\nThe most popular sports for Guyanese people are cricket, football, and basketball. Cricket was brought to the country during the colonial era with Guyana regularly providing players for the West Indies international side. Notable players have included Clive Lloyd, Carl Hooper, and Ramnaresh Sarwan.\n\nThe Guyana national football team is nicknamed the Golden Jaguars and the Guyana Football Federation (GFF) National Super League is the top division in the nation’s domestic competition.\n\nThe Guyana national basketball team has a FIFA ranking of 111 (2022) with their greatest success being a silver medal at the 1994 Caribbean Basketball Championship.\n\nGuyana has a particular track record of producing elite-level boxers such as the 2001 WBA welterweight champion Andrew Lewis and Wayne ‘Big Truck’ Braithwaite, winner of the WBC cruiserweight title in 2002.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe discovery of oil reserves in off-shore territories has given Guyana a fast-growing economy. It has changed the financial landscape for a country that has traditionally experienced high rates of debt and a nationalized industry sector.\n\nThe economy has become increasingly open to the markets in recent times as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have contributed to a recovery plan.\n\nMany government-owned businesses have been privatized, including operations within the cellphone, timber, rice, and fishing-related industries.\n\nMining and agriculture remain Guyana’s most valuable source of export earnings with bauxite, rice, sugar, and gold making up around 75% of exports.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first known inhabitants of Guyana were groups of distinct settlers known as the Warao (Warrau), Carib, and Arawak. These are believed to have migrated from Eurasia around 40,000 years ago.\n\nThe first documented contacts take place as Dutch, English, and French forces established colonies in what is now known as Guyana. During the early 17th century the majority of these settlements were Dutch.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic wars, Britain took over the Dutch colonies of Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo, which became British Guiana in 1831. Slavery was outlawed in 1834, and the great need for plantation workers led to a large wave of immigration, primarily of East Indians.\n\nToday, about half of the population is of East Indian descent and about 36% are of African descent.\n\nPopulation growth in Guyana was accelerated by the discovery of gold in the 1890s. The timber-rich Essequibo territory to the west of Guyana also attracts increasing interest and triggers a territorial dispute with Venezuela.\n\nIn 1889, Venezuela voiced its claim to the territory but ten years later an international tribunal ruled the land belonged to British Guiana. The 1899 award is still being contested in the international law courts by the two nations.\n\nGuyana Gains Independence\n\nBritish Guiana became a Crown colony in 1928, and in 1953 it was granted home rule. In 1950, Cheddi Jagan, who was Indian-Guyanese, and Forbes Burnham, who was Afro-Guyanese, created the colony's first political party, the Progressive People's Party (PPP), which was dedicated to gaining the colony's independence.\n\nIn the 1953 elections, Cheddi Jagan was elected chief minister. The British, however, alarmed by Jagan's Marxist views, suspended the constitution and government within months and installed an interim government. In 1955, the PPP split, with Burnham breaking off to create the People's National Congress (PNC).\n\nThe leftist Jagan of the PPP and the more moderate Burnham of the PNC were to dominate Guyanan politics for decades to come. In 1961, Britain granted the colony autonomy, and Jagan became prime minister (1961–1964). Strikes and rioting weakened Jagan's rule, much of it believed to be the result of covert CIA operations. In 1964, Burnham succeeded Jagan as prime minister, a position he retained after the country gained full independence on May 26, 1966. With independence, the country returned to its traditional name, Guyana.\n\nJonestown Mass Suicide\n\nIn 1978, the country gained worldwide attention when American religious cult leader Jim Jones and 900 of his followers committed mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana. The cult relocated to Guyana in 1974 after having attracted support in the U.S. cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nFirst Constitution\n\nThe establishment of a constitution in 1980 identifies the President as the Head of State and the Supreme Executive Authority. It replaced the British Monarchy with a ceremonial president.\n\nForbes Burnham became the first Executive President when he was elected as a representative of the People's National Congress Reform party. He rules Guyana until his death in 1985. Guyana's first independent decades were marked by continued racial unrest between Indian-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese as well as economic malaise.\n\nDesmond Hoyte of the PNC became president in 1985, but in 1992 the PPP reemerged, winning a majority in the general election. Jagan became president, and the former Marxist succeeded in reviving the economy. After his death in 1997, his wife, Janet Jagan, was elected president. Former finance minister Bharrat Jagdeo assumed the presidency in 1999."
