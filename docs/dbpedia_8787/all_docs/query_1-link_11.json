        "text": "LOCAL manufacturers and producers could now apply to the Guyana National Bureau of Standards (GNBS) to use the Made in Guyana certification mark.\n\nThe coveted mark, which was unveiled by First Lady Mrs. Arya Ali at the National Quality Awards Ceremony in October 2021, is a signature of quality for authentic Guyanese products, and is now available for use by local businesses.\n\nFor years, businesses have been calling for the establishment of a local programme which provides a mark that differentiates their products based on key quality and other requirements.\n\nSupported by its legislation, the GNBS has heeded the call at a time in the economy when businesses are working to demonstrate quality, and remain competitive.\n\nThe Standards Act No. 11 of 1984 authorises the GNBS to use its Made in Guyana mark on products with set criteria, once they comply with the terms and conditions of the programme.\n\nThe Made in Guyana mark is a registered mark that aims to provide recognition to locally manufactured products on the local and international markets.\n\nThrough its use, the GNBS is looking to enhance national competitiveness for authentic Guyanese products certified under the programme, while also creating and promoting brand recognition and market advantage for participating businesses.\n\nThe certification programme also provides a framework for the development of quality systems to enhance Guyana’s local content, pushing Guyanese businesses to the forefront of quality on a national, regional, and international level, at an affordable cost.\n\nThe Made in Guyana programme, which is voluntary, is open to applications from all manufacturers and producers of local products, regardless of size or product type.\n\nUnder the programme, only products meeting the established criteria, as outlined by the national standards body, would be certified to use the Made in Guyana mark.\n\nIn terms of criteria, products will be certified based on the quantity of local raw materials used in their production, and the number of Guyanese staff employed by establishments (at least 70 per cent). It must be noted that while companies are allowed to import 80 per cent of their raw materials, the products must be assembled or processed in Guyana.\n\nTo ensure that the requirements of the Made in Guyana mark programme are favourable to local businesses, the draft requirements were exposed to a period of public consultations to allow for stakeholders’ input and consensus. Those inputs were then considered, and requirements were finalised.\n\nThe new certification programme became active at the beginning of January 2022, and local companies could now apply to the GNBS to use the Made in Guyana mark.\n\nThe period of certification is one year, and surveillances and a renewal of assessment will be conducted during the certification period to ensure continued conformance to the established criteria.\n\nThe Certification Services Department of the GNBS stands ready to offer the requisite guidance to all sizes of businesses that are considering to apply for this mark of quality.\n\nThe application form, along with the detailed requirements of the programme and the process of acquiring the Made in Guyana Certification mark, can be found on the GNBS website https: https://gnbsgy.org/certification/made-in-guyana-certification/\n\nFor further information, please contact the GNBS on telephone numbers: 219-0064-66 or WhatsApp: 692-4627."
