        "text": "Hot on the heels of our inaugural Tokong Rum bottling (a splendid 16yo Long Pond), we are thrilled to present a 1997 Port Mourant rum from Guyana, distilled in a one-of-a kind double wooden pot still, then aged over 24 years on the Continent. Another great bottling selected for us by @valinchandmallet with Singapore-based Arcaydia Studios providing label art expressing the sharply defined flavor profile we love so much. As always, we only bottle at cask-strength without added colouring. This is a tiny allocation of only 60 bottles. Get it before it's gone!\n\nNose: Intoxicating bouquet of honeyed apricots, haw flakes, preserved nutmegs, vanilla and clove, with undertones of paint, plant oil and dried shitake.\n\nPalate: The characteristic paint and mushroom of Port Mourant is still evident, but we are also getting well-integrated oak and spiced fruit.\n\nFinish: Sweet, medium-length.\n\nABV: 50.3%\n\nWith box?: No"
