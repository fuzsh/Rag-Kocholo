Our experienced immigration professionals partner with businesses of all sizes to develop immigration strategies that can help you achieve your goals.\n\nGuyana's immigration laws provide several options for employers of foreign nationals. While not published, business activities in Guyana are typically limited to attending meetings and exploring business opportunities. Some technical activities such as training and inspections conducted during short and infrequent trips may be permissible but should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. However, any foreign national entering Guyana to conduct business activities – even if permissible under business visitor status – for a period exceeding one month must obtain a Work Permit.\n\nForeign nationals who require a visa to enter Guyana for business must secure a single-entry Visitor Visa on Arrival (VVOA). Applicants should be prepared to show the original visa pre-approval notice, the original visa application form, and a passport-size photograph. They may also need to show an invitation letter from the inviter/sponsor, a return or onward ticket, and evidence of financial means to cover expenses for 30 days.\n\nForeign nationals seeking to conduct work activities in Guyana must secure a Work Permit through the sponsorship of a Guyanese company or a foreign company registered in Guyana. Work permits are usually granted for two years and extensions are available. To obtain a Work Permit, visa nationals must first enter Guyana with an Employment Visa On Arrival (EVOA), and visa-exempt nationals must first enter Guyana with an approved Permit to Land (PTL). An EVOA is usually valid for three years; a PTL is usually valid for a single entry within six months of issuance and allows a stay for up to three months. These permits allow foreign nationals to work during the processing of their Work Permit application.​​\n\nFragomen can also consult on citizenship matters and, as permitted within the confines of local law, may be able to offer citizenship assistance."
