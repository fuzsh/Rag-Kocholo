        "text": "The president, who serves as both chief of state and head of government, appoints the cabinet, though ministers are collectively responsible to the National Assembly. Parties designate a presidential candidate ahead of National Assembly elections, with the winning party’s candidate assuming the presidency for a maximum of two five-year terms.\n\nIrfaan Ali of the opposition PPP/C became president in August 2020 following a hotly contested recount of the March election and multiple rounds of litigation. Balloting had been due since March 2019, after Granger and the APNU-AFC coalition lost a vote of confidence in December 2018. However, government stalling and a series of procedural disputes followed, and elections were not called until October 2019. Results announced by the government following the March 2020 election were based on a tally that included alterations to the count from the country’s largest voting district, leading to accusations of government fraud. Following protests and lawsuits, Guyana’s High Court ordered a recount, but political maneuvering and courtroom battles continued for months until the government finally accepted the recount results establishing Ali’s narrow victory.\n\nMembers of the unicameral, 65-seat National Assembly are elected to five-year terms; 25 representatives are elected in 10 geographical constituencies, while 40 are elected by proportional representation in one nationwide constituency. Up to seven unelected cabinet ministers and parliamentary officials may also hold ex-officio seats.\n\nIn the 2020 elections, the PPP/C won 33 seats and the APNU-AFC coalition secured 31 seats, while the union of A New United Guyana (ANUG), the Liberty and Justice Party (LJP) and The New Movement (TNM) was allocated 1 seat. European Union (EU) observers reported that the March election was competitive and vote casting was generally free, although polarization, unregulated party and campaign finance, and a lack of transparency characterized the preelectoral period. Moreover, according to the EU observation mission, the integrity of the entire vote was “seriously compromised” by the manipulation of results in the largest electoral district, Region 4, by senior officials from the Guyana Elections Commission (GECOM). The electoral crisis stretched for months and included a disputed, month-long recount, the attempted invalidation of tens of thousands of votes by GECOM’s chief elections officer, significant international pressure, and sometimes contradictory interventions from both Guyanese courts and the Caribbean Court of Justice. The eventual allocation of seats was based on the recount, completed in June and judged to be accurate by Caribbean Community (CARICOM) observers.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 4 to 3 due to irregularities that marred the preelectoral period and vote-tallying process, and amounted to an unsuccessful attempt by the former government to change the election’s outcome.\n\nAlthough observers characterized the balloting as generally free, both Guyana’s election laws and GECOM’s management received harsh criticism. In its final report, the EU observation mission described GECOM as dysfunctional, riven by polarization, opaque in its decision making, and derelict in its duty to control its officials from interfering with the election results. The mission recommended an overhaul of GECOM’s composition and practices. Following the change of government, multiple GECOM members faced criminal charges for abetting the fraudulent vote tabulation, including Chief Elections Officer Keith Lowenfield, who was arrested in September.\n\nPolitical parties may form freely, and they generally operate without interference. A long-standing deadlock between two major parties with different ethnic bases had softened somewhat in recent years, with the multiethnic AFC emerging alongside the predominantly Afro-Guyanese APNU and the mainly Indo-Guyanese PPP/C. However, ethnopolitical divisions have sharpened as an anticipated influx of oil and gas revenues raises the stakes of controlling the distribution of state resources.\n\nNew parties emerged to contest the 2020 elections, with ANUG, LJP and TNM joining forces to gain one shared seat. There are no legal provisions allowing independent candidates to stand for the presidency.\n\nWomen and ethnic minorities have equal political rights, though ethnic divisions have long played a powerful role in politics. Indigenous people, who make up about 10 percent of the population, remain politically marginalized. At least one third of each party’s candidate list must consist of women, and 25 out of 70 seats in the National Assembly were won by women in 2020.\n\nA consultation process on constitutional reform with Indigenous groups promised in late 2019 has largely failed to materialize. The small LJP party nominated Indigenous rights activist Lenox Shuman for president in 2020; although he was disqualified by GECOM for holding dual Canadian citizenship, Shuman became the deputy speaker of the National Assembly in September.\n\nLaws designed to ensure government transparency are inconsistently upheld. A 2013 Access to Information Act allows the government to refuse requests with little or no justification.\n\nA government integrity commission tasked with reviewing officials’ asset disclosures was reestablished in 2018 after a long dormancy.\n\nIn 2017, Guyana joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which requires countries to submit reports detailing the use of revenue obtained from the extraction of their natural resources, though as of the end of 2020 the government had published an EITI report for only the 2017 fiscal year. Critics have suggested that Guyana’s negotiation of its initial set of oil contracts, conducted in private negotiations with individual companies rather than through open auctions, resulted in unfavorable terms for the government.\n\nAlthough freedom of the press is generally respected, government officials have filed defamation cases and occasionally threatened journalists. Criminal defamation charges can draw up to two years in prison.\n\nThe Guyana National Broadcasting Authority, whose board is appointed by the president, has been accused of partisan bias in its regulatory and licensing decisions. According to EU observers, state-run print and television outlets displayed “overt bias” in favor of the ruling APNU-AFC during the 2020 election campaign, while several private outlets provided highly favorable coverage to the PPP/C.\n\nThe courts are impaired by political disputes, staff shortages, and lack of resources. The president must obtain the agreement of the leader of the opposition to appoint the chancellor of the judiciary and the chief justice; both positions remained in the hands of acting placeholders as of 2020 due to the ongoing failure to agree on appointments. Other judges are appointed by the president on the advice of a Judicial Service Commission, which is also selected with input from the opposition. Guyana’s courts played a mixed role during the 2020 election crisis. A June decision by the Court of Appeal bolstered the Granger government’s position that large numbers of votes should be invalidated. However, when the Caribbean Court of Justice—which serves as Guyana’s apex judicial body—overruled this decision, the Court of Appeal confirmed that GECOM must declare a winner based on the recount-based vote tally, which favored the PPP/C.\n\nObservance of due process safeguards is uneven. Defendants are often held in pretrial detention for periods longer than their maximum possible sentence. As of November 2020, the prison population stood at over 140 percent of capacity, with 40 percent of inmates in pretrial detention. A new attorney general and legal affairs minister, Anil Nandlall, took office in August 2020 promising to reduce the use of custodial sentences in favor of community service. Police officers do not always operate with professionalism; some have reportedly accepted bribes and committed a variety of other crimes.\n\nIndo-Guyanese people, who make up 40 percent of the total population, predominate within the business sector, while Afro-Guyanese hold most public sector positions. A history of interethnic violence and the organization of politics along ethnic lines makes communal violence a perennial concern. In September 2020, two Afro-Guyanese teenagers were murdered in a largely Indo-Guyanese region, leading to protests and the killings of two Indo-Guyanese people.\n\nLaws barring discrimination based on race, gender, and other categories are not effectively enforced. Women continue to suffer from workplace bias and significantly lower pay. Guyana’s nine principal Indigenous groups still face disparities in the provision of health care, education, and justice. Same-sex sexual activity is punishable with harsh jail terms, and the LGBT+ community is subject to police harassment and discrimination."
