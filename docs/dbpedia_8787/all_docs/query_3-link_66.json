        "text": "Brief History\n\nGuyana was originally inhabited by Arawak and Carib tribes. They named this area “Guiana,” meaning “land of many waters.” In 1448, Christopher Columbus sighted Guyana’s coast and claimed the region for Spain. However, the first European settlers were the Dutch who came in the late 1500s. The Dutch set up sugarcane plantations in the 1600s and imported slaves from Africa to do the work. Guyana was taken over by the British in 1776, and the colony of British Guiana was formed in 1831. Guyana was granted independence from Britain in 1966 and became a republic in 1970. Since then, Guyana has had border disputes with Venezuela and Suriname––and has dealt with political turbulence.\n\nNational Flag\n\nThe national flag of Guyana was adopted on May 26, 1966, when the country was granted independence from Britain. It was designed by Whitney Smith who was from the United States. It consists of a green background, a golden triangle, and a red triangle.\n\nGeography\n\nGuyana is located on the northern coast of the South American continent. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Brazil to the southwest, Suriname to the east, and Venezuela to the northwest. The main geographic regions of Guyana are a swampy coastal plain, a hilly sandy area, tropical rainforests, and interior highlands.\n\nWorld Land Mass Ranking: 85th\n\nHighest Mountain: Mount Roraima 2,910 m (9,220 ft)\n\nLongest River: Essequibo River 1,014 km (630 mi)\n\nMain Languages\n\nEnglish\n\nCuisine\n\nThe cuisine of Guyana has been influenced by its ethnic populations and colonial history. As a result of this melting pot of cultures, Guyanese cuisine is very diverse. Root vegetables, such as cassava and sweet potato, are common in Guyanese dishes. Seafood is also a staple of Guyanese cuisine. Often, dishes will be seasoned with a green seasoning made of herbs, hot peppers, onions, and garlic. The national dish of Guyana is pepperpot, which is a meat stew flavored with cinnamon, clove, thyme, and wiri wiri peppers.\n\nSports\n\nSports and activities are an important part of Guyanese culture. The most popular sport in Guyana is cricket, which was first introduced to the area by British soldiers. Cricket is the national sport of Guyana, and is played by both men and women at all levels. The second-most popular sport in Guyana is football. Other common sports in Guyana include field hockey, basketball, squash, boxing, horse racing, and rugby.\n\nCulture\n\nGuyana has a rich and diverse culture that reflects the influence of African, Indian, Amerindian, Dutch, British, and Creole cultures. Guyanese culture, especially in the coastal areas, is quite similar to that of the West Indies. As a result, Guyana is considered a Caribbean nation despite being located in South America. Arawak and Carib crafts, including textiles, baskets, and paintings, are sold in markets throughout the country. Other Important aspects of Guyanese culture include music, dance, film, and religion."
