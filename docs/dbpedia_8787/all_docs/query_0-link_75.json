        "text": "We are a Society reaching genealogical researchers throughout the world who are researching their colonial British Guiana or post-independence Guyana ancestors. For the many Guyanese diaspora and descendants whose searches have met with disappointment, we hope to provide some alternative resources as they as discovered and whenever possible, transcriptions. Please note that we have no more information than is posted on this website and we do not do individual research. Therefore, inquiries regarding your personal research to the webmaster cannot be answered. Help on personal research should be posted on the Forum.\n\nWhen the British left the then Colony named British Guiana, vital records (births, marriages, and deaths) were left in-country. Since independence, Guyana has experienced severe economic depression and civil strife, excluding any interest or ability to preserve or make available the historical and vital records.\n\nPlease read through the pages under the label heading \"Research\" on the above menu, as there are many suggestions of places to search. . Recent transcriptions have been added of colonial materials which may assist in the pursuit of colonial ancestors. New content is added as obtained. Keep checking for our new additions! Any newly discovered alternative secondary data sources will be posted here. And remember - we always welcome your contributions and suggestions."
