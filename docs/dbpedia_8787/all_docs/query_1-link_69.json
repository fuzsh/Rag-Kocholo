        "text": "One advantage of rum from independent bottlers is that the label usually says which distillery made it. Many Caribbean distilleries have distinct flavor profiles, so this information can provide a strong clue regarding how the rum in a bottle tastes. When a bottle says “Made at Worthy Park,” you generally know what to expect, assuming you’ve had prior experience with other Worthy Park rums.\n\nHowever, the usefulness of the distillery name in isolation breaks down when the distillery makes many different marks and/or uses widely different stills. One example is Hampden Estate, which makes eight distinct marks in its pot stills, ranging from the relatively light OWH to the extreme DOK. Fortunately, independent bottlers often specify which mark is in the bottle, e.g., LROK, HLCF, or DOK.\n\nAnother example is St. Lucia Distillers. Its Vendome pot still creates a heavier, more phenolic rum than the adjacent John Dore pot stills or Coffey still. While the distillery’s marks aren’t well known, rum geeks know the flavor profile of each still. If you’re paying a premium price for a limited edition rum, you want to know which stills (or stills) contributed to the liquid in the bottle. Fortunately, many limited edition St. Lucia Distillers bottlings indicate this information on the label.\n\nSo far, so good. But when it comes to vintage rum from Guyana’s Demerara Distillers Ltd, decoding a label can be anything but straightforward due to a unique confluence of events. When it comes to Demerara rum, which still made the rum is more important than which distillery it resides at.\n\nIf we go back in time to 1993, Demerara Distillers was operating three distilleries – Uitvlugt, Enmore, and Diamond. Four historically important stills operated at either Uitvlugt or Enmore that year:\n\nPort Mourant wooden vat\n\nVersailles wooden vat\n\nEnmore wooden Coffey column\n\nSavalle column\n\nWhen Enmore closed in 1994, the Enmore Coffey and Versailles joined the Port Mourant and Savalle stills at the Uitvlugt distillery. Six years later, all four stills moved across the Demerara River to Diamond, where they still operate today.\n\nQuite a few independent bottlers sell rums distilled before 2000 and labeled as simply “Uitvlugt” or “Uitvlugt distillery.” What are we to make of this? The rum might be a heavy beast from the Port Mourant still or something entirely different from the Savalle column. Even if a label states pot distillation, the rum could be either Port Mourant or Versailles distillate. Likewise, if we’re told the rum is column distilled, it could be from either the Enmore or Savalle still.\n\nThe potential for confusion isn’t limited to Uitvlugt. An Enmore label presents similar challenges. If it says “Enmore” does it mean Enmore Estate or the Enmore wooden Coffey still? Even if it says Enmore Estate, we don’t know whether it’s from the Enmore Coffey or the Versailles wooden vat still.\n\nAll of the above might be of minor significance if there wasn’t so much rum distilled at Enmore and Uitvlugt available today. Some independent bottlers helpfully convey the still or rum mark. But when this information isn’t available, it becomes a puzzle to determine what’s in the bottle.\n\nIf you find yourself in such a situation, refer to the information below regarding where each of the four historic Demerara Distillers stills has resided in recent decades.\n\nUitvlugt Estate (Closed in 1999-2000)\n\nEnmore wooden column: 1994-2000\n\nPort Mourant wooden vat: 1968-2000\n\nSavalle column: 1921-2000\n\nVersailles wooden vat: 1994-2000\n\nEnmore Estate (Closed in 1994)\n\nEnmore wooden column: 1880-1994\n\nVersailles wooden vat: 1978-1994\n\nDiamond Estate (Still in Operation)"
