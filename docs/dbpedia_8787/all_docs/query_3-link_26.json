        "text": "Geography\n\nGuyana is a country in the northeast of South America. The land has a total area of 214,970 km² (83,000 mi²) and a total coastline of 459 km (285.2 mi). This land area is approximately 104% of the area of Minnesota. Guyana is thus one of the largest countries in the Americas and the 85th biggest in the world. With 3.8 inhabitants per km² it is one of the most sparsely populated countries on earth. Most of the population (73%) resides within rural regions.\n\nGuyana is comparatively low at an average elevation of 207 meters above sea level. The highest mountain peak (Sub-peak of the Roraima-Tepui) is at 2,718 meters. The country has about 20 islands. There are direct national borders with the three neighboring countries Brazil, Suriname and Venezuela. The distance between New York City and the Capital Georgetown is about 4,090 km (2,541 mi)."
