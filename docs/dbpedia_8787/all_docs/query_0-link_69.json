We firmly believe that our activities should contribute to the community’s socio-economic development, through transparent communication and by using local resources and supporting actions that improve the quality of the local community.\n\nRepsol has been a sponsor of the Mining Week organized by the Guyana’s Geology and Mining Commission for years, and we have also supported the GIPEX Conference as Gold Sponsors. In addition, we sponsored the ICT Project developed by the Ministry of Telecommunications, and we continue to lend support to other valuable local initiatives."
