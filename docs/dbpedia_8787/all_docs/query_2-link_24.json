        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nOriginally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to settlement of urban areas by former slaves and the importation of indentured servants from India to work the sugar plantations. The resulting ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to turbulent politics. Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is considered the country's first free and fair election since independence. After his death five years later, his wife, Janet JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was elected in 2001 and again in 2006. Early elections held in May 2015 resulted in the first change in governing party and the replacement of President Donald RAMOTAR by current President David GRANGER. After a December 2018 no-confidence vote against the GRANGER government, national elections will be held before the scheduled spring 2020 date.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nNorthern South America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Suriname and Venezuela\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n5 00 N, 59 00 W\n\nMap references\n\nSouth America\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 214,969 sq km\n\nland: 196,849 sq km\n\nwater: 18,120 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 86\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than Idaho; almost twice the size of Tennessee\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 2,933 km\n\nborder countries (3): Brazil 1308 km, Suriname 836 km, Venezuela 789 km\n\nCoastline\n\n459 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200nm or to the outer edge of the continental margin\n\nClimate\n\ntropical; hot, humid, moderated by northeast trade winds; two rainy seasons (May to August, November to January)\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly rolling highlands; low coastal plain; savanna in south\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 207 m\n\nlowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m\n\nhighest point: Laberintos del Norte on Mount Roraima 2,775 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nbauxite, gold, diamonds, hardwood timber, shrimp, fish\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 8.4% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 2.1% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 0.1% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 6.2% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 77.4% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 14.2% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n1,430 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation is heavily concentrated in the northeast in and around Georgetown, with noteable concentrations along the Berbice River to the east; the remainder of the country is sparsely populated\n\nNatural hazards\n\nflash flood threat during rainy seasons\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nwater pollution from sewage and agricultural and industrial chemicals; deforestation\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\nthe third-smallest country in South America after Suriname and Uruguay; substantial portions of its western and eastern territories are claimed by Venezuela and Suriname respectively; contains some of the largest unspoiled rainforests on the continent\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n740,685 (July 2018 est.)\n\nnote: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 166\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Guyanese (singular and plural)\n\nadjective: Guyanese\n\nEthnic groups\n\nEast Indian 39.8%, African descent 29.3%, mixed 19.9%, Amerindian 10.5%, other 0.5% (includes Portuguese, Chinese, white) (2012 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish (official), Guyanese Creole, Amerindian languages (including Caribbean and Arawak languages), Indian languages (including Caribbean Hindustani, a dialect of Hindi), Chinese (2014 est.)\n\nReligions\n\nProtestant 34.8% (Pentecostal 22.8%, Seventh Day Adventist 5.4%, Anglican 5.2%, Methodist 1.4%), Hindu 24.8%, Roman Catholic 7.1%, Muslim 6.8%, Jehovah's Witness 1.3%, Rastafarian 0.5%, other Christian 20.8%, other 0.9%, none 3.1% (2012 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nGuyana is the only English-speaking country in South America and shares cultural and historical bonds with the Anglophone Caribbean. Guyana's two largest ethnic groups are the Afro-Guyanese (descendants of African slaves) and the Indo-Guyanese (descendants of Indian indentured laborers), which together comprise about three quarters of Guyana's population. Tensions periodically have boiled over between the two groups, which back ethnically based political parties and vote along ethnic lines. Poverty reduction has stagnated since the late 1990s. About one-third of the Guyanese population lives below the poverty line; indigenous people are disproportionately affected. Although Guyana's literacy rate is reported to be among the highest in the Western Hemisphere, the level of functional literacy is considerably lower, which has been attributed to poor education quality, teacher training, and infrastructure.Guyana's emigration rate is among the highest in the world - more than 55% of its citizens reside abroad - and it is one of the largest recipients of remittances relative to GDP among Latin American and Caribbean counties. Although remittances are a vital source of income for most citizens, the pervasive emigration of skilled workers deprives Guyana of professionals in healthcare and other key sectors. More than 80% of Guyanese nationals with tertiary level educations have emigrated. Brain drain and the concentration of limited medical resources in Georgetown hamper Guyana's ability to meet the health needs of its predominantly rural population. Guyana has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the region and continues to rely on international support for its HIV treatment and prevention programs.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 25.38%(male 95,740 /female 92,282)\n\n15-24 years: 21.55%(male 81,676 /female 77,942)\n\n25-54 years: 38.52%(male 149,199 /female 136,129)\n\n55-64 years: 8.15%(male 27,684 /female 32,678)\n\n65 years and over: 6.39%(male 19,336 /female 28,019) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 53.5 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 45.8 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 7.7 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 13.3 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 26.7 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 26.3 years\n\nfemale: 27 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 148\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.48% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 156\n\nBirth rate\n\n15.4 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 118\n\nDeath rate\n\n7.4 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 115\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-3.2 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 180\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation is heavily concentrated in the northeast in and around Georgetown, with noteable concentrations along the Berbice River to the east;

The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six commodities - sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. Guyana closed or consolidated several sugar estates in 2017, reducing production of sugar to a forecasted 147,000 tons in 2018, less than half of 2017 production. Much of Guyana's growth in recent years has come from a surge in gold production. With a record-breaking 700,000 ounces of gold produced in 2016, Gold production in Guyana has offset the economic effects of declining sugar production. In January 2018, estimated 3.2 billion barrels of oil were found offshore and Guyana is scheduled to become a petroleum producer by March 2020.Guyana's entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy in January 2006 broadened the country's export market, primarily in the raw materials sector. Guyana has experienced positive growth almost every year over the past decade. Inflation has been kept under control. Recent years have seen the government's stock of debt reduced significantly - with external debt now less than half of what it was in the early 1990s. Despite these improvements, the government is still juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank, Guyana's principal donor, canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million debt, equivalent to 21% of GDP, which along with other Highly Indebted Poor Country debt forgiveness, brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 52% in 2017. Guyana had become heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking, state-led development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$6.301 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$6.169 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$5.969 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 171\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$3.561 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n2.1% (2017 est.)\n\n3.4% (2016 est.)\n\n3.1% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 146\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$8,100 (2017 est.)\n\n$8,000 (2016 est.)\n\n$7,800 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 151\n\nGross national saving\n\n10.5% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n15% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n8.8% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 161\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 71.1% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 18.2% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 25.4% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 47.8% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -63% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 15.4% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 15.3% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 69.3% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\nsugarcane, rice, edible oils;

Guyana has expressed its intention to join Barbados in asserting claims before UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that Trinidad and Tobago's maritime boundary with Venezuela extends into their waters; Suriname claims a triangle of land between the New and Kutari/Koetari Rivers in a historic dispute over the headwaters of the Courantyne\n\nTrafficking in persons\n\ncurrent situation: Guyana is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor – children are particularly vulnerable; women and girls from Guyana, Venezuela, Suriname, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic are forced into prostitution in Guyana’s interior mining communities and urban areas; forced labor is reported in mining, agriculture, forestry, domestic service, and shops; Guyanese nationals are also trafficked to Suriname, Jamaica, and other Caribbean countries for sexual exploitation and forced labor\n\ntier rating: Tier 2 Watch List – Guyana does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, Guyana was granted a waiver from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3 because its government has a written plan that, if implemented would constitute making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; the government released its anti-trafficking action plan in June 2014 but made uneven efforts to implement it; law enforcement was weak, investigating seven trafficking cases, prosecuting four alleged traffickers, and convicting one trafficker – a police officer – who was released on bail pending appeal; in 2014, as in previous years, Guyanese courts dismissed the majority of ongoing trafficking prosecutions; the government referred some victims to care services, which were provided by NGOs with little or no government support (2015)\n\nIllicit drugs\n\ntransshipment point for narcotics from South America - primarily Venezuela - to Europe and the US;
