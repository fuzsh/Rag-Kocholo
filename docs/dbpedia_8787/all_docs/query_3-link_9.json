        "text": "Guyana is a country located in Northern South America and is culturally part of the Anglophone Caribbean. It is bordered by the North Atlantic Ocean between Suriname, Venezuela, and Brazil. The government system is a republic; the chief of state is the president, and the head of government is the prime minister. Guyana has a largely traditional economic system in which the majority of the population engages in subsistence agriculture, and the allocation of available resources is made on the basis of primitive methods. Guyana is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)."
