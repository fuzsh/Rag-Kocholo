        "text": "Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America. Located on the northern coast of the continent, the country has strong ties to Caribbean nations that share their language. It's also known for its beautiful rainforests, and produces rice and sugarcane. Samaritan’s Purse began delivering Operation Christmas Child shoebox gifts to children here in 2000. Since 2009, we have also offered The Greatest Journey, our follow-up discipleship program, to these shoebox recipients.\n\nRead Stories from the Field\n\nPray for Your Shoebox Recipient\n\n“Whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”—Matthew 21:22\n\nPlease don’t stop praying for the boy or girl that you first lifted up when you packed your shoebox. Continue to ask God to soften his or her heart to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, so that he or she will follow Him all the days of their life. Pray also for families and entire communities to be transformed as God’s love is shared through your simple gift.\n\nThe Greatest Journey\n\nAfter your shoebox gift delights a boy or girl, you can give them the opportunity to participate in The Greatest Journey.\n\nTaught by trained local teachers, this 12-lesson discipleship program shows children how to follow Christ and share Him with others. As boys and girls share the Scripture stories they learn in class, their friends and family come to faith—growing churches, starting new congregations, and transforming communities by the power of the Gospel.\n\nSend a child on The Greatest Journey for just $6!\n\nMonthly Gift Single Gift\n\nRecord Where Your Shoebox Went\n\nOur Follow Your Box Map is specifically designed for you to keep track over multiple years where your shoebox gifts have blessed children in need.\n\nConsider displaying one in your church or home as a reminder to pray for the boys and girls who have been blessed by your generosity.\n\nOrder Now"
