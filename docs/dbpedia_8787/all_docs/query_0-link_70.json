        "text": "Trademark registration becomes more and more important globally including in Guyana, a country with great potential for economic development such as abundant natural resources, favorable geographical location and investment environment that attracts domestic and foreign investors. Guyana is on track to become a potential oil powerhouse with reserves of more than 11 billion barrels. The economy grew strongly thanks to oil exports, which are expected to reach $16.3 billion by 2024. Guyana also has large reserves of gold, diamonds, bauxite and manganese ore. Guyana possesses more than 80% of pristine rainforest, with potential for logging and ecotourism development. Guyana has plenty of land suitable for agricultural cultivation, facilitating the development of food production and exports. Located on the Atlantic coast, Guyana is strategically located for international trade. The Port of Georgetown could receive Panamax ships, facilitating the export of cargo. To attract domestic and foreign capital, the Guyanese government is making efforts to improve the investment environment and attract foreign capital. In addition, the Guyanese government also offers many tax incentives and other supports for businesses. Therefore, more and more businesses are expanding their business scope here. In order to be able to distinguish their brand from other competitors, enterprises need to pay attention to the procedure for issuing trademark titles. Viet An Law Firm would like to guide customers preliminarily the procedures for issuing trademark certificates in Guyana through the article below.\n\nTable of contents\n\nHide\n\nLegal basis\n\n“Trademark Law (Law No. 67 of 1952, as amended by Law No. 4 of 1972)\n\nGeneral overview of trademarks in Guyana\n\nDefinition of “trademark”\n\nA trademark definition in Guyana is a mark used or intended to be used in relation to goods. A trademark can be an image, brand, title, label, ticket, name, signature, word, digit, or a combination of these elements. The purpose of a trademark is to indicate a connection between the goods and the person or company granted the license as the owner of the trademark. To put it more simply, a trademark is a symbol, word, or phrase that helps identify a particular product or service and differentiate it from competitors. By granting a trademark certificate, businesses will receive legal protection against others using the same or similar mark for their goods or services.\n\nTypes of trademarks that can grant protection certificates\n\nTrademarks: This is the most common type. This type of trademark includes trademarks used on a product or its packaging to identify its origin and distinguish it from competitors’ products. Trademarks belong to classes 1 to 34 according to the Nice Classification. Current restrictions: Guyana does not currently allow direct awarding of titles by service marks (grades 35 to 45).\n\nCollective mark: This type of mark is used to identify the goods or services of the members of an association. Collective branding is useful for groups or cooperatives for branding.\n\nCertification mark: This type of mark certifies specific characteristics of a product or service, such as quality, origin, or ingredients. Certification marks are often used by organizations that independently set standards.\n\nConditions for granting trademark titles in Guyana\n\nDistinguishability: The trademark must be able to distinguish the applicant’s goods or services from other products. This means that the trademark must not be a generic term or a descriptive element directly related to the product.\n\nLegal: A trademark must not offend, deceive, or violate any existing law or trademark.\n\nNewness: A trademark must not be identical or confusingly similar to a mark issued in Guyana for similar goods or services.\n\nTrademark Title Dossier in Guyana\n\nTo issue a trademark title in Guyana, the applicant needs to prepare a complete dossier submitted to the Property and Trade Qualifications Authority (DCRA) of Guyana that includes the usually essential documents in the application:\n\nTrademark Title Application Form: DCRA provides a standard application form. The applicant should complete the required information, including:\n\nInformation about the applicant: Name, address, nationality.\n\nBrand information: Logo, wording, or logo image (if applicable).\n\nList of classes of goods or services under the Nice Classification to which the applicant wishes to grant a trademark title.\n\nDetailed copy of the trademark: A clear copy is required that shows exactly the sign that the applicant wants to grant a protection certificate.\n\nTitle fee receipt: Pay the fee at the prevailing DCRA rate.\n\nAdditional documents may be needed:\n\nPower of attorney (if any): If the applicant applies through an intellectual property representative to file the application.\n\nStatement of ownership (if necessary): In some cases, DCRA requires a statement of legal ownership of a trademark.\n\nNotarized translation (if necessary): If the applicant’s original document is not in English, a notarized translation into English should be provided.\n\nFees for issuance of trademark titles in Guyana\n\nThe Trademark Title Fee in Guyana consists of two main fees:\n\nFiling Fee: This is a one-time fee collected by the Property and Commerce Authority (DCRA) when an applicant files for a trademark title. As of 2024, the application fee is around GYD 15,000.\n\nTitle issuance fee (if successful): If the applicant’s application for a title of trademark is approved, the applicant will need to pay an additional fee to obtain a certificate of grant of the title. This fee is usually lower than the application fee and can range around 200 GYD.\n\nThere are also some other additional fees such as appraisal fees, gazette publication fees, or objection fees.\n\nHow to file a trademark application in Guyana\n\nTo file for trademark protection in Guyana, you can file using the following filing methods:\n\nDirect Submission: You can go directly to the Property and Commerce Qualification Authority (DCRA) at Lot 1 High and Commerce Streets, Georgetown, Guyana to submit your application and related documents.\n\nBy Post or Fax: You may send your application form and all required documents via postal or courier service to the address of the Property and Commerce Title Authority (DCRA) at Lot 1 High and Commerce Streets, Georgetown, Guyana.\n\nTrademark registration service in Guyana of Viet An Law Firm\n\nPerform the search and notify customers in writing of the results of trademark search in Guyana;\n\nDraft dossiers and directly file and monitor the status of trademark application filings in Guyana on behalf of trademark owners;\n\nInform, advise and handle deficiencies/refusals of competent State agencies (if any) in the process of monitoring trademark applications in Guyana;\n\nAssist in monitoring, representing the resolution of objections and feedback with intellectual property representatives carrying out procedures in Guyana.\n\nReceive dispatches, certificates and hand over to customers (if any)."
