        "meta_description": "Introduction Diabetes prevalence has never been measured in Guyana. We conducted a nationally representative cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes, and the association between sex and diabetes.\n\nResearch design and methods In 2016, the Ministry of Public Health led Guyana’s first national STEPS survey among adults aged 18–69 years. Half of the participants were randomly selected for hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose testing. We estimated the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes and measured the association between sex and diabetes prevalence using logistic regression to compute adjusted ORs.\n\nResults We included 805 adults (511 women, 294 men, mean age 41.8 (SD 14.4) years). The national prevalence of diabetes was 18.1% (95% CI: 15.4% to 20.8%), with higher rates among women (21.4%, 95% CI: 18.0% to 24.7%) than men (15.1%, 95% CI: 10.9% to 19.3%). Sex-specific diabetes prevalence varied significantly across urban and rural areas (p=0.002 for interaction). In rural areas, diabetes was twice as common among women (24.1%, 95% CI: 20.1% to 28.2%) compared with men (11.8%, 95% CI: 7.7% to 15.9%). After adjusting for prespecified covariates, rural women had double the odds of diabetes compared with rural men (OR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.20 to 3.82). This prevalence pattern was reversed in urban areas (diabetes prevalence, women: 13.9%, 95% CI: 8.7% to 19.0%; men: 22.0%, 95% CI: 12.9% to 31.1%), with urban women having half the odds of diabetes compared with urban men (OR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.99). We estimated that nearly one-third of women and over a quarter of men had diabetes or pre-diabetes.\n\nConclusions The burden of diabetes in Guyana is considerably higher than previously estimated, with an unexpectedly high prevalence among women—particularly in rural areas.",

        "text": "Results\n\nThe study cohort included 805 adults (online supplementary appendix figure 1). Baseline characteristics are shown in table 1 and online supplementary appendix table 2. There were more women (63.5%) than men (35.4%), but age distributions were similar across sexes (mean age 41.8 (SD 14.4) years). Obesity was more than twice as common among women (36.6%) than men (16.0%), while blood pressure was similar across sexes. A quarter of men (24.8%) smoked versus 2.0% of the women. Most (83.0%) men and half (49.7%) of the women were employed. Most participants attained primary school education or higher. There were more women than men in the lowest income bracket (43.1% vs 35.4% respectively). Nearly half (45.3%) of the study population lived in Demerara-Mahaica, and most participants (72.3%) resided in rural areas. The most common ethnicity was East Indian (41.2%), followed by African (29.1%) and Amerindian (Indigenous, 9.3%). Most participants (76.1%) reported two or less servings of fruit or vegetables per day. More men (61.9%) than women (37.8%) reported ≥10 hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week.\n\nThe national prevalence of diabetes was 18.1% (95% CI: 15.4% to 20.8%; table 2; online supplementary appendix table 3), with higher rates among women (21.4%, 95% CI: 18.0% to 24.7%) than men (15.1%, 95% CI: 10.9% to 19.3%). Sex-specific diabetes prevalence varied significantly across urban and rural areas (p=0.002 for interaction). In rural areas, diabetes was twice as common among women (24.1%, 95% CI: 20.1% to 28.2%) compared with men (11.8%, 95% CI: 7.7% to 15.9%). After adjusting for prespecified covariates, rural women had double the odds of diabetes compared with rural men (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.20 to 3.82; figure 1; online supplementary appendix table 4). This prevalence pattern was reversed in urban areas (diabetes prevalence, women: 13.9%, 95% CI: 8.7% to 19.0%; men: 22.0%, 95% CI: 12.9% to 31.1%), with urban women having half the odds of diabetes compared with urban men (OR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.99). Among women, rural residence was associated with double the odds of diabetes versus urban residence (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.06), while rural men had half the odds of diabetes versus urban men (OR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.99). Diabetes prevalence appeared to differ by ethnicity, with the highest estimates among East Indians (19.7%, 95% CI: 15.5% to 24.0%) and Africans (17.1%, 95% CI: 11.6% to 22.5%; online supplementary appendix table 4). Older age was associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes (OR 6.3, 95% CI: 2.9 to 13.7, for age 60–69 vs 18–29 years). Pre-diabetes rates were similar among women (10.4%, 95% CI: 7.4% to 13.4%) and men (12.0%, 95% CI: 7.9% to 16.1%), but varied by ethnicity, with the highest rates among East Indians (12.5%, 95% CI: 8.3% to 16.8%). Using only FBG values, weighted national estimates (accounting for missingness by region) of diabetes and pre-diabetes prevalence were lower than estimates using A1C only, with the exception of pre-diabetes among women, which displayed the opposite pattern (online supplementary appendix tables 5–6).\n\nWe estimated that nearly one-third of women (70 000 of 220 000) and over a quarter of men (60 000 of 221 000) in Guyana had diabetes or pre-diabetes in 2016 (figure 2; online supplementary appendix table 7). Over half (47 000 women and 33 000 men) of them had diabetes, and most of them lived in rural areas. The estimated number of women and men with diabetes dropped by 37.0% and 51.1% when using FBG only, and by 21.4% and 13.0% when using A1C only. A similar pattern was observed among men with pre-diabetes, but the estimated number of women with pre-diabetes was 11.3% higher using FBG only, and 20.5% lower using A1C only. Around two-thirds (women: 70.5%, men: 63.8%) of the participants with diabetes were aware of their diagnosis (online supplementary appendix table 8).\n\nThe distribution of missing A1C values (21.2%) was similar across most demographic characteristics (online supplementary appendix table 9). There were fewer missing A1C values among Amerindian (Indigenous) people versus East Indians (OR 0.2, 0.0–0.8) and in the Pomeroon-Supenaam region versus Demerara-Mahaica (OR 0.1, 0.0–0.5). Missing FBG values (25.1%) were similarly distributed across most characteristics except for region; four regions had a significantly higher OR of missing FBG values.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis is the first nationally representative study describing diabetes prevalence and its correlates among men and women in Guyana. Using a combination of A1C and FBG tests, we found that the diabetes prevalence rate was 21.4% among women and 15.1% among men, and that approximately one in three women and one in four men in Guyana had diabetes or pre-diabetes in 2016. These estimates are substantially higher than those using FBG only or previous estimates using data from other countries,20 thus demonstrating that A1C measurements would significantly improve on the accuracy of diabetes prevalence estimation in STEPS surveys. After accounting for obesity and other important covariates, we found that rural women had double the odds of diabetes compared with rural men, while urban women had half the odds of diabetes compared with urban men—an unexpected interaction that has never been previously described. Furthermore, rural women had double the odds of diabetes versus urban women, whereas rural men had half the odds of diabetes versus urban men. Considering that one-third of the people with diabetes were previously undiagnosed, these stark findings emphasize the urgent need to address the substantial burden of diabetes in Guyana—especially among rural women.\n\nAs we and others have reported, the over-representation of women with diabetes in Caribbean nations such as Guyana is a poorly understood phenomenon that appears isolated to the Caribbean and southern Africa.4 5 21 In adulthood, male sex is a biological risk factor associated with a higher type 2 diabetes risk than female sex, due in part to increased insulin resistance, at any given body mass index.19 22 This biological relationship may be offset by a relatively higher prevalence of obesity among Caribbean women versus men5 21—a gender difference rooted in the sociocultural perception of obese women as being healthier.23 We found that obesity was more than doubled among women versus men, which is similar to other Caribbean populations.24 As waist circumference was a relatively stronger correlate of diabetes among women than men,19 the observed excess in female diabetes prevalence appeared to be partially attributable to a higher prevalence of female obesity.\n\nHowever, diabetes prevalence was paradoxically highest among rural women, despite having a lower prevalence of obesity compared with urban women (34.2% vs 39.5%; online supplementary appendix table 10). After accounting for ethnicity and the sex-specific effects of obesity, female sex was independently associated with double the odds of diabetes versus male sex in rural areas, whereas urban women had half the odds of diabetes versus urban men. The reasons for this phenomenon—which has never been previously reported to our knowledge—are unclear. In an exploratory post hoc analysis, physical activity was significantly higher among men versus women (p<0.0001; online supplementary appendix figure 2). Weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity appeared higher among rural versus urban men (median 22.0 vs 12.0 min per week, p=0.1), whereas women appeared less active in rural versus urban areas (median 3.7 vs 6.0 min per week, p=0.06). However, these self-reported values varied widely, and subjective measures of physical activity may be unreliable.25 26 Other correlates such as income, education, employment, and smoking were not independently associated with diabetes in our study. Further research is required to understand whether objectively measured physical activity, dietary differences, or novel risk factors may explain the interaction between sex and rurality, and the especially high prevalence of diabetes among rural women.\n\nAs the first national diabetes study in Guyana and one of the first STEPS studies to include both A1C and FBG, our results suggest that the use of FBG only would have substantially underestimated diabetes prevalence in our population. The International Diabetes Federation Atlas (2017) previously proposed lower prevalence estimates of diabetes (11.3%, 9.7%–15.2% for ages 20–79 years) by extrapolating from other nations.20 While STEPS surveys are often the only reliable source of national diabetes data in low- and middle-income countries,20 the STEPS protocol only includes FBG measurements to diagnose diabetes.9 10 In this study, we additionally included A1C measurements, which are increasingly accessible and potentially cheaper to collect as a single, untimed test.27 We found that FBG underestimated the prevalence of diabetes versus A1C, which is consistent with a meta-analysis reporting similar patterns in Caribbean and South Asian nations.28 However, this pattern was not observed in other regions and was reversed in high-income western countries,28 suggesting that A1C measurements may be uniquely important in Caribbean populations to accurately estimate diabetes burden. For example, a cross-sectional survey in Barbados reported that nearly two-thirds of people were classified as having dysglycemia using A1C and FBG versus one quarter using FBG only.29 Future prevalence studies in the Caribbean region should consider including A1C tests at least among a subset of participants of different ethnicities,16 as previous Caribbean studies using only FBG values may have underestimated the true prevalence of diabetes.\n\nOur study fills a major knowledge gap by providing directly measured national and subnational diabetes and pre-diabetes prevalence estimates, and uncovering an important interaction between sex and urban or rural residence on diabetes prevalence in Guyana. Strengths of our study include the nationally representative sample, the use of both A1C and FBG measurements for better diagnostic accuracy, and the inclusion of many detailed demographic, behavioral, and anthropometric variables for statistical adjustment. Study limitations include missing data for inaccessible and remote areas due to logistical difficulties. Although we weighted estimates to account for missingness by region, our findings should be considered conservative, as some participants with only one A1C or FBG test may have had unidentified diabetes. While the D-10 System measures A1C accurately in the presence of heterozygous hemoglobin variants,30 31 measurements among the small minority of people with compound heterozygous or homozygous hemoglobin variants (likely <0.4%32 33) may have been falsely normal. As in other similar studies,34 the relative lack of men present in the household during the survey may have introduced selection bias.\n\nIn conclusion, the burden of diabetes in Guyana is considerably higher than previously estimated, with a strikingly high prevalence of diabetes among women—particularly in rural areas. Further research is needed to characterize patterns of diabetes prevalence in other Caribbean settings, to understand how determinants of diabetes affect women and men differently across rural and urban areas, and to study how sex and age affect diabetes development and progression. There is an urgent need to improve diabetes awareness and identification, and to prevent or delay diabetes among people with pre-diabetes. While these efforts must be scaled carefully to ensure sufficient capacity within local health systems,29 35 future progress will require ongoing investment in the current initiatives of the Ministry of Public Health to improve diabetes screening,36 management,37 and outcomes.38"
