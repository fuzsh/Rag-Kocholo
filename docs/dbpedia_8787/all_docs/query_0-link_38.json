They were under a five-year contract and had to work on the sugar plantations for the duration of their indentureship. While they tried to persist their Indian culture, assimilation in their new environments and interaction with people of different cultures, allowed them to develop a culture unique to Indo Guyanese heritage.\nThis thesis focuses on the history of Indian diaspora in Guyana. It evokes the struggles they faced on the ships, and during and after indentureship. It also touches on the political and racial issues they had to withstand in order to develop as a part of the nation. It further investigates how the fusion of cultures, food, dress, and entertainment allowed them to cultivate a new and unique culture.",
