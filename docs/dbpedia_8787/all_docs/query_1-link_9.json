Write down your answer. If you don’t know, take a guess, and write it down. The wording of the definitions above will vary slightly from the ones in the Trilogy. But they are more or less the same.\n\nGood luck on your quest for knowledge. Keep your original answer in a place where you will find it. As you turn the pages, if you realize that you have the wrong answer, then write down your new answer. As you continue reading, if your answer continues to change, write it down.

Through this study guide, I will expand on the definitions, bringing more clarifications…Fisal Ally\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTHIS STUDY GUIDE MAKES CLARIFICATIONS ON THE misconceptions of the term coolie used in Guyana. As the love story and events in the novels in the Trilogy of Savitri’s Garden unfolds, knowledge is presented to teach the history of the Indian laborers.\n\nIn general, similar clarifications on the misconceptions in this study guide and in the novels can also be applied to Jamaica, Trinidad, and the other islands in the Caribbean where the Indian laborers had entered to cultivate the sugar plantations. Similar analyses can be carried out to clarify the misconceptions of the Indians that had entered many other countries in the 1800s and 1900s where the term ‘coolie’ was use or is still being used.\n\nDuring my research over the years, I have linked many pieces of information from many sources. I came up with three definitions that place the Indians in three categories. Everyone is aware of the first definition. I came up with two other definitions based on my research to assist us in our learning, and for explaining who the Indians were that had entered British Guiana in 1838, and where they came from in India.\n\nWe must be clear that not everyone in India were labeled as coolies. In India people were grouped into classes, such as the coolie class of workers because of the type of work they performed. We must also ask questions such as, who were the Indians that had boarded the ships? Which class or classes they came from? What part of India they came from? It is important to understand who were labeled as coolies, and who were not labeled as coolies in India. It does not mean because a person had ended up on a ship heading to the colonies that that person was a coolie in India or should now be called coolie. For example, an Indian doctor on the ship treating the Indian emigrants on the ship was not labeled as a coolie. We are all aware that the term, coolie, was generalized to all Indians that had entered British Guiana, but that does not make the use of the term correct. In Guiana, there were people from many backgrounds arriving at the same time the Indians were arriving to work as indentured laborers, such as the Portuguese, new Africans from Africa, Maltese and later the Chinese, but they were not given the label coolie, and many were also paid cheaply; they were doing the type of work on the sugar plantations as the Indians did.\n\nMany had already discredited the use of the term coolie. In this study guide and in the trilogy, I had taken the time to present how I’ve also discredited (debunked) the incorrect use of the term, coolie in Guyana.\n\nTo make these clarifications, I often use the labels coolie and hill-coolie for explaining and for demonstration purposes only. This study guide is based on the time period from 1836 to 1843. Since the majority of the first group of Indians had emigrated through the Port of Kolkata in 1838 from the northern region of India, I have only discussed Kolkata—and not Madras or Bombay—to make these clarifications. Indian emigration from Madras to British Guiana had begun in 1845 through the Port of Madras, which is not discussed in this study guide.\n\nThe samples provided in this study guide came from the Trilogy of Savitri’s Garden and was modified, and may be modified in upcoming revisions. As mentioned earlier, the spellings of Calcutta and Kolkata, Guiana and Guyana, and other names such as Hindustan and India are used interchangeably.\n\nHOW INDIAN EMIGRATION BEGAN BRITISH GUIANA\n\nIN 1836, JOHN GLADSTONE OF ENGLAND HAD REQUESTED laborers for his plantations in British Guiana because slavery was coming to an end and there would be a shortage of laborers to upkeep production on his plantations. Below is a sample of the letter from the Kolkata shipping agent, Messrs. Gillanders, Arbuthnot & Co. to John Gladstone:\n\n\"The tribe that is found to suit best in the Mauritius is from the hills to the north o Calcutta, and the men of which are all well-limbed and active…. The Hill tribes, known by the name of Dhangurs…In sending men to such a distance, it would of course be necessary to be more particular in selecting them….\n\n(Source of sample: Copy of letter from Messrs. Gillanders, Arbuthnot & Co. To John Gladstone, Esq. Calcutta, 6 June, 1836, also see appendix for a copy.)\n\nAccording to the letter, when it comes to exporting laborers from the Port of Kolkata to work in the British colonies in agriculture, the shipping agent had discussed sending the hardy agricultural laborers known as the Dhangurs that were skilled and experienced in agriculture to get the work done efficiently and timely. The Dhangurs were also in demand by the planters in Mauritius to cultivate their sugar plantations.\n\nAn excerpt from chapter 8 explains the three definitions and categories I had grouped the Indian workers in India into.\n\nIndian Ocean—Monday, March 5, 1838\n\nMary, let the shippers, their agents and their duffadars figure it out for themselves. You and I cannot save the whole world.\n\nIf each one of us makes a little bit of a difference, the world shall be saved.\n\nAnd—and why are we talking about that young lady again?\n\nLearning of the deceptions and kidnappings to supply the British colonies with Indian laborers had made her upset. She regretted boarding the ship and traveling to British Guiana. A few seconds went by and she had a sudden"
