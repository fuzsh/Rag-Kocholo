        "text": "A gem of South America, Guyana, stuns with its natural beauty. Nestled between Venezuela and Suriname, this unique country has a colonial past, which has led to it being the only English-speaking nation in South America. While geographically South American, Guyana is historically and culturally connected to the Caribbean.\n\nWith 90% of the population living on the coast, the vast interior remains a largely untouched paradise teeming with life and breathtaking landscapes. For tourists, Guyana offers a transformative travel experience: conservation travel. This goes beyond simple ecotourism. Here, it's a collaborative effort – visitors, local communities, and leaders working together. This \"SAVE\" (Scientific, Academic, Volunteer, and Educational) approach fosters deeper connections with nature and culture, to have a more positive impact on both the environment and the Guyanese people. Craving knowledge, cultural immersion, and a chance to make a difference? Guyana might be your perfect adventure. Prepare to explore and learn about this remarkable country.\n\nGuyana, Land of Many Waters\n\nGuyana Map & Flag\n\nGuyana on a map sits on the northern edge of South America, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the north. It's wedged between Suriname to the east, Brazil to the south and southwest, and Venezuela to the west.\n\nGuyana's flag, the Golden Arrowhead, uses 5 colors. Green symbolizes agriculture and forests, white represents rivers,gold represents mineral wealth, black shows strength, and red signifies nation-building zeal.\n\nGuyana Landscape & Geography\n\nGuyana's landscape is a stunning mix of ecosystems. Bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it boasts miles of golden savannahs, lush, virgin rainforests that dominate the country's centre, and hilly sand and clay regions. Along the coast lives 90% of Guyana's population, leaving the lush interior untouched.\n\nThe interior of the country features forested highlands that rise majestically, with the Pakaraima Mountains guarding the western border. Mount Roraima, Guyana's highest peak, pierces the clouds at a staggering 2,762 metres. Eco-lodges and indigenous villages lie hidden amongst the dense rainforests. The Kaieteur Plateau, home to the world's tallest single-drop waterfall – Kaieteur Falls – sits on the southern edge of the Pakaraimas. Further south, the Kanuku Mountains and Acarai Mountains greet you on the southern edge before giving way to the sprawling Rupununi Savannah. Remarkably, over 80% of Guyana's primary rainforest remains untouched, creating a haven for diverse wildlife, from the majestic Harpy Eagle to the fascinating Hoatzin, Guyana's national bird and a close relative of the first known bird, the Archaeopteryx.\n\nGuyana Culture\n\nGuyana's cultural landscape can be described as a mix of Caribbean culture and Indigenous roots. This rich blend reflects the country's diverse population – a mix of East Indians, Africans, Chinese, Portuguese, and Amerindian groups. Nine Indigenous Peoples call Guyana home, and their warm hospitality is experienced in community-run ecolodges. Here, visitors can share traditions and gain knowledge directly from these communities, helping them to preserve their heritage and way of life while providing economic benefits. These groups have been stewards of the country’s megadiversity for millennia, so there is a lot to be learnt.\n\nPhoto by Dinesh Chandrapal on Unsplash\n\nExploring Guyana's heritage is like flipping through a captivating history book. The architecture alone offers a window into the country’s past and present. The National Trust carefully preserves these historical sites.\n\nThe Guyanese way of life is known for its relaxed, Caribbean vibe along the coast. Travel south, however, and the influence of neighbouring Brazil becomes clear.\n\nAlthough English is the official language, creole is the most spoken language in Guyana, along with separate dialects of the Indigenous People and pockets of Portuguese spoken near the Brazilian border.\n\nGuyana Carnival, Festivals & Events\n\nGuyana's diverse culture comes alive through festivals and events:\n\nGuyana Cricket Carnival\n\nSeptember/October\n\nThe Cricket Carnival is a lively two-week event organised by the government and local private sector. The event offers a chance to discover the very best of Guyana whilst celebrating cricket and promoting tourism.\n\nFind more events on the Guyana Tourism events calendar.\n\nGuyana Food\n\nGuyana's fertile land and tropical climate create a paradise for foodies. Fresh vegetables, exotic fruits, grains, free-range meats, and a diversity of fish help to create a cuisine that is as diverse as the country itself. Guyanese cuisine is inspired by the Indigenous Peoples, who have always lived off the abundance of the land. Over time, influences from East Indians, Africans, the Chinese, and European colonial occupiers have all been woven into the culinary mix, as well as influences from neighbouring Caribbean nations.\n\nPhoto by Bonnie Kittle on Unsplash\n\nThe national dish is Pepperpot, a slow-cooked stew flavoured with spices and cassareep, a thick and aromatic syrup made from the juice of cassava. It's traditionally served with homemade bread or cassava bread, another traditional Indigenous dish.\n\nThings To Do in Guyana\n\nThere is plenty to do in Guyana. From hikes and treks, to mountain biking and paddling excursions suited for all levels of fitness.\n\nExplore Guyana’s mountains, rainforests and golden savannahs on an adventurous hike or trek. For experienced hikers, the challenging Makarapan Mountain or Kaieteur Overland Tour are great options. If you prefer something easier, consider the Iwokrama Forest Trail, Surama Nature Hike, or Saddle Mountain Trail.\n\nGo on an adventure safari in Guyana and get a glimpse into the local life in remote areas of Guyana.Annual safari events explore rugged regions over days or weeks, with stops at Indigenous villages, riverside camps, and eco-lodges.\n\nEmbark on a river adventure along the many waterways that crisscross Guyana, perfect for canoeing, kayaking, and river trips - a great activity for the most adventurous travellers!\n\nPhoto by Bonnie Kittle on Unsplash\n\nExplore the ‘Wild West’ of Guyana by staying at a working ranch in the South Rupununi region. This historic area boasts some of the world's largest and oldest cattle ranches and is home to a rich vaquero (cowboy) culture and traditions that still thrive today. Guests who stay at one of the working ranches can experience the cowboy lifestyle by saddling up and helping the vaqueros herd cattle from horseback, as well as cleaning and feeding the animals, and working on the adjacent farms.\n\nGuyana, known as the 'Land of Many Waters', is a great destination for fishing enthusiasts who want to experience the thrill of catching the world’s largest fish. With over 900 species of fish, including the largest-scaled freshwater fish in the world - the arapaima, Guyana offers a wide range of fish to catch. Other fish include the payara, pacu, tarpon, bashu, chimara and lukanani. However, it's important to note that most of these fish, especially the protected ones, are strictly “catch and release” in Guyana.\n\nGo on an unforgettable bird-watching trip in Guyana. The country is home to an array of tropical birds, making it a special highlight for bird lovers. There are numerous locations and trails in the country that are suitable for birdwatchers. It is recommended to stay at one of the birding and wildlife lodges to see the country's diverse range of birds.\n\nFind local handicraft souvenirs at Hibiscus Plaza. Hibiscus Plaza is a street market in the heart of the city. Cosy shops are packed with hand-made leather, cane, balata, and cloth goods.\n\nSee the tallest single-drop waterfall in the world! Fly to Kaieteur National Park from Georgetown in a small aircraft. Then, take a guided walk from the information centre to the three viewing points of the falls - Rainbow, Boy Scout, and Johnson. Each viewpoint offers a unique perspective of the falls. For those seeking more adventure, Kaieteur Falls can also be reached by an overland trek.\n\nYour Guyana\n\nWhile I poured over travel guides & researched online to craft this post, nothing compares to hearing about the Caribbean nation straight from those who've been there.\n\nSince I haven't had the privilege of visiting Guyana, I am reaching out to you!\n\nHow to share your Guyana...\n\nWe want to hear about YOUR Guyana.
