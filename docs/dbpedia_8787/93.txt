Guyana is a South American country located in the northeast above the Equator with the North Atlantic Ocean along its northern coastline. The country is bordered by Venezuela to the west, Suriname to the east and Brazil to the southwest. Guyana is the only English speaking country in the entire continent. It gained independence and also joined the Commonwealth on the 26th of May 1966. Later in 1970, Guyana’s official name was changed to the Cooperative Republic of Guyana.

The links between Hong Kong and Guyana date back to the 19th century. Labour shortages on sugar plantations led to Chinese labourers arriving in 1859-1866. Out of the 39 ships that arrived in British Guiana in this period, 21 sailed out of Hong Kong. A village in Berbice, Guyana was even labelled “Hong Kong Village” because the first settlers were Chinese who grew rice, and this name remains in use today.

The citizens of Guyana may travel to Hong Kong without a visa for a stay of up to 1 month. A visa is required if Guyanese citizens wish to work, study or reside in Hong Kong.
