Double Dragon is one of the most enduring beat 'em up franchises around. Limited Run recently announced physical copies of the Double Dragon Collection, Double Dragon Gaiden debuted to rave reviews in 2023 and later received online co-op, and River City Girls 2 is due to get Double Dragon DLC sometime this year. The arrival of fresh Double Dragon merchandise from Kumagumi (a Japanese merchandise label) is certainly appropriate, and there will be more to come.

Currently Available

Kumagumi has a couple of Double Dragon items available to purchase right now:

The Black Warriors Print (18 x 24 inches, $29)

Billy & Jimmy T-Shirt ($33 each)

Coming Soon

We had a sneak peak at several additional items that Kumagumi hopes to offer soon. Their full Double Dragon collection of merchandise is still pending Arc System Works approval, so these items are not available just yet.

The current and upcoming Double Dragon merchandise is really cool, even if a little expensive. Once t-shirts started to cost more than $30, I started buying less t-shirts. That said, I love the use of Japanese Famicom artwork on the Billy & Jimmy shirt. Let's hope the full lineup of items launches soon so fans can broadcast their enthusiasm to the world.
