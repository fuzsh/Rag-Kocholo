        "text": "PuppetMaster1986\n\n4.00 star(s)\n\nJun 22, 2024\n\nVersion: 3.0 (Final)\n\nThis game has been great so far, to the point where even the origional Double Dragon creator pitched in to help, though it's a bit too complex to be used on Android. It can be done, but it's more practical with a more physical controller. And take my advice, because this probably has the most expansive double dragon move set there is; Billy and Jimmy, the two characters I reccomend starting with, have stances to allow them to play like ALL their iterations. Double Dragon I/III, Double Dragon II, and Super Double Dragon.\n\nI feel as though the way the combos are situated are correspondent with various fighting games, as the Q has admitted to being a massive fan, and I also play a bit of fightcade myself. In any case, I played a lot of the Double Dragons, and they are the easiest in terms of making combos (there's a version without all the style switching as well), with each stance having it's own focus in terms of how you start juggles.\n\nChin and Ranzou are the hardest due to their tag team mechanic and not being able to easily regain POW. Then there's Shaq and Spawn, who play way better than one might believe, and are combo focused Jeff & Sonny, are like the Double Dragons, but with more unorthodox spins on their moveset (as if this system was ever done before). There's also apparently secret characters, probably the battle toads, though I didn't unlock them yet. The enemies themselves are rather competent and variety is thrown at you immediately, and you will find that performing combos isn't really practical unless they are all grouped up or you plan on aborting it with the other moves. All in all, I'd say it's game Double Dragon and Beat Em Up fans should try out.\n\nMy current gripe, aside from it being weird on current OpenBOR, is that for some reason, we get Gen-Satsu-Ken, but it's regulated to Jeff, who fights nothing like the previous users. As a matter of fact, I'm kind of disappointed that we don't get Raymond/The Mysterious Warrior to play with. Illusions and ki blasts would have been pretty fun to use in combat.\n\nMrNoone\n\n5.00 star(s)\n\nAug 5, 2023\n\nVersion: 0.91\n\nPlaying between both demo versions 0.9 and 0.8 (love the 16-bit remix provided in this one), and it is always a blast to play.\n\nTricky and platformer'ish level layout in mission 7B (available in ver0.9) which I realy like, as it complements the already good experiance. Can't wait for 7C in the final product.\n\nGetting good in this game and getting used to the enemy placement and exploiting their weakness, feels so goooood and rewarding (except 2x green Abobo's, still a f*cking pain x) ).\n\nIf there is one thing I would like to see implemented, it is a skip button for the intro sequences. These are cool and interesting for the first few times, but later feels like a big flow stop.\n\nOverall, easy 5 stars."
