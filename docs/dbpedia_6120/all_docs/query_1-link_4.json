I know it sounds odd since 99% of American SMS games had the reddish labels, (minus the Parker Bros. games) BUT a few of the games had a blue label variation. Why? I have no clue...\n\nHow do I know it's actually American then? I have a blue label version of an American only game - Reggie Jackson Baseball. Everywhere else it was American Baseball. There are a couple of other minor variations too with the box & manual I believe, but I'll have to double check it against my regular copy (it's been a while since I compared the two).\n\nFalcon\n\nSMS Pro Action Replay Code Archive\n\nJoined: 13 Jul 2001\n\nPosts: 184\n\nRe: Ozisoft blue cartridges\n\nPosted: Mon Mar 11, 2002 9:00 am\n\nQuote\n\n> > The blue label carts are US versions.

I think that re-releases and circa 1990 games had blue labels.\n\nQuote\n\n> I think the blue labels are australian.\n\nYes, Australia has many blue labels, such as Sonic, Sonic 2 and Wonderboy 3.\n\nThere are two kinds that I know of. The first has the name of the game on top, and the front looks like this (sorry my scanner's packed away somewhere, but I drew a somewhat accurate rendition. The fonts are wrong, but bad luck ay):\n\nNote that not all say 'Wonderboy 3: Dragon's Trap' on them. The second doesn't have a name on the front, and bloody hell mate if you're like me and never look at the top (like with Mega Drive games) of Sega cartridges you'd wonder what game it was. This one's on my Asterix and the Great Rescue cartridge:\n\nSo in conclusion, Ozisoft wanted to scam game owners with absolute rip-off phone lines. Not to mention the fact that Australian blue labels are quite different from US ones.\n\n-MaRkiSH\n\nBy the way, sorry about the dodgy pictures.\n\nLimbs a Flyin'\n\nGuest\n\nRe: Huh?\n\nPosted: Mon Mar 11, 2002 10:20 am\n\nQuote\n\n>\n\n> But I had a red labeled cart and all the people I met had a red labeled carts.

That is, the one I have though.\n\nMecha Godzilla\n\nGuest\n\nRe: Ozisoft blue cartridges\n\nPosted: Mon Mar 11, 2002 1:52 pm\n\nQuote\n\n> That doesn't mean that other types of labels didn't exist.

Armakuni was back and the world was a better place those days. My SMS collection was limited to Double Dragon, Rescue Mission, Ghostbusters, Hang On and Safari Hunt.\n\nBut if for some odd reason Richard C.C. is reading (you know who I am from my nickname. Godzilla remember?) on this messageboard (and I know you probably are you SEGA freak) I think Rambo First blood part 2 kicked ass. If you didnÂ´t like it you should have given it to me, you idiot. And I donÂ´t feel sorry for burning that NES Amagon cart on the microwave, bitch (that thing got like a ball of gray plastic and bubbly for just a few seconds).\n\nQuote\n\n>\n\n>\n\n95 cents a minute phones advertised on a cart!

A quick conversion at today's prices gives 45 US cents, 35p in the UK or 56 cents in countries using the Euro.\n\nMaxim\n\nMecha Godzilla\n\nGuest\n\nRe: 95 cents\n\nPosted: Mon Mar 11, 2002 2:12 pm\n\nQuote\n\n> > 95 cents a minute phones advertised on a cart!

I think now I know the nationality of the accountants Sega had during the late 90Â´s.\n\nI thought the original mail order version of Power Strike had a black and white case, but I don't know because I've never seen one.\n\nI've never seen a US blue cart either, though..."
