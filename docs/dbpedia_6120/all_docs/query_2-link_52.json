CityMall is poised to become the largest independently branded community mall chain in the country. The balance of 300,000 square meters of leasable space will be coming from two office projects in Metro Manila, namely DD Meridian Park in the Bay Area and Jollibee Tower in Ortigas CBD. The Company's flagship project in Metro Manila is DD Meridian Park, a 4.8 hectare prime commercial block located in the growing central business district of the Bay Area along the corners of Roxas Blvd., EDSA and Macapagal Ave. The first phase, DoubleDragon Plaza, which consists of four BPO Towers on top of a retail podium is currently under construction and slated for completion by 2018. DD Meridian Park, once fully built, will contribute 280,000 square meters of leasable space to DoubleDragon’s portfolio.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://doubledragon.com.ph/\n\nExternal link for DoubleDragon Corporation\n\nIndustry\n\nReal Estate\n\nCompany size\n\n501-1,000 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nPasay, Metro Manila\n\nType\n\nPrivately Held\n\nSpecialties\n\nReal Estate, Office Leasing, Industrial Leasing, Hospitality, and Provincial Commercial Leasing"
