        "text": "Hollywood has made a career out of trying to milk what is popular in the video game industry for quick crowd-pleasing cash grabs. In many cases though, they take these flimsy stories, blank characters, and horrible visuals to create something alive and beautiful. Sure, these movies aren’t all great, but the majority are quite tantalizing to the senses. Some of them stand out more than that though and approach the level of taking something almost non-existent from a two-button beat ‘em up and making art.\n\nThat may sound like a massive praise for a movie that many don’t remember, but I want to take a little time to point out how a film from an unproven director, a lowly comic book author, and a fantastic cast was thrown together to make one of the greatest underrated martial arts video game movies. Sit back, put the film on while you read, and prepare for ninety-six minutes of post-apocalyptic bliss.\n\n“AIR MAIL!”\n\nFor this review I re-watched this spectacle on both my VHS and Laserdisc copies—to which I recommend the latter—and yes, these are my originals from their release in 1995. It’s a day I remember quite well as I skipped school to pick this up in costume (I lost the picture, unfortunately). I was actually considering a new show for my YouTube channel where I expose viewers to classics they haven’t seen or forgotten, Dude You Haven’t Seen This Movie? Unfortunately, I saw that the LJN Defender had stolen yet another of my ideas! This would have been the first episode of that, which could still come! I could talk about this forever.\n\nDouble Dragon, like in the video game, takes place in the year 2007 where a major earthquake and climate change has wrecked everything. This is where the movie gets its first real praise in an impressive looking post-apocalyptic city with tons of color, debris, and graffiti. According to DariaPlays, this is some of the best model work you can find in cinema. Now I’ve never been anywhere near California because they have sunlight there, but this looks so different than anything someone would find over in the City of Angels (called New Angeles here) and is completely unrecognizable with abandoned buildings, large trucks, and a station wagon with a rocket strapped to it they call the Dragon Wagon! This all screams 90s—the best decade!\n\nNot since Manimal have I seen a graphical presentation like this pop off the screen. The faded colors are purposefully implemented to show the washing out of emotion, punching the viewer in the face with expression like a Technicolor dojo.\n\n“This movie really did punch me in the face.” –A. Haden, Hawaii Times\n\nThis is before I even go into the excellent VR scenes. They’re so colorful and hold up well with their lack of detail and slower camera movements. This showed some forward thinking, making those scenes still pop even today. There are wonderful practical effects also, like with the transformed Abobo. I was so worried he would look normal for the whole film—almost a meatier Nefarious Wes—like at the beginning, but the makeup is pulsating and lifelike. I love the turn in his story also, fighting alongside the Lee brothers, but my favorite part is where Marian fed him spinach to torture him with violent gas. That was different and kept the movie’s tone.\n\nAbobo isn’t the only great character though. There are Billy and Jimmy, of course, played by Scott Wolf and Mark Dacascos. The first is an amazing physical performer who pushes the script to its limits., with ferocity and comedic timing. Wolf shaped my childhood with Lady and the Tramp 2, Party of Five (which I know everyone loved) and shoutout to the LT Showcase for reminding me that he was in eight episodes of Saved by the Bell as a nameless waiter. How could I have forgotten that!? Although Dacascos was not the better martial artist—he did sprain his ankle the first day of shooting and almost ruined the production—he showed a ton of promise in Kickboxer 5 and that episode of Dragnet.\n\nThe main antagonist, Koga Shuko, is expertly played by Robert Patrick, who I am not too familiar with other than him being the cop in a Nine Inch Nails video I watched once and an episode of Captain Planet and the Planeteers. I do hear I should check out his role in what is said to be an excellent movie also, Hong Kong ’97. His look is perfect in this though, as seen by how Johnny Depp has begun adopting a form of it here in 2019. He exudes cool, especially in scenes with his henchmen, like where they all pull off their shades in unison—so cool! I think they were right to make up a new main villain instead of using someone from the game. I doubt anyone could even name that guy, and Shuko’s shadow powers were amazing.\n\n“That was a movie I did that, on paper, I thought could really work. It, uh, didn’t really work that well… There’s some funny aspects to that character, and it was a fairly liberating experience to be funny and try to be menacing at the same time. I am proud of my performance. It’s a pretty extreme performance.”\n\nThis quote from actor Robert Patrick shows how he realized that some people didn’t understand his character or the movie in general, and it comes out more in some of the odd reviews I’ve seen.\n\n“It’s like Bill and Ted, if Bill and Ted were a martial arts movie” –Donovan ‘One Eye’ Something\n\nThe award for best female character goes to Satori, played by Julia Nickson, whose accolades include SeaQuest 2032 and Power Rangers Wild Force. No, she isn’t just the best character for her gender, but possibly in the whole movie. Her role is integral to the plot and Bimmy and Jimmy’s upbringing. I’m not actually sure what her relationship to them is (sister I think), but she helps to make them more relatable and shows her real strength by trying to let the boys break her out of the cage but then doing it herself when they can’t. Her death scene is masterful, gripping, and honestly a tearjerker. The decision not to show much of anything and essentially do it off-screen with a massive explosion shows how to handle taking out important characters (Game of Thrones could learn something here). She is the lynchpin of the Double Dragons.\n\nThere is also Alyssa Milano playing Marian, the object of affection. She is so hot that I’m shocked the brothers weren’t fighting over her! I originally discovered this steamy temptress in cool futuristic clothing through The Dali Popka when he recommended Embrace of the Vampire, but she is supposedly better known for something called Who’s the Boss? I hadn’t heard of this before but they make a hilarious joke referencing it, so I looked it up and laughed. She embodies another side of the family theme, bringing her real-life little brother in to get that real chemistry in for those couple of scenes.\n\nThe comedy here is top notch. I love all of these one-liners because they are outside references and don’t interrupt the flow of the movie at all. At one point Shuko is speaking to his two henchmen, Huey and Lewis, and asks them, “what’s the news?” That’s still killing me just typing it out! This is only the type of comedy you get from great writing or a Rewind Mike stream.\n\nThis epic was written by a guy that had only done cartoons and comics beforehand, Paul Dini, and I hope he did more after this success. He teamed up with director Jim Yukich who came from doing music videos. Double Dragon was so good, so much the film that he wanted to make that he went back to doing more music videos afterward. Here we had a director who knew exactly what he wanted and didn’t let the game or its fans influence him.\n\n“Our characters are like normal kids-three kids on an adventure, so we didn’t want to make something that kids would almost be too afraid to see. I’d like to make it in a funnier, light-hearted vein.” –Yukich\n\nThe boys do act like kids and like real brothers too. They bicker and whine like any real person and not badasses until it’s time for them to be badass of course, then they look legit. They are so powerful at the end that the main antagonist doesn’t even try to fight back, which was neat to see for once.\n\nThat characterization was just the first of many wise decisions here. The plot was expanded by the medallion, better than the video game’s story where it’s just a fight through the city’s most powerful gangs in search of a girl. As a fighting movie, it excels since they let the heroes tear up some of the punks like a dog’s chutoy. There are great real explosions used here too, not CGI, where most of Cleveland, Ohio was alerted when the boat scene stunts were happening. That’s real movie magic. The soundtrack has some real slappers also, music that speaks to the viewer, like the track by Coolio. After looking at everything so closely again, it is easy to see how much fun the cast and crew had making this movie.\n\n“I just want domination of one major American city! Is that too much to ask for? Is it?” –Shuko\n\nIt’s a shame we never got to see the planned sequel. For a true fan like me, this was a childhood classic and a piece of art to be analyzed, like a better Surf Ninjas. Double Dragon 2 could have started with Marian being punched and carried off to appease the crybaby fans, then become something much better. It still confuses me how a sequel never happened. I can only guess that they knew it would be too hard to match the brilliance of the original. We are talking about a movie that was so good that they made a video game based off of it for the PSX, bringing everything back full circle. I haven’t played that one yet, but Nefarious Wes is supposed to let me borrow a copy. He recommended it. I’m just glad this came out before that horrible Mortal Kombat film did. It’s hard to believe that it ruined the video game-based movies for so long, but at least we will always have Double Dragon."
