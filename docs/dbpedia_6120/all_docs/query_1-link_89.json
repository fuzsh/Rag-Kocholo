        "text": "Double Dragon. Man, the series brings back a lot of fond memories for me. It originated in the arcades in 1987 and received a Nintendo port in June 1988. The NES game was where many of us were first exposed to the exploits of the Shadow Warriors and the Lee Brothers. It’s hard to believe the NES version is almost 30 years old. Let’s kick off Double Dragon week here on RVGFanatic with the classic (well, mostly, anyhow) NES trilogy.\n\nWho could forget this intro?\n\nTHE FIENDS!\n\nRemember the little music here?\n\nMake them pay for their sins.\n\nRemember climbing the ladders?\n\nOr stealing Linda’s whip?\n\nLove the city in the backdrop.\n\nAbobo is an all-time iconic NES villain.\n\nThey weren’t levels.\n\nThey weren’t stages.\n\nThey were missions!\n\nEver been hit by a cardboard box?\n\nThey’re more vicious than they look!\n\nYou really felt like you were on a mission.\n\nScaling this tower was some epic shit.\n\nSeriously made you feel like Bruce Lee.\n\nSpeaking of Bruce Lee…\n\nDon’t think these are friendly woods.\n\nTake his knife and throw it back at him!\n\nThis was so atmospheric\n\nBatting practice, anyone?\n\nAbobo twins busting out was so epic.\n\nThis part always did me in.\n\nAs did this, if I made it this far.\n\nWatch those sticks of dynamite…\n\nThe Incredible Abobo.\n\nThat moon is straight up Konami!\n\nHow ominous looking…\n\nOH BLOODY HELL!\n\nCome here often?\n\nI’ve got better things to do tonight than die!\n\nAh, the 2-player mode we didn’t want.\n\nA novelty act that didn’t last long.\n\nWell, at least you could use Abobo.\n\nHow about 2 players in the real mode?\n\nDouble Dragon II: The Revenge was everything we wanted in a Double Dragon game and more. Now you could play co-op with a buddy and take out the bad guys together. I have so many fond memories of playing this game with my uncle and brother switching off back in January 1990 when it first came out to North American shores. We played the crap out of this game and it was one of our absolute favorites.\n\nDAMN RIGHT!\n\nI remember thinking this was a bit spooky.\n\nLet’s just say Marian is in trouble…\n\nLook, it’s Williams with a new makeover.\n\nYup, must have been the ’90s.\n\nI used to call these guys “Leaf Men”\n\nNever gets old stealing their weapons.\n\nRemember throwing them off the ledge?\n\nReminded me of WWF’s Demolition!\n\nHere comes the Ax.\n\nHere comes the Smasher.\n\nThe Demolition — walking disaster.\n\nPain and destruction is our middle name!\n\n“GET TO DA CHOPPA!”\n\nSuch an awesome moment.\n\nNot the best position to be in…\n\nThis was even worse.\n\nI called these guys “Ninja Scarecrows”\n\nI loved these little cutscenes.\n\n“Neon-filled night” — beautiful phrase.\n\nI called these guys “Paintbrush Men”\n\nWatch out for the opening chopper door!\n\nHell of a mustache on this guy.\n\nWelcome to Skull Island.\n\n“Is that a monkey?”\n\nLove that sunset.\n\nIt’s the Arnold mid-boss!\n\nShades of Contra, anyone?\n\nImitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\n\nBit tricky this was.\n\n“This is the way to certain death.”\n\nAnother great action movie line.\n\nGotta have a forest stage.\n\nWouldn’t be Double Dragon without one.\n\nThis part claimed so many lives…\n\nWhat lies up ahead?\n\nOnly one way to find out…\n\nSo fun setting these guys on fire.\n\nIt’s Chin from the first Double Dragon!\n\nOh man, that early ’90s fashion though.\n\nWe meet again, Arnold.\n\n“I’LL BE BACK!”\n\nYeah, we’ll see about that.\n\n“There is evil in the air.”\n\nIt’s cheesy but that’s the charm.\n\nDisappearing platforms, yay…\n\n“Paint THIS, bitch!”\n\nConcentrate, young Jedi.\n\nSend my regards to Mr. Fuji!\n\n*devious Mr. Fuji crackle*\n\nJust a cog in the machine…\n\nBack again? You weren’t lying, Arnold.\n\n“Damnit, we just wiped this floor clean!”\n\nYour greatest enemy is yourself…\n\nThis guy kicked my ass hard.\n\nRemember using the Game Genie on him?\n\nYeah, you weren’t alone. Game Genie FTW.\n\nDouble Dragon III: The Sacred Stones came out in the US February 1991. To put it simply, my brother and I felt it was a grand disappointment. It didn’t really feel like a Double Dragon game. Certainly there was a lot of potential there but we felt it was never realized. It was hard as hell, too. I don’t mind a difficult game, but when it feels damn near impossible to get past the second level or so, something is not right. I know some people might enjoy this game and that’s fine if you do. I just never did. Nevertheless, let’s take a quick look.\n\nAh, the infamous Bimmy blunder.\n\nThis was a sign of things to come.\n\nCreepy intro, though.\n\nPoints for that.\n\nI dunno, old lady, you look a bit shady…\n\nAh what the hell. Let’s go.\n\nHe nails the homeless man impersonation.\n\nI never liked the aesthetic.\n\nDouble Dragon II looked way better.\n\nThis is the boss? How disappointing.\n\nAt least they still have a forest stage.\n\nNice to see the Great Wall of China, too.\n\nChin, you’ve really let yourself go…\n\nIt’s a little depressing\n\nWait, you can use Chin?!\n\nThat’s not jumping the shark at all…\n\nBeat Ranzou and he becomes an ally.\n\nProps for branching out, I guess.\n\nBut some things don’t need branching out.\n\nHe’s certainly no Abobo.\n\nBest looking part of the game.\n\nSo let’s end it on a high note\n\nCLOSING THOUGHTS\n\nDouble Dragon is a classic franchise that I feel has been overlooked and somewhat forgotten over the years. For me growing up with the NES in the late ’80s and early ’90s, the brand of Double Dragon in my mind was right up there with the likes of Mario, Punch-Out!!, Mega Man, Metroid, Castlevania and Contra. It saddens me that it kind of faded away from the spotlight but hey, we’ll always have the memories. On a side note, we did receive Double Dragon IV for PS4 and Steam on January 30, 2017. So the Lee Brothers aren’t officially dead yet.\n\nThe NES trilogy was a mixed bag. The first one was great for its time. The visuals and sound were both excellent. I also kind of liked that you learn more moves as you gain experience. It makes sense being the first game that the Lee Brothers would slowly learn more moves as they go along. The only thing missing a 2-player co-op mode in the regular game mode. The second one is the best. Now you get 2-player co-op and the Lee Brothers know every trick in the book from the very beginning, so there’s no limitations or holding back from jump street. It’s an action-packed game that’s great fun with two. My only complaint? A little bit too much platforming for my liking. I don’t mind a bit of platforming in my beat ‘em ups as long as the control is on point. I can’t say that about Double Dragon II — I’ve lost many a life trying to complete all the damn jumps in that game. As for the third game in the series, I never liked it. It felt outdated and didn’t even feel like Double Dragon, names aside. Guess you can’t win ‘em all. See ya next time for the Lee Brothers’ SNES debut!"
