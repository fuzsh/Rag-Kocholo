        "text": "DOUBLE DRAGON opens in ancient China when the legendary medallion for which the movie is named, is split in half, dividing its mystical properties into power over body and power over soul. Cut to the city of New Angels, under siege in the year 2007, seven years after the Big Quake, where a battle rages between the good guys (martial arts wizards Billy and Jimmy Lee) and the bad guys (the satanic Shuki and his whip-wielding side-kick, Binda Bash) over who could put the Double Dragon together again. No question that it is just a matter of time before the half of the medallion that had fallen into evil hands would be restored to its rightful owners.\n\nThere are anti-Christian references in this film as well as idol worship and faith in magic words, mystical powers and destiny. Lying, lawlessness and bribery are also prevalent. On the other hand, some positive attitudes are present: realizing oneâ€™s limits; working together; seeing women as capable leaders; empathizing with the homeless; and, respecting police authority. The villain Shuki should be applauded for a good portrayal of his character. However, due to an emphasis on revenge, violence, borderline anarchy, and dark spiritual influences such as idol worship and faith in magic and mystical powers, this movie is not suitable for its target audience."
