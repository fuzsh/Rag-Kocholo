        "text": "Here's a rare bird, the DD bootleg with the 3 M6809 processors that virtually eliminates the slowdown in the game. This version is a tad different than the legit version or even the other copy cat bootlegs out there. Here's a list of some of the differences:\n\nIt's a single board as opposed to the standard double stack of the original.\n\nThe music is slightly different. While the tunes are the same, they just sound a bit different from the original.\n\nThe enemies occasionally move erratically. Hard to explain, but they sometimes get stuck in position or shake, like the cpu doesn't know where to move them to. It doesn't effect game play, it's just kind of comical to see how they move sometimes.\n\nThe green Abobo is replaced by the regular black one at the end of level 3.\n\nThe controls are a bit goofy. P1 punch is on the P2 side and vice versa. (However, this can be easily rectified by wiring up a simple jamma connector/finger board adaptor with the pins for the 2 punches wired up and reversed.\n\nIt has a slightly different aspect ratio from the original. The original typically has a black bar on the right side of the screen like this unless you adjust it out:\n\nWhereas, this bootleg is full screen without adjustment:\n\nIt's kind of a cool oddity to have if you're a DD fan and one that doesn't come along very often. Board is clean, fully working and shows no signs of repairs. Once in a blue moon it gets stuck at the garbage screen (you see that screen every time at boot up before the rom check appears). Doesn't happen often but simply turning it off and back on solves it. $175 + ship"
