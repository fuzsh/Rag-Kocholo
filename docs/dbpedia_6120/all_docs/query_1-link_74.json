        "text": "If science has taught us anything, it‚Äôs that everything is better when it‚Äôs wrapped in bacon. I won‚Äôt support this assertion with examples, because we all know it‚Äôs true.\n\nThe folks over at New Holland Artisan Spirits have been fooling around with whiskey for a while now, and the results have been very good. But now they‚Äôve done even better, because they‚Äôve wrapped their latest effort in the beer equivalent of bacon ‚Äì New Holland Dragons Milk.\n\nDragons Milk is one of my favorite beers; a hugely rich and boozy dark ale that goes from my tongue right to the pleasure center of my brain. It‚Äôs aged in bourbon barrels, and while the barrel flavor is getting into the beer, the beer flavor is also getting into the barrel. New Holland had the clever idea to take advantage of this, and have used the Dragons Milk barrels to once again age whiskey.\n\nThe result is called‚Ä¶umm‚Ä¶nothing yet. The bottle I received was a prototype and had no label, but I‚Äôm calling the stuff Double Dragon, because it‚Äôs a cool name and I fully intend to enjoy it while also sipping on a goblet full of Dragons Milk. Two hands, two Dragons, Double Dragon. Ka-chow! Because this is a prototype sent to us by our pal Rich Blair over at New Holland Artisan Spirits, I‚Äôm not sure how much I‚Äôm supposed to say about it, so I‚Äôve decided to say whatever I want.\n\nI‚Äôm a big fan of what I call ‚Äúcowboy whiskey‚Äù ‚Äì I like ‚Äôem rich, sweet and young. I guess you could call that ‚ÄúBieber whiskey‚Äù as well üò¶ . Anyway, think of Stranahans Colorado Whiskey, or New Holland Brewers Whiskey and you get the idea. Double Dragon (catchy, right?) takes a sweet, young whiskey and adds a lovely layer of rich maltiness to it, right at the back end of the taste. It starts a little hot, then you get that sweet young whiskey flavor, and then this huge thread of caramelly deliciousness from the Dragons Milk barrels. Magical. Then you count to three, and a little fireball ignites deep within your gullet. That‚Äôs the Dragon.\n\nThis stuff is amazing, and I would never buy it. Seriously. A 375ml bottle wouldn‚Äôt see the end of a weekend. I‚Äôm not a big booze hound, but this stuff is absolutely craveable. I‚Äôm not sure what the whiskey experts might think, but as a beer geek who likes an occasional nip, this stuff hits the spot like nothing else I‚Äôve ever had before.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n."
