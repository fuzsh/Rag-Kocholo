        "text": "Double Dragon was one of the biggest game names of the 80s. I remember when I was a little kid it was as big a name as Mario.\n\nThe arcade game was a big hit. Clearly based on Hokuto no Ken (itself heavily influenced by Mad Max 2), the post-apocalyptic punks based beat am up with the catchy name is one of the most iconic gaming brands of the era.\n\nThe game itself was somewhat janky, but it had some okay ports to consoles in varying quality, the Famicom/NES version being the most famous.\n\nDouble Dragon II was another arcade hit, but this time it got a superb Famicom port which IMO remains the pinnacle of NES/Fami beat em ups.\n\nBut then…\n\nDouble Dragon III arcade was outsourced. WTF? And it sucked.\n\nDouble Dragon III Famicom was done by Technos, and was much better, but not as good as II.\n\nDouble Dragon II on Game Boy was a reskinned Kunio game with the Double Dragon III art, another WTF.\n\nDouble Dragon IV (Return of Double Dragon) on Super Famicom was shaping up to be a quality game… but was rushed at the end and was released half finished. Still a nice evolution of the beat em up with great 80s/90s kung fu moves, but it’s 30fps and bare bones in many ways.\n\nDouble Dragon V is a crappy outsourced 1v1 fighter, a late entrant into the Street Fighter II clone market. It tied into am American cartoon that had just started.\n\nTechnos themselves also made a Double Dragon 1v1 fighter, on Neo Geo of all places, based on the recent terrible movie.\n\n1996: Technos Japan declared bankruptcy.\n\nAnd that’s really it for Double Dragon. A few later licensed ports/sequels of varying quality (Advance, Neon and the recent stupidly named IV, despite there already being a fourth main game).\n\nFrom one of gaming’s top brands with a cartoon and movie, to dead, in less than ten years.\n\nSure lots of other properties have languished in more recent years, like most of Konami’s portfolio. But none were as big a name as DD, or fell apart as dramatically in what should have been their prime.\n\nYea, the brand feels very diluted. The ports and genre mixups give it a very inconsistent feel.\n\nI’d argue the best thing to happen from it was Battle Toads and Double Dragon - which I think I enjoy most on Genesis (I’m not as familiar with it on SNES or NES). But the gameplay is really more Battletoads than DD (which is probably a good thing).\n\nAre DD and River City Ransom considered to be in the same series? It’s all very confusing.\n\nYou forgot to mention the worst Double Dragon game ever!\n\nI played this piece of dog shit and after beating it I deleted that filth from my hard drive and would never want to play it again. It really is the worst game in the entire series for me, it’s nearly unplayable with a choppy framerate that seems under 30fps most of the time, a stamina meter that when it runs out you can’t even attack at all(one of the worst things about the game IMO), cheap enemies and bosses, unnecessary quicktime events, hilariously bad music, plays very sluggishly and there’s no fun to be had with this game!\n\nPlay any other Double Dragon over this, yes, even Double Dragon V, even Double Dragon 3 arcade version as well, pretty much anything over this!\n\nI played through Double Dragon on the Genesis the other day. It has a really cool design but there were a lot of issues with the control (I assume that’s just an issue with the port though).\n\nI remember loving Double Dragon back in the day and it would have made a lot of sense for them to ride the Final Fight and Streets of Rage train to something much more memorable and awesome.\n\nTechnos clearly had issues. I didn’t even know about the sequels until I was in college. It’s like they had no idea how to take advantage of being heavily featured in The Wizard.\n\nI don’t see how FF is more shallow than DD. They have similar amount of moves, but FF’s moveset is far more functional than DD’s and it has three characters with (somewhat) different moves and attributes while DD, doesn’t.\n\nIts enemies are also much more varied in AI and attribute than Double Dragon (Hollywood/El Gato alone has way more going-on than anyone in the first two DD). The only thing DD really has over FF mechanically is platforming elements of dubious merits and that enemies can pick up and deny weapons to the player. While 1cc playthroughs of the arcade Final Fight will make use of all the characters moves at one point even if they abuse Cody’s infinite punching exploit, arcade DD1 can be pretty much steamrolled by spamming the back elbow and nothing else.\n\nI don’t think it’s a coincidence (or an error of the market) that as soon as FF came out, we stopped seeing beat em ups with small sprites and janky “stun enemies to grapple” systems, and that nobody adopted DDII’s dumbass direction-based attack scheme.\n\nI don’t think it’s a coincidence, but I don’t think Final Fight had anything to do with it either. Double Dragon killed itself, little to do with Final Fight. No timely SNES game release, when it was released it was half finished, too much outsourcing and crappy licenced stuff, legal battles with US publishers, Technos focusing on the (more successful in Japan but harder to westernise) Kunio games, Street Fighter II relegating genre to the sidelines, and then Technos going out of business were the reasons.\n\nDouble Dragon at its peak was a much, much bigger brand than Final Fight ever was. Nobody made Hollywood movies and TV shows of FF.\n\nDouble Dragon is one of my greatest memory in arcade as a kid. It’s still one of the best beat them up for me, once you choose to not abuse of elbow strikes, kinda boring I guess.\n\nThe Kunio-kun serie is closely related. Technos did first Renegade/Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun in arcade, then DD was an evolution of the concept, then it became two independant series with derivative elements, like the oriented striking in DD2 coming from Renegade etc\n\nI slightly prefer the original Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun in arcade, I find the gameplay so perfect and fun.\n\nThe only one who can surpass it, fo me, is Final Fight. The original arcade version of course.\n\nI personaly think those arcade beat them up’s have to be played as closely as they were designed, on the original cabinet for the lucky ones, otherwise with a good emulation (like maybe MAMEshmup on a 5ms screen or CRT if it’s possible ?) with an arcade stick. The Switch on tabletop mode with an arcade stick is a decent alternative when emulation is good.\n\nI know beat them up is a genre where the characteristics of a good game are rarely discussed, and however various depending the person. For me it’s not about the size of the move list (often the opposite) but more how the gameplay constantly occupies my mind.\n\nThe Combatribes is another great beat them up from Technos, I can easily imagine the fun with three players in the arcade. A cool evolution of the original Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun gameplay with some DD vibes."
