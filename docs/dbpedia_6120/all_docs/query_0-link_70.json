        "text": "SnakePit username: Makakilo\n\nPlace of birth: Idaho\n\nFavorite food: Crumbl cookies!\n\nFavorite film/TV show: Galaxy Quest\n\nOther hobbies:\n\nBaseball is my number 1 interest. My other interests changed. My interests in yoga, bicycling, composting, and Zumba have diminished. My current interests are pickleball (I won two tournaments!), walking/running events (each event gives a shirt to finishers), and gardening (guava and dragon fruit are my favorites, and I’m looking forward to my first figs). My interesting gym classes include Barre and Swinging Clubs.\n\nWhat else should we know about you?\n\nIn 2013, I grabbed the opportunity of a lifetime to move from Arizona to Hawaii. Although I enthusiastically loved my work, after 32 years working at the same place, opportunity knocked and it was time to move on. That’s when my best life started. And I discovered the AZ Snake Pit!\n\nI am a lucky dog to be part of the AZ Snake Pit. I’ve experienced the joyous hearts and support of many of my fellow writers. Writing articles makes me happy; with a dash of excitement when I go beyond my comfort zone and/or risk making a mistake. My mindset is to attempt to turn each mistake into a positive outcome.\n\nA milestone happened. In October 2020, I challenged myself to post a feature article every week (no matter what happens in my life, and in addition to my other articles). Could I do it every week? As I approach four years, without exception I wrote a feature article every week.\n\nThree ways I improved my writing were: consistent practice (nearly daily), participated in roundtable discussions (their importance cannot be overstated), and fearlessly tackled challenging topics.\n\nIn case you wondered, I’m a life member of Mensa\n\nWhy are you a Diamondbacks fan?\n\nSeveral times over my lifetime, I was drawn closer to baseball and the Diamondbacks. Three highlights follow:\n\nI played in little league baseball, which I loved! I played in rightfield. One day, the coach asked me to tell him about fielding the ball. I told him that I could not tell whether the baseball was coming towards me until it got close to me. The coach discovered that I was very near-sighted. Perhaps because I sat in the front row in school, no one had noticed my problem. I got my first pair of glasses! They opened up a new world.\n\nAs an adult, the Diamondbacks’ spring training games in Tucson were awesome. I always brought my glove in hopes of catching a fly ball. Instead, something strange happened. A fly ball landed in the stands far to my right side. Like a magnet, it rolled to where I sat. I reached down and grabbed it. I looked up and noticed a couple people running towards me (and the ball). They stopped and looked disappointed. Nevertheless, I was very happy. That baseball is on my bookcase.\n\nIn 2023, I flew to Phoenix to see the last series of the season. I was there when the Diamondbacks clinched the playoffs because another team lost their game. Weeks later, when I suddenly told my pickleball friends that I was again flying to Phoenix to see the Diamondbacks in the World Series, they knew I was a die-hard fan.\n\nWho’s your all-time favorite Diamondback?\n\nMy first thought was Christian Walker because he was a late bloomer like me (and neither of us was chosen as an All-Star although he was worthy and he has two gold gloves!) I wrote a few articles about him.\n\nBut he was not my final choice. With enthusiasm, it’s Torey Lovullo! He’s all about the mental game of baseball. He connects with players, strongly motivates players, creates a winning culture, and sees success opportunities in all his players. I appreciate and admire those traits.\n\nOutside of post-seasons, what’s your best D-backs memory?\n\nOne excellent memory was when the game broadcast gave a shoutout to the AZ Snake Pit!\n\nHow did you end up on the SnakePit?\n\nAfter I wrote a few Fan Posts, Jim McLennan invited me to write series previews, for which I will always be grateful. Jim, thank you!\n\nWhat other MLB teams do you care about - good or bad!\n\nNone.\n\nWhy do you love baseball?\n\nFour things I love:"
