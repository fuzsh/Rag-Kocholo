Billy is raised by an elderly martial arts master known as the Oldest Dragon, and his brother Jimmy is raised by the evil Shadow Master as his second-in-command, the Shadow Boss. As a result, the Lee brothers oppose each other as adults. When Jimmy is betrayed by the Shadow Master, he renounces his evil ways and joins his brother as a Dragon Warrior. During the course of the series, the brothers recruit allies in their war against the Shadow Master and his henchmen. The futile search for their father, John Lee, is a subplot throughout the series.\n\nThe plot of the pilot episode is loosely adapted from the NES version of the first Double Dragon game. The villains are the mysterious Shadow Boss (Jimmy's initial alter-ego), and his henchmen Abobo and Willy (who were based on enemy characters from the game). By the end of the second episode, Abobo and Willy are sucked into the Shadow Mural, never to be seen again, while Jimmy abandons his evil ways and reconciles with his brother to fight against the series' true antagonist, the Shadow Master. All of the characters introduced from the second episode onward are original creations made for the show, although most of the villains are also used in the Tradewest-produced Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls, a 1-on-1 fighting game released for home consoles.\n\nThe Lee brothers are martial-arts instructors and police consultants, who assume superheroic identities at moments of escalated violence. They usually transform out of those forms by crossing swords again and saying in unison, \"For Might! For Right! We are Double Dragons!\", although several episodes show that heavy injury can deactivate their powers. Injury sustained by one is sometimes taken by the other. The brothers sometimes sense when the other is in danger.\n\nIn this series, the Double Dragons are adept in a mystical form of the Kenjutsu arts, even though in the games they have more of a mastery in both the Bōjutsu arts with any bō or club, and the Kusari-fundo arts involving any whip or nunchaku they can find.\n\nBilly Lee is the former devoted Dragon Pupil turned graduated Dragon Master with messy black hair. He regularly dons armored hero's clothes that are blue, with a torn shirt and dragon-mask that are both red. Billy's personality is based on the wise, independent, and self-determined side of Bruce Lee.\n\nJimmy Lee is the former evil high-ranking Shadow Warrior turned sarcastic Double Master with spiky blonde hair. He also dons armored hero's clothes, but his are red, with a torn shirt and a dragon-mask that are both blue. Jimmy's personality is based on the cocky, charismatic, and belligerent side of Bruce Lee.\n\nDragon Warriors are other martial artists recruited by the Lee brothers in their fight against the Shadow Warriors, bestowing them with superhuman powers through the use of a smokeless, green \"dragon fire\".\n\nJunior Dragons are Billy and Jimmy's younger students, and supporting characters throughout the series.\n\nThe Shadow Warriors are the main antagonists, a criminal organization composed mostly of mutants. These mutants are created by \"high levels of EMF generated by (Metro City's) ancient underground power grid\". They are led by the Shadow Master, with many powers including shapeshifting and teleporting, and he is able to trap warriors who fail him in the Shadow Mural. He is the half-brother of Billy and Jimmy's mother.\n\n# Title Written by Original air date Production code 1\"The Shadow Falls\"Phil Harnage and Sandra RyanSeptember 12, 1993 ( )101 2\"The Legend Continues\"Phil Harnage and Martha MoranSeptember 19, 1993 ( )102 3\"The Mistress of Chi\"Richard MuellerSeptember 26, 1993 ( )106 4\"The Price of Oblivion\"Bob ForwardOctober 3, 1993 ( )103 5\"River of Tears\"Pat Allee and Ben HurstOctober 10, 1993 ( )104 6\"Over the Line\"Sandra RyanOctober 17, 1993 ( )107 7\"Rebirth\"David Carren and Larry CarrollOctober 24, 1993 ( )108 8\"Judgment Day\"Mike O'MahoneyOctober 31, 1993 ( )105 9\"Dragon Hunt\"Kurt WeldonNovember 7, 1993 ( )111 10\"Call to Arms\"Phil HarnageNovember 14, 1993 ( )109 11\"Heart of the Matter\"Martha MoranNovember 21, 1993 ( )110 12\"The Abyss\"Michael O'MahoneyNovember 28, 1993 ( )113 13\"The Eye of the Dragon\"Pat Allee and Ben HurstDecember 5, 1993 ( )112\n\n# Title Written by Original air date Production code 14\"Shadow Khan\"Martha MoranSeptember 11, 1994 ( )201 15\"Shadow Claw\"Phil HarnageSeptember 18, 1994 ( )202 16\"Virtual Reality Bytes\"Rich MuellerSeptember 25, 1994 ( )204 17\"Doom Claw\"Martha MoranOctober 2, 1994 ( )203 18\"Superhighway Warriors\"Rich MuellerOctober 9, 1994 ( )206 19\"Undertown\"Doug BoothOctober 16, 1994 ( )205 20\"Spirit in the Sword\"Doug BoothOctober 23, 1994 ( )208 21\"Shadow Conned\"Martha MoranOctober 30, 1994 ( )209 22\"The Sight of Freedom\"Phil HarnageNovember 6, 1994 ( )211 23\"Ancients Arrive\"Sandra RyanNovember 13, 1994 ( )210 24\"The Return of the Shadowmonster\"Doug BoothNovember 20, 1994 ( )212 25\"Daj of the Undertown Dragons\"Martha MoranNovember 27, 1994 ( )213 26\"RPM\"Phil HarnageDecember 4, 1994 ( )207\n\nIn 1994, the tie-in video game Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls, has been developed by Leland Interactive Media and published by Tradewest.
