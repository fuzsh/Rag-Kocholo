        "text": "A groundbreaking, uber-popular game upon its arcade debut in 1987, Double Dragon is the undisputed godfather of co-op beat âem all!\n\nEnter Double Dragon Trilogy, a compilation specially optimized for mobiles and which includes all three installments of the beloved arcade series: Double Dragon, Double Dragon 2: The Revenge, and Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone. The first one begins with Billy and his brother Jimmy, two martial arts experts, in a mission to rescue Billy's girlfriend, Marian, whoâs been kidnapped by the Black Shadows Gang. All your favorite moves are here: punches, kicks, elbows, knees, head-butts and an assortment of not-exactly-street-legal weapons.\n\nBattle your way through all 3 titles and bask in the greatness of one of the â80s most popular arcade games!\n\nFEATURES:\n\nâ¢Two game modes: âArcadeâ (play the game from beginning to end and go for the high score) and âStoryâ (unlock new stages and achievements while playing through the game)\n\nâ¢Customizable controls\n\nâ¢Three difficulty levels: âmobileâ (specially balanced for mobile games), âoriginalâ (similar to the arcade version) and âexpertâ (a real challenge!)\n\nâ¢Achievements & leaderboards (Game Center)\n\nâ¢Choose between the original 8-bit soundtrack and a brand-new remastered one!\n\nâ¢Co-op mode (two players) via bluetooth\n\nâ¢Gamepad support - very soon with most iOS controllers\n\nMORE ABOUT DOTEMU\n\nfacebook.com/dotemu\n\ntwitter.com/dotemu\n\nyoutube.com/dotemu\n\nComedian138 ,\n\nMuch better...just needs a few more tweaks until perfection...\n\nThe developers added continues (thank you!) and made some other tweaks, which are a BIG improvement over the previous version. However, having a (or at least have the option to have) \"add credits\" button would be ideal for the games, Especially for Double Dragon 3 where having additional credits is mandatory to purchase items at the shops. And where's the level map for Double Dragon 3? Other than that, everything else is Double Dragon nostalgia awesomeness, a top notch port of all the games I played in the arcades as a kid.\n\nFor those who were wanting the NES versions: These are the ARCADE versions of the games, which came out BEFORE the NES versions.\n\nKeep up the good work development team!! Here's my five stars for Double Dragon trilogy!!!\n\nmy_review ,\n\nAwesome beatâem up classic\n\nDefinitely one of the best arcade classic on todayâs new devices. Unlike like others which bombard you with ads and convoluted menu which is completely unnecessary. This is exactly what it is and was from the 80s. The remix to the original music is a greatly appreciated touch and done right, with the option to switch to the original. Thank you for making the controls adjustable. And thank you for thinking it through with the video option as well as the gameâs difficulty. If youâre into old school video games or Arcade1up classics then this game absolutely deserves to be in your collection. Get the original beatâem up godfather of them all. Yes - this came out before Final Fight."
