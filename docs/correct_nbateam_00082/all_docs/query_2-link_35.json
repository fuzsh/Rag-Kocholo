        "text": "[jwplayer 2gIx3UqA-z6KDnl0B]\n\nOn Friday, EuroHoops.net reported that 14-year NBA veteran Raymond Felton has opted to take his talents to the Czech Republic.\n\nThe 35-year-old point who spent 2017-19 seasons with the Thunder will join second division club GBA Jindřichův Hradec, although not immediately.\n\nAccording to the report, the general manager of the club mentioned that Felton is not expected to report until sometime after April 1, mainly due to his dealing with some personal issues that presumably accompany a move to another country.\n\nOver the course of his 14 years in the NBA, Felton has posted career averages of 11.2 points, three rebounds and 5.2 assists per game for seven teams, including the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nThe below is the quote from Hradec general manager Radek Novak, which is provided courtesy of EuroHoops.net.\n\n“He should arrive after April 1st, but I can’t tell the exact date now because Raymond is dealing with some personal matters at home. We hope that he will come to help us in the playoffs of the first league, at worst he would come for the NBL relegation round. There are several different options,”\n\nWith respect to their point guard position, the Thunder effectively replaced Russell Westbrook and Felton with Chris Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nThe team will enter play on March 6 with a 38-24 record. The club will square off against the New York Knicks as they look for their 39th victory on the season."
