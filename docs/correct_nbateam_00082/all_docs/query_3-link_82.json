        "text": "As Raymond Felton extended through his shot, Russell Westbrook bounced his own basketball against the practice court hardwood. The two threatened to converge, but at its peak, Westbrook’s ball flew harmlessly past Felton’s.\n\nIt was a February afternoon, and Felton and Westbrook were among the last players engaged in the usual post-practice 3-point shooting contest.\n\nAs Felton’s shot fell through the hoop, Westbrook swore, and Felton sprinted across the court. His practice jersey, which he wore around his neck, flapped behind him like a cape.\n\n“Let’s go, Russ,” he shouted.\n\nFree agency begins Sunday evening, at which time the Thunder and its veteran superhero can officially set out the terms of a possible agreement. Felton has said publicly that he’d like to stay in Oklahoma City. For the Thunder, losing Felton would mean leaving open a role it’s filled for the past six seasons: the veteran whose leadership outweighs his playing time.\n\nSigning Felton won’t determine the Thunder’s success next season. But from a practical standpoint, it makes financial sense.\n\nLast year around this time, Felton signed a one-year minimum contract for $2.4 million. Per the Collective Bargaining Agreement, a team essentially pays the two-year veteran minimum salary for any player with more experience on a one-year minimum contract — in the case of three-plus year veterans, the NBA reimburses the team for any amount above the minimum salary of a two-year veteran.\n\nFelton, a 14-year veteran, played just 33 games last season but gained coach Billy Donovan’s trust by playoff time. Felton averaged more than 11 minutes per game in the Thunder’s first-round series against Portland. He spent almost as much time on the floor as Markieff Morris, who the Thunder signed during the All-Star break, and more than Abdel Nader, who saw an increased role in the second half of the regular season when the Thunder’s wing depth thinned.\n\nThe Thunder signed Nick Collison to a similar contract in 2017, a one-year deal for the veteran’s minimum. He played just 20 games in the 2016-17 season and 15 games in his final year in the NBA.\n\nFelton served as the Thunder’s backup point guard in the lone season he overlapped with Collison. When Collison retired and the Thunder acquired Dennis Schroder, Felton took on a Collison-like role.\n\n“Just being that guy,” Felton said in April, “being that voice that Nick was in the locker room, just that leader, that voice, and person that guys could go to, I feel like I needed to feel that void, yeah, sure.”\n\nBefore age began to pull Collison out of the Thunder rotation — he went from playing 81 games in 2012-13 and 2013-14 to 66 the following year and 59 the year after that — Derek Fisher provided OKC’s steady veteran presence.\n\nFisher had already joined the Thunder for parts of 2012 and 2013, both times as a midseason acquisition, before playing his 18th and final season in OKC. He still averaged 17.6 minutes off the bench in 81 games that year. The Knicks hired him as their head coach soon after he retired.\n\nVeterans like Kevin Ollie, Joe Smith, Chucky Atkins and Malik Rose graced the Thunder bench for a season or less at a time. But Fisher, who made just $1.4 million in 2013-14, was the first to make a longer-term impact.\n\nPlayers in the Fisher/Collison/Felton mold are generally inexpensive past their primes, with the wealth of experience that they can pass on coming at a bargain. In the past six years, OKC has shown it values such contracts, and Thunder stars like Westbrook seem to appreciate such teammates.\n\nThe fit is mutual.\n\n“I'm a guy at a point in my career,” Felton said in his exit interview two months ago, “I want to be just settled and just enjoy playing the game that I love and enjoy being in the city that loves me back and loves their team, and there's no better place than here really.”"
