        "text": "Raymond Felton was reportedly told during his exit interview with Knicks president Phil Jackson that he will be traded this summer, according to SNY.tv. It’s not a shocking move, but it’ll be interesting to see who the Zen Master brings in to run the show in New York next season.\n\nKnicks President Phil Jackson told point guard Raymond Felton during exit meetings last month that he will be traded during the offseason, a league source told SNY.tv.\n\n“Raymond has been told he will be moved this offseason,” the source said.\n\nOf course, Jackson’s first priority is to hire a coach after Steve Kerr stunned the Knicks — and the basketball world — on Wednesday by taking the Golden State Warriors job.\n\nFelton, who turns 30 next month, is due to make $4.36 million in 2014-15 and he has a player option for $4.54 million in 2015-16.\n\nThe Felton news should not be that surprising considering his on-court performance and off-court antics this past season."
