        "text": "Raymond Felton has been around the NBA for 14 years and has played for several different teams but none of them may compare to the state of the Thunder at the moment.\n\nFelton is in his second season with the Thunder and has played sparingly with the arrival of Dennis Schroder but he has taken on a leadership role with the team and has become the voice inside the locker room.\n\nWith Schroder missing Monday night’s game against the Portland Trail Blazers due to personal reasons, Felton was called upon and the veteran delivered with a season-high 15 points during the 120-111 win.\n\nAfterward, Felton commented on the chemistry of the team.\n\n“The chemistry is probably one of the best I’ve ever seen,” Felton said, via Sam Gannon of Fox 25 in Oklahoma City. “Everybody likes each other. It’s like a brotherhood. It’s like we are a family. We have each other’s back on and off of the court and that’s hard to find.\n\n“When you got your two superstars on your team that’s connected the way that they are — [they] are like brothers. With those two at that level where they are connected with each other like that, it’s easy for everybody else to follow suit and that’s really big. Their relationship kind of just trickles down to everybody else.”\n\nWhile some teams around the league this season have struggled with chemistry and other related issues, the Thunder appear to be in a good place comparatively speaking.\n\nAs Felton praised his teammates and the culture around the team, backup center Nerlens Noel also echoed his statement on Monday prior to the game as he says he is having fun again.\n\n“Guys are so enthusiastic and we have leadership in the locker room,” Noel said. “Guys want to come in and play basketball every day and look forward to winning games. It’s all I have ever dreamed of playing in the NBA. It’s ideal right now. There is a goal; something that you’re playing toward. It makes the most sense to me. It gives me a purpose every time step I step out on that court, every time I step in the locker room. Guys are just so involved with each other. It’s a complete team.”\n\nWith Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Felton leading the way, the rest of the players have taken notice and have bought into what they are trying to accomplish, as Felton noted.\n\nFor the players to have bought in it speaks volumes to how the organization has been run in recent years and that shouldn’t be overlooked as to why the Thunder have been so successful."
