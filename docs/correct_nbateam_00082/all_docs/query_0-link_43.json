        "text": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) -- The Knicks could be boosted by the return of point guard Raymond Felton on Monday, according to the Daily News.\n\nFelton has missed the past six games due to a strained hamstring. The Knicks have gone 3-3 during their recent span without Felton and will face the Orlando Magic at Amway Center on Monday night.\n\nBeno Udrih has started at point guard for the Knicks against the Milwaukee Bucks and Memphis Grizzlies while Felton and fellow injured point guard Pablo Prigioni were unavailable. Prigioni suffered a broken toe on December 16.\n\nFelton is averaging 10.3 points per game and 5.2 assist per game.\n\nHe admitted to the Daily News that he's feeling a lot better.\n\n\"I feel better, for sure. Definitely feel better,\" Felton told the Daily News. \"Can't say I'm totally 100 percent after doing some tests these last two days, but I can say I'm better than the last time I came back from the last injury. It's just something to think about because I don't want to keep aggravating this hamstring and if you keep aggravating something possibly it could tear and I definitely don't want that.\"\n\nFelton is focused on making sure he's fully healthy when he returns.\n\n\"So I'm just trying to be cautious for sure this time and make sure I'm 100 percent.\"\n\nThe Knicks have begun the season 8-18."
