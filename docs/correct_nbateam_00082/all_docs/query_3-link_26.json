        "text": "Thunder point guard Raymond Felton is a 13-year veteran of the NBA and has seen a lot in his time in the league.\n\nFelton has played nearly 1,000 games in his career and has played with the Hornets, Knicks (twice), Nuggets, Trail Blazers, Mavericks, Clippers and now the Thunder.\n\nHe will likely be looked to for veteran leadership this season after Nick Collison retired this past offseason after 14 seasons in Seattle and Oklahoma City.\n\nAs the oldest member of the team at 34 (and the only player over 30 on the roster), Felton will be a huge presence on the bench, in the locker room and as a second or third unit point guard this season.\n\nFelton has had high praise for the team during training camp and the preseason thus far and continued to offer more positive comments on Tuesday.\n\nFor any team in the league, this is the kind of positive momentum you want as a player and this the type of affirmation from a veteran of a young squad that is a good sign moving forward.\n\nThe Thunder close out the preseason Tuesday night against the Bucks in Oklahoma City."
