        "text": "By Eurohoops team / info@eurohoops.net\n\nNBA veteran guard Raymond Felton was registered as a player of Czech Republic Second Division club GBA Jindřichův Hradec, per an announcement by the official website of the Czech Basketball League.\n\nWhile Felton, 35, is considered a player of the team, he won’t be there until April. “He should arrive after April 1st, but I can’t tell the exact date now because Raymond is dealing with some personal matters at home. We hope that he will come to help us in the playoffs of the first league, at worst he would come for the NBL relegation round. There are several different options,” Hradec general manager Radek Novak said per the Czech Basketball League."
