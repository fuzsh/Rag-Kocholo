        "text": "Raymond Felton says he's been dealing with \"personal\" stuff that he didn't want to discuss and that being involved in trade rumors is part of the business.\n\nThe Knicks haven't been happy with Felton's play this season and they continue to try to upgrade the point guard position by Thursday's trade deadline. But Felton said he isn't worried if he's moved. \"Whoever I play for it's who I play for,\" Felton said Tuesday. \"If it's here great, I'm going to love it. I love these guys. But if it happens then it happens. I'm a guy who's been in the league a long time. That's part of the business. I understand that.\"\n\nFelton, who has missed 16 games, went into Tuesday night against the Grizzlies averaging 10.4 points and 5.9 assists, and has had major issues defending point guards. He hasn't been happy with his play either.\n\n\"It's not what I envisioned in the summertime when I was working as hard as I was,\" Felton said.\n\n\"You can't help that you have injuries. You can't help that you're limited with certain things when you do get injured. I feel like I've been fighting, giving it what I had this whole time. Sometimes it's not good enough.\"\n\nWoodson unmasked\n\nJ.R. Smith played with a protective mask covering his fractured cheekbone. Mike Woodson said he had the same injury late in his career after taking an elbow from Rockets teammate Hakeem Olajuwon. Woodson said it \"knocked me out completely.\" But Woodson said he returned the next game and didn't wear a mask.\n\n\"I told [Smith] I might have been a little tougher than he is,\" Woodson said.\n\nMagnanimous Melo\n\nCarmelo Anthony said he was happy Kyrie Irving won the All-Star Game MVP. Anthony scored 30, but Irving led the East back from 18 down and finished with 31 points and 14 assists. \"My teammates were telling me they thought I had it,\" Anthony sai \"They wanted me to get it especially with the game I had. But you can't take nothing away from Kyrie.\" . . . Woodson said Kenyon Martin (left ankle) will not join the Knicks on this four-game trip."
