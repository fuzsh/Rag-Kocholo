        "text": "Raymond Felton has agreed to re-sign with the Thunder, and that’s no small matter.\n\nFelton was a godsend for the Thunder last season, as Russell Westbrook’s backup point guard. Every team ought to be able to find a quality backup point guard, but that doesn’t mean every team does. The Thunder didn’t, in 2016-17, when Cameron Payne was banged up (and eventually traded) and the Thunder down the stretch had Semaj Christon or Norris Cole backing up Westbrook.\n\nFelton signed on last summer and was an excellent addition to the squad. Veteran leadership. Wise counsel. Plus a solid player who could play a little defense and quite a bit of offense. Felton shot 35.2 percent from 3-point range and took the fourth-most 3’s on the team. No one saw that coming. Felton might have been the most consistent player at Billy Donovan’s disposal. You always knew what you were getting with Felton.\n\nThe Thunder plans to sign Felton to a one-year, $2.9-million contract, which is the veteran minimum. A minimum contract was mandatory considering how deep into the luxury is the Thunder.\n\nAnd it’s not like the Thunder had a bunch of options. The market was growing thin.\n\nSure, Marcus Smart would have been great with the Thunder. But he’s a restricted free agent, and even if OKC had signed him to the mid-level exception for taxpayers ($5.3 million), Boston would have matched in 15 seconds. Isaiah Thomas was an all-star in Boston, but two straight teams (the Cavaliers and Lakers) basically have given up on him. He’s a little bitter over never cashing in on a big payday and might be headed to Orlando, trying to resurrect his career and earnings potential. Is that the kind of player the Thunder needs, even if he would come?\n\nThe Thunder could have pursued other veterans in the Felton family of point guards. Deron Williams doesn’t have a job. Neither does Ty Lawson. Heck, Tony Parker is a free agent, though it’s hard to imagine him in any color scheme but San Antonio silver and black.\n\nThe Thunder could have gone the other way, gone after a young point guard who hasn’t found his way but has shown promise. The Lakers just cut Tyler Ulis. Shabazz Napier played well for Portland most of last season before fading at the end.\n\nBut considering all options, the best and safest and surest option was retaining Felton. He turned 34 last week. He doesn’t have a lot of years left in the NBA. He will reach the end of the basketball road soon. But there’s no reason that has to be 2018-19."
