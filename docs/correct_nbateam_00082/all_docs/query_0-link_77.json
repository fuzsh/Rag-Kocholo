        "text": "Raymond Felton scored 25 points as the New York Knicks rallied to beat the San Antonio Spurs 104-100 on Thursday to remain undefeated. JR Smith added 17 points, Jason Kidd had 14 and Tyson Chandler 13 for the Knicks (6-0), who closed on a 22-11 run to remain the NBA's lone unbeaten team.\n\nTony Parker led San Antonio (7-2) with 19 points and 12 assists. Kawhi Leonard added 16 points and Tim Duncan had 14 points and 14 rebounds. Smith and Kidd hit consecutive three-pointers to give the Knicks a 100-95 lead with a minute left in the game.\n\nThe short-handed Miami Heat ended a decade-long drought as LeBron James had 27 points and 12 assists in a 98-93 win over the Denver Nuggets. Shane Battier added 18 points, all on three-pointers, in the Heat's first win at Denver since 29 January 2002, a streak of 10 straight losses. Every other NBA team has won at the Pepsi Center during that span. Andre Miller had 19 points and Kenneth Faried led the Nuggets with 16 points and a career-high 20 rebounds. Ty Lawson, who is averaging 13.5 points, didn't score.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets won a fourth straight game after Joe Johnson made the tiebreaking basket with 3:03 left; Deron Williams and Brook Lopez each scored 24 points in a 102-97 victory over the Boston Celtics. Williams had eight assists and made all nine free throws on a night when Paul Pierce had two huge misses in the final minute for the Celtics, who played without injured point guard Rajon Rondo. Johnson finished with 19 points and eight rebounds for the Nets.\n\nPierce scored 22 points and Leandro Barbosa had 17 in place of Rondo, who was out with a sprained right ankle. Kevin Garnett added 14 points but Boston had its three-game win streak snapped and lost to the Nets for only the third time in 21 meetings."
