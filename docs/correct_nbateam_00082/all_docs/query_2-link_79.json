        "text": "New York Knicks fans could hardly believe what they saw when former point guard Raymond Felton took the court at Madison Square Garden over the weekend.\n\nFelton, who played for the Knicks for three seasons as part of a 14-year NBA career, returned to the Garden for the Knicks’ celebrity and alumni game.\n\nBut when he did so, it was with the benefit (depending on who you ask) of a few (many) extra pounds on his frame.\n\nFelt was always a pretty thicc dude. Basketball Reference lists him at 6-foot-1, 205 pounds from his playing days. But he’s certainly a tad bigger than that at this point.\n\nWe don’t have his current weight available, but somebody decided to have a little bit of fun on Wikipedia, because he’s currently listed at 350 pounds.\n\nAnd, honestly, he may be close to that than 205.\n\nFans did not hold back on the former North Carolina Tar Heels star.\n\n“Lmfaoooo that n**** retired and turned into a professional food taster,” one fan tweeted.\n\n“That man stopped caring completely. This the most cardio he got since he retired,” wrote another.\n\nBut others weren’t as convinced.\n\nSome fans believed that Felton looked no different than he did when was playing in the NBA. Which could be a good or bad thing, depending which view you take of it.\n\n“He’s still in playing shape after all these years,” wrote @Young_Justo.\n\n“He played at that weight, i don’t see the issue,” said @Byds_TehWydd\n\nFelton’s NBA career was solid by any definition. He averaged 11.2 points, 5.2 assists and 3.0 rebounds per game over nearly a decade-and-a-half.\n\nBut as we all know, Twitter is going to get its jokes in one way or another. And this time, it appears that Felton was the sacrificial lamb…\n\nThough it also looks like he’s sacrificed more than a few lambs in his day as well…"
