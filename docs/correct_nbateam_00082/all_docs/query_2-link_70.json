        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Raymond Felton and Patrick Patterson have each played in the NBA long enough to appreciate the importance of playing for a team with legitimate title aspirations.\n\nBoth believe they found that in Oklahoma City, a point they made clear Tuesday as they were formally introduced by the Thunder.\n\n\"The best feeling ever is having a parade,\" said Felton, a 12-year veteran from North Carolina. \"I've never experienced that. I experienced (a title) at the college level but never here in the NBA. I definitely want to do that before I retire from this game.\"\n\nOklahoma City is attempting to regain its status as a championship title contender after making a first-round playoff exit in its first season without Kevin Durant, who left for Golden State and helped the Warriors win their second title in three years.\n\nThe Thunder acquired forward Paul George from the Indiana Pacers in a blockbuster deal that provides an All-Star teammate for reigning NBA MVP Russell Westbrook. Felton and Patterson bring a combined 19 seasons of NBA experience.\n\n\"These guys are veteran guys,\" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. \"They've played in a lot of games, and a lot of big games. I think them having a great, clear understanding of what goes into winning (and) the sacrifices ... I think that's very, very important\" (see full story).\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nComplete coverage of the Philadelphia 76ers and their rivals in the NBA from NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\nCavaliers: Team officially signs Jeff Green\n\nCLEVELAND -- The Cleveland Cavaliers have signed veteran forward Jeff Green.\n\nThe Cavs announced the move on Tuesday after agreeing to terms on a deal for the veteran's minimum last week. Green averaged 9.2 points and 3.1 rebounds for the Orlando Magic last season and will give the Cavaliers some depth in the frontcourt.\n\nGreen turn 31 in August. He has averaged 13.5 points and 4.7 rebounds during his career. Green has appeared in 38 postseason games, most recently with the Clippers in 2015-16.\n\nThe No. 5 overall pick by Seattle in 2007 out of Georgetown, Green averaged career lows in points, rebounds and shooting rate (39.4 percent) for the Magic last season.\n\nThe Cavaliers will be his sixth NBA team.\n\nNuggets: 37-year-old Mike Miller waived\n\nDENVER -- The Denver Nuggets have waived 37-year-old shooting guard Mike Miller.\n\nThe team announced the news on its Twitter account Tuesday.\n\nMiller played only 20 games last season as he served more of a coaching role from the bench for a Nuggets team that missed out on the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.\n\nOver his career, Miller also played for Cleveland, Memphis, Miami, Washington, Minnesota and Orlando. He suited up in 1,032 games and averaged 10.6 points.\n\nMiller was the sixth man of the year in 2005-06 while with the Grizzlies. He averaged 13.7 points that season and made 138 3-pointers.\n\nIn addition, Miller was named to the All-Rookie team in 2000-01 after being taken with the fifth overall pick by the Magic."
