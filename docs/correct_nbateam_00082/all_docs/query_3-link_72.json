        "text": "CLEMSON – South Carolina native Jalek Felton, a freshman guard on the University of North Carolina men’s basketball team, won’t be making a return trip to his home state tonight, after all.\n\nNorth Carolina, which plays at Clemson at 7 p.m. in a key Atlantic Coast Conference game, announced Tuesday that Felton has been suspended from school.\n\nIn a news release, the school said Felton is “not currently eligible to participate” in any university activities. No other details were released, including the reason for the suspension or the possible duration of the suspension.\n\nFelton has played in all 22 games this season, averaging 2.9 points and 1.6 assists.\n\nFelton, of Mullins, is the nephew of former North Carolina guard Raymond Felton, who now plays in the NBA with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nMore: Clemson basketball: No. 20 Clemson has quick turnaround for No. 17 North Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina is ranked 17th in the latest USA TODAY Coaches Poll while Clemson is ranked No. 20. The two teams played two weeks ago in Chapel Hill, N.C., with the Tar Heels claiming an 87-79 victory, their 10th consecutive win in the series."
