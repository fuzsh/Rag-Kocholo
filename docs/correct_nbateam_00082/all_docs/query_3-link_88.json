        "text": "Raymond Felton was back at American Airlines Center on Wednesday night.\n\nWhile he's landed in an excellent situation with the Los Angeles Clippers, it's a clear fact that the Mavericks could have used him a lot more than the Clips over the first month of the season.\n\nThe Mavericks had every opportunity to bring back Felton, who put in two seasons in Dallas and played terrific for them last season when injuries landed him a big increase in playing time.\n\n\"I made it clear where I wanted to be,\" Felton said before the Clippers and Mavericks played Wednesday. \"Sometimes, things just don't work out.\"\n\nRick Carlisle said it was a \"franchise decision\" not to bring Felton back. But when injuries to Devin Harris, Deron Williams and J.J. Barea decimated the point guard spot, Felton sure would have looked good in the starting lineup.\n\n\"Felton played great for us, and I wish we would have brought him back,\" Carlisle said. \"He was a big difference-maker for us last year and probably one of the big reasons we got to the playoffs. You look at the whole year and everything that happened start to finish, Ray was filling in and starting. And we were winning a lot of those games because of what he was giving us. He's a winner and was an ultimate pro here for two years. And the Clippers are very lucky to have him.\"\n\nLA coach Doc Rivers is finding out what Carlisle already knew. In fact, Carlisle is a big reason why Felton ended up with the Clippers.\n\n\"He's been the best,\" Rivers said. \"I talked to Rick this summer, and Rick gave him an amazing review and made me really want him. You couldn't ask for a better veteran to join your team.\"\n\nHow did the Clippers get Felton for the veteran's minimum contract?\n\n\"I begged,\" Rivers said. \"And I think Raymond is at the point where he wants to try to win. And I think that's why we got him. I wish it was my charm. But it wasn't.\""
