        "text": "Most New York Knicks fans are still reeling from the departure of Jeremy Lin — who was introduced in Houston yesterday — but perhaps they can take some comfort in Raymond Felton’s bravado, self-confidence and alleged weight loss. No? Alright then … From the NY Post and NY Times: “Moments after Jeremy Lin was being introduced by the Rockets in Houston, Felton was in Las Vegas talking with the MSG Network during a Knicks Summer League game. ‘I am a competitor, I am a point guard just like he is, so do I think I am better? Of course, I am going to say that,’ Felton said. ‘I think I am better than any point guard. That’s the way I am supposed to think. But at the same time it’s nothing personal between me and Jeremy. But people are going to make it about that. I am fine with that.’ […] Felton struggled last year with the Blazers during the strike-shortened season and has come under harsh criticism for the fact that he played out of shape. It’s not something that Felton denies, but at the same time he is determined to prove his naysayers wrong. ‘I wasn’t at the weight I [would] normally be in. I am not making no excuses, it was a lockout, I understand that. I am the first one to say, I wasn’t in shape,’ Felton said. .. . ‘I am hearing from everybody, he wasn’t in shape last year. I played in the league seven years, about to be eight, came in out of shape one year and that’s all everybody wants to talk about. They don’t talk about what you did good. They talk about when you do something bad. I look forward to this year and shutting up everybody’s mouth.’ […] ‘(This team) is good enough for the Finals. This is a contending team without a doubt,’ Felton said. ‘That’s the way I am supposed to feel, I think a lot of people should feel the same way. The thing I am excited about is I have so many options: ’Melo at one end, J.R. Smith on the other, Amar’e (Stoudemire) on the screen-and-roll or on the elbow, Tyson (Chandler) at the rim. There are so many things you can work with.’ […] At the Cox Pavilion on Thursday, Felton appeared to have lost a good portion of the weight he gained in Portland. Felton would not say how many pounds he shed, but when asked if it was more than 20, he smiled. ‘A whole lot,’ Felton said. ‘I’ll leave it at that. I’m ready to play.'”"
