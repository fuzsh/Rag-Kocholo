        "text": "Former New York Knicks point guard Raymond Felton recently appeared in the “Run Your Race” podcast to say that Carmelo Anthony is a better scorer than Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Kobe Bryant.\n\nRaymond Felton and Carmelo Anthony were part of the New York Knicks in the early 2010s. But they never became teammates because they were traded for one another in a five-player, three-pick deal between the New York Knicks and the Denver Nuggets in February 2011. Still, that hasn’t stopped Felton from making such a bold claim.\n\n“That dude, just the way he can score, how easy it is for him, I don’t know nobody who’s better, to be honest with you. I’m talking Tracy McGrady, I’m talking about MJ, I’m talking about Kobe, LeBron, all these guys. The way he used to score at every level, I don’t know nobody who’s better, for real,” Felton said about Carmelo Anthony.\n\n“I haven’t seen KD go off in the post like I’ve seen Melo go off in the post. Can KD score? For sure. Good gracious. That man can score easily. He scores easily for him to be 7-feet. But Melo, I’ve seen Melo score everywhere. I haven’t seen KD just get somebody in the post and I’m just gonna do you dirty, just post the whole game. I’ve seen Melo do that,” he concluded.\n\nThroughout his 19-year tenure in the league, Carmelo Anthony has shown his ability to get buckets from anywhere on the court using his variety of moves to throw defenders off. Listed at 6’7″ and 238 pounds, Carmelo Anthony can outpower his defenders or shoot over them with his silky-smooth jumper.\n\nWith 28,289 career points, Carmelo Anthony is 12th in the NBA’s all-time scoring list. He has career averages of 23.4 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game, a testament to his consistency and ability to contribute on the floor."
