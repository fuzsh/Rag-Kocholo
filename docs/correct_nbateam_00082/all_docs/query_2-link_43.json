Even though my clients are often business entities, ultimately it’s about the people involved and their goals and objectives are paramount. I approach each matter with that in mind.\n\nMr. Felton concentrates his practice in the areas of corporation, LLC and partnership formation, operations and agreements, mergers and acquisitions, securities law, reorganizations, joint ventures, employment law, and the financing of transactions through both public and private equity and debt. He often serves as outside “in house” counsel, providing general legal advice on both day-to-day issues and major complex problems.\n\nMr. Felton’s clients range from entrepreneurial start-ups to established middle market companies operating in a diverse variety of industries, including manufacturing, technology, food & beverage, real estate, construction and healthcare, as well as service industries. Mr. Felton also represents issuers and underwriters in public and private offerings and counsels clients concerning corporate governance and SEC compliance issues.\n\nResults may vary depending on your particular facts and legal circumstances."
