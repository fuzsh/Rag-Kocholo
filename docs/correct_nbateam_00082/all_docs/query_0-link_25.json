        "text": "Raymond Felton wants to be one of the captains of the New York Knicks for the next season, reports the New York Post.\n\n\"I've always been a leader, in high school and college,\" he said. Felton. Â«The thing was that I was away from the team for two years and I had to get used to the players again. But I came back and didn't try to put effort into that role. Without a doubt this year they will be under my command. \"I'm going to have a leadership role, no matter what happens,\" the point guard explained.\n\nThe player arrives very motivated to the preseason. He has been working throughout this summer to get in top shape and many claim that he has lost between 4 and 6 kilos of weight."
