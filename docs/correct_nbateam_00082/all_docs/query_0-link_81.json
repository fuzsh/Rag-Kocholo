        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) – New York police say Knicks player Raymond Felton has been arrested on three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\nSgt. Thomas Antonetti says Felton turned himself in at 12:50 a.m. Tuesday and was questioned in the 20th Precinct in Manhattan, hours after his team lost at home to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe sergeant says the charges don’t stem from him using the firearm in a menacing manner but of possessing a gun he wasn’t registered to have.\n\nAntonetti says the 29-year-old is now under the purview of the court system and will face a hearing sometime Tuesday. The charges include criminal possession of a weapon in the second, third and fourth degrees."
