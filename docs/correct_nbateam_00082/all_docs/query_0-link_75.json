        "text": "Thirty-year-old ex-New York Knicks basketball point guard Raymond Felton, who was traded to the Dallas Mavericks late last month, recently put the finishing touches on a divorce agreement with his 26-year-old wife Ariane Raymondo-Felton, the New York Daily News reported on July 3.\n\nThe divorce deal was outlined and agreed upon in the Manhattan Supreme Court, but the couple did not make these public, Raymondo-Felton’s lawyer William Beslow said. Although their prenuptial agreement mandated that divorce be undertaken through arbitration in North Carolina, a loophole allowed for a New York divorce if he cheated.\n\nAside from his divorce, Felton is in the process of finishing his criminal case. He agreed to plead guilty to a low-level felony of attempted possession of a weapon in order to receive no jail time.\n\nThe attorneys at Marshall & Taylor PLLC understand the often complicated nature of divorce and can guide you smoothly through the legal process. If you are planning to divorce in Raleigh, contact our experienced and compassionate attorneys at (919) 833-1040 to discuss your situation.\n\nThe divorce process is tough. Not only is it emotionally difficult and physically draining, but the actual legal process itself is simply unchartered territory for most of us. When my spouse served me with a separation papers & an out of this world financial proposal — I nearly had a heart attack. I was just plain shocked and totally unprepared for the ridiculous and unjustified financial demands that she wanted. I was an emotional wreck, but in a panic, I called my CPA advisor and asked for help. I’ve known my CPA for over 5 years having found him thru the Dave Ramsey website. When I asked him to recommend a divorce attorney, he gave me one name, Jeff Marshal. I’m not going to attempt to list all the reasons you should call Jeff, but I can attest that you will not be sorry you called. The divorce process has significant and lasting implications on everything important in your life after divorce. Make sure you that you have Jeff by your side when these decisions are being made, I am certain that you will be glad you did.\n\n- I recommend Jeff Marshall\n\nI found myself in a position of impending separation/divorce. My situation involved marital misconduct in another country(a very difficult to prove situation), did my due diligence; read reviews and went to visit 5 different attorneys... My case outcome was much better than the original offer I made to my ex spouse(before I had a lawyer) and giving credit where credit is due; Jeff’s knowledge to execution is what made the difference. I must add Jeff made me look past my anger and really had the best interests of me and my children in mind...- Client from Avvo\n\n- I highly recommend Jeff. Him and his staff are awesome!\n\nI recently used Jeff Marshall to settle my drawn-out and contentious divorce and custody cases, and found him to be extremely helpful. He took his time to get to know me and my situation, helped me make decisions moving forward, gave me great advice on things that I could do that would limit the time he needed to spend on the case (thus dropping my bill), and represented me quite well during my custody hearing. Having Jeff as my attorney was, in my opinion, critical to positive outcome I received from the custody hearing.- Client from Avvo\n\n- Great attorney!"
