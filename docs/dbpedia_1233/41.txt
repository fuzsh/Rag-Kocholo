Biography

Alberto Kenya Fujimori Fujimori was born in Lima, Peru, around 28 July 1938, the son of Naoichi and Mutsue Inomoto Fujimori. His Japanese name was Fujimori Ken'ya (藤森 謙也), later Kataoka Ken'ya (片岡 謙也).

Alberto began serving as President of Peru on 28 July 1990. Upon facing charges of corruption, he fled to Japan where he attempted to resign the presidency via fax in November 2000. However, the Peruvian Congress rejected the resignation and removed him from office via impeachment on 22 November. It is estimated that he embezzled $600 million during his regime.

Alberto remained in Japan before he was arrested while visiting Chile in November 2005; he was returned to Peru via extradition in September 2007 in order to face criminal charges related to his presidency. In December 2007, he was convicted of illegal search and seizures and sentenced to six years in prison; the sentence was upheld by the Peruvian Supreme Court. In April 2009, Alberto was also found guilty of human rights violations and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

In July 2009, Alberto was found guilty of embezzlement and received seven and a half years in prison. Two months later, he pleaded guilty to bribery and was sentenced to another six years in prison. His sentences ran concurrently according to Peruvian law, and his total length of sentence remained at 25 years. On 24 December 2017, he received a presidential pardon, which was later overturned on 3 October 2018.
