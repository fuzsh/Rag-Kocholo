Abe derives from two Japanese clans, one of which descended from Prince Ōhiko. Abe also means “sun festival” in the Ainu language. In English, Abe (AYB) is short for Abraham, while the Frisian Abe (A-buh) is a diminutive of Adalbert.\n\nOrigin: Japanese, English, Frisian\n\nMeaning: Many times peace, father of a multitude, noble\n\nPronunciation: A-BEH, AYB, A-buh\n\nNamesakes: Toshiki Abe, a Japanese professional baseball player.

The anime BLEACH includes a character called Love or Rabu (RA-BOO) Aikawa. This is likely a play on the meaning of the surname. Ranking 574th in 2014, Aikawa is somewhat common among Japanese last names.\n\nOrigin: Japanese\n\nMeaning: Love river, together stream\n\nPronunciation: EYE-ka-wa\n\nNamesakes: Ryoji Aikawa, a Japanese former professional baseball player.

It combines the Japanese kanji 赤 “aka,” meaning “red,” and 羽 “hane,” meaning “feather.” Since はね “hane” is an old dialect word for 埴 “hani” (clay), scholars think Akabane might translate to “red clay.” A popular fictional namesake is Karma Akabane from Assassination Classroom.\n\nOrigin: Japanese\n\nMeaning: Red feather, red wings\n\nPronunciation: A-KA-BA-NEH\n\nNamesakes: Kenji Akabane, a Japanese voice actor.

As one of the most mountainous nations worldwide, Japan’s sunrises sometimes give their peaks a red hue. Akamine likely stems from this picturesque scene. It’s fairly popular among Japanese surnames, ranking 1,226th.
