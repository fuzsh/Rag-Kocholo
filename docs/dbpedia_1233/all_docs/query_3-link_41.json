        "text": "Lima, July 3 (RHC)-- In Peru, the special anti-corruption prosecutor has asked for a sentence of 30 years in prison for Keiko Fujimori, a right-wing politician and the daughter of former dictator Alberto Fujimori. Known by the ‘Ms. K’ alias, she was the one who directed and coordinated money laundry activities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Anti-Corruption Prosecutor Jose Perez requested 30 years of imprisonment for former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori.\n\nKeiko Fujimori founded the Popular Force party not only with the aim of profiting from politics but also to achieve impunity for her criminal associates, Perez said in the oral trial against her and 45 other citizens and entities.\n\nMore specifically, the anti-corruption lawyer pointed out that the Popular Force party has attempted to control the Judiciary, the Public Prosecutor’s Office, and the National Board of Justice.\n\nPerez argued that, in her capacity as president of that party, Keiko Fujimori was aware of the income that Popular Force was collecting for its campaigning activities. The prosecutor began to describe how “the criminal organization captures assets of illicit origin with the aim of mixing the money with illicit assets.”\n\nOne of the prosecution’s witnesses, businessman Antonio Camayo, confirmed that Keiko Fujimori was known by the alias ‘Ms. K’ and that she was the one who directed and coordinated the criminal activities.\n\nCiting the facts related to the money laundering crime between 2011 and 2016, Perez recalled that the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht admitted to the United States Department of Justice that it had paid bribes to finance political campaigns.\n\nThe anti-corruption prosecutor announced that the former president of the Bank of Credit of Peru, Dionisio Romero, will attend the trial because he will testify that he personally handed over $3.6 million U$D in cash to Fujimori after withdrawing that money from his bank’s vault in Lima.\n\nDuring the hearing, Perez mentioned that the National Confederation of Private Business Institutions (CONFIEP) collected $2 million from 14 business groups, under the guise of a campaign to promote private investment, to hand over to Fujimori’s presidential campaign in 2011.\n\nSimilarly, the RASMUSS Investments business group collected $3.5 million in cash to hand over to people trusted by Fujimori, such as Jaime Yoshiyama and Augusto Bedoya.\n\nThe illegal contributions received by her party for the 2011 and 2016 presidential campaigns amount to $17 million U$D, said Rafael Vela, the coordinator of the Special Team of Prosecutors against Corruption."
