        "text": "Reproductive performance of Japanese Black cattle: Association with herd size, season, and parity in commercial cow-calf operations.\n\nPubMed\n\nSasaki, Yosuke; Uematsu, Mizuho; Kitahara, Go; Osawa, Takeshi\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe Japanese Black is the most common breed of beef cattle in Japan. However, only limited data are available on the associations of season, parity, and herd size with reproductive performance in Japanese Black cattle. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the associations of these factors with reproductive performance parameters, such as the calving to first service interval (CFSI) and first service conception rate in Japanese Black cattle. Data were collected from 34,763 calvings in 13,186 animals from 826 commercial cow-calf operations in the Miyazaki prefecture, which is located on the south eastern coast of Kyushu, Japan. This region has a temperate climate with warm humid summers and cold winters. All cattle were reared intensively, and the animals were housed in free stalls throughout their lives. The mean number of cows per farm was 18 (range, 1-454). All animals were bred by artificial insemination. Herds were classified into three groups based on size: small (â¤10 cows), intermediate (11-50 cows), and large (â¥51 cows). The mean (Â±SD) parity, CFSI, and the first service conception rate were 4.9Â Â±Â 2.9, 80.0Â Â±Â 46.2Â days, and 53.5 Â±Â 49.9%, respectively. Cows that calved in the spring (March to May) and winter (December to February) had the longest CFSI (PÂ <Â 0.05). The CFSI in first-parity cows was shorter than in cows at parity 7 or higher (PÂ <Â 0.05). Cows in large herds had an approximately 10Â days shorter mean CFSI than those in small herds (PÂ <Â 0.05). Cows inseminated in the winter or spring had an approximately 5% points lesser first-service conception rate (FSCR) than those inseminated during the summer (June to August) or autumn (September to November; PÂ <Â 0.05). As parity increased from 1 to 9, FSCR decreased from 60.0% to 43.1% (PÂ <Â 0.05). Cows in small herds had a lesser FSCR than those in intermediate and large herds (PÂ <Â 0.05). In summary, decreased reproductive performance in intensively reared\n\nIARS mutation causes prenatal death in Japanese Black cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nHirano, Takashi; Matsuhashi, Tamako; Takeda, Kenji; Hara, Hiromi; Kobayashi, Naohiko; Kita, Kazuo; Sugimoto, Yoshikazu; Hanzawa, Kei\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIsoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IARS) c.235Gâ>âC (p.V79L) is a causative mutation for a recessive disease called IARS disorder in Japanese black cattle. The disease is involved in weak calf syndrome and is characterized by low birth weight, weakness and poor suckling. The gestation period is often slightly extended, implying that intrauterine growth is retarded. In a previous analysis of 2597 artificial insemination (AI) procedures, we suggested that the IARS mutation might contribute toward an increase in the incidence of prenatal death. In this study, we extended this analysis to better clarify the association between the IARS mutation and prenatal death. The IARS genotypes of 92 animals resulting from crosses between carrier (G/C) Ã G/C were 27 normal (G/G), 55âG/C and 10 affected animals (C/C) (expected numbers: 23, 46 and 23, respectively). Compared to the expected numbers, there were significantly fewer affected animals in this population (Pâ<â0.05), suggesting that more than half of the affected embryos died prenatally. When the number of AI procedures examined was increased to 11â580, the frequency of re-insemination after G/C Ã G/C insemination was significantly higher at 61-140 days (Pâ<â0.001). The findings suggested that the homozygous IARS mutation not only causes calf death, but also embryonic or fetal death.

Artificial insemination and calving records were analyzed to investigate non-genetic effect on reproductive performances. A total of 2220 records of heifer raised between 2005 and 2016 were utilized in this study. Studied traits were first service non return rate to 56 days (NRR), first service pregnancy rate (FPR), days from first to successful insemination (FSI), number of services per conception (NSC), age at first calving (AFC), and gestation length (GL). Test of significance for effects in the statistical model was performed using GLM procedure of SAS 9.3. The yearling trend was plotted on the adjusted mean of parameters, by the least square mean procedure. Means of NRR, FPR, FSI, NSC, AFC and GL were 72%, 53%, 52.71 days, 1.76, 760.71 days and 288.26 days, respectively. The effect of farm was significant (P<0.001) for FSI, AFC, and GL. The effects of age of heifer at first insemination was significant (P<0.001) for AFC. Month of insemination and sex of calf were significant (P<0.001) for GL. Compared with average value of reproductive traits, NSC and GL were generally within standard values for Japanese Black cattle, while AFC was slightly earlier. The result indicated that different management of farms strongly influenced reproductive traits of Japanese Black heifer.\n\nFurosemide loading test in a case of homozygous solute carrier family 12, member 1 (SLC12A1) mutation (g.62382825G>A, p.Pro372Leu) in Japanese Black cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nHasegawa, Kiyotoshi; Sasaki, Shinji; Sakamoto, Yoichi; Takano, Akifumi; Takayama, Megumi; Higashi, Tomoko; Sugimoto, Yoshikazu; Yasuda, Yasuaki\n\n2017-10-01\n\nHydrallantois is the excessive accumulation of fluid in the allantoic cavity in a pregnant animal and is associated with fetal death. We recently identified a recessive missense mutation in the solute carrier family 12, member 1 (SLC12A1) gene (g.62382825G>A, p.Pro372Leu) that is associated with hydrallantois in Japanese Black cattle. Unexpectedly, we found a case of the homozygous risk-allele for SLC12A1 in a calf, using a PCR-based direct DNA sequencing test. The homozygote was outwardly healthy up to 3Â months of age and the mother did not exhibit any clinical symptoms of hydrallantois. In order to validate these observations, we performed confirmation tests for the genotype and a diuretic loading test using furosemide, which inhibits the transporter activity of the SLC12A1 protein. The results showed that the calf was really homozygous for the risk-allele. In the homozygous calf, administration of furosemide did not alter urinary Na + or Cl - levels, in contrast to the heterozygote and wild-type calves in which these were significantly increased. These results demonstrate that the SLC12A1 (g.62382825G>A, p.Pro372Leu) is a hypomorphic or loss-of-function mutation and the hydrallantois with this mutation shows incomplete penetrance in Japanese Black cattle.

A breeding objective that integrated the cow-calf and feedlot segments was considered. Ten breeding schemes that differed in the records available for use as selection criteria were defined. The schemes ranged from one that used carcass traits currently available to Japanese Black cattle breeders (Scheme 1) to one that also included linear measurements and male and female reproduction traits (Scheme 10). The latter scheme represented the highest level of performance recording. In all breeding schemes, sires were chosen from the proportion selected during the first selection stage (performance testing), modeling a two-stage selection process. The effect on genetic gain and profitability of varying test capacity and number of progeny per sire and of ultrasound scanning of live animals was examined for all breeding schemes. Breeding schemes that selected young bulls during performance testing based on additional individual traits and information on carcass traits from their relatives generated additional genetic gain and profitability. Increasing test capacity resulted in an increase in genetic gain in all schemes. Profitability was optimal in Scheme 2 (a scheme similar to Scheme 1, but selection of young bulls also was based on information on carcass traits from their relatives) to 10 when 900 to 1,000 places were available for performance testing. Similarly, as the number of progeny used in the selection of sires increased, genetic gain first increased sharply and then gradually in all schemes. Profit was optimal across all breeding schemes when sires were selected based on information from 150 to 200 progeny. Additional genetic gain and profitability were generated in each breeding scheme with ultrasound scanning of live animals for carcass traits. Ultrasound scanning of live\n\nBlack Press Commentary on the Japanese Internment during World War II.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJeter, James Phillip\n\nA study examined contemporary reactions of the Black American press to the relocation and internment of the Japanese and Japanese Americans during World War II.

The temperament records for 3128 calves during auction at a calf market were scored on a scale of 1 (calm) to 5 (nervous) as temperament score (TS), and the TS were divided into two groups (TSG): TS 1 and 2 comprised TSG 1, and 3 to 5 constituted TSG 2. Carcass data were obtained from 33Â 552 fattened cattle. A threshold animal model was used for analyzing the underlying liability for TSG, whereas a linear one was used for TS and carcass traits. The heritability estimates for TS and TSG were 0.12 and 0.11, respectively. On the other hand, moderate to high heritability estimates were obtained for carcass traits (0.40 to 0.68). The temperament scores were negatively correlated with carcass weight, rib thickness and subcutaneous fat thickness (-0.13 to -0.59). In contrast, weak to moderate positive correlations were found between the temperament scores and rib eye area or yield estimate (0.16 to 0.45). The temperament scores and beef marbling score had no correlation. These results showed that it is possible to improve temperament and carcass traits simultaneously.

The diversity of MHC genes may directly influence the survival of individuals against infectious disease. However, there has been no investigation of MHC diversity in the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus). Here, we analyzed 270-bp nucleotide sequences of the entire exon 2 region of the MHC DQB gene by using 188 samples from the Japanese black bear (Ursus thibetanus japonicus) from 12 local populations. Results Among 185 of 188 samples, we identified 44 MHC variants that encoded 31 different amino acid sequences (allotypes) and one putative pseudogene. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that MHC variants detected from the Japanese black bear are derived from the DQB locus. One of the 31 DQB allotypes, Urth-DQB*01, was found to be common to all local populations. Moreover, this allotype was shared between the black bear on the Asian continent and the Japanese black bear, suggesting that Urth-DQB*01 might have been maintained in the ancestral black bear population for at least 300,000 years. Our findings, from calculating the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, indicate that balancing selection has maintained genetic variation of peptide-binding residues at the DQB locus of the Japanese black bear. From examination of genotype frequencies among local populations, we observed a considerably lower level of observed heterozygosity than expected. Conclusions The low level of observed heterozygosity suggests that genetic drift reduced DQB diversity in the Japanese black bear due to a bottleneck event at the population or species level. The decline of DQB diversity might have been accelerated by the loss of rare variants that have been maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection. Nevertheless, DQB diversity of the black bear appears to be relatively high compared with some other endangered mammalian\n\nMHC class II DQB diversity in the Japanese black bear, Ursus thibetanus japonicus.\n\nPubMed\n\nYasukochi, Yoshiki; Kurosaki, Toshifumi; Yoneda, Masaaki; Koike, Hiroko; Satta, Yoko\n\n2012-11-29\n\nThe major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are one of the most important genetic systems in the vertebrate immune response.

Black bear (Ursus americanus) predation was the primary calf mortality factor. From 2006 to 2008, we trapped and relocated 49 bears (30 of which were radiocollared) from the primary calving areas in the Park and radiomonitored 67 (28 M:39 F) adult elk and 42 calves to compare vital rates and population growth with the earlier study. A model with annual calf recruitment rate correlating with the number of bears relocated each year was supported (ÎAICcâ=â0.000;Â Î²â=â0.070, 95% CIâ=â0.028â0.112) and a model with annual calf recruitment differing from before to during bear relocation revealed an increase to 0.544 (total SEâ=â0.098;Â Î²â=ââ1.092, 95% CIâ=ââ1.180 to â0.375). Using vital rates and estimates of process standard errors observed during our study, 25-yr simulations maintained a mean positive growth rate in 100% of the stochastic trials withÂ Î»Â averaging 1.118 (95% CIâ=â1.096â1.140), an increase compared with rates before bear relocation. A life table response experiment revealed that increases in population growth were mostly (67.1%) due to changes in calf recruitment. We speculate that behavioral adaptation of the elk since release also contributed to the observed increases in recruitment and population growth. Our results suggest that managers interested in elk reintroduction within bear range should consider bear relocation as a temporary means of increasing calf recruitment.\n\nNewborn calf welfare: a review focusing on mortality rates.\n\nPubMed\n\nUetake, Katsuji\n\n2013-02-01\n\nCalf mortality control is vitally important for farmers, not only to improve animal welfare, but also to increase productivity. High calf mortality rates can be related to larger numbers of calves in a herd, employee performance, severe weather, and the neonatal period covering the first 4 weeks of life. Although the basic premise of preventing newborn calf mortality is early detection and treatment of calves at risk for failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulins, calf mortality due to infectious diseases such as acute diarrhea increases in the presence of these physical and psychological stressors. This suggests that farmers should not ignore the effects of secondary environmental factors. For prevention rather than cure, the quality of the environment should be improved, which will improve not only animal welfare but also productivity. This paper presents a review of the literature on newborn calf mortality and discusses its productivity implications.

We examined the effect of black locust on the distribution of ECM and pathogenic fungi in soil. DNA was extracted from soil at depths of 0-5 and 5-10 cm, collected from the border between a Japanese black pine- and a black locust-dominated forest, and the distribution of these fungi was investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The effect of soil nutrition and pH on fungal distribution was also examined. Tomentella sp. 1 and Tomentella sp. 2 were not detected from some subplots in the Japanese black pine-dominated forest. Ectomycorrhizas formed by Tomentella spp. were dominant in black locust-dominated subplots and very little in the Japanese black pine-dominated forest. Therefore, the distribution may be influenced by the distribution of inoculum potential, although we could not detect significant relationships between the distribution of Tomentella spp. on pine seedlings and in soils. The other ECM fungi were detected in soils in subplots where the ECM fungi was not detected on pine seedlings, and there was no significant correlation between the distribution of the ECM fungi on pine seedlings and in soils. Therefore, inoculum potential seemed to not always influence the ECM community on roots. The distribution of Lactarius quieticolor and Tomentella sp. 2 in soil at a depth of 0-5 cm positively correlated with soil phosphate (soil P) and that of Tomentella sp. 2 also positively correlated with soil nitrogen (soil N). These results suggest the possibility that the distribution of inoculum potential of the ECM fungi was affected by soil N and soil P. Although the mortality of the pine seedlings was higher in the black locust-dominated area than in the Japanese black pine-dominated area, a pathogenic fungus of pine seedlings, Cylindrocladium pacificum, was\n\nA nasal osteoma with an acute course in a Japanese Black heifer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSATO, Reiichiro; UNE, Yumi; MADARAME, Hiroo; HANAMI, Hyougo; KANAI, Eiichi; MURAKAMI, Hironobu; TSUKAMOTO, Atsushi; SUZUKI, Takehito; OCHIAI, Hideharu; KIKUCHI, Masato; TANAKA, Hidekazu; ONDA, Ken\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA 14-month-old Japanese Black heifer presented with unilateral epistaxis and mild swelling of the right face. Radiography revealed a mass with increased radiopacity on the right side of the nasal bridge, extending to the left side. Intranasal endoscopy confirmed a large tumor-like structure protruding into the nasal cavity. Following euthanasia, cranial computed tomography (CT) was performed, revealing a tumor 24.3 Ã 17.5 Ã 14.8 cm in size. The tumor occupied the entire right nasal cavity and the frontal and sphenoid sinuses. Histopathological examination revealed that the tumor consisted of well-differentiated trabecular bones and loose connective tissue. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of osteoma was established.

The most important findings by the meat inspector were diffuse, black spots between 2 and 70 mm in diameter. This hyperpigmentation was observed on the entire carcass as well as on the outside and inside of all internal organs. Removal of the spinal cord produced black colored liquor. Subsequent microbiological examination of the meat resulted in sterile findings. The muscle pH was 5.8. On histological examination many macrophages containing melanin were found in the lung and liver. Based on these findings the diagnosis of Melanosis maculosa was made.\n\nEffects of stillbirth and dystocia on subsequent reproductive performance in Japanese Black cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nSasaki, Yosuke; Uematsu, Mizuho; Kitahara, Go; Osawa, Takeshi; Sueyoshi, Masuo\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to determine the effects of stillbirth and dystocia on subsequent reproductive performance in Japanese Black cattle. Data were collected for 34,763 calvings from 13,186 animals on 826 farms. Stillbirth was associated with a decreased first service conception rate compared to cows with a normal calving (44.4 versus 54.0%, respectively, Pâ<â0.001). Cows with a normal calving required fewer artificial inseminations per conception and had a lower stillbirth rate at subsequent parity than those with stillbirth and dystocia (Pâ<â0.001). Japanese Black cows with stillbirth and dystocia had inferior subsequent reproductive performance compared with those with a normal calving. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Ten steers (Clay group) were fed the clay (50âg/day) during 10-30 months of age. The other 10 steers (Control group) were not fed it. There was no significant difference in body weight or average daily gain between the two groups (Pâ>â0.05). The occurrence of fat necrotic mass in the Clay group (30%) was lower (Pâ<â0.05) than that in the Control group (90%) at slaughter. The size of necrotic masses in the Clay group was smaller (Pâ<â0.05) than that in the Control group. There was no significant difference in the marbling score, beef color, Longissimus muscle area or subcutaneous fat thickness between the two groups. These results suggest that the clay prevented the occurrence of fat necrosis and did not affect the carcass characteristics in Japanese Black steers.

However, polymorphisms in the leptin gene have not been reported thus far in Japanese Black cattle. Here, we aimed to identify the leptin gene polymorphisms which are associated with carcass traits and fatty acid composition in Japanese Black cattle. We sequenced the full-length coding sequence of leptin gene for eight Japanese Black cattle. Sequence comparison revealed eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Three of these were predicted to cause amino acid substitutions: Y7F, R25C and A80V. Then, we genotyped these SNPs in two populations (JB1 with 560 animals and JB2 with 450 animals) and investigated the effects on the traits. Y7F in JB1 and A80V in JB2 were excluded from statistical analysis because the minor allele frequencies were low (<â0.1). Association analysis revealed that Y7F had a significant effect on the dressed carcass weight in JB2; R25C had a significant effect on C18:0 and C14:1 in JB1 and JB2, respectively; and A80V had a significant effect on C16:0, C16:1, C18:1, monounsaturated fatty acid and saturated fatty acid in JB1. The results suggested that these SNPs could be used as an effective marker for the improvement of Japanese Black cattle.

Forest-grazing cattle are known to forage various native plants that have high TAC. This study evaluated differences of plasma TAC between forest-grazing (FG) and pasture-grazing cattle (PG). Experiment 1 monitored the plasma TAC levels of 32 Japanese Black cattle. The level in PG did not change throughout the grazing period. However, that in FG, which increased from summer, was significantly higher than that in PG through fall (Pâ<â0.05). In experiment 2, we used nine Japanese Black heifers and investigated their blood antioxidant parameters and the TAC in plants that the cattle consumed in late June and September. The plasma TAC levels in FG were significantly higher than those in PG in both periods (Pâ<â0.05). Plasma levels of lipid peroxidation in FG tended to be lower than that in PG (Pâ=â0.098). Furthermore, the TAC levels in various species of shrubs and trees consumed by FG were higher than those in pasture grasses. Results of this study show that plasma TAC of grazing Japanese Black cattle in forestland increase from summer through fall.

A total of 13 non-lactating Japanese Black cows (summer: 9, winter: 4) were examined. Body temperature was measured rectally and intravaginally using a thermometer and data logger, respectively. Estrous behavior was monitored using a radiotelemetric pedometer that recorded walking activity. Rectal temperatures were higher during summer than winter (P<0.001). There was an acute increase in vaginal temperature at the onset of estrus during winter but such an increase was not observed during summer. Walking activity during estrus decreased dramatically in the summer compared to the winter. Duration of estrous cycle was longer in summer (23.4 days, P<0.05) than winter (21.5 days), and the subsequent rise in progesterone concentrations following estrus tended to be delayed in summer. The level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in peripheral blood cells was higher during summer (P<0.05), while the levels of superoixde dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione were lower (P<0.05). These results indicate that high ambient temperature during summer increases both body temperature and oxidative stress, and also reduces signs of estrus in Japanese Black cows. Â© 2011 The Authors.

Therefore, here, we examined whether there was any correlation between the THI and the reproductive performance of Japanese Black cattle by analysing the first-service conception rates of 178,492 artificially inseminated cows across 9,833 herds in south-western Japan over a 3-year period. The daily mean (Â±SD) THI over the study period was 63.6Â Â±Â 11.3 (range: 41.4-81.5). The calving to first artificial insemination (AI) interval was significantly negatively correlated with THI in the month of AI (rÂ =Â -.75, pÂ <Â .001), whereas conception rate to first AI (CRFA) showed a cyclical change that did not correspond with that of THI, resulting in a time lag between CRFA and THI in the month of AI. Furthermore, there was a stronger correlation between CRFA and THI between 3 and 2Â months before AI (rÂ =Â .76 vs. .83, pÂ <Â .001) than in the month of AI (rÂ =Â .34, pÂ =Â .04). Therefore, this extensive field study showed that a decrease in THI was associated with declined reproductive performance in Japanese Black cattle and that the impact of the cold environment on the conception rate is attributable to a carryover effect from the cold season before AI rather than conditions at the time of AI.

The BLV proviral load, which represents the BLV genome integrated into host genome, is a useful index for estimating disease progression and transmission risk. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BLV proviral load in Japanese Black cattle. The study examined 93 cattle with a high proviral load and 266 with a low proviral load. Three SNPs showed a significant association with proviral load. One SNP was detected in the CNTN3 gene on chromosome 22, and two (which were not in linkage disequilibrium) were detected in the bovine major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 23. These results suggest that polymorphisms in the major histocompatibility complex region affect proviral load. This is the first report to detect SNPs associated with BLV proviral load in Japanese Black cattle using whole genome association study, and understanding host factors may provide important clues for controlling the spread of BLV in Japanese Black cattle.\n\nWelcome to CALFED Bay-Delta Program\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nSkip to: Content | Footer | Accessibility Search: Search CALFED Search CA.GOV | CALFED Bay-Delta California Delta Delta Home About the Delta CALFED Science About the Program Independent Science Board , CALFED Director photo of blue heron Bay-Delta Public Advisory Committee CALFED Agencies Calendar\n\nA genome-wide association study for fat-related traits computed by image analysis in Japanese Black cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakajima, Ayaka; Kawaguchi, Fuki; Uemoto, Yoshinobu; Fukushima, Moriyuki; Yoshida, Emi; Iwamoto, Eiji; Akiyama, Takayuki; Kohama, Namiko; Kobayashi, Eiji; Honda, Takeshi; Oyama, Kenji; Mannen, Hideyuki; Sasazaki, Shinji\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to identify genomic regions associated with fat-related traits using a Japanese Black cattle population in Hyogo. From 1836 animals, those with high or low values were selected on the basis of corrected phenotype and then pooled into high and low groups (nÂ =Â 100 each), respectively. DNA pool-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip v2 with three replicate assays for each pooled sample. GWAS detected that two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on BTA7 (ARS-BFGL-NGS-35463 and Hapmap23838-BTA-163815) and one SNP on BTA12 (ARS-BFGL-NGS-2915) significantly affected fat percentage (FAR). The significance of ARS-BFGL-NGS-35463 on BTA7 was confirmed by individual genotyping in all pooled samples. Moreover, association analysis between SNP and FAR in 803 Japanese Black cattle revealed a significant effect of SNP on FAR. Thus, further investigation of these regions is required to identify FAR-associated genes and mutations, which can lead to the development of DNA markers for marker-assisted selection for the genetic improvement of beef quality.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of season, parity and gestation length on the rates of stillbirth and dystocia in Japanese Black cattle. Calving records were obtained from 905 farms in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. Data were collected from 41,116 calvings in 15,378 (14.42% primiparous). There were 1013 stillbirths (2.46%) and 3514 dystocias (8.55%). The stillbirth rate in winter (December to February) (3.18%) was higher (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval]: 1.008 [1.004-1.012]) than that in summer (June to August). Similarly, the dystocia rates in winter (OR: 1.011 [1.004-1.019]) and spring (March to May) (OR: 1.020 [1.013-1.027]) were significantly higher than in summer. For primiparous cows, the rates of stillbirth (OR: 1.010 [1.004-1.015]) and dystocia (OR: 1.053 [1.042-1.064]) were higher than in cows with fifth parity (reference parity). Stillbirth rates were higher in cows at â¥ 301 days of pregnancy (OR: 1.049 [1.035-1.062]) and those at â¤ 270 days of pregnancy (OR: 2.072 [2.044-2.101]) than those at between 281 and 290 days of pregnancy. Likewise, dystocia rates were higher in cows at â¥ 301 days of pregnancy (OR: 1.033 [1.008-1.059]) and those at â¤ 270 days of pregnancy (OR: 1.124 [1.095-1.154]) than those at between 281 and 290 days of pregnancy. Winter, primiparity, and long and short gestation lengths were risk factors for stillbirth and dystocia in this cohort of Japanese Black cattle. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, male offspring nursing requires a much greater maternal energy contribution to lactation. It is possible that the maternal-fetal immunoendocrine dialog plays an important role in female preparation for lactation during pregnancy. Immune system genes are an integral part of gene regulatory networks in lactation and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) is a proinflammatory cytokine that also plays an important role in normal mammary gland development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the sex of calf and/or the -824A/G polymorphism in the promoter region of TNFÎ± gene on milk performance traits in Black Pied cattle over the course of lactation. We also studied the allele frequency differences of -824A/G variants across several cattle breeds, which were bred in different climatic conditions. The G allele frequency decreased gradually over the course of lactation events in the Black Pied dairy cattle because of a higher culling rate of cows with the G/G genotype (p<0.001). In contrast to the genotypes A/A and A/G, cows with G/G genotype showed significant variability of milk and milk fat yield subject to sex of delivered calf. Milk yield and milk fat yield were significantly higher in the case of birth of a bull calf than with a heifer calf (p<0.03). The G allele frequency varies from 48% to 58% in Grey Ukrainian and Black Pied cattle to 77% in aboriginal Yakut cattle. Our results suggest that the TNFÎ± -824A/G gene polymorphism may have an influence on the reproductive efforts of cows over the course of lactation events depending on the sex of progeny. Allocation of resources according to sex of the calf allows optimizing the energy cost of lactation. This may be a probable reason for high G allele frequency in Yakut cattle breeding in extreme environmental conditions. Similarly, the dramatic fall in milk production after birth of a\n\nThe change of sleeping and lying posture of Japanese black cows after moving into new environment.\n\nPubMed\n\nFukasawa, Michiru; Komatsu, Tokushi; Higashiyama, Yumi\n\n2018-04-25\n\nThe environmental change is one of the stressful events in livestock production. Change in environment disturbed cow behavior and cows needed several days to reach stable behavioral pattern, especially sleeping posture (SP) and lying posture (LP) have been used as an indicator for relax and well-acclimated to its environment. The aim of this study examines how long does Japanese black cow required for stabilization of SP and LP after moving into new environment. Seven pregnant Japanese black cows were used. Cows were moved into new tie-stall shed and measured sleeping and lying posture 17 times during 35 experimental days. Both SP and LP were detected by accelerometer fixed on middle occipital and hip-cross, respectively. Daily total time, frequency, and average bout of both SP and LP were calculated. Daily SP time was the shortest on day 1, and increased to the highest on day3. It decreased until day 9, after that stabilized about 65 min /day till the end of experiment. The longest average SP bout was shown on day 1, and it decreased to stabilize till day 7. Daily LP time was changed as same manner as daily SP time. The average SP bout showed the longest on day 1, and it decreased to stable level till day 7. On the other hand, the average LP bout showed the shortest on day1, and it was increased to stable level till on day 7. These results showed that pregnant Japanese black cows needed 1 week to stabilize their SP. However, there were different change pattern between the average SP and LP bout, even though the change pattern of daily SP and LP time were similar.\n\nPredictors of calf cramping in rugby league.\n\nPubMed\n\nSummers, Katherine M; Snodgrass, Suzanne J; Callister, Robin\n\n2014-03-01\n\nExercise-associated muscle cramps (EAMC) in the calf are common in rugby league. To date, the etiology and predictors of calf cramping are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to undertake a prospective investigation to identify predictors of calf cramping in rugby league players. Demographic and anthropometric data and calf cramp and injury history were collected in the preseason. Hydration status, number of games played, and calf cramps were recorded on game days. Male rugby league players (n = 103, mean age 18.8 Â± 4.1 years) were classified as either EAMC (experienced at least 1 incident of calf cramps in the season) or no EAMC (no calf cramps). The following were investigated as possible predictors of EAMC using logistic regression modeling: competition level, age, ethnicity, playing position, history of cramping, precramping, low back pain, foot orthotic usage, foot posture, foot strike, muscle flexibility, calf girth, hydration status, and number of games played. Half the players, n = 52, experienced at least 1 incidence of calf cramping. Playing in a senior competition level (odds ratio: 0.21; 95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.75; p = 0.016), a history of calf cramping (10.85; 2.16-54.44; p = 0.004), and a history of low back pain resulting in missed field minutes (4.50, 1.37-14.79; p = 0.013) were found to predict EAMC. This study suggests that there is a high incidence of calf cramping in rugby league, especially at senior competition levels, and supports preseason screening in senior players to idetify those at risk of calf cramping and the development of possible preventative strategies.\n\nRelationship of the bovine growth hormone gene to carcass traits in Japanese black cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nTatsuda, K; Oka, A; Iwamoto, E; Kuroda, Y; Takeshita, H; Kataoka, H; Kouno, S\n\n2008-02-01\n\nThe bovine growth hormone gene (bGH) possesses three haplotypes, A, B and C, that differ by amino acid mutations at positions 127 and 172 in the fifth exon: (leucine 127, threonine 172), (valine 127, threonine 172) and (valine 127, methionine 172) respectively. The correlation between meat quality or carcass weight and these haplotypes was investigated in Japanese black cattle. Altogether, 940 bGH haplotypes were compared with respect to six carcass traits: carcass weight, longissimus muscle area, rib thickness, subcutaneous fat thickness, beef marbling score and beef colour. The frequency of the B haplotype was higher (0.421) than that of A (0.269) and C (0.311). High carcass weight and low beef marbling were associated with haplotype A (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 respectively), whereas beef marbling was increased by haplotype C (p < 0.05). Estimated regression coefficient of the A haplotype substitution effect for carcass weight and beef marbling score were 5.55 (13.1% of the phenotypic SD) and -0.31 (17.0%) respectively. That of the C haplotype for beef marbling score was 0.20 (11.0%). The other traits showed no relationship to the haplotypes examined. The results of this investigation suggest that information pertaining to bGH polymorphisms in Japanese black cattle could be used to improve the selection of meat traits.\n\nQuestionnaire investigation to clarify the occurrence rate and characteristics of maternal rejection behavior in Japanese black cattle (Bos taurus).\n\nPubMed\n\nKohari, Daisuke; Takakura, Azusa\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe conducted a questionnaire investigation among breeding farmers to clarify the actual conditions of maternal rejection in Japanese Black cattle. We asked keeping experience of maternal rejective cows and compared occurrence patterns, rejective behavior manners, birth assistance methods, colostrum feeding method for calves, parity and rearing conditions of the cows. We found that 24% of the farms had kept rejective cows and 6% of the cows in these farms indicated maternal rejections. The most common occurrence pattern was 'Occurred from the first birth (65.6%)' and behavior manner was performing no maternal grooming with aggressive behavior (75%). Almost all the farmers assisted in each parturition (PÂ <Â 0.05). There was not a significant difference among the colostrum feeding methods, but a significant difference in the rearing conditions of the cows, except for the cows with no data (PÂ <Â 0.005). The parity of the rejective cows did not significantly differ in association with rejective behavior manners, birth assistance methods, colostrum feeding methods or rearing conditions. These results suggest that the occurrence rate of maternal rejection in Japanese Black cattle was approximately 6% and many of the rejective cows continuously performed no maternal grooming with aggressive behavior.

Although the incidence of hydrallantois is very low in artificial insemination breeding programs in cattle, recently 38 cows with the phenotypic appearance of hydrallantois were reported in a local subpopulation of Japanese Black cattle. Of these, 33 were traced back to the same sire; however, both their parents were reported healthy, suggesting that hydrallantois is a recessive inherited disorder. To identify autozygous chromosome segments shared by individuals with hydrallantois and the causative mutation in Japanese Black cattle, we performed autozygosity mapping using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and exome sequencing. Shared haplotypes of the affected fetuses spanned 3.52Â Mb on bovine chromosome 10. Exome sequencing identified a SNP (g.62382825Gâ>âA, p.Pro372Leu) in exon 10 of solute carrier family 12, member 1 (SLC12A1), the genotype of which was compatible with recessive inheritance. SLC12A1 serves as a reabsorption molecule of Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) in the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney. We observed that the concentration of Na(+)-Cl(-) increased in allantoic fluid of homozygous SLC12A1 (g.62382825Gâ>âA) in a hydrallantois individual. In addition, SLC12A1-positive signals were localized at the apical membrane in the kidneys of unaffected fetuses, whereas they were absent from the apical membrane in the kidneys of affected fetuses. These results suggested that p.Pro372Leu affects the membrane localization of SLC12A1, and in turn, may impair its transporter activity. Surveillance of the risk-allele frequency revealed that the carriers were restricted to the local subpopulation of Japanese Black cattle. Moreover, we identified a founder individual that carried the mutation (g.62382825Gâ>âA). In this study, we mapped the shared haplotypes of affected\n\nEffects of spaceflight on human calf hemodynamics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWatenpaugh, D. E.; Buckey, J. C.; Lane, L.

We measured resting calf compliance and blood flow with venous occlusion plethysmography, and arterial blood pressure with sphygmomanometry, in seven subjects before, during, and after spaceflight. Calf vascular resistance equaled mean arterial pressure divided by calf flow. Compliance equaled the slope of the calf volume change and venous occlusion pressure relationship for thigh cuff pressures of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mmHg held for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min, respectively, with 1-min breaks between occlusions. Calf blood flow decreased 41% in microgravity (to 1.15 +/- 0.16 ml x 100 ml(-1) x min(-1)) relative to 1-G supine conditions (1.94 +/- 0.19 ml x 100 ml(-1) x min(-1), P = 0.01), and arterial pressure tended to increase (P = 0.05), such that calf vascular resistance doubled in microgravity (preflight: 43 +/- 4 units; in-flight: 83 +/- 13 units; P < 0.001) yet returned to preflight levels after flight. Calf compliance remained unchanged in microgravity but tended to increase during the first week postflight (P > 0.2). Calf vasoconstriction in microgravity qualitatively agrees with the \"upright set-point\" hypothesis: the circulation seeks conditions approximating upright posture on Earth. No calf hemodynamic result exhibited obvious mechanistic implications for postflight orthostatic intolerance.\n\nNew hematological key for bovine leukemia virus-infected Japanese Black cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nMekata, Hirohisa; Yamamoto, Mari; Kirino, Yumi; Sekiguchi, Satoshi; Konnai, Satoru; Horii, Yoichiro; Norimine, Junzo\n\n2018-02-20\n\nThe European Community's (EC) Key, which is also called Bendixen's Key, is a well-established bovine leukemia virus (BLV) diagnostic method that classifies cattle according to the absolute lymphocyte count and age. The EC Key was originally designed for dairy cattle and is not necessarily suitable for Japanese Black (JB) beef cattle. This study revealed the lymphocyte counts in the BLV-free and -infected JB cattle were significantly lower than those in the Holstein cattle. Therefore, applying the EC Key to JB cattle could result in a large number of undetected BLV-infected cattle. Our proposed hematological key, which was designed for JB cattle, improves the detection of BLV-infected cattle by approximately 20%. We believe that this study could help promote BLV control.\n\nPrimary Ischial Osteosarcoma Occupying the Pelvic Cavity in a Japanese Black Cow\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNAGAMINE, Eiji; MATSUDA, Kazuya; ISHII, Chiaki; KOIWA, Masateru; TANIYAMA, Hiroyuki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nABSTRACT A 10-year-old Japanese Black cow presented with a swelling of the right femur, and a hard, large mass occupied the pelvic cavity. The mass strongly adhered to the visceral surface of the ischium and had posteriorly invaded among the right femoral muscles. Histologically, the mass was composed of neoplastic osteoblasts and exhibited osteoid and immature trabecular bone production. In the region where the mass adhered to the ischium, neoplastic cells were continuously proliferating into the medullary cavity. Tumor emboli were observed in the small vessels of the femoral muscles and lungs. Based on these findings, the mass was diagnosed as an osteosarcoma and considered to have arisen from the ischium.

Sexually-immature 2-year-old females, which are indistinguishable from sexually-mature females without calves, are included in the denominator, thereby biasing the calculated ratio low. This underestimate increases with the proportion of 2-year-old females in the population. We estimated the magnitude of this error with deterministic simulations under three scenarios of calf and yearling annual survival (respectively: low, 60 and 70%; medium, 70 and 80%; high, 80 and 90%) for five levels of unbiased NCP: 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%. We assumed a survival rate of 90% for both 2-year-old and mature females. For each NCP, we computed numbers of 2-year-old females surviving annually and increased the denominator of CCR accordingly. We then calculated a series of hypothetical âobservedâ CCRs, which stabilized during the last 6 years of the simulations, and documented the degree to which each 6-year mean CCR differed from the corresponding NCP. For the three calf and yearling survival scenarios, proportional underestimates of NCP by CCR ranged 0.046â0.156, 0.058â0.187, and 0.071â0.216, respectively. Unfortunately, because parturition and survival rates are typically variable (i.e., age distribution is unstable), the magnitude of the error is not predictable without substantial supporting information. We recommend maintaining a sufficient sample of known-age radiocollared females in each herd and implementing a regular relocation schedule during the calving period to obtain unbiased estimates of both parturition rate and NCP.\n\n9 CFR 113.41 - Calf safety test.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-01-01\n\n... 9 Animals and Animal Products 1 2011-01-01 2011-01-01 false Calf safety test. 113.41 Section 113.41 Animals and Animal Products ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE...

This trait is crucial in beef cattle because calves are necessary both for the production of beef and for heifer replacements. Recently, the number of calves produced at 4 years of age (NCP4) has been used to evaluate the calving efficiency of Japanese Black cattle. To identify variants associated with calving efficiency in Japanese Black cattle, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 688 animals with extreme NCP4 values selected from 15,225 animals. Results We identified genetic variants on bovine chromosome 12 (BTA12) that were associated with NCP4. The General Transcription Factor IIF, polypeptide 2 (GTF2F2), located in the 132 kbp-associated region, proved to be in strong linkage disequilibrium. We found 15 associated variants in the promoter and the 3' UTR regions. Consistent with this finding, transcripts of GTF2F2 derived from the haplotype (Q) with the increased number of calves were 1.33-fold more abundant than q-derived transcripts. Furthermore, luciferase assays revealed that the activity of the 3' UTR, a region that includes nine SNPs, was higher in constructs with the Q haplotype than in those with the q haplotype by approximately 1.35-fold. In contrast, the activity of the promoter region did not differ between haplotypes. The association was replicated in an independent sample of 827 animals that were randomly selected from the remainder of the cohort from the same farms used in the GWAS. In the replicated population, the frequency of the Q haplotype is 0.313, and this haplotype accounts for 2.69% of the total phenotypic variance. The effect of the Q to q haplotype substitution on NCP4 was 0.054 calves. These findings suggest that variants in the 3' UTR of GTF2F2 affect the level of GTF2F2 mRNA, which is associated with calving efficiency. Conclusions This GWAS has identified variants in\n\nEffects of a high milk intake during the pre-weaning period on nutrient metabolism and growth rate in Japanese Black cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsubara, Atsuko; Takahashi, Hideyuki; Saito, Akira; Nomura, Aoi; Sithyphone, Khounsaknalath; Mcmahon, Christopher D; Fujino, Ryoichi; Shiotsuka, Yuji; Etoh, Tetsuji; Furuse, Mitsuhiro; Gotoh, Takafumi\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThis study aimed to determine the effects of feeding an increased volume of high-fat milk during the early post-natal life on metabolite concentrations in the blood, the expression of key genes regulating intermediary metabolism in the skeletal muscles, and the rate of growth of Japanese Black cattle. All calves were fed a high-fat milk replacer (crude protein, 26%; crude fat, 25.5%; total dissolved nitrogen, 116%). Control calves (n = 4) were nursed with 500 g milk replacer until 3 months of age, whereas calves in the experimental group (n = 4) were nursed with 1800 g milk replacer until 3 months, and then the volume was gradually reduced until 5 months. Body weight was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group at 7 months. Plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower in the experimental group. Expression of glucose-transporter-4 messenger RNA (mRNA) was lower, whereas that of glucose transporter 1, cluster of differentiation 36, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1b mRNA was significantly higher in the Longissimus thoracis of the experimental group. Nutritional status during early post-natal life appears to strongly influence the growth rate and glucose and lipid metabolism in Japanese Black cattle.

Multiple breeds exist and management styles and objectives are as numerous as the number of cow-calf producers. There is not one area of the country, one breed of cattle, or one management style that is most profitable for producing cows and calves. There are, however, some common strategies that can be employed by cow-calf producers to enhance profitability. Costs need to be controlled without jeopardizing cow herd productivity or net returns. It appears that the cost associated with purchased and harvested feeds varies considerably across operations. Understanding cyclic and seasonal price patterns, weight-price slides, cattle shrink, and other marketing costs can help producers enhance their profit by marketing (and not by just selling) their cattle. Producers with superior cattle genetics can become part of a specific alliance or, at a minimum, document the performance of their cattle so that they can get paid for the superior genetics. The beef industry is changing and will likely continue to change. Cow-calf producers will need to examine their own management practices to determine whether they are optimal for the current industry. Those producers who are most adept at matching their management abilities to their cattle type, their resource base, and the appropriate market outlet will be the most successful in the future.\n\nPreventative programs for respiratory disease in cow/calf operations.\n\nPubMed\n\nEngelken, T J\n\n1997-11-01\n\nControl of respiratory disease in cow/calf operations presents many challenges. The incidence of disease in the suckling calf is not well documented and the logistics of handling range animals make control programs difficult to implement. Health programs have to be built around normal working patterns, and these patterns may not provide the best \"fit\" for immune management of the calf. Weaned calves undergo significant disease challenge when they enter typical marketing channels. This provides the potential for high levels of calf morbidity, mortality, medicine costs, and losses from decreased performance as they arrive at a stocker operation or feedyard. If preweaning calf health and preconditioning programs are used, they must be planned so that the producer has an opportunity to obtain a return on their investment. Options for increasing calf weight marketed, certified calf health sales, or retained ownership through the next phase of production should be evaluated carefully. Any potential increase in calf value must be weighed against program costs. This affords the veterinarian an opportunity to build on traditional disease management and prevention skills and expand their influence in overall ranch management.\n\nEffects of nutritional status on hormone concentrations of the somatotropin axis and metabolites in plasma and colostrum of Japanese Black cows.\n\nPubMed\n\nPhomvisith, Ouanh; Takahashi, Hideyuki; Mai, Ha Thi; Shiotsuka, Yuji; Matsubara, Atsuko; Sugino, Toshihisa; Mcmahon, Christopher D; Etoh, Tetsuji; Fujino, Ryoichi; Furuse, Mitsuhiro; Gotoh, Takafumi\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWe aimed to determine the effects of nutritional status on concentrations of somatotropic axis hormones (growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)), insulin and metabolites (glucose, total protein and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA)) in the plasma and colostrum in late antepartum cows. Eight pregnant Japanese Black cows were randomly assigned to two experimental groups (nâ=â4 per group). Control cows (CON) received 100% of their nutritional requirements until parturition, whereas restricted group cows (RES) received 60% of their nutritional requirements. Blood samples were taken during the antepartum period, and blood and colostrum samples were collected on days 0, 1, and 3 after calving. Compared to the CON group, the RES group had higher concentrations of GH and NEFA in plasma, but significantly lower concentrations of glucose and insulin in plasma. The concentrations of GH in plasma after calving were significantly higher, but total plasma protein was significantly lower in RES than in CON cows. Compared to the CON group, the RES group had significantly higher concentrations of GH in colostrum, but significantly lower total concentrations of protein in colostrum. Concentrations of IGF-1 were not different between the two groups. These findings suggest that maternal nutritional status during late gestation influences concentrations of GH and total protein in the blood and colostrum of Japanese Black cows.

Several subspecies of U. thibetanus have been recognized, one of which, the Japanese black bear, is distributed in the Japanese archipelago. Recent molecular phylogeographic studies clarified that this subspecies is genetically distantly related to continental subspecies, suggesting an earlier origin. However, the evolutionary relationship between the Japanese and continental subspecies remained unclear. To understand the evolution of the Asian black bear in relation to geological events such as climatic and transgression-regression cycles, a reliable time estimation is also essential. To address these issues, we determined and analyzed the mt-genome of the Japanese subspecies. This indicates that the Japanese subspecies initially diverged from other Asian black bears in around 1.46Ma. The Northern continental population (northeast China, Russia, Korean peninsula) subsequently evolved, relatively recently, from the Southern continental population (southern China and Southeast Asia). While the Japanese black bear has an early origin, the tMRCAs and the dynamics of population sizes suggest that it dispersed relatively recently in the main Japanese islands: during the late Middle and Late Pleistocene, probably during or soon after the extinction of the brown bear in Honshu in the same period. Our estimation that the population size of the Japanese subspecies increased rapidly during the Late Pleistocene is the first evidential signal of a niche exchange between brown bears and black bears in the Japanese main islands. This interpretation seems plausible but was not corroborated by paleontological evidence that fossil record of the Japanese subspecies limited after the Late Pleistocene. We also report here a new fossil record of the oldest Japanese black bear from the Middle Pleistocene\n\nPhylogeographic and Demographic Analysis of the Asian Black Bear (Ursus thibetanus) Based on Mitochondrial DNA.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Jiaqi; Kohno, Naoki; Mano, Shuhei; Fukumoto, Yukio; Tanabe, Hideyuki; Hasegawa, Masami; Yonezawa, Takahiro\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Asian black bear Ursus thibetanus is widely distributed in Asia and is adapted to broad-leaved deciduous forests, playing an important ecological role in the natural environment.

This significant development increases the intraruminal surface area and the efficiency of VFA (acetate, propionate, butyrate, etc.) uptake. Thus, it is important to investigate the factors controlling the growth and development of rumen papillae during weaning. This study aimed to compare the transcriptomes of rumen papillae in suckling and weaned calves. Total RNA was extracted from the rumen papillae of 10 male Japanese Black calves (5 suckling calves, 5 wk old; 5 weaned calves, 15 wk old) and used in RNA-sequencing. Transcript abundance was estimated and differentially expressed genes were identified and these data were then used in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to predict the major canonical pathways and upstream regulators. Among the 871 differentially expressed genes screened by IPA, 466 genes were upregulated and 405 were downregulated in the weaned group. Canonical pathway analysis showed that \"atherosclerosis\" was the most significant pathway, and \"tretinoin,\" a derivative of vitamin A, was predicted as the most active upstream regulator during weaning. Analyses also predicted IgG, lipopolysaccharides, and tumor-necrosis factor-Î± as regulators of the microbe-epithelium interaction that activates rumen-related immune responses. The functional category and the up-regulators found in this study provide a valuable resource for studying new candidate genes related to the proliferation and development of rumen papillae from suckling to weaning Japanese Black calves.\n\nA 100-Year Review: Calf nutrition and management.\n\nPubMed\n\nKertz, A F; Hill, T M; Quigley, J D; Heinrichs, A J; Linn, J G; Drackley, J K\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe first calf paper, published in the May 1919 issue of the Journal of Dairy Science (JDS), described factors affecting birth body weight of different breeds of calves. Other studies were done on nonmilk ingredients, growth charts were developed, and early weaning was followed to conserve milk fed to calves. Calf papers did not report use of statistics to control or record variation or to determine whether treatment means were different. Many experiments were more observational than comparative. Typically fewer than 5 calves, and sometimes 1 or 2 calves, were used per treatment. During the next 20 yr, calf studies increased and included colostrum feeding, milk and milk replacer feeding, minerals and vitamins, and fats and oils. Many concepts fundamental to current knowledge and understanding of digestion, rumen development, and milk replacer formulation were developed during this period. In addition, the concept of using antibiotic growth promoters in dairy calf diets was first evaluated and developed during the 1950s. During the 20-yr period of January 1957 through December 1976, a large number of universities in the United States and 1 in Canada contributed almost 150 papers on a variety of calf-related topics. These topics included genetics, physiology of the calf, review of calf immunity, antibiotic feeding, and milk replacer ingredients. This became the golden era of calf rumen development studies, which also engendered studies of calf starter rations and ingredients. A classic review of management, feeding, and housing studies summarized research related to calf feeding and management systems up to that point with an emphasis on maintaining calf growth and health while reducing labor and feed costs. It was also during this period that metric measurements replaced English units. In the 20-yr period from 1977 to 1996, more than 400 articles on calf nutrition and management were published in JDS. With the growing research interest in calves, a paper outlining\n\nComparison of the peripheral blood leukocyte population between Japanese Black and Holstein calves.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhtsuka, Hiromichi; Ono, Maiko; Saruyama, Yumi; Mukai, Machiko; Kohiruimaki, Masayuki; Kawamura, Seiichi\n\n2011-02-01\n\nJapanese black (JB) calves have greater susceptibility to infectious diseases compared to Holstein (Hol) calves. In order to clarify the differences in cellular immune status between JB and Hol calves, the leukocyte population and lymphocyte proliferative ability were analyzed. In total 200 healthy calves, 1 day to 14 weeks of age, were examined: 105 JB and 95 Hol calves. Lower numbers in peripheral blood and percentage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CD3(+)TcR1-N12(+) T cells and major histocompatibility complex class-II(+)CD14(-) B cells were observed in the JB compared to the Hol. The percentage of TcR1-N12(+)CD25(+) T cell in the JB was significantly lower than that of the Hol at 4-6, and 8-10 weeks. Interleukin (IL)-2 sensitivity in the JB was lower than that in the Hol, and significant differences were observed in age groups of 6-8 weeks and 10-14 weeks. These findings indicated that the lower numbers of Î³Î´ T cells and B cells in the JB compared to the Hol might be associated with the specificity of the immune systems in JB calves.

Beef-type steer (n = 801) and calf-fed Holstein steer (n = 235) carcasses were fabricated into subprimal cuts and trim. Simple correlations between calculated yield grades and total red meat yields ranged from -0.56 to -0.62 for beef-type steers. Reliable correlations from calf-fed Holstein steers were unobtainable; the probability of a type I error met or exceeded 0.39. Linear models were developed for the beef-type steers to predict total red meat yield based on calculated USDA yield grade within each ZH duration. At an average calculated USDA yield grade of 2.9, beef-type steer carcasses that had not been fed ZH had an estimated 69.4% red meat yield, whereas those fed ZH had an estimated 70.7% red meat yield. These results indicate that feeding ZH increased red meat yield by 1.3% at a constant calculated yield grade. However, these data also suggest that the calculated USDA yield grade score is a poor and variable estimator (adjusted R(2) of 0.31 to 0.38) of total red meat yield of beef-type steer carcasses, regardless of ZH feeding. Moreover, no relationship existed (adjusted R(2) of 0.00 to 0.01) for calf-fed Holstein steer carcasses, suggesting the USDA yield grade is not a valid estimate of calf-fed Holstein red meat yield.\n\nMaternal variant in the upstream of FOXP3 gene on the X chromosome is associated with recurrent infertility in Japanese Black cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nArishima, Taichi; Sasaki, Shinji; Isobe, Tomohiro; Ikebata, Yoshihisa; Shimbara, Shinichi; Ikeda, Shogo; Kawashima, Keisuke; Suzuki, Yutaka; Watanabe, Manabu; Sugano, Sumio; Mizoshita, Kazunori; Sugimoto, Yoshikazu\n\n2017-12-06\n\nRepeat breeding, which is defined as cattle failure to conceive after three or more inseminations in the absence of clinical abnormalities, is a substantial problem in cattle breeding. To identify maternal genetic variants of repeat breeding in Japanese Black cattle, we selected 29 repeat-breeding heifers that failed to conceive following embryo transfer (ET) and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the traits. We found that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; g.92,377,635Aâ>âG) in the upstream region of the FOXP3 gene on the X chromosome was highly associated with repeat breeding and failure to conceive following ET (Pâ=â1.51âÃâ10 -14 ). FOXP3 is a master gene for differentiation of regulatory T (T reg ) cells that function in pregnancy maintenance. Reporter assay results revealed that the activity of the FOXP3 promoter was lower in reporter constructs with the risk-allele than in those with the non-risk-allele by approximately 0.68 fold. These findings suggest that the variant in the upstream region of FOXP3 with the risk-allele decreased FOXP3 transcription, which in turn, could reduce the number of maternal T reg cells and lead to infertility. The frequency of the risk-allele in repeat-breeding heifers is more than that in cows, suggesting that the risk-allele could be associated with infertility in repeat-breeding heifers. This GWAS identified a maternal variant in the upstream region of FOXP3 that was associated with infertility in repeat-breeding Japanese Black cattle that failed to conceive using ET. The variant affected the level of FOXP3 mRNA expression. Thus, the results suggest that the risk-allele could serve as a useful marker to reduce and eliminate animals with inferior fertility in Japanese Black cattle.\n\nLarge calf circumference indicates non-sarcopenia despite body mass\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKusaka, Satomi; Takahashi, Tetsuya; Hiyama, Yoshinori; Kusumoto, Yasuaki; Tsuchiya, Junko; Umeda, Masaru\n\n2017-01-01\n\n[Purpose] The purpose of this study is to evaluate the applicability of the calf circumference as a tool for screening sarcopenia. [Subjects and Methods] One hundred sixteen community-dwelling elderly females were enrolled. Calf circumference of the dominant leg was measured using a plastic measuring tape. Subjects were divided into 3 groups based on body mass index (BMI); subjects with the values for BMI <18.5â kg/m2; those with BMI 18.5 to 25.0; those with BMI â¥25.0â kg/m2. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value of sarcopenia were calculated based on the obtained cut off values of calf circumference and the diagnosis of sarcopenia in each group. [Results] Prevalence rate of sarcopenia was 9.4% (n=10). Cut off value of the calf circumference was 32.8â cm (sensitivity: 73.0%, specificity: 80.0%, AUC: 0.792). Each BMI group showed high negative predictive value of sarcopenia based on the calf circumference cut off value of 32.8â cm. [Conclusion] These results suggested that to identify non-sarcopenia by larger calf circumference is more reasonable and useful than to identify sarcopenia due to the smaller calf circumference regardless of BMI.

Mean colostral IgG was 141âmg/mL, ranging from 65 to 208âmg/mL, whereas mean colostral IgA was 8.7âmg/mL, ranging from 1.0 to 34.6âmg/mL. Colostral IgG increased with aging in multiparous cows. There were positive correlations between colostral IgG and colostral vitamin A or colostral Î±-tocopherol in cows, and the higher adjusted R(2) was obtained in the prediction model of colostral IgG from age and colostral vitamin A. Colostral vitamin A was positively correlated with colostral Î²-carotene or colostral Î±-tocopherol in cows, but there were no relationships between colostral IgA and colostral IgG or colostral fat-soluble vitamins. These results indicate that fat-soluble vitamin contents in colostrum of cows may change in similar patterns and high colostral vitamin A is related with high colostral IgG.

Necropsy of the animal revealed that the right kidney was enlarged and pale with severe nephrolithiasis. The urinary bladder displayed mucosal hemorrhage. Upon bacteriological investigation, Proteus mirabilis was isolated from the liver, spleen, right kidney, lungs and urine. Histopathological examination revealed necrotizing suppurative nephritis with the presence of numerous gram-negative bacilli and fibrinous suppurative cystitis with no bacilli. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the bacteria and cytoplasm of the macrophages stained positively with P. mirabilis antiserum. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of numerous bacteria in the renal tubules. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the histopathological aspects of nephritis caused by P. mirabilis in cattle.\n\nTreatment of hypernatremia in an acidotic neonatal calf.\n\nPubMed\n\nAngelos, S M; Smith, B P; George, L W; House, J K; Van Metre, D C; Fecteau, G; Thacker, V C; Angelos, J A\n\n1999-05-01\n\nA 7-day-old Jersey calf was evaluated because of diarrhea and pneumonia. The calf was hypernatremic, hypoproteinemic, and acidemic, and was treated initially with i.v. administration of fluids with sodium concentration (175 mEq/L) similar to the calf's serum sodium concentration. Sodium concentration of the administered fluids was gradually decreased over the following days, but the calf's serum sodium concentration decreased too rapidly, and the calf developed neurologic signs attributed to cerebral edema. Treatment with mannitol and i.v. administration of fluids with a higher concentration of sodium resulted in abatement of clinical signs. In calves, hypernatremia may develop over several days. Prescribing traditional isotonic or hypotonic fluids in such cases will be harmful, because during chronic hypernatremia, the brain's adaptive mechanisms involve accumulation of organic osmoles that may take several days to equilibrate across cell membranes, and cerebral edema may result. Administration of fluids containing sodium concentration approximately equal to the patient's measured serum sodium concentration is required to decrease serum sodium concentration more slowly than is possible with traditional isotonic fluids.\n\nCalfScience: Extension Education at Many Levels\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMoore, Dale A.; Tellessen, Kathlyn; Sischo, William M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe issue of antimicrobial resistance in food animal agriculture was addressed by conducting clinical trials to assess alternatives to antimicrobials in dairy calf-raising and developing outreach to three different audiences.

Several studies reported that venous thromboembolism incidence after total hip arthroplasty was similar in patients who were administered prophylaxis with a conventional mechanical procedure alone, and those who were administered pharmacological anticoagulation therapy. Therefore, the optimum methods of prophylaxis are still controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether manual calf massage and passive ankle motion could lower the risk for venous thromboembolism after total hip arthroplasty. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 126 consecutive patients undergoing elective primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty wherein manual calf massage and passive ankle motion were performed after the surgery at our hospitals between January and October 2014. The 138 patients of the control group underwent total hip arthroplasty using the same surgical approach and pre- and postoperative protocols without this mechanical prophylaxis between January and December 2013. This mechanical prophylaxis was performed simultaneously 30 times during approximately 10Â s; these procedures were repeated thrice immediately after total hip arthroplasty. Duplex ultrasonography was performed to observe the veins of both legs in all the patients on postoperative day 7. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 6.52% and 0.79% in the control and manual calf massage and passive ankle motion groups, respectively. The odds ratio for the manual calf massage and passive ankle motion groups was 8.72. Performing this mechanical prophylaxis reduced the incidence of venous thromboembolism after total hip arthroplasty. This mechanical prophylaxis is not only simple and easy, but is also safe and inexpensive. We therefore recommend that manual calf massage and passive ankle motion be performed in patients who will undergo total hip\n\nZinc Methionine Supplementation Impacts Gene and Protein Expression in Calf-fed Holstein Steers with Miniaml Impact on Feedlot Performance\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nCalf-fed Holstein steers were supplemented with a zinc (Zn) methionine supplement (ZnMet; ZINPROÂ®; Zinpro Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN) for 115Â±5 days prior to harvest along with zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH; ZilmaxÂ®; Merck Animal Health, Summit, NJ) for the last 20 days with a 3 day withdrawal to ...\n\nAn overview of calf diarrhea - infectious etiology, diagnosis, and intervention\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCho, Yong-il\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCalf diarrhea is a commonly reported disease in young animals, and still a major cause of productivity and economic loss to cattle producers worldwide. In the report of the 2007 National Animal Health Monitoring System for U.S. dairy, half of the deaths among unweaned calves was attributed to diarrhea. Multiple pathogens are known or postulated to cause or contribute to calf diarrhea development. Other factors including both the environment and management practices influence disease severity or outcomes. The multifactorial nature of calf diarrhea makes this disease hard to control effectively in modern cow-calf operations. The purpose of this review is to provide a better understanding of a) the ecology and pathogenesis of well-known and potential bovine enteric pathogens implicated in calf diarrhea, b) describe diagnostic tests used to detect various enteric pathogens along with their pros and cons, and c) propose improved intervention strategies for treating calf diarrhea.

This study evaluated the relation between the seasonal foraging patterns of forest-grazing Japanese Black (JB) heifers or the TAC levels in shrubs and trees and the changes of plasma TAC. We examined 12 JB heifers, four each of which were allocated to forest-grazing (F), pasture-grazing, and pen-housed groups. The plasma TAC level in F heifers on July 26, August 13, 30 and September 17 were significantly higher than those on April 27 and June 4 (P < 0.05). In F group, the mean rates of foraging frequency (FF) of shrubs and trees during July 5-8 and September 13-16 were much higher than that during May 31-June 3 (P < 0.05). The rate of FF of grass significantly decreased later in the season (P < 0.05). The mean TAC levels in these shrubs and trees were higher than those in grasses, concentrates, and timothy hay. Results suggest that an important factor in the increase of plasma TAC in forest-grazing cattle might be the increased foraging of TAC-rich shrubs and trees during summer-fall. Â© 2015 Japanese Society of Animal Science.\n\nGenome-wide association study identified three major QTL for carcass weight including the PLAG1-CHCHD7 QTN for stature in Japanese Black cattle\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for carcass weight were previously mapped on several chromosomes in Japanese Black half-sib families. Two QTL, CW-1 and CW-2, were narrowed down to 1.1-Mb and 591-kb regions, respectively. Recent advances in genomic tools allowed us to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in cattle to detect associations in a general population and estimate their effect size. Here, we performed a GWAS for carcass weight using 1156 Japanese Black steers. Results Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significant associations were detected in three chromosomal regions on bovine chromosomes (BTA) 6, 8, and 14. The associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on BTA 6 were in linkage disequilibrium with the SNP encoding NCAPG Ile442Met, which was previously identified as a candidate quantitative trait nucleotide for CW-2. In contrast, the most highly associated SNP on BTA 14 was located 2.3-Mb centromeric from the previously identified CW-1 region. Linkage disequilibrium mapping led to a revision of the CW-1 region within a 0.9-Mb interval around the associated SNP, and targeted resequencing followed by association analysis highlighted the quantitative trait nucleotides for bovine stature in the PLAG1-CHCHD7 intergenic region. The association on BTA 8 was accounted for by two SNP on the BovineSNP50 BeadChip and corresponded to CW-3, which was simultaneously detected by linkage analyses using half-sib families. The allele substitution effects of CW-1, CW-2, and CW-3 were 28.4, 35.3, and 35.0 kg per allele, respectively. Conclusion The GWAS revealed the genetic architecture underlying carcass weight variation in Japanese Black cattle in which three major QTL accounted for approximately one-third of the genetic variance.

Forestomach fluid, feces, and peripheral blood were collected from healthy calves ( = 5; age 10 Â± 2 d) and scouring calves ( = 5; age 10 Â± 1 d) on the day on which white scours occurred. The pH and concentrations of VFA, lactic acid, and ammonia nitrogen (NH-N) of the forestomach fluids were determined. Microbiota composition and gene copy numbers in the forestomach fluid and feces were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), respectively. The cytokine mRNA level in peripheral leukocytes was evaluated by qPCR. The pH of the forestomach fluid of the scouring calves tended to be higher than that of the healthy calves ( = 0.056). No significant difference was detected in the total VFA, lactic acid, or NH-N concentrations in the forestomach fluids of the 2 groups. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla in the forestomach fluid and feces. At the genus level, the relative abundance of in the forestomach fluid was significantly higher in the scouring calves ( < 0.05) and the relative abundance of in the feces was significantly higher than that in the forestomach in the healthy calves ( < 0.05). Furthermore, the bacterial diversity indices of feces were lower in the scouring calves. Quantitative PCR amplification using some of the primer pairs failed in the forestomach fluid and feces in both groups. These results suggested that fermentation in the forestomach may affect the occurrence of white scours, resulting in changes in the composition and diversity of the forestomach fluid and fecal microbiota in Japanese Black calves.\n\nUltrasonographic findings of the various diseases presenting as calf pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Sun Joo; Kim, Ok Hwa; Choo, Hye Jung; Park, Jun Ho; Park, Yeong-Mi; Jeong, Hae Woong; Lee, Sung Moon; Cho, Kil Ho; Choi, Jung-Ah; Jacobson, Jon A\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThere are various causes of calf pain.

The material comprised 3 data sets. The first data set included information on 289,038 offspring in 14,474 dairy herds registered in the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System (NDHRS) in 2005. The second included recordings on 5,382 offspring in 125 Norwegian dairy herds participating in a survey on calf health, and the third included results from postmortem analyses of 65 calves from 37 of the survey herds. The calf mortality rate during the first year of life in all herds registered in the NDHRS was 7.8%, including abortion (0.7%) and stillbirth (3.4%). The overall calf mortality rate in liveborn calves in the survey herds was 4.6%. Cows with severe calving difficulties had an odds ratio (OR) of 38.7 of stillbirth compared with cows with no calving difficulties. Twins and triplets showed an increased risk of stillbirth compared with singletons (OR = 4.2 and 46.3, respectively), as did calves born in free stalls compared with tie stalls (OR = 1.9). Respiratory disease increased the risk of death in all age groups with hazard ratios (HR) of 6.4, 6.5, 7.4, and 5.6 during the first week of life, 8 to 30 d of age, 31 to 180 d of age, and 181 to 365 d of age, respectively. Diarrhea increased the risk of death among calves younger than 180 d of age, but the influence was only significant during the first week of life and between 8 to 31 d of age (HR = 2.4 and 2.9, respectively). Calves born during the winter were more likely to die during the first week of life than calves born during the summer (OR = 1.2), and were more likely to die during the first month of life than calves born during the autumn (OR = 1.2). Calf mortality rates in all age groups increased with increasing herd size. Calves housed in a group pen from 2 wk of age were more\n\nEffects of inclusion levels of pelleted silvergrass (Miscanthus sinensis Andress.) in the diet on digestibility, chewing activity, ruminal fermentation and blood metabolites in breeding Japanese Black cows.\n\nPubMed\n\nAsano, Keigo; Ishida, Miho; Ishida, Motohiko\n\n2017-03-01\n\nTo examine the effects of inclusion levels of pelleted silvergrass (PS) in the diet on digestibility, ruminal fermentation and nutrient status of breeding Japanese Black cows, four cows were allotted to a 4âÃâ4 Latin square design experiment. Treatments were control fed a diet consisting of 89.4% Sudangrass hay and 10.6% soybean meal on a dry matter (DM) basis, and PS18, PS27 and PS45 fed the diet replaced with 18%, 27% and 45% of control with PS, respectively. The total digestible nutrients (TDN) content of PS was 45.6% on a DM basis. The TDN intakes were significantly decreased by increasing PS level in the diet (Pâ<â0.05), but were higher than the TDN requirement of maintenance cows in all treatments. The total chewing time was decreased significantly by increasing PS level in the diets (Pâ<â0.05). However, the pH and concentration of volatile fatty acid in the ruminal fluid and serum metabolite concentrations were not significantly different among the treatments. The results suggested that including PS up to 45% in the diet did not have adverse effects on the ruminal fermentation and nutrient status in breeding Japanese Black cows at the maintenance stage.

The objective of this study was to search the potential candidate region for fatty acid composition. We performed pool-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for oleic acid percentage (C18:1) in a Japanese Black cattle population from the Hyogo prefecture. GWAS analysis revealed two novel candidate regions on BTA9 and BTA14. The most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each region were genotyped in a population (nÂ =Â 899) to verify their effect on C18:1. Statistical analysis revealed that both SNPs were significantly associated with C18:1 (pÂ =Â .0080 and .0003), validating the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) detected in GWAS. We subsequently selected VNN1 and LYPLA1 genes as candidate genes from each region on BTA9 and BTA14, respectively. We sequenced full-length coding sequence (CDS) of these genes in eight individuals and identified a nonsynonymous SNP T66M on VNN1 gene as a putative candidate polymorphism. The polymorphism was also significantly associated with C18:1, but the p value (pÂ =Â .0162) was higher than the most significant SNP on BTA9, suggesting that it would not be responsible for the QTL. Although further investigation will be needed to determine the responsible gene and polymorphism, our findings would contribute to development of selective markers for fatty acid composition in the Japanese Black cattle of Hyogo.

The data set covered 20âyears (1990-2009) of calving records. Total number of records was 9279. Daily weather information from weather stations in the vicinity of the farms was used. Temperature-humidity index (THI) fitted to a linear model covered 30âdays pre-insemination to 61âdays post-insemination. Statistical analysis was conducted with procedures of SAS/STAT. Preliminary analysis showed that THI of the lowest temperature and humidity was most conducive to AFC. Covariance analysis, including main effect of sire, farm and year of insemination and covariates of THI on days showed that regression coefficients of THI on day -7, day -2 and day +31 were statistically significant. The estimated piecewise regression line showed different responses of AFC to THI on days: roof-shasped downward trend on day -7, hockey-stick shaped upward trend on day -2 and day +31. The difference among the estimated regression lines may be caused by direct and indirect factors on reproduction: indirect effect of reduced feed intake, failure of conception at previous insemination, direct effect of heat stress on oocyte and embryo development.
