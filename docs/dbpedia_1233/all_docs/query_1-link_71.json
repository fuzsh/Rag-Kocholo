However, during the early 1900s several large-scale epidemics spread throughout the country. Here we investigate the dynamics of these epidemics between 1914 and 1933 in Osaka Prefecture, using archival data including newspapers. The association between dog rabies cases and human population density was investigated using Mixed-effects models and epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number (R0), the incubation and infectious period and the serial interval were estimated. A total of 4,632 animal rabies cases were reported, mainly in dogs (99.0%, 4,584 cases) during two epidemics from 1914 to 1921, and 1922 to 1933 respectively. The second epidemic was larger (3,705 cases) than the first (879 cases), but had a lower R0 (1.50 versus 2.42). The first epidemic was controlled through capture of stray dogs and tethering of pet dogs. Dog mass vaccination began in 1923, with campaigns to capture stray dogs. Rabies in Osaka Prefecture was finally eliminated in 1933. A total of 3,805 rabid dog-bite injuries, and 75 human deaths were reported. The relatively low incidence of human rabies, high ratio of post-exposure vaccines (PEP) and bite injuries by rabid dogs (minimum 6.2 to maximum 73.6, between 1924 and 1928), and a decline in the proportion of bite victims that developed hydrophobia over time (slope = -0.29, se = 3, p < 0.001), indicated that increased awareness and use of PEP might have prevented disease. Although significantly more dog rabies cases were detected at higher human population densities (slope = 0.66, se = 0.03, p < 0.01), there were fewer dog rabies cases detected per capita (slope = -0.34, se = 0.03, p < 0.01). We suggest that the combination of mass vaccination and restriction of dog movement enabled by strong legislation was key to eliminate rabies. Moreover, the prominent role of the media in both reporting rabies cases and efforts to control the disease likely contributed to\n\nThe rise and fall of rabies in Japan: A quantitative history of rabies epidemics in Osaka Prefecture, 1914â1933\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKurosawa, Aiko; Tojinbara, Kageaki; Kadowaki, Hazumu; Hampson, Katie; Yamada, Akio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nJapan has been free from rabies since the 1950s.

We applied regression models for relative survival to data from population-based cancer registries covering each prefecture for patients diagnosed with stomach, lung, or breast cancer during 1993-1996. Funnel plots were used to display the excess hazard ratio (EHR) for each prefecture, defined as the excess hazard of death from each cancer within 5 years of diagnosis relative to the mean excess hazard (in excess of national background mortality by age and sex) in all six prefectures combined. The contribution of age and stage to the EHR in each prefecture was assessed from differences in deviance-based R(2) between the various models. No significant differences were seen between prefectures in 5-year survival from breast cancer. For cancers of the stomach and lung, EHR in Osaka prefecture were above the upper 95% control limits. For stomach cancer, the age- and stage-adjusted EHR in Osaka were 1.29 for men and 1.43 for women, compared with Fukui and Yamagata. Differences in the stage at diagnosis of stomach cancer appeared to explain most of this excess hazard (61.3% for men, 56.8% for women), whereas differences in age at diagnosis explained very little (0.8%, 1.3%). This approach offers the potential to quantify the impact of differences in stage at diagnosis on time trends and regional differences in cancer survival. It underlines the utility of population-based cancer registries for improving cancer control.\n\nLong- and/or short-range transportation of local Asian aerosols in DRAGON-Osaka Experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNakata, M.; Sano, I.; Mukai, S.; Holben, B. N.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThis work intends to demonstrate the spatial and temporal variation of atmospheric particles in East Asia, especially around AERONET (Aerosol Robotics Network) -Osaka site during Dragon Asia period in the spring of 2012, named Dragon-Osaka. It is known that the air pollution in East Asia becomes to be severe due to both the increasing emissions of the anthropogenic aerosols associated with economic growth and the complicated behavior of natural aerosols. Thus the precise observations of atmospheric particles in East Asia are desired. Osaka is the second big city in Japan and a typical Asian urban area. The population of the region is around 20 millions including neighbor prefectures. Therefore, air quality in the region is slightly bad compared to remote area due to industries and auto mobiles. In recent years, Asian dusts and anthropogenic small particles transported from China and cover those cities throughout year. AERONET Osaka site was established in 2002 on the campus of Kinki University. Nowadays, LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), an SPM sampler (SPM-613D, Kimoto Electric, Japan) and others are available on the roof of a building. The site data are useful for algorithm development of aerosol retrieval over busy city. On the other hand, human activities in this region also emit the huge amount of pollutions, thus it is needed to investigate the local distribution of aerosols in this region. In order to investigate change of aerosol properties, PM-individual analysis is made with scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX). SEM/EDX is an effective instrument to observe the surface microstructure and analyze the chemical composition of such materials as metals, powders, biological specimens, etc. We used sampling data from the SPM sampler at AERONET Osaka site. During a period of DRAGON-Asia, high concentrations of air pollutant were observed on the morning of March 11 in Fukue Island in the East China Sea.

Currently, CMC is involved in Japanese national Grid projects such as JGN II (Japan Gigabit Network), NAREGI and BioGrid. Not limited to Japan, CMC also actively takes part in international activities such as PRAGMA. In these projects and international collaborations, CMC has developed a Grid system that allows scientists to perform their analysis by remote-controlling the world's largest ultra-high voltage electron microscope located in Osaka University. In another undertaking, CMC has assumed a leadership role in BioGrid by sharing its experiences and knowledge on the system development for the area of biology. In this paper, we will give an overview of the BioGrid project and introduce the progress of the Telescience unit, which collaborates with the Telescience Project led by the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research (NCMIR). Furthermore, CMC collaborates with seven Computing Centers in Japan, NAREGI and National Institute of Informatics to deploy PKI base authentication infrastructure. The current status of this project and future collaboration with Grid Projects will be delineated in this paper.\n\nNanocommunication design in graduate-level education and research training programs at Osaka University\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSekiya, Mizuki; An, SoonHwa; Ata, Masafumi\n\n2014-09-01\n\nAfter more than ten years of strategic investment research and development supported by government policies on science and technology, nanotechnology in Japan is making a transition from the knowledge creation stage of exploratory research to the stage of making the outcomes available for the benefit of society as a whole.

Population-based study of data extracted from the Osaka Cancer Registry. Population-based cancer registry in the area of Osaka Prefecture. All 66,032 cases diagnosed with a stomach cancer in Osaka Prefecture, Japan between 1975 and 2000 and registered in the Osaka Cancer Registry. 'Cure' fraction and median survival time for 'uncured' patients were estimated with multivariable mixture 'cure' model. The role played by age and stage at diagnosis on the changes in 'cure' parameters between 1975 and 2000 was evaluated. Missing stage was handled by multiple imputation approach. More than 50% of the patients diagnosed with a stomach cancer in 1996-2000 were estimated 'cured' from their cancer, corresponding to a 20% increase since 1975-1980. Median survival time for 'uncured' patients however remained unchanged at about 8 months. 'Cure' fraction was over 85% for localised tumours and 30% for regional tumours, but stayed as low as 2.5% for distant metastatic cancers. Improvement was underestimated by about 10% because of ageing of cancer patients. Changes in stage distribution explained up to 40% of the increase in 'cure' fraction among men and up to 13% in women. Overdiagnosis was unlikely to play any role in these patterns. 'Cure' fraction from stomach cancer dramatically increased in Osaka, Japan since 1975, partly because of earlier stage at diagnosis, but mostly due to improvement in treatment of stomach cancer patients. This study, based on a leading country in term of stomach cancer management, provides insightful results for other countries in which 'cure' fraction is usually much lower.

We equip various ground measurement devices in Higashi-Osaka campus of Kinki University. The data supplied by the Cimel instrument are analyzed with a standard AERONET (Aerosol Robotics Network) processing system. We set up an SPM sampler attached to our AERONET site. It is found from the simultaneous measurements and analyses that clear atmosphere with few small particles is not too often, usually polluted particles from diesel vehicles and industries are suspended at Higashi-Osaka and the characterization of atmospheric particles varies especially in dust phenomenon. Then we performed detailed analysis of atmospheric particles in dust days. We analyzed atmospheric particles with scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer. This instrument can detect contain elements of sample by X-ray emanated from the surface of the sample. In order to investigate change of particle properties before and after dust event, we select three cases as before dust reaches to Higashi-Osaka, peak of dust event and after dust event and after dust passes. The results of analyses for each case indicate that nonspherical particles with large particle size are dominant and the main component becomes silicon derived from soil particles at the peak of dust event and soil particles remain after dust event. It is found that sometimes anthropogenic pollutant is transported to Higashi-Osaka before dust comes and components from anthropogenic source increase before dust event.\n\nLong-period Ground Motion Simulation in the Osaka Basin during the 2011 Great Tohoku Earthquake\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIwata, T.; Kubo, H.; Asano, K.; Sato, K.; Aoi, S.\n\n2014-12-01\n\ndata recorded by K-NET, KiK-net and F-net of NIED, CEORKA, BRI, JMA, Osaka city waterworks bureau, and Osaka prefecture.

We analyzed 47 cases of measles reported in Osaka, including one measles patient living in another prefecture where there was an outbreak. We focused on age distribution, the number of patients reported each week, estimated infection routes, history of measles vaccination, detection of viruses, and number of days it took to report the case after the onset of measles. Patients aged 20-39 years accounted for 24 cases (51.1%). The number of patients reported started from 2nd week with relatively broad peak to 27(th) week, and the measles epidemic was brought under control in the 47(th) week. Among the 47 cases, no source could be identified in 16 cases (34.0%). Household exposure was the main cause of the infection (25.5%), followed by imported cases (21.3%). Eighty-three percent of the overall patients had not received a measles vaccination at all or it was unclear whether they previously had been vaccinated. Genotype B3, H1, and D8 were detected in our patients and these genotypes originated overseas. It took significantly more days, from the onset of measles, for the case to be reported in patients aged 15 years and over compared with those aged under 15 years (P=0.001). For eradicating measles in Osaka, it is important to raise awareness about this issue among medical institutions, especially institutions for adults, in order for them to report cases as soon as possible, upon discovery in their patients. In addition, \"catch-up\" supplementary immunizations are effective for all people, including adults who are susceptible to measles.\n\nEstimation of Effective Dose from External Exposure in The Six Prefectures adjacent to Fukushima Prefecture\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiyatake, Hirokazu; Yoshizawa, Nobuaki; Hirakawa, Sachiko; Murakami, Kana; Takizawa, Mari; Kawai, Masaki; Sato, Osamu; Takagi, Shunji; Suzuki, Gen\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident caused a release of radionuclides. Radionuclides were deposited on the ground not only in Fukushima prefecture but also in nearby prefectures. Since the accident, measurement of radiation in environment such as air dose rate and deposition density of radionuclides has been performed by many organizations and universities. In particular, Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has been performing observations of air dose rate using a car-borne survey system continuously and over wide areas. In our study, using the data measured by JAEA, we estimated effective dose from external exposure in the six prefectures adjacent to Fukushima prefecture. Since car-borne survey was started a few months later after the accident, measured air dose rate in this method is mainly contributed by 137Cs and 134Cs whose half-lives are relatively long. Therefore, based on air dose rate of 137Cs and 134Cs and the ratio of deposition density of short-half-life nuclides to that of 137Cs and 134Cs, we also estimated effective dose contributed from not only 137Cs and 134Cs but also other short-half-life nuclides. We compared the effective dose estimated by the method above with that of UNSCEAR and measured data using personal dosimeters in some areas.\n\nMuon Beamline Commissioning and Feasibility Study for Î¼SR at a New DC Muon Beamline, MuSIC-RCNP, Osaka University\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTomono, Dai; Fukuda, Mitsuhiro; Hatanaka, Kichiji; Higemoto, Wataru; Kawashima, Yoshitaka; Kojima, Kenji M.; Kuno, Yoshitaka; Matsuda, Yugo; Matsuzaki, Teiichiro; Miyake, Yasuhiro; Miyamoto, Koichiro; Morita, Yasuyuki; Motoishi, Takahiro; Nakazawa, Yu; Ninomiya, Kazuhiko; Nishikawa, Ryo; Ohta, Saki; Sato, Akira; Shimomura, Koichiro; Takahisa, Keiji; Weichao, Yao; Wong, Ming L.\n\nAt the new DC muon beamline MuSIC at Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Osaka University, the beamline construction from the solenoid system of the muon production to the experimental port was completed. A beamline commissioning and a feasibility study for Î¼SR are now in progress. With newly refurbished spectrometer installed at the experimental port, we succeeded in observing Î¼SR spectra and Î¼-e decay asymmetry in a simple setup down to 4â K. We are still under development of other Î¼SR appratuses.\n\nHighlighting the history of Japanese radio astronomy. 4: early solar research in Osaka\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOrchiston, Wayne; Nakamura, Tsuko; Ishiguro, Masato\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFor about two years, from late 1949, Minoru Oda and Tatsuo Takakura carried out solar observations from Osaka, initially with a hand-made horn and later with a small parabolic antenna connected to a 3.3 GHz receiver, but they only published one short paper on this work. At about the same time, Ojio and others at Osaka City University presented the concept of a solar grating array at a meeting of the Japan Physical Society, but this was never built. In this paper, we provide brief biographical accounts of Oda and Takakura before examining their radio telescopes and the observations that they made. We also briefly discuss the proposed Japanese solar grating array.\n\nTissue procurement system in Japan: the role of a tissue bank in medical center for translational research, Osaka University Hospital.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhkawara, H; Fukushima, N; Kitagawa, T; Ito, T; Masutani, Y; Sawa, Y\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAlthough organ procurement has been regulated by The Organ Transplantation Law (brain-dead donors since 1997, donors after cardiac death since 1979), there has been no law or governmental procurement network (except for cornea) in Japan. Since the late 1980s, some university hospitals have developed original banks. Finally, in 2001 guidelines for tissue procurement were established by The Japanese Society of Tissue Transplantation and Japan Tissue Transplant Network (JTTN) to coordinate tissue harvesting. Five tissue banks were joined to the tissue transplant network (skin in one, heart valves in two, and bone in two). As the number of tissue banks is small, each bank cooperates on procurement, but cannot cover the entire country. With regard to skin transplantation, only one skin bank-The Japan Skin Bank Network (JSBN), which is located in Tokyo-has organized skin procurement. Therefore, it has been difficult to procure skin in areas distant from Tokyo, especially around Osaka. In order to improve such a situation, a tissue bank collaborating with the JSBN was established at The Medical Center for Translational Research (MTR), Osaka University Hospital in April 2008. The bank has played a role in skin procurement center in western Japan and supported procurement and preservation at the time of the skin procurement. Between April 2008 and September 2009, the bank participated in eight tissue procurements in the western area. In the future, the bank is planning to procure and preserve pancreatic islets and bones. Moreover, there is a plan to set up an induced pluripotent stem cells center and stem cell bank in MTR. This tissue bank may play a role to increase tissue procurement in Japan, especially in the western area. .\n\nVerification and Improvement of the Three-Dimensional Basin Velocity Structure Model in the Osaka Sedimentary Basin, Japan Using Interstation Green's Functions and H/V Spectral Ratios of Microtremors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAsano, K.; Iwata, T.; Sekiguchi, H.; Somei, K.; Nishimura, T.; Miyakoshi, K.; Aoi, S.; Kunugi, T.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nas low as 350 m/s in 0.2-0.5 Hz. The second observation is a set of short-time (30~60 min) single-station microtremor observations to obtain H/V spectral ratios at sites. We observed microtremor at 100 strong motion stations of Osaka prefecture government, JMA, K-NET, KiK-net, and other institutes. The peak period of H/V ranges from about 1 to 7 s, and it depends on the bedrock depth at the observation site as previously pointed by Miyakoshi et al. (1997). Though the basin velocity model explains the characteristics of observed H/V spectral ratios at most sites, we found discrepancies between observed and predicted H/V peak periods at north part of Osaka bay area and hill area in southeastern part of the basin. By combining the observed constraints from the group velocities, waveform characteristics of interstation Green's functions, and H/V spectral ratios, we will improve the S-wave velocity structure model inside the Osaka basin.\n\nAn overview of multidisciplinary research resources at the Osaka University Center for Twin Research.\n\nPubMed\n\nHayakawa, Kazuo; Iwatani, Yoshinori\n\n2013-02-01\n\nOsaka University Center for Twin Research is currently organizing a government-funded, multidisciplinary research project using a large registry of aged twins living in Japan. The purpose of the project is to collect various information as well as biological resources from registered twins, and to establish a biobank and databases for preserving and managing these data and resources. The Center is collecting data from twin pairs, both of whom have agreed to participate in a one-day comprehensive medical examination. The following data are being collected: physical data (e.g., height, body mass, blood pressure, theoretical visceral fat, pulse wave velocity, and bone density), data regarding epidemiology (e.g., medical history, lifestyle, quality of life, mood status, cognitive function, and nutrition), electrocardiogram, ultrasonography (carotid artery and thyroid), dentistry, plastic surgery, positron emission tomography, magnetoencephalogram, and magnetic resonance imaging of brain. These data are then aggregated and systematically stored in specific databases. In addition, peripheral blood is obtained from the participants, and then genomic DNA is purified and sera are stored. A wide variety of studies are ongoing, and more are in the planning stage.\n\nInfluence of the 2009 financial crisis on detection of advanced pulmonary tuberculosis in Osaka city, Japan: a cross-sectional study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDanno, Katsura; Komukai, Jun; Yoshida, Hideki; Matsumoto, Kenji; Koda, Shinichi; Terakawa, Kazuhiko; Iso, Hiroyasu\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective To investigate the association between the economic recession and the detection of advanced cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in Osaka city from 2007 to 2009. Design A repeated cross-sectional study. Setting Osaka city has been the highest tuberculosis burden area in Japan. After the previous global financial crisis, the unemployment rate in Osaka prefecture has deteriorated from 5.3% in 2008 to 6.6% in 2009. Participants During the study period, 3406 pulmonary tuberculosis cases were enrolled: 2530 males and 876 females; 1546 elderly cases (65â years and above) and 1860 young cases (under 65â years); 417 homeless cases and 2989 non-homeless cases. Outcome measures Patientsâ information included the sex, age, registry, health insurances, places of detection, sputum smear test results, patientsâ delay, doctorsâ delay and the grade of chest x-ray findings. They were statistically analysed between 2007 and 2008, two years before and just before the financial crisis, and between 2008 and 2009, just before and after the financial crisis. Results The total numbers of pulmonary tuberculosis cases were 1172 in 2007, 1083 in 2008 and 1151 in 2009. In health examinations for non-homeless people, higher number of cases in 2009 were sputum smear positive, had respiratory symptoms and showed advanced disease in chest x-rays than those in 2008, with a longer patientsâ delay. On the contrary, in health examination for homeless people, fewer cases of advanced pulmonary tuberculosis were found in 2009 than in 2008, with a shorter patientsâ delay. In clinical examinations, there was no trend towards a difference between non-homeless and homeless people. Conclusions Although homeless people might be protected by public assistance, tuberculosis prevention and control need to be reinforced for the non-homeless population after the financial crisis.

A repeated cross-sectional study. Osaka city has been the highest tuberculosis burden area in Japan. After the previous global financial crisis, the unemployment rate in Osaka prefecture has deteriorated from 5.3% in 2008 to 6.6% in 2009. During the study period, 3406 pulmonary tuberculosis cases were enrolled: 2530 males and 876 females; 1546 elderly cases (65 years and above) and 1860 young cases (under 65 years); 417 homeless cases and 2989 non-homeless cases. Patients' information included the sex, age, registry, health insurances, places of detection, sputum smear test results, patients' delay, doctors' delay and the grade of chest x-ray findings. They were statistically analysed between 2007 and 2008, two years before and just before the financial crisis, and between 2008 and 2009, just before and after the financial crisis.

The fight against felonious crimes in Kumamoto is introduced by reference to the police system, crime statistics, an association of police surgeons and medico-legal autopsy in Kumamoto Prefecture. The police have 23 local police stations with 2,670 police officers and the unique Hashutsu-sho and Chyuzai-sho systems. The crime rate is not very high, but crimes committed by Yakuza groups and traffic accidents are major problems in Kumamoto. Medico-legal autopsy is performed in the university department on only criminal and suspected cases after examination of the body externally by a police surgeon. Two illustrative cases are also introduced in this report, which shows good cooperation among the police force, the university department of forensic medicine, and police surgeons in Kumamoto, Japan.\n\nGenerational and regional differences in trends of mortality from ischemic heart disease in Japan from 1969 to 1992.\n\nPubMed\n\nOkayama, A; Ueshima, H; Marmot, M; Elliott, P; Choudhury, S R; Kita, Y\n\n2001-06-15\n\nThe authors compared generational and regional trends of premature mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD) from 1969 to 1992 for persons aged 30-69 years. They selected Tokyo and Osaka prefectures as the most urbanized and compared them with the rest of Japan. The data were divided into two periods: period I (1969-1978, International Classification of Diseases, Eight Revision) and period II (1979-1992, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision). In both populations, IHD mortality decreased for both sexes, but mortality from nonspecific heart disease remained constant in men and decreased in women. In Tokyo and Osaka prefectures, the percentage decline per year in IHD mortality for both sexes was significantly smaller in period II than in period I. However, in the rest of Japan, it did not decrease for either sex. Age-specific analysis showed that the percentage decline per year in period II was smallest for the group aged 30-49 years (men, 0.05%; women, 0.76%) in Tokyo and Osaka prefectures, while it was similar for all age groups in the rest of Japan. For men, the IHD mortality rate in 1991-1992 for those aged 30-49 years was higher in Tokyo and Osaka prefectures (9.4/100,000) than in the rest of Japan (5.4/100,000).\n\nPublic-access AED pad application and outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Osaka, Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nKiyohara, Kosuke; Kitamura, Tetsuhisa; Sakai, Tomohiko; Nishiyama, Chika; Nishiuchi, Tatsuya; Hayashi, Yasuyuki; Sakamoto, Tetsuya; Marukawa, Seishiro; Iwami, Taku\n\n2016-09-01\n\nActual application of public-access automated external defibrillator (AED) pads to patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) by the public has been poorly investigated. AED applications, prehospital characteristics, and one-month outcomes of OHCAs occurring in Osaka Prefecture from 2011 to 2012 were obtained from the Utstein Osaka Project registry. Patients with a non-traumatic OHCA occurring before emergency medical service attendance were enrolled. The proportion of AED pads that were applied to the patients' chests by the public and one-month outcomes were analysed according to the location of OHCA. In total, public-access AED pads were applied to 3.5% of OHCA patients (351/9978) during the study period. In the multivariate analyses, OHCAs that occurred in public places and received bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation were associated with significantly higher application of public-access AEDs. Among the patients for whom public-access AED pads were applied, 29.6% (104/351) received public-access defibrillation. One-month survival with a favourable neurological outcome was significantly higher among patients who had an AED applied compared to those who did not (19.4% vs. 3.0%; OR: 2.76 [95% CI: 1.92-3.97]). The application of public-access AEDs leads to favourable outcomes after an OHCA, but utilisation of available equipment remains insufficient, and varies considerably according to the location of the OHCA event. Alongside disseminating public-access AEDs, further strategic approaches for the deployment of AEDs at the scene, as well as basic life support training for the public are required to improve survival rates after OHCAs.

The moats in Osaka Castle were built in the 1620s, and the undisturbed sediment core, which consists of atmospheric deposits in Osaka city from 1671 to 1976, was withdrawn from the moat. PAHs in the sediment core were identified and quantified in the total concentration range of 0.053-26 mg kg -1 dry wt. The highest content of PAHs was found in the sample, which was dated to 1944 during World War II. Osaka Castle was exposed to intense bombing raids during World War II, and the spiked peak of the PAH concentration during the mid-1940s was due to the air attacks. The total PAH concentration in the sediment core sample during World War II was about two-fold greater than the average after the war. This study made it appear that the largest impact of PAHs on the atmospheric environment in Osaka city in almost 300 years was caused by modern warfare.\n\nRelationship between displacement and gravity change of Uemachi faults and surrounding faults of Osaka basin, Southwest Japan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nInoue, N.; Kitada, N.; Kusumoto, S.; Itoh, Y.; Takemura, K.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe Osaka basin surrounded by the Rokko and Ikoma Ranges is one of the typical Quaternary sedimentary basins in Japan. The Osaka basin has been filled by the Pleistocene Osaka group and the later sediments. Several large cities and metropolitan areas, such as Osaka and Kobe are located in the Osaka basin. The basin is surrounded by E-W trending strike slip faults and N-S trending reverse faults. The N-S trending 42-km-long Uemachi faults traverse in the central part of the Osaka city. The Uemachi faults have been investigated for countermeasures against earthquake disaster. It is important to reveal the detailed fault parameters, such as length, dip and recurrence interval, so on for strong ground motion simulation and disaster prevention. For strong ground motion simulation, the fault model of the Uemachi faults consist of the two parts, the north and south parts, because of the no basement displacement in the central part of the faults. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology started the project to survey of the Uemachi faults. The Disaster Prevention Institute of Kyoto University is carried out various surveys from 2009 to 2012 for 3 years. The result of the last year revealed the higher fault activity of the branch fault than main faults in the central part (see poster of \"Subsurface Flexure of Uemachi Fault, Japan\" by Kitada et al., in this meeting). Kusumoto et al. (2001) reported that surrounding faults enable to form the similar basement relief without the Uemachi faults model based on a dislocation model. We performed various parameter studies for dislocation model and gravity changes based on simplified faults model, which were designed based on the distribution of the real faults. The model was consisted 7 faults including the Uemachi faults. The dislocation and gravity change were calculated based on the Okada et al. (1985) and Okubo et al. (1993) respectively. The results show the similar basement displacement pattern to the\n\n[Contribution of the Department of Laboratory Medicine for the Protection and the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus in Tokushima Prefecture].\n\nPubMed\n\nNoma, Yoshihiko\n\n2006-09-01\n\nDiabetes mortality rates of Tokushima prefecture have been worst one in Japan for 12 years. We started up the organization named \"Tokushima Medical Doctors Association against Diabetes\" for the disease prevention and the improvement of the treatments in Tokushima prefecture. More than 240 medical doctors in Tokushima prefecture joined the association. The activities of the association are ( 1) training of medical doctors, (2) education for co-medical staffs, (3) education and enlightenment for patients and the public, (4) cooperation with Tokushima prefectural medical association and the communities. For the purpose of education for the co-medical staffs, we organized the association of Certified Diabetes Educator of Japan in Tokushima and support the association as the secretariat office. We also work as Tokushima branch office of Japan Association for Diabetes and Education and Care. The prevention of disease and the improvement of medical activity level are one of the big roles those the university hospital is responsible, because the university hospital is anticipated to work as a medical leader in the community. As the University hospital can take care of all medical staffs, so it is thought to be important to contribute the local medical treatment level different with the medical association and prefecture secretariat. The promotion conference for Diabetes mellitus was established last year. The relation among the associations we take care, the local medical association, and the prefecture secretariat are getting better. We hope that our cooperative activities will contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality from diabetes in Tokushima prefecture.\n\nLong-period Ground Motion Characteristics Inside and Outside of the Osaka Basin during the 2011 Great Tohoku Earthquake and Its Largest Aftershock\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSato, K.; Iwata, T.; Asano, K.; Kubo, H.; Aoi, S.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nepicenter, the synthetic waveforms of the period-band 5-50s, where Kubo et al. (2013) studied, fit well to the observed ones. However, in our target period-band 5-8s, the earlier portion of the synthetic waveform of the main packet has smaller amplitude than the observation. At the bedrock sites near the Osaka basin, two wave packets which are appeared in the observation are qualitatively reproduced in the synthetics. However, the amplitudes are not well reproduced. Moreover, the amplitude ratio of horizontal components of synthetics between the rock and the bayside stations is underestimated compared to the observed one. Improvements of the source and velocity structure models for propagation-path and basin are needed. For that sake, we will analyze the characteristics of the synthetic waveforms, study how those wave packets are generated, and discuss the discrepancy between the synthetic and observed waveforms. We will also simulate the ground motion for the mainshock to study propagation characteristics of the mainshock.

Profiles and achievements of several active learners are briefly described; they include Koishi Genzui (Osaka-Kyoto), Tsuji Ranshitsu (Kyoto), Kimura KenkadÅ (Osaka), and Hashimoto SÅkichi (Osaka). Genzui, after having successfully made good relations with Sugita Genpaku and Ohtsuki Gentaku, leading masters of the Edo school, played a role of an advocator for promoting \"Rangaku\" in Osaka and Kyoto. As a result, KenkadÅ attained the publication of his book \"Ikkaku SankÅ,\" a monograph of the Western crude drug unicorn, with the help of Gentaku, who had translated a Dutch reference into Japanese for him. Ranshitsu and SÅkichi were taught the Dutch language by Gentaku; SÅkichi is known as the founder of \"Rangaku\" in Osaka.\n\nModeling of Wave Propagation in the Osaka Sedimentary Basin during the 2013 Awaji Island Earthquake (Mw5.8)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAsano, K.; Sekiguchi, H.; Iwata, T.; Yoshimi, M.; Hayashida, T.; Saomoto, H.; Horikawa, H.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nthe side and bottom of the domain. It is parallelized by the MPI and OpenMP. We computed for 120000 steps with a time step of 0.0025 s, which equals to 300s from the origin time. The source is represented by a point source having the focal mechanism determined by the F-net, NIED and the duration of its source time function is set to 3.1s referring to the waveform fitting at the rock stations outside the basin. In the previous studies for the Osaka basin (Horikawa et al., 2003; Kawabe and Kamae, 2006; Iwaki and Iwata, 2011), Q0 at a reference period T0 is given by a function of S-wave velocity; Q0=Î±Vs. We fixed T0 at 5s, and tested Q0 value changing Î± from 0.1 to 1.0. Comparing the envelope of synthetic velocity waveforms with that of observed waveforms in the basin, Î± of 0.3 fits to the observation well, whereas the difference from 0.2 to 0.5 is not significant. The simulation explains the characteristics of observed seismic waves propagating inside the basin in terms of duration and amplitude at most stations. The response velocity spectra and dominant period would be demonstrated to see the areal performance of present velocity model (UMC2013), and we will discuss how later phases generates and propagates based on the simulated wave field.

Osaka Bay is located in the central part of the Osaka Basin and is underlaid with Pre-Neogene basement rocks covered by an unconsolidated sequence of Plio-Pleistocene marine, fluvial and lacustrine sediments. Fifteen laterally continuous marine clays (from Ma-1 to Ma13, in ascending order) have been identified throughout the Osaka Basin that have been correlated with the marine eustatic record. Deep borehole and high resolution seismic data were acquired in Kobe (northern part of the basin) and Kansai International Airport (southern part of the basin). Sequence stratigraphy defined by seismic reflectors was used to reveal the stratigraphic differences between the two areas. By identifying reflectors as marine clay layers throughout the basin, we were able to divide the study area into three parts (northern, middle and southern parts) and to estimate the sedimentation rate in each location. The sedimentation rate increases from the northern and southern margins of the basin towards central Osaka Bay in the middle of the basin. In the southern parts, the sharp decline of sedimentation rate between Ma2 and Ma4 and thinning or complete lack of the reflectors corresponding to Ma5 and Ma6 layers result from tilting in this region.\n\nSchool-Based Fluoride Mouth-Rinse Program Dissemination Associated With Decreasing Dental Caries Inequalities Between Japanese Prefectures: An Ecological Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsuyama, Yusuke; Aida, Jun; Taura, Katsuhiko; Kimoto, Kazunari; Ando, Yuichi; Aoyama, Hitoshi; Morita, Manabu; Ito, Kanade; Koyama, Shihoko; Hase, Akihiro; Tsuboya, Toru; Osaka, Ken\n\n2016-11-05\n\nDental caries inequalities still severely burden individuals' and society's health, even in countries where fluoride toothpastes are widely used and the incidence of dental caries has been decreasing. School-based fluoride mouth-rinse (S-FMR) programs, a population strategy for dental caries prevention, might decrease dental caries inequalities. This study investigated the association between S-FMR and decreasing dental caries prevalence and caries-related inequalities in 12-year-olds by Japanese prefecture. We conducted an ecological study using multi-year prefecture-level aggregated data of children born between 1994 and 2000 in all 47 Japanese prefectures. Using two-level linear regression analyses (birth year nested within prefecture), the association between S-FMR utilization in each prefecture and 12-year-olds' decayed, missing, or filled permanent teeth (DMFT), which indicates dental caries experience in their permanent teeth, were examined. Variables that could explain DMFT inequalities between prefectures, such as dental caries experience at age 3 years, dentist density, and prefectural socioeconomic circumstances, were also considered. High S-FMR utilization was significantly associated with low DMFT at age 12 (coefficient -0.011; 95% confidence interval, -0.018 to -0.005). S-FMR utilization explained 25.2% of the DMFT variance between prefectures after considering other variables. Interaction between S-FMR and dental caries experience at age 3 years showed that S-FMR was significantly more effective in prefectures where the 3-year-olds had high levels of dental caries experience. S-FMR, administered to children of all socioeconomic statuses, was associated with lower DMFT. Utilization of S-FMR reduced dental caries inequalities via proportionate universalism.\n\nPhased Array Radar Network Experiment for Severe Weather\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUshio, T.; Kikuchi, H.; Mega, T.; Yoshikawa, E.; Mizutani, F.; Takahashi, N.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nPhased Array Weather Radar (PAWR) was firstly developed in 2012 by Osaka University and Toshiba under a grant of NICT using the Digital Beamforming Technique, and showed a impressive thunderstorm behavior with 30 second resolution. After that development, second PAWR was installed in Kobe city about 60 km away from the first PAWR site, and Tokyo Metropolitan University, Osaka Univeristy, Toshiba and the Osaka Local Government started a new project to develop the Osaka Urban Demonstration Network. The main sensor of the Osaka Network is a 2-node Phased Array Radar Network and lightning location system. Data products that are created both in local high performance computer and Toshiba Computer Cloud, include single and multi-radar data, vector wind, quantitative precipitation estimation, VIL, nowcasting, lightning location and analysis. Each radar node is calibarated by the baloon measurement and through the comparison with the GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement)/ DPR (Dual Frequency Space borne Radar) within 1 dB. The attenuated radar reflectivities obtained by the Phased Array Radar Network at X band are corrected based on the bayesian scheme proposed in Shimamura et al. [2016]. The obtained high resolution (every 30 seconds/ 100 elevation angles) 3D reflectivity and rain rate fields are used to nowcast the surface rain rate up to 30 minutes ahead. These new products are transferred to Osaka Local Government in operational mode and evaluated by several section in Osaka Prefecture. Furthermore, a new Phased Array Radar with polarimetric function has been developed in 2017, and will be operated in the fiscal year of 2017. In this presentation, Phased Array Radar, network architecuture, processing algorithm, evalution of the social experiment and first Multi-Prameter Phased Array Radar experiment are presented.\n\nSecular variation between 5 and 10c CE in Japan: remeasurements of 2000 samples collected between 1960-70's from Sueki earthenware kilns in Osaka.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShibuya, H.; Mochizuki, N.; Hatakeyama, T.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nIn Japan, archeomagnetic measurements are vigorously developed for years, though it is not well known to paleomagnetism community in english. One of the works is massive archeomagnetic study of Suemura kiln group carried out in Osaka University in 1960's to early 70's. More than 500 kilns were excavated in Sakai city and vicinities, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The kiln group is called as Suemura Kilns, and are for Sueki earthenware of 5c to 10c CE. About 300 kilns were sampled and most of the samples were measured at the time, and the results are reported in e.g. Hirooka (1971) and Shibuya (1980). However, the results have significant scatter in direction, which may be due to the limitation of old astatic magnetometer measurements and handwriting graphic determination of magnetic direction, and/or the lack of demagnetization. We recently inherited many of those samples and remeasured them with spinner magnetometer applying alternation field demagnetization (afd). The magnetizations are generally very stable, as usual as other archeomagnetic samples, and afd does not change the magnetic direction mostly. However, significant number of sites show large scatter in magnetic directions, which might be due to the wrong identification of kiln floor or disturbance at the time of collapsing or excavation. Taking kilns of Î±95<4o, we recovered 131 paleomagnetic directions. Although third of them are dated by pottery shape chronology, the range of each pottery style is not precisely known and the relation of the baked floor and the potteries excavated around kilns are not always clear. The carbon dating of those kilns are very scares. Thus we first try to draw secular variation curve in declination-inclination plot. With the rough ages of those kilns, it is pretty easy to draw the SVC. It is also numerically determined taking the distance of each direction from nearest point in SVC and the velocity change of the SVC as penalty function, within a couple of degrees in the error\n\nSchool-Based Fluoride Mouth-Rinse Program Dissemination Associated With Decreasing Dental Caries Inequalities Between Japanese Prefectures: An Ecological Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMatsuyama, Yusuke; Aida, Jun; Taura, Katsuhiko; Kimoto, Kazunari; Ando, Yuichi; Aoyama, Hitoshi; Morita, Manabu; Ito, Kanade; Koyama, Shihoko; Hase, Akihiro; Tsuboya, Toru; Osaka, Ken\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Dental caries inequalities still severely burden individualsâ and societyâs health, even in countries where fluoride toothpastes are widely used and the incidence of dental caries has been decreasing.

Epidemiologic investigation, including review of medical and laboratory records, procedural investigations, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing of environmental and patient isolates, statistical study, and recommendation of control measures. All patients admitted to a 380-bed, secondary-care hospital in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, from July 1999 through June 2000 (study period). Seventy-one patients were colonized or infected with S. marcescens; 3 patients who developed primary BSIs on the same ward within 5 days in June 2000 had isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns and indwelling intravenous catheters for more than 5 days. On multivariate analysis, among 36 case-patients with positive sputum specimens and 95 control-patients, being bedridden (odds ratio [OR], 15.91; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 4.17-60.77), receiving mechanical ventilation (OR, 7.86; CI95, 2.27-27.16), being older than 80 years (OR, 3.12; CI95, 1.05-9.27), and receiving oral cleaning care (OR, 3.10; CI95, 1-9.58) were significant risk factors. S. marcescens was isolated from the fluid tanks of three nebulizers and a liquid soap dispenser. The hospital did not have written infection control standards, and many infection control practices were found to be inadequate (eg, respiratory equipment was used without disinfection between patients). Poor hospital hygiene and the lack of standard infection control measures contributed to infections hospital-wide. Recommendations to the hospital included adoption of written infection control policies.\n\nFollow-up study of the regional quota system of Japanese medical schools and prefecture scholarship programmes: a study protocol.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsumoto, Masatoshi; Takeuchi, Keisuke; Tanaka, Junko; Tazuma, Susumu; Inoue, Kazuo; Owaki, Tetsuhiro; Iguchi, Seitaro; Maeda, Takahiro\n\n2016-04-15\n\nGiven the shortage of physicians, particularly in rural areas, the Japanese government has rapidly expanded the number of medical school students by adding chiikiwaku (regional quotas) since 2008. Quota entrants now account for 17% of all medical school entrants. Quota entrants are usually local high school graduates who receive a scholarship from the prefecture government. In exchange, they temporarily practise in that prefecture, including its rural areas, after graduation. Many prefectures also have scholarship programmes for non-quota students in exchange for postgraduate in-prefecture practice. The objective of this cohort study, conducted by the Japanese Council for Community-based Medical Education, is to evaluate the outcomes of the quota admission system and prefecture scholarship programmes nationwide. There are 3 groups of study participants: quota without scholarship, quota with scholarship and non-quota with scholarship. Under the support of government ministries and the Association of Japan Medical Colleges, and participation of all prefectures and medical schools, passing rate of the National Physician License Examination, scholarship buy-out rate, geographic distribution and specialties distribution of each group are analysed. Participants who voluntarily participated are followed by linking their baseline information to data in the government's biennial Physician Census. Results to date have shown that, despite medical schools' concerns about academic quality, the passing rate of the National Physician License Examination in each group was higher than that of all medical school graduates.

Using 100 MeV and 296 MeV proton beams, neutron fields with nominal peak energies of 96 MeV and 293 MeV were generated via 7Li(p,n)7Be reactions. Neutrons produced at 0Â° and 25Â° emission angles were extracted into the 100 m long time-of-flight (TOF) tunnel, and the energy spectra were measured at a distance of 35 m from the target. To deduce the corresponding neutron spectra from thermal to the nominal maximum energy, the ERBSS data were unfolded using the MSANDB unfolding code. At high energies, the neutron spectra were also measured by means of the TOF method using NE213 organic liquid scintillators. The results are discussed in terms of ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), and compared with the readings of other instruments operated during the experiment.\n\nSex differences in lung cancer survival: long-term trends using population-based cancer registry data in Osaka, Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nKinoshita, Fukuaki Lee; Ito, Yuri; Morishima, Toshitaka; Miyashiro, Isao; Nakayama, Tomio\n\n2017-09-01\n\nSeveral studies of sex differences in lung cancer survival have been reported. However, large-size population-based studies based on long-term observation are scarce. We investigated long-term trends in sex differences in lung cancer survival using population-based cancer registry data from Osaka, Japan. We analyzed 79 330 cases from the Osaka Cancer Registry (OCR) diagnosed between 1975 and 2007. We calculated 5-year relative survival in the six periods (1975-1980, 1981-1986, 1987-1992, 1993-1997, 1998-2002 and 2003-2007). To estimate the trends in sex differences in lung cancer survival throughout the study period, we applied a multivariate excess hazard model to control for confounders. The proportion of adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 5-year relative relative survival have increased for both sexes. Sex differences in lung cancer survival have widened over the period, especially in ADC and since the late 1990s. The excess hazard ratio of death within 5 years for males was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.16-1.21), adjusting for period at diagnosis, histologic type, stage, age group and treatment. We reported that females have better prognosis in lung cancer than males and the sex differences in lung cancer survival have become wider in Osaka, Japan. This can be partly explained by the sex differences in the proportions of histologic type and stage. Further studies considering other factors that influence sex differences in lung cancer survival are needed. Â© The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Of 126 customers who patronized a particular Japanese restaurant during the event, 102 developed symptoms of gastrointestinal disease. We isolated strains of ETEC serotype O169:H41 from 1 food sample and from fecal samples collected from 19 of 34 patients and 2 of 4 food handlers. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of these isolates suggested that the foodborne pathogen that caused the diarrheal outbreak was a specific clone of ETEC serotype O169:H41. Based on these findings and our interviews with the restaurant owner and employees, we concluded that a likely cause of the outbreak was an overwhelmed capacity of the restaurant kitchen in terms of preservation of sanitary procedures during the festival and the inability of the restaurant staff to handle the relatively large quantity of food to ensure a lack of contamination with ETEC. Thus, we reconfirm that ETEC strains of serotype O169:H41 remain important causes of domestic foodborne outbreaks in developed countries, including Japan.\n\nDatabase Deposit Service through JOIS : JAFIC File on Food Industry and Osaka Urban Engineering File\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKataoka, Akihiro\n\nJICST has launched the database deposit service for the excellent quality in small-and medium size, both of which have no dissemination network.

We analyzed the incidence rate in Osaka City in five-year period from 1978 to 1997, namely, 1978-1982 (period I), 1983-1987 (period II), 1988-1992 (period III), and 1993-1997 (period IV). Until the first half of 1980, the tuberculosis incidence rate in Osaka City had been dropping every year, but the rate of decline has been slowed substantially or even stopped since 1983. The incidence rate ratio of Osaka City compared with the national rate was 2.0 to 2.3 from 1970 to 1975, but it has been increasing from 1983 and is now higher than 3. We divided 24 wards of Osaka City into five groups based on selected employment indicators of population 15 years of age and over of 1995 National Census. Group A consists of two wards characterized by extremely high unemployment rate, Group B of four wards by high unemployment rate and high rate of manufacturing workers, Group C of six wards by high rate of non-manufacturing workers (tertiary industry workers), Group D of five wards by high rate of manufacturing workers, and Group E of seven wards by residential areas. The incidence rate of Group A had been declining during periods I and II but started to rise after period III. The rates of Group B and C had been declining from period I to II but the decline slowed down substantially even for every age class in periods III and IV. The incidence rates of Groups D and E have been falling. The incidence rate of the 50-69 year-old age group has been increasing substantially. The proportion of newly registered patients in Group A to all patients of Osaka City increased from 25.2% in period I to 32.7% in period IV. The number of newly registered patients of the 40-69 age class in Group A accounted for 45.1% of that in Osaka City in period IV. The slowdown in the reduction of the tuberculosis incidence rate has occurred not in all, but in only a few wards and it is a typical phenomenon of the middle-aged in those\n\nBenthic foraminiferal assemblages in Osaka Bay, southwestern Japan: Faunal changes over the last 50 years\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTsujimoto, Akira; Nomura, Ritsuo; Yasuhara, Moriaki; Yoshikawa, Shusaku\n\n2006-01-01\n\nLive benthic foraminiferal assemblages from surface sediment in Osaka Bay collected in 1999 were analyzed to characterize the distribution of the modern foraminiferal assemblages. Foraminiferal assemblages were compared with those of previous studies to document environmental changes in Osaka Bay over the past 50 years. Sixty-one species of foraminifera belonging to 37 genera were recognized from the 1999 surface sediment samples. An agglutinated assemblage containing Trochammina hadai and Eggerella advena is dominant in the inner part of the bay and is related to eutrophication. The foraminiferal assemblage in areas deeper than about 20 m is composed of Eggerella advena, Ammonia beccarii forma A, and Pseudorotalia gaimardii. This assemblage may be influenced by the large clockwise Okinose Circulation Current which extends throughout the western bay. Foraminiferal assemblages in Osaka Bay have changed dramatically during the last 50 years. The Trochammina hadai-Eggerella advena assemblage became established in the inner part of the bay, reflecting eutrophication that progressed from the 1960s through the 1970s. This assemblage became dominant in 1983, and typically dominated the inner part of the bay. From 1983 to 1999, however, the abundance of taxa belonging to this assemblage decreased greatly following implementation of 1973 Osaka City bylaws that restricted wastewater discharge. Changes in benthic assemblages such as the decrease of Ammonia beccarii forma A and increase of Eggerella advena have occurred in response to decreased incidence of red tides, and floral change in the species that cause these tides. The results of this study demonstrate that the abundance and distribution of benthic foraminifers in Osaka Bay are intimately related to environmental changes related to the urbanization of coastal areas. ?? by the Palaeontological Society of Japan.\n\nAnthropogenic effects on the subsurface thermal and groundwater environments in Osaka, Japan and Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaniguchi, Makoto; Shimada, Jun; Fukuda, Yoichi; Yamano, Makoto; Onodera, Shin-ichi; Kaneko, Shinji; Yoshikoshi, Akihisa\n\n2009-04-15\n\nAnthropogenic effects in both Osaka and Bangkok were evaluated to compare the relationships between subsurface environment and the development stage of both cities. Subsurface thermal anomalies due to heat island effects were found in both cities. The Surface Warming Index (SWI), the departure depth from the steady geothermal gradient, was used as an indicator of the heat island effect. SWI increases (deeper) with the magnitude of heat island effect and the elapsed time starting from the surface warming. Distributions of subsurface thermal anomalies due to the heat island effect agreed well with the distribution of changes in air temperature due to the same process, which is described by the distribution of population density in both Osaka and Bangkok. Different time lags between groundwater depression and subsidence in the two cities was found. This is attributed to differences in hydrogeologic characters, such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity. We find that differences in subsurface degradations in Osaka and Bangkok, including subsurface thermal anomalies, groundwater depression, and land subsidence, depends on the difference of the development stage of urbanization and hydrogeological characters.\n\nDesign of prospective study of acute coronary syndrome hospitalization after smoking ban in public places in Hyogo prefecture: comparison with Gifu, a prefecture without a public smoking ban.\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Yukihito; Minatoguchi, Shinya; Nishigaki, Kazuhiko; Hirata, Ken-ichi; Masuyama, Tohru; Furukawa, Yutaka; Uematsu, Masaaki; Yoshikawa, Junichi; Otsuji, Satoru; Iida, Mami; Fujiwara, Hisayoshi\n\n2014-02-01\n\nHyogo is the second prefecture, after Kanagawa, to enact a smoking ban in public places in Japan. The effect of this smoking ban on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has not been evaluated. Changes in the annual number of ACS hospital cases in Hyogo Prefecture, before and after the enactment of the prefectural legislative ban on smoking in public places, are to be compared with those in Gifu Prefecture, where there is no smoking-ban legislation. Consecutive Hyogo residents with ACS, admitted to 33 major hospitals in the Hanshin-Awaji-Kobe district, which covers 56% of the population, during the 12 months before implementation of the legislation (April 2012 through March 2013) and during the same 24 months thereafter (April 2013 through March 2015) will be enrolled. Consecutive patients with ACS, who are Gifu residents, treated at the 20 major hospitals in Gifu Prefecture will be enrolled as geographical controls. The primary endpoint is the change in number of ACS admissions from April 2012 through March 2015, considering the periods before and after the smoking-ban legislation in Hyogo prefecture. Our study has certain strengths: (1) This is the first large Japanese study of ACS registry with smoking-ban legislation. (2) Major hospitals in the Hanshin-Awaji-Kobe district are included. (3) The data will cover 3 years including 1 year before legislation enactment. (4) The data will be compared with those of Gifu Prefecture, where smoking-ban legislation will not be enacted. (5) The very large database makes possible analysis of subgroups based on age and gender. Copyright Â© 2013 Japanese College of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In former part of the paper, the features of house damage at 2007 Mid-Niigata prefecture offshore earthquake were analyzed for various influencing factors. The authors discussed the affrecting factors to houses at earthquake. In latter part, the features of house damage at 2007 Mid-Niigata prefecture offshore earthquake was discussed with that at 2004 Mid-Niigata prefecture earthquake. The house damage function of distance from the epicenter was proposed based on the analysis on house damage ratio recorded in two earthquakes.\n\nIncrease in incidental detection of thyroid cancer in Osaka, Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nToyoda, Yasuhiro; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Nakata, Kayo; Morishima, Toshitaka; Nakayama, Tomio; Miyashiro, Isao; Hojo, Shigeyuki; Yoshioka, Setsuko\n\n2018-05-22\n\nWe examined age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates of thyroid cancer according to the route of thyroid cancer detection from 1992-2012, using Osaka Cancer Registry data. The detection routes were categorized into 'symptomatic' and 'incidental detection'. Age-specific incidence rates of incidentally-detected thyroid cancer consistently increased during the study period, especially after 2001, for all sex and age groups other than childhood. The rate of symptomatic thyroid cancer did not largely differ. Age-adjusted incidence rates of symptomatic thyroid cancer were around 1.5 and 4.5 per 100,000 among men and women, respectively. The rate of incidentally-detected thyroid cancer increased from 0.1 and 0.1 per 100,000 person-years among men and women in 1992-1994 to 2.0 and 4.9, respectively in 2010-2012. Age-adjusted mortality rates among both sexes during study period leveled off. This finding suggests that the thyroid cancer incidence rate in Osaka increased with incidental detection. We need to continue careful monitoring to confirm these findings. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. This article is protected by copyright.

The study analysed prefectural income, the amount of national taxes collected, financial assistance from the national government to local governments, and age adjusted death rates and life expectancies of all of the prefectures in Japan during the period from 1965 through 1995. (1) Under the financial adjustment policy, financial assistance from the national government to the local governments, which consists of the sum of the local allocation tax and treasury disbursements, increased from 1831 billion yen in 1965 to 31 116 billion yen in 1995. (2) During the same period, the age adjusted death rate per 100 000 people decreased from 1168.9 (1965) to 545.3 (1995). The range of variation in the age adjusted death rate among prefectures diminished as the coefficient of variation of the death rate declined from 0.060 in 1965 to 0.043 in 1995. (3) There was a significant statistical correlation between higher prefectural incomes and lower mortality rates during from 1965 until 1975 (p < 0.05), whereas this correlation was indistinct in the 1980s and has not been observed since 1990. (4) The relative health level of Tokyo has declined in terms of its ranking among all the prefectures with regard to life expectancy, from being the best in 1965 to below average in 1995. The national financial adjustment policy to balance the revenues of local governments has increased the health levels of rural prefectures. It is probable that the policy reduced the disparity in death rates and life expectancies among prefectures throughout the country.

The present study describes an intensified surveillance (antimicrobial resistance and molecular typing) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in Kyoto and its neighboring prefecture Osaka, Japan, in 2010 to 2012, which was initiated after the identification of H041. From April 2010 to March 2012, 193 N. gonorrhoeae isolates were collected and the MICs (Î¼g/ml) to six antimicrobials, including ceftriaxone, were determined. All isolates showed susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime (MIC values, <0.5 Î¼g/ml), and spectinomycin. The rates of resistance (intermediate susceptibility) to azithromycin, penicillin G, and ciprofloxacin were 3.6% (19.7%), 24.4% (71.0%), and 78.2% (0.5%), respectively. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed that 40.9%, 19.2%, and 17.1% of isolates belonged to ST1901, ST7359, and ST7363, respectively. Furthermore, N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) revealed that 12 (63%) of the 19 isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC > 0.064 Î¼g/ml) were of ST1407. NG-MAST ST1407 was also the most prevalent ST (16.1%; 31 of 193 isolates). In those NG-MAST ST1407 strains, several mosaic type penA alleles were found, including SF-A type (penicillin binding protein 2 allele XXXIV) and its derivatives. These were confirmed using transformation of the penA mosaic alleles as critical determinants for enhanced cefixime and ceftriaxone MICs. The intensified surveillance in Kyoto and Osaka, Japan, did not identify any dissemination of the high-level ceftriaxone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae strain H041, suggesting that H041 might have caused only a sporadic case and has not spread further.

The predisaster situation regarding stockpiles was abstracted from a 2010 survey. Timing of electricity and water restoration and sufficiency of supplies to continue operations were investigated through materials from Miyagi Prefecture disaster medicine headquarters (prefectural medical headquarters) and disaster base hospitals (14 hospitals) in Miyagi Prefecture after the East Japan earthquake. The number of hospitals with less than 1 day of stockpiles in reserve before the disaster was 7 (50%) for electricity supplies, 8 (57.1%) for water, 6 (42.9%) for medical goods, and 6 (42.9%) for food. After the disaster, restoration of electricity and water did not occur until the second day or later at 8 of 13 (61.5%) hospitals, respectively. By the fourth postdisaster day, 14 hospitals had requested supplies from the prefectural medical headquarters: 9 (64.3%) for electricity supplies, 2 (14.3%) for water trucks, 9 (64.3%) for medical goods, and 6 (42.9%) for food. The lack of supplies needed to continue operations in disaster base hospitals following the disaster clearly indicated that current business continuity plans require revision.\n\n[A study on the 1946 smallpox epidemic in Japan and measures taken against it].\n\nPubMed\n\nTanaka, Seiji; Sugita, Satoru; Marui, Eiji\n\n2014-09-01\n\nIn early 1946, immediately after World War II, there was a smallpox epidemic in Japan. In this paper we investigated trends in the occurrence of smallpox by week and region using official documents of the General Headquarters, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (GHQ/SCAP), which are stored in the National Diet Library Modern Japanese Political History Materials Room, and summarized the measures taken against this epidemic. The following two points were clarified: 1) The 1946 smallpox epidemic peaked in Week 13 (March 24-30; 1,405 new patients), and the highest morbidity during this epidemic was seen in Hyogo Prefecture, followed by Osaka Prefecture, Aichi Prefecture, Tokyo Prefecture, and Hokkaido Prefecture. 2) Measures taken against this epidemic were classified into the following three stages: 1. \"Vaccine shortage/Manufacture acceleration stage,\" 2. \"Vaccine sufficiency/Smallpox vaccination program implementation stage,\" and 3. \"Detection of defects in vaccination technique/Reimplementation of the smallpox vaccination program stage\".\n\nReal Time Conference 2014 Overview\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNomachi, Masaharu\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThis article presents an overview of the 19th Real Time Conference held last May 26-30, 2014, at the Nara Prefectural New Public Hall, Nara, Japan, organized by the Research Center for Nuclear Physics of the Osaka University. The program included many invited talks and oral sessions offering an extensive overview on the following topics: real-time system architectures, intelligent signal processing, fast data transfer links and networks, trigger systems, data acquisition, processing-farms, control, monitoring and test systems, emerging real-time technologies, new standards, real-time safety and security, and some feedback on experiences. In parallel to the oral and poster presentations, industrial exhibits by companies, workshops and short courses also ran through the week.\n\nDistributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Osaka Bay, Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiki, Shizuho; Uno, Seiichi; Ito, Kazuki; Koyama, Jiro; Tanaka, Hiroyuki\n\n2014-08-30\n\nContaminations in sediments by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkylated PAHs were investigated at 44 sites in Osaka Bay, Japan. Concentrations of total PAHs and alkylated PAHs were in the range 6.40-7800 ng/g dry weights and 13.7-1700 ng/g dry weights, respectively. The PAH concentrations tended to be higher along the shoreline in the vicinities of big ports, industrialized areas, and densely populated regions such as the cities of Osaka and Kobe. The major sources appeared to be pyrogenic or both pyrogenic and petrogenic at most of the sites. PAH concentrations were remarkably high at a site near Kobe, where the concentrations of dibenzo(a,h)anthracene and benzo(g,h,i)perylene exceeded the effects-range-medium concentration and eight PAHs were above the corresponding effects-range-low concentrations. Those PAHs may have been derived from the great fire associated with the large earthquake in 1995. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparative research has given insights into the extent of similarities and differences in crime between America and Japan. The importance of these studies is the examination of whether Western-established criminological knowledge is applicable to non- Western societies like Japan. Unfortunately, comparative self-report studies involving Japan and investigating youth offending are scarce. The current study investigates risk factors and self-reports of violence from Osaka and Seattle male youths. The findings reveal that Japanese male youths self-report a higher prevalence of violence than Seattle male youths. Risk factors for violence, issues of comparability, and prevalence versus strength of relationships of risk factors are examined. It is concluded that the higher prevalence of violence in Osaka is primarily a function of the higher prevalence of troubled peers and risk taking. The findings call for replication of this type of comparative research.

We describe the epidemiology of EVD cases reported in Guinea's capital, Conakry, and 4 surrounding prefectures (Coyah, Dubreka, Forecariah, and Kindia), encompassing a full year of the epidemic. A total of 1,355 EVD cases, representing â40% of cases reported in Guinea, originated from these areas. Overall, Forecariah had the highest cumulative incidence (4Ã higher than that in Conakry). Case-fatality percentage ranged from 40% in Conakry to 60% in Kindia. Cumulative incidence was slightly higher among male than female residents, although incidences by prefecture and commune differed by sex. Over the course of the year, Conakry and neighboring prefectures became the EVD epicenter in Guinea.\n\n2014 Anthrax epidemic in Koubia prefecture, Guinea-Conakry.\n\nPubMed\n\nSow, M S; Boushab, M B; Balde, H; Camara, A; Sako, F B; TraorÃ©, F A; Diallo, M O S; Diallo, M D; Keita, M; Sylla, A O; Tounkara, T M; CissÃ©, M\n\n2016-11-01\n\nAnthrax disease is an anthropozoonosis caused by a Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. Our objective was to describe the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic features of the 2014 epidemic in Koubia prefecture. This retrospective study examined all of the anthrax cases reported in Fafaya, Koubia Prefecture. In March and April 2014, there were 39 cases of human anthrax reported, for an incidence of 1.135%. The mean age was 20.9 (Â± 18.3) with a sex ratio of 2.54 (28/11) in favor of men. Seventy-six percent (23/39) were single. More than one half were students (53.8%). The main clinical signs were fever in 71, 8% (n = 28 /), papules 59% (n = 23), vesicles of 59% (n = 23) Digestive and cutaneous signs represented 35.9 % and 64.1% respectively; 35% had ingested contaminated meat and 17.95% were in direct contact with a sick animal. We didn't find any correlation between the mode of infection and onset of signs. The fatality rate was 28.21%. The 2014 epidemic of anthrax disease in the Koubia prefecture was marked by a high incidence and lethality. Clinical manifestations were cutaneaous and digestive. These results may serve further interventions to fight against anthrax disease. They should mainly focus on an awareness of peasants, surveillance and vaccination of cattle.

This retrospective, population-based observational study conducted in Osaka Prefecture, Japan included adult patients with OHCA, aged â¥18 years who were transported to acute care hospitals between January 2005 and December 2012. We divided acute care hospitals into CCMCs or non-CCMCs, the latter of which were divided into the following three groups according to the annual average number of transported OHCA cases: low-volume (â¤10 cases), middle-volume (11-39 cases), and high-volume (â¥40 cases) groups. Random effects logistic regression models, with hospital treated as a random effect, were used to assess factors potentially associated with a favourable neurological outcome. A total of 44,474 patients were eligible. The proportions of favourable neurological outcome from OHCA were 0.9% (31/3559) in the low-volume group, 1.2% (106/9171) in the middle-volume group, 1.6% (222/14,007) in the high-volume group, and 4.3% (766/17,737) in the CCMC group (P<0.001). In the multivariable analysis, transport to CCMCs was significantly associated with favourable neurological outcome, compared with transport to non-CCMCs (adjusted odds ratio 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-1.66). Among the non-CCMC group, there was no significant relationship between hospital volume and favourable neurological outcome. In this population, transport of OHCA patients to CCMCs led to significantly higher one-month survival rates with favourable neurological outcome from OHCA, whereas no significant association was noted among the hospitals with different volumes.

However, no large-scale survey focusing on present implementation status and problems of physical assessment by community pharmacists has been conducted yet. Osaka has the 2nd highest number of community pharmacies in Japan now, and the population aged â¥65 years will be expected to become the 3rd highest in 2025. Thus, Osaka can become a national leading model case for community pharmacists' activity in future home medical care. Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the present implementation status and problems of physical assessment by community pharmacists in Osaka, especially focusing on vital-signs. The questionnaires were sent to all the 3571 insurance pharmacies belonging to the Osaka Pharmaceutical Association and 871 pharmacies responded. Many pharmacists recognized the necessity for vital-signs measurement by pharmacists in home medical care (81.5% of pharmacies that offered home medical care and 75.4% of pharmacies that did not offer one). However, the proportion of pharmacies that conduct vital-signs measurement in home medical care was 18.7%, therefore, it was suggested that the present problem is \"many pharmacists cannot conduct vital-signs measurement, although they think it should be conducted\". Moreover, the most common reason for not measuring vital-signs was the lack of instruments, such as stethoscopes and sphygmomanometer (43.2%). This is the latest report with a large-scale sample, thus, it can serve as valuable knowledge in considering what pharmacists do for the future.\n\nEpidemiology of Epidemic Ebola Virus Disease in Conakry and Surrounding Prefectures, Guinea, 2014â2015\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrody, Debra; Coronado, FÃ¡tima; Rondy, Marc; Fiebig, Lena; Carcelen, Andrea; Deyde, Varough M.; Mesfin, Samuel; Retzer, Kyla D.; Bilivogui, Pepe; Keita, Sakoba; Dahl, Benjamin A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn 2014, Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was first reported during March in 3 southeastern prefectures in Guinea; from there, the disease rapidly spread across West Africa. We describe the epidemiology of EVD cases reported in Guineaâs capital, Conakry, and 4 surrounding prefectures (Coyah, Dubreka, Forecariah, and Kindia), encompassing a full year of the epidemic. A total of 1,355 EVD cases, representing â40% of cases reported in Guinea, originated from these areas. Overall, Forecariah had the highest cumulative incidence (4Ã higher than that in Conakry). Case-fatality percentage ranged from 40% in Conakry to 60% in Kindia. Cumulative incidence was slightly higher among male than female residents, although incidences by prefecture and commune differed by sex. Over the course of the year, Conakry and neighboring prefectures became the EVD epicenter in Guinea.
