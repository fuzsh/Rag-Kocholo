        "text": "Alberto Kenya Fujimori Inomoto (Spanish pronunciation: [alˈβeɾto ˈkeɲɟʝa fuxiˈmoɾi inoˈmoto], Japanese: 藤森 謙也, Hepburn: Fujimori Kenya, Japanese pronunciation: [ɸɯʑiꜜmoɾi keꜜɰ̃ja]; born 28 July 1938) is a Peruvian former politician, professor, and engineer who served as President of Peru from 1990 to 2000. Fujimori, a Peruvian of Japanese descent, was an agricultural engineer and university rector before entering politics. Frequently described as a dictator,[4] his tenure is marked by both significant economic reforms and severe human rights abuses.\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternalsurname is Fujimori and the second or maternal family name is Inomoto.\n\nQuick Facts The Most Excellent, 54th President of Peru ...\n\nClose\n\nFujimori's tenure began with his unexpected victory in the 1990 general election. He quickly implemented neoliberal economic reforms to address hyperinflation and economic instability, which won him initial support from international financial institutions, the military and the Peruvian upper class. His administration soon became known for its authoritarian practices. In 1992, Fujimori carried out a self-coup, dissolving Congress and assuming extraordinary powers. Notably, his government was linked to forced sterilizations and the violent suppression of the Shining Path insurgency. Despite these controversies, many Peruvians view his leadership period favourably due to the perceived restoration of stability and economic growth. He was re-elected in 1995 and controversially again in 2000 amid allegations of electoral fraud."
