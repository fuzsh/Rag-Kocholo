        "text": "To his supporters, Alberto Fujimori was the president who saved Peru from the twin evils of terrorism and economic collapse. To his opponents, he was an authoritarian strongman who rode roughshod over the country's democratic institutions in order to preserve his hold on power.\n\nThe son of Japanese immigrants, Mr Fujimori's decade in power from 1990 to 2000 in which he ruled with an iron fist was marked by a series of dramatic twists and turns.\n\nHis authoritarian government's crackdown on two violent insurgencies during his tenure resulted in the deaths of an estimated 69,000 people.\n\nSeveral years after his presidency ended, Mr Fujimori was found guilty of bribery and abuse of power and was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights abuses during his time in office - including authorising a number of killings carried out by death squads.\n\nSentenced to 25 years in prison in 2009 at the age of 70, most Peruvians assumed the former leader would spend the rest of his life in jail.\n\nBut in December 2017, the 79-year-old was taken from prison to a hospital in the capital, Lima, because of health concerns; he was suffering from low blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nThat same month, Mr Fujimori was granted a pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski after doctors said his illness was incurable, adding that prison represented a \"grave risk to his life\".\n\nIn response, Mr Fujimori said he was \"deeply grateful\" and that while his leadership was well received by some, he recognised that he had \"let down others\", adding: \"Those I ask for forgiveness from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nHe also called for the country to unite against crime and violence. \"We'll be in a country in which security is regained and violence eliminated,\" he tweeted.\n\nOne of the key moments of his presidency was the hostage siege by Marxist rebels belonging to the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), which occurred at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima in 1996-97.\n\nAfter a four-month stand-off, commandos were sent in to take the building.\n\nAll 14 rebels were killed and nearly all the 72 hostages were rescued in an operation that at the time cemented Mr Fujimori's talking and acting tough.\n\nThe president's reputation was later tarnished by a bribery scandal involving former intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos, which led to him fleeing to his parents' native Japan in November 2000, where he lived for five years in self-imposed exile.\n\nIn an effort to resurrect his political career and launch a new bid for the presidency, he flew to Chile in November 2005, only to be arrested at the request of the Peruvian authorities.\n\nMr Fujimori then spent two years fighting to block his extradition to face a series of charges, a battle he lost in September 2007.\n\nHe was convicted and sentenced to six years in jail in December 2007 on charges of abuse of power, over the removal of sensitive video and audio tapes from Mr Montesinos's home.\n\nIn April 2009, judges found him guilty of authorising death-squad killings in two incidents known as La Cantuta and Barrios Altos, and the kidnapping of a journalist and a businessman.\n\nMr Fujimori repeatedly denied the charges, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIn 1995, Mr Fujimori stood for re-election and won an overwhelming victory. Most voters cited his victories over left-wing insurgents and hyperinflation as the reason for giving him their support.\n\nBut a growing number of Peruvians began to voice concern that the methods used against the insurgency were also being employed against the president's democratic opponents.\n\nHis critics accused him of using the intelligence service led by Mr Montesinos to intimidate and spy on rivals.\n\nThey said he exerted unfair control on the media and the judiciary, and used government resources to support his own campaigns.\n\nThis criticism increased when he announced he was to stand for an unprecedented third successive term.\n\nAlthough he won the May 2000 elections, amid further allegations of vote-rigging, the prized third term began the start of his downfall.\n\nAfter the Montesinos scandal broke, the opposition gained control of Congress for the first time in eight years and dismissed Mr Fujimori on grounds of \"moral incapacity\"."
