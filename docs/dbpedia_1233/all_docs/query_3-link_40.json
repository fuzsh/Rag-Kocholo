        "text": "I have not written or talked about the influence of Japanese names on Peruvian culture (Lima, this time). I have never heard a dissertation or read a publication about the Nikkei influence on Peruvian culture... I have been disconnected from the community and its literary production because I was focused on mine and, in addition, knowing and experiencing other things outside the human circle- culture in which I grew up psychologically and emotionally, before we went to Panama. That's why I found it interesting to think about that influence by typing, also out loud.\n\nLiving in Central America I did not have contact with any Latino, US or not, who had Japanese names. The influence was very strong due to the Panama Canal under American rule and the respective military bases in addition to the bilateral relations that it had – and has – with that country and, therefore, the names have to be as follows: John, Phil, Joseph , Kate, Lenny or Margareth that are mixed according to social stratum and cultural level with the usual Latin names such as José or Jóse, Carmen, María, Luz, etc. not to mention the strange names or surnames used as names: Kennedy, Clinton, Washington, etc. among indigenous people with native surnames and with clear influence from that marketing country by legacy.\n\nToday, those names adopted by the popular imagination of all countries must be more widespread than before, more common and more distorted, just as happens in Peru, where there are thousands of Nayelly, Dayahnna, Miljaus (Bart does not have a friend), Hulk, Yojanna, Yumayi, Einstein, Yazuri (the sound sounds like it comes from the Peruvian jungle), Bulma, Vegueta, Celin Dion (as names) and many others, some funnier – even humorous – than others, but names nonetheless, so much so that They motivate peculiar reports in our environment.\n\nSchool teachers, generally state schools, have it worse, as they must ask how to write each name or write them as they think, coloring in, even more so, misspellings based on common sounds. For the students, seeing this behavior reflected in their names, it will not be a surprise that they write a lot or everything according to the sound of the words (not how it is standardized) and with the letters to which they are accustomed, for example, B instead of V.\n\nThose, to which, without surprise, one could add a newborn named Volpone (from Ben Jonson's play) and a 2 or 3-year-old Buslaiyer (Toy Story), are as strange as finding a person with Peruvian native called Tenchi (with C) or Midori because her father liked the sound. There are plenty of Aquemi (with Q) and Sayuri without knowing what they mean and there are several Taqueshi and Mallumi in human settlements on the outskirts of Lima. The influence is notable and lasting in the human settlements Alberto Fujimori, Kenji Fujimori, Susana Higuchi and Satomi Kataoka - very apart from the political hubbub with racist overtones - because they were founded in \"good times\" where racism was not what dominated the media but a popular and political song that resonated deeply in the town, the one that referred to as “Chinese” to a Nikkei descendant… the mixture that we have in various Latin cultures is notorious, where everything that comes from afar is indifferent and everything that comes from afar is generalized. whatever is strange and foreign to one's customs (instead of being evaluated and constructively criticized).\n\nSuch is the transcendence of Japanese culture blended with Peruvian culture (110 years), that is, Peruvian Nikkei, that the sound influence reaches where not even a flyer of the activities carried out by the association that brings together our community has reached.\n\nMY DAD IS TO BLAME\n\n…a Kenji with whom I studied many years ago told me. He didn't know what his name means, he doesn't like it but everyone calls him that because it is different from the common names that almost all of us have in our respective regions. The others did like the name they did not have, but the one who had it did not, because he did not identify himself as he did not have Japanese customs or taste for that culture or its food.\n\nSo, appealing to differentiation, parents looked for different sounds regardless of cultural influence or even the way they are spelled correctly; Suffice it to mention that even common names are misspelled or transmuted in search of individuality and originality, giving a picturesque character to the population, plunging it into a painless debauchery of transforming our personalized labels.\n\nHaving a name different from the normal ones creates an emotional dilemma: I am or I am not, I belong or I don't, what I am (for the most existential), my name is accepted or not, etc., increasing the disorder, losing standardization and urging to do \" whatever you want” even with the names of the offspring, as a traditional evil.\n\nEven so, it is a human trait to expand the range of possibilities by going beyond what is stipulated, experimenting and learning from generational acts, which at the beginning are taken as error or ignorance but which, over time, become part of habitual doing and talking.\n\n© 2009 Victor Nishio Yasuoka"
