        "text": "\"The decision is mine,\" Kenji Fujimori said on Twitter. \"Only in the event that Keiko does not win the presidency, I will run in 2021.\"\n\nKenji Fujimori, 35, belongs to his sister's center-right party Fuerza Popular and was re-elected as a lawmaker in Peru's single-chamber Congress with more votes than any other candidate.\n\nPeruvian law bars family members of presidents from immediately succeeding them. Patriarch Alberto Fujimori is now serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses and corruption during his 1990-2000 government.\n\n\"In 2021, there will be no (presidential) candidate with the Fujimori surname,\" Keiko Fujimori said in a televised interview with the show Panorama on Sunday.\n\nKeiko Fujimori, a 40-year-old former congresswoman, won the biggest share of votes in the April 10 first-round presidential election but has been seen as tied or slightly behind centrist economist Pedro Pablo Kucyznski in a June 5 run-off, according to recent polls.\n\nShe is popular in poor and rural districts where her father is celebrated for building schools and cracking down on Shining Path guerrillas, although she faces stiff opposition from others who consider him a corrupt dictator.\n\nKucyznski has called on Peruvians to vote for him instead of Keiko Fujimori to avoid a \"dynasty\" in the Andean country, a major exporter of copper, gold and silver."
