        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nDespite the strong association of smoking with cardiovascular disease and adverse events, little is known about the impact of persistent smoking after a HF diagnosis on patient outcomes. In this review, we found that persistent smoking after HF diagnosis, compared with non-smoking (former or never smoking), increased the risk of adverse health outcomes. In particular, our main finding was that current smokers, who continued smoking after HF diagnosis, were more susceptible to mortality and readmissions than non-smokers.\n\nOur meta-analysis demonstrated that mortality was the most frequently examined variable out of the seven types of adverse health outcomes associated with smoking status. Furthermore, persistent smokers showed higher mortality than non-smokers. However, we could not verify whether the higher mortality among persistent smokers was primarily ascribable to the functional deterioration of the cardiovascular system or to other causes, given that most data used in the studies indicated ‘all-cause mortality’ as the cause of death. Specifically, chemical constituents of smoke have high oxidant and inflammatory power that can directly induce endothelial damage and potentiate inflammatory response28-30. Namely, cigarette smoking can promote atherosclerosis by its effects on lipid profile25,31. Moreover, according to one study32, nicotine along with carbon monoxide and oxidative stress induce fibrosis at different cardiac sites; thus, generating a structural remodeling that may favor cardiac arrhythmia. For these reasons, the damaged cardiovascular system induces myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction through smoking, thus aggravating HF symptoms21, which can result in death. Consequently, further studies are necessary to completely understand the exact mechanisms underlying the vascular damage induced by smoking. Such knowledge can help healthcare providers to educate active or heavy smokers after a HF diagnosis against smoking.\n\nIn previous studies, tobacco smoking was associated with higher risk of cognitive decline. These associations are thought to be caused mainly by smoking-related damage, which develops during cardiovascular and respiratory processes in the brain33,34. However, in a study in which cognitive function was reported depending on the smoking status, current smokers were found to have higher cognitive function than never smokers24. This may be explained by the fact that a cognitive function decline is associated not only with smoking but also with other factors, such as age, hemoglobin level, and body mass index35,36. These factors act as confounding variables, and there is a need to adjust for them. Moreover, only one of the studies analyzed in this systematic review examined the association between cognitive function and smoking status after HF diagnosis, and the validity of its findings will have to be verified by additional research. In one study that examined the length of stay in the hospital in relation to smoking status, persistent smokers and non-smokers showed similar lengths of stay22. This study noted that the sudden smoking cessation after hospitalization might have resulted in the improved health status. Although the average length of stay in the hospital reported in this study was 4 days, too short a period of smoking cessation to improve health. Taken together, HF patients who are smoking at diagnosis may benefit from counseling regarding the harms of continued smoking after a diagnosis of HF, as one way to improve quit rates. Secondhand smoke exposure is related to increased risk of CVD and ischemic heart disease37,38. Thus, smoke-free policies within hospitals can help persistent smokers to attempt to quit smoking.\n\nIn our review, of 70461 participants, 11252 (16%) from nine studies continued smoking after HF diagnosis. Similar percentages were found in previous studies for diseases associated with smoking: 14.1% of 1700 patients with CVD13; 17.6% of 5185 patients diagnosed with cancer39; and 17% of 893 patients with lung cancer40. Most of the patients diagnosed with HF undergo interventions designed to prevent the aggravation of HF. Such interventions include smoking cessation, low-salt diet, abstention from drinking, regular exercise, and management of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia41. The finding of this study showing that 16% of patients with HF failed to quit smoking highlights the need of customized health education for the patients by identifying the causes of persistent smoking and negative attitudes towards health-promoting behaviors."
