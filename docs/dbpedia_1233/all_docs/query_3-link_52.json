        "text": "THE BASIC REFERENCE WORKS 73 334. Nyonin geijutsu --, /4 f i (Women and art) A women's literary magazine. Monthly. Published from July, 1928, through May, 1932 by Nyonin Geijutsusha. Started by Hasegawa Shigure, then a senior woman writer, with the financial aid of her husband Mikami Otokichi. She wanted to make this magazine a vehicle through which the newer women writers might be introduced. In the magazine were published the reviews, creative works, and long poems written by such women as Yamakawa Kikue, Kamichika Ichiko, Chiujo (Miyamoto) Yuriko, and Hiratsuka Raich6. At the time Marxism was playing a prominent role on the Japanese scene, and this magazine was gradually influenced by leftist thought. But although it became a salon for left-wing women writers, it never developed into a full-fledged Marxist magazine, and it was presently discontinued. It is notable for the fact that it gave Hayashi Fumiko and Ueda (Enji) Fumiko their start as writers. Among the representative works are \"Horoki (An account of a wandering),\" by Miss Hayashi, and \"Banshun soya (A noisy night in late spring),\" by Mrs. Enji. 335. Osaka mainichi shimbun $. - j7 - ~] (The Osaka daily news) A newspaper which was started on November 20, 1888, when its predecessor, the Osaka nichidai <I k iLk (Osaka daily topics), was renamed. Becoming more and more prosperous, it bought the Toky6 nichinichi shimbun ~, g ' e f (The Toky6 daily news) in 1911. In 1943 it was joined with the T6kyo nichinichi and began to appear under the name Mainichi shimbun. 0 t ~ (Daily news). 336. Puroretaria bungaku 7~ ti L ', 7 O f (Proletarian literature) Organ of the Nihon Puroretaria Sakka D6mei 3; 7~ So $ ' 77 T F- $ 1|1 - (The Japanese Proletarian Writers' Union), also known as NAPF (Nappu) from the initials of its Esperanto name, Nippona Proleta Artista Federatio. Begun in January, 1932; suspended in November, 1933. Miyamoto Kenji, Miyamoto Yuriko, Fujimori Seikichi, Kurahara Korehito, Ueda Susumu, and others wrote articles on the methods to be followed in writing proletarian literature. Many of the articles took their materials from war and fascism or from the struggle against fascism in factories and villages. The magazine thus reflected NAPF's attitude in the period following the start of the fighting in Manchuria. Typical of the works published in Puroretaria bungaku were \"Haru ( The springtime),\" by Tateno Nobuyuki, and \"Shimura Natsue (Shimura Natsue [a woman's name ]),\" the drama by Murayama Tomoyoshi. Among those writing for the magazine were Tokunaga Sunao and Honj6 Rikuo, who also guided literary endeavor in factories and in villages. As the oppression of the authorities became severer, NAPF was weakened. Kuroshima Denji and others left the magazine in June, 1933, and published Bunka shudan (Cultural group). 337. Puroretaria bunka 70 ta L - 'I 77 C T4 (Proletarian culture) The organ of the Nihon Puroretaria Bunka Remmei e ~ 7 - v r 'I f y. I %- (more familiarly known as KOPF from the initials of its Esperanto name, Federatio de Proletaj Kultur-organizoy Japanaj), which was organized in 1931 as a successor to the Zen-Nihon Musansha Geijutsu Remmei /~ e f X f 4 'LT - I (All-Japan Proletarian Art Federation), also known as NAPF from the initials of its Esperanto name, Nippona Proleta Artista Federatio. KOPF embraced many spheres of activity in addition to literature, as, for instance, drama, art, sports, radio, education, and the teaching of Esperanto, but in May, 1934, it was obliged to dissolve itself under pressure from the authorities. Although short-lived it was able to cultivate the same fields formerly tended by Tane maku hito e 4 A/ (Planters of seeds) and by Nappu. Among the contributors were Miyamoto Kenji and Kobayashi Takiji, who had gone underground, Nakano Shigeharu, Tsuboi Shigeji, and Miyamoto Yuriko. In the combined issue of November and December, 1932, Miyamoto Kenji criticized Fujimori Seikichi's \"Kame no Charii (The turtle Charley),\" which had appeared in the September, 1932, issue of Kaiz6. Fujimori's reply came in Puroretaria bungaku (Proletarian literature), in the February, 1933, issue. Puroretaria bunka participated in many of the disputes prevalent among leftist writers. 338. Puroretaria geijutsu 7~ a 1 - (tI 7 t / (Proletarian art) After Kaji Wataru had advocated the use of literature for political means in his article entitled \"Iwayuru shakaishugi bungei o kokufuku-seyo (Vanquish the so-called socialistic literary art)\" in the May 5, 1927, issue of Musansha shimbun -. r X E (Proletarian news), two groups were formed inside the Nihon Puroretaria Geijutsu Remmei v f? a L, q 7 7p i ~A t (Japan Proletarian Art Federation). One wanted to make art a revolutionary weapon and use it in the arena of political struggle, whereas the other wanted to defend the special character of art even though it was not opposed to the combination of art with politics. The former view as advocated by Kaji, Nakano Shigeharu, Hisaita Eijir5, and others belonging to the Han-bungei-sensen-ha ik 4 1| f i K (School Opposing the Literary Battle-line), and the latter by Hayashi Fusao, Kurahara Korehito, and others who belonged to the Bungei sensen _ {.$.. (Literary Battle-line) group. The latter at last left the Nihon Puroretaria Geijutsu Remmei and formed the Rono Geijitsuka Remmei I 4 ~ I,-; L (Laborer and Farmer Artists' Federation). The former, on the other hand, started the journal Puroretaria geijutsu in July, 1927; however, they were unable to sell more than 3,000 copies of this magazine, that is, less than half the number of Bungei sensen. Nevertheless, Puroretaria geijutsu attracted widespread interest by printing the essays of Nakano Shigeharu and the story by Sata (Kubokawa) Ineko entitled \"Kyarameru k6j6 kara (From a caramel factory).\" Puroretaria geijutsu lasted till March, 1928, when its parent organization was merged into the Zen-Nihon Musansha Geijutsu Remmei t '- f (All-Japan Proletarian Art Federation). 0"
