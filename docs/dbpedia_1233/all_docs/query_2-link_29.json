        "text": "LA PAZ, Bolivia — Keiko Fujimori, a powerful Peruvian politician whose father ruled the country in the 1990s, was arrested in a money laundering investigation on Wednesday, calling into question the future of the political family and their right-wing populist movement.\n\nThe arrest came just days after the country’s Supreme Court ordered her father, former President Alberto Fujimori, back to prison on a human rights abuse conviction, overruling the presidential pardon that had freed him in December.\n\nMs. Fujimori was detained at the chief prosecutor’s office, where she had been called to testify in her own case, said her lawyer, Giuliana Loza, who called the arrest “arbitrary.”\n\nProsecutors have been investigating whether Ms. Fujimori, the opposition leader, accepted illegal campaign contributions during her 2011 and 2016 presidential campaigns.\n\nAbout 100 of her supporters gathered at the courthouse to protest her arrest.\n\nMs. Fujimori, who is considered a flight risk, will initially be held for at least 10 days while prosecutors consider filing formal charges.\n\nIn a letter that she posted on Twitter on Wednesday, she denounced her arrest as unfair. “Persecution is disguised as justice in our country,” she wrote.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
