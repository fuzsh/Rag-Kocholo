        "text": "Lima, 18 Mar Peruvian opposition leader Keiko Fujimori said Friday that her father, former President Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000), will remain in Peru once he is released thanks to the decision taken on Thursday by the Constitutional Court (TC) to reinstate the pardon granted to him in 2017 by then-president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (PPK). “He stays in Peru and we are going to pass all the exams here with the Peruvian doctors,” the three-time presidential candidate told the press, at the gates of the Barbadillo prison, in Lima's Ate district, where her father is serving a 25-year prison sentence for crimes against humanity. Keiko went to prison facilities to deliver food and medicine to Fujimori, 83, who was discharged on Monday after overcoming a heart condition that forced him to be admitted to a clinic in Lima. Regarding the state of health of her father, the eldest daughter of the former ruler stated that she is “stable”, although her condition is “fragile”. “My brothers and I are deciding that, once my father regains his freedom, the priority, as we have been saying for several weeks, is his health,” said who the day before crossed the TC's decision as “justice.” Asked about the barrage of criticism of the high court's ruling, Keiko acknowledged that her surname “generates controversy”, but she avoided speaking out on the concerns expressed in national and international spheres because, she said, “this is not the time to delve into differences” or the political crisis that Peru is going through. He merely said that opponents of the TC measure are “within their right” to appeal to international bodies, such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (Inter-American Court of Human Rights). The highest Peruvian constitutional body confirmed on Thursday that the deciding vote of its president, Augusto Ferrero, decided the nullity of the judicial decision that suspended the pardon granted to Fujimori in 2017, after the vote on the “habeas corpus” appeal that requested that measure was tied by three votes in favor and three against. Thus, the TC declared that an appeal brought by a lawyer from the department of Ica against the Supreme Court ruling that in 2018 rescinded the pardon granted to Fujimori on December 24, 2017 by Kuczynski (2016-2018). This pardon is being investigated by the courts, as the Prosecutor's Office considers that it was the product of a negotiation between Kuczynski and Fujimori's youngest son, Kenji, who was then a congressman, to have Fujimorist legislators vote against a request for the removal of the then-president. Fujimori was sentenced in 2009 to 25 years' imprisonment as a mediate author (dominated by the fact) of the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta massacres, committed in 1991 and 1992, respectively, by the covert military group Colina, as well as for the kidnappings of a businessman and a journalist following the 1992 coup d'état.
