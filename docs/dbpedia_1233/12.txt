Fujimori's tenure began with his unexpected victory in the 1990 general election. He quickly implemented neoliberal economic reforms to address hyperinflation and economic instability, which won him initial support from international financial institutions, the military and the Peruvian upper class. His administration soon became known for its authoritarian practices. In 1992, Fujimori carried out a self-coup, dissolving Congress and assuming extraordinary powers. Notably, his government was linked to forced sterilizations and the violent suppression of the Shining Path insurgency. Despite these controversies, many Peruvians view his leadership period favourably due to the perceived restoration of stability and economic growth. He was re-elected in 1995 and controversially again in 2000 amid allegations of electoral fraud.
