        "text": "Note: This story was originally published in the Spring 2023 issue of Rodziny. It is reprinted here with permission.\n\nFamily stories are what draw many of us into researching our family histories. Back in the late 1980s, when I first began asking my husband’s grandmother, Joan (Drajem) Barth, about the family history, she shared with me a story about her father-in-law, Joseph Bartoszewicz, who was badly burned and injured in a fire when he was a young man. She recalled that the fire was in a sugar factory in the Larkin Building on Seneca Street in Buffalo, New York, and that her father-in-law had been a foreman in the factory. She also recalled that her mother-in-law, Katherine (Levanduski) Bartoszewicz had a brother or brothers who may have been killed or injured in the fire. Grandma couldn’t tell me much more about the Levanduski brothers; this was the family of her deceased husband, Henry Bartoszewicz/Barth, and “people didn’t talk about those things back then.”\n\nMy curiosity was piqued, but my early attempts to research both the Levanduski family and the Bartoszewicz family, and learn more about that fire, were thwarted by the many versions of surnames and given names that were in use by the family. The original Polish form of the surname, Lewandowski, was ranked 6th for popularity among Polish surnames circa 1990,1 and the family favored phonetic versions of the surname, such as Levanduski, Levendeski, and Levandoski, in the U.S. Similarly, documents related to the Bartoszewicz family contain variant spellings such as Bartosiewicz, Bartusiewicz, and Bartoszewski. Although Grandma was very specific about the fire taking place “in the Larkin Building on Seneca Street” in Buffalo, I could find no evidence from newspaper articles that such a fire took place in the appropriate time period, which she guessed was the early 1920s. Stymied by these road blocks, it was easy to defer this research, and investigate other family lines instead.\n\nOver the years, as more documents and scanned newspapers became available online, I was able to gradually chip away at this puzzle, and uncover the tragic story of the Lewandowski family, and the disaster that was directly responsible for the loss of two lives—and was indirectly responsible for the loss of a third life. This, then, is their story.\n\nThe Lewandowski Family of Wola Czewujewska\n\nThe Lewandowski family originated in what is now the Poznań area of Poland, but was at that time the Posen province of Prussia. For the purpose of this story, we’ll exclude the family’s deeper origins, and begin with Stanisław Lewandowski and Marianna Woźniak, who married on 9 September 1882 in Rogowo (Żnin County).2 (Their marriage record was discussed in a previous post.) At the time of their marriage, Stanisław was a 22-year-old Knecht (farmhand or servant), living in Wola Czewujewska, and Marianna was a 19-year-old Knechtstochter (daughter of farmhands or servants), also living in Wola. Both were Roman Catholic. The Meyers Orts- und Verkehrs-lexikon des deutschen Reichs, which is a gazetteer of places located within the German Empire, identifies Wola as a Rittergut, or landed estate, which suggests that Stanisław and Marianna were employed in service at the manor.3\n\nFollowing their marriage, Stanisław and Marianna had two children, both born in Wola: Katarzyna (Catharina/Katherine), born 11 October 1883, and Jan (Johann/John), born 5 May 1885.4 On 10 April 1886, the Lewandowski family emigrated from Prussia, departing from the port of Hamburg, along with Marianna’s sister, Weronika Woźniak, and another relative, Michał Lewandowski.5 Further research is needed to determine precisely Michał’s relationship to Stanisław, but the fact that he was also from Wola, and was traveling with them, suggests that he was a relative, despite the popularity of the surname. Their departure manifest is shown in Figure 1.\n\nAccording to this manifest, Stanisław Lewandowsky [sic] was a 27-year-old laborer from Wolla, Prussia. His wife, recorded as Maria, was age 23, and their children, Kataryna [sic] and Jan, were ages three and one. All the information is consistent with expectations based on prior evidence.\n\nFrom Stanisław to Edward, and Patrick to Peter\n\nThe Lewandowski family settled in the hamlet of Shelby in rural Orleans County, New York, about 40 miles northeast of Buffalo. Although a Polish parish—Sacred Heart church in Medina— would eventually be founded in Orleans County, there was no ethnic Polish parish there when Stanisław and Marianna arrived with their family in 1886. Instead, the family belonged to St. Stephen’s parish in Middleport, New York, about six miles away, and this is where the birth of their next child was recorded in 1888 (Figure 2).6\n\nThis baptismal record testifies to the language barrier which the Lewandowski family encountered in rural Orleans County, which ultimately led to the adoption of the phonetic version of the surname, Levanduski, used by the family today. The record is written in Latin and states, “Junii 10. Baptizavi Patricium (per errorem Catherinam vocatum) natum 28 ult. ex Eduardo Levendeski et Maria Wisnaik. Sponsores Michael Wisnaik et Rosa Kotriss,” which translates, “I baptized Patrick (named Catherine by mistake), born on the 28th last [month], of Edward Levendeski and Maria Wisnaik. Sponsors [were] MIchael Wisnaik and Rosa Kotriss.” One wonders at the extent of communication difficulties that would lead the priest to baptize a child as Catherine, and then record the child’s name as Patrick, when this same child would ultimately be known as Peter in almost all historical records.\n\nThe fact that Stanisław was recorded as Edward here is also noteworthy. When I began my research, I had no idea that Edward was not the original name of Katherine Levanduski’s father, as my husband’s family was unaware of any name change. I only discovered this fact through correspondence with a distant cousin in Medina, Joe Levanduski, who found me back in 2007 through an Orleans County surname database hosted by New York GenWeb. Joe noticed that I was researching the Lewandowski/Levanduski surname and contacted me. He wrote, “I show Stanislaw Lewanduski….became a citizen in 1891, changing his name to Edward…. The story I got about the name change was great-grandfather worked in a quarry and they spelled his name wrong on his paycheck. He couldn’t get them to spell it right so it evolved to what it is today.”7 I’m ever grateful to Joe for tipping me off to that unexpected name change from Stanisław to Edward, since my efforts to obtain a passenger manifest and pursue research in Polish records had been unproductive prior to that point.\n\nIn 1891, Edward and Mary Levanduski’s fourth child, Joseph, was baptized at St. Stephen’s church (Figure 3).8\n\nThe record states, “Feb. 17. Baptizavi Josephum natum 15 inst. ex Eduardo Levendeski et Maria Wisnaik. Sponsores fuerunt Andreas Hoffman & Veronica Lipkoski,” which translates from Latin as, “Feb. 17. I baptized Joseph, born on the 15th of this [month] of Edward Levendeski and Maria Wisnaik. Sponsors were Andrew Hoffman and Veronica Lipkoski.” Joseph’s godmother, Veronica Lipkoski, was none other than his maternal aunt, Weronika Woźniak, who married Stanisław “Edward” Lipkoski (or Lepkoske) on 22 June 1889 in Middleport.9\n\nEdward Levanduski naturalized as a U.S. citizen on 14 September 1891 under the name Stanislaw Lewandowski in the Orleans County Court in Albion.10 His naturalization status was reflected in the 1892 New York State census, where he was recorded under the name “Adcker Lewenoboski,” shown in Figure 4.11\n\nThe family group described in this census record consists of 31-year-old Adcker Lewenoboski [sic], a laborer born in Poland and a naturalized citizen; his 29-year-old wife, Mary, 9-year-old daughter Catherine, and 7-year-old son, John, all of whom were also born in Poland and noted to be aliens. Additionally, the census identified the couple’s two U.S.-born children, 3-year-old Patrick and 1-year-old Joseph. Apart from the obvious miscommunication regarding the family surname and Edward’s given name, the names and ages of family members are all consistent with established evidence. Moreover, the family group listed immediately below the Lewandowski family is the family of Mary Levanduski’s sister, Veronica Lepkoske, who adopted the name Lena in the U.S.\n\nIn December of 1892, another daughter, Veronica, was born to Edward and Mary Levanduski.12 No death record has been found for her, but she was apparently deceased between March 1899 and 26 June 1900, when the census was enumerated.13 One more daughter, Anna Levanduski, was born in 1894.14 On 10 April 1896, Mary (Woźniak) Levanduski died of diffuse septic peritonitis at the age of 32, leaving Edward a 36-year-old widower and father of six children, with the oldest being 12 years of age and the youngest being not quite two years old.15 An expeditious second marriage was a necessity, and Edward’s bride was 29-year-old Antonina Budzińska, whom he married at St. Stephen’s in Middleport on 12 May 1896 (Figure 5).16\n\nAntonina, recorded occasionally as Antoinette, but most often called Anna, was born 5 January 1867 in Morhardsburg, known today as Morasy, to Jan/Johann and Katarzyna/Catharina (Łukomska) Budziński.17 Morasy is a mere 12 miles from Edward’s last residence in Poland, and it is likely that Edward and “Anna” were connected through the vast network of Prussian Poles who migrated to Western New York from Edward’s and Anna’s home counties of Żnin and Mogilno. Her marriage record to Edward states, “Tribus bannorum rite factis publicationibus conjunxi in matrimonio Edwardum filium Michaelis Levendeski et Elizabeth Rotka et Antoniam filiam Joannis Budinski et Catharinae Lukomski. Testes Laurentius Hoffman et Veronica Lepkoski fuerunt. (B) Jacobus J. Roche,” which translates, “After the publication of three banns, I joined in marriage Edward, son of Michael Levendeski and Elizabeth Rotka, and Antonia, daughter of Joannes Budinski [sic] and Catharina Lukomski. Witnesses were Laurence Hoffman and Veronica Lepkoski.”\n\nChildren came quickly for Edward and Anna. Anthony was born first, in 1897, followed by Ladislaus/Walter in 1898 and Martha in 1899.18 By 1900, when the family was enumerated in the census, the oldest three children—Katherine, John, and Patrick/Peter—are not listed with the rest of the family (Figures 6a and b).19\n\nHowever, the census tells us that in 1900, Edward Lavendusky [sic] was employed as a quarry laborer. He owned his home (with a mortgage), and he could speak English, although he could not read or write. His naturalization status, date of arrival, length of marriage, age, and place of birth are all consistent with prior evidence. His wife, Anna, was a more recent immigrant, having arrived in the U.S. circa 1893, according to this record. The children were identified as 10-year-old Joe, born February 1890; 6-year-old Anna, born June 1894; 3-year-old Tony, born May 1897; 1-year-old Wallace, born August 1898, and 10-month-old Martha, born July 1899. Once again, all the data are approximately consistent with prior evidence, although Walter was recorded as Wallace. This is not surprising in light of the fact that his baptismal name was Ladislaus, which is the Latin form of the Polish name Władysław, a name which has no direct English translation. Men with this name often adopted the name Walter, but there were no hard-and-fast rules for this, as evidenced by Walter’s father’s choice to go from Stanisław to Edward rather than adopting the name Stanley, which was a more popular choice among men named Stanisław.\n\nIt’s not certain why the oldest three children were not mentioned here, but neither are there any definitive matches for Katherine, John, and Peter Levenduski anywhere else in the 1900 census. A miscommunication seems most likely; if the older children were away from the house when the census-taker came by, perhaps they were simply missed in the tally. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that all the children were still living at home in 1905 (Figure 7).20\n\nBy 1905, 22-year-old Katie and 21-year-old John were both employed as servants. Peter, age 17, and his 15-year-old brother, Joseph, were employed as day laborers, like their father. Anna, Anthony, and Walter were at school. Little Martha Levanduski, whose brief life was captured in the 1900 census, enumerated in June, died in August of that year.21 By 1905, the family had come to include two new members, as well: Mary Levanduski, born in 1901, and Josephine, born in 1903.22 The Levanduski family was now complete.\n\nOn 29 April 1907, Katherine Levanduski wed Joseph Bartoszewicz at St. Stephen’s parish in Middleport (Figure 8).23 Joseph was the son of Stephan/Stefan Bartoszewicz and Joanna Olszewska, and like Katherine, he was born in the Prussian partition of Poland and came to the U.S. as a small child.24 As evidenced by their marriage record, Joseph was a resident of Buffalo in 1907. The witnesses to the marriage were Joseph’s sister, Anna Bartoszewicz, and Katherine’s brother, John Levanduski. On 15 December 1907, Katherine Bartoszewicz gave birth to the couple’s first child, a daughter whom they named Anna.25\n\nThe Buffalo Cereal Company\n\nBy 1909, the family was living at 23 Townsend Street in Buffalo, and Joseph was employed as a foreman at the Buffalo Cereal Company plant, located at the intersection of Elk Street and Abbott Road, about two miles from his home (Figure 9).26\n\nThe Buffalo Cereal Company was established in 1901, and the plant was completed in 1902. According to A History of Buffalo: Its Men and Institutions: Biographical Sketches of Leading Citizens, published in 1908,\n\n“The plant consists of two groups of buildings, conveniently arranged and divided into eight sections, consisting of elevator, cereal mill, feed mill, drying and cleaning house, transformer house, and three warehouses. The buildings occupy a space of about seventy-five by three hundred and ninety feet, and are substantially built of brick and stone, with the exception of the elevator, which is of the usual crib construction and covered with corrugated iron. The plant is operated by electrical power from Niagara Falls, of which it has an installation of about seven hundred horsepower.\n\nThe elevator is equipped with the latest machinery for handling grain, and has an excellent system of dust collecting, which makes this part of the plant remarkably clean. …\n\nThe cleaning and drying house is a six-story fireproof building, constructed entirely of brick and steel, with the exception that the floors and bin work are constructed of reinforced concrete. One end of this building contains two large Hess driers, which have a capacity of several thousand bushels of corn and oats per day. These driers are operated by separate motors, and the drying is done entirely by steam, the operation thus being made practically free from all danger of fire. …\n\nThe company has shown steady growth since its organization, the milling plant alone giving employment to over one hundred men.”27\n\nThe emphasis on both the cleanliness of the plant, and its sturdy, fireproof construction, was probably intended to reassure readers regarding its safety and modernity in an era when flour mill explosions were regularly reported in the newspapers. A quick search for “flour mill explosion” or “grain mill explosion” in Newspapers or in the free digital newspaper archive, Old Fulton New York Postcards, suggests that the explosive nature of flour dust was recognized as early as the 1870s, and this problem continue to be an industrial concern even today. While most of us don’t think of flour as particularly hazardous—and in typical home settings, it’s not—flour dust is highly combustible. In order for flour dust to explode, certain conditions must be met: the flour must be finely dispersed in the air, in a confined space, and in the presence of an ignition source—such as a spark caused by static electricity.28 These conditions are all found in grain mills, and they all combined to create the explosion that caused the deaths of Joseph and John Levanduski, and seriously injured Joseph Bartoszewicz.\n\nFrom Bartoszewicz to Bartek and Levanduski to Lendes\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, my early attempts to document this family tragedy were hampered by a lack of factual evidence. As with most family stories, Grandma’s account of the “fire in the sugar factory in the Larkin Building” contained a kernel of truth, but the devil is in the details. Buffalo had a number of grain mills back in the day, and without knowing the exact location or time period of the event, it was difficult to discover more information. Moreover, I was searching newspapers for the family surnames as they were usually encountered: phonetic variants of Bartoszewicz and Levanduski. What finally gave me my breakthrough, however, was a short entry in my research notes, where I recorded a comment from Grandma that Katherine Bartoszewicz used the name Bartek informally, circa 1930. This fact was confirmed by the 1909 Buffalo City Directory, in which Joseph Bartoszewicz appears twice, under the name Bartoszewicz, and also under the name Bartek (Figures 10a and b).29 In both entries, he was listed as a foreman, living at 23 Townsend Street.\n\nWhen I repeated my newspaper searches using this surname, at long last, I was able to locate articles about the fire at the Buffalo Cereal Company plant in 1910. And the Levanduski brothers? They were using the name Lendes! Figure 11 shows one of many newspaper headlines regarding the disaster.30\n\nThe Explosion\n\nOn the evening of 4 January 1910, with 30 men at work in the plant, the yellow corn mill of the Buffalo Cereal Company exploded into flames. The explosion was believed to have been caused by dust accumulations that were ignited by sparks from a dynamo. Eleven men were in the yellow corn mill where the explosion occurred, and the rest were in the white corn mill, the 8-story grain elevator, and the warehouse. The group of eleven men included Joseph Bartek, foreman of the night crew, and Joseph Lendes. Joseph Lendes had been sent to the top of an 85-foot tower to keep clear the mouth of the grain spout while his brother-in-law, Joseph Bartek, worked below with the other men.\n\nThe explosion completely destroyed the grain elevator and the yellow corn mill. Four men were reported to have died in the explosion and the resulting three-alarm fire, identified as Joseph Lendes, Frank Gloecki [sic], Fred Laney, and Louis Krennan. Of Joseph Lendes, the article states, “nothing could be found. The little platform on which he had stood at the time the explosion occurred was wrecked, and the roof was completely torn away. That the man escaped with his life seems improbable.” Nine more men were injured, including John Landers [sic] of 23 Townsend Street, Joseph Bartek, Chris Schultz, John Shea, George Seligman, Fred Tryon, John H. Willis, Paul Fisher, and John Gorski. John Landers was reported to be a bag sewer, who suffered “face, hands, and body burns” and was sent to Emergency Hospital, “recovery doubtful.” (The former Emergency Hospital is presently known as Sheehan Memorial Hospital.30) The article continued to report that of all the injured, John Landers was burned the worst. Joseph Bartek, the night foreman, was also sent to Emergency Hospital and was reported to be seriously burned, but “may recover.” The men who had been working in the other areas of the plant were reported to have fought their way through the smoke and flames to drag the injured men to safety.\n\nThe Buffalo Evening News published the story of the explosion at noon, 3 pm, and 5 pm on January 5. By the time the 5 pm edition was published, the story had been updated to include photos of some of the victims, including Joseph “Bartek” Bartoszewicz and John “Lendes” Levanduski (Figure 12). These were the only photos of Joseph Bartoszewicz and John Levanduski which my husband’s family had ever seen.\n\nThe Buffalo Courier reported on the same disaster, but in their article, John Landers was called John Lendes and Joseph Bartek was called Joseph Bortek.32 The Courier specified the relationship between John and Joseph, stating, “Joseph Landes, a brother of John, who is at Emergency Hospital, is another of the missing. John Landes said that his brother was working only a few feet away from him and he could not understand how they became separated even in the confusion following the explosion.” Interestingly, the Courier‘s report omits any mention of Frank Gloecki or Glodecki among the missing and presumed dead. The article further reported that some of the injured were initially taken to Crotty’s saloon at 82 Abbott Road, where the ambulances were summoned by Crotty, and, “When John Lendes was being carried to the ambulance from the saloon he became half crazed with pain and broke away from the attendants. He ran for half a block before he was captured by the doctors and then had to be overpowered before he could be taken to the hospital.”\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed, the Levanduski family’s personal tragedy continued to unfold in the newspapers. On January 6, the Buffalo Commercial reported that Fred Laney, initially thought to have been killed in the explosion, was found alive, but that Joseph Lendes and Frank Glodecki remained unaccounted for. The frozen ruins were being searched for their bodies, but fire engines were “still pumping water on the smoldering mounds of grain.”33 According to the Commercial, Joseph Bartek and Chris Schultz were still in the Emergency Hospital but were recovering, while John Lendes and the others were still in serious condition. On January 10, the Buffalo Times reported that John Lendes died of his injuries.34 The article erroneously reports John’s age as 44, rather than 24, and similarly misstates Joseph’s age as 38, rather than 18. Despite this discrepancy, the article states that both of them lived “at the home of their sister, Mrs. Joseph Bartek, at No. 23 Townsend Street,” and continues, “Bartek, who was foreman at the elevator, was among those who received injuries at the fire and is now at the Emergency Hospital. Owing to his condition he was not informed this morning of the death of his brother-in-law in the same ward of the hospital in which he is lying.” John Levanduski was reported to be the fifth fatality from the explosion, with the other victims identified as Oscar Lawn [sic], Frank Gloeck, and Frank Zydell, and Joseph Lendes.\n\nBy January 11, Christopher Schultz had died, and Joseph Bartek had taken a turn for the worse (Figure 13).35 Both men had been initially considered to be doing well and likely to recover. By the 13th, grim headlines suggested that Joseph Bartek might not recover (Figure 14).36\n\nOn January 15, the Buffalo Evening News reported that the body of Joseph “Lendes” Levanduski was recovered from the ruins (Figure 15).37 The article noted that Mrs. Joseph Bartek, sister of the deceased, “was called away from the bedside of her husband at the Emergency Hospital to identify the body of her brother.” By January 30, Joseph Bartek was still reported to be in the hospital, and the body of Oscar Lonn (or Lawn) was discovered.38 Incredibly, Frank Gloecki, who was initially identified as a victim of the explosion, was found to be alive, having never been at work on the night of the fire. As the article states, “Detective Jerry Condon of the Louisiana Street [Police] station, went to Gloecki’s home at No. 45 Roberts Street yesterday afternoon and found him leisurely sitting down, smoking a pipe and oblivious to all the harrowing tales that had been printed concerning his death.”\n\nEventually, Joseph Bartoszewicz was able to recover from that fire to the extent that he was able to return to full-time employment. However, the physical and psychological trauma of this fire left scars that remained with him until his dying day. His story remains to be told at another time.\n\nLendes, Lewandowski, and Levanduski, Revisited\n\nAlthough all the details of the tragedy at the Buffalo Cereal Company plant on the night of 4 January 1910 lined up well with that kernel of truth in Grandma’s story, I nevertheless obtained copies the death certificates for both John and Joseph Lendes. Joseph’s death certificate is shown in Figure 17.39\n\nThe death certificate corrects the error reported in the newspaper that Joseph was 38 years old, and identifies him as the 19-year-old son of Stanislaus Lendes and Mary Wozniak, both born in Germany. (Joseph was only 18 in January 1910, but would turn 19 in May.) His date and place of birth, 16 May 1891 in Middleport, New York, agree with prior evidence. Joseph was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, located in Lackawanna, New York, on 16 January 1910.\n\nJohn’s death certificate is shows in Figure 18.40\n\nDespite having been identified in the newspapers as John Lendes, John’s death certificate gave him back his original surname, John Lewandowski. His sister, Katherine Bartoszewicz of 23 Townsend Street was the informant, and she identified their parents as Stanislaus Lewandowski and Mary Wozniak. As with the death certificate for his brother, Joseph, the document corrects John’s age as it was erroneously reported in the newspaper, from 44 years to 24 years, 8 months, and 4 days. He was reported to have been born 6 May 1885 in Germany, consistent with prior evidence, and he was buried in St. Stanislaus Cemetery. His cause of death was “burns, accidental,” as a result of having been “caught in burning building.” Interestingly, John was reported to have been a resident of Buffalo for only one year, while Joseph had been a resident for four years. It may be that the information regarding Joseph’s residency is incorrect, since Katherine Bartoszewicz herself had likely only been a resident of Buffalo for the three years since her marriage in 1907.\n\nJohn Levanduski’s death was also reported in the local Polish newspaper, the Polak w Ameryce (Figure 19).41\n\nThe death notice reads in translation,\n\n“On Monday, the 10th day of January in the year 1910 at 7:10 in the morning, departed this world after short and heavy suffering, after having received the Sacraments, of holy memory,\n\nJan Lewandowski\n\nThe late Jan Lewandowski was born on 6 May 1885 in the Grand Duchy of Poznań. He came to America in 1885, 24 years ago.\n\nThe funeral will be held on Wednesday, 12 January, at 9:45 a.m. from the home of the bereaved at 23 Townsend St. to the church of St. Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr, and afterwards to the place of eternal rest. To this sad rite the bereaved are invited.\n\nStanisław Lewandowski, father, Katarzyna and Anna, sisters, Piotr, brother, and Józef Bartoszewicz, brother-in-law.”\n\nThe information on the death notice agrees with all the previous evidence for John Levanduski’s place and date of birth, arrival in the U.S., and the names of his surviving father and full siblings. The death notice was obtained courtesy of the Polish Genealogical Society of New York State, following a search of their databases. The PGSNYS also offers this guide for translation of these death notices.\n\nEvery family has its share of loss, sorrow, and tragedy, and the Levanduski family was certainly no exception. Unfortunately, the family stories that draw us into genealogical research don’t always have happy endings, but the tragic stories are no less worthy of being told. Although John and Joseph Levanduski left no descendants to remember them and to say their names, their story was preserved in the paper trail of newspapers and documents. With a little persistence, that story has come to light. Rest in peace, John and Joseph Levanduski.\n\n© Julie Roberts Szczepankiewicz 2022\n\nSources:\n\n1 “Najpopularniejsze nazwiska w Polsce” [Most popular surnames in Poland], Internet Archive, Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/web/20080518171439/http://www.futrega.org/etc/nazwiska.html : 04 March 2022), citing site capture from 18 May 2008, citing original data from the Słownik Nazwisk współcześnie w Polsce używanych [Dictionary of Polish Surnames in Modern Usage] found at http://herby.com.pl/.\n\n2 “Urząd Stanu Cywilnego Rogowo-Wieś, 1874-1913,” (Rogowo, Żnin, Kujawsko-Pomorskie, Poland), Akta małżeństw, 1882, no. 38, Stanislaus Lewandowski and Marianna Wozniak, 9 September 1882; digital image, Genealogiawarchiwach (https://www.genealogiawarchiwach.pl/ : 04 March 2022), images 39 and 40 of 68, citing Archiwum Państwowe w Bydgoszczy Oddział w Inowrocławiu, Sygnatura 7/540/0/2.2/26.\n\n3 “Wola 1)” [Wola, Znin, Bromberg, Posen, Preussen], Search the Meyers Gazetteer (https://www.meyersgaz.org/ : 04 March 2022), citing Uetrecht, E.

As previously noted, Antoni Szyfrynowicz was an individual whose name was recorded with a number of variant spellings, and who was documented in historical records spanning an area of more than 4,000 square kilometers. Is it possible, then, that there was more than one Antoni Szyfrynowicz? Since genealogical research is all about resolving questions of kinship and identity, how do I know that all of the records I’ve found are for the same Antoni?\n\nAntoni and Anna (Naciążęk) Szyfrynowicz: Digging Deeper with “Alternate Facts”\n\nBy and large, I think the evidence pretty consistently describes the same individual, although there are a few conflicts within the data set that need to be resolved. Let’s take a closer look at what we know about Antoni Szyfrynowicz, and discuss a bit of methodology along the way.\n\nMy favorite method for keeping track of evidence for individuals in my family tree is the use of “alternate facts.” Different software platforms offer different methods for viewing alternate facts within your tree. If you keep your tree on Ancestry, you can enable this feature by selecting the profile of an individual in your tree, and then, in the “Facts” view, selecting “Filter” and ticking the boxes for “Name and Gender” and “Alternate Facts” as shown in Figure 1. When these “Name and Gender” alternate facts are enabled, it’s possible to view the different spellings found for Antoni’s surname and the sources attached to each.\n\nI’m a Family Tree Maker (FTM) fan, and I especially like FTM’s display of this same information in a way that’s more visually compact, via the “Person” view for Antoni Szyfrynowicz (Figure 2). Note that FTM synchronizes with Ancestry, so updates to my FTM tree offline can be synced to my online tree, and vice versa. (Please note that I’m not affiliated in any way with FTM or its producer, Software MacKiev, I just like this product.)\n\nThe key utility in both of these applications is the ability to add “alternate facts,” in addition to a designated “preferred fact,” and to attach source citations to each. By doing so, you’re able to visualize those preponderances of evidence as they develop, and you can adapt your “preferred facts” accordingly. It was through this method that I was able to decide that the preferred version of my great-great-grandmother’s maiden name shouldn’t really be Maciążek, as was recorded on my great-grandfather’s marriage record, but rather Naciążek.\n\nIn order for this system to work, it’s necessary to extract every fact from each historical source discovered in the research, and attach it to the relevant person in the tree. As an example, the death record for Antoni Szyfrynowicz is shown in Figure 3.1\n\nThe record states,\n\n“14.\n\nOsiny.\n\nDziało się we wsi Dmosinie dnia dziesiątego Lutego, Tysiąc Ośmset Sześćdziesiątego Drugiego Roku, o godzinie drugiej w wieczór. Stawili się Jan Janaszek, parobek we wsi Osinowie zamieszkały lat dwadzieścia ośm, i Kazimierz Latka, służący Kościoła z wsi Dmosina, lat trzydzieści ośm mający, i oświadczyli: że w dniu dzisiejszym o godzinie ósmej rano umarł Antoni Szyfrynowicz, bedarz [sic] we wsi Osinach zamieszkały, urodzony we wsi Kamionie lat sześćdziesiąt ośm mający, syn Józefa i Maryjanny z Ziółkowskich, małżonków Szyfrynowiczów mularzy zmarłych. Zostawiwszy po sobie owdowiałą żonę Annę z Naciążków. Po Przekonaniu się naocznie o zejściu Antoniego Szyfrynowicza, Akt ten stawającym pisać nie umiejącym przyczytany, przez Nas tylko podpisany został. [Signed] Xiądz Franciszek Kostecki, Kommen[darz] Parafii Dmosińskiej, Utrzymujący Akta Stanu Cywilnego”\n\nIn translation,\n\nNo. 14. Osiny.\n\nThis happened in the village of Dmosin on the tenth day of February in the year one thousand eight hundred sixty-two, at two o’clock in the evening. Jan Janaszek, a farmhand residing in the village of Osiny, having twenty-eight years of age, and Kazimierz Latka, a church servant of the village of Dmosin, having thirty-eight years, appeared and declared: that on this day, at eight o’clock in the morning, Antoni Szyfrynowicz died, a cooper residing in the village of Osiny, born in the village of Kamion, age sixty-eight, son of the spouses Józef and Marianna née Ziółkowskich, deceased masons. He leaves after himself his widowed wife, Anna née Naciążek. After visual confirmation of the death of Antoni Szyfrzynowicz, this Act was read to those present, who are unable to write, and was signed only by us. [signed] Fr. Franciszek Kostecki, Pastor of the parish of Dmosin, Performing the Duties of Civil Registrar\n\nBased on this translation, this record can serve as a source for Antoni Szyfrynowicz’s\n\nname,\n\noccupation in 1862,\n\ndate of death,\n\nresidence in 1862,\n\nyear of birth,\n\nfather’s name,\n\nfather’s occupation,\n\nmother’s name, and\n\nwife’s name\n\n—at minimum. The record does not explicitly state that the burial took place on the date of the record, but some researchers infer that. It also sometimes happens that the witnesses were relatives, and when that is the case, the same record can also serve as evidence for their names, years of birth, places of residence, and occupations. So, once I’ve created a source citation for this death record, I can attach it to at least nine different facts, and four people, in my family tree. The same process is applied to every other historical document I discover for my family and attach to my tree. If you build your tree using documents found online through Ancestry’s subscription databases, Ancestry will walk you through this process to a certain extent. However, it’s just as important to create and attach source citations to facts in the tree for documents found elsewhere.\n\nIt takes some discipline to commit to crafting a unique citation for each source in your tree, but the benefits to doing that are huge. In fact, the most important piece of advice I would give to any budding genealogist is to cite sources thoroughly and consistently, for every piece of information you add to your family tree. While I I don’t consider myself an expert in writing source citations, I do my best to adhere to the principles and examples found in Elizabeth Shown Mills’ book, Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace. To make things easier, FTM offers a source citation generator that roughly follows Mills’ structure, and the citations can be further refined manually. Whether or not my source citations are entirely perfect, I think (hope) they serve the purpose of allowing other researchers to understand where I found a particular piece of evidence: what source document, and where that source document can be located, whether online or offline, so that my research is reproducible. Better still, going forward, I will never again have to wonder where I found a certain bit of information. (As for the information added to my tree when I was a baby genealogist, going back and adding proper source citations is a work in progress.)\n\nWhen all the evidence for Antoni Szyfrynowicz is tallied in this fashion, here’s what we know:\n\nDate of birth\n\nAntoni Szyfrynowicz was born between 1793 2 and 1803,3 but most probably between 1794 and 1795, based on the fact that five of 11 independent sources point to a birth circa 1794–1795.1,4,5,6,7 Although an 11-year range in estimated date of birth based on age reported in vital records may seem a little broad to some researchers, it’s not uncomfortably so, in my mind. His death record states that he was born in Kamion, which is ambiguous, since there are multiple places in Poland by that name. However, the fact that he was married circa 1822 to Anna Naciążek, who was born in Giżyce,8 suggests that he was born in the village of Kamion located 16.5 km/10 miles northeast of Giżyce.\n\nOccupation\n\nDespite the fact that Antoni was noted to be residing in a dozen different villages between 1823 and 1862, he was almost always recorded as a bednarz (cooper). Only two records mention another occupation: the birth record of his daughter, Marianna Szyfrynowicz, who was born in Kiernozia in 1836,9 and the marriage record of that same daughter, Marianna, from Oparów in 1855.10 In both of those records, Antoni was noted to be a szynkarz (innkeeper). That same marriage record presents another conflict in the evidence: it describes Marianna as, “Córka Antoniego już zmarłego i Anny z Naciążków Małżonków Szyfrynowicz, szynkarzy, urodzoną w Kiernozi parafii także (?) a zamieszkałą w Oporowie w służbie we Dworze zostająca lat dziewiętnaście mający.” In translation, “Daughter of Antoni, already deceased, and Anna née Naciążek, the spouses Szyfrynowicz, innkeepers, born in Kiernozia, parish likewise, and residing in Oporów in service at the manor, having nineteen years of age.”\n\nThat’s a bit more problematic. In this record, not only was Antoni recorded with a different occupation, but he was also reported to be already deceased, in contrast to the death record shown in Figure 3 which indicates that Antoni Szyfrynowicz, a cooper, died in 1862 at the age of 68. This does seem to suggest that there were two different men named Antoni Szyfrynowicz, both born around the same time, one a cooper who died in 1862, and one an innkeeper who died before 1855. But here’s why I don’t think that’s the case:\n\nWife’s Name\n\nAntoni’s wife was recorded as Anna in all 17 documents discovered to date, nine of which specify a maiden name of Naciązek, and four of which indicate a reasonable misspelling thereof. Two more don’t identify her maiden name at all. The only real outlier is the death record for Józefa “Szufrynowicz” from Bielawy, which identifies her mother as Anna Strzelecka, which we’ll get to in a moment.11 Both of these surnames, Naciążek and Szyfrynowicz, are relatively rare. Naciążek is so rare, that there are only 150 instances of this exact surname found in the Geneteka database, which currently contains nearly 48 million indexed entries. Of those 150 instances, all of the indexed entries from the Łódź province are related to this family, and many (or most) of the entries from the Mazowieckie province are related as well. While it’s a little more difficult to estimate the popularity of the Szyfrynowicz surname due to the large number of variant spellings, a search on just that spelling indicates only seven entries in Geneteka, all of which pertain to this family. What are the odds that there were two different men named Antoni Szyfrynowicz, living concurrently in the same general part of Poland, both of whom were married to women named Anna Naciążek?\n\nNegative Evidence\n\nIf we suppose that there were two different men named Antoni Szyfrynowicz, one of whom died before 1855 and was the father of Marianna, we might expect to find a corresponding death record. Extensive searching in Geneteka did not produce any promising matches, although the possibility remains that such a record exists in an unindexed parish. Similarly, if there were another Antoni who was married to Anna Strzelecka, we might expect to find a record of that marriage somewhere, or a death record for Anna (Strzelecka) Szyfrynowicz. Extensive searching in Geneteka did not produce any likely matches for those records, either. It’s also important to consider that the two occupations, innkeeper and cooper, are not mutually exclusive. It may be that Antoni was, at different times in his life, both an innkeeper and a cooper.\n\nAt this point, I think the data are reasonably consistent, pointing to the existence of only one Antoni Szyfrynowicz, who was an itinerant cooper from the Łowicz area, who sometimes kept an inn; who was married to Anna Naciążek, and who died in 1862, but apparently skipped out on the wedding of his daughter, Marianna, in 1855, and was misrecorded as being deceased. These conclusions are nonetheless preliminary and speculative, and some of them might be disproved with further research. This is why the Genealogical Proof Standard requires “reasonably exhaustive research” as its first requirement. Additional evidence—particularly from non-metrical records—can likely be discovered for Antoni Szyfrynowicz that will help to clarify our present understanding of his life story.\n\nSources:\n\n1 Roman Catholic Church, Dmosin parish (Dmosin, Brzeziny, Łódź, Poland), “Akta stanu cywilnego Parafii Rzymskokatolickiej w Dmosinie, 1808–1920,” Akta urodzeń, małżeństw i zgonów, 1862 r.

I used the example of the Batkiewicz/Bartkiewicz/Watkiewicz/Wątkiewicz family of Buffalo, New York, who informally changed their surname to Bitner/Bittner between 1910 and 1915. Although Polish surnames would seem to be especially susceptible to such changes, similar examples can be found across all ethnic groups, and even the “simple” Irish surname, Walsh, has been recorded with multiple variant spellings, ranging from Welch and Welsh to Breatnach, according to Irish researcher John Grenham.1\n\nHowever, I’ve encountered another such example that’s so much fun, that I just have to share it. If you’re a regular reader of this blog, you may recall my ongoing quest to identify parents and place of birth for my great-great-grandmother, Antonina Zarzycka, whose maiden name was variously recorded as Naciążek, Raciążek, and Maciążek. Last fall, I was finally able to locate birth and death records for her which confirmed that her parents were Franciszek and Marianna (Kowalska) Naciązek. Of course, one discovery leads to another, and Franciszek Naciążek was identified as the son of Piotr and Małgorzata (__) Naciążek.2 Furthermore, there’s evidence that Piotr and Małgorzata had a daughter, Anna, who married Antoni Szyfrynowicz,3 and that’s where the variant-surname mayhem begins.\n\nIntroducing Antoni and Anna Szyfrynowicz/ Zytnerowicz/Szufrynowicz/Sypnorowicz… Whatever!\n\nThe picture that has emerged from the research thus far looks like this: Anna Naciążek was born to Piotr and Małgorzata (__) Naciążek between 1798 and 1804 in the village of Giżyce, in what is now Sochaczew County, Poland. She was born during that brief historical interlude when this area was under Prussian control, between the final partition of Poland in 1795 and the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. (Further information on Poland’s changing borders can be found here.) She married Antoni Szyfrynowicz circa 1822, estimated from the 1823 birth of their oldest child discovered to date. However, the picture of these earliest years of Anna’s life is clouded by a lack of available evidence.\n\nSignificant gaps exist in collections of vital records for Giżyce from both the Archiwum Diecezji Łowickiej (diocesan archive in Łowicz) which has no birth records prior to 1826, and no marriage records prior to 1827, as well as the Archiwum Państwowe w Warszawie Oddział w Grodzisku Mazowieckim (state archive in Grodzisk Mazowiecki), which has limited birth, marriage and death records from the first half of the 19th century (1810, and 1823–1825 only). Furthermore, I believe that all the early 19th-century (and earlier) records from the parish archive have now been transferred to the diocesan archive, as discussed previously, so there’s no hope of finding additional records onsite at the parish to fill those gaps. This means that Anna’s birth record, her marriage record, and the birth records of any children born prior to 1823, may no longer exist, which complicates the research.\n\nNonetheless, we know that Antoni and Anna had a daughter, Katarzyna Marianna Zytnerowicz, who was born in Giżyce on 29 April 1823.4 Following Katarzyna’s birth in Giżyce, the family migrated to the village of Walewice in Bielawy parish, some 46 km/29 miles away, where their son, Ignacy Szufrynowicz, was born on 3 February 1825.5 Five years later, a daughter, Joanna Nepomucena Sypnorowicz, was born in the village of Śleszyn on 9 October 1830.6 Another daughter, Paulina Sitnerowicz, was born on 17 June 1833 in Budzyń,7 and the following year, Antoni and Anna suffered the loss of their daughter, Joanna, on 10 May 1834, while still living in Budzyń.8 At least within that parish, the same spelling of their surname was used consistently, and Joanna’s surname was recorded as Sitnerowicz on her death record, never mind the fact that she was Sypnorowicz when she was born.\n\nBy 1836, the family had migrated yet again, this time to Kiernozia, where their daughter, Marianna Szyfrynowicz, was born on 26 March 1836.9 Following a six-year gap, they emerged in the historical records in Leszno, 56 km/35 miles east of their previous residence in Kiernozia. Another daughter was born in Leszno—Marcella Agnieszka Szifnernowicz, on 16 January 1841.10 1843 found Antoni and Anna in Wiskitki, where a son, Wincenty Apolinary Szafranowicz was born on 8 January 1843.11 He died in Wiskitki two months later, on 12 March 1843 under the name Wincenty Appolinary Sznuffrynowicz.12\n\nAntoni and Anna’s youngest known child was another daughter named Joanna who was born 24 May 1844 back in Śleszyn.13 She was baptized as Joanna Sitnerowicz, but was recorded as Joanna Szyfrynowicz when she died at the age of three on 3 March 1847 in Tomczyce.14 By 1848, the family had returned to Walewice, where their eight-year-old daughter, Józefa Szufrynowicz, died on 13 November 1848.15 Józefa’s birth record has not yet been located. Her age at the time of death suggests a birth circa 1840, but the fact that Anna and Antoni’s daughter Marcella was born in January 1841, suggests a greater likelihood that Józefa was born earlier, circa 1839.\n\nAt this point, it’s not known where the family was living at that time. Leszno would be a possibility, since that’s where Marcella was born. However, birth records for Leszno are indexed in Geneteka for the entire period from 1808–1916 with no gaps, yet Józefa’s birth record is not found. Moreover, there are no promising matches in any indexed parish within the present-day Mazowieckie or Łódzkie provinces, which most likely suggests that Józefa was baptized in a parish whose records have not yet been indexed for that time period. Alternatively, her birth record may no longer exist.\n\nEighteen-year-old Paulina Szyfnerowicz died on 1 February 1852 while employed as a housekeeper at Walewice Palace.16 Her sister, Marianna Szyfrynowicz, married Michał Trafalski on 17 June 1855 in Oporów,17 but died two years later in Wola Owsiana, on 24 October 1857.18 Their father, Antoni Szyfrynowicz, died on 9 February 1862 in the village of Osiny.19 A map showing the family’s travels between 1822 and 1862 is shown in Figure 1.\n\nAnna herself died six years later, in the village of Wymyśłow, on 7 August 1868. Her death record, written in Russian, is shown in Figure 2.3\n\nThis is the only record discovered to date which identifies Anna’s parents as Piotr and Małgorzata, thus appending her to my family tree. In translation,* the record states,\n\n“No. 18. Wymysłów.\n\nIt happened in the town of Głowno on the eighth day of August in the year one thousand eight hundred sixty-eight at four o’clock in the afternoon. Filip Jagiełło, age thirty-two, and Marcin Nadolski, age twenty-six, manorial farm servants, living in the village of Wymysłów, appeared and stated that yesterday, at two o’clock in the morning, Anna Szyfrynowicz, née Naciążek, died, a widow of her deceased husband, Antoni Szyfrynowicz, laborer living in the village of Wymysłów, born in the village of Giżyce, daughter of the deceased spouses Piotr and Małgorzata Naciążek; she leaves behind her daughter Marcella; the deceased was age seventy. After visual confirmation of the death of Anna Szyfrynowicz, this document was read to those present and was signed only by Us due to their illiteracy. [signed] Rev. Stanisław Biekalski, Keeper of the Civil Registers, Głowno Parish.”\n\nThe fact that only one daughter is mentioned in the death notice suggests that Anna outlived eight of her nine children, although death records have not yet been discovered for the oldest two children, Katarzyna and Ignacy. Marcella’s story continues through vital records, and additional documents pertaining to the parents and siblings of Antoni Szyfrynowicz could probably be located; however, the examples shown thus far pertaining to Antoni and Anna’s immediate family are sufficient to illustrate the challenges inherent to this research.\n\nResearching the Szyfrynowicz Family in Geneteka\n\nAll of this evidence for the Szyfrynowicz family was discovered thanks to the Polish vital records database, Geneteka. The surname variants, and the number of occurrences of each, are summarized in the table shown in Figure 3.\n\nIn addition to the wildly divergent surname variations observed with the Szyfrynowicz surname, Anna’s maiden name was found to be all over the place, as well. Although Naciażek was the spelling used in nine historical records,4, 8, 9, 10, 12,14,16,17,18 there were two instances of Maciążek,6,13 and one each of Maciorek,11 Naciąszek,7 and Zaciąska.5 Additionally, Anna’s maiden name was identified as Strzelecka in the death record of her daughter, Józefa.15 However, in light of the body of evidence, this can be considered a more egregious recording error, rather than a benign etymological or phonetic variant. In records pertaining to my great-great-grandmother, Antonina (Naciążek) Zarzycka, the surname variant Raciążek was also used on eight of the 22 documents which identified her maiden name. Nonetheless, Naciążek was the predominant variant found for her, as well.\n\nPolish surname variants tend to arise based on common etymology, and similar phonetics. The surname Grzesiak, for example, derives from the given name Grzegorz (Gregory),20 so variant spellings found in historical records for the same individual or family might include Grzesiek, Grzeszak, Grzeszczak, Greześkiewicz, etc. Similarly, members of the Bartoszewicz family might be recorded as Bartosiewicz, Bartusiewicz, and Bartoszewski. A simple wildcard search in Geneteka is usually an effective strategy for dealing with these issues. A search for “Bart*” will include all etymological and phonetic surname variants that begin with these four letters. However, research into the Szyfrynowicz family is complicated by the lack of common etymological or phonetic patterns found in the first few letters of the surname, as shown in Figure 3. The only pattern found within all examples of the surname is the “-owicz” ending. Unfortunately, Geneteka does not permit the wildcard character (*) to be used as the first letter of a surname in such a way that it helps to resolve this problem. To clarify, it’s possible to perform a search for the surname, “*owicz,” but results do not include all indexed Polish surnames ending in “-owicz.” Instead, the asterisk is ignored, and results include surnames that begin with “Owicz-” as well as surnames that were undecipherable to the indexer and contain a question mark (?) or an ellipsis (…).\n\nFor this reason, searches for records pertaining to Antoni and Anna’s family were accomplished more easily by using Anna’s maiden name as a search term, rather than her married surname. The wildcard strategy was somewhat more effective that way, since a search for “Naci*” will include results for Naciążek, Naciak, and Naciąszek. However, the search must be repeated for “Raci*” and “Maci*” in order to tease out all possible variants related to those spellings. In contrast, wildcard searches for Anna’s married surname employing “S*” or “Z*” are too broad, yet the inclusion of even a second character in the search string makes them already too narrow, based on the list of surnames shown in Figure 3. Research into the Szyfrynowicz family was further complicated by the family’s migrations, which spanned villages located in both the present day Łódzkie and Mazowieckie provinces. This fact necessitated the repetition of all searches in both provinces, since searches in Geneteka are limited to one province at a time. All of these factors illustrate the importance of thinking broadly when devising strategies for searches in Geneteka.\n\nThis research into the Szyfrynowicz family illustrates the slipperiness of the “original surname” concept. Many researchers are under the impression that surname changes and variant spellings are a problem unique to immigrants to the U.S. or Canada. If they are able to trace their family back to records from the Old Country, they reason, it will be possible to identify the one, true version of the surname. Unfortunately, the reality is rarely so simple. In the case of the Szyfrynowicz family, the preferred version of the surname was found on only five of 17 vital records pertaining to the family. Sometimes, the best you can do is to keep gathering data, until a preponderance of evidence is obtained.\n\nSources:\n\n1 John Grenham, “All variants of Walsh,” Irish Ancestors (https://www.johngrenham.com/ : accessed 28 March 2023).\n\n2 Roman Catholic Church (Sochaczew, Sochaczew, Mazowieckie, Poland), “Akta stanu cywilnego Parafii Rzymskokatolickiej w Sochaczewie, 1781-1901,” Księga małżeństw, 1826-1842, 1826, no. 7, Franciszek Naciążek and Marianna Kowalska; Archiwum Diecezjalne w Łowiczu, ul.

Hoffman, Polish Surnames: Origins and Meanings, 3rd Edition, Vol. 2 (Chicago, Illinois: Polish Genealogical Society of America, 2012), p 224, “entry for “Grzes-.”\n\n*I would like to acknowledge with gratitude the kind assistance of Monika Deimann-Clemens in reviewing my translation of Anna Szyfrynowicz’s death record.\n\n© Julie Roberts Szczepankiewicz, 2023\n\nIn January, I started a new term as President of the Polish Genealogical Society of New York State (PGSNYS). I’m excited to be serving in this role, despite the learning curve that comes with any new position. Although my duties as President have cut into my available time for research and writing, I’m rolling up my sleeves and giving it my best effort, because I believe in the work that the PGSNYS is doing.\n\nSome of you may be wondering if there’s still a role for traditional genealogical societies in era of internet genealogy—whether the focus is Polish research, or anything else. I confess that there was a time in my life when I, too, wondered if the success of Facebook genealogy groups might spur the demise of traditional genealogical societies. And don’t misunderstand me; I’m still a fan of Facebook genealogy groups, for all the reasons I wrote about previously. While parts of that post are outdated (Facebook has changed quite a bit since 2016!), Facebook groups continue to be great resource for genealogists. However, I believe that traditional genealogical societies serve as a complement to Facebook groups, offering unique value, and they deserve our support. Here’s what your membership to a genealogical society provides:\n\nPersonal Research Assistance\n\nMost genealogical societies offer some form of personal research assistance to their members, in the form of planned outreach events like PGSNYS’s spring and fall Genealogy Fairs, or the upcoming spring conference of the Polish Genealogical Society of Massachusetts (PGSMA), with the theme, “Whom Do I Ask? Grandma and Grandpa Are Gone.” The genealogical community is typically generous, and most societies have experienced researchers among their members who are willing to offer some guidance for those who are just starting out. Bear in mind that “research guidance” doesn’t mean that the society’s volunteers will create an entire family tree for you, but they can often suggest resources and strategies to help you further your research goals. In some cases, a donation to the society is requested in exchange for simple look-ups, or more in-depth research in local resources, performed by volunteers from the society. The Ontario Genealogical Society is one group whose services I have personally used for onsite research into records pertaining to my ancestors living in the Niagara Peninsula.\n\nAccess to the Society’s Newsletter or Journal\n\nWhether it’s Rodziny, published by the Polish Genealogical Society of America (PGSA), the Western New York Genealogist, published by the Western New York Genealogical Society, PGSNYS’ own Searchers, or the scholarly National Genealogical Society Quarterly, most or all genealogical societies offer some form of publication which is a benefit of membership. These publications typically contain articles written by society members about their own family history research, which illustrate their use of methodology and resources. Additional content may include book reviews, research library acquisitions, website tutorials, and news regarding the society’s upcoming events and current projects. Reading about the methods used by other researchers for breaking through their brick walls can give you insight into how to break through some of your own. Sometimes you may even discover articles that pertain to your own family history research, written by distant cousins. Journal and newsletter editors are always looking for new material, so consider writing up a story or two from your own family history research to share with a larger audience.\n\nSince genealogical society publications are such an important resource, it’s worth mentioning that the Allen County Public Library offers a subject index to genealogy and local history periodicals. The Periodical Source Index, or PERSI, can be searched free of charge at the website of the Allen County Public Library Genealogy Center (Figure 1). The database currently includes more than 3 million citations, and relevant search results can be ordered from the library. The cost is $7.50 per order form (up to six articles) prepaid, and then 20 cents per page for copying, or free email delivery.\n\nEducational Presentations\n\nGenealogical society meetings usually involve a lecture or presentation on some topic related to the group’s focus. During the dark days of the COVID-19 pandemic, most societies had to adapt their meetings to a videoconference (Zoom) format. While many of us missed the in-person interactions at society meetings, the switch to videoconferencing offered access to genealogy lectures hosted by societies located all over the globe, for the first time in history. Although the pandemic is largely behind us, videoconferencing is here to stay. Many societies have opted to continue hosting their meetings by Zoom, or to host hybrid meetings, with a speaker presenting for a local, live audience, while simultaneously Zooming the lecture for out-of-area society members or those who prefer to join remotely. This has been a boon for many who are researching Polish ancestors, due to the increased availability of lectures from researchers located in Poland.\n\nThe format of educational presentations will vary, and may include a brief business meeting for the host society prior to the lecture. These business meetings can also be informative, as they offer attendees a chance learn about the society’s ongoing projects and upcoming events. Presentations are usually free for members, and sometimes free for the general public, although some societies charge non-members a nominal fee, to help defray the cost of bringing in speakers. Genealogical society lectures are an excellent opportunity to learn about cutting-edge resources and methods in the fast-paced, ever-changing world of internet-driven genealogy. And while the national conferences like the National Genealogical Society (NGS) conference or RootsTech, or regional conferences like NERGC, offer connection with researchers and topics on a large scale, the smaller conferences hosted by organizations such as the Polish Genealogical Societies in Massachusetts (PGSMA), Connecticut (PGSCTNE) and Chicago (PGSA) are an opportunity to focus on ethnic research in those areas where your ancestors lived. Attending a genealogy conference held in a city where your ancestors lived provides an opportunity for onsite research in local libraries, archives, and cemeteries, as well.\n\nDiscounts on Society Publications and Services\n\nSome genealogical societies, such as the Polish Genealogical Society of America and the Polish Genealogical Society of Michigan, maintain online stores where one can purchase printed books and digital media. Members can log in to get a discount on their purchases. Research services are often discounted for society members as well, and some of the offerings of these local societies are unique and extremely valuable to researchers. PGSA, for example, offers a database for Polish Roman Catholic Union of America (PRCUA) life insurance claims. The PRCUA had branches throughout the U.S. in cities with Polish communities, and the database contains just over 61,000 entries. If you find your ancestor in the database, this is your lucky day, because death claim packets can be genealogical goldmines. Claim packets dated after 1912 usually include a death certificate, as well as the original insurance application, an example of which is shown in Figure 2.\n\nThis example, which was discovered through the PGSA database, pertains to Wojciech Drajem, a Polish immigrant to Buffalo, New York, and information on just this page includes his date of birth, parents’ given names, approximate ages of his parents at their time of death, number of siblings and their ages and causes of death, health information, address, and a signature. (See here for a discussion of this document in the context of my Drajem research.) This page is just one of the eleven pages contained within his death claim packet. Copies of individual death claim packets are available from PGSA for the modest price of $10 per name for members and $15 for non-members.\n\nSupport for Unique, Local, Digitization and Indexing Projects\n\nOpportunities abound for researchers who are willing to volunteer a little time to index or transcribe historical records. While such opportunities exist nationally and internationally, with organizations ranging from FamilySearch and the National Archives to Geneteka, local genealogical societies are often in need of volunteers for indexing as well. Indexing historical record collections from places where your ancestors lived is a great way to immerse yourself in the surnames, pedigrees, and history of those communities. Both PGSNYS and PGSCTNE have ongoing indexing projects for collections such as PGSCTNE’s Polish-American marriage records and anniversary book records, and PGSNYS’s Dziennik dla Wszystkich death notices and funerary prayer cards (obrazki). If you have Polish-American ancestors who settled in these areas, it’s definitely worth a search in these societies’ databases to see if you can find your family there. Figure 3 shows an image of a funerary prayer card for Wojciech Drajem which I recently contributed to the project. Some of the cards in the collection are in Polish, while others are in English. Translation assistance for Polish obrazki and death notices can be found in this guide, prepared by the PGSNYS.\n\nBuffalo’s Polish-language newspaper, the Dziennik dla Wszystkich [Everybody’s Daily] is a significant source of information about the daily lives of Polish immigrants and first- and second-generation Americans of Polish descent in Western New York. Details about their civic contributions, social and professional lives, and community roles, can help add “flesh” to the “bare bones” of names and dates in our family trees. In order to make the contents of the paper accessible to researchers, PGSNYS went above and beyond the creation of their database of death notices published in the Dziennik, and initiated a project to digitize entire issues of the paper. Images of papers digitized to date have been uploaded to NYS Historic Newspapers, where they are keyword- and surname-searchable by optical character recognition (OCR). Please note that as of this writing, the site seems to be having an issue with the search engine, and searches were returning no results even for words known to be contained within the text. The issue has been reported to the Northern New York Library Network that administers the site, and hopefully it will be fixed soon. In the meantime, issues of the paper can still be browsed, which means that images are available for death notices discovered in a search of the Dziennik database.\n\nCamaraderie with Other Genealogy Fanatics\n\nLet’s face it, genealogy is a passion that not everyone “gets.” Not everyone gets excited about taking photos in a cemetery, or is exhilarated by the discovery of a “new” ancestral village. Lots of folks just don’t care if you’ve discovered a new set of 4x-great-grandparents. Genealogical societies offer a chance for connection with other like-minded individuals, who can celebrate your discoveries with you, and empathize with your frustration about those “brick walls” in your family tree. They may even be able to help you brainstorm some strategies. When you join a genealogical society based in one of your ancestral cities or towns, there’s a good chance that some of the members will share an interest in one or more of your ancestral surnames, in addition to an interest in the local history of that place. You may even discover distant cousins and research collaborators within the membership.\n\nFinally, if you think those genealogical societies are worth your membership dollars, you may also discover that they’re worth your time. I’ve enjoyed collaborating with my colleagues from various genealogical societies over many years, and some of those collaborations have turned into friendships. What’s more, I enjoy the satisfaction that comes from our combined efforts achieving fruition, whether in the form of a successful educational event, or a new contribution to a digital archive or database. So, despite that learning curve with the presidency of PGSNYS, I know I’m not alone. We have a great mixture of experienced, longtime members on our board of directors, as well as some enthusiastic, knowledgeable newcomers, who bring a variety of skills to the table. Together, we’re committed to making the PGSNYS the best that it can be, in service to the Polish-American genealogical community with roots in Western New York.\n\nCheck out some of the Polish genealogical societies mentioned here, or these located in Minnesota, Cleveland, Toledo, and Texas. There’s a lot to discover!\n\n© Julie Roberts Szczepankiewicz 2023\n\nNote: This article was originally published in the Fall 2022 issue of Biuletyn Korzenie, the newsletter of the Polish Genealogical Society of Massachusetts. It is reprinted here with permission.\n\nIf you’ve been researching your family tree for more than five minutes, you’ve probably discovered that name changes and variant spellings are commonly found in historical records for our ancestors. Whether those changes happened because our ancestors were illiterate or semi-literate, or because they wanted to assimilate into an American culture that didn’t appreciate “foreign” sounding names, or because people just weren’t as particular about names back then, it’s a problem that most family historians will face at one time or another. It’s particularly important to resolve this issue, and have some evidence for the original version of a family’s surname, before attempting research in records from Europe. So, how does one go about determining the original form of a surname? Let’s consider the following case study.\n\nHelen Bittner of Buffalo, New York\n\nMy brother-in-law, Hank Nowak, had a grandmother named Helen (Bittner) Nowak, and he was aware of a family story that her maiden surname, Bittner, had been changed from something else. Hank asked me to do a little research into his family history to see if I could determine when the surname was changed, and what the original surname had been. To answer these questions, I started with the 1925 New York State census, and confirmed with my brother-in-law that the names, ages, and place of residence matched with known facts for his family. That census is shown in Figure 1.1\n\nIn 1925, Helen Bittner was 19 years old, living with her 56-year-old mother, Victoria, and her 17-year-old sister, Władysława, at 162 Marion Street in Buffalo. Helen was employed at a box manufacturing factory, and Władysława’s occupation, “enameling,” suggested that she was employed in some aspect of the porcelain enamel coatings industry. Both Helen and Władysława were born in the U.S., while their widowed mother, Victoria, was born in Poland. Victoria’s age suggested a date of birth circa 1869, and she was noted to have been living in the U.S. for 20 years, which suggested an arrival date of about 1905. According to this census, Victoria was still an alien in 1925, and if this is correct, then it’s unlikely that she petitioned to naturalize, since she died in 1928.2\n\nThe Bitner Family in 1920\n\nHaving identified Helen Bittner and the members of her household in 1925, the next step was to locate the family in the 1920 census, shown in Figure 2.3\n\nIn 1920, the Bitner family—spelled with only one “t” this time—was living in Clarence, New York, rather than within the city of Buffalo. However, careful examination of the data for each family member allowed me to be certain this was still the same family. Once again, Victoria Bittner was reported to be a widow, whose native tongue was Polish and who was born in Galicia circa 1866. In this context, “Galicia” refers to the Galicia region of the Austrian Empire, a region which spans what is now southeastern Poland and southwestern Ukraine. Although Victoria’s age (and therefore her predicted birth year) are a few years off from our expectations based on the 1925 census, the data are nonetheless well within the typical margin of error observed in records for Polish immigrants of this era. She reported an immigration year of 1904, and—in contrast to the 1925 census—this record states that she was naturalized, although the exact year of naturalization was not recorded.\n\nNaturalization records can often provide answers to questions about name changes, since immigrants who naturalized after 1906 were required to provide a certificate of arrival along with their petition for naturalization.4 These certificates were intended to verify the length of time that an immigrant had been living in the United States. In addition to documenting the date of arrival and name of the ship on which the immigrant traveled, they also include the name under which the immigrant traveled, if different from the name that person was using at the time of petition. A thorough research into the Bittners’ family history would include an attempt to obtain naturalization records for family members born in Poland. However, this step was ultimately unnecessary in order to simply answer the question about the family’s original surname.\n\nIn 1920, Victoria’s household included a son, John K. Bittner, who had presumably moved out by 1925. He was reported to be a naturalized citizen who had arrived in 1904 and was 22 years old in 1920, suggesting a birth year circa 1898. Another daughter, 17-year-old Viola V. Bittner, was also living with the family, born circa 1903, and arriving circa 1904. Rounding out the family group in 1920 were Helen J. Bittner and Lottie J. Bittner, whose ages and places of birth are consistent with the Helen and Władysława described in the 1925 census. As an added bonus, the final member of this household was the children’s grandmother, indexed as “Thressa Blagek,” but identified through further research as Teresa Klocek, Wiktoria’s mother. Teresa was widowed, arrived in 1915, and was reported to be 80 years old, which implies a birth year circa 1840.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Polish immigrants often changed their given names, as well as their surnames, in their efforts to assimilate into American culture. Neither “Victoria” nor “Viola” is a Polish spelling since the Polish alphabet lacks the letter “v.” Although a direct translation of Viola in Polish would be Wiola, research experience s"
