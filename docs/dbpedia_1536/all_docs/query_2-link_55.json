        "text": "I DID IT! Last week, I delivered a presentation in English (which is not my native language) at my org all-hands for +600 employees invited from around the globe. Why does this matter, and why am I proud of it? Three reasons: 1- Because I trusted myself: As a woman in a leadership position, I am constantly fighting against my own worst enemy: myself. And apparently, I'm not alone. In a recent study, 61% of women say their inner critic is the most significant factor undermining their confidence. How did I beat this? Simple: consistently working on my self-confidence, feeling comfortable receiving criticism, and practicing A LOT where I needed to improve. 2- Because I beat one of my biggest fears with compassion, focus, and preparation. According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than delivering the eulogy.\" — Jerry Seinfeld. 3- Because I am a native Spanish speaker. Once I joined a global team at Uber, I was already fluent in English (or I thought that), but I didn't sound like my English-native peers and was insecure about making a mistake or mispronouncing any word. While trying to sound near an English native speaker, I realized it was an impossible milestone to achieve (and unrealistic), and I needed to do peace with that. I understand now that I will never speak as a native, which is a gift; that will show where I come from and the history I represent. My insecurity turned into a privilege. As a Latina woman working in an English-speaking company, I confirmed that your native language shouldn't be a limitation for the quality of opportunities you will take (and I was lucky to found a company that thinks likewise) With these, I am not saying we shouldn't invest in being better at speaking any language, nor should we not want to sound like a native. I invested multiple hours taking courses, learning vocabulary, and practicing wherever I could. Ultimately, based on my experience, how far you want to go depends on you. Here is a small unsolicited advice about what I learned from public speaking that I would like to share: Practice, practice, practice. No space is too little to practice: I had more learnings in small team meetings than in big forums. If you only think of public speaking as delivering conferences for big groups, you may need to shift your mind. If you take any space to practice intentionally and request feedback afterward, I can guarantee you will feel natural about it at some point. Whenever a big opportunity appears, you are going to be prepared! Confidence typically comes with a lot of backstage preparation or for the lucky ones with a born gift.\n\n#I recently joined corporate sector and good in technical skills, but I shy when it comes to speaking and expressing myself in English language. How do I overcome this?\" #Many working professionals when they join corporate sector go through this phase. *In a world full of competition, we are in a race to master technical skills, however, the biggest hurdle working professionals face is their ability to share their thoughts, many shy expressing themselves. *Many working professionals don't realize what cost they are paying because of their shy nature. Many face constant rejections to seek better opportunities. *If you're a shy person, people may think that you are a reserved person, they might ignore you, though many people are naturally introvert but when it comes to your professional life, you need to step up and learn to speak for yourself otherwise people will continue to take advantage of your shyness. It happens in many professional set ups, when a shy person is loaded with additional responsibilities, he doesn't say 'no' to people and continues to feel stressed. The best way to deal with this issue is to open up and speak up. For that you need to learn how to work on your shyness. Here are steps to work on your shyness: 1️⃣ Practice, Practice, Practice: Daily conversations, reading articles, and engaging in discussions to build fluency. 2️⃣ Seeking Feedback: Constructive criticism is a stepping stone to improvement. Always be open to feedback and learning from every interaction. 3️⃣ Language Learning Resources: Exploring various language tools and courses to strengthen your language foundation. 🤝 I'd love to hear from you!

I'm so excited! I'll be staying on-site in the school and having private lessons in the afternoon to work around my VA work in the mornings. I've had a few friends ask why I've decided to study Spanish now: 🇪🇸 I'm tired of the silent judgement from fellow Europeans who all seem to speak at least three languages. 😂 Whyyyy aren't languages more important back home?! 🇪🇸 As a solo female traveller, being able to speak Spanish here would make me feel more comfortable and safe when moving about on my own 🇪🇸 When attempting to speak Spanish to locals (I can now confidently order a beer😎), they are non-judgemental when I make mistakes, patient and appreciative of me trying. It's encouraging and makes me want to put the effort in even more. 🇪🇸 I am fascinated by languages! I have many bilingual friends back home and often wonder how they are able to switch back so frequently. Do they dream in English? Do they think in their mother tongue? Do they cheekily use it as a secret code sometimes? I wish languages had been more encouraged whilst I was in school, I never understood the importance of it or the value it could add to my life one day. I had the option of French or German, and took French, but was not able to retain much not using it outside of the classroom. Also, I do believe it is more of a challenge for us Brits to learn a new language as we are only ever exposed to English; signage, menu's, TV shows. It makes it harder, right? Any tips on learning Spanish for this Brit who has never spoken another language would be appreciated. 😆 --- Hi, I’m Ella 👋 A Virtual Assistant with 9 years' experience in customer service, admin & recruitment-based roles.

How could I be spending money for my Spanish group conversation classes and not be fully prepared? It's easy to tell people what to do, but ironically, we can be caught not always practicing what we preach. I am not just a language coach; but I'm also an active Spanish student, so I'm constantly walking a tightrope between what I say and do. Recently, I had an epiphany, when I caught myself mindlessly scrolling through my social media feed between meetings or during \"free time\". Trust me, this habit creeps up on you like a virus. It's like dopamine. Suddenly the minutes go by and before you know it 30, 45 or 60 mins have passed.🙈 WTH ?! Has this been happening to you too ? Recent research by Forbes, shows that people are spending an average of 3-5 hours PER DAY just scrolling social media! Imagine what we should or could be doing with that time ? After realizing the hours I had been wasting weekly, I created my own solution: 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝟐𝟎-𝟐𝟎 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞. Every time I pick up my phone for an idle scroll-fest, I ask myself 2 questions. 1️⃣ Are my VIP to-do tasks completed ? 2️⃣ Would I rather spend 20 mins scrolling studying, working-out, resting or calling a family member or friend? 7 times out of 10 doing the right thing wins ! So, we can conclude, there really isn't a shortage of time for what's important, but rather a choice in how we CHOOSE to spend our time-currency. What strategies have you tried to reduce your screen-time and invest it in areas like your English practice, other skill or hobbies ?

Teemu is a client of mine and he is now working in a regional role, supporting the Nordic market. When I 1st met him, he was a Marketing Manager at an outdoor sports brand for the Finnish office. His is a familiar story. He could speak English reasonably well, but he never really used it much at work until he got an opportunity to represent his organization at an international trade show. Suddenly, he found himself surrounded by English-speaking professionals and realized he really needed to brush up on his language skills, especially for small talk and product demonstrations. He was feeling self-conscious about saying too much in English as his vocabulary was limited and small talk skills were almost non-existent. So, Teemu decided to invest some time and effort into improving his English communication skills. Nothing too over the top, just small steps to get better. ✅He started by listening to English podcasts and audiobooks. ✅He joined an English conversation group. ✅He joined an online course. ✅ He read English news articles and books. As a result of Teemu's efforts, his confidence grew, and he made a lasting impression at those trade shows. His ability to communicate effectively in English opened up new doors for him, including the possibility of a role at his organization's Nordic head office in Stockholm, where English was the working language. Teemu didn't become a superstar overnight, but he did eventually secure a role at the head office. It was a step forward in his career, one he might not have taken without his improved English skills. What can you learn from Teemu's story🤔 1. Improved English communication skills can accelerate career progression. In today's globalized world, English is the language of business. If you want to advance your career, it's important to be able to communicate effectively in English. 2. It's all about gradual growth, not instant stardom.

I am not able to crack interviews because of low confidence in English Communication and this results in huge opportunity loss. I believe that if I had learnt English Communication at the starting of my career, I would have got better career options. #How many of you would agree that you have been in this situation at some point in your life? Although I faced a lot of challenges in my school days, I was fortunate enough to create an environment for myself to work on my English, which helped me become better at the start of my career. However, everyone in the job market has their own journey and struggles. It doesn't matter what you have done in the past, but it is very important how you approach now, what you are going to do now, that matters the most. Many professionals working in the back-office struggle because of a lack of confidence in English. This has become a barrier to getting through job interviews and seizing valuable opportunities. So, what needs to be done? Self-reflection must be the starting point until you realize what you have done and what you need to do to achieve better results. This comes from realizing that investing time and money in improving your English skills earlier could have opened up a world of opportunities and different career options. *Here are some steps to enhance your English communication skills and boost your confidence for successful interviews: 1️⃣ Immerse Yourself: Surround yourself with English content - read articles, books, and blogs, watch movies or TV shows, and listen to podcasts. This exposure will help you become more comfortable with the language's nuances. 2️⃣ Practice Regularly: Practice makes perfect! Engage in daily conversations in English, whether it's with friends, family, or even by participating in online language exchange platforms. The more you practice, the more confident you'll become. 3️⃣ Online Learning Platforms: Explore online platforms like Duolingo, Babbel, or even YouTube tutorials tailored for English learners. These platforms offer structured lessons to improve grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. 4️⃣ Join Language Classes: Consider enrolling in formal English language classes, either in-person or online. Professional guidance can provide targeted support and feedback to address specific areas of improvement.
