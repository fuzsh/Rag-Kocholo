        "text": "#I recently joined corporate sector and good in technical skills, but I shy when it comes to speaking and expressing myself in English language. How do I overcome this?\" #Many working professionals when they join corporate sector go through this phase. *In a world full of competition, we are in a race to master technical skills, however, the biggest hurdle working professionals face is their ability to share their thoughts, many shy expressing themselves. *Many working professionals don't realize what cost they are paying because of their shy nature. Many face constant rejections to seek better opportunities. *If you're a shy person, people may think that you are a reserved person, they might ignore you, though many people are naturally introvert but when it comes to your professional life, you need to step up and learn to speak for yourself otherwise people will continue to take advantage of your shyness. It happens in many professional set ups, when a shy person is loaded with additional responsibilities, he doesn't say 'no' to people and continues to feel stressed. The best way to deal with this issue is to open up and speak up. For that you need to learn how to work on your shyness. Here are steps to work on your shyness: 1️⃣ Practice, Practice, Practice: Daily conversations, reading articles, and engaging in discussions to build fluency. 2️⃣ Seeking Feedback: Constructive criticism is a stepping stone to improvement. Always be open to feedback and learning from every interaction. 3️⃣ Language Learning Resources: Exploring various language tools and courses to strengthen your language foundation. 🤝 I'd love to hear from you!

I'm so excited! I'll be staying on-site in the school and having private lessons in the afternoon to work around my VA work in the mornings. I've had a few friends ask why I've decided to study Spanish now: 🇪🇸 I'm tired of the silent judgement from fellow Europeans who all seem to speak at least three languages. 😂 Whyyyy aren't languages more important back home?! 🇪🇸 As a solo female traveller, being able to speak Spanish here would make me feel more comfortable and safe when moving about on my own 🇪🇸 When attempting to speak Spanish to locals (I can now confidently order a beer😎), they are non-judgemental when I make mistakes, patient and appreciative of me trying. It's encouraging and makes me want to put the effort in even more. 🇪🇸 I am fascinated by languages! I have many bilingual friends back home and often wonder how they are able to switch back so frequently. Do they dream in English? Do they think in their mother tongue? Do they cheekily use it as a secret code sometimes? I wish languages had been more encouraged whilst I was in school, I never understood the importance of it or the value it could add to my life one day. I had the option of French or German, and took French, but was not able to retain much not using it outside of the classroom. Also, I do believe it is more of a challenge for us Brits to learn a new language as we are only ever exposed to English; signage, menu's, TV shows. It makes it harder, right? Any tips on learning Spanish for this Brit who has never spoken another language would be appreciated. 😆 --- Hi, I’m Ella 👋 A Virtual Assistant with 9 years' experience in customer service, admin & recruitment-based roles.

Website: https://buff.ly/3TkaXx2 Email: ella@virtuella.info\n\nI didn't have my priorities right and it was costing me ! How could I be spending money for my Spanish group conversation classes and not be fully prepared? It's easy to tell people what to do, but ironically, we can be caught not always practicing what we preach. I am not just a language coach; but I'm also an active Spanish student, so I'm constantly walking a tightrope between what I say and do. Recently, I had an epiphany, when I caught myself mindlessly scrolling through my social media feed between meetings or during \"free time\". Trust me, this habit creeps up on you like a virus. It's like dopamine. Suddenly the minutes go by and before you know it 30, 45 or 60 mins have passed.🙈 WTH ?! Has this been happening to you too ? Recent research by Forbes, shows that people are spending an average of 3-5 hours PER DAY just scrolling social media! Imagine what we should or could be doing with that time ? After realizing the hours I had been wasting weekly, I created my own solution: 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝟐𝟎-𝟐𝟎 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞. Every time I pick up my phone for an idle scroll-fest, I ask myself 2 questions. 1️⃣ Are my VIP to-do tasks completed ? 2️⃣ Would I rather spend 20 mins scrolling studying, working-out, resting or calling a family member or friend? 7 times out of 10 doing the right thing wins ! So, we can conclude, there really isn't a shortage of time for what's important, but rather a choice in how we CHOOSE to spend our time-currency. What strategies have you tried to reduce your screen-time and invest it in areas like your English practice, other skill or hobbies ?

Is this right? Of course not! Look how reading comes into play. 📖 As expats, we have to read a lot. For a lot of us, it's easier than listening, so we may prefer it. I would rather read 7 long emails than call my tax office in French! 😵💫 However, did you know that we read in different ways? See below what skills and knowledge you can boost by reading! 💪 💥 Read extensively. For work and for fun, not for the sake of language-learning. You have to have substantial time spent on reading for your brain to integrate everything that you have learned to read effortlessly, to be able to vary your speed and the degree to which you are involved with the text and are processing it. 💥 Develop a habit of noticing. Notice: 🎯 unfamiliar interesting words 🎯 other words that go with a word you already know (showers as in rain ==> frequent showers) 🎯 surprising combinations (kiss ON the lips, not to the lips or in the lips). 💥 Practice different kinds of reading: 🎯 read quickly, skimming the text to find out what it is about (for example, checking if a link on Google search is helpful or not). 🎯 read quickly, looking for specific facts or numbers (check if a Facebook post mentioning application design talks about User Experience and is of interest to you). 🎯 read for specific details (for example, study a post by a recruiter to find out if your experience matches the requirements for the job offer). What kinds of reading are you doing already? Share in the comments! (If you don't want to write about reading, you can just say something about how cute this cat is! I don't have a better picture for this post 😁) ________________ I'm Irina, and I help expat professionals like you succeed with confidence in English-speaking with environments.

Is it time for you to break out of your comfort zone to qualify for diverse global IT projects that require exceptional English proficiency of their team members? For IT professionals aiming to elevate their English communication skills, stepping out of their comfort zone is imperative. Here are four tips to challenge yourself and make remarkable progress. ✅ Immerse Yourself in English Media 📺 Allocate at least 30 minutes daily to watching English TV shows, listening to podcasts, or reading articles in your field of expertise. Choose content slightly above your comfort level to stretch your comprehension and vocabulary. Why It Works: This immersion tactic familiarizes you with industry-specific jargon and improves your listening and reading skills through contextual learning. Exposure to varied accents and speaking speeds in media will enhance your auditory processing capabilities, making real-world conversations less daunting. ✅ Engage in Language Exchange Meetups Join language exchange groups or meetups within the IT community. Commit to attending sessions regularly, where you can practice conversational English in a supportive environment. Why It Works: Engaging with peers looking to improve their English offers a unique learning opportunity in a less formal, more forgiving setting. Such interactions can boost your confidence, encourage you to speak more freely and provide immediate feedback or corrections in a practical context. ✅ Take on Public Speaking or Presentations Volunteer for opportunities to present in English at team meetings, workshops, or local meetups. Start with small, internal audiences and gradually increase the stakes as you become more comfortable as a speaker. Why It Works: Public speaking is a powerful tool for overcoming the fear of making mistakes in front of others. It forces you to organize your thoughts clearly and concisely in English, improving fluency and your ability to convey complex ideas effectively. ✅ Write, Then Write Some More ✍️ Start a technical blog in English or contribute articles to existing platforms. Focus on topics related to your work or interests in the IT field. Why It Works: Writing regularly in English challenges you to think deeply about grammar, vocabulary, and the clarity of your ideas. You can monitor a tangible record of your progress and areas for improvement, allowing for targeted learning. Plus, receiving feedback from readers can be incredibly valuable for honing your skills. By following these tips, IT professionals can significantly enhance their English communication skills, opening doors to global opportunities and collaborations. Remember, stepping outside your comfort zone and embracing the discomfort of learning is the key to success. Here's to your journey towards becoming an exceptional English communicator in the global IT arena!\n\n#I am a working professional in back-office operations. I am not able to crack interviews because of low confidence in English Communication and this results in huge opportunity loss. I believe that if I had learnt English Communication at the starting of my career, I would have got better career options. #How many of you would agree that you have been in this situation at some point in your life? Although I faced a lot of challenges in my school days, I was fortunate enough to create an environment for myself to work on my English, which helped me become better at the start of my career. However, everyone in the job market has their own journey and struggles. It doesn't matter what you have done in the past, but it is very important how you approach now, what you are going to do now, that matters the most. Many professionals working in the back-office struggle because of a lack of confidence in English. This has become a barrier to getting through job interviews and seizing valuable opportunities. So, what needs to be done? Self-reflection must be the starting point until you realize what you have done and what you need to do to achieve better results. This comes from realizing that investing time and money in improving your English skills earlier could have opened up a world of opportunities and different career options. *Here are some steps to enhance your English communication skills and boost your confidence for successful interviews: 1️⃣ Immerse Yourself: Surround yourself with English content - read articles, books, and blogs, watch movies or TV shows, and listen to podcasts. This exposure will help you become more comfortable with the language's nuances. 2️⃣ Practice Regularly: Practice makes perfect! Engage in daily conversations in English, whether it's with friends, family, or even by participating in online language exchange platforms. The more you practice, the more confident you'll become. 3️⃣ Online Learning Platforms: Explore online platforms like Duolingo, Babbel, or even YouTube tutorials tailored for English learners. These platforms offer structured lessons to improve grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. 4️⃣ Join Language Classes: Consider enrolling in formal English language classes, either in-person or online. Professional guidance can provide targeted support and feedback to address specific areas of improvement.
