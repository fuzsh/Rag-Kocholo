Following the Polish-Soviet agreement of 30 July 1941, he was released and rejoined the Polish Army as a member of the 5th Wilenski Field Artillery Regiment, 5th Kresowa Infantry Division, which joined the British 8th Army in October 1942. He subsequently served in the Middle East 1942-44 and in Italy 1944-46 and, as cited above, was awarded the M.M. for his courage at Monte Cassino and in later operations.

Captain Zieleźnik immediately volunteered to recce the other bank, accompanied by one A.O.R. with an L.M.G., he crossed the 500x of river in bright moonlight not knowing if the enemy were holding the far bank.\n\nOn arrival on the far bank he found a possible landing place, sent a message back and then accompanied by his Bren gunner only, made a detailed reconnaissance of the whole bridgehead area.\n\nAs a result of this reconnaissance, the job of the leading flights of troops was simplified and the crossing completed well ahead of their schedule.\n\nCaptain Zieleźnik's cold blooded courage in crossing in the bright moonlight accelerated the completion of a very hazardous operation, he set the finest example to his own Company, who crossed in the van in record time so keen were they to get to the support of their Company Commander whom they knew was alone on the other side.\n\nWithout Captain Zieleźnik's performance it is probable that the whole operation would have been delayed and the enemy, who were found 1000x from the bridgehead at 0400 hours would have withdrawn unhindered.\n\nAs it was, the enemy were located and Captain Zieleźnik's Company came under fire and immediately pursued the enemy with the bayonet.\n\nCasualties were inflicted on the enemy, who promptly withdrew in some confusion, so complete was the surprise achieved by the crossing\".\n\nRecommended by : Lieutenant Colonel John Anthony Jarvis Read.
