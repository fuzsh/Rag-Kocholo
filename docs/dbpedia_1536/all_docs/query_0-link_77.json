First of all, I would like to thank my ﬁrst cousin Jozef Mazgaj and his brother Jan Mazgaj, both now deceased, and my younger brother, Klemens Mazgaj, for their recollections and the important materials they provided, which they mailed to me from Poland. I am also grateful to my comrades-in-arms, Colonel Witold Jozefowski (“Mis”), Lieutenant Zdzislaw Rachtan (“Halny”), Dr. Zbigniew Kabata (“Bobo”), Dr. Piotr Sierant (“Marian”), Jan Osemlak (“Straceniec”), Wlodzimierz Gruszczynski (“Jach”), Jozef Bojanowski (“Walter”), Jan Bojanowski (“Michal”), and Krystyna Bronikowska Radlinska for sharing with me their knowledge of certain aspects of our mutual struggle in ﬁghting the Nazi forces in Poland. In placing numerous events in time and space, I am greatly indebted to the writings of Dr. Piotr Matusak, Dr. Piotr Sierant, Eugeniusz Dabrowski (“Pliszka”), Wlodzimierz Gruszczynski, Dr. Mieczyslaw Korczak (“Dentysta”), and Capitan Henryk Kuksz (“Selim”). I owe sincere words of gratitude to my dear wife, Mildred Juanita, for letting me, at times, spread out the pages of my manuscript not only in our library but also in other rooms of our home. I am very grateful to Dr. Kabata (“Bobo”) for his constant encouragement during my work on my memoir. As a commanding ofﬁcer of our machine gun platoon, he wrote to me, saying: “Marian, at your last post, as a soldier of the Home Army, you must write your recollections of our ﬁght against Nazism in World War II.” I am also greatly indebted to Mrs. Robin Giesey for her excellent work in editing and typing the ﬁnal draft of the manuscript.\n\nvii\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nCONTENTS Acknowledgments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vii Preface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nPart One: Before World War II Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n\n1.

When my comrade-in-arms Kazimierz Stobinski (“Piorun”) and I returned from the war in the second part of January 1945, I asked Piorun to enter my family’s farmhouse a few minutes before me to gently inform my parents and younger brothers and sisters that I was alive and well. Only after such a psychological preparation did I appear in the midst of my jubilant family. At that moment, all of us shed some tears of joy. As soon as the enemy was expelled from Poland, I continued my education. During my studies, which included high school, college, major seminary and university, I thought from time to time about writing something about my personal war experiences, which were still very vivid in my memory. However, the hostile attitude of the Polish Communist regime toward all of us who were former soldiers of the Home Army did not allow me to write anything that might incriminate me and my comrades-in-arms in the courts of Communist justice. When I left Poland in June 1957, I hoped to write and eventually publish an account of my World War II experiences in the United States. Soon after my arrival, I began classes in the graduate school of canon law at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. At that time, I gave some radio and television interviews about some of the Nazi and Communist crimes in Poland and began to write a number of articles for a Polish monthly publication. As the end of my ﬁrst semester was approaching, I found my graduate work more and more time consuming. I could not do anything else but attend classes and seminars, write term papers and study for exams. To improve my proﬁciency in English, I had to avoid speaking and writing in Polish as much as possible. Therefore, I postponed the writing of my World War II recollections until the end of the academic year. During my summer vacation in 1958, I wrote nine chapters telling of\n\n1\n\n2\n\nPREFACE\n\nmy experiences ﬁghting the Nazis as a member of the Sandomierz Flying Commando Unit, and I waited to publish them as a part of my memoirs. After completing my graduate studies at Catholic University, I accepted a teaching position at St. John Vianney Seminary in Bloomingdale, Ohio. I hoped that in the academic atmosphere of the seminary, I would be able to ﬁnd additional free time to continue work on my World War II recollections. Soon after I began teaching classes in canon law and theology, I discovered that preparation of my lectures and instruction took most of my time every day. On weekends I was asked to help in various parishes in the diocese of Steubenville. I found that my teaching, my writing a number of articles for publication on weekdays and my preaching on Sundays helped me to improve my English. Graduate studies in philosophy, which I began at the Catholic University and continued at Duquesne University, also greatly increased my knowledge of the English language. All I needed now was more free time to continue work on my World War II recollections. I did not get this free time until I resigned my teaching position at the seminary, after nine years of working there, and began teaching undergraduates at the McKeesport campus of Penn State University. In the spring of 1981, I completed most of the parts of the manuscript and wrote a short prologue. Then I began editing and typing various chapters, and I corrected and expanded some of the chapters and wrote some new ones. At that time, I began to realize that one of the beneﬁts of completing my manuscript after reaching the fullness of my physical and mental powers is that one acquires certain perspective from which some things in life are better seen, evaluated and appreciated. In the early stage of my writing, I intended to leave a written record of my life and my experiences in World War II for the beneﬁt of my family. But now, I hope that my work will also have some historical value for all those who will study more extensively various aspects of this tragic war, after which Europe is and will never be the same. Most of the history books written about World War II by professional historians for the general public and for graduate and postgraduate students of history provide general, basic facts and narrate central events without peripheral speciﬁcs, which can clarify and illustrate these facts and events. Therefore, credible personal accounts, written by those who took part in World War II — regardless of which side they fought on — who were eyewitnesses to particular aspects, are very valuable for contemporary and future historians. As time goes on, the value of the stories left by these witnesses, who cared to write their memoirs about World War II, will grow as survivors become fewer and fewer in number until they all are gone. In describing my prewar childhood, I attempted to capture the ethos and some distinct traditions of Polish villages and towns in the part of Poland\n\nPREFACE\n\n3\n\nwhere I was born and grew up. At the present time, this distinct ethos and these traditions are no longer noticeable. Villages are undergoing a gradual urbanization and small towns have already undergone radical changes because of the absence of Jewish people, who constituted a considerable majority of inhabitants in all of them. In discussing my World War II teenage years, I wrote about religious and cultural life in villages. I also wrote about the inhumane treatment of Jewish people by the Nazis. It appears to me that my generation was the last to observe and experience, somewhat, the cultural and social life of the landed gentry in the Polish country manors. This kind of life became extinct under the brutal rule of Communist dictators and most of the beautiful, historic mansions and the art objects, antiques, and libraries they contained were destroyed beyond repair. I took an active part in or I witnessed most of the military actions that I describe in chapters 3 through 25; I consider them the core of this work and the most important from an historical point of view. The chapters dealing with my education before and after the war shed some light on the staterun and church-run educational systems in Poland during those times. My recollections of the early years of my priestly work disclose the very difﬁcult conditions in which the Catholic Church operated under the Communist regime at a time when the church struggled for its very survival.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPart One: Before World War II\n\nINTRODUCTION During his recent visit to Poland, Pope Benedict XVI quoted Goethe in his native language: “Wer der Dichter will verstehen, muss in Dichters Lande gehen” (Whoever wants to understand the poet, must go to the poet’s land). Strictly speaking, the “poet” in this case was Pope John Paul II and, in an extended sense, the poetic people of Poland and their tragic history. This quotation came to my mind when I was about to write an introduction to a very small fragment of World War II Polish history. I realize that most of my readers will not be able to visit Poland. Nevertheless, as they read what I wrote they will vicariously and spiritually visit the country and thus better understand some aspects of Poland’s experiences in World War II. This is my sincere intention and profound wish. In describing various essential and incidental events, which occurred before, during, and after the war, I will take my readers to various locations in Poland. One of these locations is the small village of Gaj, where I was born, in my parents’ farmhouse, on December 8, 1923. I was baptized several weeks later as Marian Stanislaus at St. Stanislaus Church in Osiek. My parents were Jozef Aleksander Mazgaj and Jozefa Soja Mazgaj. My paternal grandparents were Antoni Aleksander and Marianna Danida Bogdanski Mazgaj and my maternal grandparents Tomasz and Tekla Korzon Soja. The village of Gaj is located in the parish of Osiek and the district of Sandomierz. In searching for my paternal roots, I discovered that one of my ancestors, Jakob Mazgajski, was born in 1772 in the part of Poland that was eventually occupied by Austria. As a young man he became a freedom ﬁghter during an uprising against the Austrian government. The uprising failed and he was forced to leave that part of the country and seek refuge in the part of Poland occupied by Russia. At that juncture of his life, Jacob changed his original name from Mazgajski to Mazgaj, which means, in old Polish, an anointed forest.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nPART ONE : BEFORE WORLD WAR II\n\nDuring my early infancy, my parents and our young maid, Teoﬁla, took care of me. At the age of three and half, I lost my dear mother. She had a miscarriage and suffered from a postpartum infection. At that time there was no penicillin. Before my father remarried, Miss Teoﬁla took care of me for about one year. Then, my father married Miss Anna Bernacki from Osieczko, near Osiek, with whom he had four daughters and ﬁve sons. He had almost as many children as his father, who had two daughters and nine sons. So I had the privilege of growing up as the oldest son in a family of ten children. At the age of seven, I studied catechism with a parish priest and received my solemn First Holy Communion at our parish church in Osiek. At the same time, I began to attend the ﬁrst grade of our elementary school in Osiek, where about 50 percent of my classmates were Jewish children. Most of my Jewish classmates studied Hebrew on Saturdays when the rest of us had regular classes in our school. The parents of my Jewish classmates were members of an Orthodox synagogue and most of them were storekeepers, shoemakers, tailors, goldsmiths, carpenters, glaziers, and bakers. As a rule, the Jewish inhabitants of Osiek did not farm. While I attended the elementary school in Osiek, I developed a friendship with one of the Jewish boys in my class. We enjoyed building little cars out of his grandfather’s spent tailor’s spools. His mother was very happy about our friendship and always offered us snacks made out of her home-baked matzo. Another classmate who became my friend was named Marzec. He was from the village of Mikolajow, which was mostly inhabited by German farmers, who, I believe, were not Polish citizens. They had their own Lutheran church and elementary school. Their church services and school instructions were conducted in German. To satisfy my curiosity about the German farmers and their way of life, my friend invited me to his home and gave me a tour of their village. During one of my recent visits to Poland I visited Mikolajow and attempted to ﬁnd my elementary school friend. He was no longer there, and the Germans were all gone. During the early part of World War II, the Nazi administration transferred them to larger and better farms forcefully taken from Polish farmers in Gerlachow and Mokoszyn. From there they returned to their fatherland ahead of the withdrawing Nazi armed forces in 1944. My friend’s younger sister, who still lives on her parents’ farm in Mikolajow, told me that some of the descendents of the German farmers came recently from Germany to visit the village and to seek a legal way of securing their ancestors’ farms. After completing three years of elementary school in Osiek, my father leased our farm in Gaj and we moved to his mother’s farm in Jeziory, where he was born and grew up. Two of his older brothers and their families also lived in Jeziory. From that time on, I continued my elementary education at\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nthe grade school in Sulislawice. A number of my older cousins attended the same school. For one reason or another, the school in Sulislawice opened up new horizons in my education. It stimulated my interest in science and history and guided me to its library and the community’s library and made me an avid reader of Polish, French, English and Russian classics. I read the works of Jules Verne, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas (both father and son), some works of Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky, Robert Louis Stevenson, James Fenimore Cooper, all of them in Polish translations, as well as works by Polish writers such as Sienkiewicz, Prus, Reymont, Zeromski, Mickiewicz, Orzeszkowa, and others. At the same time, I began collecting stamps and pictures of Polish kings and national heroes. On the practical level, the school taught me book binding, gasiﬁcation of coal, and the ability to build a simple electric battery. The school’s intellectual stimulation lead me to design a prototype helicopter, on which I spent many hours trying to solve the problem of controlling the torque. Miss Julia Podolski, who was our school’s principal, and Mr. Jan Pater, who followed her in this position, were outstanding educators. As such they left an indelible academic and ethical mark on their students. When I was in the seventh grade, our class, under the leadership of our teachers, went on a week-long excursion to various historic castles, churches, and other monuments. At the end of the seventh grade, I began to take some private enrichment classes in preparation for an entrance examination to high school. An unemployed teacher, Mr. Staszewski, was my instructor. At that time, high schools were located only in larger cities. Therefore, those of us who intended to attend one of them had to live away from home and had to pay tuition and also room and board, which were rather expensive in those days. In order to earn some money for my high school education I picked cherries on about twenty trees, which belonged to two of our neighbors. I picked cherries every day and sold them to fruit sellers in Klimontow. The fruit sellers were clever businessmen who often managed to take advantage of me. Therefore, my proﬁts were often marginal. Before I registered for the entrance examination at the Jan Tarnowski State High School, in Tarnobrzeg, my father consulted with the principal, Mr. Smrokowski, and the parish priest, Father Jan Budzinski. I accompanied my father to the consultations but was not present at the meetings. After we returned home, my father gave a report to my stepmother about the consultations. He said that the principal encouraged him to enroll me in high school but the pastor advised my father against it. The pastor said what I needed was to learn a trade. Therefore, my father took the advice of Father Budzinski and gave up the idea of my high school education. The priest’s advice was a let down for me. I liked carpentry and blacksmithing. I made my own skis\n\n8\n\nPART ONE : BEFORE WORLD WAR II\n\nand a hunting knife. I was able to ﬁx shoes and mend clothing. I enjoyed working on the farm, but after reading so many books by Polish and foreign authors, I was hungry for a broader knowledge than a trade could provide. My thirst for formal learning was too great to be quenched by a trade. I was increasingly unhappy with rural conditions of life. The dreams and aspirations of my classmates centering on farming and marriage sounded trivial to me. I needed broader horizons and higher aspirations. I refused to speak the local dialect and spoke the language of the books, which I read day after day. I had a feeling that soon I would leave my family and friends and continue my education. In the spring of 1938 I was still taking enrichment classes, even though I was losing hope of applying for admission to high school in the fall. At the same time, the winds of war were growing stronger and stronger. On March 12, 1938, the Nazi army of Germany marched into Austria. The socalled Anschluss (Connection) became a painful reality. A few days later, on March 17, the Polish government of Marshall Edward Smigly-Rydz issued an ultimatum to the government of Lithuania demanding a normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries in two weeks. Soon thereafter, the government of Czechoslovakia ordered a partial mobilization of its military forces as a response to Hitler’s desire to annex the Sudetenland. The Nazi war hysteria, which was directed toward German acquisition of Lebensraum (living space) from neighboring countries, infected the minds of the Polish political leadership. Marshall Smigly-Rydz demanded colonies for his country and warned the colonial nations that if colonies were not given to Poland in a peaceful way, he was ready to use force. When Hitler invited the general to join him in partitioning Czechoslovakia, he responded enthusiastically. The spirit of this kind of international adventurism was promoted by nationalistic propaganda both in Germany and in Poland. In such an atmosphere, young men and even teenage boys began to talk about war every day. Whenever I joined my peers on Sundays, we always talked about our desire to ﬁght the enemies of our country, especially Nazi Germany. We never doubted our nation’s ability to win. Sometimes we wished that the Nazis would attack us so we could show them our military superiority and heroism. During the ﬁnal months of 1938, Polish police agents uncovered a secret shortwave radio station, which was operated by German colonists in the tower of the Lutheran church in the village of Mikolajow. In the meantime, I received an application from the State Junior Air Force Academy in Krasno, which provided general and military education at the expense of the government. After submitting my application accompanied by references and numerous documents, I was acceptable to the academy. However, I could not enroll in September 1938 on account of my age — I was short three months. Therefore, I was advised by the school administration\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nto enroll in September 1939. While waiting for the enrollment, I helped my father in his work on our farm while I kept reading books from the community’s library and studying a language called Esperanto, which was supposed to become an international language. Following the harvest of 1938, I found more time to read a daily newspaper and walked to the post ofﬁce in Sulislawice to get it. The more I read, the more I desired to go back to school and study. More than ever before, I lived in two worlds: the world of a small village where everything revolved around farming and the world of books, newspapers, magazines, learning, and culture. My body was in the ﬁrst world but my mind was in the second. I never felt at home in our village and farm life no longer appealed to me. I could not imagine myself living the life of a farmer. My continuous reading of books and newspapers made me a displaced person of sorts, a stranger in the middle of my family and the village. In the meantime, I tried to help my father with farm work as much as possible. I also gave him a hand in digging trenches, which were designed to improve the quality of the soil on our farm. On Sunday afternoons, I used to join a group of boys from our village and go to one of the neighboring villages to meet girls our age. A group of girls usually waited for us. We met with them for two or three hours and engaged them in lighthearted conversation. We never dated on a one-to-one basis. On the way home from such dates, we sang songs proper for the occasion. This gave us an outlet for our youthful feelings and fantasies. It was a healthy celebration of life. The headlines of the newspapers spoke continuously about tragic political events, which were preparing the political atmosphere for a major international conﬂict. The dark clouds of war were gathering on the horizon of Europe.\n\n1. THE CLOUDS\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nDuring the fall and winter of 1938, I helped my father on our farm. Almost every evening, I read books and newspapers. From time to time, I listened to the news on our neighbor’s radio. Mr. Wojciech Podsiadly was the only person in our village who had a very primitive radio. Since there was no electricity in the village, his crystal radio had to have a long antenna and earphones. Our neighbor knew of my interest in national and international news, so he invited me on Sundays to listen to his radio, which had two sets of earphones. Both the newspaper I read daily and the radio I listened to on Sundays spoke about Hitler’s preparations for war and his desire to expand the territory of Germany at the expense of Poland. In the ﬁnal months of 1938 the government’s police agents uncovered a secret shortwave radio station, which was operated in the tower of the Lutheran church in the village of Mikolajow. The village was 99 percent inhabited by German colonists, some of whom obviously became spies for Nazi Germany. The radio station was seized by police and the Nazi agents were arrested. This local news item increased suspicion and vigilance toward all German villages in our area The attitude of the local farmers began to change not only toward the German minority but also toward all ethnic minorities, including Jews. Rumors began to spread that in case of Hitler’s attack on Poland, the German ethnic groups were not only to spy for the Nazis but also to perform acts of sabotage in mills, factories, and so forth. One of the acts of sabotage was supposed to be poisoning of wells near the roads by which army units were to pass. At the end of 1938 our area witnessed an unusual activity. Stone, sand, and other materials were accumulated for building a highway, which appeared to have a strategic purpose in case of war. At the same time preparations were made for construction of a bridge across the Vistula River near the city of Baranow. These two activities were a part of the same project, which was sponsored by the central government.\n\n10\n\n1. THE CLOUDS\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\n11\n\nAs soon as the early spring of 1939 came, frantic construction of the highway and the bridge began. Local farmers were requested to report with their horses and wagons to various construction sites, where they were engaged in hauling stones, sand, and lumber. This hurried construction conﬁrmed people’s thinking about the nearness of war. When the construction of the highway and the bridge were nearing completion, the people of the area could not believe their own eyes when they saw that the wooden guard rails on each side of the highway and the bridge itself were painted white. Soon the local government issued an order to paint all bridges and guard rails white. Even the farmers were encouraged to use white paint in painting their barns and fences. People began to laugh at the stupidity or naïveté of their government. They were convinced that the Nazis inﬁltrated the government and issued orders to paint things white so that, in case of war, the Nazi pilots could easily spot them. This policy and others indicated more and more to the local people that the Polish government was slowly losing control over its own destiny. Nevertheless, its propaganda repeated, like a broken record, the same slogans on readiness to ﬁght the Nazis in defense of the fatherland. When we seeded our ﬁelds in the spring of 1939, my father prayed, as he always did, that we may enjoy a successful harvest. Sometimes as the war hysteria reached its peak, my father and I wondered if we would be the ones to celebrate this year’s harvest. As the spring ended, the crops reached an abundant growth promising an exceptionally good harvest. At the same time rumors of a general mobilization began to circulate. Many young farmers in our area, who were subject to mobilization, were anxious to ﬁnish their harvest before they were called. I regretted the fact that I was not old enough to join the army. For one reason or another, I did not hear anything from the Air Force Academy. I suppose military preparations took a precedence over academic concerns of the air force. Soon harvest time came and mobilization was not called. Our family and other farm families in our area worked very hard to ﬁnish the harvest as soon as possible. One could not have asked for better weather. It was warm and dry. Therefore, in the beginning of August, the grain was stored in barns and thrashing began. At the same time the ﬁrst mobilization letters reached our village. At ﬁrst, only a few men received them but then more men were called day after day. The ﬁrst mobilization letters were issued on August 24, 1939. I will never forget the departure of the ﬁrst group of men from our village. They received their mobilization letters in the afternoon of that day and departed for their units in the early evening. Farmers with the best horses and wagons in the village were assigned to transport them to the railroad station in Sandomierz or to the army base, also in Sandomierz. As they were leaving,\n\n12\n\nPART ONE : BEFORE WORLD WAR II\n\nthey did not indulge in long good-byes. They did not want their mothers and wives to cry in their presence. They just hugged and kissed their dear ones, jumped in the wagons, and were gone. I had tears in my eyes not because they went to war but because I could not go with them to ﬁght the Nazis. From the day the ﬁrst contingent of men from our village responded to the general mobilization, the local stores became crowded with customers who were buying large quantities of salt, sugar, kerosene, among other necessities. Soon there were shortages of these things in every store. In the second part of August, the outbreak of war was anticipated from day to day. Our parish church was crowded on Sundays more than ever before. Older people who remembered the evils of World War I, and women and children prayed for peace. Most of the young men, excited by the government’s propaganda, welcomed war as a chance to prove to the world that, unlike Czechoslovakia and Austria, Poland was determined to ﬁght Nazi Germany and win. In spite of the ongoing mobilization, the war hysteria in the newspapers and on the radio decreased for some reason in late August and one could experience a certain calmness, a calmness that in nature precedes a storm.\n\nPart Two: The Time of War\n\n2. THE BEGINNING WORLD WAR II\n\nOF\n\nCall to Arms I will never forget the early morning of September 1, 1939. One of the men from our village, who was assigned that week as a night watchman, came to our house, pounded on the door, and told us that the Germans had attacked Poland. He also told us that a man and a woman came to our village during the night and, shouting on the top of their voices, encouraged people to ﬂee east from the German army. They gave him the impression that the German troops were approaching the city of Staszow, which was about twenty miles west of our village. They were unknown to him, perfect strangers, and did not give their names. Later we discovered that they were Nazi agents, ﬁfth columnists, planted to create confusion and disorder among the people, who would clog the roads so the Polish army would be impeded in its movements. When the night watchman woke us up, it must have been about four o’clock in the morning. It was still dark. My father, who had fought the Germans in World War I, made an instant decision to secure some emergency provisions for our family. He asked me to follow him to the tool shed, where we picked up our shovels, and then he told me of his plan, which called for digging a deep hole in our backyard in which we were to hide some grain and other nonperishable provisions. Before sunrise, we buried the emergency provisions, winter clothes, some shoes, and family valuables. After we completed the work, my mother served us an early breakfast. In the meantime, my ﬁrst cousin, Jan Mazgaj, who was three years my senior, and I talked the situation over and decided to volunteer for the army. When Jan’s friend, Waclaw Kos, came to see us, we talked him into joining us in our venture. Then each of us went home to get some blankets, extra clothing, and food. After Jan and I were ready to go, we walked to Waclaw’s\n\n13\n\n14\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nhome. He waited for us. One of his brothers was a military policeman on active duty and the other one was just mobilized; therefore, Waclaw’s father was not happy to see him go. From Waclaw’s home we walked to the city of Sandomierz, where a part of the Second Regiment of Infantry had its permanent base.1 After reporting there we were told that the regiment was on its way to the front. It left Sandomierz on August 29, 1939, under the command of Colonel Ludwik Czyzewski and was deployed near the possible front. The military personnel left at the base advised us to join one of the regiments stationed across the Vistula River in the eastern part of the country. At the Sandomierz regimental base, we met a group of young men, about ten in number, from Osiek who also attempted to join the regiment. They included Stanislaw Ostrowski, Stefan Kitlinski, and Edmund Kopciowski. They too were advised to go east across the river. Since Jan and I knew some of them, we decided to join their group in search of a military unit, which would accept us and issue us uniforms and riﬂes. As soon as we crossed the Vistula River, we discovered that hundreds and hundreds of young men like us had walked east with the same burning desire to join a military unit and ﬁght the Nazis. In addition, we discovered thousands of men, women, and children of all ages who had left their homes carrying the most valuable of their possessions and heading east for fear of the Germans. Most of them walked, some rode bicycles, and a very few used motorcycles or cars as a mode of transportation. These two motorized types of vehicles were often abandoned on the road, broken down or without gas. From time to time, German bombers ﬂew over us to drop their loads on bridges, railroads, mills, factories, cities, and towns. They also bombed military columns as they moved toward the front. We could hear distant explosions. Here and there columns of smoke appeared on the horizon. If I am not mistaken, we spent our ﬁrst night in the pine forest near the city of Stalowa Wola, a newly developed industrial city, which was bombed in the morning. We slept on the ground using pine needles as our mattresses. We were awakened in the middle of the night by riﬂe ﬁre and shouts “Inﬁltrators! Spies! Apprehend them!” There was a commotion among the people in the forest. People ran in all directions in an attempt to catch the alleged inﬁltrators. Due to the excitement, no one could sleep to the end of the night. In the morning we were told that a small detachment of soldiers who guarded an ammunition depot ﬁred at the German ﬁfth-column agents dressed in Polish military uniforms who attempted to blow it up. In the morning we continued walking east toward the city of Janow Lubelski. The number of refugees increased tremendously. Army vehicles rode in the middle of the road and refugees marched on its sides. As we passed\n\n2. THE BEGINNING\n\nOF\n\nWORLD WAR II\n\n15\n\nthrough towns and villages we replenished our water supply. In some cases there was no more water in wells. Food also became scarce. From time to time Nazi pilots bombed and machine-gunned people on the road. This created a considerable panic. As soon as we heard the sound of airplanes, we looked for cover under trees and bushes. At ﬁrst we did not see anybody killed. We saw military convoys destroyed and horses killed. Toward the end of the day, we noticed both military and civilian casualties. The tragic reality of war began to come over us. Nevertheless, each time we met a group of soldiers we asked whether we could join them. The answer was always the same, “We have no authority to recruit anybody, we hardly have enough weapons for ourselves.” Some soldiers had no military uniforms, just army hats. Others had uniforms but no hats. Only a few wore helmets. Something was terribly wrong with the general mobilization. Somebody had failed our patriotic young men who offered their lives to defend the fatherland. In a small town where we stopped to stay for the night, to wash dust from our bodies and to replenish our water supply, I noticed a group of about one hundred infantry men. They stood in line to get their dinner, which was just cooked in a ﬁeld kitchen. I watched the servicemen approach the cook and receive their portions. I spotted the ofﬁcer and went to ask him about the possibility of joining the unit. The answer was, “No.” He gave me the same explanation I heard from the other ofﬁcers before. He was very sympathetic toward me but he could not do a thing. By the time I ﬁnished my conversation with the ofﬁcer, the line of soldiers waiting for the dinner became very short so I went to the end of the line and waited my turn. I carried a large tin cup on me and held it out to receive a portion of food from the cook. He noticed that I was a civilian, hesitated for a moment, and then gave it to me. When I looked closer at the food I realized it was mashed potatoes. Poor provisions I thought. How in the world can our army ﬁght a war against Nazi Germany on mashed potatoes? In the morning we kept marching east. As we were coming closer to Janow Lubelski, we saw more and more military equipment abandoned on the road. Some equipment was destroyed by the Nazi bombs and some was still usable but the horses that pulled it were killed. For the ﬁrst time in my life, I saw a Polish tank. It had run out of gas and was left on the side of the road. It was rather small, probably of World War I vintage. It was unlike the tanks pictured in the newspapers. After about one week of marching east, we came close to the city of Janow Lubelski. For the ﬁrst time since we left home, we could hear sounds of the German and Polish artillery behind us. It meant that the front line followed us. Soon we heard rumors that enemy tanks were spotted not far behind us. The Luftwaffe increased its activities from day to day. Fires appeared on\n\n16\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nthe entire horizon. We saw more and more panic among the refugees and the inhabitants of towns and villages we were passing through. Some of the local people joined us in a mass exodus. Others took food and their most valuable possessions and hid in the forests, which were plentiful in the area. The refugees also began to avoid streaming through towns as happened in the beginning. They looked for country roads. As we approached Janow Lubelski, our group decided to separate itself from the main body of refugees and go through the city. We were running out of food and hoped to buy it there. As we reached the suburbs, we were struck by an absence of people on the streets. Anticipating the imminent arrival of Nazi tanks, most of them left for the forest. Some were hiding in the basements of their houses and dugouts. By the time we came to the ﬁrst houses of the city proper, we had the feeling of being in a ghost town. Everything was so quiet and so still that we began to be disturbed by the sound of our shoes striking the stone pavement. All of a sudden a group of men appeared from behind a brick house. There were about six men in the group. They wore long black topcoats and black hats. One of them carried a loaf of bread on a tray and another a dish of salt, symbols of hospitality. They were representatives of the Jewish community in the city who waited to welcome the ﬁrst soldiers of the Nazi army entering the city. When they heard our footsteps on the street they thought we were the German soldiers. After discovering their mistake, they were embarrassed and returned behind the building to wait for the Germans. We proceeded through the abandoned streets of the city and soon gave up hope of buying food. All the stores were closed. After crossing Janow Lubelski, we rejoined the mass of refugees, which went around the city and walked east. Soon we came to a crossroads. One road led east toward the city of Zamosc and the other went north to the city of Krasnik. Some of the refugees kept walking straight toward Zamosc. Others, after being informed by the refugees from Janow Lubelski about a German panzer unit racing up from Przemy¢l, decided to go toward Krasnik and Lublin. Our group joined the refugees going in the direction of Lublin. We still hoped to join an army unit and did not want to be overrun by the Germans. It must have taken us two days to arrive near Krasnik. Instead of going through Krasnik, Jan, Waclaw, and I decided to split from our friends from Osiek and go into the countryside in search of food. We walked a few miles away from the road that led to Lublin and came to a village. The farmhouses in it were large and prosperous. When we entered one of the houses to buy a loaf of bread and cheese, the farmer and his wife asked us to sit at their kitchen table and offered us a free meal. They knew that we were hungry, thirsty, and tired and watched with joy how their good food disappeared from the table consumed by three growing men. After we ﬁnished our meal and\n\n2. THE BEGINNING\n\nOF\n\nWORLD WAR II\n\n17\n\nbought some food, we intended to continue our walk toward Lublin. But the farmer, who knew more than we did about the most recent movements of the German forces, advised us to stay put until the military activities passed by the area. He was very convincing and his arguments made sense. We took his advice. Even though the farmer and his wife offered us free meals during our stay with them, we offered to help them in the farm work. They were pleased with our offer and showed us the hay section of the barn where we could ﬁx our bedding. Sleeping on fresh hay reminded us so much of our homes. The following day we helped the farmer to thrash his rye. We were familiar with this type of work and the farmer was pleased with our exertions. The farmer’s wife cooked good meals and we enjoyed her cooking very much. We were happy with our decision to stay put for the time being. But after two days of our pleasant life on the farm things began to change. The news came to the village that the front line was approaching and that a number of Polish infantry and artillery units were dug in on the hills near Krasnik. The people in the village speculated that in case of battle, the village would be caught in the crossﬁre. Therefore, they began to pack their most important belongings, load them on farm wagons, and seek refuge in the nearby forest. We helped the family we stayed with pack their possessions and carried them to the wagon. Grain, food, bedding, clothes, and some furniture were stored away from the buildings in the dugout. The farmer and his wife encouraged us to leave the village with them and hide in the forest. We were grateful for the offer but since we were on the go for some time, we chose to stay in the village to thrash rye and guard the remaining property. The farmer told us that we were free to use the house. He also showed us where the food was and encouraged us to eat anything we wanted. Knowing that we were the sons of farmers, he trusted us with everything. By about nine o’clock in the morning, all the farmers and their families left the village. The three of us thrashed rye and could not quite ﬁgure out why the farmers left the village so hurriedly. Did they know something that we did not? Perhaps they knew for sure that the Polish units that occupied the positions on the hills near Krasnik would not pull out without a ﬁerce battle. Perhaps the village was burned during World War I when the Russians and Austrians fought each other in the very same area and the memory of it still lived in the minds of the older people. It was very quiet in the village after the villagers left. The sound of our thrashing was the only noise there. We had very little fear. At noon we took a break for lunch. There was still no sign of the approaching Germans. After lunch we went back to the barn to continue our work. Only then did we hear artillery ﬁre and the whizzing of shells over the village. The Polish artillery ﬁred ﬁrst. After a while the Germans responded and then an artillery duel\n\n18\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nfollowed. Some shells fell short of their targets and exploded in the village. None of them exploded near the barn in which we worked. However, the artillery battle continued and more shells exploded in the village, setting ﬁres. Several shells fell in the neighbor’s yard. At that point we began to fear that we might get hit by shrapnel. We left the barn and hid in the dugout. After staying there for a short while, we became convinced that the shells that fell on the village were no longer those that missed the target but they were purposely aimed there. The frequency of explosions in the village conﬁrmed the correctness of our conviction. No doubt we found ourselves in a very dangerous place. We quickly decided to leave the village and seek safety in the ﬁelds. After leaving the dugout, we dashed into the orchard and then opened a small gate near the barn and ran into the ﬁeld. We kept running to distance ourselves from the village as much as possible. Artillery shells continued to explode in the village one after another. We noticed that about a mile and a half from the village there was a grove of trees in the midst of barren ﬁelds, which appeared safe. Instinctively we rushed in the direction of the grove. We were halfway between the village and the grove when a number of the enemy’s bombers swept over the tops of the trees and opened up with machine-gun ﬁre. Fortunately, we were in a potato ﬁeld with deep furrows made by a cultivator between the rows of plants. As the bombers ﬂew over Krasnik and the surrounding hills where the units of Polish artillery were, they dropped bombs and machine-gunned the soldiers. The artillery commenced ﬁring at the bombers but since its pieces were placed on the hills and the airplanes ﬂew very low, its ﬁre was both ineffective and disastrous to the Polish infantry dug in the lower terrain. Refugees scattered along the main road. Soon more and more bombers appeared above us and silenced our artillery altogether. They became masters of the sky. Where was the Polish air force? Not even one airplane took off to ﬁght the Nazi intruders! After the bombers dropped their loads on Krasnik, which by this time was in ﬂames, they ﬂew around and around mowing down everybody in sight. There were about ﬁfteen Nazi bombers above us. Their machine-gun ﬁre was the most terrifying. Each time the airplanes ﬂew over us, the bullets whizzed by our ears and the dust of the dry ground indicated the spots they hit. They ﬂew in a pattern of a merry-go-round and were coming over us with their blazing machine guns in short intervals. I prayed to God for letting me survive this terrible danger and pushed my body in the furrow as deeply as I could. I never realized until then that a farmer’s cultivator, which made furrows between the rows of potato plants in the spring, might be so helpful in saving human life. The air raid lasted about one hour. When the bombers ﬂew away, we\n\n2. THE BEGINNING\n\nOF\n\nWORLD WAR II\n\n19\n\nremained in the potato ﬁeld for a while not knowing what to expect next. We thought that another group of bombers might come and continue the work of terror, destruction, and death. As we waited in uncertainty and lifted our heads up, we discovered that half of the horizon was on ﬁre. The city of Krasnik and neighboring towns and villages were being gutted by the conﬂagration. What a waste, I thought, as I looked around. The war began to show me its various faces — terrible faces. Since the air raid did not resume, we left the potato ﬁeld and walked toward the grove. After reaching it we decided to stay there for the night. It was quiet during the night but we could not sleep. The air raid was too fresh in our memory and tomorrow too precarious. In the morning some local people came to the woods and told us that Nazi panzer units had already occupied the whole area of Krasnik and controlled the main roads. There was no use for us to go any farther east. The Nazis were already ahead of us. It was time to return home. We felt disappointed and hurt for not being able to join the Polish army and ﬁght the enemy. The realization that our armed forces were not adequately prepared to defend the country from the Nazi aggression increased our pain and disappointment. We felt victimized not only by the Nazi invaders but also by our own government.\n\nReturning Home During the early hours of the day, we remained in the safety of the grove. We did not see any military activities in the surrounding ﬁelds but the sound of rolling tanks was coming continuously from the direction of the highway. Around noon we decided to start on the way home. As we began walking west, we did everything possible to avoid highways. It took us about three days to reach the Vistula River near the town of Zawichost. Those three days were rather uneventful. I don’t remember much about those days except the fact that we were hungry and raided farmers’ orchards for apples and plums. Our feet were full of blisters. We were tired and apathetic. Near Zawichost we joined others who, like us, were returning home. We crossed the Vistula River. On the bridge we met German soldiers for the ﬁrst time. They did not bother us at all. They ignored us. That is why from Zawichost on we chose to follow the main highway west. We were only one day’s walking distance from our village. As soon as we left Zawichost on our way to Sandomierz, we saw the ﬁrst German tanks. In comparison with the Polish tank we saw broken on the road near Janow Lubelski, they were huge and moved fast. It did not take me long to realize that the small and antiquated Polish tanks were no match for them. Once in Sandomierz, we rested for a while and replenished our water\n\n20\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nsupply and then continued our march toward Koprzywnica. This part of the highway was also busy with rolling tanks and heavy trucks. Some of the trucks carried soldiers in full combat gear. As we walked along the side of the highway, we observed with a great curiosity the well-ordered might of the enemy on the way to pursue and destroy the remnants of our army in the east. After reaching Koprzywnica we inquired about our village. We feared that it might be burned. The people we met assured us that our village was spared destruction although some artillery shells had exploded in the ﬁelds near it. Osiek, however, was burned to the ground. From Koprzywnica we proceeded toward our village by the back roads on which there were no German troops. The closer to home we came the more energy we gained. We missed our families and the comforts of our homes. It must have been about 8:00 P.M. when I entered the kitchen of our home. The family dinner was just over. Empty plates were still on the table. My father and stepmother rushed to me with tears in their eyes. They hugged me and kissed me and were happy to see me return home alive. My brothers and sisters looked up to me as if I were a hero of sorts. Before I ﬁnished washing the dust from my body, there was steaming food on the table. My stepmother knew that I was famished and she cautioned me not to eat too much at ﬁrst so I would not get sick. Our farm food and homemade bread tasted so good and I could not help but eat until I was not hungry anymore. The following day, I went into our ﬁelds to examine the craters made by the artillery shells. They were made by Polish artillery, which ﬁred at the approaching enemy. My parents and our neighbors told me about many fearful hours they spent in the dugouts during the shelling. Fortunately there was no damage to either the village, farm buildings, or life. However, some horses used by the Polish military units were killed and wounded. Some wounded horses dispersed into the ﬁelds and wooded areas around our village and grazed there. My Uncle Franek caught one of these horses and kept him in his orchard. The horse was wounded by fragments of bombs or artillery shells, which lodged themselves deep into its body. He was a huge Belgian horse used, most probably, by the artillery or transport unit. At ﬁrst he seemed to recover well but then infection set in and the horse died. Within several days after my return, I returned to work on our farm. In the evenings or on rainy days, I read books as ever before. Also, I borrowed from our neighbor’s son, Wacek Podsiadly, a basic German textbook and began to study the German language. I continued borrowing books from the library operated by the Savings and Loan Cooperative in Sulislawice. Each Sunday before mass, I returned the books I had read and after mass I selected new books. One Sunday as I went to the library to borrow some books, I was told by the librarian that the Nazis intended to conﬁscate the books in the\n\n2. THE BEGINNING\n\nOF\n\nWORLD WAR II\n\n21\n\nlibrary and, therefore, he asked the readers to take as many books as possible for the duration of the war. In two or three trips to the library, I brought home more than ﬁfty books I had never read before. If I am not mistaken, most of the best books were taken to the readers’ homes. When I ﬁnished reading all the books I had taken home, I began exchanging books with other readers who, like me, stored a portion of the library books in their homes. Later on, my ﬁrst cousin, Jan, Uncle Franek’s son, stored some books from a library in Starachowice and let me use them as much as I wanted. The books he stored included complete works of the best Polish novelists and poets. No wonder I spent every free moment of time reading and studying.\n\nSalvaging Arms at Baranow Bridge One Sunday afternoon at the end of September or in the beginning of October 1939, I joined a group of boys from our village in an excursion to the site of the strategic bridge near the city of Baranow. The bridge, which Polish authorities built in a hurry just before the Nazi aggression, spanned the Vistula River. In order to stop Polish troops from moving east, Nazi bombers attempted to destroy the bridge, but their bombs missed the target over and over again. The bridge survived until the morning of September 9. On that day Polish troops, which guarded the bridge, noticed a number of German tanks enter the village of Swiniary so they blew up a section of it.2 Then they discovered that many of the Polish units still remained on the western side of the Vistula River. The critical situation of these units forced them not only to repair the bridge but also to build a new temporary bridge. On September 11 and 12 most of the Polish units under the leadership of General Sadowski, which were trapped by the Germans in that area, crossed the Vistula River. However, some of the units under the same command were unable to make it to the bridge. These units were forced to cross the river at its shallow points, leaving behind wagons of provisions, weapons, and ammunition. The boys in the group I joined that Sunday were driven by a patriotic desire to salvage some of the abandoned weapons and ammunition, hide them, and eventually use them against the Nazis. It took us about two hours to reach the area of the bridge. On the way we examined a Polish cannon abandoned on the side of the road. It was in excellent condition, but its essential part, the breech, was missing. When we came to the bridge area we were very disappointed. Riﬂes and machine guns, which we hoped to ﬁnd there in abundance, were all gone. Even broken ones were already salvaged.3 What we found were countless boxes of riﬂe ammunition, explosives, artillery shells, and fuses. We loaded our pockets with riﬂe\n\n22\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nammunition and took some fuses. On our way home, we went across the ﬁelds to avoid the Nazis patrolling the area. On my return home, I concealed the ammunition and fuses in our barn. My father did not know anything about it. From time to time, I examined my military “treasure” and put it away again. I took apart some of the riﬂe cartridges and studied their content. They differed somewhat from one another. Some were simple projectiles. Others were tracers with short-tempered steel cores to be ﬁred at heavier armor. The artillery fuses, which were to arm projectiles, were of two types, long and short. They puzzled me, but I did not know how to take them apart without risking their exploding in my hands. So I waited for somebody who could explain their functioning to me. As it happened, I did not have to wait too long for a specialist in these types of fuses. My ﬁrst cousin, Jozef Mazgaj, who, before the war began, was drafted into the Polish navy, had just returned home from the war. Before the war, as a trained specialist, he worked in a military ammunition plant in Rembertow near Warsaw. When I mentioned to him something about the fuses, he wanted to see them right away. I brought him only two of them. He recognized them and told me that they were produced in his plant. In explaining them to me, he cautioned me about the danger they presented to a person who handled them. Then he told me that the long fuses were meant for projectiles to be ﬁred at airplanes and the short ones for the ground targets. After these preliminary explanations, he took me to his father’s shop, took the fuses apart, and showed me how they worked step by step. I was grateful to him for sharing his professional knowledge with me. He was a ﬁne teacher. From that moment on, he was my teacher of applied physics. I watched him work in the shop for hours and helped him build a muzzle-loader shotgun from scratch. Besides my ﬁrst cousin, Jozef, a number of my other relatives returned to their parents’ homes on account of the war. Since they had some inﬂuence on my life, in one way or another, I must say a few words about each of them. Jozef ’s wife, Maria, came with him from Rembertow, where they lived for a number of years before the war began. Jozef and Maria had no children. Since Jozef worked in the government’s ammunition plant, with the arrival of the Nazis in Poland there was nothing for him to do in Rembertow. The comfortable life and bright future he and his wife enjoyed collapsed. If I am not mistaken, Maria was employed by some company, possibly PPG, in Warsaw. A very intelligent, beautiful, and kind person, she was a great asset to the Mazgaj family. Jozef and Maria lived with Uncle Franek for about one year. Later on, they rented an apartment of their own. Jan Mazgaj-Marglewski, son of my Uncle Wladyslaw, worked as a teacher in a grade school in the western part of Poland. As an army ofﬁcer, he was\n\n2. THE BEGINNING\n\nOF\n\nWORLD WAR II\n\n23\n\nmobilized shortly before the outbreak of the war and took part in the war from its very inception. Then he fought the Nazis during the siege of Warsaw to the very end. After the capitulation of Warsaw, he managed to avoid being taken by the enemy as a POW and safely returned to his parents’ farm. He was still single and lived with his parents until his arrest by the SS in the spring of 1943. During many lonely evenings, Jan played the violin to entertain his parents and visitors. Antoni Mazgaj-Marglewski, Jan’s younger brother, was also mobilized before the war. He was a college-educated person and worked as an ofﬁcial of some government agency in Katowice. Like his brother, Jan, he was a reserve ofﬁcer and fought the invaders during the month of September 1939. After the German and Russian armies overran Poland, Antoni returned to Jeziory and stayed with his parents until he joined an underground unit of the Home Army. He also played the violin and enjoyed reading. Stanislaw Mazgaj-Marglewski, my Uncle Wladyslaw’s youngest son, returned home from college at the end of June 1939 for his summer vacation and also stayed home with his parents. His older brothers ﬁnanced his education but he experienced considerable difﬁculties in his studies. Stanislaw resided with his parents until the end of the war. The return to Jeziory of Jozef and my other cousins gave me a chance to learn not only military things but also explore some subjects taught on the college level. In my conversations with them, I was exposed to some Greek and Roman literature and German literature but, most of all, to an academic analysis of Polish writers whose works I had read during my grade school years. I attribute my initial acquaintance with Latin and German to the association with them. They also helped me to develop an idea of what life in large cities was all about.\n\n3. THE FIRST STAGE OF THE NAZI OCCUPATION The New Order In spite of the Nazi occupation, life in our village was almost normal at ﬁrst. But as soon as the potatoes were harvested, the Nazi government issued an order commanding each farmer to deliver so much grain, potatoes, milk, eggs, pork, and beef to its warehouses. In order to prevent the farmers from butchering cattle and hogs, the government sent its agents to tag and register every single farm animal. The tags, made of metal, were attached to the animals’ ears. A village head was responsible for the farmers’ compliance with the government’s order. In our county, the government’s agents enlisted the help of SS men in persuading the heads of the villages to be dutiful in exercising their authority. During a meeting of the county’s village heads, a number of SS-men were present to threaten and terrorize them.4 To my knowledge all farmers in our village meticulously complied with the order and delivered all they were ordered. In our area, the grain was stored in an old Cistercian monastery in Koprzywnica. I helped my father to take our grain there. If I am not mistaken, the Nazi government issued another order at the end of October 1939. According to this order, all men and women above the age of fourteen had to appear in the county ofﬁce to have pictures and ﬁngerprints taken for ofﬁcial identiﬁcation cards. As I have learned later, these ID cards classiﬁed the people according to the potential danger they presented to the Nazi government. Each ID was rubber-stamped with a seal. The emblem on the seal consisted of the Nazi eagle, which held in his talons a wreath. Under the wreath a swastica was suspended. In the middle of the wreath there was a number, hardly noticeable, which indicated a class of people to which an individual belonged. Highly educated persons such as university professors, scientists, and writers were given number one. College professors, priests,\n\n24\n\n3. THE FIRST STAGE\n\nOF THE\n\nNAZI OCCUPATION\n\n25\n\nministers, former military ofﬁcers, and social activists were assigned number two. High school and grade school teachers, lawyers, engineers, and technicians obtained number three and so on. Landless and illiterate individuals received the highest number. The methodical extermination of the Polish people, which was about to begin, was designed according to the numerical classiﬁcation. The Nazi timetable provided for a certain time period during which a given class of people was to be eliminated. Of course, the class designated number one was the ﬁrst one to go.5 From time to time the SS and Gestapo units staged a roundup during which ID’s were checked and persons belonging to a certain class arrested and taken to death camps. The campus of the famous Jagiellonian University in Cracow provided the stage for a roundup of the faculty. The Nazis used deception in gathering the members of the faculty on the campus. The professors were made to believe that the Nazis were to meet with them to discuss the reopening of the university. Those who believed the Nazis and came to the meeting were arrested and sent to extermination camps. Most of the faculty members went to that fatal meeting. Since our village was about ten miles away from a highway, the Nazis were seldom seen there. An SS unit was stationed in Koprzywnica, about sixteen miles from us and in Loniow, which was about ten miles from Jeziory. These two units were there from the very beginning of the occupation. Several months later another SS unit was placed only two and a half miles from our village in Ruszcza manor. This unit was too close to us for comfort. Especially when rumors began to circulate about a torture table the SS men were using there in the interrogation of their prisoners. One day in the late fall, a small group of SS men from Ruszcza came to our village. They searched for pine timber, which some farmers allegedly cut without authorization from the neighboring state forest. When they arrived in the village no one knew what they were after. My father and Uncle Franek thought that they were taking young boys and girls for forced labor in Germany; therefore, they hid my ﬁrst cousin, Maria, and me in the attic of our stable. When the Nazis came to our yard my father waited for them there. There was some pine timber in our yard, which my father and I had cut. My father was concerned about it. When the SS men noticed the timber, they began questioning my father about it. Fortunately, my father spoke some German and managed to explain to them the fact that the timber they saw came from his own forest. They were gratiﬁed to hear him speak German and accepted his explanation. This was the ﬁrst time I had ever heard my father speak German. As soon as they left our yard and went to our neighbors’ farm, Maria\n\n26\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nThe palace of Count Moszynski in Loniow was occupied by the SS unit that terrorized the whole area from the very beginning of World War II. Author’s photograph.\n\nand I came out from hiding. We managed to peek at the Nazis as they searched for timber in the Podsiadlys’ yard. Not ﬁnding any suspicious timber, they left Jeziory for the village of Bukowa. There, as we learned by the end of the day, they found some government timber and arrested a number of men. The SS men stationed in Ruszcza also enforced delivery of grain by the local farmers. An elderly farmer by the name of Strzesniak from the neighboring village of Wojcieszyce failed to deliver the required amount of grain to the Nazi warehouse. It most probably happened by some bureaucratic error. Soon he received a summons from the SS men in Ruszcza to appear in person at their post. Knowing about the beating other farmers suffered at the hands of the Nazis under similar circumstances, he was very much concerned and frightened. Being, however, a clever man, he decided to play a fool with the SS men. The people who knew him well told me that he was quite an actor. The day before he was to appear at the SS station, he put an old worn-out topcoat below the roosts in his chicken coop. The following day, in the morning, he put on the coat spotted with the birds’ droppings, soiled his shoes in stable manure, and walked to Ruszcza for his appointment with the SS men. Holding in his hand the paper that summoned him, he walked into the ofﬁce\n\n3. THE FIRST STAGE\n\nOF THE\n\nNAZI OCCUPATION\n\n27\n\nat the appointed hour. A terrible stench of manure ﬁlled the ofﬁce. As an SS man looked at the visitor, he realized immediately the source of the repugnant odor. He grabbed the paper out of the farmer’s hand and shouted, “Raus! Raus! ” pointing toward the door. Szczesniak left the ofﬁce as fast as he could, gratiﬁed with the desired effect of his act. Then he discarded the topcoat, washed his boots, and walked home laughing all the way. This was not his ﬁrst clever act. He was known in the whole area for playing humorous tricks on many well-placed and educated people. Some of the people in our county underestimated the Nazis’ ability to subdue and control the people they conquered. Two large villages in our county paid a terrible price for their misconception of the Nazi invaders. One of these villages was Swiniary, a village situated on the western side of the Vistula River near where the strategic highway and bridge were constructed before the war. As I mentioned before, after the unit of Polish soldiers destroyed the bridge, the retreating Polish army, in order to cross the shallow parts of the river, left a great amount of weapons, ammunition, and other valuable things near the bridge. The men of Swiniary were the ﬁrst ones to salvage as much of the weapons and ammunition as they could. Older and more experienced men hid their weapons, hoping to use them at the proper time against the invaders. Younger men began to ﬁre their ﬁrearms at night and even used light machine guns for hunting deer. The SS men stationed at Loniow manor soon became aware of what was going on in Swiniary. They took their time in making a list of those possessing weapons. After the list was completed, the Nazis surrounded the village early in the morning and arrested scores of men, who never returned to their village. They were all shot. Another village that lost most of its men was Beszyce. This village belonged to our parish and was only about ﬁve miles from Jeziory. For a long time before the war, Beszyce had a very bad reputation. Thefts and robberies in the surrounding area were traceable to the village. Most of the men in the village had police records and were incarcerated at one time or another. After the Nazi invasion, many men of Beszyce returned from prisons and replenished their weapons and ammunition at the Vistula River near Swiniary. They also underestimated German vigilance. As soon as the military activities ceased in the area and the Nazis rarely appeared in remote villages, the men of Beszyce became active as thieves and robbers. As a rule they avoided the area of our parish and went to distant villages and towns to commit their criminal acts. The Nazi authorities, having in their possession Polish prewar criminal records, kept an eye on the village of Beszyce. After an investigation of robberies was completed, it was obvious that traces led, in a number of cases, to the village; therefore, the SS men administered a radical solution.\n\n28\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nThey rounded up most of the grown men in the village and sent them to death camps. To my knowledge none of these men returned. Needless to say, there was very little sympathy toward them on the part of the area’s population.\n\nThe Fate of Osiek For a long time after my return, I heard my parents and neighbors talk about the battle of Osiek and its disastrous effect. To satisfy my curiosity, I walked about ten miles to Osiek or, more correctly, to what was left of it. After arriving there, I discovered that, with the exception of some buildings in the downtown area and the church, the whole town and its suburbs were in ruins. Everything was burned to the ground. How did it happen? During the German attack on Osiek on September 11, 1939, the Polish units, which were dug in on the hills west of Osiek, were ordered to halt the progress of the Germans coming by the highway from the city of Staszow. They were ordered to do so to enable the majority of the other Polish units to cross the Vistula River on their way east. In spite of the shortage of tanks and heavy artillery, the Polish units, under the leadership of Colonel Wladyslaw Adamczyk, performed acts of supreme heroism to halt the invaders. They made good use of the hills overlooking the highway and other approaches to Osiek and of their heavy machine guns. Colonel Adamczyk commanded the 201st Regiment of Infantry. He posted the Second Battalion northwest of Osiek near Suchowola and Grabowiec and his First Battalion southwest of the town toward the villages of Pliskowola and Niekrasow. The Third Battery of the 65th Regiment of Light Artillery was to deter an imminent attack of the German infantry and tanks. Other light artillery units were to provide a general support of the front line.6 In order to prevent the Polish troops from crossing the Vistula River, the Germans pushed ferociously. Between 8:00 A.M. and 9:00 A.M., a good number of the Luftwaffe bombers began a concentrated attack on the Polish units crossing the Vistula near Baranow. At the same time, a German panzer unit began to roll toward Osiek from the village of Niekrasow to the south and a battery of artillery appeared on the horizon near Pliskowola. Soon the enemy began to move forward from the west and its units grew in numbers. Then, the enemy appeared also from the north, from the direction of Grabowiec. The attacking Germans belonged to battalions of the 27th and 68th Divisions of Infantry and the panzer units were a part of the Fifth Panzer Division. The Polish units opened ﬁre at the approaching enemy around 9:00 A.M. and its units halted for a while, but soon the attack continued at a slow pace. After a while, the enemy’s artillery set Osiek on ﬁre. The Poles withdrew east of Osiek.7\n\n3. THE FIRST STAGE\n\nOF THE\n\nNAZI OCCUPATION\n\n29\n\nAt about 1:00 P.M. the Poles not only halted the enemy but also began a counterattack during which they took Osiek from the Germans and pushed them back to their original positions. At the same time, they captured more than 160 German POWs. Unfortunately, the lack of ammunition forced the Poles by evening to withdraw under the cover of darkness and retreat toward the Vistula. The Germans took Osiek again on September 12, 1939, but they paid a very dear price. Hundreds of their dead soldiers littered the ﬁelds near the town. The battle of Osiek was also costly for the Polish side: 98 killed and 180 wounded.8 Most of the residents of Osiek left their burned town and found shelter in the neighboring villages. In most instances they constructed temporary shanties. Some of them lived in dugouts. My stepmother’s parents lived in a suburb of Osiek called Osieczko. Their house, stable, and barn were burned to the ground. Together with most of the other people, they decided to stay in one of the villages near Osiek. After their son, Jan Bernacki, returned from the war (his unit guarded the Polish border with the Soviet Union) and their daughter, Janka, married a young man named Leon Piekniak, they began construction of a shanty to serve them as a shelter. All ﬁve of them were to live in it. Since the Bernackis’ farmland was adjacent to a lake whose shoreline was covered with growing reeds, my stepmother’s brother and his brotherin-law decided to use reeds for the roof on the shanty. The November weather was cold and the lake’s surface was frozen. Jan Bernacki and his brother-inlaw, Leon Piekniak, hitched their horse to a farm wagon and went to the lake to cut reeds. After loading the wagon with reeds they decided to load also a number of artillery projectiles, which were in abundance near the lake. I never learned the reason they put the projectiles on the wagon. When they brought the load to the construction site, Jan’s mother came out of the friends’ house to see what they had brought. Jan was on the top of the wagon and his brotherin-law on the ground. My stepmother’s father and sister were inside the house. Jan picked up one of the projectiles and threw it on the frozen ground. His mother shouted, “Janek, for God’s sake what are you doing?” He smiled, picked up another projectile, and threw it down against the ﬁrst one. An explosion shook the whole area. Windows blew out in the neighborhood. Both Jan and his brother-in-law were blown to bits. Fragments struck the mother but she lived for about a week. I will never forget the day the tragic news was brought to our home. My stepmother’s cousin, Stanislaw Niekurzak, was the bearer of the bad news. He came to our home early in the morning as we were just getting up. My stepmother was cooking our breakfast when she heard knocking on the door. She opened the door and when she saw the bewildered face of her cousin, Stanislaw Niekurzak, she knew that something was wrong. In the meantime,\n\n30\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nmy father and I had come into the kitchen, greeted him, and were puzzled by his unexpected early visit. He was silent for a short while, looked at us with eyes full of pain, and began describing the terrible drama. My stepmother wept, my father and I were shocked by the news and looked at Niekurzak with disbelief. As we all sat down for a while, he shared some details of the tragedy with us. As soon as our painful breakfast was over, my father hitched a horse to a wagon and helped my stepmother into it. Niekurzak and my father got into the wagon too. All three of them sped to the scene of the tragedy as fast as the horse could run. As soon as they arrived there my father took charge of things. First of all, he saw to it that his mother-in-law got some medical attention. Then, using side boards from the farm wagon, he constructed a primitive cofﬁn to bury the fragmented bodies of the two men. After their simple funeral at the parish cemetery, my father brought his in-laws and sister-in-law to our home in Jeziory. In spite of the physician’s recommendation, my stepmother’s mother refused to go to the hospital. Numerous fragments of the two artillery shells had lodged themselves deep in various parts of her body, especially in the areas of her chest and abdomen. An infection developed, and she died. My parents buried her in the Osiek cemetery next to the bodies of her son and son-inlaw. My stepmother’s father and sister stayed with us until the spring of 1940 and then returned to Osieczko to take care of their farm. Out of the halfburned pieces of wood left from their house and farm buildings, they managed to construct a shanty and lived there for a number of years. The winter of 1939-40 was rather quiet in our area. The Germans did not disturb us too much. Once in a while a group of SS men came to take Waclaw Podsiadly to serve them as an interpreter. Waclaw, the son of our next door neighbor, was a college student. His studies were interrupted by the war. Since both in high school and in college the German language was a part of his curriculum, Waclaw knew the language fairly well. The SS men needed him for their raids on villages and towns during which they arrested and interrogated people. At ﬁrst, Waclaw went with the Nazis on a number of occasions but as soon as he realized that he was cooperating with them in the persecution and even death of his own countrymen, he used to hide each time they were spotted entering our village. Most of the time he hid in the farm buildings. One time I saw him run away from the SS men into the reeds, which grew on the shore of our small lake. If the Nazi troopers could not get hold of Waclaw, they usually went to the village of Bukowa to pick up another interpreter whose name was David Stawiarz. He spent a part of his life in Germany, where he learned German.\n\n3. THE FIRST STAGE\n\nOF THE\n\nNAZI OCCUPATION\n\n31\n\nI was told that he was more cooperative with the Nazis than Waclaw. I met him only once later in the war and by that time the young man was already a member of the Polish Home Army. From time to time, I saw small units of Nazi troopers skiing by our village. They never stopped in the village. At that time no one in Jeziory was involved in underground activities. The Nazis felt quite secure in our rural area.\n\nThe Winter Story Time As a heavy snow covered the earth during the early wintertime, we seldom left the village, with the exception of walking to the church on Sundays. In the evenings our neighbors used to come to our home to visit. I always enjoyed when men gathered together and talked about their experiences in World War I in light of which they attempted to understand the reality of the German occupation of Poland. Since the Nazi government prohibited publication of Polish newspapers and all radio sets were conﬁscated, such meetings were one of the main ways in which news items were disseminated. During these neighborly meetings, I always put my books away and listened to the men’s conversation and stories. I will never forget those wonderful moments, which were both instructive and pleasant. Some of the men who visited with us did not take part in World War I. They had spent those years in the United States or Canada working in mills, factories, and mines. They would recollect their experiences abroad. My uncle Wladyslaw Mazgaj, in particular, had many interesting and colorful stories to tell about his life in Lackawanna, New York, and his friendships with the blacks he met at work. Uncle Wladyslaw also told stories about District Judge Basili (Wasyl) Pietrow, who lived with his wife and children in a beautiful palace in Dzieki but worked in the district court house in Sandomierz. The judge came from a very interesting, fascinating Russian family that had gradually become culturally Polish. The progenitor of the family, General Basili (Wasili Wasilewicz) Pogodin, came to Warsaw, Poland, in 1831, shortly after the Russian army crushed the Polish Revolution of 1830. At ﬁrst, he was in charge of the supplies for the Russian army and then he supervised the settlements of the claims for damages inﬂicted on the civilian population by the military activities of the Russian Imperial Army during the revolution. Later on, the emperor appointed him a senator. In all the positions to which he was appointed General Basili Pogodin performed very well. For the faithful and exemplary services that General Pogodin rendered to the crown, Emperor Nicholas I granted him 125,000 rubles and a large estate\n\n32\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nLegendary district judge Basili (Wasyl) Pietrow lived at this castle-palace during pre–World War I times and worked in the district court in Sandomierz. The progenitor of his family was Russian general Basili (Wasili Wasilewicz) Pogodin, who came to Warsaw in 1831. He had this palace constructed as his summer residence some time thereafter. Author’s photograph.\n\nconsisting of about ﬁfteen thousand acres. Near the ancient village of Wiazownica, General Pogodin built a beautiful summer residence, which the people of the area called a castle. As a practicing Orthodox Christian, the general also was instrumental in building a new Roman Catholic church for the people of the Wiazownica parish. General Pogodin died on January 21, 1863, and his body was buried at the old cemetery in Wiazownica. His daughter, Aleksandra, inherited her father’s estate. Her husband, Judge Aleksander Pietrow, was, in his time, the greatest chess player in the world. During the couple’s residence in Warsaw, Aleksandra Pietrow was very active in religious, social, educational, and charitable organizations. She identiﬁed herself more with Polish people than with her own nationality. Seven years after he was ennobled by the Russian emperor, Aleksandra’s husband, Judge Pietrow, died in 1867. Aleksandra Pogodin Pietrow died in 1883. Their son, District Judge Basili (Wasyl) Pietrow inherited the parents’ estate. He married Aleksandra Lisiecka, a daughter of Baron Lisiecki. The couple made their home at the palace in Dzieki. The judge commuted from\n\n3. THE FIRST STAGE\n\nOF THE\n\nNAZI OCCUPATION\n\n33\n\nthe ancestral residence to the district court in Sandomierz. He inherited not only the Pogodins’ and the Pietrow’s wealth, privileges, and honors but also their intelligence. At the same time, he was a very colorful and imaginative person. From time to time his personality exhibited a slight tendency toward eccentricity. However, as it often happens in such cases, the people of Dzieki, Wiazownica, Bukowa, Osiek, and many other villages that encompassed Judge Pietrow’s jurisdiction do not remember him as a very intelligent and capable district judge but rather as a very wealthy, colorful, and, at times, eccentric, high-ranking Russian ofﬁcial. In the stories told about him, he was never called Judge Basili Pietrow or Basili Pietrow but rather Bazili. When I listened to my Uncle Wladyslaw’s stories about Judge Pietrow, I was convinced that Bazili was his last name.9 According to my grandmother Mazgaj, Judge Basili Pietrow was a great lover of hunting. She also told me that even though the judge was the richest man in the whole area and kept a small unit of cavalry at his own expense, he and his family lived in their residence very modestly. She was convinced that Judge Pietrow was a very honest and honorable person. Uncle Wladyslaw told me that Judge Pietrow was a very generous person whose generosity bordered on prodigiality. Many a time while riding through villages, he gave money to women who wore nice dresses or had beautiful hair. He also spent a great amount of money on some ill-conceived projects. For example, when there was a scarcity of jack rabbits in his forests, he bought thousands of domesticated rabbits and turned them loose with the hope that they would become wild and provide abundant game. A few months later most of the rabbits were lost to dogs, foxes and poachers. According to Uncle Wladyslaw, Judge Pietrow was a great lover of horses. He considered himself an expert in discovering valuable and promising horses. On a number of occasions, he selected and bought from local farmers young horses and spent a great deal of money on them to be trained for racing. After they were trained, his horses competed in various places, including foreign countries, but they seldom won any prizes. Nevertheless, he tried over and over again. Uncle Wladyslaw said that one time, as Basili rode a horse, he noticed that a farmer was plowing a ﬁeld. The horse he was using for the work had an extremely bent back. There was no doubt the line of the animal’s back was rather unusual. The farmer considered it a freak of nature but not Judge Pietrow. He judged the horse to be an unusual specimen of strength. Against the best advice of his cavalrymen, he bought the horse and put him on an accelerated diet. Several months later, when the animal put on more weight, Judge Pietrow ordered a few of his cavalrymen to hitch the horse to a wagon loaded with stones to test its strength. The horse failed to pull the wagon.\n\n34\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nThe judge, convinced that his men did not know how to handle the horse, took the reins and the whip and tried to make the horse pull. The horse refused to do so and, when Basili whipped it again and again, the animal became furious and began kicking at the master. At that point Basili lost his temper, pulled out a revolver, and shot the horse. As a district judge, Basili adjudicated cases in the court house in Sandomierz. He traveled from Dzieki to Sandomierz by his private coach. According to my uncle’s story, when Basili traveled to the court house in Sandomierz or to some other destination and noticed a funeral procession on the road, he ordered his driver to turn around and go back to Dzieki. He did not attempt to go again to the court house on that day. It appears to me now that since all the stories about Judge Basili Pietrow were told to entertain the audience the tellers exaggerated to a degree. Therefore, they should be taken with a grain of salt. It is a well-known fact that the manners of speech, clothing, and behavior of educated people tend to appear funny and unusual to country people. The country people were drawn to considering the judge’s behavior as unusual, funny, and eccentric because he was a high-ranking ofﬁcial of the foreign government of Russia, which, at that time, was the number one enemy of Poland as one of its rulers. It is quite natural for people who are conquered militarily not to accept defeat but to carry on a psychological warfare against the enemy by ridiculing its ofﬁcials. Uncle Wladyslaw had a gift for storytelling. Besides Polish and Russian, he spoke some English. In telling stories, he used his knowledge of foreign languages very effectively. This way of storytelling enhanced their authenticity. Most of the other men who spent evenings in our home used foreign languages while talking about their experiences in Russia, the United States of America, or Germany. In addition to his stories about Judge Pietrow and the ones that reﬂected his experiences in the United States, Uncle Wladyslaw enjoyed giving summaries of his favorite sermons, which were preached in our church by various priests. In doing this, his oratorical gifts came to the fore. I am sure he would have made a wonderful preacher. During this ﬁrst winter of the Nazi occupation, my ﬁrst cousin, Jozef, his brother, Jan, and I began preparing weapons to use against the enemy. First of all, we discovered several World War I bayonets hidden in the attic of our house. Then we built from scratch a muzzle-loaded shotgun and ﬁnally we made a number of daggers. All of these weapons were hidden in our barn. We intended to use them at an opportune moment but when the time came to ﬁght the Nazis, we did not use these antiquated weapons; rather, we secured better ones.\n\n3. THE FIRST STAGE\n\nOF THE\n\nNAZI OCCUPATION\n\n35\n\nThe Jewish Question As we were enjoying a rather cozy life in our village during the winter, the Jewish people of Sandomierz, Koprzywnica, Klimontow, and Osiek were given the ﬁrst taste of the Nazi attitude toward them. They were ordered to wear the Star of David on their arm. Since the winter was very snowy, the Nazis organized Jewish work brigades, which were charged with the removal of snow from streets and highways. As soon as a new snow fell, Jewish brigades, under the watchful eyes of the Nazi troopers, marched with shovels on their arms to remove the snow. It is a known fact that very few Jews were used to physical work. A great majority of Jews in Poland were involved in commerce and other trades, which did not demand strong muscles. Therefore, the work on the roads was extremely taxing to them. The Nazis made fun of Jewish inexperience in physical work and forced the road brigades to sing a song in Polish, which had the following refrain: “That Smigly-Rydz Taught us nothing about work But this Golden Hitler, Teachers us how to work.”10 Many Jewish men froze to death removing snow on highways. In organizing Jewish work brigades in Sandomierz, the Nazis requested that Father Jan Stepien serve as an intermediary between themselves and the Jewish community. As a professor of biblical studies in the diocesan seminary of Sandomierz, Father Stepien knew the Hebrew language and spoke German. He did all in his power to persuade the Nazis to exclude from the work brigades Jews who were old and disabled. At times, he was successful in his persuasions. The Jews of Sandomierz loved and respected him. One time, Father Stepien went to a watchmaker in the city who happened to be an elderly Jewish man and asked him to repair his watch. The watchmaker took the watch and asked the priest to pick it up the following day. When the priest came back the next day, the watch was repaired. The priest asked the watchmaker how much he owed him. “One single zloty,” was the answer. The priest looked at the Jewish man with disbelief because one zloty represented very little monetary value. The watchmaker noticed his customer’s surprise and said, in a way of explanation, something to this effect. A long time ago there was a very famous monarch. One of his ministers was a Jew. On the occasion of the king’s birthday, he invited his friends to his palace for a banquet. A Jewish minister was one of the invited friends. When the dinner was over, the king went around the tables and offered each guest a cigar. Men lit their cigars and began to smoke but the Jew did not. He held his cigar respectfully in his hand and waited. The king noticed this and asked as to why\n\n36\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\nhe did not smoke the cigar. The minister replied, “This cigar, which came from your majesty, is too valuable for me to smoke. When I return home, I will frame this cigar and inscribe underneath, This cigar was given to me by His Majesty, the King. My children and grandchildren will read it with a great respect and admiration.” You understand what I am trying to tell you, Father? I will not spend this single zloty I asked of you. I will frame it and write under it that it came from a great priest who knows our sacred language and who saved me and many other Jews from the Nazi forced labor and possible death. My children and grandchildren will view it with a great reverence.\n\nI was told that the Jewish road brigades from the town of Klimontow were sent by their Nazi bosses to remove snow even during snowstorms. As they removed the snow from the road, the wind blew it back — an endless and hopeless work similar to that of the mythical Sisyphus. The Nazis in charge of the Jewish work groups in Klimontow subjected them to every possible humiliation. Each Thursday there was a very popular farm market in Klimontow to which thousands of farmers came to sell their products and buy goods from the local merchants. Most of the farmers, at that time, used horses and wagons for transportation. At the end of the day when the farmers left town, the town’s market and the streets were covered with horse manure. The Nazis used Jewish work crews to remove the manure. In the Jewish section of Klimontow, the Nazis discovered some outhouses used by the public, which were overﬂowing with human excrement. Instead of requesting that the town’s administration take care of these outhouses, the Nazis forced at gunpoint Jewish road crews and community leaders to clean them up. I was told by one of our neighbors, who was an eyewitness, that the troopers brought most of the leaders of the Jewish community to perform this work by dragging them by their beards. He also told me that those Jews who did not have buckets to carry out the excrement had to use their hats. In the city of Tarnobrzeg, the Nazis forced Jewish workers to destroy their own cemetery. Its tombstones were used for paving the ground for the farmers’ market. From the time the Nazi administration in Poland forced Jews to wear an armband with the Star of David, Jewish peddlers ceased to come to our village. They were afraid to be killed by the police. At the end of April 1940, the leadership of Nazi Germany took initial steps in building the infamous concentration camp in Oswiecim (Auschwitz). Shortly after Easter 1940, news spread all over the area that a group of robbers broke into our parish church in Sulistawice, desecrated the miraculous image of Our Lady, and took with them votive offerings and precious crowns that adorned the sacred image. Several months later, the Nazi police tracked down the perpetrators of\n\n3. THE FIRST STAGE\n\nOF THE\n\nNAZI OCCUPATION\n\n37\n\nthis crime, surrounded the house in which they were found, and set ﬁre to it. They were all killed. Most of the people in our area considered this to be an act of divine retribution.11\n\nThe Arrests in Jeziory Just before the beginning of the sowing season in the early spring of 1940, a group of policemen, who served the Nazis, invaded our home and arrested my father. Three other men were arrested in our village during the same night. My father and the other men were arrested because they opposed the government-sponsored land consolidation in our village. When my paternal grandfather, Antoni Aleksander Mazgaj, his brother, Jan Mazgaj, and three others originally bought the land of the manor of Jeziory, they divided it into three sections: the northern ﬁelds, the southern ﬁelds, and the forest. Then each of these sections was subdivided into ﬁve equal parts. The northern ﬁelds were much more fertile than the southern ones. In addition to these three basic sections of the land, the original settlers left a small and sandy section for their common use. Later this section, too, was subdivided into individual plots of land. Hence, each farmer in our village had his farm in four different places. The purpose of the land consolidation was to redivide the land in such a way so that each farmer would have all his land in two sections: the ﬁelds and the forest. My father and three other farmers in the village were not opposed to such consolidation. But when they discovered that the land surveyor, who had the authority to determine as to where the ﬁelds of each farmer were to be located, was taking bribes from a couple of farmers, they voiced their opposition. When their vocal opposition did not accomplish anything, they removed the surveyor’s stakes from their land. Without a warning, the surveyor reported this action to the German authorities. The reaction of the authorities was swift — arrests of the four opponents. After the arrests, my father and his three fellow farmers were taken by the police to the area’s concentration camp in Gerlachow near Sandomierz. It was not a death camp but rather a labor camp in which people were detained for various minor offenses against the Nazi new order. Since my father’s detention lasted about four months, all the work on the farm fell on my shoulders. I was sixteen years old and did not mind the challenge of operating a farm on my own. So I cultivated the ﬁelds, sowed barley and oats, spread manure, plowed, and planted potatoes. My mother and younger brothers and sisters began to treat me with a kind of respect I never experienced before. This meant so much to me. It was a token of their\n\n38\n\nPART TWO : THE TIME\n\nOF\n\nWAR\n\ngratitude for my challenging work. They all did what they could to help me both at home and in the ﬁelds. They were especially helpful in planting potato seeds and during the ﬁrst haymaking. On Sundays, I walked to Gerlachow to visit with my father. My stepmother always prepared a food package for him. During my visits, I gave my father a report about my work on the farm and sought his guidance. My father was released from the concentration camp just in time for the harvest. I will never forget the day he returned home. We all cried out of joy. Soon he wanted to see the ﬁelds. He and I walked through the ﬁelds of grain and potatoes. Everywhere we went the harvest looked very pro"
