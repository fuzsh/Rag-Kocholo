(Translated from Polish.)\n\nPoles constitute more than 98 percent of the population. The rest are Ukrainians and Byelorussians, living in the east and northeast, Slovaks, concentrated in the south, and small groups of gypsies, Jews, Russians, and Lithuanians. Most believers are Catholics; Protestants are found in the north. The official calendar is the Gregorian.\n\nPoland’s population is steadily increasing. The natural growth rate is relatively high—9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1973. Poland has a large potential work force; persons between the ages of 15 and 59 constitute 62 percent of the population.\n\nAccording to the 1970 census, workers and office employees made up 69.4 percent of the total population; peasants belonging to farm producers’ cooperatives, as well as cottage industry workers and artisans organized into cooperatives, 3.5 percent; peasants owning their own farms and craftsmen and artisans who were not members of cooperatives, 26.7 percent; and persons belonging to the liberal professions and other groups, 0.4 percent.\n\nOut of a work force of 16.8 million persons in 1974, 32.7 percent (53.3 percent in 1950) were employed in agriculture (including lumbering), 30.0 percent (17.7 percent) in industry, 8.3 percent (3.9 percent) in construction, 6.0 percent (3.6 percent) in transportation and communications, 7.1 percent (4.9 percent) in trade, 5.1 percent (2.3 percent) in educational and scientific institutions, and 3.5 percent (1.3 percent) in public health.\n\nIn 1974 the average population density was 108 persons per sq km. In the densely populated south it was 217 persons per sq km, and in the northeast, 49 persons per sq km. In 1973, 54 percent of the population lived in cities. The largest cities are Warsaw, Łódź, Kraków, Wroclaw, Poznań, Szczecin, Bydgoszcz, Lublin, and Katowice, the center of the country’s largest metropolitan area, the Upper Silesia, or Silesia-Dąbrowska, Conurbation. Gdańsk and Gdynia have merged with Sopot to form the Trójmiasto Conurbation.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBarbag, J. Ekonomicheskaia geografiia Pol’shi. Moscow, 1952. (Translated from Polish.)\n\nIlinich, lu. V.

They are supervised by the minister of national defense.\n\nThe nucleus of the Polish armed forces was the First T. Ko-ciuszko Division (named after Poland’s national hero), formed in the USSR in the spring of 1943. On Oct. 12, 1943, the division, operating jointly with Soviet troops, fought a battle against Nazi German troops near the Byelorussian village of Lenino, successfully carrying out its military mission. This date is celebrated as Polish Armed Forces Day. The organization of the I Polish Corps began in August 1943. The corps became the basis for the First Polish Army, formed in March 1944, and for the Second Army, organized later that year. Together with the Soviet Army, the Polish forces took part in the Vistula-Oder, Eastern Pomeranian, Berlin, and Prague operations against the fascist German Army.\n\nThe Polish Army is recruited on the basis of universal compulsory military service. The term of active service in the engineering units and in the navy is three years; in the other branches it is two years. The draft age is 19. Officers are trained at military academies and schools. The armed forces are equipped with missiles, tanks, aircraft, and combat ships. Most of the military equipment is of domestic manufacture. Since the Warsaw Treaty Organization was created in 1955, the armed forces of the Polish People’s Republic have taken part in joint measures to strengthen the United Armed Forces in order to ensure peace and security in Europe.\n\nThe first schools in Poland were established in the tenth and 11th centuries. They were affiliated with monasteries and churches, and the language of instruction was Latin. In the 13th and 14th centuries urban schools were founded in which lessons were conducted in Polish. Public education developed and became more secular in the Renaissance and Reformation periods, when the Jagiellonian University in Kraków became a center of humanism in Western Europe. The brotherhood schools also developed at this time. Down to the 18th century Polish schools were dominated by the Jesuits, who made education dogmatic and scholastic. In 1773 schools were placed under the jurisdiction of the Education Commission, which functioned until 1794. In 1773–75 the commission introduced reforms that secularized education and firmly established Polish as the language of instruction.\n\nThe partitions of Poland had grave consequences for education. On the territory ceded to tsarist Russia, the number of primary schools decreased, chiefly in villages, and from 1869 instruction was conducted in Russian. (Polish was used only in private schools.) In the early 19th century in almost all the schools in the Austrian-held areas German was the language of instruction. A similar policy was adopted by Prussia. After the Uprising of 1830–31 the tsarist authorities abolished the Department of Education, replacing it with the Warsaw Educational District, subordinate to the All-Russian Ministry of Education. However, the progressives in Polish society illegally organized Polish schools and even a university, known as the “flying university.” Various educational organizations were established.\n\nAfter the creation of the Polish bourgeois state in 1918, Polish schools and universities were reopened, but public education remained at a low level for a long time. In 1931, 22.6 percent of the population over the age of seven was illiterate; of these, 17.7 percent were men and 27.1 percent women. That year more than 1 million school-age children did not attend school. During the Nazi occupation, although the Polish school system was almost completely destroyed, patriotic teachers, under the direction of a secret teachers’ organization, taught children and young people illegally.\n\nAfter the liberation of Poland by the Soviet Army and the formation of the Polish people’s democratic state, a centralized state school system was established to meet the people’s needs. The goals and tasks of instruction have changed radically. The present system of public education is based on the Law on the Development of a System of Education and Upbringing in People’s Poland, enacted in 1961.\n\nFor children between the ages of three and seven there are kindergartens. In 1973, 1,026,000 children—more than 40 percent of all preschool children—attended 30,200 kindergartens. At the age of seven children are enrolled in a compulsory eight-year basic school. Graduates of a basic school may continue their education at a lycée or at one of the many types of vocational schools. The lycée, a general secondary school, offers a four-year course of study, and its graduates may enroll in institutions of higher learning. Lower vocational schools, open to those who have completed a basic school, offer a two-or three-year course of study and train skilled workers for various branches of the national economy. In addition there are secondary vocational schools, both technicums and vocational lycées, offering a four-or five-year course of study. During the 1973–74 school year there were 20,200 basic schools with an enrollment of 4,778,600 pupils, 1,200 general lycées with 639,100 students, and many vocational schools of all types with 1.9 million students.\n\nIn 1973 the Sejm adopted a resolution of the reorganization of the public school system. The resolution provided for the introduction of universal ten-year secondary education based on a standard nationwide curriculum.\n\nInstitutions of higher learning include universities, the oldest of which are the Jagiellonian University and Warsaw University, polytechnical institutes, higher agricultural, economic, and pedagogical schools, and medical academies. The course of study in institutions of higher, learning ranges from four to six years. During the 1972–73 academic year the country’s 88 institutions of higher learning had an enrollment of 361,100 students.\n\nThe largest libraries are the Jagiellonian University Library (founded in 1364, more than 1.2 million holdings), the National Library in Warsaw (1928, 2.7 million holdings), the Warsaw University Library (1817, about 1.7 million holdings) and the Library of the University of Poznań (1902, about 1.5 million holdings). The most important museums are the national and history museums in Warsaw and Kraków, the Lenin museums in Warsaw, Kraków, and Poronin, and the F. Chopin museums in Warsaw and Żelazowa Wola.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nHistori nauki polskiej, vols. 1–2. Edited by B. Suchodolski. Wroclaw, 1970.\n\nRolbiecki, W.

Down to the late 1880’s itinerant circus performers— acrobats, jugglers, and magicians—entertained the public at fairs and in the city streets. The first large traveling circus was organized by A. Pincel. A permanent circus building was erected in Warsaw in 1883 in which mostly foreign circus artists performed. The circus was owned first by W. Ciniselli and later by A. Ciniselli; in the early 20th century it was acquired by S. Mroczkowski. During World War II the circus building was destroyed, and the traveling circus of the Staniewski brothers, founded in 1932, also ceased to exist.\n\nCircus entertainment was restored in the Polish People’s Republic in 1945, and since then several traveling circuses have been formed. The state Association of Amusement Enterprises, created in 1945, includes 15 circuses, among them the First State Circus in -Łódz (since 1945; manager and artistic director E. Mane), Arena, Warszawa, Polonia, and the Fairy Tale Theater-Circus (Teatr-Cyrk Bajka). In the late 1950’s a training center for preparing new acts and programs was organized at Julinek, near Warsaw. Since 1954 Polish artists have been touring abroad with increasing frequency. The First International Festival of Circus Art was held in Warsaw in 1956.\n\nAmong the leading Polish circus artists are the cyclists M. Barański, S. Barański, and Joles, the horse trainers B. Basta and P. Basta, the clowns K. Bałszak, E. Dworakowski, and E. Kordium, the jugglers Braun and Bruskich, the wrestlers Zbyszko-Cyganiewicz and the Pytlasiński’s, and the clown duo Din-Don (W. Manc and E. Manc)."
