This is a hybrid work that combines close and careful analysis of certain issues in the service of a very broad synthetic argument about the Jewish experience in recent times. Consequently, the book is based in part on my own research and substantially on work done by scholars mainly in Poland, Israel, and North America. I have tried to acknowledge all of these debts in the notes. If I have failed to credit a source, I ask forgiveness. A recent tendency in the historical profession has focused attention on marginal and oppressed groups, for example, homosexuals, women, and Jews. This tendency to look at the edges of “mainstream” culture is often in the service of contemporary argument for a more inclusive and accepting society. I both reject and accept this trend in this book. On the one hand, I have tried to focus attention on the majority of Jews and their situation in East Central Europe in the eighteenth century; even the clariﬁcation of marginality requires a ﬁrm understanding of the center. On the other hand, Jews in Poland-Lithuania were themselves marginal both in terms of their relative numerical signiﬁcance and in terms of political power. I have learned from my colleagues who study colonized groups how the historiography of the colonized encodes the dominance of the elite. I have tried to write about Jews without using the language of dominance and subjugation as if their situation were deﬁned by their place in the state. I have also tried to avoid essentializing the eastern European Jewish community. In order to make my broader argument, however, I have had xv\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page xvi\n\nxvi\n\nPREFACE\n\nto commit two “sins”: not only do I speak of eastern European Jewry collectively and corporately, but my thesis proceeds from the more recent to the more distant past. I began my work in an eªort to explain why, in my view, the mentality of eastern European Jewry, even as they moved in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to many destinations, continued to include, at its very core, a positive evaluation of Jewishness. For all of the myriad changes in belief and practice, ideology and worldview, this positive view of themselves as Jews persisted, and its roots can be found in the eighteenth century among the ancestors of the majority of Jews in the world today. Seeing matters at this stratospheric and, at least for me, breathtaking level of generalization will undoubtedly be troublesome to some readers, whose minds will move immediately to the exceptions. To these readers I oªer the more limited ﬁndings in the various chapters of the book, which I hope they will ﬁnd valuable, even if detached from my framing hypothesis. Use of the word “genealogy ” in the title is intended to be an allusion to Nietzsche, who used the term to a‹rm multiplicity and diversity. It is my attempt to free the term “modernity ” from its ossiﬁed or coagulated set of associations in Jewish historiography, its being linked to particular criteria such as Enlightenment, Emancipation, urbanization, and the like, and thus to let “modernity ” ﬂoat freely, signifying only a vast set of possibilities during the past two hundred years or so.\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page xvii\n\nA Note on Place-Names and Transliteration\n\nThe thorny issue of how to designate the names of places has not been easy to resolve consistently. The simplest solution would have been to use exclusively the contemporary name of the town or region with the exception of places like Kiev, Kraków, and Warsaw that have well-known and commonly used designations in English. There are, though, serious problems with this solution. Since this book is concerned primarily with the period before the partitions of Poland, I have designated places named in the text by their eighteenth-century names. The ﬁrst time a place is mentioned, the contemporary name of the place is given in parentheses together, if appropriate, with other names. As a reference authority for contemporary place-names, I have relied on Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary, 3d ed. (2001). All the variants on place-names are found in the index. Modern place-names are used on the maps for the convenience of the reader. I have used a highly simpliﬁed system of transliteration from Hebrew that is intended simply as a guide to pronunciation. The reader who knows Hebrew will be able to deduce what word is meant, while the reader who does not will be able to know how the word is pronounced. There are no dashes between articles and the words they modify. Only proper names are capitalized.\n\nxvii\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page xviii\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page xix\n\nAbbreviations\n\nADO\n\nAdministracja dóbr opatowskich\n\nAGAD\n\nArchiwum Glówne Akt Dawnych, Warsaw\n\nAGZ\n\nAkta grodzkie i ziemskie z czasów Rzeczypospolitej polskiej z archiwum tak zwanego Bernardynskiego we Lwowie.

Treatments of the modern history of Jews in Europe have tended to minimize or even omit the community in Poland-Lithuania in the eighteenth century because the deﬁning criteria of modernity cannot be found there. Most often, these deﬁning criteria of modernity in Jewish history are understood to be the progressive integration of Jews into society at large and the exchange of particularistic Jewish values, in varying degrees, for a more universal worldview. Whatever the criteria, the largest concentration of Jews in the world is omitted from the discussion. Since historians have always been part of the very process they describe, they tend to seek out the origins of modernity along the same continuum of westernization in which they ﬁnd themselves, rather than seeking it in the considerably diªerent experience of eastern European Jews. I contend that the criteria for dividing Jewish history into periods should be drawn from the Jewish experience itself—in particular, from the experience of the majority of the Jewish people. The contention that modern Jewish history should be seen in its own right is not new. Almost seventy years ago, Benzion Dinur (1884–1973), the founder of Zionist historiography, pointed out that historians have most often invoked criteria drawn from outside the realm of Jewish historical action to deﬁne the modern period in Jewish history. By action, he meant something akin to what contemporary students of postcolonial history refer to as “agency.” Dinur rejected both the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) and Emancipation as beginning points of modernity, because neither development reﬂected “the real historical content” of the 1\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page 2\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nlife of Jews in the modern period, and nor could either be identiﬁed with the realm of Jewish “historical activity.” For Dinur, modern Jewish history began with the ªaliyah (“going up” to the Holy Land) of Judah Hassid of Szydlowiec (ca. 1660–1700) and his several hundred Shabbatean followers in 1700. By this act of emigration in preparation for the return of Shabbetai Tsevi (d. 1676), whom they believed to be the Messiah, these Jews became agents of their own history. “There is no other event that is so interpenetrated with the historical paths of the people of Israel in modern times in all their variety,” Dinur writes. “This period . . . which culminated with international recognition of Jewish independence in the land of Israel . . . necessarily begins with the ﬁrst ªaliyah, which saw itself as a harbinger of redemption.”1 Dinur’s analysis is obviously open to criticism as a Whiggish choice dictated by his understanding of Jewish history as leading inevitably to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.2 On the other hand, the very enterprise of Jewish historiography is predicated on the assumption that Jews have made their own history and have not merely been carried along like so much ﬂotsam and jetsam on the currents of wider trends. Gershom Scholem (1897–1981), the towering ﬁgure of twentieth-century Jewish studies and architect of the study of Jewish mysticism, suggested that the Shabbatean messianic movement of 1665–66 marked a break in Jewish history. He argued that a new period emerged at that time in which growing numbers of people, intoxicated by the belief that the Messiah had come, freed themselves in varying degrees from the regimens of traditional Jewish society.3 Be this as it may, surely the so-called freeing of the individual had more to do with Renaissance values and subsequent developments in European thought than it did with “the mystical messiah.” Whatever criteria have been used, the historical literature implies that for a century or more after it had reached western Europe, the majority of Jews, living in the largest Jewish community,4 eluded modernity.

My concern is the exclusive focus on that “vanguard” in a way that omits the pattern of development of the majority of Jews in Europe.\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page 3\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nis the approach I seek to revise. I believe that there are grave distortions in the way scholars have described modernity in Jewish history. Historians have placed too much emphasis on change and ideology, too much emphasis on religious behavior and belief as indicators of change; too much emphasis on regions where few Jews lived and not enough on the areas where most Jews lived. History is not a train that progressively moved across Europe from west to east bringing the same developments to diªerent countries, each in its turn. Such thinking involves the twin fallacies, in historical contexts, of teleology and linearity. Jews in Europe responded to the developments associated with modernity—the rise of the bourgeoisie, technological change, the Enlightenment—along a continuum from total identiﬁcation to utter rejection, all of which are part of modern Jewish history. The responses of many Jews in East Central Europe to the Hasidic movement, for example, are an important part of the same story. There is no single goal toward which human history moves, and there is no consistent direction in which humanity has developed. Consequently, I propose to empty the term “modernity ” of all but its chronological content and to deﬁne it merely as roughly the past two centuries. Anyone inhabiting that time period is thus, by deﬁnition, “modern.” In this way, we free ourselves from the restrictive dichotomy (and coercive discourse) of “tradition and change” and can confront the more complex, and more human, reality of the coexistence of a multitude of behaviors and outlooks that were constantly in a state of ﬂux. This book looks at the question: “Who were the Jews when they encountered modernity?” I suggest that the various aspects of the Jewish experience highlighted here formed a particular mentalité and self-evaluation at the core of Jewish identity. To understand the developments among Jews of recent centuries properly, one must investigate the experiences of the majority of Jews in their own contexts. Because the ancestors of about 80 percent of world Jewry lived in the Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania in the eighteenth century, it is they who must be placed at the center of any understanding of the Jewish experience. The lives and values of such a great number were not marginal and should not be subordinated to some extraneous “progressive” model of modernity. By close reading of the past, I hope to identify a magmatic level of Jewish experience, that is, the elemental continuities that persist from the early modern period almost to the present. I contend that the conventional aspects of modernity have been grafted, often imperfectly, onto those elemental continuities through adaptation, appropriation, and negotiation. The task is to reread the historical record\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page 4\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwith an eye to understanding what in the actual experience and life of eastern European Jewry has led to this subterranean stratum that continues to underlie the modern Jewish sensibility. I am going to argue that a combination of elements in the experience of eighteenth-century eastern European Jews, including the concentration of large numbers, a continuing attitude of superiority to their neighbors, the secure place of and indispensable role played by Jews in the economy of the region, and the general absence of what I call the “beckoning bourgeoisie,” strengthened and deepened a positive sense of Jewish identity. This became the central ingredient of the mentalité of East European Jews and constituted a kind of social-psychological translation of the concept of chosenness. My suggestion is that, in subsequent centuries, despite ideological, geographical, economic, political, and even linguistic and cultural change, and for all the exceptions that might be cited, the vast majority of eastern European Jews and their descendants carried this core, even if transvalued, sense of chosenness with them. This book is an attempt to explain how this mentalité was formed. A number of obstacles, or existential problems, impede the recovery and representation of the experience of Jews in early modern PolandLithuania and obscure eªorts to see the period clearly. These impediments arise along the asymmetrical and uneven cusp between the expectations and desires of the reader and those of the historian. Although they cannot be overcome entirely, it may be helpful to explicate these problems brieﬂy before turning to the eighteenth century. There is, ﬁrst, the Jewish reader’s desire to see his or her ancestors in a favorable light, coupled with a reluctance to accept impiousness in the generations of the past and a natural tendency to romanticize, even sanctify, the historical record. A second, more di‹cult problem is the Holocaust. Our knowledge of where history leads acts as a distorting prism, impeding our vision of what came before. It is important to avoid the fallacy of seeing all of eastern European Jewish history as leading inexorably to the Nazi genocide. The earlier periods should be viewed unshadowed by future events. While it is true that the story ends in virtual annihilation, many centuries of life and vitality preceded those terrible events. The third problem is the tendency of many contemporary Jews to equate the terms “Pole” and “antisemite.” A former prime minister of the State of Israel echoed the opinion of many when he summed up this view by declaring that “Poles get antisemitism with their mothers’ milk.” The bitterness underlying such a statement arose from the personal experiences of many Polish Jews in the 1930s. Whatever the perceived accuracy of this view is for the period between the world wars, if extended back in time\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page 5\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nto the eighteenth century, this attitude constitutes a profound distortion of the historical record and conceals a much more complicated and varied picture. Throughout this book, I have assiduously tried to avoid placing a deﬁnite article before the word “Jews” when Jews are the subject of a sentence. Certainly, the Jews were treated collectively in legislation, and prejudice was directed against an undiªerentiated group, and, what’s more, Jews in Poland and Lithuania shared a common language and culture. Jews, however, did not act collectively to gain control of domestic commerce, for example. One may say that the Jews of the Polish Commonwealth spoke Yiddish, but one may not say that the Jews controlled international trade in Poland in the late eighteenth century. Polish Jews, in such cases, cannot be seen as a monolithic community without endangering truth. I cannot stress enough the heterogeneous character of this very large community of Jews. On the other hand, the central hypothesis of this book concerns just such a generalization. I am endeavoring to explain the roots of what I characterize as an eastern European Jewish mentality. If I plead guilty to essentializing eastern European Jews in this way, it is because I believe my argument provides a useful framework for distinguishing the eastern European Jewish experience from other Jewish stories. The earliest known portrait of a Polish Jew depicts a woman. In Xwaniec (Zhvanets) in 1781, the king himself ordered his court painter, Krzysztof Radziwillowski, to paint a portrait of Chajke, the daughter of Abramek of Lwów.5 The dignity, pride and wealth of the subject of the 5. The painting, listed in the catalogue of Poniatowski’s collection as Portrait de la juive Czayka, is in the collections of the National Museum in Warsaw (Inv. 129541). A companion painting of a younger, unmarried woman, listed in the same catalogue as Portrait de la juive Elia, is housed in the Palace Museum at Wilanów (National Museum Inv. 129165). I found the inscription: “Roku 1781 dnia 14 listopada z rozkazu Najjasniejszego Pana Króla J Mosci zwiedzajccego brzegi Dniestru w Xwanca przedstawiona Chajka córka Kupca Abramka Lwowskim zwanego tym portretem odmalowana przez urodzonego Krzysztofa Radziwillowskiego” on the back of both paintings! However, in both cases the inscriptions are copies of the originals. The younger woman has been identiﬁed by some as possibly the daughter of Chajka. For another interpretation, see E. Podhorizer-Sandel, “Judaica w Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie,” BZIH 78 (1971): 55–56. Scholarly opinion as to which painting depicts Chajke and which Elia, or Ella, has been divided. Both the original catalogue and the scholar Marek Rostworowski identify the older woman, whose portrait is reproduced here, as Chajke. I agree with them.

Chajke’s evident self-respect and self-conﬁdence embody the central motif of my book and that is why she graces its cover. Ibrahim ibn Jakub, a tenth-century Spanish Jew who traveled to Prague, provided an early report of Poland to his monarch. He may have gathered his information from Jewish merchants in Prague without personally visiting Polish lands. There is evidence of Jewish communities in Poland by the early eleventh century, but we do not know whether these were permanent settlements.6 The presence of Jews in the western parts of the country in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is attested by hordes of silver coins with Hebrew inscriptions that date from those years. Among the earliest documentary evidence is the ﬁrst charter or privilege to Jews in Poland issued by Boleslaw the Pious in 1264. It contained no restrictions on Jewish rights of residence or economic activity and established the principle of Jewish juridical and communal autonomy. Indeed, the legal status of Jews improved continuously during the ensuing centuries. Precisely when Jews ﬁrst came to Poland is unknown. A few Jews may have come from Khazaria, Byzantium, and from Kievan Rus (the medieval Russian kingdom, with its capital at Kiev) in the early Middle Ages, but the overwhelming majority came from the west, from Ashkenaz (German and Bohemian lands west of Poland). The expulsion of Jews from the Iberian Peninsula had no signiﬁcant impact in Poland. Only a tiny number of Spanish exiles came to Poland, mainly via the Ottoman Empire or Italy.7 Migration of Jews to Poland continued during the fourteenth, ﬁfteenth, and sixteenth centuries. By the sixteenth century, there were some 50,000 Jews in Poland. Their situation surprised a visiting papal diplomat, who reported in 1565: 6.

There is no evidence to support the theory that the ancestors of Polish Jewry were Jews who came from the Crimean Jewish kingdom of Khazaria. The best-known advocate of this theory was Arthur Koestler, whose book The Thirteenth Tribe (New York, 1976) was heavily inﬂuenced by Abraham Poliak’s Khazaria: Toledot mamlakhah yehudit (Tel Aviv, 1951). 7. Jan Zamoyski, one of the most interesting and powerful noblemen of his day (1542– 1605), decreed that he would only allow Sephardic Jews in a new city he was building (Zamosd), and a dozen or so Sephardic families settled there.

They do not live here under pitiful conditions and do not engage in lowly pursuits. . . . But rather, they possess land, engage in commerce, and devote themselves to study, especially medicine and astrology. . . . They possess considerable wealth and they are not only among the respectable citizens, but occasionally even dominate them. They wear no special marks to distinguish them from Christians and are even permitted to wear the sword and to go about armed. In general, they enjoy equal rights.8\n\nA contemporary Jewish assessment of the community ’s happy situation in Poland is gleaned from a gloss on a rabbinic tale by Samuel Eliezer ben Yehuda Halevi Edels, known as MaHaRShA (Moreinu HaRav Shmuel Edels) (1555–1631).9 In the original story, Jews wandered in the sea searching for a place to settle; in Edels’s adaptation, they wandered in the heart of the “sea of exile” (beºimkei metsulot yam hagalut). In both stories, they found a great, ﬂat, fertile plain and settled there, for they thought they had found dry land and forgot they were in exile (sevurim hem deyabashta hava ve-leika galuta). (It turned out, the tale warns, that the ﬁeld was the back of a great beast. When ﬁres were kindled in the hearths, the ﬂames awakened the beast. It reared up and threw them oª.) An echo of this sense of rootedness and comfort is caught in the words of the eighteenth-century mystic Pinhas of Korzec (Korets) (1726–1791), who said that “in Poland exile is less bitter than anywhere else.”10 Polish Jews and their neighbors felt that the Jewish community was a rooted and permanent one. Jewish legends of origin reveal a positive outlook and a conviction of the antiquity of their residence in the country. A pun on the Hebrew name for Poland, Polin, is revealing. A group of exiled Jews is said to have crossed the Polish border and to have heard a divine voice saying to them, “Poh lin,” that is, “Dwell here.”11 Other tra8.

S. Y. Agnon, in his retelling of the story, treats poh lin as a prayer: “Why was it called Polin? Because the Jewish people said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: ‘Master of the Universe, if the hour of our redemption has not yet arrived, dwell here [ poh lin] through this night of exile with us, until You bring us up to the Land of Israel.’” S.

As early as the ﬁfteenth century, a leading rabbi, Moses ben Isaac Mintz, could say that Poland was “from of old a refuge for the exiled children of Israel.”12 In the same century, the Polish chronicler Jan Dlugosz recorded the legend of Esterke, the Jewish mistress of Kazimierz Wielki (Casimir the Great), king of Poland (1333–1370). Dlugosz reports that Esterke used her inﬂuence over the monarch to persuade him to invite Jews to settle in Poland and to grant them extensive rights and privileges. Kazimierz had four children by Esterke, Dlugosz adds: two boys and two girls, and they raised the sons as Christians, the daughters as Jews.13 Dlugosz wished to cast aspersions both on the king and on the legitimacy of the Jews’ privileges, but whatever the historicity of the details of the story—to this day the burial place of Esterke can be found in several Polish towns—it tells us a good deal about ﬁfteenth-century attitudes to Jews in Poland. The tale also conveys some other messages, among them that Jews had resided in Poland for a long time; that Jews were perceived as a ﬁxed and continuing part of the social landscape of Poland; that Jews had extensive rights and privileges; and that the Polish crown protected Jews. The detail that the girls were raised as Jews is particularly telling. Such a thought would have been outlandish if not unthinkable in western Europe of the ﬁfteenth century. Despite the fact that Dlugosz condemns King Kazimierz for this (“id quoque abhominabile et execrandum, quod ﬁlias ex eadem Iudea Hester susceptas in ritum Iudaicum transferri asseritur permisisse”) and wrote his chronicle under the inﬂuence of a patron who bore great animus toward the king, the assertion remains a noteworthy one. Thus, both Polish Jews and their Christian neighbors shared the sense\n\n“Kedumot,” as quoted by H. Bar-Itzhak, Jewish Poland: Legends of Origin.

The legendary etymologies of the terms “Polin” and “Polanyah” reveal an understanding by Jews of their residence as divinely ordained. It is very striking indeed that this huge Jewry, resident in Polish lands for so many centuries, produced no messiahs. There were messiahs from Spain, from Italy, from Yemen, and from elsewhere, but none from Poland.14 The great movement of spiritual awakening that arose in Poland-Lithuania at the end of the eighteenth century did not have a messianic character. The emphasis was on personal, not national, redemption. Another “myth of origin” recorded in the eighteenth century conveys the sense of cultural and moral superiority characteristic of eastern European Jews. The gap between Jew and Christian was not only a matter of cultural diªerence. On the side of Jews, it was also a consequence of their conviction of cultural superiority. The multiple references in the Jewish literature of the time to “our long and bitter exile,” for example, had a binary connotation. They not only lamented Jewish suªering and oppression but also provided a certain oblique comfort in the conviction of superiority to other nations. An eighteenth-century preacher berated his listeners one Sabbath using the following interpretation: “These are the people of the Lord, yet they had to leave His land” [Ezek. 36:20, cf. BT Yoma 86a]. The explanation of the passage is similar to the response of one of the noblemen of Poland to the Jews who were “goring” each other before him: “Why are you here? When you were exiled from your land, your enemies drove you far away, not to nearby regions.” This was because in those days, the residents of Poland were immoral in their ways, and the noblemen saw that the Jews were restrained. And so the nobles brought Jews to this country to learn from their deeds. “Now [continued the nobleman to the Jews] since your ways are more immoral than those of the Gentiles here in your pursuit of honors and in your squabbling, why are you here?” Thus it is written: It was said to them, is this the people of God famous for their goodness? And so we should read, “They had to leave the land to which they were exiled.” They did not stay there to teach the Gentiles their ways, since now they are worse than them. And what are you doing here?15\n\n14. Gerson D. Cohen, “Messianic Postures of Ashkenazim and Sephardim,” in Studies of the Leo Baeck Institute, ed. M. Kreutzberger (New York, 1967), 115–56.

Now, says the preacher, when Jews are even worse than their neighbors, the Polish nobleman may well ask, “What are you doing here?” Implicit in the preacher’s message is the unquestionable moral superiority of Jews. The rhetoric of absurd exaggeration in an eªort to rebuke his people has him putting into the mouth of a Polish nobleman the unimaginable idea that Jews were even more immoral than the native Poles.16 Polish Jewry was Ashkenazic in every respect. The migrants brought their culture with them: their language—Yiddish; their spiritual values; their liturgical and legal (halakhic) traditions; their autonomous institutions; their political strategies and behavior. We turn ﬁrst to spiritual values. The sixteenth-century Polish rabbi Solomon Luria, known as MaHaRShaL (Moreinu HaRav Shlomoh Luria), claimed descent from the medieval German Jewish Pietists known as Hassidei Ashkenaz. For Luria, this was not merely a question of biology. For Polish Jewry, the writings of the Pietists became the models of the loftiest spiritual values. Indeed, the mentalité of Polish Jewry—its worldview and outlook— was fundamentally shaped by the teachings of Hassidei Ashkenaz.17 Israel Ta-Shma has argued that groups of Hassidei Ashkenaz actually moved to Poland in the thirteenth century.18 Whether, and to what extent, they were actually present in Poland, their inﬂuence is undeniable. The teachings of the Pietists can be seen as embracing four distinct attitudes. Above all, the Pietists stressed personal humility. A hassid ex-\n\n16. I should like to draw attention in passing to the historical construction here that has precisely the nobility bringing Jews to Poland, and not, as might intuitively be expected, the monarch. 17. These hassidim should not be confused with the eighteenth-century movement of religious revival known as Hasidism. See Hayyim Hillel Ben-Sasson, “Shorshei hamahshavah shel hokhmei Polin,” in id., Hagut vehanhagah (Jerusalem, 1959), 11–17; Jacob Elbaum, Teshuvat halev vekabalat yisurim: Iyunim beshitot hateshuvah shel hokhmei Ashkenaz uPolin, 1348–1648 (Jerusalem, 1992). Haym Soloveitchik, “Piety, Pietism and German Pietism: Sefer Hasidim I and the Inﬂuence of Hasidei Ashkenaz,” Jewish Quarterly Review 92, nos. 3–4 (2002): 488– 90, seeks to qualify the idea expressed here. On Hasidei Ashkenaz, there are a considerable number of studies: see, e.g., Yosef Dan, Torat hasod shel hassiduth Ashkenaz (Jerusalem, 1968); Ivan Marcus, Piety and Society: The Jewish Pietists of Medieval Germany (Leiden, 1981); id., ed., Dat vehevrah bemishnatam shel hassidei Ashkenaz (Jerusalem, 1986).

This humility of the Pietists, secondly, was linked to a negative valuation of hanaºah, of physical, this-worldly pleasure in the hope of an increased reward in the next world. Moreover, they stressed retson haBore (“the desire of the Creator”) or din shamayim (“the law of Heaven”), that is, the necessity for a Pietist to go beyond the simple requirements of the halakha. Finally, the Pietists’ focus was largely interior, and they were preoccupied with attaining purity of soul. Their constant concern was yirat shamayim, the fear of God, understood to be the fear that one was not su‹ciently constant or intense in one’s love of God. With such a spiritual and interior focus as an important religious ideal, it is not surprising that Polish-Lithuanian Jews appear to us as passive in the face of history and to have abdicated from collective, national, political action as opposed to reaction. It is well to remember, however, that townspeople in general in the Commonwealth were virtually powerless to initiate political action.19 The wielding of power was conﬁned to the nobility. This is not to say that Polish Jews did not know how to defend themselves by “lobbying” centers of power. In fact, they were quite adept at it. The prowess of Jewish lobbyists at the Polish parliament, or Sejm, was legendary. Such endeavors, however, were reactive and defensive. On the other hand, we might well regard such political behavior as rooted in realism. And because a sense of “at-homeness” characterized Polish Jewry, it did not need to resort to the fantasy of messianism as a means of altering reality. The eight or nine decades of material prosperity and relative security experienced by Polish Jews prior to 1648 witnessed the appearance of a virtual galaxy of sparkling intellectual ﬁgures. The list of prominent halakhists, commentators, and preachers from this period includes Solomon Luria (ca. 1510–1574), Moses Isserles (ca. 1525–1572), Ephraim Ljczyce (Luntshits, 1550–1619), Meir Lublin (1558–1616), and Joel Sirkes (1561– 1640), who among others produced enduring contributions to the canon of high culture. Great academies were established in Lublin and Kraków, in Brzesd Litewski (Brest Litovsk; Brisk) and Lwów (Lºviv), in Ostróg (Ostrog), and in other towns. These attracted students from all over Poland and from territories further west. Most of the scholars mentioned were drawn from the same thin stratum at the top of Jewish society and, 19. See Jacob Goldberg, “Poslowie miasta Lwowa na sejmy wobec Xydów lwowskich w XVII–XVIII wieku,” Rocznik Naukowo-Dydaktyczny WSP w Krakowie 203 (1999): 85–94.\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page 12\n\n12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nas Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson has shown, reﬂected the values of the cultural and economic elite.20 While the rabbinic members of the elite were teaching and writing, they often also were involved in trading, and to a limited extent, banking. This same group dominated the elaborately organized and oligarchic communal governments, so that the authority deriving from their learning was accompanied by a measure of political power. The courts over which they presided resolved disputes according to halakha or by arbitration. Taxes, direct and indirect, were assessed and collected. Weights and measures in the marketplace were monitored; the water supply was assured; hygiene was maintained in the streets; the equivalent of a police force and ﬁre brigade protected inhabitants. The welfare of the poor was provided for and a “hospital,” along with midwives, and a doctor were paid for by the community. With a view to protecting collective interests, all relations with the government and with individual Christians were supervised, including loans, partnerships, and other business dealings. The community imposed sumptuary laws regulating, among other things, how many people could be invited to a festive occasion and how much jewellery women could wear. The right to live in a town and the right to marry required the assent of communal o‹cials.21 Communities sent representatives to regional and, if they were of su‹cient size and inﬂuence, to national meetings of Polish Jewry—the Council of Four Lands. Royal charters and privileges guaranteed Jews not only residential and occupational rights but also a kind of autonomy that in some ways approached self-government. As the historian Simon Dubnow wrote: “From the days of the Medieval centres in Babylon and Spain, no other land had such a large concentration of Jews and such wide latitude for autonomous development.”22 Indeed, Polish Jewry developed the most elaborate and ramiﬁed institutional structures in European Jewish history: from artisan guilds and voluntary societies, communal governments, and 20. These rabbis taught, for example, a virtually predestinarian doctrine to the eªect that the wealth and authority of the learned were an indication of providential divine blessing.

In these institutions the Jews saw, as Dov Ber Birkenthal, an eighteenth-century memoirist, put it, “a fragmentary redemption and a bit of honor” ( geºulah ketanah umeºat kavod).23 He also suggested that the subsequent partitions of Poland were divine retribution for the disestablishment of the Council of Four Lands in 1764.24 The importance of the council is further reﬂected in the lament of the preacher, Hillel ben Zeºev Wolf: “Without the council, there is no one to go to the lords of the land and the king to bow down and to make requests because of the weight of taxes and evil decrees.”25 The Council of Four Lands appeared some time during the second half of the sixteenth century.26 The exact date of its founding is uncertain because the minute books of the council have not survived. It normally met twice annually, usually at the great fairs in Lublin and Jaroslaw. The council was a sort of bicameral parliament, composed of a lay assembly and a council of rabbis, but the latter ceased to function in about 1720. The two “houses” collaborated on the formulation and execution of legislation. The assembly would identify an issue needing attention, and the rabbinic council would formulate the legislation or edict in accordance with the usages of halakah. The rabbinic council also functioned as an appellate court. Execution of the law was the responsibility of the assembly. The chief preoccupation of the lay assembly, however, was the apportionment of the burden of taxes owed the crown among the regions and communities. That is, from at least 1581, the Council of Four Lands collectively paid the particular tax owed the Treasury by Jews. The nobility complained continually that lump-sum payments of what was intended to be a capitation tax resulted in great losses. Finally, in 1764, in the course of a ﬁscal 23.

It is from these data that we derive our best information about the number of Jews in the Commonwealth at that time. By the seventeenth century, the Jewish community of Poland-Lithuania had become the largest in the Diaspora and seemed to some observers to be expanding at an astonishing rate. In about 1618, the Kraków city council apparently commissioned Sebastian Miczynski, a professor at the Jagiellonian University, to write a book in the service of the struggle of Christian merchants of the city against their Jewish competitors.29 He drew attention to the rapid increase in Jewish numbers and noted that “[n]one of them dies in war or of the plague. . . . Moreover, they marry when they are twelve . . . and so multiply rampantly.”30 Miczynski’s explanation is incorrect: the Jewish rate of growth was due, not to a higher birthrate, but to the fact that rates of infant mortality were lower among Jews than Christians. Thus the proportion of young people among Jews expanded throughout the period. Expanding Jewish numbers contributed to stimulating the movement of Jews to Ukrainian lands, which began to be settled more intensively by them after the Union of Lublin in 1569 led to these territories being transferred to the Polish crown. The monarch bestowed vast tracts on powerful noblemen who wished to develop their newly acquired estates and towns. Although there were Jewish craftsmen and merchants in Ukraine, all the sources agree that the most visible economic activity was leasing parts of holdings or various monopolies from Polish noblemen. The most common type of lease was of “propination” rights, that is, the exclusive right to manufacture, distribute, and sell alcoholic beverages, 27. VL, 7: 44–50. Technically, the word “disestablished” is inappropriate, since no o‹cial government act establishing the Council is known. Nevertheless, government documents over almost two centuries certainly granted implicit o‹cial standing to the Jewish institution. 28.

The Jewish innkeeper, distiller, or brewer became a characteristic ﬁgure in the region, so much so that the terms arendarz (leaseholder) and “Jew” became synonymous. To many residents of Ukraine, the Poles had “subjected them to the enemies of Christ, the Jews.”31 Ukrainian peasants resented their Polish lords not only on economic grounds but also on religious and national grounds. The Cossacks too felt their rights were abridged by the Polish state, and their resentment was sometimes couched in religious terms. In the late sixteenth century, an Orthodox religious and cultural revival erupted in Ukraine and Belarus, motivated substantially by a desire to resist both Jesuit and Protestant advances. The Union of Brest (1596) creating the so-called Greek Catholic, or Uniate, Church, which followed Orthodox practice but paid allegiance to the pope in Rome rather than the patriarch in Constantinople, further complicated the matter. The Cossacks saw the bishops who accepted the Union of Brest as traitors. Finally, there was a national dimension to this struggle. When Bohdan Khmelnytskyi (1595–1657), the leader of the uprising that exploded in 1648, entered Kiev in January 1649, after initial victories against the Poles, he was hailed as the Moses of Ukraine, ruler of the Rus (i.e., Ukrainian) people, liberator of Ukraine from Polish slavery, and Batko (Father) Bohdan. To the people of Ukraine, Catholic priests, Polish noblemen, and Jews were all oppressors. For Jews, the period of almost twenty years of chaos that began with the Cossack uprising in the middle years of the seventeenth century was the worst, in terms of the number of lives lost, in European Jewish history to that date. In the years following 1648, Jews were attacked and murdered in succession by Cossacks and peasants, by the Russian army that invaded Poland, ostensibly in support of the Cossacks, and by Polish forces during their struggle against yet another invader—the Swedes. Thousands of Jews lost their lives; others ﬂed westward.32 The Jewish population, however, recovered rather quickly from these blows. Major centers of Jewish settlement were reestablished precisely in the regions of the Cossack attacks, except for the eastern portion of Ukraine that was annexed by 31.

Shaul Stampfer is preparing a book that includes an attempt to calculate Jewish losses in the mid seventeenth century. His calculations, based on a careful evaluation of demographic information from before and after the catastrophic years, reduce the absolute number of victims to about 13,000 but maintain the tragic proportions of the loss of Jewish lives in Ukrainian lands in those years.\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page 16\n\n16\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRussia, where Jews were forbidden to reside.33 The poisonous mix of national, economic, and religious hatred, however, continued to infect Ukraine. Still, the reign of Jan Sobieski (1674–1696) saw considerable recovery and rebuilding. The ﬁrst decades of the eighteenth century were a period of almost complete chaos in Poland-Lithuania. The Northern War (1700–1721) against Sweden and the internecine strife within Poland that accompanied it were attended by enormous destruction, epidemics, and famine.34 Jewish communities suªered along with the rest of the country.35 In a striking reﬂection of the links that tied together Jews in various parts of Europe, Sephardi Jews in London allocated £276 9s. (1,595 Reichstalers) in 1710 “for our poor brethren in Poland in view of their calamities,” to be distributed among more than two dozen communities, including Poznan, Kalisz, Krotoszyn, Kraków, Opatów, Pinczów, and Szydlów.36 Even before the outbreak of the Northern War, renewed Cossack insurgency had begun in the 1680s and continued until about 1715. Struggles between Haidamaks, or Cossacks, and Polish authorities began again in the 1730s, culminating at Human (Uman) in 1768. When Stanislaw August Poniatowski was elected king of Poland on September 6, 1764, he immediately set about attempting to reform the Polish political system. He was stymied by Russian opposition and was only able to implement the ﬁscal reform referred to earlier that included the disestablishment of the Council of Four Lands. In fact, the Russians virtually controlled Lithuania and had troops stationed in Ukrainian lands from at least the 1740s on. Frustration among magnates and noblemen led to the Confederation of Bar in 1768, a legal rebellion or civil war between the reformers and their Russian-backed opponents. The confederates evaded defeat by the Russians for four years, until growing interference 33.

Acting without the agreement of the Polish Sejm, Augustus II’s attempt to conquer Livonia brought Poland into the war with Sweden. Polish troops were no match for the Swedes, and Charles XII’s armies marched across the country. The Polish nobility split into pro-Swedish and pro-Saxon confederations. Eventually, the pro-Saxon Sandomierz Confederation defeated the pro-Swedish forces. 35.

This foreign interference led to the annexation and progressive disappearance of Poland from the map of Europe in successive partitions of Poland in 1772, 1793, and 1795. Military disorder in the state and national, religious, and economic complaints in Ukraine, as well as rumors that the Bar Confederates intended to extirpate Orthodox Christianity, led to the great Cossack (Haidamak) and peasant uprising of 1768, the Kolishchyzna, led by Maksim Zalizniak (XeleWniak), which was ultimately put down by combined Polish and Russian forces. At the height of the rebellion, the rebels controlled almost all of Kiev and Braclaw (Bratslav) provinces and parts of Volhynia. There were ferocious murders of Polish noblemen, Catholic priests, and Jews. In the worst episode, at least two thousand Catholic noblemen and Jews who had taken refuge in the town of Human (Uman) were ruthlessly murdered. The commander of the Polish forces, Ivan Gonta, betrayed the Jews and his own comrades and joined the Haidamak forces. Then, as one chronicler described, “They marched together on Human. On their way, wherever they found Jews or gentry, these were cut to pieces . . . and they ﬁlled the whole town of Human with corpses. The deep well in the marketplace was ﬁlled with the bodies of dead children. The peasants in the [surrounding] villages robbed and killed the Jews and their children.” The slaughter in Human came only after Jews had participated in signiﬁcant numbers in the military defense of the town, led by Leib Sharogorodski and Moses Menaker.37 As mentioned, the military chaos and vast destruction of the period of the Bar Confederation came to a halt with the partitioning of PolandLithuania in 1772 by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The Commonwealth lost about 30 percent of its territory and a slightly larger percentage of its 37.

Within the remaining territory, Russia retained its dominance by diplomacy, the threat of arms, and bribing key o‹cials. In the course of the eighteenth century, millions of Jewish lives were lived on the lands of Poland-Lithuania. Virtually all of the heterogeneity and diversity that so large a human community is capable of was played out there during that century. Fasting and feasting; perfunctory prayer and mystical intensity; chastity and licentiousness; proprietary sadness and God-intoxicated joy; vast wealth and dire poverty; orderly patriarchal solemnity and impudent, rebellious youth were all part of Jewish life. Such extremes of experience were nevertheless bounded by commonalities and shared patterns that gave structure to communities and deﬁned their Jewish aspect. The Jewish calendar deﬁned the rhythm of the day, the week, and the year; the language in which life was apprehended was Yiddish; the commandments that were observed or transgressed were the deﬁning categories of value. And what distinguished Polish Jewry from other Jewish communities, aside from sheer numbers, was its extraordinary vitality. This vitality expressed itself in the ramiﬁed autonomous institutions, the cultural creativity, and the singular sense of both independence and rootedness that characterized the Jewish community of Poland-Lithuania. Eighteenth-century Polish-Lithuanian Jewry inhabited a cultural universe constructed of elements that arose out of its own traditions. It was, in the Weberian sense, a “traditional society.” The basic values and patterns of behavior by which most Jews lived their lives were unexamined and unselfconscious. The most recurrent observation about Jews in Poland-Lithuania in the travel literature of the period was how numerous Jews were. Nathaniel William Wraxall (1751–1831), an English diplomat and member of parliament, visited Warsaw in the late 1770s, at a time when Jews constituted no more than 5 percent of the city ’s population. Yet he was impressed with the size of the Jewish population and noted that “Warsaw is . . . crowded with Jews, who form a considerable portion of the inhabitants.”38 In the villages and smaller towns, other travelers also seemed to ﬁnd only Jews: “a village called Marienpoint . . . is inhabited by a few families, chieﬂy Jews.”39 Synatine (Szniatyn?) “is . . . a poor village inhabited by\n\n38.

The houses are entirely of wood, with a population of about three hundred Jews.”41 Impressions were the same in Lithuania. The town of Orcha, Robert Johnston, an English observer, reported, had a population of about two thousand, “and consists mostly of Jews.”42 The village of Liadi was “inhabited by a colony of Jews.”43 Archdeacon William Coxe, perhaps the best known of the English travelers of this period, as well as the most scholarly, asserted that Jews in Lithuania were even more numerous than those of Poland. Indeed, they “seem to have ﬁxed their headquarters in this duchy. If you ask for an interpreter, they bring you a Jew: if you come to an inn, the landlord is a Jew; if you want post-horses, a Jew procures them, and a Jew drives them; if you wish to purchase, a Jew is your agent: and this is perhaps the only country in Europe where Jews cultivate the ground: in passing through Lithuania, we frequently saw them engaged in sowing, reaping, mowing and other works of Husbandry.”44 John Thomas James (1786–1828), an English academician who took holy orders when he returned from the Continent and eventually became bishop of Calcutta, oªered similar observations but added a plausible explanation: We now crossed the frontier of Poland, and passed from the land of the credulous to the habitations of the unbelievers, for every house we saw was in the hands of Jews. They seemed, indeed, the only people who were in a state of activity, exercising almost all professions, and engaged in every branch of trade; millers, whitesmiths, saddlers, drivers, ostlers, innkeepers, and sometimes even as farmers. Their constant bustle makes them appear more abundant in number than they really are; and although the streets of Zytomir [Xytomierz; Zhytomyr] seemed full of them, we were informed that out of a population of 6,000, not more than one third were of this sect, . . . we could easily have imagined the contrary to have been the fact.45\n\nJews were usually identiﬁable by their costumes and appearance, which also made them stand out in the eyes of foreign visitors. 40.

Coxe noted that “the only places of reception for travellers were hovels, belonging to Jews, totally destitute of furniture and every species of accommodation.”50 John Ledyard, an American traveler, found that Jews “keep the Stage houses on the Road.”51 At least for the eastern half of the Polish Commonwealth, the travelers’ impressions were not far from wrong. Overall, in 1765, 750,000 Jews formed about 5.35 percent of the population of the Polish Commonwealth, which is estimated to have been between 12.3 and 14 million.52 The density of Jewish settlement, however, increased dramatically from west to east. Only 12 percent of Polish-Lithuanian Jews lived in Great Poland and 17 percent in Little Poland, whereas 27 percent lived in Lithuania-Belarus, and 44 percent in Ukraine-Ruthenia. In fact, the Jewish experience in the Polish Commonwealth cannot be understood without careful consideration of the demography of the community. 46.

The large numbers of Jews, their residence mainly in urban settlements, their concentration in the eastern half of the Polish Commonwealth, and their continuing expansion all profoundly aªected, not only the relations of Jews with the Polish state and their relations with their non-Jewish neighbors, but also the quality of Jewish culture in East Central Europe. The term “minority ” is used to describe groups outside of the imagined homogeneous citizenry in modern nation-states. It has a set of connotations that are misleading when applied to Jews in the Polish Commonwealth. First of all, identity in premodern European society was characterized by a multiplicity of loyalties and memberships. Indeed, there was no majority as we now understand the term. Local patriotism was the order of the day, and there was little sense of belonging to a nation, let alone a nation-state. Even in the eighteenth century, ethnic Poles were not a majority in Poland-Lithuania. In addition to autochthonous Lithuanians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians, as well as Tatars and Romany, many of the cities and towns were distinguished by ethnic and religious diversity: their inhabitants included Germans, Italians, Scots, Armenians, and Greeks. Therefore, Jews cannot be seen as a minority group when less than 20 percent of the population of the country was urban, and only 40 to 60 percent was ethnically Polish. More important, however, is the fact that about half of the urban population of the Polish Commonwealth was Jewish. A signiﬁcant proportion of Jews lived in towns where there was a Jewish majority, and an even larger 21\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page 22\n\n22\n\nTHE LARGEST JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THE WORLD\n\nproportion can be said to have experienced living in towns where there appeared to be a Jewish majority because so many of the Christian townspeople had turned to agriculture. A substantial majority of Jews lived in communities of ﬁve hundred or more.1 Thus, most of the shops and marketplace stalls, as well as the inns and the taverns, would have belonged to Jews. Indeed, most of the people moving through the streets would have been Jews. In other words, most Jews lived in communities that were quite large enough to support the living of the dailiness of life in a Jewish universe. For these reasons, the term “minority group” is utterly misleading.2 The best estimate of the number of Jews in Poland-Lithuania is the one arrived at by Raphael Mahler based on his analysis of the ﬁscal census carried out in 1764–65 (see table 1). The occasion was the abolition of the Council of Four Lands by the Sejm and the decision to collect the capitation tax on the basis of the actual number of Jews. The actual count was 429,587 for Poland and 157,649 for Lithuania. After correcting for children under one year of age (6.35 percent) and underreporting (20 percent), Mahler concluded that there were 750,000 Jews (549,000 in Poland, 201,000 in Lithuania) in the Polish Commonwealth in 1764–66.3 While tax records are not the best place to seek the truth about any population, Mahler’s corrected ﬁgures for 1764–66 are a sound beginning point, and I shall use them in the analysis below. Mahler’s ﬁgures can be used to estimate the number of Jews in earlier periods. Assuming a moderate rate of growth of 1.6 percent per year, there would have been about 150,000 Jews in Poland-Lithuania in 1660, and 375,000 in 1720.4 The Jewish proportion of the total population of the 1.

Unless otherwise indicated, all of the ﬁgures for 1764–65 mentioned in this chapter follow the analysis of Raphael Mahler, Yidn in amolikn Poyln in likht fun tsifern, 2 vols. (Warsaw, 1958).

His data and procedures have been reviewed by Shaul Stampfer, who concluded that “Mahler’s estimates appear more reasonable than . . . any others.” Stampfer, “The 1764 Census of Polish Jewry,” Bar Ilan: Annual of Bar-Ilan University, Studies in Judaica and the Humanities 24–25 (1989): 72.

Some have suggested a larger proportion. For example, Jerzy Topolski has written that before the First Partition of Poland, Jews made up 9 percent of the total population and between 40 and 50 percent of the urban population of the country. Topolski, “On the Role of the Jews in the Urbanization of Poland in the Early Modern Period,” in The Jews in Poland, ed. Andrzej K. Paluch (Kraków, 1992), 1: 47; id., “The Role of the Jews on the Polish Home Market in the Early Modern Period” (typescript), 6–7.\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page 24\n\n24\n\nTHE LARGEST JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THE WORLD\n\nis between 12.3 and 14 million.6 As indicated earlier, this faster rate of growth was due less to higher birthrates than to lower death rates, since the incidence of infant mortality was lower among Jews. Zdzislaw Budzynski studied twenty-six sets of data from various years between 1777 and 1799 for the following nine localities: Jaslo, Nowy Sccz, Przemysl, Xólkiew (Zhovkva), Belz, Rzeszów, Sambór (Sambir), Sanok, and Lwów. In twenty-ﬁve of the twenty-six cases, the Jewish death rate was lower, and generally signiﬁcantly lower, than the rate for Christians. The Jewish birthrate was higher in ﬁfteen cases. In Bukovina, for example, between 1790 and 1799, the Christian birthrate was 40.2, and the Jewish birthrate was 38.8; the Christian death rate was 21.9, and the Jewish death rate was 17.2; in that decade, the Christian population increased 2.2 times, the Jewish population increased 3.7 times.7 The Jewish population was clearly expanding more rapidly when compared with the entire Christian population of the country. There can be no single explanation of this phenomenon. To a certain extent, the existence of systems of support within the Jewish community undoubtedly helped poorer people in the community to ﬁnd the shelter and nourishment necessary for nurturing children. The relative stability of the Jewish family, which may well have meant lower incidence of sexually transmitted diseases and relatively lower rates of alcoholism, probably also contributed to lower rates of infant mortality among Jews. Finally, the system of kest, in which a newly married couple lived most often with the parents of the bride, also helps to account for the lower rates of infant mortality. The age at marriage of those who expected to be supported by their parents in this way was generally low. Statistics published by Jacob Goldberg show that early marriage and the practice of kest was characteristic of about 25 percent of Jews.8 These were from the wealthier stratum of Jewish society. The housing and provisioning of additional “mouths to feed,” that is, the young couple and newborn children, was possible only for the wealthier members of the community. Thus, in the families best able to provide heat, clothing, and food, the age of the mother at ﬁrst birth was likely to have been the lowest. 6. Although some have put it higher, Emanuel Rostworowski has estimated the proportion of the szlachta as a whole at this time at between 6 and 6.5 percent.

On the basis of comparative data from other years and other regions, however, Mahler proposed that the most reasonable overall estimate of the average size of a Jewish Polish family was ﬁve. In this case, Mahler’s procedure has been questioned. The more likely ﬁgure is probably closer to the one that emerges from the data themselves. Rural Jewish family units were larger than urban ones by about 25 percent.9 The number of Jews per dwelling varied in diªerent regions, and a global average is thus neither useful nor reliable.10 The data on the growth in Jewish numbers, on the other hand, are incontrovertible. And if this growth was, as I have maintained, largely because of a lower rate of infant mortality, it means that the proportion of young people among Jews was expanding continuously. The implications of this aspect of the demographic situation will be explored in later chapters. The Jewish population was unevenly distributed: 44 percent lived in the south-east (Ruthenia-Ukraine) and 27 percent in the north-east (Lithuania-Belarus); 17 percent lived in the central areas (Malopolska, Little Poland), and only about 12 percent lived in the west (Wielkopolska, Great Poland). That is to say, more than 70 percent of the Jewish population of the Polish Commonwealth was concentrated in the eastern half of the country. Five of the six provinces (województwa) with the largest Jewish populations were in the east: Rus (100,111); Volhynia (50,792); Podolia (38, 384); Troki (Trakai) (33,738); and Wilno (Vilnius; Vilna) (26,977). The sixth was Sandomierz, in Little Poland (42,972). The distribution of larger communities followed the same pattern. Of fortyfour towns in which more than one thousand Jews lived, four were in the west, seven in the center, ﬁve in Lithuania-Belarus, and twenty-seven in Ruthenia-Ukraine. One, Warsaw, was in Mazovia. That is to say, the Jewish population became more concentrated as one moved eastward. (See maps 1 and 2.) Slightly more than two-thirds of Jews lived in urban settlements, although many of these were rather small towns, the characteristic form of 9. Stampfer, “1764 Census,” 47–49. 10.

Using tax rolls as a base, Pawel Fijalkowski, Xydzi w województwach ljczyckim i rawskim w XV–XVIII wieku (Warsaw, 1999), 35, found that in the small town of Parczew (Ljczyca province), the average number of Jews per dwelling was 7.1 in 1775 and 14.8 in 1793–94.

Hubert Vautrin, a Frenchman who lived in Poland for several years, wrote that he would not use the French words ville (city) or bourg (market town) to translate the Polish miasto, because the term denotes something that is little more than a village, and the word simply had no analogue in French.11 Even at the end of the eighteenth century, not more than twelve Polish cities had populations in excess of 10,000, while more than a thousand had fewer than 2,000 inhabitants. Despite their small size, those settlements were not agricultural villages, at least not with respect to their Jewish populations. In contrast, most Christian townspeople (60 percent) tended actually to be burghers who had turned to cultivating plots on the edges of the town to support themselves; some were both artisans and farmers at the same time.12 In light of this, it will easily be seen how much, particularly in the eastern half of the Commonwealth, Jews dominated urban commerce and production. In Great Poland, where there was a substantial ethnic German population, Jews made up about 16.5 percent of the population of the towns.13 Archdeacon Coxe’s impression that Jews had “in a manner engrossed all the commerce of the country ” thus becomes easier to comprehend.14 In 1765, the cities with the largest Jewish populations were Brody (ca. 7,000), Lwów (ca. 6,000), and Leszno (ca. 5,000). Kraków, Wilno, and Brzesd-Litewski each had about 3,500 Jewish residents. (See table 1.) There were signiﬁcant regional variations in the urban-rural distribution of the Jewish population. In parts of Western Poland, 2 percent or less of Jewish residents lived in villages.15 In the eastern regions, the rural proportion of the population sometimes exceeded one-third. 11. “Tout ce qui porte le nom de ville ne mérite pas même celui de bourg; la plupart ne sont habitées que par des Juifs et des serfs: on les appelle miasto dans la langue du pays; je leur conserverai cette dénomination de miastes, parce qu’elle n’a point d’analogue dans la langue française.” Hubert Vautrin, La Pologne du XVIIIe siècle vue par un précepteur français, ed.

A signiﬁcant proportion of village Jews, however, were only temporarily rural and either maintained residences in towns or returned to an urban center after the expiration of their arenda (lease) contracts. On average, fewer than two Jewish families (7.1–9.6 people) lived in a village. Moreover, from the last decades of the eighteenth century on, the number and proportion of Jews living in villages constantly diminished. Most Polish villages had no Jewish population. In the Kraków province, for example, Jews lived in fewer than one-third of 2,628 villages. In Galicia in 1785, village Jews accounted for less than 3 percent of the total rural population.16 The Jewish population, in general, was quite mobile, especially the most prosperous and those at the opposite end of the economic scale, the vocationless, itinerant poor. It should be stressed that not only was the Jewish population essentially urban, but that it lived in the midst of a society that was overwhelmingly rural and agricultural. The consequence of this was that half of the urban population, and in large parts of the country more than half, was Jewish. (See table 2.) Questions related to the quality of the exchanges between Jews and Christians in the eighteenth century will often appear in the following\n\n16. Budzynski, Ludnosd pogranicza, 1: 324–25.\n\nHundert, Jews of Poland 9/26/03 8:56 AM Page 30\n\n30\n\nTHE LARGEST JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THE WORLD\n\nchapters. Perhaps it is best to state from the outset that a simple dichotomous view is not nearly complex enough to reﬂect the actual situation. Nevertheless, it would appear, at least at ﬁrst, that the demographic situation argues for Jewish insularity and apartness within the context of Polish-Lithuanian society. The dramatic contrast between the rate of expansion of the Jewish population and that of the Commonwealth’s population as a whole suggests cultural and physical isolation. Culturally, the phenomenon suggests Jewish distinctiveness in matters related to marriage, hygiene, diet, and child rearing. It suggests physical isolation protecting Jews from infection and the spread of communicable diseases. This apparently powerful argument, however, is ﬂawed. It takes the population as a whole, which was overwhelmingly agrarian, as its comparison group. Jews, as noted earlier, were mainly urban. Still, it might be answered, urban European populations in this period, including those in Poland, were unable to reproduce themselves. Yet, the upper socioeconomic strata of those cities did succeed in increasing their numbers, and it may well be that this is the group with which Jews should be compared. For the moment, unfortunately, there are no such ﬁnely tuned studies of Polish urban demography in the eighteenth century. Moreover, the argument for insularity is vitiated considerably by a review of the patterns of residence of Jews. Except for large crown cities like Poznan and Lwów, there was no residential segregation. The degree of concentration of Jewish homes varied somewhat, but in many if not most cases, Jews and Christians lived interspersed.17 The tendency of Jews to live on the marketplace (rynek) intensiﬁed this phenomenon. For example, Jews occupied more than half the dwellings on the marketplace in Dobromil (68 percent), Lancut (84 percent), Chyrów (59 percent), and Sieniawa (87 percent). Overall, of six towns in the Przemysl-Sanok region studied by Jerzy Motylewicz, Jews occupied 119 of 208 houses on the mar17.

Rosman, The Lords’ Jews: Magnate-Jewish Relations in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Eighteenth Century (Cambridge, Mass., 1990), 42–48. In 1764, in the private town of Ula (Polock province), there were nine streets, and Jews lived or owned real estate on seven of them.

In Bilgoraj, Jews owned ﬁfty-six of sixty-eight houses on the marketplace in the latter decades of the eighteenth century.18 The numbers presented here constitute a powerful argument supporting my general contention about the formation of an eastern European Jewish mentality. The dense and growing concentration of Jews in the eastern half of the Polish Commonwealth contributed in a vital way to the creation of conditions—the experience of living in a substantially Jewish universe, of being a minority that is not a minority—in which that mentality could develop. There is no doubt that some degree of material prosperity was a necessary condition for the expansion of the Jewish population. As important, the crucial role Jews played in the economy of the state not only contributed to their physical security but to the self-conﬁdence that characterized their community.\n\n18.

It was mainly Jews who managed the transformation in the use of grain (rye) from primarily an export 1.

This activity accounted for a very large proportion of the income from rural estates. Secondly, the role of Jews as lessees of estate monopolies temporarily counteracted the continuing decline in the e‹ciency of serf labor. And, ﬁnally, growing Jewish numbers and other developments discussed below led to Jews being highly prominent in commerce. The indispensability of Jews to the economy of the Commonwealth contributed substantially to their relative security and self-conﬁdence. It was also a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the character of their relations with their neighbors. As we saw in the previous chapter, the growing number of Jews was overwhelmingly concentrated in the eastern and southern provinces, and Jews constituted even more than 50 percent of the urban population in numerous regions. The role of Jews in commerce, and particularly in the domestic market, was crucial. In some towns, as many as 80 or 90 percent of all merchants were Jewish: in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, of 473 merchants in the town of Rzeszów mentioned in the sources, 412 were Jews. In Przemysl, in the same period, of 137 merchants, 111 were Jews. In the eighteen largest towns of the Przemysl-Sanok region, 745 (76.3 percent) of the 976 merchants were Jews. “Among us you do not have a single Christian merchant, Jews conduct all of the trade,” the Christian burghers of Jaroslaw declared in 1723.2 In Nowy Sccz, in 1733, a municipal o‹cial remarked oªhandedly to the governor of the province that only Jews were occupied with commerce in that town.3 In Tarnów, Jewish shopkeepers were accused of conducting business, contrary to law, on a Christian holy day.
