        "text": "This gig has been moved to our sister venue, Boston Music Room. All tickets remain valid.\n\nARMIA was formed in 1984 in as a result of the contact of three personalities of the Polish independent music scene: Tomasz Budzyński (Siekier), Robert Brylewski (Brygada Kryzys, Izrael) and a philosopher Sławomir Gołaszewski.\n\nThe band released a dozen or so albums, two of which, Legenda and Triodante released in 1990 are now classified as the staple of Polish rock music. During the thirty-something career of the band, many outstanding and distinguished rock musicians played in the band. Currently, the band consists of Tomasz Budzyński - vocal, Amadeusz Kaźmierczak - percussion, Dariusz Budkiewicz - bass guitar, Jakub Bartoszewski - horn, keyboards. Stanisław Budzyński - guitar.\n\nIn 2011, at the Howe Horyzonty International Film Festival in Wrocław, the film \"Journey to the East\" was premiered, which is a poetic story of the band Army based on the story of Stefan Grabiński. It is included in the form of a DVD for the autobiographical book of Tomasz Budzyński \"Soul Side Story\"\n\nThe last release of the band is \"Toń\" released in October 2015. The album is visually apocalyptic and musically is a continuation of the artistic exploration of the band.\n\nSupport from: SickBoy and Rats On Acid\n\nPresented by 1664music and Born Again Concerts"
