Drawn into the POW organization (Pilsudskis conspiratorial organization) after his return from emigration in Petrograd in May 1917 (sympathized with this organization sometime earlier) by Unszlicht.[xii]\n\n-- Unszlicht and I came to a conclusion that the Bolsheviks coming to power would be most useful to us since they proclaimed the right of nations to self-determination.\n\n- Some elements in our POW organization considered joint work with the Bolsheviks necessary at that moment in order to support the Bolshevik coup so as in the future to occupy leading positions in the Soviet government.\n\nThe Polish corps of the General Dowbor-Musnicki[xiii]  Polish military clubs in Leningrad  worked with Unszlicht as secret supporters of Pilsudski.\n\nAt the time of the October revolution, a number of the POW members managed to get important positions:\n\n-Unszlicht  member of the Petrograd rev[olutionary] committee;\n\n-Lenski  commissar for Polish affairs;\n\n-Pestkowski[xiv]  deputy Narkom[xv] Narkomnatz.[xvi]\n\nBy the time of the October coup, members of the POW were also RSDRP(b) members, besides me and Unszlicht, there was Dolecki,[xvii] Slawinski and Cichowski.[xviii] The Polish revolutionary council was created from representatives of parties recognizing the Soviet power: SDPKPiL, PPS-Lewica,[xix] PPS-fraction -- all were the POW members:\n\n- from the SDPKPiL  Leszszynski, Cichowski, Dolecki, Bortnowski, Bobinski,[xx] Mandelbaum[xxi] and Slawinski.\n\n- from the PPS-Lewica -- Lapinski,[xxii] Budkiewicz,[xxiii] his wife,[xxiv] Longwa,[xxv] Muklewicz,[xxvi] Matuszewski,[xxvii] Fabierkiewicz.[xxviii]\n\n- from the PPS-fraction  Sibin, Krahelski,[xxix] Krahelska,[xxx] Puzak,[xxxi] Makowski,[xxxii] Plawski, Zarski(??) and Kochelok <...>.[xxxiii]\n\nThe section of the Polish commissariat existed in a number of cities: for example, in Orel  Kwapinski,[xxxiv] in Minsk - Slawinski, in Moscow  Próchniak, etc.\n\n- Creation of an additional military force for Pilsudski in the USSR.\n\n- In 1918, a conference [held] in Moscow with Pilsudskis envoy, Wieniawa-Dlugoszowski[xxxv] (the Warsaw POW center representative); present  Unszlicht, Pestkowski, Leszszynski, Langwa and Budkiewicz.\n\nA number of positions were worked out to accelerate the formation of a reserve infantry division.\n\n- Against the Brest peace[xxxvi]  connection with the left SRs[xxxvii] to overthrow the Soviet government, arrest Lenin and form a new government on the basis of a bloc of the left SRs and left Communists[xxxviii], since the members of our POW organization were affiliated with the latter.\n\n- I know from Pestkowski that, on behalf of our organization, [he] maintained a connection with the representative of French intelligence in Moscow, together they sought to subvert the Brest peace and involve Russia in continuing the war with Germany.\n\n- The surrender of Vilno was made by the POW people  Unszlicht, et al.\n\n- During the Polish-Soviet war (1919-1920), almost all members of our organization on the western front occupied important positions and conducted propaganda work.\n\n- Passing Soviet military plans and information about Soviet troops to the Polish high command.\n\n- Setting the peasants on the territory under Red Army control against Soviet power.\n\n- Failure to destroy bridges and passages when the Red Army was in retreat.\n\n- The activities of Polish saboteurs in the Red Army was facilitated in every way possible.\n\nIn the fall of 1920, I was recalled from the Southwestern front to Moscow, from where the CC RKP(b) sent me to Riga as a political consultant to the Soviet peace delegation negotiating with Poland.Miller,[xxxix] another member of the POW, was there, too. Exploiting the difficulties of the peace process, we sought to gain the greatest possible concessions to Poland from the Soviet government.\n\nThis resulted in:\n\na) The forfeiting of Soviet Russian valuables to Poland.\n\nb) The payment of a considerable war indemnity to Poland, although the payment was not justified by the real state of affairs.\n\nc) The Lithuanian borders were set in such a way as to completely separate Lithuania from Soviet Russia, which makes it much easier for Poland to carry out its aggressive plans against Lithuania.\n\nPilsudski attached great importance to the latter Polish achievement during the peace negotiations with Soviet Russia. During a face-to-face confrontation with me, Pestkowski correctly stated that Pilsudski had actually instructed Koc[xl] to convey his thanks, via Pestkowski, to me and Miller.\n\nAs early as 1918, during Wieniawa-Dlugoszewskis stay in Moscow, we discussed the necessity of me going to work in the Polish Communist Party, for the POWs benefit.\n\nIn 1921, the CC RKP(b) appointed me to work in the CCs Polish Bureau.[xli] There I worked along with the POW member, Makowski, trying to infiltrate the Polish Communist Party. I also took an active part in discussions of the problems and training of cadres in the Polish Communist Party school in Moscow.\n\nBy planting its agents in the Polish Communist Party, the POW sought to take over the CPP leadership, and subordinate it to the pilsudchiks interests in order to destroy the party as a revolutionary force while capitalizing on its influence.\n\n- The POW worked to:\n\na) Paralyze the activities of the CPP as the vanguard of the Polish revolutionary workers movement and thus to hamper or bring to naught the entire mass revolutionary movement in Poland.\n\nb) Use the Polish Communist Party in the interests of pilsudchiks in a future Polish war against the USSR, similar to the way the Polish Communist Party was used by the pilsudchiks during the so-called coup of May 1926.\n\nc) Use the Polish Communist Party and the Polish section of the ECCI as channels for the massive transfer of the POW members and agents of the official institutions of Polish intelligence, disguised as political émigrés, to the USSR to conduct sabotage and intelligence work.\n\nThe end justifies the means:\n\n- Promoting the members of our organization to the leading positions in the CPP by arresting and isolating in prisons the communists who stood in our way; disseminating provocative rumors; direct tampering with facts which raise suspicions of the Defenzivas relations with those communists; hindering the work of the CPP by our organizations members; direct physical elimination of communists who stand in our way; artificially stirring up factional struggles inside the CPP; systematic, persistent and variable inculcation of the pilsudchik-style nationalist ideology in the CPP ranks  these are examples of the successful means used by the members of our organization to achieve their goals in the Polish Communist Party.\n\n- Taking into consideration the fact that the Walecki, Warski and Kostrzewa group, which then (in 1923) had taken over the party leadership, was compromised by open support from Trotsky, I spearheaded a struggle against this group at the 5th Comintern Congress, accusing it of Trotskyism. At the same time, in accordance with the decision of the 5th Congress Polish commission, I was sent to Poland to prepare the next CPP congress.\n\n- In order to enhance my popularity, my arrest in the Dombrowski region in 1925, as well as my subsequent escape from prison, was staged.\n\n- In January 1926  IV CPP party conference[xlii]  the leading group in the CC  Warski, Próchniak and I!\n\nBefore the IV conference  the POW members of Waleckis group  personal friction, disorder.\n\n- IV party conference was attended almost exclusively by Poles [who were] members of different POW groups:\n\na) the Malecki[xliii] group (Lauer,[xliv] Wojtkiewicz,[xlv] Wrublewski,[xlvi] Krajewski, Rylski, Próchniak, Bogucki,[xlvii] Cichowski, Walecki, who headed the group connected to Lapinski).\n\nb) the Zarski(??) group (Klara,[xlviii] Bertynski Albert)\n\nc) the Domski[xlix] group (Osinska,[l] Markowski[li])  Domski was known as a Trotskyist and was expelled from the party.\n\nThe unification of these groups did not occur at the IV conference because of the continuing argument about which group was to head the CPP leadership.\n\nAt the conference, prominent POW members were also present: Leszszynski (my namesake), Aronsztam[lii] and Korczyk.\n\n- The POWs line at the IV conference was defined by a directive from the POW Warsaw center which Zarski received in 1925 from Colonel Koc.\n\n- The direct result and a substantial achievement of our activity in that period was the open support offered by the Polish Communist Party to Pilsudski during the so-called coup of May 1926, when the CPPs press was entirely in the hands of the POW members, who eulogized Pilsudski as a national hero, claimed his action to be revolutionary, and called on workers to support the Pilsudskis action.\n\nThe delegation of the Sejm deputies-communists (Warski, Sochacki(??) and others) had friendly discussions with General Skladkowski[liii] about how to undermine the movement for the [rights of] political prisoners.\n\nOf course, I contributed in every possible way to the implementation of this position with my articles from Danzig as well as by positioning people. In Poland, Rylski and Henrykowski (POW member since 1916) headed the CC Secretariat.\n\n- Wojewódzki[liv] became a [theorist] of peasant question [and was] sent to the CPP by the 2nd Department of the Polish General Staff. On orders from Defenziva, he created the Independent Peasant Party.\n\n- In order to divest ourselves of the responsibility for becoming traitors to working class interests, on the one hand, we promoted the May mistakes theory, and on the other, in order to divert communists from opposing a policy which strengthened the pilsudchiks, on orders from the representative of the POW center, we artificially unleashed fractional struggle in the CPP, by breaking into two groups  the majority and the minority.\n\n[In] 1929, the entire CC leadership joined the former minority group under my leadership.\n\nV CPP congress (Fall 1929)[lv]  renewal of the leadership.\n\nThe congresss decisions devoted little attention to the forms of struggle that could stir the masses, but instead prematurely stressed the forms of struggle that were isolating the party from the masses. Regarding the war  the major emphasis was not on how to prevent it with the help of mass movements, but on the general deliberations about what is to be done in case the war breaks out.\n\n- The CC Military Department, which was under surveillance by both the okhranka[lvi]and the 2nd Department of the Pol[ish] Gen[eral] St[aff], was destroyed by systematic arrests; the POW hampered its work.\n\n- Thanks to we POWists efforts, the experience of the CPP military schools, which existed in 1929-30-31 in the USSR, yielded negative results. Those graduating from these schools were not prepared for the current conditions of struggle in Poland, [and] occupied themselves with somewhat mechanical discussions about how to transfer examples from the underground work to Poland, rather than how to win the army over to the peoples side, thereby losing sight of the urgent tasks of the anti-war struggle. Those coming [to Poland] after graduation were promptly exposed by us, and the energetic anti-war work in the army quickly collapsed thanks to us.\n\n(p[age] 23!)\n\n- In discussions with Koc [about] the question of the POWs tasks in the CPP within Poland itself, we agreed that it is important to continue hindering the mass revolutionary movement in Poland and to prepare political diversion in case of war against the USSR. For example, we discussed how, in case a new Polish war against the USSR breaks out, it would be essential to issue, in the name of the Communist party, an appeal to the Polish working masses calling on them to stand up for the defense of Poland, [and] demonstrating that the Soviet Union is the aggressor.\n\n- [We] also agreed on using Cichowski, Bielewski, Redens[lvii] and Maksymowski.[lviii] We used the first three to plant [them] in the Comintern. Maksymowski was placed on the editorial board of Trybuna Radziecka.\n\nIn 1932  VI CPP congress.\n\n- 90% of the delegates [were] POW members.\n\n- Characteristic of our work at this Congress was not the resolutions, but rather the behind-the-scenes instructions to the POW delegates by me, Bortnowski and Henrykowski.\n\n- In order to infiltrate the CPP, we set for POW members the task of taking military studies courses at the pilsudchik Rifleman,[lix] which they had to join under the pretext of conducting communist work in this organization.\n\nAnother task [was] the complete takeover of the CPPs territorial and regional committees in which POW members already constituted 50% by the time of the 6th congress.\n\n- The previous main task remained in force.\n\n- At the VI congress, four POW members were planted in the Political Bureau:Próchniak, Henrykowski , Korczyk and me. We worked in this capacity for almost 3 years. The secretaries in the country were also the POW members  Nowak(??) (Marek), Starewicz (Edwin)[lx] and Metek.[lxi]\n\n- Metek was killed by the Polish Defenziva.\n\n- Both Nowak and Metek were POW members. While working in the Polish Komsomol, they were constantly at odds with each other. Since Metek continued to attack Nowak, they were both arrested by the Defenziva in the summer of 1933. Of course, Nowak was put in jail and convicted so as to later be sent to the USSR. As for Metek, he vanished without a trace. The Polish police announced the discovery near Warsaw of a corpse which looked like Metek.\n\n- In 1934-35, we established continual cooperation with the POW elements from the PPS and later with the Peasant Party, disguising it as a United Front [Popular] tactics in order to jointly hinder the United Front movement.\n\n- In 1936, we were facing big problems in further planting our cadres. The arrest of Stasiak[lxii] and Kopecki[lxiii] in Kiev prompted the Comintern to concern itself with the CPPs organizational affairs. At the Cominterns insistence, the verification of activists was launched.\n\nI suggested appointing the following individuals, who were the POW members, to the verification commission: Próchniak, Skulski, Bielewski, Bortnowski, Krajewski.\n\nThe commissions composition, as suggested by me, was approved, but I myself was also made a member.\n\n(p[age] 28)\n\n- As a result of this purge, we managed to safeguard our organization from more or less significant failures, however, we had to sacrifice two POW members  Henrykowski and Korczyk.\n\n- Henrykowski was removed from the CC, Korczyk was handed over to the NKVD.\n\nSoon experienced POW members such as Makowski, Landy,[lxiv] Sosnowski[lxv] were arrested.\n\n(The list of the POW members)\n\nSlawinski\n\nAt the V congress, elected as CC members:\n\nLenski, Bronkowski, Slawinski, Rwal, Sochacki, Próchniak, Bur, Henrykowski, Marek-Novak, Tojte (Janiczki),[lxvi] Knorin, Korczyk, Horenko,[lxvii] Zlikh(??)  all without exception are POW members.\n\n-Among the delegates there was Purman, who is not a POW member.\n\nUpon his arrival in Moscow, Lenski, Bronkowski and Próchniak created around Purman such an atmosphere of suspicion regarding Purmans participating in provocations within the party that Purman could not bear this atmosphere and shot himself, although no direct charges were made against him. His suicide was explained as a result of a persecution complex, from which he allegedly suffered.\n\n(Mickiewicz-Kapuskas)[lxviii]\n\n(died)  (POW).\n\nRylski.\n\nI plead guilty to having participated in intelligence activity for the Polish and German intelligence services and, at the same time, being a member of and actively working in the POW and the international Trotskyist-Rightist organization in the Comintern system.\n\nRylskis deposition.\n\n- POWists:\n\n- Wenianski(??) (currently in Poland).\n\n- Trusskier  party alias Fiedler[lxix] (currently in Paris).\n\n- Leia(??) (currently in Poland).\n\nAfter the 4th Conference of the CP Poland in Moscow in December 1925, [he] returned to Poland and joined the regional leadership of:\n\n- Krajewski,(??) Stefanski, Rylski.\n\n- Renewed his ties with Ostrowski[lxx] (the POW leadership).\n\n- Being responsible for organizational questions, on Ostrowskis orders, [he] conducted the line in support of Pilsudski in his struggle for power against the Endeks [NDs].\n\n- During the May 1926 coup, [he] secured the railroad workers neutrality, which proved to be decisive for Pilsudski [since this act] delayed the transfer of the special forces from Poznan province to Warsaw.\n\n- During the coup, [he] established connections, via Ostrowski, with Krashkowski, a representative of Pilsudskis staff.\n\n- At the 4th [party] congress (1927), a factional struggle between the majority and the minority broke out. The POW group, which I had created, consisting of Abe Fluga, Leia and Nowotko Marian,[lxxi] joined the majority at the POWs order. Under my leadership, this group worked on the worker delegates, with whom we had good personal relations.\n\n- Soon after the congress, the elections to the Senate and Sejm began. With my assistance, Ostrowski was made the Chairman of the electoral committee. As a result, we managed to make Sochacki, Zarski, Wojewodzki, Ballin,[lxxii] my brother Felix Liubinetski, Kowalski,[lxxiii] Bitner,[lxxiv] candidates in the elections.\n\n- In May or June 1928, I was arrested in Berlin along with all the CC CPP plenum [delegates] and, after being released (in 10 days), [I] was transferred, with the help from the Cominterns <_> apparatus, to Czechoslovakia and from there to Poland, and I [finally] arrived in Paris.\n\n- [I] immediately contacted Ostrowski.\n\n- At that time, the Party was under the leadership of Zarski, Henrykowski, Novak, Huber,[lxxv] Iuzek(??) and myself.\n\n- The major objectives of the POWs work in the CPP, via the POW connection, were to stimulate the factional struggle between the majority and the minority, to eliminate people unsuitable for the POW, and to contribute to the POW takeover of the party apparatus.\n\n- Under the banner of factional struggle, I managed to dissolve the Warsaw party committee. The naming of the new committee members was done with Ostrowskis sanction. The same was true for the Secretariat of the CC of the Polish Komsomol.\n\n- In October 1928, [I] was recalled from Poland by the Comintern. The VI Comintern Congress Presidium and the Polish Commission criticized my factional activities and transferred me to the Cominterns Polish section, headed by Purman, for disposition. Purman sent me to study at the International Leninist School.\n\n- It is very difficult for me to distinguish between my work for the POW and for the Polish intelligence. It was, in fact, all connected. I used to pass all the secret information I knew to Ostrowski.\n\n- I handed over to Ostrowski information about the composition of the central technical [apparatus] of the Polish CP, which resulted in more than 20 people, for example, Brodowska,[lxxvi] Zamojski,[lxxvii] etc., being arrested in February 1927.\n\n- From 1919 on, I systematically passed on to the intelligence service, via Ostrowski, copies of secret documents from the ECCI and CP Poland, informed [him]about the placement of cadres in the party, about the arriving and departing [party] workers, etc.\n\n- Between October 1928 and February 1929, I studied at the Leninist School.\n\n- In February 1929, I left for China.\n\n- In March 1930, I came to Moscow with a report.\n\n- From Sochacki (CPP representative in the Comintern) and Dabal[lxxviii] I learned that the POW has sufficient information about the Comintern and the CPP affairs.\n\n- In July 1930, [I] returned to China. All my aspirations were directed toward sitting on the fence and returning to Polish work as soon as possible.\n\n- From October 1931 to May 1932, I stayed in the USSR and was used by the ECCI on different assignments.\n\n- In May 1932, I was sent by the ECCI to work in Berlin as the head of the ECCIs OMS center.\n\n- Before leaving for Berlin, I had a conversation with Abramov, in the course of which he recruited me into the anti-Soviet Trotskyist-Rightist organization within the Comintern system, and [also] to work for the German intelligence. He told me to contact the intelligence service representative in Berlin, and at once gave me his address.\n\n- In Berlin in September 1932, through Bertynski (at that time he worked in the CPP Political Bureau apparatus in Berlin), I met with Ostrowski.\n\nHe told me that he had received extensive information for the POW and the Polish Defenziva from Lampe-Novak, Henrykowski, Hertinski, Glesser-Kolecki,[lxxix] and that Lampe and Henrykowski were passing their information to the POW via Zarskis wife, Magda.\n\nOstrowski connected me to a commissar of the Defenziva, Burkhard. He told me that he knew about my collaboration with the German intelligence and that I would have to maintain this connection, but I would have to pass to him copies of the materials that were being sent to the German intelligence. I agreed. Immediately I told Burkhard that, according to Comintern directives, Berlin was being cleared of all the Comintern organizations.\n\n- I maintained this connection with Burkhard until my departure from Berlin for Moscow in December 1933.\n\n- During the time that we maintained connections, I told him about the transfer of the Comintern organizations from Berlin to other countries, about underground Comintern workers passing through Berlin, about the arrival in Berlin of the Poles Guber and Markowski to conduct party work for the CPG. I systematically passed on information about the work of the OMS centers in Prague, Copenhagen, Zurich, etc., and about the composition of the cadres of those centers.\n\nThen, I gave him copies of documents that were arriving at the Berlin OMS center and addressed for other countries and cities. Among them were various ECCI resolutions, decrees, directives and reports.\n\nDuring the meeting, Burkhard told me that Schubert,[lxxx] one of the leaders of the CP Germany, was an agent of the German police and that he participated in betraying Thälmann. He later shared with me that Dimitrov was allegedly betrayed by Popov[lxxxi] (a participant in the Dimitrov trial), who was connected with the Bulgarian police.\n\nBefore my departure for Moscow, Burkhard told me that, on the POWs and the Defenzivas orders, Markowski would partially replace me in Berlin [and] that intelligence was interested in my working in Paris, where Comintern activities were concentrated, or in Moscow in the ECCI apparatus.\n\n- With Ludkiewicz[lxxxii] in Moscow, connection with Burkhard.\n\n- In February 1934, ECCI named me the deputy head of the OMS.\n\n- In order to have access to the ECCI materials that were sent by mail, in March 1934, I recruited Berta Zimmermann,[lxxxiii] who had access to these documents. I systematically received from her copies of these materials typed on rice-paper. Thus I was told about all of the OMS work and systematically passed that information on to Ludkiewicz. In addition to that, I compiled for Ludkiewicz detailed reports about the movements of ECCI and CPP workers. I personally knew which passports and names ECCI workers were using, since I used to sign their visa papers.\n\nI do not remember exactly how many [party workers] I thereby betrayed to the Polish intelligence.\n\n- In May 1936, after being removed from the work in ECCI, I arranged with Lenski to be sent to conduct party work in Poland.\n\n- Upon arrival [there] in June 1936, I met with Ostrowski in the city of Lodz in the apartment of the POW member <_>[lxxxiv] .\n\n- In December 1936, [I went] to work in Warsaw.\n\n- I passed on to him the plan of the 1 May celebration which was worked out by the Political Bureau.\n\n- At [our] last meeting on 9 July 1937, I informed Ostrowski that, on Lenskis orders, I was going to Paris.\n\nSkulski.\n\n- I admit that for the past 17 years, I have indeed been a Polska Organizacja Wojskowa (POW) member and, as such, following the orders and directives of this organizations leaders, have engaged in treason, especially when I was working in the Polish Communist Party, in which I occupied a leadership position the entire time.\n\n- [I was] recruited in 1920 in Belostok by Bobinski.\n\n- He told me that Dzierzynski had received a POWist who deserted to the Soviets, the officer Dobrzynski, and took him to work in the OGPU where he worked under the name of Sosnowski.\n\n- In early May 1921, in Petrograd, Bobinski told me that some POWists had joined the Polish Communist Party in order to achieve a rapprochement with the POW and to subject the Com[munist] party to the Pilsudskis influence.\n\nThe major task of Communists who are the POW members was, said Bobinski, [to render] all possible support to Pilsudski in order to make it possible to prevent the takeover of power by the reactionary bourgeoisie represented by the ND members.\n\nBobinski gave the order to send back to Poland, in the first place, those Polish refugees who were POW members.\n\n- In late 1921, [I] was sent to conduct underground work in Poland.\n\n- I introduced many POWists into the pool of regional and district activists, justifying it as being essential to rejuvenate cadres.\n\n- In addition to planting POW cadres, I and other POWists, following Heltmans directives, viciously sabotaged the United Front tactics. I was not the only one to do this, so too did Próchniak and Heltman[lxxxv] by sending more POWists from Moscow.\n\n- In the months of August and September 1922, the II CPP Congress, in which I participated, took place in Moscow. Radek was the congresss leader on behalf of the Comintern. The latter not only insisted on [using] sharper POW language in the resolution, but, at some sessions, also insisted on making Zarski and Dombal, the well-known old POWists and pilsudchiks, CC members.\n\n- Lenski, Bobinski and Heltman sharply opposed the POW line (as a blind).\n\n- At that time, I learned that Lenski was a POW member, because during the congress he openly discussed it with me.\n\n- S. Osinska-Unszlicht [was]in the party leadership at this time.\n\n- I cannot recall all of [our] treasonous and provocative activities but we did everything to completely subject the CPP to the pilsudchiks influence and to help Pilsudski to overthrow the ND government.\n\nIn late 1930, at Lenskis suggestion and by the decision of the CC of the Polish Com[munist] Party, I was sent to work in the Profintern.\n\n- When at that time I wanted to refuse working on Polish issues, because I did not want to live a double life, Lenski threatened to take measures to expose my POW activity if I did not behave. I had to comply. When I started working in the Profintern, Lenski began demanding from me detailed information about strikes and trade union movement in Poland and other countries, about trade union cadres, and about the movement of these cadres. When I asked him why he needed those materials, he replied that he needed to send these materials to the POW leadership in Poland.\n\n- In 1931, on Lenskis orders, I was again sent to conduct party work in Poland. I resisted, but Lenski openly threatened me and insisted on having it his way.\n\n- He told me to stop putting on airs and to resume POW work. When I told him that I was not going to and, if necessary, would inform the appropriate [organs]about me and him, Lenski listened to me and then said that there was no return.\n\nI still remember his words: What do you think will happen to you? You will vanish in Soviet prison or on Solovki, and not with me, as you want it, but you alone. Who would believe you that Lenski is a POWist? You will vanish due to your stupidity and we will not help you.\n\n- Lenski charged me with one central task: to prevent major strikes and, if there is a large mobilization of the masses, to nip [those strikes] in the bud.\n\n- Other POWists and I managed to break the long-prepared general strike in Poland.\n\n- I achieved this by not permitting enough time [for preparation], counting in advance on the failure of the strikes preparations and on the obstructing of the United Front tactics.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat kind of treason did you commit while holding this position? (as the CPP representative in the ECCI)\n\nSkulski:\n\nPermit me to testify on this next time.\n\nBertynski (Albert).\n\nI was recruited into the POW counterrevolutionary organization in 1926 by the immediate leaders of this organization, Leszszynski, [and] Julian Marianowic, with cooperation of Jan Belenski.\n\n- In the summer of 1926 in Moscow, a session of the ECCIs Polish Commission took place about the question of the CPPs role during the Pilsudskis coup of May in Poland. After one of the sessions, I was invited by Leszszynski-Lenski to Stanislaw Budzynskis[lxxxvi] apartment, where, besides myself and Lenski, Bielewski, Slawinski and Budzynski himself were present. [We] discussed the question of creating a faction of the so-called minority in order to foment a factional struggle to favor the pilsudchiks in the POW groups within the Polish CP, [and] to destroy the revolutionary communist movement in the country.\n\n- The POW organization in the CPP ranks had as its goal undermining and demoralizing the revolutionary movement in Poland, [and] struggling against the Comintern, VKP(b) and the USSR in the interests of Polish fascism and the pilsudchina.\n\n- In the late 1918 or in 1919, through Pilsudskis agent Wentskowski, Warski sent a letter to Lenin and Dzierzynski protesting the red terror.\n\n- In 1920, the POW leadership of the CPP (Warski, Kostrzewa, Gzhekh-Kowalski, Krajewski, Martselli, Binder) admitted [to the party] a whole group of pilsudchiks who had left the PPS. They admitted the leaders of this pilsudchik group, Witkowski -- Sturm de Strem[lxxxvii] and later Zarski, to the CC CPP, and charged Sturm de Strem with heading the Military Department of the CC. During the Red Armys offensive on Warsaw, the POW leadership in the CPP completely disorganized the party, and intentionally failed to provide any directives to the party organizations during this difficult period.\n\n- The CC systematically opposed the directives of the Polish Rev[olutionary] Com[mittee][lxxxviii]headed by Dzierzynski.\n\n- The POWist Domski published an article in the Berlin newspaper Rote Fahne in which he disapproved of the revolution brought in from the outside by bayonets.\n\n- In May 1921, at the CPPs CC session, where a number of [party] workers were present, the POWist Gzhek-Kowalski suggested putting forth a resolution that the Polish delegation to the III Comintern Congress introduce a declaration that the foreign and domestic policy of the Soviet government goes against the interests of the international proletariat. It was decided to make such a declaration, not at the congress session, but at the meeting of the Polish and Soviet delegations.\n\n- In 1921, the POW leadership of the CC CPP (Grzegorzewski, Wintsler, Rylski, Krutkowski,[lxxxix] Krajewski) admitted to the party a group headed by agent provocateur, the POWist Sochacki, who in 1920 was the PPS General Secretary.\n\n-Dombal was also admitted at that time.\n\n- Under the influence of the POW leadership, with whom Radek cooperated, the II congress in 1923 adopted a nationalist platform.\n\n-The POW agents played a crucial role in obstructing the revolutionary struggle in Poland in 1925.\n\n- At the VI congress, the group competing with the POW, which was headed by Lenski, revealed itself and formed a bloc with the counterrevolutionary activities of the POWists Domski, Osinski, Adamski[xc] and Gzhekh-Kowalski.\n\nUnszlicht became the leader of this group.\n\n- In late 1923, the POW group under the leadership of Warski, Kostrzewa and Walecki openly supported Trotsky, thus implementing the POW line of counterposing the CPP and the VKP(b) and of strengthening the elements hostile to the Bolshevik party in the USSR.\n\n-Within the Comintern, the POW group of Warski and Kostrzewa, together with Radek, tried to create a bloc against the VKP(b) by supporting Brandler in Germany and the Right elements in other parties. After the bankruptcy of the Warski-Kostrzewa group, the leadership passed to the other POW group of Domski-Lenski, headed by Unszlicht.\n\n- After the arrest of Lenski in 1924, Domski along with Skulski-Mertens, Purman, Osinski, Grszegorszewski, Krajewski, headed POW work.\n\n- This leadership aimed at organizing an anti-Bolshevik, anti-Comintern bloc [composed] of Left elements [such as] Ruth Fischer-Maslow in Germany and Treint[xci] in France, which later became the base for the Zinovievite-Trotskyist counterrevolutionary organization.\n\n- In <_> half of 1925, the POW leadership of the CPP openly raised the banner of struggle against the Comintern by adopting a resolution in defense of Ruth Fischer.\n\n- As a result of it  removal of Domski and Osinska.\n\n- The Warski leadership was supported by attracting Bielewski and Lenski. Support of Pilsudski.\n\n- I know that shortly before the May 1925 coup, Walecki sent a letter to the CC CPP in which he strongly insisted on starting negotiations with Pilsudski about support for his actions.\n\n- At the time of the coup, the POW leadership of the CPP issued a manifesto calling on the working masses to support Pilsudskis revolutionary troops, to go part of the way with Pilsudski, since the CPPs goals went further than, but did not contradict the goals of the pilsudchiks. Warski(?),[xcii] Krajewski, Stefanski[xciii] and Henrykowski authored this leaflet.\n\n- After the May coup, both groups (Kostrzewas and Lenskis) unleashed, in the interests of pilsudchiks, a bitter factional struggle that lasted for three years and that led to the complete disorganization of the party and the paralysis of all its practical work.\n\n- The POW group of Kostrzewa, in the period before and after the VI Comintern Congress, was closely linked with Bukharin; the POW group of Lenski with Lominadze. The connection of the Lenski group with Knorin occurred in the period after the VI Comintern Congress (pp. 15-16-17-18).\n\n- In its counterrevolutionary activity, the POW group headed by Lenski was connected in the Comintern with the group of Knorin and Piatnitsky, namely: with Grunberg, Grigory[xciv] and Lev Smoliansky,[xcv] and Vasiliev.[xcvi] During the last period of factional struggle in the CPP, Knorin was the ECCI representative in the CC CPP, supported the Lenski group, and was in close contact with Lenski himself.\n\n- At the 1932 ECCI plenum, Lenski, together with Knorin and Pyatnitsky, pushed through a thesis that the Bruning government[xcvii] in Germany was already a fascist one, and that it made no sense to speak about the fascist danger in Germany any more. The major attack [should be launched] against Social Democracy and Bruning, not against the National Socialists. All of Lenskis POW group, including me, shared the position of Lenski-Knorin-Piatnitsky.\n\n- As the CPP representatives, Bortnowski and I supported Knorin and Pyatnitsky in the Comintern, in particular their struggle against the implementation of the United Front tactics.\n\nAbroad, the Lenski group used its connections in other com[munist] parties to promote the views of Knorin-Pyatnitsky. It was primarily Henrykowski who maintained these connections. I know of his close connections in the CP Czechoslovakia with Rudolf Slansky, [xcviii] Sverma[xcix] and Svabova.[c] I frequently had conversations with Bela Kun in the spirit of Knorin's [and]Pyatnitsky's ideas.\n\n- The candidacy of Sochacki to the CPP Political Bureau was suggested by K. N. Popov[ci] in 1929.\n\n- From 1933, the leadership in Poland [consisted of] POW [elements].  (pp. 20-21!).\n\n- Leninist School (p. 23).\n\n- Lately we have been following the line of Knorin-Pyatnitsky regarding Comintern issues in the school.\n\nWork in the army (p. 24).\n\n- In the newspaper The Soldier of the Revolution (editorial board  Bortnowski, Zbikowski, Rwal and I), [we] published a pro-POW article by Zbikowski[cii] entitled The Defense of the USSR. In accordance with the POW directives, Zbikowski tried to prove that an offensive war on the part of the USSR was the only possible way to defend the USSR. The publication of such an article in the CPP newspaper actually served the interests of the anti-Soviet campaign [waged] by the Polish and international bourgeoisie, since it provided it with the argument about the USSRs aggressive plans. For a long time, the fascist press capitalized on this article, stressing simultaneously that its authors were Bortnowski and Zbikowski, [who were presented as] distinguished Soviet military workers.\n\nBertynski\n\n- Counterrevolutionary activity of the Kostrzewa POW group in Poland was manifested in the demoralizing work within the party conducted in the interests of fascism.\n\nHenrykowski\n\n(Saul Samoilovich Amsterdam)\n\n- [I] joined the POW in late 1923.\n\nI received my first assignment to conduct POW work in early 1924, after the POW leadership of the CPP, Kruglikowski, Wrublewski, Henryk Lauer, Danieluk-Stefanski, Warski, Kostrzewa, etc., went bankrupt.\n\nThe nationalist pilsudchik policy of this leadership led to an open reaction by the partys lower echelons, and entire organizations adopted resolutions protesting the current CPP leadership.\n\n- Following the POW leaderships directive, the oppositional movement was headed by POW member Lenski-Leszszynski and his group, Osinska, Domski and Adamski.Pekarski (the POW leader) suggested to me that I join this movement against the Warski group, which I did.\n\nIn late 1926, Pekarski told me that I should contact Freilich. He [also] told me that in the CPP the active POW members were Kruglikowski, Danieluk-Stefanski, Henryk Lauer, Wrublewski, Klonowicz-Wygodski,[ciii] whom I had to support and cooperate with to help the pilsudchik coup. Moreover, I had to conduct the work in such a way that nobody would know about my affiliation with the POW.\n\n- Later Freilich revealed that Warski, Kostrzewa, Landy-Witkowski, Grszegorszewski, Cichowski, Rylski, Dutlinger,[civ] Marianski,[cv] Wojewódzki were also POW members, and suggested that I support them.\n\n- As a result of our pro-POW activities, by the May coup, the CC CPP had already turned into an open agency of Pilsudski, and the CPP  into an appendage of his camp.\n\n- At the time of the coup, we fulfilled all the assignments given us by Major Koshkowski and Colonel Slawski. The very same policy that we conducted in Warsaw was conducted by the POWists Lenski-Leszszynski, Wrublewski, Ryng, Próchniak in the Polit[ical] Bureau, and by the POW members Landy-Witkowski, Henryk Lauer, Kostrzewa, etc. in Moscow.\n\nWe did not permit the holding of a demonstration by the CPP party organizations, but took part in the demonstration, along with the PPS, to celebrate the Pilsudskis victory. The CPP party fraction headed by Warski made a decision to vote in the Sejm for the Pilsudskis candidacy for Chairman.\n\n-Following Freilichs directives, Lenski, Bielewski, Pashin and I created the so-called minority faction in the CPP, which was joined by the POW member Zarski, the Defenziva agent Marek-Lampe, Fiedler, Neroki-Zaks,[cvi] Tomorowicz Andrei,[cvii] Karbowski, Marabut,[cviii] Bertynski-Albert, Rwal-Reicher, Elena Jezierska,[cix] Skulski and Grszegorszewski.\n\n- The policy that we conducted in the CPP between 1930 and the VII Comintern Congress in 1935 was based on the following anti-Marxist and anti-Leninist concepts.\n\n1) The struggle for democratic rights in Poland and other fascist countries is impossible under fascism, since fascism can only be overthrown by a socialist revolution;\n\n2) Under the fascist regime, communist parties should not make partial democratic demands regarding general political questions (electoral rights, establishment of the parliaments legislative authority, and municipal councils), [and] nationality and peasant questions;\n\n3) The Com[munist] Partys leading organs should never present United Front demands to the leading socialist organs because the United Front can only be formed from below.\n\nWith these we aimed to undermine the working class United Front which the Comintern pursued.\n\nThe results were as follows:\n\na) mass political struggle was reduced to a minimum. Instead of that struggle, an abstract propaganda about the goals of the revolutionary movement was conducted with no connection to the current political issues of the day;\n\nb) denying partial demands on the nationality question led to abstract propaganda of the nations right to self-determination;\n\nc) not putting forward partial demands on the peasant question (reducing taxes, annulling debts, reducing interest on debts, specific demands regarding cooperation, etc.). Instead of these demands, we favored adventurist Trotskyist forms of struggle that did not correspond to the situation, namely, boycott of debts, boycott of cooperation, seizing the landlords grain by the Polish peasants, etc.\n\nThus, we contributed to the alienation of the CPP from workers and the popular masses, and from the mass trade union and other organizations.\n\n- In 1928, I received an order from Freilich through the CPP to transfer to the USSR POW members disguised as political émigrés, to conduct espionage and subversive activities.\n\nThe task of the POW members transferred by me to the USSR was toorganize act of sabotage in enterprises, to create groups to conduct acts of sabotage at the outset of war between Poland and the USSR, to collect intelligence materials on military and economic affairs, to conduct pilsudchik propaganda among the Polish population.\n\nStolarski.[cx]\n\n(Head of the Sov[iet] bureau of the Sailors International)\n\nBy decision of the Special Council of the NKVD of 20 May 1937, sentenced to 5 years of ITL[cxi] for espionage activities.\n\n- Recruited in late 1921.\n\n- Used the CPP treasury to promote the POW purposes.\n\n- In some cases, arrests would strengthen the position of the POW member in the Com[munist] Party, in other [cases], [arrests would] eliminate any suspicions, especially when the arrest was followed by the destruction of the whole organization. Finally, arrests were used as steps for further transfers to the USSR.\n\n[In] 1928  editor of the PPS-Lewica organ in Krakow.\n\n- In 1929, attended a meeting in Berlin, Knorin was also there.\n\n- Besides Wzhos directive that I was to be Purmans POW subordinant and that I had to make contact with him in Moscow, I also received a letter from POW member Roma[na] Juchniewicz[cxii] to Tosia Feder[cxiii] who worked in the Comintern.\n\n- After Purman, Gzhegozhewski became my boss (when [I] started working in the Profintern).\n\n- Gzhegozhewski was particularly occupied with Romanian and Yugoslavian affairs and ordered me to write a brief memorandum, in particular regarding the contradictions and struggle between the Right and Left wings in the Romanian and Yugoslavian trade union movement and in the Communist parties of these countries.\n\n- Gzhegozhewski told [me] that it was necessary to intensify the struggle within the revolutionary trade union movement in Romania.\n\n- After the V congress, Skulski and Kostanian[cxiv] (he had an agreement with Lenski) came to work in the Profintern.\n\n- The POWists in the Profintern took the side of Kostanian against Lozovsky.[cxv]\n\n- A few, including myself, formally remained Lozovskys supporters.\n\n- Sochacki, Gzhegozhewski and Skulski told me that in order to conduct my work abroad ([in the] Sailors International) I had to contact Purman who was working at that time in the Profinterns European Secretariat in Berlin, and [also contact] Lenski.\n\n- Upon arriving in Berlin in April 1931, I got in touch with Purman and, through him, with Lenski.\n\n- Purman told me that my task [as a] POW member would be primarily to conduct espionage so as to collect information about the building of both merchant and military vessels in different countries.\n\n- Also [to] meet with Próchniak.\n\n(p. 9  The Sailors Clubs International).\n\n- Some 4-5 months after my arrival in Hamburg, I was able to pass on to Purman for Lenski and thus to the Polish General Staff the first piece of information that was required of me.\n\n- July 1932  The I World Sailors Congress [took place] in Hamburg.\n\n- From the Profintern, Skulski was present, from the Profinterns European Secretariat  Purman, Smolianski (a Trotskyist), who had contacts with Purman, and Heckert!\n\n- Some time in July or August 1934, I had a meeting in Copenhagen with Lenski, and he instructed me to have my agents not only in the ports of France and England, but above all, in the ports of the USSR.\n\n- In January 1936, [I] returned to Moscow.\n\n- Head of the Sov[iet] Bureau of Sailors.\n\n[I] received an order from Skulski: to get additional information about the USSRs Navy and, in particular, about newly-built [ships]; to send my people, preferably POW members, to the Inter[national] clubs, first of all, in Arkhangelsk and Odessa.\n\n- On 25 July 1936, I was arrested.\n\nMiller Willi  a German sailor, member of the board of the Red Union of Sailors  recruited in 1934.\n\nZiebert Willi  a German sailor  Hamburg  recruited in 1935.\n\nBronkowski  1 July 1937.\n\nFrom 1917 until [his] arrest in 1937, an active POW member; he engaged in espionage and provocative activities.\n\n- In order to improve working conditions for the POW, Iuzowski ([he] had met with the pilsudchiks in Saratov) recommended that I, as an SDPKPiL member (since 1912), join the Saratov organization of the RSDRP(b), which I did in early April 1917 (after the February revolution).\n\n- Our POW organization considered the work of the Bolshevik organizations as destructive and ruinous work that, in our opinion, was leading to the weakening of our principal enemy  Russia.\n\nI was the Bolshevik organizations [delegate] delegate to the local Soviet of Workers and Soldiers deputies.\n\n- I left for Petrograd in early December 1917.\n\n- Iuzowski ordered me to meet with Puzak and Zarski.\n\nI got in touch with the SDPKPiL members, whom I had known before -- Lenski, Unszlicht and Dolecki -- and, at Unszlichts suggestion, started, working temporarily on the editorial board of the SDPKPiL newspaper in Russia.\n\n- Soon, on the Lenskis suggestion, I became a Secretary of the Narkomnatzs[cxvi] Commissariat for Polish affairs.\n\n- In the Spring of 1919, on Puzaks advice, I started working in the VChK[cxvii] as an investigator in the Department for the struggle against counterrevolution, sabotage and speculation.\n\n- I took part in releasing Pilsudskis personal adjutant Wieniawa-Dlugoszowski, because I was the investigator and presented the case as necessary to Skrypnik,[cxviii] who at that time was the head of the VChK Department for the struggle against counterrevolution.\n\nIn August 1918, [I] was injured in Petrograd -- [I] was sick and underwent treatment for a year.\n\n- In Spring 1920 -- [I was] in the recon[naissance] group on the Western Front, at Unszlichts invitation.\n\n- As a head of the Western Fronts recon[naissance] group, [I was] connected with the official representative of the Polish General Staff, Captain Swiontkowski.\n\nHe gave me task[s], on behalf of the Polish General Staffs 2nd Department:\n\n1. To pass on to him intelligence information that I received from headquarters on the Western Front;\n\n2. To inform him about agents sent by the recon[naissance] group to Poland;\n\n3. To coordinate with him the deployment of agents and the partisan network.\n\nWalecki  August 1937\n\n- For almost 18 years, I conducted espionage activities for the II Department of the Polish General Staff, for whom I have been an agent since 1919.
