        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in Western countries, accounting for approximately 70% of all lymphoid leukemias. According to the latest data in the United States, the age-adjusted incidence is 4.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. Incidence increases with age to 12.8 per 100,000 in those who are 65 years and older. The mean age of CLL diagnosis is 72 years, and is 1.5–2 times more common in men than women [1]. CLL is characterized by the gradual accumulation of mature B cells expressing B-lineage-specific markers (CD19, CD20, CD23, and CD5 antigen) in lymphoid tissues, bone marrow, and peripheral blood (PB). The clonal B cells generated in CLL might be acquired at the hematopoietic stem cell stage. The leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations increasing the resistance of B cells against apoptosis. A number of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities are observed in CLL patients such as deletions of chromosomes 13, 11, 17, and trisomy 12; numerous somatic and gene copy number mutations, mainly NOTCH1, POT1, PTPN11, TP53, ATM and also numerous epigenetic abnormalities related to micro-RNA regulation (reviewed in [1]).\n\nAlthough CLL is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease, both innate and adaptive dysfunction of the immune system increases the incidence of secondary malignancies and infections observed in patients. Defective neutrophil and NK cell function and decreased complement activity are characteristic of the disturbances in the innate immune system, whereas changes in adaptive immune response include cellular immunodeficiencies with hypogammaglobulinemia, decreased T cell function, and defects in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Additionally, CLL cells modulate the phenotype and function of the immune system through a range of surface molecules and soluble factors [2]. Various studies indicate increased expression of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) molecule in the T and B cell compartment in CLL patients [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Our previous paper showed abnormal expression of another immune checkpoint molecule, B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) in CLL patients.\n\nBTLA is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily providing inhibitory signaling via the T cell receptor (TCR) or the B cell receptor (BCR), which in contrast to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and CTLA-4, binds to the member of TNF receptor superfamily namely to the herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) [10,11,12]. As demonstrated in in vitro studies, BTLA has a direct negative activity on T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Moreover, BTLA is an inhibitory co-receptor of the BCR signaling pathway that, upon ligation with HVEM, attenuates B cell activation by targeting the downstream signaling molecules Syk and B cell linker protein [13]. BTLA inhibits CpG-mediated B cell functions (proliferation, cytokine production, and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules) [14]. BTLA plays an important role in the maintenance of T cell tolerance, as disturbances of the BTLA-HVEM pathway have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of neoplastic disorders [15], infections [16] and autoimmune diseases [17]. Our recent study showed that in contrast to other types of cancer, BTLA protein level is significantly decreased in CLL B cells compared to normal lymphocytes, despite high expression of BTLA mRNA in CLL [18]. This observation points towards altered post-transcriptional regulation of BTLA in CLL cells. Therefore, we postulate that BTLA expression is regulated by microRNAs.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRs) are a group of 19–23 nt long endogenously encoded RNAs which regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by complementary base-pairing with the target mRNA causing blockade of translation [19]. A single miR can regulate multiple target genes, and a single mRNA can be a target for multiple miRs. Over 30% to 90% of human genes are regulated by miRs [20]. Abnormal miR expression pattern has been linked to a broad range of human diseases including autoimmune diseases and various types of cancers. miRs can be involved in either carcinogenesis (oncomiRNA) and tumor suppression (anti-oncomiRNA) [21]. Different types of cancers can be characterized by their unique miR expression profile; this is especially true for CLL, since CLL cells can be easily distinguished from normal B cells based on miR profiling, making miR profiling a potential tool in the diagnosis of CLL [22,23]. The most extensively described miR in the context of CLL is the miR-15a/16-1cluster in the 13q14.3 region, which is commonly deleted in CLL (reviewed in [24]). However, many other miRs like miR-29, miR-181, miR-34a/34b/34c and miR-155 are associated with CLL risk and prognosis. Furthermore, genetic variations and epigenetic regulation of miRs are also associated with CLL pathogenesis [24]. Recently miRs are also considered as a potential target for CLL treatment (reviewed in [24,25]).\n\nOn the basis of a literature review and bioinformatic analysis we anticipate that miR-155-5p, which is highly upregulated in CLL [26] might be the factor regulating BTLA protein expression. This miR has been shown to be associated with BCR signaling disturbances in B cell neoplasms [24]. Moreover, BTLA gene was indicated as an miR-155-5p target [27] and on the mouse model it was shown that miR-155-5p regulates BTLA expression during CD4+ T cells activation [28].\n\nThe aim of this study is to verify our hypothesis about negative regulation of BTLA expression in B cells through epigenetic modulation by miR-155-5p. In addition, our goal is to evaluate the significance of BTLA deficiency in CLL B cells on proliferation capacity measured by Ki67 expression and IL-4 production, since IL-4 plays an essential role in the activation of mature B cells as well as providing survival signals and inhibiting apoptosis of splenic B lymphocytes [29].\n\n4. Discussion\n\nCLL is typically characterized by significant perturbations of the immune system, involving both innate and adaptive immune responses leading to immune suppression from an early stage. Dysfunction of the immune system in turn increases the incidence of secondary malignancies and infections, which represent the major cause of morbidity and mortality for CLL patients [2]. Growing evidence indicates that CLL cells modulate phenotype and functions of immune cells from the innate and adaptive immune system through a number of surface molecules and soluble factors. There has been a rising appreciation of the importance of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory regulation pathways. Recently, we and others focused attention on the potential role of BTLA/HVEM pathway in CLL [15,18,31,32,33]. Our recent results showed an abnormal expression of BTLA in CLL patients [18]. We observed an elevated level of BTLA gene transcripts in peripheral blood B cells in CLL patients, which is in line with a recent study [33], despite showing, lower BTLA protein expression levels on PBMC B cells in CLL patients compared to PBMC B cells in controls [18]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying an association of up-regulated BTLA gene induction with the decrease of BTLA protein expression observed by us in CLL [18] in terms of the epigenetic regulation of BTLA expression.\n\nIn mammalian genes the 3′UTR region contains highly conserved regions which are important for the regulation of transcriptional efficiency, polyadenylation and stability of the mRNA [34]. These functions are mediated by binding to mRNA interacting factors such as miRs [35]. Deregulation of miRs has been shown to affect the hallmarks of cancer, including sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, activating invasion and metastasis and inducing angiogenesis [36]. It is especially true in CLL for which the earliest evidence of miR involvement in human cancer was provided by Dr Croce’s group from studies attempting to identify tumor suppressors at chromosome 13q14 region frequently deleted in CLL. The authors found that this region contains two miR genes, miR-15a and miR-16-1 [37], that both act as tumor suppressors to induce apoptosis by repressing Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein overexpressed in malignant non-dividing B cells and many solid malignancies [38]. To date, several associations were described between certain miRs and cytogenic aberrations commonly found in CLL, as well as other prognostic factors [26].\n\nMiR-155 is a well-known oncogenic miR that is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in many types of cancers [39], especially in numerous B-cell lymphomas [40,41] including CLL [37,42,43] suggesting that miR-155 contributes to lymphoma development [44]. This miR encoded within a region known as the B-cell integration cluster (BIC, miR155HG) is a critical regulator of posttranscriptional gene expression in B cells [45] Moreover, its overexpression is independently associated with poor prognosis. Relatively high-level expression of miR-155 in CLL has been also associated with expression of adverse prognostic markers, such as the ζ-chain associated protein of 70 kD (ZAP-70), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHV), and/or deletions in 17p or 11q [26]. Evidence from animal models indicate that overexpression of miR-155 in transgenic mice induces polyclonal B-cell expansion, suggesting that miR-155 could enhance B-cell proliferation [46]. In line with this observation, it was shown that miR-155 in hematopoietic cells directly targeted Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1). SHIP1 is a phosphatase that acts in opposition to kinases, that are integral to many signal transduction pathways. This inhibitory phosphatase suppresses surface immunoglobulin and BCR signaling. In mice, specific knockdown of SHIP1 in the hematopoietic system following retroviral delivery of a miR-155-formatted siRNA against SHIP1 resulted in a myeloproliferative disorder [47].\n\nTranscriptome-wide miR-155 binding map studies revealed that BTLA mRNA is one of the targets of miR-155 in mouse T cells [27]. A subsequent study of another group on T cells brought evidence that miR-155 may be involved in the inhibition of BTLA expression. Liu et al. showed that BTLA mRNA might be a target of miR-155 during naïve CD4+ T cell activation in mice [28]. Both studies were performed on the T cell mouse model and to the best of our knowledge, there is no study confirming such interaction in a human model. Therefore, we decided to investigate BTLA/miR-155-5p interaction in human peripheral blood CD19+ cells of CLL patients. Our in silico analysis revealed that sequence of human BTLA gene contains MRE (miR recognition element) within its 3′UTR region. We predicted that in humans miR-155-5p interacts with BTLA sequence through 7mer-A1 canonical motif when in mice it has been shown that miR-155-5p binds to BTLA through 7mer-m8 canonical motif [28]. This difference may be due to the low degree of sequence homology of the BTLA gene between humans and mice. Therefore, confirmation of BTLA/miR-155-5p interaction in humans was needed.\n\nSince, as mentioned above literature data showed overexpression of miR-155-5p in CLL and its important role in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, we selected miR-155-5p as potential negative modulator of BTLA expression. In our study we confirmed previously published results (reviewed in [26]) that miR-155-5p is overexpressed in CLL patients as compared to controls. Moreover, we also confirmed our and others results [18,33] on another cohort of patients and controls that BTLA mRNA expression is significantly higher in CLL patients than in controls. With use of inhibitory siRNA targeting miR-155-5p we showed that decreasing of miR-155-5p level in CLL patients partially restored the BTLA surface protein level on B cells. Although the observed shift was slight, it was statistically significant and was present in almost all patients. A possible reason for this small observed changed is that lymphocytes are known to be hard to transfect. Although the transfection efficacy was low, we were able to observe significant changes in miR 155-5p expression and slight yet significant changes in the BTLA protein level on B cells. Another explanation might be that as many different miRs are upregulated in CLL cells, they can also be responsible for abnormal BTLA expression and in consequence could partially mask the effect of miR-155-5p inhibition. Until now only miR-32 has been described to regulate BTLA expression [48], thus, we cannot exclude the influence of other miRs on BTLA expression in CLL cells. Silencing of miR-155-5p did not have significant influence on BTLA expression in the case of HC B cells. This lack of significance might be the result of the much lower miR-155-5p and BTLA mRNA expression in healthy individuals, therefore miR-155-5p inhibition had no such effect on BTLA protein expression as seen in CLL cells.\n\nAdditionally, studies on MEC-1 cell line derived from B-chronic lymphocytic leu-kemia [49] confirmed the results obtained in CLL patients. Similar to CLL cells, MEC-1 cells are characterized by upregulated expression of BTLA mRNA and miR-155-p.\n\nIn MEC-1 cells the effect of miR-155-5p inhibition on BTLA protein level was even stronger than median increase in CLL patients what can be the effect of slightly higher MEC-1 cells transfection efficacy. Altogether our results suggest that miR-155-5p is responsible for epigenetic regulation of BTLA expression in human B cells. However, additional studies are necessary to confirm BTLA-miR-155-5p interaction in humans. Furthermore, subsequent studies should also be performed on other subpopulations of immune cells.\n\nIn the current study, we also extended our preliminary data suggesting that decreased levels of BTLA protein expression in B cells of CLL patients might contribute to lowering the threshold for B cell activation and proliferation. To verify the above suggestion, we conducted a study to evaluate the ability of CLL B cells to proliferate and secrete IL-4 in response to polyclonal stimulation depending on BTLA expression. We found that secretion of IL-4, a growth and survival factor for CLL cells, appears to not be dependent on BTLA expression level, as fractions of IL-4 producing BTLA positive and BTLA negative B cells were found to be similar in all individuals studied. This is in line with previous findings that CLL B cells produce comparable amounts of IL-4 like healthy B cells and that the main source of IL-4 in CLL appears to be the T-cell population rather than B cells [50,51]. However, given the observation that CLL is a B-cell malignancy, the autocrine secretion of IL-4 might contribute to CLL pathogenesis as well.\n\nRemarkably, our study also showed that proliferative rate of in vitro stimulated B cells expressing BTLA is increased and associated with impairment of BTLA protein level, thus strengthening the role of BTLA molecule as an attenuator of B cell activation and proliferation. After PMA stimulation, in CLL BTLA negative Ki67 expressing B cell subset was found to be expanded with the same level as BTLA positive proliferating (Ki67+) B cells subset, whereas in healthy controls the fraction of BTLA+Ki67+ B cell was lower. Furthermore, a proportion of BTLA+Ki67+ B cells in CLL patients was also seen higher confronting the corresponding healthy cells. One should note that our study was performed on the pooled CD19+ cells, including CLL cells as well, thus indicating that defect in BTLA protein expression resulting in dysfunctional state of B cells may be involved in pathogenesis of CLL. Although CLL B cells were historically considered to be resting and long-lived lymphocytes, increasing evidence indicates a much more active rate of cell birth and increase in proliferative capacity also in the periphery [52], an observation consistent with our present results."
