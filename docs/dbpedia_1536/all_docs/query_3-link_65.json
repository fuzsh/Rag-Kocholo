Despite the fact that the Communist Party of Poland has existed during the past 15 years, no one has as yet writ- ten its history. Even the communists themselves have not achieved this aim, so I have permitted myself to call this sketch or histori- cal 'contribution the History of the Communist Party of Poland. A series of reasons, frequently of'w technical nature, have influenced certain insufficiencies and the small gaps which arose in connection with the research on this subject. The latter pertains to a conspiratorial movement with headquarters outside the borders of Poland. In my book I have attempted to present the reader with a picture of the events and documents about the communist movement in Poland from such a point of view so ad to become understandable to all. Considerable difficulty arose here in connection with the fact that I had at my disposal mainly notes And the.memoires written by one of the political prisoners, who at one time had been t prominent communist activist, as well, as materials reporting upon congresses, conferences, etc.. The EPP has never issued even a superficial or.ob- jective outline of its activities. This can be explained in the first place by the absolute lack of' any tradition of its own in this movement, by the absence of auto- nosy not only in an organisational sense but also from the political and ideological points of view. The Communist Party of Poland always represented merely a reflection of the Communist International or STAT Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 4?1. ? - rather of the Ali-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks. Finally, re- search into the activities of their party is not at all a pleasant 'matter for the communists, because these activities come down to a lonuseries of defeats which were varied by frequently dirty 111 methods?internal fights and quarrels. This pertains to .all parties in the Comintern, apart from the Russian ones, but to the Communist Party of Poland in an extraordinary degree. It is also necessaiy.to admit that this is an exceptionally unpleasant history; the history of a movement which in Germany for instance during a number of years represented for some people' an in- carnation of all their,ideale but for others was.a horrible danger; a movement which fought bloody battles-over Saxony, Hungary, Bavaria, Italy, Bulgaria, Estonia; a movement, which spilled rivers of blood or else drowned in them itself and which produced .a very interesting \"scientific\" as well as political and belles lettres literature; a movement which in Poland in the meantime was unable to accomplish anything. The entire \"combat and heroic\" activity of the Communist Party of Poland is reduced to a few thoughtless acts of terrorism, several attempts to create disturbances, a few espionage cases etc. The con- tribution by the 1[PP to the literary and scientific world of inter- national communism was very insignificant. Let us also add the fact that there was completely no contact between the 1CPP and the core of Polish society, and this adds a peculiar coloration to the his- ? tory of this party. I know very well that a considerable part of the affairs deal- lug with the \"great individuals\" in the KOP, described by me, will represent interesting material not only for the average citizen of. 2 - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 the Polish Republic but will also be of interest to many members of the Communist Party of Poland and mainly those from among the working class who are not initiated into various party secrets. A knowledge of these not too glorious EPP activities is, re- gardless of the foregoing, indispensable for each citizen who has an interest in politics. \"Polish Communism\" is nothing. /t originated far beyond our borders and is maintained from there by means of an artificial existence. However it continues to lurk, together with international communism and its headquarters in the USSR, and lie in wait for each manifestation of weakness on the pnrt of our state organism. Above all this, is a movement with considerable potential capabilities of extending itself,on our soil. These possibilities are due to the various economic and social difficulties, to the backwardness, and finally to the existence of a percentage of our population which has a very weak bond with our concept of the state and with European culture in general. I am dedicating this work for the most part to those workers, peasants, or members of the intelligentsia who \"are\" communists or who consider themselves as such and serve the aims of the EPP but who essentially do not have an appropriate cenception about the latter and derive their entire knowledge of communism from Eolored reports issued by the USSR and similar sources. jam recommending my. book 6 with special emphasis to all kinds of activists in the leftist camps who nevertheless take their stand on the basis of an independent Polish state, those calps which have commenced thinking about cOopers- tiOn with the \"Polish\" agents of the Mob [Wssochzwiaskowa Komunistyczna -Partin bolszewikow Communist Party Of Bolsheviksl due to the crisis which they are currently undergoing.

However this does not mean that it originated on-16 De- cember 1918 out of thin air and that it did not have any famous or infamous predecissors. Prom its historical Past the party has re-. tained only those elements which are currently necessary for utili- tarian reasons and primarily for the purpose of justifying the raison d'etat for the contemporary leadership as well as those elements which permit in one way or another of.being.adapted by the pure ideol- ogy of Leninist-Stalinist bolshevism. In order to become acquainted,moro,closely,withlthenCommunist Party of Poland it i. unnecessary therefore to probe deeply intojihe history of the movement from which it grew up.!It.is sufficient to glance at the history of Polish Socialism superficially and at-cer- ? -pa , tai parts of the history of world communism. This will explain' t.o us that Polish communism was not free of misunderstandings at the very beginning of its existence. On the other hand it will estab- lish an interesting thesis that the contemporary movement of Polish communism represents in reality a colony of Russian Bolshevism: The development of Polish socialism proceeded along different lines than that in western Europe. This difference resulted from the special political conditions in the country which was deprived of its own statehood, further from the differing economic and social structure of Poland, and finally from the special historical tra- ditions. Our working class movement in the first place stood face to face not against a \"claei enemy' but versus an alien ruler in Poland. who was also exploiting that movement from.the materialistic - 4 - , Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 0 ii point of view. We should add here that Russian tsarism reacted with special brutality and lack of understanding toward any and all de- sands by the workers. For this reason the main problems occupying - the world of labor in Poland during those times up until 1918-were related not to the class struggle but to the endeavor for national liberation, the struggle of the nation against the 3 occupants and in the first place against the most brutal among them, i.e.* the oc-. cupant from Moscow. This may sound-somewhat peculiar to Marxists at the present time, but several 'Vents in the period prior to 1918 indicate that the concept of freedom Was stronger among the Polish workers than class postulates. A claseic example of how appropriately political freedom was evaluated may be found in the policy of the Bolsheviks, those most consistent among all Marxists (who brought consistency ad absurdum), in the colonial countries and other areas occupied by the imperialist powers. There the struggle for national liberation is officially recognized as the principal goal by the communist doctrine, after the acquisition of which there will take place a reorganization of social relations. Such a policy was con- ducted byltalin in China during the years 1925-27. Polish Marxists up to the tiseAhat thsPolish'Socialist Party originated (1892) did not notice this obvious fact or even when seeing it did not understand its significance. We should re- fleet upon the large amount of popularity enjoyed' by Mira and by Marxism in Poland which existed merely because Marx as well as- - Engels were enemies of tsarism, at the time the main reactionary force in Europe, and for this reason were strong supporters of Poland's independence from under the Russian yoke. ? The basis%for a phenomenon of this type lay in the quite slow narlaccifipn in Part - Sanitized COPY Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 _ Declassified in Part - Sanitized CO .y Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 formation.of theI)olish nation as a Unit cognizant of=itself..Pres- sure and exploitation at that time fell, primarily upon the physically laboring proletariat which represented a tremendous factor of opposi- tion and,struggle against the occupant of \"Priwislinja.\". Besides the ?proletariat, the nobility, was also very active in the role of the intelligentsia or semi-intelligentsia,, breathing, with.a.great hatred toward the oppressors. The milieu of the intellectuals and the,no- bility showed at the time.a large degree of sympathy for the segments of common people, because the former were certain that the old Poland had .fallen as a result=of the degradation suffered by these segments.. The old '!democracy of the nobility\" lad already made the demand for the liberation and raising,up of the peasant. Later it was Josef Pilsudski and his collaborators, after becoming acquainteciwith _western socialism, who recognized that the factory woiker.:Was cecupYing.the vanguard of the people's masses as their most active part. This con- cept became the foundation stone of the Polish Socialist Party which arose in 1892. Marxism came to Poland from Germany, Prance,, Switzerland, and it was there that its peculiar anti Polish coloration originated which in turn was. cultivated by ascertain splinter of Polish and Jewish students who were studying at Russian universities during that time. Due to the horrible Russian oppression of tsarism, even the most radical events and theories had their followers. It is true that a large number among the Polish youth who accepted the beliefs of Marxism did so consciously or subconsciously with the idea that under the pressure of Socialism the tsarist system would collapse and with its fall would come freedamlbr Poland. Everything which led to this hoped for Polish freedom represented for this homeless-- in the meaning given this word by Zeromski youth and intelligentsia - 6 - _ Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release2013/02/28 : CIA-RDP81-ninnnl RrIrl nn(-e) A Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 4?11. something good and just:Many memoirs 'and dOCuments from 'that period prove this' contention beyond any 'doubt. ? Polish Socialism at the end of the nineteenth century was on the best road for transforming itself into a patriotic and social movement recognizing the existence of social classes as well as their antagonisms in the light of objective facts, which were harm- ful and should be eliminated by means, of reconstructing the economic system. The latter in turn must be the work not of some kind of ab-* stract,\"proletariat\" but of people with-good will and from various tocial segmenta: This-could. only be accomplished withi7the frame- . . work of One's own national state. Simultaneously however as a parallel to socialism with a characteristic of national sentiment, there was . established at the time in Poland a socialism of a different type which finally, crystalized itself into the Communist Party of Poland. The latter represented ,a non-Polish, cosmopolitan socialism with a terroristic and revolutionary program for social reconstruction. It found warm support among the ghetto milieu as well as among a cer- tain part of the Polish intelligentsia which was sensitive to. the influence Of Russian culture'to the extent thet it had found ittelf. really excluded from Polish, society. The first attempts at creating socialist organizations in. _Poland bore a Polish imprint (the activities of Boletlaw Limanowski). However already in the initial socialist organisation covering a broader area, there appeared the powerful influence of contemporary Russian socialism. This. was, the ap-called Polish Socialist Party \"Proletariat I.\" It was organized in 188,2 and from' the very begin- , , ning acquired definite Marxist characteristics with international- , . ist ideology.

These people considered that one of the achievements of the future international social revolu- tion would be the reconstruction cf Poland. This 'attitude was obtained from certain of Marx! writings. . \"Proletariat I\" accepted from contemporary Russian revolution- ary movements the idea of individual terrorism which was treated as a medium for agitation similarly to the approach used by anarchists., From the very beginning of its existence \"Proletariat I\" found it- self between the devil and the.deep blue sea,, i.e., between western European Marxism with an admixture of anarchism on the,one hand and on the other hand.the Russian \"Narodnaya Volya,\" the large terror- istic Blanqui (named after the French revolutionary of the nineteenth century who considered that a social revolution_could be success- ful only with the. assistince of conspiracies-by selected revolution- aries.and not by means of* broad mass movement) organisation di? rected by Zhelabov and.Zofia PerOvakays, Kibaitshits, and Vera Figner which through attempts to assassinate the Tsar and con-. spiracies Wanted to make place for democracy in Bussia.A very interesting attitude toward \"Proletariat I\",. was expressed by Rosa \"=??

The most powerful of all was.indubitably.Ludwik Warynski. a consistent Marxist for those times?but.one who was so blinded by the mirage of a rapid. victory for socialism on a world wide scale or st least throughout Europe that to him the case of Poland repre- sented a small matter of ,secondary importance. He was a proponent of a mass movement. and did not support a conspiracy by a small hand- ful of.terrorists. Warynski also adhered to the-concept of an alli- ance between the workers and the peasants which was later submitted to a reanalysis by Lenin and which to dite has been copied clumsily' by the communists. A second powerful figure in \"Proletariat\" was Stanislaw Kunicki, a martyr who.was hanged in the Citadel after the large trial of the \"Proletariat\" in 1885. Eunicki represented the, conspiratorial ;(? and terroristic movement and more than anybody else manifested a tendency townrd close cooperation with the Russian \"Narodnaya Volya.\" From him it wasAhat:the,cemmunists obtained the idea of collabora- tion with Russian revolutionaries which later brought about the com- plete subordinatien of the communist movement to the Soviet state, The third among'the.leaders of \"Proletariat\" was Saymon Dickstein, one of the most' talented theoreticians who was known under the party.pieUdonym of \"Jan *lot.\" His was a-tragic figure, because' he'died a suicide ,in despondency after\" the collapse of the movement to which he had given hisjaoul and due to the lack of reciprocity' to his love for:Jankowsks,whe was also a member of \"Proletariat,\" Dickstein' represented the movement related to?syndicailstic anarchism according .5??????... .11????\". -9 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Co Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 to which the main3paths toward the liberation of the workers lead through economic and notjpolitical struggle.

We must add that /*like Eon* is perhaps alone among Polish com- munists in that he reiemberathe anniversaries of \"Proletariat\" be- cause in general the communists have forgotten \"Pioletariat I\" and . those first pioneers of socialism in Poland. The anniversary when its 4 leaders were executed: Kunicki, Bardowski (an interesting and noble personality, he was a Russian and an investigative judge at Kalisz'who had become acclimatized in the country where he was loca- ted and Was, the father-in-law of LudwikWarynski; he, strongly em- phasized the Polish character of his party), Pietrusinski, and _ Osowski (28 January 1886) is remembered today by socialists of all shades whereas the PPS (its so-called CKW (Centralny Komitet Wykonawczy -- Central Executive Committee') possesses a strong cult of \"Proletariat I\" which is especially emphasized, while to the communists it is Immaterial. This can be 'explained by the latter's zealous patriotism toward Russia. It would be tactless and perhaps even a heresy In the presence Of the Russian proletariat, that van- guard of 'the world proletariat, to boast that Polish workers had a revolutionary and socia3ist party already At the time when the Rus- sian workers' movement was still in its infancy. Therefore-the'com- munists have not mentioned one word about \"Proletariat\"' during period of years in order not to decrease the historical ,\"contribu- tions\" of the Russian Bolsheviks to the Polish proletariat. Whet is more, and this soande paradoxical, the communists with all of their talent for issuing publications, (a strike of 100 workers An some small locality is sufficient for the purpose of immediately releas- ? ing a proclamation incorporating almost always' the sane phraseology) have not released a 'single public declaration about the \"Preletariat.!' -11- Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28 ?

The fact that \"Proletariat\" was organised at a time when there was no workers' party. in Russia at all (in Russia it was 1893 before the first tangible group of socialists and Marxists arose under the name \"Osvoboshdenie Truda\" in which V. Zasulich, P. Akselrod, Nate, Plekhanov and the younger activists Martov-Tsederbaum and Lenin collaborated), frequently gives trouble to communist quasi historians. They explain this by the allegedly earlier development of industry in the Kingdom Congress and the lack of such in Russia which is con- trary to the writings of Lenin himself who proved that the develop- ment of industry in Russia dates back to the end of the eighteenth century. The foregoing historians, if they are ever forced to speak or to write about \"Proletariat,\" write exclusively about its mistakes since only Bolshevism remains without error in this world. In general a tremendous percentage of communists in Poland literally know noth- ing concerning \"Proletariat.\" \"Proletariat'I\" collapsed toward the end of 1885 under the blows of the Russian police. Several of its leaders died heroically through execution in the Citadel of Warsawor like Warynski in the mstone sack\" at Schlisselburg. Despite the fact that they did not fight for Poland's independence, many of them deserve honorable mention. During the period of terrible'spiritual'depression and servility, their death was the only voice in protest to the wild tyranny of Burka. To. the man Warynski we can apply the words of Zeromski from his book Rosa [The Rose 1: \"He is not ours his soul is proceeding along its own path, once along a beaten Polish -12- Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 ii road, then along a wide Siberian highway ... ho will remain to the end alone,\" alone at any rate and not in the company of the contempo- rary hirelings of Stalin. After the fall of \"Proletariat I\" the history of the socialist (\"communist\") movement in Poland over the course of several years until 1887 does not abound with' interesting moments. 'It broke forth into flame during the so-called \"Proletariat II,\" an organisation mostly of high school and university students, and in the Union of Polish Workers. Both were merely reflections' ofthen contemporary 'Russian movements which were at that time becoming active. Polish revolutionaries vulgarly imitated Russiansieverrto the point of adopting 'their external appearance by wearing long beards and hair as well as shirts without neckties. \"Proletariat II\" was instrumental in the development of several scholars and publicists of unusual stature like the great sociologist and anthropologist Ludwik Krsywicki or the fine expert on the history of political doctrines Ludwik Kulcsycki. Not much better than \"Proletariat I\" do contemporary communists remember their second predecessor which was the Union of Polish Work- ' ers, existing from 1889 to 1892.. This was an almost exclusivitly workers' organization, taking a stand against conspiracy and terror, but organising economic campaigns which todiy'represent the core of communist tactic's. The Union of Polish Workers might have gone down into the pages of history as a glorious movement of Polish Communism were it not the fact that its ideology had many aspects in common with the Russian ideology of the so-called \"economists\" who boiled. down the socialist program to that of a daily struggle by the worker for his livelihood and his political enlightenment, postponing direct ..- 13 ' - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 arr Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release 2013/02/28 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 =It political struggle to n later period. These \"economists\" subsequently became, \"unfortunately\" for the Polish communists, the. Prototypes of the Mensheviks with whom Lenin fought a bitter struggle and incidentally developed himself into an excellent and devastating polemicist (the fact that the main creator of Russian \"economise Martynov [Plkkerl today has an office in the .editorial section of the Kommunisticheski Internatsional [Communist International' and denounces his former comrades, the Mensheviks, and praises Stalin brings no dishonor to Polish communists). For this reason \"our\" communists dislike any mention' of the Union of Polish Workers. If 100 communists Can be found in Poland who know something about this Union, this would be a miracle. Even such persons could have acquired their knowledge about the Union from the work of Pen-Roe or else from Mazowiecki- Kulczycki. The Union of Polish Workers provided the communists with 2 ;.? outstanding leaders in Juljan Marchlewski (Karski) and Adolf Warszaw- ski(Warsispite the fact that both of them finally became compromised due to their disagreement with pure Bolshevism regard- less of the 'prominent parts they had played in the Communist move- ment.

A different value is repre- sented by Adolf Warseawski (Waraki) Who, regardless of his education, always remained a coward with regard to the authorities in Moscow. About 1892 the Union of Polish Workers established a branch at Wilno which was named the Union of Lithuanisn'Workers. This leiter organisation in of interest merely because of the fact that Tanks Dsiorzynski,.the greatest man Polish Communism ever produced,began his first activities in it. Numerous legends are circulating about this tyrant, and these stories fill the pages of cheap literature. Essentially he represented a typical Asiatic statesman, energetic, brutal, and incomparably above his cowardly associates in courage. ? In 1893 the iacialist circles in Warsaw, connected with Rus- sten and German socialists and having support in the Union of Polish Workers, attempted to organize a party under the name Social Demo- cracy of the Polish Kingdom. However due to the lack of any organi- zational talents among its leaders, the Russian police was able to break it up with ease. It was not until 1897 that the remnants from ' Lhe,VoiC'imi Democracy of the Polish Kimgdom, united with the Union of ? Lithuanian Workers to establish the Social Democracy of the kingdom ? of Poland and Lithuania (abbreviated as SDKPiL (Socjal-Demokracja Krolestwa Polskiego I Litwyl, and hence the name \"esdepapeloxcy\" or Issdecy;\" also in use was the name \"reds\" which was later taken over by the communists). In this manner the final party form of Polish Marxism was crystalised into the SDKPiL which functioned until 1918. SDKPiL arose from the remaining parts of \"Proletariat II\" and the Union of Polish Workers, and the fused group went through various stages. At first the workers inside of Poland, in order to differentiate themselves - 15. - ? . ?

However when the Polish Socialist Party was established during this time (1892) at the Paris congress with its independence platform, the organisation within Poland under strong pressure from its social democratic leaders changed it's name to SDHP and subsequently added \"iL.\" After several years of active operations, this party collapsed and disappeared for a period of 5 years from the political arena. The masses of Polish workers are then acquired by the Polish Socialist Party. In 1900 the SDKPiL is strengthened from the outside thanks to the as- sistance of the German social democrats, especially Fr. Mehring, Parvus (Helphand) and in part-Hautsky. This of course breathed life into its activities. Around 1905 the SDKPiL achieved its greatest development on the background of the increasing revolutionary wave in Russia. The most characteristic attribute of the SDKPiL was its anti independence stand and the strong tendency to collaborate with Russian social temocrecy. For these reasons each rise in the revolu- tionary wave in Russia during the years 1905, 1907, 1912, 1914, and 1917 contributed simultaneously to a growth in the influence and power of the SDKPiL. Thla party was active only within the area of the Russian occupation zone, taking the attitude that socialists should cooperate within the framework of German and Austrian social democracy and not establish their own Polish ,parties in the areas under Prussian and Austrian occupation. Due to the foregoing the SDKPiL enjoyed the sympathy of German social democracy and of the Second Socialist international which was dominated by the Germans. -16- / - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 ?fik. The program of the SDKPiL was a simple duplication of the \"international socialist\" program and more accurately of German social democracy as elaborated by Kautsky (the so-called Erfurt Pro- gram of 1891). The radically international platform of the Polish nesdeke excluded any kind of autonomous revision of this program. This platform included the important theory of a \"limited incorpora- tion of the Polish Kingdom into Russia,\" a theory drawn up by Rosa Luxemburg (1872-1919) who was the main theoretician of the SDKPiL. She was born at 2amosc in a milieu situated completely outside of Polish or any other culture. Roza Luxemburg herself was a person with considerable knowledge although one aided, energetic, having a sharp pen and an exceptionally doctrinaire mind. Her influence in international socialist movement *as) extensive, especially in the German social democracy where she was leader of the radically left wing for many years. Over a long period of time Roza Luxemburg conducted a Talmudic type of struggle against Lenin. According to the theory of a \"limited incorporation of the Polish Kingdom into Russia,\" the concept of Poland or of a Polish state remains merely an obsolete idea from the precapitalistic epoch. The modern Poland which is capitalistic has developed and can develop 5 further only as a part of the occupying states. This is especially true with regard to the Congress Kingdom which is completely dependent upon eastern and mainly Russian markets for disposal of its indus- trial output. The annexation of the Congress Kingdom into Russia was 1, a benefit for the economic life of Poland according to' Rosa Luxem- burg. Therefore the socialist movement should once and for all reject the \"pipedreame of the nobility\" concerning the reconstruction of Poland and limit itself to the common struggle together with the en- tire proletariat of Russia toward the attainment of international - 17 - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 .0k socialist postulates. In her attachment to the \"unity and indivisibility of Empire,\" Rosa Luxemburg proceeded farther than the \"endecy\" and rejected any thought concerning autonomy for the Congress Kingdom within the limitations .even of the thin contemporary Orand Duchy of Finland. The SDKPiL had a well functioning and qualified leadership ,0 F1 . _ group whichcomprised apart from Roza Luxemburg also Leon .Jogiches (pseudonym Jan Tyszka), the de facto dictator of the party :with or- ganizational talents and ambitions of a Stalin; Feliks Dzierzynski (pseudonym \"Josef\"), the principal organizational force'itOthe Colin- % , . . .

We should add that Marchlewski,in such an anti- Polish party and in his active collaboration with the German and Rus- sian revolutions could not rid himself of .a certain Polish sentiment and .a shade of Polish national pride, which cin not' be said of ' Dzierzynski for instance. The.bloody'work of,the latter in the CHNKA [Extraordinary Commission for Combatting Sabotage and Acts Harmful, to the National Economy in the USSR) and in the GPU [Main Political Administration l extracted everything that could be called Polish from that individual.

Karol Radek began his career in the PPS (as a member of the editor- ial staff for the publication Naprzod (Forward\"). Finally among the leaders of the SWAPiL was one whose heroic death on the gallows of the Citadel in Warsaw added an aureole to that party in 1905, i.e., Marcin Kasprzak from Poznan province. . After the collapse of the revolution during the years 1905 to 1907, there took place considerable friction inside' of the SDKPiL. In the year 1912 on the background of the struggle within the War- saw party organization, this conflict was directed against the main . board of the party which brought about a split. At the head of the splinter group (thus the name \"rozlamowcy\" [splinter members were these len: Josef Unsslicht (pseudonym \"Janowics\"), Karol Sobelsohn (pseudonym \"Radek\"): Jakob Firstenberg (pseudonym \"Hanecki,\" who later became a high ranking economics official in the USSR), Mieczy - slaw Warssawski (pseudonym \"Bronski\"), Henryk Stein-Kaminski (later called \"Domski\"), and others.

A considerable role was played in the splitting up of the SDKPiL by the Bolshevikivwho could not even accept minor manifestations of independent policy on the part of the SDKPiL, whereas complete de- .pendence of the SDKPiL upon the Russian Bolsheviks again represented a source of continuous internal friction since each quarrel within the RSDRP fRosyjska Socjal Demokratyczna Robotnicza Partia 7- Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party) precipitated a corresponding action within the SDKPiL. These internal fights fill a considerable percen- tage of RSDRP history during the years 1898-1917. The most significant of these was the split into \"Bolsheviks\" and,1\"Meashaviks\" (the latter being a splinter closest to European social democracy) dating ,back to the year 1903. This break was such that the, leaders of the SDKPiL assumed a position which was essen- tially very unclear. Roza Luxemburg fought bitterly against Lenin and,his,stands on the nationality and.agrarian-problems as well as in the matter of party organization. The Menshaviks were always con- sidered, however, in theSDKPiL as compromisers. In general during the course of various quarrels which took place in the RSDRP, it is often' difficult to know what was happening. It remains 'a fact that .the splinters of Russian social democracy which were fighting among themselves created breaches within the SDKPiL. In the year 1907-1908 -a certain Trusewics-Zeleski established in the latter a \"Menshevik. fraction\" which later existed for some time as an independent organi- zation under the name \"Workers.'

The possibility of proving oneself the oldest collaborator with the Russian Bolshe- viks represents today the most authoritative and praiseworthy docu- mentation, enabling a. person to direct the communist party. ,The split which took place in the SAIKPiL during 1912. lasted until 1916, after which both fractions again united. At the end of , 1918 after the establishment of an independent Polish state, the rem- nants of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Aland and Lithuania fused with the' residue of the PPS -- Left Wing and created the Com- munist Workers' Party of Poland. This unification itself was to save the one group as well as the other from complete bankruptcy, because the fact that an independent and unified Poland had arisen became,e natural although ignoble finale to the existence of these 2 parties which originated and existed only to struggle against the concept of independence.

It is therefore not at all odd that after so much success achieved by Lenin in' the torn of 'die October Revolution, Polish Marx- ism placed itself without any qualifications'whatsoever under the command of the Russian Bolsheviks and forgot 'about differences in platforms. The SDKPiL is doubtlessly the closest and most direct pre- ? decessor of the KPP. From the former also originate our own Calumnious of today. However in the course of time the \"bolshevisation\" of the KPP led the Polish Communists to deny their ties with these famous forefathers. In order to characterize SDKOiL ideology, a term dis- honorable in the eyes Of the communists was thought Up: \"Luxemburgism.\" On tke'other hand this elimination of the SDKPiL'from the traditions of the KPP was the work of the social democratic leader Warski,.who in his later years transferred in fact but not pro forma under the protection of the PPS -- Left Wing. Warski began to rebuild the repu- tation of his old party already during the German occupation; and during the years 1922-23 he commenced denouncing Rosa Luxemburg on the count of Menshovism. Opinions regarding thi SDKPiL were finally blackened coMpletely by these same communiste who had defended -it 'during the year.\" 1922-23 aOinst *the attacka by Warski. The signal' to change tactics was issued by Stalin'himetlf in:the fall of 1931 in' his lengthy \"pastoral\" letter attacking the \"Troiakyite smuggling\", in Bolshevik historiography (this \"Trotskyite smuggling\" really ' nsant the somewhat objective historical methodology being applied at the time; Bolihivik.mistakes were only mentioned slightly as were those of Sta1imi4,(#aver Trtosky was still placed within the group which had created the 1917 revolution, and this could net be . tolerated by Stalin).

In general the entire process of eliminating the past from the XPP, as the communists call it \"the conquest of ideological heritage of Luxemburgism in the XPP,\" should be treated somewhat more exten- sively since this will facilitate an understanding of the concepts. and not too praiseworthy aspects as well as attributes of character possessed by the. leaders of todayxPP.

The reservations enunciated at the third congress of the KIPP during the spring of 1925 by one of the participants, Stanislaw Budsynski (pseudonyms \"Tradycja\" and \"Ziemniak\"), sound prophetic today: when speaking about the Bolabovisstion of the KPP , he cautioned: . \"But let us remember that we must implant the Bolshevik un-: grafted tree upon the trunk of contemporary Polish (emphasis of the author) communism. Only then will we achieve the fruit of a communist victory in Poland. If however we shall plant the Bolshevik ungrafted trees directly into the soil, they will die without bear- ing any fruit.\" (emphasis by author) (\"Report on the third UP con- gress,\" page 117). We must add to this speech that the Russian communists did all in their power to implant the \"Bolshevik ungrafted trees\" in the Polish soil. Of course as Budsynski foretold, they died. The communists should not wonder any more that their ignominious work has born no fruit. During the first years of its existence the Communist Work- ' -1 ors' Party of:Poland attempted not to speak at all about its past.. In secret its bankruptcy was understood. A certain amount of sen- timent for the old SDKPiL was maintained only by its former nen- bens who took up residence in Russia, for the moat part with positions in the Russian governmental administration. In 1923 they camegupon the idea ofj celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of .the KPRP, counting back to the establishment of the SIMPiL. This -Project ended in a great fight. Here is what the old Polish social democrat Babinski was bald enough to write: -25 - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 \"The'Communist'Workers' Party of Poland, established 10 years prior to theRussian Bolshevik party (1603), since the beginning of the former Should be considered the year 1893, i.e., the date when the Social Democracy of the Xingdom of Poland and Lithuania was crea- ted, is probably* the oldest party in the Third International.\" (St. Bohinski, Kalendars-komunistycsny.na rok 1922 [Communist Calendar for 19221, published in Moscow). On,the other hand at the same time the Bolsheviks who were. celebrating their twenty-fifth anniversary do not count like Bobinski did froi the establishment of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party of Bolsheviks in 1903 but from the year 1898, i.e., from the period when the first congress of thid party took place'. The prepara- tion therefore to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the XPRP would be in competition with the Bolsheviks. The leadership of the XPRP at that time well understood that the honor of being first al- ways belongs to the Russian proletariat and, through the medium of its chief Warski, replied negatively to the proposal of having such a jubilee. In his article Warski writes ironically: \"We.could'hive done this (celebrated .the 30 year jubilee) ? with more family pride in that the Polish branch of coimunisn would have appeared older than the Russian if not by a few centuries then at least by 5'years.

The principal reasoning behind his' statement ip as follows': \"It is as clear as the sun, because we had no interest in the'problem of revolutionary authority, because we did not consider at all the role of the party and revolution, because we did not pre- pare ourselves for a dictatOrship, because we were not a communist party as the Bolsheviks were, because spiritually we were engrossed in theory but in practice we were. completely enveloped by the atmos- phere of the Second International's left wing during the epoch of . the unceasing development of capitalism.' \"What a comical fanfare would thus surround our jubilee which would have as its aim to show the world that we are the oldest Com- munist Party, older than that of the Bolsheviks.\" (ibid., page 361). The position taken by the leadership of the XPRP and espec- ially that of Warski, who was one of the creators as well as one of the chieftains in the 6DXPiL, precipitated a veritable storm in Mos- cow among the Polish communists. Insulted were Dzierzynski, Unselicht, Marchlewski, Leseczynski, Zaks, Bobinski, Dolecki,'in brief the entire elite of \"Polish\" communism. The Moscow newspaper Trybuna Komunistycsna [Communist Tribunal began to attack Warski because of his renegade position. The high point in this struggle was at.: tained,at the third congress of the XPBP, after the political _bankruptcy of -the -then. current party leadership. The official re- porter on Bolsbevization, Skulski (real name was Stanislaw Martens), , states that: \"The claim that SDIXPiL traditions represent& serioud obstacle on the pith toward bolshevisation of the party and that only the 27 Oa npriaRsified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved forRelease2013/02/28 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 _./ Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 /I ? ii young communist generation without any SDKPiL background is capable of bolshevizing the XIV.-- this statement is erroneous. \"The entire past of the SDKPiL, its full experience in revolu-- tionary battles, and' its leading role at the head.of.the.struggling proletariat made it the closest to the Russian bolsheviks; today the SDKPiL background .represents the .foundation and the guarantee of further transformation of the KPP,into a truly bolshevik,party.\" (Brochure entitled \"Report from the Third congress .of the KPP,\". pages 444 and 445). Leliwa (the same Babinski) participating in the discussion hastened to add:.. , \"The attitude 'of the Russian bolsheviks toward the SDKPiL'and the position of the latter vis a vis bolshevism were rather harmonious if not identical( with' our stand and has nothing to do with-the rene- gade articles of Comrade Warski concerning our excellent.bolshevik past\"' (Ibid., page 96).

Several positive aspects of the SDKPiL ideology and activity were recounted, especially, in the practical sphere. But even Bronkowski underscores that: \"That which was often a result of influence by the all-Rus- mien revolution and by its Bolshevik vanguard, that which was the expression of the revolutionary instinct on the part of the prole- tarian masses -- we tenaedto accept as the merit of tho'party.\".

Only one of its leaders, Tadeusz Rechniewski (Karski), is deserving of memory due to the fact that he daintained Polishness among the workers in Wilno province and worked on the general education of the masses. The .PPS - Left Wing attempted to cooperate with the Russian mensheviks, the most bar7 ren and weakoat splinter' from Russian socialism. This collaboration also induced it to work together with the' \"Bund\", (General.Ution of Jewish Workers fAlgemajner Jidyszer Arbeter Build) abbreviated as \"Bund\" originated in Lithuania in 1897 by fusion of socialist circles formerly connected with the PPS but disillusioned with the latter under the influence of Jewish nationalism and ... russophilisi; sub- sequently the \"Bund\" became a part of menshevismHin Russiajnat al- Ways with strong bolshovik overtones, whereas in the Congress King- dom the influence was SDKPiL), and this move led to a not too famoul combination during elections to the Dues in 1912, This resulted in the despatch of a delegate from Warsaw in the form of a certain Jagiello who originated from Plock (a representative on the level of the \"ninny\" or of the \"man with the ear horn\" who appeared in Polish comics several years ago). This block, it should be mentioned , also, established a pretext for a loud antisemitic affair: In gen- eral the PPS -t Left Wing attempted to combat the independence move- ment as much as it could, but for-the benefit of the \"fellow travel- ler\" it never did give up the pseudo patriotic phraseology. In theory this group propagated collaboration with the Russian revolutionary movement but could not find a place for itself there. The past' ofthe\" PPS was betrayed by. the members of the PPS - Left Wing, but the glorious traditions of the former were, not rejected by the latter. It ia not surprising therefore that the pps Revoiutienary,Fraction as well as the SDKPiL hated the PPS - Left Wing.

Alter the reacquisition of independence by Poland, the PPS Left Wing had no more work to do. The majority of its leaders and part of its membership transferred to the KPRP. Waski, as we know, also found himself in the latter. In the article which we have al- ready cited about the jubilee for the party, he attempted to defend the past of the PPS - Left Wing by writing: \"The historical service rendered: by the PPS - Left Wing, was ,that while still within the bosomotthel PPS,' within the directly, oppressive to the spirit atmosphere oZ class conflict between. social- ism and the chauvinism of the,Pilsudskis and the Wojciechowskis (this man was attacked by Warski only, because he?wae President of Picaand- at the time), it launched an ideological and organizational struggle for the liberation of PPS workers from their bonds of mationalistic ideology and that it was able to split the PPS,and,by degree intro- duce the majority of its workers along a common path with the SDEPiL.\" (Ibid; page 354). Later in the year 1926,a man close to the communists named Besem (B. Szapiro), attempted to rehabilitate the PPS - Left Wing' ' in his biography of Rechniewski. The very fact that it was met with a sharp censure by the EPP after its publication by the communist book house flEsiazka\" is indicative of the irritation evoked by this work. Besem emphasized that Rechniewski was a supporter of Polish independence. A similar fiasco was net by another EPP historian Eugeniusz Przybyszewski who lived in Russia and used the pseudonym \"Czeslaw Jasinski\" while there, when he tried to whitewash that party.

' I j Apart from these two main ideological trends in the EPP, with time there began to manifest themselves still other events brought along with the extensive addition of members from other parties.

CHAPTER II The communist party originated from a fusion between the Social Democracy'of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania on the one hand and the PPS - Left Wing on the other which took place at the first so called unification congress on 16 December 1918 in War- saw. The new party adopted the name \"Communist-Workers' Party of Poland\" and later added the subtitle \"Section of the Communist Inter- national.\" This name'differed from those of the Russian, German, and other communist parties in the adjective \"workers.\" As was subse- quently explained by the leaders of the KPRP themselves, this adjec- tive was inserted on purpose in order to diitinguish the party from the Bolsheviks who appeared to be not very proletarian in view of their \"peasant deviation.\" In general' the Poliih communists 'at the ? ,- . , : ? , - beginning thought of themselves as being better; they considered themselves to be on a higher level and as possessing more culture than the Bolsheviks. At any 'rateRoza Luxemburg also suggested the name \"Workers\" for the German 'communists, placing the movement in western Europe' on asuperior plane to that of the semi Asiatic movement of the Bolsheviks. Poland at the time ,had just been resurrected. In the East thi revolutionary storm had eliminated froi the earth's surface .the greatest enemy of Poland - Moscow tsarism. On the ruins of the latter Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 '1\\ Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28 CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 there was growing a new and dangerous enemy who was elastic, young, 1 and adventurous. This was Bolshevism in the name of which the'prole- tarian revolution had designated .a plan to conquer the entire world or at least the greater part of Europe. /n these plans Poland was to become one of the first victims. Theoretically the Bolsheviks were alone among Russian political parties in their recognition of Polish independence, but they wanted to have relations only with a Poland under a communist system. In practice this;lwould have been a Poland completely subservient to them and not a \"bourgeois!' coun- try. The definition of a bourgeois country according to them is any state in which the communists-bolsheviks do not exercise power, i.e. each country independent of them. In general the Bolsheviks attempt to create the illusion as if Leninism to. which they adhere 4 did not negate the concept of nationality. In practice however this looks different. Sociologically speaking there can be only two ideas of nationality: the nation as an organism, directed by its own in- dependent state; and the nation as an independent cultural organism, more or less exclusive. However both one and the other were completely eliminated by Leninism which can be proven by the views of Lenin himself as expressed in his Polemic with the \"Bund\" on the \"national- ity problem\" (published in Polish at Leipzig [Germany] in,1927 by \"Stach fradycja\" IBudsynakil who was mentioned in- the foregoing). The year 1918 brought about the destruction of the great em- pires of the Hohenzollern.' and the Hapsburgs. Revolutionary waves shook the foundations of the contemporary social order -in the West. , During this time in Poland the situation 'was no better. Generically Polish \"areas of the country like Upper Silesia, Pomerania, Wanda and Usury were still in the'possession ofGermany.

Machinery was taken away by Russians or Germans. Agriculture had been pillaged successively by all of the occupants and then destroyed by'four'years of military action. A large number of men capable of creative work were in foreign armies or else abroad. The young Polish statehood was in the process of establishing itself as if from nothing. The only more permanent thing in exiatence at that time,was the Polish army or rather the beginnings of an army, in the first place in the form of Josef Pilsudiki's legions 'and also other formations organised abroad. The latter' were returning slowly, perhaportoo,slowly due to .cauies be- yond their control, back to Poland.cThe freedom which had been a dream'for so many generations now acted'upon!the'Polish society like an intoxicant.

The coiling revolution would sweep up all of them from the surface of the earth, because: \"The era of direct struggle for a realisation of the socialist system has opened, an era of social revolution Poland is entering this phase of social revolution Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 I &ammo The.pioneer and model for this revolution was of course Soviet Russia, so the first, congress of the KPRP issued the slogan for in- corporation of Poland into this centerfor building socialism and states: . ? \"The proletariat of Poland rejects all political slogans like I t ? autonomy, self government, or self determination 1 14 this manner the KPRP; eliminated not only,thesslogan of independence for Poland but even the concept of autonomy, \"admitted\" for POland (i.e: Congress -Poland),by the,SDKPiL, and self government (something between independence and autonomy),whichlad,beenikindly granted to Poland by,the PPS -Left Wing. .The RPRP even rejected, contrary to Lenin, the bolshevik \"self determination\" ,regardless of the fact, that.thici*ould,not have prejudged the,fate,of,the?coun- try.,In practice ,the latter idea means the \"voluntary\" integration with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with right of secession (and how!) upon demand. The consequence of such a position,was of course a decidedly antagonistiC attitude toward, the Polish statehood then under, con- struction. The first congress of the KPRP attacked the Polish army with speciai,sharpness: \"The proletariat will combat all attempts to create a bour- geois, counter revolutionary Polish army For the international camp of the social revolution, there is no problem of boundaries ?

However at the time they believed in it religiously and-even-swore-upon it. At any rate this different line of development in Germany took place not without the fault and \"experiences of the Russian revolution,\" which especially in Germany where Soviet Russia is relatively well known acted in a frighten- ing manner. Of course the \"fermentations\" in such \"neutral\" coun- tries like Switzerland, Holland, Norway, Denmark,Aptc. have remained unnoticed by anybody except the communists. .Thise.lie.within the wild hallucinations of the communists similar to the revolutionary for- mentation.in the victorious countries of the \"imPerialist coalition,\" i.e. the Entente.

A similar exaggeration and falsification designated the attitudisrof Vie first KPRP'congress toward the Polieh Socialist -Party which,. as is well known,, participated actively in the recon- struction of the. Polish state. The first congress of thei'MPRPiclaims that \"social patriotism\":. \"strives toward entanglement of the Polish peoplelin,an.unending series of nationalistic wars with all of the bordering states, toward -a subordination of the entire social life to the interests of rapacious Polish militarism;\" whereas the.pea- , sant government of Jedrzej Moraczewskt which had been established at Lublin was characterized as follows: \"It arose not on the basis of revolution by the masses of peasantry likes the government of Kerensky in Russia or that of Ebert in Germany, but rather as the indirect result of revolution in adjacent countries Inconsequence, it becomes to a greater degree (emphasis of author) than the others a coyer for the rule of the bourgeoisie.\"- The most.bi,tter enemy Ofsthe PPS, yet one not lackingin logic, could not write anything like, the abeve 'about that party and still maintain a clean conscience. Making the cabinet of'Moracitewski into a more bourgeois government than that of-Ebirt and Noske in Germany itteits not so' muchthe lack of honesty in the evaluation of politi- cal phenomena as it does the lack of common sense. As we will see later the communists changed their views radically in order to return to them again recently, although in a less exaggerated form. ? 40 -2 ' ? - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28 : CIA-RDP81-01o43RnniRnniAnnno Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/28: CIA-RDP81-01043R001600160002-1 .???? _ ewe, The first congress, of the KPRP issued, several agitation directives )to its party,.

Formally there existed a parity: half of the delegates represented the SDKPiL and half the PPS - Left Wing. Among the representatives were many who had been sent from Russia which was especially true of delegates in the former group. , The mew leadership that emerged was also selected on an equal basis. In this connection the SDKPiL demonstratively did not elect the most prominent man among them, Warski, who was even then considered to be oscillating in the direction of the left wing PPS. The major- ity of the still living SDKPiL activists \"were working at the time in the Russian revolution,\" for the most part in the MIKA under the leadership of Dsiersynski or. in the origami combatting the rem- nants of culture and nationality possessed by Poles as well as the Catholic Church.

There were to ber\"no\" borders of course.

Thus the PartyiCouncil of the KPRP' (today it is called the plenum-of the Central Committee) in February 1919 passed a resolution boycotting elections to the constituent Sejm, contrary to the directives of the Bolsheviks. In such a man- ner the communists are forcing themselves into an underground. Sub- sequently they motivated their unwise step in the 'following wsy: \"a boycott of the Sejm'by the KPRP in 1919 was justified since, al- though class warfare had not assumed with uS a revolutionary pitch, there did exist the possibility of a direct transition to the authority of councils in Poland in view of the lack of any political organisation on the Part of the Polish bourgeoisie, in view of the rule by councils in neighboring Germany (?) and in Russia, and-in view of the establishment of councils in Poland.
