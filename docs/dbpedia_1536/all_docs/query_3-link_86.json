        "text": "This essay takes the eighteenth-century artistic patronage of the noble Plater family in Krāslava (Pol. Krasław), a private magnate town in Polish Livonia (present-day Latgale, Latvia), an administrative division within the historical territory of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as a case study to explore multiple modes of artistic migration facilitated by human agents and the agentive properties of objects against the historical backdrop of the Age of Partition (c. 1750-1810). I examine how the Plater by means of migration by proxy and through performative engagement commissioning, collecting and displaying art and architecture constructed a network of monuments and artworks evoking the notion of the Plater as heirs to the glory of Rome, to re-form their dominion as the crossroads of Europe’s Roman Catholic frontier, where the long Counter-Reformation negotiated a complex web of intersecting yet potentially opposed religio-political prerogatives. I argue that these magnates undertook a multifaceted campaign of self-fashioning to realign their interests and re-legitimize their patrimonial hegemonic claims by undertaking the translatio reliquiae (transfer of relics), the ceremonial transfer of holy remains from the Roman catacombs according to venerable Roman Catholic tradition, and appealing to a broader cultural translatio imperii (transfer of rule or empire). Their campaign thematized the temporal passage between ancient and modern and the geographic distance between the Italian and Baltic sphere in a way that reanimated the grandeur of the past and deployed mediated forms of knowledge about its target (Rome) in honor of the illustrious patrons. It also took advantage of the fact that the beleaguered eighteenth-century Holy See sought to reaffirm the papal city as caput mundi, renovate its image as international arbiter of taste and reaffirm the illusion of integral Catholic empire.\n\nThe aim of this article is to draw attention to the complexity of the emergence of ancient and archeological collections and museums in Poland since 1918, without exploring the history of each partition. Polish archeology is particularly indebted to them since, as a scientific discipline, it developed during the times of lack of statehood after the partitions of Polish territories. The politics of the invaders, even though different in each partition, did not favor the development of scientific institutions in which archeology could have found support. Till 1918 only individual collections and museums established by scientific societies or other social organizations were developing on Polish grounds. State institutions collecting monuments aroused only after the First World War. Historical curiosity and passion for collecting constitute the basis of archeology as a science; however, it was only when people interested in the past times moved from collecting ancient items to elaborating means of using them for a rational reconstruction of ancient times that archeology began evolving into a separate discipline. It is thus fair to say that collections and museums, along with scientific societies, were the cradle of archeology. Polish archeology is particularly indebted to them since, as a scientific discipline, it developed during the times of lack of statehood after the partitions of Polish territories. The politics of the invaders, even though different in each partition, did not favor the development of scientific institutions in which archeology could have found support. In this situation, collections and museums became treasuries of knowledge of sort, and knowledge was essential for conducting research and educating future generations of archeologists. In this article, I would like to draw attention to the complexity of the emergence of ancient and archeological collections and museums in Poland since 1918, without exploring the history of each partition. The activities of collectors of Silesia and Pomerania (that in this period were not part of the Polish state) also remain outside my considerations [Jażdżewski, 1983, p. 3–6]. When examining the history of collecting and museum management in general, a reference worth making is to an inspiring essay of Krzysztof Pomian, an outstanding philosopher and historian and expert in the history of European collecting and museum activity, entitled \" Archeology, Nation, History \". In this essay, he makes references to the three ways of thinking and methods of describing the past, namely, 1. Biblical history, general history, understood as the history of how all mankind was saved by Jesus Christ and the Church; 2. The history of Rome, general history, understood as the history of the unification of mankind by the Roman Empire; 3. Ethnic history that describes the history of particular nations taking into consideration their distinctiveness [Pomian, 2002, pp. 9–15]. Formed in the Middle Ages, these three perspectives are typical for Latin Christian tradition and are interconnected. According to K. Pomian, it is those three outlooks that determine the place and role of archeology in the European culture, and by doing so, they define the kind of archeological materials that are being collected. From the 11 th to 15 th century, when the inhabitants of Latin world were united in Christianity, Biblical history was the dominating one but the common past was also ancient history. It was a common practice of chronicle authors to situate the history of their nations within this history creating so called ethnogenetic legends which functioned as traditions about pagan past [Pomian, 1968, p. 14; 2002, p. 10]. Due to the process of Christianization, the latter one was becoming more and\n\nThe study of Classical antiquity put researchers of the Eastern Bloc in a special cultural position after WW2. Due to the international nature of the classics, working in this field of study was not without dangers as researchers speaking unknown living and dead languages came under suspicion of the state administration that wanted to control the entirety of culture. What does the Classical tradition mean in the time of state socialism? How did a county museum lead by an archaeology professor with a bow tie and his wife, also a renowned archaeologist, maintain and display this tradition? How did the Gorsium Archaeological Park become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Hungary under the communist era? In my presentations, I am looking for an answer to these questions by investigating the archaeological exhibitions (Roman, Celtic, Classical) of King Stephen Museum in Székesfehérvár between 1949-1989. I am proposing questions concerning archaeology and the politics of remembrance, popular science and exhibition policy, antiquity and propaganda, socialism and aesthetics. When discussing these exhibitions, I will take the following aspects into consideration: 1. reconstructing the genesis of the exhibition 2. evaluating the archaeological aspects of the exhibition 3. analysing the methodology of the exhibition 4. reviewing the press of the exhibition The main questions I identified are the following: 1. How did the museum become an internationally renowned archaeological centre that organised the Limes Conference in 1976, or the exhibition and conference titled Eastern Celts in 1974? 2. What effects did the Sovietisation of Hungarian archaeology have on the archaeological research of Roman Pannonia and how did the whole process work in everyday practice? Did Marx, Engels, and Stalin have any real impact on the study of Roman archaeology after WW2 in Hungary? Uncovering the details of this story, which is unique and general at the same time, is representative of the four decades of Roman archaeology in Hungary after 1945."
