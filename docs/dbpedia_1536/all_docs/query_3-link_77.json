        "text": "Polish Music Newsletter Vol. 17, no. 9\n\nPMC News\n\n2011 Paderewski Lecturer: PAWEŁ ŁUKASZEWSKI\n\nIt is clear that Polish composer Paweł Łukaszewski belongs to this company of titans…\n\nI found myself amazed at each subtle harmonic surprise, at each stunningly apt underlining of a phrase… Do not hesitate.\n\nRonald E. Grames—review of 2008 Hyperion recording in Fanfare Magazine\n\nComposer and conductor Paweł Łukaszewski was born in 1968 into a family of musicians in Częstochowa, Poland. His compositions—especially his extensive catalogue of sacred choral music—has their roots in the neo-mediaeval tonality and spiritual tradition espoused by such composers as Henryk Mikołaj Górecki, Wojciech Kilar, Arvo Pärt, John Taverner and Morten Lauridsen.\n\nWorking within what the composer describes as a “renewed tonality,” Łukaszewski achieves surprisingly rich and subtle expressive results. The use of major and minor modes in Łukaszewski’s music serves only as a point of departure for his highly subjective musical style which, especially in the realm of vocal compositions, is inspired by texts he is setting to music.Łukaszewski’s highly individual musical language, rhythmic vitality, careful formal layout in all of his works, as well as his profound understanding of the liturgical texts in the Catholic rite combine to produce music that is strikingly traditional yet fully modern.\n\nSeveral of Paweł Łukaszewski’s compositions will be heard at the 2011 Paderewski Lecture-Recital, an annual event presented by the Polish Music Center that features a modern Polish composer. This year’s Paderewski Lecture will take place on Thursday, October 6, 2011, at 7:30 p.m. at Newman Recital Hall on the USC Campus. This event is free and open to the public.\n\nThe composer will travel to Los Angeles on a travel grant from the Adam Mickiewicz Institute‘s 2011 “Kultura Polska Na Świecie” [Polish Culture Worldwide] program to work with students from the USC Thornton School of Music and deliver his Paderewski Lecture. Mr. Łukaszewski’s lecture, entitled “My Sacred Music – Composer’s Credo,” will be followed by a performance of selected vocal and choral works.\n\nBaritone Dan Gibbs, a master’s degree student in the studio of Professor Rod Gilfry at the USC Thornton School of Music will present two songs for voice and piano based on poems by Czesław Miłosz—the 1980 Nobel Prize for Literature laureate, whose centenary is being celebrated this year. Soprano Sewan Howsepian Salmasi, a DMA student in the studio of Professor Elizabeth Hynes at the USC Thornton School of Music will perform Łukaszewski’s Four Haikus for voice and piano to texts by Basho, Buson, Kyorai, Saimaro, Issa, and Taigi, translated into the Polish by Agnieszka Żuławska-Umeda. Pianist Grace Chung, a master’s degree candidate in the Thornton Keyboard Collaborative Arts program will perform as accompanist.\n\nFinally, Thornton Associate Professor of Practice of Choral Music, Maestro Nick Strimple will lead the Vocal Ensemble of the Polish Music Center in Łukaszewski’s O Adonai, Two Lenten Motets, and Angelus Domini. Describing the 2008 recording of Mr. Łukaszewski’s choral works on the Hyperion label (CDA67639), English reviewer Patric Stanford remarked on the “… remarkably expressive quality” of the Antiphonae and likened Łukaszewski’s music to “pure magic.”\n\nPaweł Łukaszewski began his musical journey by studying cello in his native city of Częstochowa and graduating with distinction in 1987. He continued cello studies at the Warsaw Academy of Music and graduated with a diploma in 1992. Afterwards he studied composition with Professor Marian Borkowski in Warsaw and choral conducting with Ryszard Zimak at the Music Academy in Bydgoszcz. By 2007 Mr. Łukaszewski completed his doctorate in composition degree and currently he holds a title of professor at the Chopin University in Warsaw. Over the past decade Mr. Łukaszewski was invited as visiting professor to universities in Chile and Argentina, and has held a series of lectures in France, Germany, Spain, and Norway.\n\nMr. Łukaszewski’s compositions have been recognized with numerous awards and accolades, including the Tadeusz Baird Young Composers’ Competition, the Young Composers’ Forum in Kraków, the Warsaw Music Academy Competition, the Adam Didur Composers’ Competition, and the Florilege Vocal de Tours Competition in France. He was also given the Częstochowa City Award in 1995, was decorated with the Cavalier’s Cross of the Polonia Restituta Order in 1998, the Saint Albert Brother Award in 2006 and the Silver Gloria Artis Medal and Primate of Poland Award in 2011. Recordings of Mr. Łukaszewski’s works won the prestigious Fryderyk Awards in 1999, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2011, and he has been named the City of Warsaw scholarship recipient in 2010.\n\nFinding a wide appeal among the audiences and performers, Paweł Łukaszewski’s compositions have been heard at over one hundred festivals in Poland and abroad and recorded for over seventy different labels, including Hyperion, Acte Préalable, Polskie Nagrania, DUX, Musica Sacra Edition, and Signum Records. Over fifty of his compositions were published by Chester-Novello, PWM Kraków, Edition Ferrimontana, Edizioni Carrara, Lorenz Corporation, and Choris Mundi. Mr. Łukaszewski’s music was featured in performances throughout Europe as well as in Argentina, Chile, China, Israel, Cuba, Canada, South Korea, Peru, Uruguay and the United States.\n\nSince 1995, Mr. Łukaszewski has served as the Secretary and the Program Director of the Laboratory for Contemporary Music International Festival, and since 2000 he has been president of the Musica Sacra Society. Mr. Łukaszewski is also a member of the ZAIKS Society and the Board of the Polish Recording Academy. He serves on the boards of international festivals, including the Gaude Mater Sacred Music Festival in Częstochowa, and as jury member for composition competitions in Arrezzo, Moscow, Bucharest, Katowice, Bydgoszcz, Legnica, Warsaw, and Częstochowa. In addition to his activities as composer, Mr. Łukaszewski directs the Cathedral Choir of the Warsaw-Praga and heads the Musica Sacra Publishing Company.\n\nMr. Łukaszewski’s choral works include the cycles Beatus vir (1996-2001), Antiphonae (1995-1999), Veni Creator (2004), Stabat Mater (1994), Pięć żałobnych pieśni kurpiowskich [Five Funeral Songs from the Kurpie Region] (2009), Responsoria tenebrae (2010), and Lamentationes (2011). The catalogue of his vocal-instrumental compositions includes Vesperae pro defunctis (1995/2011), Via Crucis (2000), Messa per voci e fiati (2004), Magnificat & Nunc dimittis (2007), Miserere (2008), and Missa de Maria a Magdala (2010) and three large-scale symphonies.\n\nMr. Łukaszewsk is also a prolific orchestral composer, including Arrampicata (1992), Winterreise (1993), Organ Concerto (1996), Concerto for Orchestra (1997), Sinfonietta (2004), Divertimento (2006), Trinity Concerto (2007), and Utopia (2008).\n\nOver the past two decades, Mr. Łukaszewski has received numerous commissions from such diverse organizations and performers as Theatre des Cinq Diamants, Polish Radio, Musica Viva Association, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaiso, Akademie Klausenhof, Kobe Chuo Chorus, Polish Composers’ Union, Britten Sinfonia, Contemporary Music for All, Kultur-Insel, Adam Mickiewicz Institute, The King’s Singers, and Wrocław Philharmonic.\n\nThursday, October 6, 2011| 7:30 p.m.\n\n2011 Paderewski Lecture-Recital: featuring Paweł Łukaszewski\n\nUniversity of Southern California – Newman Recital Hall (See AHF on map)\n\n3616 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAdmission: FREE, Parking: $8\n\nEnter USC Gate #3 at McCarthy Way & Figueroa St (Parking Structure X)\n\nInfo: 213. 821.1356 | polmusic@thornton.usc.edu\n\n[Sources: hyperion-records.co.uk, lukaszewski.org.uk, Photo: nickstrimple.com]\n\nGifts to PMC\n\nOur friends and partners at the Polish Music Information Centre in Warsaw recently sent us another priceless gift—the Sound Chronicle of the 2009 Warsaw Autumn Festival.

Several of these new works were commissioned by the Festival. Below is a listing of all of the works by Polish composers that will be premiered during the Festival week.\n\nOn September 23 at 7:30 p.m. in Polish Radio’s Lutosławski Concert Studio, Paweł Hendrich’s Emergon αß (WA commission) will be premiered by Cologne’s musikFabrik ensemble with guests: Carl Rosman, contrabass clarinet; Dirk Rothbrust, percussion; Paweł Hendrich, computer; and Sian Edwards, conductor. On September 20 at 7:30 p.m., also in the Lutosławski Concert Studio, Agata Zubel’s Ulicami ludzkiego miasta [The Streets of Human City] (a Deutschlandfunk commission) will be premiered by the European Workshop for Contemporary Music with Rüdiger Bohn, conductor. On September 24 at noon, Zorka Wollny and Artur Zagajewski’s creation Oratorio for Orchestra and Warsaw Citizens’ Choir will be premiered “spontaneously” by the Akwarium Big Band and the Warsaw Citizens’ Choir, with Ryszard Borowski conducting. During the final gala concert of the Festival on September 24 at 7:30 p.m., Breaking News (WA commission) by Aleksander Nowak (right) and Andrzej Krzanowski’s Symphony No. 1 will have their world premieres. The final gala will be performed by Agata Zubel, soprano; Jadwiga Rappé, alto; Sylwester Smulczyński, tenor; Piotr Sałajczyk, electronics; and the Warsaw Philharmonic and the choir of the Podlasie Opera & Philharmonic in Białystok with Lucas Vis, conductor.\n\nThis year, the Festival has focused on young audience members with a new series of concerts and events entitled “Little Warsaw Autumn.” As a part of this series, Patryk Zakrocki’s sound installation Melodeusz (WA commission) will be presented in the Old Guardhouse in Łazienki Park all day throughout the Festival. On September 18 at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., Michał Moc’s S.A.N.D (WA commission) will be premiered by the percussion group/artistic collective Ritmodelia and cellists Magdalena Bojanowicz and Michał Pepol, with Michał Moc creating audience animation and Bartłomiej Orlicki creating visuals.\n\nIn addition to the fantastic program of the Festival itself, Warsaw Autumn always highlights several fringe events happening concurrently around the city, and these events also include several premieres. On September 19 at 4 p.m., Paweł Buczyński’s Shachrit will be given its World Premiere during a concert organized by the Warsaw branch of the Polish Composers’ Union (ZKP). Performers are: Sebastian Aleksandrowicz, oboe; Grzegorz Gorczyca, piano; Kamil Walasek, viola; and Tomasz Woźniak, trumpet. Other works on this all-Polish program include: Artur Cieślak – Odcienie ciszy [The Hues of Silence], Piotr Moss – Eledy III – Chants lointains, Sławomir Czarnecki – Interludia Sabałowe [Sabała’s Interludes], Aleksander Kościów – Postlude I, Aldona Nawrocka – Capriccio, and Maciej Zieliński – Lutosławski in memoriam.\n\nAnother ZKP fringe event is a series of two concerts organized by the Youth Circle of the Polish Composers’ Union. The first program—built around the theme of Homer’s Odyssey—features young organist/composer Dariusz Przybylski (left) performing an entire program of premieres, including his own compsition. World Premieres include: Dariusz Przybylski – Prologue, Eunho Chang – Sanjo V-Fantasia, Kanstantsin Yaskou – Mapa wiecznego powrotu Odyseusza [Map of the Eternal Return of Odysseus], Ralph Bernardy – Taso, Alexander Campkin – Bolts of Fire, Jagoda Szmytka – Open the box #2, Bohdan Sehin – A jak żeglarze ziemi cieszą się widokiem… [And the sailors enjoying the view of the earth…], and Tomasz Jakub Opałka – Epilogue. These will be performed on September 20 at the Evangelical Reformed Church. The second concert in the series will take place at the Mazovian Regional Center for Culture and Arts on September 22 at 4 p.m. It will include World premieres by Jakub Polaczyk (right)– Chroset I: Mikrons, Jarosław Drozd – Przeźrocze paranoi [Slides of Paranoia], and Katarzyna Dziewiątkowska-Mleczko – Urban project. Also on the program: Mateusz Ryczek’s Strzępy snu [Shreds of Sleep], and Marcin Piotr Łopacki’s String Trio and String Quartet\n\nTo learn more about the Festival overall, see the Festivals Section below.\n\nWratislavia Cantans Premieres\n\nDuring the 46th International Festival Wratislavia Cantans—held from September 2–17, 2011—works by Paweł Łukaszewski (b. 1968) and Paweł Szymański (b. 1954) will be given their World Premiere in Wrocław, Poland. Both compositions were commissioned by the Festival.\n\nOn September 11, the Festival will hold a concert in commemoration of the World Trade Center tragedy in 2001 during which Paweł Łukaszewski’s Lamentationes will be premiered. This 16-minute composition is based on the text of Prophet Jeremiah’s Lamentations. The work will be performed by Wrocław Philharmonic Choir (pictured below), conducted by Agnieszka Franków-Żelazny. Also on the program are works by Josef Rheinberger (1839–1901).\n\nOn September 16, Paweł Szymański’s Phylakterion will be given its premiere. Also on the program: Henryk Mikołaj Górecki (1933–2010) – Euntes ibant et flebant, Andrzej Krzanowski (1951–1990) – Salve Regina, and Paweł Szymański – In Paradisum deducant te angeli and Miserere. The concert will be performed by the Zespół Śpiewaków Miasta Katowice Camerata Silesia [Singers’ Corps of Katowice and Camerata Silesia] and the following instrumentalists: Krzysztof Karpeta – cello; Tomasz Daroch – cello; Robert Fender – cello; Wojciech Fudala – cello; Malwina Lipiec – harp; Arkadiusz Kuc – percussion; Tomasz Rawski – percussion; Bartłomiej Merta – percussion; and Anna Szostak – conductor.\n\nChester Novello, one of Szymański’s publishers, provides this insight into the composer’s compositional approach:\n\nThe modern artist, and this includes composers, finds himself tossed within two extremes. If he chooses to renounce the tradition altogether, there is the danger of falling into the trap of blah-blah; if he follows the tradition too closely, he may prove trivial. This is the paradox of practising art in modern times. What is the way out? Since you cannot fully free yourself from the trivial, you need to play a game with it, treat is as a material allowing you to stick to certain elements of the convention, while keeping it at bay through the use of quotation marks, metaphors and paradoxes. Such treatment may result in a tangle of means leading to eclecticism. Censured and rejected in avant-garde times, and, to a large extent, rightly so, eclecticism is now coming back under the guise of postmodernism. However, there are many methods to stay out of eclecticism despite playing games with tradition. An important method for me is to violate the rules of the traditional language and to create a new context using the elements of that language.

Organized by composer Jarosław Siwiński, these far-ranging discussions are open to the public and will take place on the first Saturdays of the next three months: September 3, October 1, and November 5. Guest composers include Krzysztof Knittel, Romuald Twardowski and Aleksander Kościów. Małgorzata Kołcz—a double bass player, humanist and the organizer of such musical events as Warsaw’s Nowe Miasto Summer Festival and the June 2011 concert of world premieres, “Musical Landscapes of Czesław Miłosz”—will moderate the 90-minute discussion sessions.\n\nThe cycle of meetings will include multimedia presentations as well as the use of traditional instruments, and the subsequent discussions will cover the broad range of subjects connected to contemporary musical culture. The goal is to make contemporary music less abstract for audiences by demonstrating how modern technologies can influence composers’ creativity. Discussion topics may include Knittel’s exploration of the unusual properties of the iPhone (a device he utilizes quite often in his compositions) and the laser harp, as well as methods of collective improvisation. Twardowski may share his colorful tales of the “golden years” of the Polish twentieth century avant-garde and his experiences of Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. Mr. Kościów—the youngest of the three composers—may address questions of whether or not music conveys anything, the consequences of stylistic variety and mixing genres, and whether imagination as such could be taxed.\n\nAll meetings begin at 5 p.m. at Lokal Użytkowy on Brzozowa 27/29 Street in Warsaw’s Old Town quarter. This interesting initiative is sponsored by the Cultural Office of the City of Warsaw and the ZAiKS Authors’ Society, and the Polish Music Information Centre in Warsaw is the media patron.\n\n[Source: polmic.pl]\n\nMusic & Politics Conference\n\nThe Polish Music Information Center (POLMIC) has organized the annual meeting of the International Association of Music Information Centers (IAMIC) in Warsaw and Radziejowice from September 20-25.

Scheduled in Brussels, Minsk and Kiev, the performances are conducted by the ensemble’s artistic director, Kai Bumann. Soloists for the program are violinist Agata Szymczewska and organist Zbigniew Kruczek. The first concert will be held at the Tchaikovsky National Academy of Music in Kiev on September 15.\n\nThe I Violin Concert Op. 35 by Karol Szymanowski makes up the axis of the musical performance.

Legnica, Poland, 1982) is a composer and sound-space artist. She studied composition in Wrocław, Graz, and Frankfurt under the tutelage of Krystian Kiełb, Cezary Duchnowski, Beata Furrera, Pierluigi Billone, and Gerhard Müller-Hornbach, then began her post-graduate studies under Wolfgang Rihm in 2010. Szmytka is the recipient of numerous scholarships from Polish, German, and Austrian foundations. She has taken part in master workshops conducted by Helmut Lachenmann, Mark Andre, Georg Friedrich Haas, Vinko Globokar, Mauricio Sotelo, and Tristan Murail.\n\nSzmytka’s music has been performed by contemporary music specialists including Orquesta de Radio Television Espanola, Orchestre National de Lorraine, Grup Instrumental de Valencia, Ensemble Interface, Kwartludium, Smash Ensemble, Wrocław Philharmonic Choir, Wrocław Percussion Group, Ulrich Krieger, Daniel Lorenzo, Łukasz Długosz, Anna Kwiatkowska, Elżbieta Woleńska, Małgorzata Walentynowicz, Scott Voyles, Mauricio Sotelo, Jean Deroyer, andArturo Tamayo. It has been programmed at festivals such as the Warsaw Autumn Festival, the KODY Festival (Lublin), Musica Polonica Nova and Musica Electronica Nova (Wrocław), Acanthes (Metz), ENSEMS (Valencia), Donaueschinger Musiktage (Off-Programm), Tokyo Experimental Festival, Audio Art (Kraków), Mediascapes (Graz), and the Interfering Rostrum for Electro-Acoustic Music (Lisbon). She has worked in such institutions as Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie (ZKM) Karlsruhe, Experimentalstudio des SWR Freiburg, Frankfurt-LAB, and Kunsthaus Graz. In the spring of 2011, Szmytka received the prestigious “Staubach Honoraria” award, thanks to which her new composition for Ensemble BESIDES will premiere at the Summer Courses in Darmstadt in 2012.\n\nMonika Pasiecznik of Biweekly begins her article about Szmytka’s category-defying career thus:\n\nWestern culture has developed a well-defined hierarchy of the senses in which smell, touch, taste, and hearing occupy a distant, marginal place. In contrast to sight, which is associated with thinking, hearing has never been regarded as a fully-qualified tool of cognition and philosophy, as it is in Jewish culture, for instance. The borders were demarcated on one hand by the cultural paradigm and the frame of mind it engendered, and on the other by our physiological capabilities. Our perception of reality depends, after all, on the parameters of human perception: the range of audible frequencies, the sharpness of our sight, the acuteness of our smell. Those who display special cognitive predispositions have always been treated as shamans, saints, or madmen.\n\nThe Western order of the senses is not justified by any objective state of affairs. The senses, after all, can be honed; technology itself has had a noticeable reorganizing effect on our perception, while art continues to put our senses to the test. The arbitrariness of the boundaries and our irresistible compulsion to differentiate is demonstrated by the evolution of particular artistic disciplines: in the history of aesthetics, the distinctions between painting, music, and literature have shifted time and time again.\n\nOne contemporary artist that challenges us with this problem is Jagoda Szmytka. Her intellectual, aesthetic, and sensual experiences are myriad. In her work, she employs a variety of media and material, building layered and rhizomatic semantic-aesthetic fields. She does not discern between sound and image, philosophical idea and touch. This places her among the likes of Skriabin, Schönberg, Messiaen, Stockhausen, to name but a handful of composers who displayed synesthetic predispositions. Synesthesia was unfathomable to Descartes, who established the primacy of the eye and word (writing) in Western culture. Colour, sound, touch, movement, and thought: all of these were thought to be mutually contradictory.\n\n“Sound is (for) more than the ear — it is also for the body, for the eye, and for thinking.”\n\nContinue reading this article at www.biweekly.pl.\n\n[Sources: biweekly.pl, polskamusic.pl]\n\nFitelberg Competition 2012\n\nAt a press conference on August 30 in the Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music in Katowice, the Silesian Philharmonic officially opened the call for entries for the 9th Grzegorz Fitelberg International Competition for Conductors (GFICC).

The text of “Chopin and the Vocal Nocturne” is available for free download on www.harrisonslater.com. The full text plus a 90 min. CD providing examples of the influence of vocal nocturnes (Nocturne: The Piano Music of Chopin) as performed by the author is available on www.amazon.com.\n\nFor two centuries, the piano music of Chopin has evoked vocal quality to listeners, and scholars have looked to vocal genres that may have influenced his oeuvre. The rich tradition of the vocal nocturne, lasting over a century, was first documented in Slater’s 1993 article “Mozart and the ‘Duetto Notturno’ Tradition,” written for Mozart-Jahrbuch, and is the subject of a forthcoming monograph, The Vocal Nocturne in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century. Cultivated by more than a hundred composers, the vocal nocturne tradition played an important part in the transition of Italian and French vocal music to the newly developing style of the piano.\n\nFor the first time in his newest article, a detailed list is provided of Chopin’s use of the vocal nocturne tradition in his nocturnes, and in his other piano music. The composer’s extensive use of the vocal nocturne in his oeuvre leads the author to conclude that the genre was so embedded in Chopin’s conception as to be considered a “structural element” in his compositional process.\n\n[Source: Author]\n\nŁukaszewski Around Europe\n\nPaweł Łukaszewski’s oratorio, Via crucis will receive its Lithuanian premiere on September 11, 2011 in Vilnius, Lithuania, at a concert commemorating the 10th anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center.

Tadeusz Wielecki, Director of the Festival, writes the following introduction to this year’s events:\n\nThe 54th Warsaw Autumn International Festival of Contemporary Music (16-24 September 2011) will feature music that does not focus exclusively on itself but opens to the surrounding world, commenting on it and attempting to change it. This year’s festival will predominantly feature composers who speak out on important social and political issues of the modern world.\n\nA number of documentary works will be presented. For example, our opening concert will feature Strange News for orchestra, actor and video projection by Rolf Wallin with a text by Josse De Pauw, addressing the issue of child soldiers in Africa. The text and video layer use a TV documentary shot in 2006 in Uganda and Congo. Soprano Pia Freund and the Plus Ensemble will present λελελε Lelele, a drama by Lotta Wennäkoski, with photography and video by Elina Brotherus. The text for this work is drawn from authentic testimonies of women abducted in Eastern Europe and sold in the West for prostitution. Phill Niblock’s The Movement of People Working focuses on the work of human hands, its repetitiveness and magic; this work is a concert-installation and makes uses of electronic sound space projection and videos shown on three screens. The Neue Vocalisten ensemble will perform Freizeitspektakel by Hannes Seidl and Daniel Kötter for voices, electronics and video installation, addressing the phenomenon of leisure time in modern culture. Zorka Wollny and Artur Zagajewski are setting up a street oratorio with orchestra and Warsaw residents’ choir, a sort of composed rally, a polyphony of citizens that feel ignored by social discourse. The project is co-managed by the Zachęta National Gallery of Art.\n\nRoman Berger’s Missa pro nobis for soloists, choir and orchestra shows another attitude towards reality – a dramatic refusal of barbarism and cynicism. Songs of Wars I Have Seen, a music theatre superproduction by Heiner Goebbels based on Gertrude Stein’s diaries Wars I Have Seen (1945), takes yet another position: it speaks about prosaic, everyday life in the context of war’s terrors (performed by the London Sinfonietta).\n\nAnd how will the emblematic Il canto sospeso by Luigi Nono sound in the context of engaged art? The work will be performed at our final concert, exactly half a century after its first (and only) Polish performance at Warsaw Autumn Festival 1961.\n\nOther works making use of stage and multimedia include Carola Bauckholt’s hellhörig, as well as Sandglasses, a concert-installation for four cellos, electronics and lights by young Lithuanian composer Justė Janulytė, performed by musicians enclosed in a sort of video-projected hourglasses.\n\nThe musikFabrik ensemble from Cologne will present five compositions (hitherto unknown in Poland) from the famous cycle KLANG by Karlheinz Stockhausen. Frederic Rzewski will perform a recital with his piano pieces, playing inter alia (also speaking and singing) De Profundis based on Oscar Wilde’s texts. Other first performances will include the monumental Symphony No. 1, composed in 1975 but never performed in public, by the late Andrzej Krzanowski, one of the leading composers of the Stalowa Wola period, as well as works by younger composers Agata Zubel, Paweł Hendrich and Aleksander Nowak. The opening concert will also feature the famous orchestral Scontri in homage to the recently deceased Henryk Mikołaj Górecki.\n\nThe 54th Warsaw Autumn Festival will also include a première: ‘Little Warsaw Autumn’. Encouraged by the success of last year’s installations that were visited by many children, we have planned a concert, installation and workshop for our younger listeners. ‘Little Warsaw Autumn’ is scheduled to become a permanent part of the festival.\n\nFringe events will include, among others, a conference organized by the Polish Music Information Centre, titled Music and Politics.\n\nSee the above News Section for discussions of World Premieres at Warsaw Autumn as well as the POLMIC’s Music & Politics Conference.

The formula of the Festival is based on the presentation of music exhibiting the intersection between the modern motives of sacred and profane, as well as often the intersections of geographic regions. The Festival, recommended by among others the prestigious music Gramophone magazine, enjoys the acknowledgment of critics and audiences alike.\n\nThis year’s 9th edition of the Sacrum Profanum Festival (September 11-17, Kraków) will celebrate the memory of one of Poland’s most prolific and brilliant poets with the theme “Made in Poland – Miłosz Sounds,” commemorating the centennial anniversary of his birth. In line with this theme, five Polish composers have accepted the invitation to compose pieces inspired by selected texts by Czesław Miłosz to be premiered at the Festival (see more above). Some of the outstanding ensembles and soloists set to perform this year are: Alarm Will Sound, Asko|Schönberg, Bang on a Can All-Stars, Ensemble Modern, Klangforum Wien, London Sinfonietta, pianist Leszek Możdżer, composer/pianist Steve Reich, and guitarists Adrian Utley of Portishead and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead.\n\n[Sources: culture.pl, sacrumprofanum.com]\n\nWratislavia Cantans\n\nDuring the 46th International Festival Wratislavia Cantans (September 2–17, 2011 in Wrocław, Poland), the most extraordinary of Lower Silesia’s architectural gems will resound with oratorio, symphonic, vocal and vocal-instrumental masterpieces. This year’s program is built around three different themes: Saints and Sinners, Media vita in morte sumus, and Heroes of the Bible.\n\n“Saints and Sinners” will take listeners in the Middle Ages through storytelling. Schola Wegajty Theatre will present the medieval liturgical drama Ludus Danielis. Also, singer and harpist Benjamin Bagby will adopt the role of the bard in his version of the epic Beowulf, and the vocal program “Sounds delicious: Music and feasting in medieval and early-Renaissance Europe” will be presented by the Orlando Consort.\n\nThe second and most prominent theme of the Festival is taken from a quotation from a Gregorian hymn, “Media vita in morte sumus” [In the midst of life we are in death]. This thread starts with a performance of Krzysztof Penderecki’s Symphony No. 8 Song of transience. The festival will also honor the memory of the great Polish composer who passed away in 2010—Henryk Mikołaj Górecki—with a presentation of his Symphony of Sorrowful Songs (Symphony No.3). This program will also include: Józef Świder (1930) – Miserere, Paweł Łukaszewski (1968) – Dwa motety wielkopostne: Memento mei, Domine, Crucem tuam, Marek Jasiński (1949–2010) – Cantus Finalis, and Witold Lutosławski (1913–1994) – Grave.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001 will also mark ten years since the terrible events that took place in New York. The Festival will commemorate the anniversary of the tragedy with a performance of the reflective works of Herbert Howells, Samuel Barber and Elgar by the Wrocław Festival Orchestra. This new ensemble is led by Festival Artistic Director, Paul McCreesh.\n\nThe Festival will also include a series of late night, introspective concerts featuring instrumental recitals in the most beautiful churches of Wrocław. Cellist Pieter Wispelwey will perform works by Britten, violinist Rachel Podger will present works by Bach and von Biber, and violinist Henning Kraggerud will present a program of Ysaÿe, amongst others. The Festival will also have the honor of hosting the legendary harpsichordist, Gustav Leondhardta.\n\nThe last theme—”Heroes of the Bible”—will be presented on the final weekend of the Festival with a presentation of the masterwork Elias by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. During the concert the combined forces of the Gabrieli Consort & Players and the Wrocław Philharmonic Choir will be led by Paul McCreesh.\n\nFor a full schedule, visit: wratislaviacantans.pl or polmic.pl.\n\n[Source: wratislaviacantans.pl]\n\nSinfonia Varsovia For Their City\n\nThe 11th Annual Franciszek Wybrańczyk Festival “Sinfonia Varsovia For Their City” will take place in Warsaw from September 1-11, 2010.

In addition to many works for voice and piano written in the 1940s and 50s, including children’s songs, mass songs, and popular light songs (which he composed under the pseudonym ‘Derwid’), he also wrote works that he later orchestrated, such as the Twenty Christmas Carols (1946) and Five Songs (1957), plus a setting for chorus and orchestra, Trois poèmes d’Henri Michaux (1963). This CD collects some of the works from Lutosławski’s early years as well as the three major works for voice and orchestra written after 1960: Paroles tissées (1965), Les Espaces du sommeil (1975) and Chantefleurs et Chantefables (1990).\n\nTo continue reading the entire liner notes, visit: www.adrianthomasmusic.com.

The jazzy title track with a European film noir air of mystery, one of three new studio recordings penned and produced by Basia and long-time collaborator Danny White, is the first radio single from the collection.\n\nRecorded in Łódź, Poland, From Newport To London generously offers fifteen live songs, including signature hits “Cruising For Bruising,” “New Day For You,” “Promises” and “Time And Tide.” The disc also has an acoustic version of “There’s A Tear,” a new studio recording of a track that appeared on Basia’s 2009 release, It’s That Girl Again, with an entirely new arrangement. The other new song is Wandering, a love song about traveling through lifes ups and downs and getting through them by sticking together. It is a duet between Basia and prominent Polish singer Mietek Szczeniak.\n\nUnique in voice and style, Basia’s sophisticated brand of adult pop music borrows freely from exotic sounds and diverse cultures the world over. Breezy Latin rhythms, swinging jazz grooves of yesteryears Parisian cafes, soulful American R&B, and a splash of British pop gloss provide the backdrop for Basia Trzetrzelewska and Danny White’s whimsical tales of love-struck romance, heartache and pensive poetry. Ever since her voice leapt from the recordings of British trio Matt Bianco, in which she first teamed with White, Basia quickly made a name for herself in a variety of genres. Additional information is available at www.basiasongs.com.\n\nOn tour, Basia will be backed by most of the same band that performed on the live album consisting of White (keyboards), Marc Parnell (drums), Giorgio Serci (guitar), Paul Booth (saxophone) and backing vocalists Veronique Clarisse and Annick Clarisse-Willequet.

She was the beloved wife of conductor-composer Stanisław Skrowaczewski for 55 years and a devoted mother and grandmother. Krystyna was diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) in 2006. With a brave and positive outlook, she endured this rare neurodegenerative brain disease with the devoted support of her family, caregivers, and friends.Born in Kraków, Poland on April 26, 1933, she was the daughter of Roman and Jadwiga Jarosz. Her parents provided her with the finest education. By age 6 she was already fluent in French. After surviving the Russian and German occupations of her homeland during World War II, Krystyna graduated from Jagiellonian University, Kraków, majoring in Romance languages. One of her professors and acquaintances was Karol Wojtyła, who was elected Pope John Paul II in 1978.\n\nIn 1952 she met Stanisław Skrowaczewski backstage after he conducted a concert by the Kraków Philharmonic. They met again by chance in 1956 while skiing in the Tatra Mountains, and were married that same year. Throughout their lives they shared a passion for both music and the outdoors, and Krystyna became an extraordinary gardener and cook. The young couple’s lives changed forever upon Stanisław’s appointment as music director of the then Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (today the Minnesota Orchestra) in 1960, a position he held until 1979. They lived first in Minneapolis before moving to Wayzata, where they remained for more than forty years, and where Stanisław continues to live as composer, guest conductor, and member of the community.\n\nAlong with raising their children, Krystyna was a keen administrative assistant to her husband throughout his career. She occasionally traveled the world with him, attending his concerts and the premieres of his compositions. In 2004 she accompanied him on one of his concert tours of Japan. Her unflagging support of his career was a lifelong inspiration to the distinguished conductor-composer. Gracious, warm-spirited, and perceptive, Krystyna brought a unique sense of devotion to her family and friends. She was fluent in four languages, and possessed innate artistic sensibilities along with exquisite taste. Friends knew Krystyna as an elegant hostess for numerous dinner parties. In her younger years she kept pace with Stanisław’s appetite for mountain climbing, hiking, and skiing. She also planned adventurous vacations for her family to the Grand Tetons and islands in the Caribbean.\n\nKrystyna was a lifelong animal lover and a strong supporter of the Humane Society of the United States. Her other charitable causes included the Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota, the Polish American Cultural Institute of Minnesota, and Habitat for Humanity. A woman of unlimited compassion, she was enormously generous and devoted to her family and friends. Across many decades, she sent beautiful care packages to relatives and friends in Poland and throughout the United States. Krystyna was always happiest when she was caring for or doing something for others.\n\nIn addition to her loving husband, Krystyna is survived by her daughter, Anna Skrowaczewski; her son Paul Sebastien and his wife Melissa, of Tiburon, CA; her son Nicholas Skrowaczewski, of Minneapolis, MN; granddaughters Madeleine and Mia Sebastien; her brother, Rajmund Jarosz, of Kraków; her niece, Justyna Polaczek, of Kraków; and her nephew, Bartlomiej Jarosz, of Kraków.\n\nA celebration of Krystyna’s life will be held on Saturday, September 10, 10 a.m., at St. Olaf Catholic Church, 215 South 8th Street, Minneapolis.
