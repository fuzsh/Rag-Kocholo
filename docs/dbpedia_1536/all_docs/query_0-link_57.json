To all the people of Chicago and the metropolitan area, we hope that this publication will prove interesting and informative, revealing as it does a century of social, economic, educational, religious and political contribution by the Polish people to the continuous upbuilding of Chicago. Our efforts in the historical research and study of Polish immigration to Chicago have met with an appreciable degree of cooperation and some meas- ure of success, and we are confident that a sound beginning of a valuable history is herein presented. We trust that this nucleus, and by no means an exhaustive study, of that interesting subject will prove an invitation to further research and historical interpretation of the data concerning Poles in Chicago. Furthermore, we hope that this publication shall serve as a happy source of memories regarding the celebration of Chicago's Charter Jubilee. To the end that those memories may vividly be recalled in the years to come, we respectfully submit this volume of historical reminiscences. LEOX ZGLENICKI, Chairman, Book Committee. August 8, 1937. Edward J. Kelly, Mayof> OFFICE OF THE MAYOR CITT OP CHICAGO EDWARD J. KELLY MAYOR August 4, 1957 TO THE POLISH PEOPLE OF CHICAGO: It is a genuine pleasure to extend to you my cordial greetings on the occasion of Polish Day of Chicago1 s Charter Jubilee* and to express my deep appreciation to your com- mittee for its splendid efforts toward making Polish Day an outstanding success. Cooperation of\" the kind given by your group constitutes the very foundation for the remarkable success and progress Chicago has enjoyed during its 100 years existence as a city. In addition, countless individuals of Polish birth or extraction have, all through our history, most unselfishly lent their personal, influential and financial support to make Chi- cago the great city it is today. To these civic patriots of the past, and those who carry on their fine traditions in the present day, Chicago is truly grateful. I share with you today the just pride you feel in the accomplishments of Polish blood in this great metropolitan city.

Pc Chairman; Polish Division Chicagof,s Charter Jubilee Poles of Chicago 1837—1937 PART I THE POLES IN CHICAGO By Miecislaus Haiman The patriotic •feelings of the citizens of Illinois will never fail of being emplified in practice and sincerity towards the descendants of those he,v, who spent their blood and treasure in establishing our independence ex- eroes THESE were the words in which a committee of eminent citizens of Chi- cago appealed to their \"Fellow Citizens of the State of Illinois\" on be- half of the Polish exiles, who came to the city in the autumn of 1834 with plans of founding a \"New Poland\" in this state. The exiles were delegates of two hundred thirty-five Polish officers and soldiers deported to the United States by the Austrian government after the ■fated \"November Insurrection\" of 1830-1. The Congress of the United States voted to grant them a whole township of land in Michigan or Illinois. The exiles encouraged by the most friendly expressions of Illinoisans decided on the latter state. Plans for establishing a purely Polish colony in Illinois came to naught. Many technical difficulties intervened, but above all the Poles were too poor for the undertaking. This episode is the beginning of the history of the Poles in Chicago. One of the Polish emmissaries who resided here for some time in 1834, was Major Louis Chlopicki, nephew of Gen. John Chlopicki, hero of the Napo- leonic wars and the dictator of the \"November Insurrection.\" Ever since 1834 Poles were present among the inhabitants of Chicago. Driven from their native country by foreign oppression, many of them fought on various battlefields of Europe \"for our freedom and yours,\" until they found in this country the refuge and liberty which they vainly sought in Page 2 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 other parts of the world. Many others came to America on account of econ- omical reasons, being deprived of the means of livelihood in their motherland by hostile governments. The rapidly growing city of Chicago attracted many of them. In the first mayoralty election of the city in 1837, two Poles cast their votes : A. Panakaske of the Second Ward, and J. Zoliski of the Sixth Ward, both of them for William B. Ogden. After 1850, the Polish colony in Chicago began to grow rapidly. In 1852, Dr. Jacob Cert, the first physician from Poland, settled in the city. Another early Polish physician was Dr. Edward Hartwich (Harwitch) who resided here since 1856. The earliest leader of the Chicago Polish colony was Edward Wilkoszewski, (b. 1824, d. 1883), adjutant of Garibaldi in his early struggles for the liberation of Italy. At the time of the Civil war there were already about five hundred Poles in the city. They stood patriotically by their country during this crisis. About two hundred Poles from Illinois, many of them from Chicago, served in the ranks of the Union army. The 24th Illinois Volunteer Infantry and in the 16th Cavalry Regiments especially, contained large numbers of Poles. Captain Bernard F. Stampoffski, veteran of the Mexican war and \"an old and widely known citizen of Chicago,\" organized Company F of the Ninth Illi- nois Cavalry. Edmund T. Hulanicki of Chicago rose from a private to the rank of Captain in the Twelfth United States Heavy Artillery, and his broth- er, Captain Thaddeus C. Hulanicki, commanded Battery L of the Second Il- linois Light Artillery. A very fine record was made by Captain Peter Kiolbassa (b. 1837, d. 1905) of the Sixth Colored Cavalry. While yet a boy he was one of the pioneers of the Polish peasant colonies! in Texas. At the beginnig of the Civil war he served in the Confederate army. Taken prisoner in one of the battles, he en- listed with the Union army and rose to the rank of captain. After the war he became a recognized leader of the Chicago Poles. It was he who helped to organized the first local Polish Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka in 1864, thus giving the Polish colony the beginning of organized life. The memorable fire of 1871 brought comparatively small losses to the Po- lish colony. The Rev. Jerome Kajsiewicz, C.R. (b. 1812, d. 1873) who was visiting the city at that time, left a vivid account of the fire. It is given here for the first time in the English language and differs somewhat in detail from other known accounts : \"Geese saved Rome, but a cow destroyed Chicago. A Bohemian boy was milking a cow in a barn full of woodchips. The cow overturned a lamp and the chips became ignited. The wooden houses of the Bohemians burnt quick- ly. The wind changed at 9:30 p. m. and swept the flames toward the river, then drove them over the river toward the rich section of the city, situated between the two branches of the river and the lake. Had the wind not 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO ~ 1917 Pase 3 changed, the whole wooden part of the city and the whole Polish colony would have been destroyed. Large stone edifices, like the courthouse, and the post oitice burned as if made of wood. Spirits, oil and other combustibles ignited. From the tower of our church (St. Stanislaus) I saw the fire like ocean waves surge high and then spread to the right and left. Whole blocks of houses were blown up by mines to arrest the onward rush of this flaming sea, but to no avail. The wind set fire to houses several blocks ahead. Many thought that the whole world was in flames. Some from terror, others through despair at their loss of all their possessions, jumped into the 'river or lake. The bridges caught fire and were opened in an effort to save them People crowded into the river tunnels in the dark (the gas supply was shut off). Wagons and people moved about in confusion. They formed a crying shrieking and cursing mass, wounding and trampling one another Thieves and pickpockets added to the chaos. Professional robbers from New York and other cities hastened by train in the hope of finding easy loot. When the pri- son caught fire, all inmates were released. Thieves masked as policemen and others acted as incendiaries. Several of them were hanged by citizens on lamp posts. The Chief of Police sanctioned this by printed announcements and Gen. Sheridan, who arrived later with troops from St. Louis, proclaimed martial law. As to our Poles from among nine members of the \"Gmina \" five were burned, Mr. Dziewior, father-in-law of Mr. Kiolbassa lost fiv~ houses; a number of Polish laborers also suffered losses. For some time they were housed in the Polish school and in the basement of the church. Air Ma- jewski, an emigrant of 1830, lost two children and three grandchildren- another Pole from Warsaw, two children. The Princes Sapieha, bankers' came through without a loss; the fire stopped several houses from their dwelling. One hundred thousand people, mostly Germans and Scandinavians on the North Side, lost their homes. The fire raged throughout an area four and a half miles long and a half mile wide. Eighteen thousand buildings among them 15,000 business houses, were destroyed. Losses were estimated at $300,000,000.\" • Period from 1837 to 1872 ; Nevertheless, the indomitable spirit of I WILL pervaded all the citizens in their efforts to rebuild their stricken metropolis. The Polish element aided in these efforts in a very effective manner, rebuilding homes, erecting new ichurches, schools, stores and factories. The Poles are mostly Catholics and their desire to be served by their own priests was profound as early as the Civil war. The result of their efforts in this direction was the organization of the first Polish parish, the beautiful St. Stanislaus Kostka church, at Noble and Bradley streets, in 1867. The first rector of the parish was Rev. Joseph Juszkiewicz, but the greatest Page 4 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 expansion look place during the pastorate of Rev. Vincent Barzynski, C.R. (1838 — 1899). Under his leadership the parish grew into the largest Catholic parish in the world, and at one time it numbered approximately fifty differ- ent church societies, some of which contained as many as four thousand members. By 1899 St. Stanislaus parish alone numbered 50,000 members. In 1872, the second Polish parish, Holy Trinity, at Noble and Chapin streets, was founded, and from that time Polish Catholic parishes grew rap- idly in numbers, until at present there are forty-four within the city limits, besides religious communities of other denominations. The territory of these early parishes, St. Stanislaus Kostka and Holy Trinity, was the cradle of the Polish colony in Chicago, and although Poles now live in all parts of the city, it still remains the center of Polish life. Period from 1875 to 1937 The political events and economic depressions in Europe in the last thirty years of the nineteenth century led to the influx of large numbers of immi- grants to our shores. The policy of Bismarck to exterminate the Polish element in Prussia; the various ukases of the czar of Russia; and the policy of indolence of Au- stria toward their Polish subjects caused a large number of the Polish people to emigrate to the United States. According to official statistics for 1873, there were 20,000 Poles in Chicago. Seventeen years later, Chicago had 52,756, but many Poles were classified then as Germans, Russians and Austrians, since Poland did not exist as a separate political entity. With the increased number of Poles in Chicago their activity, in various fields of civic life became more manifest and effective. In 1872, the first Polish weekly, the \"Gazeta Polska,\" published by Wla- dyslaw Dyniewicz (b. 1843, d. about 1924), appeared in Chicago. John Ba- rzynski (1848—1886), brother of the Reverend Vincent, began publication of another weekly, the ''Gazeta Polska Katolicka,\" in 1874. Still another pioneer of the Polish press was Wladyslaw Smulski (1836—1897), with his \"Gazeta Katolicka\" and \"Dzien Swiety.\" In 1890, Father Barzynski founded the Chicago Polish Daily News (\"Dziennik Chicagoski\"), which has existed to this day and is the second oldest Polish daily in America. There are two other Polish dailies in Chi- cago : the \"Dziennik Zwiazkowy\" of the Polish National Alliance and \"Dzien- nik Zjednoczenia\" of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. Apart from these, many weeklies and monthly periodicals are published here. Among the pioneer editors who won prominence we find Stanislaus Szwajkart (1857- 1918); Casimir Neuman (1843—1907), a commissioned officer of the Polish army in the insurrection of 1863; Stanislaw Osada (1869 — 1934). ±8y7_-riP_QLES_pj CHICAGO — 1 93 7 Pave J Educational and Welfare Institutions Father Barzynski was responsible for another institution, St. Stanislaus' College, founded in 1891 and now known as Weber High School-the first Polish secondary school in the city. Besides the parochial schools in each of the parishes, there are now six high schools of various religious orders whose indefatigable labors have contributed so much to the advancement of the Polish element in Chicago. The oldest Polish hospital in the city, St. Mary's of Nazareth, founded in 1894 and conducted by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. St. Joseph's Home for the Aged was established in 1898 by the Polish Fran- ciscan Sisters of St. Kunegunda. St. Hedwig's Orphanage at Niles 111. was founded in 1910 by the Most Rev. Paul P. Rhode, bishop of Green Bay, Wis., then auxiliary bishop of Chicago. Consecrated in 1908, he was the first Ro- man Catholic bishop of Polish origin in the United States. • Taking Part in Politics To Peter Kiolbassa belongs the honor of having been the first Po1e to suc- ceed in local politics. He was elected to the Illinois legislature in 1877 and subsequently held many offices. An inspiring proof of his sterling honesty was the fact that he was the first city treasurer (1891-93) to return the in- terest on city funds to the treasury, which was contrary to the old practice of keeping it for private use while in office. Following the lead of Peter Kiolbassa, the Chicago Poles took an ever growing interest in politics. Victor Karlowski, veteran of the Polish insur- rection of 1863 and of the French Foreign Legion in Algiers, was called to the legislature in 1885-6. August J. Kowalski was the first alderman in 1888. Max A. Drezmal. translator of several works by Sienkiewicz, was the first to be appointed to the board of education in 1894. Edmund Z. Brodowski (1852-1901), editor of the local weekly \"Zgoda,\" was the first Pole to re- ceive a federal appointment as United States consul to Solingen, Germany, in 1897, a post he held until his death. The first to attain a judiciary bench was Joseph La Buy (1846-1916), a veteran of the Civil war, who was elected muncipal judge in 1912. Stanley H. Kunz was the first Chicago Pole to be elected to the state senate and to Congress. Many others rendered faithful service in the various posts in the city, state and federal administra- tions. The first commanding figure among early Poles engaged in politics was John F. Smulski (1867-1928), a born leader, lawyer and banker, the first to be elected (1903) to the office of city attorney. In 1906, he was elected state treasurer and like Kiolbassa, proved his exceptional honesty by turning over the interest money to the state. Page 6 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 Chicago — the Home of Nation-wide Organizations Because of its large Polish population and its central location, Chicago early became the home of the most important Polish organizations, espe- cially of nation-wide fraternal corporations. The oldest of these is the Polish Roman Catholic Union, founded in 1873, now numbering 170,000 members. The Polish National Alliance, the largest Polish organization in the world and one of the largest fraternal incorporations in the country, boasts a mem- bership of nearly 300,000. The Polish Women's Alliance, founded by Steph- anie Chmielinska in 1898, has over 60,000 members. The Polish Alma Ma- ter, of which Rev. Francis Gordon was founder, has a membership of 15,000. The Polish Singers' Alliance, the Alliance of Polish Literary and Dramatic Circles, have their headquarters in Chicago, where you will find 1931 other associations— benevolent, cultural, professional, civic, social and athletic. • Some Interesting Statistics In 1918, the population numbered 383,000 Poles, 29,630 of whom owned their own homes, valued at $335,000,000; 35,909 children were enrolled in the parochial schools of 38 Polish parishes with a property valuation of $10,383,000; and 4,098 Polish business establishments were listed. In 1928, the number of Poles rose to 424,735, with 33.767 owning their own homes, valued at $389,955,000; 52,221 children were enrolled in the schools of Polish parishes, increased to 41, with a property valuation of $24,560,000; and the value of Polish business property was listed at approxi- mately $29,000,000. According to the latest statistics, there are now over half a million people of Polish descent in Chicago, forming one of the largest nationalistic group in the city. For that reason Chicago is sometimes called the \"capital\" of Ameri- can Poles. The large nation-wide organizations, with their home offices in Chicago, exert a strong influence on Polish life in America, through their leadership in cultural and patriotic activities. Nearlv all Polish undertakings of consequence in this country either orig- inate in' or are directed from Chicago. Casimir Zychlinski (1859-1927), who for nearly two decades held the office of president of the Polish National Alliance;' Theodore Helinski (1854-1921), also an official of the Alliance; Nicodemus L. Piotrowski (1863-1932), also president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union and at one time city attorney, Bishop Rhode and John F. Smulski, were all recognized as Polish American leaders of national and, as in the case of Smulski, of international repute. The Poles saw in every war a possibility of freeing their native land from the oppressor. Their strong belief that the late World war would bring about a renascent Poland, is one of the reasons of their enthusiastic support of the j 83 7 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 page 7 United States government. The part played by them in the World war is thus described by Ignace Jan Paderswski, a genius of international fame : \"No other nationality here in the United States has taken so active a part in the Red Cross campaign as the Poles. In proportion to their numbers they have been the largest contributors to this worthy cause. In one American city of 300,000 population $3,750,000 has been collected for the American Red Cross, which represents $12.50 per capita, which included a number of Amer'can miTionaires. The Polish population of the same city, 7.000 people, a'mcst exlusively belonging to the laboring class, contributed to the fund $160,000. which makes $23 per person. \"From reliable sources it appears that in one mining district in Pennsyl- vania alone the poor Polish miners have subscribed $11,000,000 to the Third Liberty Lean. One single Polish bank in Chicago received over 15,000 Polish subscriptions exceeding $1,500,000. In every large city in America with Po- lish population the number of Polish subscribers has been very large, not- withstanding the fact that the number of Polish subscribers working' with large American concerns could not be taken into account. • Chicago Poles in World War \"The Polish boys were the first and most numerous to respond when the call to arms was sounded. Their willingness to enlist and fight under the American flag won repeated praise from the highest military authorities in this country. There is not one casualty list that does not contain some names of American soldiers of Polish birth who paid the supreme sacrifice on the battlefields of France. The average number killed exceeded twelve percent. And as there are not quite four percent of Polish people among the population of the United States this fact indicates that the Poles in that war were doing more than three times their share, that they were not one-hun- dred, but three-hundred percent American.\" The first Chicago boy killed in this war was a Pole, Peter Wojtalewicz of Company G, Eighteenth Infantry. His memory was honored by a special resolution of the city council. Two Polish boys one from Chicago, the other from Milwaukee, captured the first German prisoner taken by the American Army in France. Altogether about ten thousand Poles from Chicago served under the American flag on the battlefields of the World war. Ihe Polish National Committee, with headquarters in Chicago, under the leadership of Ignace J. Paderewski, John F. Smulski and Bishop Rhode, enlisted nearly all the American Poles in the cause of democracy. This Com- mittee formed the central body of Polish organizations throughout the coun- try, coordinating all Polish war activities. Besides doing their duty toward America in a \"three hundred percent\" way, the Committee also helped to or- ganize the Polish Army in France, the purpose of which was to fight for the Page 8 J 837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 • freedom of Poland. About 25,000 American Poles, among them approxi- mately 3,000 Polish volunteers from Chicago, served in this army. Millions of dollars in cash and materials were collected by the Committee for the re- habilitation of Poland. • Cultural Contributions The Polish element in Chicago contributed richly to the artistic advance- ment of our city. The earliest local Polish musician was probably Sylwester Lawinski, a very fine violinist, who opened a music store on State street, near 12th St., about 1866, and conducted it for many years. Another dis- tinguished Polish musician was Count Napoleon Ledochowski, pianist and painter, who settled here in 1870, and opened a Conservatory of Music. Among other Polish artists were Anthony Mallek (b. 1861, d. 1917), an able organist and composer, Agnes Nering (b. 1876, d. 1922) who won well de- served fame as a singer; and Thaddeus Zukotynski, an early Polish painter (b. ab. 1860, d. ab. 1910), pupil of the renowned Matejko. His beautiful murals and pictures still adorn many Polish churches in Chicago and vicinity. Sister Mary Stanisia of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, a contemporary Polish American artist, was a pupil of Zukotynski. Casimir Chodzinski (b. 1861, d. 1919) was the sculptor of Kosciuszko's monument in Chicago and of Pulaski's in Washington, D. C. Felicia Benda Modjeska (b. ab. 1870, d. 1936), was also a very fine Polish sculptress. The first Polish drama was performed in the city in 1873 by the \"Gmina Polska,\" the second oldest Polish local society. The first book by a Polish author to be published in Chicago was \"Poets and Poetry of Poland\" by Paul Sobolewski (b. 1818, d. 1884), veteran of the Polish Revolution of 1831. This work, printed by Knight and Leonard and published for the first time in 1881, went through several editions and is still quite popular. Other local Polish writers wrote for the most part in Polish. Among them, Szczesny Zahajkiewicz (b. 1861, d. 1917), a highly talented poet, deserves special mention. Dr. Anna Wyczolkowska (b. 1870, d. 1929) published several works in the fields of psychology, both in Polish and English. She was also a talented musician. Several Polish free public libraries are maintained by various organizations. The largest, supported by the Polish National Alliance, contains about 20,000 volumes ; The Polish Roman Catholic Union, besides a library of 7,000 volumes, maintains the Polish Archives and Museum, initiated by its President Joseph L. Kania, in 1935. This institution houses a large collection of material pertaining to the history of Poles in the United States. The Poles also contributed talent from beyond Chicago to ennoble the life of the city. In 1876, Henryk Sienkiewicz, the famous author of \"Quo Vadis,\" visited the city. In his \"Listy z Podrozy,\" (Letters of Travel) he left a very • 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 Page 9 enthusiastic, though brief, description of the city, then just rising from the ashes of the great fire. In 1878, Helena Modjeska (b. 1840, d. 1909), the great Shakespearean actress, performeed for the first time in Chicago, and was de- lighted with the city. \"It was wonderful to hear Modjeska play,\" says Edgar Lee Masters in his reminiscences. Probably the first Polish traveling musi- cian to give a concert in the city was Henry Wieniawski (b. 1835, d. 1880), the famous violinist, who visited Chicago in 1872. Madame Marcella Sem- brich-Kochanska, brilliant opera singer, made her Chicago debut at the Au- ditorium about 1890 with great success. Ignace Jan Paderewski played here for the first time in 1891. He said at the time: \"As to the cities of the Great West, Chicago is perhaps the most sensitively responsive to the charm of music.\" The famous singers, Jean and Edouard de Reszke, performed in a series of operas that same year. To them, according to Clara Leiser, their biographer, belongs the honor of inaugurating \"The Golden Age of Music\" in Chicago. In the last several decades other Polish musicians and singers have won acclaim and among Chicago contemporaries, there are many highly talented artists of Polish origin. This brief skeach on the Poles in Chicago is best summarized by the fol- lowing excerpts from one of the appeals issued recently by the Polish Com- mittee of the Chicago Centenary Day celebration, appointed by the Hon. Ed- ward J. Kelly, Mayor. \"We, Poles, have played an important part in the life and growth of Chi- cago. We comprise the largest foreign nationality group here, and are splendidly organized. We maintain the greatest number of schools and churches of our own. We have a prominent place in business, politics and science. We have talented artists, excellent choirs, our own press and our organizations. \"A very great part of Chicago was built by the Polish people. Numerous machines and implements, which are produced in the factories of Chicago, are the output of Polish workmen. There probably is not one public affair in which the Poles do not participate according to their ability. We are fulfledged and well deserving citizens of Chicago, entitled to all the privileges of citizenship.\" Bibliography A. T. Andreas, History of Chicago, Chicago, 1886, 4 vols. ; Fremont O.

PART II HUNDRED YEARS OF ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION OF THE POLES TO CHICAGO S PROGRESS By Thaddeus J. Lubera THE scope of this topic presents, in view of limited time allowed, a dif- ficult if not too arduous an assignment. The research and evaluation of primary and secondary sources, scarce and limited as they may be, require at least two years of consistent and perseverant study — not a month or two. In view of these facts, the author presents a brief, perhaps too limited, a study of the economic contributions of the Americans of Polish antecedent to the growth of Chicago. Period from 1837 to 1865 During the early stages of Polish immigration in Chicago, the Poles con- stituted chiefly an army of political exiles and workers seeking employment and settlement wherever it could be found. Their qualifications for business and industry consisted of good intentions, hard work, and vision, but lack- ing in capital and knowledge of language they met with handicaps in their efforts. Nevertheless, their success was apparent. Of course, the first thing they had to do was to get a firm footing in their new land, also establish homes, and accumulate surplus capital. Beginning cautiously, they started to use their working capital first in small enterprise and gradually expanded as they accumulated sufficient capital. During this period, we find Louis Karlinski, established in tobacco and cigar business at Lake and Dearborn Streets ; Henry Leibka, a chair maker, at Division and Branch street; Charles\" Krosowski, saddle and leather busi- ness, at 39 North La Salle St., and Ferdinand Lubicki, a mason contractor, located on Wells and Van Buren Streets. By degrees, the Poles expanded commercially. Between the years of 1846 and 1857, there were twenty-one business ventures in Polish hands. These ranged from cabinet works to confectioners, including lithography, clothing, shoe stores, picture frames and consulting engineering. Page 12 / 83 7 — POLKS OF CHICAGO— 7937 The most active person in the economic development of Poles in Chicago in the years 1846 to the Civil War, was a land agent, Captain Bernard Stem- poffski, whose office was located at 73 W. Randolph Street. His effective guidance and advice in land values proved to be a source of aid to people who sought business counsel. Early Professional Endeavors During the first twenty to thirty years of the early Polish settlement in Chicago, there was a great scarcity of Polish professional men. The Polish immigrant in need of professional services had to resort to physicians and lawyers of other nationalities. This state of things was inevitable. Given necessary time, the Polish population gradually developed a class of business and professional men, brought up in our American atmosphere and trained in American institutions, wide awake, energetic and increasingly efficient, with qualities for service and leadership. Among the first were : Dr. Jacob Cerf, who settled in this city in 1852, followed by Dr. Edward Hartwich, who had lived in Chicago since 1856. Among other distinguished profes- sional men were : Count Napoleon Ledochowski, pianist, who settled here in 1870 and founded a conservatory of music, also Sylvester Lewinsky a very fine violinist, who opened a music store in 1866, on State near 12th Street and conducted it for many years, and Alexander Fenesewski, consulting en- gineer, with offices at 238 N. Clark Street. Period from 1870 to 1900 During this period conditions in Europe were becoming acutely intolerable for the Poles. There were economic, social, religious and political persecu- tions. In view of these conditions, thousands of Poles emigrated to the United States. The city of Chicago, a growing} metropolis, welcomed many of them. Thus bv 1873, there were 20,000 Poles in Chicago. These new immigrants were industrious and a very thrifty class of people. In their homeland, the Polish peasant's supreme ambition is to own a piece of land. When he comes to America, he brings that supreme ambition with him. He works, denies himself, and saves, in order that he may some day have a home of his own, and a patch of ground around that home. Conse- quently, the Poles are essentially home owners. By 1887, according to the Chicago Tribune survey at that time, the Poles in Chicago owned real estate valued at ten million dollars. Among the most prominent business ventures during this period were : Anton Klimek's Furniture Store, at 631 Noble St., Francis Paszkiewicz's General Store at 630 Noble St., coal business owned by Messrs. A. P. Behnke and Paul Drymalski, at North Avenue and Coventry Street, W. Szvmanski, • 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO-- 1937 Page 13 general store established in 1877, a clothing store owned by F. Nowaczewski, located at 289 12th Street, near Halsted, Kaminski's shoe store, established in 1876, at 491 Milwaukee Ave., Bardonski's drug store, at 638 Noble St., Mikitynski and Anton gowinski furniture stores and others, too numerous to mention. All in all, the Poles in Chicago possessed ninety-three large busi- ness enterprises between the years of 1873 and 1895. These numerous stores operated by the Poles covered practically every branch of business, and some of the enterprises rivaled in variety, quantity, quality of stock and prices, some of the better known downtown stores. As time went on, a larger number would leave their factory jobs and go into business for themselves. Among the many who ventured into business endeavors were: Casimir Fritsch, undertaker, J. P. Kwiatkowski, house mover, August Kunkel, A. Sherman and others. The oldest Polish industry in Chicago is the clothing industry. It dates back to the Civil War when D. Wilkowski established the first clothing factory at 155 W. Lake Street. The cause of the rise is evidently to be looked for in the large demand for clothing at that time, as during the World War, and in the resulting high wages and big profits. Next in point of time, en- gaging the business attention of Poles is building and house moving, followed by brewing, the manufacturing of cigars, baking and meat marketing; in more recent years, groceries, meat markets, dram shops, photography, dairy business, furniture, haberdashery and women's clothing, the latter only to a small extent, up to 1900. As Polish business opportunities increased, so Po- lish population has been greatly stimulated and has taken big strides for- ward. • The Parish was an Aid to Business During this middle period, from 1865 to 1900, the Poles began to organize around their parishes and fraternal organizations. This fact had a significant economic effect. By 1867, the first Polish parish was established, Saint Stanislaus Kostka Church, at Noble and Bradley Streets. Obviously, then, the population shifted and became concentrated about the parish and for this reason, many of the early business establishments were located in the vicinity of the intersection of Milwaukee Avenue and West Division Street. In 1872, the second Polish parish, Holy Trinity, was founded, and, consequently, urgent demands for real estate and other branches of economic needs of the community were in evidence. With the development of parishes, there were established educational, charitable] and social institutions. These required a heavy outlay of money. Among the foremost were : Saint Stanislaus College, founded in 1891 ; Holy Family Academy for girls, founded in 1887 ; Saint Mary of Nazareth Hospital in 1894 and the Saint Joseph's Home for the p*ge I4 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO — 1937 Aged in 1898. These were founded without any endowment, and from, the very start, were and are yet self-sustaining. Because of the increasingly large Polish population and its geographical location, Chicago during this middle period became the home of the most important Polish national and religious organizations. In 1873, the Polish Roman Catholic Union was founded, followed by the Polish National Al- liance in 1880, and the Polish Women's Alliance in 1898. Polish Felcons, the Polish Alma Mater and the Polish Businessmen's Association and others followed. This rapid economic expansion of the Polish element between 1870 and 1900, was temporarily halted by three depressions from which effects the entire country suffered, particularly the one in 1893. In predominant number, the Polish business man operated with a small capital and too frequently served only the local community trade, depending in large measure upon his people. The depressions caused a fall in trade due to lay-offs in the factories; hence, in some respects, business retrogressed and in a few instances failed. The Press Helps Business With the increasingly rapid growth of Polish population in Chicago the need for Polish newspapers became apparent. And in 1872, a weekly, the \"Gazeta Polska\" appeared in Chicago, followed by \"Gazeta Polska Katolic- ka,\" in 1874. In 1890, Rev. V. Barzynski founded \"Dziennik Chicagoski,\" others followed, \"Dziennik Narodowy,\" \"Dziennik Zwiazkowy,\" \"Dziennik Ludowy\" and \"Dziennik Zjednoczenia,\" all dailies, as well as several week- lies. These newspapers have made a significant contribution to the economic development among the Poles in Chicago. They have served richly by their editorial policies dealing with business; by their advertisements of trade, indi- cating values, locations of stores and guidance incident to business. These newspapers were of immense value to the purchaser, the buyer and the in- vestor, creating confidence, \"business sense\" and progress. Period from 1900 to 1918 With the opening of the 20th Century economic conditions in the United States were progressing slowly but steadily. The Spanish-American War gave business some impetus, but the series of strikes and the various tariff policies were factors which caused uncertainties in the commercial world. The Polish business, industrial and commercial enterprises had, during the early period of the century, adjusted themselves easily to the trend of the • 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1 937 Page IS times, due to the conservative business characteristics which mark the Polish people. However, because of the large immigration to Chicago and the high birth- rate, the Polish population increased by large numbers. In 1918, it numbered 383,000 in Chicago. This large group organized in thirty-eight parishes, with 35,909 children in the parochial schools, and church property valued at $10,363,000, was an important factor in the city's growth. Significant of no- tice is the fact that by 1918 there were 4,096 Polish business industrial and commercial enterprises. Then, too, 26,630 Poles owned their homes, whose total value amounted to $335,000,000. In taxes alone on this property, the Po- lish people made a heavy contribution to Chicago's development. During the war, this national group, citizens and loyal supporters of Chi- cago's progressive plans, subscribed in huge number to Liberty Bonds, War Saving Stamps, Municipal and State Bonds. Their savings accounts and real estate investments ran well up in millions of dollars. Interesting to note is the fact that the young people of the Polish element developed at this time consciousness for economic progress. The result of this attitude was the large enrollment in high schools, academies, colleges, evening schools and universities in the commercial and professional courses. They sought advancement in the commercial world, primarily on their merit, knowledge of business principles and organization. Out of this zeal and in- terest there developed a number of large Polish commercial enterprises, such as wholesale meats, carpet manufacturing, flour mills, cartage contracting, building contracting, coal companies, automobile sales, laundry business, wholesale groceries and breweries. As a result of high wages during the World War and consequent greater accumulations of surplus capital as well as allurement of great business profits, the ten years from 1919 to 1929, witnessed a tremendous develop- ment of Polish business in Chicago. According to the statistics of 1928, the number of Poles rose to 424,725 ; there were forty-one Polish parishes and 52,221 children in parochial schools; the value of parochial buildings was $24,655,000; also significant of notice is the fact, that 33,767 Poles owned homes in Chicago, valued at $389,955,000; the value of Polish stores and factories was approximately $29,000,000. Moreover, the professional ranks among the Polish citizens of Chicago rose to 394; the local lodges numbered 1391 with assets over $200,000,000 in in- surance and cash. The Building and Loan Associations which were a great contributing fac- tor in the economic development of the Polish element in Chicago numbered 115. These organizations loaned money to home investors and presented an opportunity, by nature of their plan, to thousands of citizens to save syste- matically each week, eventually making possible ownership of a home. These savings, in 1928, amounted to $366,720,000. Page 16 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 The number of Poles employed in the various commercial enterprises numbered 30,943 distributed in the following manner as indicated by the accompanying tables : POLISH TRADE AND COMMERCE IN CHICAGO (Statistics by St. Osada— P.

In reference to the chain stores, there is one firm of 45 stores, the Novak Meat Markets, operating annuallv with a capital of $150,000.00. Needless to say that during the depression of 1930 to 1934, these enter- prises had decreased in value and in number of employed. However, with the coming of the normal business cycle, they undoubtedly are showing a turn for the better and are \"holding their own.\" The following table indicates another type of business establishments in 1928 (figures in close approximation) : • 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 Page 17 COMMERCIAL TRADE ENTERPRISES Table Two Kinds No. No. Employed Value Bakeries 500 1000 $400,000 Restaurants 150 1000 120 000 Tailor shops 1000 2750 350,000 Shoe repairs 750 1000 750^000 Painting contractors 150 500 Beauty parlors 1000 2000 500,000 Photographers 50 50 50000 Undertakers 250 600 1,750,000 Real estate offices 1000 3000 Total 4850 11,900 3,900,000 The tables indicates no value for painting contractors or real estate offices because of the relative flexibility of values involved. The data also indicate a large number of beauty parlors, all of which are operated by Polish men and women who previously were engaged in other establishments or worked days and studied evenings in recognized beauty culture schools. These young people left their factory and office jobs, and with small capital and desire to render satisfactory service, are successful in their venture. In the process of economic investments, the Poles having learned many sound business practices by experience and competition, decided to inau- gurate a policy of business expansion. This resulted in wholesale and co- operative trade policies, the number of which is indicated by the following table: FACTORIES, WHOLESALE AND COOPERATIVE Table Three Kinds No. No. Employed Value Miscellaneous 55 850 $2,845,000 Automobile trade 20 250 Printin£ - 75 250 1,200,000 Miscellaneous wholesale 10 300 1 100 000 Wholesale lumber 2 50 750 000 Wholesale coal 4 150 l,5(X)!oOO Laundries 3 150 WoOO Milk dairies 6 400 1,000,000 Casket manufacturing 2 100 500^000 Cooperatives 5 72 510,000 Corporations 1 70 50^000 Total 182 2642 9,950,000 s Page 18 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 The cooperatives are partnerships based on common stock of shares bought by individuals. The five indicated by the table represent two clothing manu- facturing; two cleaners and dyers and one wholesale bakery, the Polish Grocers Baking Company. Other cooperatives are represented by the Illinois Cleaners and Dyers and Liberty Clothing Company. The corporation is rep- resented by the Chicago Cleaners and Dyers, a fast growing corporation. Items under miscellaneous and miscellaneous wholesale include all business not specifically mentioned. Decline of Values and Further Progress The so-called boom times from 1925 to December 1929, caused exagge- rated values to be placed on all economic goods. In the foregoing tables, in- dicating Polish industry in Chicago, the then current worth was estimated as per index of 1928. This index is no longer in operation, and in a'l proba- bility never again shall be used to gauge the value of economic goods. Living in a progressive metropolis such as Chicago, the Polish business and investing element were inspired by the spirit of time, and equally with their neighbors, found the stocks, mortgage and gold bond investments a lucrative field. But upon the crash of these and the closing of banks, the values of all investments declined swiftly. The orgy of foreclosures on homes and widespread unemployment brought financial plight to thousands of citi- zens, many losing their homes, savings and investments. It is difficult to ascertain the total losses by the Polish element, since no data are available at the present time. Nevertheless, with the indominable spirit of \"I WILL\" which so nobly characterizes Chicago, the Polish element as well as other citizens have faced the issues clearly and nobly. And with the aid of our splendid President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose humanitarian interests resulted in HOLC and other security laws pertaining to homes, investments and savings, many thousands of homes and millions of dollars have been saved. In no small measure, our Mayor, Edward Kelly, deserves credit in making Chicago the splendid city that it is. His vision and interest in the welfare of all citizens and his efforts in placing the city on a sound finnacial basis, again presents, and perhaps more widely, the opportunity for the citizens of Chi- cago of the Polish ancestry to have another hundred years of unsurpassed economic development. The hundred years of economic growth of Chicago's citizens of Polish de- scent has been unequalled in the history of any other city in the world. Une- qualled in the sense that from a group of political exiles in 1834, who sought refuge in Chicago and other settlements in Illinois, there developed in a hun- dred years a potent social and economic force of over a half-million in num- ber. 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO —1937 Pagel9 The rise from ninety-three enterprises in 1865, to 15,277 in 1928, em- ploying 30,757 people and valued at $29,575,000, represents Herculean effort, self-sacrifice and high intelligence— all this in spite of language, financial and other handicaps. The various Polish fraternal, loan savings organizations, the press, the home ownership, commercial and business enterprises and other assets, per- sonal and real in possession of the citizens of Polish antecedents in' Chi- cago, represent a value of over a half billion dollars. However, material things, though necessary in economic existence, do not compare with the moral and social values which the large number of Polish parishes, priests, nuns, societies, professional, humanitarian, educational, civic and welfare organizations represent. They are beacons of moral support, which, in the final analysis, represent the worth of any nation. Ostensibly then, the Poles are exceedingly proud of their social and economic contribution to the growth of this great metropolis of the Middle West, and pledge continued support of progressive civic and commercial projects in making Chicago the best city in the world in which to live, the best city in which to rear and educate children and the best city in which to make future investments. PART III THE RISE OF POLES IN AMERICAN POLITICS By Robert F. Lessel IN the eighties and nineties thousands came attracted to Chicago to seek better opportunity, to avoid the repressions of the Old World, to breathe the \"air of the free,\" to grow, expand, unhampered by oppressive bureaucratic control. The immigrants worked hard. You found them in the foundries, railroad yards, steel mills, mines, tanneries and stock yards. This was a new country, expanding in all directions. It called for brain and brawn. Chicago was developing into the greatest railroad, wheat and meat center, into the most rapidly growing metropolis of the world. The Queen City-by-the-Lake was attracting thousands of people, who were willing to work hard, to lend their shoulder to the wheel of America's rap- idly growing industries. The climate suited the immigrant, for it was the same he had enjoyed in the old country. Times were hard in the nineties, but the air was permeated with the spirit of hope, filled with expectations of great things to come. And great things did come. Chicago put up the first skyscraper in the world. Its inventive genius, the greatest of the age, made factories hum; its farming implements, machines, meat products, its grain, were shipped to the four corners of the earth. Chicago became known throughout the world, be- cause it had the energy to create, to do things. Its spirit of I WILL gave impetus to the greatest commercial and industrial expansion, the oreatest cultural development of the ages. By the sweat of his brow, the Polish immigrant has contributed to Chi- cago's greatness. He first had to find employment, and then by hard work and thrift rear a family and build a home for himself. He built his own churches and schools, the latter of which resulted in considerable savings to the board of education of this city. He set about establishing his little shop and store to cater to the needs of his immediate community. Page 22 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 This done, he next proceeded to take active part in politics. He was handi- capped by his lack of the English language, but in this transitional stage, three factors contributed to awakening his interest in American politics. Civic Factors First, the local pastor would urge his parishioners to become naturalized, to vote in the elections, to put up candidates for public offices. Secondly, the various fraternal organizations, clubs and societies taught their members parliamentary rules of order; that their officers had to be elected by a majority, that they had to have a constitution and by-laws to abide by; that freedom did not mean unbridled individualism, which would result in disorder and chaos. Organizations, like the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Polish Women's Alliance and many others, constituted a fine school of civics for the immigrant, besides offering fraternal insurance to their members. Thirdly, the Polish press called on their readers to take out their citizen papers, to organize themselves politically, to place their candidates in the field, to take their part in the government of their adopted country. The Polish editor of that transitional stage deserves special mention. He was so often looked up as the fountain-head of the foreign culture he rep- resented. He was called upon to prepare and direct plays for amateurs se- lected from the various clubs and societies, to prepare speeches for aspirants to political office who wished to address the voters in their native tongue, to arrange the various celebrations commemorating the foreign national events, to assist in arranging and conducting schools of civics and English, to trans- late from English into his native tongue, to write pocket dictionaries and textbooks, to give opinions on candidates for office, to teach the children born here their father's native language, the history of their land of origin, to foster literature and music, while in addition he often was a writer of feuilletons, short stories dealing with immigrant life in America, of verses and short plays, adapted to the Polish-American stage. Publishers and editors who stressed the importance of politics were : Rev. Francis Gordon, C.R., of the Chicago Polish Daily News, Ladislaus Smulski, W. Dyniewicz, Stanislaus Szwajkart, John J.

He acquainted the immigrant with the institutions of this country in the lat- ter's own language. He helped his countrymen to adapt themselves to Ameri- can conditions. He proved himself of wonderful help in such vital issues as the late war, the purchase of Liberty Bonds, the Red Cross drive, wherein he acquainted his readers with the wishes of the American people. It must be stated that the polish press at all times abided by the policy of the United States government. Conservative or liberal, the Polish newspapers were loyal to the American government. For the Polish immigrant, whatever may be the changed conditions in modern Poland, fully agrees with Mark Twain, who wrote in one of his works : \"Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands. The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government. An earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government, if the condi- tions were the same, namely, the despot the most perfect individual of the human race, and his lease of life perpetual. But as a perishable perfect man must die, and leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor, an earthly despotism is not merely bad form of government, it is the worst possible.\" The clergy, the press and civic pride pointed to the immigrant his political possibilities. He took to politics with alacrity. And naturally so, for did he not come from a nation that in the past had been a republic? That had formed a voluntary confederation with Lithuania and Ruthenia? That adopt- ed the famous Constitution of the Third of May one hundred forty years ago, a really democratic instrument that proved a veritable eyesore to such de- spotisms as Russia and Prussia? Taking Their Part in Municipal Government The history of the City of Chicago, which always has had the largest Polish American population in America, is typical of all other cities in the United States in which the Poles settled in large numbers. It was not until late in the 70's that Captain Peter Kiolbassa, a veteran of the Civil War, was elected a member to the Legislature of the State of Illinois. He was the first of Polish extraction to be elected to public office in Chicago. During the following decade, Stanley Kunz was elected to the Legislature and John Dahlman to the city council. In the nineties we find such names as August T. Kowalski, John Sherman, Stanley Kunz, John F. Smulski and few others, holding the office of alderman of Chicago. In 1891 Captain Peter Kiolbassa was elected city treasurer of Chicago. Previous to his election the interest on Page 24 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 • public funds was the private perquisite of the holder of the office. Kiolbassa was the first city treasurer to place in the city treasury all of the interest earned on public funds. Max A. Drezmal in 1894 was appointed a member of the board of educa- tion. In 1903, John F. Smulski was elected city attorney of Chicago and re-elected in 1905 and held this office until elected in 1906, state treasurer of Illinois. He discharged the duties of these offices in a manner which reflected great credit upon him and won the praise of the public. During this decade Stanley Kunz served one term as state senator and John Derpa, Kleofas Pett- koske and John M. Nowicki were aldermen. Mr. Nowicki and Joseph B. Petlak served two terms in the state legislature. Albert Rostenkowski was state representative. John Czekala, Vincent P. Zwiefka, John Szymkowski, George Rozczynialski were aldermen at a later date. When Wilson was President It was not until the administration of President Woodrow Wilson that the American citizens of Polish ancestry took a more conspicuous part in public life. Frank W. Koraleski was elected a member of the board of asses- sors, Frank P. Danisch clerk of the municipal court, N. L. Piotrowski, be- came city attorney, John Prystalski, assistant corporation counsel and later assistant state's attorney, Julius F. Smietanka, member of the board of edu- cation and later federal collector of internal revenue and John S. Kowalski, chief examiner of the state building and loan department. Since that time, this element has steadily risen in political power and in- fluence. In 1922, Edmund K. Jarecki was elected county judge and has since been reelected three times. M. S. Szymczak, now governor of the federal re- serve board in Washington, was secretary to the county judge. Subsequently he was elected clerk of the superior court, which office he resigned to become city comptroller. The vacancy in the office of clerk of superior court was filled by Frank V. Zintak, who later was elected to that office. At a later date, Anthony Czarnecki was collector of customs for the Port of Chicago ; W. F. Hetman was assistant director of the state department of purchases and construction ; Frank Peska was city attorney, Louis Pinderski was an assistant state's attorney ; Frank Greshkowiak was assistant city prosecutor. Joseph LaBuy became a municipal judge, John Piotrowski a state representative, while John Szymkowski, Stanley Adamkiewicz, Ben Zintak, Max Adamowski, Frank Landmesser, John Lagodny were elected aldermen. • J 837 — POLES OF CHICAGO — 1937 Page 25 The Poles are now well represented in the field of local and national politics.

Space does not permit mention of all the Americans of Polish extraction employed in the various city, county and national offices, in the many ad- juncts to political office, such as social welfare, social security, penal insti- tutions, hospitals, etc. Our Youth Will Uphold Democratic Ideals One of the most encouraging signs of the times is the ever-increasing in- terest which the young people of both sexes, of Polish descent, are taking in public affairs and in politics. They realize the necessity of thorough organi- zation, proper political guidance, and clean and efficient administration. They are not afflicted with any inferiority complex. They are skeptical of any glib promise made by political, social and economic manipulators, for they believe President Roosevelt when he said : \"The outlines of the new social order, rising from the disintegration of the old, are apparent.\" And turning to the youth of America, the President said : \"You place em- phasis on sufficiency of life rather than a plethora of riches. People have learned that they can carry their burdens only by cooperation. Those words 'freedom' and 'opportunity' do not mean a license to climb upward by push- ing other people down.\" The youth of the land will not be pushed down by the blunders of their elders. With their practical sense intensified through the hard knocks of the recent depression, they insist upon political and economic freedom. The new social order shall be a better one, built as it will be by young and willing hands. They young men and women of Polish extraction, since they add their American practical common sense to the ideology of their fathers, shall play a great role in the regeneration of America. Through their efforts this country shall be politically and economically free. It shall at least become a homogeneous nation, united in its Americanism, an exam- Page 28 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO — 1937 pie to the rest of the world that all vital problems can be peacefully solved without resorting to bloodshed and fratricidal conflict. A House Divided Against Itself Will Fall This sentiment was ably expressed by Member of Board of Appeals, Paul Drymalski, at the last election when he spoke as follows from the WCFL broadcasting station: \"Indeed, we are fortunate that we are Ameri- cans, that we live under a democratic system, where we have a free voice in the election of our officials. \"In Spain there is bloodshed, because the citizens have ceased settling their national issues in a peaceful manner, through free elections, decided by a majority of the votes of the citizenry. \"There, where democracy has perished, the people are strangled, oppressed by tyrants who have imposed their will against the will of the people.\" The American principle of settling our differences through the ballot is safe in the hands of our youth, who are the builders of a yet greater America. PART IV CHICAGO POLES SHARE IN CITY ART HISTORY By Jane J. Palczynska POLISH art in Chicago burst forth in full glory with the building of the first churches. The masterly decoration of their interiors ranked equal- ly among the best in the land. The Poles had come to stay and many, many more would follow. From the very start there was a definite manifes- tation of the great cultural heritage they had brought with them. It was at this time that Thaddeus Zukotynski came to Chicago and gave of his genius to glorify the traditions of the Poles ; their deep faith and strong devotion to the Church, their intense love of their mother country and their sincerity in the desire to establish themselves permanently in their adopted land. Thaddeus Zukotynski Zukotynski came here in 1888 and worked in Chicago for a number of years. His frescos in the apse of the Saint Stanislaus' Church, the altar pieces in Saint John Cantius' and Saint Hyacinth's, the sacred pictures in Saint Hedwig's and the stations in the church of the Holy Cross, have left us a testimonial of his art which will excite admiration and devotion as long as his work can be preserved. During this time Zukotynski acquired for himself an enviable reputation and was considered one of the foremost artists in the domain of ecclesiastical painting in America. Both German and English papers were full of his praises. This truly great artist had not only gained recognition for his paint- ings in Polish churches, and only in Chicago, but he has to his great credit an altar piece in Saint Hedwig's in South Bend, Ind. ; an Adoration in the Chapel of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, and a number of magnificently painted windows of stained glass in Saint Michael's, in Milwaukee, Wis. ; sacred pictures in Saint Joseph's, in Logansport, Ind., some paintings in Mishawaka, Ind., and in Saint Mary's of the Woods, Indiana. • St. Stanislaus In the following masterly description of what is considered Zukotynski's masterpiece we find evidence not only of the profoundness and skill of the Page 30 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO — 1937 • master, but also proof that Chicago valued and appreciated the contribution of her new citizens. It is like a beautiful sermon for those who read it today. Eliza Ellen Starr, a renowned artist, and directress of a School of Art, fa- mous for her lecture on Roman Art, in an article on \"Christian Art as Mani- fested in Chicago Churches\" in the \"New World,\" wrote as follows : \"A cheerless winter day, the wind whistling, dust, not snow, as we made our painful way through all the intricacies of the West Side, for our driver seemed ignorant even of the points of the compass, whereas the true way from our door to Noble and Ingraham streets is a direct and easy one. WTe were worn out with stopping before every 'Polish Church' but the one we were in search of: for this, we knew, contained treasures worthy of a pilgrimage harder even than the one Ave were making. At last our lively little companion, with her sharp eyes that read every sign on every shop, declared we were in the neighborhood of Saint Stanislaus Church, for \"everything is named for him.\" She was right and soon our horses stood before a massive, grave edi- fice, with closed doors in front. There is a side door opening into a basement, but as we had nothing to do with basements, the pastoral residence must be found, and her light foot soon brought us the intelligence that we had only to drive the length of the church to find it. A courteous welcome met us at the very door and taking pity upon us, as it seemed, for our weariness after wandering two hours across all the railroad tracks and viaducts, we were kindly led through the house to the sacristy, through the sacristy into the sanctuary, there to make our thanksgiving for the happy termination of our woes : then led carefully into one of the pews near the center of the church, when the kind voice of the young priest said : \"Here you can see the pic- ture,\" as if he knew it was the picture we had come to see. With this word of encouragement we lifted our weary eyes to see — what? Heaven? Yes, heaven : such a heaven as we have never seen in the old world or new ; such a heaven as we had never expected to see until our eyes should open, after a long purgatory, in that heaven where dwells \"in light inaccessible and full of glory,\" the Eternal Father, the Eternal Son and the Eternal Holy Ghost ! We write this sentence deliberately, meaning every word we have written and intending to have it taken in its full and literal sense. We will now give, to the best of our ability, a description of this picture, only premising, that we of today see this picture fresh from the hand of the master, its color undimmed by time or our murky atmosphere ; since it must be conceded that much of the pleasure in looking at the European masterpieces is lost four, five and six centuries after the execution, owing to those changes in color no mortal care or skill can prevent. Our masterpieces on the apse of Saint Stanislaus is in all its freshness, and never, we repeat, have we ever seen • 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO — 1937 Page 3? such celestial tints, such a glory of heavenly radiance, as came before us like a vision in that gloomy wintry day, in the dim church. There was no touching of electric buttons, no lighting whatsoever from without : for of this picture, as of the heaven of the Apocalypse, 'the Lamb was the light thereof.' \"Behold, then, Christ seated in His majesty, in His benignity in the upper center of this composition, while still above, so as to round the arch, are seen the Eternal Father and the Eternal Holy Ghost, all set in the intense light, of the Beatific Vision. On either hand of this Trinity of glory are groups of flying angels, carrying the emblems of our Lord's Passion : on the right the holy cross, on the left the lance, the crown of thorns and the nails, while three angels represent, symbolically, the merits which Poland has won in the sight of heaven by her fidelity to Christianity in the midst of dismemberment and suffering. \"Thus far the upper and most radiant part of the picture ; but immediately in the foreground, with the radiance of the vision upon them, is the Blessed Virgin Mother Mary, in the plenitude of grace, of beauty, of joy; for our masterpiece is entitled \"The Triumph of Christ,\" and she who shared to the full His humiliation, is now sharing to the full His triumph, and her adora- tion, is the adoration of joy. At her side is her virgin spouse, Saint Joseph, and that seraphic penitent, Saint Mary Magdalene, also Saint Joachim and Saint Anne ; opposite Saint John the Baptist, Saint Zachary, and Saint Eliza- beth. To his right, also, as we face the picture, loom up the grand forms of the prophets, of ancient worthies, and to be plainly distinguished among them are Adam and Eve., Noe, Melchisedeck, Abraham with Isaac and Jacob ; Moses with the tables of the law, and Aaron as high priest; Joseph of Egypt, Samuel with the phial of holy oil from which he annointed David in the house of his father Jesse at Bethlehem ; David as king and psalmist with his harp, repeating with transport his prophetic canticles ; Ruth with her sheaves of wheat gleaned in the field of Boaz ; while still in groups pressing forward to adore and praise the Christ for whom they prayed and longed are Samson, Joshua, Gideon, Judith with the head of Holofernes, Mordecai and Esther, and the valiant Maccabees ; all to be distinguished by something which in- dicates their story. \"Turning to the left as we look at the picture the heroes of the Xew Law come before us like a conquering host. First the apostles, among whom the eye easily rests upon Saint Peter and Saint Paul and Saint John ; then the great Doctors of the Church, seated on a bench of clouds, give one of the most original features of the composition. Of these, nearest to the spectator is Saint Gregory the Great, in his tiara, with the triple pontifical staff held aloft like a banner with the right hand, in the left a book referring to the voluminous writings of this Pope; the rich cope enveloping the majestic figure, while the thin, worn, but inspired countenance, looks out on the Page 32 J 837 — POLES OF CHICAGO — 1937 • world of which he was the spiritual sovereign, as Leo XIII, looks over the world today. Never has a Pope been more magnificently presented than Gregory the Great in this picture. Next to him the great scholar, Saint Je- rome, in his Cardinal's hat, an immense tome held by one hand on his knee, the serious face bearing the mark of his austerities in the desert and at Bethlehem. Then Saint Ambrose in his mitre, one hand grasping his crozier, the other extended as if discoursing deeply of our Lord, while next to him is Saint Augustine, also wearing the mitre, but with an inspired uplift of the face heavenward, and both hands extended toward our Lord, as if in an ecstasy of eloquence. Taken by itself, this bench of holy doctors is a wonder in art. Still further in the background is Saint Helen with the Holy Cross, Saint Stephen and Saint Lawrence, Saint Clement, Pope, Saint Cecelia and Saint Agnes, all martyrs, all with their symbols; Saint Paul and Saint An- thony, hermits. Then the army of the different religious orders bearing their banners, like a triumphant host, represented by their founders, like Saint Benedict, Saint Bruno, Saint Dominic, Saint Francis of Assissi ; the apostles of different nations, Saint Boniface, Saint Cyril, and Saint Methodius ; pop- ular saints like Saint Bernard, Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint Wenceslaus, Saints Vladimir, Adalbert and Stanislaus, Saint Hedwig and Saint Elizabeth of Thuringia, princesses ; Saint Hyacinth, Saint Thomas of Equin, Saint Theresa, Saint Catherine of Sienna, Saint Clara and near the foreground the great martyr, Saint John Nepomucene with his finger on his lips; Saint Vincent of Paul, Saint John Cantius, Saint Casimir, Saint Francis of Sales, Saint Josaphat, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, with his spiritual son and beloved saint of Poland, Saint Stanislaus Kostka, under whose invocation stand the walls in which this glorious work of art has been executed. \"The bare enumeration of these personages from all ages, all countries, shows a master's hand which alone could arrange these groups in all their beauteous details, then marshal them like squadrons under a great admiral so as to give, in their perfect unity of conception, one sunburst of gladness a triumph indeed, before which all others will pale to the end of time. \"But our artist had not completed his idea; and working as he was under the wise patronage of the 'Congregation of the Resurrection,' he was left perfectly free to follow out this idea. Not one straw was laid in his path, no consideration as to time or expense was allowed to trammel him. Others might have obliged him to copy one masterpiece or another, but our Con- gregation of the Resurrection knew that they had a master also, whose fresh compositions would make their church a place of pilgrimage, like the apses of the old world basilicas. Therefore, the high ceiling finished, he proceeded to paint his dado, precisely after the manner of that old mosaic worker, Jacopo Turrita, in the apse of Saint Mary Major, Rome. In the center is the Blessed Virgin laying her Divine Son into the arms of the youthful Stanis- laus; the Virgin Mother of a ravishing loveliness as to countenance, of an • 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO — 1937 Page 33 unspeakable benignity in her mien, as she holds toward the holy youth in her extended arms her Divine Child; and that Child extends both His own hands toward the kneeling Stanislaus ; not only kneeling, but with hands thrown upward to the Holy Child in a transport of joy, of devotion. The glory of heaven rays from the Mother and her Son; angels fill every space; but one angel supports, with his right hand, the ecstatic youth, in the other brings him a lily as the emblem of his innocence. The picture is one con- centrated rapture, such as Correggio loved to paint, and never did Murillo paint a more ecstatic vision than this one of Saint Stanislaus ; its execution as careful, its glowing colors passing off into as mystical shadows as either of these two masters ever achieved. \"This group being the center piece, we see single figures standing in pairs, as upon a mullion window under one arch, those saints which Poland has honored for so many centuries, whom she does not forget amid the turmoil of our commercial civilization. To the extreme left as we face the sanctuary stands Saint Josaphat, Archbishop of Plotsk and martyr, with his archiepis- copal staff, wearing his pallium, and in the flower of his age, since he was only forty-four when he gave his blood for Poland; a story full of pathos and heroism. He is companioned by Saint Hyacinth, the Dominican, in his white habit and steel blue mantle; the so-called apostle of Poland, and the wonder worker, in his hand the book of the great teacher and preacher; both standing on a tesselated pavement. Next, Saint Stanislaus, the martyr Bishop of Cracow, Poland ; a magnificent figure in his mitre, bearing his episcopal staff and palm in his right hand, the left arm pressing to his heart the blessed sword of his martyrdom, while his face is turned in rapture to- ward heaven. His companion is Saint Adalbert of Prague, also a Bishop and also martyr ; in his right hand the palm, in the other the oar of a vessel with which he was first knocked down, then pierced with a lance. To the right of the central group, the two great apostles of Scythia, Slavonia and Bulgaria, brothers, whose record is to be found on the walls of the subterranean church of Saint Clement, Rome — Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius, the latter an artist who painted his pictures in a way to convert whole nations. Lastly, to the extreme right hand, Saint John Cantius, secular priest and professor of theology in the University of Cracow, on his head his doctor's cap or berret- ta, in his right hand his pen, his left resting on the volume open on his read- ing desk, the eyes turned toward the Blessed Virgin and her Son in the cen- tral picture. He is companioned by the beautiful young prince, Saint Casi- mir, his crown on his head, with his kingly mantle on his shoulders, a lily for his scepter, the right foot, the right hand slightly extended, with eyes lifted to heaven — stepping forth on the tesselated pavement of his palace like a spirit rather than a mortal. ...\" The recognition and encouragement of such a master was one of the greatest and most priceless contributions of the Poles in Chicago. His in- Page 34 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1 937 • fluence is alive today and there is evidence of its continuation. Prof. Zuko- tynski, a Polish count, with a studio in Munich, was one of Europe's fore- most painters of religious subjects. A pupil if Pilatti, an enthusiastic ad- mirer of Matejko, he gathered the knowledge of centuries, brought it here and passed it on to others. Sister Stanisia In 1920, Sister Stanisia, a Chicago artist nun of the Academy of Our Lady, Longwood, was commissioned to restore some of the precious frescoes of Zukotynski. Sister Stanisia was born in Chicago. Her talent developed early and was recognized by Prof. Zukotynski, who proceeded to give her instructions. For seven or eight years she remained under his supervision and was well grounded in the continental methods and technique of her celebrated teacher. On his death so great was the progress she made, she was called upon to finish some of his work. As a nun, Sister Stanisia continued her art studies at the Chicago Art In- stitute. She studied with Ralph Clarkson, Frank C. Peyrand, John Norton and Albin Polasek. St; Stanislaus' Frescoes Restored As his most talented pupil, Sister Stanisia was entrusted, as one best qualified, to restore the frescoes of St. Stanislaus. To quote Karol Wachtel in translation, from an article in Dziennik Chicai goski (The Polish Daily News) of November 23, 1920: \" . . . . Sister Stanisia worked long and conscientiously in the Church of St. Stanislaus ; the work entrusted to her, she executed with real piety. First of all she prepared a whole series of sketches of the paintings to be restored, and after having studied them in detail, undertook to repaint them. This was tedious and difficult work. Some parts of the paintings had to be gone over seven or eight times, and required great care and skill in order to retain faithfully, the characteristics of the original. \"Sister Stanisia was most successful in the complete fullness of her under- taking. The restoration of the murals in the presbyterium and naves of Saint Stanislaus' is a great and beautiful achievement which brings her honor and associates her name and her art with the famous one of Zukotynski— a name that the Poles of Chicago will never forget. \"The paintings gained remarkably in clearness. Their superbly beautiful colors came to life again, strangely harmonious, pleasing, peaceful, and yet strong and sure. That which the long years had sought to obliterate, emerged o 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO — 1937 Page _3? again, as if alive and resurrected from behind the curtain of dust and smoke ; all the figures — so beautiful, so radiant, and so inspiring, are plainly and distinctly visible from afar, and the unity of the composition, especially the upper section above the presbyterium, stands out clearly and impressively in all its details \" Sister Stanisia has been called upon to restore other Zukotynski paint- ings. Fresco painting, in which the design is drawn and painted on wet plaster is extremely difficult to preserve in its original state, and constant restoration is being made of some very famous ones. Among others, Sister Stanisia restored those at St. Hyacinth's and at Holy Cross Church. \"Little Flower\" When the Stehli Bros., a famous art firm of Zurich, desired an original conception of the Sacred Heart for reproduction in color and circulation throughout the world, they passed over the religious painters of Europe and commissioned Sister Stanisia for the work. C. J. Bulliet in an article in the Chicago Daily News of March 14, 1936, says : \"Sister Stanisia is perhaps the most widely known of woman painters throughout the Catholic world, in the United States and Europe. She became internationally established when she exhibited four paintings at the religious art show in connection with the Eucharistic Congress in Chicago in 1925 — a painting of the \"Little Flower,\" a portrait of Bishop J. F. Noll of Fort Wayne and two Madonnas. Commissions began coming to her immediately for altar pieces, devotional works, portraits and murals. \"An early portrait of Cardinal Mundelein was hung in Staint George high school, Evanston and a later one exhibited in 1935 at the Davis Galleries, was commissioned for the College of Cardinals, Washington. Murals and paintings of her are in St. Luke's, St. Paul, Minn.; Adrian College, Michi- gan ; Mount Mary College, Milwaukee ; and St. Joseph's hospital, St. Marga- ret's church and Holy Cross church, Chicago. These are but several of the seventeen churches in which she painted.\" Mayor Kelly \"But Sister Stanisia has not confined herself strictly to religious painting. A portrait of Mayor Kelly was unveiled with ceremonies at the Illinois Host House in July of the second summer of the fair, A Century of Progress. A portrait of Gov. Horner was seen by multitudes in the Hall of States at A Century of Progress and now hangs in the governor's executive mansion in Springield, Illinois. She has painted many hundreds of portraits; among Page 36 1837 — POLES OF ■ CHICAGO — 1937 ♦ them some of the most distinguished bishops, civic leaders and prominent citizens. R. A. Lennon, a newspaper interviewer, on a visit to her studio in com- menting on her work remarked :\".... there is a finished harmony of com- position, an acute insight into character and a fine feeling for texture. This is particularly well shown in the detail of the clothing of the figures — in the brilliant sheen of shimmering silks and the lustrous softness of rich velvet.\" This feeling for texture stood Sister Stanisia in good stead when she painted Cardinal Mundelein in full regalia as Prince of the Church, and she has not hesitated, following painting tradition, to clothe her Madonnas rich- ly, as befits the Queen of Heaven. Following tradition too, just as her teacher Zukotynski who, when paint- ing the murals in Saint Stanislaus used live models-^Father Barzynski, the pastor and Mr. Czekala, a parishioner, to mention but a few — Sister Stanisia doesn't hesitate to use human models for her religious paintings. \"The American Madonna,\" a work that has called forth much praise for its spir- itual quality, had as a model a Chicago girl. Raphael, it may be remembered, used for his Sistine Madonna a beautiful Roman girl, a daughter of a baker. While \"The American Madonna\" glorifies the Virgin Mary in an attitude of profound humility, nobility and grace, it also portrays and even im- mortalizes the ideal American girl in all her beauty, sanctity and idealism. Though this may have supplied the theme, Sister Stanisia has unquestiona- bly woven into it some of her own piety and her own devotion. Only one who possesses the innermost depths of piety would give us such a human, yet divine expression as is to be seen in the face of \"The American Madon- na.\" This painting, called a \"Prayer in Color,\" was exhibited at the Chicago University, Renaissance Society, Denver, St. Paul, Florida and California. A recital of her wordly honors is against the expressed wishes of Sister Stanisia, who is devoted first to her religious duties and afterward to her brushes and paints. While she will talk pleasantly and even with flashes of humor about her art aims, when it comes to personal matters she sidesteps her interviewers. It becomes necessary to go to the \"records,\" chiefly news- paper clippings and exhibition catalogues, to learn facts about her. Fortunately, from the outset of her career, so interesting has she been from the \"news angle\" — a painter of unusually fine talent developing in the sheltered circles of a nunnery— that the records are fairly complete. The world is entitled to them, to the way of thinking of a sympathetic heathen like myself. Fra Angelico lived a sequestered life, too, but the eager biographers have been as curious about him as about the worldly minded Raphael. Just as she still does secular portraits, so Sister Stanisia devotes a part of her studio time to landscape. \"Beverly Hills on a Rainy Day\" was a pleas- 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 Page 37 ing impression carried away last summer by visitors to her big one-man show. In 1932, Sister Stanisia was awarded a silver medal in the international fair at Warsaw, capitol city of the Poland where Count Zukotynski, her dis- coverer, originated. Harriet and Walter Krawiec It is difficult to write about Harriet Krawiec alone, for her life and her work is closely associated with that of her husband. At the age of 14, Harriet was taken by her mother, Mrs. Korzeniewska, to the Academy of Our Lady for a course in painting under Sister Stanisia. Later she continued her art studies at the Art Institute. She is primarily a wife and mother, painting what is nearest at hand and in her leisure moments— mainly flowers and still life arrangements. Occa- sionally she paints the out-of-doors, but only that bit which she can see from her windows— just a little way down the street— or in her garden. She leaves to her husband the big out-of-doors, the horses, the fires, the circuses and the portraits. And yet she has kept pace with him as they gained recognition and honor through the years. In 1927 both gained recognition at the Art Institute of Chicago and have not only been represented in the exhibitions every year during the past ten years, but in 1935 were specially invited to have a one-man show. An entire room was filled with only their paintings — an honor rare indeed in Chicago. They are both members of the very select Chicago Galleries Association, which invites into its membership only outstanding artists of recognized reputation. In addition, 'their work was exhibited in the following important galleries throughout the United States: Corcoran Gallery, Washington, D. C. ; Car- negie Institute, with a selected group of thirty artists; National Academy, New York City; and in Philadelphia and Oklahoma City. Their paintings are found in special museums and private collections. One of Mrs. Krawiec's paintings is in the permanent state collection in the State Museum, Springfield, Illinois. The city of Chicago owns three of Mr. Kra- wiec's. ''If any two painters walk away with the show,\" said Eleanor Jewett in the Chicago Tribune on April 3, 1933, \"they are Walter Krawiec and his wife, Harriet. Their progress in technique and manner has been matter for recognition during the last several years. Today, their achievement places them at the head of any important group of painters, no matter where found. Mr. Krawiec has become particularly interested in the possibilities of the circus as painting material. Mrs. Krawiec concerns herself with flowers and still life arrangements.\" Page 38 1837 — POLES OF CHICAGO— 1937 • Upon another occasion in the Tribune, on April 16, 1933, she wrote : \"Harriet Krawiec is another of our persuasive painters. She has ability, sound technique and good craftsmanship. Her work is eminently fine. Her sense of design is beautifully developed and she injects a personal feeling into even the simplest of her conceptions which lifts them at once out of the commonplace. One can take nothing but pleasure in a closer acquaintance with her excellent modeling and perfect relationship of color.\" His Eminence, George Cardinal Mundelein of Chicago Several achievements of Mr. Krawiec deserve special mention.
