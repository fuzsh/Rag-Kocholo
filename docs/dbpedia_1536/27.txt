Ancestry of Jozefa Becmer

This page contains all the known ancestry of Jozefa Becmer who emigrated to the USA in 1903 and married Saturnin Roman in New Britain, CT in 1909. Jozefa went by the name Josephine in America. The information on this family comes from several New Britain records, some family recollections, a few letters from Poland sent shortly after the second World War and other letters from the present, and various parish records from Poland.

The area of Poland that Josephine's people are from is about 100 miles northwest of Warsaw. It's about 25 miles east of Torun, ten miles east of Golub-Dobrzyn, and ten miles SSW of Brodnica.

THE BECMER FAMILY

STANIS£AW BECMER, d. before 1825,[1/M5] d. maybe Strzygi parish 3 Oct 1808,[2] m. ZOFIA ARGALSKA (dau. of Jozef Argalski and Anna), b. Strzygi parish 20 May 1762.[2]

Stanis³aw Becmer is almost certainly the son of Jan Becmer and Jadwiga. This couple had children born in Strzygi between 1748 and 1755 and possibly had more children, maybe in a nearby parish. Children recorded in Strzygi to Jan and Jadwiga are: Ewa, b. 11 Aug 1748; Lucya, b. 21 Dec 1750; Bart³omiej, b. 26 Aug 1753; and Katarzyna, b. 30 Nov 1755.[2] There are no other Becmer families on record in the parish at this time, and Stanis³aw, who would have been born probably in the late 1750's or early 1760's, is known to have had a brother Bart³omiej.

Bart³omiej married Anna Lescynska who was born 16 Jun 1767, the daughter of Stanis³aw Leszczenska and Mary. Anna had sisters Maryanna b. 27 Jun 1769, Katarzyna b. 18 April 1775, and Ewa b. 21 Jul 1782. According to the Strzygi parish records, Bart³omiej and Anna had the following children:

1. Franciszek Becmer, d. 28 Dec 1791 2. Ignacy Becmer, b. 29 Jul, d. 26 Aug 1792 3. Franciszek Becmer, b. 31 Jan 1795, maybe m. 14 Feb 1819 Julianna Danietowska 4. Tomasz Becmer, b. 17 Sep 1802 5. Anna, b. abt. 1804, m. Tr±bin 1823 [1/M12] Jakub Garecki 6. Maryanna Becmer, b. 22 Feb 1806 7. Magdalena Becmer, b. 21 Jul 1808, m. Tr±bin 1830 Andrzej Drzewoszewski

Zofia Argalska was born in Strzygi parish 20 May 1762 to Jozef Argalski and Anna. This couple also had children: Jozef Argalski, b. 24 June 1753; Anna Argalska, b. 4 April 1756; and Antoni Argalski, b. 20 May 1759

Matuesz was living in Gulbiny (parish Tr±bin) at the time of his marriage. He was the son of deceased Stanis³aw Becmer and Zofia Argulska of parish Strzygi but living with his uncle Bart³omiej Becmer in Gulbiny at the time.[1/M5] The parish records of Strzygi do not exist prior to 1826 so earlier information on this family has not been found. Strzygi is the next parish ENE of Tr±bin and about five miles away. Mateusz was described as a tailor in the birth record of his son Wojciech.[2/B23]

Two children of Katarzyna's second marriage have been found. One birth was recorded in Tr±bin in 1852, which, given Katarzyna's age, would likely be her last child. Evidence for the other comes from her marriage record in Tr±bin in 1864. This child was born in the village of Dabrowa in some other parish. The Romanowskis probably moved to that parish shortly after their marriage and returned by 1852.

Mateusz' uncle Bart³omiej had a wife Anna Lescynska. Their daughter Anna was born about 1804 and married in Tr±bin 1823 to Jakub Garecki.[1/M12] The early records of Tr±bin parish (1749-1807) do not contain any Becmer events). Bart³omiej and Anna Becmer also had a daughter Magdalena who married in Tr±bin in 1830 to Andrzej Drzewoszewski, a farmer from W±pielsk (parish Radziki) and son of Maek D. and Magdalena Biernacka. Magdalena Becmer was listed as born in Dlugie about 1806 or 1807.[2/M11]

The list of children is, no doubt, incomplete because I have so far been unable to access baptism records post 1865. However it appears birth records are available on microfilm 0462775 up to and including 1877.

This family probably lived in Radzynek (parish ¯a³e) and Ruszkowo (Tr±bin parish). Julianna was born in Radzynek in 1866 and was living there when she married Jozef Becmer in 1883. According to one record, their daughter Jozefa was also born in Radzynek in 1887. However another record describes Jozefa as "ex loco p. Ruskowo".[3] The family was certainly living in Ruszkowo in 1912 when Jozefa had returned to Poland for a visit and gave birth to her second child in there in January 1912.[5] The passenger arrival records from the return trip indicate Jozef Becmer was residing in Ruszkowo at the time.[20]

Jozef Becmer died after September 1912.[20] Julianna died 12 January 1943, three weeks after the Germans confiscated her farm and drove her off the property.[7] Among the children, in addition to Jozefa, were Aniela, Stefania,[6,7] Franciszek, Leon, Felicia, and Felix.[19]

There exist several letters, now in the possession of Michael Roman, that were written by Josephine's sisters to her shortly after the second World War, and they contain information that helps paint a picture of the family. Josephine never answered them for whatever reason, and contact between the Polish and American branches of the family was subsequently lost. Contact was re-established in 2000 with the son of Leon Becmer who lives in the same house in which Josephine would have been born.

Aniela wrote several letters. She lived in Lemkowizna, Radziki parish, the wife of Julian Budzinski. She wrote that almost all members of the family survived the terrible war and were in good health. She had 12 children in 1946. The youngest child was 13 years old, the oldest 40. Among these 12 children there were 8 sons and 4 daughters. 5 sons and 3 daughters were married before 1946. One son lived in England (possibly a member of the Polish army in Western Europe? - so called Polskie Sily Zbrojne). Her mother died in 1943 in Lemkowizna. In fact, she had lived on the farm of Leon, but the Germans had confiscated the farm and she had moved to Aniela where she died. She also mentioned an Aunt Krajewska who died before the war. In 1946 her (presumably Aunt Krajewska's) farm belonged to Felka (a diminutive form of Felicia).[6]

Another sister, Stefania Domanska of Maryanowo (Tr±bin parish), wrote on 23 June 1946 that her husband died 2(?) years ago in August. The Germans exiled her. Mother died 12 Jan. 1943. After the exile of Leon, mother moved to the Budzinskis and died 3 weeks after that. She is buried in Tr±bin parish. During the war Anielka (diminutive of Aniela), Franek (diminutive of Franciszek) and Felek (diminutive of Felix) stayed at their homes. However Germans exiled her, Felka and Leon. Her material situation was not good. However she had two workers on her farm - one Pole and an old German woman. This German (81 years old at the time) had taken her farm after her exile and when Stefania returned to the farm, she caught her.[7]

Josephine had an aunt and two cousins in New Britain. Anna Wisniewski, daughter of Felix Wisniewski (1876-1970), wrote that her paternal "grandmother had a brother whose 2 daughters came to America, and [Josephine] was the daughter of the sister. These children, as I see it, were first cousins to our father".[8] The "sister" here means the sister to Anna's grandmother and her brother. Anna's sister, Rosalie (Wisniewski) Benoit, adds that Felix's father arrived from Poland and then sent for his wife and four daughters, named Margarette, Antonette, Pauline, and Lottie. The sons, Theo (Dave) and Felix, were left with an aunt and came over later. Rosalie states that Josephine was the daughter of Felix Wisniewski's [maternal] aunt and that "there was also a son, his daughter Pauline was a cousin to my dad as was" Josephine Becmer.[9] Florence Waskelewicz , a daughter of Felix's sister Josephine, provides the most informative picture of the Wisniewski family. "My mother was born in 1881 in Budnow, Poland. Emigrated 1889 with sisters Anna & Lottie. Two sons left behind, David & Feliks, who was Rosalie Wisniewski's father. My grandmother was an aunt to 'Josie' Becmer. John Wisniewski came to the states alone, fell in love with the country, went back to Poland to get Grandma & the 3 daughters. He had earned enough for 5 passages. Grandma refused to 'tear up' her roots to start over again in a foreign land. Grandpa told her if she so wishes, but he would never see Poland again. Several years later when enough was earned for 2 tickets, David & Felix followed.[10] In another letter Florence says her mother was born 27 June 1881 and came to this country 1 March 1889. The family first lived in Kingston, NY. Her mother was the first to come to New Britain, and then the family followed. [Josephine] and 'Pelasia' were my grandmother Wisniewska's nieces."[11] For more information on these families, please refer to the Chmielewski family.

John's wife, Agnes Chmielewska, who was born 1 January 1855 and died in New Britain on 26 October 1923,[12] is the "grandmother" listed above as the sister to Josephine's mother. It's interesting to note that Magdalena Wisniewska was the maid of honor at the wedding of Saturnin Roman and Josephine Becmer.[4] Unfortunately she doesn't appear in any other records that have been searched. Could she have been Josephine's first cousin Margaret Wisniewski?

Stella Marshall relates that money had been sent back to Poland for Julianna (Chmielewska) Becmer to come to New Britain but that she was turned down at the port of embarkation (Bremen, Germany) due to poor eyesight and/or hearing. She rushed back home and gave the ticket to her daughter Jozefa, who had less than 24 hours to pack her things, say her good-byes, and get to the ship that would take her to her new life.

Jozefa/Josephine returned eight years later for a visit with her son Edmund. When she departed New Britain, she did not realize she was pregnant and subsequently gave birth to son John in Ruszkowo. Upon her return, sister Stefania Becmer came along[20] but returned to Poland, probably after a short stay. Stefania was listed as 18 years old at the time.

THE CHMIELEWSKI FAMILY

WOJCIECH CHMIELEWSKI, b. abt. 1792, d. Choyno (parish Ró¿e) 14 Jan 1832,[7/83:8] m. MARYANNA KACZMARSKA.

Wojciech was probably born in the village of Stalmierz (parish Ró¿e) 8 Aug 1792 (bap. 12 Aug),[2/B11] the son of Jan and Agnieszka Chmielewski. Both parents were listed as free, i.e. not peasants belonging to someone. Jan and Agnieszka had another son Wawrzyniec born in Ugoszcz in 1789.[2] Wojciech married Maryanna Kaczmarska within a few years either side of 1815. Since the marriage record does not appear to be among the Ró¿e records, they probably married in a nearby parish where Maryanna's family would have been living at the time. Wojciech's family may have also lived elsewhere as it is likely there were other children in the family whose births do not appear in Ró¿e.

In the 1819 baptism record of daughter Apolonia and 1823 record of daughter of Maryanna, Wojciech is referred to as a peasant worker in the Lawki settlement which belongs to the Chojno estates.

Jozef's godparents were Jan Dabrowski and Angela Zaleska.

Daughter Agnieszka married Jan Wisniewski in 1873 and they later moved to Kingston, NY and then New Britain, CT where they had a large family. Jan's name in English is John. Rosalie Benoit wrote that John died in New Britain in August 1912,[9] but he apparently died before coming to New Britain as his death record is not found in New Britain and his wife Agnes was listed as a widow when she first appears in the New Britain City Directory in 1907.[4] John was the son of Dominik Wisniewski and Anna Wroblewska who married in the parish of P³onne 25 Jan 1848. Jan/John was born in P³onko (parish P³onne) 12 May 1850.[7/B22] Dominik was born in P³onko about 1821 the son of Mateusz Wisniewski (died before 1848) and Rozalia. Anna was born in Radziki about 1825 to Wojciech Wroblewski and Maryanna. Anna was a servant in P³onko at the time of marriage.[7/M4]

Tomasz was probably the brother of Andrzej Drzewoszewski who also lived in Gulbiny and married in 1782 to Teresa Frezinska. He died in December 1782 at the age of 30. We know that ancestor Franciszka belongs to this family as her parents were named in the record of her second marriage in 1822.

Barbara Talkowicz was described in one record as Barbara Jakubowna, which may indicate her father's name was Jakub. Drzewoszewski is pronounced something like Dshe-vo-SHEV-ski.

THE KOPCZYNSKI FAMILY

ANTONI KOPCZYNSKI, m. Tr±bin 23 Feb 1772,[1/1:265] ANNA Zaobor.

The wife's surname is given in the marriage record but is difficult to make out. It appears to be Zaoborowna, although that seems like an unusual name for a Pole. Antoni probably had a brother Jan, who was a witness at Antoni's marriage. Jan had children Dorota and Jakub. Dorota was living in Gulbiny at the time of her marriage in 1811. One witness was her brother Jakub and another was B³azej Kopczynski, age 36, innkeeper.[2/5:5] B³azej was probably a first cousin of the bride.

THE RACZKOWSKI FAMILY

PIOTR RACZKOWSKI, b. abt. 1778, m. ANNA GRABOWSKA, b. abt. 1783, d. bef. 1828.

The surname appears in the early records as Rac, Ratz, Racz, and Raczkowski. In the later records the name is always written as Raczkowski which is how the name will appear here.

The family appears to have mostly lived in the village of Woynowo in parish Ró¿e, although the record of son Jan's marriage in 1828 indicates the parents were living in Piskorczyn in parish ¯a³e at the time. Anna was deceased by the time of this marriage. Also from this marriage record we find that Anna had a brother Stanis³aw Grabowski, a farmer in ¯a³e born about 1778.[6/M19]

In the baptism record of son Jozef in 1819, Piotr is referred to as a "master of balcksmith's artistry".[4/B94] Piotr and Anna lived in house #13 in Wojnowo at the time. Piotr may have been the son of Wawrzyniec and Konstancya, maiden name Judicka. Wawrzyniec died in Woynowo in 1799.[1/2:62] Konstancya died in Woynowo 5 Mar 1813 at the age of 86. She was the widow of Wawrzyniec and the mother of Tomasz, age 45, and Piotr, age 35.[4/21:51]

THE WITKOWSKI FAMILY

AUGUST WITKOWSKI, b. Kruszyn, Prussia abt. 1798, m. P³onne 16 Jan 1826,[1/M1] KATARZYNA WASILEWSKA (daughter of Jan Wasilewski and Maryanna Fochczynska), b. Zdunie, P³onne abt. 1810.

August Witkowski appears in the parish of P³onne by 1826 when he married and had his first child born there in 1827. Thereafter the family lived in Gulbiny in the parish of Tr±bin where more children of this couple are likely to be found, including a daughter Anna who was born here in 1830.

From August and Katarzyna's marriage record we find that August was born in Kruszyn in Prussia, the son of Kazimierz Witkowski and Katarzyna Zawilkowska who were still living in Kruszyn at the time. August was described as a farm worker. Katarzyna Wasilewska's family were "komorniks".[1/M1]

Information on this family is sketchy, but they more than likely had more than the two children listed below. Kunegunda had a brother B³azej, born about 1788 and living in Brzuze, parish ¯a³e, in 1828.[2/78:19]
