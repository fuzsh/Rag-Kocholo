It is on the helmet. While Bielski places three ostrich feathers, the other three towers, each one looks like an ostrich feather. I don't read anywhere where this coat of arms was bought, only the MS mentioned above. The Hollenderska story shows that Teodoric Weiher from Franconia, a father of a family, a brave man who came to Prussia and Pomerania with Krzywki in search of knightly fame .

His fearless bravery, with which he appeared many times in various battles, paved the way for him: his first expedition with Sigismund III. to Sweden, at that time under command of the infantry, where faithful advice, the weapon of luck and the dignity of the royal majesty, he opposed the rebelling Lord Sigismund, his hereditary Swedes, not without an obvious life in danger, as a bullet wounded in his side and shoulder, he hardly sealed his favor with this king with his life. After returning to his homeland, the king sent his army to Hungary as soon as he recovered. not there with the imperial queen. Only in Hungary, but also in Wallachia and Multany , did he fight the enemy with great courage and glory. Later, near Targowice , Bucharest, Białocerkwia , Dziurdów , he always happily beat Turks and Tatars.

There are four coats of arms there, the first is Dąbrowa, the second is Pomian , the third is Doliwa , the fourth is Wilczekosy : that is MS. about Prussian families, but there must be a mistake in the Dąbrowa coat of arms, because the Szczawiński family does not seal itself with Dąbrowa, but with Prawdzic : of whom there were two daughters, one of whom was Jan Potulicki de Chodziesz , a chamberlain of Poznan, was married in Złotów and Potulica , an heir, with whom she fathered Jan and Ernest Potulicki succeeded Oleski in Oleśnica on 2 voto .
