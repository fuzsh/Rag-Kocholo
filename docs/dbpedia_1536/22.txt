ARMIA was formed in 1984 in as a result of the contact of three personalities of the Polish independent music scene: Tomasz Budzyński (Siekier), Robert Brylewski (Brygada Kryzys, Izrael) and a philosopher Sławomir Gołaszewski.

The band released a dozen or so albums, two of which, Legenda and Triodante released in 1990 are now classified as the staple of Polish rock music. During the thirty-something career of the band, many outstanding and distinguished rock musicians played in the band. Currently, the band consists of Tomasz Budzyński - vocal, Amadeusz Kaźmierczak - percussion, Dariusz Budkiewicz - bass guitar, Jakub Bartoszewski - horn, keyboards. Stanisław Budzyński - guitar.

In 2011, at the Howe Horyzonty International Film Festival in Wrocław, the film "Journey to the East" was premiered, which is a poetic story of the band Army based on the story of Stefan Grabiński. It is included in the form of a DVD for the autobiographical book of Tomasz Budzyński "Soul Side Story"

The last release of the band is "Toń" released in October 2015. The album is visually apocalyptic and musically is a continuation of the artistic exploration of the band.
