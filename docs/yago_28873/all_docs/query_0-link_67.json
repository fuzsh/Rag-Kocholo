        "text": "The Producers\n\nJoseph Mantegna is the founder and president of Zooma Zooma Corporation. Since 1993, the company has specialized in feature film documentaries, commercials, and music videos. After meeting President Clinton, Mantegna was chosen to direct a film that explores the ongoing search for solutions for AIDS, world hunger, and religious tolerance for his organization, the Clintoln Global Initiative. President Clinton introduced the film on Larry King/CNN.\n\nIn 2003 Mantegna produced the film Truth in Advertising, a blunt revelation of the inner thoughts of advertising companies speaking their minds. The film became a viral phenomenon. Other commercials that Mantegna produced included the ground breaking commercial \"This is your brain on drugs,\" which is included in the MoMA Permanent Collection, and other notable campaigns for advertisers such as Nike, Target, Coca‐Cola, Kodak, Sony, Revlon, Chrysler, Volkswagen, McDonalds, Cover Girl, AT&T;, Hersheys, Absolut, etc. Mantegna also produced an antidefamation message for GLAAD with actor/activist Alan Cumming.\n\nIn 2008 Mantegnas feature film debut, P‐Town Diaries premiered at Newfest in New York City. The film is an exploration of the lives and history of the art and writing community in Provincetown, MA, and is currently airing on LOGO/Viacom entertainment.\n\nMaking The Film\n\nI met Norman Mailer years ago in Provincetown, Massachusetts, at a small barbecue outside my friend's home. I watched in awe as he navigated effortlessly through a field of friends and fans. Norman was anyone and everyone; he could fit into any part of society he so desired. He was an amazing conversationalist; I liked him immediately. As soon as I got home, I jumped on the Internet and read every word I could find on Norman. I decided then to do a documentary on his life. Behind those eyes were the lives of many men, so I set out to find the real Norman Mailer, not the showman, the magician, or the shaman. The man I discovered was incredibly complex; filled with lies, contradictions, and betrayals; yet, also truth and love. Mailer lived and breathed through his writing, and produced a body of work that is unparalleled in its power and influence. He is undeniably our first literary Rock Star!"
