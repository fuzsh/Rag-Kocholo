        "text": "CANNES, France -- Move over, Steven Spielberg and Francis Coppola. Writer Norman Mailer wants to join the ranks of the big-time movie directors.\n\nHis first effort is a spine-tingler called 'Tough Guys Don't Dance,' and the filming was a good enough experience that he said he liked the director's job 'of being an aesthetic engineer.'\n\nThe two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner was at Cannes to show 'Tough Guys' for the first time in public.\n\nThe $5 million movie is a murder mystery and Mailer was already making comparisons between it and classics like 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'Chinatown.'\n\nBased on Mailer's latest novel of the same name, it stars Ryan O'Neal and Isabella Rossellini. Mailer also wrote the screenplay.\n\nThe film, shown Saturday, is a sophisticated mystery.\n\n'In the story, two women get their heads cut off and you say 'what kind of picture can this be?'' Mailer said in an interview at his beachfront hotel.\n\n'But there are no great beheading scenes in the film. It's not a 'Night of the Dead'-type movie ... But there are a lot of startling scenes and some people have said it was one of the most horrifying films they've seen.'\n\nMailer, 64, said he hopes the film, made for Cannon pictures, earns a lot of money. 'Then I can make films the way I want to,' he said. And Mailer wants to take on non-Mailer stories, not just his own books.\n\nHe said his ideal would be 'to write a book one year and do a movie the next. That would be a good way to live.'\n\nMailer is best known for his World War II novel 'The Naked and the Dead' and his last major literary work was 'Ancient Evenings,' completed after 10 years and published in 1983.\n\nWith his white hair and generous waistline, Mailer appears to have mellowed from his brash early years. He even looks grandfatherly.\n\nDoing an experimental film in the 1960s, Mailer got into an actual on-camera fight with actor Rip Torn. But the New Jersey native said that in the entire shooting of 'Tough Guys' he threw no punches and shouted only once.\n\n'There was a scene going on and somebody who was watching got so wrapped up in it that they said 'cut' before the scene was over,' Mailer said. 'I raised my voice and said 'I don't want to know who said it. I just expect that when I turn around that person will be gone.''\n\nBut is he really such a newcomer?\n\n'I've had much more theatrical background than people realize,' Mailer said. 'I've directed a couple of plays and been married to a couple of actresses. So directing actors is probably my strength.'\n\nO'Neal said that during shooting Mailer 'treats us like he's been in the picture business all his life. Norman has Actors Studio background and he writes strong dialogue. The lines are very natural, very easy to say.'\n\nMailer, not known for humility, admits to having had one problem directing. That was knowing the right location to place the cameras.\n\nRossellini said Mailer wanted her so badly for the female lead that he telephoned one morning at 3:30 a.m. to offer her the role and later even changed her character. The exotic Italian daughter of the late star Ingrid Bergman said there was no way she could play a 'middle American,' which is what the story originally called for.\n\nThe part-time model said 'I play an old girlfriend of Ryan O'Neal who is an alcoholic who wakes up one morning and understands there has been a crime and he could be the murderer. He reconstructs events and I'm a flashback. But I'm also in a few scenes in the present so I get to change my hairdo to show the passage of time.'\n\nBut she admitted 'I still haven't understood the story.'\n\nMailer said the reason she didn't understand it all was simple.\n\n'I've never seen a good mystery yet where you understand everything that happens in it,' he said. 'I defy you to tell me everything that happens in 'The Maltese Falcon' or 'Chinatown.' The same thing is true for 'Tough Guys.''\n\nMailer said he was seeking to build terror without using special effects. 'If you know the characters well, better than in the usual horror film, a little horror goes a long, long way,' he said.\n\nMailer compared the acts of writing and film directing.\n\n'In a book you have a lot of control and the only control you don't have is characters can grow away from you. In a movie it's a collaborative art. You have to be open to all the changes that are coming in, so being a director is like being an aesthetic engineer.'"
