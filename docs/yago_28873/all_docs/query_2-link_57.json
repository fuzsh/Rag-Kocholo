        "text": "In 1968, Norman Mailer directed and starred in two films, “Beyond the Law” and “Wild 90.” They’re the kind of films that bartenders play on silent to create ambience. Half unscripted and yet still stagey, they are black-and-white, suspenseless dramas shot in claustrophobic interiors; at times it’s hard to even see Mailer’s eyes under the brim of his hat.\n\nTwo years later he came out with “Maidstone,” an open-air color fantasia set in the pretty greens of East Hampton. The bastard child of “Wild in the Streets,” “Made in U.S.A.,” and “Blow-Up,” the plot concerns one Norman Kingsley (Kingsley was Mailer’s middle name), a renegade film auteur who is running for President while making a movie about a male brothel. It’s never clear if “Maidstone” is supposed to be shot in Kingsley’s style—he’s compared to Antonioni and Truffaut, which is pretty funny—but the women have tans and just about all of them go topless, including the Factory girl Ultra Violet. Last month, Criterion Collection’s Eclipse label made all three available for the first time on DVD. (Mailer’s other directorial effort, “Tough Guys Don’t Dance,” has been available on DVD since 2003.)\n\n1968 was also the year that Mailer covered the Republican and Democratic political conventions, which became the book “Miami and the Siege of Chicago,” and wrote “Armies of the Night” (both of which make for good reading in a campaign season). His films are fuelled by the same rage and sentimentality that characterize his reporting. They provide another angle into his political circus (he ran for mayor of New York City between “Wild 90” and “Maidstone”), but they’re something more than mere background or curiosities. Gorging on the man’s image and voice is a reminder of his strength as a writer that’s easiest to overlook: an awareness of his own limitations. This is a quality that his acting lacks.\n\nFreedom is a theme in these films, and Mailer exercises it any way he can. He was not unduly hampered by plot constraints. “Beyond the Law” opens with the text, “Once three guys from Brooklyn were holed up in a room and couldn’t get out for various vague reasons.” One of these guys is Mailer, of course, starring as an out-of-shape ex-fighter—Mailer was obsessed with boxing—named Prince. (This description should in no way suggest that Prince approaches the status of “character.”) They are unable to leave for reasons that seem apocalyptic and even Beckettian before they are revealed as pedestrian and Wild West. (To be fair, the saloon-style font of the title sequence should be a clue.) The men play with guns of various shapes and sizes. They drink brown liquors. The drinking, or rather, drunkenness, hastens the raison d’être of “Wild 90”—namely, it’s a recording of a vocal symphony masking as a motion picture. Every variation is practiced: shouts, screams, yells, growls, cackles, scolds, bellows, barks, yelps, hoots. Loud, flaccid threats and insults are bleated. There are quieter, more foreboding moments—the chimes and woodwinds of the orchestration—but given the poor sound quality on these discs, they’re just as impossible to make out as the grunts. The other guys manage to just talk once in a while, but Mailer is always grunting, whether he’s exhorting his fellow-criminals to “stay cool” or issuing repeated demands for “cunt.”\n\nThis, incidentally, was a word Mailer favored in his off-screen performances. I know because he said it to me, the only time I ever met him, at a publicity lunch, in 2007, for “The Castle in the Forest,” his novel about Adolf Hitler. The lunch took place at an old-boys’ steakhouse in Manhattan, where shrimp cocktail and prime rib were served with a flight of four scotches. Mailer, who was then eighty-four years old, had strength enough to work the tables. The men peppered him with Serious Questions: Mr. Mailer, what’s your take on Götz Aly? I asked how he met his wife. He locked his watery blue eyes on mine and declared, a challenge in the ring, “I’m a real cunt-licker.” Then he split his fingers into a V around his mouth and darted his tongue through it, back and forth, like a lizard, eyebrows popping off his pale face. “Oh,” I said.\n\nIt would be easy, I suppose, to conclude that Mailer liked attention, and to chalk his films up to one more way in which he forced himself on the publicity lunch that was his America. Certainly his fondness for writing and for playing the character of “Norman Mailer” has never been up for debate. But there’s an important difference between Mailer on the page and Mailer on the screen: in his writing, he very occasionally, howling and making a fuss all the time, gets out of the way. While covering Nixon in Miami, for example, he skipped a protest by the Poor People’s Campaign to go to lunch—a protest he later realizes he should have attended. To compensate for this “professional shame,” he quotes from the New York Times coverage of the event. The bland report of the protesters’ call-and-response recital of “I Am Somebody” turns out to be the strongest moment in the piece. It is powerful precisely because it interrupts Mailer’s florid descriptions and self-loathing confessions, because it happens in spite of Mailer himself—and he knows it. That’s why it’s there. His films, on the other hand, lack differentiation: there’s a mess of people, all talking at once, and an unfocussed, itinerant camera. But the character of the group is always Mailer-esque: His personality dominates, becoming everyone’s personality.\n\nEven so, to analyze these films as pure acts of ego or even political statements gives Mailer too much credit for their creation. “Beyond the Law,” “Wild 90,” and “Maidstone” are all worth watching not because of Mailer but because they’re shot by a young D. A. Pennebaker—“Beyond the Law” immediately follows the two years he spent filming Dylan for “Don’t Look Back” and the never-released “Eat the Document.” “Beyond the Law” and “Wild 90” have that same in-your-face style of handheld verité, intently concerned with how the camera can slow down time, revealing the fleeting expressions and reactions that are lost to moments. Maidstone—“about” the media spectacle of political campaigns—has a style more similar to Pennebaker’s Monterey Pop documentary, with its soft colors and lingering takes on the horsey mouths of hippie women. The big difference between Pennebaker’s music films of this period and his collaborations with Mailer, of course, is that there are more reasons to watch musicians. Otis, Ravi Shankar, and Dylan are enlarged by the camera; they can fill the screen. Mailer appears trapped, a caged animal or a small, furious bully, trying to shout his way to toughness.\n\nThe acting is awful, of course, in a way that reality television has made us all too familiar with. Pennebaker is not the cinematographer on a fiction film; he’s a documentarian of a making-of feature, as if a gifted auteur were recording a student play. (The plot of “Maidstone” is also a “behind the scenes” portrait of Norman Kingsley, which literalizes the effect.) Every scene in every film is a comment on performance itself. Mailer lurches, lumbers, rants, reels. He doesn’t bother with a story that would drum up interest or fix attention, because he knows, and you know, that you’re watching because he’s Norman Mailer. Being on camera is an excuse for him to do accents—Irish, southern, black, Texan—and make noises, avant-garde experimental vocal performances, like he was the Hugo Ball of the nineteen-sixties. The best that can be said—and who knows, maybe this is saying a lot—is that he’s having a great time.\n\nPennebaker’s camera tries to create tension, swooping in and lingering in extreme closeups. But the simple fact of getting up close is not in itself interesting, can not on its own yield any real insight or knowledge. Incredible movies were made in the sixties about people drinking or abusing drugs or arguing in small apartments—take Shirley Clarke’s “The Connection,” or everything John Cassavetes made—but those movies have stories to go with their camerawork. These stories, not surprisingly, show the shadows of hypermasuclinity, whereas Mailer revels in it. The wavering extreme closeness of “Wild 90” and “Beyond the Law” can only create and reveal the same dumb confusion that persists when the camera pulls back.\n\nIt’s in the fight sequences, and their potential to go off-script, that everyone who isn’t Mailer comes into focus. This is why the unscripted brawl between Rip Torn and Mailer that ends “Maidstone,” in which Rip insanely bashes Mailer’s head with a hammer in front of Mailer’s kids, is so justifiably famous. The intrusion of bald “real life” means that Mailer has to reckon with another person. This, I think, is what motivated his interest in violence more generally: it interrupted the constant preoccupation of being Norman Mailer, forcing him out of himself. In his writing, he could sometimes discipline himself into achieving those moments, as when he imagined the mind-set of a policeman in “Armies of the Night,” but onscreen he needed to get hit. And he was smart enough to include it in the final cut.\n\nWith Pennebaker, Mailer made films-as-happenings, hangouts for posterity: Knox, Farbar, Torn. “Beyond the Law” is brightened by a visit from George Plimpton, whose incantation, “I’m the Mayor,” suggests that even he doesn’t believe it. (One of the accused wants to know if he’s Irish, and Plimpton explains that he’s “old English”—the most believable moment in the whole hundred and ten minutes.) “Beyond the Law” is probably the best of these films—you could even mount a case that the whole thing is a comment on the “bad acting” that happens every night in police stations and between tipsy men and women in cocktail bars—though I prefer “Maidstone,” with its Godardian-Reichian fantasia of country life, political conspiracy, and general atmosphere of casually misogynist decadence. There’s nothing like the shot of Mailer lying seductively on his side, propping his head up with his hand, leather vest revealing his chubby, hairy torso. His eyelashes are surprisingly long.\n\nAnother moment worth fast-forwarding to: halfway through “Wild 90,” a couple guys (including José Torres, a Puerto Rican boxer playing “Kid Cha Cha”) stop by the apartment—it doesn’t matter why—with a German shepherd. Instead of addressing the men, Mailer crouches down and yells at the dog. “What’s your name? Huh? Who are you? Who are you?” The dog barks. Mailer barks back. The dog barks again. Mailer snarls. The dog looks around in confusion. Mailer growls. The dog steps back, restrained by his owner. Mailer gets in its face and they bark at each other for a while longer. Mailer breaks off to talk to one of the guys, and then epileptically swings his fist in the dog’s face. They bark again, together.\n\nChristine Smallwood has written for Bookforum, Harper’s, and other publications, and is a doctoral candidate in English at Columbia University.\n\nPhotograph by Inge Morath/Magnum."
