With never-before-seen archival material (including a legendary on-set row involving Mailer, Rip Torn, and a hammer), and interviews with ex-wives, children, and luminaries who knew him including Oliver Stone, John Waters, and James Wolcott.\n\n*\n\nHow the New York Times Reacted to Norman Mailer’s First Novel\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nShould Norman Mailer Have Any Legacy Beyond Being the Guy Who Stabbed His Wife?\n\nJoan Didion on Norman Mailer’s The Executioner’s Song\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Norman Mailer’s Recent (Non-)Cancellation\n\nThe Future President and the Novelist: When Norman Mailer Met John F.
