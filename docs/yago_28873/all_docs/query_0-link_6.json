Kingsley debating and attacking his hangers-on and enemies. This gonzo narrative, “an inkblot test of Mailer’s own subconscious” (Time), becomes something like a documentary on its own making when costar Rip Torn breaks the fourth wall in one of cinema’s most alarming on-screen outbursts.",

The film feels nothing more like a major ego trip for the man who writes, directs and stars in the film. Well I say he wrote it, I highly doubt that this film even had a script as although it apparently has a plot it just comes across as improvised, the soundmix is dreadful too. A lot of scenes consist of Mailer leering over naked women, which come across as really fucking unpleasant. It's easily one of the most pretentious films I have ever seen.\n\nIt can't seem to decide whether it wants to…\n\nContains the best fight scene in cinematic history. Shot by D.A.

Not as good as Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One, but the end scene really reveals something extraordinarily beautiful, like a flower that blooms in seconds and dies immediately after.\n\nWow! What a complete mess! At the same time, there are truly fascinating moments.\n\nNorman Mailer, never at a loss for expressing his viewpoint, apparently decided that there was an entire group of people he wasn’t reaching through his books. They went to the movies. The only problem is that he must have studied the films of Andy Warhol as a template from which to deliver his diatribe.\n\nMAIDSTONE is two “movies.” The first and longest part is the story of Norman T. Kingsley (“modestly” played by Norman Mailer), a “popular” director of art house films designed to shake up the Establishment. His topic for this one is about a male house of prostitution that…"
