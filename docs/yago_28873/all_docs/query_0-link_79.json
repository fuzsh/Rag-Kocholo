        "text": "“Guys who clock me in the wrong place don’t get away with it,” septuagenarian Rip Torn told a cable television interviewer. The menace in the actor’s face and voice was unmistakable.\n\nTorn, who died on 9 July at the age of 88, was not kidding around. When comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who had worked with Torn on Bee Movie, chatted in 2012 with Alec Baldwin about their “crazy” mutual friend, they recalled his anecdote about what happened when a man in a bar in Salisbury, Connecticut, “gave him the eye”.\n\nA vicious fight ensued, in which Torn was hit in the face with a bottle. He retaliated by socking one man in the jaw and then sticking a fork into another. Seinfeld and Baldwin laughed about the volatile actor’s description of this “Peckinpah-esque melee”. Rip Torn was 74 at the time.\n\nAlthough roles in blockbuster films such as Men in Black and Dodgeball brought Torn fame, his reputation rests on a wonderful six-decade career as a respected stage, television and movie actor. He was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his part as Marsh Turner in Cross Creek (1983) and won an Emmy for playing Arthur (Artie), the irascible producer on the brilliant HBO series The Larry Sanders Show.\n\nDespite his exceptional career, however, it was the wild antics that often kept him in headlines. \"I have certain flaws in my make-up. I get angry easily,” he admitted in 1974.\n\nIt wasn’t only strangers in bars he fought. One of his most notorious brawls was with writer Norman Mailer, during the making of his film Maidstone in 1970. Torn explained the background to the confrontation to Filmmakers Newsletter a year later. He said that he and the author of The Naked and the Dead had a long-standing enmity over a girl they both liked. He knew there could be trouble on set. “Mailer said when he heard my name mentioned he used to spit on the ground,” recalled Torn.\n\nTorn was also working as an associate director on Maidstone and had not slept much for five days when he was due to film a key scene with star actor and director Mailer. The pair were supposed to argue but Torn suddenly struck the author on the head with a heavy toy hammer. With the camera still rolling, they started wrestling on floor and Mailer bit Torn’s ear during the unscripted fight. “The lacerations on my ear were minor,” Torn said, laughing off the incident.\n\nThe actor born Elmore Rual Torn Jr on 6 February 1931 in Temple, Texas, said he took the nickname Rip, because it was a family one handed down by his father, uncle and cousin. Torn graduated in agriculture (from Texas A&M) and drama (University of Texas) before being drafted and serving as a military policeman during the Korean War. When he returned to America, he hitchhiked to Hollywood, supporting himself with a range of menial jobs. “My mother said, ‘Promise me you won't wind up in the gutter,’” Torn recalled. “‘But Mom,’ I told her, ‘that's where you start.’” The worst job was washing dishes, he later said, and the best was being a caddy at a golf clubs, holding big umbrellas over female players when they needed shade.\n\nTorn was proud of having been trained in Texas by renowned Shakespeare professor B Iden Payne and always spoke admiringly of stage actors. “To be a complete actor you have to get out on the stage,” said Torn, “but I sure love the money in the movies.” In the Sixties, he appeared in numerous celebrated films, including King of Kings, The Cincinnati Kid, Pay Day, The Man Who Fell to Earth and Defending Your Life. Jeffrey Tambor, who worked with him on The Larry Sanders Show, called Torn “a walking acting lesson”.\n\nHe was a charismatic man with a prestigious and typically curious range of friends. In New York, he worked out at Sig Klein's gym alongside Laurence Olivier – who told him he was beefing up to compete with Kirk Douglas in Spartacus – and was pals with Tennessee Williams, Judy Garland, John Wayne and Lena Horne. He was also close to the famously prickly jazz star Miles Davis. The pair once cooked for a large dinner party using fowl that Torn, a lifelong hunter, had shot in LA’s Imperial Valley. “Miles didn't like many folks but we were friends,” said Torn. “I lived across the street from him.” Torn was also friends with Willie Nelson and gave the introduction when the musician was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nAfter earning the Oscar nomination in 1984, his drinking and reputation for volatility started to count against him within Hollywood and he sometimes struggled to land good roles in the late Eighties. It was not until he was cast by comedian Garry Shandling in The Larry Sanders Show – which ran from 1992 to 1998 – that he had a late career revival which would eventually earn him numerous high-paid roles, including as Louis XV in Sofia Coppola’s acclaimed Marie Antoinette, and as the voice of Zeus in Disney's Hercules.\n\nTorn was magnificent as Artie, the cynical, manipulative producer of Shandling’s fictional talk show. He delivers witty, caustic lines with true comedic timing. In one episode, when he is talking to a janitor long after the TV studio has emptied, Artie says, “Dimitri, my man, you and I both clean up s--- for a living. The only difference is my s--- talks back.” Artie boasts that he speaks “fluent b-------” and Torn said he portrayed the character that way to highlight the phoniness of the showbusiness industry. “In showbiz, producers legendarily have to be not only two-faced, but 10- or 12-faced people to get things done. And they are going to tell anybody what is needed to get the job done,” Torn said.\n\nThe role as Artie, which suited his gift for ad-libbing, brought him six Emmy nominations in all. He earned a further primetime Emmy nomination for his part in Tina Fey’s hit comedy 30 Rock. Sadly, in his final decade, his alcohol dependency increased. He arrested for drunk driving in 2008. The alcohol education programmes he was sent on did not work. In January 2010, Connecticut State Police found the “highly intoxicated” actor inside a (closed) bank, in Salisbury, with a loaded gun in his pocket. The 78-year-old had broken a rear window and later told police he thought it was his home. He pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment, criminal trespass and the illegal carrying of a firearm and was handed a two and half year suspended sentence.\n\nAt the time, friends were shocked by his growing paranoia. He would often talk about how “they” were out to get him and frequently brought up the misdeeds of the Nixon administration. The only times Torn seemed at peace was when he was gardening at his weekend home in Connecticut, a place he liked to spend time in with his third wife, the actress Amy Wright, with whom he had two of his six children.\n\nDespite all the controversies, he should be remembered for his accomplishments – and the better parts of his character. Torn worked hard to racially integrate the theatre world in an era of segregation. He was noted for his encouragement to young black writer James Baldwin. At Baldwin's invitation, Torn met Attorney General Robert F Kennedy in 1963 to discuss integration, a meeting that prompted the FBI to put Torn on a watch-list. The actor late became a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War.\n\nTorn, who played Macbeth and Hamlet on stage, said that one of the great thrills of his life was visiting Shakespeare’s birthplace in Stratford and he never lost his love of acting. He would talk enthusiastically to students at film festivals about his craft. “I always used to start with how somebody walks, because every walks differently,” said Torn. Artie had his own bouncing swagger. And so did Rip Torn. RIP Rip."
