        "text": "From Monthly Film Bulletin, September 1975, Vol. 42, No. 500.\n\nIt’s good to see Norman Mailer’s first three features just out in a two-disc DVD set from Eclipse (it would be great if Criterion could eventually do the same for Susan Sontag’s three fiction features), even though I regret that my two favorite Mailer films — his untitled, ten-minute experimental short from 1947 (recently discovered by archivist Michael Chaiken, who wrote the excellent and provocative notes for the Eclipse set, and which I saw last July at Il Cinema Ritrovato) and Tough Guys Don’t Dance (1987) — aren’t included. (Admittedly, I haven’t yet seen all of Maidstone, which Chaiken makes the most claims for, so these rankings on my part are still subject to revision.)…In his Eclipse notes, Chaiken describes Will the Real Norman Mailer Please Stand Up? [sic] as “a filmed counterpart to The Armies of the Night“, which parallels my own observation here. — J.R.\n\nWill the Real Norman Mailer Please Stand Up\n\nCanada, 1968\n\nDirector: Dick Fontaine\n\nDist—The Other Cinema. p.c–Allan King Associates. For National\n\nEducational Television, British Broadcasting Corporation, Canadian\n\nBroadcasting Corporation, Bayerischer Rundfunk. exec. p–Allan King,\n\nRoger Graef. p/sc—Dick Fontaine. ph–Richard Leiterman. In colour.\n\ned—Stephen Milne. Song–“The Eve of Destruction” by and sung by\n\nBob Dylan. sd–Russel Helse, Mike Billing. p. assistants–Jeffrey Edward,\n\nGwen Gillie, Judith Marriott, Mark Peploe, Toni Trow. with–Norman\n\nMailer, James Toback, Robert Lowell, Dwight Macdonald, Beverly\n\nBentley, Merv Griffin, Barry McGuire. 2,182 ft. 61 mins. (16 mm.).\n\nNorman Mailer is presented in a series of his public roles, each\n\nidentified by a superimposed title and intermixed with verbal and\n\nvisual snatches of Barry McGuire, a fast-talking Washington disc\n\njockey who occasionally alludes to the ‘media events’ featuring\n\nMailer. THE NOVELIST: Mailer is interviewed on TV by James\n\nToback after the publication of Why Are We in Vietnam? and talks\n\nabout modern heroes. THE DIRECTOR: He prepares a line-up\n\nscene in his film Beyond the Law. THE ACTOR: He performs in the\n\nscene. THE ACTOR & HIS WIFE: A different sequence in the\n\nfinished film, with Mailer and his wife Beverly Bentley quarreling\n\nin a restaurant. THE CITIZEN: Mailer addresses a group of draft-\n\ncard burners in Washington prior to the October 1967 March to the\n\nPentagon. THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES: Drunk on bourbon, he\n\nimitates Lyndon Johnson and introduces Robert Lowell at a rally\n\nbefore the march; this is followed by a brief quote from Time\n\nMagazine’s coverage of the event. An untitled sequence details\n\nMailer’s participation in the march itself and his subsequent\n\nvoluntary arrest. VIRGINIA — THE STATE PENITENTIARY:\n\nMailer emerges from prison and is questioned by reporters. THE\n\nPREACHER: He concludes his statement by dictating a “sermon”\n\nabout Jesus Christ and the war in Vietnam to the journalists; later\n\nhe reads the Washington Post‘s coverage of this speech. THE\n\nCELEBRITY: He appears as a guest on The Merv Griffin Show,\n\nintroduced as the author of What Are We Doing in Vietnam?, and\n\nproceeds to deliver a heated denunciation of the war; in a bar, men\n\nare shown watching the TV programme and then making semi-\n\ncoherent comments about Mailer after one of them angrily\n\ndisconnects the set.\n\nA uniquely valuable document and educational tool, Dick\n\nFontaine’s carefully crafted portrait of Norman Mailer in 1967-8\n\noffers at once an essential companion piece to Mailer’s book The\n\nArmies of the Night and an intriguing contrast to Godard and\n\nGorin’s Letter to Jane — with which it might make a fruitful double-\n\nbill — in its broaching of questions about the role of intellectual\n\nmedia figures in protesting U.S. involvement in Vietnam. From\n\n‘THE CITIZEN’ onwards, all the episodes described above receive\n\nindependent treatment in Mailer’s book; and because both book\n\nand film are concerned with the impact and distortion of events in\n\nand through the media, a dense and ambiguous interplay is set up\n\nbetween the versions offered by (1) the media, in the form of TV\n\nappearances, radio announcements and newspaper and magazine\n\ncoverage, much of which is cited by book and film alike, using the\n\nsame examples, (2) Mailer’s alternate reports in the book of his\n\nspeeches and the various events, and (3) the film’s own rendering of\n\nthe above phenomena, which often differs sharply from (1) and (2).\n\nFor one thing, Fontaine has altered the chronology of some events-\n\nthe filming of Beyond the Law occurred after the Pentagon March,\n\nnot before, and the evening rally preceded rather than followed\n\nMailer’s address to the draft-card burners — and has apparently\n\nstaged certain others (Mailer reading the Washington Post, the\n\nbarroom conversation, a few of McGuire’s interjections). On the\n\nother hand, many of the actual speeches delivered by Mailer in the\n\nfilm come across quite differently from either the media or the Mailer\n\nreports of them, in detail as well as in overall effect, suggesting how\n\nreadily one man’s documentary can become another man’s\n\nconfection. A particularly ironic aspect of the film’s title is the fact that\n\nthe “real Norman Mailer”, i.e. the writer — the single role which\n\nmakes all the others possible or plausible — is the role to which\n\nfilm and media seem least attentive: Why Are We in Vietnam? is\n\nused as a topical launching pad in one TV appearance, the title is\n\nblithely mangled in another, and The Armies of the Night (which\n\npresumably appeared after the film was completed) is not mentioned\n\nat all. In terms of the contrasts implied by Fontaine’s arrangement\n\nof events, Mailer appears in turn pompous, modest, stupid, brilliant,\n\nblustering, graceful, incoherent and eloquent from one sequence to\n\nthe next, like a perpetually developing fictional character. As in The\n\nArmies of the Night, a concentrated focus on these juxtapositions\n\neffectively renders the Vietnam war peripheral, or at any rate\n\nsecondary to the issue of how a famous author bears witness to it: “I\n\nwasn’t Lyndon Johnson’s alter-ego for nothing” Mailer remarks on his\n\nway out of jail, neatly fusing his solipsism with the film’s own media\n\nconceits (while Fontaine alternately links him with the disc jockey\n\nMcGuire). All this transpires under the late Sixties spell of Marshall\n\nMcLuhan, which guarantees a perpetual confusion between\n\ndiagnosis and symptom. (It is worth noting that Will the Real Norman\n\nMailer Please Stand Up was made for TV networks in four countries,\n\nand is thus an integral part of the pop media it describes.) Yet taken\n\nin conjunction with Mailer’s book it offers a fascinating\n\ndemonstration of how all versions of an event — no matter how\n\nconscientious or ‘truthful’ — are none the less versions, and potential\n\ngrist for any number of independent mills.\n\nJONATHAN ROSENBAUM"
