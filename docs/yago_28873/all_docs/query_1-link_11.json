        "text": "Norman Mailer’s third feature, shot in 1968—a three-ring circus of psychodramatic improvisations with himself at the center—exerts an extraordinary extra-cinematic fascination. In the first ring, Mailer stars as Norman T. Kingsley, a celebrity art-house movie director who is making an improvised “sexploitation” film about a male brothel for female clients—and, meanwhile, is planning to run for President. The second ring involves Kingsley’s entourage of revolutionaries, the Cashbox, headed by his half brother Rey (Rip Torn). The third concerns a para-governmental agency that, fearing Kingsley’s loose-cannon candidacy, is plotting to assassinate him. Keeping the camera largely on himself, Mailer lets fly with apocalyptic speculations on politics, sex, marriage, and metaphysics, yet he saves the best for last. He convenes the cast for a group discussion of the work they did together, and then, as the troupe begins to disperse, Rip Torn, reverting to character, attacks Mailer with a hammer in the presence of Mailer’s wife and children. This horror version of home movies is both irresistible and terrifying, as is the spectacle of a great writer playing lightly with his genius. (BAM; Oct. 30)"
