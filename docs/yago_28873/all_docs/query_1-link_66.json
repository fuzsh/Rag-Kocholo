        "text": "A Netflix movie filmed in Kent which starred a number of famous names has scooped a prize at this year's Oscars.\n\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar features Benedict Cumberbatch, Ralph Fiennes, Sir Ben Kingsley and Richard Ayoade.\n\nThe 39-minute adventure and comedy short film was shot at Maidstone Film Studios, at Vinters Business Park, throughout 2022.\n\nReleased by streaming giants Netflix on September 27, it won Best Live Action Short Film at the 96th Academy Awards.\n\nDirected and written by Wes Anderson, the short film was shot in the 12,000 sq ft Studio One at Maidstone, as well as the 6,000 sq ft Studio Two.\n\nIt is adapted from a number of short stories released in the 1977 collection The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More by Roald Dahl.\n\nThe story involves a wealthy man who enjoys gambling and is able to see through objects and predict the future with the help of a book.\n\nA spokesman for the studios said filming took place with \"several outdoor sets constructed within our backlot, and production made use of many of our ancillary spaces for hair, make-up, props and catering, to create the perfect setting for the story of The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar to be told”.\n\nChairman and owner of Maidstone Studios, Geoff Miles, previously told business magazine Televisual: “We are enormously proud and delighted to have worked with Wes Anderson and Indian Paintbrush on their latest short film for Netflix.\n\n\"It was an absolute pleasure to work with such a talented team across the year and on such an iconic Roald Dahl story.\"\n\nIt premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 1 ahead of its release on Netflix in the autumn.\n\nThe New Cut Road studio has a long history of filming TV and movie hits, including ITV's Catchphrase and Family Fortunes, plus Later... With Jools Holland.\n\nThis year's Oscars, which finished in the early hours of yesterday morning in the UK after being hosted at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, featured 23 categories honouring films released in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, eagled-eyed Guy Ritchie fans have already spotted a couple of Kent filming locations in the director’s latest Netflix hit, The Gentlemen.\n\nThe eight-part crime-drama series, starring The White Lotus and The Inbetweeners Move actor Theo James, is based on the 2019 film of the same name."
