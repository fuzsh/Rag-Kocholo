        "meta_description": "Winner - Best Documentary - Atlanta Jewish Film Festival 2024\r\nHOW TO COME ALIVE with Norman Mailer explores the rollercoaster life of America&rsquo;s most controversial and bestselling author of the 20th Century, Norman Mailer. Propelled by his tremendous ego and contrarian spirit, Mailer&rsquo;s ceaseless visibility in the public eye lasted 6 decades, during which he had 6 tumultuous marriages, 9 beloved children, 11 bestsellers, 3 arrests, and 2 Pulitzer Prizes. Prophet, hedonist, violent criminal, literary outlaw, and social provocateur, Mailer&rsquo;s ideas about love, anger, fear, and courage cut to the core of human nature, are more relevant than ever today, and point to a prescription for waking ourselves up, shaking free of society&rsquo;s expectations, and coming alive as a people. \r\nThe first project with full access to Mailer&rsquo;s family and their archive, the film unearths a treasure trove of intimate and never-before-seen footage, outtakes, audio recordings, and interviews from throughout his life. Mailer lays himself bare, foibles and all. As a lover, fighter, rabble-rouser, and perhaps the last true American public intellectual, he seeks most of all to become a bolder, better human being and encourages us to do the same &mdash; to think adventurously, speak fearlessly, and care less about the response... or risk a doomed future.\r\nHOW TO COME ALIVE with Norman Mailer is a Zeitgeist Films release in association with Kino Lorber and opened in theaters on June 28, 2024. To book this film please contact Nancy Gerstman&nbsp;or&nbsp;Emily Russo.\r\nA press kit, trailer, stills, jpegs of the poster and social media assets are or will be available to download from our Exhibition DropBox.
