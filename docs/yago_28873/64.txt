Maidstone is a 1970 independent film directed by Norman Mailer, an American novelist and journalist who also stars in the movie alongside actor Rip Torn and Mailer's longtime collaborator Paul Austin. The film follows the story of a hedonistic director played by Mailer who decides to run for President of the United States. Filmmaker and artist Norman Kingsley (played by Torn) is commissioned to make a documentary about Mailer's campaign, but soon their collaboration turns into a violent and chaotic struggle for power.

The film is shot in a documentary-style format, with many of the scenes seemingly improvised by the actors. The storyline blurs the lines between fiction and reality, as it incorporates elements of Mailer's real-life persona and his interest in politics. There is an experimental quality to the film that is both intriguing and unsettling, as the characters' interactions feel raw and unpredictable. The filmmakers make use of techniques such as jump cuts, close-ups, and long takes to create a sense of immediacy and intensity.

The film opens with Mailer's character, a successful and egotistical director named Norman T. Kingsley, at his home in New York. He is surrounded by a group of sycophants who admire his work and eagerly await his next project. However, Norman is restless and decides to embark on a new venture: running for President of the United States. He believes that his celebrity status and unconventional approach will appeal to the masses and ultimately lead to his victory.

Norman hires his friend and fellow artist, Raoul Rey O'Houlihan (played by Austin), as his press secretary. Raoul is a flamboyant character who revels in the attention that Norman's campaign attracts. He encourages Norman to be even more bold and unapologetic in his speeches, despite the fact that they often offend people. Meanwhile, Norman hires Kingsley to make a documentary about his campaign, believing that his talents as a filmmaker will be an asset to his candidacy.

However, as the campaign progresses, tensions between the three men begin to rise. Norman's erratic behavior and egotism start to alienate those around him, while Kingsley's cynical view of politics clashes with Norman's idealism. Raoul, meanwhile, becomes increasingly disenchanted with the campaign, and his own personal life begins to unravel.

The film culminates in a chaotic and violent confrontation between the three men. The scene, which is shot in a single take, is unsettling and unpredictable, with the actors seemingly improvising their lines and actions. The film ends with a sense of ambiguity, leaving the audience to speculate on the fate of the characters.

Maidstone is a challenging and unconventional film that defies easy categorization. It is part political satire, part character study, and part experimental film. The themes of power, ego, and ambition are explored in a way that is both thought-provoking and disturbing. The film's use of improvisation and documentary techniques lends it an air of authenticity and immediacy that is rare in mainstream cinema. While not for everyone, Maidstone is a unique and arresting work that is sure to leave a lasting impression on those who see it.
