        "text": "John Fitch (born January 21, 1743, Windsor, Connecticut, U.S.—died July 2, 1798, Bardstown, Kentucky) was a pioneer of American steamboat transportation who produced serviceable steamboats before Robert Fulton.\n\nFitch served in the American Revolution (1775–83) and later surveyed land along the Ohio River. Settling in Bucks county, Pennsylvania, in 1785, he became interested in building steamboats. He sought and failed to obtain subsidies from the Continental Congress, but he later succeeded in receiving exclusive rights from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware to build and operate steamboats on their waters. Backed by Philadelphia financiers, he built a 45-foot (14-metre) craft that had a successful trial on the Delaware River on August 22, 1787, before a group of delegates to the Constitutional Convention. He then built a larger steamboat to carry passengers and freight. Propelled by paddle wheels, it made well-advertised, regularly scheduled trips between Philadelphia and Burlington, New Jersey. After a battle with James Rumsey over claims to invention, Fitch was granted a U.S. patent for steamboats on August 26, 1791, and a French patent the same year."
