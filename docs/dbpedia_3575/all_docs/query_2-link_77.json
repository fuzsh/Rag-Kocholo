He was mentioned in his father’s will in 1605 as “my eldest son.” He inherited an estate near Braintree, Essex, England. He was involved in a number of land transactions. His will was dated Dec. 11, 1632, proved Feb. 12, 1632/33.\n\nThe Fitch family traces its first settlement in England to the era of the Norman Conquest A.D. 1066. Morant’s “History of County Essex, England,” says that ‘Robert Gernon or de Gernon came from France along with William the Conqueror and that he was a relative of the Conqueror and of the House of Bologne. One of his sons took the name of de Montfitchet, or de Montifiquet – the name is written these three ways in the Doomsday Book.\n\nAncestry\n\nThomas’ grandparents were Roger FITCH & Margery [__?__] Roger, will 12 Jan. 1558/59; d. Panfield, Essex; will proved Consistory Court, London 22 Feb. 1558/59; m. Margery[__?__]. Admitted tenant of Hartshede, his mother’s lands in Lindsell, 25 Sep 153\n\nThomas’ great grandparents were Thomas FITCH & Agnes ALGER Thomas Fitch was born about 1465 at Fitche Castle?, Essex, England, because he was said to be three years old at the time his father’s death was reported at the manor court of Widdington on 9 April 1468. He was admitted to his inheritance at Widdington court 9 Nov 1487, i.e., when he was about 21 years old. Thomas married Agnes Algore before 22 Dec1490 when they received land from her parents, Robert and Margaret Algore. Agnes was the only child and heiress of her father. She brought Brazen Head Farm in Lindsell, Essex, to the marriage. In the same year, Agnes received more land when her mother, Margaret Algore, died. In 1497, Thomas received an additional grant of land at the manor court of Lindsell Hall, and in Nov 1505, he took possession of land, which his father John had left in custody of his widowed mother, Juliana.\n\nThomas died, 21 April 1514, as commemorated on a brass in the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Lindsell. Agnes died before 3 May 1527. Beneath them on the brass are images of eleven children ~ six sons and five daughters.\n\nOn the floor before the chancel arch is a well engraved and perfectly preserved brass of the Fytch family inscribed:\n\n“Here lie Thomas ffytch and Agnes his wife which same Thomas died the 21st day of April in the year of our Lord 1514. On whose souls may God have mercy.”\n\nA good description of the brass is provided by Christy:\n\n“The male figure (16 1/2 inches in height) has a half-turn to the left; is bare-headed, his long hair falling upon his shoulders; and his upraised hands, instead of being placed together as usual, are held apart. He is attired in the long gown of a civilian, beneath which his broad round-toed shoes are just apparent. It is open and turned back at the neck and down the front, showing the lining of the fur, which is also apparent at the wrists, where the extremely wide, open sleeves are turned back into cuffs. The female figure (16 1/2 inches in height) has a half-turn to the right, and the hands are placed together. Her long gown, cut low at the neck, fur-trimmed at the bottom, and having tight sleeves, turned back at the wrists into broad cuffs, which are fur covered, is loosely confined at the waist by a girdle, of which the ornamentally embroidered end falls nearly to the ground. She wears the pedimental head-dress.\n\nThe six sons (about 4 3/4 inches in height) are placed beneath their father,\n\nwhile the five daughters (about 4 1/2 inches in height) are placed beneath their mother.\n\nThe former have a half-turn to the left: the latter, to the right. Both wear costumes almost exactly similar to those of their parents, except that the gowns of the sons lack fur trimming, while the costumes of the daughters lack both fur trimming and the ceinture, and their head-dresses, having no backs, allow their long hair to fall down their backs to far below the level of the waist.” The inscription (on a plate 17 by 2 1/2 inches) immediately below the principal figure reads: Translated: Here lies Thomas Fytche and Agnes his wife, which same Thomas died the twenty-first day of April, in the year of our Lord 1514; on whose souls may God have mercy.”\n\nThomas and Agnes are also commemorated in a stained glass window in the same church. This window, and a second showing their son William and his first wife, Elizabeth, were probably paid for by William, who had the advowson of the church (the right to be the patron of the church and to recommend its clergyman) from King Henry VIII.\n\nExcept for Thomas’ and Agnes’ second son, William, who prospered and had three knighted descendants, the other children were somewhat less prosperous. According to Wagner, By the early seventeenth century they had included apothecaries, clothiers and cloth makers [like our Thomas], staplers and leather sellers, several clergymen and a naval surgeon.\n\nThomas’ great-great grandparents were John FYCHE and Juliana [__?__]. John FYCH, FYCCHE, FYTCHE (William) was born no later than 1437, because in 1467 he was said to be “aged 30 years and more” First mentioned on a Court Plea in 1458, which said he was “of Wykyn.”[2] On 14 May 1467, he was again acknowledged as son and next heir and admitted to his father’s estate; and, on the same day, he received additional grants of land. He married Juliana ______. John’s death was reported at the court session of 9 April 1468, at which time it was stated that “Thomas is his son and next heir and aged three years.” Custody of the land was given to Juliana, who later married Richard Westley. She probably died about 1475, because a 1505 court record indicates that at that time she had been dead for 30 years.\n\nThomas’ 3rd Great Grandfather was William FECCHE, FICCHE, FYCCHE, FICHE, FYCHE, FYTCHE, FITCHE* of Wicken Bonhunt, Essex Co., England. First mentioned on the Plea Rolls of 1428. Received grants of land at the manor court of Widdington in 1440/1 and in 1458/9. Death reported at Widdington court on 24 April 1466.[2] Wife’s name unknown. The court post mortem inquisition stated that “John Fytche is son and next heir of the same William.”\n\nAnna’s great grandparents were John BROCK & Agnes WISEMAN\n\nAnna’s grandparents were William BROCK & Margery BEDELL\n\nChildren\n\n1. Thomas Fitch\n\nThomas’ first wife Anne Stacie was born 1611 in Essex, England. Her parents were William Stacie and Anne Garrold.
