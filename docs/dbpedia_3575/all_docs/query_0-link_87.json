        "text": "Fitch's Old Soldiers Home Cemetery, Darien,CT\n\nThese records have been contributed by Fairfield County, CT researcher Barbara Kaye. The data has been collected from several sources, including the Hale Cemetery Collection (see history, below).\n\nWe need you! If you live near a cemetery in Fairfield County, CT and wish to contribute data or add additional information to an existing cemetery collection, please email Barbara Kaye. She will see to it that your information is added. If you are interested in volunteering to transcribe other cemetery records, we'll help get you started!\n\nThe Charles R.Hale Collection of Headstone Inscriptions resides at the Connecticut State Library. Charles Hale was a member of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. In 1916, he became involved in locating and decorating the graves of Revolutionary and Civil War veterans in his home town of Rocky Hill. In order to make it easier to find these graves, he decided to record each veteran's name, date of death and military service. He was persuaded by State Librarian George S. Godard to search also for veterans of other wars.\n\nIn 1919, the General Assembly made an appropriation to carry on this work throughout the State. In 1933 and 1934, with grants from the F.E.R.A. and the W.P.A., Mr. Hale began copying and indexing the essential information from every headstone in the State. Two copies of these listings were deposited in the State Library. Records for individual towns were made available to libraries and historical societies throughout Connecticut.\n\nNote: These records may contain errors in dates or names. Some errors were made either at the time of the survey of the cemeteries or during the transcription in 1935. One common error in reading old headstones is mistaking a four for a one.We have tried very hard to avoid creating new errors during the retyping of this data for the internet. In addition, we have attempted to correct some of the original errors, either by revisiting these cemeteries or by recalculating dates or ages based on known dates of birth for some of thesepeople. However, some of the stones that were legible in 1934 are either missing or no longer legible.\n\nI have also attempted to identify these people, using census and other vital records. Anything added within brackets like these [ ] indicates a suggestion as to the identity of the person. If a wife's name does not include a separate surname, it is not known at this time. Many couples in early Darien were second or third cousins with the same surname. There are many surnames that have several alternate spellings. (See spellings for a list of common surnames and their alternate spellings.) Some people appear in more than one listing because some graves were moved to newer cemeteries, new stones were carved, and the old stones were left behind. Although much of the data on the various families in early Darien is accurate, there will always be errors, many of which are found in published genealogies. It is recommended that you write to the Town Clerk's office for death or birth certificates for your ancestors. If you have documentation that supplies any missing information or corrects an error, please email Barbara Kaye .
