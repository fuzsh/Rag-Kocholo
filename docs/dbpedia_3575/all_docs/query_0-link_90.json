        "text": "The 2nd Regiment of Militia was a Connecticut Colony militia regiment that served in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe 2nd Regiment was formed in 1739 following a restructuring of Connecticut's militia. It represented a military district consisting of New Haven, Milford, Branford and Derby.[1] In March 1775, the General Assembly session looked into the state of the militia among other matters. Captain Abraham Blackslee was placed under investigation over allegations of being openly critical of the General Assembly and its conduct, an indicator of Loyalist beliefs. In a follow-up meeting in May, he was stripped of his rank and dismissed from the militia.[2] It was also declared that a second company of Governor's Guards be raised from the men of New Haven.[3] In May 1776 it was declared that the Troop of Horse of the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th, 10th and 23rd regiments be amalgamated into the new 1st Regiment of Light Horse.[4]\n\nIn October 1776, Colonel Fitch resigned, and was replaced by Colonel Joseph Thomson, with Lt. Col. Benjamin Fenn and Major Edward Russell as his second and third.[5]\n\nIn December 1776, the 2nd increased its garrison in New Haven; while the port town was regularly being used for prison exchanges, the Council of Safety was concerned the lack of cannon would leave open to attack. In February 1778, the Council of Safety ordered for additional protection for New Haven, with 24 men from several nearby militia companies forming a detachment to guard it, under a Lieutenant.[6]\n\nIn May 1782 it was ruled that the companies of Branford and Guilford, formerly of the 2nd and 7th regiments, be transferred to the 28th Regiment in order to balance out the sizes of each regiment.[7]\n\nOfficers[]\n\nHeadquarters\n\nColonel Joseph Thomson (October 1776)[5]\n\nColonel Jonathan Fitch (October 1775, resigned October 1776)[8]\n\nColonel Leverett Hubbard (October
