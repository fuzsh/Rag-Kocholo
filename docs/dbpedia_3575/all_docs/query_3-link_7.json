He married Susannah Whiting, widow of William Whiting of Hartford CT. Samuel died in 1659 probably in Milford, CT.\n\nBiographical sketch: Samuel was an emigrant ancester of Hartford, CT. born at Bocking, County Essex, England. He probably came to America in the company of his two brothers, Thomas I of Norwalk, CT. and Joseph of Windsor, CT. and their widowed mother, Anne (Reeve) Fitch. They were preceded by their brother Rev. James Fitch of Norwich, CT., who came to New England in 1638.\n\nSavage, the historian, says that there is a possibility that Samuel Fitch I settled at Milford, CT., as early as 1644. This is unlikely, however, as he is named in the will of his brother Nathaniel in 1648 as then living in England.\n\nThe earliest positive record we have of him is in 1650 at Hartford, CT. He was spoken of in the records of his time as \"Mr.\", which proves he ranked as a gentleman. He was engaged in 1650 to keep the school at Hartford for three years, beginning 1 Jan 1649/50; and was a freeman, 1651. He was later of Milford, CT.\n\nLike his three brothers he was a man of prominence in local affairs. He was a representative to the General Court, 1654-55. He married Mrs. Susannah Whiting, widow of \"Worshipful Mr. William Whiting\" of Hartford, CT. Samuel Fitch and his wife had two sons; Samuel II and Thomas I. After his death in 1659 his widow married (3) Alexander Bryan of Milford, CT.\n\nSamuel came to America with two of his brothers and his mother, after the death of his father . He taught school in Hartford, CT, and later at Milford. He was a Representative to the Gene ral Court 1654-1655.Samuel became a Free man in 1651, and became prominent in local affairs . In the local records, he was given the distinguishing title \"Mr.\" (Source: Connecticut Ance stry, Vol. 26, #4, page 191).\n\nhttp://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=franlouis...\n\nID: I01711 Name: Samuel Fitch 1 Sex: M Birth: 9 NOV 1626 in Bocking, Essex, England Birth: 9 NOV 1626 in Bocking, , Essex, England 1 Death: 1659 in ,Hartford, CT Death: 1659 in , Hartford, Connecticut, USA 1 Note: Samuel Fitch was schoolmaster in Hartford, Conn., as early as 1650. He served as Deputy (Representative) for Hartford to the General Court (Legistlature) in 1654 and 1655. He married Susannah, widow of William Whiting, of Hartford, and they had two sons.\n\nOne of them, Thomas, lived in Wethersfield, Conn. On Sept. 15, 1680, he married Abigail Goodrich, the daughter of William Goodrich and Sarah Marvin, who was born June 5, 1662 and died Nov. 8, 1684. They had three children, of whom only Abigail survived. It is believed that Abigail was raised by her maternal grandmother, Mrs. Sarah (Marvin) Goodrich. Abigail married Abraham Kimberly. The probate of Thomas Fitch in 1704 mentioned the daughter Abigail, the wife of Abraham Kimberly.\n\nSamuel came to America with two of his brothers and his mother, after the death of his father.
