        "text": "Students can use Bluebook™ on school-managed and personal iPads that meet device requirements.\n\nKeeping Bluebook Up to Date\n\nTesting requires the latest version of Bluebook. If deployed properly, Bluebook performs routine updates when students launch it but releases occasionally require a new deployment. If Bluebook cannot auto-update, a message displays that reinstallation is needed before students can test.\n\nFind out if you need to update Bluebook.\n\nSchool-Managed Installation\n\nBefore You Start\n\nCheck device requirements to make sure your iPads can support testing on Bluebook.\n\nOptions\n\nBluebook for iPad is available in the app store. You have two options for installing the app on school-managed iPads:\n\nAllow student download from the app store. If your device policy allows it, enable students to download the app themselves.\n\nDeploy the app to multiple devices. Use your mobile device management (MDM) platform to distribute the app. Be sure to enable forced updates. If that’s not an option, enable the app to auto-update.\n\nGet Bluebook in the app store.\n\nNote: Bluebook is called “Bluebook Exams” in the app store.\n\nRequired Settings\n\nDisable guided access mode. Guided access mode can interfere with assessment mode, which is a requirement for successful Bluebook testing. If your school uses Apple Classroom or other applications that invoke guided access, you can enable it again after your school completes testing.\n\nDisable guided access manually at Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access or use your MDM platform to temporarily disable the feature for your whole fleet.\n\nEnable forced updates. If Bluebook tries to auto-update on test day and it can’t, students won’t be able to test. Check your MDM platform settings.\n\nRemove or disable applications and processes that launch on startup or run in the background. Students using Bluebook on devices running Grammarly or other software will be unable to test.\n\nCheck Your Installation\n\nTake these steps to make sure students can take the test and submit their answers on test day:\n\nConfirm the Bluebook version on a student device. Open Bluebook on one of the testing devices you deployed to and compare the version number displayed on the sign-in screen to the version listed on Bluebook Updates.\n\nOptional: Spot-check student devices. Open Bluebook on some of your testing devices and click Test Your Device on the sign-in screen to find out if they meet minimum requirements.\n\nStudent Download from College Board\n\nStudents who test on personal devices should go to bluebook.app.collegeboard.org on their testing device to download Bluebook. The download page will detect their device type and provide the right instructions.\n\nStudents who test on school-managed devices can also download Bluebook themselves if your policy allows it."
