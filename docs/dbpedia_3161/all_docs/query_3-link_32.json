        "text": "Essential Concepts\n\nGPS consists of three segments: (1) the space segment of typically 30 satellites that transmit microwave ranging signals and signals containing information on satellite positions and satellite atomic clock time; (2) the control segment of globally distributed stations that monitor, control, and upload data to the space segment; and (3) the user segment consisting of anybody with a GPS receiver who uses the space segment to find their position (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2008).\n\nGeodetic coordinates, such as those obtained by GPS measurements, are generally defined with respect to some reference system that comprises measurement techniques, models, computational formulas, conventions, recommendations, and reference frame coordinates, which together allows users to compute their positions at any time and location within errors and limitations that might be specified (Moritz, 1980). By their very nature, GPS reference systems are global in scale, transcending international boundaries. Although continental or national reference systems are often derived from the global reference systems to satisfy national requirements, the mathematical relationship between the smaller-scale systems and the global systems is precisely specified. Hence, GPS coordinates can be meaningfully compared between any points on or near the Earthâs surface, be they on land, sea, or in the air.\n\nTypical positioning precision is at the level of meters for casual users. For scientific users implementing geodetic technology and methodology, the positioning precision can be improved to the level of millimeters. This improvement is made possible in part through the implementation of geodetic reference systems of a much higher accuracy than the operational reference system implemented by GPS.\n\nTo determine the GPS coordinates of any measured point first requires the definition of a reference frame , which is a specially selected global network of accurately measured points with defined Cartesian coordinates. The reference frame is said to ârealizeâ a reference system, in the sense that it provides a tangible basis for the computation of positions in the system (Moritz, 1980). In turn, these GPS reference frame coordinates are derived from the most precise space geodetic measurement systems of the Global Geodetic Observing System (Plag and Pearlman, 2009), including GPS itself, but also satellite laser ranging (SLR) to locate the center of mass of the Earth accurately, and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) , to determine scale accurately and to determine the orientation of the Earth accurately with respect to the fixed stars. For self-consistency, it is important that the frame itself be determined using the apparatus of the reference system. Hence, when computing a GPS position, a user is leveraging the most accurate scientific geodetic techniques through the reference frame. Reference frames must be updated every once in a while in order to maintain their accuracy, as points on the Earthâs surface have a tendency to move with time, most notably from plate tectonics and large earthquakes.\n\nOnce reference frame coordinates are defined, they implicitly specify the location of the reference frame origin, the direction of the right-handed set of Cartesian axes , and the scale by which distance is measured (Torge, 2003). The reference frame coordinates are conventionally defined such that the origin of Cartesian coordinates (0, 0, 0) is most naturally aligned physically with the center of mass of the entire Earth system. The scale is set to be consistent with the conventional speed of light together with the GPS time scale which is driven by atomic frequency standards (BIPM, 1998). The orientation of the frame is physically arbitrary but nevertheless must be defined and is set by historical convention. The z-axis is conventionally selected to point in a fixed direction closely aligned to the Earthâs figure axis. Note that the rotational North Pole wobbles about Earthâs figure axis and so is not suitable as a permanent reference direction. Indeed, it is important for space geodetic techniques to account for the motion of the rotational pole within the adopted reference frame. The conventional equator is defined to be at right angles to the z-axis. Being at right angles to the z-axis, the x-axis and y-axis therefore lie on the conventional equator. The x-axis points to the prime meridian (zero longitude), which is slightly offset from the Greenwich meridian (for historical reasons). The y-axis is then defined to be at right angles to the x-axis, thus forming a right-handed coordinate system.\n\nNote that GPS Cartesian coordinates are more fundamental than GPS latitude, longitude, and height, which are derived quantities. Definition of GPS latitude, longitude, and height requires the notion of an ellipsoid that has a similar shape to the physical Earth, with its surface closely coinciding with the equipotential (physically level) surface of mean sea level, that is, the âgeoid. â The ellipsoid of the GPS reference system must have a defined equatorial radius, and a defined flattening factor , from which polar radius can be computed. Fundamentally, a userâs GPS receiver will compute the userâs Cartesian coordinates first and then compute the latitude, longitude, and height (Torge, 2003).\n\nNote that the height defined in this fashion is geometrically the distance normal to the surface of the ellipse. This is not generally the same thing as physical height above mean sea level. To compute a physical height, it is further necessary to correct for the height of the ellipsoid above the geoid (Torge, 2003). Such corrections are provided by models as a function of latitude and longitude. Deviations between the geometric ellipsoid and the physical geoid can exceed 100 m in some locations. Given that uncertainty in geoid models can far exceed the uncertainty in GPS Cartesian position, it is usually preferable to use GPS height above the ellipsoid unless the application demands a physical height. For example, it is typically sufficient to use ellipsoidal height for monitoring height variation in time. However, physical height may be needed for large-scale engineering projects involving the flow of water.\n\nInternational Terrestrial Reference System ITRS\n\nFor the most demanding geodetic applications, scientists use the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS). The reference frame of ITRS is known as the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) and is the responsibility of the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). The ITRS consists of sophisticated, accurate models and the ITRF, that together enable the computation of coordinates with the precision of millimeters (IERS Conventions, 2010). ITRF is updated from time to time and is labeled by the year of the last data that contributed to the frame definition. For example, at the time of writing, the most recent version was ITRF2008 (Altamimi et al., 2011), to be upgraded to ITRF2014 in 2016. Specifically for geodetic GPS, the reference frame that realizes ITRF2008 is âIGS08,â which is maintained by the International GNSS Service (IGS).\n\nIn order to accommodate plate tectonic motion, ITRF is defined not only by position coordinates of reference frame stations but also by velocity coordinates. Thus, given the position coordinates at the reference date (âepochâ) specified by ITRF, the position coordinates can be computed at any arbitrary date. Such a scheme is said to define a âsecular frame, â as it accommodates station motion that is linear in time (Altamimi et al., 2011).\n\nPosition coordinates in ITRF are regularized coordinates, in the sense that they do not represent the actual current position of a point, but rather the position after correcting for all physical effects specified by ITRS (IERS Conventions, 2010). During any given day, large nonlinear displacements of the Earthâs surface of up to 0.5 m result from the sum of many geophysical effects. The largest effect is caused by solid Earth tides , which are the deformations of the solid Earth caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun. A lesser effect which is important nearer the coastlines is ocean tidal loading. The ITRS convention document (IERS Conventions, 2010) specifies in great detail how to compute such displacements. Models must be specified in ITRS to be consistent with the definition that the origin is at the center of mass of the entire Earth system, including the ocean and atmosphere.\n\nExcept for predictable tidal motions, nonlinear motions of time constants greater than 1 day are typically not modeled as part of a stationâs regularized coordinate. Instead, time series of coordinates are used by scientists to investigate such effects, which can be difficult to model accurately. Examples of such effects include the Earthâs elastic and viscoelastic response surface mass loading from the atmosphere, groundwater, nontidal ocean, snow, and ice.\n\nThe ITRS also specifies fundamental constants and recommended models for the geodetic techniques that contribute to the definition of ITRF . This ensures a level of consistency between the various techniques when combining the data to define ITRF. Moreover, the ITRS convention document (currently IERS Conventions, 2010) continues to be improved and thus represents the best working practices at any given time. Techniques that contribute to ITRF currently include GPS, VLBI, SLR, and the French satellite system âDORIS â (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite).\n\nOne of the largest effects that requires consistent modeling in ITRS is relativity . Einsteinâs theory of relativity predicts that the rate of time between two ideal clocks is a function of both relative speed (special relativity) and difference in gravitational potential (general relativity). For GPS clocks, these effects are of opposite sign, but general relativity is the larger effect (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2008). The net effect on the average rate of GPS atomic clock time is mitigated in the satellite hardware by setting the frequency of the clocks lower as a function of the semimajor axis of the orbit. The small variation in satellite speed and gravitational potential as it orbits the Earth can produce a 30 ns (billionth of a second) variation of GPS atomic clock time, which if uncorrected would result in 10 m level positioning errors.\n\nFor modeling purposes, therefore coordinate time must be defined by ITRS a framework consistent with Einsteinâs theory of relativity. For this purpose, one possible choice of coordinate time is that of a perfect clock following Earthâs trajectory in space, but without the Earthâs mass being present. For an ideal clock located at the Earthâs center of mass , the effect of Earthâs mass is simply to shift the rate of time by a constant. Similarly, it turns out that an ideal clock co-rotating with the Earth on the geoid would have its clock time shifted by a constant, no matter where the clock may be geographically. This choice is called âTerrestrial Time â (TT). The rates between these three different types of coordinate time are specified by the ITRS; hence, it becomes straightforward to select a coordinate time convenient for modeling purposes. However, each choice of coordinate time necessarily changes the spatial scale by the same relative factor as the constant clock rate differences. These scale factors are specified by ITRS. The ITRF adopts the Scale . In addition to accounting for these timing effects, for the most precise applications, it is necessary to account for the so-called Shapiro effect of general relativity, which predicts that the distance between a satellite and the Earth can be more than 1 cm longer than in flat space (the simple geometrical computation using Pythagorasâ theorem).\n\nOther effects with models specified by ITRS include the Earthâs gravity field, orbit models, and propagation delay in the atmosphere at radio and optical frequencies. Errors in these models could in principle lead to differences in scale between different techniques and errors in the realization of the Earthâs center of mass. Therefore, these are topics of ongoing research to ensure the most accurate specification of ITRS, the best achievable consistency between the techniques, and best collective accuracy of all techniques as they contribute to ITRF.\n\nDespite consistency being imposed by ITRS in a relativistic, multi-technique framework, results show that there are significant scale differences between the different geodetic techniques that cannot yet be explained. In the case of GPS, it is understood that there is a fundamental problem of defining scale when it is not perfectly known where the electrical phase center of the satellite transmitting antenna is with respect to the satellite center of mass. Therefore SLR is used to calibrate GPS scale. However the difference in scale between SLR and VLBI (at the level of a centimeter over one Earth radius) remains an unsolved problem. For this reason, empirical scale differences between the techniques are estimated when combining solutions to generate ITRF, even though in principle these scale differences should not exist.\n\nAnother feature of ITRF is the need to specify âsite ties, â which are the relative coordinates between points associated with different techniques at the same site, so-called fundamental geodetic stations. Site ties are necessary to put the various techniques into the same reference frame. However, site ties turn out to be difficult to measure accurately and are a weak link in the construction of an ITRF. Methods to improve site tie measurements are an ongoing topic of research."
