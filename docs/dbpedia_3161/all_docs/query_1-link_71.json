        "text": "Part 1: Do you know how does these locations work?\n\nWhile both terms may sound to you similar, there are certain differences between them. Your smartphone, be it iPhone, iPad or Android is a GPS device. Almost every smartphone comes with a GPS chip. If your deviceâs location services are enabled, it will interact with the GPS satellites, enabling you and others as well to detect your location to a considerably accurate degree.\n\nWhen your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider assigns an IP address to the device. The IP address is a collection of numbers that determine who the internet service provider is and where youâre connecting from.Â This location accuracy depends on how that specific provider assigns an IP address, but itâs probably to be somewhere between the city and the street youâre in. For instance, search engines and streaming services check where you are from (your IP address) for redirecting you to a local version of their service.\n\nAll we want to say here is that if you want to change the location, then you should know if the location is based on an IP address or GPS app. To help you get started with how to change location on iPad, below we have covered every scenario when you might need to do so.\n\nPart 2: How to break the geo-limitation on downloading Apps?\n\nStep 1: On your iPad, go to the App Store app.\n\nStep 2: Click on the âFeaturedâ tab.\n\nStep 3: Now, scroll down to locate your Apple id and tap on it.\n\nStep 4: Choose âView Apple IDâ.

If there is no credit info you have, then select âNoneâ. If you select âNoneâ, then ensure that you have entered a postcode that corresponds to the region that you have chosen.\n\nStep 8: Finally, click âDoneâ and thatâs it.\n\nYour App store will be set to the selected region and you can now get the geo-restricted apps on your iPad.

From the main interface, select âVirtual Locationâ.\n\nStep 2: Click âGet Startedâ. Select âTeleportâ mode located at the top right side and it is the first one.
