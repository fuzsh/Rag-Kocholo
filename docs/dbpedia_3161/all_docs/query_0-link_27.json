        "text": "A GPS tracker is an electronic device that uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) to determine the geographical position of an object or person. GPS uses satellite signals to calculate the exact position of the device, which is then transmitted to a server or tracking device in real time. GPS trackers are often used to monitor the position of vehicles, cargo, people or pets. They are also used in outdoor activities, such as hiking, camping or fishing, to help users track their location or record their route. GPS trackers can be self-contained, meaning that they have their own power source and can operate independently for days or even weeks. They usually work with mobile apps, which are compatible with smartphones, smartwatches or tablets for more convenient use. The location data collected by GPS trackers can be used for both personal and business purposes. Now that you know more about object locators and GPS trackers, let's focus more on the Airtag so that you know all about its advantages and limitations, but above all so that you don't think that it's a GPS tracker that will protect you against theft.\n\nThe AirTag is an Apple product that was launched on April 30, 2021. It is a small disc-shaped device that uses Bluetooth and U1 technology to connect to Apple devices such as the iPhone, iPad and Mac, and to help users find lost items. AirTags can be attached to keys, bags, wallets or other personal items, and can be located using Apple's \"Locate\" app. Here are some of its benefits: - Location tracking: Using ultra-wideband (UWB) location technology, the Airtag allows you to easily locate your lost items using the \"Locate\" app on your iPhone or iPad. - Rugged design: The Airtag is water and dust resistant. It is small and lightweight. - Long-lasting battery: The Airtag has a replaceable battery that can last up to a year. - Easy to use: The Airtag is easy to set up and use. Simply link it to your Apple account and attach it to your object. - Integration with the Apple ecosystem: The Airtag is integrated with the Apple ecosystem, which means you can use it with other Apple products, such as the Apple Watch, to make finding lost items easier. - Privacy and security features: The Airtag is equipped with privacy features to protect the user's privacy, such as the ability to disable the tracking function. In addition, if an Airtag is found in the vicinity of an iPhone that does not belong to it, it can be used to send notifications to the iPhone user to indicate its presence. In summary, the Airtag offers a practical solution for finding lost items accurately and quickly. However, it is not a GPS tracker, so it is not designed to prevent theft, and there are limitations to its use.\n\nThe Apple Airtag is often referred to as an object tracker, but it is not technically a GPS tracker. Although the Airtag is a useful tool for finding lost items, it is not a GPS tracker. This is because the Airtag uses a technology called \"Ultra-Wideband\" (UWB) to communicate with nearby Apple devices and help them locate the Airtag with great accuracy. Unlike GPS trackers that use satellite signals to provide accurate, real-time location information, the Airtag uses only Bluetooth signals to communicate with nearby Apple devices. Its geographic location cannot be used directly by the user to locate the Airtag in real time. Unlike GPS trackers, the Airtag does not have real-time tracking or mapping capabilities. It cannot be used to track an object's movements in real time or to display location history. It is primarily designed to help users quickly locate nearby lost objects. In short, the Airtag is a key finder that uses Bluetooth technology to connect to an iPhone or iPad and help users quickly find nearby lost objects, but it is not a GPS tracker with real-time tracking and mapping capabilities. The Airtag is not a GPS tracker in its own right as it does not have independent connectivity to transmit its position in real time and cannot be used to monitor the position of a moving vehicle or person.\n\nWhile the Airtag is a useful tool for finding lost items, it also has some important limitations and restrictions to consider: - Limited range: The Airtag uses Bluetooth technology to connect to nearby Apple devices. This means that its range is limited to about 10 meters indoors and about 30 meters outdoors. If the object to which the Airtag is attached is out of range, it cannot be located. - Reliance on other Apple devices: The Airtag is designed to work with Apple devices. If you do not have an iPhone or iPad, you will not be able to use the Airtag. Also, the location of the Airtag depends on the proximity of a compatible Apple device. - Need an Internet connection: To locate an Airtag, you need an active Internet connection on your Apple device. If you are offline or do not have an Internet connection, you will not be able to locate your Airtag. - No real-time tracking: Unlike GPS trackers, the Airtag cannot provide real-time tracking or mapping of an object's movements. You can only locate your Airtag when you are near the object to which it is attached. - Risk of loss or theft of the Airtag: As the Airtag is a small device, it can be easily lost or stolen - Limited battery life: The Airtag is powered by a replaceable battery. Battery life depends on usage and conditions.\n\nGPS trackers and Airtags have different functionalities that can be adapted to different situations. Whether you choose a GPS tracker or an Airtag depends on your needs and what you want from your device. We have already stated in this article the limitations of the Airtag and why it is not a GPS tracker. With this information, it is obvious that we recommend that you equip your car, motorbike or scooter with a GPS tracker to avoid theft. If you are still hesitating, here are some points to consider when choosing between a GPS tracker and an Airtag for the protection of your vehicle against theft: - Operation: GPS trackers may require a SIM card and subscription to operate, while Airtags use Bluetooth technology to connect to an Apple device. GPS trackers with or without a SIM card operate independently, while Airtags require proximity to an Apple device to be used. - Range: GPS trackers have a much greater range than Airtags, as they are able to connect to GPS satellites. Airtags, on the other hand, have a range limited to the Bluetooth coverage area, which is typically about 30 meters. - Compatibility: GPS trackers can be used with any internet-connected device, while Airtags are only compatible with Apple devices. If you do not use an Apple device, a GPS tracker may be a better option for you. In summary, if you want safety protection for your vehicle that has no range limit and can be used with any internet-connected device, a GPS tracker is a better option. However, if you use an Apple device and just want a way to find your items if they get lost, the Airtag is a suitable device.\n\nUsing a GPS tracker to protect your vehicle against theft offers a number of advantages, including : - Real-time location: A GPS tracker allows you to locate your vehicle in real time in the event of theft, making it easier to recover your vehicle quickly and increasing the chances of recovering your property. You can track its every move and view its location at any time. - Theft prevention by motion alert: A simple movement of your vehicle will send you a motion alert, allowing you to check if your vehicle is still in its place or if it has just been stolen. Thanks to the geolocation, you can track the vehicle and have law enforcement agencies recover it with its exact location. - Area Entry/Exit Notifications: GPS trackers can also be set up to send an alert when the vehicle enters or exits a specific area, such as your garage or home, which can be useful for monitoring vehicle usage. - Quick vehicle recovery: In the event of theft, a GPS tracker can help recover your vehicle more quickly. Authorities can use the information provided by the GPS tracker to locate the vehicle and recover it before it is damaged or resold. In summary, the use of a GPS tracker can help protect your vehicle from theft by allowing for quick real-time location and providing alerts for monitoring vehicle use.\n\nThe ZEN L by Beepings GPS tracker has a number of advantages in addition to its ultra-complete and successful functionality. First of all, unlike many competing GPS trackers on the market, the ZEN L works without a SIM card and its purchase includes a 2-year subscription. At the end of the 2 years, the subscription costs €9.90 per year, which is still a very low cost, especially when compared with the price of the subscription of some competitors, which is around €30 per year. The ZEN L tracker is non-jamming because it uses low frequency networks to send position signals and alerts whereas other trackers use cellular technologies (2G, 3G, LTE-M...) which are jammable. The ZEN L uses the Sigfox network which offers coverage throughout Europe, whereas other GPS trackers only cover France. The ZEN L by Beepings GPS tracker has a battery life of 2 months in intensive use and up to 1 year in standby. Other GPS trackers only work when plugged into the vehicle and some have a battery life of only a few hours up to a maximum of 6 months. Thanks to the Beepings technology and low frequency networks, the ZEN L sends back its positions every 5 minutes, allowing you to track your vehicle or property accurately at all times. The ZEN L also offers you the possibility to consult your travel history for up to 1 year. A GPS security tracker would not be effective if it did not send an alert when suspicious movement is detected. The ZEN L will send you an alert by notification at the precise moment it detects movement of your vehicle or property. To continue in this direction, Beepings has included in the ZEN L's functionalities the definition of alert perimeters that will warn you in case of entry or exit of the zone of your GPS tracker. The ZEN L can be installed in seconds with a magnetic attachment supplied in the box that alerts you if it is pulled out. Finally, one last argument could tip the balance: the application. Intuitive and functional, it's free and brings together all the features you need to make the most of your ZEN L GPS tracker: sharing your position, defining virtual perimeters, managing your notifications. On the application, you can also consult various online videos to help you install and operate your tracker. Beepings also provides a support service via the website chat or on the application. The little extra of the ZEN L? Connect it to your vehicle with a 10V-50V converter to enjoy unlimited autonomy. The converter and the ZEN L GPS tracker are available for purchase online or in shops."
