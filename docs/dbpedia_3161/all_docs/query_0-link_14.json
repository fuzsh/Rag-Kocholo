The iPad (good), iPad Air (better) and the iPad Pro 11″ (best) feature nearly the same external dimensions and pilots will find that all three work very well with nearly every aviation app available.\n\nThe 10.9” and 11” specs on the mid-size models refer to the screen’s diagonal dimension, meaning these models feature more screen real estate than the original iPad while maintaining a similar form factor.\n\nThe flagship iPad Pro 11″ includes a large edge-to-edge display, a high-performance multicore processor, and along with the iPad Pro 13″, is the only iPad to use FaceID for unlocking. It includes a bright, high-resolution OLED screen with an anti-reflective coating. It’s also the only model that offers an optional nano-texture coating on the screen, which significantly reduces glare in the cockpit (read our PIREP on that technology here).\n\nThe larger iPad Air and Pro 13″ models represent a significant improvement over the original iPad Pro 13″ – they are 25% smaller while retaining the same display size, thanks to the edge-to-edge screen. The footprint is about the same as a sheet of paper, so it can fit in most GA cockpits if you want the largest screen available, but don’t try to fly with it in your J-3 Cub.\n\nApple released updated iPad Pro 11″ and 13″ models in May 2024. While the form factor remains similar, the 2024 models were upgraded with an OLED screen and include Apple’s M4 processor, which Apple claims to be 50% faster than the M2 it replaces.\n\nApple also refreshed the iPad Air model in May 2024 and it looks a lot like the iPad Pro with an edge-to-edge screen, no home button, and USB-C for charging. It uses the powerful M2 processor which can handle the most demanding aviation app demands with ease. For security, the iPad Air incorporates TouchID in the power button at the top of the device, which some pilots find to be more reliable than FaceID in the cockpit.\n\nThe entry-level model referred to as just “iPad” was last updated on October 2022 and on the surface looks very similar to the iPad Air. It incorporates Apple’s A14 processor, which has plenty of power to run any of today’s aviation apps effortlessly. It includes Touch ID in the top power button and uses USB-C for charging. One difference worth noting between the iPad Air and iPad is that the screen on the entry-level iPad does not include the anti-reflective coating, which is a nice feature in bright cockpits.\n\nIf you’re looking for an iPad with a smaller footprint, consider the iPad mini. This version measures 7.69″ by 5.3″ and will be a better fit in cockpits with tighter constraints. The latest 6th generation model was last updated in September 2021, uses the A15 Bionic processor and includes the anti-reflective screen coating (read our PIREP on this model here). For a sense of the size, here’s a picture of an iPad Mini 6 in a Cessna 172 cockpit:\n\nFull iPad specifications are available from Apple. Our top two picks for pilots would be the iPad Air or iPad Mini 6, depending on your size preference (upgrade to the 256GB version when going with the iPad Mini 6). See our buyer’s guide for a more detailed analysis.\n\nWhat are the internal storage options and how much do I really need?\n\nThe base storage capacity varies by model and each offers the option to go bigger: 64 GB for the iPad Mini and iPad, 128 GB for the iPad Air and 256 GB for the iPad Pro. The Pro models offer the most storage, with the option to upgrade up to 2TB. Downloading all the VFR and IFR charts for the entire United States across multiple data cycles can take nearly 20GB, so even the smallest option available can work but it quickly gets tight if you limit yourself to 64 GB on the entry-level models. You have to consider that you might also want to store high-resolution terrain data, synthetic vision, charts for Canada, Mexico and Caribbean, and PDF documents.\n\nFinally, consider that you may use the iPad for more than just aviation (e.g., pictures, videos, other apps), so you’ll want to leave open some free space for those items. The iPad’s memory is not upgradeable, so you have to commit to a size up front. If in doubt and you plan to use your iPad beyond just the cockpit, consider 128 GB as the bare minimum. That may sound like a lot now, but it doesn’t leave much room for future growth as new aviation databases and features are introduced and your photo and music libraries continue to expand.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Wifi-only iPad and the iPad with Cellular data?\n\nEvery iPad model ever built offers WiFi connectivity to the internet, so you can connect to your home network, your office network, a local coffee shop, etc. But you can also buy an upgraded cellular model that receives wireless data from a carrier like AT&T or Verizon (for a monthly fee).\n\nThe benefit to pilots with the cellular model is that it also contains an internal GPS receiver, which is useful for showing your aircraft’s position on aviation map applications (although it has some minor limitations). The cellular model also allows you to download weather and file flight plans on the go, but don’t count on this cellular data connection to work in the air. In our experience, it just isn’t reliable. It’s also technically illegal. Again, only the cellular model iPads have a built-in GPS.\n\nThe internal GPS on an iPad with cellular data is completely independent of the cellular antenna and does not require that you activate a data plan from AT&T or Verizon to work properly. You could buy a cellular model iPad and use the GPS without ever activating your service.\n\nSo which is the right choice for pilots? Either one, really. Many pilots already fly with an ADS-B receiver that includes an integrated GPS, so you can save some money on your iPad purchase and rely on your ADS-B receiver for a position source. Others prefer to have the integrated GPS in the iPad as an always-on backup and consider the upgrade to be cheap insurance. The GPS found in today’s cellular iPad model is much improved over the GPS receivers found in the original iPad models, so it is fast and accurate (read our iPad GPS PIREP here). From the connectivity side, if you frequently use your iPad on the ground at locations without WiFi, the upgrade to the cellular model definitely makes sense.\n\nI have the iPad + Cellular (which has an internal GPS) – do I still need an external GPS?\n\nNo, the internal GPS receiver in the iPad models with cellular data has been improved significantly since the iPad’s early days and provides reliable position and navigation data (read our iPad GPS PIREP here).\n\nI bought an iPad + Cellular – do I need to activate the wireless service for the internal GPS to work?\n\nThe internal GPS on an iPad + Cellular is completely independent from the cellular antenna and does not require a data service to be activated from AT&T or Verizon to work properly. Many pilots buy an iPad + Cellular and use the GPS without ever activating your service.\n\nWhat are my options for adding an external GPS?\n\nMost pilots elect to add an ADS-B receiver containing an integrated GPS. You have three options: Sentry (works with ForeFlight only), Stratus (works with ForeFlight, WingX, FlyQ, and others) and Garmin GDL 50/51/52 (works with the Garmin Pilot, ForeFlight, Fltplan Go). See below more information on wireless iPad ADS-B weather receivers.\n\nWhat is the difference between WiFi and Bluetooth?\n\nBoth protocols allow you to connect accessories to your iPad wirelessly. Bluetooth is shorter range, and allows for limited connections (like Garmin’s GPS and ADS-B receivers). WiFi is longer range and allows multiple iPads/iPhones to connect to a wireless network for internet access. WiFi is also a common way to connect wireless accessories to the iPad (like the Stratus or Sentry weather receiver).\n\nCan I add in-flight weather to the iPad?\n\nYes! This is a very popular upgrade. There are two main sources of in-flight weather.\n\nADS-B: subscription-free and ground-based. Requires portable Sentry weather receiver and the ForeFlight iPad app, the Garmin GDL 50 weather receiver and the Garmin Pilot app, or ForeFlight app, or the Stratus weather receiver for FlyQ, Straus Insight, WingX, FltPlan Go and other aviation apps. Learn more with our ADS-B Receiver Comparison Guide.\n\nSiriusXM: If you prefer a satellite-based data-link weather service and don’t mind paying a monthly subscription, then the Garmin GDL 51/52 would do the trick. The GDL 51 is XM only and works with ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot. The GDL 52 receives both ADS-B and XM for the best of both worlds.\n\nWhat is the difference between Sentry and Sentry Plus?\n\nBoth Sentry and Sentry Plus were designed to provide GPS, AHRS, CO monitoring and ADS-B traffic/weather to ForeFlight. Sentry Plus includes additional features, like a g-meter, on-device track logging, OLED display and an extended 18-hour battery life.\n\nCan I legally use the iPad as a replacement for paper charts for VFR or IFR flight?\n\nYes, under FAR Part 91 flying (majority of General Aviation), you can legally use an iPad that has current charts installed for both VFR and IFR flights. For technical info, refer to the iPad Legal Briefing for Pilots for additional guidance on Electronic Flight Bags.\n\nOn a more practical note, is the iPad a reliable paper chart replacement?\n\nAt Sporty’s we have been flying with the iPad since the day it came out in 2010, and have found it to be very reliable for displaying electronic charts and aviation data in the cockpit. We use it as our main source of charts in all our flight operations, from local flight-training missions to cross-country trips in our Piper Aztec – and it hasn’t let us down once. We still recommend carrying some type of backup, like your iPhone or Android phone, with an aviation app installed with current data.\n\nCan I install my aviation app on both an iPhone and iPad with the same subscription?\n\nOne subscription to ForeFlight allows you to install the app on 2 iPads and 1 iPhone, or 1 iPad and 2 iPhones. A Garmin Pilot subscription can be installed on any combination of 3 iOS devices.\n\nWhen an update is available for any of your installed applications, you’ll see a red badge on the App Store icon on the iPad home screen. Open the App Store program, and you’ll then tap on your profile picture at the top right of the screen to see available updates. App updates can also be set to download automatically (from the Settings App, iTunes and App Store page). Most updates are free.\n\nWhat options do I have for getting charts outside the US?\n\nIf you’re looking for Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Europe or Australia, ForeFlight Mobile offers subscription options for these regions. For a larger collection of international charts, including VFR and IFR charts for many European, Asian and African countries, check out the international subscription options in the Garmin Pilot app.\n\nWhat is the typical iPad battery life?\n\nOut of the box you can expect about 10 hours of battery life when using it for everyday tasks like surfing the web or reading an e-book. When using it in the airplane with a GPS and a moving-map application, expect the battery to last around 4 hours. Check out this article for information on getting the most out of the battery.\n\nCan I charge the iPad from my airplane’s 12v-24v plug?\n\nYes, you can purchase a USB 12-24V Charger. This is specially designed for the iPad’s higher 2.1 to 2.4 amp power requirement (not all chargers will effectively charge an iPad).\n\nI don’t have a power source in my airplane – what other options are there for supplying backup power to an iPad?\n\nFor extended flights without access to charging, Sporty’s offers a compact, high-capacity battery backup system. This portable power supply will provide up to an additional 10 hours of battery life.\n\nWhat are the main ways pilots are mounting iPads in the cockpit?\n\nThe easiest and most portable way to secure the iPad in the cockpit is with an iPad kneeboard (Sporty’s sells many of these). For more secure and flexible options you can use the Ram Mount or Robust Mounting systems, which offer the option of using a yoke mount, glareshield clamp mount, or a suction cup mount. MyGoFlight also offers a collection of premium mounts that attach to your yoke or side window.\n\nRecommended mounting options for:\n\nCessna high-wing (C152, C172, C182, etc.) – Suction, Yoke or Glareshield\n\nCirrus – Suction or Glareshield (or kneeboard)\n\nCessna Corvalis/400 – Suction or Glareshield (or kneeboard)\n\nBeech – Beech Yoke Mount\n\nPiper or Mooney – Suction, Yoke or Glareshield\n\nSmall/Mid-Size Jets – Kneeboard\n\nAll of these mounts are available for iPad, iPad Air, iPad Mini and iPad Pro. Shop all mounts here.\n\nWhat are my options for securing an iPad in my lap in the cockpit?\n\nSimple – iPad Slimline Rotating Kneeboard or My Clip iPad Kneeboard\n\nBi-fold Kneeboard – iPad and iPad Mini Bi-Fold Kneeboard\n\nDeluxe – Flight Outfitters iPad Flight Desk, or MyGoFlight iPad Folio C Kneeboard\n\nMost kneeboards are designed for either the iPad Mini or the larger iPad/iPad Air/iPad Pro (9.7″ to 11″).\n\nI want to use the RAM Cradle – do I have to remove my iPad’s protective cover each time?\n\nThere are two RAM Mount cradle options. The Perfect Fit cradle design (available for most iPads) is the standard and will securely hold the iPad, but you must remove any cover or case before using. The RAM X-Grip provides more flexibility and lets you secure the iPad without removing a protective case.\n\nWhat options are available for reducing screen glare in the cockpit?\n\nNo options currently exist that completely eliminate screen glare (don’t believe it if you read it), but this screen protector is the best one we’ve ever seen.\n\nWhat about Android apps?\n\nGoogle’s Android system is a competitor to Apple’s iPad and iPhone.
