I do not maintain a cell connection for my iPad and my Boating app works wonderfully. I use wi-fi to update my charts before a trip but when I'm off shore, I an usually not connected to any wi-fi except maybe my Raymarine boat network so I an see my chart plotter from the cockpit and share data from that network with the boating app. Just sailed from Sint Maarten to Jolly Harbour Antigua with zero issues.\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: May 2015\n\nLocation: Muskegon, Mi\n\nBoat: Columbia 36\n\nPosts: 1,255\n\nRe: Navionics on an Apple iPad\n\nLast I heard, If you want built in GPS on the pad, you need the cellular version. The cellular and GPS are on the same chip so you can't get one without the other. No need to buy a cellular plan for it though if you have another Internet source to do updates etc. If you have a separate GPS source that can feed the pad via WiFi, then WiFi is all you need. I prefer the built in GPS even with a WiFi source for redundancy.\n\nAlso the built in GPS usually works just fine below deck on a fiberglass boat. 'Glass is invisible to radio waves. On a metal boat not so much, it might or might not work. I use my Android tab in my commercial boats which are all steel. The gps works well if I keep it up by the pilot house windows. Haven't tried it below but I doubt it would work.\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: May 2015\n\nLocation: Muskegon, Mi\n\nBoat: Columbia 36\n\nPosts: 1,255\n\nRe: Navionics on an Apple iPad\n\nI have two tabs I use, the older one has GPS and no cellular. The newer one has both. When I was shopping for the newer one, I couldn't find one with GPS and no cellular so I don't think they make those any more.\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2023\n\nPosts: 1,783\n\nRe: Navionics on an Apple iPad\n\nAt least in the Apple world, the GPS and the Cellular radio live on the same chip. You can not have one without the other.\n\nOf course, you don't need to have a sim card and actually USE the cellular connection to use the GPS. If you are using an iPad for navigation, just get the one with the cell radio.\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2021\n\nLocation: Deale, MD\n\nBoat: Moody 376\n\nPosts: 528\n\nRe: Navionics on an Apple iPad\n\nIve been using navionics on an old Ipad Air for a couple years\n\nneighbor was throwing it away. it has a cellular chip, but no sim card. which is fine. it needs the cell chip to have the gps. but you don't need the sim card or the have cell service active.\n\nI will occasional hotspot to my cell phone via bluetooth/wifi or bring the ipad home and update the maps over the house wifi...\n\ni keep it mounted under the dodger in the shade on a cheap clamp so it doesn't get too hot and overheat and shut down.\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: May 2015\n\nLocation: Muskegon, Mi\n\nBoat: Columbia 36\n\nPosts: 1,255\n\nRe: Navionics on an Apple iPad\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by tblesinger\n\nYou can use your existing iPad.

No need for a sim card or cellular connection if you have another way to get updates. You can use your phones hotspot for that.\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2016\n\nLocation: San Francisco\n\nBoat: Morgan 382\n\nPosts: 3,189\n\nRe: Navionics on an Apple iPad\n\nKeep in mind that there are other ways to get GPS data without the cellular chip. Either with an external GPS, or by connecting to the ships GPS via wifi.\n\nI have all of my devices connect to the ships NMEA bus via wifi. That way, Navionics also displays depth and AIS targets. And no cellular version needed.\n\n__________________\n\n-Warren\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2016\n\nLocation: SE Asia, for now\n\nBoat: Outremer 55L\n\nPosts: 3,967\n\nRe: Navionics on an Apple iPad\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Jim maupin\n\nI use the Navionics Boating app on my iPhone 13.

Jim in Port Townsend, WA\n\nTo condense and clarify previous posts:\n\nIf you have no other navigation or network facility on your boat and your iPad will be the only navigation instrument (in addition to your phone), then you need the cellular version to have a GPS signal. No SIM nor active mobile contract needed.\n\nIf you have a navigation system on your boat and a wifi network with your navigation systems data broadcast on it, then you can use the wifi only version. The cost of adding a wife broadcast to your boats network using something like this https://www.yachtd.com/products/wifi_gateway.html is about the same as the difference in price of the iPads. The benefit is that you can broadcast all your navigation data, including AIS; not just GPS signal."
