This article goes through the meaning and functionality of GPS, its key types, and applications with examples.\n\nWhat Is GPS?\n\nGlobal positioning system or GPS initially referred to a radio navigation system owned by the U.S. government that used satellites and has come to mean any group of satellites that broadcast at L1, L2, and L5 carrier frequencies and apply trilateration to calculate distances accurately.\n\nGPS has become a general term used in the navigation and mapping sector. When people mention GPS, what comes to mind is the ability to track the location of objects or determine the direction of a place, which is very accurate.\n\nGPS or global positioning system is a radio-navigation setup based on satellite systems that provide positioning, navigation and timing information to users through sending impulses to an earthbound receiver. GPS was initially known as NAVSTAR and is a constellation of satellites owned by the United States. It is operated by the U.S. space force and was originally reserved for military use but has now been made available for commercial and civilian use.\n\nThe global positioning system operates based on satellites orbiting the earth. It consists of 31 well-placed satellites that allow users with sensors and receivers to pinpoint the exact location when they are within the line of sight of at least three of those orbiting satellites.\n\nWhat does GPS stand for?\n\nGPS stands for global positioning system. It is a subcategory of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)Opens a new window . It is the pioneering technology among other navigation satellite systems being used today.\n\nSee More: How Ericsson Is Fixing IoT Implementation Challenges for Businesses: Q&A With Kyle Okamoto\n\nHow Does GPS Work?\n\nGPS works by communication between its different components, similar to GLONASS, BeiDou, and Galileo satellites. The global positioning system (GPS) has three parts or elements. These components work together to make sure that the navigation, timing, and positioning information sent across are consistently accurate. The parts are the space segment, control segment, and receivers.\n\n1. Space segment\n\nThis GPS component is made from a constellation of 31 satellites that revolve in a specific orbit around the earth. They are located at the height of 20,000 kilometers above the planet, and each of them continuously sends out microwave signals sensed by the preset receivers. Each satellite has inbuilt atomic clocks – exact and accurate clocks – that keep the satellites in sync and synchronized with earthbound clocks.\n\n2. Control segment\n\nThe control segment is also known as the ground segment. This global positioning system component is very similar to a tower station. The control segment is responsible for managing and ensuring the proper functionality of the satellites.\n\nThe control segment comprises a master control station, a backup master control station, several command antennas, control antennas, and monitoring sites. The critical functions of the ground segments include tracking satellite movements, performing analysis, monitoring satellite transmissions, and communicating with the satellite to make sure that the information transmitted from the satellites to the receivers is as accurate as possible.\n\n3. Receivers or user segment\n\nReceivers are the third and most common component of the GPS. They are found embedded in virtually all smartphones and trackers in day-to-day devices. Their application cuts across several industries, from transport and aviation to military, automobile, and IoT. GPS receivers consist of an antenna and a processor.\n\nThe antenna is tuned to pick up the frequency of wave signals being transmitted from satellites. At the same time, the processor uses a method known as trilateration to decode and interpret the information. Receivers also have a clock that records the time a signal was detected. Receivers come in various sizes and can be as minute as those found in mobile phones.\n\nHow do receivers work in GPS?\n\nA GPS receiver can only work when it is in the line of sight of at least three satellites. This is why GPS devices are less accurate when used indoors. Each satellite sends a signal encrypted with the satellite’s location at the time of transmission and when it sent the signal. A receiver uses the site from three satellites sending signals to the same receiver and the time difference from the time of signal transmission to when it was received.\n\nIt then uses a mathematical equation to determine the distance of the satellites from it and each other, therefore deducing its location via latitude and longitude coordinates. Using the fourth satellite, the receiver can verify the accuracy of the information it gives and, therefore, avoid the need for an atomic clock.\n\nSee More: 5G vs. Fiber Optics: Which One Suits IoT Connectivity the Best?\n\nTypes of GPS\n\nThe global positioning system has a widely varied application. It has also undergone several modifications giving rise to the different types of GPS. While they all work using the same fundamental principle, each class specializes in meeting specific demands. The types of GPS systems include:\n\n1. A-GPS\n\nAssisted GPS (A-GPS) is a type of GPS that allows receivers to get information from local network sources, which helps in the location of satellites. Assisted GPS is usually used in areas where satellite signals cannot easily reach, probably due to trees or tall buildings. However, there must be cellular networks for A-GPS to work.\n\nAssisted GPS became necessary when GPS was introduced for commercial use. A-GPS is extensively used in smartphones where it makes the phone’s location information accessible by emergency call dispatch. The technology increases start-up time and allows cell phones to lock into the navigation system even when the signal is weak, or their phone is visible to only two satellites.\n\n2. S-GPS\n\nSimultaneous GPS (S-GPS) is a modification of GPS that allows both voice data and GPS signaling to be transmitted from a phone simultaneously. Both data types are sent simultaneously rather than alternating the SPS signal and the reception for the telephone call, and there is better sensitivity. This is particularly useful in emergencies to allow service providers such as ambulances, fire stations, etc., to locate the source of a call even as the call is ongoing.\n\n3. D-GPS\n\nDifferential GPS (D-GPS) is a correction technique used to increase the accuracy of location data obtained from a traditional GPS receiver. D-GPS is an enhancement to GPS, providing a better sense of the actual location of an object or person.\n\nThe usual range of accuracy for GPS is, at best, 15 Meters. D-GPS can narrow the location error limit to 1 inch (2.5cm). It works using a network of fixed ground stations that broadcast the calculated difference between the known fixed locations and the satellite location. D-GPS is applied by the United States and the Canadian Coast Guards.\n\n4. Non-differential GPS\n\nNon-differential GPS, as opposed to differential GPS, uses direct satellite signals to deduce positioning. It is less accurate than D-GPS, but has a significantly more comprehensive range of use.\n\n5. Mapping and non-mapping GPS\n\nMapping GPS is a type of GPS unit that comes with in-built maps. It is also possible to download maps to add to the mapping GPS. This is the type of GPS unit often found in mobile devices and other handheld devices. Non-mapping GPS is a type of GPs unit that comes without maps. It shows you your location and the direction to get to another point without seeing roads or landmarks. It uses breadcrumb-like trails to mark your progress and direction.\n\nSee More: What Is Ailing IoT Implementations at Scale and Ways to Fix Them\n\nExamples of GPS\n\nGPS solutions have been put across several use cases.
