        "text": "The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Government and operated by the United States Space Force to meet government defense, civil, enterprise, and scientific needs. GPS currently provides two levels of service: Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Precise Positioning Service (PPS). The civilian SPS is available to all users on a continuous, worldwide basis, free of any direct user charges. Access to the military PPS is restricted to U.S. Armed Forces, U.S. federal government agencies, and selected allied armed forces and governments.\n\nGPS satellites provide users around the world with a host of services on the ground, in the oceans and up in the air. Here are just a few examples:\n\nPosition and Navigation Services – GPS satellites are able to locate or position a GPS device or receiver (e.g., cellular phone, mobile tablet, or turn-by-turn navigation device) by having a minimum of three GPS satellites within range of the device at any given moment.\n\nGPS III Constellation Update – The next-generation GPS III satellite constellation is already being deployed. GPS III satellites are three times more accurate than the current constellation and have up to eight times improved anti-jamming. GPS III satellites are also the first to introduce the new L1C civil signal, which will enable interoperability between GPS and international satellite navigation systems. As of early 2024, the first six GPS III satellites have been launched and the seventh satellite SV-07 is expected to launch later in 2024 or early 2025. A total of 10 new satellites will eventually make up the new GPS III constellation."
