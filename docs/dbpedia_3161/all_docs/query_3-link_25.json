        "text": "Not only do we rely on GPS in our phones, it is also important for ships, planes, ambulances and so much more. However, many of us don’t know much about the math, science, and history of this technology. How can a system that fits inside a smartphone instantly pinpoint your location?\n\nHistory of GPS\n\nIn the 1950's, researchers developed the first satellite navigation system for military purposes. After several decades of improvements, civilians began to use GPS in the 1980s. The system became fully functional in 1994. The United States government owns and maintains the Global Positioning System that we use in North America.\n\nMisconception Alert\n\nEarth is not a perfect sphere. It has lumps and bumps which Gladys Mae West helped to model.\n\nRoger Easton, Ivan Getting, and Bradford Parkinson also played key roles in the development of the GPS. These physicists and engineers developed ways to locate satellites and locations on Earth.\n\nHow does GPS work?\n\nBefore the development of GPS, people used a variety of different navigation techniques. Sailors often used the position of the stars to know what direction they were going.\n\nQ1: What might be some problems with using stars to navigate?\n\nNavigation techniques help people find their latitude and longitude. Lines of longitude run from North to South. The line of 0º longitude runs through Greenwich, England. Lines of latitude run from East to West. The line of 0º latitude is the Equator. Knowing both your longitude and latitude gives your position on the globe.\n\nImage - Text Version\n\nShown are four illustrations of the Earth showing the location and direction of the lines of longitude and latitude.\n\nThe Earth on the top left has white vertical lines circling the planet. These are identified as lines of longitude.\n\nThe Earth on the lower left shows a top-down view of the Earth. Lines of longitude are drawn using white lines that radiate outward from the north pole. They are marked and labelled in ten degree increments. The left side of the Earth is labelled as the Western Hemisphere and the right side of the Earth is labelled as the Eastern Hemisphere. Running vertically up the middle of the Earth is a line identified as the Greenwich Meridian Line.\n\nThe Earth on the top right has white parallel horizontal lines circling the planet. These are identified as lines of latitude.\n\nThe Earth on the lower right shows a side view of the Earth. Lines of latitude are drawn using parallel white lines. They are marked and labelled in ten degree increments. The upper part of the Earth is labelled as the Northern Hemisphere and the lower side of the Earth is labelled as the Southern Hemisphere. Running horizontally along the middle of the Earth is a line identified as the Equator.\n\nImage - Text Version\n\nShown is a map of Canada overlaid with lines of latitude and longitude. Lines of latitude are coloured red and lines of longitude are coloured blue. Major Canadian cities are also identified on the map.\n\nQ2: At what latitude is Winnipeg located? At what longitude is Hamilton located?\n\nA receiver uses the following formula:\n\nDistance = signal speed x signal time\n\nThe signal speed is the speed of light (about 300,000,000 m/s). The signal time is how long it takes for the signal to travel from the satellite to the receiver. Multiplying these two numbers tells us the distance between the satellite and the receiver.\n\nFor example, imagine that it takes a signal 0.005 seconds to travel from a satellite from your phone.\n\nDistance = 300,000,000 m/s x 0.005 s = 1,500,000 metres\n\nThat means that the satellite is 1.5 million metres or 1500 kilometres from the receiver.\n\nQ3: How far from a receiver is a satellite if it takes 0.02 seconds for a signal traveling at the speed of light to reach the receiver? Give your answer in metres and kilometres.\n\nDid you know?\n\nGPS relies on Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity. The time information sent by satellites is adjusted to account for relativity. This makes the system more precise.\n\nHowever, knowing how far away you are from one satellite doesn’t give you your position. For that, GPS uses trilateration.\n\nTrilateration\n\nTrilateration is a way of locating a point based on how far away it is from three other points. Multiple satellites must connect with the receiver to use this process. The distance between the receiver and several satellites is calculated. Trilateration is a method of using this distance information to find a location.\n\nMisconception Alert\n\nGPS uses trilateration not triangulation. Trilateration involves measuring distances. It is sometimes confused with triangulation which measures angles.\n\nHere’s a simple example of how trilateration works. Imagine that you are standing on a soccer field. Next image that you are trying to find a ball on the field based on the following clues.\n\nThe ball is 20m from the bottom right corner.\n\nThe ball is 40m from the center of the field.\n\nThe ball is 15m from the center of the left goal.\n\nBased on these three clues, can you find the soccer ball?\n\nWatch the video below to learn more.\n\n(Please Note: The following video appears with a thumbnail that typically indicates a 'broken video' on YouTube, but the video works properly.)\n\nHow your smartphone knows where you are (3:00 min.) by KQED Quest (2016).\n\nAs shown in the example above, trilateration only requires three satellites. So why do we need a fourth satellite? The fourth satellite adjusts for errors in the receiver’s clock. This makes GPS even more accurate. Currently, a GPS-enabled smartphone usually knows your location within about 5 metres.\n\nUsing satellite navigation has become a normal part of our daily life. Mapping apps help us find our way around the world. We use GPS for many social activities, such as geotagging posts or geocaching. First responders use GPS to quickly get to the location of an emergency and respond to disasters. GPS also helps planes safely get to their destination. Scientists use GPS to forecast the weather. These are just a few of the ways that we use this technology.\n\nNext time you use GPS, take a minute to think about what makes this technology possible."
