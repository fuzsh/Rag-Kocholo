        "text": "Apple in September 2023 introduced the second-generation Apple Watch Ultra, a follow-up to the original Apple Watch Ultra that came out in September 2022. Designed to compete with more expensive fitness-focused smart watches from companies like Garmin, the Apple Watch Ultra is aimed at sports enthusiasts and athletes who need more battery life and more sport-specific performance from their devices.\n\nApple says the Apple Watch Ultra was built for endurance, exploration, and adventure, and continues to be the largest Apple Watch to date at 49mm, which is 4mm larger than the 45mm Apple Watch Series 9 that it's being sold alongside.\n\nThe biggest new feature in the Ultra 2 is the new S9 chip, which is much faster than the S8 in the prior model and enables new functionality. The S9 chip has a 4-core Neural Engine that processes machine learning tasks up to twice as fast, and it is more efficient for the same all-day battery life despite new capabilities.\n\nDouble Tap is the major new feature enabled by the S9 chip. The gesture allows users to tap the index finger and thumb together in order to interact with the Apple Watch one-handed. Double Tap can be used to stop a timer, play/pause music, answer or end a call, snooze an alarm, and more.\n\nWith the S9 chip, Siri commands that do not require information from the internet are processed on device for faster response times and more privacy, plus dictation is 25 percent more accurate. Users can also ask Siri questions about data from the Health app, getting information on Activity progress, heart rate, sleep, and medications.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 did not receive any design updates, and it features a lightweight aerospace-grade titanium body, flat sapphire crystal face, a larger diameter and deeper grooved Digital Crown, a housing for the side button and an extra physical button on the left side called the Action button.\n\nAt up to 3000 nits, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the brightest Apple Watch to date, and it is brighter than the prior version, so it is easy to see in sunlight. It can also go down to 1 nit for use in dark rooms like movie theaters.\n\nThe Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra is designed in international orange to make it noticeable in the dark and under water, and it's customizable so it can activate Workouts, mark segments, set Compass Waypoints, and more.\n\nThere are three built-in microphones to improve sound quality, and a beamforming algorithm captures voice while reducing ambient background sounds even when it's noisy outdoors. There is an 86-decibel siren available for drawing help if needed, with two SOS patterns.\n\nWith the larger 49mm casing, Apple was able to include a larger battery. The Apple Watch Ultra lasts for up to 36 hours on a single charge, and with a new low-power setting, battery life can last for up to 60 hours for multi-day adventuring. The battery lasts long enough for users to complete a long-course triathlon that includes a 2.4 mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and a full 26.2-mile marathon.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra features dual-frequency GPS, integrating both the L1 and L5 frequencies, plus it has new positioning algorithms. It provides the most accurate GPS of any Apple Watch, which means it also offers precise distance, pace, and route data for training and competing.\n\nTo accommodate more extreme environments, the Apple Watch Ultra can withstand a wider temperature range. It works in conditions as cold as -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20° C) to as hot as 131 degrees Fahrenheit (55° C). The watch is certified to MIL-STD-810H, a metric used for military equipment and by rugged equipment manufacturers.\n\nFor water sports, the Apple Watch Ultra can hold up to kitesurfing, wakeboarding, and recreational scuba diving, activities not recommended for the standard Apple Watch models. The Apple Watch Ultra is certified to WR100 and EN 13319, an internationally recognized standard for diving accessories. When used for diving, the Apple Watch Ultra has a depth gauge and a dedicated Depth app that displays current depth, water temperature (using the new temperature sensor), duration under water, and max depth reached.\n\nApple designed a special Wayfinder watch face for the Apple Watch Ultra, with a built-in compass and space for up to eight complications. The watch face can be customized for the mountain, ocean, or trail, and it turns red automatically at night for better visibility. This year, there's also a new Modular Ultra Face that provides the most complications of any watch face. The Apple Watch Ultra supports Compass Waypoints for marking a location or point of interest, and a Backtrack feature uses GPS to create a path showing where the user has been, helpful for retracing steps when lost.\n\nIn addition to features designed for exploring and adventuring, the Apple Watch Ultra has all of the functionality available in the Apple Watch Series 9. It monitors heart rate, tracks sleep, can take ECG readings, monitors blood oxygen, tracks body temperature, and offers all of the same fitness tracking options. All Apple Watch Ultra models feature cellular connectivity, with a cellular plan needed to access all functions.\n\nApple added a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip to the Apple Watch Ultra 2. The UWB chip enables Precision Finding for locating a misplaced iPhone with visual, haptic, and audio guidance. There's also improved integration with HomePod and when an Apple Watch gets within four meters of a HomePod playing audio, the Ultra 2 can show the Now Playing interface for controlling media.\n\nThere are motion sensors in the Apple Watch Ultra that enable Crash Detection, alerting emergency services if you are in a severe car crash. When a crash is detected, the Apple Watch checks in with the user and then dials emergency services automatically if there's no response after a 10 second countdown.\n\nThere are three sport-focused bands available for the Apple Watch Ultra, including the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band, plus older bands designed for 44 and 45mm Apple Watches fit the new model. The Trail Loop band is the thinnest Apple Watch band to date, while the Alpine Loop features high-strength yarn and a woven design made for durability. The Ocean Band is for extreme water sports and features a flexible fluoroelastomer that can stretch to fit over a wetsuit.\n\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 has the same design as the original Apple Watch Ultra. It has the rounded rectangular shape, of the Series 9, but with a more rugged build. The case edges extend to the flat front crystal display, and the Digital Crown and side button are a raised area on the case.\n\nCompared to the Series 9, the the Digital Crown on the Ultra has larger and coarser grooves for easier access even when using gloves, and the side button is also able to be used with gloves on.\n\nAt 49mm, the Apple Watch Ultra is the biggest Apple Watch that Apple offers, and it is 4mm larger than the 45mm Apple Watch Series 9, the second largest Apple Watch available for purchase. The Apple Watch Ultra measures in at 49mm by 44mm by 14.4mm, and it weighs 61.3 grams, making it heavier than even the 45mm stainless steel Apple Watch Series 9.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra includes an \"Action\" button on the left side of the device that can be customized by the user. The Action button is a bright orange color to make it easy to see, and it can do things like launch Workouts and apps.\n\nApple Watch Ultra: How to Customize the Action Button\n\nColors and Materials\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra is made from an aerospace-grade titanium, which is a lightweight and durable material that also offers corrosion resistance for use in the water. The back of the Apple Watch Ultra is made from ceramic and sapphire crystal, like the Series 9.\n\nThere are no color options for the Apple Watch Ultra, and it is available only in a silver titanium shade. With prior versions of the Apple Watch Edition, Apple offered titanium in black as well, but that is not available for the Apple Watch Ultra. Apple did, however, test a darker color that did not make it to release.\n\nExclusive Watch Face\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra has an exclusive \"Wayfinder\" face that incorporates a time dial that can be transformed into a compass, plus it has room for up to eight complications. The Wayfinder face has a built-in night mode that turns it red for better visibility in the dark. Night mode can be activated by turning the Digital Crown, but it also comes on automatically when it gets dark.\n\nWith the Ultra 2, Apple added a second exclusive face, the Modular Ultra. The Modular Ultra uses the outermost edge of the display to present real-time data, including seconds, altitude, or depth. It offers the most complications of any Apple Watch digital face.\n\nApple Watch Ultra: How to Activate Night Mode\n\nDurability\n\nBecause it is meant to be used for exploring and adventuring, the Apple Watch Ultra is able to withstand more extreme temperatures than standard Apple Watch models. It works in temperatures as cold as -4° F (-20° C) to to as warm as 131° F (55° C).\n\nIt is certified to MIL-STD-810H, a standard that is used for military equipment and employed by rugged equipment manufacturers. Apple says this testing includes Low Pressure (Altitude), High Temperature, Low Temperature, Temperature Shock, Contamination by Fluids, Rain, Humidity, Immersion, Sand and Dust, Freeze/Thaw, Ice/Freezing Rain, Shock, Vibration, and more.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra's display is made from a flat sapphire front crystal that is more durable than the Ion-X front glass used for the Apple Watch SE and aluminum Apple Watch Series 9 models. The flat design paired with the raised edges of the case is meant to protect the display from edge impacts.\n\nWater Resistance\n\nApple designed the Apple Watch Ultra for extreme water sports. Unlike standard Apple Watch models, it can be used for kitesurfing, wakeboarding, and recreational scuba diving to 40 meters deep. It is water resistant to a total of 100m, making it more water resistant than other Apple Watch models.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra is also certified to WR100 and EN13319, a standard for dive accessories such as depth gauges.\n\nBlood Oxygen\n\nSensors at the back of the Apple Watch Ultra support blood oxygen monitoring. Blood oxygen saturation in a healthy individual is around 95 to 100 percent, and when the percentage of oxygen in the blood drops below that, it can be indicative of a serious health issue that needs immediate attention.\n\nGreen, red, and infrared LEDs shine light onto the blood vessels in the wrist, with photodiodes measuring the amount of light reflected back. Apple's algorithms then calculate the color of the blood, which is an indication of how much oxygen is present. The Apple Watch Ultra can measure blood oxygen between 70 and 100 percent.\n\nBlood oxygen measurements can be taken on-demand using the Blood Oxygen app, and blood oxygen measurements are also taken in the background when the wrist is not moving and when the watch is used for sleep tracking.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 was facing a U.S. import ban due to the blood oxygen sensor, which the International Trade Commission claims violates patents owned by medical device company Masimo. To avoid a sales ban, Apple is now selling a version of the the Apple Watch Ultra 2 that has a disabled blood oxygen sensor.\n\nThe blood oxygen app is still present on these models, but tapping into it confirms that it is not functional at this time. If Apple does ever reach a settlement with Masimo, or wins a future appeal, the blood oxygen functionality could be reenabled through a software update.\n\nECG\n\nThe ECG app uses sensors on the bottom of the Apple Watch and the Digital Crown to take a one-lead electrocardiogram. It detects heartbeat and rhythm, and can let users know if atrial fibrillation is detected or if the heart is in a normal sinus rhythm.\n\nA single-lead ECG like the Apple Watch means there are two points of contact measuring the electrical sensations of your heart. Clinical electrocardiograms done by your doctor can have six to 12 leads for greater accuracy, but the Apple Watch offers the convenience of being able to take an ECG anytime anywhere in approximately 30 seconds.\n\nHeart Rate Tracking\n\nLike all Apple Watch models, the Apple Watch Ultra has a set of optical sensors for measuring heart rate. It is able to provide irregular heart rate notifications should atrial fibrillation be detected, plus it can inform users when their heart rate is too high at resting or too low.\n\nSleep Tracking\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra can be worn at night to keep track of your sleep. It monitors when you're awake and when you're asleep, letting you know how much time you spent in the REM, Core, and Deep sleep stages. It also lets you know how often you've woken up in the night and for how long.\n\nFall Detection\n\nThe sensors in the Apple Watch are able to determine if you've taken a hard fall, alerting emergency services if there is no response. Fall detection is enabled by default for older adults, but anyone is able to turn it on in the Apple Watch settings.\n\nTemperature Sensing\n\nThere are two temperature sensors in the Apple Watch Ultra, including one that measures the temperature at the wrist and one that measures the ambient temperature in the air to cut down on outside bias.\n\nThe temperature sensor is used for the Depth app, but its main purpose is for women's health. It is able to take temperature readings every five seconds when the wearer is asleep, aggregating the data in the Health app. Temperature fluctuations can provide data on overall health, but it is also useful for fertility planning.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra is able to deliver retrospective ovulation estimates, letting them know when they might have ovulated for better cycle tracking. Apple says temperature sensing can improve period predictions for those who menstruate.\n\nAll Apple Watch Ultra models feature cellular connectivity, but an additional service plan from a carrier is required to use the feature. The Apple Watch connects over LTE, and does not support 5G like the iPhone.\n\nThe Apple Watch does not require an iPhone for an internet connection and it can connect to LTE networks on its own. LTE through a carrier does, however, require an iPhone as Apple Watch and iPhone cellular plans are linked.\n\nAlong with LTE, the Apple Watch Ultra features a W3 Apple wireless chip and a second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip for interfacing with other devices equipped with UWB chips such as the modern iPhone models. It also supports Bluetooth 5.3.\n\nThe new second-generation Ultra Wideband chip enables highly accurate short-range wireless that Apple says supports new experiences like Car Keys, the feature that allows an Apple Watch (or iPhone) to be used in lieu of a physical car key.\n\nThe UWB chip also allows the Apple Watch to track AirTags, and it allows an Apple Watch to use Precision Finding to track down a misplaced iPhone, even if it is in the same room. With the HomePod, when an Apple Watch gets within four meters of a HomePod that is playing audio, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 shows a Now Playing interface for media control. If nothing is playing on the HomePod, the Apple Watch shows media suggestions at the top of the Smart Stack.\n\nEmergency SOS\n\nAll Apple Watch models support Emergency SOS, a feature that contacts the local emergency services when the side button is pressed and held. Emergency SOS also notifies emergency contacts and it lets them see the Apple Watch wearer's location.\n\nSiren\n\nThere is an 86-decibel emergency siren available on the Apple Watch Ultra that can be used in emergency situations to draw attention to a location. The sound uses two alternating patterns, including a distress pattern and a second that matches the universally recognized SOS pattern.\n\nApple says the siren can be heard up to 600 feet or 180 meters away. The siren can be activated by pressing and holding on the Action button or the Side button.\n\nApple Watch Ultra: How to Activate, Cancel, and Disable the Siren\n\nCrash Detection\n\nUpdated motion sensors and an advanced sensor-fusion algorithm allow the Apple Watch Ultra to detect a severe car crash and alert emergency services. After a crash is detected, the Apple Watch checks in with the user and then dial emergency services after a 10-second period with no response. It can also alert emergency contacts.\n\nGPS\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra includes dual-frequency GPS that integrates the L1 frequency and the L5 frequency for better GPS accuracy, plus it has new positioning algorithms.\n\nAccording to Apple, the Apple Watch Ultra provides the most accurate GPS of any Apple Watch to date for more precise distance, pace, and route data for training and competing purposes.\n\nThe L5 frequency is able to work better in urban environments where there are a lot of trees and other obstacles to deal with. Apple uses the GPS function with Apple Maps for more accurate road, bike, and trail routes."
