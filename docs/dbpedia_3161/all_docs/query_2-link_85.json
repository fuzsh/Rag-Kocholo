        "text": "Today, the good old plotter at the helm has a lot to worry about! With the democratization of tablets, more and more people are turning to these little gems of technology to add to their aging chartplotter or even replace it altogether and are wondering which GPS tablet for navigation to choose. Even if it is easy to buy a tablet, certain criteria should not be taken lightly in order to make the best choice to accompany oneself in navigation. GPS, A-GPS, Galileo, Beidou, Glonass, are these terms Chinese for you? Is it better to buy an Android or iOS (Apple) tablet? No problem, by reading this article, you will become an expert on the question: which GPS tablet for navigation to choose?\n\nAh, that eternal question! The Apple brand or an Android tablet? That’s a bit of an unanswered question. Everybody has their own opinion and experience on the question. Some may argue that Apple is the ultimate brand, with products of impeccable quality and would not see themselves living with another brand. Faced with this question, some may even give answers such as “Apple obviously, 99% of malwares are on Android!“(recently read on one of the many sailing groups we’re part of). It is in any case indisputable that Apple is a recognized and rather (very) reliable brand. On the other hand, I hope your wallet is well stocked because some models sell for almost twice what an Android tablet is worth with similar features.\n\nOn the other side, there are a multitude of tablets powered by Android, the undisputed market leader. The manufacturers are numerous (Samsung, Huawei, Asus, Lenovo) and you can find everything. One must remain vigilant and not drown under the mass of information – or non-information – which only makes the choice more complicated. The specifications you can find on third-party sites are often partial and you can quickly find yourself buying a tablet with features that don’t actually match what you want.\n\nAs the competition is raging, it is also very difficult to find the one tablet that stands out from the crowd. And some models are sometimes so similar that it’s hard to make a personal opinion.\n\nThe choice can also be guided by your favorite navigation software. If you are starting from scratch, then you probably won’t give much importance to this, but if you are already used to specific softwares or apps, then your choice can be made on a tablet equipped with the operating system compatible with these softwares or apps. For example, Sailgrib is only available on Android.\n\nHere too, there is a bit of everything and in all sizes. Between 7 or 8 inches in HD, 8 or 9 inches in full HD or more, a whole bunch of options are available. For navigation, it is essential to have a big enough screen so that you don’t have to get within a few centimeters of the screen to see something. A 9-inch screen seems to us to be the minimum. On the other hand, too big, it will be complicated to hang the tablet a little everywhere in the cockpit.\n\nThe type of screen also varies: on the one hand, LCD screens that offer a good display quality. And on the other hand AMOLED screens, screens with light-emitting diodes, with thinner screens (thus a lighter tablet), and better depths in the colors. This may not be the main criterion, but with the sun and reflections, it can be good to have an easily readable screen.\n\nThe shortcut is often made by some people between LTE/Cellular = GPS positioning. This is false, and true in a sense at the same time.\n\nAndroid tablets (not all, but the vast majority today) are equipped with dedicated GPS chips that allow them, without LTE and no operator network, to position themselves on the whole earth. No need to take an LTE model and put a SIM card inside to benefit from satellite positioning. Of course, if you own an LTE tablet, you will be able to buy local SIM cards in the countries you visit and enjoy the internet wherever you are (as long as there is a network). But on our side, we already have our phones that will allow us to do this, so it was clearly not a criterion. An LTE tablet is also more expensive than a WiFi tablet. If the primary purpose is navigation (and watching movies for example), then the WiFi model is more than enough. We will still have to check which positioning system is picked up by the chip, but we’ll talk about that in the next paragraph.\n\nOn the Apple side, beware: WiFi tablets do not receive your positioning via a GPS chip! You will eventually be able to have a positioning when you are connected to a Wifi. This means that, a few nautical miles from the coast, it will quickly become impossible to position yourself. Indeed, the GPS chip is in the Cellular part. It will thus be necessary to opt for the Wifi+Cellular model. iPads are already pricey, but knowing the above will force you to add some extra cash when going to the cash desk in order to leave with a tablet useful for navigation. However, same thing as for Android tablets: a SIM card is not necessary to take advantage of the positioning. The GPS part in the Cellular is independent of this SIM card.\n\nThis article is dedicated to “which GPS tablet for navigation to choose“. So it’s time to talk about the point that is probably the most important one of all: GPS, or should I say the positioning system. Because this is indeed the primary objective: to position oneself as accurately as possible on a nautical chart.\n\nI’m talking about a positioning system and not GPS on purpose, because there are a whole bunch of different positioning systems out there: GPS, Galileo, Glonass, Beidou, QZSS and others!\n\nDid you think that by taking a tablet with GPS, that was it? Not so simple… Things get a bit complicated, not so much on the definition of these terms, but rather on your final choice. Explanations!\n\nAll these explanations are all well and good, but what do we do with them now?\n\nEveryone knows that the keyword on a sailboat is redundancy, so relying on a single positioning system or even questionable accuracy would probably be a mistake. As a result, the issue of integrated positioning systems has a major influence in the final choice of the ideal GPS tablet for navigation.\n\nUnfortunately, mainstream stores or online sites usually only mention: “GPS: yes. GPS Chip”. And if you don’t know anything about it, you buy the product without further question. But the reality is more complex. Some tablets will only pick up GPS signals, others GPS and Glonass, while others will be compatible with the full GPS + Glonass + Galileo + Beidou combo. The advantage of receiving several positioning systems is obviously twofold: not to depend on a single positioning system, but also to improve the accuracy of one’s position.\n\nIt’s also a question of price – as always, obviously. Most of the time, the more versatile a tablet is, the more expensive it is. Most entry-level and mid-range tablets receive the GPS + Glonass combo, while on mid-/high-end tablets you can receive GPS + Glonass + Galileo + Beidou, or even QZSS.\n\nLet’s be clear: for years, all these positioning systems didn’t exist and sailors were doing very well! But it is certain that with the democratization of these technologies, it is difficult to do without them. Having only GPS positioning is not a problem in itself either and will be sufficient in many situations.\n\nA-GPS simply means “Assisted GPS” . Without going into technical (and boring) details, it is a technology that improves the responsiveness of the GPS in case of a weak GPS signal for example. The GPS system is based on an ephemeris table to calculate the GPS position, and you have to download this table at one point. The Assisted GPS then downloads it much faster by connecting to the internet.\n\nYou will probably find in forums here and there people who are against this system which “shifts the position of 200 meters when I approach the port” and which is “very dangerous“. Many people mix up the problems and, due to lack of knowledge, blame it on something that is not at fault. In their case, it is likely that the system, due to the lack of GPS positioning, indicated the best estimated position thanks to or because of A-GPS. It is recommended to switch to Airplane mode on the approaches to marinas because the tablet may try to connect automatically to a WiFi, quickly download these ephemeris tables and indicate whimsical positions. In any case, it is mandatory to master the technologies you have on board and it is easy to avoid this kind of problem. You must not forget to update your ephemeris tables (automatically when you connect to the Internet). But this is another issue that will certainly be addressed in another article.\n\nTo come back to the question of the best tablet to do navigation, this parameter of GPS versus A-GPS is not our main criterion.\n\nOne of the most important elements when you don’t have electricity at will: the battery. So obviously, it will have to be recharged from time to time, but it is unthinkable to have to recharge your tablet every two hours.\n\nThe capacity of a battery is measured in mAh. To get an idea, the latest iPhone usually runs between 1500 and 3000 mAh. On the tablets, the batteries will be around 5000 mAh to 9000 mAh, which generally guarantees an autonomy of about 10 hours. It is obviously extremely complicated to have a perfect idea of the tablet autonomy, simply because it depends greatly on the use you will make of it.\n\nDon’t rely on what the manufacturers announce, there can be a fairly large discrepancy. Prefer forums with feedback from (real) users.\n\nWith the SailProof SP08S, you’re immediately at the top of the game when it comes to navigation tablets. For the positionning system, it has everything we wanted from such a tablet: GPS, Glonass and Galileo. The battery is overpowering with 9800 mAh. The SP08S offers Wifi as well as LTE. And with its 1000 cd/m² – I don’t think I’ve seen more than that on the market – reading navigation maps in full sunlight is absolutely no problem at all. The SP08S is a monster of robustness: it is rugged, IP67 and MIL-STD-810G (military specification). So there’s no need to look for a waterproof case, it’s already equipped with one.\n\nExcellence has of course a price, and a weight. The SailProof is indeed above other Android tablets in terms of price, but it outperforms all others in terms of performance. As for the weight, let’s not forget that the weight displayed takes into account the rugged case, unlike other tablets that only displays the weight of the tablet itself. And to be honest, we won’t go jogging with the SailProof in our pocket, so 400 grams or 700 grams on the tablet support at the helm doesn’t change anything.\n\nIn collaboration with SailProof, we’re glad to offer you a discount. By clicking on the link above, the SailProof SP08S tablet will be available for $827 instead of $875, which is quite nice with the promo code SAILKERGUELEN !\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 is an alternative option in terms of navigation tablets. If you’re following us for a while, you know that our first tablet was in fact its little sister, the Galaxy Tab S3.\n\nCompared to the previous Galaxy Tab, the S8 has a pretty crazy resolution, an even bigger battery (8000 mAh! ) and even more power with its Octo-Core processor.\n\nOur first criterion was the fact that it is powered by Android, which leaves us more room to install some navigation softwares (OpenCPN, Sailgrib, …) and memory expansion via SD/microSD cards. On the smartphone side, we have a Google Pixel 4 and a Google Pixel 6, which means that all our eco-system is under Android for easy synchronization, and as a bonus, less cables because everything is in USB-C!\n\nAnd our main criterion obviously, the positioning system: we have GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, QZSS and also Galileo."
