        "text": "What Is Commercial GPS Tracking?\n\nLet's begin with the name, GPS, which stands for Global Positioning System. GPS technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, providing us with accurate location information and enabling a wide range of applications, from determining an object’s whereabouts to tracking locations. These days, GPS can be used for anything from military exercises across the globe to offering directions that help driver’s get to their desired locations quickly and safely.\n\nA Deep Dive into GPS Technology\n\nAt the core of GPS technology are satellites that orbit the Earth and communicate with each other and ground-based systems. The primary distinction among 2G, 3G, LTE (4G), and satellite-exclusive GPS trackers is evident in the manner they relay location data to the user. Utilizing cellular networks (2G, 3G, or LTE/4G), these trackers transmit the acquired location data from GPS satellites to the user.\n\nAt MiX, our trackers are not solely satellite-based, rather they utilize a combination of satellite signals for location management and cellular networks for data transmission, our trackers are fitted with a sim card that allows it to communicate over various cellular networks. This communication between satellites and ground-based systems is essential for accurate GPS tracking, driver tracking, and ensuring road safety.\n\nInitially developed in the 1960s for military application, GPS technology eventually became available for public use in 1983, and advances and use cases have increased over the decades.As technology advanced and the potential applications became apparent, this opened up a whole new world of possibilities, ranging from navigation systems in cars to tracking devices for fleet management.\n\nToday, GPS technology has become an essential tool in various industries, including transportation, logistics, and personal use. Its accurate positioning capabilities have revolutionized driver tracking and enabled businesses to enhance safety measures by monitoring their fleet's movements in real-time.\n\nHow Does a GPS Tracker Work?\n\nGPS tracking requires a device to be installed in a vehicle, on an asset, or to be worn by a person. The device then provides information about its exact location and subsequent movements, enabling tracking in real-time. This is useful for fleet managers to locate where a truck or asset is on its scheduled route, report on traffic conditions, and monitor how long each vehicle spends at a job site.\n\nMiX’s GPS trackers cater to a variety of needs, depending on your fleet size and vehicle type. Our easy-to-use tracking devices can be self-installed to track fleet activities, read CAN trip data and get daily notifications about fleet performance. Plug ‘n Play is a convenient option for vehicles requiring easy installation with 3G connectivity.\n\nWhen used in tandem with MiX Fleet Manager, our GPS trackers monitor risky behaviors such as over-speeding, harsh braking, harsh acceleration, sudden cornering, and excessive idling. This assists in effectively managing trips, reducing fuel costs, and monitoring driver behavior and vehicle location.\n\nThe Space Segment\n\nThe Global Positioning System is made up of 27 satellites that orbit the Earth. Of these 27 satellites, 24 are operational, and three are backup satellites if one of the other 24 fails. These satellites orbit the Earth every 12 hours and send signals that are received by GPS receivers.\n\nThe Control Segment\n\nThe Positioning System is controlled by different tracking stations located around the globe. These stations pick up microwave carrier signals transmitted by the satellites, and the GPS receivers convert these signals into data such as velocity, time, and position.\n\nThe User Segment\n\nGPS receivers receive the signals sent by GPS satellites and use them to determine the user's position in space and time.\n\nTwo Types Of GPS Systems\n\nThere are a few ways this system can work. Commercial GPS devices are often used to record the location of vehicles during their journeys. Some systems will store information within the GPS system itself, and this is called passive tracking. Other systems regularly send data to a centralized database through a modem, and that is called active tracking or 2-way GPS.\n\nPassive GPS tracking monitors location and stores data on trips based on specific events. This type of system can log data on where the devices have been in the past 12 hours. It stores the data internally or on a memory card, which is then downloaded to a computer to be analyzed later. In some systems, the information is downloaded automatically at a set time or can be requested periodically during the journey.\n\nPassive GPS entails real-time tracking systems that automatically send information to a central tracking portal as it happens. This type of system is used on most commercial applications, such as monitoring and tracking children or the elderly, since it lets caregivers know where their charges are at all times. This type of system is also used to monitor employees' driving behavior as they work and streamline a fleet’s operations.\n\nIn terms of cost, passive GPS systems tend to be more affordable initially, as they do not require a constant data connection. These systems store location data that can be downloaded later for analysis. On the other hand, active GPS systems require a continuous data connection, which can lead to higher costs for data usage.\n\nThe benefits of active GPS systems should not be overlooked. In scenarios where real-time tracking and immediate response are crucial, such as driver tracking for safety purposes, an active GPS system would be more beneficial. These systems provide up-to-date information on the location and movements of drivers, allowing for quick action in case of emergencies or potential risks. Therefore, while passive GPS systems may be more cost-effective for certain use cases, active GPS systems offer a higher level of safety and security in situations where immediate tracking and response are essential.\n\nWhat Is GPS Tracking Used For?\n\nMost people are familiar with the most common uses of GPS technology, such as mapping and surveying, getting directions, and keeping track of loved ones for peace of mind. But there are many other uses you may never have realized were out there. GPS plays an important role in all types of applications used by the military and first responders, as well as other commercial and personal uses. Here are some of the ways GPS systems are used.\n\nMilitary Use Of GPS\n\nInitially developed by the military, GPS is still used to track troop movements, aircraft, navigation at sea, and more. This is very important for military units stationed in unfamiliar territory or on the move at night.\n\nSearch And Rescue\n\nGPS tracking is also used in search and rescue operations. It helps rescue teams keep track of where they've searched or even get information from a lost person's smartphone or GPS device.\n\nGPS Vehicle Tracking\n\nCommercial fleets are often integrated with GPS tracking to monitor their fleet vehicles. By installing GPS devices on fleet vehicles, fleet managers can track their drivers' locations and statuses, as well as get important insights about their fleet's efficiency.\n\nGPS tracking systems are a crucial part of fleet tracking to monitor fleet vehicle locations and activity, and to help improve efficiency and safety. In addition, this device makes routing and dispatching more accurate and much easier.\n\nGPS Recreational Uses\n\nMost wearable tech such as watches used for running, biking, and hiking, use GPS tracking, giving users input on distance traveled, their speed, or where they are in the wilderness. With the increase in smartphone use, almost all of us carry GPS tracking devices everywhere we go. This technology can be used in new ways, including augmented reality (AR) applications for location-based games. These types of uses will only increase in the coming years.\n\nThe Innovative Uses of GPS in Different Industries\n\nGPS technology has revolutionized various industries, including agriculture, healthcare, and retail.\n\nAgriculture\n\nIn the agricultural sector, farmers utilize GPS tracking to monitor their vehicles and assets.

You'll be able to better allocate resources based on real-time updates, so that your trucks won't take longer trips and your drivers won't spend more time on the road than they need to. This helps keep your payroll hours under control.\n\nTimesheet fraud takes place when drivers get paid for work they didn't do or for time spent on non-work activities. Sometimes drivers record more hours than they worked, retroactively edit their driving hours, or log regular hours as overtime. Not only does this cost you money, but it also can result in incorrect billing. By using GPS and electronic logs, your payroll and billing are more accurate.\n\nImproved Asset Utilization\n\nA GPS tracking telematics solution can give you insight into real arrival and departure times, stop durations, travel time from one job to another, and when your drivers are inactive. These updates can tell you if jobs are being completed in the allotted time, if there are delays - and why, if detours are taken for personal errands, and when delays occur due to a driver becoming lost. You'll know if drivers are not being utilized even if they have hours available, and you can make decisions based on real-time insights to improve overall fleet utilization.\n\nValidation Of Completed Work\n\nOn occasion, your customers may question what you've billed them for, such as if a driver attended to their job and how many hours were spent on it. GPS tracking provides records of where your drivers were, and demonstrates to your customers that they worked the hours on their invoices. Showing your customers electronic proof can build trust, loyalty and improve your customer service.\n\nAsset Tracking\n\nGPS fleet tracking software works for all assets, not just vehicles. If you have expensive mobile equipment, such as generators and trailers, you can monitor their movements with a tool like MiX Asset Manager. This empowers you to know if they are on the job sites where they are needed, and not sitting idly and unused. You'll know they are secure and accounted for. You can also set a geofence around worksites, so you'll know when they come and go from each specific site.\n\nImproved Fleet Safety\n\nImproving fleet safety saves you money and improves your company's image. Now, GPS fleet tracking solutions can alert you when your drivers are speeding, making unscheduled stops, harsh braking, or suddenly accelerating. These actions not only waste gas and increase your fuel costs, but they can also be dangerous. By monitoring these events, you can help your drivers develop better, safer driving habits.\n\nHappier Customers\n\nNo matter if your fleet is delivering products to homes or is part of a complex supply chain, your customers expect a certain type of service and convenience. Since this gives you the exact location of your fleet's vehicles and you can dispatch your vehicles far more efficiently, your customers will be happier. You can provide them with increasingly accurate estimated arrival times (ETAs), so they will know when to expect a delivery or other service.\n\nThe Future Of GPS Tracking\n\nThe future of GPS tracking holds great potential with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI).
