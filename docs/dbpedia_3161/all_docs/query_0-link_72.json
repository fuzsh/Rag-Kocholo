        "text": "So I've been doing some reading on people using tablets, specifically the iPad, as a navigation tool. Everyone seems to be on the same page that you'll need an iPad with the GPS installed but I'm struggling to find more details on actually using the unit. There are obviously several navigation and exploration maps for the iPad in the app store but will the iPad with built in GPS really be a reliable unit to be used on U.S. based off-road trails where you're not in range of cell signal? I have seen a few people with GPS boosters that plug into the tablet but would a setup like this be used with accuracy off-road? Any information would be helpful, thanks.\n\nI had the same questions when I first starting looking into nav solutions for my adventures.\n\nI have an iPad mini that doesnt come with GPS or Cell Service, just the basic wifi model with not much storage.\n\nThat iPad has become a designated GPS device and when protected by a soft case, I just double-sided-tape mount it onto my passenger side dash.\n\nThe one thing youll need is a GPS device to transmit location information to the iPad.\n\nhttp://gps.dualav.com/explore-by-lifestyle/aviation/xgps150a-for-efb-apps/\n\nI bought that device, it connects to satellites and transmits the gps location via bluetooth.\n\nThe app on the iPad is MAPS.ME, nothing fancy, and its free. The reason why I love this app is because it lets you zoom into an area, and download the map for that whole area and its a LARGE area that gets downloaded into a few megabytes. It took two map downloads to cover all of Arizona for a recent trip. You can also load .gpx files into it to load waypoints or even a whole route. There area few other features I like and its never let me down. Even helped me navigate 550 off road miles through British Columbia.\n\nif you have an IPAD with a Cell service option, (even without it activated) the GPS will work great, i use several different GPS aps.\n\nIf you don't have a Cellular Ipad, you can always use a Bedelf BT GPS adapter.\n\nI use my iphone 6 on my dual sport, and i use my ipad, in the truck as well as my sail boat.\n\nI love it!\n\nif you have an IPAD with a Cell service option, (even without it activated) the GPS will work great, i use several different GPS aps.\n\nIf you don't have a Cellular Ipad, you can always use a Bedelf BT GPS adapter.\n\nI use my iphone 6 on my dual sport, and i use my ipad, in the truck as well as my sail boat.\n\nI love it!\n\nWhat gen / iPad are you using?\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\nFor the price of that GPS puck you can buy an Android table with the functionality built in. I use a Lenovo 7\" tab A2 (there are newer ones out now) and for $100 it will get you everything you need including an SD card slot for adding maps. I use Back Country Navigator and Here (both off line) without issues.\n\nFor the price of that GPS puck you can buy an Android table with the functionality built in.

Love to see your setup any YT vids or anything?\n\nI've been using cellular iPads for years.\n\nStarted with a 1st gen (AT&T) model with 32GB of memory. Upgraded to a 2nd gen (Verizon) unit with 64GB and last year pulled the trigger on a new iPad PRO (Verizon) with 128GB.\n\nCurrently have about 70GB of maps downloaded. Works flawless as a GPS device (I prefer GAIA GPS) and I can also use it for photo editing (Adobe Lightroom) in camp and on the road...\n\nI also use it at home for most internet functions. It's nice to sit in my favorite chair and not at a desk..."
