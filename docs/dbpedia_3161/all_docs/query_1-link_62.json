        "text": "Anyone who owns an older model Apple iPhone or iPad could experience a device-breaking problem on Nov. 3, according to Apple.\n\nThe issue could affect iPhone and iPad models introduced in 2012 and earlier.\n\n“If you don’t update to the newest version of iOS available for your device before November 3, some models might not be able to maintain an accurate GPS position. And functions that rely on the correct date and time—such as syncing with iCloud and fetching email—might not work,” Apple said in a blog post.\n\nThe problem is because of the GPS time rollover on April 6. Affected Apple devices won’t be impacted until just before 12 a.m. UTC on Nov 3.\n\nThe iOS update will solve the problem, enabling the device to maintain accurate GPS location and keep the correct date and time.\n\nDevices affected include iPhone 4s and 5, third and fourth-generation iPad, iPad mini and iPad 2. Learn specifics of affected models and how to update the operating system on the Apple website.\n\nIf not updated, these devices might not be able to maintain accurate GPS position or perform functions that require accurate time, such as properly syncing with iCloud or fetching email. The devices also might not be able to receive over-the-air software updates. As a result, the only way to update the device will be to restore it via iTunes or Finder through a tethered connection."
