        "text": "CC: DJI representative\n\nHey there! Another question regarding satellite or gps when flying outside of US territory. I currently have a cellular and wifi on my IPAD air 2. When I'm not connected to wifi can i still get satellite reception or do i need to buy local plans?\n\nWhat if i only have wifi and no cellular?\n\nAs answered to me by Aardvark \"Well being outside US territory does not mean you are on another planet (although some might disagree ). The Global Positioning System relies on you being able to receive direct signals from a cluster of satellites orbiting the planet. So you're covered there (If you have cellular then your device will have GPS receiver, as does the aircraft). And you don't need wifi to fly. You may be able to cache the local maps onto your display device.\n\nAs @labroides says, GPS is global (and GLOSNASS (sp?) is the Russian equivalent and at least the Phantom 4 supports it - I can't recall the specs of the other models). It works everywhere without other external data. Think about it - the drone has to know where it is always, even when it loses connection to the RC!\n\nThe thing I am reading up on at the moment as a new owner is related and would welcome other comments: How are the google maps loaded / cached? Is it enough to use the native Google Maps \"offline areas\" feature and download to the device in advance of leaving 'net coverage? Most importantly for me the satellite view.\n\npeter@wonderlan Posted at 2016-8-29 16:28\n\nAs @labroides says, GPS is global (and GLOSNASS (sp?) is the Russian equivalent and at least the Pha ...\n\nYou cache the maps in the DJI Go app.\n\nJust open the camera view and click on the map window to make it full screen.\n\nThen look around the area of interest at the scale you want.\n\nYou've now cached a map.\n\nOn Android, it comes from Google but Apple devices use Apple's own maps."
