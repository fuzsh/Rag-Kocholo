        "text": "Differential corrections\n\nTo improve the accuracy of your positions, consider using a GPS receiver that supports differential corrections. Differential correction technology further improves accuracy by using reference stations, which are also known as base stations. A reference station is another GPS receiver that is established at a known location. The reference station estimates its location based on satellite signals and compares this estimated position to the known position. The difference between these positions is applied to the estimated GPS position calculated by the user's GPS receiver, also called the rover, to get a more accurate position. The user's receiver must be located within a certain distance of the reference station for differential corrections to occur. Differential corrections can be applied in real time in the field or when postprocessing data in the office.\n\nField Maps does not support postprocessing.\n\nDifferential corrections can be provided by public or commercial sources. One of the most widely used and publicly accessible real-time correction sources is the Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS), which is also commonly referred to as the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in the United States. It is free to use SBAS, but your GPS receiver must support it. Using commercial correction services typically requires a subscription and may also require purchasing a particular type of GPS receiver that can receive these correction signals. See Differential GPS Explained in ArcUser for more information.\n\nDatum transformations\n\nThe locations provided by your receiver may be based on a different geographic coordinate system than the map you are using in Field Maps. If this is the case, use a datum transformation to maintain the accuracy of your data.\n\nWhen you receive a location from a GPS and use it to add or update a feature, that location is in geographic coordinates that are referenced to a geographic coordinate system (GCS). Your map also has a coordinate system, determined by the basemap it uses, which may be a GCS or a projected coordinate system (PCS). If the location and map are based on different geographic coordinate systems, the location being added or updated must be transformed to match the map's coordinate system. This conversion process is called a datum transformation. While there are both horizontal and vertical datum transformations, Field Maps only supports horizontal transformations.\n\nSince coordinates, maps, feature layers, and databases all have coordinate systems, a datum transformation (or transformations) should occur anytime your coordinate system doesn't match that of where the data is being used: between the GPS and the map, the map and the feature layer, or the feature layer and the geodatabase. Whenever a datum transformation is used, error is introduced into your locations. By choosing the right coordinate systems for your map, feature layers, and databases, you can limit the number of transformations, as well as the error introduced each time. See ArcGIS Geographic and Vertical Transformation Tables for details on the error introduced through various transformations.\n\nIf the coordinate systems don't match and no datum transformation is provided, the data is used as it is provided. As a result, its location won't align with the locations of other data already in place. Similarly, you'll see incorrect positions if you provide the wrong datum transformation.\n\nIn Field Maps, you can set up a location profile prior to collection and specify the specific datum transformation to use. While creating a location profile, the coordinate systems of both the GPS data and the map are specified. Based on this information, you are presented with only relevant transformation methods, with the recommended method listed first. As the map author, you should either set up the location provider and profile in Field Maps or provide to your mobile workers the coordinate systems of the GPS and the map, as well as the transformation method they should use when they configure Field Maps.\n\nIf you are using one of the basemaps provided by Esri in ArcGIS Online, it is in the WGS84 coordinate system. Similarly, WGS84 is the default coordinate system for GPS data received in Field Maps. If you are using an ArcGIS Online basemap and the default location provider, no datum transformations are necessary in Field Maps.\n\nGrid-based transformations\n\nGrid-based transformations are supported in Field Maps. These transformations use files to calculate positions and require the files to be on your device. To use a grid-based transformation, the files must be downloaded or copied (sideloaded) onto your device. If your datum transformation is grid based and requires files, you'll be prompted to download it when setting up your location profile.\n\nIf you'd rather copy the files directly to your device, you can get them from an installation of ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap (you may need to install the Coordinate Systems Data setup in addition to the main product setup to get specific grid-based transformation files). Copy them to your device in one of the following ways:\n\nOn Android—Plug your device or SD card into your computer. Using a file explorer on your computer, browse to \\Android\\data\\com.esri.fieldmaps\\files\\PEData (if that folder doesn't exist, create it). Copy the files for the grid-based transformation to that PEData folder.\n\nOn iOS—Use the Files app or iTunes to copy the files for your grid-based transformation to the documents for Field Maps, placing them in a PEData folder.\n\nTip:\n\nTo update a folder in the app's documents using iTunes, first save the folder from the device, make your changes to it, and then upload it. The new folder replaces the previous one.\n\nYou must maintain the folder structure in the PEData folder the same as it is structured for ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap. For example, to copy the files for the Old_Hawaiian_To_NAD_1983_HARN_Hawaii + ~NAD_1983_To_HARN_Hawaii transformation, add to the PEData folder on your device a folder named harn, containing the files ohdhihpgn.las, ohdhihpgn.los, hihpgn.las, and hihpgn.los.\n\nYou must maintain the folder structure in the PEData folder the same as it is structured for ArcGIS Pro.
