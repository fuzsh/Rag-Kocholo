        "text": "If Apple Maps isn't working, you probably need a stronger internet connection.\n\nEven if you have an internet connection, Apple Maps also needs a strong GPS signal, which isn't always easy to get.\n\nApple Maps also needs Location Access permission, which you can manage in the Settings app.\n\nApple Maps can be incredibly convenient when you're lost, but even more frustrating when it won't work correctly.\n\nIf your Apple Maps app isn't working, there are a few likely reasons why. Here are some tips to get it working again.\n\nMake sure you're connected to the internet\n\nIt might sound too simple to be true, but weak internet connections are the most common reason for errors in any app. That's especially true for Apple Maps, which needs a consistent internet connection to load new map data and directions.\n\nFirst of all, make sure that you have any internet signal, whether it's Wi-Fi or mobile data. If you're connected to Wi-Fi, try getting closer to the internet access point (usually your router). If you're using mobile data, move somewhere that has a stronger cellular connection.\n\nIf you're downloading apps or files in the background, your internet signal might be too clogged to load Apple Maps data. Disconnecting from your current internet signal and then reconnecting can help sometimes too.\n\nCheck your sound\n\nIf the issue you're running into is that you can't hear the directions that Apple Maps is giving, there might just be a problem with your sound.\n\nMake sure that the volume is turned up. You'll also want to tap the speaker icon on the navigation screen, and pick the first option that shows sound waves coming out of the speaker.\n\nLastly, make sure that you know where the sound is coming from. If you've plugged your iPhone into your car's charging port, for instance, the sound might be trying to come out of your car's speakers instead of the iPhone. Same goes if your iPhone is still connected to your AirPods, or another set of Bluetooth headphones.\n\nGet a stronger GPS signal\n\nAlthough they're not obvious about it, navigation apps like Apple Maps still use GPS signals, not just internet. This is why Apple Maps might lose your location when you head underground, like in the subway. And if you lose your GPS signal, Apple Maps won't know how to give you accurate directions.\n\nThe best way to keep your GPS signal is to give your iPhone a clear, unobstructed view of the sky. This lets your phone connect to GPS satellites flying overhead.\n\nTurn on Location Access\n\nIf your iPhone is clearly connected to both internet and GPS, but Apple Maps still can't find you, there's a chance that you might have accidentally turned off Location Access. Apple Maps needs this turned on to track your current location.\n\nTo turn it back on, open your iPhone's Settings app and scroll down to tap Privacy & Security, and then Location Services.\n\nHere, make sure that Location Services is toggled on, then scroll down and tap Maps. Turn on Precise Location, and then select either While Using the App or While Using the App or Widgets.\n\nRestart Apple Maps and try to use it again.\n\nCorrect your iPhone's time and date settings\n\nSome apps will run into errors if your iPhone's time and date aren't set correctly. This is because if your iPhone tries to retrieve info from another server that thinks it's a different date, the info it receives won't match up with what it's expecting.\n\nThe best way to fix this is to set your iPhone's time and date to \"Automatic.\" This means that your iPhone will stay synchronized with Apple's servers, making sure you'll always have the right time and date for your location.\n\nOpen the Settings app and scroll down to tap General, and then Date & Time. Toggle on Set Automatically.\n\nRestart Apple Maps and your iPhone\n\nSometimes a quick refresh is all an app — or iPhone — needs to get things working again.\n\nRestart Apple Maps by force closing it. In other words, swipe up slowly from the bottom of your screen to open the App Drawer, then swipe up on Apple Maps to shut it down.\n\nIf that doesn't work, try restarting your iPhone. You can turn off your iPhone by opening Settings, then General, then tapping Shut Down at the bottom of the screen. Turn it on again by holding the Lock button.\n\nUninstall and reinstall Apple Maps\n\nApple Maps might be carrying around some corrupted data that's screwing things up. In this case, you should delete the app off of your iPhone and then reinstall it.\n\nYou can delete an iPhone app by holding your finger down on its icon, then tapping Remove App, Delete App, and finally Delete.\n\nOnce it's gone, reinstall the app from the App Store. It's free to download.\n\nFactory reset your iPhone\n\nIf nothing else has worked, then at this point, you're probably better off just using Google Maps. But if you're determined to get Apple Maps working, then all you can really do is factory reset your iPhone.\n\nFactory resetting your iPhone will erase every bit of data that wasn't on the phone when you first bought it. It's a pretty foolproof — albeit extreme — way to fix bugs and glitches.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions on how to safely reset your iPhone, check out our full guide on the topic."
