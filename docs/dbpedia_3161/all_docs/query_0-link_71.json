Assuming they drop support within a year that’s a decade of support for a mobile computing device that cost $500. Not to mention the ARM processors/SoCs have advanced significantly since then. Seems pretty decent to me.\n\nEndless backward compatibility is what made windows the insane bodgery that it is (and even they dropped windows 7 support after 11 years)\n\nmidwestpa24\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nMar 4, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n5,057\n\nLocation\n\nIowa\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nmidwestpa24\n\nSep 18, 2023\n\n#7\n\nHmmm, hadn't seen that.\n\nI still use my iPad Mini 4, but I only use it for Foreflight.

I get that a company doesn't want to support a device after a certain period. Fine, don't offer repairs and don't upgrade the OS.\n\nIn my case I had an iPhone which worked perfectly and was every bit as functional as the day it was introduced. You know, when people lined up around the block because it was so awesome. It still did all that cool stuff\n\nHow it went was \"your device requires a mandatory OS update. However, we don't offer an OS for your device. Goodbye\".\n\nIndeed. [sound of my wallet snapping shut]\n\nWhy couldn't they just leave me off the OS upgrade list? Maybe I would not be able to purchase apps which took advantage of recent improvements. So what? It's a phone. Slide, select contact, green button. Easy\n\nI didn't lease my phone, I BOUGHT it. Still holds a charge, buttons work, screen isn't cracked. I'll decide when it's time to move on. F*** off.\n\nIf the manufacturer of my car suggested bricking my vehicle as a way to force me to upgrade I would light it on fire on the dealer lot and go buy something old. Get off my lawn.\n\nI tolerate my iPad mini 6 because it's the only way to use Foreflight.\n\nmidwestpa24\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nMar 4, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n5,057\n\nLocation\n\nIowa\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nmidwestpa24\n\nSep 19, 2023\n\n#15\n\nThe email I received said this:\n\nBeginning later this year, iOS/iPadOS 16 will become the minimum-supported operating system for new versions of ForeFlight. Some popular devices, including the iPad mini 4, cannot update to iOS 16. However these devices will still be able to receive chart and data updates.\n\nSounds like I can keep using my Mini 4 for at least a little while longer.\n\nClip4\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nJun 27, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n9,928\n\nLocation\n\nA Rubber Room\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nCli4ord\n\nSep 19, 2023\n\n#16\n\nI don’t think it’s unreasonable to stop supporting a device that is 4-8 years old.

But seriously, apple just isnt releasing IOS updates for the device. It isnt being bricked - you continue to use the device as you see fit. However Boeing/Foreflight has said that since they need to keep moving - they arent going to release their new apps on older platforms. Thats their choice and not sure why people are getting mad on the hardware side of things. Its not like Windows 11 supports old Pentium machines either. . .\n\nRcmutz\n\nCleared for Takeoff\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 28, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n1,239\n\nLocation\n\nColumbus, OH\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nrcmutz\n\nSep 19, 2023\n\n#19\n\nSo, is Garmin Pilot any different?

Their IOS is consistent among devices, and they tightly control it. Android is more open architecture, with many variations among different hardware configurations, Samsung, Google, Motorola, LG, etc. It makes a lot harder to ensure consistent performance of the software, especially in aviation where consistency and reliability is key. That is the main reason I bought an Ipad and FF, just got tired of dealing with buggy apps and Android based tablets. But my phone is an Android based Motorola.\n\nSteamflyer\n\nPre-takeoff checklist\n\nJoined\n\nMar 23, 2022\n\nMessages\n\n441\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nSteamflyer\n\nSep 19, 2023\n\n#24\n\nFF + and iPad is pretty much required kit nowadays. Amazingly, at least a year ago, it still ran on an iPad Mini 2, though it was brutally slow. I only know the Mini for FF, but generally expect them to work for 4-5 years before becoming obsolete.\n\nFor those who never had to use paper charts and plates, you may not actually know how good FF actually is. Weather, traffic, NOTAMs, TFRs, etc. all in the palm of your hand updated automatically. What's not to like? Android tablets aren't even worth the box they come in. Apple is a closed ecosystem which means they can control and homogenize both SW and HW. For a pilot running an important app, that's a good thing. It just works.\n\n172andyou\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nAug 26, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n1,543\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\n172 Guy\n\nSep 19, 2023\n\n#25\n\nbut generally expect them to work for 4-5 years before becoming obsolete.\n\nThe devices being EOLed in the announcement above are older than that.

I run it on my Mini 4 with no problems. It's a dedicated plane device, so only GP plus a few other minor apps. I don't do DB updates with it, but it does talk to my panel via bluetooth. Will update to the 6 at some point, but no screaming need yet.\n\nmidlifeflyer\n\nTouchdown!

Amazingly, at least a year ago, it still ran on an iPad Mini 2, though it was brutally slow. I only know the Mini for FF, but generally expect them to work for 4-5 years before becoming obsolete.\n\nFor those who never had to use paper charts and plates, you may not actually know how good FF actually is. Weather, traffic, NOTAMs, TFRs, etc. all in the palm of your hand updated automatically. What's not to like? Android tablets aren't even worth the box they come in. Apple is a closed ecosystem which means they can control and homogenize both SW and HW. For a pilot running an important app, that's a good thing. It just works.\n\nI love the \"important app\" kool-ade line as a way of dissing Android. I guess medical apps like those to monitor diabetes aren't quite as important And the idea that FF as opposed to its competitors is essential is ridiculous.\n\niOS is indeed the leader in the aviation arena. But IMO that's mostly about history than any Inherent superiority of one OS over the other. By the time the first Android tablet came along, Foreflight and WingX were solidly in the aviation market. From the very beginning, that was going to be a difficult thing to overcome and a disincentive to heavy development for the Android OS.\n\n(BTW, I guess I should mention I've been a Foreflight user for over 12 years.)\n\nPinecone\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nMay 24, 2022\n\nMessages\n\n4,090\n\nLocation\n\nMD\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nPinecone\n\nSep 20, 2023\n\n#31\n\nYou are completely wrong!

And a Cessna 172 was about $34,000 new.\n\nMooneyDriver78\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nAug 13, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n4,588\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nTom\n\nSep 20, 2023\n\n#32\n\nGP has had no similar announcement.

I had ADSB (traffic and weather), auto follow and used dynamic maps. When I was in an airspace with lots of traffic targets and airports other objects, the screen refresh would start hanging…it was maxed out.\n\nI had to switch to old static government charts just to get it to work right again.\n\nHang 4\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nAug 18, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n2,445\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nHang 4\n\nSep 20, 2023\n\n#33\n\nGP did not run well on my Mini 4, so goes to show everyone’s needs are different.

I have all of those features enabled as well, have not had any hang ups, though I think the refresh rate on zooming in and out of enroute and sectional charts would be better with a 6.\n\nClip4\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nJun 27, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n9,928\n\nLocation\n\nA Rubber Room\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nCli4ord\n\nSep 20, 2023\n\n#34\n\nFF + and iPad is pretty much required kit nowadays.

I used paper charts and yes, the IPad and EFBs were a welcome change many levels, but there are several products <50% of the cost of FF that get the job done quite nicely.\n\nRandomskylane\n\nLine Up and Wait\n\nJoined\n\nJun 2, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n668\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nRandomskylane\n\nSep 20, 2023\n\n#35\n\nYou are completely wrong!

I upgraded to a Mini 6 but mostly for the improved screen, which really is better. Functionally the 4 and older GP version served me fine.\n\nLast edited: Sep 21, 2023\n\nmidlifeflyer\n\nTouchdown!
