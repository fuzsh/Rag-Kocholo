        "text": "Marine Service Provider\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2014\n\nPosts: 6,103\n\nIPad for Navigation FAQ 2018\n\nHowdy!\n\nI am considering purchase of a new or newer used iPad to use for a portable navigation device. I have read previous threads (some are several years old) and at this time I am not really interested in a windows laptop solution or an Android phone or tablet solution. My questions are focused on the iPad.\n\nYour opinions or advice or experience with this would be appreciated.\n\nAt this point, don't assume I know much about these, so when you respond, please answer in language that would help not only me but others who may read this thread in the future. I see this as a FAQ for 2018, where basic questions and answers and tips can be shared.\n\nWhile my questions are basically about the hardware, I recognize that the software apps is what may make one solution better than another. If you want to suggest an app for the iPad navigation, please do. I am sure others reading this thread may learn something from any advice or a different POV.\n\n______________\n\nBackground:\n\nI currently own a 2014 Apple 4th Generation (Retina) 32gb iPad that I have been using much more than a laptop for several years. I love it. So, I am comfortable with the iPad operation, and have used one on a cruise for reading and email (but not for navigation). I have the WIFI only model now, and it does not have a Cellular GPS chip in it, so I don't use any nav app on it today. I am now looking to upgrade to either a relatively new model iPad (2017) or a used iPad Air (with cell chip GPS). I am considering the iPad Pro 10.5 model and the iPad Pro 12.9 models too, because I would like to use the Apple Pencil for other tasks.\n\nI recognize the iPad Pro 12.9 is larger and harder to hold by hand. But, I expect I would purchase a suction mount holder for it to be used in a waterproof case and mounted (temporarily) on a bulkhead of the cockpit or under a dodger. Or used only below for navigation and planning, etc. The larger display size appeals to me. I do not find the iPad MINI big enough, for my purposes or taste.\n\nI have also considered purchasing the iPad 12.9 for my own use (general use, navigation charts, etc.) and also purchasing an older 9.7 inch iPad Air2 (with cellular GPS chip included in it) or an IPad Pro 10.5 model to use in the cockpit, probably in a waterproof case or sleeve. I am not currently an owner of TWO iPads, so I don't know if sharing apps or app (chart navigation) type data between the two would be a hassle or easy. In a perfect world, the two would somehow share data, and would have the same nav apps on them both (for redundancy) even if one was intended for use in the cockpit and one intended in the saloon/chart table.\n\nYour opinions or advice or experience with this would be appreciated.\n\nI admit my current inexperience of use of these device for navigation, and I may have some misconceptions or misunderstandings today. I would like to learn the best steps for moving forward to find a solution that fits my infrequent needs.\n\n_________________\n\nFAQ Questions\n\n1. Is the internal GPS of some of the cellular chip iPads suffcient or adequate for offshore use and coastal use without having a cell phone contract? I am aware that not all iPads have the internal GPS (only those with a cellular chip do, according to Apple). I would not register the cellular SIM card (I don't want to use the iPad with a cellular data plan) so does that make a difference? My understanding is that all that matters is that the iPad have the cellular GPS chip, and that one does not need to be on a cellular system (or contract) to use the GPS functions in apps while offshore. Is that correct?\n\n2. Would it be better (instead of buying a iPad with internal GPS chip) to use a GPS dongle or Bluetooth GPS device (Garmin makes one called Garmin GLO that can provide GPS Bluetooth signals to more than one mobile device on a boat)? Is there enough difference in accuracy to warrant using the external GPS device (such as the Garmin) rather than depending upon the internal GPS? I find the Garmin GLO device appealing because it can provide data to more than one device on the boat. It costs about $100, which I find reasonable for what it does. I am aware there are cheaper GPS dongles, but they are not Bluetooth.\n\n3. Garmin has recently made some changes (buying other companies, discontinuing some charts, the BlueCharts as I recall). Does Garmin still provide a good solution for a navigation app on the iPad, or is it now obsolete and better to go with another vendor?\n\n4. Has anyone used the iPad Pro 12.9\" model on a sailboat, at a chart table? In the cockpit or under a dodger on a pedestal mount or on a bulkhead mount? Which mounts? Which protective cover or waterproof sleeve did you use, if any?\n\nAny problems reading the iPad navigation charts or app in daylight conditions in the cockpit?\n\n5. I would like to use Active Captain too. Is there a problem using it with iPads?\n\n6. I would eventually like to learn to use OpenCPN. But at this point I understand that requires either a windows laptop or android mobile tablet or phone. I can put that off for now.\n\n7. IF you use an iPad Pro 12.9\" on your boat:\n\nHave you used the 12.9 in the cockpit?\n\nHave you used it in a waterproof case of some type? Which?\n\nHave you mounted it to the deck, bulkhead of cockpit, or pedestal? If so, how?\n\n8. If you use an iPad 9.7 or 10.5 in the cockpit:\n\nHave you used it in a waterproof case of some type? Which?\n\nHave you mounted it to the deck, bulkhead of cockpit, or pedestal? If so, how?\n\n9. Have you used different navigation apps and if so, which one have you found the best and why?\n\n__________\n\nThose are my current questions. I would appreciate your advice, opinions, tips, etc.\n\nWhat about OpenCPN and Android Tablets?\n\nI have considered going with a windows laptop running OpnCpt but I do not want to do so at this time. I do not want to invest in windows computers now, nor windows or android devices at this time, if I can put together an Apple, iPad based system for my needs. In the future, I may change to a dedicated nav system based on OpenCPN, but I don't have a strong need or desire for that now."
