This is a decision made by the tour/promoter to prevent ticket resellers from purchasing large amounts of tickets, resulting in more tickets being available to the general public.\n\nFor our events, Paperless Tickets are sold through Ticketmaster directly. A person purchasing Paperless Tickets is given a confirmation of their purchase. They will then have to present the credit card used to purchase the tickets on entry the day of the event. The credit card is processed using a Paperless Ticket scanner and a receipt is printed on the spot with your seating location. If you purchase more than one ticket on a single order, all the members in your group will need to enter at the same time.\n\nIf you purchased Paperless Tickets as a gift and will not be attending the show, please call our Fan Services Hotline at 416-815-5982 to inquire about available options.\n\nEach person attending an event must produce a valid event ticket, pass or authorized credential for that event or game. Once a fan has exited the building, they are not allowed re-entry into the facility.\n\nValid tickets for Maple Leafs and Raptors home games consist of: (i) physical tickets distributed by MLSE and Ticketmaster; and (ii) “mobile tickets” displayed on a mobile device using the applicable team’s or Ticketmaster’s mobile application, mobile version of the team or Ticketmaster website, or within a phone’s Apple/Android wallet. Be advised that “print-at-home” PDF tickets, 8 ½ x 11 paper tickets or screen shots do not constitute as valid tickets and will be denied entry into Scotiabank Arena.\n\nAccessible Seating\n\nAt Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, we strive to make it as easy as possible to purchase accessible seating tickets at our venues. Scotiabank Arena offers multiple accessible seating areas to better accommodate our guests. In saying this, it is important to remember that availability and type of accessible seating tickets will vary based on our policy and/or the type of event taking place.\n\nFor Scotiabank Arena events, order your tickets through Ticketmaster by phone at 1-855-682-6736 or request accessible seating tickets online by clicking the accessibility icon, then selecting “Wheelchair Accessible” under the Type of Accessible Seating tab.\n\nAccessible seating areas are solely for persons with disabilities and their companions.\n\nBy purchasing an accessible seating ticket through Ticketmaster, you agree to the following: The ticket will be used only by a person with a disability and his/her companion. A ticket holder may be denied entry to or removed from an accessible seating area if he or she or the legitimate companion does not have a disability. If this occurs, Scotiabank Arena shall have no obligation to provide alternate seating. If Ticketmaster or the event provider believes, in its sole discretion, that your order violates or may violate this policy, Ticketmaster may cancel your order without notice.\n\nSide View Seating\n\nSide view seats are located immediately beside the stage and will provide the fan with a vantage point that does not look straight onto the stage.\n\nRear View Seating\n\nRear view seats are located behind the stage. These can be limited view depending on the stage configuration and the direction in which the artist chooses to perform.\n\nObstructed Seating\n\nRelative to the playing or performing area, obstructed seats have limited sightlines due to some type of obstruction (i.e. equipment, building apparatus, cable drop, etc.). In this case, the view will be limited and there may not be a clear view of the entire playing or performing area.\n\nStanding Room Tickets\n\nScotiabank Arena standing room tickets in row 19 of Sections 307-313 and 317-323. These tickets will indicate a seat number however this is only to direct fans where to stand, there will be no chairs provided in this section.
