        "text": "Long Advice\n\nStep One: Choose Your iPad Size\n\nFor the best performance and a larger screen, the 11-inch iPad Pro is our top choice followed closely by the iPad Air 5th generation; or, if cockpit space is at a premium, the iPad mini 6th generation (2021) offers a smaller footprint. ForeFlight looks amazing on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s stunning Retina display; however, this option will leave you with a little less elbow room in the cockpit.\n\nStep Two: Choose your Connectivity\n\nNext, choose between Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi + Cellular models. The Wi-Fi + Cellular iPads contain the internal GPS chip that can be used to activate moving map capabilities in ForeFlight.\n\nThe Wi-Fi only models can be paired with an external GPS like the Bad Elf Pro to provide location fixes in flight. Other options include Sentry which provides GPS positioning as well as in-flight weather and traffic via ADS-B.\n\nSTEP THREE: CHOOSE YOUR STORAGE\n\nStorage options are 64GB, 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB (options vary based on iPad model).\n\nWe strongly recommend the 128GB option or higher. ForeFlight Mobile requires about 15.5GB for all of the U.S. airport diagrams, A/FD sheets, instrument procedures, documents, VFR sectionals, and IFR enroute charts. Canadian data can total 11GB. However, those requirements are reduced if the entire country is not downloaded at once. For example, downloading US states east of the Mississippi would require around 5GB. With 128GB and up, you will have plenty of room for ForeFlight, plus other apps, movies, or music.\n\nSentry Plus Portable ADS-B Receiver\n\nThe best gets better with new features such as automatic on-device track logging, g-Load meter, support for FLARM traffic, and much more, all with an even longer battery life. Sentry Plus is available for purchase now.\n\nLearn More\n\nSentry Plus FAQs\n\nWhere to Buy\n\niPad Accessories\n\nThese are accessories that we use ourselves. We don't accept any paid product placements. We're always looking for new ones to try - if you have something to recommend, please send us your experience!\n\nMy Go Flight - mounts, kneeboards, and more\n\nPIVOT Case\n\nPIVOT’s patented tablet case and universal mounting system, designed specifically for use by pilots in the cockpit, combines a high-performance streamlined case and mount in models available for all popular EFB devices. The PIVOT system is simple, durable, affordable, and scalable to your operation.\n\nLearn More at Pivotcase.com"
