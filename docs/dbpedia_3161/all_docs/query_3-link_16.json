        "text": "20 Global Positioning System\n\nElizabeth Johnson\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\nDescribe how GPS works.\n\nDescribe the concept of a GPS array for measuring plate motion.\n\nWhy Use GPS for Plate Motions?\n\nNowadays, we use global positioning system (GPS ) technology for many things. Most of us have experienced using GPS navigation in a car to drive to a destination. Our smart phones can be GPS enabled so that apps know our location to provide us with local information such as the weather forecast or local dining options.\n\nGPS is used in many applications in the geosciences, including volcano monitoring, groundwater monitoring, and monitoring melting of glaciers. For this class, we are interested in learning how scientists use GPS to track the motion of tectonic plates!\n\nThis section covers some basic background about GPS technology. if you are interested in learning more about the technology (optional), please see the references at the end of this page.\n\nFigure 5. Geodetic GPS station P311 atop the Sierra Nevada mountains at Coyote Ridge, at an elevation of 3,699 meters, near Bishop, California. This station and many others show that these mountains are currently uplifting at 1–2 millimeters per year.

To measure the minute changes in location over time, these GPS usints must be firmly attached into the ground surface. They are often deployed in remote areas, meaning they need solar panels, batteries, and satellite internet to run the instrument and transmit data (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6. A GPS monument station used by the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory.

Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) mainly provides data from the eastern United States.
