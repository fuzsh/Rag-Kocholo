After its announcement on March 21, 2017, conflicting naming conventions spawned a number of different names, including \"seventh-generation iPad\" or \"iPad (2017)\".\n\nIt is the five years core iPad tablet successor to the iPad (4th generation) where the 2013 iPad Air was released as the first iPad to be exclusive on the iPad Air lineup instead.\n\nUnlike the iPad Air 2, this iPad does not have a fully laminated display, and also lacks an anti-reflective coating.\n\nOn March 27, 2018, Apple announced its successor, the sixth-generation iPad.

The third device in the iPad line of tablets, it added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X chip with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and support for LTE networks in North America. It shipped with iOS 5, which also provides a platform for audio-visual media, including electronic books, periodicals, films, music, computer games, presentations and web browsing.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, nine variations of the third-generation iPad were offered, compared to six in the rest of the world, although some countries had only the Wi-Fi only model. Each variation was available with black or white front glass panels, with options for 16, 32, or 64Â GB of storage. In North America, connectivity options were Wi-Fi only, Wi-Fi + 4G (LTE) on Verizon, AT&T, Telus, Rogers, or Bell. For the rest of the world outside North America, connectivity options are Wi-Fi only (on the Wi-Fi model) or Wi-Fi + 3G (on the Wi-Fi + Cellular model), with the latter unavailable in some countries, as 4G (LTE) connectivity for the device is not available outside North America. The Wi-Fi + Cellular model includes GPS capability.\n\nInitially, the cellular version was titled and marketed worldwide as the \"Wi-Fi + 4G\" model, but due to regional differences in classification of 4G (LTE) connectivity outside of North America, Apple later rebranded and altered their marketing to call this the \"Wi-Fi + Cellular\" model.\n\nThe tablet was released in ten countries on March 16, 2012. It gained mostly positive reviews, earning praise for its Retina display, processor and 4G (LTE) capabilities. However, controversy arose when the LTE incompatibilities became known. Three million units were sold in the first three days.\n\nAfter only seven months (221 days) of official availability, the third-generation iPad was discontinued on October 23, 2012, following the announcement of the fourth-generation iPad. The third-generation iPad had the shortest lifespan of any iOS product. It is also the last iPad to support the 30-pin dock connector, as the fourth-generation iPad and later use the Lightning connector.\n\niPad 3rd Gen (Wi-Fi Only)\n\nYear:\n\n2012\n\nModel:\n\nA1416\n\nID:\n\niPad3,1\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2498\n\niPad 3rd Gen (Wi-Fi / Cellular AT&T / GPS)\n\nYear:\n\n2012\n\nModel:\n\nA1430\n\nID:\n\niPad3,3\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2578\n\niPad 3rd Gen (Wi-Fi / Cellular Verizon / GPS)\n\nYear:\n\n2012\n\nModel:\n\nA1403\n\nID:\n\niPad3,2\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2499\n\niPad 4\n\nThe iPad (4th generation) (marketed as iPad with Retina display, colloquially referred to as the iPad 4) is a tablet computer produced and marketed by Apple Inc. Compared to its predecessor, the third-generation iPad, the fourth-generation iPad maintained the Retina Display but featured new and upgraded components such as the Apple A6X chip and the Lightning connector, which was introduced on September 12, 2012. It shipped with iOS 6.0, which provides a platform for audio-visual media, including electronic books, periodicals, films, music, computer games, presentations and web content. Like the third-generation iPad, it has been supported by five major iOS releases, in this case iOS 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. iOS 11, which was released on September 19, 2017, did not have support for the fourth-generation iPad, because support for older 32 bit iDevices and any 32 bit apps ended also including the iPhone 5 and 5c.\n\nIt was announced at a media conference on October 23, 2012 as the fourth generation of the iPad line, and was first released on November 2, 2012, in 35 countries, and then through December in ten other countries including China, India and Brazil. The third generation was discontinued following the fourth's announcement, after only seven months of general availability.\n\nThe device is available with either a black or white front glass panel and various connectivity and storage options. Storage size options include 16Â GB, 32Â GB, 64Â GB, and 128Â GB; the available connectivity options are Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi + Cellular with LTE capabilities.\n\nThe fourth-generation iPad received positive reviews and was praised for its hardware improvements as well as the Retina display, which was also featured in the device's predecessor. Furthermore, benchmarks reveal that the fourth-generation iPad is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks twice as fast as its predecessor. During the first weekend of sales, an aggregated amount of 3 million fourth-generation iPads and iPad Minis were sold.\n\niPad 4th Gen (Wi-Fi Only)\n\nYear:\n\n2012\n\nModel:\n\nA1458\n\nID:\n\niPad3,4\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64, 128 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2604\n\niPad 4th Gen (Wi-Fi / AT&T / GPS)\n\nYear:\n\n2012\n\nModel:\n\nA1459\n\nID:\n\niPad3,5\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64, 128 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2605\n\niPad 4th Gen (Wi-Fi / Verizon & Sprint / GPS)\n\nYear:\n\n2012\n\nModel:\n\nA1460\n\nID:\n\niPad3,6\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64, 128 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2606\n\niPad 2, 3 or 4\n\nThe iPad 2 is a tablet designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. Compared to the first iPad, as the second model in the iPad line, it gained a faster dual core A5 processor, a lighter build structure, and was the first iPad to feature VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling.\n\nThe device was available initially with three storage sizes â€“ 16, 32, and 64 GB â€“ and two varying connectivity options â€“ Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi and cellular. Each variation of the device is available with either a black or white front glass panel. However, upon the release of the 3rd generation iPad in March 2012, only the 16 GB variation remained available.\n\nThe product became available in March through May 2011.\n\nThe device received generally positive reception from various blogs and publications. Although it was praised for its hardware improvement, such as the new Apple A5 chip, the software restriction on the iPad 2 and iOS in general drew criticism from various technology commentators. The device sold well in its first month of sales with 2.4â€“2.6 million units sold and 11.12 million units were sold in the third quarter of 2011.\n\nA popular product, with a lower screen resolution and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry-level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a die-shrunk version of the A5 processor. Its basic design formed the core of the first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size.\n\nOriginally shipped with iOS 4, with the release of iOS 9 the iPad 2 became the only device to have received six major versions of iOS.\n\niPad 2 (Wi-Fi Only)\n\nYear:\n\n2011\n\nModel:\n\nA1395\n\nID:\n\niPad2,4\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2560\n\niPad 2 (Wi-Fi / GSM / GPS)\n\nYear:\n\n2011\n\nModel:\n\nA1396\n\nID:\n\niPad2,2\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2416\n\niPad 2 (Wi-Fi / CDMA / GPS)\n\nYear:\n\n2011\n\nModel:\n\nA1397\n\nID:\n\niPad2,3\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2424\n\niPad 2 (Wi-Fi Only, iPad2,4)\n\nYear:\n\n2011\n\nModel:\n\nA1395\n\nID:\n\niPad2,4\n\nColours:\n\nBlack, White\n\nCapacity:\n\n16 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2560\n\niPad 1\n\nThe first-generation iPad ( EYE-pad) (retrospectively referred to unofficially as the iPad 1, or original iPad) is a tablet computer designed and marketed by Apple Inc. as the first device in the iPad lineup of tablet computers. The device features an Apple A4 SoC, a 9.7\" touchscreen display, and, on certain variants, the capability of accessing cellular networks. Using the iOS operating system, the iPad can play music, send and receive email and browse the web. Other functions, which include the ability to play games and access references, GPS navigation software and social network services can be enabled by downloading apps.\n\nThe device was announced and unveiled on January 27, 2010, by Steve Jobs at an Apple press event. On April 3, 2010, the Wi-Fi variant of the device was released in the USA, followed by the release of the \"Wi-Fi + 3G\" variant on April 30. On May 28, 2010, it was released in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.\n\nThe device received positive reviews from various technology blogs and publications. Reviewers praised the device for its wide range of capabilities and labeled it as a competitor to laptops and netbooks. Some aspects were criticized, including the closed nature of the operating system and the lack of support for the Adobe Flash multimedia format. During the first 80 days, 3 million iPads were sold. By the launch of the iPadÂ 2, Apple had sold more than 15 million iPads.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, the first generation iPad was discontinued following Apple's announcement of the IPad 2. Remaining stock of the first iPad were temporarily available from Apple at reduced price.\n\niPad Wi-Fi (Original / 1st Gen)\n\nYear:\n\n2010\n\nModel:\n\nA1219\n\nID:\n\niPad1,1\n\nColours:\n\nBlack\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2311\n\niPad Wi-Fi / 3G / GPS (Original / 1st Gen)\n\nYear:\n\n2010\n\nModel:\n\nA1337\n\nID:\n\niPad1,1\n\nColours:\n\nBlack\n\nCapacity:\n\n16, 32, 64 GB\n\nEMC:\n\n2328\n\niPad Air Range\n\niPad Air 5 (2022)\n\nThe iPad Air (5th generation), colloquially known as the iPad Air 5, is a tablet computer designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc.

The third generation iPad Pro also premiered a new design, with a screen that covers more of the front face, and has rounded corners.\n\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (Wi-Fi Only - 3rd Gen)\n\nYear:\n\n2018\n\nModel:\n\nA1876\n\nID:\n\niPad8,5, iPad8,\n\nColours:\n\nSilver, Space Grey\n\nCapacity:\n\n64, 256, 512 GB; 1 TB\n\nEMC:\n\n3223\n\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (Wi-Fi+Cell US / CA - 3rd Gen)\n\nYear:\n\n2018\n\nModel:\n\nA2014\n\nID:\n\niPad8,7, iPad8,\n\nColours:\n\nSilver, Space Grey\n\nCapacity:\n\n64, 256, 512 GB; 1 TB\n\nEMC:\n\n3224\n\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (Wi-Fi+Cell Global - 3rd Gen)\n\nYear:\n\n2018\n\nModel:\n\nA1895\n\nID:\n\niPad8,7, iPad8,\n\nColours:\n\nSilver, Space Grey\n\nCapacity:\n\n64, 256, 512 GB; 1 TB\n\nEMC:\n\n3224\n\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (Wi-Fi+Cell China - 3rd Gen)\n\nYear:\n\n2018\n\nModel:\n\nA1983\n\nID:\n\niPad8,7, iPad8,\n\nColours:\n\nSilver, Space Grey\n\nCapacity:\n\n64, 256, 512 GB; 1 TB\n\nEMC:\n\n3224\n\niPad Pro (11-inch) (1st Generation)\n\nThe third generation of iPad Pro is a line of tablet computers designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc.
