Though suggestions at this great site I located online and ordered some chart books that should be here by weeks end.\n\nI’ve been watching on YouTube the postings of a person who is doing the Loop and recently came down the TN River to the Tenn Tom. His channel today discussed what he has used for navigation, which has been Navionics on a Samsung tablet. He says he purchased an IPAD not knowing it doesn’t have “auto navigate” and it just didn’t work well. Do any of you know if he’s correct about this and have you experienced the same problems with an IPAD? Sine I have one already I would certainly prefer to use what I have, but I don’t suppose $220 is the end of the world if a Samsung will serve me better.\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts.\n\nGdavid\n\nGuru\n\nJoined\n\nJan 4, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n1,408\n\nLocation\n\nUS\n\nVessel Name\n\nGraceland\n\nVessel Make\n\nMainship 34 MK1\n\nYou need to make sure the tablet has a gps chip.

One reason to add a cellular plan for marine use is that, when out of wireless range, I find that personal hotspot works MUCH better from my iPad than from my phone. (This has been invaluable in allowing me to work from my boat when at anchor.) I assume this is because of a larger internal antenna in the iPad compared to my iPhone. If you already have a Verizon plan, adding a line for an iPad is not too expensive.\n\nScottwb96\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 22, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n382\n\nLocation\n\nUnited States\n\nVessel Name\n\nStar Weird\n\nVessel Make\n\nCamargue\n\nAnother fan of Ipads. I started with one, now use 2 - 12.9\" Pro (cellular version for GPS chip). I can sync them to my Raymarine Axiom's I have down below and also use them as stand-alone for Navionics as well as some other marine apps.\n\nLOVE having the large screens and not having to pay $3,000-$5,000 more because my screen is larger!!!\n\nThe other pic is something else I am working on for the lower helm gauge panel. Replaced my analog gauges w/ a SeaGauge (analog-2-N2K converter). Up top I get the gauge info on the Axiom 7\" screens. Down below, I have 9\" screens and will be doing a dash face-lift to incorporate a 15\" touchscreen attached to a Chromebook...\n\nAttachments\n\n20211005_153520.jpg\n\n20211005_094010.jpg\n\nSoWhat\n\nGuru\n\nJoined\n\nNov 24, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n1,636\n\nLocation\n\nUS\n\nVessel Name\n\nAdelante\n\nVessel Make\n\nIG 30\n\nYou don't have to have a cell data plan for the iPad.

I find Navionics very easy to use, $29/yr on ipad mini. If I did the ICW I would add Aquamaps.\n\nI also store all manuals on the ipad, along with numerous weather and tide apps although looking out the window has beat most of the apps to date.\n\nHippocampus\n\nGuru\n\nJoined\n\nJul 27, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n4,032\n\nLocation\n\nPlymouth\n\nVessel Name\n\nHippocampus\n\nVessel Make\n\nNordic Tug 42\n\nHave navionics on my IPad. Love it. Usually use a different cartography on the boats screens. And when particularly nervous Open on the laptop. The iPad also would mirror the MFD when you wanted. You just have the wrong iPad as others have said.

As you have determined from this forum it is loaded with great feedback and preferences, these work for me, using the 2 with GPS for Navigation, the remaining one with more storage for backup and data storage. Each helm station, flybridge and salon have Garmin Chart Plotters (12” on the FB and 9” in the Salon) all tied into NEMA 2000.\n\nI think a primary preference of the Samsung tablet is it’s ability to store (supposedly) more than 100 waypoints, not having one of those I can’t vouch for that feature, I can’t keep up with the day of the week, so the capacity of waypoints that the iPad’s store (what ever it is) is fine with me!\n\nAttachments\n\nIMG_7523.jpg\n\nLast edited: Oct 6, 2021\n\nGingerMd\n\nVeteran Member\n\nJoined\n\nSep 16, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n39\n\nVessel Name\n\nGinger\n\nVessel Make\n\nCamano 31\n\nI also use an iPad. Another option is to hook up a YachtDevices WiFi broadcaster if you have another chartplotter. I have (2) Garmin 541s that came with the boat, which are dated, but are a good backup inside and on fly bridge. The GPS from those units, as well as other N2K data are broadcast on the WiFi, so the ipad can pick it up.\n\nfirehoser75\n\nGuru\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 18, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n1,715\n\nLocation\n\nCanada\n\nVessel Name\n\nformer owner of \"Pilitak\"\n\nVessel Make\n\nNordic Tug 37\n\nI have used IPads with Navionics on board for years (probably over 10?), and am very happy with their performance. As stated, the only ones with built in GPS are the ones that are \"Cellular\" capable, but you DO NOT NEED to have a cellular plan (I never did). We found them to be very accurate (the odd, occasional error however). I never used the \"Auto Route\" function, but a person could as long as they carefully checked the route for potential \"problems\" before use or at minimum checked carefully \"as you go\". We always paid attention \"as we went\" even in often travelled waters.\n\nWe also had a Vesper 8000 AIS on board that created it's own Wifi network that the IPads could access. The Vesper had it's own GPS antenna, and this allowed a \"non-Cellular\" capable IPad to be used for navigation (if desired - I had an IPad mini (3rd IPad) like that and it worked with the Vesper). This setup also displayed the AIS targets on the IPads, and any other data from other network connected devices.\n\nOur 2002 Tug had original Raymarine electronics that still functioned well. However, I used the Plotter as basically a backup (due mainly to screen size and dated charts), and used a laptop running Rosepoint Coastal Explorer and 2 \"Cellular\" IPads for everyday navigation. Counting the individual GPS receivers in the IPads, I had a total of 5 GPS antennas and devices, so lots of redundancy (barring a total failure of the GPS system). (GPS receivers/antennas: Raymarine, Vesper, GPS puck for laptop - but it could easily connect to Vesper or the Puck, and the IPads (2))\n\nWe found that Navionics on these IPads was very reliable and easy to use. If memory serves, you can now access Active Captain info on Navionics as well. If not, there is an App for that if desired.\n\ncatalinajack\n\nGuru\n\nJoined\n\nNov 16, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n3,585\n\nLocation\n\nUSA\n\nVessel Name\n\nCatalina Jack\n\nVessel Make\n\nDefever 44\n\nYou need to make sure the tablet has a gps chip.

Not only do you get the gps, but also AIS.\n\nWhile my vessels have dedicated ais solutions, I like having this as a redundant system that I frequently use to cross check and validate what I am seeing. For $150 it’s been very solid for me now for 3+ years\n\nGdavid\n\nGuru\n\nJoined\n\nJan 4, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n1,408\n\nLocation\n\nUS\n\nVessel Name\n\nGraceland\n\nVessel Make\n\nMainship 34 MK1\n\nAll Samsungs have GPS as, I think, all androids do. It's only the Apple products that cheap out on including a GPS receiver.\n\nI should have said ipad rather than tablet. Some of the cheapest android unit's do not have a gps chip but I think you are right about all Samsung units having them.\n\nRoger Long\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined\n\nJul 14, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n451\n\nLocation\n\nAlbany\n\nVessel Name\n\nGypsy Star\n\nVessel Make\n\nGulf Star 43\n\nJust don't be one of those increasing number of idiots who think they have to follow the Navionics auto routes. They are often drawn around the inside of bends which puts the boat on the wrong side of the channel when it bends left. I've encountered a number of them coming around blind curves without enough water to starboard for me to make a proper port to port meeting or time to contact them on the radio.\n\nJc180\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined\n\nAug 22, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n232\n\nLocation\n\nU.S.\n\nVessel Name\n\nSalty Dog & Last Dragon\n\nVessel Make\n\nGulfstar 47 Sailmaster & Mainship 34 MK 1\n\nJust don't be one of those increasing number of idiots who think they have to follow the Navionics auto routes.

For the Tennessee River, the attraction of the Navionics charts is that they provide depth contours and even show roads and bridges that were inundated when the TVA dams were installed.\n\nC lectric\n\nGuru\n\nJoined\n\nOct 24, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n4,517\n\nLocation\n\nCanada\n\nVessel Name\n\nIsland Pride\n\nVessel Make\n\nPalmer 32'\n\nI will reinforce that tablets work and work well for us. Between my wife and I we use three. Two for me , one at a long range for the overview, the other on a much shorter range for detail. This one is closest to me. We have 2 Samsungs and one now older Nexus.\n\nWe use Navionics on all three. I have no idea how good/bad this is for your intended river travel so no comment about that.\n\nYou MUST ensure that whatever you buy has a GPS in it. This , for us, is important. If all the unit has is cell reception for position it WILL NOT WORK as soon as you are out of cell phone range. The cell positioning does help with quicker initial location detection but by themselves are totally useless for boats unless you are NEVER out of cell range.\n\nMy older Nexus can only use GPS signals, the Samsungs use both GPS AND GLonass. SOme more expensive Samsungs can also use the Chinese system whose name I don't remember.\n\nWhat ever you purchase make sure the unit can work directly with at least the GPS system.\n\nJc180\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined\n\nAug 22, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n232\n\nLocation\n\nU.S.\n\nVessel Name\n\nSalty Dog & Last Dragon\n\nVessel Make\n\nGulfstar 47 Sailmaster & Mainship 34 MK 1\n\nOK downloaded app. Works while I’m on WiFi. By the way, if you have an iPhone, can use hot spot feature to provide WiFi to iPad which will work. BUT left Dual gps on boat. I’m at home. Let you know over weekend how Dual gps works.\n\nWiFi ONLY iPad: Navionics app accepts gps input from both iphone hot spot and Dual XGPS150A, said another way, the boat icon moves on the maps as it should."
