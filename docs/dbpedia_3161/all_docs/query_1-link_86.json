        "text": "The Connected Aircraft is the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) brought to aviation. Leveraging new technology and much more reliable high-speed Wi-Fi connections, the Connected Aircraft is a series of solutions designed to revolutionize modern-day flying, dramatically improving fleet management, flight safety, passenger experience, aircraft maintenance, flight operations, aircraft turnaround time and costs.\n\nThe solutions connect an airplane’s components and equipment, enabling each to immediately send, receive and analyze data. This can enable more informed decision-making, operational cost reduction and an improved flying experience.\n\nUsing big data, analytics and secure communications technology, the Connected Aircraft can better anticipate issues and offer unique insights. By harnessing the power of analytics with the confidence of a secure communication link, operators can potentially avoid weather, flight disruption and additional cost, and drive faster turnaround times.\n\nHoneywell’s decades of experience and expertise in components, sensors and technology make us the smart choice for Connected Aircraft solutions. Unlike other technology companies, our data outcomes have high stakes, with lives on the line. We’re in the business of providing safety with no room for error. Our software must provide highly accurate and dependable views of what will happen along with recommended courses of action.\n\nHoneywell is committed to the Connected Aircraft as the future of aviation, and we know what’s on the line for you. Compared to many companies today offering technology solutions, we have:\n\nDeep experience in aerospace. We fully understand the industry’s issues and challenges.\n\nExperience in technology and data. The Connected Aircraft is as much about software and data management as it is about aviation hardware. We know both.\n\nUnderstanding of your challenges. Commercial aviation can be as different from defense aviation as fixed-wing aircraft are from helicopters. We work with both.\n\nAnalytical tools and approaches. We offer sophisticated tools that help you gather insight from your data.\n\nImplementation capabilities and support. We have experience in installing solutions and providing crew training and support.\n\nThe Connected Aircraft is available to both commercial and defense industry aviation, including helicopters.\n\nIn this age of connected defense, there is no substitute for seamless, reliable, fast and secure communication capabilities. As with any solution used by the defense industry, the Connected Aircraft has built-in cybersecurity and is supported by additional services, such as vulnerability assessments, predicative analytics and intrusion detection and prevention systems.\n\nWe know that mission success depends on technologies that enable informed, reliable situational awareness to support command decision-making and peak aircraft performance. As a connected defense solution, the Connected Aircraft delivers the trusted data that commanders need to make informed decisions and the secure channels they need to communicated with warfighters and assets in the field.\n\nThe Connected Aircraft enables mobile, ground and airborne command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) throughout the battlespace—helping to:\n\nAccelerate decision speed for mission effectiveness.\n\nImprove situational understanding.\n\nReduce disruptions.\n\nIncrease availability, safety and efficiency across all combat domains.\n\nNo. The benefits of the Connected Aircraft go far beyond passengers’ needs. The solution can benefit everyone who manages, works or travels by plane.\n\nFor owners and operators, the Connected Aircraft can:\n\nRevolutionize flight operations—dramatically improving aircraft turnaround time.\n\nCut troubleshooting time by up to 25% via predictive maintenance.\n\nProvide access to real-time information, which allows:\n\nFlight and fleet operations to translate aircraft data into actionable metrics to improve efficiency and save money\n\nFlight operation managers to better manage fleet trajectory and lock in schedules\n\nFor pilots and flight crews, the solution:\n\nProvides more information about the flight environment\n\nHelps all flight departments work together\n\nEnables data sharing across scheduling, flight planning, tracking and post-flight groups to:\n\nImprove strategic maneuvering.\n\nReduce flight times and optimizing route miles ahead of bad weather.\n\nProvides pilots with access to updated and customized wind and temperature information throughout all phases of the flight\n\nDelivers 3D animated views of destination airports that increase pilots’ situational awareness and allow them to see and avoid bad weather and clear-air turbulence—which can lead to improved arrival times\n\nIt allows ground and maintenance crews to:\n\nKeep operations at optimal efficiency and aircraft in optimal condition.\n\nReduce aircraft on-ground time and costs through data gateways.\n\nAdjust preparations in response to weather data and see the effect of pilot decisions on arrival time.\n\nIdentify components that will require maintenance or replacement before the aircraft lands and ensure spare parts are available, if needed.\n\nCut troubleshooting time by up to 25% via predictive maintenance.\n\nThe Connected Aircraft also benefits passengers through:\n\nShorter flights\n\nMore punctual departures\n\nEnhanced in-flight entertainment and productivity through 10X to 100X faster Wi-Fi speeds and fewer drops\n\nFewer in-flight bumps"
