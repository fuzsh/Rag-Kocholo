        "text": "Looking for input on the best Ipad to purchase for on board use for navigation and other requirements and not be out of date quickly. Something that can interface to other on board equipment to the extent possible.\n\nYou do not need the latest.. previous generation is probably more then adequate, definitely better then current MFD's in terms of price and responsiveness.\n\nBut most of all. Do not buy new. Buy from apple as \"refurbished\". Same warranty. as good as new\n\nCost less:\n\nCertified Refurbished Products\n\nWe test and certify all Apple refurbished products and include a one-year warranty.\n\nget one that is cellular ready. they have the built in gps. without cellular I do not believe that they have gps.\n\nThis isn't the case. All iPads have GPS. And cellular-capable iPads are more $ than WiFi only. So if you don't think you'll use the GPS in the iPad for navigation - maybe you are getting your GPS from another device (and you probably should because battery life with an iPad which is offshore and connected to the GPS satellites is not good) then get the cheaper WiFi version.\n\nConcur on a couple points - Apple Store refurbs are good value and look at the specs to get the brightest screen. You probably don't need a lot of memory for this use either so you can get base model or close to it. iPad screens are not great in bright sunlight. You can mitigate the 'overheating' issue by locking (turning off) the screen as soon as you stop looking at the iPad then turn on as needed.\n\nWe've used an iPad (an iPad 1 (!) which incredibly still runs iNavX and is totally functional) for coastal racing for ~6 years and it's been very useful and was a welcome 'close to free' solution when we got started doing this kind of racing. But reading the screen in daylight IS an issue, as is battery life. You can work around these things, sort of.\n\nThis isn't the case. All iPads have GPS. And cellular-capable iPads are more $ than WiFi only. So if you don't think you'll use the GPS in the iPad for navigation\n\nThat maybe the case now, but it wasn't the case on all the older models, I specifically had to buy a celluar iPad Air 2 (way back when) in order to get the GPS.\n\nAnd on that point, the iPad Air 2 that I've now owned for 8 years still runs Navionics perfectly, is still way faster than the MFDs. I imagine they are cheap now.\n\nHello. After a lot of research I have decided to buy either an Apple iPAD Pro or iPAD Air with wifi and cellular, for navigation on the boat and several other marine apps, and home use. I have 2 questions.....1) recommendations on the iPAD Pro versus ipAD Air other than the obvious fairly substantial price difference and 2) how many gigs do I really need....another substantial price changer. Thanks for any advice you can give me.\n\nI think the pro has a brighter screen. My pro is my backup to my chartplotter.\n\nI have a Samsung active tab. Less expensive than Apple, and does not need a separate case since it is ruggedized from the factory. Has worked well with my Raymarine, Balmar, and Victron apps, Navionics, and nmea2000 gateway. Standard tablet functions like games, video etc. are not up to Apple standards, but not really needed on the boat. GPS, e-mail and internet access are fine. The biggest hurdle is sunlight readability, I suspect the newest iPads are better, but delicate and more expensive.\n\nI've also been pretty happy with these, specifically using the samsung active 2 tablet. They're also very cheap on ebay. The charging port on my first one died after a year so I just bought a second... for 50$."
