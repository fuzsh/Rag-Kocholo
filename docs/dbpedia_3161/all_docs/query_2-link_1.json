        "text": "You control whether iPad and apps have information about your location.\n\nTo figure out where you are when getting directions, setting up meetings, and more, Location Services uses information (when available) from GPS networks (iPad models with Wi-Fi + Cellular), your Bluetooth® connections, your local Wi-Fi networks, and your cellular network (iPad models with Wi-Fi + Cellular, if you have Cellular Data turned on). When an app is using Location Services, appears in the status bar.\n\nWhen you set up iPad, you’re asked if you want to turn on Location Services. Afterward, you can turn Location Services on or off at any time.\n\nThe first time an app wants location data from your iPad, you receive a request with an explanation. Some apps may make a one-time only request for your location. Other apps may ask you to share your location now and in the future. Whether you grant or deny ongoing access to your location, you can change an app’s access later."
