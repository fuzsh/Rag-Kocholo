        "text": "WiFi only iPad mini 2\n\nTake iPad around town with WiFi off and in area with no WiFi for miles. Google maps is still blue dot tracking me. It will venture off the road path a little but quickly rebounds to exactly where you are.\n\nHow I found out was they kept asking me for reviews of places I went. I lost job 2 months ago and only have an iPad. I have no mobile phone with me.\n\nNow I would enjoy someone smarter than me explaining how this is possible.\n\nI reported this to apple blog 2 weeks ago and now my post is moderator blocked?\n\nModel # ME279LL/A\n\nPlease read first post.\n\nI am using a WiFi only tablet. I listed the model number. I have no WiFi connection while driving down the interstate or back roads of TN.\n\nGoogle Maps can still track me. The blue dot will track along as I drive. It is not perfect as when you have a data connection but it does move the blue dot along as I drive.\n\nI am not asking how to turn it off I am showing everyone out there that if you have a standard WiFi only iPad you have some sort or GPS capability big brother chip in it.\n\nIf you have the WiFi iPad please test what I am stating.\n\nSome things that might help explain your experience:\n\n(1) Google Maps caches the data it loads, so it might still have a valid map for your position without internet connection.\n\n(2) The accelerometer and gyroscope in your iPad allow to calculate the trajectory from a known starting point. The accuracy gets worse over time.\n\n(3) Navigation software like Google Maps usually has smart correction features that use the trajectory data to determine the position in the absence of GPS data (like in tunnels or deep valleys). Essentially the app tries to fit the trajectory from (2) to the nearest road.\n\n(4) iBeacon is a Bluetooth based technology that helps devices with location in buildings or shops. With a possible range of 50 m or so, an iBeacon may also be detected from the road, although I guess it takes a few seconds to make the connection. So if you reconnect to an iBeacon of some shop you visited before, Google assumes that you are a regular customer there.\n\nI am using a WiFi only tablet. I listed the model number. I have no WiFi connection while driving down the interstate or back roads of TN.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203033\n\nYou don't actually need to have wifi to estimate where you are using wifi, there just has to be available wifi signals. Driving around town there will be a lot of those. Alternatively, if you really are testing in a place that is miles from any possible signal that could be used to locate you, then it's possible you actually have a GPS model that was refurbed or something like that. There are probably apps that can check to see if your device has a GPS.\n\nIf you have the WiFi iPad please test what I am stating.\n\nThe Mac forum might be a better place to ask people to do things with iOS.\n\nGreat info but see if that explains below.\n\nI am between Nashville and Memphis off the interstate 17 miles in an area I have never been. The iPad was 100% OFF from Nashville to this point. No houses or buildings for miles. I turn on the iPad and click Google Maps. It shows my last spot in Nashville where I live. 15 or so seconds it pops to my location and shows the blue dot approx 15’ from where I am standing.\n\nI turn off the iPad. Drive back to Nashville.\n\n3 days later I get an email asking me to review the water department tank I just worked on.\n\nI have never been there with any device in my life.\n\nI only had the iPad and no other mobile devices. No gps in the vehicle (vintage Chevy truck with a carb) I used a paper map and left phone at the house. It was a quiet and enjoyable ride.\n\nI purchased the iPad new from Bestbuy. No refurb Cellular model. Checked all menus and privacy locations.\n\nFollowed 5 or so websites that show how to get deep in settings to verify. I am at the point of who cares. Just thought I had uncovered another google track me alien issue.\n\nI have 2 of the same models and they both are able to get GPS tagged in the same manner. I understand the pass a WiFi and even not connected it will ping the device and gestimate the speed of driving.\n\nBut my experiments of leaving it off and traveling to dead zones makes me scratch the head.\n\nThanks for all that weighed in.\n\nGreat info but see if that explains below.\n\nI am between Nashville and Memphis off the interstate 17 miles in an area I have never been.

Or security system?\n\nDoes any of the equipment at the water tank use a wireless connection? Perhaps some sort of smart meter? Or security system?\n\njust looking at the overall circumstance, it seems like there is almost certainly a water level monitor and a wifi connection to a nearby shed (or helpful neighbor) that has a connection back to the water company's main office. there's just no way that they aren't remotely monitoring water levels in 2018, especially if location services indicates that there is wifi there.\n\ni don't know why the OP is aggro. location services is usually a good thing and if you don't like it, you can turn it off. expecting it to fail sometimes and getting mad when it works anyway is not very zen.\n\nDoes any of the equipment at the water tank use a wireless connection?

And you know, if I went to the top of a mountain in a state park and a device of mine without GPS was able to pinpoint my location I’d be skeeved out a bit too.\n\nI just think the obvious simplest explanation is that even though he doesn’t know it, there are in fact WiFi networks where he’s been. An easy way to test would be to turn off WiFi, turn off the device and then turn it on again in the remote location. Check if Google Maps picks up location. Then turn on WiFi and check again. I very much doubt that it is some conspiracy theory mystery chip."
