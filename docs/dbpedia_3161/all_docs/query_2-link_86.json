        "text": "Easy fluid transfer with the ExactRate™ fluid transfer system\n\nThe ExactRate fluid transfer system pairs planters seamlessly with the ExactRate tractor tanks. It provides an easy connection point to allow transfer from the ExactRate tractor tanks back to the planter tank. This enables up 6056 L (1600 gal.)* of combined capacity between the tractor and planter tanks.\n\nFactory installed\n\nDesigned and tested by John Deere to ensure the lines won’t pinch when folding\n\nEasily attaches to the ExactRate tractor tanks\n\nExactRate is available on the following models: 1775NT, 1795, DB44, DB60, and DB66.\n\n*NOTE: 6056 L (1600 gal.) assumes a 2271-L (600-gal.) tank on a 24-Row 1775NT Planter as well as the 3785-L (1000-gal.) capacity on the 8RX Tractor.\n\nEasily carry fluid on the planter with liquid tanks\n\nJohn Deere factory-installed liquid tanks offer a convenient way to carry fluid on the planter frame. Styling cues match the CCS™ system tanks, and all brackets and mountings are 100 percent factory installed.\n\nFactory installed\n\nUp to 2271 L (600 gal.) of fluid capacity\n\nClear sight tube to check fluid level\n\nAir bleed and overflow protection\n\nIncrease visibility at night with light-emitting diode (LED) lighting package\n\nAs planting windows get tighter, many growers are working longer hours to get the seed in the ground. With the planter LED lighting package, John Deere delivers better visibility when planting a night.\n\nFour additional LED lights\n\nImproves visibility when planting at night\n\nIlluminates row-units when servicing at night\n\nTurns on when tractor lights are engaged\n\nPrecise liquid fertilizer placement with ExactRate™ fertilizer system\n\nThe ExactRate liquid fertilizer system is a factory-installed solution that provides you with accurate nutrient placement during planting. Previously, you would have to deal with the inconvenience of cumbersome aftermarket systems for a hydraulically driven variable-rate solution. With ExactRate, John Deere delivers a complete planting solution for liquid fertilizer users. You can choose between in-furrow or offset delivery methods. A high-rate option without openers is also offered from the factory. This system delivers:\n\nUp to 20 percent more accurate nutrient placement in a turn compared to a non-turn compensating system\n\n1 to 12 percent (4.3 percent on average) reduction in inputs through row-by-row section control\n\nAbility to run up to 16.1 km/h (10 mph)\n\nClosed-loop speed and rate change compensation\n\nFull integration into the 4600 CommandCenter™ and 4640 Universal Display\n\nThe ExactRate liquid fertilizer system is designed to take full advantage of the capabilities of ExactEmerge™ and MaxEmerge™ 5e planters. This factory-installed liquid fertilizer system delivers the same value as your electric drive planter including working at speeds faster than the traditional 8.05 km/h (5 mph), turn compensation, and row-by-row section control, all while accurately compensating for varying rates and speed changes. Additional features include row-by-row flow detection, as-applied documentation, and variable-rate capabilities, providing operators full integration into the 4600 CommandCenter or 4640 Universal Display.\n\nFertilizer flows from the tank to the pump, through a strainer and boom isolation valve, through a central flowmeter, and out to each nozzle body and row-unit for accurate delivery. The system is closed loop, meaning the pump and nozzle body duty cycle both adjust based on feedback received from the pressure sensor and central flowmeter. This design helps maintain an accurate application rate.\n\nNOTE: ExactRate is not recommended for products that require agitation to maintain suspension.\n\nPump\n\nInstead of a tire-contact drive, a hydraulically driven centrifugal pump eliminates chain and sprocket adjustments to provide more speed flexibility over the entire rate range. This pump allows for a wide range of rate capabilities as well as strong durability. The wet seal design helps protect the pump if it is accidentally run dry for a short time.\n\nStrainer\n\nA strainer helps collect suspended particles and prevent them from causing blockages in the distribution system and nozzle bodies.\n\nBoom isolation valve\n\nThe valve prevents the tank from draining out if there is a leak in the distribution system. If the pump is on, the valve opens to allow flow. When the pump is off, the valve closes.\n\nCentral flowmeter and pump pressure sensor\n\nThe central flowmeter and pump pressure sensor provide the rate control system feedback on flow and pressure to ensure an accurate application rate across the entire planter width. The flowmeter also supplies the as-applied rate data.\n\nDirect injection\n\nThe ExactRate liquid fertilizer system does not have direct injection capabilities on the product being applied. If direct injection is needed on the secondary product, an additional rate controller is required.\n\nNOTE: ExactRate system and John Deere Rate Controller 2000 with Raven ICD Direct Injection system is supported. ExactRate system and GreenStar Rate Controller with Raven ISO Direct Injection system is not supported.\n\nDistribution system and nozzle body\n\nThe 2.5-cm (1-in.) stainless-steel distribution lines not only reduce corrosion, but they also provide a clean integrated look. The distribution system is pressure tested at the factory to reduce the risk of leaks.\n\nJohn Deere has leveraged ExactApply™ technology and capabilities from the sprayers to enable row-by-row section control and turn compensation that matches the high-performance planters. With ExactRate, there are no orifice changes for rate or speed adjustments, saving you time and effort while limiting exposure to product. Pulse-width modulation technology varies duty cycle (opening and closing of the valve) in the nozzle bodies in conjunction with flow and pressure measured from central flowmeter and pressure sensor controlling the system pump. The ExactRate liquid fertilizer system uses one nozzle body for two rows, limiting the number of parts and complexity on each machine. While you’re in the cab, you can keep an eye on each row with flow detection integrated into the Gen 4 display. The system warns you if it detects a variance in an individual row’s flow. A pressure sensor integrated into the nozzle body will detect a flow reduction or overapplication on the row.\n\nJust like on the sprayers, the keypad at the rear of the machine lets you conveniently perform a nozzle flow check to ensure product is coming out of each row before going to the field.\n\nRate Controller\n\nThe ExactRate liquid fertilizer system is compatible with the John Deere Rate Controller 2000 and GreenStar™ Rate Controller if a producer wants to apply a second product using a separate distribution system.\n\nExactRate app on Gen 4\n\nEasily adjust target rate and speed without leaving your seat. With turn compensation, inner and outer rates are automatically adjusted to maintain consistent application across the full width of the planter. This ultimately reduces the risk of seed burn by over application (turn compensations require a global positioning system [GPS] receiver). Another helpful feature is row-by-row section control for reduced overlap on headlands and waterways. Gen 4 Documentation creates as-applied maps showing what product was applied where, providing accurate record-keeping.\n\nSeedStar™ 4HP monitoring system – see speed meet accuracy in real time\n\nHave you wanted to view more than one planter chart at once? SeedStar 4HP gives you multiple views and configurations in one simple overview page to fit your preferences. You can complete the simplified setup from the Work Setup page instead of having multiple applications to open.\n\nSeedStar 4HP is designed to optimize the in-cab monitoring experience exclusively on the Gen 4 4600 CommandCenter™ display or 4640 Universal Display for growers with ExactEmerge™ planters and MaxEmerge™ 5e planters. With SeedStar 4HP, operators will easily see key planter information with customizable run pages, zoom functionality, and simultaneous graph and performance measurements. SeedStar 4HP is included in base on all model year 2018 ExactEmerge and MaxEmerge 5e planters.\n\nFeatures overview:\n\nView multiple planters' at-a-glance bar charts simultaneously\n\nThree default planter run pages show key planter functions in easy-to-view layouts\n\nHighly configurable run pages allow SeedStar modules to be customizable\n\nZoom feature allows quick row-by-row detailed information\n\nView dual bar graphs to see multiple planter details at one time\n\nSeedStar application to make adjustments to planter functions\n\nSimplified setup through the work set-up page\n\nAdvanced rates allow up to six different rates across 48 rows\n\nThe SeedStar 4HP monitoring system requires the Gen 4 4600 CommandCenter or 4640 Universal Display. These displays allow the operator to benefit from the updated interface, enhanced processing speeds, and easy setup (learn more here).\n\nSeedStar 3 HP conversion to SeedStar 4HP with mobile row-unit runoff aftermarket for field conversion kits\n\nGrowers who are currently running model year 2017 planters, model year 2017 and newer Precision Upgrades, or model year 2017 and newer custom-built planters with the SeedStar 3 HP monitoring system can upgrade to the SeedStar 4HP monitoring system with mobile row-unit runoff. The attachment part, AA100382, is software only. The Gen 4 display software version will need to be 19-1 or newer and will require planter apps. Follow the mobile runoff ordering and software push guide below for ordering and installation. Retrofitted planters and custom-built planters will also require the John Deere Connect Mobile kit, 0048PC, from the Precision Ag Technology Price Pages and wiring harness AA83662 to enable the mobile row-unit runoff feature. Please reference Parts Advisor and DTAC Solution 105181 for model-specific mounting brackets. SeedStar 4HP requires the Gen 4 4600 CommandCenter v2 display or 4640 Universal Display.\n\nDefault planter run pages\n\nThree default run pages show key planter functions in different views to give fast and easy access to important planter information.\n\nCustom run pages\n\nThere are customizable run pages that allow the operator to build pages that fit their operation with different modules, like the example shown above.\n\nZoom functionality\n\nThe zoom feature allows the operator to touch a section or row of the planter and get detailed information quickly.\n\nDual bar graphs\n\nDual bar graphs allow operators to view multiple planter details at one time.\n\nSeedStar application page\n\nIn the SeedStar application, many adjustments can be made, including manually activating section control. SeedStar 4HP allows up to 48 individual row sections. There are several setup features such as crop, seed disk, number of rows being planted, population alarms, and limits. Seed rates can be modified, electric power generation (EPG) can be turned on or off, vacuum can be adjusted, and the fill and purge functions can be used from the SeedStar application. Frame control, as well as diagnostics and calibrations, can be accessed at the bottom of the screen.\n\nSettings Manager in SeedStar 4HP\n\nReduce set-up time between changing crops or field conditions by recalling saved settings used previously with Settings Manager, included with every SeedStar 4HP system. This feature allows saving and recalling planter and tractor settings for optimum performance in different conditions.\n\nSettings Manager can be used to save all the adjustment and inputs associated to a particular crop or condition. An example would be to store all population rates, downforce pressure, row cleaner adjustments, and closing wheel settings for planting corn and storing a separate, unique set of adjustments for soybeans. In addition, Settings Manager stores tractor settings such as selective control valve (SCV) flow and detents, infinitely variable transmission (IVT™) settings, eco modes, and more.\n\nCustom rates in SeedStar 4HP\n\nCustom rates allow for individual row population control and row-by-row documentation where up to six different rates can be assigned across an up to 48-row planter. This allows growers interested in planting seed corn with ExactEmerge or MaxEmerge 5e the capability to assign specific populations to male and female rows for planting. This feature can also be used to create tram lines or other applications where custom rates by row are needed.\n\nNOTE: Individual rates are tied to varieties, so each individual rate needs a unique variety name.\n\nNOTE: Advanced rates are not compatible with prescriptions or they cannot be run at the same time.\n\nCompatibility\n\nSeedStar 4HP compatibility Planters\n\nAll models ordered with ExactEmerge or MaxEmerge 5e row-units\n\nNOTE: Precision Upgrades are equipped with SeedStar 3HP only but can be upgraded by purchasing part number AA100382.\n\nDisplays\n\nGen 4 4600 CommandCenter equipped with Version 2 Processor or 4640 Universal Display\n\nDual-display mode is compatible with mid model year 2019 planter software.\n\nJohn Deere Active Implement Guidance™ Compatible with SeedStar 4HP on Gen 4 displays with VT mode and required activations and subscriptions AutoTrac™ Implement Guidance SeedStar 4HP is compatible with AutoTrac Turn Automation and AutoTrac Implement Guidance; not compatible with electric drive planters larger than 48 rows. AutoTrac Turn Automation SeedStar 4HP is compatible with AutoTrac Turn Automation and AutoTrac Implement Guidance; not compatible with electric drive planters larger than 48 rows.\n\nAdditional information\n\nFor additional information on feature functionality on the Gen 4 Display, visit the links below:\n\nIndividual Row Hydraulic Downforce (IRHD)\n\nEasy Adjust row cleaners\n\nYouTube is a trademark of Google LLC.\n\nMobile row-unit runoff\n\nThe first day of planting season can be as productive as the last with mobile row-unit runoff. The mobile row-unit runoff activation on the planter main controller (PMC) allows operators to make adjustments to maximize row-unit performance from a mobile device at the rear of the planter for both preseason and in-season use - all enabled through the Equipment Mobile app.\n\nMobile row-unit runoff allows growers to perform test-stand functions from a mobile device connected to the planter.\n\nThe row runoff test provides complete diagnostic checks both preseason and in season. With the row-unit runoff test, the operator can make adjustments from the mobile device, including vacuum pressure, to determine the optimum meter and vacuum settings. This app functionality will help avoid making trips to the cab while validating meter performance.\n\nDuring preseason planter inspections and set up, utilize the meter performance test to validate meter accuracy, similar to a test stand without leaving the farm. Test all systems on the planter, not just the meter, providing confidence that all planter systems are ready to plant. Reports are generated from the test providing information the operator can save and send for future reference.\n\nBefore heading to the field, the operator will benefit from knowing the best row-unit and vacuum settings for each variety selected to plant that spring.\n\nWatch this video to see mobile row-unit runoff in action.\n\nMobile row-unit runoff will work with any model year 2015 or newer ExactEmerge™ or MaxEmerge™ 5e equipped planter. Mobile row-unit runoff can be added with attachment AA93169.\n\nFor model year 2018 and newer ExactEmerge planters, mobile row-unit runoff is included in base equipment. For model year 2020 and newer MaxEmerge 5e planters, mobile row-unit runoff is included in base equipment. For planters not equipped from the factory, mobile row-unit runoff can be added with attachment AA93169. A mobile row-unit runoff and Easy Fold package can be added with attachment AA97849 (only available with 1775NT and 1795 Planters with a 2-point hitch and model year 2019 and newer DB Planters with Gen 4 based frame folding).\n\nNOTE: Mobile runoff utilizes the Equipment Mobile app available on select iPad® tablets, iPhone® smartphones, and Android™ devices.\n\nMobile row-unit runoff and Easy Fold aftermarket for field conversion kits\n\nThe below software bundles include the functionality explained above for machines not ordered with the feature from the factory. Compatible machines include all the necessary sensors and harnesses needed to make the feature function. The attachment part is software only. Follow the mobile runoff ordering and software push guide below for ordering and installation.\n\nSeedStar™ 3 HP conversion to SeedStar 4HP\n\nMobile runoff ordering and software push guide\n\niPad and iPhone are trademarks of Apple Inc. Android is a trademark of Google LLC.\n\nDownforce system options\n\nIndividual Row Hydraulic Downforce (IRHD)\n\nIRHD has been specifically designed to meet the needs of producers that are looking to adjust to the toughest field conditions and provide maximum yield potential from field to field, season after season. IRHD works as a closed-loop downforce system that reacts quickly on an individual row basis to changing soil conditions supporting increased ground contact, which can lead to improved seed depth consistency. When setting planter downforce margin, the system will apply the needed downforce by row to maintain ground contact. From the factory, the margin will be set at 45.4 kg (100 lb), changes may be required based on varying field conditions.\n\nThe system allows operators to maintain gauge wheel ground contact leading to desired seed depth placement. IRHD can adjust five times per second and make adjustments of 45.4 kg (100 lb) in less than a second. The system has a total range of applied downforce from 22.7 kg (50 lb) to 204.1 kg (450 lb) and utilizes the power beyond circuit on the tractor. IRHD is 58 percent faster than the active pneumatic downforce solution. Fast reaction and increased ground contact can lead to improved emergence. With uniform emergence, some studies have shown a yield impact from 5 percent to 9 percent.\n\nIRHD is controlled through the display with SeedStar™ 3 HP or SeedStar 4HP. As shown below, operators can view ground contact or applied downforce using the toggle button.\n\nHydraulically driven compressor\n\nThe hydraulically driven air compressor can deliver up to eight times the air flow when compared to the electric compressor, allowing for more and faster downforce changes to be made. This more robust design features a 37.8-L (10-gal.) storage tank across all models with active downforce.\n\nAt approximately 15.1 L/min (4 gpm), hydraulic demands are low and ties into the machine’s lift and Central Commodity System (CCS™) hydraulic circuit so it does not require any additional selective control valves (SCVs). The SeedStar XP, SeedStar 3 HP, and SeedStar 4 HP monitoring systems work with the compressor. SeedStar 3 HP and SeedStar 4 HP monitoring systems work with the compressor and valve assembly to regulate air to downforce springs, enabling the active control, pneumatic closing wheels, and pneumatic row cleaners.\n\nRow-unit downforce planter run page\n\nActive downforce control is integrated into SeedStar XP, SeedStar 3 HP, and SeedStar 4 HP monitoring systems.\n\nMargin is the amount of weight riding on the depth gauge wheels that ensures desired firming of the seedbed as set by the operator.\n\nOnce a target margin has been defined, enter the value into the display and let active downforce do the rest. The system will actively adjust the air pressure in the air bags to maintain a constant margin across the planter. The changes in air pressure will change the amount of downforce placed on the row-unit, compensating and reacting for varying conditions through the field whether it is different tillage practices, soil types, or moisture.\n\nA - Margin – amount of additional downforce applied to a row-unit above and beyond what is required for penetration to achieve planting depth. This additional weight will ride on the depth gauge wheels.\n\n54.4 kg (120 lb) + 36.3 kg (80 lb) = 90.7 kg (200 lb) – 68 kg (150 lb) = 22.7 kg (50 lb) of margin\n\nB - Weight of row-unit - 54.4 kg (120 lb)\n\nC - Downforce – force that is applied to the row-unit by the air bag circuit - 36.3 kg (80 lb)\n\nD - Resistance from soil - 68 kg (150 lb)\n\nMargin video references:\n\nUnderstanding Margin\n\nUsing Set Point downforce\n\nUsing Active Pneumatic downforce\n\nSeedStar 4HP: Downforce\n\nEach row-unit has a single rubber air bag located between the parallel arms. The air bags are hooked in parallel so that air can be added or released from all rows at once from one location.\n\nThe individual pneumatic downforce air bag assemblies, air compressor units, and 9.5-mm (3/8-in.) delivery lines are also available as an attachment for field conversion.\n\nA hydraulically driven compressor works with the SeedStar XP, SeedStar 3 HP, and SeedStar 4 systems to automate downforce control. Just set the row-unit target margin value and the active pneumatic downforce system works automatically. The system will make sure the planter maintains this value, achieving precise soil penetration, and consistent planting depth, without sidewall soil compaction. From the factory, the system is set at 45.4 kg (100 lb) target downforce margin but may be modified for varying field conditions. This frees the operator from constantly making manual downforce adjustments as conditions change.\n\nThis system offers a split-rank control feature for 1795 and DB Split-Row Planters. On split-row planters, active downforce will control the front and rear rows independently. This compensates for differing downforce requirements between the ranks that can be caused by things like different tillage or insecticide attachments and will help maintain an accurate planting depth and consistent margin across all the rows.\n\nActive pneumatic downforce is available as factory installed or as an attachment for field conversion.\n\nSet point row-unit downforce\n\nOn set point, the air compressor will be mounted on the outer hitch or frame assembly. Since the electric air compressor assembly is mounted on the outer hitch (as noted in the picture above) or frame, adjustments for row-unit downforce and related system pressures will be made electronically with the GreenStar display.\n\nWhen adjusting the amount of row-unit downforce using the GreenStar display, the operator will select the amount of downforce (kg [lb]) to be applied across the planter. Depending on the soil conditions at hand, the operator might need to adjust the relative amount of row-unit downforce being applied during the planting operation. The integrated pneumatic downforce controls within the GreenStar display will only allow for set-point operation and not automatic control as the planter is operating in different soil conditions. The pneumatic downforce system does not have the capability to automatically adjust downforce.\n\nPneumatic downforce provides convenient, simple adjustment of downforce for the whole planter from one location. The amount of downforce applied is infinitely adjustable from 6.8 to 181.4 kg (15 to 400 lb). Pneumatic downforce provides more consistent downforce throughout the range of row-unit travel than mechanical spring downforce systems.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n9.5-mm (3/8-in.) air delivery line instead of the 6.4-mm (1/4-in.) line used on model year 2010 and older planters.\n\nAir compressor assembly increased duty cycle. With this compressor, it provides a 47 percent increase in maximum air flow delivery compared to the prior air compressor.\n\nPneumatic air bags with 9.5-mm (3/8-in.) air line inlets that have greater durability.\n\nAn improved compressor is used to charge the pneumatic system. This compressor can be located on the planter frame or in the tractor cab if desired. A gauge at the compressor indicates the amount of downforce being applied.\n\nIntegrated pneumatic downforce system\n\nThe functional features of the integrated system are the same as the standard pneumatic system, explained above, with the addition of control through the GreenStar display.\n\nHeavy-duty adjustable downforce springs\n\nPlanter row-unit downforce is an important factor to ensure consistent and proper depth control. The heavy-duty adjustable downforce feature provides up to 181.4 kg (400 lb) of downforce. There are four settings available to allow the operator to choose the amount of downforce required for the condition: 0 kg (0 lb), 56.7 kg (125 lb), 113.4 kg (250 lb), and 181.4 kg (400 lb).\n\nEasy Adjust row cleaners\n\nEasy Adjust row cleaner and coulter combo provides a pneumatic row tillage solution that is controlled from the seat of the tractor.\n\nEvery decision to make an adjustment during spring planting reduces the acres planted per day and can increase or decrease profitability. An adjustment that can be overlooked is row cleaners due to planter size, difficulty to make the adjustment, and varying conditions across fields and time.\n\nWith the Easy Adjust row cleaners on ExactEmerge™ planters, operators now have a pneumatic solution to make on-the-go adjustments that is controlled directly from the seat of the cab. They can be raised from the cab as needed with the push of a button for wet areas, waterways, or end rows. For growers using SeedStar 3 HP, the row cleaners are completely integrated into the John Deere GreenStar 3 2630 Display as well as the Gen 4 4600 CommandCenter display or 4640 Universal Display. For growers using SeedStar 4HP, a 4600 CommandCenter display or 4640 Universal Display is required.\n\nThe Easy Adjust row cleaners have the capability to save three presets for varying ground engagement based on field conditions. The system is controlled in three sections: at each wing as well as the center (frame or wheel) track rows. The pneumatic lines use air from the active pneumatic downforce compressor, requiring no additional compressor to be installed on the planter. The Easy Adjust row cleaners utilize down and up force air bags. The adjustable air pressure setting for each bag allows the operator to set the ride of the row cleaner depending on the field conditions and the desired results. Making these on-the-go adjustments from tractor cab increases productivity and performance during planting.\n\nFor Easy Adjust row cleaner Precision Upgrade options, see the ordering guide.\n\nThe row cleaner-only option utilizes parallel linkage to provide the floating action growers require in their fields. Parallel linkage allows for the unit to float up and down in the situation of hills or hard objects. The cleaner and coulter combo does not have parallel linkage, however, the row cleaners have floating rings installed to help provide the same benefits.\n\nThe row cleaners utilize the field-proven SharkTooth® design. Row cleaners play a major role in maximizing yield toward uniform emergence, reducing row-unit bounce, and maintaining proper depth. The Easy Adjust row cleaners provide growers with quick and stress-free solutions to customizing the planter in variable field conditions. They are available on most ExactEmerge and MaxEmerge 5e equipped planters.\n\nSharkTooth is a trademark of Yetter Manufacturing Incorporated.\n\nAchieve accuracy with curve compensation\n\nTerraces or waterways are two of many field obstacles that make planting on a curve challenging. When planters utilize drive shafts, they are not able to control each individual row-unit; as a result, planting on a curve presents an issue of maintaining 100 percent population. Since the inside rows are moving slower than the outside rows, the inside rows will be overpopulated while the outside rows are underpopulated.\n\nWith ExactEmerge™ planters and equipped MaxEmerge™ 5e planters, the curve compensation feature allows each row to receive an individual signal based on the speed at which the row-unit is moving, maintaining the correct population across the width of the planter. Without curve compensation, there could be as much as a 24 percent drop in population accuracy, which is equivalent to 8,600 seeds per acre when planting at 36,000 seeds per acre. Curve compensation measures acceleration within the main planter controller and utilizes speed inputs to ensure each row has the desired population accuracy.\n\nRow cleaner options to meet residue management needs\n\nCrop yields have increased through the years along with the amount of residue left in the field after harvest. At the same time, tillage practices have changed, including different tillage operations which maintain large amounts of surface residue, and even no-till practices. Row cleaners are an essential tool in managing this increased amount of residue.\n\nJohn Deere seeding group offers a variety of row cleaner options to meet the needs of a producer's operation. Compatibility varies by model, row spacing, and other planter equipment.\n\nScrew-adjust, unit-mounted row cleaner\n\nThe screw-adjust, unit-mounted row cleaner is mounted directly to the face plate of the row-unit, placing the ground engaging components just in front of the row-unit opener blades and depth gauge wheels. This close proximity allows the gauge wheels to control the depth of the row cleaner as well as the row-unit. This compact design also allows greater compatibility with fertilizer openers and other planter attachments.\n\nSharkTooth® wheels are standard equipment on the unit-mounted row cleaner. The swept-tooth design of the wheel provides a clear path for the row-unit openers while resisting residue buildup on the wheel. The screw adjustment knob is accessible through the top of the parallel arms, providing convenient access for adjustments. The row cleaner can be adjusted in 1.6-mm (1/16-in.) increments, providing plenty of flexibility to meet the needs of changing conditions.\n\nFloating row cleaner with unit-mounted coulter\n\nThe floating row cleaner allows a row cleaner to be used in conjunction with a unit-mounted coulter. This combination is often desired in heavy residue loads and reduced tillage planting conditions. The row cleaner provides a clear path for the row-unit, while the unit-mounted coulter helps penetrate tough soil conditions.\n\nAccommodating the unit-mounted coulter means the residue wheels are farther forward from the row-unit face plate than in the case of the screw-adjust row cleaner. To maintain performance, this row cleaner has the capability to float above a defined minimum depth.\n\nStandard depth-gauging bands on the wheels allow the row cleaner wheels to float independently of the row-unit openers, allowing both to perform in varying terrain. The unit may also be set in a fixed position by simply pinning through the bracket if desired. This row cleaner also features SharkTooth wheels as standard equipment.\n\nThe floating row cleaner and unit-mounted coulters are available on many planters as factory-installed equipment.\n\nNOTE: Screw-adjust row cleaners are not compatible with MaxEmerge™ 5e row-units with long parallel arms.\n\nNOTE: DB models have the option for either unit-mounted coulter, screw-adjust row cleaners, or pneumatic row cleaners (only compatible with MaxEmerge 5e or equipped ExactEmerge™ models). The DB60T is only available with a less row cleaner option.\n\nSharkTooth is a trademark of Yetter Manufacturing, Inc.\n\nFrame weight distribution\n\nAs planters get larger and more customizable, there is more weight being carried by the center mainframe. This presents the possibility that weight may not be distributed evenly along the width of the planter frame during planting in certain circumstances. Some studies have shown there could be a potential yield loss of 70.5 L (2 bu) per acre in certain soil conditions from unequal weight distribution with more weight being on the center of the planter. The option has been added to have hydraulic cylinders mounted onto the frame of the planter that redistribute weight from the center of the planter to the rest of the tool bar.\n\nThe frame weight distribution can be enabled or disabled on the Gen 4 4600 CommandCenter™ Display or 4640 Universal Display with SeedStar™ 4HP on MaxEmerge™ 5e or ExactEmerge™ equipped planters. MaxEmerge 5 equipped planters utilize an on/off switch by the valve block to enable and disable the system.\n\nThe system utilizes the tractor’s power beyond feature with load sense. Frame weight distribution is activated by the height switch, providing equal weight distribution at all times. In the scenario where a planter is equipped with frame weight distribution and onboard power generation for electric drives, there will be an orifice that directs hydraulic flow to fulfill the power generation requirement first and then provide oil to frame weight distribution.\n\nFrame weight distribution is manually adjusted from a valve block below the CCS tank. The system does not have active adjustment capabilities. When the planter is raised on headland turns, the system maintains pressure to the outside wings for a period of time to keep the system engaged to make the turn and reduce center frame tire weight on headlands.\n\nUnlike the three-section frame models, the DB90 54Row20 has five-section frame weight distribution. This means the inner wings and outer wings are adjusted independently. Five-section frame weight distribution is still manually adjusted from two separate valve blocks under the CCS tank; one controls the inner wing down pressure and the other controls the outer wing down pressure.\n\nAvailable on the following models:1775NT 24Row30, DB66 36Row22, DB90 54Row20, and all DB60Planters."
