        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nBecause of a business requirement, we need to know if the current device has GPS or not so, I have been researching this without any success. We could say that all of the iPhones have a built-in GPS, so this all comes down to the iPads.\n\nI wanted to try to confirm here: Do you know if there is any public API that says if an iOS device has GPS or not?\n\nOn the other hand, only the Wifi + Cellular iPads have GPS, the WiFi-Only iPads don't have this. Therefore, we could say something like \"If the device has cellular technology, then it has a GPS\".\n\nI found this answer in SO which shows how to accomplish the cellular detection: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7101206/know-if-ios-device-has-cellular-data-capabilities/14507324#14507324\n\nWe have been able to test this out on 3 iPads: two WiFi + Cellular models, and the other one a WiFi-Only iPad. The result looks good.\n\nI wanted to ask:\n\nIs this the right way to detect cellular technology? (I do not seem to find detailed information about the \"pdp_ip0\" interface)\n\nis this a safe way to detect if an iPad has GPS or not?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nI can’t answer your main question but I want to address two points. First up, this:\n\nIs this the right way to detect cellular technology?\n\nNo. The WWAN interface name (pdp_ipX) is not considered API.\n\nMy general advice for getting info about the state of cellular is to use Core Telephony. I don’t have an iPad with cellular to test this on at the moment, but I’m pretty sure that’ll work on iPad as well as iPhone.\n\nSecond, this:\n\nTherefore, we could say something like \"If the device has cellular technology, then it has a GPS\".\n\nwould be a mistake. While it might be true today, it’s easy to imagine Apple adding GPS to a device that doesn’t have cellular.\n\nAs to your main question, how to detect whether a device is GPS-capable, I’m not aware of any good solution to that, but it’s possible that someone with more experience with location will chime in (my relevant experience here is with networking).\n\nShare and Enjoy\n\n—\n\nQuinn “The Eskimo!” @ Developer Technical Support @ Apple\n\nlet myEmail = \"eskimo\" + \"1\" + \"@\" + \"apple.com\""
