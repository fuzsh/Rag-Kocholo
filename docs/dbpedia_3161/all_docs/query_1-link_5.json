        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nWhat do you recommend to buy: an ipad air 2 or mini 4? They have built-in barometers. I'm not really familiar with Apple stuff. Is it possible to connect my 128Gb MicroSD card to an ipad via some kind of adapter and still have the usb port to charge it?\n\nI'm going to get one off ebay. What do I need to check?\n\nThanks!\n\nMy iPad minis have excellent GPS. I assume the newer models do as well. I have a Garmin external GPS and haven't needed it for years.\n\nNo USB ports on iPads. They use Lightning plugs. You can buy compatible memory sticks but you can't charge and use a plug-in at the same time.There are bluetooth memory expanders. I have one but never bonded with it.\n\niPad mini 4 is what I just bought. It's a nice size for the cockpit, especially on the yoke.\n\nright now they are on sale at best buy for $299 for the 128Gb\n\nQuite a step up from my iPad 2 (slow)\n\nI use an external GPS.\n\nI do have to say though, this looks a bit like a trolling post.\n\niPad mini 4 is what I just bought.

I can only guess they have similar gps chips.\n\nI have a mini 4 cell (only the cell ones have the additional GPS chip for whatever cheap Apple reason) and before that the mini 2 or 3, no external stuff and not even a need to charge in the middle of a flight, the battery will last longer than your tanks or probably how long you'll want to sit in the plane, just turn the screen off when you're not using it\n\nSpeed wise I didn't see much of a difference since I didn't \"update\" my older mini with the new iOS bloat ware, wouldn't have even upgraded if I hadent have gotten the new one for free through work.\n\nFrom bush flying to the flight levels, been very happy with them on my lap.\n\niPads without cellular capability don't have GPSs do they? I sold my iPad and went to a Samsung tablet after spending hours trying to get my iPad working with FltPlan Go.\n\nYes they do! Look on the Apple store, they have glonass/ gnss. Mine is not set up thru any wireless provider and works great. Cellular gps relies on the cell system for location, which is fine if you never leave the ground...\n\nYes they do! Look on the Apple store, they have glonass/ gnss. Mine is not set up thru any wireless provider and works great. Cellular gps relies on the cell system for location, which is fine if you never leave the ground...\n\nI think you misunderstand.\n\nA WIFI only iPAD has no GPS of any sort. A cellular capable iPad has GPS and it doesn't need the cell service activated in order for it to work. There's no such thing as \"cellular gps.\" Some cell systems use cell data for position location (for E911 location requirements) but the iOS doesn't expose this to apps to my knowledge. The iPAD will use the cellular radio for some ancillary help to boot up the GPS position if it is turned on, however.\n\nGlonass support was added to the cellular capable iPads starting with the 3rd generation full size iPad as well as all of the cellular capable minis.\n\nYes, I stand corrected. Still, you don’t need to be on a cellular network to get gps (this I am sure of).\n\nMaybe not apple, but there are cellphones which do not use real gnss to give your location, they rely on the cell network.\n\nCorrect, as I stated, you don't need the cell data turned on to get the GPS to work in the iPad, but it helps. However, as I stated in my very first statement, the cellular and GPS are on the same chip.\n\nSome cell phones do (as I stated) use the cell network triangulation for 911 location reporting. This is not however \"GPS\" or \"GNSS\" or in fact, GLOBAL in any way. Anyhow, I think it's largely gone by the wayside. Even ATT in the US who was the biggest proponent on it has moved along.\n\nSome cell phones do (as I stated) use the cell network triangulation for 911 location reporting.

Even ATT in the US who was the biggest proponent on it has moved along.\n\nAll cell networks are required to do it. The carriers have “moved on” only from marketing it as a cellular carrier feature, or trying to sell their proprietary GPS apps and voice direction things since any App can ask wither iOS or Android for whatever location the device thinks it’s currently located at.\n\nBut the E911 tracking and what not (and tracking of any device with an appropriate — however ridiculously easy to get they are — court order, is still alive and very well in the networks.\n\nMost carriers tell the devices to send any more accurate location data the device has that they don’t, back to the carrier nearly continuously anyway, citing that it’ll make “network management” better, when really all they want to do is sell tailored advertising with it.\n\nIf it’s on, it’s being tracked. The cell site controllers use it for MIMO and power level stuff besides all the other sketchy uses for it.\n\nIs there any reason to get cellular service added to the ipad if it has a cellular/gps chip already, and you have a Stratus? Asking for a friend (me)..\n\nOnly reason I could think of is if you want to update charts etc. when not able to use WiFi. GPS, Weather etc. will come through the Stratus\n\nIs there any reason to get cellular service added to the ipad if it has a cellular/gps chip already, and you have a Stratus? Asking for a friend (me)..\n\nI assume you’re saying your Stratus has GPS. No iPad without cellular does.\n\nThe question for aviation use is always whether or not you want it to be self contained and useful if the other gadget dies."
