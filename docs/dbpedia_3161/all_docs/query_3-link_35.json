        "text": "Everything You Need To Know About How GPS Tracking Works\n\nGPS technology has evolved significantly since its creation in 1973. Today, users benefit from 32 dedicated satellites that orbit Earth. These satellites send signals to receivers and base stations on the planet’s surface. That’s how global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) function. But how GPS tracking works is a little bit different. In fact, it requires more sophisticated digital technology, either built into GPS tracking systems or accessible through mobile applications. In this article, we are going to go over some of the things you need to know about a GPS device tracks the location of an asset or vehicle and breakdown the process of how GPS tracking works!\n\nHow a GPS Tracking System Does Its Job\n\nAt the most basic level, GPS works by:\n\nSatellites send signals to the Earth’s surface.\n\nGround stations receive signals and send the information to a master control station.\n\nMaster control stations determine whether satellites need repositioning, and they send repositioning instructions to ground-based antennae.\n\nAntennae send instructions to satellites to maintain accuracy.\n\nReceivers use satellite signals to calculate three-dimensional locations.\n\nGPS tracking systems must do more than identify a device’s location. They must continuously follow the device to show current and historical location data.\n\nBasic GPS chips found in cell phones, smartphones, and stand-alone GPS trackers can use trilateration to calculate precise locations. Tracking an item, however, typically requires sophisticated software. Your device might ping its location to the software on a pre-set schedule. The software uses that information to create a real-time path that shows the device’s movements.\n\nCellular and GPS data can work together to create a more insightful, accurate map. Even if you lose your cellular connection, the GPS device can send data to the software when it reconnects.\n\nGPS Trilateration\n\nGPS receivers use trilateration to determine their locations. It’s a pretty simple concept, but it takes amazing precision to execute in the real world.\n\nTrilateration uses speed and time to determine distance:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\n\nGPS uses radio signals that travel at 299,792.458 kilometers per second. Time equals the amount of time it takes for the signal to travel from the orbiting satellite to the receiver. Let’s say it takes .00836090 seconds for the signal to travel from the satellite to the receiver.\n\nWith that information, you will find that the distance between the satellite and the receiver equals 2506.5347620922002534 kilometers.\n\nReceivers perform this calculation four times, each using a different satellite’s signal.\n\nThe results create a graph of lines that all intersect in one place. That’s the receiver’s location.\n\nThe U.S. Space Force’s GPS website has a trilateration exercise that uses colored strings. Visit the site to try the exercise.\n\nTrilateration and GPS Tracking\n\nGPS tracking involves a lot more computing power than calculating a single location. GPS devices with tracking features must perform these calculations constantly. This process essentially creates a series of locations. When you connect those dots, you get a line that shows the GPS tracker’s location.\n\nWhat Is a GPS Satellite – The Space Segment\n\nGPS satellites transmit radio waves to the Earth’s surface. Each satellite has a unique signal that tells ground stations and receivers where it is located and when the signal was sent. These signals are used by trilateration to calculate locations on the surface.\n\nSince the program started in 1973, the U.S. government has successfully launched 76 GPS satellites into orbit. However, only 32 of those satellites are still operating and orbiting the planet. The Department of Defense plans to launch 22 more satellites soon, but it hasn’t released a timeline for when those launches will occur.\n\nWhat Do GPS Satellites Transmit?\n\nGPS satellites transmit encoded radio signals that include several pieces of information for civilian (L2C) and military (M-Code) use. The signals also contain information that helps GPS ground stations reposition satellites for improved improved accuracy.\n\nSome of the most important data packets transmitted by GPS satellites include:\n\nAn alert that tells ground stations and receivers not to trust a satellite’s information, making it possible for ground stations to detect operational issues and disregard the satellite’s data packets within 12 seconds of a malfunction.\n\nRedundant location information to help ensure accuracy at the local level.\n\nThe current time (each satellite contains several atomic clocks to ensure accuracy).\n\nNot much information has been released about the military signals, but they have looser parameters that let the military transmit data packages containing practically any information users want to include.\n\nThe GPS Satellite Blocks\n\nGPS satellites are grouped into “blocks” that represent improvements in technology.\n\nBlock I (1978 – 1985)\n\nBetween 1978 and 1985, 11 satellites manufactured by Rockwell International were launched. Only one failed.\n\nThe Block I satellites were intended to test GPS concepts and functionalities.\n\nNone of the Block I satellites currently participate in GPS, but they were critical to building the modern system.\n\nBlock II (1989 – 1990)\n\nNine satellites manufactured by Rockwell International were successfully put into orbit between 1989 and 1990.\n\nIn addition to systems essential for global positioning, the satellites carried sensors that could detect nuclear detonations.\n\nNone of the Block II satellites currently contribute to GPS.\n\nThe satellites were expected to have 7.5-year lifespans, but one of them was still operational in 2007 when the Department of Defense retired it from service.\n\nBlock IIA (1990 – 1997)\n\nNineteen satellites were successfully launched and put into orbit between 1990 and 1997.\n\nThe satellites in Block IIA could operate for 180 days without assistance from ground stations. The previous block’s satellites could only last 14 days.\n\nNone of the Block IIA satellites play roles in the current GPS system.\n\nBlock IIR (1997 – 2004)\n\nThe Block IIR satellites were replacements developed by Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe first launch failed when a rocket exploded 12 seconds after launch.\n\nThe 12 successful launches still orbit the planet, and seven participate in modern GPS.\n\nBlock IIR-M (2005 – 2009)\n\nBlock IIR-M is a group of eight satellites manufactured by Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe Block IIR-M series satellites added military signals and a civilian L2C signal (1227.6MHz) to the system.\n\nAll but one of the satellites are healthy and in orbit.\n\nBlock IIF (2010 – 2016)\n\nBlock IIF consists of 12 satellites manufactured by Boeing.\n\nThese satellites were intended to help the system transition from the original NAVSTAR models to Block III technology.\n\nAll 12 Block IIF satellites are healthy and orbiting the planet.\n\nBlock IIIA (2018 – )\n\nBlock IIIA satellites play a greater role in civilian use than in previous generations.\n\nThe Block IIIA satellites use two civilian signals to eliminate ionospheric delays that can disrupt location accuracy.\n\nThe satellites also use a new military signal (M-code) that improves security and resists jamming.\n\nThe first Block IIIA satellite was launched in 2018. So far, six satellites have been put into orbit. Four more launches are planned between June 2024 and the end of 2026.\n\nBlock IIIF (2027 – 2034)\n\nThe United States Air Force plans to start launching Block IIIF satellites manufactured by Lockheed Martin in 2027.\n\nThe plan currently includes 22 satellites that should be in orbit by 2034. The first two satellites are in production.\n\nWhat Is a GPS Ground Station – The Control Segment\n\nSatellites play a pivotal role in GPS technologies, but you can’t begin to discuss how GPS tracking works without also mentioning the control segment. The GPS control segment consists of ground-based stations and antennas that communicate with and make adjustments to satellites. The ground-based system currently includes:\n\nA master control station (MCS) located at Schriever Space Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colorado\n\nAn alternative MCS located at Vandenberg Air Force Base near Santa Barbara, California\n\nFour dedicated ground antennas are located at Cape Canaveral, Florida; Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory; Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands; Ascension Island near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge\n\nSix dedicated monitor stations located in England, Argentina, Ecuador, Bahrain, Australia, and Washington, DC\n\nThe monitor stations track GPS satellites and receive signals to collect data about them. The data is transmitted to the master control station, which coordinates information from the monitor stations, accuracy tests, and generates navigation instructions to optimize the satellite constellation. The master control station then sends its commands to a ground antenna that communicates instructions to the satellites.\n\nWhat Is a GPS Receiver – The User Segment\n\nNow that we understand how satellites and ground stations play a role in how GPS tracking works, let’s explore the final piece of the puzzle: GPS receivers. The user segment includes a broad range of GPS receivers, including military, scientific, and civilian devices. These devices contain chips designed to receive signals from GPS satellites. If the chip can access information from at least four satellites, it can calculate its location.\n\nThe accuracy of GPS receivers varies depending on their technology. For example, a smartphone might only give you accuracy within 5 meters. A high-end receiver used in scientific research and military operations could provide sub-millimeter accuracy.\n\nCivilians and businesses often use GPS receivers to:\n\nManage commercial vehicle fleets\n\nTrack packages\n\nManage vehicle dealership inventories\n\nProtect loved ones, especially children and the elderly, who might get lost\n\nGet efficient driving directions\n\nProtect assets from theft\n\nHow Businesses Use GPS Asset Tracking\n\nAsset tracking has become essential to many businesses. Many use GPS to:\n\nSee the current locations of expensive assets\n\nTrack company vehicles and monitor driving habits\n\nReceive notifications when assets move\n\nMonitor vehicles to make fleet management more effective and efficient\n\nFamilies and Individuals Use GPS Tracking Devices Too\n\nThe U.S. government gave civilians access to the global positioning system in the 1980s. Since then, people have found countless ways to benefit from the technology. Individuals and families often use GPS receivers to:\n\nTrack the locations of loved ones, especially children and older adults\n\nMonitor teen driver behavior\n\nView vehicle locations to prevent theft and experience peace of mind\n\nPrevent thieves from stealing high-value items\n\nImprove safety while hiking, camping, and traveling\n\nFAQ\n\nHow accurate are GPS trackers?\n\nAnywhere from 5 meters to less than a millimeter! GPS units rely on a network of satellites that orbit the planet twice daily. Your GPS tracker works best when it has a line of sight to at least four satellites. Unfortunately, tall buildings, thick clouds, and other obstructions can degrade accuracy. Also, devices that use multiple signal types can often overcome the challenges created by barriers. Therefore, we would encourage you to look for units that can connect to cellular networks (4GLTE) and GPS satellites (GNSS).\n\nWant to learn more about the accuracy of GPS navigation system or asset tracking device? Then check out this article: https://landairsea.com/blog/how-accurate-are-gps-unit-coordinates-really/\n\nIs it legal to track someone’s vehicle?\n\nGPS tracking laws vary from state to state. Most states allow owners to track their vehicles, though you might need consent from the driver. If you want to learn more about the specific laws in each state, check out this article. However, if you want the most relevant information regarding GPS laws then we would encourage you to contact an attorney in your area of intended use before using a vehicle or asset tracker.\n\nDo smartphones work as well as stand-alone GPS trackers?\n\nNo, smartphones are not designed to act as a stand-along tracking solution. Why? They do not use satellite tracking technology, but rather cellular triangulation. Basically, this means cell towers are aiding in locational information, not true GPS technology. This makes smartphones less accurate and less reliable for applications related to fleet tracking, or in personal safety situations like medical alerts."
