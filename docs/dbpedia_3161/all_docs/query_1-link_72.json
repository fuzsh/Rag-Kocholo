        "text": "The conclusion to one of the articles I am reading: Air, Mini and iPad, fyi:\n\nWe really like the $329 iPad for its functionality and value, but the iPad Mini is our choice for premium tablets (as long as you don't need to use Apple's Smart Keyboard). For just $70 more you step up two generations in hardware, which means much better performance than you'll get on the iPad. You'll have a smaller screen, sure, but like smartphones and phablets, the choice between big and small tablets boils down to taste more than anything else; it's 7.9 inches to 10.2 inches. The iPad Air is also excellent, offering the same performance as the Mini in a larger form factor for $170 more than the regular iPad, with an even bigger screen (10.5 inches).\n\nIf you just want an Apple tablet for entertainment and personal use, and size doesn't matter, go with the iPad mini. It's the best of all worlds in the smallest, sleekest package. If you want to save money and don't mind the dip in power, the new iPad is still an excellent value, while the iPad Air offers the best performance you'll get in a full-size iPad without spending $1,000 on an iPad Pro. Of course, if you want to get serious work done, the iPad Pro remains your best bet.\n\nI have an older version mini on the boat. It's my primary nav tool. I used ram mounts and a lifeproof ipad mounting bracket for installation. (not nuud or fre) I have a USB port in the dash as battery life is a bit short. It stays on the boat.\n\nI have a bad elf but never needed it. Only problem I have noticed is it shuts down if it overheats in bright sun if I use it on the bridge.\n\nI also keep pdf's of all manuals on it. There are no other apps installed so speed is not an issue. I have the latest model mini for personal use such as reading. And then there is my iphone loaded with every known boating app. Weather apps are used the most.\n\nLots to digest, and thanks all for a very educational and learning experience. My immediate take away is larger screen size is better. An extra $100 or so in the long run not a big deal to have a unit I can rely on and learn to use, so cost is certainly a consideration but do not have the mileage to redeem a new iPad Pro, which is not even necessary.\n\nAn Air would probably be the right fit, or someone with an older iPad Pro which has cellular and WiFi who is upgrading, if so, please give me a shout. No rush, just gaining knowledge. Have not used AquaMaps, is it popular and used in Pacific NW much? An entirely different subject, but part of my learning curve. Thanks for the assistance.\n\nCheers, Sturt\n\nFirst, absolutely spend the extra $129 and get the cellular model. You don’t need to activate the cell service, but the built in GPS just works. All day, every day. And, if you do activate the cell service, it’s $10 a month added to your existing cell plan.\n\nSecond, I think either the new plain iPad with the A10 processor or the iPad Air with the A12 processor would be more than enough processing power for Navionics, or anything else you are likely to run. The Air is slightly thinner.\n\nDon’t consider the mini. The screen is too small and it’s always been the poor step child iPad.\n\nThe Pro is frankly just overkill for this use. I assume you have a marine chartplotter and will not use the iPad to serve this propose as a primary device? iPads are spectacular at doing supplemental navigation using Navionics, AquaMap or several others alongside the chartplotter, but the hardware is just not suited for sole use if outside. The screen is nowhere near bright enough in sunlight, the screen becomes quite unresponsive if even slightly damp, and you will need to supply it with power full time.\n\nI just did a five day trip, two days offshore, and trusted Aquamap more than my old Raymarine, but the iPad can’t drive the autopilot, among other things.\n\nAs for storage size, it depends on just how many navigation applications you plan to install, and how large a charting area you need to download for offline access. 32GB should be more than enough for Navionics and downloaded charts for the entire west coast. It will also give you room for PDF copies of every manual for every item on your boat.\n\nHaving said that, get 64GB or 128GB if you plan to store any other data.\n\nActually, having all of our manuals in one searchable application is almost as useful as navigating. While there are countless options for this, I use GoodReader for this one purpose. While I use Evernote and DEVONThink for other types of file or note management, I find GoodReader spectacular at browsing manuals.\n\nGet a simple case for the back as iPads on boats tend to get tossed around a bit. And a long Lightning charging cable is a must.\n\nAnd if you really want to have some fun, take the iPad with you the next time you fly, if we ever fly again, wait til you get to cruising altitude and open Navionics or any other navigation app. Sometimes it helps to sit in a window seat for better GPS reception, but seeing your boat going 450 knots is pretty entertaining."
