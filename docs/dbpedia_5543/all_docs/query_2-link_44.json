        "text": "U.S. Senate candidate Mark Kirk said in Springfield Wednesday that his staff was already working on correcting his military record when the U.S. Navy alerted his office that it had an inquiry about that record.\n\n“We started working on this, obviously, because of everything else that was happening, Blumenthal and all that,” Kirk told The State Journal-Register in an interview.\n\nKirk was referring to recent news stories about Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate there, having overstated his military record during the Vietnam War.\n\nKirk has long said he was named “Intelligence Officer of the Year” by the Navy in 1999. He actually belonged to a unit that received the Rufus L. Taylor Award, given by the National Military Intelligence Association, for service during the 1999 Kosovo campaign.\n\nChicago newspapers Wednesday quoted Cmdr. Danny Hernandez, a Navy spokesman, as saying the Navy contacted Kirk’s office last week.\n\n“We just let him know that you, the media, were asking questions about who the Intelligence Officer of the Year was,” Hernandez told the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times said passing such information on to Kirk’s office is a courtesy afforded all members of Congress who are subject to media questions. Kirk’s office was told that the 1999 winner of the reserve officer’s award was Allan Dunlop, a lieutenant commander.\n\n“This is a case where both sides are true,” Kirk said.\n\n“When the (Kirk) staff found it, they said it’s the Rufus Taylor award, not the Intelligence Officer of the Year,” Kirk said. “And then I said, ‘We’re going to have to correct this bio.’”\n\nKirk also released a statement from retired Navy Capt. Clay Fearnow, who said he nominated Kirk for the Rufus Taylor award and thought it was “more specific to Mark and not his team.”\n\n‘No team without Mark’s leadership’\n\n“The reality is, there would have been no team without Mark’s leadership and there certainly would have been no award,” Fearnow wrote. “I can certainly understand why he would have referred to his award over the years as intelligence officer of the year – it’s how I viewed the award.”\n\nKirk said the award was given in 2000.\n\n“The skipper called me up and said, ‘Hey, get back to Washington, accept this award. It’s a big deal.’” There were “a lot of speeches – ‘Great work, Mark. It was your team,’” Kirk said.\n\n“Because of the speeches and because of what the skipper said, I honestly thought this is what it was until we had done the legally precise research,” Kirk said.\n\nKirk said the “intense scrutiny” of running for a major office is going to make him watch his words more carefully.\n\nBut he added that a tough campaign will help him make even tougher decisions in Congress.\n\n“So in some ways, while difficult, this is all entirely appropriate,” he said.\n\nKirk is running against Democratic state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias for the U.S. Senate in November.\n\nBlagojevich trial\n\nKirk noted that jury selection begins today in the federal corruption trial of former Gov. Rod Blagojevich.\n\n“The Blagojevich trial will involve a lot of the leaders of the Democratic Party of Illinois,” Kirk said.\n\nAs to that trial’s effect on his race, Kirk said, “We’ll see. It’s a big thing.”\n\nOn the issue of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Kirk said that Transocean, the oil drilling company, should get primary blame, and BP, the oil company that hired the firm, should get secondary blame.\n\n“Third, I think, I would have hoped that we would have had even more of a federal response, especially from the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy does a tremendous amount of work at extreme depths. I don’t know if they’re there and simply don’t want their rule discussed, or if they’re not there.”\n\nHe said he thinks President Barack Obama’s decision to pause before going forward with more offshore drilling for oil is appropriate, but he also said technology should be developed to be able to stop such leaks.\n\n“My hope is eventually we do learn all this so as we go forward exploring for oil around the world … a fully heated, capable, ready, deployable, expert technology is available.”\n\nKirk also said he’s like to see construction of 50 nuclear power plants across the country.\n\nBernard Schoenburg can be reached at 788-1540.\n\nKirk faces new questions about military service\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — Senate candidate Mark Kirk faced new questions Wednesday about inaccurate descriptions of his military service, this time over wrongly saying that the congressman served “in” Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nIt is the second time in less than a week that Kirk, the Republican nominee for President Barack Obama’s old Senate seat, has had to explain inaccurate descriptions of his military record.\n\nKirk’s campaign said his official U.S. House website once incorrectly said he was the only member of Congress to serve in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that began in 2003. That was changed in 2005 to say that he served “during” the operation.\n\nKirk, a member of the Navy Reserves, served as a stateside intelligence officer during the invasion.\n\n“Over the course of a public career, unintentional errors do happen,” Kirk’s campaign said in response to a story on the blog Talking Points Memo. The campaign added that his 2005 campaign website always used the correct wording.\n\nThe description of Kirk serving “in” the operation went beyond his website. Newspaper stories of the period routinely said Kirk served in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and there’s no sign that he sought corrections.\n\nA 2004 op-ed column that Kirk co-wrote for the Washington Times also said he served in the conflict, and that’s how Kirk was sometimes described when he appeared on cable talk shows.\n\nKirk’s first correction of his military record involved his frequent claims that he has been named the U.S. Navy’s intelligence officer of the year in 1999. In fact, it was a different award and it went to his entire unit, not to Kirk personally, as the Washington Post first reported.\n\nThe five-term congressman portrays questions about his record as an attack on his military service by his Democratic opponent for the U.S. Senate, Alexi Giannoulias.\n\nGiannoulias, the Illinois treasurer, said Kirk served honorably but has misled voters.\n\n“I don’t know why he feels the need to embellish the record and not tell the truth,” Giannoulias said over the weekend.\n\nSeveral Illinois newspaper editorials on Wednesday said Kirk owes Illinois voters an apology.\n\n“If you’re a politician who pumps up your military record, you should admit it, beg for forgiveness and move on as best you can,” the Chicago Sun-Times wrote. “But, please, don’t insult the public by pretending your exaggerations were all honest errors.”"
