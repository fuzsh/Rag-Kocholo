        "text": "Illinois Sen. Mark S. Kirk‘s campaign is taking a victory lap as fellow Republicans abandon GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nKirk retracted his support of Trump back in June after Trump accused a judge involved in a trial related to Trump University of bias because of his Mexican ancestry.\n\n[Trump-Kirk Feud Escalates]\n\nOn Friday, after a video was released showing Trump making derogatory comments alluding to unwanted sexual advances toward women, Kirk unloaded on Trump again on Twitter.\n\nKevin Artl, Kirk’s campaign manager, said the campaign was happy it retracted the endorsement.\n\n“It’s always better to be on offense than defense, right,” Artl said in an email on Saturday.\n\nKirk is facing one of the toughest re-election races of any incumbent Republican this year against Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth in heavily Democratic Illinois.\n\nKirk has made breaking with his party a hallmark of his campaign. He was the first Republican Senator to meet with Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee.\n\nKirk also cut an ad in Spanish highlighting his criticism of Trump and expressing his support for overhauling immigration laws.\n\nThe Rothenberg & Gonzales/Roll Call Race Rating has labeled the race as “Leans Democrat.”"
