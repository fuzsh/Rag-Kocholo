        "text": "Mark Kirk remembers one of the longest nights of his life: May 9, 2011 — the night before he surrendered himself to authorities at the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office.\n\nFacing criminal charges in connection with a far-reaching bribery case involving a wealthy developer and some of the county’s top officials, Kirk, and his wife, Erin, braced themselves for what was about to come.\n\n“I put my 6-month-old daughter to bed that night, not knowing when I was going to see her again,” said Kirk, 43, a former chief of staff for former county supervisor Gary Ovitt. “There were lots of tears, but not with her. We kept it together for her. There’s no explaining that to a 6-month-old.”\n\nThe following day, Kirk, Rancho Cucamonga developer Jeff Burum, then county Supervisor Paul Biane, and former Assistant Assessor Jim Erwin were arrested and jailed in what prosecutors called an elaborate bribery scheme involving a $102 million legal settlement the county paid to Rancho Cucamonga developer Colonies Partners LP, of which Burum is a co-managing partner, in November 2006.\n\nMore than six years later, on Aug. 28, 2017, following an 8-month trial in San Bernardino Superior Court, Kirk, Burum and Biane were acquitted on all charges, found “not guilty” by a jury of their peers after about a day of deliberation. A month later, Erwin’s jury announced it was “hopelessly deadlocked,” and prosecutors subsequently dropped the case, citing “witness problems” they felt were “unresolvable.” Erwin had a separate jury because certain evidence against him was not admissible against the other defendants.\n\nDespite their vindication, the damage to the former defendants had been done and was irreversible.\n\n“The trial’s over, but the effects of what these guys did is not over,” Kirk said during a recent interview at his Hesperia home. “It was wrong what they did, and that’s got to stop. As long as they’re allowed to continue to do what they do, no one is safe.”\n\nLEGAL ACTION\n\nKirk, as well as the other former defendants, are demanding compensation for the financial hit they took following their arrests and the eight-year legal battle that followed. Since Kirk’s, Burum’s and Biane’s acquittal and Erwin’s case being dismissed, all but Biane, as well as Colonies Partners, have filed claims with the county alleging malicious prosecution and that the county failed to indemnify them in the criminal case. Damages sought top $100 million. Federal civil rights lawsuits may follow.\n\nErwin was the first out the door, filing a $25 million claim on Nov. 1, 2017. Colonies Partners followed, filing a $45 million claim on December 14, followed by Kirk on Dec. 18 with a $35 million claim. And on Jan. 30, Burum filed his claim but did not specify a monetary figure in damages.\n\nBurum claims he lost “tens of millions of dollars” in failed development deals and also lost salary from dismissals on various boards of directors because of damage to his reputation. The alleged damages extend over a period of about 20 years, Burum’s claim states, from civil actions and a land seizure at a development site in the late 1990s through the conclusion of the 10-month criminal trial last year. He is seeking both punitive damages as well as actual losses.\n\nThe county rejected Kirk’s claim on Jan. 31, the Colonies Partners claim on Jan. 26, and Erwin’s claim on Dec. 14.\n\nThe vindicated former defendants also want to see reforms to state laws, especially how the grand jury process works, a process the former defendants claim was exploited by prosecutors to their advantage and that resulted in their indictment.\n\n“The way the (prosecutors) manipulated the grand jury process is unethical and immoral,” Kirk said. “I’m shocked at how brazen they were. These were some pretty powerful people they chose to violate their rights.”\n\nThe former defendants allege prosecutors manipulated grand jury testimony and relied on the false testimony of several witnesses, including former Assistant Assessor Adam Aleman, former Assessor and Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Postmus, and county Supervisor Josie Gonzales, to land the indictment. Defense attorneys maintain they were not allowed to present their side.\n\nThe grand jury process does allow defense attorneys to submit exculpatory evidence, but it does not allow them to cross-examine witnesses.\n\nProsecutors with the District Attorney’s and state Attorney General’s offices have declined to comment. District Attorney spokesman Christopher Lee maintains it would be inappropriate due to ongoing legal matters related to the case. Postmus has yet to be sentenced and may withdraw his March 2011 guilty plea in connection with the Colonies case and for crimes he committed at the Assessor’s Office in 2007 and 2008, including misappropriation of public funds.\n\nPostmus testified during the trial that he felt intimidated by district attorney investigators, who he believed were pressuring him to provide them information that fit their narrative of the case. He also testified he never felt he was bribed for approving the Colonies settlement in 2006, when he was chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, nor that there was ever a quid pro quo.\n\nAn admitted methamphetamine addict who says he was at the peak of his addiction at the time of the Colonies settlement, during his time as county assessor, and during the Colonies investigation, Postmus says he has been clean and sober since 2012. He has retained a new lawyer and is due back in court April 27.\n\nDAMAGES\n\nKirk said his arrest cost him his $136,000-a-year job as chief of staff to former county Supervisor Gary Ovitt. Obtaining employment after that was scarce. Once a credentialed math and science teacher, Kirk could no longer teach. He said he had to cash out his retirement to cover his attorney fees.\n\n“I thought I would go back to teaching, which would be a good source of income while we fought the litigation, but the state of California would not clear my fingerprints because I had felonies pending,” Kirk said.\n\nPrior to going to work for the county, Kirk taught eighth-grade math at Pinon Mesa Middle School, in Phelan, from 1999 to 2001. Prior to that, he taught seventh and eighth-grade math at the now-defunct Victor Valley Junior High in Victorville.\n\nFollowing his arrest, the best Kirk could do was getting work as a tutor at Sylvan Learning Center in Victorville. He also started his own political consulting company, Paidea Group, but struggled because he had to inform clients about his criminal case.\n\n“I always tried to be upfront about that, and two-thirds of the time it was a dealbreaker,” Kirk said.\n\nHis acquittal in August hasn’t made things any easier. Kirk said he has since been on 30 job interviews for government jobs, but was either rejected or did not get any callbacks.\n\n“The financial impact of this was catastrophic, and there’s nothing we can really do to mitigate that,” said Kirk. “There are real, tangible losses associated with this. It’s not as bright now as it was because a lot of doors have been shut. I think this is something that will always be there.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kirk said he continues to pound the pavement, looking for his next opportunity, but he said his career in politics is essentially over, given the irreversible damage the Colonies case did to his reputation. He said if he returns to teaching, he would like to teach high school biology, math or both.\n\nNEW LIFE\n\nBut with Kirk’s losses have come tender moments and priceless joys, like having time now to walk his daughter to school every day.\n\n“In the past three years, there’s probably been a dozen times I didn’t walk my daughter to school,” said Kirk. “That’s the highlight of my day.”\n\nSince his arrest and in the eight years that have since passed, Kirk said he has forged friendships with former fellow defendants Burum, Biane and Erwin. In 2014, he said he celebrated his 40th birthday at Biane’s Rancho Cucamonga home.\n\nHe recounted a story about Burum, and his loyalty to Kirk, Biane and Erwin while briefly incarcerated at the Central Detention Center in San Bernardino in May 2011.\n\n“While in jail, my understanding was his wife had bail all arranged for him, and Jeff refused to post bail and leave until all of us posted bail. So he was the last one to leave, even though he was the first to have the means to post bail,” said Kirk. “He says to me, ‘I’m going to be the last to leave here. I’m not leaving until the rest of you go.’ That may not sound like a big deal, but when you don’t know how long it’s going to be and you know your family and your kids need you, that’s a heck of a statement.”\n\nKirk said Burum also refused to have his electronic ankle monitor removed until he, Biane, and Erwin had their monitors removed.\n\n“I have tremendous respect for those guys. The integrity they showed was inspiring,” said Kirk.\n\nWEATHERING THE STORM\n\nKirk said faith and commitment kept his family together through the last eight years, and a lot has changed in that time.\n\nHis daughter, Audrey, now 7, was only six months old when Kirk was arrested and charged. Kirk’s wife, Erin, an adjunct music professor at Victor Valley College, gave birth to a son, Leland, in June 2014. He is now 3.\n\nKirk said he and Erin had serious discussions about whether it was responsible to have another child while he was facing criminal charges.\n\n“It’s a tough conversation to have,” said Kirk. “We asked ourselves, ‘Do we want to give these people that kind of control over our lives?’ And the answer was a resounding ‘no.'”\n\nKirk said his church family has been a pillar of support through it all. He and his family were attending Victor Valley Christian Church at the time of Kirk’s indictment, and members of his congregation provided meals, childcare, and of course, prayers during the family’s ordeal.\n\nThe Kirks subsequently started attending New Hope Community Church in Apple Valley, where an opportunity opened for Kirk to minister to a youth group composed of middle school and high school-aged teens.\n\n“Whatever we needed, and then some, both churches, they stepped up immensely for us,” said Kirk. “Without them, it would’ve been exponentially more difficult.”\n\nKirk said, despite the support and comfort provided by family and church, moving on in the wake of Colonies will be difficult.\n\n“It’s going to be a long, long process to get to the point where this is really over. I don’t know if this is a six-month process, a year-long process, a 5-year process. I don’t know how long it’s going to be before a sense of normalcy returns,” he said. “We’ve been traumatized by this. It’s going to take us awhile to recover from it.\n\n“I don’t know how we managed it all, but by the grace of God, we made it through,” Kirk said. “We realized this was a season, and it would eventually end.”"
