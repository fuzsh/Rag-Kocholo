        "text": "At this same juncture in past presidential election cycles—in the aftermath of the conventions and with fewer than 100 days before voters hit the polls—party leaders usually coalesce behind their nominees, and fight side by side with them to win the White House and down-ballot races. But this is the year of Donald Trump.\n\nLeaving aside some incendiary comments on social media, in interviews, and at rallies, in his more scripted moments, Trump seems to be acting in a way that unites the party, rather than divides. Last Friday, he endorsed House Speaker Paul Ryan at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, throwing in endorsements for Senators John McCain and Kelly Ayotte for good measure. During that same rally, Trump told the crowd that \"as a unified party we will lead our country to unity as well.\""
