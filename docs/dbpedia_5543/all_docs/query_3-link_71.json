        "text": "FAIRBANKS, AK (WTAP)-- This is the 8th day of the Holiday Vacations trip to Alaska with Kirk Greenfield and 44 guests. Kirk is blogging his impressions and experiences in a semi-stream of consciousness for us:\n\nWe start today with the luxury of sleeping in, not having to pack our bags for pick-up and rolling out. As we depart at 9:45 a.m. we are headed for the working Gold Mine Dredge #8 operation. Guests will not only ride a small gauge electric train around the permeameter of the operations, but after several lecture demonstrations of how it works, we will be issued a miners pan and sack of gold dust laden gravel (”Poke”) to pan in a wooden sluice for gold. Everyone is guaranteed to find at least some flakes, which you may take with us. Of course, you’ll want to place them inside a small ornament or pendant on a neckless to show off your findings. That’s available in the gift shop after they weigh your finings. Almost everyone buys one, but some combine their loot into one larger amount for Grandma. It’s a smart move.\n\nDespite having some prior experience, we struggle to start the panning process. The instruction is better this time around, and we winnow down the “poke” of gravel to just some dirty gravel. But it’s much harder to wash the last of the gravel away before swirling the pan to spot any gold flakes. I am successful and score $12 worth of gold in about seven flakes. My wife is twice as successful. The best anyone in the group does is $35 at today’s prices. I am amazed that so few flakes can command such high prices.\n\nBut when I turn to the gift shop, I get an even bigger surprise: My favorite shorts are on sale, two for the price of one. So I score two more and feel good about my purchase...until I realize I have blown my personal budget. Too bad I can’t liquidate those gold flakes into cash!\n\nNext we head for the miner’s meal, family style. The beef & potato stew is done in individual pots or caldrons and is served on a picnic table. The rest of the meal is tossed salad, biscuits and rice with iced tea and brownies. It hit the spot before we board the Discovery III sternwheeler for a cruise down the Chena River. The commentary is excellent, as a Gray Television anchor keeps a running commentary on what we are passing and how the history of Fairbanks is intertwined with the development of the river merchandise trade. The five generation family that runs the sternwheel franchise also now owns the newly renamed Gold Dredge 8 mine operation when it was sold. It’s a smart move as it keeps another tourist attraction open and increases the tourism trade to attract business to Fairbanks, post pandemic.\n\nWe pause at the authentic Athabaskan people’s fish camp to learn of their culture and use of their wildlife kills.... every bit of the animal is used. NOTHING is wasted. We also learn about salmon slicing, drying and smoking. And we also pass by Susan Butcher’s Mush dog training facility “Blazing Trails” and learn about sled dogs. Her widowed husband co-wrote a book about the runt dog “Granite” who was nursed back to health and helped lead her sled dog team to win the Iditarod race four times. It’s an inspiring story along the lines of “The Little Engine that Could” and grandparents are snapping up copies to be autographed, dedicated and sent to their grandchildren.\n\nWe return to our hotel to discover that some of our key cards magnetized strips have failed, locking us out of our room. Quickly resolved, we rush to pack our final items and take the motor coach to the Fairbanks Airport as about a dozen guests are delivered to the WEO (Western Eskimo Olympics) nearby.\n\nWe make our goodbyes and walk into the terminal, check our bags at check in, and discover that our flight home has been delayed two hours. We will not leave for four hours, but will miss our connection in Chicago, and the bus connection at the far end. There are no seats available from Chicago to Columbus the rest of the day on any airline. So, we are stuck with either an 18-hour layover in Chicago after an all night flight, and no bus service home at midnight....OR, risk getting to Chicago and on standby for a 10 a.m. flight to Columbus that is not oversold. The ticket agent won’t guarantee we’ll get on, but there’s a chance someone or two won’t show, OR that their connection will be missed. We are hoping that will happen, so that we won’t have a 12 hour layover in Chicago. (Postscript: My wife and I flew Standby and got the last two seats on the plane.)\n\nThe rest of our guests are still in the Fairbanks Hotel, preparing to depart tomorrow morning to go to Denali National Park, which has re-opened after wildfires last week. As a result, they are out for dinner on their own and have no idea of our travel difficulties trying to get home. The better option is always to stay with the group and the reservations and travel connections, as Holiday Vacations commands major respect with the airlines and travel community. It’s one of the reasons why we continue to do business with them for these annual trips.\n\nAs I sit in the Fairbanks Airport terminal, awaiting our flight, I reflect back on the portion of the trip we were able to make with our guests, and it’s been good. The weather has cooperated at each point to make the most of each day. Our highs have been in the 70s and 80s and very tolerable. Even today’s sunshine at 80 in Fairbanks has been most enjoyable on the gold dredge train and the sternwheel excursion. And I now wish for overcast conditions and a little drizzle in Denali for our guests.... not out of spite, but to improve chances that the wildlife will come out tomorrow and become visible. Four different types of animals (bears, wolves, big horn sheep and caribou) constitute a “grand slam” and is a rare sighting, but is the goal on that day’s excursion. We wish them the best.\n\nAnd so, as my battery power fades in the airport terminal, I conclude this running blog of our trip. Family members from our guests have reported how much they have enjoyed it, and that pleases me, as its part of the very little feedback that we’ve received this far out in the Yukon with spotty internet service. But I’m glad to have shared it and feel it was worthwhile. Just remember to keep your phone and batteries charged, pack for a variety of weather, and always, always take your meteorologist along!\n\nTOK, AK (WTAP)-- This is the 7th day of the Holiday Vacations trip to Alaska with Kirk Greenfield and 44 guests. Kirk is blogging his impressions and experiences in a semi-stream of consciousness for us:\n\nWe wake to sunshine breaking up the overcast with NO drizzle. We head over to the Fast Eddie’s Cafe for a light breakfast that includes pancakes, fried egg, bacon, and wheat toast. I swap around half of my pancake with my table partner for their bacon strip and we eat a good and satisfying meal. This is my choice, as I’ll note later.**\n\nWe board the bus and begin to depart, getting just a mile and half outside Tok, when the Tour Director’s phone rings. It is the hostess of our motel, who reminds Shari they have prepared surprise snack bags for us to eat today. We turn around, grateful that we hadn’t got farther, and retrace our steps. There are 46 stappled white lunch bags each with a bag of Trail mix and Famous Andy’s mini cookies for each of us. It’s a nice touch.\n\nWe motor on the straight and narrow Alaska Highway to Delta Junction, where it ends at a welcome center. The landmark monument for the completion of the 1330 mile highway has been removed for refurbishing, but two other well-known wrought iron statues are there. Carefully crawling beneath the giant mosquitos, I pose below their extended nose for pictures. It’s a classic gag photo that used to be on postcards, and we’ve recreated it every visit. Everyone gets their shot and threatens to send it back to the station. We visit the gift shop, restrooms and the antique roadhouse before boarding.\n\nOur next stop is in North Pole, Alaska which promotes a Christmas theme all year round. First we stop at a plaza for lunch on our own. My wife and I choose Safeway’s Deli for Sweet & Sour Chicken on rice and I settle down to eat while she looks for a diet Pepsi. I take a bite of the pineapple and chicken, and am struck by an aftertaste of spice. I try a scoop of rice, and have a hard time swallowing it. Almost immediately, I am violently ill, and turn to the restroom next to us. After a half an hour, some Pepto and sips of water, I am stable enough to wander outside to our boarding point. Several people ask me if I’m alright. I guess the news that I was ill spread fast. I assure them that I’m doing better, and we motor on to Santa’s Workshop in North Pole. (**I am still not sure what set me off, and want to assure that it was no one’s fault. For some reason, nothing would stay down. And I had felt fine all morning until now.)\n\nMany grandparents pose for pictures with Santa after shopping the huge Christmas themed shop. We find they’ve remodeled in 2018 and expanded, removing the old Santa’s throne on which we had posed more than 10 years ago there. We instead find a Frosty the Snowman bench and pose for a new picture. My appetite is returning.\n\nWe drive to our Westmark Hotel and check in, all of us housed in the same tower, which makes it more simple. I shower and dress and begin this blog. After a quarter of an hour, it’s time to assemble to go to the Salmon Bake. A short drive to Pioneer Park deposits us at the entrance. We walk through the tunnel/mine shaft that has displays on either wall and alcove about the early days of gold mining and the history of Fairbanks.\n\nWe emerge in the park where various booths are vending drinks, Salmon, Prime Rib or Cod, along with two of five sides (beans, potato cubes, mac & cheese, green beans or more), and we can build our own toss salad from the long salad bar. We sit on the picnic style benches and tables to feast. EVERYONE remarks on how much food there is! But it’s still not over... as we have our choice of deserts and many choose ice cream sundae with a variety of toppings.\n\nWith another half hour left, we wander the historical park as other guests arrive. We find the gift shop and many browse while spouses sit in the golden sunshine and let dinner settle. Everyone comments on how large the feast was, and what a good choice this was. On the return to the hotel, the driver shows us downtown Fairbanks and describes life in Alaska year round. The record high temperature is 99 F degrees and the lowest is -66 F. He describes how moisture vents are stationed every few blocks for the utilities to prevent ground fog from developing during the winter. We spot a pink one with the classic Marilyn Monroe pose stenciled upon it. This is the farthest north we will travel, and the longest daylight we will experience... almost 22 hours!\n\nWe discuss plans to visit the Winter Eskimo Olympics on Friday evening as a special treat. The annual competition happens to be intown this weekend, a treat the driver and tour director happened to stumble upon two years ago. MOST of our day will be spent going to the working gold mine dredge operation, as well as a large sternwheeler on the Fraiser River. So this is an extra free event that could be included.\n\nUnfortunately, my wife and I will not be able to attend, due to prior plans... but that will be a tale for tomorrow.... if we have time to tell it. Hope to share it then!\n\nWHITEHORSE, AK (WTAP)-- This is the sixth day of the Holiday Vacations trip to Alaska with Kirk Greenfield and 44 guests. Kirk is blogging his impressions and experiences in a semi-stream of consciousness for us:\n\nSo we’re departing from Whitehorse, Alaska onto the Alaska Highway (formerly the Al-Can Highway) which leads from the lower 48 through Canada, through the Yukon Territory and into Alaska. This two lane highway was proposed in the 1920s and 1930s, but not constructed until World War II required “quick troop movements” to protect American holdings in Alaska... if it was needed. They built from both ends and met near Destruction Bay.\n\nThis is easily the longest travel day for us, as we must cover 385 miles at speeds that vary from 35 to 70 mph. The roadway is almost always under repair or reconstruction at some point, as the annual freeze-thaw cycle as well as Frost Heave tears up the roadway. Not all the road is torn up, and we enjoy the rolling vista, lakes, pines and mountains that ring us for hundreds of miles in every direction.\n\nWe have returned into Canada for just this one day, until the Alaskan Highway leads us to the U.S. border once again. We prepare for a similar experience as earlier in this trip, but today the Customs practices have changed. Though we have prepared customs declarations for Canada (basically saying we have bought nothing of value in the preceding day), all they want is for us to disembark in sets of six, with passports in hand to enter their office. Everyone passes, and only a few are asked anything more than if they’ve enjoyed their trip so far. (We suspect it is to confirm they speak English, but maybe the officers are just friendly.) We reboard and move out on our way to Tok.\n\nJust prior to the Customs inspection, we had stopped at the actual US/Canada border, that is marked with several things...a concrete monument with each country’s name facing a different direction...a long wooden bench with Canada/United States carved in it...a large sign saying Welcome to Alaska...and its opposite number declaring the Yucon Territory. Receding into the distance is the mowed strip that marks the border. We line up in front of the Alaska sign for several group photos, and I record a short stand-up at the monument for WTAP.\n\nFor lunch, we stopped at Destruction Bay, former site of a terrible windstorm that destroyed the US Army supply dump during the construction phase of the highway. The name has stuck ever since. We enjoyed a simple, fast lunch of cream of chicken soup, egg salad sandwich, Strawberry/Rhubarb pie and a soda. (The use of the term “soda” seems to be preferred out here, instead of “pop” as we know it. Last night, someone ordered a “ginger ale” for dinner and got an “Ale’ or beer through a misunderstanding.) The pick-me up meal is just right as we continued on a rolling ride on the long, long roadway.\n\nAs we approach Beaver Creek, the farthest west settlement in the Yukon, we stop at an information center that features a 1953 Dodge Mayfair setting out front. Most of us are impressed by it, and the elderly senior who greets us states it is one of ten classic cars he is keeping in his collection. Across the highway is an overgrown remnant of an expansive motel and dinner theater that I remember.\n\nMore than ten years earlier, we had stopped at that operation for the night and a very entertaining dinner theater in the round. The musical was performed by the wait staff and two leads for 23 years, and was always a hit with Holiday Vacations traveler. Today, it stands closed and abandoned along the roadway. As a result, we must travel a bit further to Tok, to find our lodgings at Fast Eddie’s restaurant and motel. Most have modest clean rooms for the night, but a few of us have charming rustic cabins.\n\nWe shower, dress and assemble for a fine meal in the family’s restaurant. Some have New York Strip, a quarter rack of ribs, or another main course after a large plate from the salad bar. By the time desert rolls around, we are too stuffed to enjoy the chocolate tart, apple pie, berry pie or other desert. Several take it “to go” back to the motel rooms.\n\nThe day has been overcast and drizzly but did not bother us along the route. Every time we have stopped for a break, the sun has come out and the drizzle stops. Some claim it is just good luck, but I assure them that it is because they took their Meteorologist along. It’s a been a running gag for about 20 years now.\n\nOne couple that took this trip with us 12 years ago recall some of the same sites and memories as I do. When I whip out a package of 60 clothes pins to gift our guests, those two remember why they are needed. As we approach the Arctic Circle, the day length is continuing to grow to near 23 hours. Though the skies grow dusky at sunset, they never grow dark. As a result, you need clothes pins to hold your curtains shut. It’s a lesson I remember well, and I am only too happy to share with our guests. They may not use them, but they will remember the lesson over the next three days as we reach Fairbanks, Alaska. I’ll be blogging about that next.\n\nSKAGWAY, AK (WTAP)-- This is the fifth day of the Holiday Vacations trip to Alaska with Kirk Greenfield and 44 guests. Kirk is blogging his impressions and experiences in a semi-stream of consciousness for us:\n\nOur day starts early as we are the first group to offload from our Holland-America ship The Konkingsdam at 8 am. While the city is small, the ship’s moorings are a fair walk from downtown, the train station and the business district. We board a local bus and drive into the small city to store our carry-ons in a local church! This is a new plan Holiday Vacations is trying out after getting some feedback from an earlier trip. The motor coach that will carry us through the Yukon is not done discharging his guests and boarding a ship yet, so an arrangement has been made to lock up our carry-ons for a $2/bag donation to the Presbyterian Church for a couple of hours.\n\nThe bus driver finds the church, but we cannot find the Pastor for some reason. We agree to offload what we want stored, and one of our guests volunteers to sit watch over them until we return. He is sincere in his offer and we agree. The next 3 hours are spent wandering Skagway, a formerly rough and tumble frontier town that was spawned by the 1897 gold rush in the Yukon. In addition to the bars and recreation, it was a shipping port for supplies. The Royal Canadian Mounties kept anyone from passing the top of Chilcott Pass unless they had a complete set of gear, including a mule or horse, and provisions for at least three months. Sometimes, it would take several trips up and down the 20 mile trail to amass the correct supplies. Everyone was in a hurry to go get that gold.\n\nThe town still has wooden boardwalk sidewalks, and features several roaring 1900 bars and brothels that combine costuming with gay honkytonk piano and a museum upstairs. The spirit of the era is recreated, if not the unsavory business that was banned in the post boom years of the early 1900s. Now, there are gift shops galore, jewelry stores, ice cream shops, pizzerias, museums and linen shops up the main Broadway and off the side streets. We got there early and have the run of the place, until all the passengers from the several cruise ships at dock disgorge their loads.\n\nBy noon, we’re ready to pick up our bags, (the checked luggage having been transported directly to the motor coach we are taking into the Yukon,) and we pay and bid farewell the Pastor. He had arrived later and showed us the better door for entering the church and storage area. We were glad to have their services as a solution to a time crunch and storage issue. Holiday Vacations will continue to fine-tune this to make it work smoother.\n\nWe go to the White Pass & Yukon Rail terminal and prepare to board and enjoy a box lunch provided. It’s a thick turkey sandwich on roll, with seedless grapes, cubed cheese, potato chips, a chocolate chip brownie, cans of glacier water and two bamboo forks and knives. It’s GREAT and renews our spirits as we await the train’s departure. We are in car 420 out of perhaps a dozen cars going up. The train starts slowly but picks up speed for the 23 mile journey up White’s Pass. As the track twists and turns, we are treated to great views of Skagway disappearing behind us, the alternative highway roadway, older tracks and a trestle that have been abandoned, and two pitch black tunnels. The view back from Inspiration Point is spectacular!\n\nAs we get to Fraizer, we must stop for customs and passport inspection as we are entering Canada for just one day again. We’re getting better at this form filling-out and make fewer errors this time. (No errors or scratch outs are permitted.) We pass with flying colors and as we reboard the motor coach, we note that the spitting rain from noontime has stopped, the skies have cleared and the temperature has dropped to the 60s. It is refreshing.\n\nWe stop twice more in rapid succession after boarding the coach. First is a free ice cream cone or fudge from the Walton General Store. I recall this shockingly pink-painted 1989 structure from our trip here almost 20 years before. The clerk scooping our cones says she was here then, and we visit pleasantly for a moment about old times. Some go outside to a rubber stamp table to get a location stamp added to the back of their passport. (We’re not sure this is kosher, but many do it without repercussions.)\n\nThe second stop is at Emerald Lake where we pile out for a group photo at the guard rail overlooking the blue-green lake. (It gets it’s color from the glacial ‘flour’ in the water reflecting the blue wavelengths.) The coach driver Jesse pops up through the emergency escape hatch in the roof of the coach to get a better angle of the group shot and it pays off. It’s a nice view. It will be one of several group photos that we take for a permanent record of our journey together.\n\nA third stop is a the Carcross Desert. This is a small patch of exposed sand dunes nestled in the Yukon mountains. It confirms that water levels were higher and the river carried ancient sands to this valley. Then, with a drop of water levels, the winds picked up and transport the sand into dunes that climb up the slope until they can’t climb anymore. The area is quite massive and includes Whitehorse and Carcross in this region.\n\nFinally we get to Whitehorse, so named because the rapids in the Yukon River reminded the miners of a surging pack of white horses with their manes flying. The rapids are gone now, replaced by a hydroelectric dam, but these whirlpools and rapids were a MAJOR barrier to the early miners who were attempting to float downstream into the Yukon to seek their fortune.\n\nWe check into the Best Western hotel and immediately adjourn to find dinner at area restaurants. The in-hotel restaurant has lost its credit card wire service, so we spread out. Many settle on the “Dirty Northern” cafe and bar. The driver has recommended it as he ate there last night. Once inside, I look up at the wall and see a painted poster of a simple orange cover to a Penguin classic novel titled “Dirty Northern Bastard” by D.H.Lawrence... for 6 pence.. “ and I recall seeing this many, many years before when we passed through. It turns out it is a joke mural by a known prankster artist. “Dirty Northern” is a British sports chant apparently.\n\nWe must turn-in soon, as the setting sun is now delayed until almost 11pm and rises at 4:15 am. We are in the land of the midnight sun, and while the summer solstice has passed, the long days are accentuated by the proximity of the arctic circle. This means the sun stays up for more than 20 hours before dipping below the horizon for a twilight night for only 3-4 hours. The closer we get to Fairbanks, the longer this lasts, until night is only an hour or so of dusk, and you must set your alarm clock to warn you to go to bed. Good thing I brough 5 dozen clothes pins to pass out among the guests. We will need them from now on to keep our curtains closed and the light out, if we are to sleep.\n\nI sit up for an hour and a half to write this blog entry before turning in. Tomorrow, we will have our longest travel day, from Whitehorse to Tok, Alaska and will encounter the Alaskan Highway and frost heaves that will slow our speed. We are promised a family-cooked meal at the finest motel in Tok (also the ONLY such complex along the ALCAN highway in Tok) if we can get there on time. And we will. More later tomorrow.\n\nJUNEAU, AK (WTAP)-- This is the fourth day of the Holiday Vacations trip to Alaska with Kirk Greenfield and 44 guests. Kirk is blogging his impressions and experiences in a semi-stream of consciousness for us:\n\nToday was the first port of call in Juneau for our cruise ship and our first opportunity to prowl the gift shops.\n\nOvernight, we crossed a time zone line, loosing an hour, allowing us to stay in. The day started with a briefing of how we were planning to leave the cruise ship in Ketchikan, Tuesday morning as scheduled. (We went over how to switch our luggage tags, put our bags out and assemble early to go directly off the ship and to the railroad depot. We will be riding the White Horse Pass Railroad up the trail of tears into the Yukon and into Canada once again. Each of our 24 MOV guests received their instruction packet and got their questions answered, as there will not be a lot of time to waste on Tuesday.)\n\nWe had the rest of the day to ourselves, whether by the pool, or attending a presentation about Glacier Bay for Wednesday as the cruise ship continues. It was a good educational explanation of glaciers, how they work and how they are classified. Unfortunately, we will not be seeing that on this trip, but it was an informative 45 minute presentation in the incredible World Stage 360 theater.\n\nBy 1:00 pm we were slowing and approaching Juneau, the capital of Alaska. The city is not accessible by auto, but only by ship, airplane or helicopter. The city was founded by an explorer how not only sited the mine here, but also named the features like “Sheep Creek” and Douglas on the other side of the bridge that joins Juneau. The statehouse has been judged one of the ugliest of the 50 capital buildings, but others don’t think so. Locals just call the State Office Building “the SOB” and let it go. (Subtle jokes from the Nature Presenter as we glide up the river to dock.)\n\nThere are at least four cruise ships in port and even more moored off shore, requiring tender craft to shuttle their people to and from the docks. It’s all very well coordinated for the dock crew to move between each company’s ship and secure our release into the city by 1:30 p.m. We dress for 70 degrees and bright clear sunshine and begin scouring the gift shops for those perfect gifts.... socks, coasters, plush animals, t-shirts, sweatpants, coasters, shot glasses, jewelry, and food.\n\nSome have booked excursions including the sky tram up to the Mendenhall Glacier welcome center, and some for the Tracy Arms Fiord visit. On our first visit, we also toured the Tropical Rain Forest Garden, though I can’t recall the name now. Their claim to fame was clearing the land with a backhoe, and upending a tree, driving it into the ground. It stuck. Planting flowers and exotic plants in the root ball, which was high above our heads, the tropical garden became a unique tourist attraction to this date.\n\nAfter a couple of hours shopping, we enjoyed a double dip of ice cream from the local confectionary. We bypassed the Alaskan Fudge in favor of a double dip in an ice cream parlor that looks like it’s out of the 1950s. While waiting at the Alaskan T-shirt Exchange, I am searching for socks for someone when I notice something familiar. The brand of clothing I’m inspecting is Lazy One...a brand I had last seen in Frasier, B.C. last year. While the socks have images of otters, whales, birds, bears, icebergs and more, I drifted along the racks of sweatpants and tops until I spotted the eight racks of boxer shorts I was looking for. Each had a funny saying, scene or double meeting pun on the butt. Each trip to the Pacific Northwest, I have purchased an 2XL pair of these shorts as sleep ware and find them most comfortable. I find my size and select the green plaid pair for myself. (It’s a guilty pleasure of mine that I’m sharing. I’ve even had others visit Yellowstone, spot these shorts and bring me back a pair as a gift!)\n\nWe return to the ship gangplank and I shoot an impromptu stand up for the WTAP News outside the ship. This is the first time we have seen the ship from the outside, as we entered through customs which blocked our initial view. It is HUGE! Despite my hair being a mess, I shoot a short summary of the day’s events and then search for the internet. Any number of vendors offer internet connect to me, for an addition $20/day, but I’m looking for just one free Wi-Fi connection that will support high-quality video for a minute or two to send my clip back. Eventually, I find a free connection, but it also has a come-on to subscribe, which makes no sense to me as we are about to board the ship. ( I have an account on-board waiting once again, but it may be slow or not process fast enough. ) Eventually, I retrace my steps and find a hot spot outside a large local coffee bean shop, and my video goes. At least I think it does. I try a second time and am surprised that it transmitted as fast as it played. Later, I get a message from WTAP that they got both attempts, so I relax.\n\nWe rush back to the ship and board without much difficulty, as they check our key card pass, our facial snap shot, and x-ray our shopping bags as we re-enter. None of us are stopped. We hustle back to our room to shower and dress for dinner once again. This day our number shrinks to just 16 of us eating in the main dining room, as some have other plans. The meal is great and the pace of dinner is slow as we talk about our day and what we shopped for and where we went.\n\nSuddenly at 7 pm, we realized there’s a comedy show about to begin so we rush to the World Stage at the other end of the ship for the first show by Chiago comedian Alvin Williams. He has appeared on Amazon Prime and Apple TV. Much of his humor is about who goes on cruise ships, what family life was like, and the differences between cultures and races. Not all the jokes hit, and he “course-corrects”, calling out the audience for our busy day and lack of strong response to some of his jokes. Eventually, I realize he has been at this game long enough not to be thrown by a cold or tired audience, and pulls us in. He’s an experienced performer who’s on a 4 month contract. The show is a mixed bag of hits and misses, but he assures us that he’ll be back on stage at 9 pm with a show “for those over 18″... code for more adult content. He’ll also be performing on the final night of the cruise (though we won’t be around for it.) This is the pattern for cruise ship comedians, (and maybe more in the line of work) that they work clean for early shows, but more “blue” for later shows. It’s also not uncommon for them to reference audience reaction from one show to the next, and make fun of us. I’d love to stay for the 9pm show, but we must pack.\n\nOur departure from the ship will come early tomorrow, and our bags must be repacked tonight, to be set outside our door and collected by the steward staff. So all our clothes and carry-ons must be pulled out and ready for tomorrow without access to our checked bags. They will go separately by truck around the White Horse Pass and wait for us at Customs above the rail line. It’s important that we not forget our passports, keycards, medicines, clothes and anything else needed for the day. And we have joked over dinner that anyone who forgets will be spending their day in pajamas all tomorrow, so there will be no hiding if you forget!\n\nWith that, I must turn in, after spending two hours writing up and revising this blog entry, as well as tracking our hours and fun. I am getting feedback from guests that their family members are following the blog back home, which pleases me, but also makes me hope that I’m giving each day its due. I hope you’ll be along for the next entry as we arrive in Skagway and board the train. It will be a good day, but high of only 60F and 40% chance of rain for a change. (PS: We’ve received word of Hurricane Beryl’s landfall and impact on Huston, Texas, but there’s not much we can do about it but pray for our Texan friends. Let us hope the mass of moisture doesn’t affect the MOV too badly as well.)\n\nKETCHIKAN, B.C. (WTAP)-- This is the third day of the Holiday Vacations trip to Alaska with Kirk Greenfield and 24 guests from the MOV. Kirk is blogging his impressions and experiences in a semi-stream of consciousness for us:\n\nWell, today has been our first full day aboard the Koningsdam and fully at sea, all day and night long. We won’t be stopping at Ketchikan until the boat returns down the inland waterway later this week, after our MOV group have departed. However, we are planning on arriving in Juneau tomorrow afternoon and many have purchased excursions that range from whale watching to hiking, an aerial tramway to the top of the glacier, a boat trip on the Tracy Arm Fjord to the base of the glacier, and more. Of course, there is always shopping at the many stores along the small town’s few streets. (But amazingly, Juneau is the state capital, even though Anchorage is much larger.)\n\nSome slept in today while others got up early to witness the ship thread through the narrow passage of the inland waterway at 4 a.m. One of our guests pointed out that it was cold, but the sun was rising, and then suddenly, the fog closed in, and you couldn’t see anything... but the ship’s radar and sonar certainly could!\n\nThe slight rocking of the ship woke me at 9:30 a.m.... but the subtle rocking was observed at various times during the day. There are dozens of activities aboard ship, from swimming and hot tubbing, to dance lessons, spa treatments, art auctions, trivia contests, shopping and more. It is not unusual to see families of all ages traveling together, some with matching t-shirts celebrating a 60th birthday, or similar theme. The guests aboard this cruise are international with all races and faiths represented.\n\nOn this particular cruise line, food is included and is available all day long from various cafes, vendor or stations, and the buffet breakfast lasts most of the morning. Separate cocktails or drinks cost extra, as well as exotic cuts of meat for the dinner hour. But by careful choices, you need not spend anything more (like $3 cans of pop, or other specialty items.} We have eaten twice in the main dining room so far and enjoyed excellent main courses. The service is excellent and the meal is an enjoyable pace.\n\nDuring tonight’s meal, one of our guests exclaimed “WHALE”, as she was facing the glass windows of the stern. We immediate stood and rushed to the windows, following her pointing arm. Sure enough, she had seen some sort of breaking of the waves including a “blow”, which is a sure sign of some aquatic mammal. As we continued to steam away from it, it breached several more times and receded toward the horizon. Many more tables saw our commotion and also craned their neck to see the sight. It was an unexpected thrill for us all. (Some have professional whale watching excursions planned for tomorrow!)\n\nAfter dinner, various shows are held in the cafes, bars, or main stage area. Tonight, live dancers perform in the World Stage, with its marvelous 360 degree screens, lighting and special effects. The interaction between the six dancers and the special effects is flawless, and we reward them with applause and some stood. In a heart-warming moment, a 3 year old climbed up onto the stage to turn circles after the show concluded. The crowd stopped filing out, and many applauded and encouraged her. Eventually, two of the female dancers came out on stage and interacted with her. We watched the heart-warming interaction for several minutes. It was a nice touch by the cast to reward and encourage the tyke. Who knows, maybe she will become a dancer!\n\nAlso held for others were trivia contests, board games, ping pong tournament, and a public showing of Dinsey’s “Bears”. [This nature documentary about the first year of an Alaskan brown bear’s life cycle has won many awards and is a heartwarming tale of two new cubs and their mother breaking hibernation and forging for food. It’s worth watching the 75 minute film as it has many themes of survival, ecology, the web of life and real life drama mixed with an at-times humorous narration of the two cubs learning the role in nature. The Wonderful World of Disney used to share such family nature films in the 1960s and beyond.]\n\nAs we are about to cross into yet another time zone, we have to set our clocks back when we turn in, but our phones and tablets will automatically reset for us. Analog and digital watches must be reset. I learned that my battery was weak while changing my digital watch as I was flying across the country. Unfortunately, I don’t have jeweler’s tools to replace the battery, so my watch has been retired to my suitcase when it suddenly went blank. (I think I may have also tripped a stop watch function while pressing buttons, but who knows.) It’s somewhat of a relief not to have a watch on my wrist, but makes me more dependent on my phone, much like my kids.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are several internet plans on board for various levels of data usage and broadband, as well as increases for multiple devices. They certainly know that we are a digital society now, and can’t be without our social media, news feeds, and instant communication. The price tiering is a bit steep, but what are you going to do if you MUST be in contact, such as I am. I have been pestered with pop up ads from Verison on my phone, ever since we crossed into Canada, offering temporary international minutes and more. They won’t let you ignore signing up, though if you examine your carrier’s coverage before leaving home, you can sometimes find that you’re already covered internationally, despite the pop-up ads from the cell tower at the border. Tip for the traveler: Check your plan before you leave home!\n\nExcept for gathering for our evening meal together, we haven’t been seeing too much of our MOV guests and others while on this cruise. Everyone can go their own way and sleep in, or spend time as they like, but you occasionally pass someone in the halls, on the deck or at a lecture. We will come together when we disembark on Tuesday in Skagway and board the inclined White Pass Railway (site of the famous photo of the 1949ers Gold Rush where a long line of bundled figures are climbing the snow and ice up to the pass. You’ll know the photo when you see it.)\n\nI should also mention that our 24 MOV guests have been joined by a family of six from Chicago, and another group of ten that have swelled our ranks to 44...a full load for this trip! I had not realized that until we came together at Seattle. By the end of the trip, all will be friends and have shared some great memories on this trip.\n\nTomorrow: Juneau excursions. But it’s time for bed now. More later on.\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C. (WTAP)-- This is the second day of the Holiday Vacations trip to Alaska with Kirk Greenfield and 24 guests from the MOV.\n\nAfter a good night’s sleep, we woke at 6:30 a.m. local time in the Seattle Doubletree Hotel for a quick breakfast. I took a few minutes to run up to the 9th floor of the tower where a sunlit view of Mount Rainier was possible, and recorded a short 40 second stand-up in front of the window that faced the mountain to our SE. This time, the video was good and the audio was clear, and despite the bags under my eyes from the long day yesterday, I felt much better about sending it home for use in the news, as it might fit on a slow Saturday.\n\nWe boarded the motor coach and proceeded through Seattle, joining I-5 to the north. Quickly, we learned how to call out sights and attractions so that everyone on the bus could immediately spot them. Based on a clock face, the Space Needle (for example) might be dead ahead at 12 o’clock, or the T-Mobile Park stadium might be to our left at 9 o’clock. Very quickly, we got the hang of it, and people were spotting float planes, sculptures, buildings, Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon, a wolf along the expressway, and other interesting sights as our tour director began to explain the process of crossing the Canadian border and customs ahead. (This skill in spotting will become very handy later in Alaska when watching for wildlife in Denali National Park!)\n\nAfter almost an hour on the road, we approached the Canadian border. We were all very surprised at the long, long line of cars backed up, waiting to cross into Canada. Fortunately, our motor coach and 12 wheelers were permitted to pass in the right-most lane, and leap frog all the way up to the customs office, where only one was ahead of us. The driver went inside for a briefing and to clarify what besides a customs declaration form and our passports might be needed. We were relieved when we learned that was all they would ask of us, besides a visual inspection of the inside, underside and luggage compartments of the bus. (Holiday Vacations and this bus line are known quantities and so the routine is familiar to both sides!) We offloaded and walked into the building, advancing by couples to the customs agent. Most only had the most rudimentary of questions asked of us... how long we were staying in Canada, where we were from, and if West Virginia was that state where a coach had been fired! Only one of us spoke up and asked for a rubber stamp in the back of her passport. He obliged and after changing the date, stamped a back page for her. After the brief search of our motor coach, we boarded once again and were on our way.\n\nTechnically, we were Canada only up to Vancouver, and then boarded the Koningsdam which has a U.S. registry, and is technically U.S. territory once more. After a lengthy walk through a massive customs building, we walked the gangplank and boarded our home for the next three days, the Koningsdam which is owned by Holland-America Lines. We had printed our boarding pass at home in advance and so knew that our state room was 7005 in the corner suite on the seventh deck. Our picture was snapped and our documents were inspected, and we carried our carry-ons to the crowded elevators (!) and then walked the length of the ship to our door.\n\nTo our surprise, the room was already occupied, despite my holding a confirmed reservation in my hand. We were tired from our long walk with baggage, I sought out two stewards who entered the room and confirmed it was already occupied by another gentlemen. They examined my boarding pass and confirmed the room number, and then consulted their smart phone. They indicated despite my holding the printed boarding pass in my hand, there was no record in the system of me. They indicated we would have to go back down to deck 3 and the Guest Services office.\n\nAt this point, I began to worry, because our checked baggage both had boarding tags that had room 7005 printed out. I knew they were going to be delivered to that same room. Weary from the walk, we found our way to guest services and got in the long line. There were MANY smartly suited employees processing guests and trying to resolve issues for the multi-national guests. Before long, we were at the head of the line, and they confirmed what we had already knew. We were not booked into room 7005. Instead, we had been “upgraded” to room 6070, and had to find where that was. After a long trudge, we found the right door, with the personalized credit card door keys awaiting, and we let ourselves into the room.\n\nIn all, only two of our couples had their rooms changed on them...but the other couple had been told at the gangplank of the change and went immediately to their new room. So it goes. )\n\nI’ve dwelt on this far more than I should, and it will fade into just one more surprising twist in a long line of trips that we have enjoyed. It’s funny... it’s the exceptions and hurdles that pop up on every trip that we remember most clearly and stand out fondly in our memories. I don’t mean to mis-characterize the trip or the ship. It is beautiful, large and luxurious.\n\nAfter some rest and a shower, we explored the ship and found the swimming pools, hot tubs, bars, grills and entertainment lounges. We returned to our room and dressed for dinner, a “Gala Night” which is the only time when guests are asked to not dress in jeans, shorts, tank tops or overly casual attire for dinner. Polo shirts, slacks and dark colors are suitable in the main dining room, and jackets and ties are not necessary.\n\nThe food was excellent, with Fliet Minion and Lobster Tails being just one popular choice among the many options. All food (and other charges, for that matter) are processed to an account tied to your room key card. In addition to the $50 deposit that the card carries, a credit card account must be attached...so that accumulating charges are all guaranteed by a valid charge card. It makes sense, but it’s almost too easy to charge that extra, that drink, that purchase or other expense against your room without thinking about it. I suppose that many people on this cruise are not worried about the expense, but it’s something that fiscally responsible Kirk needs to keep an eye on. We can enjoy our selves but within my budget.\n\nAs dinner ends, we note that our ship is starting to move away from the dock, some two and a half hours after scheduled departure. The captain had come on the loudspeakers and explained the delay. Something about a medical emergency and that the patient had been removed and transported by ambulance for care. Not all of us caught what was said, but I am reassured that the ship and company were prepared for such an emergency and delayed departure to assist, rather than just leaving and distressing the family of the patient. That shows quality of service to me. The time we were delayed will be made up overnight as we steam up the inland waterway toward Juneau in two days time. These things happen.\n\nAfter dinner, we decide to check out the music being played in the “Billboard on Board” lounge (Top 40 songs from the 80s being played live on dual pianos) and then the “Rolling Stone lounge” (harder edge rock band just across the open corridor) for the next half hour. Alternating the performances in adjacent lounges is a nice way to turn over your customers, and also provide continuing live music.\n\nWe decided to take in a live presentation on the history of Holland-America Lines in the main “World Theater”. I was surprised to see it was a combination of live lecture and multimedia slide show, complete with video interview clips and other special effects. The story covers 150 years of the steamship line, and concentrates on their achievements, humanity and continued success that has lead to today’s cruise line. It’s a story that is woven around world wars, economic turndowns, pandemics, and service to the public. It’s VERY well done, and I’m better informed because of it. As the lights come up, I discover the person next to me has fallen asleep, and realize it is now 9pm Pacific Time, but midnight back home. No wonder some have turned in.\n\nI take another two hours to compose this blog entry, reflecting on the busy day we have had. Despite any bumps in the road, we are on-board on a luxury cruise ship headed up the inland waterway and all is well. Our tour director has guided us well, and for the next three days, we’ll explore the ship and the many ports of call along the inland waterway. If I can figure out how to access the internet from my stateroom, I’ll be posting updates daily and also recording video clips of stand-up reports on our activities. I hope you’ll be along for them.\n\nPARKERSBURG, W.Va. (WTAP) - Kirk Greenfield and 24 guests from the Mid-Ohio Valley began their 12 days trip to Alaska on Friday, July 5th.\n\nStarting with a 4 AM wake up, Kirk and company gathered at The Baymont Inn to board a motor coach for the three hour ride to Pittsburgh airport. We ran on schedule and all went well, meeting our tour director Sherry. A short hop to Chicago for a connecting flight gave some a chance for shut eye, and then a four hour flight to Seattle was next. This plane was also full. Eventually, the Rocky Mountains came into view, and we were thrilled to see snowcapped mountain ridges sail by. The largest mountain by far was Mount Rainier, which can be seen most anywhere from Seattle, including our hotel for the night.\n\nSome chose to go right to bed, while others decided to find a bit to eat either in the hotel restaurant or across the street as a variety of smaller eateries, including Subway, the 13 Coins Steakhouse, the Hawaiian Hibachi and more.\n\nI have always said that the first day is the hardest, in part because of working the evening shift, and then having to turn around and drive to the pick-up point before dawn. The good news is that our Holiday Vacations Tour Director is very experienced and has it all under control. In addition to our 24 MOV travelers, there are six more coming from Chicago and a family of ten who will also be with us, for a total of 42 on this trip.\n\nWe are all excited to start our three day cruise with Holland America on the inland waterway tomorrow, Saturday and visit Canadian and Alaskan ports of call all the way up to Skagway. But more on that later. It’s time for some much needed shut-eye.\n\n*(One small sad point: We were disappointed to discover that our favorite T-Rex skeleton “Sue” at the Pittsburgh airport is not visible while reconstruction work is going on. It’s a favorite landmark that we had been hoping to snap pictures of and shoot a video for the folks back home. Perhaps another day of upon or return.)"
