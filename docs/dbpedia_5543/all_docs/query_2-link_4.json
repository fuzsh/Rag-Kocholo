From what I have found, the mark fits the 1846 to 1861 era, but there appears to be some conflicting information as to how long they used the 11oz mark. Since the \"son\" is singular, this eliminates the 1861 to 1868 era, so this mark is either just before or just after that period?\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!!\n\nIP: Logged\n\nahwt\n\nPosts: 2334\n\nRegistered: Mar 2003\n\nposted 09-20-2016 12:38 AM Jennifer Faulds Goldsborough in her book \"Silver in Maryland\" attributes Kirk and Son mark to the years 1846-61 and 1868-96. She shows the 11oz and the 10.15 mark used in both periods.\n\nGoldsborough in her book \"Maryland Silver\" also shows the 925/1000 mark being in the 1868-96 period.\n\nAfter 1896 \"CO\" was added to their Kirk and Son mark.\n\nDorothy Rainwater in her book Encyclopedia of American Silver Manufacturers shows 925/1000 mark in use as early as 1868, but I did not find anything in the text of these books that states when Kirk started using the sterling standard.\n\nYou may be able to use the style of your piece to better identify the time period of your piece.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nVetdaddy\n\nPosts: 70\n\nRegistered: Feb 2016\n\nposted 09-20-2016 10:12 AM Thanks for your input and and information. I am aware of the \"Maryland Silver\" book, but the \"silver in Maryland book\" is one I will look for.\n\nMy thought, not to be taken as fact, is that the earlier (1846-1861) 11oz mark was a single punch. The 11oz marks that I have seen from the later period in combination with the more scripted S. KIRK & SON (1890-1896) mark is different. These later 11oz marks appear as individual letters rather than a single punch. Seem reasonable?\n\nIP: Logged\n\nKimo\n\nPosts: 1627\n\nRegistered: Mar 2003\n\nposted 09-20-2016 11:14 AM Once there is a marking punch made I am not sure it is always safe to assume it was in use for only one time period, unless there is evidence that it was broken at some point.

They must have been popular in Maryland as well as New York as Kirk certainly made a fine pair.\n\nI would guess that your ewers or pitchers were from the same time period.\n\nI am not really clear on when a pitcher is as called a ewer, but normally when the throat is narrow it seemed to be called a ewer.\n\nThanks for sharing.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nahwt\n\nPosts: 2334\n\nRegistered: Mar 2003\n\nposted 09-20-2016 05:17 PM From what I read in the reference books Kirk marketed three grades of silver in the period 1868-1896;e.g. 10.15 oz, 11 oz and 925/1000. That seems a bit excessive even for the late 1800s, but it may be true.\n\nDoes that seem excessive to anyone else?\n\nIP: Logged\n\nVetdaddy\n\nPosts: 70\n\nRegistered: Feb 2016\n\nposted 09-20-2016 06:57 PM That sounds correct:\n\n10.15 is 89.58% pure\n\n[(Divide 10.75 (15/20 pennyweight) by 12oz]\n\n11oz is 91.66% pure\n\n[Divide 11oz by 12oz (one troy pound)]\n\n925/1000 is of course sterling at 92.5% pure\n\nAnother way to look at it is:\n\nOld Kirk \"coin\" standard: 10.15\n\nLater Kirk \"coin\" standard: 11oz\n\nSterling standard: 11.2 or 925/1000\n\nIt appears that Baltimore had its own \"silver standard\" that was not necessarily in line with the US standard.\n\nIn 1837 Congress standardized coin silver to be 900/1000 or 90% pure. So It seems that the Kirk 10.15 silver fell just below this, and the 11oz silver put them just above this 90% standard.\n\nAn I on the right track or am I totally confused?\n\n[This message has been edited by Vetdaddy (edited 09-20-2016).]\n\n[This message has been edited by Vetdaddy (edited 09-20-2016).]\n\nIP: Logged\n\nVetdaddy\n\nPosts: 70\n\nRegistered: Feb 2016\n\nposted 09-20-2016 07:03 PM ahwt- thanks for the link to the card cases and water pitcher- incredible!!\n\n[This message has been edited by Vetdaddy (edited 09-22-2016).]\n\nIP: Logged\n\nahwt\n\nPosts: 2334\n\nRegistered: Mar 2003\n\nposted 09-20-2016 11:57 PM The Silver in Maryland book notes that Kirk also had a 10.19 mark under the word Crown. This was to signify that they used French coins in the item. I have never seen a piece with this mark.\n\nA third book that you may be interested in is Maryland Silversmiths 1715-1850 by J. Hall Pleasants and Howard Sill. This was initially published in 1930 and was reprinted in 1972 by Robert Alan Green.\n\nI did a search on bookfinder and both the 1930 and 1972 editions are available.\n\nDo you know if the buildings shown on your Kirk pieces are representations of real buildings?\n\n[This message has been edited by ahwt (edited 09-21-2016).]\n\nIP: Logged\n\nVetdaddy\n\nPosts: 70\n\nRegistered: Feb 2016\n\nposted 09-21-2016 09:43 AM I am not aware if they represent actual buildings.

Cheryl, I will research the church that you mentioned, thanks!!.\n\nHere are a few more pictures to tell the full story. Although these were obviously made as a pair, the scenes on each are different.\n\nThe next two pictures are scenes on the front of the ewers. My best guess is that they represent war and peace:\n\nThe next two pictures are masks below each spout. Their meaning?:\n\nThe next picture is the coat of arms that is identical on each ewer:\n\nMy best guess is that this set was made for a wealthy Anglo-Irish family that immigrated to Baltimore.\n\nThese ewers have very little patina and appear to have seen little to no use. This seems strange considering their age, but this next picture gives a clear explanation.\n\nThey were apparently stored throughout the years in their original shipping box:\n\nIP: Logged\n\nagphile\n\nPosts: 798\n\nRegistered: Apr 2008\n\nposted 09-21-2016 06:44 PM A magnificent pair. The Latin motto beneath the coat of arms reads \"frangas non flectes\" - you may break not bend. My copy of Fairbairn's Crests attributes this to several families but I am afraid I cannot match the crest above the arms to any of them and I don't have any reference work that might help with the arms themselves.\n\n[This message has been edited by agphile (edited 09-21-2016).]\n\nIP: Logged\n\nVetdaddy\n\nPosts: 70\n\nRegistered: Feb 2016\n\nposted 09-21-2016 09:04 PM I have not had any (Irish) luck in identifying the crest. The closest that I have found is that for \"Tully.\" The shape of their crest along with their \"chevron\" and three \"griffins\" is in the ballpark.\n\nThis genealogy stuff is not easy. I found there are many variants of the Tully surname, including Flood, Floyd, Floode, Floyde, Tully, MacTully, Tally, Talley.....and apparently many others.\n\nSoon I will surrender.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nKimo\n\nPosts: 1627\n\nRegistered: Mar 2003\n\nposted 09-23-2016 03:30 PM I do not recognize the engraved achievement of arms, but I can add that the crest (the design above the shield) includes a coronet (crown) which has a very specific meaning. Depending on your rank in the peerage, the upper ranks use a crown or a coronet depending on your rank and the design of it changes with each rank. This particular coronet design with five points with the two on the ends being strawberry leaves and the second and fourth being pearls signifies that this crest belonged to either a Marquess or one of his heirs. I do not see any cadency markings in the upper area of the shield so this would more likely belong to the person who was the Marquess himself rather than one of his sons, but one does not always see cadency markings on the shields of sons especially when there is only one. The cadency marking for an eldest son is a bar with three lines coming down and looks like a capital E on its side. A second son is a crescent, and third son would have a star, a fourth son would have a bird, a fifth son would have a ring, etc.\n\nA Marquess is a very highly ranked member of the peerage - he is ranked above an Earl and below a Duke so I am not sure why any Marquess would have been living in Maryland. It is possible these could have been made to send back to the Marquess in England and perhaps was never sent for some reason, or it could be a fantasy armorial achievement to make the ewers look fancier.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nagphile\n\nPosts: 798\n\nRegistered: Apr 2008\n\nposted 09-23-2016 06:05 PM Kimo\n\nI am not sure that is right. The coronet here is part of the crest with the griffin's (?) head rising out of it. If the coronet were a marker of rank in the nobility it would be above the crest.\n\nWhile a crest is normally on a torse, there are a good many which are blazoned as out of a coronet, or on a chapeau and the like, without signifying a title.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nVetdaddy\n\nPosts: 70\n\nRegistered: Feb 2016\n\nposted 09-23-2016 11:43 PM Thanks Kimo and Agphile for your input. This is definitely beyond my field of expertise. Although I do feel the armorial(s) are contemporary, the thought crossed my mind that even in the mid 1800's, someone might have been reminiscing the past.\n\nI did find a couple of similar, but not exact crests with a griffin head arising from a coronet. This seems to be a not so rare combination with no specific attribute. Below is one picture that I found:\n\nI will back track from my acquisition and if successful, post any information that I find.\n\nAre there any thoughts as to country of origin?\n\nIP: Logged\n\nKimo\n\nPosts: 1627\n\nRegistered: Mar 2003\n\nposted 09-24-2016 09:46 AM Hi Agphile.\n\nI am referring to British arms. While the king or queen and the princes have just a crown, the ranks below that have a coronet with a crest arising from the top. If you like you can search on 'college of arms' and 'crowns and crests' and there you will see some very nicely carved 3-D crests of some Knights of the Garter that are on display at Arundel Castle. The ones belonging to the higher ranking nobility (Earls, Viscounts, etc.) feature a coronet with a device arising from it.\n\nI have some personal familiarity with British arms.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nagphile\n\nPosts: 798\n\nRegistered: Apr 2008\n\nposted 09-24-2016 07:58 PM Hi Kimo\n\nI ought first to put right I slip I made in my earlier comment. When I wrote of the coronet to depict rank being above the crest, I was thinking of engravings that showed only the crest, not the full arms. An illustration (from a book binding rather than a piece of silver) will show what I mean. This is for the Marquess of Hertford.\n\nIt is the style I am most familiar with on British silver. While I have seen one or two examples of this happening above a coat of arms as well, it is a very small minority of cases and probably betrays ignorance by the engraver or lack of interest by the owner. You are of course right that correctly speaking the coronet should be on top of the shield and the crest above that. Indeed, on a full-blown version the crest would be atop a helmet above the coronet. This for the Marquess of Bristol:\n\nIn practice the helmet is often omitted. Thus, for the Marquess of Salisbury:\n\nThe crossed arrows crest simply floats above the coronet.\n\nWhere I think we differ is that you are seeing the crest on the ewers as being something on these lines whereas I am seeing them as more like the following for a Mr Edward Webb (not a peer).\n\nHere the coronet is part of the crest and not a signifier of rank in the peerage.\n\nHowever, I do not claim expertise in heraldry. What little I think I know derives from engravings on silver (mostly simply crests) that I have tried to research, with variable success. I have used pictures from book bindings here, rather than silver, because they are more easily accessible (I donât have the right examples on silver I own). Whether I am right or not, I hope the pictures at least show why I am not sure we are looking at the arms and crest of a Marquess.\n\n[This message has been edited by agphile (edited 09-24-2016).]\n\nIP: Logged\n\nagphile\n\nPosts: 798\n\nRegistered: Apr 2008\n\nposted 09-25-2016 03:45 AM PS I should for clarity have added the explanation that the crest for the Marquess of Hertford shown above is surmounted by an Earl's coronet. I assume that simply means it was done while he was still an Earl and yet to become a Marquess. It would not have been practicable to alter every embossing and engraving while advancing through the peerage.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nScott Martin\n\nForum Master\n\nPosts: 11520\n\nRegistered: Apr 93\n\nposted 09-25-2016 11:20 AM This thread may have sparked some new members to register.

The background is black, the chevron is half silver (the plain part) and half gold (the dotted part), and the gryphons' heads are also silver.\n\nAccording to Bolton's \"American Armory\", these are the arms of someone named Bourne. Bolton also gives the crest (a gryphon's head ducally gorged, holding a rose) and motto as shown on the ewer.\n\nPerhaps a reference book on old Maryland families will turn up a Bourne family that might provide further clues.\n\nIP: Logged"
