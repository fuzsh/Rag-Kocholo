        "text": "Before beginning your paper, you need to decide how you plan to design the study.\n\nThe research design refers to the overall strategy and analytical approach that you have chosen in order to integrate, in a coherent and logical way, the different components of the study, thus ensuring that the research problem will be thoroughly investigated. It constitutes the blueprint for the collection, measurement, and interpretation of information and data. Note that the research problem determines the type of design you choose, not the other way around!\n\nDe Vaus, D. A. Research Design in Social Research. London: SAGE, 2001; Trochim, William M.K. Research Methods Knowledge Base. 2006.\n\nThe function of a research design is to ensure that the evidence obtained enables you to effectively address the research problem logically and as unambiguously as possible. In social sciences research, obtaining information relevant to the research problem generally entails specifying the type of evidence needed to test the underlying assumptions of a theory, to evaluate a program, or to accurately describe and assess meaning related to an observable phenomenon.\n\nWith this in mind, a common mistake made by researchers is that they begin their investigations before they have thought critically about what information is required to address the research problem. Without attending to these design issues beforehand, the overall research problem will not be adequately addressed and any conclusions drawn will run the risk of being weak and unconvincing. As a consequence, the overall validity of the study will be undermined.\n\nThe length and complexity of describing the research design in your paper can vary considerably, but any well-developed description will achieve the following:\n\nIdentify the research problem clearly and justify its selection, particularly in relation to any valid alternative designs that could have been used,\n\nReview and synthesize previously published literature associated with the research problem,\n\nClearly and explicitly specify hypotheses [i.e., research questions] central to the problem,\n\nEffectively describe the information and/or data which will be necessary for an adequate testing of the hypotheses and explain how such information and/or data will be obtained, and\n\nDescribe the methods of analysis to be applied to the data in determining whether or not the hypotheses are true or false.\n\nThe research design is usually incorporated into the introduction of your paper. You can obtain an overall sense of what to do by reviewing studies that have utilized the same research design [e.g., using a case study approach]. This can help you develop an outline to follow for your own paper.\n\nNOTE: Use the SAGE Research Methods Online and Cases and the SAGE Research Methods Videos databases to search for scholarly resources on how to apply specific research designs and methods. The Research Methods Online database contains links to more than 175,000 pages of SAGE publisher's book, journal, and reference content on quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methodologies. Also included is a collection of case studies of social research projects that can be used to help you better understand abstract or complex methodological concepts. The Research Methods Videos database contains hours of tutorials, interviews, video case studies, and mini-documentaries covering the entire research process.\n\nCreswell, John W. and J.

New York: Guilford, 2012.\n\nDefinition and Purpose\n\nThe essentials of action research design follow a characteristic cycle whereby initially an exploratory stance is adopted, where an understanding of a problem is developed and plans are made for some form of interventionary strategy. Then the intervention is carried out [the \"action\" in action research] during which time, pertinent observations are collected in various forms. The new interventional strategies are carried out, and this cyclic process repeats, continuing until a sufficient understanding of [or a valid implementation solution for] the problem is achieved. The protocol is iterative or cyclical in nature and is intended to foster deeper understanding of a given situation, starting with conceptualizing and particularizing the problem and moving through several interventions and evaluations.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nThis is a collaborative and adaptive research design that lends itself to use in work or community situations.\n\nDesign focuses on pragmatic and solution-driven research outcomes rather than testing theories.\n\nWhen practitioners use action research, it has the potential to increase the amount they learn consciously from their experience; the action research cycle can be regarded as a learning cycle.\n\nAction research studies often have direct and obvious relevance to improving practice and advocating for change.\n\nThere are no hidden controls or preemption of direction by the researcher.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nIt is harder to do than conducting conventional research because the researcher takes on responsibilities of advocating for change as well as for researching the topic.\n\nAction research is much harder to write up because it is less likely that you can use a standard format to report your findings effectively [i.e., data is often in the form of stories or observation].\n\nPersonal over-involvement of the researcher may bias research results.\n\nThe cyclic nature of action research to achieve its twin outcomes of action [e.g. change] and research [e.g. understanding] is time-consuming and complex to conduct.\n\nAdvocating for change usually requires buy-in from study participants.\n\nCoghlan, David and Mary Brydon-Miller.

It is often used to narrow down a very broad field of research into one or a few easily researchable examples. The case study research design is also useful for testing whether a specific theory and model actually applies to phenomena in the real world. It is a useful design when not much is known about an issue or phenomenon.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nApproach excels at bringing us to an understanding of a complex issue through detailed contextual analysis of a limited number of events or conditions and their relationships.\n\nA researcher using a case study design can apply a variety of methodologies and rely on a variety of sources to investigate a research problem.\n\nDesign can extend experience or add strength to what is already known through previous research.\n\nSocial scientists, in particular, make wide use of this research design to examine contemporary real-life situations and provide the basis for the application of concepts and theories and the extension of methodologies.\n\nThe design can provide detailed descriptions of specific and rare cases.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nA single or small number of cases offers little basis for establishing reliability or to generalize the findings to a wider population of people, places, or things.\n\nIntense exposure to the study of a case may bias a researcher's interpretation of the findings.\n\nDesign does not facilitate assessment of cause and effect relationships.\n\nVital information may be missing, making the case hard to interpret.\n\nThe case may not be representative or typical of the larger problem being investigated.\n\nIf the criteria for selecting a case is because it represents a very unusual or unique phenomenon or problem for study, then your interpretation of the findings can only apply to that particular case.\n\nCase Studies.

Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2003.\n\nDefinition and Purpose\n\nCausality studies may be thought of as understanding a phenomenon in terms of conditional statements in the form, “If X, then Y.” This type of research is used to measure what impact a specific change will have on existing norms and assumptions. Most social scientists seek causal explanations that reflect tests of hypotheses. Causal effect (nomothetic perspective) occurs when variation in one phenomenon, an independent variable, leads to or results, on average, in variation in another phenomenon, the dependent variable.\n\nConditions necessary for determining causality:\n\nEmpirical association -- a valid conclusion is based on finding an association between the independent variable and the dependent variable.\n\nAppropriate time order -- to conclude that causation was involved, one must see that cases were exposed to variation in the independent variable before variation in the dependent variable.\n\nNonspuriousness -- a relationship between two variables that is not due to variation in a third variable.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nCausality research designs assist researchers in understanding why the world works the way it does through the process of proving a causal link between variables and by the process of eliminating other possibilities.\n\nReplication is possible.\n\nThere is greater confidence the study has internal validity due to the systematic subject selection and equity of groups being compared.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nNot all relationships are causal! The possibility always exists that, by sheer coincidence, two unrelated events appear to be related [e.g., Punxatawney Phil could accurately predict the duration of Winter for five consecutive years but, the fact remains, he's just a big, furry rodent].\n\nConclusions about causal relationships are difficult to determine due to a variety of extraneous and confounding variables that exist in a social environment. This means causality can only be inferred, never proven.\n\nIf two variables are correlated, the cause must come before the effect. However, even though two variables might be causally related, it can sometimes be difficult to determine which variable comes first and, therefore, to establish which variable is the actual cause and which is the actual effect.\n\nBeach, Derek and Rasmus Brun Pedersen.

Research Methods Knowledge Base. 2006.\n\nDefinition and Purpose\n\nOften used in the medical sciences, but also found in the applied social sciences, a cohort study generally refers to a study conducted over a period of time involving members of a population which the subject or representative member comes from, and who are united by some commonality or similarity. Using a quantitative framework, a cohort study makes note of statistical occurrence within a specialized subgroup, united by same or similar characteristics that are relevant to the research problem being investigated, rather than studying statistical occurrence within the general population. Using a qualitative framework, cohort studies generally gather data using methods of observation. Cohorts can be either \"open\" or \"closed.\"\n\nOpen Cohort Studies [dynamic populations, such as the population of Los Angeles] involve a population that is defined just by the state of being a part of the study in question (and being monitored for the outcome). Date of entry and exit from the study is individually defined, therefore, the size of the study population is not constant. In open cohort studies, researchers can only calculate rate based data, such as, incidence rates and variants thereof.\n\nClosed Cohort Studies [static populations, such as patients entered into a clinical trial] involve participants who enter into the study at one defining point in time and where it is presumed that no new participants can enter the cohort. Given this, the number of study participants remains constant (or can only decrease).\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nThe use of cohorts is often mandatory because a randomized control study may be unethical. For example, you cannot deliberately expose people to asbestos, you can only study its effects on those who have already been exposed. Research that measures risk factors often relies upon cohort designs.\n\nBecause cohort studies measure potential causes before the outcome has occurred, they can demonstrate that these “causes” preceded the outcome, thereby avoiding the debate as to which is the cause and which is the effect.\n\nCohort analysis is highly flexible and can provide insight into effects over time and related to a variety of different types of changes [e.g., social, cultural, political, economic, etc.].\n\nEither original data or secondary data can be used in this design.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nIn cases where a comparative analysis of two cohorts is made [e.g., studying the effects of one group exposed to asbestos and one that has not], a researcher cannot control for all other factors that might differ between the two groups. These factors are known as confounding variables.\n\nCohort studies can end up taking a long time to complete if the researcher must wait for the conditions of interest to develop within the group. This also increases the chance that key variables change during the course of the study, potentially impacting the validity of the findings.\n\nDue to the lack of randominization in the cohort design, its external validity is lower than that of study designs where the researcher randomly assigns participants.\n\nHealy P, Devane D. “Methodological Considerations in Cohort Study Designs.” Nurse Researcher 18 (2011): 32-36; Glenn, Norval D, editor.

Wikipedia.\n\nDefinition and Purpose\n\nCross-sectional research designs have three distinctive features: no time dimension; a reliance on existing differences rather than change following intervention; and, groups are selected based on existing differences rather than random allocation. The cross-sectional design can only measure differences between or from among a variety of people, subjects, or phenomena rather than a process of change. As such, researchers using this design can only employ a relatively passive approach to making causal inferences based on findings.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nCross-sectional studies provide a clear 'snapshot' of the outcome and the characteristics associated with it, at a specific point in time.\n\nUnlike an experimental design, where there is an active intervention by the researcher to produce and measure change or to create differences, cross-sectional designs focus on studying and drawing inferences from existing differences between people, subjects, or phenomena.\n\nEntails collecting data at and concerning one point in time. While longitudinal studies involve taking multiple measures over an extended period of time, cross-sectional research is focused on finding relationships between variables at one moment in time.\n\nGroups identified for study are purposely selected based upon existing differences in the sample rather than seeking random sampling.\n\nCross-section studies are capable of using data from a large number of subjects and, unlike observational studies, is not geographically bound.\n\nCan estimate prevalence of an outcome of interest because the sample is usually taken from the whole population.\n\nBecause cross-sectional designs generally use survey techniques to gather data, they are relatively inexpensive and take up little time to conduct.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nFinding people, subjects, or phenomena to study that are very similar except in one specific variable can be difficult.\n\nResults are static and time bound and, therefore, give no indication of a sequence of events or reveal historical or temporal contexts.\n\nStudies cannot be utilized to establish cause and effect relationships.\n\nThis design only provides a snapshot of analysis so there is always the possibility that a study could have differing results if another time-frame had been chosen.\n\nThere is no follow up to the findings.\n\nBethlehem, Jelke. \"7: Cross-sectional Research.\" In Research Methodology in the Social, Behavioural and Life Sciences.

Wikipedia.\n\nDefinition and Purpose\n\nDescriptive research designs help provide answers to the questions of who, what, when, where, and how associated with a particular research problem; a descriptive study cannot conclusively ascertain answers to why. Descriptive research is used to obtain information concerning the current status of the phenomena and to describe \"what exists\" with respect to variables or conditions in a situation.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nThe subject is being observed in a completely natural and unchanged natural environment. True experiments, whilst giving analyzable data, often adversely influence the normal behavior of the subject [a.k.a., the Heisenberg effect whereby measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems].\n\nDescriptive research is often used as a pre-cursor to more quantitative research designs with the general overview giving some valuable pointers as to what variables are worth testing quantitatively.\n\nIf the limitations are understood, they can be a useful tool in developing a more focused study.\n\nDescriptive studies can yield rich data that lead to important recommendations in practice.\n\nAppoach collects a large amount of data for detailed analysis.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nThe results from a descriptive research cannot be used to discover a definitive answer or to disprove a hypothesis.\n\nBecause descriptive designs often utilize observational methods [as opposed to quantitative methods], the results cannot be replicated.\n\nThe descriptive function of research is heavily dependent on instrumentation for measurement and observation.\n\nAnastas, Jeane W.

London: Marion Boyars, 1985.\n\nDefinition and Purpose\n\nA blueprint of the procedure that enables the researcher to maintain control over all factors that may affect the result of an experiment. In doing this, the researcher attempts to determine or predict what may occur. Experimental research is often used where there is time priority in a causal relationship (cause precedes effect), there is consistency in a causal relationship (a cause will always lead to the same effect), and the magnitude of the correlation is great. The classic experimental design specifies an experimental group and a control group. The independent variable is administered to the experimental group and not to the control group, and both groups are measured on the same dependent variable. Subsequent experimental designs have used more groups and more measurements over longer periods. True experiments must have control, randomization, and manipulation.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nExperimental research allows the researcher to control the situation. In so doing, it allows researchers to answer the question, “What causes something to occur?”\n\nPermits the researcher to identify cause and effect relationships between variables and to distinguish placebo effects from treatment effects.\n\nExperimental research designs support the ability to limit alternative explanations and to infer direct causal relationships in the study.\n\nApproach provides the highest level of evidence for single studies.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nThe design is artificial, and results may not generalize well to the real world.\n\nThe artificial settings of experiments may alter the behaviors or responses of participants.\n\nExperimental designs can be costly if special equipment or facilities are needed.\n\nSome research problems cannot be studied using an experiment because of ethical or technical reasons.\n\nDifficult to apply ethnographic and other qualitative methods to experimentally designed studies.\n\nAnastas, Jeane W.

Slideshare presentation.\n\nDefinition and Purpose\n\nAn exploratory design is conducted about a research problem when there are few or no earlier studies to refer to or rely upon to predict an outcome. The focus is on gaining insights and familiarity for later investigation or undertaken when research problems are in a preliminary stage of investigation. Exploratory designs are often used to establish an understanding of how best to proceed in studying an issue or what methodology would effectively apply to gathering information about the issue.\n\nThe goals of exploratory research are intended to produce the following possible insights:\n\nFamiliarity with basic details, settings, and concerns.\n\nWell grounded picture of the situation being developed.\n\nGeneration of new ideas and assumptions.\n\nDevelopment of tentative theories or hypotheses.\n\nDetermination about whether a study is feasible in the future.\n\nIssues get refined for more systematic investigation and formulation of new research questions.\n\nDirection for future research and techniques get developed.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nDesign is a useful approach for gaining background information on a particular topic.\n\nExploratory research is flexible and can address research questions of all types (what, why, how).\n\nProvides an opportunity to define new terms and clarify existing concepts.\n\nExploratory research is often used to generate formal hypotheses and develop more precise research problems.\n\nIn the policy arena or applied to practice, exploratory studies help establish research priorities and where resources should be allocated.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nExploratory research generally utilizes small sample sizes and, thus, findings are typically not generalizable to the population at large.\n\nThe exploratory nature of the research inhibits an ability to make definitive conclusions about the findings. They provide insight but not definitive conclusions.\n\nThe research process underpinning exploratory studies is flexible but often unstructured, leading to only tentative results that have limited value to decision-makers.\n\nDesign lacks rigorous standards applied to methods of data gathering and analysis because one of the areas for exploration could be to determine what method or methodologies could best fit the research problem.\n\nCuthill, Michael. “Exploratory Research: Citizen Participation, Local Government, and Sustainable Development in Australia.” Sustainable Development 10 (2002): 79-89; Streb, Christoph K. \"Exploratory Case Study.\" In Encyclopedia of Case Study Research.

Wikipedia.\n\nDefinition and Purpose\n\nSometimes referred to as ethnography or participant observation, designs around field research encompass a variety of interpretative procedures [e.g., observation and interviews] rooted in qualitative approaches to studying people individually or in groups while inhabiting their natural environment as opposed to using survey instruments or other forms of impersonal methods of data gathering. Information acquired from observational research takes the form of “field notes” that involves documenting what the researcher actually sees and hears while in the field. Findings do not consist of conclusive statements derived from numbers and statistics because field research involves analysis of words and observations of behavior. Conclusions, therefore, are developed from an interpretation of findings that reveal overriding themes, concepts, and ideas. More information can be found HERE.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nField research is often necessary to fill gaps in understanding the research problem applied to local conditions or to specific groups of people that cannot be ascertained from existing data.\n\nThe research helps contextualize already known information about a research problem, thereby facilitating ways to assess the origins, scope, and scale of a problem and to gage the causes, consequences, and means to resolve an issue based on deliberate interaction with people in their natural inhabited spaces.\n\nEnables the researcher to corroborate or confirm data by gathering additional information that supports or refutes findings reported in prior studies of the topic.\n\nBecause the researcher in embedded in the field, they are better able to make observations or ask questions that reflect the specific cultural context of the setting being investigated.\n\nObserving the local reality offers the opportunity to gain new perspectives or obtain unique data that challenges existing theoretical propositions or long-standing assumptions found in the literature.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you\n\nA field research study requires extensive time and resources to carry out the multiple steps involved with preparing for the gathering of information, including for example, examining background information about the study site, obtaining permission to access the study site, and building trust and rapport with subjects.\n\nRequires a commitment to staying engaged in the field to ensure that you can adequately document events and behaviors as they unfold.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of fieldwork means that researchers can never fully control the process of data gathering. They must maintain a flexible approach to studying the setting because events and circumstances can change quickly or unexpectedly.\n\nFindings can be difficult to interpret and verify without access to documents and other source materials that help to enhance the credibility of information obtained from the field [i.e., the act of triangulating the data].\n\nLinking the research problem to the selection of study participants inhabiting their natural environment is critical. However, this specificity limits the ability to generalize findings to different situations or in other contexts or to infer courses of action applied to other settings or groups of people.\n\nThe reporting of findings must take into account how the researcher themselves may have inadvertently affected respondents and their behaviors.\n\nBailey, Carol R. and Carol A.

For example, with longitudinal surveys, the same group of people is interviewed at regular intervals, enabling researchers to track changes over time and to relate them to variables that might explain why the changes occur. Longitudinal research designs describe patterns of change and help establish the direction and magnitude of causal relationships. Measurements are taken on each variable over two or more distinct time periods. This allows the researcher to measure change in variables over time. It is a type of observational study sometimes referred to as a panel study.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nLongitudinal data facilitate the analysis of the duration of a particular phenomenon.\n\nEnables survey researchers to get close to the kinds of causal explanations usually attainable only with experiments.\n\nThe design permits the measurement of differences or change in a variable from one period to another [i.e., the description of patterns of change over time].\n\nLongitudinal studies facilitate the prediction of future outcomes based upon earlier factors.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nThe data collection method may change over time.\n\nMaintaining the integrity of the original sample can be difficult over an extended period of time.\n\nIt can be difficult to show more than one variable at a time.\n\nThis design often needs qualitative research data to explain fluctuations in the results.\n\nA longitudinal research design assumes present trends will continue unchanged.\n\nIt can take a long period of time to gather results.\n\nThere is a need to have a large sample size and accurate sampling to reach representativness.\n\nAnastas, Jeane W.

The purpose is to not simply summarize existing knowledge, but to develop a new understanding of a research problem using synoptic reasoning. The main objectives of meta-analysis include analyzing differences in the results among studies and increasing the precision by which effects are estimated. A well-designed meta-analysis depends upon strict adherence to the criteria used for selecting studies and the availability of information in each study to properly analyze their findings. Lack of information can severely limit the type of analyzes and conclusions that can be reached. In addition, the more dissimilarity there is in the results among individual studies [heterogeneity], the more difficult it is to justify interpretations that govern a valid synopsis of results.\n\nA meta-analysis needs to fulfill the following requirements to ensure the validity of your findings:\n\nClearly defined description of objectives, including precise definitions of the variables and outcomes that are being evaluated;\n\nA well-reasoned and well-documented justification for identification and selection of the studies;\n\nAssessment and explicit acknowledgment of any researcher bias in the identification and selection of those studies;\n\nDescription and evaluation of the degree of heterogeneity among the sample size of studies reviewed; and,\n\nJustification of the techniques used to evaluate the studies.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nCan be an effective strategy for determining gaps in the literature.\n\nProvides a means of reviewing research published about a particular topic over an extended period of time and from a variety of sources.\n\nIs useful in clarifying what policy or programmatic actions can be justified on the basis of analyzing research results from multiple studies.\n\nProvides a method for overcoming small sample sizes in individual studies that previously may have had little relationship to each other.\n\nCan be used to generate new hypotheses or highlight research problems for future studies.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nSmall violations in defining the criteria used for content analysis can lead to difficult to interpret and/or meaningless findings.\n\nA large sample size can yield reliable, but not necessarily valid, results.\n\nA lack of uniformity regarding, for example, the type of literature reviewed, how methods are applied, and how findings are measured within the sample of studies you are analyzing, can make the process of synthesis difficult to perform.\n\nDepending on the sample size, the process of reviewing and synthesizing multiple studies can be very time consuming.\n\nBeck, Lewis W. \"The Synoptic Method.\" The Journal of Philosophy 36 (1939): 337-345; Cooper, Harris, Larry V.

This approach uses the tools of argumentation derived from philosophical traditions, concepts, models, and theories to critically explore and challenge, for example, the relevance of logic and evidence in academic debates, to analyze arguments about fundamental issues, or to discuss the root of existing discourse about a research problem. These overarching tools of analysis can be framed in three ways:\n\nOntology -- the study that describes the nature of reality; for example, what is real and what is not, what is fundamental and what is derivative?\n\nEpistemology -- the study that explores the nature of knowledge; for example, by what means does knowledge and understanding depend upon and how can we be certain of what we know?\n\nAxiology -- the study of values; for example, what values does an individual or group hold and why? How are values related to interest, desire, will, experience, and means-to-end? And, what is the difference between a matter of fact and a matter of value?\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nCan provide a basis for applying ethical decision-making to practice.\n\nFunctions as a means of gaining greater self-understanding and self-knowledge about the purposes of research.\n\nBrings clarity to general guiding practices and principles of an individual or group.\n\nPhilosophy informs methodology.\n\nRefine concepts and theories that are invoked in relatively unreflective modes of thought and discourse.\n\nBeyond methodology, philosophy also informs critical thinking about epistemology and the structure of reality (metaphysics).\n\nOffers clarity and definition to the practical and theoretical uses of terms, concepts, and ideas.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nLimited application to specific research problems [answering the \"So What?\" question in social science research].\n\nAnalysis can be abstract, argumentative, and limited in its practical application to real-life issues.\n\nWhile a philosophical analysis may render problematic that which was once simple or taken-for-granted, the writing can be dense and subject to unnecessary jargon, overstatement, and/or excessive quotation and documentation.\n\nThere are limitations in the use of metaphor as a vehicle of philosophical analysis.\n\nThere can be analytical difficulties in moving from philosophy to advocacy and between abstract thought and application to the phenomenal world.\n\nBurton, Dawn. \"Part I, Philosophy of the Social Sciences.\" In Research Training for Social Scientists.

The design involves selecting and critically evaluating the contributions of each identified study, analyzing and carefully synthesizing the data, and reporting the evidence in a way that facilitates clear conclusions about what is and is not known. A systematic review is not a traditional literature review, but a self-contained research project that explores a clearly defined research problem using existing studies. The design of a systematic review differs from other review methods because distinct and exacting principles are applied to the evaluative process of analyzing existing literature.\n\nNOTE: A thorough and well-designed systematic review requires extensive and on-going consultation with a librarian to ensure that all published and unpublished studies concerning the research problem have been located and evaluated as to whether they should be included in your analysis. Due to the required time commitment and workload, these types of reviews are often conducted as a group project.\n\nWhat do these studies tell you?\n\nA systematic review synthesizes the findings of multiple studies related to each other by incorporating strategies of analysis and interpretation intended to reduce biases and random errors.\n\nThe application of critical exploration, evaluation, and synthesis methods separates insignificant, unsound, or redundant research from the most salient and relevant studies worthy of reflection.\n\nThey can be use to identify, justify, and refine hypotheses, recognize and avoid hidden problems in prior studies, and explain data inconsistencies and conflicts in data.\n\nSystematic reviews can be used to help policy makers formulate evidence-based guidelines and regulations.\n\nThe use of strict, explicit, and pre-determined methods of synthesis, when applied appropriately, provide reliable estimates about the effects of interventions, evaluations, and effects related to the overarching research problem investigated by each study under review.\n\nSystematic reviews illuminate where knowledge or thorough understanding of a research problem is lacking and, therefore, can then be used to guide future research.\n\nThe accepted inclusion of unpublished studies [i.e., grey literature] ensures the broadest possible way to analyze and interpret research on a topic.\n\nResults of the synthesis can be generalized and the findings extrapolated into the general population with more validity than most other types of studies.\n\nWhat these studies don't tell you?\n\nSystematic reviews do not create new knowledge per se; they are a method for synthesizing existing studies about a research problem in order to gain new insights and determine gaps in the literature.\n\nThe way researchers have carried out their investigations [e.g., the period of time covered, number of participants, sources of data analyzed, etc.] can make it difficult to effectively synthesize studies.\n\nThe inclusion of unpublished studies can introduce bias into the review because they may not have undergone a rigorous peer-review process prior to publication. Examples may include conference presentations or proceedings, publications from government agencies, white papers, working papers, and internal documents from organizations, and doctoral dissertations and Master's theses.\n\nDenyer, David and David Tranfield. \"Producing a Systematic Review.\" In The Sage Handbook of Organizational Research Methods.
