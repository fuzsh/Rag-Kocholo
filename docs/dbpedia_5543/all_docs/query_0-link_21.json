I. HISTORY, FUNCTION, AND ORGANIZATION OF THE COMMITTEE ON RULES A. Introduction In the 111th Congress, the Committee on Rules retained its traditional structure and purpose in the House of Representatives. Its size and super-majority party ratio remained the same as in previous Congresses, under both Democratic and Republican control. Its central function continued to be setting the conditions under which major legislation is considered on the House floor, particularly regarding the terms of debate and the process for consideration of amendments. Underscoring this role, scholars of Congress and Members have described the Rules Committee as a ``traffic cop,'' ``gatekeeper,'' and ``the Speaker's Committee.'' All of these terms highlight the critical role the Committee plays in the conduct of legislative business in the House. While the primary responsibility of the Committee is to be the scheduling arm of the majority leadership, it also exercises ``original jurisdiction'' over the rules of the House, joint rules of the House and Senate, the order of business in the House, and the budget process. Although the principal purpose of this report is to summarize the activities of the Rules Committee in the 111th Congress, its secondary purpose is to view these activities in the context of the evolution of the Committee and the House of Representatives since the First Congress in 1789. B. History and Function The Rules Committee has a long and storied history. The House established the first Rules Committee as a select committee on the second day of the First Congress, April 2, 1789, pursuant to the mandate in Article I, section 5, clause 2, of the Constitution that ``[e]ach House may determine the rules of its proceedings.'' The House order creating the Committee stated that a committee be appointed ``to prepare and report such standing rules and orders of proceedings as may be proper to be observed in the House.'' Since the moment of its inception, the Committee has followed these mandates. From the beginning, the members serving on the Rules Committee included not only some of the most prominent members of the House but also many distinguished Founders of the nation. Among others, the first eleven Members on the Committee included: (1) Mr. James Madison of Virginia, the ``Father of the Constitution'' and future President of the United States; (2) Mr. Roger Sherman of Connecticut, the only one of the Founding Fathers to help prepare and sign all four of the most important documents of the early nation, namely the Articles of Association, the Articles of Confederation, the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution; (3) Mr. Elias Boudinot of New Jersey, President of the Continental Congress from November 1782 to November 1783; and (4) Mr. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, a future Vice President of the United States and a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. Five days after its appointment, the first Select Committee on Rules began exercising its responsibilities. It reported four rules on: (1) the duties of the Speaker, (2) decorum and debate, (3) the disposition of bills, and (4) the operations of the Committee of the Whole. Six days later, on April 13, 1789 the Select Committee reported an additional eight rules dealing with such matters as the service of Members on committees, Members' attendance during floor proceedings, the creation of a standing Committee on Elections, the duties of the Clerk, and the duties of the Sergeant-at-Arms. With the adoption by the House of these rules, the Select Committee was dissolved. During the first 90 years of the House, this pattern continued. At the beginning of each congress, the House would establish a Select Committee on Rules, the Select Committee would report any recommended revisions in the standing rules from those of the previous Congress, and then it would dissolve. In some Congresses, the House did not appoint a Select Committee on Rules and instead operated under the rules adopted in the preceding congress. The status of the Select Committee changed over the next several decades. Although the House in its early years relied primarily on select committees to draft legislation, by the mid-nineteenth century the House established thirty-four standing committees that would take over such responsibilities. In 1880, the House ultimately converted the Rules Committee into a permanent standing committee chaired by the Speaker of the House. It was this Speaker-Chairman position, combined with the newly-emerging role of the Committee to report rules managing consideration of legislation on the floor, that cemented the Committee's place in political history. In 1883, the modern Rules Committee began to emerge when the House upheld the right of the Committee to issue ``special orders of business'' or ``special rules'' providing for the consideration of legislation from other committees. By 1890, this new role had become the exclusive prerogative of the Rules Committee. Special rules, which were and are House resolutions reported from the Rules Committee, were important because they required only a majority vote of the House to provide for the consideration of bills out of the order in which they appeared on the floor Calendar. This is notable because, until the use of special rules, a two-thirds vote was required to suspend the general rule and consider a bill out of order. In short, a majority now could do what before required a super-majority. Special rules gained importance because they gave the House flexibility in its legislative agenda, which in turn, allowed for House leadership to respond to changing judgments about the nation's needs at any given time. Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine was the individual most responsible for recognizing and utilizing the full potential of the combined powers of Speaker and Rules Committee Chairman; this is because he served in those two roles from 1889 to 1891 and then again from l895 to 1899. Not only did he use his authority as Speaker to make rulings from the Chair that outlawed certain obstructionist tactics on the House floor; he also proceeded to codify these rulings, known as ``Reed's Rules,'' in the standing rules of the House through his capacity as Rules Committee Chairman. Speaker Reed also made regular use of the Rules Committee to report special rules that enabled him to schedule bills he wanted on the floor when he wished, and under his terms of debate and amendment. This powerful Speaker-Chairman position ended in 1910 in a revolt against Speaker Joseph Cannon of Illinois. Speaker Cannon had served as Speaker and Rules Committee Chairman since 1903. Disaffected by Speaker Cannon's autocratic rule, a group of Republican insurgents joined with the Democratic minority to bypass the Rules Committee and directly amend House Rules from the floor. The group amended the Rules to strip the Speaker of his chairmanship and membership on the Rules Committee, as well as his power to appoint Members to the Committee. They also voted to enlarge the Committee from five to ten members elected by the House. The following year, a new Democratic majority completed the revolution by taking away the Speaker's power to appoint members to all of the other committees of the House. Since then, the House has elected all members to standing committees. This revolt had far-reaching and long-lasting consequences. While the Rules Committee continued to serve as the scheduling arm of the House leadership, it developed a more independent streak around the time of the New Deal, when many Rules Committee members were opposed to the policies of President Roosevelt. Between the years of 1937 and 1961, the Committee was dominated by a conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans who sometimes would refuse to report rules on bills that the majority leadership wanted on the floor, or they would report such rules only under their own terms and timing. In 1961, Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas and President John F. Kennedy led a successful effort to enlarge the membership of the Committee, from 12 to 15 Members, however this did not produce the desired effect. It was not until the mid-1970s, with a large influx of new Democratic members, that the Rules Committee was fully restored as an arm of the majority leadership. The reform movement of the mid-1970s also produced further decentralization in the House with the emergence of more independent Members and the proliferation of semi-autonomous subcommittees. This decentralization soon led to pressures to give the majority leadership, in particular the Speaker acting through the Rules Committee, more authority to direct the business of the House. In 1975, with a Democratic majority in the House, Democratic Caucus rules, which govern how the Democratic members will carry out their roles, gave the Democratic Speaker the authority to appoint all Rules Committee Democrats, subject to Caucus ratification. In 1989, with a Republican minority in the House, the Republican Conference, which governs how Republican members exercise their duties, gave the Minority Leader the same authority to appoint Republican members to the Rules Committee. Today, the slates of appointees recommended by the majority and minority leaders are still subject to approval by the whole House in the form of a House resolution. In the 111th Congress, the Democratic Members were appointed to the Rules Committee through the adoption of H. Res. 8 and H. Res. 51. The Republican Members of the Committee were appointed through the adoption of H. Res. 12, H. Res. 38, and H. Res. 59. While the most high-profile role of the Rules Committee is to direct legislative traffic to the House floor, the Committee is also responsible for other important business. For instance, as part of its gate-keeping work, the Committee must help resolve jurisdictional disputes between other standing committees. As is often the case, committees will report legislation with amendments that impact the jurisdiction of other committees. When legislation with such cross- jurisdictional language comes to the Committee, the Rules Committee must ensure that disputes are worked out so that legislation can reach the floor without controversy between House committees. Finally, with the aid of the Office of the Parliamentarian, the Committee plays a role in ensuring compliance with the House Rules. Authorizing and appropriating committees often seek guidance in how to conduct their oversight and legislative responsibilities in accordance with the Rules. When questions arise regarding the propriety of certain courses of action, they turn to the Rules Committee or the Parliamentarian for the answer. Overall, and notwithstanding changes in majority control, the Rules Committee continues its role of facilitating the deliberation and amending of legislation in the House. C. Committee Organization During the 111th Congress At the beginning of the 94th Congress, the Committee membership was increased from fifteen Members (ten Democrats and five Republicans) to sixteen Members (eleven Democrats and five Republicans). This ratio remained until the 98th Congress, when the membership was reduced to thirteen Members (nine Democrats and four Republicans). The membership has remained at thirteen, through the 111th Congress. The ratio of majority party Members to minority party Members also has remained the same. However, in the 104th through the 109th Congresses, Republicans were in the majority and Democrats were in the minority. During the 110th and 111th Congresses, Democrats were in the majority. Nine of the thirteen Members of the Rules Committee in the 111th Congress served on the Committee during the previous Congress. The returning Democratic Representatives were Louise McIntosh Slaughter of New York, James McGovern of Massachusetts, Alcee Hastings of Florida, Doris Matsui of California, Dennis Cardoza of California, and Michael Arcuri of New York. The new Democratic Representatives on the Committee for the 111th Congress were Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, Chellie Pingree of Maine, and Jared Polis of Colorado. The returning Republican Representatives were David Dreier of California, Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida, and Pete Sessions of Texas. The new Republican Representative on the Committee for the 111th Congress was Virginia Foxx of North Carolina. The Committee held its organizational meeting on January 7, 2009. Chairwoman Louise Slaughter of New York opened the meeting and welcomed all of the committee Members. Chairwoman Slaughter announced that the proposed Rules Committee rules would be considered as read and open for amendment at any point. She explained that the proposal called for the adoption of the Committee's rules for the previous Congress with no modifications. Mr. McGovern offered a motion that the Rules Committee adopt the proposed Committee rules for the 111th Congress. No amendments were offered to the Committee rules. Mr. McGovern's motion to adopt the Committee rules was agreed to by a voice vote. By unanimous consent, the Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House and the Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process continued to be composed of five majority and two minority Members, identical to the ratio used in recent Congresses. At a later meeting, Chairwoman Slaughter appointed Mr. McGovern as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House, and Mr. Hastings of Florida as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process. Chairwoman Slaughter and Ranking Member Dreier appointed the majority and minority Members of the two subcommittees as follows: Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House: Mr. McGovern (Chairman), Ms. Matsui, Mr. Arcuri, Mr. Perlmutter, Ms. Slaughter, Mr. Sessions, and Ms. Foxx. Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process: Mr. Hastings of Florida (Chairman), Mr. Cardoza, Ms. Pingree, Mr. Polis, Ms. Slaughter, Mr. Diaz-Balart, Mr. Dreier. On February 3, 2009, the Rules Committee adopted by voice vote the Committee oversight plan for the 111th Congress. On February 3 Chairwoman Slaughter also submitted the Committee's budget to the Committee on House Administration. D. Rules Committee on the Internet In the 111th Congress, the Committee on Rules Majority website (www.rules.house.gov) continued to provide up-to-the- minute information on all legislation considered on the House Floor under a rule from the Committee. The website offered substantial resources regarding the operations of Congress such as the Rules of the House and all House committees, the House Practice Manual, Precedents of the House, Congressional Research Service reports, detailed information on the budget process, and information on Senate procedure. The website also provided resources related to the daily activities of the Rules Committee. Bills, amendments, committee reports, amendments between the House and Senate, and conference reports were regularly posted to the site as soon as they became available. Often, the Rules Committee website was the only source for such vital information. The usefulness of the site for providing the most current legislative developments is shown by an average daily usage of 21,226 page views in the 111th Congress, with a total of 15,516,836 pages viewed. Of all of the information on the website, legislative text received the most user requests. The website provided the Committee's schedule and announcements, text of all special rules reported, a membership list, the opening day rules package and other publications including a history of the Rules Committee. The site also facilitated the amendment process by providing the necessary forms and instructions for proper amendment filing and gave Members and staff the ability to submit amendments electronically. In keeping with tradition, the Rules Committee website remained a non-partisan tool for legislative research and information on Rules Committee process. With minor revisions from the overhaul of the previous Congress, the Legislative Process and Procedure program section of the website continued to be a valued resource for those interested in learning about House and Senate procedure.

Any such change in the rules of the Committee shall be published in the Congressional Record within 30 calendar days after their approval. II. HOUSE RULES CHANGES ADOPTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 111TH CONGRESS A. Introduction The rules for the One Hundred Eleventh Congress were called up by the Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and adopted on January 6, 2009. The Rules Committee has always played a major role in the changes to the House rules in the beginning of each new Congress pursuant to House Resolution 5. In the beginning of the 111th Congress the following reforms to the House Rules were made in the opening day rules package contained in House Resolution 5 (virtually all changes that are within the jurisdiction and oversight responsibilities of the Rules Committee): B. Summary of Substantive Rules Changes Contained in H. Res. 5, Adopting House Rules for the 111th Congress SEC. 2. CHANGES TO THE STANDING RULES (a) Inspector General Audits.-- In response to the recommendation of the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on House Administration, this provision amends clause 6(c)(1) of rule II to clarify the non-traditional audit work that the Inspector General does in the areas of business process improvements, services to enhance the efficiency of House support operations, and risk management assessments. The change also will allow the Inspector General to implement guidance and standards published in the Government Accountability Office's Government Auditing Standards. (b) Homeland Security.-- This provision amends clause 3(g) of rule X to direct the Committee on Homeland Security to review and study on a primary and continuing basis all Government activities, programs, and organizations relating to homeland security within its primary legislative jurisdiction. Nothing in this rule shall affect the oversight or legislative authority of other committees under the Rules of the House. The change in clause 3 of rule X clarifies the Committee on Homeland Security's oversight jurisdiction over government activities relating to homeland security within its primary legislative jurisdiction, including the interaction of all departments and agencies with the Department of Homeland Security. Consistent with the designation of the Committee on Homeland Security as the committee of oversight in these vital areas, the House expects that the President and the relevant executive agencies will forward copies of all reports in this area, in addition to those already covered by clause 2(b) of rule XIV, to the Committee on Homeland Security to assist it in carrying out this important responsibility. This change is meant to clarify that the various agencies have a reporting relationship with the Homeland Security Committee on matters within its jurisdiction in addition to the agencies' reporting relationships with other committees of jurisdiction. (c) Additional Functions of the Committee on House Administration.-- This provision amends clause 4(d) of rule X to give the Committee on House Administration oversight of the management of services provided to the House by the Architect of the Capitol, except those services that lie within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure under clause 1(r). (d) Terms of Committee Chairmen.-- This provision strikes clause 5(c)(2) of rule X to eliminate term limits for committee and subcommittee chairs and includes a conforming amendment to clause 5(a)(2)(C) of rule X to provide an exception to the Budget Committee tenure limitations for a chair or ranking minority member serving a second consecutive term in the respective position. (e) Calendar Wednesday.-- This provision amends clause 6 of rule XV to require the Clerk to read only those committees where the committee chair has given notice to the House on Tuesday that he or she will seek recognition to call up a bill under the Calendar Wednesday rule. This will replace the requirement that the Clerk read the list of all committees, regardless of whether a committee intends to utilize the rule. The provision makes conforming changes to clause 6 of rule XV and clause 6 of rule XIII, including the deletion of the requirement of a two-thirds vote to dispense with the proceedings under Calendar Wednesday. (f) Postponement Authority.-- This provision adds a new paragraph (c) to clause 1 of rule XIX to give permanent authority to the Chair to postpone further consideration of legislation prior to final passage when the previous question is operating to adoption or passage of a measure pursuant to a special order of business. This codified a practice that had become routine during the 110th Congress. (g) Instructions in the Motion to Recommit.-- This provision amends clause 2(b) of rule XIX to provide that a motion to recommit a bill or joint resolution may include instructions only in the form of a direction to report a textual amendment or amendments back to the House forthwith. The provision makes no change to the straight motion to recommit. (h) Conduct of Votes.-- In response to the bipartisan recommendation of the Select Committee to Investigate the Voting Irregularities of August 2, 2007, this provision deletes the following sentence in clause 2(a) of rule XX: ``A record vote by electronic device shall not be held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome of such vote.'' (i) General Appropriation Conference Reports.-- This provision codifies House Resolution 491, 110th Congress, which was adopted by unanimous consent. The provision provides a point of order against any general appropriations conference report containing earmarks that are included in conference reports but not committed to conference by either House and not in a House or Senate committee report on the legislation. A point of order under the provision would be disposed of by the question of consideration, which would be debatable for 20 minutes equally divided. (j) PAYGO.-- This provision amends clause 10 of rule XXI to make the following changes: (1) A technical amendment to align the PAYGO rules of the House with those of the Senate so that both houses use the same CBO baselines; (2) The changes would also allow one House-passed measure to pay for spending in a separate House-passed measure if the two are linked at the engrossment stage; and (3) The changes would also allow for emergency exceptions to PAYGO for provisions designated as emergency spending in a bill, joint resolution, amendment made in order as original text, conference report, or amendment between the Houses (but not other amendments). The new clause 10(c)(3) of rule XXI provides that the Chair will put the question of consideration on a bill, joint resolution, an amendment made in order as original text by a special order of business, a conference report, or an amendment between the Houses that includes an emergency PAYGO designation. The Chair will put the question of consideration on such a measure without regard to a waiver of points of order under clause 10 of rule XXI or language providing for immediate consideration of such a measure. The intent of this exception to pay-as-you-go principles is to allow for consideration of measures that respond to emergency situations. Provisions of legislation may receive an emergency designation if such provisions are necessary to respond to an act of war, an act of terrorism, a natural disaster, or a period of sustained low economic growth. A measure that includes any provision designated as emergency shall be accompanied by a report or a joint statement of managers, as the case may be, or include an applicable ``Findings'' section in the legislation, stating the reasons why such provision meets the emergency requirement according to the following criteria. In general, the criteria to be considered in determining whether a proposed expenditure or tax change meets an emergency designation include: (1) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely useful or beneficial); (2) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; (3) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action; (4) unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and (5) not permanent, but rather temporary in nature. With respect to the fourth criterion above, an emergency that is part of an aggregate level of anticipated emergencies, particularly when normally estimated in advance, is not ``unforeseen.'' (k) Disclosure by Members of Employment Negotiations.-- This provision amends clause 1 of rule XXVII to close the loophole in the rule that allowed lame-duck Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner to directly negotiate future employment or compensation without public disclosure. The rule will now apply to all current Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner requiring them, within 3 business days after the commencement of such negotiation or agreement of future employment or compensation, to file with the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct a statement regarding such negotiations or agreement. (l) Gender Neutrality.-- This provision amends the Rules of the House to render them neutral with respect to gender. These changes are not intended to effect any substantive changes. III. COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT PLAN Pursuant to clause 2(d)(1) of House rule X, the Committee on Rules met in public session on February 3, 2009, and adopted by voice vote, an oversight plan for the 111th Congress for submission to the Committee on House Administration and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in accordance with the rule. As required by clause 1(d)(3) of rule XI, the following is a summary of that plan. Rule X of the Rules of the House vests in the Committee on Rules broad responsibility over the House rules in general and the congressional budget process. Specifically the rule defines in clause 1(n) of rule X; (1) Rules and joint rules (other than those relating to the Code of Official Conduct) and the order of business of the House, and (2) Recesses and final adjournments of Congress. The House rules also grant special oversight responsibility to the Rules Committee in clause 3(j) of rule X over the congressional budget process. It provides that the Committee on Rules shall review and study on a continuing basis the congressional budget process, and the committee shall report its findings and recommendations to the House periodically. The Committee has worked with the Budget Committee both formally and informally during the 111th Congress on oversight activities regarding the Congressional budget process. Specifically the Rules Committee brought to the House Floor legislation that provided for statutory pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) budget enforcement. On opening day of the 110th Congress, the House of Representatives began its commitment to responsible spending through the implementation of clause 10 of rule XXI, which precludes any direct spending or revenues from increasing the deficit (or reducing the surplus). In the 111th Congress, the Rules Committee was involved in efforts to expand the PAYGO rule even further by giving it the force of law. The House then adopted H.R. 2920, the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009. That legislation passed the House on July 22, 2009 and was later included in H. J. Res. 45, the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, and signed into law by the President on January 12, 2010. The Rules Committee also reported H. Res. 1493 which provided for budget enforcement for FY2011 and also modified clause 10 of rule XXI to make it compatible with the newly enacted statutory PAYGO law. In addition to the jurisdictional areas contained in the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Rules Committee has always played a major role in the changes to the House rules in the beginning of each new Congress pursuant to House Resolution 5. In the beginning of the 111th Congress a number of reforms to the House Rules were made in the opening day rules package contained in House Resolution 5. Virtually all of those changes were within the jurisdiction and oversight responsibilities of the Rules Committee. Because of its key role and involvement in advancing the ambitious agenda of the Democratic House and the new Administration, time constraints prevented the committee from playing a more active and formal role in its oversight activities. However, as in the 110th Congress, the committee staff continued to maintain constant monitoring of those areas within the oversight responsibilities of the Rules Committee and remained involved with the Leadership on several original jurisdiction measures that were brought to the House Floor by the Committee. This included an original jurisdiction measure reported from Rules on May 19, 2010 and passed by the House on May 20, 2010 which granted special, temporary deposition authority provided under clause 4(c)(3) of rule X to the Committee on Education and Labor for purposes of its investigation into underground coal mining safety. IV. COMMITTEE JURISDICTION AND ACTIVITIES A. Introduction The jurisdictional mandate of the Committee on Rules is set forth in clause 1(n) of Rule X as follows: (n) Committee on Rules-- (1) Rules and joint rules (other than those relating to the Code of Official Conduct) and the order of business of the House. (2) Recesses and final adjournments of Congress. The special oversight function of the Committee is outlined in clause 3(j) of Rule X as follows: (j) The Committee on Rules shall review and study on a continuing basis the congressional budget process, and the committee shall report its findings and recommendations to the House from time to time. The jurisdictional mandate of the Committee for the purposes of this Survey of Activities is broken down into two subcategories: original jurisdiction matters and special rules (or order of business resolutions). In practice, these subgroups are intertwined in a manner that greatly affects the way in which the House conducts its business. Original jurisdiction matters include all measures pertaining to the rules of the House, the budget process and joint rules. These measures are either referred directly to the Committee by the Speaker or originate in the Committee itself. They not only pertain to changes in House procedures, but also cover the Committee's power to establish select committees, authorize certain investigations, provide enforcement procedures for the budget process, and to establish Congressional procedures for considering certain executive branch proposals. The Committee held four hearings and markups on matters of original jurisdiction during the 111th Congress. The measures were reported to the House for consideration, and subsequently adopted by the House. The other subgroup of the Committee's jurisdictional mandate, referred to as order of business resolutions or `special rules,' is used by the Committee to direct the manner in which a bill or resolution will be considered by the House. `Special rules,' in the form of House resolutions, tailor the time allotted for debate and the process by which a bill can be amended. This is done to allow the House to consider the subject matter in a way which best suits the bill's individual issues and/or controversies. These `rules' also may contain waivers of specific House rules or provisions in the Congressional Budget Act. It is sometimes necessary to waive the rules of the House in order to allow the House to consider all the facets of the particular issue or to facilitate the House resolving its differences with the Senate. Special rules also allow the House to consider measures according to the majority leadership's legislative scheduling priorities rather than the numerical order in which they were reported. During the 111th Congress, the Committee received 165 written requests received from Committee chairs seeking rules. In addition, there was one formal request ultimately disposed of by procedures other than the Rules Committee (such as unanimous consent or suspension), and no formal requests were pending at the end of the Congress. These formal requests do not reflect additional requests of an emergency nature made in person by the chairs of the various legislative committees. The Committee granted 165 rules: 109 rules provided for consideration of bills and resolutions, 38 dealt with conference reports or consideration of Senate amendments, and 42 rules provided for consideration of measures but stopped short of the amending process (e.g., providing for debate only, creating suspension days for considering specific measures, or waiving the two-thirds requirement to bring up a rule for a certain measure on the same day the rule is reported from the Committee on Rules). The Committee granted 1 modified open rule, 73 structured rules, and 35 closed rules. The Committee granted no waivers of specific sections of the Budget Act. The Committee granted 77 rules waiving all points of order to permit consideration of either the underlying measure or matter made in order as original text, motions, or against the amendments made in order. In summary, the Committee on Rules reported 165 rules. Of these the House adopted 156, rejected none, and tabled 9. No rules remained pending on the House Calendar when Congress adjourned in December of 2010. In addition, the Committee on Rules reported four original jurisdiction measures, which were ultimately adopted by the House and did not remain pending on the Union Calendar at the end of the 111th Congress. B. Special Orders or Rules 1. RULE REQUESTS The process of considering requests for special orders or ``rules'' usually begins when the Committee on Rules receives a letter from a legislative committee chairman requesting that it hold a hearing and recommend a rule for that particular measure. The letter is signed by the full committee chairman and most often makes a specific request for the type of rule desired by the legislative committee. In some cases, the emergency nature of the legislation does not allow adequate time for a formal request to be registered. In these cases, the requests are made in person by the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction. Once a hearing has been scheduled, the Committee on Rules allows any House Member who has an interest in testifying to do so. Under normal circumstances and pursuant to Committee rules, printed copies of the legislation and accompanying committee report or conference report are provided to the Committee Members at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting on the rule request for the legislation. The Committee gives written notice to its Members and notifies the pertinent committee of the scheduled hearing date at least 48 hours prior to the commencement of the hearing, unless an emergency situation exists. 2. HEARINGS The Rules Committee chairman controls the order in which witnesses appear and also initiates the questioning. Typically, the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction or a designee requesting the rule makes a short statement, followed by the ranking minority member. Sometimes the subcommittee chair and ranking minority member appear on behalf of their full committee counterparts on the rule request. It is often the case that Members wishing to testify in favor of or in opposition to a bill, amendment, or type of procedure may do so as part of a panel of witnesses. In many cases, the components of the proposed special order form the basis for the dialogue between substantive committee leaders asking for the rule and the Rules Committee Members. More often than not, the questioning escalates into discussions about the merits of the bill itself. If the legislation is particularly wide-ranging or controversial, Representatives who do not sit on the relevant legislative committee seek to testify. (Except in the most unusual circumstances, only House Members are allowed to testify during a rule request hearing.) Questioning of each witness takes place under the five-minute rule until each Committee Member has had an opportunity to question each witness. Questioning is rather informal. The chairman rarely enforces the five-minute rule, and Committee Members yield to one another to allow their colleagues to make a specific point or follow up on a line of questioning. A quorum, at least seven Members of the thirteen, must be present before a recommendation on a rule can be ordered reported, postponed, or tabled (killed). After the Committee votes to approve a rule, the chairman and ranking minority member each assign one of their Members to manage the rule on the floor. The majority manager's name appears on the rule and report, and that Member usually files the rule from the House floor, at which time the resolution and report are assigned a number. Any Member may ask for a record or a division vote. In the past, most decisions of the Committee were made by voice vote, but in the last several Congresses there has been an increase in the number of record votes demanded. For the entire 100th Congress there were 18 roll call votes demanded; in the 101st Congress there were 26; in the 102d there were 193; in the 103d there were 533; in the 104th there were 327; in the 105th there were 104; in the 106th there were 119; in the 107th there were 176; in the 108th there were 326; in the 109th there were 254; in the 110th there were 620; and in the 111th there were 517. Once a special rule has been reported, the Majority Leader--working closely with the Speaker, the Rules Committee chairman, and the substantive committee chairman--decides upon an appropriate date and time for the consideration of the rule on the floor. Rules can be considered on the same day they are reported, if the House agrees to consideration of the rule by a two-thirds vote. After a one-day layover, rules may be considered at any time without being subject to a question of consideration. The Committee may occasionally report a rule waiving this requirement with respect to another rule. 3. TYPES OF SPECIAL ORDERS OR RULES a. Background Table 1 in the Appendix categorizes all special rules granted by the Committee. These special rules are broken down into a number of different categories dealing with all stages of the legislative process in the House. During the 111th Congress, the Rules Committee granted special rules that provided for specified amendment and debate structures, which assisted floor managers in managing the schedule and consideration of legislation, that resolved differences among and responded to the legislative actions of committees, and that addressed House-Senate relations. The explanations of these types of special rules and their methods of categorization are outlined below. b. Categories of Rules Granted with Amendment Structures In categorizing special rules which specified an amendment structure, this report focuses only on those rules which provided for the initial consideration of bills, joint resolutions or budget resolutions and which provided for an amending process. Therefore, rules providing for general debate only, stopping short of consideration of the measure for amendment, or providing for consideration of a conference report (which are otherwise privileged and, under regular order, non-amendable) are not included in these categories. The amendment structure categories are as follows: (1) open rules, (2) modified open rules--requiring amendment pre-printing in the Congressional Record, (3) structured or modified closed rules, and (4) closed rules. (1) Open Rules: Under an open rule, any Member may offer an amendment that complies with the standing rules of the House and the Budget Act. Also included in the category of open rules are those special rules that are often referred to as ``open plus.'' These rules allow the offering of any amendment normally in order under an open rule plus the consideration of any amendments for which waivers of points of order have been granted by the special rule. (2) Modified Open Rules (Required Amendment Preprinting in the Congressional Record): This type of rule permits the offering of only those amendments preprinted in the Congressional Record. In some cases the rule requires amendments to be printed by a specific date; in some cases the amendment must be printed before its consideration; and in other cases before the consideration of the bill for any amendment. In most cases these rules do not prohibit second degree amendments. Requiring that amendments be printed in advance of their consideration affords Members a better idea of the range of issues to be debated and voted on during consideration of the bill. This can particularly be true of bills or joint resolutions involving complex or confidential matters. (3) Structured or Modified Closed Rules: Under a structured or modified closed rule, the Rules Committee limits the amendments that may be offered to only those amendments designated in the special rule or in the Rules Committee report to accompany the rule, or which precludes amendments to a particular portion of a bill, even though the rest of the bill may be completely open to amendment. A modified closed rule is one which allows the offering of only one or two amendments. A structured rule is one which allows three or more amendments. In the case of a structured or modified closed rule, the Chairman will announce through a one minute speech on the floor of the House and through a ``Dear Colleague'' letter the intention of the Committee to hold a hearing on a measure and to review all amendments. The Chairman requests that Members provide the Rules Committee with copies of their proposed amendments in advance of the Committee meeting date. In some instances, the amendments made in order represent all of the amendments submitted to the Committee. (4) Closed Rules: This type of rule is one under which no amendments may be offered other than amendments recommended by the committee reporting the bill. However, the Rules Committee is prohibited under the rules of the House from reporting a special rule providing for consideration of a bill or joint resolution that denies the minority the right to offer amendatory instructions in a motion to recommit if offered by the Minority Leader or a designee. c. Categories of Rules Granted with Certain Floor Management Tools During the 111th Congress, special rules often were utilized to assist the Majority Leader in setting the Floor schedule of the House, as well as to equip committee chairmen and ranking minority members with the special procedural tools necessary to efficiently manage the floor consideration of a bill. These categories include (1) expedited procedure rules, (2) suspension day rules, and (3) chairman's en bloc authority rules. (1) Expedited Procedure Rules: This type of rule waives clause 6(a) of rule XIII (requiring a two-thirds vote to consider a special rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee) against certain resolutions reported from the Rules Committee. These rules generally specify the resolutions to which the waiver applies, as well as a defined time period for its application. (2) Suspension Day Rules: Under clause 1(a) of House Rule XV, it is in order on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of each week, and during the last six days of a session, for the Speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules and pass legislation. This category of rule authorizes the Speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules on days other than Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Generally, these rules provide that the object of any motion to suspend the rules be announced (sometimes with an hour or two notice) from the floor prior to its consideration or that the Speaker or his designee shall consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the object of any suspension considered under the rule. (3) Chair's En Bloc Authority Rules: This category of rule authorizes the chairman of a committee (usually the majority floor manager of the bill under consideration) or his designee to offer amendments en bloc consisting of amendments made in order by the special rule that have not earlier been disposed of, as well as germane modifications to any such amendments. With the exception of rules on appropriations bills (which permit en bloc amendments that do not increase budget authority or outlays in the bill), a Member seeking to offer amendments en bloc must obtain unanimous consent if they amend portions of the bill not yet open to amendment, unless a special rule authorizes several amendments to be offered and considered as a group. There usually is a specified time for divided debate on the amendment and a prohibition on amendments to and demands for a division of the question on the en bloc amendment. Generally, the original sponsor of the amendment must agree to having the amendment considered en bloc, and these rules generally provide that the original proponent of an amendment included in such an en bloc amendment may insert a statement in the Congressional Record immediately before the disposition of the en bloc amendment. Such a rule enables the floor manager to maximize efficiency and consensus while minimizing duplicative floor time and consideration. d. Categories of Rules Granted To Resolve Differences Among and Responding to the Legislative Actions of Committees As the nexus of the legislative process in the House, the Rules Committee often is the institutional mechanism used to reconcile differences in legislative recommendations among multiple committees. Two often used, and often misunderstood, special rule features utilized to achieve these goals are (1) self-executing rules and (2) original text rules. (1) Self-Executing Rules: This type of rule provides that, upon the adoption of the special rule, the text of a reported or introduced bill, as the case may be, is modified or amended in some specified manner. Therefore, the House's adoption of the rule itself has the effect of amending the underlying bill. Occasionally, a self-executing rule may also provide for the adoption of other unrelated measures or actions, such as adopting another simple resolution. Self-executing rules may be utilized by the Rules Committee for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: the correction of rule or Budget Act violations, the reconciling of multiple committee legislative recommendations, the elimination of procedural votes, the separation of policy issues or the complete redrafting of the legislation. (2) Original Text Rules: When a committee reports a measure, it often will favorably report the measure with a recommendation that an amendment or amendments be adopted by the full House. These amendments reflect the collegial action of the committee on that measure. This type of rule generally provides that the committee recommended amendment be adopted by the House and become the base text for the purpose of further amendment to the bill. This is often done to acknowledge the actions of the committee at the beginning of the consideration of a bill, and also to simplify the amendment process. e. Categories of Rules Granted Dealing with House-Senate Relations While resolving differences with the Senate often involves privileged motions in the House, the Rules Committee is often called upon to expedite such procedural situations or to address unique procedural circumstances. The categories of such special rules are (1) Senate hook-up rules, (2) motion to go to conference rules, (3) disposition of Senate amendments rules, (4) conference report rules, and (5) engrossment of multiple measures rules. (1) Senate Hook-up Rules: The rules of the House provide for three methods of getting to conference with the Senate: (1) agreeing to a motion to go to conference by unanimous consent; (2) obtaining a special rule from the Rules Committee; or (3) receiving specific authorization from each committee which received an initial referral of and reported the bill (clause 1 of Rule XXII). Most often chairmen obtain conference authority from their committee at the time a bill is ordered reported. Most special rules allowing for a Senate hook-up provide that after passage of a House bill, it shall be in order to take a specific Senate bill from the Speaker's table, consider it in the House, and to move to strike all after the enacting clause and insert the text of the House bill as passed by the House. These special rules further provide that if the motion is adopted and the Senate bill, as amended, is passed, then it shall be in order to move that the House insist on its amendment and request a conference with the Senate. These hook- up provisions can be included either in the original rule providing for consideration of the House bill or in a separate special rule only providing for the motion to go to conference. (2) Motion to go to Conference Rules: These special rules are those separate rules that only provide for the motion to go to conference with the Senate. (3) Disposition of Senate Amendment Rules: This type of rule generally provides for the consideration of a Senate amendment or amendments in the House and for a motion to concur in the Senate amendment with or without an amendment. These rules also usually specify a period of time for debate on the motion equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction, as well as any necessary waivers against consideration of either the Senate amendment or against the motion to concur. (4) Conference Report Rules: Under the standing rules of the House, conference reports are privileged matters. Unless the requirement is waived, House rules require that a conference report be available for at least three calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) before it can be called up for consideration. After that time, because it is privileged, it can be called up at any time without a rule from the Rules Committee. However, if a conference report is in violation of a rule of the House or some extraordinary procedure for consideration of the report is desired, a special rule may be necessary for the conference report to be considered. Consequently, conference report rules generally provide waivers of all points of order against consideration of the conference report and provide that the conference report be considered as read, which effectively waives the three day availability requirement. It should be noted that points of order against a conference report lie against its consideration, not against individual provisions contained within the report. A conference report represents the collective agreement of the House and the Senate. Changing individual components of the agreement violates the sanctity of the agreement itself. Consequently, agreeing to a conference report is an all-or-nothing question. This is also the reason why, even as privileged matters, conference reports are not amendable on the floor of the House (except on recommit). (5) Engrossment of Multiple Measures Rules: These types of special rules generally provide for separate consideration and final passage votes on multiple bills, generally relating to a similar issue. The rule then instructs the House enrolling clerk to enroll the individually-passed bills into one bill before transmitting them to the Senate for consideration. 4. FLOOR CONSIDERATION OF A SPECIAL RULE When the time comes to call up a special rule, the majority Member who filed the rule (a privileged House resolution), or another majority Member of the Rules Committee designated by the chairman, is recognized by the Speaker. That Member stands at the majority committee table on the House Floor. Once recognized, the Member States: Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution __________, and ask for its immediate consideration. Any Member of the Committee on Rules may be recognized to call up a rule that has been on the House Calendar for at least seven legislative days, and the Speaker is required to recognize the Rules Committee Member as a privilege, as long as the Member has given one day's notice of an intent to seek recognition for that purpose. Once the Clerk has read the resolution, the Speaker recognizes the majority Rules Committee Member handling the rule for one hour. The majority floor manager then customarily yields thirty minutes to a minority counterpart for the purposes of debate only. The length of debate on the rule varies according to the complexity of the rule and the degree of controversy over the bill, but debate on most non- controversial rules is over within fifteen or twenty minutes and the rule may be adopted by voice vote. Because a rule is considered in the House under the hour rule, no amendments are in order unless the majority floor manager offers an amendment or yields to another Member for that purpose. At the conclusion of debate on the rule, the floor manager moves the previous question. If no objection is heard, the House proceeds to vote on the rule. If objection is heard, a vote occurs on the previous question. If the previous question is rejected, however, a Member who opposed the previous question (usually the Rules Committee minority floor manager) is recognized. That Member then controls one hour of debate time on the rule. The Member controlling the time may offer an amendment to the rule and then move the previous question on the amendment and on the rule when debate has concluded. Once the rule is adopted (with or without amendments), the legislation it concerns is eligible for consideration under the terms of the rule. 5.
