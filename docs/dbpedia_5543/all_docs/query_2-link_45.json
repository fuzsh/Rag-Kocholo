Innovative discoveries and inventions are bringing about a paradigm shift in biomedical research. Innovation can propel a simple finding in basic science to a concept that can be of immense value to society. While applying these novel innovations that came out by studying the basic mechanisms, an offshoot of applied branch emerged. This field which is now widely referred to as Translational Research utilizes basic science findings and translates these findings into novel concepts for the benefit of mankind. The students will be introduced to different aspects of biomedical research topics in this course.\n\nPrerequisite(s): Admission to Undergraduate College of Creativity, Technology, and Innovation (CTI)\n\n1 credit, Letter Grading\n\nNotes: This class meets over in the Health Sciences Building, on East Campus.\n\nCTI 102.101: 3D Modeling for Games\n\nClass Nbr: 53934\n\nInstr.

Yet, the mere mention of the word can cause such an adverse reaction in people's minds, which oftentimes shows on their faces. How can it be that something so beautifully intricate and yet so applicable to our lives in simple ways could cause such a reaction? The purpose of this course is to pull back the curtain and take a closer look at this \"monster\", and understand it for what it really is. Each week we will discuss simple, yet practical ways that math is used in our lives and, hopefully, in the process, see it for the beauty it really has.\n\nPrerequisite(s): Admission to Undergraduate College of Creativity, Technology, and Innovation (CTI)\n\n1 credit, Letter Grading\n\nCTI 102.116: Climate and Polar Science: Future of Antarctica\n\nClass Nbr: 53949\n\nProf. Weisen Shen, Department of Geosciences |View Bio\n\nDay/Time: Wednesday | 8:30am to 9:50am\n\nMeeting Pattern: 1 hr 20 mins per week for 10 weeks (January 22, 2024 to April 5, 2024)\n\nLocation: deVries Center, Room 109\n\nThis seminar will present and discuss the scientific explorations and research focused on the continent of Antarctica.
