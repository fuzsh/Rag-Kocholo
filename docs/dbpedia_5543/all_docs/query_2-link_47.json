        "text": "Established in 1910, the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) has grown to become the Smithsonian’s largest museum and research unit. The NMNH is one of the world’s premier scientific institutions, as well as one of the most visited museums in the world—attracting more than six million visitors a year, with millions more visiting online. The Museum’s mission is to increase knowledge and inspire learning about nature and culture through outstanding research, collections, exhibitions, and education, in support of a sustainable future.\n\nSteward of the largest natural history collections in the world, the NMNH holds more than 148 million specimens and cultural objects that document the history and formation of Earth, the diversity and evolution of life on the planet, and our shared human heritage. These collections are an unparalleled resource for the study and understanding of the natural world and our place in it. Every year, we welcome thousands of national and international researchers to our headquarters in Washington, DC and to our satellite facility—the Museum Support Center in Suitland, MD—where researchers use the collections to address a variety of research questions pertaining to geology, paleontology, biology, and anthropology, as well as other interdisciplinary fields. At any given time, over two million specimens are on loan to universities and research centers worldwide. Cited in more than 1,200 scientific publications annually, the Museum’s collections are the foundation of our research and educational programs. Their relevance to science and society continues to grow as new technologies are applied to their study and analysis. Broadening access to the collections is a key priority for the Museum, and several digitization efforts are underway to make them more readily available online to the international science community, policymakers and the public at large. Currently, a total of over 11.1 million specimen records have been made available to the public from ten museum collection units. Nearly 292,000 of these records describe all of the Museum’s extant primary type specimens.\n\nThe Museum’s research activities focus on three broad themes: (i) the Formation and Evolution of the Earth and Similar Planets, (ii) the Discovery and Understanding of Life’s Diversity, and (iii) Human Diversity and Cultural Change. Within these themes, the scope of our work is as varied as the interests of our scientists, whose explorations and inquiries take place on every continent, in more than 110 countries, and range from the depths of the ocean to the outer regions of space. The Museum is organized into seven departments: Anthropology, Botany, Entomology, Invertebrate Zoology, Mineral Sciences, Paleobiology and Vertebrate Zoology. We work on questions and issues often too complex for any one institution to solve alone and therefore collaborate with museums, universities and research centers across the United States and around the world, as well as with federal government agencies such as the United States Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Commerce, the Interior, and the Federal Aviation Administration, among others. We also support a large and vibrant academic community, including scientists from affiliated government agencies based at the Museum, external researchers, interns and fellows. The results of our research—as well as that of others using our collections—are made available not only through scholarly papers and books, but also through exhibitions, symposia, courses, lectures, workshops, and numerous websites.\n\nIn addition to advancing its core research themes, the Museum is also working to advance seven priority initiatives, which integrate our research, collections and outreach activities. Each represents an area that has special relevance and urgency to society, where the Museum has a comparative advantage, and where we are poised to make substantial progress over the next decade. Designed to be long-term and transformational for the Museum, these initiatives build on our strengths and will expand our partnerships within the Smithsonian and with external collaborators.\n\nAligned with our efforts to expand and preserve our natural history collections and make them more broadly accessible, and to continue making fundamental contributions to our knowledge and understanding of nature and culture, is our commitment to the training of future generations of scientists and Museum professionals. Every year we offer several professional development and training opportunities for national and international students and researchers—from internships for high school and undergraduate students to conduct research under the mentorship of Museum scientists, to fellowships for pre-and postdoctoral students, as well as other professionals, to pursue independent research topics. By cultivating and supporting a vibrant, diverse and inclusive academic community, we aim to play a critical role in building scientific capacity to deepen our understanding of Earth processes, biodiversity and evolution, as well as our origins and cultural diversity, and to advance knowledge that can help us to make more informed decisions about the management of our planet.\n\nOffice of the Director\n\nResearch Staff\n\nHayek, Lee-Ann, Research Statistician.

Contact: JohnsonRN@si.edu\n\nNMNH Signature Initiatives\n\nEarth and Planetary Sciences: Our Unique Planet\n\nAs a long-time leader in Earth and Planetary Science research, the museum pushes back the boundaries of our knowledge of our planet and solar system and inspires public audiences with new discoveries in this rapidly evolving field. It also offers exciting opportunities to amplify our reach and impact through collaboration with other Smithsonian museums and research centers, NASA, and others engaged in the pursuit of space exploration. The centerpiece of Our Unique Planet is the analysis of a sample from the asteroid Bennu currently slated to arrive on Earth in September 2023 as part of NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission. Equally critical to this project is the focus on training of early-career scientists by the museum’s Mineral Sciences team in the key scientific elements of the initiative:\n\nWhat was the source of the Earth’s oceans?\n\nHow did silica-rich continental crust first form?\n\nWhat was the role of minerals in the origin of life?\n\nThe research will be in two phases – from 2021-2023 and 2023-2025 – which correspond to the time before and after the arrival of a key sample retrieved from the Bennu asteroid. Insights from the Bennu samples will be enhanced by analyses of the oldest rocks on Earth and by samples from the museum’s extensive meteorite collection. These new discoveries will result in two new public-facing programs: A “Time Machine” virtual reality experience, giving audiences the opportunity to experience the early Earth; and enhancements to the museum’s Hall of Gems and Minerals. On a longer timeframe, the project will provide the foundational scientific knowledge and inspiration for a brand-new exhibition about the origins of our solar system, Earth, and life itself that we expect to part of the next strategic plan. Contact: Tim McCoy McCoyT@si.edu, Mike Ackerson ackersonm@si.edu, Cari Corrigan CorriganC@si.edu; Ioan Lascu LascuI@si.edu.\n\nMarine Science and Conservation: The Ocean Science Center\n\nEarth’s ocean covers more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is essential for humanity’s survival, but it faces unprecedented human-mediated impacts from habitat destruction, pollution, over-fishing, industrialization, acidification and climate change. Warming of the ocean is driving more destructive storms and increasing the rate of sea level rise. Our ability to mitigate these threats relies on our ability to characterize what lives in any part of the ocean at any given time, and to identify the conditions necessary for their survival. New approaches, including environmental DNA and machine learning, promise to deliver real-time assays of marine biodiversity. The museum has a unique set of ocean-related collections, field stations, scientific research programs, educational assets, expertise and exhibitions that are of broad value and utility to the scientific community, policy makers, and the public. To maximize these assets, we will establish the Ocean Science Center to convene, expand, and highlight the relevance of our diverse portfolio of marine expertise. The Ocean DNA project will lead the global effort to develop a genomic toolkit to rapidly assess ocean health, and curate a DNA reference library to enable large-scale surveys of marine life, especially of undiscovered “dark taxa” that may play acritical role in ecosystems. We will develop this toolkit which can be applied to discover new species, detect invasive species, monitor change, assess the effectiveness of marine reserves and management practices, and inform priorities for conservation. Contact: Christopher Meyer MeyerC@si.edu, Ellen Strong StrongE@si.edu.\n\nClimate Change and Sustainability: People in Nature\n\nThe natural world around us is changing at an unprecedented rate, with human population growth and climate change threatening species and habitats, as well as the resources and ecosystems services that underpin our society. The People in Nature Initiative will transform how the museum engages on-site and digital visitors on the most important challenge facing humanity over the next 30 years: how to achieve a sustainable future for ourselves and Earth’s millions of species in the face of rapid climate change and sustained human population growth. The People in Nature Experience—will combine digital imagery, geographical data, audience participation, storytelling, exhibitions, and personal narratives to equip our audiences with the information they need to understand the world as it is today and what it will be in the future. Our goal is to empower and motivate citizens to become informed participants in the decisions that lie ahead for society, for them to understand the need for urgent action, and to give them the confidence they need to take action. Contact: Michael Lawrence LawrenceM@si.edu.\n\nBig Ideas Incubator\n\nGenomics and Informatics\n\nNatural history specimens collected decades or even over a century ago are increasingly critical elements in understanding the biological, geological, and cultural diversity of our planet. Access to these specimens through digital, genomic, and analytical technologies continues to revolutionize how collections and their data are used in our own science and shared across the global research community—arguably making them more valuable than ever. The Informatics and Data Science Center (IDSC) is responsible for genomics and informatics strategies that leverage our unique strengths. Working with national and international partners to scope for a coordinated national infrastructure for genomic and digital collections and their associated information platforms could look like. This will require significant investment in digitization of specimens, the development of facilities for new environmental collections, and the data science capacity required to aggregate and share these resources. Contact: Vanessa Gonzalez GonzalezV@si.edu, Rebecca Snyder SnyderR@si.edu.\n\nCommunity Science\n\nCommunity science is increasingly showing its power to both engage the public as citizen scientists as well as scale and revolutionize how we collect data on the natural world. By providing people with access to scientific tools and results, museums can vastly increase their reach and impact while also growing their constituencies. This is particularly true when community science is combined with digital platforms that allow the collection and analysis of data at a continental scale. Our ambition is to develop a scientific project that harnesses the scale and breadth of community science at a national scale. We will work with partners to empower individuals to explore nature and answer questions only possible with the scale of data collection made possible by community science. Contact: Carla Easter EasterC@si.edu, Robert Costello CostelloR@si.edu.\n\nDigital Education and Outreach\n\nDigital technologies make it possible for the museum to make its scientific knowledge and public programs available to classrooms and homes across the nation. The COVID pandemic has rapidly accelerated our use of these technologies and has shown us what is possible, especially in the realm of education, virtual tours, and live interactions with our experts. Our challenge now is to determine the right balance between our digital programming and our on-site and community programs. This is an area where there are huge opportunities for collaboration across the Smithsonian that make full use of pan-institutional platforms and partnerships. Contact: Carla Easter EasterC@si.edu, Maggy Benson BensonM@si.edu.\n\nThe Science of People in Nature\n\nThe relationship between people and nature has never been so important, yet these two topics are often studied separately. With expertise spanning the life, earth, and human sciences, the museum is well-equipped to develop a cross-disciplinary research environment to explore how the relationship between people and nature has changed over time and how it is understood by different cultures. We anticipate this project will also inform the redevelopment of our second-floor public galleries, which we expect to be a major focus of the museum’s 2026-2030 plan. Arguably the most important challenge that humanity faces over coming years is navigating a sustainable relationship between humans and the other organisms, habitats, and ecosystems on which our well-being, society, economy, and happiness depend. The museum’s unique position as a collections-based research institution with a substantial public audience affords us the opportunity to address the big questions that society faces and our fundamental understanding how people and nature interact. The goal of this incubator is to develop across-disciplinary research environment that encompasses the many themes and program areas where the museum’s science enhances our understanding of sustainability and the human relationship with the natural world. Contact: Rebecca Johnson JohnsonRN@si.edu.\n\nOther Initiatives\n\nDeep Time Initiative\n\nFrom the planet’s early beginnings to the age of humans, our rich fossil record reveals how our planet has changed over millions of years and how life has adapted to change. Armed with this knowledge, we have new ways to understand our natural world and our place in it, now and into the future. A single species—our own—is changing the Earth, and our impact on climate, ecosystems and biodiversity will be evident for thousands of generations to come. Paleontology gives us a long-term, “Deep Time” view of Earth’s history, helping us make sense of the kinds of global-scale changes that have been large, slow and rare—until now. The Museum has the largest fossil collection in the world with over 40 million specimens, representing the history of life on Earth over the last 2.5 billion years, and a team of expert scientists studying the evolution of the Earth and its biological communities over time. Our goal is to mobilize this knowledge of the history of life and encourage society to learn from the past to better understand the changes that are shaping our future. Contact: Kay Behrensmeyer BehrensA@si.edu, Matt Carrano CarranoM@si.edu, Scott Wing WingS@si.edu\n\nHuman Origins Initiative\n\nOur origin and evolution as humans is a compelling scientific question. Where did we come from and how have we changed over time? What are the main characteristics that make us human? The Human Origins Initiative addresses these and other challenging questions and expands our understanding of human evolution. Our researchers are investigating the evolution of human ancestors in Africa and Asia, focusing particularly on how human adaptations relate to environmental change over millions of years. The initiative has strengthened the human origins research program in collaboration with institutions and scientists from developing countries, established the Peter Buck Chair in Human Origins, and designed and completed the renovations for the David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins. Contact: Richard Potts PottsR@si.edu\n\nQ?rius Education Initiative\n\nPublic museums represent a virtually untapped resource for increasing scientific literacy. They are a perfect venue for inspiring awe and wonder about science, nature, and culture and can complement our formal educational system. NMNH is transforming the public’s connection to science by creating opportunities for young people to participate in the wonders of scientific discovery that go on behind the scenes. At the heart of our efforts is the Q?rius Initiative, which is focused around a 10,000 sq. ft. evolving learning-laboratory for experimental and innovative methodologies in the Museum and beyond. Teens and pre-teens can participate in activities rooted in real-world research, examine 6,000 authentic objects (digital and physical), interact with scientists, and experiment with field techniques and laboratory technology. Q?rius follows an “agile development” model, so that offerings are refined based on real input from our key audiences. Q?rius relies on interactive, web-based technologies to connect onsite and online experiences, expand access, and personalize the content. Its digital field books, digital collections browser, badge system, and distance-learning tool are the building blocks of an infrastructure to test and improve innovative methodologies that engage learners of all ages, wherever they are. Contact: Carla Easter EasterC@si.edu\n\nRecovering Voices Initiative\n\nIt is estimated that at least half of the world’s 7,000 languages will cease to be spoken by the end of this century. The silencing of the world’s languages—and the associated loss of traditional knowledge and culture—is universally regarded as one of the 21st century’s key global societal challenges. Fully utilizing the Smithsonian’s National Anthropological Archives, the Human Studies Film Archives, and the vast ethnological and natural history collections at NMNH, Recovering Voices executes community-based research efforts to document, preserve, and revitalize language and knowledge. Working with Indigenous communities, particularly in the Smithsonian collections, facilitates the revitalization and documentation of many of the world’s dormant and endangered languages and assists global efforts to sustain linguistic and knowledge diversity. Through diverse outreach efforts, such as the annual Mother Tongue Film Festival, the Recovering Voices helps raise awareness about cultural and linguistic diversity.

Featuring HEPA-filtration and positive air pressure to reduce DNA contamination and built to provide next-generation sequencing (NGS) data collection capability, the ancient DNA clean lab provides researchers with a sterile facility to examine ancient molecular data from specimens ranging from mummified tissues and archaeological remains to ancient sediments and diverse museum specimens. The ancient DNA lab holds great potential to investigate critical questions related to biodiversity conservation, anthropological history, genomic evolution, and more. Contact: Logan Kistler KistlerL@si.edu\n\nBiomedical Imaging Research Center\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution Bio-Imaging Research (SIBIR) Center is an inter-departmental and cross-disciplinary entity at NMNH that is in the Department of Anthropology. At the heart of the SIBIR center is a Siemens SOMATOM Emotion 6, a multi-slice spiral computed tomography (CT) scanner that can visualize objects of varying size, composition, and structural complexity (69 cm gantry aperture, 0.6 mm slice width). By revealing the fine interior architecture of an object without any physical damage to it, these images can be used to address critical questions in evolutionary biology, paleontology, archaeology, biological anthropology, environmental health and conservation science. The SIBIR Center also includes computer facilities for CT data processing and analysis. Contact: Sabrina Sholts SholtsS@si.edu\n\nBiorepository\n\nLocated at the Museum Support Center (Pod 3), this cutting-edge facility is designed to provide long term care for the Museum’s frozen, non-human, biological collections. The biorepository facility has the capacity to house more than 4.2 million items at temperatures of -20˚, -80˚, or -190˚ C and primarily includes specimens from Botany, Entomology, Invertebrate Zoology, and Vertebrate Zoology. Contact: NMNHbiorepository@si.edu\n\nCaribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems Program\n\nCarrie Bow Cay Field Station, Belize. The Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems (CCRE) Program was formally established in 1985, although the program has its roots in a collaborative mangrove and reef research project from 1972. CCRE is dedicated to field and laboratory research in all science disciplines contributing to our knowledge of Caribbean coral reef and related ecological systems, present and past. Carrie Bow Cay, a 0.4 hectare (1 acre) sand island on top of the southern Belize barrier reef, serves as a field laboratory for scientific investigators from NMNH and co-investigators from other Smithsonian units. The facilities at Carrie Bow Cay can accommodate up to 6 scientists and staff for 1-3 weeks at a time. The laboratory building houses a wet lab with flow-through seawater, and dry lab spaces with stereo and compound microscopes and limited lab supplies. Three outboard skiffs (15-25 ft.) and full SCUBA amenities are available for use. A station manager and a cook are always on duty. Contact: Valerie Paul Paul@si.edu\n\nJoseph F. Cullman 3rd Library of Natural History\n\nThe Joseph F. Cullman 3rd Library of Natural History holds a world-class collection of rare materials in the history of anthropology and the natural sciences, with approximately 20,000 rare books dating from the 15th to the 19th centuries. Opened in 2002, the facility brings together subject-specific collections previously scattered across twelve separate locations in three buildings. The Library provides cross-disciplinary strengths in the narratives and reports of early voyages of exploration and scientific expeditions (including 19th-century archival material in the Russell E. Train Africana collection), taxonomic works on plants and animals from all geographic areas, catalogues of natural history collections from the Renaissance into the modern era, and publications on field-collecting and museum-preservation techniques in the 18th and 19th centuries. In addition, the Cullman Library holds the personal library of founder James Smithson, the Deshayes card file on molluscan taxonomy, and the Wheldon & Wesley (natural history booksellers) card index 1950-2000. Contact: Leslie Overstreet OverstreetL@si.edu\n\nLaboratories of Analytical Biology\n\nThe Laboratories of Analytical Biology (LAB) serve the research community of the NMNH and other SI units in the pursuit of focused, first class science with an experienced staff, shared instrumentation, support and training. The aim of LAB is to enhance the research environment and contribute to general scientific literacy by providing current technological resources in the areas of genomics, molecular biology, bioinformatics and scientific computing. Two main facilities of the LAB comprise over 20,000 sq.-feet of laboratory, computational and office spaces. LAB provides the capability of performing a full range of comparative modern molecular methods and includes separate pre- and post-PCR facilities, next generation genome sequencers, automated DNA extractors, automated library preparation instrumentation, capillary DNA sequencing instruments, scores of PCR machines (including real-time), microfluidic separation technology for DNA, RNA and proteins, automated robotic liquid handlers, and cloning areas. Computer facilities include labs with Mac, Linux and Windows workstations, including systems with increased memory for large datasets and large screens for data visualization. Support is available from LAB, NMNH, and OCIO staff for running analyses on Smithsonian’s computing cluster. LAB provides access to molecular analytical software including licensed programs like Geneious and Sequencher. All NMNH researchers and affiliated staff, with the approval of their department chair, can request LAB access, bench space, and computer facilities and equipment. Contact: Lee Weigt WeigtL@si.edu, Amy Driskell DriskellA@si.edu\n\nNatural History Libraries\n\nThe NMNH Library was formed as an administrative entity in 1981 and is one of 21 libraries within the Smithsonian Libraries. It consists of a main library (on the first floor and basement of the NMNH East Court) plus 13 specialized collections. We offer weekly orientations to these sciences libraries, or you can stop by the main branch at any time for a quick overview and a library card application. Most of these library collections are near corresponding departments in the NMNH building (including the Botany & Horticulture and John Wesley Powell Library of Anthropology branch libraries, which, along with the main location, are staffed full time). Along with abundant collaborative workspace, including two training rooms, the main library features scholarly, highly-technical and research-oriented materials in cross-disciplinary topics within the general areas of interest to the NMNH. It contains over 120,000 items on general science, biology, ecology, evolution, biodiversity, geology, paleontology, conservation, genomics and other subjects. The library offers over 500 print and/or online journal subscriptions and a number of journals received on exchange. The NMNH main library also contains the Museum Studies Research Library (MSRL) collection. All locations have strong collections of 19th- and 20th-century scientific literature. The Smithsonian Libraries participates in sharing resources with some of the most important libraries in the nation, including the National Agricultural Library, the Library of Congress, the National Library of Medicine, and the Geological Survey (USGS) Library. These libraries make the Washington, D.C. area one of the best in the country for bibliographic research. Contact: Jane Quigley QuigleyJM@si.edu\n\nPhotography and Media\n\nDigital media is key to achieving the Smithsonian’s goal of reaching 1 billion people a year. The NMNH Office of Photography and Media directly supports this strategic initiative through digital photography of the Museum’s collections, research, exhibitions, programs, events, people, and facilities. Our professionally trained photographers have substantial experience working in a variety of photographic styles, including scientific, forensic, fine art, portrait, documentary, and candid. As well as working on location, the NMNH Photo and Media team operates two studios equipped with the latest technology and gear at the Natural History Museum building in Washington, DC, and at the Museum Support Center in Suitland, MD. In addition to creating new photography of NMNH subjects, NMNH Photo and Media also maintains an archive of over 200,000 digital images that we are responsible for distributing to requestors around the world. NMNH Photo and Media also offers film digitization and digital printing services to the NMNH community. Contact: James Di Loreto DiLoreto@si.edu, Kristen Quarles QuarlesK@si.edu\n\nScientific Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe Scientific Imaging (Scanning Electron Microscope) Lab supports the research interests and conservation efforts of NMNH scientists by providing state-of-the-art instrumentation, training, and assistance in preparing samples for microscopic study. At the heart of the Lab are the three low-vacuum-capable Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM). Each instrument has unique capabilities such as large area automated tiling, EDS elemental analysis, or extreme magnification, ensuring that virtually any sample can be studied. In addition to the electron beam instruments, the lab provides a high-quality, well-equipped compound fluorescent microscope, a stereo zoom microscope, and the free-angle, opto-digital zoom microscope. The lab also provides for the capture of spatially and colorimetrically accurate 3D models via a photogrammetry workstation and laser scanning workstations. Rounding out the facility is the micro-computed tomography (µCT) scanner with submicron spatial resolution for non-destructive 3D X-Ray imaging of samples and internal structures. Volume reconstructions and analysis is performed on high performance HP workstations running Volume Graphics 3D Studio Max software. The Scientific Imaging Lab is well-equipped to prepare samples for examination including a full wet lab with chemical fume hoods and ancillary support equipment such as a vacuum evaporator, high-resolution sputter coater, critical point dryer, freeze dryer, cut-off saws and polishers. Any NMNH researcher, with the approval of their NMNH department chair, can train to use the facility and instrumentation in support of NMNH research interests. Contact: Scott Whittaker WhittakS@si.edu, Jennifer Hill HillJJ@si.edu\n\nDepartment of Anthropology\n\nThe mission of the Department of Anthropology is to study the biological and cultural diversity of humankind around the globe. Our staff members record, study, collect and preserve artifacts representative of world societies and disseminate that knowledge widely through publications, exhibits, lectures, teaching, and by providing opportunities for research and study within the department. The Department’s top priority is to address the difficult legacies of the field through working to decolonize the Anthropology collections, many of which were collected during a time of power imbalance. Repatriation to Native American tribes, international repatriation, ethical stewardship and ethical returns are all being implemented or explored as ways to address the difficult legacy of the field.\n\nResearch\n\nResearch in the Department of Anthropology encompasses the entire range of human development, from the earliest traces of our distant ancestors, more than five million years ago, to the challenges facing society today Our researchers explore the effects of humans on the environment and the impacts of the environment on humans—learning how our responses may have shaped our evolution. Our archaeologists trace environmental change in marine environments through 10,000-year-old marine shells, document the role of people in domesticating plants through the analysis of ancient DNA, explore the connections between seventeenth-century Basque whalers and the Indigenous people of Quebec. Our ethnologists work in partnership with IIndigenous communities around the world, examining the role of objects in the creation of identity and heritage, and they collaborate with communities to document their endangered languages and knowledge systems. Our biological anthropologists study historic period populations, engage in cutting-edge forensic work and seek clues to help modern populations deal with real-time issues by studying the effects of environmental pollutants on the human skeleton.\n\nCollections\n\nThe Department of Anthropology preserves diverse collections relating to world cultures and the history of anthropological study and makes them accessible to Indigenous and other communities for a wide variety of research, education, and enrichment activities. The Anthropology collections are comprised of three main collections units: Archaeology, Ethnology and Biological Anthropology Collections; National Anthropological Archives; and Human Studies Film Archives.\n\nArchaeology\n\nThe archaeology collections consist of 3 million objects derived primarily from Smithsonian-sponsored excavations. Much of this work has focused on North America. There are, however, significant collections from other world areas, including artifacts from the first excavations at many locations in Central and South America and rare materials from the Old World Paleolithic and Mesolithic. Among the significant archaeology collections are the Division of Mound Explorations by Cyrus Thomas in the Eastern United States (1800s); the River Basin Survey collections (1946-1969) that include prehistoric and historical materials from the Missouri River Basin and WPA surveys from the Southeastern United States; as well as the southwest archaeological materials excavated by Neil Judd from Chaco Canyon. Contact: Carrie Beauchamp beauchac@si.edu\n\nEthnology\n\nThe ethnology collections are comprised of over 200,000 objects representing 19th and 20th century cultures from around the globe. Exploring expedition collections document periods of early contact worldwide, while the Bureau of American Ethnology materials represent the results of large-scale, systematic collecting.. The collections include Japanese material collected by Matthew Perry in the 1850s and several thousand items from the Pacific islands assembled by the U.S. Exploring Expedition, 1838-42. The collection is particularly strong in materials from North America, but there are also significant collections from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Central America, Mexico, Oceania, and South America. Contact: Carrie Beauchamp beauchac@si.edu\n\nBiological Anthropology\n\nThe biological anthropology collections at NMNH consist primarily of human skeletal remains that originate from dozens of countries and span the last several millennia of human history. Many of these remains have been used by researchers for a broad range of studies in biological anthropology and forensic science, resulting in hundreds of theses, dissertations, scientific articles, and monographs, as well as the resolution of casework and professional training in these fields. The human remains that make up these collections were mostly acquired by the NMNH through archaeological excavations during the 20th century. Others came to the NMNH through additional means, such as forensic investigations. Contact: Sabrina Sholts SholtsS@si.edu\n\nResearch on human remains in the biological anthropology collections occurs through a process of internal approval, with strict adherence to current ethical guidelines including consultation with and permission from descendant communities as appropriate. Not all the human remains at NMNH are available for scientific study, however, and research access is restricted for those that are subject to repatriation or under interval review. Contact: Carrie Beauchamp beauchac@si.edu\n\nNational Anthropological Archives\n\nThe National Anthropological Archives collects and preserves historical and contemporary anthropological materials that document the world’s cultures and the history of the discipline. Its collections represent the four fields of anthropology—ethnology, linguistics, archaeology, and biological anthropology—and include manuscripts, field notes, correspondence, photographs, maps, sound recordings, film, and video created by Smithsonian anthropologists and other preeminent scholars. The collections include the Smithsonian’s earliest attempts to document North American Indian cultures and the research reports and records of the Bureau of American Ethnology (1879-1964), the U.S. National Museum’s Division of Ethnology, its Division of Biological Anthropology, and River Basin Survey archaeology.\n\nThe NAA also maintains the records of the Smithsonian’s Department of Anthropology and of dozens of professional organizations, such as the American Anthropological Association, the American Ethnological Society, and the Society for American Archaeology. Among the earliest ethnographic collections are the diaries of John Wesley Powell, which recount his exploration of the Colorado and study of the region’s Indians, and the pictographic histories of Plains Indians collected by U.S. military officers and BAE ethnographers. Other significant manuscript collections include the ethnographic and linguistic research of Franz Boas, Frances Densmore, Albert S. Gatschet, John Peabody Harrington, and J.N.B. Hewitt, as well as the expedition logs, photographs, and film record produced on Matthew Stirling’s explorations in New Guinea (1926-29). The Smithsonian’s broad collection policy and support of anthropological research for over 150 years have made the NAA and HSFA unparalleled resources for scholars interested in the cultures of North America, Latin America, Oceania, Africa, Asia and Europe. Although North American materials remain one of the collection’s strengths, for the past 40 years the NAA has collected and preserved anthropological materials that document cultures from around the world.\n\nAll told, the archives curates 17,000 linear feet of manuscripts, 1,000,000 ethnological and archaeological photographs (including some of the earliest images of Indigenous people worldwide), 21,000 works of native art (mainly North American, Asian, and Oceanic), and 5,000 sound recordings. Contact: NAA@si.edu.\n\nHuman Studies Film Archives\n\nThe Human Studies Film Archives was established in 1981 to collect, preserve, and make available for research use anthropological film and video records. The collection includes historic and contemporary, both edited and unedited, black-and-white, color, silent and sound film, and video documents from around the world. The growing collection totals approximately 34,000 holdings including 15,000 rolls of original and preservation film (totaling over 8 million feet), 5,500 rolls of reference film, over 10,000 sound recordings and 3,200 videocassettes. These audiovisual records were created by a diverse group of people including anthropologists, archaeologists, Peace Corps volunteers, missionaries, teachers, travelers, and commercial and independent filmmakers. Supplementary materials such as annotations, sound recordings, field notes, photographs, and dissertations, accompany many of the film projects. An active preservation program ensures that the Film Archives’ moving image records are safe-guarded from format obsolescence and age-related deterioration and degradation. Contact: HSFA@si.edu\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Department of Anthropology maintains conservation laboratories and a collection processing laboratory. The Department has advanced x-ray equipment including a Siemens Somatom CT scanner. The CT scanner is used extensively to study objects in a nondestructive and noninvasive manner. Recently studied objects and specimens include human skeletal remains, mummies, ethnographic objects, forensic objects, and archaeological items. The CT scanner is available to other departments and organizations within the Smithsonian and collaborations related to scanner use include institutions worldwide. Fieldwork equipment includes Ashtec/Magellan GPS (Global Positioning Sys-tem), Topcom electronic total station, and Geonics electromagnetic equipment. Use of the CT scanner and surveying equipment may be offered to researchers and advanced students when available.\n\nFieldwork\n\nDepartment of Anthropology scientific staff members conduct extensive field research throughout the world including archaeological, ethnological, linguistic, and biological anthropological research on a global level. in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Ecuador, Greenland, Greece, Indonesia, Kenya, Korea, Mali, Mexico, and Polynesia, Peru, as well as in various parts of the United States, including California’s Channel Islands and the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nPublications\n\nSmithsonian Contributions to Anthropology, the encyclopedic Handbook of North American Indians, the Arctic Studies Newsletter and Contribution to Circumpolar Anthropology.\n\nEducation and Outreach\n\nAnthropology Department staff engage in outreach and education with community-based archaeology programs for at-risk Indigenous students in Labrador, in providing forensic expertise to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, in hosting interns and fellows, in giving public lectures, and in working with Native American tribes in various parts of North America. Each summer the Department also hosts the Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology (SIMA), a research training program for anthropology graduate students to gain hands-on experience and learn broader and more effective uses of museum collections in anthropological research.\n\nLibraries\n\nThe Anthropology Library, officially known as the John Wesley Powell Library of Anthropology, consists of approximately 85,000 volumes, including more than 400 serials, a large amount of microfilm, and smaller collections of CDs, audiocassettes, etc. The core of the collection is the library of the Bureau of American Ethnology (BAE) established by Congress in 1879 within the Smithsonian to conduct “anthropologic researches among the North American Indians”. In 1965, when the BAE was abolished, its library was joined with those of the NMNH Anthropology divisions.\n\nThe coverage of today’s library collection is broad, including all four subfields of American anthropology, and is research-oriented with an emphasis on material culture. Holdings are especially strong in Native American culture, history, and linguistics for all of North America and the Arctic Rim, with additional materials focusing on Indigenous cultural development in Central and South America. The history of anthropology, especially during its early years in the United States, is also well represented. The last several decades have seen significant growth in Asian cultural history. A diverse body of literature supports research in biological anthropology, especially in skeletal biology, paleopathology, forensics, human origins, and human variation and biocultural adaptation. In addition, the Anthropology Library has research materials on the Near East, Oceania, Africa and the New World diaspora.\n\nPrograms and Partnerships\n\nArctic Studies Center\n\nThe Arctic Studies Center (ASC) was organized in 1988 to establish programs in Arctic and Subarctic anthropology, archaeology and biology. The ASC explores cultures, history and environments of the northern part of the globe, and conducts research throughout the circumpolar region. ASC anthropologists specialize in archaeology, ethnology, ethnohistory and aspects of human-environmental interactions from the Ice Age to modern times. The ASC also investigates modern processes of culture contact and transformation from the perspectives of history, contemporary affairs, demography, geography and ecology. Contact: William W. Fitzhugh Fitzhugh@si.edu\n\nArctic Studies Center – Alaska Office\n\nIn 1993, a branch office of the Arctic Studies Program was opened at the Anchorage Museum of History and Art in Anchorage, AK. The NMNH cares for many thousands of items that represent the cultural heritage of Alaska’s diverse Native peoples, including clothing, tools, basketry, carvings and ceremonial art. The Alaska Office was opened to make these resources more accessible to Alaskan scholars, artists, educators, students, and the general public. In addition to exhibitions and field studies, the Alaska office works with the University of Alaska and with Alaskan museums and culture centers to offer lectures, workshops and courses in cultural research and museum skills. Contact: Aron L. Crowell CrowellA@si.edu\n\nHuman Origins Program\n\nThe Human Origins Program was established in 1985 to investigate the evolution, paleoecology, and behavior of early humans. The program is based on field excavation of hominin sites in Africa and Asia, and seeks to test the effects of ancient environmental variation on hominin activities and geographic distribution. Through international collaboration, data on paleontological and archaeological sites worldwide are brought together to better understand the ecological factors involved in human evolution. An excellent collection of hominid fossil casts and Paleolithic artifacts are maintained for study. Contact: Richard Potts PottsR@si.edu\n\nRepatriation Office\n\nThe Repatriation Office was established in 1991 in response to the National Museum of the American Indian Act. This legislation mandates that the Smithsonian inventories its Native American and Hawaiian collections for human remains, including certain categories of objects, and return them to culturally affiliated groups. Staff members document the physical remains and objects in order to assess their origin, identity and affiliation, and provide recommendations for action. An amendment to the NMAI Act in 1996 broadened the repatriation mandate to include sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony (as defined in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act passed in 1990). Much of the Native American material now held by the museum was collected as a part of archaeological excavations or anthropological expeditions around the U.S. Remains and objects were also transferred to the Smithsonian from other institutions, including the former U.S. Army Medical Museum. A small number of human remains were collected by private individuals, and large numbers of ethnographic objects were acquired from Native people throughout the 19th and 20th centuries by private collectors and Smithsonian anthropologists. To date, over 6,000 sets of remains have been offered for repatriation, and of these 4,400 have been repatriated.

The Department hosts events and activities throughout the year to explore and recognize achievements by the botanical community, including an annual Smithsonian Botanical Symposium.\n\nResearch\n\nResearch in the Department of Botany focuses on plant systematics in the broadest sense: taxonomy, nomenclature, comparative anatomy and morphology, molecular systematics, phylogenetics, evolutionary genomics, diversification, phytogeography, cytology, ecology, evolutionary theory, and economic botany. Staff have organized or otherwise led major floristic studies in diverse parts of the world,focusing on Hawaii, the Marquesas Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the Washington-Baltimore Area, Burma [Myanmar], the Caribbean, the Guianas, and Venezuela. Other research projects are aimed at elucidating phylogeny, evolutionary development, and broad questions of classification. Both modern and fossil species of many plant groups, including algae, mosses, ferns, and flowering plants, are currently being studied.\n\nCollections\n\nThe United States National Herbarium is the major collection resource in the Department. The Herbarium was established in 1848, shortly after the founding (1846) of the Smithsonian Institution. Plants collected during various early government expeditions were first deposited in the National Institute, also known as the National Institution for the Promotion of Science, and later transferred to the newly founded Smithsonian. Of note among these plants were the large collections (50,000 specimens representing 10,000 species) from the U.S. South Pacific Exploring Expedition (1838-1842), under the command of Lt. Charles Wilkes, U.S.N. The earliest botanical expeditions sponsored, in part, by the Smithsonian included the explorations of Texas and New Mexico in 1848 by Charles Wright.\n\nThe U.S. National Herbarium has about 5.1 million specimens collected from throughout the world. Most collections are discoverable online, with high resolution digital images currently available for all pressed specimens. Most of the Herbarium is arranged in an older natural classification system by family and genus, and within each genus according to geographic region, and further alphabetically by species. However, currently the angiosperms are being reorganized to follow the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification system. The collection includes all major plant groups and is among the ten largest herbaria in the world, accounting for about 8% of the plant collection resources in the United States. Most of the specimens in the collection are standard mounted herbarium sheets, although several small collection subsets of fluid preserved specimens exist, as do microslide collections and bulky specimens (i.e., large specimens stored in boxes or trays). The herbarium includes approximately 114,600 inventoried type specimens from all areas of the world but is richest in North American and Tropical American species, with additional strengths in the Philippines, Pacific Islands, and Indian subcontinent. The Department maintains active loan and acquisition programs. Over 25,000 specimens are lent annually to researchers throughout the world and about 20,000 specimens are acquired annually, primarily through exchange and fieldwork.\n\nThe Herbarium maintains several important special collections. The Richard H. Eyde floral microslide collection includes over 21,500 serial sections representing 114 families of flowering plants, with special strengths in Cornaceae, Onagraceae, and Rubiaceae. Other important resources include the Wood Collection housed at the Museum Support Center (MSC) with over 42,500 specimens representing almost 3,000 genera with an additional 6,400 microslides of wood sections. The pollen and spore reference collection includes over 7,500 microslides representing a wide variety of plant families. The bamboo collection is especially diverse. It includes over 37,000 inventoried herbarium specimens, over 3,600 bulky specimens (including large culms, rhizomes, branch complements, and culm cross-sections), 3,000 fluid-stored specimens (mostly leaves), 1,300 floral dissection mounts, 250 dry fruit and seed specimens, 16,000 photographic slides, 600 black and white photo negatives, and 2,000 anatomical slides of serial sections, cross-sections, longitudinal sections, and epidermal scrapes.\n\nPhanerogamic Collection\n\nMany of the plant groups represented in the U.S. National Herbarium rank among the finest and/or largest in the world. A number of flowering plant families such as the Acanthaceae, Asteraceae (Compositae), Bromeliaceae, Commelinaceae, Gesneriaceae, Melastomataceae and Poaceae have benefited from a long history of departmental specialist research and study. Active research is underway in the Araliaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Malvaceae, Onagraceae, Sapindaceae, Vitaceae, Zingiberales, and pteridophytes. Contact: Sue Lutz LutzS@si.edu\n\nCryptogamic Collection\n\nThe cryptogamic collections comprise 750,000 specimens. The lichen herbarium is one of the largest and best curated lichen collections in the world, containing 180,000 specimens. It is especially rich in type material with 2,500 type specimens currently registered. The emphasis of the collection is North American lichens, especially the Parmeliaceae. The lichen collection also contains associated research materials including: microscope slides; chemical extracts; chemical identification plates; and SEM photographs and negatives. The bryophyte collection (311,500 specimens) and pteridophyte collection (ferns and fern allies) (280,000 specimens) also rate as particularly significant, both in terms of size and scientific/historic value. The pteridophyte is the largest collection of ferns and fern allies in the United States, almost certainly the most substantial one in the Americas, and among the most significant in the world. It has seen well over a century of continuous specialist curation. It is arranged to reflect a modern understanding of evolutionary relationships and is fully imaged and inventoried. Contact: Eric Schuettpelz SchuettpelzE@si.edu\n\nAlgal Collection\n\nThe Algal Collection is comprised of marine, estuarine, freshwater, terrestrial (including cave), and airborne algae. The collections have increased dramatically over the past two decades and represent an important resource for the study of tropical and subtropical marine taxa. There are almost 500,000 accessioned and inventoried specimens, including herbarium specimens (172,000), microslides (8,300), liquid preserved material (15,000), and bulky material (21,000). Among the collections are 4,700 type specimens. The collection recently acquired an additional 101,000 specimens, featuring crustose coralline algae. Also part of this collection and maintained separately at the MSC, is the Francis Drouet collection (52,000 specimens) comprised mainly, but not exclusively, of cyanobacteria. The non-articulated coralline algae (22,000), as well as a separate diatom collection (37,000) of freshwater and marine specimens of both recent and fossil origin, also are housed at the MSC. The Algal Collection includes specimens collected from throughout the world, with major holdings from the Gulf of California, Pacific Mexico, southern and central California (including the Channel Islands), the Galapagos Islands, Aldabra Atoll, and the Caribbean (especially Florida, Bahamas, Belize, and Panama). Contact: Barrett Brooks BrooksB@si.edu\n\nU.S. National Fungus Collections\n\nSmithsonian mycological specimens are housed and curated with the U.S. National Fungus Collections, USDA-ARS, in Beltsville, MD. The Smithsonian collections combined with those of the U.S. Department of Agriculture form the world’s largest fungal herbarium, which has an online searchable database.\n\nBotanical Art and Image Collection\n\nThe Department maintains a Botanical Art Collection that serves to document the plant species discovered and described by Smithsonian botanists. The Collection includes over 10,000 works including 5,100 inventoried pieces housed within NMNH. Among the more notable collections are the Margaret Mee paintings, the Frederick A. Walpole drawings and paintings, and the watercolors by M.E. Eaton used to illustrate The Cactaceae (1919-1923) by Britton and Rose. Nearly 2,700 pen and ink drawings, 550 watercolors, and 150 other graphic media are also represented in the collection. An additional 4,200 works are on indefinite loan to the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, including The Hitchcock-Chase Collection of Grass Drawings consisting of 2,713 pieces. The plant images library has over 21,000 photographic images of plant species and their habitats. Contact: Alice Tangerini Tangerin@si.edu\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Department has a microtechnique laboratory equipped for anatomy and cytology, which is staffed and maintained for use by researchers and visiting scientists, and a Digital Imaging Studio equipped with scanners and medium-format digital cameras for high-resolution imaging of specimens. A scientific illustration facility is maintained and has a full-time in-residence staff scientific illustrator. The Department also has a greenhouse complex at the MSC with over 7,000 sq. ft. of growing space that houses a diversity of living research plants, including rich collections of Commelinaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Vitaceae, and Zingiberales, as well as blooming corms of the titan arum, Amorphophallus titanum. The greenhouse facility is available for use by staff and associates in cultivating and studying research plants.\n\nFieldwork\n\nThroughout its history, the Department of Botany has maintained an active field research program in the American tropics but has also undertaken numerous collecting trips on the North American continent and in the Old-World tropics. Areas of concerted fieldwork include Mexico, the Andes, the Caribbean, Pacific Islands, tropical East Africa, and Asia. Often, it is possible to arrange to receive genetic resources, anatomical, cytological or other materials from these expeditions.\n\nCollaborative fieldwork can be arranged with several tropical institutions, such as the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama, the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) in Costa Rica, and the National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) in Hawaii. Research in marine botany, with emphasis on studies of systematics and functional morphology of selected plants, can be undertaken at the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce, Florida, and through the Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems Program (CCRE) at Carrie Bow Cay, Belize.\n\nPublications\n\nThe Smithsonian Contributions to Botany is an externally peer-reviewed periodical produced by the Department. The journal provides a vehicle for disseminating the results of the scientific research at the U.S. National Herbarium, such as longer taxonomic papers, checklists, floras, and monographs. The Index Nominum Genericorum, a listing of generic names in all plant groups, is housed and produced in the Department. The Plant Press, the quarterly newsletter from the Department of Botany and the U.S. National Herbarium, provides information about the activities of the Department including articles about staff research and travel, visitors, and new discoveries.\n\nEducation and Outreach\n\nGraduate studies are available in conjunction with local universities including George Mason University, George Washington University, Howard University, and the University of Maryland at College Park. The Department hosts an annual Smithsonian Botanical Symposium, which brings together the national and international plant systematics community to address a plant-related topic of current significance.\n\nLibrary\n\nThe Botany and Horticulture Library holds over 60,000 volumes and maintains 300 journal subscriptions. The Library includes the Hitchcock Chase Agrostological Library, an outstanding printed resource for the study of Poaceae. The John A. Stevenson Mycological Library, probably the most complete collection of its kind in the United States, is housed with the U.S. National Fungus Collections in Beltsville, MD, but remains part of the Smithsonian library holdings. The John Donnell Smith Botanical Library and the E. Yale Dawson Phycological Library are especially rich in original editions of classical botanical works. Much of the Department’s fine collection of rare books (pre-1840 imprints) is housed separately in the Cullman Library. Field books, field notes, and/or specimen lists made by Smithsonian botanists and colleagues who collected plant specimens for the U.S. National Herbarium are deposited with the Smithsonian Institution Archives (SIA), but most of these materials are available locally. The Department also has large reprint collections, including the Richard H. Eyde collection with its emphasis on plant anatomy and morphology.\n\nPrograms and Partnerships\n\nBiological Diversity of the Guiana Shield\n\nThe Biological Diversity of the Guiana Shield Program (BDG) is a field-oriented program initiated in 1983. The goal of the BDG is to study, document, and preserve the biological diversity of the Guiana Shield area of northeastern South America. Among BDG’s accomplishments is a feasibility study to determine the extent of existing plant and animal collections for use by the government of Guyana in establishing parks and reserves. The program has also produced lists of all known plants in the Kaieteur National Park (Guyana), a plant survey for Iwokrama International Rainforest Reserve (Guyana), the “Checklist of the Plants of the Guianas”, and checklists of birds, mammals, fish, and herpetofauna for use by the Government of Guyana, UNESCO and conservation groups. Contact: Carol Kelloff keloffc@si.edu\n\nPlant Conservation Unit\n\nThe Plant Conservation Unit promotes and coordinates activities and research that focus on plant conservation and endangered plant species. Among other activities, the unit manages an information service by responding to requests and providing information on world plant conservation, threatened species, habitats, and pertinent literature. Contact: Gary Krupnick Krupnick@si.edu\n\nUnited States Botanic Garden\n\nThe Department of Botany has a formal collaboration with the United States Botanic Garden (USBG), bringing together these two institutions that had their common historical 19th century beginnings in the National Institute for the Promotion of Science (1841) and the living and preserved collections resulting from the U.S. South Pacific Exploring Expedition (1838-1842). The USBG is a free-standing institution under the administration of the Architect of the Capitol. The research, field exploration, training, and conservation components provided by the Department in combination with the horticultural and public display elements at the USBG form a highly significant botanical consortium in the Washington area with joint projects on research, botanical exhibition, environmental education, and conservation. Significant collaborations between the two organizations include the Smithsonian Botanical Symposium and the Botanical Partners on the Mall Lecture Series, this last a quarterly event presented at the United States Botanic Garden.\n\nResearch Staff\n\nAcevedo, Pedro, Research Botanist and Curator of Botany (Sapindaceae and Caribbean plants).

The Department consists of staff from four government agencies: the Smithsonian Institution, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Systematic Entomology Laboratory (SEL), Department of Agriculture, National Identification Services, APHIS-PPQ and the U.S. Department of Defense, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (WRBU). This combined community represents, by far, the greatest concentration of entomological expertise in the world.\n\nResearch\n\nResearch in the Department of Entomology is primarily collections-based and focused on systematics in the broadest sense, including basic taxonomy, comparative morphology, and life history of insects, as well as evolutionary and population biology, phylogenetics and phylogenomics, biogeography, biodiversity, ecology, behavior, comparative genomics, and molecular genetic studies.\n\nCollections\n\nThe U.S. National Entomological Collection at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) ranks as probably the largest accessible insect collection in the world with approximately 34 million specimens including over 120,000 primary types plus secondary types. With specimens from worldwide locations, the collections are second to none in coverage for the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. Specimens from the Old World are also well represented, especially from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, China, and Papua New Guinea. Although the bulk of the collection is kept dry, various groups—such as spiders, adult aquatic insects, and insect larvae—are stored in ethanol. There is also an extensive slide collection of aphids, scales, mealybugs, and thrips. The collections are typically arranged taxonomically. Lower taxonomic levels (family, genus, species) are generally arranged alphabetically, and for select orders, e.g. Lepidoptera, further organized by country of origin. For some groups, collections are currently housed off-site as part of the collaborative Off-Site Enhancement Program with other institutions. All families have been recently profiled by storage unit (drawer, jar, slide box) as to their curatorial health. There is an ever expanding image library being built for many groups, especially for the primary type specimens. The collections are supplemented by the Entomological Illustration Archives, totaling over 10,000 illustrations created to support the research publications of Department entomologists and to be available to the external scientific and public communities, as well as the Entomology Original Documents Archives, which are important correspondence, field notes, unpublished research, etc., that are directly tied to specimens in the collection.\n\nThe collections include a very large ectoparasite collection, worldwide in coverage and with important medical and veterinary entomology components: the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) collections of Anoplura and Siphonaptera; the Carriker collection of Mallophaga (containing 650 type specimens of Neotropical species); the K.C. Emerson collection of Mallophaga; the Jellison collection of ectoparasites; the Dalgleish lice collection (including many primary types); and projects sampling mammals in Panama, Venezuela, and Africa have produced large additions to the ectoparasite collections. Contact: Floyd Shockley ShockleyF@si.edu\n\nArachnid Collections – mites, ticks, spiders\n\nAmong the arachnid collections, the largest and most significant is the Acari (mite) Collection, currently housed at the USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Maryland. It is the finest in existence for mites parasitizing humans, animals and plants. The collection includes over 332,000 slides, 14,000 vials and 1,925 primary types. Some of the most important type components include: the collection of H.E. Ewing and I. M. Newell; nearly complete collection of E.W. Baker, C. E. Yunker and A.P. Jacot; important specimens of N. Banks; and type specimens representing all of the new species described by A. Fain from the Congo. The myriapod holdings rate second only to the Acarina, with special strength in New World specimens. The collection contains nearly all of the types of C.H. Bollman, R.V. Chamberlin, O.F. Cook, R.E. Crabill, R.L. Hoffman, H.F. Loomis, and J. McNeill. The Tick Collection (1 million) was acquired by F.C. Bishopp and later combined with the collection of the Rocky Mountain Laboratory of the National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MO, and contains 222 holotypes (26% of the know species in the world). The Tick collection is housed off-site (Georgia Southern University) through the cooperative Off-site Enhancement Program. The Spider Collection counts over 200,000 specimens, mostly from the New World, and has over 300 types. Notable collectors include: N. Banks, R.V. Chamberlin, H. Exline, I. Fox, E.V. Keyserling, G. Marx, A. Petrunkevitch, and E. Simon.\n\nColeoptera Collections – beetles, weevils\n\nThe Coleoptera Collection, numbering about 12 million specimens including 26,000 types, includes adult and immature beetles and is the largest accessible beetle collection in the New World. The NMNH Coleoptera holdings include the historic T.L. Casey Collection, comprised of almost 117,000 specimens representing over 20,000 species, including 9,200 types. Other important material comes from the historic collections of G.H. Dieke and R. Korschefsky (Coccinellidae); F. Monros, D. Blake, I. Lopatin (Chrysomelidae); J.D. Sherman (aquatic Coleoptera); F.F. Tippman (Cerambycidae); O.L. Cartwright (Scarabaeidae and Cicindelinae); and P. Spangler (aquatic Coleoptera). SI and USDA-SEL staff have added significant specimens, including well over 5 million specimens collected from the canopy of Neotropical rain-forests by T. L. Erwin. The collection of beetle larvae and pupae, acquired through the efforts of A.G. Boving, is worldwide in representation and one of the largest in existence. Most Scarabaeidae are housed at the University of Nebraska, State Museum through a cooperative Off-site Enhancement Program. In 2009 the S. L. Wood Bark Beetle collection of over 80,000 specimens, including about 1,200 primary types, was added.\n\nDiptera Collections – flies, mosquitoes\n\nThe collections of Diptera rank among the most extensive in the world, with more than 53,000 species, 3.2 Million pinned specimens, 600,000 slide-mounted specimens, 3,238 jars of vials of specimens in alcohol, and some 26,000 primary type specimens. Several large acquisitions, such as the collections of C.P. Alexander (1,600,000 specimens in 1981), P.H. Arnaud, Jr. (700,000 in 2000), A.L. Melander (250,000 in 1961), J.N. Belkin (250,000 in 1980), S.W. Bromley (35,000 in 1955), A.E. Pritchard (27,000 in 1962), J.P. Duret (14,000 in 1990), L.E. Rozeboom (12,000 in 1998) as well as the collections of C.H.T. Townsend (Oestroidea), R.H. Painter (Bombyliidae) and C.F. Baker (1928, Philippine Diptera) greatly expanded coverage and added a considerable number of specimens. The collection is part of active research globally and holds important collections, especially in Tipulidae, Culicidae, Cecidomyiidae, Stratiomyidae, Bombyliidae, Asilidae, Empididae, Syrphidae, Tephritidae, Chloropidae, Sciomyzidae, Lauxaniidae, Coelopidae, Aulacigastridae, Canacidae, Ephydridae, Tachinidae, Sarcophagidae, Muscidae, and Calliphoridae. The Department serves as the world center for mosquito research through study by WRBU, who have described well over 100 new species of mosquitoes. The Mosquito Collection counts more than 750,000 pinned specimens including 1,200 primary types located at the MSC in Suitland, MD. The Bombyliidae, Pipunculidae, and Lauxanoidea are currently taken care of by other researchers in the Off-site Collection Enhancement Program (Bishop Museum, Canadian National Collection, and California Department of Food and Agriculture, respectively).\n\nHemiptera Collections – true bugs, cicadas, aphids, whiteflies, psyllids\n\nThe Hemiptera Collection (Heteroptera plus Homoptera) is the largest in the world and is located at the NMNH (NHB and MSC) and at BARC (USDA). Although New World holdings predominate, the Old World holdings are rapidly expanding. The collection incorporates many important private collections including: A.C. Baker, H.G. Barber, C.K. Brian, T.D.A. Cockerell, C.J. Drake (including the H. Hacker, M.S. Pennington, C.E. Reed collections), A. Fitch, W.D. Funkhouser, F.W. Goding, H.M. Harris, F.C. Hottes, H.H. Knight, N.A. Kormilev, W.L. McAtee, T. Pergande, P.R. Uhler, R. A. Poisson, and, more recently, the J.T. Polhemus collection of aquatic and semi-aquatic Heteroptera, the J. Maldonado collection of Miridae and Reduviidae, a large part of the R. M. Baranowski collection of Lygaeoidea and the W. Ullrich collection. The Whitefly Collection (Aleyrodidae) is one of the world’s best collections, with over 32,500 microscope slide-mounts representing more than 1,100 species, and an extensive collection of dry preserved material. The collection includes more than 300 primary types. The Psyllid Collection includes both pinned (more than 20,000) and slide-mounted (more than 5,000) specimens which include more than 300 primary types. The Aphidoidea Collection contains more than 90,000 slides representing over 2,400 species. The subset Aphid Collection contains primary type material for 747 species which includes 1,380 primary type slides. The Coccoidea Collection (scale insects) consists of over 146,000 slides and has more than 280 primary types as well as a large collection of unmounted dry material containing several million specimens.\n\nHymenoptera Collections – ants, bees, wasps\n\nThe Hymenoptera collection numbers over 4 million specimens, mostly from the Western Hemisphere but with increasing representation from Africa and Asia. Currently, over 15,700 primary types are deposited here. The Hymenoptera collection contains about 95% of described hymenopteran families and about 75% of described genera. Notable collectors include W. Brodie, A. W. Stelfox, D.R. Smith, M.R. Smith, W.M. Mann, T. Pergande, and W. Ashmead, but a more comprehensive list can be found in the 1976 “The United States National Entomological Collections.” Recent notable acquisitions include the collections of M. Wing (ants), M. Talbot (ants), A. Van Pelt (ants, general), J.F. Watkins (army ants), R. Copeland (African Hymenoptera), and J. Shorthouse (rose gall wasps and their parasitoids), as well as large numbers of specimens generated by the coordinated field work of the current cohort of research entomologists. Currently the most actively researched groups are the Aculeata (ants, bees, stinging wasps), Symphyta (sawflies), Ichneumonoidea, and Proctotrupomorpha.\n\nIsoptera, Orthoptera, Thysanoptera Collections – termites, grasshoppers & crickets, thrips\n\nThe Termite (Isoptera) Collection has 240,000 specimens and is the second largest in the world, including 1,150 of the known 2,000 species, and 943 types. The Grasshoppers, Katydids, Crickets (Orthoptera) have about 400,000 specimens—perhaps the 3rd largest collection in the world, about 3,000 species, and with 793 types. The Thrips (Thysanoptera) have 108,722 slides, and 1,118 types. These collections are located at the MSC in Maryland.\n\nLepidoptera Collections – butterflies, moths\n\nThe Lepidoptera Collection has 2.9 million pinned and labeled specimens, including about 25,000 primary types. There are about 3,000 alcohol jars with immature stages. The collection has the most complete representation of both larvae (123,000 specimens) and adults in the Western Hemisphere. Included are about 100,000 microscope slides, mainly of moth genitalia. The collection is particularly rich in Nearctic and Neotropical species as well as Palearctic material for most families. The Microlepidoptera collection contains excellent coverage of Far Eastern species. Important holdings include: W. Barnes (450,000 pinned specimens), A. Blanchard (60,000), A.E. Brower (115,000), P. Dognin (50,000), D.C. Ferguson (50,000), M. Gentili (12,000), S. Issiki (16,000), E. Jackh (55,000), F. M. Jones (10,000), A. Kawabe (22,000), S. Nicolay (100,000), J. Robert (40,000), and G. B. Small (25,000). Other important Insecta order holdings include Trichoptera, Plecoptera, Neuroptera, Mecoptera, Odonata.\n\nFacilities\n\nBoth dry and wet collections are housed in new, airtight, pest-proof, metal specimen cabinets, about half of which are on electric compactors. The collections are enhanced by specially constructed alcohol (wet collection) storage rooms and facilities for housing reprint libraries. Modern chemical storage facilities, equipment and supplies are stored in compactor systems, walk-in and reach-in freezers, critical point dryers, and ventilated sorting center all support state-of-the-art collections care. The Department has state-of-the-art digital photographic stations for use by staff, researchers and visitors. The Entomology Molecular Systematics Laboratory, a shared facility managed by WRBU at the Museum Support Center, is also available for research investigations, in addition to the molecular facilities of the Smithsonian’s Laboratory of Analytical Biology.\n\nFieldwork\n\nField studies are conducted in many parts of the United States, Mexico, Central and South America, the Asia-Pacific region, and, to a lesser extent, in Europe, Africa, and Australia. Museum entomologists currently participate in long-term biodiversity survey projects in Costa Rica (Arthropods of La Selva), Dominican Republic, Leaf Litter Arthropods of Mesoamerica, Peru, Guyana, Papua New Guinea, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and Kenya, among others. Past and present major projects in Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Peru, Madagascar, and Papua New Guinea have yielded millions of specimens for research. A series of canopy-fogging projects in Central and South America, initiated in 1974, has produced nearly 9 million specimens.\n\nPublications\n\nMembers of the Department traditionally serve as officers of the Entomological Society of Washington, which publishes the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington and the Memoirs of the Entomological Society of Washington. Departmental staff also serve as editors of the Journal of the International Society of Hymenopterists, Insect Conservation and Diversity, ZooKeys, etc., as well as on editorial boards of many other journals around the world.\n\nEducation and Outreach\n\nThe Department of Entomology has a proven history of training postdoctoral researchers as well as graduate and undergraduate students with special partnerships through the Smithsonian-USDA-University of Maryland MCSE (Maryland Center for Systematic Entomology) program. Members of the Department participate in Bioblitzes locally and elsewhere in the country.\n\nLibrary\n\nThe Entomology Library contains over 23,000 volumes, including 120 journal subscriptions on insect systematics, ecology, behavior, and related areas. The collection is especially rich in the areas of taxonomy and anatomy of insects and related arthropods, especially arachnids.\n\nPrograms and Partnerships\n\nMaryland Center for Systematic Entomology (MCSE)\n\nFounded in 1981, the MCSE is a consortium for research and training in the systematics of insects and allied groups. Graduate students are enrolled in the Department of Entomology, University of Maryland, with a Smithsonian or USDA-SEL scientist as co-advisor. Research focus includes tropical biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, behavior, molecular systematics, and systematic methods, in addition to the systematics and biogeography of virtually all the major groups of terrestrial arthropods.
