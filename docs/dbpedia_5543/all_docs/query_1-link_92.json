        "text": "Did you hear the one about the mob banker and the serial embellisher?\n\nNo, that's not the setup to a joke; it's a description of the Illinois senate race. Of the 37 senate contests taking place across America this year, the race between Democrat Alexi Giannoulias and Republican Mark Kirk and might be the nastiest, most unappealing race of all. But it might also be the most consequential.\n\nAll of this is an unexpected bitter pill for Democrats. Two years ago, when Illinois' newest favourite son carried the state by 25 points to win the presidency, and Illinois Democrats swept demoralised Republicans from every statewide office, it was inconceivable the party would have trouble filling Barack Obama's open seat just two short years later.\n\nBut then came the Blagojevich scandal, impeachment and corruption trial. Then came the financial crisis, the stimulus, and healthcare. And, most importantly, then came the primary.\n\nAgainst some Democrats' better judgment – and due in no small part to pressure from David Axelrod, Rahm Emanuel and President Obama – the party cleared the decks for the young, inexperienced and fatally flawed Alexi Giannoulias. A late, underfunded bid by David Hoffman still nearly managed to defeat Giannoulias, who exited the primary with an anemic 39% of the vote.\n\nGiannoulias has proven to be every bit as problematic a candidate as expected, struggling to this day to provide convincing answers to questions about his involvement in millions of dollars of loans made to convicted mob bosses and political influence peddlers during his tenure as a senior loan officer at his family bank.\n\nOne reason this race remains as competitive as it is, however, is because Republican Mark Kirk has turned out to be nearly as problematic a candidate as Giannoulias.\n\nNever a favourite of the conservative base to begin with, Kirk's vote in favour of cap-and-trade legislation in the house in 2009 caused a grassroots revolt that nearly killed his bid in the cradle. Kirk finessed his way through the primary, and when he won a convincing 57% of the vote in a six-way race among more conservative candidates, Republicans felt like they had settled on a winner.\n\nBut then came a series of revelations that Kirk had embellished aspects of his military record. Over the next few months, Republican strategists watched in horror as Kirk managed the near-impossible task of taking a major political asset – a distinguished career in the United States Navy – and turning it into a stinging indictment of his character and integrity.\n\nIn recent weeks, Kirk has tried to defuse the issue by apologising and taking responsibility for the mistakes. According to the latest Chicago Tribune poll, it appears to be working, as Kirk has improved his favourable ratings and his support among independent voters over the last month. Kirk currently holds a small but stable lead in the RealClearPolitics average of the most recent polls, though all polls are within the margin of error.\n\nAs with all close races, this contest will come down to a battle of turnout. Illinois remains a \"blue\" state, and Giannoulias will need heavy turnout in Cook County to offset a highly energised Republican electorate that appears ready to flex its muscles in the suburbs and downstate.\n\nDemocrats have already braced themselves for what everyone assumes will be an awful night on 2 November. But many privately fret that watching Barack Obama's senate seat get washed away by a GOP wave will be the ultimate humiliation."
