Separately, the Chicago-based bank has filed suit in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court to collect $10.4 million on a 45-rooom South Beach hotel and shuttered restaurant in Hollywood, Fla., which are owned by ventures that include the duo.\n\nThis Week's Crain's >\n\nSuits awaken old ghosts for Giannoulias\n\nBy: Thomas A. Corfman July 13, 2009\n\nPOLITICAL LIABILITY? As state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias prepares to run for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, questions are surfacing again about loans made several years ago by his family-owned Broadway Bank to two Chicago crime figures.\n\nBroadway Bank is trying to recoup $12.9 million from two Chicago crime figures, rekindling a controversy as the bank's former chief loan officer, state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, gears up to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn recently filed foreclosure suits, the Giannoulias family-owned North Side bank alleges loan defaults by four companies whose owners include two convicted Chicago bookmakers — one also convicted of promoting a nationwide prostitution ring. The loans are on a hodgepodge of properties, including a South Beach hotel and a South Side shopping center that has lost its grocery anchor. The defendants include 1201 South Western LLC, a Berwyn-based company whose activities include making short-term real estate loans at interest rates of 1% a week, property records show.\n\nMichael Giorango\n\nQuestions about Mr. Giannoulias' role in the loans surfaced in 2006, when he overcame concerns about his youth and inexperience to be elected treasurer. He defended the loans as sound business decisions, a claim undermined by the foreclosures.\n\nNow, at age 33, he could face similar questions, particularly if there are more disclosures about the relationship between the convicted felons and Broadway.\n\nMichael Giorango\n\n\"In a closely contested race, something like this can marginalize enough votes to put you out of the race,\" says political consultant Thom Serafin, president of Chicago-based communications firm Serafin & Associates Inc., who also notes criticism of Mr. Giannoulias' oversight of a state-run college savings fund. \"All of that lends itself to a credibility gap, and that's where an opponent gets you.\"\n\nMr. Giannoulias' chances of winning the 2010 Democratic Senate primary got a boost last week when Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan announced she would run for re-election rather than campaign for senator or governor. A spokesman for Mr. Giannoulias declines to comment.\n\nMr. Giannoulias hasn't announced his Senate candidacy formally, but he has raised $1.1 million, giving him an early edge in a primary fight to succeed Roland Burris. Other potential Democratic candidates include Christopher Kennedy, a Chicago real estate executive and son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy, and Cheryle Jackson, president and CEO of the non-profit Chicago Urban League. On the Republican side, possible candidates include U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk and businessman Andy McKenna Jr., chairman of the state GOP.\n\n1201 S. Western Ave. 8,300-square-foot building on the Near West Side\n\n\"The borrowers were worthy at the time these loans were issued,\" Broadway Bank says in a statement. \"However, when they failed to make their loan payments, the bank took legal action . . ., just as it would do in any situation involving a customer who did not repay a loan.\"\n\nBroadway alleges $2.9 million in loans are in default on the Lorraine Hotel in Miami Beach. The property is owned by a venture that includes Michael Giorango, 56, who was convicted in 1991 of federal bookmaking charges in Chicago. He also was convicted in 2004 in Miami of promoting a nationwide prostitution operation.\n\nMichael GiorangoBroadway also alleges that a nearly $6-million loan is in default on a shuttered restaurant along the Intracoastal Waterway in Hollywood, Fla. The potential development site is owned by a venture that includes Mr. Giorango and Demitri Stavropoulos, 41, who was convicted in 2004 in Chicago of running a betting operation that grossed more than $3 million in about three years.\n\nThe venture fought the foreclosure case, accusing the bank of improperly obstructing a sale of the property. Including fees and unpaid interest, the total amount due is almost $10.4 million, according to the complaint filed March 30 in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court.\n\nAn attorney for Mr. Stavropoulos declines to comment.\n\nMr. Giorango, reached at a Los Angeles apartment building that he owns in a venture with Mr. Stavropoulous, also declines to comment. Broadway has a $3.4-million loan on the 30-unit property that comes due next year.\n\n11414 S. Halsted St. Mostly vacant, 170,500-square-foot retail center in Morgan Park\n\nThe venture that owns the apartment building, 1201 South Western, is a defendant in four foreclosure cases filed by Broadway last month in Cook County Circuit Court seeking to collect nearly $2.5 million. In addition to its real estate holdings, the venture has been an active lender, making 43 short-term loans totaling $6.9 million, an average of $160,500 per loan, property records show. Broadway financed the company on Dec. 21, 2004, a month after 1201 South Western made the first in a series of loans that continued through July 2006, the records indicate.\n\nInterest rates could be obtained on just eight of the loans, totaling $800,000, which are the subject of collection cases. On those loans, the company charged interest of about 1% a week, according to the promissory notes.\n\nOpponent questions Giannoulias connections to mobThursday, September 28, 2006\n\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bw7MdcXyAaoJ:abclocal.go.com/wls/story%3Fsection%3Dnews/local%26id%3D4609432+Alexi+Giannoulias+mob+connections+Alexi+Giannoulias+Broadway+Bank&cd=6&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\n\nBy Andy Shaw\n\nSeptember 28, 2006 (WLS) -- New questions were raised Thursday about a political candidate's alleged connections to organized crime. Alexi Giannoulias is a Democrat running for Illinois state treasurer. His Republican opponent, Christine Radogno, is asking these questions. But she isn't the only one.\n\nPolitical newcomer Alexi Giannoulias is not only facing Republican Christine Ragogno in the state treasurer's race, he is also battling with the chairman of his own Democratic party, House Speaker Michael Madigan, who agrees with Radogno that Giannoulias hasn't provided the right answers to questions abut loans from his family bank to unsavory characters.\n\nThe Democratic candidate for state treasurer, Chicago banker Alexi Giannoulias, is still facing the same questions he has been answering for months about multi-million dollar loans from his family-owned Broadway Bank to convicted felons with mob ties. Some of the questions are coming from his Republican opponent, state senator Christine Radogno of southwest suburban LaGrange.\n\n\"Clearly, he is the banker for people with mob associations, and, yeah, I don't think there's any question about that,\" said Christine Radogno, (R)-nominee for state treasurer.\n\nRodogno is getting unexpected help in fueling the controversy from the chairman of Giannoulias's own Democratic party, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, who refuses to endorse Giannoulias and won't even put his picture on the party's campaign web site.\n\n\"I want some answers. The allegations are there,\" Madigan said earlier this week. \"My history in politics, if you were alleged to be connected to the mob, you were done. But life seems to go on.\"\n\nGiannoulias says that banks don't do criminal background checks of prospective clients, his bank has never been accused of any wrongdoing by federal regulators, and he would explain all of that to Madigan, if the party chairman would return his phone calls.\n\n\"The federal government looks at every loan in our portfolio and we've done nothing wrong. From day one, people have said we'd done nothing wrong, but it's politics and people are gonna make stories up,\" said Alexi Giannoulias, (D)-nominee for state treasurer.\n\nThe rest of the Democratic party is supporting Giannoulias, including Senator Barack Obama, the political superstar whose campaign commercial helped Giannoulias defeat the Madigan-backed candidate in the Democratic primary, and state representative John Fritchey says Madigan should meet with Giannoulias to clear the air.\n\n\"I would hope that we would have gotten these issues resolved by now, but if we haven't, we really should get it done before the election comes around,\" said State Rep. John Fritchey, (D)-Chicago.\n\nMadigan was not available Thursday, and a spokesman says he won't be meeting with Giannoulias because that won't accomplish anything. Political observers speculate that Madigan may see Giannoulias as a threat to his daughter Lisa, the attorney general, if she eventually runs for governor.\n\nMeanwhile. Barack Obama is ready to help Giannoulias in any way he can, despite the feud with Madigan.\n\nPOWER PLAY EXCLUSIVE: Host of Giannoulias Hollywood Fundraiser has Mob Ties\n\nby Jake Gibson September 17, 2010\n\nEXCLUSIVE, as first reported in Chris Stirewalt's Power Play newsletter in Fox News' new AEHQ iPhone app.\n\nOne of the hosts of a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser for Illinois Democratic Senate nominee Alexi Giannoulias last week has ties to organized crime.\n\nGiannoulias attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles last Tuesday, where one of the hosts was Pamela Abdy, who has also contributed the maximum $4,800 to the Giannoulias campaign.\n\nIn 2007, Abdy was identified by federal investigators as the girlfriend of a married New Jersey mobster nabbed on charges he led a multi-billion-dollar illegal gambling ring.\n\nGiannoulias aides said Abdy is no mobster and dismissed questions about her involvement as part of an orchestrated series of Republican attacks on the candidate's character.\n\nGiannoulias has fought allegations of mob connections throughout his campaign for the Senate seat once held by President Obama. Republican foe Mark Kirk has hammered Giannoulias for $20 million in loans his family's bank made to convicted mobster Michael \"Jaws\" Giorango while the now candidate was the chief loan officer from 2004 to 2007.\n\nBroadway Bank, since shuttered by federal regulators for insufficient holdings, is also reported to have made several other loans to mob figures, but the Giannoulias campaign insists that all client relationships with mob figures were managed by the candidate's brother and father.\n\nFor Giannoulias fundraiser Abdy, the organized crime ties go back to New Jersey, not Chicago.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, in 2007 Abdy was captured on wiretaps talking with her former boyfriend, reputed Lucchese family mobster Joseph \"Little Joe\" Perna, who complained to her about trying to collect a $105,738 gambling debt but only coming up with $25,000.\n\nThe conversations were part of an arrest affidavit that preceded the roundup of Perna and more than two dozen other reputed Lucchese associates and members. Abdy's uncle, former Lucchese New Jersey boss Martin Taccetta, was also arrested.\n\nThe group was charged with running a gambling ring that raked in $2.2 billion in 15 months and used violent tactics to collect gaming debts. Perna was indicted this year on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering and bribery.\n\nGiannoulias aides told FOX News that Abdy was not arrested for anything and was never even investigated. Those same aides point out that Abdy is an award-winning executive at Paramount Pictures, no longer romantically linked with Perna and that it's not fair to lump her in with her mobster uncle.\n\nCommunications director for Giannoulias, Kathleen Strand, called the story, \"another ridiculous lie being pushed by Congressman Kirk's desperate campaign. His earlier attacks have been called out as false by independent fact check organizations, and this one will find the same resting place.\"\n\nKirk spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski responded, \"The facts speak for themselves. As Senior Loan Officer at Broadway Bank, Alexi Giannoulias made loans to organized crime figures. Now we learn he's raising money from people with similar track records. The truth is that Alexi Giannoulias' association with mobsters and crime figures prove he lacks the judgment to serve in the United States Senate.\"\n\nRead more: http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/09/17/power-play-exclusive-host-giannoulias-hollywood-fundraiser-has-mob-ties#ixzz1210UvFo1\n\nhttp://therealbarackobama.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/evelyn-pringles-operation-board-games-and-curtain-time-for-obama/\n\nby Evelyn Pringle April 19, 2008 - 9:33am\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe investigation dubbed \"Operation Board Games,\" into the influence peddling within the cesspool of corruption that encompasses Illinois politicians from both major parties, has developed into multiple subplots, many of which feature Barack Obama.\n\nTherefore, Obama should start bidding for the starring role in the movie that is sure to follow the criminal trials involved in this case because he has absolutely no chance of winning the White House, even if the leaders of the Democratic party allow this sorry charade to carry on and his name appears on the ballot.\n\nThe major media organizations continue to ignore a story that is destined to become the biggest political scandal of the decade, except for a bleep here and there. By now this can only mean one of two things. They are either unwilling to commit the manpower necessary to connect the dots of all the subplots or they know the Republicans will supply the goods free of charge the minute Obama becomes the nominee.\n\nThis two-part article is the last article in a 3-part series. The first two, Barack Obama - The Wizard of Oz and Barack Obama - Operation Board Games For Slumlords, cover Obama's rise to fame in the political mafia of Illinois, bankrolled by the now infamous Syrian-born influence peddler, Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko.\n\nThey also give the details of Obama's involvement in a slumlord business largely operating out of the Chicago-based Davis, Miner & Barnhill law firm, which hired Obama in 1993, with his boss, Allison Davis, reaping in the profits with Rezko's development company, Rezmar.\n\nThe \"Board Games For Slumlord\" article gives in-depth details of the federal investigation along with the names of people who are listed as \"Co-Schemers\" and \"Individuals\" in the indictments issued thus far. Therefore for the most part, this article will refer to all the scams collectively as what prosecutors refer to as \"pay-to-play\" schemes.\n\nThe mainstream media continues to refer to the corruption trial currently taking place in a Federal courthouse in Chicago as the Rezko case, never mentioning the fact that Rezko is sitting in the courtroom alone at the defendant's table only because many of the co-defendants have already pleaded guilty, or have not been indicted yet...\"\n\n\"Rezko is widely known to be a bipartisan influence peddler. During his opening statement, Rezko's lead defense attorney, Joseph Duffy, told the jury that Rezko raised money for Democrats and Republicans alike, such as former Cook County Board President, John Stroger, and Representative Luis Gutierrez, Democrats, and former Governor Jim Edgar, a Republican, along with current Governor Rod Blagojevich and Obama, both Democrats.\n\nDuffy told the jurors that Rezko \"met Barack Obama when he was in Harvard Law School and tried to hire him\" to be the lawyer for his development company. During 2003 and 2004, he said, Rezko helped organize fundraisers for both President Bush and Obama\n\nPersons who have avoided trial in the Board Games case by pleading guilty to corruption charges include the government's star witness, Stewart Levine, a Chicago businessman who had been a major fundraiser for Republicans in Illinois for decades, including Bush.\n\nLevine was the first defendant nailed in the Board Games investigation. The FBI confronted him four years ago on May 20, 2004, and although he was cooperating with the Feds for some time, he did not enter an official guilty plea until October 2006.\n\nDefendants who pleaded guilty as early as September 2005, include Chicago attorney, Steve Loren, a lawyer for the teacher's retirement pension fund, Joseph Cari, an attorney and former finance chairman for the national Democratic National Committee, and Jacob Kiferbaum, owner of a Chicago area construction company.\n\nSeveral other people listed in the indictments are testifying under a grant of immunity from prosecution. The jury has been made aware that if the people who have pleaded guilty or been granted immunity are caught lying under oath in court, all deals are off.\n\nOn October 11, 2006, the US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Patrick Fitzgerald, issued a press release to finally announce the unsealing of two indictments charging \"Chicago area businessman and political fundraiser Antoin Rezko in connection with two separate and extensive fraud schemes.\"\n\nThe press release noted that Rezko, \"who, in addition to owning pizza and fast food restaurant franchises in Illinois and Wisconsin, developed real estate and was involved in political fund-raising in Illinois, was added as a new defendant in a pending federal corruption case that was brought against Levine and others last year.\"\n\nThe first indictment alleged that Rezko participated in a scheme to obtain millions of dollars by shaking down firms doing business before two Illinois regulatory boards, the Teachers Retirement System (TRS) and the Hospital Facilities Planning Board, on which Levine served. In the press release, Fitzgerald stated:\n\n\"This indictment describes a frenzy of corrupt scheming, particularly in April and May 2004, in which political insiders sought to manipulate the activities of two state boards to fleece investment firms and individuals. The defendants and their associates put the word out loud and clear: you have to pay to play in Illinois.\"\n\nFitzgerald further reported that, \"Cari and Loren, both formerly prominent Chicago lawyers, each pleaded guilty in the pending TRS fraud case. Kiferbaum, a suburban construction executive, pleaded guilty in the pending Planning Board case.\"\n\n\"All three are cooperating with the government and awaiting sentencing,\" the release said.\n\n\"This basically involved a pay to play scheme on steroids,\" Fitzgerald told reporters.\n\nAllison Davis, Obama's boss at the law firm, is also listed in legal documents as playing a part in setting up a major extortion attempt in the Board Games case.\n\nIn court filings, the government also discusses plans by the schemers to use the State Board of Investments, which invests pension funds for state employees, and the State University Retirement System, which invests pension funds for state university workers, to obtain kickbacks from companies wanting to do business with the pension funds.\n\nIn fact, several kickback schemes were already set up when Levine was confronted by the FBI, and failed only because he could not follow through with the deals.\n\nThe second indictment unsealed on October 11, 2006, alleges that Rezko fraudulently obtained more than $10 million in loans for a pizza restaurant business from General Electric Capital Corp. Due to the complex nature of the two indictments, the loan fraud case will be discussed in Part II of \"Subplots of Operation Board Games.\"\n\nThe indictments issued so far point to only two politicians as specifically getting money from kickbacks resulting from the Board Games' schemes: Governor Rod Blagojevich and Barack Obama. Twenty thousand dollars from the first pay-off was funneled to Obama through a bank account belonging to the pizza businesses.\n\nWhen Rezko was asked whether he was considering cooperating with the government and testifying against others as part of a plea bargain, he laughed loud and long and said, \"Hell, no,\" according to a report by James Merriner in the November 2007, Chicago Magazine.\n\n\"Tell them I'll see them in court,\" he told Merriner.\n\nRezko has now been seen in court for about a month and a half. The Chicago Tribune has two reporters, Bob Secter and Jeff Coen, covering the trial at the Federal courthouse in Chicago and every few hours they post excellent highlights of the testimony on \"Gavel-to-Gavel\" which can be followed in this Tribune Rezko court blog.\n\nCredit for much of the testimony cited in this article belongs to the diligent efforts of Sector and Coen in covering the trial. Facts and evidence offered by the government that is cited comes from the indictments, motions, briefs and other court filings.\n\nStuart Levine was a member of both the TRS board and the Planning Board when Blagojevich took office. During his opening statement, Rezko's lead defense attorney, James Duffy, pointed out that Levine backed a Republican in the 2002 governor's race and said Levine realized \"he bet on the wrong horse,\" when Blagojevich won.\n\n\"Mr. Inside was now on the outside,\" he told the jury. \"His ego could not handle it.\"\n\nHe also made a point to mention that Levine had close political ties to Obama and other Illinois politicians.\n\nAccording to Duffy, the reason Levine started making up stories about having ties to Blagojevich and people close to the governor was to give off the impression of power.\n\nThe jury might have found that feeble excuse for a motive a tad credible if not for the fact that documentary evidence was produced to prove that Blagojevich, along with his campaign manager, David Wilhelm, his other campaign fundraisers, and high ranking Illinois officials, including Obama, specifically approved Levine's re-appointment to the Planning Board.\n\nStuart Levine was on the stand for over two weeks, singing like a canary, hoping to reduce what could have been a life sentence to less than 6 years.\n\nDuffy used up a good portion of his cross-examination exploiting the fact that Levine was an admitted dope fiend who, in addition to swindling every buck he could with the help of corrupt politicians for his entire life, spent much of his spare time partying at motels with a group that Duffy constantly referred to as \"male friends.\"\n\nHowever, after reading all the testimony posted on Gavel-to-Gavel, the only point clearly established is that Levine footed the bill for the parties and would put a bonifide street junkie to shame. While on the stand, Levine admitted again and again to taking a litany of drugs including cocaine, qualudes, ecstasy, crystal meth and an animal tranquilizer.\n\nDuffy drilled away at this issue and at times it became downright amusing. For instance, at one point Duffy asked Levine whether Levine's secretary could hear him snorting drugs through the closed door of his office, and Levine replied: \"If my snorting was so loud that you could hear me through a wall or door, I'm quite amazed at the loudness of my snorting.\"\n\nThus far, jurors have also heard damaging testimony about how the scheme was carried out from the chairman of the Health Facilities Planning Board, Thomas Beck, and Imad Almanaseer, one of three doctors who were appointed to the panel to help rig the votes.\n\nThe first two articles in this series reported that Blagojevich was supposed to be the candidate for President, not Obama. That assertion was based on testimony in the trial by the government's star witness, Stuart Levine, about conversations he had with Rezko.\n\nThat one of the main goals of the \"pay-to-play\" schemes was to raise money for a presidential run by Blagojevich was collaborated by testimony on April 15, 2008, by Joseph Cari.\n\nHe told the jury about a conversation he had with Blagojevich himself in 2003, in which Blagojevich told him that it would be easer for him to raise money then a senator because now that he was governor, Blagojevich had the power to hand out contracts and state business to people who contributed to his campaign.\n\nCari also testified that Blagojevich tried to convince him to lead the national fund raising efforts for his presidential bid but Cari did not want the job.\n\nBlagojevich also told Cari that Rezko and his other major fundraiser, Christopher Kelly, were the two people he trusted most and apparently would follow Blagojevich to Washington. \"They were going to be the key people in his public-service career, wherever it went,\" Cari said.\n\nCari also told the jury about meetings he had with Rezko and Kelly in 2004, at which they pressured Cari to lead the national fundraising operation for Blagojevich in exchange for receiving legal work, consultant work or pension fund business from the state.\n\n\"I could have whatever I wanted, but they needed help nationally to raise money,\" he told the jury. Cari maintains that he repeatedly said no to their requests.\n\nCampaign finance laws in Illinois have aided and abetted influence peddling schemes for years because they allow donors to give as much as they like to candidates running for state office, so the sky's the limit.\n\nObama's political career was bankrolled by the same gang that planned to make Blagojevich president. For instance, Fortunee Massuda, another participant identified in the \"pay-to-play\" schemes, contributed $25,000 to Blagojevich compared to $2,000 to Obama. Michel Malek, another participant, threw $25,000 to Blagojevich and $10,500 to Obama.\n\nAli Ata, another guy listed as a co-schemer in one indictment, was made executive director of the Illinois Finance Authority, and he contributed $25,000 to Blagojevich and $5,000 to Obama.\n\nJay Wilton, identified by prosecutors as a major contributor to Blagojevich, is the owner of Wilton Partners, a construction company in California. He donated $50,000 to Blagojevich shortly after his firm cinched an $83 million contract with the state to refurbish the Illinois tollway's oasis rest stops. Wilton also gave $5,000 to Obama.\n\nJoe Cari donated $15,000 to Blagojevich but only gave $1,335 to Obama.\n\nA trial exhibit produced by an FBI agent, identifies major contributors who donated $1.43 million to Blagojevich between 2001 and 2004. The Chicago Sun-Times compared the exhibit to government campaign records on Obama and found he received more than $220,000 from many of the same donors between 2001 and 2004.\n\nJohn Roger, the head of Ariel Capital, an investment firm that ended up with major money from the pension funds, is on the FBI's summary of Blagojevich's top contributors. He also gave Obama $25,000.\n\nRogers is a member of the finance committee for Obama's presidential campaign. Rogers also served on the campaign finance committee for Obama's US Senate run with Tony and Rita Rezko, Allison Davis, and Myron \"Mike\" Cherry.\n\nMike Cherry is listed in the indictment for the pay-to-pay schemes and the FBI shows he gave Blagojevich $25,000 in 2003.\n\nDaniel Mahru, a major player in the Chicago slumlord racket, has reportedly flipped in the Board Games case and is cooperating with the prosecution. He is the owner of Automatic Ice Company, which donated $10,000 to Blagojevich. Mahru gave $5,000 to Obama.\n\nAttorney, Jack Carriglio, contributed $25,000 to Blagojevich and was appointed to the TRS Board. He also gave $1000 to Obama.\n\nAfter Rezko's indictment was unsealed in October 2006, the first report in the Chicago Tribune noted, \"Obama donated $11,500 to charity -- a total that represents what Rezko contributed to the senator's federal campaign fund.\"\n\nThat statement intentionally leads readers to believe that Obama donated all campaign contributions from Rezko to charity, which is so far from the truth that it's laughable.\n\nOn November 5, 2006, the Tribune reported that, Obama said Rezko raised as much as $60,000 for him during his political career. The next day, the Sun-Times quoted Obama as saying: \"I did however donate campaign contributions from Rezko to charity.\"\n\nThe Obama camp stuck with the $50,000 or $60,000 story for nearly a year until Obama's March 14, 2008 interviews with the Chicago Sun-Times and Tribune and the team of reporters pinned him down and the amount added up to $250,000.\n\nFor decades, the \"pay-to-play\" schemes exposed by the Board Games case have been standard conduct for politicians in Illinois, Republicans and Democrats alike, creating a vicious circle. Officials cannot get elected without the contributions of the corrupt influence peddlers and the crooks cannot fund the campaigns without the pay-offs.\n\nIn a January 11, 2006, report by Better Government Association, the groups Executive Director, Jay Stewart, stated: \"Illinois is awash in scandal and corruption.\"\n\n\"Former Governor George Ryan is on trial, Governor Blagojevich's administration is the subject of numerous investigations, and the Hired Truck scandal has resulted in dozens of guilty pleas and indictments in Mayor Daley's City Hall. A common thread with all these scandals is questionable campaign contributions, contracts and hiring.\"\n\nThe most alarming indication that the corruption in Illinois will never end is the fact that the schemes continued on at full-throttle at a time when the same team of Federal prosecutors, led by Patrick Fitzgerald, was arresting people left and right as a result of an eight year investigation of the last Governor, George Ryan.\n\nThe guilty pleas of Steven Loren and Joe Cari in the Board Games case came just days before jury selection was scheduled to being for a trial in which Ryan was facing a 22-count indictment with charges involving many of same kinds of influence peddling.\n\nSeventy-three of Ryan's former associates and state employees in his administration pleaded guilty or were convicted of federal felonies, including bribery, kickbacks, and perjury, according to an October 1, 2005 report by Steve Stanek for the Heartland Institute.\n\nThe governor's former campaign manager and chief of staff, Scott Fawell, and Ryan both ended up with six and a half years in prison.\n\nFour of the last seven Illinois governors have been indicted on charges related to influence peddling, and three were convicted. Anyone following the first trial of what could be many in the Board Games case knows that Blagojevich is targeted to be the fourth.\n\nIronically, Reuters reported on Ryan's entering prison on November 7, 2007 and stated: \"The scandals paved the way for Democrats to regain the Illinois governor's seat for the first time in more than a quarter century with Rod Blagojevich's election in 2002.\"\n\nThe Board Games investigation was also known to be underway as top members of Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's Administration were being investigated, arrested and convicted by the same prosecutors for crimes ranging from bid rigging to illegal hiring for city jobs in exchange for campaign support for Daley and the candidates he endorsed.\n\nA January 26, 2004 Sun-Times article by Fran Spielman reported: \"The dethroned head of Chicago's scandal-scarred Hired Truck Program was charged with extortion and bribery in an indictment, unsealed this afternoon, stemming from a sweeping federal investigation of the $40 million-a-year city program.\"\n\nOn January 10, 2005, the Associated Press reported that contractor, James Duff, whose family has raised money for Mayor Richard Daley's campaigns pleaded guilty to defrauding the city through a series of janitorial contracts \"worth $100 million.\"\n\nDuff is part of a mob-connected family that has been closer to Daley than any other defendants charged in recent corruption cases. \"The family has raised thousands of dollars for the mayor's campaign fund and socialized with him at Christmas parties and other events,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn this case, 5 family members were accused of getting city contracts that were reserved for businesses controlled and operated by women and minorities, when in fact, Windy City Maintenance was controlled by James Duff.\n\nOn March 20, 2008, the Chicago Tribune reported the Inspector General, David Hoffman, stated that:\n\n\"James Duff, who cheated the city and insurance companies out of millions of dollars, should be subject to the stiffest penalty outlined in policies drawn up in 2005 following a series of contracting scandals.\"\n\nBut the Tribune then said: \"Daley's administration has banned the head of Windy City Maintenance and two others convicted of contract fraud from doing business with the city for three years, despite a recommendation from the inspector general that they never be allowed to do work for City Hall again.\"\n\n\"Allowing the defendants in this case to be eligible for city contracts in the future sends a message that is inconsistent with deterrence and integrity in the system,\" Inspector General Hoffman said.\n\n\"If racketeering, fraud and money laundering only merit three years' debarment, then it will be hard to convince other contractors that their misconduct will result in a powerful financial sanction,\" he said in the Tribune report.\n\nThe last two presidents of the notoriously corrupt Cook County Board include a father-son Stroger tag team. John Stroger left office after he had a stroke in 2006, and he died in January 2008.\n\nHis 2002 campaign finance committee was headed by Rezko, which means Rezko was a might busy guy being he also served as the top rainmaker of fundraising for both Blagojevich and Obama during the same time period.\n\nThe Cook Country Board was also under the gun at the same time that the Board Games investigation was being conducted. On September 22, 2006, ABC News in Chicago reported that:\n\n\"FBI agents armed with search warrants carried out raids at several Cook County offices in downtown Chicago Thursday in connection to an investigation in to political patronage hiring. Agents are expected to return Friday.\"\n\nABC pointed out that the feds have been all over the Daley administration, the Blagojevich administration, and they were all over Cook County government. Agents armed with subpoenas and requests for information were at all three of the medical facilities, the hospitals, and the forest preserve district.\n\n\"We don't know how many different investigations of corruption are going on countywide, but the target seems to be allegations of political shenanigans when it comes too hirings and promotions,\" ABC News stated.\n\nSince November 2006, a Federal court-appointed monitor has been overseeing the hiring practices in Cook County, and as recently as April 10, 2008, she reported that political hiring is alive and well in Cook County with President Todd Stroger running the Board.\n\nJulia Nowicki, \"who monitors about 12,000 jobs under Stroger and at the Bureau of Health, said she has hundreds of old and dozens of current patronage complaints -- including claims an entire department under Stroger is a patronage haven,\" according to the April 10, 2008 Sun-Times.\n\nLast but not least, Obama knew about the Operation Board Games investigation during his year-long wheeling and dealing escapade with Rezko to arrange the purchase of the mansion and lot, and any claim to the contrary by the \"I did not know\" candidate is ludicrous.\n\nOn July 18, 2004, nearly a year before Obama bought the mansion, Chicago Tribune reporters Ray Gibson, Crystal Yednak, Ray Long and Jane Fritsch wrote that: \"Blagojevich adviser tied to appointee; Doctor, fundraiser co-owned condos.\"\n\nA podiatrist, Fortunee Massuda, selected to a serve \"on a powerful state health-care oversight panel is a partner in a real estate venture with a top Blagojevich fundraiser and counselor who recommended her appointment,\" the report stated.\n\nMassuda's connection to Antoin Rezko, the Blagojevich fundraiser and adviser, was not publicly disclosed when the governor appointed her to the Health Facilities Planning Board on August 12, 2003, the Times pointed out.\n\nThe report also noted that Massuda was one of \"several members\" appointed by Blagojevich to sit on the board, \"after the governor won legislative approval\" to overhaul its membership. That would be the \"legislative approval\" that Obama signed off on.\n\nOn January 8, 2005, the Sun-Times reported that Blagojevich's own father-in-law said the governor's fund-raising chief Christopher Kelly, \"trades appointments to commissions for checks for $50,000\" to Blagojevich's political fund.\n\nIn May 2005, news came that Levine had been indicted on 27 counts of official corruption and was facing a possible life sentence in prison.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, nearly four months before Obama bought the lot, the Tribune obtained a copy of a June 2005 subpoena issued to the TRS fund and reported that:\n\n\"Federal investigators have asked the state teachers' pension system for records involving a cadre of political insiders, ranging from prominent GOP fundraisers to a close adviser to Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich.\"\n\n\"The subpoena seeks records for more than two dozen people and businesses, including several clout-heavy Republicans and Democrats with years of influence in state and national politics. Some of those named have done business with the pension fund, while others have no apparent connection to the board.\"\n\nThe report notes that one of \"the most prominent names in the subpoena is Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko, a close confidant and major Blagojevich fundraiser.\"\n\nThe revelation in the Tribune most relevant to Obama going ahead with his \"boneheaded\" deal, was the comment that the subpoena also called for records of Rezko's \"wife's firm as well as records of some of his business associates.\"\n\nAlso in September 2005, Steve Loren and Joe Cari pleaded guilty and Cari's plea agreement mentioned Stuart Levine and an \"associate,\" whom the media quickly reported was Rezko.\n\nObama's purchase of that mansion was the result of pure greed. By the time he bought the lot, Obama knew Blagojevich was going down and would not be the presidential candidate. He also knew that he would be pulled off the bench as the second choice, but he went ahead with the deal anyways.\n\nIllinois citizens are sick of paying the cost of corruption. A September 26, 2007 News Release by Steve Stanek of the Heartland Institute carried the headline: \"Proposed Tax Hike Would Give Chicago Nation's Highest Sales Tax Burden\"\n\n\"Chicagoans would face an 11 percent sales tax rate, highest in the nation, if Cook County officials go through with a plan to more than triple the county's portion of the area's sales tax,\" Stanek wrote.\n\nAn October 14, 2007 Sun-Times report by Tim Novak and Fran Spielman noted that,\n\n\"When Mayor Daley asked Chicagoans to cough up $293 million more next year to finance the cost of city government, there's one tax he failed to mention: The Corruption, Waste and Mismanagement Tax.\"\n\n\"It's almost impossible to calculate the cost of the Hired Truck, city hiring, minority contracting and police corruption scandals,\" they wrote. \"More than 1,400 people have staked claims to the $12 million fund created to compensate victims of the city's rigged hiring system.\"\n\nWell over $2 million in legal fees, and counting, have been paid to federal hiring monitor appointed in 2005 to oversee city hiring, the report said, \"by a federal judge livid with the city for making a mockery of the decree that was supposed to end political hiring and firing, but never did.\"\n\nAccording to the Sun-Times, Hundreds of thousands of additional legal fees were spent for attorneys who represented Daley, the City Council and the Black Caucus in the case.\n\nOn February 1, 2008, Steve Stanek reported that the \"Chicago City Council has approved the biggest property tax hike in the city's history, plus higher taxes and fees on a host of other items.\"\n\n\"Other items to see tax or fee hikes,\" the report noted, \"include liquor, telephone service, natural gas, car leases, DVD rentals, and city vehicle stickers.\"\n\nThe tax hikes also included a five-cent tax on each bottle of bottled water sold in the city.\n\nCorruption was the argument raised by city aldermen who opposed the tax hikes.\n\n\"Nothing has eroded public confidence in our local government more than the constant drumbeat of criminal indictments and convictions of people who have enriched themselves at public expense,\" said Alderman Joe Moore during the floor debate, according to the report.\n\n\"And nothing has made the public more cynical than the endless string of broken promises to end business as usual in city government.\"\n\n\"How many bottles of water must be sold to pay for the $12 million fund created to compensate victims of the city's rigged hiring system?\" Moore said, referring to a lawsuit settlement the city is still paying for years of corrupt hiring practices that favored politically connected persons for jobs and promotions, Stanek reports.\n\nA March 8, 2008 report by Stanek in Budget & Tax News on a Cook County Board Meeting in late December 2008 reported that:\n\n\"Complaints from thousands of angry taxpayers and infighting among county commissioners have held off nearly $890 million of proposed tax and fee hikes in Cook County, Illinois.\"\n\nAccording to Stanek, taxpayers flooded the county commissioners with phone calls, emails, and letters of protest, \"apparently to good effect.\" The report noted that:\n\n\"Dozens of former Chicago city workers and close associates of the Daley administration have been convicted of crimes in recent years. Illinois' immediate past governor and scores of his associates have been convicted of federal crimes, and current Gov. Rod Blagojevich (D), his wife, and associates of theirs are the apparent targets of several federal criminal probes.\"\n\n\"Some Blagojevich administration officials have been convicted of crimes related to their involvement with state government.\"\n\nDuring the board meeting, Democratic Cook County Commissioner Forest Claypool said public pressure against any tax or fee increases \"has been intense.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Claypool believes \"the constant backdrop of news stories about government corruption and waste here in the county and in Chicago and Springfield has shown people they really are paying corruption and dysfunction taxes.\"\n\n\"I think people are realizing that paying more taxes is simply enabling decrepit and dysfunctional government,\" he said.\n\nDuring the meeting, Republican Cook County Commissioner, Tony Peraica, said: \"The best way to fight tax increases is by fighting the corruption that drains tens of millions of dollars from the county budget.\"\n\nPeraica has long complained of illegal patronage hiring, rigged contracts, and other waste and corruption in Cook County, according to Staneck's report.\n\nAnd let there be no doubt, Obama is a member of this corrupt gang. On January 22, 2007 ABC News in Chicago announced that Senator Obama \"is supporting Mayor Daley's re-election bid despite a series of City Hall corruption scandals.\"\n\nMayor Daley endorsed Obama for president a few weeks ago and the mayor's brother Bill is now an Obama advisor, the report noted.\n\n\"So in the spirit of political payback, Obama is endorsing Daley for re-election over two African American challengers despite a series of City Hall corruption scandals that Obama called deeply troubling as recently as a few months ago.\"\n\nABC reported that Obama said, \"Daley's overall record, his style of inclusion and his love of Chicago make him a better choice than challengers.\"\n\nObama also endorsed Daley's running mates for City Clerk, Miguel Del Valle, and Stepanie Neeley, for Treasurer, ABC News added. It should be noted, that the last City Clerk just got out of prison after being convicted in the Hired Truck scandal, and has written a book about the corruption in the Daley administration.\n\nFive months after Obama publicly endorsed Daley, a report by David Jackson and John McCormick in the June 12, 2007 Tribune noted that:\n\n\"Obama endorsed former Ald. Dorothy Tillman (3rd), calling her \"a very early supporter of my campaign.\" Tillman was then under fire for her stewardship of the scandal-plagued Harold Washington Cultural Center, where contracts benefited members of her family.\n\n\"Obama supported the re-election of Gov. Rod Blagojevich, whose administration is embroiled in corruption probes.\"\n\nAnd during the race for Cook County Board president, Obama predictably endorsed Todd Stroger over a Republican and was criticized for calling Stroger \"a good progressive\" despite allegations of job-rigging to favor members of Stroger's 8th Ward organization,\" according to the report.\n\nOn September 5, 2007, the New York Post reported that: \"A man who has long been dogged by charges that the bank his family owns helped finance a Chicago crime figure will host a Windy City fund-raiser tonight for Senator Barack Obama.\"\n\nAlex Giannoulias became Illinois state treasurer last year after Obama vouched for him, has pledged to raise $100,000 for the senator's Oval Office bid, the Post noted.\n\nWhen Giannoulias was questioned by the Tribune in March 2006 about loans made between 1994 and 2002, to companies controlled by convicted bookmaker and prostitution ring promoter, Michael Giorango, he said the bank's decisions were made while he was still in law school, when he wasn't a full-time bank employee.\n\nBut the Tribune later found records that showed Broadway Bank made nearly $12 million in additional mortgage loans to Giorango in 2005, when Giannoulias was overseeing the bank's loans.\n\nObama knew the September 2007 fundraising affair would draw attention in Chicago so he tried to make sure it remained unknown. On September 5, 2007, Lynn Sweet, wrote in the Sun-Times:\n\n\"Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) omits from his Wednesday public schedule a fund-raiser hosted by Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias at a restaurant in Chicago's Greektown community. The event is closed to the press and a campaign spokesman, Ben LaBolt, said in response to my e-mail query this morning that a pool reporter will not be allowed in the reception.\"\n\nOn April 22, 2007, the Tribune noted that City Hall records show Michelle Obama began work as a $60,000-a-year mayoral assistant to Richard Daley in September of 1991.\n\nAt City Hall, Michelle formed close friendships with Valerie Jarrett, and many other top Daley aides, including former Corporation Counsel Susan Sher and David Mosena, who was the mayor's chief of staff when Michelle first joined his administration.\n\n\"All have long since left the city payroll,\" the Tribune wrote, \"but are loyal to the mayor and now the Obamas.\"\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Michelle's employer, the University of Chicago announced that, \"Valerie Jarrett has been appointed as the new Chair of the University of Chicago Medical Center Board and also Chair of a newly created Executive Committee of that board. She has also been named Vice-Chair of the University's Board of Trustees.\"\n\nAccording to the announcement, Jarrett \"served for eight years in City of Chicago government posts, first as Deputy Corporation Counsel for Finance and Development, then as Deputy Chief of Staff for Mayor Richard Daley in 1991,\" and, \"as Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development from 1992 through 1995.\"\n\nJarrett served on Obama's US Senate campaign finance committee and serves on Obama's presidential campaign finance committee along with Alex Giannoulias and Mayor Daley's brother Bill.\n\nThe political mafia of Illinois now plans to move the Chicago brand of corruption to Washington in a U-Haul hooked up to their second choice candidate. Americans will never allow it to happen. They will either vote for McCain or not at all.\n\nIf Obama becomes the nominee, the Republicans will unleash a non-stop expose of Obama in the mainstream media that will make the swift boat attacks against John Kerry seem trivial. Only this time, they won't have to make lies because the truth will be on their side.\n\nThe tracking of the subplots that developed as a result of the Board Games investigation, has revealed a spider-web of corruption that spread from the Chicago Loop to O'Hare Airport to the Illinois Tollway, all the way to bid-rigging in Iraq, with Iraqi-born billionaire, Nadhmi Auchi, owner of General Mediterranean Holdings, a Luxemburg-based conglomerate with investments all over the world in everything from defense contractors to pharmaceuticals, at the center of many schemes.\n\nPart II of \"Subplots of Operation Board Games\" will cover those subplots.\n\nhttp://therealbarackobama.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/evelyn-pringles-operation-board-games-and-curtain-time-for-obama/\n\nby Evelyn Pringle May 14, 2008 - 8:54am\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUS Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald does not make a habit of destroying pubic officials by listing them in indictments for no reason and the only two political candidates identified as receiving campaign money from Operation Board Games kickback schemes are Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and the US Senator from Illinois, Barack Obama.\n\nInstead of referring to Board Games as the \"Rezko\" case, before long the media will likely be calling it the \"Blagojevich\" case. However, because the governor did not become the presidential candidate, when the scandal is recorded in the history books it will be the \"Barack Obama\" case.\n\nCurtain Time Part II will show that Obama was the inside guy in the Illinois senate as far as setting up the Health Facilities Planning Board to extort contributions from companies in exchange for the approval of applications to build medial facilities.\n\nObama was chairman of the Senate Health & Human Services Committee in January 2003. A few articles in the media have mentioned that Obama sat on a committee that reviewed matters related to the Planning Board in conjunction with the Governor's staff but none have discussed his integral part in getting the bill passed\n\nA review of senate records from January 2003 to August 2003, shows Obama played a major role as chairman of that committee, in pushing through Senate Bill 1332, that led to the \"Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act,\" which reduced the number of members on the Board from 15 to 9, making the votes much easier to rig.\n\nDemocratic Senator Susan Garrett sponsored the bill in the senate, and the chief co-sponsor was Republican Senator Dale Righter. These two senators were also on the Human Services Committee with Obama.\n\nThe bill was filed with the senate secretary on February 20, 2003, and assigned to Human Services Committee for review on February 27. Less than a month later, as chairman, Obama sent word that the bill should be passed on March 13, 2003.\n\nOn May 31, 2003, the House and Senate passed the bill and the only senator listed in the \"yes\" votes mentioned in the Board Games indictments is Obama.\n\nBlagojevich made the effective date June 27, 2003, and the co-schemers already had the people lined up to stack the Board and rig the votes with full approval from Obama.\n\nAs discussed fully in Curtain Time for Obama Part I, the Republicans and Democrats worked together in setting up the Planning Board scheme because the Combine as a whole would profit.\n\nDuring the trial, Stuart Levine testified that when he sought reappointment to the Planning Board, he told Republican co-schemer, Bill Cellini, to tell the Blagojevich administration he would vote however they wanted when approving projects.\n\nHe told the jury he had the same understanding with the two prior Republican governors, Jim Edgar, and George Ryan, who is now sitting in prison due to Fitzgerald's successful prosecution of a corruption case against him.\n\nA June 2003 email exchange produced in the trial shows Obama was one of eight officials who received the names of the nominees for the new Board ahead of time, from the office of David Wilhelm, who headed Blagojevich's 2002 campaign for governor.\n\nTony Rezko's name does not appear in the email. In fact, his attorney made the point to the jury that the exchange was from Blagojevich's general counsel, Susan Lichtenstein, and Wilhelm's office, and indicated the appointees were recommended by Wilhelm and supported by those who received the memo.\n\nThe memo said, \"we worked closely over the past six months\" with eight officials including three state senators.\n\nJennifer Thomas, a former aide in Blagojevich's patronage office, testified that she attended regular weekly meetings at Rezko's office between the spring of 2003 and November 2004, and Rezko floated names and specifically said Levine should be reappointed to the new Board.\n\nThe Senate bill said, the \"Board shall be appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" But the Senate Confirmation Hearings were a joke. For instance, the Feds recorded Levine talking to co-schemer, Jon Bauman, the day Levine learned he was approved by the Senate from the executive secretary of the Board.\n\nLevine told Bauman he ran into Jeffrey Marks, who said \"congratulations on your appointment,\" and Levine asked for what. Marks said, \"well the Senate Confirmation Hearings on Health Facility Plan Board members.\"\n\nHe told Levine Senate President, Emil Jones, only allowed 2 members to be approved and \"that was you and the other person he just put in.\"\n\n\"Isn't that hysterical 'cause you know they had this big battle going on,\" Levine told Bauman.\n\nLaughing away, Levine said, \"don't you just love it.\"\n\n\"I'm one of those independents and not part of the block.\"\n\n\"Well, good, you know it's good to be just a true independent civil servant,\" Bauman said laughing along with Levine.\n\n\"Is, is that a good thing,\" Levine replied, \"I've never been that.\"\n\nCorrupt appointees fund Obama and Blagojevich campaigns\n\nThe corrupt new appointees were all contributors to the presidential hopeful, Blagojevich, and the US senate hopeful Obama.\n\nThe previous Act allowed the Board itself to select a \"Chairman and other officers as deemed necessary.\" But the new law stated: \"The Governor shall designate one of the members to serve as Chairman and shall name as full-time Executive Secretary.\"\n\nThe Board's then sitting-chairman, Thomas Beck, who was originally appointed by a Republican governor, testified under a grant of immunity that he brought a $1,000 check to Rezko on July 15, 2003, to make sure Blagojevich reappointed him.\n\nA few weeks later, Beck said, Rezko called to say he would be reappointed along with a Republican holdover Levine. Beck also testified that Rezko told him Blagojevich was set to appoint Rezko's three doctor friends to complete the rigged voting bloc. He said he met the doctors in August 2003, at the first meeting of the new Board.\n\nDr Michel Malek gave Obama $10,000 a little over a month before the first meeting on June 30, 2003. He also donated $25,000 to Blagojevich three weeks later on July 25, 2003, and gave Obama another $500 in September 2003. Malek was an investor in Riverside Park.\n\nDr Fortunee Massuda donated $25,000 to Blagojevich on July 25, 2003, and gave a total of $2,000 to Obama on different dates. Massuda's husband, Charles Hannon, is a co-schemer in the pension fund case and testified against Rezko in the trial.\n\nDr Imad Almanaseer contributed a total of $3,000 to Obama after he landed the appointment. On March 13, 2008, Almanaseer testified against Rezko and told the jury he was an investor in Rezko's fast-food businesses.\n\nThis doctor's son, Ahmed Almanaseer, was given a trade office intern position with the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. Ahmed is president of HireIraqis.com a bilingual human resources \"site aimed at linking Iraqi job seekers with the companies engaged in the reconstruction [in Iraq] efforts,\" according to Rezko Watch.\n\nCorrupt Planning Board in action\n\nThe first project approved by the new Board was for Mercy Health Systems, for which Bear Stearns served as a bond underwriter. The deal was to earn $1.5 million contribution for Blagojevich.\n\nIn attempt to help seal the deal, when Mercy's application was submitted to Planning Board staff for review, the Department of Human Services sent a letter on October 23, 2003, to Donald Jones, Acting Supervisor of Project Review, with a recommendation for approval of the application, stating:\n\n\"We at the Illinois Department of Human Services know how very important it is to have experienced providers such as Mercy Health System and believe they will meet the health care needs in South East McHenry County.\"\n\nFitzgerald also presented an exhibit to the jury to show that Blagojevich's director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, Jack Lavin, sent a letter to Jones recommending approval. The exhibit also contained letters sent by the directors of the Department of Public Aid, the Department of Aging and the Department of Revenue, bringing the number to 5, urging Jones to support approval for Mercy.\n\nThe Planning Board staff still recommended the rejection of Mercy's proposal. On March 11, 2008, Jones told the jury that experts found the application failed to meet 18 criteria set up for the establishment of a new hospital. He said it was also too close to other hospitals that had too many empty beds and services not fully utilized.\n\nThe day before the vote in December 2003, Mercy hired the Chicago-based law firm of Gardner, Carton and Douglas. Gardner had donated $25,000 to Blagojevich in July 2003.\n\nAlthough the application was rejected the first time, Mercy moved for reconsideration and won approval at the April 21, 2004 meeting. Beck testified that after the meeting, he and Levine drove to Rezko's office to tell him the plan was approved and Rezko was there with Christopher Kelly.\n\nOnce approved, the plan was for co-schemer Jacob Kiferbaum to pad the construction costs on the hospital and pay the kickback through a bogus consulting contract with Levine's business associate, Dr Robert Weinstein.\n\nAfter helping set up the Planning Board, Dave Wilhelm became a consultant for Edward Hospital. Edward also wanted approval to build a new hospital. On April 9, 2008, Levine testified that he met with Wilhelm and another Edward lobbyist in the summer of 2003, and came away with the impression that Wilhelm's contribution to the team was clout with the Blagojevich administration.\n\nWilhelm's investment firm, Hopewell Ventures, also received approval for deals from the Teacher pension fund. On April 10, 2008, Levine told the jury, \"Mr. Rezko told me that Gov. Blagojevich and Mr. Rezko wanted to keep track of what clients Mr. Wilhelm had before various boards in the state of Illinois.\"\n\n\"And they wanted to keep track of what success he had and what success he did not have,\" he said. Rezko and the governor wanted \"to assess the value of Mr. Wilhelm's contribution to helping Gov. Blagojevich,\" Levine testified.\n\nWilhelm's clients should not win business \"unless I was specifically told by Mr. Rezko that he wanted him to be successful,\" he told the jury.\n\nLevine said he then got word to Edward officials that Wilhelm was on the outs with Blagojevich and set up an elaborate scheme to convince Edward that their application would be approved if Edward hired a construction company owned by Kiferbaum to build the new medical center and hospital and Bear Stearns as a $200 million bond underwriter.\n\nBoard chairman, Beck, received fees from Bear Stearns and Bear Stearns also employed Beck's son, David Beck, as a managing director in its municipal bond office in Chicago.\n\nAs a member of the Planning Board, Levine was prohibited from engaging in ex parte communications with applicants with matters pending before the Board. So in order to protect Levine, Kiferbaum and Republican insider, P Nicholas Hurtgen, met Edward CEO, Pam Davis, in place of Levine.\n\nHurtgen wanted his employer, Bear Stearns, to receive the financing work. On December 22, 2003, Hurtgen talked to Davis, and said if Edward hired Kiferbaum, he thought Edward would not have any more difficulties with the Board. Hurtgen said he was selling \"clout,\" and Levine was the \"clout.\"\n\nThe following day, Kiferbaum and Hurtgen both met with Davis in attempt to persuade her to hire Kiferbaum. Kiferbaum told Davis that he had been working with Mercy and its application to build a new hospital was going to be approved.\n\nIn response to their claims, Davis asked Kiferbaum and Hurtgen to prove they were telling the truth about Levine's role by setting up a meeting with Levine.\n\nLevine agreed to set up a meeting where he and Hurtgen would just happen to bump into to Davis and Kiferbaum while they were having breakfast at the same restaurant. Levine instructed Kiferbaum to tell Davis she should not ask anything direct about her project because of the bar against ex parte communications.\n\nBut the extortion attempt backfired when Davis went to the Feds in December 2003, and kicked off the investigation now known as Operation Board Game. The Feds put wiretaps on the phone lines in Levine's home, and between April 8, 2004 and May 21, 2004, caught most of the co-schemers on tape.\n\nAnd as planned, on April 18, 2004, Davis went to the restaurant for breakfast with Kiferbaum. Levine and Hurtgen walked over to their table and Levine told her he was the Chairman of the Board of the Chicago Medical School and Kiferbaum had done work for them. He said Kiferbaum was a person upon whom one can rely and whose word can be depended on.\n\nTwo days later, Edward faxed Kiferbaum a letter stating Edward would not hire Kiferbaum. He called Levine and told him about the refusal and the next day the Board voted against the proposal and issued a notice of an intent-to-deny the application.\n\nThe Feds moved in on Levine on May 20, 2004. In his plea agreement, Levine acknowledged that an estimate of the benefit from the Edward scheme would have been approximately $1,810,000.\n\nFeds track Obama's visits to Rezko\n\nIn the media, Obama always made it sound like he rarely saw Rezko, saying they met for breakfast or lunch once or twice a year. However, the FBI mole John Thomas helped investigators \"build a record of repeat visits to the old offices of Rezko and former business partner Daniel Mahru's Rezmar Corp., at 853 N. Elston, by Blagojevich and Obama during 2004 and 2005,\" according to the February 10, 2008 Sun-Times.\n\nDuring his March 14, 2008 interview, the Times told Obama, Thomas is an FBI mole and he \"recently told us that he saw you coming and going from Rezko's office a lot.\"\n\n\"And three other sources told us that you and Rezko spoke on the phone daily.\"\n\n\"Is that true?\" the reporter asked.\n\n\"No,\" Obama said, \"That's not accurate.\"\n\n\"I think what is true,\" he said, \"is that, it depends on the period of time.\"\n\n\"I've known him for 17 years,\" Obama stated. \"There were stretches of time where I would see him once or twice a year.\"\n\nHe told the Times, \"when he was involved in finance committee for the U.S. Senate race, or the state senate races, or the U.S. Congressional race, then he was an active member.\"\n\n\"During the U.S. Senate race, there's be stretches of like a couple of weeks - for example prior to him organizing the fundraiser that he did for us - where I would probably be talking to him once a day to make sure that was going well,\" he said.\n\n\"But the typical relationship was one that was fond,\" he added. \"We would see each other.\"\n\n\"But there would be no reason for me to be seeing him that often,\" he stated.\n\nThis issue may be sorted out soon enough because Fitzgerald's charts matching up Obama's contributions, visits and calls are bound to be every bit as thorough as the ones produced to prove Rezko is guilty as charged in the first trial. They simply were not produced because they were not needed to prove the defendant guilty in the first case.\n\nAs an example of what records might be squirreled away, consider that an FBI agent presented a chart to the jury on April 28, 2008, showing 257 calls from Rezko's phones to Blagojevich's chief of staff, Lon Monk, between March 2004 and May 2004 alone.\n\nHe also had a list of all calls between Levine and Rezko from November 2002 to May 2004. Rezko's attorney brought out a point that backs the assertion that just because records on Obama were not shown, does not mean they do not exist.\n\nThe attorney questioned the agent about missing calls, and specifically those to and from Christopher Kelly. The agent first said records were not available, but later admitted the government probably does have records on Kelly that were not available to him.\n\nIn addition, the contributions extorted through the Planning Board scheme were for the intended presidential candidate, Blagojevich. Obama's US senate war chest was already funded and by the time these kickbacks were paid that campaign would be over.\n\nBut Obama did end up with $20,000 from the very first kickback paid in the pension fund scheme set up through the Board of the Teacher's Retirement System.\n\nElie Maloof and Joseph Aramanda, the straw donors used to funnel the contributions to Obama, also made $1,000 contributions of their own for his failed run for Congress in 2000, on the same day March 17, 2000.\n\nIn addition, Aramanda gave $500 to Obama's senate campaign on June 30, 2003. In the summer of 2005, Aramanda's teenage son landed a coveted intern position in Obama's senate office in Washington.\n\nObama also received contributions directly from the persons appointed to the pension board for the express purpose of rigging the votes. On June 30, 2003, appointee, Jack Carriglio contributed $1,000.\n\nThe other appointee, Anthony Abboud, donated $500 to Obama on June 30, 2003, $250 on March 5, 2004, and $1,000 on June 25, 2004.\n\nMichael Winter, who prosecutors say agreed to serve as a funnel for kickbacks paid through an investment firm in one scheme donated $3,000 to Obama on June 30, 2003.\n\nPlanning Board Scheme unravels\n\nWhen interviewing with the Sun-Times, Obama claimed not to know Rezko was under investigation for influence peddling in the months leading up to June 2005, stating:\n\n\"During the time that I was purchasing the house, there were some noises about Tony having potential problems. But they . . . hadn't risen to the attention that they ultimately would.\"\n\n\"And I viewed him as . . . purchasing the lot as a friend purchasing a lot, somebody who was interested in real estate development and who was experienced in real estate development.\"\n\nThe claim that there were merely \"some noises about Tony\" was a blatant lie and the Times should have called him on it.\n\nObama was still chairman of the Human Services Committee when lawmakers learned Fitzgerald was on to the Planning Board scheme in the spring of 2004, a year before Obama entered into the real estate deal in June 2005. On July 11, 2004, the Sun-Times reported: \"A key Blagojevich fund-raiser, Tony Rezko, played a role in recommending appointees to the board.\"\n\nWith stories appearing about the scandal almost daily, Illinois House Speaker, Michael Madigan, introduced legislation to fire the board and Blagojevich had no choice but to issue an executive order in July 2004, stating:\n\n\"In light of recent allegations concerning the propriety of certain board actions, the governor hereby imposes a moratorium on all meetings and actions of the board until the board is reconstituted by law.\"\n\nBy this time, Levine had already resigned and Almanaseer asked not to be reappointed. Both the House and Senate voted to give all members the boot at the end of July. But Obama's name is conspicuously missing from the session on July 24, 2004, when Bill 7307 was passed to get rid of legislation he pushed through a year earlier.\n\nThe transcripts from the sessions in July 2004 show lawmakers in both parties were outraged over the scheme. However, nothing much changed, because the new bill included the same process for vetting and appointing members to the new Board.\n\nDuring the July 24, 2004 session, Senator Peter Roskam questioned the wisdom of passing a bill that is \"silent as to any changes in the vetting.\"\n\nReferring to Blagojevich, he noted the current \"vetter\" and \"backgrounder\" who \"placed all of these individuals on the Health Facilities Planning Board, apparently completely failed in that vetting and backgrounding.\"\n\nThe bill \"leaves the same amount of authority in the same person that we're criticizing implicitly today for failing to appoint good people,\" he said.\n\nSenate President Jones defended the process and the corrupt members. \"Let it be understood,\" he said, \"that those mere allegations were against -- were made as regard to members who had been reappointed, and that's the Chairman and several other members had been reappointed to the Board.\"\n\n\"And so, this legislation is in no way to say that the Governor's Office didn't do its proper job,\" Jones stated. But then the Senate had to advise and consent to the \"vetted\" candidates and as noted above, Jones played a big part in the reappointment of Levine.\n\nJones also told his fellow lawmakers, \"this bill does not cast any aspersions on any current Board members because they are mere allegations.\"\n\n\"We don't know any facts,\" he said.\n\nDuring the session, Senator Kirk Dillard had the apparent audacity to ask Jones, \"is there anything in this bill that prohibits a member of the Health Facilities reconstituted Planning Board from giving campaign contributions to politicians?\"\n\n\"No, that's not included in the Act,\" Jones answered.\n\n\"So, it would still be possible for somebody to give a large, say twenty-five-thousand- dollar contribution one day to a political figure and get reappointed or appointed to this Board a couple of days later?\" Dillard asked.\n\n\"There is no such prohibition,\" Jones said, \"for this Board or any other board, be it the Gaming Board, be -- there is no such prohibition.\"\n\nIndictment headlines non-stop during Obama's real estate deals\n\nThe first indictment in the Planning Board case came a month before the mansion deal was finalized. On May 9, 2005, CBS Channel 2 Chicago, reported, \"Stuart Levine is accused of using his position on a powerful state health board to cut himself and his buddies in on hospital construction contracts worth $113 million.\"\n\nHurtgen and Kiferbaum were also charged for their part in the Edward extortion scheme.\n\nCBS pointed out that before joining Bear Stearns, Hurtgen \"worked in the administration of then-Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson as deputy secretary in the state Department of Administration, which supervised state bond issues.\"\n\nOn May 10, 2005, the Sun-Times reported Levine, \"who has given more than $1.6 million to mostly Republican state politicians since 1993, was re-appointed to the planning board -- as well as the state Teachers' Retirement System board -- at the urging of ... Rezko.\"\n\nLevine was rousted out of bed by FBI agents, the Times said, \"and hauled into court on fraud charges alleging kickbacks, influence-peddling and insider dealing.\"\n\nJohn Glennon, a former adviser to Republican Governor George Ryan, was also charged with \"criminal conspiracy for concealing kickbacks in the financing and construction of two Illinois hospitals and lying to federal authorities.\"\n\nThe Republican Combine member Glennon gave $1,000 to Obama on January 8, 2004.\n\nAt the time, Fitzgerald would not say whether anyone in Blagojevich's office had been questioned or who else was tied to the scheme. But the Times quoted FBI Agent, Robert Grant, as saying: \"Stay tuned; there will be more charges in the future.\"\n\nThis article noted that Kiferbaum was already cooperating. Five days later, the Times reported Rezko \"had a hand in staffing decisions at the scandal-tainted Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board.\"\n\nOn May 20, 2005, the Times said, \"Two Rezko associates gave Blagojevich $25,000 each just days after the governor named them to a state panel.\"\n\nHowever, the reporters either failed to notice, or failed to mention, that panel member Malek gave $10,000 to Obama on June 30, 2003.\n\nLess than 3 months before Obama bought 10-feet of the lot, on October 31, 2005, the Times reported: \"Investigations of the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board and state Teachers' Retirement System have yielded federal charges against six people.\"\n\nThe article also noted that, \"in a guilty plea ... Joseph Cari alleged he had been told by a now-indicted former pension board member that Blagojevich and two top fund-raisers, Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko and Christopher G. Kelly, schemed to award pension business to consultants, lawyers and investment firms who donated to Blagojevich.\"\n\nCari donated $1,335 to Obama's campaign and gave $10,000 to Blagojevich. During the trial, Cari testified that Blagojevich, Rezko and Kelly tried to convince him to take over the national fundraising campaign for Blagojevich's presidential bid.\n\nObama's senate finance committee during Planning Board scheme\n\nIn his interview with the Tribune on March 14, Obama said Rezko \"was a part of our finance committee and was listed as part of our finance committee.\"\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, his finance committee raised the money as the Planning Board scheme was set up and the scandal unraveled. Yet Obama told the Tribune in regard to Rezko, \"at that time, there were no indications that he was involved in anything inappropriate.\"\n\nApparently, Obama expects the public to believe that nobody on this committee bothered to tell him he received a single contribution of $10,000, and the money came from a person he just recommended for the Board.\n\nOther members of the committee included Rezko's wife Rita, and Valerie Jarrett, who got her jump start into a lucrative real estate career in the Combine's Daley administration. She now serves as chairman of Obama's presidential finance committee.\n\nJarrett racked up eight years in Chicago government, first as deputy corporation counsel for Finance and Development, then as deputy chief of staff to Daley and finally, as commissioner of Chicago's Department of Planning and Development, according to a summary of her achievements obtained from the Business Week website on April 8, 2008.\n\nWhile serving as Commissioner, Jarrett \"consolidated the Department of Planning, Economic Development and Urban Renewal; implemented a model program for the revitalization of three Chicago neighborhoods; and created a business express unit to cut red tape to service Chicago businesses,\" says the Cook County Information Center.\n\nObama's introduction into the \"Combine\" came when his wife Michelle was hired by Jarrett in the early 1990s, and served as Jarrett's assistant in Daley's office and followed her to the Department of Planning and Development.\n\nJarrett was appointed chairman of the University of Chicago Medical Center Board in June 2006. She was also made chairman of a newly created Executive Committee of that Board, according to a June 13, 2006 University announcement. In addition, Jarrett was named vice-chair of the University's Board of Trustees, the announcement states.\n\nMichelle landed a high paying job at the University of Chicago Hospitals. Two months after Obama became a US senator, she was appointed vice president for community and external affairs. Tax returns show the promotion nearly tripled her pay to $317,000 in 2005, from $122,000 in 2004.\n\nOn February 14, 2008, Wilhelm endorsed Obama in a call with reporters, citing the senator's \"masterful\" campaign organization and strategy as well as his \"undeniable momentum.\"\n\n\"He has outworked, outorganized and outraised his opponents every step of the way,\" Wilhelm said. \"The Obama campaign, win or lose, will serve as a model for future generations to come.\"\n\nWilhelm's firm has received a subpoena for records related to pension fund investments.\n\nIf the Combine's plot with the Bush administration to shut down Operation Board Games had worked, Obama would be home free. But it failed and the Republicans are just waiting to air the roadmap of dirt pieced together from Fitzgerald's investigation if Obama is nominated. McCain is in the clear because there is no sign of his involvement anywhere.\n\nhttp://therealbarackobama.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/evelyn-pringles-operation-board-games-and-curtain-time-for-obama/\n\nby Evelyn Pringle May 16, 2008 - 8:06am\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThree days after the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Aiham Alsammarae, the former electricity minister convicted of corruption in Iraq, put up $2.7 million in property to help raise $8.5 million to free Tony Rezko from jail in Chicago, the Times reported that Alsammarae had contributed six times to Obama's presidential campaign.\n\nThe April 29, 2008 report also noted that before he escaped from jail in Bagdad in December 2006, and returned to Chicago, Obama's US Senate office had sought information about Alsammarae from the State Department on October 16, 2006 on behalf of Alsammarae's family while he was being held in jail in Iraq.\n\nAs usual, when busted on the contributions given in January, February and March, the Obama camp said it would donate Alsammarae's money to charity and his spokesman, Ben LaBolt, put out the standard line that Obama does not ever \"recall\" meeting Alsammarae.\n\nThe money missing due to Alsammarae's corruption in Iraq during the two years he served as electricity minister between August 2003 and May 2005 is estimated to be $2 billion.\n\nThe Operation Board Games investigation revealed that Alsammarae signed contracts worth $200 million that benefited both Rezko and the Iraqi-born billionaire, Nadhmi Auchi, who ended up with Riverside Park, a 62-acre lot in the Chicago Loop estimated to now be worth $2.5 billion.\n\nAs noted previously in this series, understanding the connections between Auchi and Riverside Park and all the players is the key to understanding Operation Board Games. Financing deals in the Chicago real estate industry were the focus of the investigation from the start and the financing deals involving Riverside Park specifically.\n\nOn September 29, 2005, Crain's Chicago Business news reported that General Mediterranean Holding, \"a Luxembourg-based conglomerate headed by Nadhmi Auchi, is buying Riverside Park, a yet-to-be-built development on a prime 62-acre parcel on Roosevelt Road,\" quoting Michael Rumman, the director of the Illinois Department of Central Management Services, as a consultant on the project.\n\nThe sale price was estimated to be about $130 million. Joseph Ryan, a local attorney representing GHM, told Crain's that Rezko would no longer be an investor in the project, but \"there's a possibility he may have a consultant's role in the project.\"\n\nCrain's noted that Rezko and Auchi were introduced by a mutual acquaintance in London, and said: \"They teamed up recently on a $150 million contract to build a power plant in Iraq.\"\n\n\"Auchi,\" Crain's also pointed out, \"received a 15-month suspended sentence in France after being convicted in 2003 for taking kickbacks from French oil giant Elf.\"\n\n\"And U.S. officials are investigating allegations of bribery involving a mobile phone contract in Iraq that recently was awarded to Orascom, an Egyptian firm in which Mr. Auchi is a shareholder,\" the report stated.\n\nOn May 30, 2006 Crain's reported that before the GMH deal, Rezko and Daniel Mahru, former co-owners of the real estate firm Rezmar, had piled up more than $100 million in debt on the property. \"A liquidity crisis in early 2005 resulted in a technical loan default, property documents show, forcing the eventual sale to Mr. Auchi,\" the report said.\n\nThe plan was to build 4,600 residential units and about 670,000-square-feet of retail space on the site. However, the development has now been stalled for years being the new owner Auchi is not allowed in this country and several of his surrogates who were supposed to be developing the project appear to be headed to prison.\n\nFuture plans are likely not good either being it's doubtful that many real estate developers in Chicago are eager to hook up with Auchi and Riverside Park at this stage of the game.\n\nNobody knows Auchi anymore\n\nWhen the news surfaced that Auchi had made a loan to Rezko a month before Obama and Rezko entered into a real estate deal to buy a mansion and lot for over $2 million in June 2005, rumors started flying about a dinner held in Chicago at the exclusive Four Season's Hotel in April 2004, for Auchi and other investors from the Middle East, attended by many top Illinois officials and Alsammarae.\n\nBefore long, the media was rehashing the fact that shortly after his visit to Illinois, Auchi did invest $10 million with Rezko in Riverside Park. On June 14, 2007, former Rezko associates told the New York Times that Obama dropped in at the Four Season's event at Rezko's request and his visit helped impress foreign guests.\n\n\"I remember that he had been on the campaign trail, and he was completely wiped out and exhausted,\" said Anthony Licata, identified as an attorney who represented Rezko on real estate deals.\n\n\"My recollection is that he drank ice tea, and he talked about how he was really making progress, and we were all excited to see him,\" Licata said.\n\nObama spokesman, Bill Burton told the Times it was not unusual for Obama to be \"shaking hands late in the Senate primary season.\"\n\n\"If someone recalls meeting him during this period,\" Burton said, \"Senator Obama has no reason to doubt it.\"\n\nLicata was an attorney for Riverside Park and an investor. He donated $1,000 to Obama's senate campaign six months after the Four Season's party and also gave $5,000 to the fund for Blagojevich's future presidential bid.\n\nOn February 26, 2008, an aide to Obama told the Times of London that Obama did attend an event at the Four Seasons but did not remember meeting Auchi. \"He shook a lot of hands and met a lot of people,\" the aide said. \"We do not remember individual people.\"\n\nTwo days later, Bill Burton told the Times: \"The bottom line is Obama does not recall ever meeting him [Mr Auchi].\"\n\nAll members of the \"Combine,\" have tried to distance themselves from Auchi's visit because as previously explained, he is not allowed in the US. However, the question that remains is how did he enter this country in April 2004, after his 2003 conviction in France.\n\nAccording to the February 28, 2008 Sun-Times: \"Auchi's London-based lawyer, Alasdair Pepper, wouldn't answer that.\"\n\n\"State Department and Homeland Security officials said they couldn't comment,\" according to the Times.\n\nDuring a March 14, 2008 interview, the Times asked Obama: \"Did you ever help Auchi enter the country?\"\n\nHe said, \"No.\" But when asked the follow-up question of whether \"his office\" helped Auchi enter the country, he replied, \"Not that I know of.\"\n\nOn January 28, 2008, Raw Story's Michael Roston reported that after rumors began spreading that Auchi may have met with Obama, \"In what appears to be a clumsy \"cleanup\" operation evidence of Auchi's visit to Illinois has now been deleted from two websites linked to his company, General Mediterranean Holding.\"\n\nThe reports in the media always say Rezko hosted the Four Season's event, when in fact Governor Rod Blagojevich directed the show.\n\nABC News first posted a link to photos showing Auchi meeting with Blagojevich on the site, \"Middle East Online.\" The description under a picture of Auchi and Blagojevich, still accessible on the internet a month ago, stated: \"Governor of the State of Illinois, Mr Rod Blagojevich hosted an official reception in honour of Mr Auchi.\"\n\nAnother picture, taken in the Chicago office of the President of the Illinois state senate bears the title: \"Illinois State Senate President Mr Emile Johns Jr. meets Mr Auchi.\"\n\nJones is often described as Obama's \"mentor.\" On February 26, 2007, the Washington Post noted that once he got to the state Senate, Obama \"became a political protege of current Senate President Emil Jones, a 35-year veteran of the legislature and one of the state's most influential black lawmakers.\"\n\nObama avoided directly answering questions about Auchi and Alsammarae until March 14, 2008, when he was asked whether he ever met them, during an interview with the Sun-Times. In response, he said, \"Tony called and asked if I could stop by because he had a number of friends that he had invited to dinner and he wanted me to meet them.\"\n\n\"I told him that I would be happy to come by if my schedule allowed it,\" he said. \"And it did.\"\n\nBut he said could not recall any names and apparently expects the public to believe that he made a special trip to a private dinner at an exclusive club and never thought to ask why Rezko was throwing a shindig for \"friends\" from the Middle East, or why they would want to meet an state senator from Illinois to begin with\n\nHowever, this is exactly what the public is being led to believe due to the fact that every time the subject comes up, the mainstream media repeats this ridiculous fabrication.\n\nTo begin with, Obama has continuously claimed that Rezko never asked him for favors. On November 5, 2006, the Sun-Times published his answers to questions that were submitted to him after the news of the real estate deal with Rezko surfaced, and Obama stated: \"I have never been asked to do anything to advance his business interests.\"\n\nA day later, on November 6, 2006, he told reporters in Waukegan Illinois, \"He had never asked me for anything. I'd never done anything for him.\"\n\nIn December 2006, he told the Washington Post: \"I've known him for 15 years.\"\n\n\"He had never asked me to do anything.\"\n\nIn a March 14, 2008 interview with the Tribune, Obama was asked whether he ever thought Rezko would expect something from their relationship, and he stated: \"No. Precisely because I had known him for years and he hadn't asked me for something.\"\n\nWhen asked why politicians were drawn to Rezko, he said: \"In my interactions with him, he was very gracious. He did not ask me for favors.\"\n\nFive days later, on March 19, Stuart Levine testified in the Rezko trial and told the jury he had flown Rezko's wife and children back to Chicago on a private jet from a vacation in Mexico because Rezko had to leave early to prepare for the dinner he was hosting for Auchi in Chicago. Rezko was hoping to convince Auchi to invest in Riverside Park, he told the jury.\n\nLevine said he attended the dinner with other guests that included Illinois Lt Governor Pat Quinn, Christopher Kelly, Jack Lavin, the head of Blagojevich's economic development agency, and Michael Rumman, director of the Department of Central Management Services.\n\nLevine's testimony and reports in the media always sounded like they were referring to one event at the Four Season's. But on April 14, 2008, Levine dropped a bombshell, when in response to questions for Rezko's attorney, he testified that the dinner he attended in Auchi's honor was held at Rezko's home and Obama and his wife Michelle were there.\n\nThe Tribune's Gavel-to-Gavel noted that, \"Rezko was trolling for investment capital for a South Loop development, and the party was part of his campaign to get Auchi to invest.\"\n\nThe Associated Press ran a follow-up story on April 14, 2008, calling Auchi a \"mysterious billionaire with his hands on a major chunk of Chicago real estate,\" and described his arrival in Illinois in April 2004, as a major event in which Lt Governor Quinn \"headed a welcoming delegation that greeted Auchi when his private plane touched down at Chicago's Midway Airport.\"\n\nThe article noted that Quinn personally rode downtown with Auchi and his family and that Quinn said he later attended the party for Auchi held at Rezko's home. The article also mentioned that Auchi was the guest of honor at another lavish dinner party at the Four Seasons, and said, \"Blagojevich was on hand for the festivities and posed for photos with the visiting tycoon.\"\n\nHowever, Blagojevich spokeswoman Abby Ottenhoff was quick to tell the Press: \"He has not met with or talked to Mr. Auchi since then.\"\n\nWhen Senate President Jones was asked if he remembered meeting Auchi, he asked: \"Who?\"\n\n\"I don't know who he is,\" Jones told the Associated Press.\n\nRegarding the photo of him and Auchi, Jones' press secretary said: \"It was strictly a grip and grin.\"\n\n\"He doesn't even remember it.\"\n\nThe line from Obama spokesman, Ben LaBolt, was again: \"As he has said previously, Senator Obama does not recall meeting Nadhmi Auchi at any time or on any occasion, and this includes any event that may have been held for Mr. Auchi.\"\n\n\"Senator and Mrs. Obama have no recollection of attending any such event,\" he stated.\n\nBut on April 16, 2008, Sun-Times columnist, Michael Sneed, reported that Obama had even made toasts at Rezko's party, and wrote:\n\n\"Dem presidential contender Barack Obama's handlers may be telling the press Obama has NO \"recollection\" of a 2004 party at influence peddler Tony Rezko's Wilmette house, but a top Sneed source claims Obama not only gave Rezko's guest of honor, Iraqi billionaire Nadhmi Auchi, a big welcome . . . but he made a few toasts!\"\n\nIn an April 26, 2008, interview with Tribune reporter, John McCormick, Obama did not deny that he and Michelle were at the party but said he did not recall being there, stating:\n\n\"I have to say that I just don't recall it. I mean this has been, I guess, four years ago. My understanding, through his lawyer, Mr. Auchi doesn't recall meeting me and you know, I can't speak for other people's recollections.\n\n\"But I've said publicly, on many occasions, that I had a social relationship with Mr. Rezko.\"\n\nThe last comment is ridiculous because what Obama has said on \"many occasions,\" is he only had lunch or breakfast with Rezko once or twice a year and he and Michelle had dinner with Rezko only three or four times in the 15 years they knew each other. When asked whether Rezko may have been using him to impress potential investors, Obama replied:\n\n\"I just don't have a recollection of the event. As I said, I was in the middle of running a U.S. Senate race. So, you know, I was speaking all the time, probably six, seven, eight times a day.\"\n\n\"Right,\" McCormick said, \"but why go to this event that was specifically designed for Rezko investors?\"\n\n\"As I said, I have no recollection of the event. Alright?\" Obama replied. When asked whether he would remember making a toast to Auchi, Obama stated:\n\n\"I'm fairly certain I would remember giving a specific toast to somebody. Keep in mind, though, that this was right in the midst of my U.S. Senate campaign, so I was doing three or four events a day.\n\n\"So, I mean, there were very few events where I wasn't speaking on anything. But I have no recollection of this particular event.\"\n\nHowever, the Tribune has obtained a copy of an Obama \"upcoming events\" schedule on his old Senate campaign web site which shows Obama had no personal campaign activities on April 3, 2004, the day of the party.\n\nRiverside Park funds legal defense for Board Games defendants\n\nAlthough revelations about the $3.5 million loan immediately prior to the Rezko-Obama real estate deal led to a few stories in the press, it was Auchi's second $3.5 million loan in April 2007, that drew the most headlines after Rezko was thrown in jail in January 2008.\n\nAfter he was indicted, Rezko claimed he was flat broke and was living off $7,500 a month from friends and family. In a November 17, 2006 letter to the court, his attorney reported there were no assets being held in his name or for his benefit abroad, and that, other than an inactive contract in Iraq, he \"has no foreign assets, or holdings, or business interests.\"\n\nRezko even told the court he had no money for his legal defense. In a hearing on January 16, 2007, the judge asked Rezko: \"How are you paying Mr. Duffy?\"\n\n\"I have been very fortunate to have the family I have and to have some friends that I have. I've been very fortunate,\" he said.\n\n\"So, family members and friends of paying your legal bill?\" she asked. \"Yes, your Honor,\" Rezko replied.\n\n\"I can confirm that, your Honor,\" Duffy told the judge. He went on to tell the court that he had met with members of Rezko's church, and they \"have been extremely supportive and have come forward.\"\n\n\"Mr. Rezko has not provided us any money since his indictment,\" Duffy told the court.\n\nRezko also told the judge Rita Rezko had sold the lot next door to Obama but had not received a dime. \"Your Honor,\" he said, \"my wife sold the land, too, in Hyde Park the last few weeks.\"\n\n\"Did she personally own it or did an L.L.C. own it?\" the judge asked. \"She owned it in a trust, I believe,\" Rezko said.\n\n\"How much did she get for the land?\" the judge asked.\n\n\"A hundred-twenty-thousand was in excess of the mortgage on the land, and that hundred-twenty-thousand went all in full to the buyer for a previous debt,\" Rezko said.\n\n\"So, she didn't walk away with any cash?\" the judge asked. \"Not one dollar,\" he stated.\n\n\"Other than the 62 acres, your Honor, I do not have any other assets,\" Rezko told her.\n\n\"If the property is sold today for $200 million,\" he said, \"I will not receive one dollar from the proceeds.\"\n\nThe judge specifically asked whether he could get Auchi to wire him say $100,000 if he wanted it and Rezko basically said he did not know because he never asked.\n\nHowever, Duffy told the judge, \"although he has a personal relationship with the Chairman -- or he believes he does -- I want you to understand I don't think Mr. Rezko could call up on the phone and ask for favors or money from them.\"\n\nAt a February 27, 2007 hearing, regarding Riverside Park, the judge told Rezko: \"If something changesˆand I believe I have advised you of this or ordered this before, but if not I want to make clear. If something changes with respect to the status of the 62 acres that we talked about and that I asked you multiple questions on, you must notify the Court immediately.\"\n\nRezko was allowed to remain free after posting $2 million bond secured by properties of family and friends. But in January 2008, the judge was informed that Auchi was funneling money from foreign banks via the Chicago law firm of Freeborn & Peters, to fund Rezko's legal defense and she threw him in jail.\n\nIn the motion to revoke bail, prosecutors said Rezko \"has had a long-standing relationship\" with the Freeborn. Freeborn has represented Rezko \"in litigation with franchisor Papa John's Pizza,\" and \"appears to represent Rezko in currently pending civil litigation,\" they wrote.\n\nThe government alleged the wire transfers showed Rezko had access to overseas funds that could enable him to flee and hide out in countries without extradition treaties with the US. In the motion, prosecutors said Rezko's obtaining money originating in Lebanon was consistent with his continuing ties to the Middle East and overseas travel, and noted that:\n\n\"Between approximately November 2005 and October 2006, Rezko took multiple trips to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Qatar.\n\n\"Several of Rezko's overseas trips included Rezko traveling through, and spending time in, Syria and Lebanon. The United States does not have extradition treaties with Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Syria, or Lebanon.\"\n\n\"Through records from Northern Trust Bank,\" prosecutors wrote, \"the government has learned there was an approximately $3.5 million wire transfer in April 2007 of which a substantial portion immediately was directed to Rezko's relatives.\"\n\nNorthern Trust being the same entity holding the confidential Land Trust for Obama's mansion and 10-foot lot. Prosecutors said within a week, the $3.5 million was moved to another account at Northern Trust, the \"client fund account,\" held by the Freeborn firm.\n\nA brief filed by Rezko on January 29, 2008, said, \"his business partner had agreed to loan him $3.5 million for legal expenses and to support his family pending trial.\"\n\nIn fact, $1.9 million went to law firms. In addition, on July 25, 2007, GMH wired an additional $200,000. \"This transfer was also apparently for Rezko's legal fees,\" prosecutors wrote in their motion. Another $200,000 went to reimburse people who had advanced money for legal fees or living expenses and at least $89,000 was paid to other attorneys and accountants, according to the filings.\n\nIn the motion, prosecutors also told the court: \"Contrary to Rezko's November 2006 representation to the court that he had no business interests abroad,\" a confidential informant, \"informed the government that Rezko has been interested in working on real estate deals in Syria on property owned by Auchi.\"\n\nAccording the informant, \"Auchi owned 3 or 4 properties, including one commercial retail shopping center, and Rezko was interested in assisting in the development of the property.\"\n\nThe motion further stated, \"Rezko has repeatedly informed the Court that his interest in the 62-acre Property is illiquid, speculative, and only subject to his getting value from it after satisfaction of large prior existing debts.\"\n\nSpecifically, that it remains to be determined whether this asset is of significant value, and \"how that value can be liquidated given the project's value is tied to the development of what is currently a 62 acre vacant lot,\" prosecutors noted.\n\nThe motion goes on to state that in contrast to Rezko's representations, the government learned that \"in September 2006, just a few months\" before Rezko represented that his interest was illiquid and speculative, \"Rezko attempted to post as collateral for a loan part of his interest in the 62 Acre Property.\"\n\n\"Further,\" prosecutors wrote, \"on December 12, 2007, the government obtained documents that indicate that Rezko has transferred, restructured, and/or sold significant portions of his interest in the 62 Acre Property.\"\n\nSpecifically, they noted that an August 10, 2007, Settlement Agreement, signed by Rezko and Christopher Kelly showed Rezko transferred \"a portion of his interest\" in Riverside Park to Kelly in exchange for the forgiveness of approximately $1.7 million in loans that Kelly made through his business to Rezko between late 2002 and 2006.\n\nEven more troubling, prosecutors said, between January 2007 and August 2007, \"unbeknownst to at least the government,\" Rezko liquidated an additional 60% share of the company that held Rezko ownership in Riverside Park to General Mediterranean Holdings affiliate, Orifarm.\n\nAlthough many creditors are waiting to be paid from Rezko's sale of Riverside Park, prosecutors said, it appears \"Rezko is handpicking the creditors that will be repaid while other creditors,\" some who are owed considerably more than Kelly, \"are unaware that Rezko's one remaining significant asset is being distributed in a manner that will impede their ability to be made whole.\"\n\nA few days later, prosecutors were no doubt outraged to learn that Auchi had apparently become legal defense fund for Board Game defendants who keep the secrets. On February 7, 2008, Mike Robinson reported another: \"Indicted Blagojevich fundraiser got loan from Iraqi billionaire,\" in the Associated Press.\n\nChristopher Kelly \"has arranged to get a loan from the same Iraqi billionaire whose $3.5 million payment got another member of the governor's inner circle thrown in jail,\" he wrote. Kelly received the loan five days before Rezko's bail was revoked, and he pledged all of his shares in a Nevada land partnership as collateral, Robinson found.\n\nOn April 14, 2008, the Associated Press noted that in 2005, reports in Chicago said Auchi had purchased the entire property, but \"it seems Rezko was able to hang onto at least some shares in the land thr"
