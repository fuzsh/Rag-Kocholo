        "text": "On leaving school Mark knew he wanted a career in the built environment, so completed an apprenticeship as a Bricklayer. He then went on to become a Building Inspector for a Local Authority and subsequently took up a position as a Building Surveyor, controlling large scale housing regeneration projects.\n\nMark graduated from Northumbria University in 1999 after studying as a part time student, whilst employed as a Building Surveyor for a Local Authority in the North East.\n\nDuring this time Mark delivered part time, evening lectures at Redcar and Cleveland College. After three years of dipping his foot in the academic water, he decided to take the big leap and lecture full time at the college and finally here at Northumbria University. Mark is currently Senior Lecturer in Building Surveying and Programme Leader for Foundation Degree Building Surveying in the School of the Built and Natural Environment.\n\nHis academic interests include housing renovations and the building regulations and trying to make them interesting and easy to read.\n\nMarks interests are motorcycling to Whitby every Thursday night in the summer and working out at the sports centre here at the university."
