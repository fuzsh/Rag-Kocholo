        "text": "PHOENIX — An Arizona grand jury has indicted a slew of allies of former President Donald Trump for their efforts to try to keep him in power after the 2020 election.\n\nEleven defendants submitted documentation falsely claiming Trump, not President Biden, won the state's popular vote in 2020. Seven others were indicted for their broader involvement in post-election activities.\n\nThose seven are former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, along with 2020 Trump campaign lawyers and aides Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn, Christina Bobb, Jenna Ellis and Michael Roman.\n\nThe 11 so-called \"fake electors\" had their names released Wednesday, while the seven others had their names redacted until they had been served. NPR was able to identify some of them Wednesday, based on information included in the indictment. The remaining names were released Friday.\n\nThe indictment from Attorney General Kris Mayes includes nine criminal counts, including felony fraud, forgery and conspiracy.\n\n\"The people of Arizona elected President Biden,\" Mayes says in a video statement. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency.\"\n\nShe adds: \"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined. It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment also cites five unindicted co-conspirators, including \"a former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election\" — Trump — and former members of the Arizona Legislature.\n\nArizona is now the 4th state where \"fake electors\" have been charged\n\nThe indictment makes Arizona the fourth state where charges have been brought against individuals involved in \"fake elector\" schemes that sought to undermine Biden's victory over Trump.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada have already charged individuals accused of participating in similar schemes in those states. In another swing state, Wisconsin, fake electors admitted to their roles as part of civil settlements.\n\nThe slate of fake electors charged in Arizona includes several influential Republicans, including sitting state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern. Former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, former party Executive Director Greg Safsten and RNC Committeeman Tyler Bowyer also signed documents transmitted to the federal government. Bowyer is also an executive with Turning Point Action, the advocacy arm of an Arizona-based right wing group founded by Trump ally Charlie Kirk.\n\nOthers indicted are Nancy Cottle, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino and Michael Ward.\n\nHoffman quickly responded to the charges, saying in a statement: \"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party also condemned the charges, saying in a statement that \"they do nothing but undermine the trust in our state's legal processes and are clearly designed to silence dissent and weaponize the law against political opponents.\"\n\nAG Mayes urged patience with charges\n\nThe indictments mark a significant step forward in an investigation that began a year ago after Mayes, a Democrat who was elected attorney general in 2022 by just 280 votes, took office in early 2023.\n\nSome Democrats criticized Mayes over the pace of that investigation, which proceeded largely behind closed doors as grand juries in other states indicted alleged participants in the fake electors scheme.\n\nBut Mayes urged patience, pointing out that she took office after many of the officials pursuing the case in other states. Her predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, did not investigate the case.\n\n\"The investigators and attorneys assigned to this case took the necessary time to thoroughly piece together the details of the events that began nearly four years ago,\" Mayes says in the video.\n\nThere were signs the case was picking up steam in recent months, though. In December, the investigators met with former Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, a lead architect of the fake elector scheme who's pleaded guilty to a felony charge in Georgia.\n\nTrump himself faces charges in Georgia, as do Meadows, Giuliani, Eastman and Roman, among others. Ellis also pleaded guilty in the Georgia election interference case. Bobb, a former OAN reporter, now works for the Republican National Committee on \"election integrity\" issues.\n\nThe Arizona indictment comes as Trump faces jurors in a hush money case in New York City. Trump is the first former president to be charged criminally."
