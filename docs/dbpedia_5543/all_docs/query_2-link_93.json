        "text": "GOP Presidential Debate: How to Watch the Third and Final Republican Primary Debate Online\n\nThe 2024 GOP presidential candidates are set to gather for the third and last Republican primary debate. For those keen on watching the final Republican debate online, various streaming options are available\n\n08 Nov, 2023, 02:02 AM IST\n\nWho takes advantage of Donald Trump's absence and other things to watch in the Republican debate\n\nEight Republican candidates will meet on the debate stage for the first time Wednesday night in what may be the biggest moment in the GOP's young 2024 presidential primary so far. The overwhelming front-runner in the contest, former President Donald Trump, won't participate. He says he's so far ahead that he'd be helping his opponents by showing up.\n\n23 Aug, 2023, 02:16 PM IST\n\nSenate passes defense bill with bipartisan support, but clash looms with House over social issues\n\nThe two chambers will now have to write a final bill, a test of the deeply divided House, in particular, as the traditionally bipartisan legislation was swept up in the disputes over race, equity and women's health care that have been political priorities for the Republican party. Wicker said talks with the House will start \"very soon\" and he feels confident they will be able to pass the legislation, as Congress has annually since 1961.\n\n28 Jul, 2023, 09:30 AM IST\n\nDonald Trump prepares to launch third campaign for the White House\n\n\"He's been on the mound and lost three straight games. If we want to start winning, we need someone else on the mound. And we've got a very strong bench that can come out,\" Romney said. \"I know, there's some fans that love him. Just like, you know, an aging pitcher, they're always fans that want to keep them there forever. But if you keep losing games, try to put some new players on the field.\"\n\n15 Nov, 2022, 10:49 AM IST\n\nAn emboldened Biden now faces a tough choice about his own future\n\nThe president’s fellow Democrats are flocking to cameras to give him credit. “This victory belongs to Joe Biden,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., his onetime rival, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. His advisers sound almost giddy, using words like “miracle” and “biblical” to describe the election.\n\n14 Nov, 2022, 03:52 PM IST\n\nSudden abortion focus shakes midterm election landscape\n\nWhile the Democrats decried the draft, they suddenly have a clear, unifying message. The real possibility that abortion could be outlawed in dozens of states in the coming months could animate their dejected base - especially young voters, people of color and suburban women, who are unhappy with the pace of progress under Democratic leadership in Washington.\n\n04 May, 2022, 11:01 AM IST\n\nPresident Biden's approval rating hits new low at one year mark, according to AP-NORC poll\n\nThe latest poll shows that Americans' confidence in Biden's handling of the pandemic - seen as a strength early in his administration - has further eroded as the omicron variant strains the health care system and further exhausts an American electorate that had hoped life would be back to a semblance of normalcy by now.\n\n20 Jan, 2022, 11:52 AM IST\n\nJoint Chiefs chairman calls Afghan war a 'strategic failure'\n\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the committee, when pressed, that it had been his personal opinion that at least 2,500 U.S. troops were needed to guard against a collapse of the Kabul government and a return to Taliban rule.\n\n29 Sep, 2021, 09:54 AM IST\n\nKathy Hochul to take center stage as scandal ends Cuomo's reign\n\nHochul will become the state's first female governor once Cuomo's resignation is effective in two weeks.\n\n10 Aug, 2021, 10:32 PM IST\n\nDonald Trump's grievances cloud Republican agenda heading into 2022\n\nThe lack of a forward-looking agenda stands in stark contrast to successful midterm elections of past years, particularly 1994 and 2010, when Republicans swept into power after staking clear positions on health care, federal spending and crime, among other issues.\n\n06 Jun, 2021, 07:40 PM IST\n\nPresident-elect? GOP may wait for January to say Joe Biden won\n\nTuesday's deadline for states to certify their elections, once viewed as a pivot point for Republicans to mark Biden's win, came and went without much comment. Next week's Dec. 14 Electoral College deadline may produce just a few more congratulatory GOP calls to Biden.\n\n09 Dec, 2020, 12:32 PM IST\n\nTwitter, Facebook CEOs defend election actions, promise more\n\nTwitter and Facebook have both slapped a misinformation label on some content from Trump, most notably his assertions linking voting by mail to fraud.\n\n17 Nov, 2020, 11:49 PM IST\n\nU.S. Poll results: Democrats losing paths to Senate control as GOP hangs on\n\nWhile Democrats picked up must-win seats in Colorado and Arizona, they suffered a setback in Alabama, and Republicans held their own in one race after another, dramatically limiting the places where Democrats hoped to make inroads.\n\n04 Nov, 2020, 03:34 PM IST"
