        "text": "Norman Ornstein\n\nA series of sex scandals has recently reverberated through the military academies and other places. In the past, we have had questions about misuse of funds and bloated budgets. As we go through our current period of fiscal retrenchment, there are questions about whether military spending entails taking money away from other things. Might the American people have a different reaction to the military once the wars end and people have time to reflect? Our enormous respect for the military relative to other institutions has not been consistent throughout the nation’s history. We have witnessed hostility and backlash before. Do you see any signs that we might go from a 78 percent approval rating to a somewhat lower figure? How significant is it to people within the military to have this strong standing with the American public?\n\nKarl Eikenberry\n\nTwo points about what is going wrong. The first involves the issue of oversight: that is, congressional oversight of the military as well as the media’s role in examining our military in order to bring problems to light. I would reiterate that some of the problem here relates to the disconnect between the volunteer force and the greater society. For example, in the last year, more than fifty American and coalition (NATO) soldiers have been murdered by their purported allies from the Afghan army and police forces. To date, there has been no serious congressional hearing on the topic. Let’s suppose that a draft army could do in Afghanistan what the volunteer force is doing. If we had a draft army there and there had been more than fifty American and NATO soldiers dead at the hands of Afghan soldiers and policemen, wouldn’t there have been a congressional hearing by now? Wouldn’t the American people have demanded a hearing?\n\nMy second point has to do with accountability within the military. The wars we are fighting right now are the kind that may drag on for many years. They are also wars taking place in the context of 24/7 communications, where anyone with an iPhone can capture something that in the past probably never would have been widely shared or remarked upon. We are in a new era in terms of accountability of our senior leadership. General Charles Krulak, the Commandant of the Marine Corps in the late 1990s, wrote an article called “The Strategic Corporal.” He argued that in today’s world, the misconduct of a corporal — a junior, noncommissioned officer — could have strategic consequences for a military campaign. Think about the recent example of an American sergeant who reportedly went outside his forward operating base and killed sixteen Afghans. At what point do strategic commanders have to take responsibility for the missteps of strategic corporals, and at what point must they go back to the president, the commander-in-chief, and admit that a strategy being pursued is too high-risk? When the U.S. president has to apologize publicly three times in one month, as he did in March 2012, for the misconduct of our armed forces, then neither he nor our country is being well served.\n\nAs we end our combat operations in Afghanistan, I believe that there will be some reevalution of our armed forces by the American people. We look at our forces very differently when we are at war than when we are at peace.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nIn 2008, the fundamentalist religious group Focus on the Family released a report speculating about what the year 2012 would be like if Barack Obama won the 2008 election. The report included a section on how the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell would doom society and the military. The complete lack of discussion following the end of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell suggests that Focus on the Family was not only misguided, but completely off the mark. What are your observations of how the military has handled this change?\n\nKarl Eikenberry\n\nIt was a set of norms that changed over time. Our younger officers and noncommissioned officers reflect mainstream America on this issue, and they are perfectly comfortable with it.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nI want to turn to the broader subject of polarization and the courts. I was at a panel at Yale Law School a few years ago, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Six former clerks to justices from Brown talked about how the justices believed that their decision would have an earth-shaking effect on society, and therefore unanimity in the decision would be important not just for the Court and its integrity but for society as a whole. It wasn’t silent acquiescence on the part of a minority.\n\nDiane, how do you see political polarization affecting judges today? There is a perception that you can predict the behavior of judges based on who appointed them, more so than by the nature of the cases they are considering. This view seems to taint our opinion of the entire judiciary, from the Supreme Court on down, and it affects overall public confidence in the courts.\n\nDiane Wood\n\nSince the time of Brown, a huge archive of materials has become available, showing exactly how the justices came to that decision. Each justice reached the conclusion that it was the right decision, and so not only were they unanimous in Brown, they were unanimous almost through the 1950s, up until Cooper v. Aaron in 1958, when each justice famously published under his individual name. After that, unanimity began to fall off.\n\nThe norm of coming together as a unanimous Court is about finding common ground; it is not “I’ll vote for you in this case because you’ll vote for me in the next case.” In my experience, that never happens, and I don’t think it happens at the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the effort to find common ground has been devalued. Nobody thinks a thing of dissenting opinions, sometimes very sharp ones. People write concurring opinions when they are so moved, and it deprives us of a sense that there is a clear answer in the law. Chief Justice Roberts, during his confirmation hearings and in some subsequent speeches, expressed the hope that he might be able to bring back a greater tradition of unanimity. This lasted for about a term, but once the Court started grappling with more difficult cases, it evaporated.\n\nOne could say that the role of judges is to “get the Constitution right,” no matter how much china is broken in the process, and no matter what it does to the judiciary’s relationship with the other branches of government. Or one could contrast this view with another that says judges should follow the old fashioned, common law approach of incrementalism, taking a small step here, a small step there, and waiting to see what happens. Sadly, judges do not have a better crystal ball than anyone else, and when courts try to write too broadly, the law of unintended consequences visits with a vengeance. That’s in part what we are seeing with Citizens United. Nobody was talking about Caperton or the judicial speech case in Minnesota. Someone either needs to connect the dots much better or needs to stick to an incrementalist approach–which takes me back to the issue of unanimity. If you take only a small step, it is sometimes easier to get everyone marching in the same direction.\n\nThe problem has not affected the lower courts as much because we have mandatory jurisdiction. The dissent rate is about 3.5 percent in the lower courts, compared to something like 35 percent at the Supreme Court. The lower courts have to take all cases, a greater number of which have fairly clear answers. It does not matter which president appointed the judge; he or she is going to understand the case the same way.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nThe Citizens United decision, which was written by Justice Kennedy, is breathtakingly naive about what happens in the real world of politics and the real world more generally. That must partly be because you have a justice who has never been in that real world. His entire life has been cloistered, whether in law firms or the judiciary. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who had a somewhat different view of these issues, had been an elected politician, the last such member of the Court. In contrast, a majority of the Warren Court had been politicians before serving as justices. We see this problem now at almost all levels of the federal judiciary.\n\nNo doubt, part of the reason why judges either come out of the academy or move from one level of the judiciary to the other is because it is easier to predict how they will rule from the bench, as opposed to a politician who would perhaps be more concerned with continuing his legacy for many years after serving. Could you reflect on whether it would be better if the judiciary had a wider range of people drawn from other professions, including, but not limited to, politics.\n\nDiane Wood\n\nIt is very helpful to have judges from a variety of backgrounds, and there are a number of ways to secure a diversity of experience. Some people are involved in their communities, whether they have been working as prosecutors or judges or academics; other people have focused on other kinds of things. In our court, the Seventh Circuit, we have former prosecutors, former district judges, and some notable academics. Some people have served in the executive branch; other people, not. Collectively, we bring a fair amount of experience to the table.\n\nBut one of the reasons why diversity of experience seems to be diminishing at the Supreme Court level is the confirmation process, which is an aspect of our system that is close to broken. It’s very distressing to me personally. Our court has had a vacancy for three years. How can that be? We are just a court of appeals in the middle of the country, and yet highly qualified people are refusing to allow their names to be considered for judgeships. Whenever there is a district court vacancy, Senators Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk in Illinois put together a committee, and people can submit résumés to the committee. But people are not sending in their résumés because they do not want to go through the confirmation process. They view the process as polarized, lengthy, and intrusive. So who is left to confirm? Somebody who has been cloistered, or someone who has never said anything. These are not people who have been living in the real world. It is very troublesome, and we at least need to acknowledge that we have created a very unsatisfactory bar for someone to pass before he or she can move into the federal courts.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nPhil, could you reflect on the American people’s low approval rating for Congress and the challenge it poses. Have governors, state legislators, and mayors fared better than Congress? Is the problem getting bigger?\n\nPhilip Bredesen\n\nI’m not quite as discouraged about the issue of the popularity of people in public life. It is perfectly possible for our leaders to conduct themselves in a way that leads to approval from the public. The trick is to approach the task with a fundamental respect for the points of view of all people. If you come into office and suddenly identify as a Democrat or Republican and then sign on to whatever the orthodoxy is, you will not get that kind of respect. But if you approach the job by saying, for example, “I know none of those tea party people will vote for me, but they have some points. Their issues about the size of government and the role of states ought to be discussed. I don’t like the context in which they are coming up, but they are valid points.”\n\nPublic officials must be able to convey that they have a genuine regard for and understanding of the issues that are important to the people they serve, who are the voters and taxpayers. We must resist the elitist insider game that politics has become in this country. If we aim for these goals, our leaders will generate public confidence despite differences in background, party, and ideology.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nMy collaborator Tom Mann and I have taken journalists to task for what we call “the sin of false equivalence.” Groups on the left and the right are ready to pounce anytime they think they are being treated unfairly. As a response to our criticism, I received an email message from a veteran reporter covering Congress who said, “You don’t understand, it is our job to report both sides of the story.” I replied: “I thought your job was to report the truth. Sometimes there are multiple sides of a story, sometimes there aren’t.” Judy, how worried are journalists about this problem? Is there any way out of the dilemma?\n\nJudy Woodruff\n\nIt troubles us to different degrees, and I think it depends on where you sit and what news organization you are with. We think about it every day at the NewsHour as we consider how to address the main stories of that day. For example, you could argue that a story on immigration has ten sides, not just two. But if we are not turning the entire program over to immigration, and thus have only nine or ten minutes for the segment, we try to figure out the two spokespeople on either side (or maybe sometimes it’s three or four) who will give a full sense of the argument.\n\nI think what you are getting at, Norm, is a problem that I see in all the media at different times. It is the sense that if you put two people out there and then let them argue, you are going to learn something. That’s not always the case because if they are simply repeating the party line on each side, then you haven’t really advanced understanding. So it does require probing and pushing on the part of the interviewer. But the audience, which is already on the edge of its seat, and which is accustomed to seeing what is more accurately described as opinion journalism, is expecting the moderator to pick up on their point of view. They expect us to ask the questions that will elicit the answers they want to hear.\n\nIn the past, viewers and listeners would write letters to network ombudsmen and individual correspondents. Now we actively solicit audience responses, and they flood us with email messages and online comments. In many ways, it is terrific that we hear from so many members of the public. On the other hand, I sense that many of these people write because they want us to weigh in on their side. The left wants us to weigh in on the left; the right wants us to weigh in on the right. All we can do is try to ask tough, appropriate questions on both sides and see where it lands – and even that is not always satisfying.\n\nThe concept of “truth” is tricky because one side will say that it sees the truth this way, and the other side will say it sees the truth another way. For instance, you could state that the federal deficit is $1.6 trillion, but somebody might ask, “How did you get that figure?” Then you enter a never-ending discussion about numbers that leads you down a rabbit hole.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nOver the last fifteen years or so, public support for doing something about climate change has declined. I would argue that a good part of the reason for that is because news shows will feature one voice from the 99.5 percent of scientists who have reached consensus on what is happening in the world and one voice from the 0.5 percent who haven’t, and then inevitably will treat them as if they are equal. My guess is that if we had a debate today about whether the world is flat, a news show would find the 0.5 percent of scientists who think the world is flat. And then we would begin to see skepticism in the broader public about whether the world is not flat.\n\nJudy Woodruff\n\nWhat we try to do when we begin a discussion on a topic such as climate change is say, “99 percent of scientists, according to this respected society, that respected institute, and this respected think tank, say X; but there is still a group arguing Y.” We will put two or three people on the program, or we will do a report in which we interview several people, and we try to put the arguments in context. But believe me, no matter what you do, you hear from a very loud and unhappy other side. Just recently, there was a development in terms of climate change research, and a respected scientist who had been on the skeptical side moved to the other side. We tried to explain the background and put everything in context, but there were still screams from the skeptics saying that we had not given their side enough attention.\n\nWe can and should reflect what the public says, but we still have a job to do, which is to report the news and try to reflect as many different sides of an argument as possible. We can’t collapse every day in anguish because not every person is happy with what we are doing.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nMarty, could you comment on this issue specifically from the perspective of newspaper journalism.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nWhat are The Boston Globe's rivals? Is it the Boston Herald? Politico? Is it the various and sundry blogs in some of these alternative media that you refer to? Has your view changed with regard to your rivals?\n\nMartin Baron\n\nIt has changed. In the past, the primary rival would have been the other newspaper in town. But you have to define what you mean by rival. Do you mean rivals for getting stories and information, or do you mean a rival for revenue? Those are two different things. Many people have interpreted the decline of revenue for media outlets as a decline in audience, but in fact we have seen a dramatic increase. The Boston Globe now has an online audience of six to seven million unique visitors per month. That’s an extraordinary number that we never would have had with a print paper alone. People around the country and the world now have access to information in the Globe.\n\nToday our greatest rivals for revenue are websites such as Google News, Facebook, YouTube, and Yahoo. These sites are increasingly going after not just national advertisers but local advertisers, too. In terms of competition for information, I’m always tempted to say we have no competition; but we do of course have competition from other news outlets.\n\nNewspapers are the primary source of original information in any local community, and there is more reporting happening at the local level than at the national level. Most investigative reporting, for instance, happens at the local level, and a newspaper typically has a reporting staff far larger than any other media outlet in its community. In fact, the newspaper’s reporting staff is generally larger than that of all those other media outlets combined. Several years ago, Pew studied the question, how does news happen? Where does it come from? Who originates the stories? Focusing on the city of Baltimore, Pew determined that 95 percent of original stories came from newspapers in the city.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nThe Washington Post used to have a stringer or a reporter go to every school board meeting in the counties around D.C. They do not do that anymore because they cannot afford it. How severe is the challenge to journalism’s watchdog role, whether at the level of the school boards, which now have no one watching them (unless they are televised), or in Congress, where we no longer have reporters digging into the transactions of individual members.\n\nMartin Baron\n\nWe are tremendously challenged. Many large metropolitan newspapers have eliminated their Washington bureaus over the last ten years, which means that they do not cover their congressional delegations. They may try to cover them from their hometown, but they typically do not. Many of these same newspapers have eliminated or sharply cut back coverage of their state legislatures and their governors. After I left The Miami Herald, where I had served as editor, the paper combined bureaus with the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times). There are fewer people covering the legislature and the governor in the state of Florida, and that is a matter of great concern.\n\nAt the local level, institutions like school boards, courts, and police departments require not only day-to-day coverage but also deeper investigative reports. Many newspapers no longer have the resources to do that. Some others, much to their credit, continue to do that kind of work, and if you look at who receives the Pulitzer Prizes from year to year, you see that many local papers are still doing very important and courageous work investigating their local institutions. But a lot of that work is tremendously expensive. At the Globe, for example, we initiated the investigation into the cover-up of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. That cost us well over $1 million in one year, and that’s probably a minimum of what it cost us to do that work over the course of a year. Then you face the challenge of potential libel suits and court judgments. Many papers (and some newspaper owners) have decided that they do not want the flack or the expense that come with investigative reporting. They don’t think it is necessary or that it can be, to use the word that is bandied about so often, monetized as a business proposition. Indeed, there is some question as to whether it can be monetized, whether the kind of money that is being spent can be earned back.\n\nAlex Jones\n\nAny news organization, but especially any newspaper, that thinks investigative journalism is not in its financial interest is headed for bankruptcy. The very thing that will keep these institutions in business is that brand of reporting.There is no question about the muscle and bone being cut away from statehouse reporting or local beat reporting that leads to deeper investigations. However, some other entities have stepped in to fill the gap. For instance, journalism schools around the country are now doing serious reporting. Some foundations are funding specific projects that require the kinds of reporting that have suffered the most cuts.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nI want to invite those from the first part of our panel to add their comments or ask any questions they have.\n\nKarl Eikenberry\n\nDavid Ignatius, of The Washington Post, commented that embedded reporting “comes at a price.” He continued: “We’re observing these wars from just one perspective, not seeing them for the whole. When you see my byline from Kandahar, Kabul, Basra, you should not think of me going out among the ordinary people, asking questions on all sides. I’m usually inside an American military bubble, and that vantage point has value, but it’s hardly the full picture. I fear that embedded media is becoming the norm, and not just when it comes to war.” I’d like to hear any thoughts from fellow panelists on this.\n\nJudy Woodruff\n\nHe is absolutely right to be concerned. When reporting from a war zone, it is incumbent on correspondents to make very clear what their limits are. I would also add that this is a casualty of money. So many news organizations covered the hot part of the Iraq War, but when it ground down, they pulled their reporters out. It cost so much to keep reporters there and to keep them safe. The same has been true in Afghanistan; I couldn’t say how many reporters are really covering Afghanistan anymore. It is a function of revenue and money, and it is a much bigger question than we have time to deal with this morning. But I will say that ever since people learned that they can get the news for free online, the industry has been in a kind of crisis. We will figure it out, but it’s a struggle.\n\nDiane Wood\n\nI want to go back to our broadest topic — stewarding democracy — to point out that the move online raises more questions than simply how news organizations can make money. Many people in our country still do not have access to technologies that would allow them to get news online, yet they might be able to pick up a newspaper on the street. I worry that we are excluding them, and that this may be another example of how we are, in fact, spreading apart as opposed to coming together as a society.\n\nPhilip Bredesen\n\nIn listening to the discussion, I was struck by the ease with which everyone slipped into this notion of reporting as being two-sided, with a spokesperson for one side and a spokesperson for the other. By casting stories in this way, do we immediately set up a “good versus bad” dichotomy that obscures the nuances of an issue and encourages head-butting between spokespeople?\n\nJudy Woodruff\n\nI was speaking in shorthand when I talked about getting the two sides of an issue. It’s not as if we plunge in and take only the RNC talking points and the DNC talking points; we put more thought into it than that. But it is absolutely true that the more folks we can talk to, the better. And this includes both those in the middle and those who are firmly on each side. We should not shut out the extremes, keeping in mind what percentage of the population they represent. We sometimes hear from viewers who ask, “Why don’t you ever cover the far left? You’re always covering the far right position on, say, the role of religion in politics, but you’re not covering the far left.”\n\nMartin Baron\n\nI hope I did not slip into the notion that we have two sides, because I don’t see it that way. These stories have many sides or no sides. It is a matter of finding out what is really going on, and that is the bulk of what we try to do. We also have to be careful not to view all these stories in a political framework: that it’s just talking heads debating political issues. In fact, the issues relate to what is happening in society at large. The more our news stories convey this, the better we serve the public.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nI have received several cards with questions from the audience, covering everything from WikiLeaks, to the military, to Citizens United. So, WikiLeaks: good or bad?\n\nAlex Jones\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, The New York Times dealt with WikiLeaks in a responsible way. It took information that was made available, went through it carefully, and screened out anything it thought would put people’s lives in danger; but it did not pretend that the information was not now available. The news media are supposed to tell us what they find out, and I think that is what happened.\n\nJulian Assange and his organization made this information available, but he found that nothing was accomplished just by posting it. He had to give the information to The New York Times, The Guardian, and Der Spiegel in order for it to be noticed. And when he did so, he gave these papers the opportunity to treat the information responsibly, which I think they did.\n\nJudy Woodruff\n\nI think we need to remember that WikiLeaks is not journalism. It’s somebody with an agenda who wanted to get information out into the open. You could argue that there was a lot of valuable information, but there was also a lot of harmful information.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nThe New York Times, or The Boston Globe, or The Washington Post has to decide whether running a story or making information available would damage national security interests. I think most of us have been very comfortable with the fact that those decisions have so far been made by responsible, mature people who weigh the right to know against the needs of the nation. Are news organizations in danger of losing that role of gatekeeper, now that they no longer control the release of information?\n\nAlex Jones\n\nWhat’s more of a danger is that, for instance, The New York Times has reported things that the Obama administration has not been happy about, and the administration has gone after the reporters to give up their sources. If you start putting people in jail for talking to reporters, you are going to have a real problem with reporters being able to do their job at the highest level, which is to tell the public things that people in power do not want them to know, for a variety of reasons. I think that problem could be much more dangerous than Julian Assange.\n\nKarl Eikenberry\n\nHaving been on the receiving end of the pain that was felt from the WikiLeaks release, I have to tell you, I sat around with the embassy team and went through all the cables that had potentially been leaked. In the end, we asked ourselves, why are we writing all of this stuff? Who is even reading it? So I think that one of the lessons has to do with managing information.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nWhen we recruit for the volunteer force, we appeal to people by describing military service as a career-building move and an opportunity to make some money. Is this a positive development?\n\nKarl Eikenberry\n\nMotivations for coming into the service are mixed. Certainly, the financial aspect is an important one, but the pricetag for our taxpayers is steadily increasing. Current health care costs in the military are about $50 billion a year, and they are going up. Judy mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder; that and other health issues from Afghanistan and Iraq are driving costs higher and higher. Retirement costs, too, are going up. The role that material benefit plays in building this magnificent force has to be looked at. I think it is an unsustainable model.If you look at the demographics of our military, it is not a complete cross-section of American society. Both the Hispanic and Asian populations in the United States are under-represented in our military. Perhaps most surprising is that we tend to be overrepresented in certain parts of the country. Alabama has ten recruiting stations for the armed forces; the Greater Los Angeles area has three. That’s okay, except that the Greater Los Angeles area is about three times the population of Alabama. Geographically, we are not doing a good job of making our military represent American society.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nDiane, how does Citizens United affect foreign corporations?\n\nDiane Wood\n\nFor a long time, the United States (and most of the rest of the world) has followed the rule that a corporation is a citizen of the state, or if applicable, the country that incorporated it. In the United States, we have lots of Delaware corporate “citizens” in this sense; we also have a certain number of corporations that are citizens of other U.S. states. Typically we have not looked through the corporate structure to see where the shareholders come from. So a company incorporated in Delaware may be a wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese corporation, or it may have foreign citizens as shareholders. Despite the foreign ownership, the Delaware incorporation means that it is still a U.S. “citizen.” In fact, the United States has a network of treaties that make either of these scenarios perfectly lawful. But those treaties run into conflict with our election laws, which do not permit foreign influence in our elections. One of the many things the Supreme Court has to figure out is how to reconcile these two models.\n\nIn addition, it is worth recalling that Justice Kennedy approaches Citizens United as though a corporation is nothing more or less than a group of people. But if we look at the idea of a group more carefully, we see that there are at least three distinct scenarios. First, if those of us sitting here decided that we wanted to get together and send money to a certain political candidate, we could all chip in, say, $100 each and send that contribution as a group. Secondly, as Justice Kennedy points out, unions are a type of group. So unions can participate in the political process. Finally, a corporation can be thought of as a group. Here’s the rub: the issue of agency is different in each situation. In the first scenario, we have collectively decided on a course of action, and every person had a direct say in the decision. In the case of unions, although the group is entitled to participate in the political process, the Supreme Court has insisted on a right to opt out of the union’s political activities. If you belong to a union and it supports the Democratic candidate but you like the Republican candidate, you are entitled to a refund of your dues to the extent that the union participates in political activities. There is a whole line of Supreme Court cases about this. Corporations are even more complicated, but without going into all the details, suffice it to say that the Court was not looking at the differences in the agency model that might be appropriate for different kinds of groups. Going forward, there could be some room for development along those lines.\n\nNorman Ornstein\n\nI want to add one final twist on this topic. Not long after he was chosen as Governor Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan went to Las Vegas for a long and intimate private meeting with businessman and GOP donor Sheldon Adelson. The SpeechNow case that I mentioned earlier has blown a hole in the notion that these super PACs are independent of candidates, and now they can appear at fundraisers, among other things. Sheldon Adelson’s money comes much less from the casino business in Las Vegas, which has tanked in recent years, but almost entirely from Macao and Singapore. If Sheldon Adelson calls someone to whom he has contributed “independently” tens of millions of dollars and asks for an appointment, you can be sure that he will get that appointment. And you can also be sure that the subject of policy toward China will come up. So there isn’t much of a distinction here."
