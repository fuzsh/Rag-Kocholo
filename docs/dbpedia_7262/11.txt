The Asahi Prize was established in 1929 to honor individuals and groups that have made outstanding accomplishments in the fields of academics and arts, and have greatly contributed to the development and progress of Japanese culture and society at large.

The Asahi Shimbun Company is pleased to announce the recipients of the Asahi Prize for fiscal 2023 as listed below.

The Prize is regarded as one of the most prestigious prizes awarded by a nongovernmental entity. Many recipients of the Asahi Prize have later been honored with a Nobel Prize or the Order of Culture decoration. A total of 491 individuals and 28 groups have received the Prize since its inception (as of fiscal 2023).

Moreover, Asahi Special Prize honors individuals and groups that have continued to offer international or social dedication over the years, demonstrating exceptional results in fields not covered by the Asahi Prize.
