On 6 December 2018, Professor Masaru Shibata of the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics (YITP), and Professor Koichiro Tanaka of the Graduate School of Science attended a ceremony to accept this year's Nishina Memorial Prize from the Nishina Memorial Foundation.

The prize was established in 1955 in honor of Dr Yoshio Nishina, widely known as the pioneer of Japanese nuclear physics. It has since annually recognized one or more Japanese researchers who have made outstanding achievements in the field of basic and applied atomic and sub-atomic physics.

Professor Shibata, who directs the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, won the award for his "study of binary neutron star mergers by numerical relativity simulations", while Professor Tanaka, an adjunct principal investigator at the KyotoU Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS), was cited for his "development of extreme-nonlinear terahertz optics in solids".
