Yasuyuki Akiba, a physicist and researcher at Brookhaven National Lab and in Japan, has won Japan’s oldest physics award.

Akiba recently was awarded the Nishina Memorial Prize, which is named for Yoshio Nishina, a seminal physics researcher from Japan, BNL officials said in a statement.

The prize has been awarded by the Nishina Memorial Foundation since 1955 for “achievements in the field of atomic and subatomic physics,” BNL’s statement said.

Akiba is the experimental group leader of the RIKEN BNL Research Center, a facility at the Upton lab that is funded by RIKEN, a Japanese science institute. He is also vice chief scientist of the RIKEN Nishina Center in Japan.

Akiba was cited for his breadth of work, including experiments using BNL’s accelerator, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, BNL officials said.

“I am very pleased that our perseverance has resulted in some very significant results,” Akiba said in a statement.

Akiba earned his undergraduate degrees and doctorate at the University of Tokyo. He has been the experimental group leader of the RIKEN BNL Research Center at Brookhaven since 2008, BNL officials said.
