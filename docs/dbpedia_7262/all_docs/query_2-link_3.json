        "text": "The 1974 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nPrize given \"for his proposal of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles\"\n\n1. \"I want to speak to the Japanese public directly.\" 7\n\n2. \"Japan's recovery from World War II will not end until Okinawa is returned to Japan.\" 8\n\n3. \"Japan shall neither possess nor manufacture nuclear weapons, nor shall it permit their introduction into Japanese territory.\" 9\n\nThe only Japanese person who has received the Nobel Peace Prize is Mr. Eisaku Sato, a politician who is said to have narrowly managed to pass the entrance examinations of the University of Tokyo with the help of notebooks borrowed from his older brother. The second quote (2) comes from a speech he made when he visited Okinawa for the first time as prime minister in 1965. It was not until 1972 that Okinawa was finally returned to Japan. The third quote (3) represents his ideas of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, which were the reason he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The first quote (1) is a comment he made at a press conference when all the members of his cabinet resigned in 1972. This press conference was unusual because he drove newspaper reporters out of the conference, saying that they made up stories differing from his true intentions. He instead gave preference to television reporters because he said that television would convey his comments exactly as he said them.\n\nThe 1994 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nPrize given \"for creating with poetic force an imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today\"\n\n1. \"After all, literature can fundamentally serve as encouragement to humanity.\" 10\n\n2. \"If high-level communication is possible between different people, I think that their common language would be 'words of literature.'\" 11\n\n3. \"This ambiguity which is so powerful and penetrating that it splits both the state and its people is evident in various ways.\" 12\n\nThe second Japanese person to win the Nobel Prize in Literature was Kenzaburo Oe. He made his debut as a writer during his days at the University of Tokyo when he contributed his short story titled The Strange Work (Kimyo na Shigoto) to The University of Tokyo Newspaper. From the first quote (1), an excerpt from one of his nonfiction works intended for a young audience, we can see the stance that underlies Oe's literature. The second quote (2) is a comment he made during an interview for a special feature of Tansei 17 (English edition Volume 6) published in 2006. He also said in the interview that \"What I learned at Todai was how to read a foreign language.\" The third quote (3) is from his Nobel Lecture titled \"Japan, The Ambiguous, and Myself,\" which was inspired by Mr. Kawabata's Nobel Lecture, \"Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself.\"\n\nThe 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nPrize given \"for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos\"\n\n1. \"In this country, you have to listen to what your elders say.\" 13\n\n2. \"I check my 'research eggs' whenever the occasion presents itself to see if they are going to hatch. Isn't that exciting?\" 14\n\n3. \"How to strengthen intuition? The key is to think over matters thoroughly. If you explore every possible factor and ruminate over them to the point of squeezing your brain, you will have a better chance of getting things right.\" 15\n\nAs the father of neutrino astrophysics and as a teacher who is strict at times, Professor Koshiba has had great influence on his successors, including Professor Takaaki Kajita. The words that are key to deciphering Professor Koshiba's achievements are \"intuition,\" as in the third quote (3), and \"research egg,\" as in the second quote (2). Being the leader of a massive research project, he had to decide on what, when, where, with whom and with what kind of devices his team should experiment. He proudly asserts that he is able to constantly make optimal judgements because he \"squeezes his brain\" by ruminating over these matters, thus strengthening his intuition. Also, he has been able to carry out unique research because he has always incubated a variety of idea \"eggs,\" believing that those eggs will hatch someday, even if they are not ready now. Professor Koshiba famously persuaded (see the first quote, 1) the CEO of Hamamatsu Photonics to manufacture 50 cm-diameter photomultiplier tubes, which had been considered to be difficult to make, by stressing his seniority over the CEO (although Professor Koshiba is only one day older). This anecdote shows us that to achieve something great, you need to have a strong will that may appear to be sometimes irrational.\n\nThe 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nPrize given \"for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics\"\n\n1. \"My opinion is that all natural phenomena can be explained with mathematical formulas of some kind.\" 16\n\n2. \"When solving mathematical equations, I don't use notebooks because I cannot concentrate. Instead, I work equations out in my head. Consequently, I dream about mathematical formulas solving themselves when I sleep.\" 17\n\n3. \"The basic laws of nature are simple, but the world is not boring. Is this not an ideal combination?\" 18\n\nProfessor Nambu has won great respect from researchers around the world as a \"prophet of physics.\" He was a trailblazer in not only spontaneous symmetry breaking, but almost all the tenets of today's particle physics theory, including string theory and quantum chromodynamics. Recognized by everyone as an unparalleled genius, his greatness can be understood through the following anecdote. Professor Toshihide Maskawa, who shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics with Professor Nambu, said in tears at the press conference that winning the Nobel Prize together with Professor Nambu brought him incomparable joy. The third quote (3) is the closing comment Professor Nambu made during a speech held at the University of Chicago to commemorate his winning of the Nobel Prize. This comment precisely and passionately expresses his appreciation for the complexities of nature based on modern physics. The first (1) and second (2) quotes are excerpts from an interview Professor Nambu gave to a newspaper in Fukui Prefecture, where he lived until graduating from high school. Through these quotes, we can see his profound confidence in physics and his innate intellectual prowess which can never be imitated.\n\nThe 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nPrize given \"for palladium-catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis\"\n\n1. \"I am an advocate of the 'examination hell' experienced by Japanese students, which is infamous worldwide.\" 19\n\n2. \"I think that countries now flourishing and enjoying prosperity are those that have invested a huge amount of money in science. Therefore, in other words, research is essentially profitable when considering it from a wider viewpoint.\" 20\n\n3. \"Be both independent and cooperative.\" 21\n\nCross-coupling refers to reactions where two molecules with different structures are coupled. The Negishi coupling, which synthesizes organozinc and organohalogen compounds using palladium as a catalyst, made greatly pioneering contributions to the development and application of organometallic compounds. The first quote (1) refers to Professor Negishi's belief that it was the Japanese educational system that taught him that the more advanced your research, the more important basics become. In the second quote (2), he looks back on the history of humanity and argues that it is meaningful to invest in scholarship, highlighting the foolishness of reducing research costs shortsightedly. The third quote (3) refers to one of the six creeds written in his book. He states that the biggest discovery he made in his lifetime was that he noticed that being independent and being cooperative can be compatible. The integration of these apparent different values can also be called a \"Negishi coupling.\""
