A Japanese Artist from Sweden\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nÃrum, Tania\n\n2015-01-01\n\nYoshio Nakajima is an interesting example of the globalisation of art. His education and early work as an artist took place in his native Japan, but continued in Europe where he has spent more than 30 years, mainly in provincial Sweden....\n\nYoshio Nishina father of modern physics in Japan\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKim, Dong-Won\n\n2007-01-01\n\nYoshio Nishina not only made a great contribution to the emergence of a research network that produced two Nobel prize winners, but he also raised the overall level of physics in Japan. Focusing on his roles as researcher, teacher, and statesman of science, Yoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan analyzes Nishina''s position in and his contributions to the Japanese physics community.After a concise biographical introduction, the book examines Nishina''s family, his early studies, the creation of RIKEN, and the greater Japanese physics community in the early twentieth century. It then focuses on Nishina''s work at the Cavendish Laboratory and at the University of GÃ¶ttingen as well as his more fruitful research at Niels Bohr''s Institute of Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen. The book also describes the establishment of the Nishina Laboratory at RIKEN, the collaboration between its experimentalists and theoreticians, and the cosmic ray research of its scientists. The last two chapters discuss Nishina'...\n\nOn the colour types in Lycodes nakamurae (Tanaka, 1914) and species composition of the subgenus Furcimanus (Perciformes: Zoarcidae: Lycodes) in the sea of Japan.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSaveliev, Pavel A; Balanov, Andrey A; Kukhlevskii, Andrey D\n\n2014-05-30\n\nTwo colour types were revealed in a zoarcid fish of the subgenus Furcimanus, genus Lycodes, in the Sea of Japan. A comparison of morphometric, meristic and genetic characters in dark coloured and light coloured individuals suggests that the two colour morphs represent a single species, determined to be Lycodes nakamurae (Tanaka, 1914). Variability in colouration within L. nakamurae and a lack of morphological or molecular characters distinguishing L. nakamurae from L. nishimurai Shinohara & Shirai, 2005 suggest that the latter should be considered a synonym of L. nakamurae (Tanaka, 1914). A record of L. pectoralis in the waters of the Republic of Korea is regarded as a misidentification. Thus, we conclude that only one species of the Lycodes subgenus Furcimanus, L. nakamurae, with dark and light colour morphs as well as specimens of intermediate colouration, inhabits the Sea of Japan.\n\nObituary: Barry James LaBonte, 1950-2005\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRust, David Maurice\n\n2006-12-01\n\nDr. Barry J. LaBonte, age 55, a senior solar physicist in the Space Department of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, died on 24 October 2005 in Philadelphia of complications following surgery. He was an internationally recognized expert on solar magnetic fields, the solar cycle, and on the sophisticated instruments needed for studying them. Barry LaBonte was born in Providence, Rhode Island on 28 April 1950. His parents were Arlene and William LaBonte, and Barry was the oldest of their three children. He excelled early in mathematics and was admitted to the California Institute of Technology, where he earned a BS in economics and a PhD in astronomy. From 1978 to 1981, he did his postdoctoral work at the Mount Wilson Observatory where he and Dr. Robert Howard discovered and analyzed the solar torsional oscillations, which are global flow patterns somewhat analogous to the jet streams of terrestrial weather. They described their findings in a series of thirteen papers in three years. LaBonte and Howard also showed that magnetic fields on the sun are much more dynamic than were previously thought. Contrary to the impression that a few, long-lived sunspots give, the total replacement of the surface magnetic flux occurs within only ten days. In 1981 Barry became an astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawaii, where he taught undergraduate and advanced graduate courses and became head of the Mees Solar Observatory. In addition to further work on solar magnetism, he initiated a research program in solar acoustic oscillations, which led to the discovery that sunspots absorb acoustic waves of the global oscillations of the sun. Doug Braun, Tom Duvall, and Barry LaBonte calculated that sunspot magnetic fields, contrary to earlier expectations, absorb enough p-mode energy to alter the spectrum of the global oscillations. It was later shown that sensitive analysis of the oscillations on the face of the sun could detect the\n\nAcquired Ulcero-Mutilating Bilateral Acro-Osteopathy (Bureau-BarriÃ¨re Syndrome\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGeorgi Tchernev\n\n2017-07-01\n\nFull Text Available We present a 35-year-old male patient with Bureau-BarriÃ¨re syndrome. Bureau-BarriÃ¨re syndrome is an ulcero-mutilating acropathy almost invariably associated with excessive alcohol intake. It presents with a triad of trophic skin changes with recurrent ulcerations, bone lesions and nerve damage. The clinical presentation includes chronic painless plantar ulcerations with periulcerous hyperkeratosis, hyperhidrosis, livedoid skin colour, nail dystrophy, widening and infiltration of the toes and common interdigital mycoses. Other non-specific skin changes related to the alcohol consumption are commonly observed as well. The condition affects mainly middle-aged men suffering from alcoholism. Often a bilateral location at the lower limb of male alcoholics has been described, as in our patient. Successful treatment of the Bureau-BarriÃ¨re syndrome requires an interdisciplinary approach. Cessation of alcohol intake and smoking is of paramount importance.\n\nOmstrede kwessies en teksinterne korrektiewe in Skilpoppe van Barrie Hough\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nM.J. Fritz; E.S.

The simulation was conducted using Nakamura model which is a modified Avrami model. The model is a 1 cm radius of circle with the cooling plate which was placed in the upper part of the circle. The cooling plate temperature was varied in order to obtain particular cooling rates. The measurement point is located near upper boundary in order to minimize the heat transfer effect. The general trend of time evolution of crystallization was well captured although some discrepancies occured. These discrepancies may be attributed to the heat transfer effect and secondary crystallization.\n\nBuckland, Barry oral history interview\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nInterviewee: Buckland, Barry; Interviewer: Gootee, Jackie; Principal Investigator: Hall, Peter V\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Columbia Theatre on 530 Columbia St. in New Westminster was built in 1927 as a 900-seat movie theatre. Until the mid-1980s, the building housed a cinema, and was the first cinema in Canada with air conditioning. After being closed for many years, the city of New Westminster sold the building to Barry Buckland in 2011, and he took on the task of restoring the theatre. Buckland is an Ottawa native, but came to New Westminster in 1985. Since then he has has operated a number of businesses.

The overarching topic of Experiments is electronics, focusing on the comparison between digital and analogue communication systems. Experiments unfolds the rationales, potentials, and effects of the two types of communication systems using the perceptions of the major character, a thirteen-year old girl, Rein, as well as other supporting characters.\n\nToda molecule and Tomimatsu-Sato solution-towards the complete proof of Nakamura's conjecture\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFukuyama, Takeshi; Koizumi, Kozo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe discuss the Nakamura's conjecture stating that the Tomimatsu-Sato black hole solution with an integer deformation parameter n is composed of the special solutions of the Toda molecule equation at the nth lattice site. From the previous work, in which the conjecture was partly analytically proved, we go further towards the final full proof by rearranging the rotation parameter. The proof is explicitly performed for the highest and lowest orders. Though the proof for all orders still remains unsolved, the prospect to the full proof becomes transparent and workable by our method.

After closely examining the relation of fer barri with tourism in Mallorca, I analyse the tensions between the urban planning schemes unleashed by the public authorities upon this heritage-loaded territory and the practices of its inhabitants. I argue that the concept of neighbourhood scaling best accounts for the social relations that this sub-urban context embodies, given the hierarchy of forces impinging on it (urban, regional, national, global. Urban policy plans and organised residents scale the neighbourhood in conflictual terms. Some follow a tourism-dependent logic and try to promote the neighbourhood along the lines of heritage, its centrality or by setting up large events. In addition to State-led policies, tourism businesses and real estate enterprises, urban movements often depicted as oppositional groups have their own understanding of fer barri. This is an understanding of contradictory kind since in their attempts to contest capital accumulation by placing a value on the neighbourhood, urban movements can also unintentionally pave the way for both renewal and gentrification. A thorough analysis of the local term fer barri therefore reveals contrasting projects of neighbourhood scaling.Este artigo explora os significados da expressÃ£o local fer barri (fazer o bairro numa zona em processo de nobilitaÃ§Ã£o no centro histÃ³rico da Cidade de Maiorca (Espanha.

The Tell (Arab word for \"hill\") is 32 m high with a whole covered area of 37 hectares. The Tell, with its huge dimensions and with a great amount of pottery on the surface, is a precious area to study the regional history from IV mill. BC to Islamic and Medieval period. The geophysical study consisted in magnetic and electromagnetic measurements in the lower town area. The aim of this survey was to provide evidence of the presence of buried archaeological structures around an already excavated area. The wall structures in the Tell Barri are made by backed or crude clay bricks. The instrument used for the magnetic survey was an Overhauser-effect proton magnetometer (Gem GSM-19GF), in gradiometric configuration. The electromagnetic instrument used, Geonics Ltd. EM31, implements a Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Method (FDEM). It was used in vertical coils configuration, and this choice should grant a maximum theoretical investigation depth of about 6 m. Before starting the measurements on a larger scale, we conducted a magnetic and EM test profile on some already excavated, outcropping, baked bricks walls. Results were encouraging, because clear and strong magnetic and EM anomalies were recorded over the outcropping walls. However, in the survey area these structures are covered by 3 to 4 meters of clay material and the increased sensors-structures distance will reduce the anomalies amplitude. Moreover, the cover material is disseminated with bricks, basalt blocks and ceramics, all of which have relevant magnetic properties. After magnetic surveying some 50 m side square areas, we verified that unfortunately their effect resulted to be dominant with respect to the deeper wall structures, degrading too much the signal-to-noise ratio. The processing and analysis of magnetic data is however currently underway and will determine decisions about further use of this method\n\nProfessor Barry Fraser's contributions to science education research\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAldridge, Jill M.\n\n2011-09-01\n\nIn this article, I endeavour to convey the depth of Barry Fraser's contributions to science education research, including his tireless endeavours to promote and advance research, especially the field of learning environments, the realisation of his vision to create one of the largest doctoral programs in science and mathematics education in the world, his leadership capacity in terms of guiding and leading an internationally renowned centre and large-scale cross-national and cross-cultural studies, his dedication towards human capacity building in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, his capacity as a mentor and editor that have seen the publication of numerous journal articles and books and the ongoing success of science education research journals.\n\nResearching Race and Social Justice in Education: Essays in Honour of Barry Troyna.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSikes, Pat, Ed.; Rizvi, Fazal, Ed.\n\nThe essays in this book comprise a \"festschrift\", a group of essays, to commemorate Barry Troyna, who made an important contribution to thinking about race, racism, and research on social-justice issues in the school context.

We were able to observe the preservation of erectile function despite the long period of ischemia. A review of the literature shows that there are few reports of erectile function recovery after a priapism of similar duration. Materials and methods: A 42-year-old patient presented with a 76-hour priapism, probably caused by consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs. A Barry Shunt procedure was performed. The erectile function of the patient was assessed by means of International Index of Erectile Function score over a follow-up period of 30 months. Moreover, we reviewed different surgical options for treatment of priapism in the literature. Results: Partial return of erection without sexual arousal occurred on two occasions during the 10-day hospitalization, but was treated by manipulation of the penis, ie, by milking the tumescence into the shunt. After 3 months, the shunt was still palpable as a subcutaneous swelling. Six months postoperatively, the residual swelling had disappeared. The International Index of Erectile Function score was of 21 without phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors after a follow-up of 2.5 years. Conclusion: Barry shunt is an effective alternative surgical option for the treatment of low-flow priapism. In the case of our patient, it was also effective after a 76-hour-lasting priapism. Keywords: low flow priapism, erectile function, cavernovenous shunt, surgical treatment of stuttering priapism\n\nProfessor Barrie Vernon-Roberts, AO, MD, BSc, PhD, FRCPath, FRCPA, FAOrthA (Hon), FRS.SA.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRainsford, K D; Haynes, D R\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThis issue of Inflammopharmacology contains papers that have been submitted to commemorate the life and work of Professor Barrie Vernon-Roberts, an outstanding clinical scientist in the field of bone pathology and its pharmacological regulation.

The formulation with use of natural mathematical principles leads to a quite simple expression for the propagator based on classical trajectories and simple formulas are derived for overall adiabatic and nonadiabatic processes. The theory is applied to electronically nonadiabatic photodissociation processes: a one-dimensional problem of H 2 + in a cw (continuous wave) laser field and a two-dimensional model problem of H 2 O in a cw laser field. The theory is found to work well for the propagation duration of several molecular vibrational periods and wide energy range. Although the formulation is made for the case of laser induced nonadiabatic processes, it is straightforwardly applicable to ordinary electronically nonadiabatic chemical dynamics\n\nBrian Barry: innovative contributions to transdermal and topical drug delivery.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWilliams, A C\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBrian Barry published over 300 research articles across topics ranging from colloid science, vasoconstriction and the importance of thermodynamics in dermal drug delivery to exploring the structure and organisation of the stratum corneum barrier lipids and numerous strategies for improving topical and transdermal drug delivery, including penetration enhancers, supersaturation, coacervation, eutectic formation and the use of varied liposomes. As research in the area blossomed in the early 1980s, Brian wrote the book that became essential reading for both new and established dermal delivery scientists, explaining the background mathematics and principles through to formulation design. Brian also worked with numerous scientists, as collaborators and students, who have themselves taken his rigorous approach to scientific investigation into their own research groups. This paper can only describe a small fraction of the many significant contributions that Brian made to the field during his 40-year academic career.\n\nWACANA SYARIAT KONTEMPORER DI BARAT: Studi Pemikiran Wael B. Hallaq dan M. Barry Hooker\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMohamad Abdun Nasir\n\n2017-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Contemporary popular discourses about Islam, shariâa and Islamic law in the West is often filled with the issues of terrorism, anti-democracy, human rights violation and womenâs minor status in Islam, which all lead into negative perception. Unlike such popular views, Western scholars perceive shariâa from various perspectives. They are quite critical to shariâa in a positive sense. This article discusses Western scholarly discourses on shariâa by comparing the thoughts and works of two most prominent figures, Wael B. Hallaq and M. Barry Hooker, who always concern with shariâa, Islamic law and related social issues, such modernity, colonialism and legal system. Based on the model of the study of public figure and grounded its main data on Hallaqâs and Hookerâs main work, this study shows that these two scholars promote idealistic and contextual perception on shariâa. From the ideal point of view, shariâa is seen a product of scholarly independent work by Muslim jurists, whose authority now is unfortunately taken over by the state. The contextual view regards shariâa as flexible Islamic religious or legal norms that are adaptable to the changing social and political environments so they are easily transferrable into the educational, legal and political system in a country like Indonesia, entailing what is called ânational mazhabâ.\n\nPraemium Imperiale laureaadid / Priit Kuusk\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKuusk, Priit, 1938-\n\n2006-01-01\n\nJapan Art Association'i preemia (110000 eurot) said pianist Martha Argerich, balletilavastaja ja -trupijuht Merce Cunningham, maalikunstnik Robert Ryman, skulptuuride eest Issey Miyake ja arhitekt Yoshio Taniguchi\n\nTokyos maailma \"Kunsti-Nobelid\"\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2005-01-01\n\nPraemium Imperiale nimelisest loomeauhinnast, selle sajad 2005. aastal olid Issey Miyake, Robert Ryman, Yoshio Taniguchi, Martha Argerich, Merce Cunningham.

RÃ©sultats Huit pourcent des MG disposaient de registre informatisÃ© pour le suivi des diabÃ©tiques. Les principales barriÃ¨res Ã une prise en charge correcte des patients Ã©taient le statut socio-Ã©conomique faible des patients (94%), leur niveau scolaire bas (86%), le manque de moyens de traitement et de suivi (80%), le nombre insuffisant de diabÃ©tologues (80%), le manque de coordination avec les structures de 2Ã¨me ligne (74%) et l'insuffisance des sÃ©minaires de formation continue (58%). Conclusion Les mÃ©decins gÃ©nÃ©ralistes sont confrontÃ©s Ã de nombreux obstacles concernant la prise en charge des patients diabÃ©tiques. LâÃ©quipement des centres de santÃ© en moyens diagnostiques et thÃ©rapeutiques suffisants, l'amÃ©lioration de l'accessibilitÃ© des diabÃ©tiques aux soins et la formation continue des mÃ©decins pourraient Ãªtre des solutions pour amÃ©liorer cette prise en charge surtout devant la pÃ©nurie de spÃ©cialistes dans notre pays.

For one thing, it helps consumers find out about new products, and new products have been rising in economic importance. It also plays a role in subsidizing broadcast entertainment and news programs. Ultimately, Nakamura shows that although advertising contributes to consumer welfare, its contribution is missing from our measures of output.\n\nBritid tahavad euroliitu pÃµhjalikult muuta / Erkki Bahovski\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nBahovski, Erkki, 1970-\n\n2005-01-01\n\nSuurbritannia lÃ¼kkas Euroopa Liidu eelarvekava tagasi.

In this study, we aimed to map earliness per se quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting days to flowering and maturity in a population developed by crossing two spring wheat cultivars, Cutler and AC Barrie. The population of 177 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was genotyped for a total of 488 SSR and DArT polymorphic markers on all 21 chromosomes. Three QTLs of earliness per se affecting days to flowering and maturity were mapped on chromosomes 1B (QEps.dms-1B1 and QEps.dms-1B2) and 5B (QEps.dms-5B1), in individual environments and when all the environments were combined. A QTL affecting flowering time (QFlt.dms-4A1) was identified on chromosome 4A. Two grain yield QTLs were mapped on chromosome 5B, while one QTL was mapped on chromosome 1D. The population segregated for the photoperiod insensitive gene, Ppd-D1a, and it induced earlier flowering by 0.69Â days and maturity by 1.28Â days. The photoperiod insensitive allele Ppd-D1a interacted in an additive fashion with QTLs for flowering and maturity times. The earliness per se QTL QFlt.dms-5B.1 inducing earlier flowering could help to elongate grain filling duration for higher grain yield. Hence, chromosome 5B possesses promising genomic regions that may be introgressed for higher grain yield with earlier maturity through marker-assisted selection in bread wheat.\n\nThe Battle for Leyte Gulf.

The current surgical management of the biliary variants is unsatisfactory. We evaluated the role of a new surgical approach in a complicated hilar bile duct variant (Nakamura type IV and Nakamura type II) under emergent right lobe LDALT for high model for end-stage liver disease score patients. The common hepatic duct (CHD) and the left hepatic duct (LHD) of the donor were transected in a right-graft including short common trunks with right posterior and anterior bile ducts, whereas the LHD of the donor was anastomosed to the CHD and the common trunks of a right-graft bile duct and the recipient CHD was end-to-end anastomosed. Ten of 13 grafts (Nakamura types II, III, and IV) had two or more biliary orifices after right graft lobectomy; seven patients had biliary complications (53.8%). Later, the surgical innovation was carried out in five donors with variant bile duct (four Nakamura type IV and one type II), and, consequently, no biliary or other complications were observed in donors and recipients during 47-53 months of follow-up; significant differences ( P Â ducts in a complicated donor bile duct variant may facilitate biliary reconstruction and reduce long-term biliary complications.\n\nAstmed ja hÃ¼pped / Meelis Friedenthal\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nFriedenthal, Meelis, 1973-\n\n2010-01-01\n\nDan Gordoni nÃ¤idend \"Vihmamees\" (Rain Man) samanimelise filmi pÃµhjal, filmistsenaariumi autorid Ronald Bass ja Barry Morrow, stsenaariumi aluseks Barry Morrow jutustus, lavastaja Georg Malvius.

In vivo electroporation has been adapted as one such technique (Muramatsu et al., 1997). It is a very useful tool to achieve a gain- and loss-of-function (by using RNAi or morpholinos) of a gene of interest (Funahashi et al., 1999; Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2001; Kos et al., 2001; Katahira and Nakamura, 2003; Sugiyama and Nakamura, 2003). The technique has allowed the altering of gene expression temporally and spatially. Pulse-labeling technique is an approach to manipulate a specific cell population temporally, depending on its birthday, as this chapter describes. This technique is more advantageous over the BrdU application, as it can reveal cell lineage; it also has the ability to manipulate a gain- and loss-of-function into specific precursor cells (Tabata and Nakajima, 2001; Sugiyama and Nakamura, 2003; Huber et al., 2008).\n\nNew results for virial coefficients of hard spheres in D dimensions\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nNathan Clisby1 Barry M McCoy2.

The semiclassical theory of nuclear spins motion is developed that takes into consideration three main features of magnetically ordered media: Suhl-Nakamura interaction, quadrupole interaction and microscopic inhomogeneity of nuclear frequencies. The detailed classification of nuclear spin echo signals is given for standard conditions of experiments, when the Suhl-Nakamura interaction is small in comparison with the NMR line width. The extremal states of the electron - nuclear magnetic system are described in detail: the coexistence of NMR and FMR, nuclear ferromagnetism and NMR at fast remagnetization of a ferromagnet. 157 refs., 20 figs\n\nPÃ¤rt, Arvo: \"Litany\" / Barry Witherden\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nWitherden, Barry\n\n1996-01-01\n\nUuest heliplaadist \"PÃ¤rt, Arvo: \"Litany\".

Postdocs supported on the project included Brad Seibel, now an associate professor at the University of Rhode Island, Jeff Drazen, now an associate professor at the University of Hawaii, and Eric Pane, who continues as a research associate at MBARI. Thus, the project contributed significantly to the professional development of young scientists. In addition, we made significant progress in several research areas. We continued several deep-sea CO2 release experiments using support from DoE and MBARI, along with several collaborators. These CO2 release studies had the goal of broadening our understanding of the effects of high ocean CO2 levels on deep sea animals in the vicinity of potential release sites for direct deep-ocean carbon dioxide sequestration. Using MBARI ships and ROVs, we performed these experiments at depths of 3000 to 3600 m, where liquid CO2 is heavier than seawater. CO2 was released into small pools (sections of PVC pipe) on the seabed, where it dissolved and drifted downstream, bathing any caged animals and sediments in a CO2-rich, low-pH plume. We assessed the survival of organisms nearby. Several publications arose from these studies (Barry et al. 2004, 2005; Carman et al. 2004; Thistle et al. 2005, 2006, 2007; Fleeger et al. 2006, 2010; Barry and Drazen 2007; Bernhard et al. 2009; Sedlacek et al. 2009; Ricketts et al. in press; Barry et al, in revision) concerning the sensitivity of animals to low pH waters. Using funds from DoE and MBARI, we designed and fabricated a hyperbaric trap-respirometer to study metabolic rates of deep-sea fishes under high CO2 conditions (Drazen et al, 2005), as well as a gas-control aquarium system to support laboratory studies of the\n\nCyber Practices: What Can the U.S. Air Force Learn from the Commercial Sector?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2015-01-01\n\ndam/lockheed/data/isgs/documents/LMCSA%20Ov erview%20Fact%20Sheet_Final%20%282%29. pdf Lunt, Barry, Joseph J.

When the Portuguese opened the maritime routes to the Far East in the 16th century. Western medicine traveled to Japan on the trading vessels that carried physicians and barber-surgeons to care for the body and Christian missionaries to care for the soul. Skilled interpreters such as KÅgyÅ« Yoshio translated and studied Dutch editions of early medical books, like Lorenz Heister's \"Chirurgie\" (NÃ¼rnberg, 1719), that illustrate the concept of transfusion. The oldest description of transfusion originating in Japan is a handwritten manuscript entitled \"Bansui Sensi Chojutsu Shomoku\" by Masamichi Nishijima, a student of Bansui Otsuki. It is a list of Otsuki's translated works. He described book names and chapter names in the manuscript, and when he finished translation of a chapter, he marked a circle on the chapter name. The transfusion chapter had a circle. That dates the earliest writing on transfusion in Japanese to 1804, shortly after the death of KÅgyÅ«. Unfortunately, the manuscript translation no longer exists. In 1814, ShunzÅ Yoshio, grandson of KÅgyÅ«, and in 1820, Tokki Koshimura, translated the figure legends of \"Chirurgie.\" Soon afterwards, after the first report of transfusion from human-to-human by James Blundell in London in 1818, Western medical books published on the subject began to arrive. The works of Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, Georg Friedrich Most and Carl Canstatt all mentioning transfusion, albeit without details, were translated by KÅan Ogata and ShinryÅ Tsuboi. During the Edo period, Japan was a closed country; only open to the Dutch through a tiny island in Nagasaki. But Japanese doctors in the Edo period learned about blood transfusion through Dutch-translated versions of Western medical Books. Transfusion began being practiced in Japan in 1919, almost exactly 100 years after the concept was introduced\n\nMechanisms of Forming Intergranular Microcracks and Microscopic Surface Discontinuities in Welds\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1992-06-01\n\nNakamura, for their advice and assistance.

RCT. Participants were recruited through a state employee health plan. All were women aged 40-75 years and had recent mammograms prior to enrollment (n=3547). Data were collected from 2004 to 2009. Trial tested efficacy of a two-step adaptively-designed intervention to increase mammography adherence over 4 years. The first intervention step consisted of three reminder types: enhanced usual care reminders (EUCR); enhanced letter reminders (ELR); both delivered by mail, and automated telephone reminders (ATR). After delivery of reminders, women who became off-schedule in any of the 4 years received a second step of supplemental interventions. Three supplemental intervention arms contained priming letters and telephone counseling: barriers only (BarriCall); barriers plus positive consequences of getting mammograms (BarriConCall+); and barriers plus negative consequences of not getting mammograms (BarriConCall-). Average cumulative number of days non-adherent to mammography over 4 years based on annual screening guidelines (analyses conducted in 2009). All reminders performed equally well in reducing number of days of non-adherence. Women randomized to receive supplemental interventions had significantly fewer days of non-adherence compared to women who received EUCR (p=0.0003). BarrConCall+ and BarrConCall- conditions did not significantly differ in days non-adherent compared to women in the barriers-only condition (BarriCon). The minimal intervention needed for sustained mammography use is a combination of a reminder followed by a priming letter and barrier-specific telephone counseling for women who become off-schedule. Additional costs associated with supplemental interventions should be considered by organizations deciding which interventions to use. NCT01148875.

We attempted to produce the first numeric chronology of these subaerial sequences in the Canterbury region by using thermoluminescence and infrared-stimulated luminescence dating methods. We examined five exposures: a 6 m thick section at Cust, north of Christchurch; two thicker (c. 14 m) sequences on Banks Peninsula (Barrys Bay and Onawe sites); farther south, a c. 12 m sequence in Timaru; and a c. 7 m sequence on the coast at the Normanby site near Timaru. Our results are largely based on single experiments per sample, and therefore provide imprecise ages for several of the older samples. The most satisfactory results are those from the youngest site (Cust), for which three samples were dated. Here, phases of maximum loess deposition are dated at 73 +/- 13 ka (basal loess-paleosol unit L3), 41 +/- 5 ka (basal L2), and 27 +/- 3 ka (basal L1). At Barrys Bay an age of 70 +/- 15 ka was obtained in the basal L1, and at Timaru two separate samples in the base of L1 also yielded ages of c. 70 ka, thus correlating the entire Cust loess sequence with the L1 loess unit at these two other study sites. Only at Barrys Bay were ages (c. 130-250 ka) in stratigraphic order obtained for older samples (units L2 and deeper). At the other sites, some samples in the sub-L1 units gave age reversals, and some (including the oldest sample at Barrys Bay) yielded poor precision (e.g., 20%). Units L2 at Timaru and Barrys Bay may correlate to all or part of MIS 6; however, the poor precision and some age reversals in other units at these sites and at Normanby and Onawe preclude any unambiguous correlations between sites or to the MIS time-scale. Nevertheless, in the absence of any prior numeric ages, these first results serve as a basis for more precise future dating of these units.

They can be used for delivery, sports, surveillance, professional photography, cinematography, military combat, natural disaster assistance, security, and the list grows every day. Programming opens an avenue to automate many processes of daily life and with the drone as aerial programmable eyes, security and surveillance can become more efficient and cost effective. At Barry University, parking is becoming an issue as the number of people visiting the school greatly outnumbers the convenient parking locations. This has caused a multitude of hazards in parking lots due to people illegally parking, as well as unregistered vehicles parking in reserved areas. In this paper, we explain how automated drone surveillance is utilized to detect unauthorized parking at Barry University. The automated process is incorporated into Java application and completed in three steps: collecting visual data, processing data automatically, and sending automated responses and queues to the operator of the system.\n\nBicycles, Airplanes and Peter Pans: Flying Scenes in Steven Spielberg's Films\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEmilio Audissino\n\n2014-10-01\n\nFull Text Available In Steven Spielberg's cinema the flight is a recurring theme. Flying scenes can be sorted into two classes: those involving a realistic flight â by aircraft â and those involving a magical flight â by supernatural powers. The realistic flight is influenced by the war stories of Spielberg's father â a radio man in U.S. Air-force during WWII â and it is featured in such films as Empire of the Sun (1987, Always (1989, and 1941 (1979. The magical flight is influenced by James M. Barries' character Peter Pan (Peter and Wendy, 1911, which is quoted directly in E.T. the Extraterrestrial (1982 and, above all, in Hook (1991, which is a sequel to Barrie's story. These two types of flying scenes are analysed as to their meanings, compared to the models that influenced them, and surveyed as to their evolution across Spielberg's films. A central case study is the episode The Mission from Amazing Stories (1985, in which the realistic and the magical flights overlap.\n\n76 FR 78695 - Barry M.

According to the Sense Model (Finkbeiner, Forster, Nicol & Nakamura, 2004) this asymmetry is due to the proportion of senses activated by the prime. Because L2 primes activate only a subset of the L1 translations senses, priming is not observed. In this study we test the pred...\n\nStemcell Information: SKIP000278 [SKIP Stemcell Database[Archive\n\nLifescience Database Archive (English)\n\nFull Text Available man bFGF ... Negative ...

Rev. A, 58, 2077 (1998)] for s-wave scattering in a spherically symmetric finite-range potential, is generalized to nonzero angular momenta. The orthogonality and completeness properties of SPSs are established and SPS expansions for the outgoing-wave Green's function, physical states, and scattering matrix are obtained. The present formulation completes the theory of SPSs in the one-channel case, making its application to three-dimensional problems possible. The results are illustrated by calculations for several model potentials\n\nOptical Spectroscopy of TCP J04432130+4721280 (V392 Per) Confirms a Nova Eruption\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWagner, R.

The problems encountered are the following: effects of the dipolar fields and the hyperfine structure anisotropy; signal intensity; frequency pulling due to the Suhl-Nakamura interaction between nuclear spins ; nuclear relaxation and ferrimagnetic resonance in single domain samples of impure YIG; nuclear relaxation in the Bloch walls of insulators. The results of our calculations are generally in good agreement with experiment. (author) [fr\n\nKas koostÃ¶Ã¶ on vajadus vÃµi kohustus?\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2008-01-01\n\n15. nov."
