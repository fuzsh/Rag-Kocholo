        "text": "Australia's Gold Coast Half Marathon and Marathon are big draws for Japanese corporate leaguers these days, especially with a big contingent from this year's National Corporate Half Marathon dominating the entry lists in the half. Two-time winner Sara Hall is top-ranked in the women's half with a 1:07:15 from Houston two years ago and will mostly be racing Leanne Pompeani for the win. Beyond that there's a big group at the 1:10 level including Japan's Rinka Hida, Yukari Nagatomo and Moe Shimizu who should all be in it for 3rd.\n\nThe men's half is dominated by four Japanese men who broke 1:01 at the National Corporate Half in February, meaning that if the weather is decent then the 1:01:16 CR is likely to fall to Shunsuke Shikama, Koki Kamata, Soshi Suzuki or Daisuke Doi. That's a big if, though, with >50% chance of rain and a headwind in the 2nd half that's forecast to get stronger as the race goes along.\n\nThe favorite for the win and a shot at American Lindsay Flanagan's 2:24:43 event record is Kenyan Visiline Jepkesho, 2:22:52 in Seoul this year. Japan's Rie Kawauchi and Ethiopian Sichala Kumeshi are both podium contenders, Kawauchi with a 2:25:35 in Osaka two years ago and Sichala 2:26:53 in Hamburg last year. Japanese women won the marathon at the Gold Coast seven times in the ten years from 2007 to 2016, but since Misato Horie's win in 2016 they've only had two 3rd-place finishes, one by Risa Takenaka in 2017 and the other by Shiho Kaneshige in 2022. Both Horie and Kaneshige are back this time, with Aynalem Kasahun Teferi and Kaneshige rounding out the list of current sub-2:30 women in the race.\n\nJapanese men have won it four of the last five editions, and the last time a Japanese man wasn't in the top two was 2015. Last year Naoki Koyama set a course record 2:07:40, then went on to win the Paris Olympic marathon trials, then ran 2:06:33 in Osaka this past February. Given that kind of progression, the field this year is packed with 2nd-tier Japanese men hoping to have the same success, ten of them who've run 2:07 to 2:09 in the last two years.\n\nMost of the action looks like it'll be down around the 3rd to 5th-ranked runners, with 2:07:53 Kenyan Timothy Kipkorir Kattam looking like the best bet to break the Japanese streak carried this year by Yuta Koyama, 2:07:57 in Osaka last year, and Mizuki Higashi, 2:08:03 in Osaka this year. Top-ranked Kenyan Felix Kandie has a 2:07:18 in Seoul two years ago, but with only a 2:11:57 season best last year it'll be tough for him to stay in contention here. Six other Japanese come in with recent times between 2:08:29 and 2:08:44, and with the weather looking better for Sunday expect to see all of them go with the lead pace group at 3:01/km.\n\nStreaming of both races will be here starting at 6:00 a.m. local time both days. JRN's Brett Larner will be sitting in on guest commentary on the marathon broadcast again this year.\n\nGold Coast Half Marathon and Marathon Elite Field Highlights\n\nGold Coast, Australia, 7 July 2024\n\ntimes listed are best in 2022~2024 except where noted\n\nHalf Marathon Women\n\nSara Hall (U.S.A.) - 1:07:15 (Houston 2022)\n\nLeanne Pompeani (Australia) - 1:09:07 (Gold Coast 2023)\n\nNatasha Wodak (Canada) - 1:10:01 (New York 2022)\n\nRinka Hida (Japan) - 1:10:10 (Osaka 2023)\n\nYukari Nagatomo (Japan) - 1:10:34 (National Corporate Half 2024)\n\nMoe Shimizu (Japan) - 1:10:37 (National Corporate Half 2024)\n\nAndrea Seccafien (Canada) - 1:11:33 (New York 2022)\n\nJessica Stenson (Australia) - 1:11:35 (Gold Coast 2022)\n\nHalf Marathon Men\n\nShunsuke Shikama (Japan) - 1:00:41 (National Corporate Half 2024)\n\nKoki Kamata (Japan) - 1:00:47 (National Corporate Half 2024)\n\nSoshi Suzuki (Japan) - 1:00:49 (National Corporate Half 2024)\n\nDaisuke Doi (Japan) - 1:00:51 (National Corporate Half 2024)\n\nTim Vincent (Australia) - 1:02:01 (Marugame 2024)\n\nHaruki Abe (Japan) - 1:02:05 (Marugame 2023)\n\nNaoya Sakuda (Japan) - 1:02:22 (Gifu 2022)\n\nRiley Cocks (Australia) - 1:02:43 (Marugame 2023)\n\nRei Yamahira (Japan) - 1:02:48 (Setagaya 2022)\n\nCameron Avery (New Zealand) - 1:02:50 (Gold Coast 2023)\n\nEd Goddard (Australia) - 1:02:52 (Valencia 2023)\n\nAndrew Buchanan (Australia) - 1:03:12 (Sunshine Coast 2023)\n\nKenya Sonota (Japan) - 1:03:14 (National Corporate Half 2018)\n\nSeth O'Donnell (Australia) - 1:03:40 (Gold Coast 2023)\n\nJo Fukuda (Japan) - 1:04:41 (Osaka 2024)\n\nMarathon Women\n\nVisiline Jepkesho (Kenya) - 2:22:52 (Seoul 2024)\n\nRie Kawauchi (Japan) - 2:25:35 (Osaka 2022)\n\nSichala Kumeshi (Ethiopia) - 2:26:53 (Hamburg 2023)\n\nAynalem Kasahun Teferi (Ethiopia) - 2:29:11 (Seville 2022)\n\nShiho Kaneshige (Japan) - 2:29:12 (Gold Coast 2022)\n\nMin Liu (China) - 2:29:24 (Wuxi 2024)\n\nSarah Klein (Australia) - 2:30:10 (Eugene 2022)\n\nYuki Nakamura (Japan) - 2:30:31 (Nagoya 2024)\n\nIrene Jerobon (Kenya) - 2:30:51 (Castellon 2024)\n\nMisato Horie (Japan) - 2:32:10 (Osaka 2022)\n\nTara Palm (Australia) - 2:32:25 (Osaka 2024)\n\nAi Ikemoto (Japan) - 2:34:17 (Hofu 2022)\n\nGemma Maini (Japan) - 2:35:25 (Melbourne 2023)\n\nElla McCartney (Australia) - 2:38:43 (Gold Coast 2023)\n\nAbigail Nordberg (Australia) - debut - 1:11:53 (Launceston 2022)\n\nBrigid Dennehy (New Zealand) - debut - 1:15:00 (Southport 2023\n\nMarathon Men\n\nFelix Kipchirchir Kandie (Kenya) - 2:07:18 (Seoul 2022)\n\nYuki Kawauchi (Japan) - 2:07:35 (Osaka 2023)\n\nTimothy Kipkorir Kattam (Kenya) - 2:07:53 (Milan 2023)\n\nYuta Koyama (Japan) - 2:07:57 (Osaka 2023)\n\nMizuki Higashi (Japan) - 2:08:03 (Osaka 2024)\n\nYuki Nakamura (Japan) - 2:08:29 (Hofu 2022)\n\nKiyoshi Koga (Japan) - 2:08:30 (Beppu-Oita 2022)\n\nDaiji Kawai (Japan) - 2:08:31 (Tokyo 2022)\n\nKenji Yamamoto (Japan) - 2:08:33 (Tokyo 2024)\n\nNaoki Aiba (Japan) - 2:08:44 (Beppu-Oita 2022)\n\nRintaro Takeda (Japan) - 2:08:48 (Osaka 2022)\n\nMasaki Tsuda (Japan) - 2:10:40 (Beppu-Oita 2023)\n\nKibet Soyekwo (Uganda) - 2:10:58 (MIlan 2023)\n\nJoshua Iżewski (U.S.A.) - 2:11:09 (Orlando 2024)\n\nGeoffrey Birgen (Kenya) - 2:11:22 (Buriram 2024)\n\nAkihiro Kaneko (Japan) - 2:11:39 (Osaka 2022)\n\nKeisuke Yokota (Japan) - 2:11:43 (Osaka 2023)\n\nBelay Tilahun (Ethiopia) - 2:11:49 (Dalian 2023)\n\nThomas Do Canto (Australia) - 2:11:51 (Valencia 2023)\n\nKenneth Omulo (Kenya) - 2:12:38 (Izmir 2023)\n\nReece Edwards (Australia) - 2:14:34 (Melbourne 2023)\n\nAnubaike Kuwan (China) - 2:14:34 (Beijing 2022)\n\nLiam Boudin (Australia) - debut - 1:03:02 (Sunshine Coast Half 2022)\n\ntext and photos © 2024 Brett Larner, all rights reserved\n\nLabels\n\nWe've been busy the last few days working with the Mongolian marathon team at the Paris Olympics. Catching up on the Japanese national team's performances over the last 3 days of athletics competition, the big news was of course world champion Haruka Kitaguchi scoring Japan's first and only medal in Paris, gold in the javelin on her first throw. In the final evening session on Saturday Kitaguchi came out swinging with a season best 65.80 m first throw that left the rest of the field fighting for silver. South African Jo-Ane Van Dyk came closest to Kitaguchi's mark at 63.93 m, just holding off Czech Nikola Ogrodnikova for silver by 25 cm. Japan's other javelin finalist Momone Ueda was 10th with a season best 61.64 m throw. Kitaguchi's gold was the first-ever for a female Japanese athlete in the javelin throw and the first by any Japanese athlete since Mizuki Noguchi in the Athens Olympics marathon. Kitaguchi was seriously burned by the JAAF's massive 90%\n\nWith renewed confidence, Japan's Olympic marathon team will face the total 438 m elevation difference hills of Paris this summer. The members of the women's and men's marathon teams for August's Paris Olympics appeared at a press conference in Tokyo on Mar. 25 in conjunction with the Japan Marathon Championship Series III (JMC) awards gala. Women's Olympic trials winner Yuka Suzuki (Daiichi Seimei) said she was riding a wave of motivation in the wake of the new women's national record. When she watched Honami Maeda (Tenmaya) set the record at January's Osaka International Women's Marathon on TV, Suzuki said she was, \"absolutely stunned.\" Her coach Sachiko Yamashita told her afterward, \"When someone breaks the NR, things change,\" and Suzuki found herself saying, \"I want to take my shot.\" After training for a great run in Paris, she said, \"I definitely want to break the NR in one of my marathons after that.\" Mao\n\nA 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female runner along the banks of the Tama River in Ota Ward, Tokyo. \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go for a walk and move my body a bit,\" the man told police. Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River. According to police, the woman was taking a break in her run when Muroyama approached her silently from behind and grabbed her breasts before running away. Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey"
