        "text": "Josai University's Yuito Yamamoto was the only individual athlete to set a new course record for one of the Hakone Ekiden's ten stages, but the 100th was still a record-breaking edition in other ways. Both defending champion Komazawa University and eventual winner Aoyama Gakuin University broke Aoyama Gakuin's old record of 5:21:16 for the 107.5 km, ~800 m uphill Day One course, Komazawa running a strong 5:20:51 but AGU destroying them in 5:18:13.\n\nDay Two wasn't especially fast, but with a 3:03 margin on the overall CR from its Day One win, AGU went on to take 2:17 off its 2022 record of 10:43:42 for the complete 217.1 km course in 10:41:25, an average of 2:57.3/km. Komazawa also went under the 3:00/km barrier in 10:48:00, 2:59.1/km, a time that would have been good enough to win almost any previous edition and only 49 seconds slower than its winning time last year. A total of nine teams broke 11 hours, consistent with the explosion in depth since 2020.\n\nYamamoto won the 100th Hakone's MVP award for breaking the uphill Fifth Stage record for the second year in a row, but there's no question that the biggest runs of the 100th Hakone were on the 21.4 km Third Stage. 1500 m, 3000 m, 5000 m and 10000 m U20 NR holder Keita Sato ran an amazing 1:00:13, equivalent to a 59:22 half marathon, 38 seconds under the NR and beating the previous fastest-ever by a Japanese athlete by 42 seconds in his first attempt at a distance longer than 11.1 km. Given how he ran in his 27:28.50 debut for 10000 m in November that wasn't a major surprise, but in a stunning upset AGU's Aoi Ota ran him down to take the lead, clocking 59:47, only 22 seconds off Vincent Yegon's CR and equivalent to a 58:56 half marathon.\n\nIt's hard to understand how he did it. The Third Stage is downhill at the beginning, but there was no substantial wind, and Ota's 5000 m and 10000 m bests were only 13:53.10 and 28:20.63 compared to Sato's 13:22.91 and 27:28.50. There was nothing there to suggest that Ota was capable of running over a minute faster than the Japanese half marathon NR, except maybe that he was wearing the new Adidas Adizero Pro Evo 1. Given the kinds of times everyone else ran on the Third Stage it's safe to say that while AGU was strong overall, the majority of its final 2:17 under the old overall CR came thanks to Ota.\n\nIgnoring the two mountain stages and normalizing the other 20.9 km to 23.1 km stages to the half marathon distance, a total of 67 people ran the equivalent of a sub-63 half marathon, exactly the same as last year, and 40 ran sub-62, the same as in 2022. The slowest of the 23 runners on then 21.3 km First Stage, Ryuto Hirashima of Nittai University, ran the equivalent of 1:02:59 compared to his half marathon PB of 1:03:47. A total of 15 people ran the equivalent of sub-61 and 2 sub-60, both new records, and Ota followed Yegon as the second Hakone runner in history under 59 minutes. For comparison, out of the 41 men on the 21.9 km long stage at the Jan. 1 New Year Ekiden national corporate championships, with a strong tailwind 37 ran the equivalent of sub-63, 29 went sub-62, 12 sub-61 and 2 sub-60. Stage winner Tomoki Ota of champion team Toyota ran 59:25, 3 seconds slower than Komazawa's Sato.\n\nAll 40 runners who ran sub-62 at Hakone, with their half marathon PBs in parentheses and the equivalent half marathon to what they ran on their Hakone:\n\nFirst Stage (21.3 km)\n\nKotaro Shinohara (3rd yr., Komazawa Univ., 1:00:11) - 1:00:28 - all-time #2\n\nDaisuke Kuwata (4th yr., Soka Univ., 1:03:07) - 1:00:50\n\nHayato Nomura (4th yr., Josai Univ., 1:03:51) - 1:00:51\n\nShota Nishimura (4th yr., Nihon Univ., 1:02:53) - 1:00:53\n\nJuda Hyodo (2nd yr., Tokai Univ., 1:03:33) - 1:00:58\n\nStephen Lemayan (1st yr,, Surugadai Univ., 1:01:56) - 1:00:59\n\nShota Nishiwaki (4th yr., Teikyo Univ., 1:02:25) - 1:01:01\n\nShuto Ominato (1st yr., Meiji Univ., 1:02:54) - 1:01:02\n\nTomoki Aramaki (2nd yr., Aoyama Gakuin Univ., 1:03:11) - 1:01:02\n\nRyuji Miura (4th yr., Juntendo Univ., 1:01:41) - 1:01:03\n\nYoshiteru Takatsuki (4th yr., Tokyo Nogyo Univ., 1:02:19) - 1:01:10\n\nJunpei Maseda (2nd yr., Waseda Univ., 1:04:50) - 1:01:18\n\nChio Nishikawa (3rd yr., Daito Bunka Univ., 1:02:19) - 1:01:22\n\nKodai Miyaoka (3rd yr., Hosei Univ., 1:02:07) - 1:01:28\n\nKeishun Kushima (4th yr., Toyo Univ., 1:03:25) - 1:01:33\n\nSunao Kitamura (4th yr., Yamanashi Gakuin Univ., 1:02:23) - 1:01:38\n\nKenzo Ijichi (4th yr., Koku Gakuin Univ., 1:02:22) - 1:01:59\n\nSecond Stage (23.1 km)\n\nAsahi Kuroda (2nd yr., Aoyama Gakuin Univ., 1:03:02) - 1:00:24 - all-time #4\n\nMebuki Suzuki (4th yr., Komazawa Univ., 1:03:07) - 1:00:35 - all-time #9\n\nKiyoto Hirabayashi (3rd yr., Koku Gakuin Univ., 1:01:50) - 1:00:41\n\nTomonori Yamaguchi (2nd yr., Waseda Univ., 1:01:16) - 1:00:45\n\nStephen Muthini (1st yr., Soka Univ., no half PB) - 1:00:56\n\nRen Umezaki (3rd yr., Toyo Univ., 1:02:41) - 1:00:58\n\nNeo Namiki (4th yr., Tokyo Nogyo Univ., 1:02:35) - 1:01:15\n\nShoya Saito (2nd yr., Josai Univ., 1:03:18) - 1:01:26\n\nBrian Kipyegon (1st yr., Yamanashi Gakuin Univ., 1:01:07) - 1:01:32\n\nShadrack Kipkemei (1st yr., Nihon Univ., 1:00:16) - 1:01:40\n\nRei Matsunaga (4th yr., Hosei Univ., 1:01:56) - 1:01:42\n\nToru Kubota (4th yr., Daito Bunka Univ., 1:02:23) - 1:01:44\n\nHisaya Hanaoka (2nd yr., Tokai Univ., 1:03:23) - 1:01:46\n\nThird Stage (21.4 km)\n\nAoi Ota (3rd yr., Aoyama Gakuin Univ., no half PB) - 58:57 - all-time #2\n\nKeita Sato (2nd yr., Komazawa Univ., no half PB) - 59:22 - all-time #3\n\nVictor Kimutai (2nd yr., Josai Univ., 1:02:21) - 1:00:37 - all-time #10\n\nFu Ando (4th yr., Nihon Univ., 1:03:57) - 1:01:04\n\nRui Aoki (2nd yr., Koku Gakuin Univ., 1:02:02) - 1:01:04\n\nRyota Kobayashi (3rd yr., Toyo Univ., 1:03:42) - 1:01:11\n\nFumiya Tsuji (4th yr., Waseda Univ., 1:03:56) - 1:01:46\n\nKento Baba (2nd yr., Rikkyo Univ., 1:02:35) - 1:01:55\n\nFourth Stage (20.9 km)\n\nIssei Sato (4th yr., Aoyama Gakuin Univ., 1:03:05) - 1:01:45 - all-time #7\n\nSeventh Stage (21.3 km)\n\nShunsuke Yoshii (2nd yr., Chuo Univ., 1:06:59) - 1:01:52 - all-time #4\n\nOther runners were over sub-62 half marathon pace or ran mountain stages but still set all-time top ten marks:\n\nFourth Stage (20.9 km)\n\nKazuki Matsuyama (4th yr., Toyo Univ., 1:00:43) - 1:02:22 - all-time #9\n\nFifth Stage (20.8 km, ~800 m elevation gain)\n\nYuito Yamamoto (4th yr., Josai. Univ., 1:01:34) - 1:10:14 - CR\n\nHiroki Wakabayashi (3rd yr., Aoyama Gakuin Univ., 1:01:25) - 1:10:32 - all-time #2\n\nIbuki Kaneko (4th yr., Komazawa Univ., 1:03:32) - 1:11:45 - all-time #9\n\nSixth Stage (20.8 km, ~800 m elevation loss)\n\nKazuma Takeda (3rd yr., Hosei Univ., 1:02:48) - 58:52 - all-time #6\n\nEighth Stage (21.4 km)\n\nShota Shiode (2nd yr., Aoyama Gakuin Univ., 1:02:01) - 1:03:06 - all-time #3\n\nTenth Stage (23.0 km)\n\nRyotaro Kishimoto (2nd yr., Toyo Univ., 1:03:39) - 1:03:10 - all-time #6\n\nGoing back to team results, both Aoyama Gakuin and Komazawa cleared 3:00/km average for the full 217.1 km, ten-stage course. At the New Year Ekiden, 9 of the 41 teams were slower than 3:00/km for 100.0 km in seven stages. AGU's pace of 2:57.3/km would have been good for 14th. Cutting out the two mountain stages and its slowest remaining runner, its pace for 152.5 km in seven stages would have been 2:54.8/km. That would have beaten New Year Ekiden 3rd-placer Asahi Kasei 4:51:21 to 4:51:27, but with the AGU runners averaging 50% longer stages. Komazawa would have beaten 5th-place Mitsubishi Juko. 4:53:40 to 4:53:45. A little more parity in length and at least 2nd-placerHonda, 4:51:11, would definitely have been in AGU's range. As we head into 2024, the revolution that began in 2013 doesn't show any sign of slowing down.\n\n© 2024 Brett Larner, all rights reserved\n\nLabels\n\nWe've been busy the last few days working with the Mongolian marathon team at the Paris Olympics. Catching up on the Japanese national team's performances over the last 3 days of athletics competition, the big news was of course world champion Haruka Kitaguchi scoring Japan's first and only medal in Paris, gold in the javelin on her first throw. In the final evening session on Saturday Kitaguchi came out swinging with a season best 65.80 m first throw that left the rest of the field fighting for silver. South African Jo-Ane Van Dyk came closest to Kitaguchi's mark at 63.93 m, just holding off Czech Nikola Ogrodnikova for silver by 25 cm. Japan's other javelin finalist Momone Ueda was 10th with a season best 61.64 m throw. Kitaguchi's gold was the first-ever for a female Japanese athlete in the javelin throw and the first by any Japanese athlete since Mizuki Noguchi in the Athens Olympics marathon. Kitaguchi was seriously burned by the JAAF's massive 90%\n\nWith renewed confidence, Japan's Olympic marathon team will face the total 438 m elevation difference hills of Paris this summer. The members of the women's and men's marathon teams for August's Paris Olympics appeared at a press conference in Tokyo on Mar. 25 in conjunction with the Japan Marathon Championship Series III (JMC) awards gala. Women's Olympic trials winner Yuka Suzuki (Daiichi Seimei) said she was riding a wave of motivation in the wake of the new women's national record. When she watched Honami Maeda (Tenmaya) set the record at January's Osaka International Women's Marathon on TV, Suzuki said she was, \"absolutely stunned.\" Her coach Sachiko Yamashita told her afterward, \"When someone breaks the NR, things change,\" and Suzuki found herself saying, \"I want to take my shot.\" After training for a great run in Paris, she said, \"I definitely want to break the NR in one of my marathons after that.\" Mao\n\nA 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female runner along the banks of the Tama River in Ota Ward, Tokyo. \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go for a walk and move my body a bit,\" the man told police. Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River. According to police, the woman was taking a break in her run when Muroyama approached her silently from behind and grabbed her breasts before running away. Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey"
