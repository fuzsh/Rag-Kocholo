        "text": "Flying Tiger is a Danish design store — they’ve recently opened a location in New York, and when I checked it out recently, I found that they have some amazingly cheap notebooks!\n\nThey have colorful composition books for only $2:\n\nThere are also 3 sizes of hardcover journals, 4×6″ for $1, 6×8″ for $2, and 8×12″ for $3.\n\nThey come in a variety of solid colors and patterns.\n\nIt seems like the kind of store where the products are frequently changing, so it will be interesting to see what other notebooks come along over the next few months…\n\nThis week’s addict is a self-described “Moleskine whore” who blogged about his sudden infatuation at NitroCats:\n\n“I have a confession to make: Iâ€™ve become a bit of a Moleskine whore. And Iâ€™m okay with that. It started a few months ago when I wanted to get back into screenwriting and wasnâ€™t feeling very creative sitting in front of a word processor. So I packed the nearest notebook I could find and wrote things down the old-fashioned way. And it felt great….\n\nA few months go by and my Moleskine collection has multiplied like a horny jackrabbit. “\n\nThat does indeed look like a pretty serious addiction! A whole shelf-full of various sizes and styles of Moleskines, all waiting to be filled!\n\nRead more at: I’ve become a bit of a Moleskine whore – NitroCats\n\nHere’s an article I came across at Medium.com:\n\nInside a Logo Designer’s Sketchbook:\n\n“Every designer has their own design process, but paper and pen is the first place to start for most. You can quickly sketch and explore ideas with no limitations.\n\nSome designers may choose to work directly on the computer, but personally I find that designs can feel refined and perfected far too quickly without any real experimentation. Sketching on paper allows slight variants to be explored very quickly, and often small mistakes and scribbles can actually form the basis of better ideas. I spend most of my time on the computer anyway, so drawing in a sketchbook is a welcoming break.\n\nThe beauty of drawing ideas on paper is that you can scribble without worry. Nobody is going to see your work. You can scribble and doodle for as long as you want. Sometimes an idea might be rubbish, but who cares? Free your mind of those crazy ideas, and doodle until the perfect idea comes together. You donâ€™t need to draw perfectly or be an artist as long as you can produce the final piece. All thatâ€™s being put on paper at this stage is the underlying idea, and its for your reference only.”\n\nLots more to read and additional images at Medium.com.\n\nI noticed these two dueling articles, both on the Harvard Business Review website:\n\nWhat You Miss When You Take Notes on Your Laptop\n\n“Even in my relatively short foray into office life, I notice that few people bring a pen and notebook to meetings. Iâ€™ve been told that over the years, the spiral notebooks and pens once prevalent during weekly meetings have been replaced with laptops and slim, touch-screen tablets.\n\nI suppose it makes sense. In a demanding new age of technology, we are expected to send links, access online materials, and conduct virtual chats while a meeting is taking place. We want instant gratification, and sending things after the meeting when youâ€™re back at your desk feels like too long to wait. It seems that digital note-taking is just more convenient.\n\nBut is longhand dead? Should you be embarrassed bringing a pen and paper to your meetings? To answer these questions, I did a little digging and found that the answer is no, according to a study conducted by Princetonâ€™s Pam A. Mueller and UCLAâ€™s Daniel M. Oppenheimer. Their research shows that when you only use a laptop to take notes, you donâ€™t absorb new materials as well, largely because typing notes encourages verbatim, mindless transcription.”\n\nDear Colleague, Put the Notebook Down\n\n“I knew right away, when you walked in here with a paper notebook â€” a paper notebook! â€” I realized that this meeting was not going to be a good use of our time.\n\nYouâ€™d make better use of your time if you took your notes in digital form, ideally in an access-anywhere digital notebook like Evernote that makes retrieval a snap. If you had that, I could shoot you the link of the book I want you to read, or the contact card of the person you want to meet. And if you planned to act any of the ideas or outcomes from this meeting, you would want to pop the follow-up tasks into your task management program.\n\nUnless you reserve 20 minutes after each meeting to transcribe your notes and enter your follow-up tasks, however, most of this meetingâ€™s value will slip like sand through a sieve. And if youâ€™re taking 20 minutes to transcribe each meeting, youâ€™re losing several hours per week of productive work time.”\n\nNow obviously, I like paper notebooks. I like digital tools too. But I found the “you’re wasting my time and yours” tone of the anti-paper article to be extremely rude and condescending. Why should my paper notebook stop anyone from sending me a digital note? I wouldn’t be reading that book or calling that person til I got back to my desktop computer anyway! And the research in the first article indicates that typing notes on a laptop may change the way people process information, in a negative way.\n\nUltimately, everyone will have their own preferred style of taking notes in a method that works well for them. I usually have a paper notebook AND a digital device when I go to a meeting. I can quickly jot down notes, circle things, draw arrows, whatever. (I also doodle a lot, and there have been studies that claim doodling can help you focus, rather than being a distraction.) I may later transfer something from my notes to digital form, but it certainly doesn’t take me 20 minutes. I could never take notes as efficiently on a tablet or laptop, but I like having one handy in case I do need to look something up or refer to an email. If someone else uses a laptop in a meeting, I don’t hold it against them, and I would expect them to respect my choice of note-taking method too."
