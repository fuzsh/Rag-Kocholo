        "text": "http://sankei.jp.msn.com/politics/local/081107/lcl0811071352000-n1.htm\n\nhttp://www.tokyo42195.org/2009/news/post_13.html\n\ntranslated and edited by Brett Larner\n\nOn the afternoon of Nov. 7 Tokyo mayor Shintaro Ishihara announced the first-ever prize money purse for the 2009 Tokyo Marathon, to be awarded to the top finishers in next March's 3rd running. The complete purse totals $1,084,000 including $352,000 in prize money and $732,000 in time bonuses with a maximum potential payout of $460,000 to the men's winner.\n\nThe 1st place male and female finishers will receive $80,000, with 2nd place getting $40,000 and 3rd place $20,000. Prize money goes 10 deep, with the 10th place finisher receiving $1000. A Japanese runner who wins in a new national record will receive a $50,000 bonus, while a new world record would be good for a $300,000 bonus. Because officials hope to make the Tokyo Marathon the key domestic selection race for men's Olympic and World Championships teams, a Japanese man who wins in a course record time will receive a $30,000 bonus. The first 2 editions of the Tokyo Marathon did not include an elite women's field, so no course record bonus will be available this year for women. Altogether, this means that a Japanese man who sets a world record in Tokyo would receive a total prize payout of $460,000, while a Japanese woman who sets a world record would receive $430,000. The winners in the wheelchair division will receive $20,000, with wheelchair prize money running 3 deep.\n\nThe Tokyo Marathon received a silver rating from the IAAF. To help improve the event's ranking, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government closely examined the gold label New York City Marathon and London Marathon's prize money structure, particularly New York's $130,000 prize for 1st place and London's $55,000 winner's prize.\n\nA complete breakdown of the prize money available at the 2009 Tokyo Marathon is available in English here.\n\nLabels\n\nWe've been busy the last few days working with the Mongolian marathon team at the Paris Olympics. Catching up on the Japanese national team's performances over the last 3 days of athletics competition, the big news was of course world champion Haruka Kitaguchi scoring Japan's first and only medal in Paris, gold in the javelin on her first throw. In the final evening session on Saturday Kitaguchi came out swinging with a season best 65.80 m first throw that left the rest of the field fighting for silver. South African Jo-Ane Van Dyk came closest to Kitaguchi's mark at 63.93 m, just holding off Czech Nikola Ogrodnikova for silver by 25 cm. Japan's other javelin finalist Momone Ueda was 10th with a season best 61.64 m throw. Kitaguchi's gold was the first-ever for a female Japanese athlete in the javelin throw and the first by any Japanese athlete since Mizuki Noguchi in the Athens Olympics marathon. Kitaguchi was seriously burned by the JAAF's massive 90%\n\nWith renewed confidence, Japan's Olympic marathon team will face the total 438 m elevation difference hills of Paris this summer. The members of the women's and men's marathon teams for August's Paris Olympics appeared at a press conference in Tokyo on Mar. 25 in conjunction with the Japan Marathon Championship Series III (JMC) awards gala. Women's Olympic trials winner Yuka Suzuki (Daiichi Seimei) said she was riding a wave of motivation in the wake of the new women's national record. When she watched Honami Maeda (Tenmaya) set the record at January's Osaka International Women's Marathon on TV, Suzuki said she was, \"absolutely stunned.\" Her coach Sachiko Yamashita told her afterward, \"When someone breaks the NR, things change,\" and Suzuki found herself saying, \"I want to take my shot.\" After training for a great run in Paris, she said, \"I definitely want to break the NR in one of my marathons after that.\" Mao\n\nA 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female runner along the banks of the Tama River in Ota Ward, Tokyo. \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go for a walk and move my body a bit,\" the man told police. Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River. According to police, the woman was taking a break in her run when Muroyama approached her silently from behind and grabbed her breasts before running away. Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey"
