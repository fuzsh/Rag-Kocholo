        "text": "Kamefuchi wrote an essay about Heisenberg’s and Yukawa’s tragic incidents in their later years. We have studied facts related to these incidents by looking up other references and found that Kamefuchi’s suppositions at three minor points about Heisenberg’s case are wrong. We have reviewed the literature evaluating the studies of the above two physicists in those years. The result has revealed that Heisenberg’s work influenced Nambu for finding spontaneous symmetry breaking in subatomic physics. On the other hand, Yukawa’s work has not had much impact on other researchers. We have also compared Kamefuchi’s classification of research methods of theoretical physics with Nambu’s two versions. The descending type method defined by Kamefuchi gives a convincing reason for the two physicists’ failures in finishing the later studies. To remove faults in Nambu’s revised version, we propose a new, two-aspect scheme, which indicates that the esthetic, bottom-up mode kept by Nambu made him a long-time productive theorist. In Appendix B, we describe Kamefuchi’s classification of theoretical physicists given in another essay and suggest a possible extension of our proposal.
