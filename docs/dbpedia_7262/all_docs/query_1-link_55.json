        "text": "With renewed confidence, Japan's Olympic marathon team will face the total 438 m elevation difference hills of Paris this summer. The members of the women's and men's marathon teams for August's Paris Olympics appeared at a press conference in Tokyo on Mar. 25 in conjunction with the Japan Marathon Championship Series III (JMC) awards gala.\n\nWomen's Olympic trials winner Yuka Suzuki (Daiichi Seimei) said she was riding a wave of motivation in the wake of the new women's national record. When she watched Honami Maeda (Tenmaya) set the record at January's Osaka International Women's Marathon on TV, Suzuki said she was, \"absolutely stunned.\" Her coach Sachiko Yamashita told her afterward, \"When someone breaks the NR, things change,\" and Suzuki found herself saying, \"I want to take my shot.\" After training for a great run in Paris, she said, \"I definitely want to break the NR in one of my marathons after that.\"\n\nMao Ichiyama (Shiseido) said that she will be fully prepared for what will be her second Olympic marathon. 8th in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics marathon, Ichiyama smiled as she said, \"I never thought I'd be an Olympian two Games in a row!\" Having won the women's race at the tough and hilly Ome 30 km Road Race in February, Ichiyama has yet to see the equally hard Paris course. \"When I stand on the starting line, I want to be able to have the confidence of knowing my training was even harder,\" she said.\n\nNew national record holder Maeda already faces the Olympics with belief in herself. Only 7th in the Olympic trials last October, at the Osaka International Women's Marathon in January she ran 2:18:59 to take 13 seconds off the longstanding NR. \"I had a long stretch when I wasn't running well, but breaking the NR gives me a lot of confidence.\" At the Tokyo Olympics she finished last among the Japanese women in a humiliating 33rd after having won the Olympic trials. \"I'm very proud to get to represent Japan at two consecutive Olympics, and I want to be ready to run my absolute best,\" she said.\n\n3rd at the Paris Olympic trials in October, women's team alternate Ai Hosoda (Edion) said, \"As a member of the team I'll be training with the same desire to run my absolute best.\"\n\nAhead of their first Olympics, men's team members Naoki Koyama (Honda) and Akira Akasaki (Kyudenko) spent time on the Paris course last fall. After seeing the difficult course full of ups and downs firsthand, both were confident. During the press conference, JAAF marathon development executive Toshihiko Seko asked, \"Do you personally think the Paris course is good or bad?\" Both men's first reactions were the same, saying enthusiastically, \"I think it's a big plus!\"\n\nKoyama has been reliably stable in his four marathons over the last year, winning two of them and repeatedly improving his PB to the point of clocking the 10th-fastest ever time by a Japanese man at February's Osaka Marathon, where he ran 2:06:33 for 3rd. \"There was a lot of attention on me whenever I raced, but that was good experience to get before the Olympics,\" he said. The 15-hour trip to Paris to see the course after the Olympic trials last fall was a new experience for Koyama, but while he was surprised by how hilly the course was, he said, \"If you train for hills and dealing with heat then there's a lot of potential there.\"\n\nAkasaki has already been focusing on hills, increasing the number of them on his regular runs at his base in Fukuoka since he earned his Olympic spot last October. In February he won the extremely hilly Ome 30 km Road Race in 1:29:46. \"I'm strong on hills,\" he said.\n\nBoth men have already set their plans to build their base for the tough course that awaits them. Koyama plans to head to the U.S. for altitude training starting in June. Akasaki will run outdoor track season through early May to work on his speed. Asked, \"What does it take to perform in the main event?\" both answered, \"Steady training without getting injured.\"\n\nThird men's team member Suguru Osako (GMO) was absent, saying he had other plans. Before the JMC awards, where he won ¥900,000 for placing 5th, Osako tweeted, \"There's these rankings I don't understand. What's this JMC??\" The former national record holder's tweet expressing ignorance about his industry drew negative responses from fans.\n\nsource article:\n\nhttps://www.nikkansports.com/sports/athletics/news/202403250001274.html\n\ntranslated and edited by Brett Larner\n\nLabels\n\nTwo-time Olympic marathoner Suguru Osako posted on his Instagram story on Aug. 26 about his trail running debut at last weekend's UTMB MCC in Chamonix, France with support from his high school friend, trail runner Ruy Ueda . Osako ran the 40 km division with 2300 m cumulative elevation gain. In 4th at the first checkpoint, he slowed partway through when the course got steep and rocky. \"To be honest it was too scary,\" he wrote. \"How can people run there? LOL. It was different from what I'd heard. Mostly rock.\" Osako struggled on the descents, writing that he had cramps in his legs. Video showed trail specialists running smoothly past him on a steep downhill. But in the end he managed to finished, placing 50th among men and 52nd overall in 4:30:41. Afterward he wrote, \"It was scarier than I expected and my legs wouldn't move, even more on the downhills where I'm terrible. But at least I was able to make a mark in the safe first 10k! LOL. I'v\n\n2018 World Half Marathon Championships bronze medalist Pauline Kamulu Kaveke and Tokyo Olympics marathon trials winner Shogo Nakamura survived tough conditions, 22˚C at the start with 82% humidity, sunny skies and almost no wind, to take the 2024 Hokkaido Marathon Sunday in Sapporo. Both running their debuts, Kamulu and Shiho Tachizako ran steadily around 2:28-flat pace surrounded by a group of amateur men, staying together until just before 30 km when Tachizako started to fade. Kamulu struggled with the hot conditions late in the race and could only watch the clock as sub-2:30 slipped away, looking very tired as she crossed the finish line in 2:31:04. Tachizako faded to 2:33:47 for 2nd, but even that was good enough to easily beat the rest of the field, with last year's 2nd-placer Ayano Ikeuchi 3rd in 2:35:26 in her third marathon so far this year. Nakamura had said pre-race that he didn't care about time and was only focused on getting in the win, and that was exactly ho\n\nThe Lima World U20 Championships start tomorrow. Despite having its best-ever overall medal haul across all sports the Paris Olympics were almost a complete bust for Japan in athletics, with Haruka Kitaguchi 's gold in the women's javelin throw its only gold medal. But there are a lot of medal prospects in Lima, and overall it's probably the best team Japan has ever sent to the U20 World Championships.
