        "text": "November 9, 2010\n\nGraduate School of Science Professor Yoshiteru Maeno has received the Nishina Memorial Prize.\n\nThis prize celebrates the achievements of Dr. Yoshio Nishina. This year marks the 56th time that the Nishina Memorial Foundation has presented this award with the purpose of recognizing relatively young researchers that produce excellent work in the areas of nuclear physics and its application.\n\nProfessor Maeno discovered in 1994 that ruthenates, Sr2RuO4, which possess the same crystal structure as cuprate superconductors, demonstrate superconductivity. During continued research on these materials, he has pointed out the potential for spin-triplet superconductivity in these materials. In order to clarify the microscopic structure of spins during superconductivity, Professor Maeno uses high-quality crystals grown using a unique method to conduct many experiments along with joint researchers. This has resulted in many research results which directly display the spin-triplet superconductivity of this material and has opened a novel area of research in superconductivity.\n\nProfessor Maeno has received this reward in appreciation for his \"discovery of ruthenates as a material with spin-triplet superconductivity\".\n\nThe awards ceremony is planned for December 6 in Tokyo.\n\nRelated link"
