        "text": "Lateral response heterogeneity of Bragg peak ionization chambers for narrow-beam photon and proton dosimetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKuess, Peter; BÃ¶hlen, Till T.; Lechner, Wolfgang; Elia, Alessio; Georg, Dietmar; Palmans, Hugo\n\n2017-12-01\n\nLarge area ionization chambers (LAICs) can be used to measure output factors of narrow beams. Dose area product measurements are proposed as an alternative to central-axis point dose measurements. Using such detectors requires detailed information on the uniformity of the response along the sensitive area. Eight LAICs were investigated in this study: four of type PTW-34070 (LAICThick) and four of type PTW-34080 (LAICThin). Measurements were performed in an x-ray unit using peak voltages of 100-200 kVp and a collimated beam of 3.1âmm (FWHM). The LAICs were moved with a step size of 5âmm to measure the chamber response at lateral positions. To account for beam positions where only a fraction of the beam impinged within the sensitive area of the LAICs, a corrected response was calculated which was the basis to calculate the relative response. The impact of a heterogeneous LAIC response, based on the obtained response maps was henceforth investigated for proton pencil beams and small field photon beams. A pronounced heterogeneity of the responses was observed in the investigated LAICs. The response of LAICThick generally decreased with increasing radius, resulting in a response correction of up to 5%. This correction was more pronounced and more diverse (up to 10%) for LAICThin. Considering a proton pencil beam the systematic offset for reference dosimetry was 2.4-4.1% for LAICThick andââ-9.5 to 9.4% for LAICThin. For relative dosimetry (e.g. integral depth-dose curves) systematic response variation by 0.8-1.9% were found. For a decreasing photon field size the systematic offset for absolute dose measurements showed a 2.5-4.5% overestimation of the response for 6ââÃââ6 mm2 field sizes for LAICThick. For LAICThin the response varied even over a range of 20%. This study highlights the need for chamber-dependent response maps when using LAICs for absolute and relative dosimetry with proton pencil beams or small photon beams.\n\nNarrow bandwidth Laser-Plasma Accelerator driven Thomson photon source development\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGeddes, C. G. R.; Tsai, H.-E.; Otero, G.; Liu, X.; van Tilborg, J.; Toth, Cs.; Vay, J.-L.; Lehe, R.; Schroeder, C. B.; Esarey, E.; Friedman, A.; Grote, D. P.; Leemans, W. P.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nCompact, high-quality photon sources at MeV energies can be provided by Thomson scattering of a laser from the electron beam of a Laser-Plasma Accelerator (LPA). Recent experiments and simulations demonstrate controllable LPAs in the energy range appropriate to MeV sources. Simulations indicate that high flux with narrow energy spread can be achieved via control of the scattering laser pulse shape and laser guiding, and that undesired background bremsstrahlung can be mitigated by plasma based deceleration of the electron beam after photon production. Construction of experiments and laser capabilities to combine these elements will be presented, along with initial operations, towards a compact photon source system.

Polymer gel and magnetic resonance imaging dosimetry was used for this purpose. Profile measurements (Pm(s)) of a 5 mm diameter 6 MV stereotactic beam were performed using polymer gels. Eight measurements of the profile of this narrow beam were performed using correspondingly eight different detector sizes. This was achieved using high spatial resolution (0.25 mm) two-dimensional measurements and eight different signal integration volumes A X A X slice thickness, simulating detectors of different size. \"A\" ranged from 0.25 to 7.5 mm, representing the detector size. The gel-derived profiles exhibited increased penumbra width with increasing detector size, for sizes >0.5 mm. By extrapolating the gel-derived profiles to zero detector size, the true profile (Pt) of the studied beam was derived. The same polymer gel data were also used to simulate a small-volume ion chamber profile measurement of the same beam, in terms of volume averaging. The comparison between these results and actual corresponding small-volume chamber profile measurements performed in this study, reveal that the penumbra broadening caused by both volume averaging and electron transport alterations (present in actual ion chamber profile measurements) is a lot more intense than that resulted by volume averaging effects alone (present in gel-derived profiles simulating ion chamber profile measurements). Therefore, not only the detector size, but also its composition and tissue equivalency is proved to be an important factor for correct narrow beam profile measurements. Additionally, the convolution kernels related to each detector size and to the air ion chamber were calculated using the corresponding profile measurements (Pm(s)), the gel-derived true profile (Pt), and convolution theory. The response kernels of any desired detector can be derived, allowing the elimination of the errors\n\nX-ray luminescence computed tomography imaging via multiple intensity weighted narrow beam irradiation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFeng, Bo; Gao, Feng; Zhao, Huijuan; Zhang, Limin; Li, Jiao; Zhou, Zhongxing\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this work is to introduce and study a novel x-ray beam irradiation pattern for X-ray Luminescence Computed Tomography (XLCT), termed multiple intensity-weighted narrow-beam irradiation. The proposed XLCT imaging method is studied through simulations of x-ray and diffuse lights propagation. The emitted optical photons from X-ray excitable nanophosphors were collected by optical fiber bundles from the right-side surface of the phantom. The implementation of image reconstruction is based on the simulated measurements from 6 or 12 angular projections in terms of 3 or 5 x-ray beams scanning mode. The proposed XLCT imaging method is compared against the constant intensity weighted narrow-beam XLCT. From the reconstructed XLCT images, we found that the Dice similarity and quantitative ratio of targets have a certain degree of improvement. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can offer simultaneously high image quality and fast image acquisition.\n\nPhoton beam position monitor\n\nDOEpatents\n\nKuzay, T.M.; Shu, D.\n\n1995-02-07\n\nA photon beam position monitor is disclosed for use in the front end of a beamline of a high heat flux and high energy photon source such as a synchrotron radiation storage ring detects and measures the position and, when a pair of such monitors are used in tandem, the slope of a photon beam emanating from an insertion device such as a wiggler or an undulator inserted in the straight sections of the ring.

Two such monitors are contemplated for use in the front end of the beamline, with the two monitors having vertically and horizontally offset detector blades to avoid blade ''shadowing''.

A combination of slit-beam, radiochromic film, and deconvolution techniques served to accomplish this task for four detectors with diameters of their sensitive volumes ranging from 1 to 2.2 mm. The particular aim of the experiment was to examine the existence of significant negative portions of some of these response functions predicted by a recent Monte-Carlo-simulation (Looe et al 2015 Phys. Med. Biol. 60 6585-607). In a 6 MV photon slit beam formed by the Siemens Artiste collimation system and a 0.5 mm wide slit between 10 cm thick lead blocks serving as the tertiary collimator, the true cross-beam dose profile D(x) at 3 cm depth in a large water phantom was measured with radiochromic film EBT3, and the detector-affected cross-beam signal profiles M(x) were recorded with a silicon diode, a synthetic diamond detector, a miniaturized scintillation detector, and a small ionization chamber. For each detector, the deconvolution of the convolution integral M(x)ââ=ââK(x)âââââD(x) served to obtain its specific 1D lateral dose response function K(x), and K(r) was calculated from it. Fourier transformations and back transformations were performed using function approximations by weighted sums of Gaussian functions and their analytical transformation. The 1D lateral dose response functions K(x) of the four types of detectors and their associated rotational symmetric counterparts K(r) were obtained. Significant negative curve portions of K(x) and K(r) were observed in the case of the silicon diode and the diamond detector, confirming the Monte-Carlo-based prediction (Looe et al 2015 Phys. Med. Biol. 60 6585-607). They are typical for the perturbation of the secondary electron field by a detector with\n\nSelf-stabilized narrow-bandwidth and high-fidelity entangled photons generated from cold atoms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYu, Y. C.; Ding, D. S.; Dong, M. X.; Shi, S.; Zhang, W.; Shi, B. S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nEntangled photon pairs are critically important in fundamental quantum mechanics research as well as in many areas within the field of quantum information, such as quantum communication, quantum computation, and quantum cryptography. Previous demonstrations of entangled photons based on atomic ensembles were achieved by using a reference laser to stabilize the phase of two spontaneous four-wave mixing paths. Here, we demonstrate a convenient and efficient scheme to generate polarization-entangled photons with a narrow bandwidth of 57.2 Â±1.6 MHz and a high-fidelity of 96.3 Â±0.8 % by using a phase self-stabilized multiplexing system formed by two beam displacers and two half-wave plates where the relative phase between the different signal paths can be eliminated completely. It is possible to stabilize an entangled photon pair for a long time with this system and produce all four Bell states, making this a vital step forward in the field of quantum information.\n\nResonant production of dark photons in positron beam dump experiments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNardi, Enrico; Carvajal, Cristian D. R.; Ghoshal, Anish; Meloni, Davide; Raggi, Mauro\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPositrons beam dump experiments have unique features to search for very narrow resonances coupled superweakly to e+e- pairs. Due to the continued loss of energy from soft photon bremsstrahlung, in the first few radiation lengths of the dump a positron beam can continuously scan for resonant production of new resonances via e+ annihilation off an atomic e- in the target. In the case of a dark photon A' kinetically mixed with the photon, this production mode is of first order in the electromagnetic coupling Î± , and thus parametrically enhanced with respect to the O (Î±2)e+e-âÎ³ A' production mode and to the O (Î±3)A' bremsstrahlung in e- -nucleon scattering so far considered. If the lifetime is sufficiently long to allow the A' to exit the dump, A'âe+e- decays could be easily detected and distinguished from backgrounds. We explore the foreseeable sensitivity of the Frascati PADME experiment in searching with this technique for the 17 MeV dark photon invoked to explain the Be 8 anomaly in nuclear transitions.\n\nUltrabright, narrow-band photon-pair source for atomic quantum memories\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTsai, Pin-Ju; Chen, Ying-Cheng\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe demonstrate an ultrabright, narrow-band and frequency-tunable photon-pair source based on cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) which is compatible with atomic transition of rubidium D 2-line (780 nm) or cesium D 2-line (852 nm). With the pump beam alternating between a high and a low power phase, the output is switching between the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) and photon-pair generation mode. We utilize the OPO output light to lock the cavity length to maintain the double resonances of signal and idler, as well as to lock the signal frequency to cesium atomic transition. With a type-II phase matching and a double-passed pump scheme such that the cluster frequency spacing is larger than the SPDC bandwidth, the photon-pair output is in a nearly single-mode operation as confirmed by a scanning FabryâPerot interferometer with its output detected by a photomultiplier. The achieved generation and detection rates are 7.24Ã {10}5 and 6142 sâ1 mWâ1, respectively. The correlation time of the photon pair is 21.6(2.2) ns, corresponding to a bandwidth of 2Ï Ã 6.6(6) MHz. The spectral brightness is 1.06Ã {10}5 sâ1 mWâ1 MHzâ1. This is a relatively high value under a single-mode operation with the cavity-SPDC scheme. The generated single photons can be readily used in experiments related to atomic quantum memories.\n\nIonization chamber dosimetry of small photon fields: a Monte Carlo study on stopping-power ratios for radiosurgery and IMRT beams.\n\nPubMed\n\nSÃ¡nchez-Doblado, F; Andreo, P; Capote, R; Leal, A; Perucha, M; ArrÃ¡ns, R; NÃºÃ±ez, L; Mainegra, E; Lagares, J I; Carrasco, E\n\n2003-07-21\n\nAbsolute dosimetry with ionization chambers of the narrow photon fields used in stereotactic techniques and IMRT beamlets is constrained by lack of electron equilibrium in the radiation field. It is questionable that stopping-power ratio in dosimetry protocols, obtained for broad photon beams and quasi-electron equilibrium conditions, can be used in the dosimetry of narrow fields while keeping the uncertainty at the same level as for the broad beams used in accelerator calibrations. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed for two 6 MV clinical accelerators (Elekta SL-18 and Siemens Mevatron Primus), equipped with radiosurgery applicators and MLC. Narrow circular and Z-shaped on-axis and off-axis fields, as well as broad IMRT configured beams, have been simulated together with reference 10 x 10 cm2 beams. Phase-space data have been used to generate 3D dose distributions which have been compared satisfactorily with experimental profiles (ion chamber, diodes and film). Photon and electron spectra at various depths in water have been calculated, followed by Spencer-Attix (delta = 10 keV) stopping-power ratio calculations which have been compared to those used in the IAEA TRS-398 code of practice. For water/air and PMMA/air stopping-power ratios, agreements within 0.1% have been obtained for the 10 x 10 cm2 fields. For radiosurgery applicators and narrow MLC beams, the calculated s(w,air) values agree with the reference within +/-0.3%, well within the estimated standard uncertainty of the reference stopping-power ratios (0.5%). Ionization chamber dosimetry of narrow beams at the photon qualities used in this work (6 MV) can therefore be based on stopping-power ratios data in dosimetry protocols. For a modulated 6 MV broad beam used in clinical IMRT, s(w,air) agrees within 0.1% with the value for 10 x 10 cm2, confirming that at low energies IMRT absolute dosimetry can also be based on data for open reference fields. At higher energies (24 MV) the difference in s\n\nUsing narrow beam profiles to quantify focal spot size, for accurate Monte Carlo simulations of SRS/SRT systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKairn, T.; Crowe, S. B.; Charles, P. H.; Trapp, J. V.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThis study investigates the variation of photon field penumbra shape with initial electron beam diameter, for very narrow beams. A Varian Millenium MLC (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) and a Brainlab m3 microMLC (Brainlab AB. Feldkirchen, Germany) were used, with one Varian iX linear accelerator, to produce fields that were (nominally) 0.20 cm across. Dose profiles for these fields were measured using radiochromic film and compared with the results of simulations completed using BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc, where the initial electron beam was set to FWHM = 0.02, 0.10, 0.12, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.50 cm. Increasing the electron-beam FWHM produced increasing occlusion of the photon source by the closely spaced collimator leaves and resulted in blurring of the simulated profile widths from 0.24 to 0.58 cm, for the MLC, from 0.11 to 0.40 cm, for the microMLC. Comparison with measurement data suggested that the electron spot size in the clinical linear accelerator was between FWHM = 0.10 and 0.15 cm, encompassing the result of our previous output-factor based work, which identified a FWHM of 0.12 cm. Investigation of narrow-beam penumbra variation has been found to be a useful procedure, with results varying noticeably with linear accelerator spot size and allowing FWHM estimates obtained using other methods to be verified.\n\nDesign of a fast multileaf collimator for radiobiological optimized IMRT with scanned beams of photons, electrons, and light ions.\n\nPubMed\n\nSvensson, Roger; Larsson, Susanne; Gudowska, Irena; Holmberg, Rickard; Brahme, Anders\n\n2007-03-01\n\nIntensity modulated radiation therapy is rapidly becoming the treatment of choice for most tumors with respect to minimizing damage to the normal tissues and maximizing tumor control. Today, intensity modulated beams are most commonly delivered using segmental multileaf collimation, although an increasing number of radiation therapy departments are employing dynamic multileaf collimation. The irradiation time using dynamic multileaf collimation depends strongly on the nature of the desired dose distribution, and it is difficult to reduce this time to less than the sum of the irradiation times for all individual peak heights using dynamic leaf collimation [Svensson et al., Phys. Med. Biol. 39, 37-61 (1994)]. Therefore, the intensity modulation will considerably increase the total treatment time. A more cost-effective procedure for rapid intensity modulation is using narrow scanned photon, electron, and light ion beams in combination with fast multileaf collimator penumbra trimming. With this approach, the irradiation time is largely independent of the complexity of the desired intensity distribution and, in the case of photon beams, may even be shorter than with uniform beams. The intensity modulation is achieved primarily by scanning of a narrow elementary photon pencil beam generated by directing a narrow well focused high energy electron beam onto a thin bremsstrahlung target. In the present study, the design of a fast low-weight multileaf collimator that is capable of further sharpening the penumbra at the edge of the elementary scanned beam has been simulated, in order to minimize the dose or radiation response of healthy tissues. In the case of photon beams, such a multileaf collimator can be placed relatively close to the bremsstrahlung target to minimize its size. It can also be flat and thin, i.e., only 15-25 mm thick in the direction of the beam with edges made of tungsten or preferably osmium to optimize the sharpening of the penumbra.

Calculations were performed for anterior-posterior, posterior-anterior, left-lateral and right-lateral irradiation geometries. The beam diameter used in the calculations was 7.62 cm and the phantoms were irradiated at a height of 1 m above the ground. This geometry was chosen to simulate an accidental scenario (a worker walking through the beam) at Flight Path 30 Left (FP30L) of the Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The calculations were carried out using the Monte Carlo transport code MCNPX 2.5c.\n\nFundamental limits on beam stability at the Advanced Photon Source.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDecker, G. A.\n\n1998-06-18\n\nOrbit correction is now routinely performed at the few-micron level in the Advanced Photon Source (APS) storage ring. Three diagnostics are presently in use to measure and control both AC and DC orbit motions: broad-band turn-by-turn rf beam position monitors (BPMs), narrow-band switched heterodyne receivers, and photoemission-style x-ray beam position monitors. Each type of diagnostic has its own set of systematic error effects that place limits on the ultimate pointing stability of x-ray beams supplied to users at the APS. Limiting sources of beam motion at present are magnet power supply noise, girder vibration, and thermal timescale vacuum chamber andmoreÂ Â» girder motion. This paper will investigate the present limitations on orbit correction, and will delve into the upgrades necessary to achieve true sub-micron beam stability.Â«Â less\n\nData analysis of photon beam position at PLS-II\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKo, J.; Shin, S., E-mail: tlssh@postech.ac.kr; Huang, Jung-Yun\n\nIn the third generation light source, photon beam position stability is critical issue on user experiment. Generally photon beam position monitors have been developed for the detection of the real photon beam position and the position is controlled by feedback system in order to keep the reference photon beam position. In the PLS-II, photon beam position stability for front end of particular beam line, in which photon beam position monitor is installed, has been obtained less than rms 1Î¼m for user service period. Nevertheless, detail analysis for photon beam position data in order to demonstrate the performance of photon beammoreÂ Â» position monitor is necessary, since it can be suffers from various unknown noises. (for instance, a back ground contamination due to upstream or downstream dipole radiation, undulator gap dependence, etc.) In this paper, we will describe the start to end study for photon beam position stability and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis to demonstrate the reliability on photon beam position data.Â«Â less\n\nPhotonic bandgap narrowing in conical hollow core Bragg fibers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOzturk, Fahri Emre; Yildirim, Adem; Kanik, Mehmet\n\n2014-08-18\n\nWe report the photonic bandgap engineering of Bragg fibers by controlling the thickness profile of the fiber during the thermal drawing. Conical hollow core Bragg fibers were produced by thermal drawing under a rapidly alternating load, which was applied by introducing steep changes to the fiber drawing speed. In conventional cylindrical Bragg fibers, light is guided by omnidirectional reflections from interior dielectric mirrors with a single quarter wave stack period. In conical fibers, the diameter reduction introduced a gradient of the quarter wave stack period along the length of the fiber. Therefore, the light guided within the fiber encountered slightlymoreÂ Â» smaller dielectric layer thicknesses at each reflection, resulting in a progressive blueshift of the reflectance spectrum. As the reflectance spectrum shifts, longer wavelengths of the initial bandgap cease to be omnidirectionally reflected and exit through the cladding, which narrows the photonic bandgap. A narrow transmission bandwidth is particularly desirable in hollow waveguide mid-infrared sensing schemes, where broadband light is coupled to the fiber and the analyte vapor is introduced into the hollow core to measure infrared absorption. We carried out sensing simulations using the absorption spectrum of isopropyl alcohol vapor to demonstrate the importance of narrow bandgap fibers in chemical sensing applications.Â«Â less\n\nSU-F-19A-06: Experimental Investigation of the Energy Dependence of TLD Sensitivity in Low-Energy Photon Beams\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChen, Z; Nath, R\n\nPurpose: To measure the energy dependence of TLD sensitivity in lowenergy photon beams with equivalent mono-energetic energy matching those of 103Pd, 125I and 131Cs brachytherapy sources. Methods: A Pantek DXT 300 x-ray unit (Precision X-ray, Branford, CT), with stable digital voltage control down to 20 kV, was used to establish three lowenergy photon beams with narrow energy spread and equivalent monoenergetic energies matching those of 103Pd, 125I and 131Cs brachytherapy sources. The low-energy x-ray beams and a reference 6 MV photon beam were calibrated according to the AAPM TG-61 and TG-51 protocols, respectively, using a parallel-plate low-energy chamber and amoreÂ Â» Farmer cylindrical chamber with NIST traceable calibration factors. The dose response of model TLD-100 micro-cubes (1Ã1Ã1 mm{sup 3}) in each beam was measured for five different batches of TLDs (each contained approximately 100 TLDs) that have different histories of irradiation and usage. Relative absorbed dose sensitivity was determined as the quotient of the slope of dose response for a beam-of-interest to that of the reference beam. Results: Equivalent mono-energetic photon energies of the low-energy beams established for 103Pd, 125I and 131Cs sources were 20.5, 27.5, and 30.1 keV, respectively. Each beam exhibited narrow spectral spread with energyhomogeneity index close to 90%. The relative absorbed-dose sensitivity was found to vary between different batches of TLD with maximum differences of up to 8%. The mean and standard deviation determined from the five TLD batches was 1.453 Â± 0.026, 1.541 Â± 0.035 and 1.529 Â± 0.051 for the simulated 103P, 125I and 131Cs beams, respectively. Conclusion: Our measured relative absorbed-dose sensitivities are greater than the historically measured value of 1.41. We find that the relative absorbed-dose sensitivity of TLD in the 103P beam is approximately 5% lower than that of 125I and 131Cs beams.

In the scheme the electron beam is first energy modulated by two lasers with wave numbers k{sub 1} and k2, respectively. After passing through a dispersion section, the energy modulation is converted to density modulation. Due to the nonlinear conversion process, the beam will have density modulation at wave number k = nk{sub 1} + mk{sub 2}, where n and m are positive or negative integers. By properly choosing the parameters for the lasers andmoreÂ Â» dispersion section, one can generate density modulation at THz frequency in the beam using optical lasers. This density-modulated beam can be used to generate powerful narrow-band THz radiation. Since the THz radiation is in tight synchronization with the lasers, it should provide a high temporal resolution for the optical-pump THz-probe experiments. The central frequency of the THz radiation can be easily tuned by varying the wavelength of the two lasers and the energy chirp of the electron beam. The proposed scheme is in principle able to generate intense narrow-band THz radiation covering the whole THz range and offers a promising way towards the tunable intense narrow-band THz sources.Â«Â less\n\nOptical microscope using an interferometric source of two-color, two-beam entangled photons\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDress, William B.; Kisner, Roger A.; Richards, Roger K.\n\n2004-07-13\n\nSystems and methods are described for an optical microscope using an interferometric source of multi-color, multi-beam entangled photons.

In general, photon beam position monitors are developed to detect the real photon beam position, and the position is controlled by a feedback system in order to maintain the reference photon beam position. At Pohang Light Source II, a photon beam position stability of less than 1â Âµm r.m.s. was achieved for a user service period in the beamline, where the photon beam position monitor is installed. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of the photon beam position data was necessary in order to ensure the performance of the photon beam position monitor, since it can suffer from various unknown types of noise, such as background contamination due to upstream or downstream dipole radiation, and undulator gap dependence. This paper reports the results of a start-to-end study of the photon beam position stability and a singular value decomposition analysis to confirm the reliability of the photon beam position data.

A.; Freedman, G.; Ding, M.; Qin, L.; Yang, J.; Ma, C.-M.\n\n2004-05-01\n\nRecently, intensity-modulated radiation therapy and modulated electron radiotherapy have gathered a growing interest for the treatment of breast and head and neck tumours. In this work, we carried out a study to combine electron and photon beams to achieve differential dose distributions for multiple target volumes simultaneously. A Monte Carlo based treatment planning system was investigated, which consists of a set of software tools to perform accurate dose calculation, treatment optimization, leaf sequencing and plan analysis. We compared breast treatment plans generated using this home-grown optimization and dose calculation software for different treatment techniques. Five different planning techniques have been developed for this study based on a standard photon beam whole breast treatment and an electron beam tumour bed cone down. Technique 1 includes two 6 MV tangential wedged photon beams followed by an anterior boost electron field. Technique 2 includes two 6 MV tangential intensity-modulated photon beams and the same boost electron field. Technique 3 optimizes two intensity-modulated photon beams based on a boost electron field. Technique 4 optimizes two intensity-modulated photon beams and the weight of the boost electron field. Technique 5 combines two intensity-modulated photon beams with an intensity-modulated electron field. Our results show that technique 2 can reduce hot spots both in the breast and the tumour bed compared to technique 1 (dose inhomogeneity is reduced from 34% to 28% for the target). Techniques 3, 4 and 5 can deliver a more homogeneous dose distribution to the target (with dose inhomogeneities for the target of 22%, 20% and 9%, respectively). In many cases techniques 3, 4 and 5 can reduce the dose to the lung and heart. It is concluded that combined photon and electron beam therapy may be advantageous for treating breast cancer compared to conventional treatment techniques using tangential wedged photon beams followed by a boost\n\nDifferential pencil beam dose computation model for photons.\n\nPubMed\n\nMohan, R; Chui, C; Lidofsky, L\n\n1986-01-01\n\nDifferential pencil beam (DPB) is defined as the dose distribution relative to the position of the first collision, per unit collision density, for a monoenergetic pencil beam of photons in an infinite homogeneous medium of unit density. We have generated DPB dose distribution tables for a number of photon energies in water using the Monte Carlo method. The three-dimensional (3D) nature of the transport of photons and electrons is automatically incorporated in DPB dose distributions. Dose is computed by evaluating 3D integrals of DPB dose. The DPB dose computation model has been applied to calculate dose distributions for 60Co and accelerator beams. Calculations for the latter are performed using energy spectra generated with the Monte Carlo program. To predict dose distributions near the beam boundaries defined by the collimation system as well as blocks, we utilize the angular distribution of incident photons. Inhomogeneities are taken into account by attenuating the primary photon fluence exponentially utilizing the average total linear attenuation coefficient of intervening tissue, by multiplying photon fluence by the linear attenuation coefficient to yield the number of collisions in the scattering volume, and by scaling the path between the scattering volume element and the computation point by an effective density.\n\nScintillating fiber-based photon beam profiler for the Jefferson Lab tagged photon beam line\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZorn, C.; Barbosa, F.J.; Freyberger, A.\n\n2000-10-01\n\nA scintillating fiber hodoscope has been built for use as a photon beam profiler in the bremsstrahlung tagged photon beam in Hall B of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab).

In these models photons from the accretion disk or the CMB are upscat-tered via the Compton effect by the electrons and contribute to the emission. In previous works the resulting scattered photon angular distribution has been calculated for ultrarelativistic elec-trons. This work aims to extend the result to the case of mildly relativistic electrons. Hence, the beaming pattern produced by a relativistic moving blob consisting of isotropic distributed electrons, which scatter photons of an isotropic external radiation is calculated numerically. The isotropic photon density distribution in the blob frame is Lorentz-transformed into the rest frame of the electron and results in an anisotropic distribution with a preferred direction where it is upscattered by the electrons. The photon density distribution is determined and transformed back into the blob frame. As the photons in the rest frame of the electrons are dis-tributed anisotropically the scattering does not reproduce this anisotropic distribution. When transforming back into the blob frame the resulting photon distribution won't be isotropic. Approximations have shown that the resulting photon distribution is boosted more strongly than a distribution assumed to be isotropic in the rest frame of the electrons. Hence, in order to obtain the beaming caused by external Compton it is of particular interest to derive a more exact approximation of the resulting photon angular distribution.\n\nTerahertz plasmonic laser radiating in an ultra-narrow beam\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nWu, Chongzhao; Khanal, Sudeep; Reno, John L.; ...\n\n2016-07-07\n\nPlasmonic lasers (spasers) generate coherent surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and could be realized at subwavelength dimensions in metallic cavities for applications in nanoscale optics. Plasmonic cavities are also utilized for terahertz quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs), which are the brightest available solid-state sources of terahertz radiation. A long standing challenge for spasers that are utilized as nanoscale sources of radiation, is their poor coupling to the far-field radiation. Unlike conventional lasers that could produce directional beams, spasers have highly divergent radiation patterns due to their subwavelength apertures. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a new technique for implementing distributed feedback (DFB) thatmoreÂ Â» is distinct from any other previously utilized DFB schemes for semiconductor lasers. The so-termed antenna-feedback scheme leads to single-mode operation in plasmonic lasers, couples the resonant SPP mode to a highly directional far-field radiation pattern, and integrates hybrid SPPs in surrounding medium into the operation of the DFB lasers. Experimentally, the antenna-feedback method, which does not require the phase matching to a well-defined effective index, is implemented for terahertz QCLs, and single-mode terahertz QCLs with a beam divergence as small as 4Â°Ã4Â° are demonstrated, which is the narrowest beam reported for any terahertz QCL to date. Moreover, in contrast to a negligible radiative field in conventional photonic band-edge lasers, in which the periodicity follows the integer multiple of half-wavelengths inside the active medium, antenna-feedback breaks this integer limit for the first time and enhances the radiative field of the lasing mode. Terahertz lasers with narrow-beam emission will find applications for integrated as well as standoff terahertz spectroscopy and sensing. Furthermore, the antenna-feedback scheme is generally applicable to any plasmonic laser with a FabryâPerot cavity\n\nSU-E-T-796: Variation of Surface Photon Energy Spectra On Bone Heterogeneity and Beam Obliquity Between Flattened and Unflattened Beam\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChow, J; Owrangi, A; Grigorov, G\n\nPurpose: This study investigates the spectra of surface photon energy and energy fluence in the bone heterogeneity and beam obliquity using flattened and unflattened photon beams. The spectra were calculated in a bone and water phantom using Monte Carlo simulation (the EGSnrc code). Methods: Spectra of energy, energy fluence and mean energy of the 6 MV flattened and unflattened photon beams (field size = 10 Ã 10 cm{sup 2}) produced by a Varian TrueBEAM linear accelerator were calculated at the surfaces of a bone and water phantom using Monte Carlo simulations. The spectral calculations were repeated with the beam anglesmoreÂ Â» turned from 0Â° to 15Â°, 30Â° and 45Â° in the phantoms. Results: It is found that the unflattened photon beams contained more photons in the low-energy range of 0 â 2 MeV than the flattened beams with a flattening filter. Compared to the water phantom, both the flattened and unflattened beams had slightly less photons in the energy range < 0.4 MeV when a bone layer of 1 cm is present under the phantom surface. This shows that the presence of the bone decreased the low-energy photons backscattered to the phantom surface. When the photon beams were rotated from 0Â° to 45Â°, the number of photon and mean photon energy increased with the beam angle. This is because both the flattened and unflattened beams became more hardened when the beam angle increased. With the bone heterogeneity, the mean energies of both photon beams increased correspondingly. This is due to the absorption of low-energy photons by the bone, resulting in more significant beam hardening. Conclusion: The photon spectral information is important in studies on the patientâs surface dose enhancement when using unflattened photon beams in radiotherapy.Â«Â less\n\nSU-F-T-551: Beam Hardening and Attenuation of Photon Beams Using Integral Quality Monitor in Radiotherapy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCasar, B; Carot, I Mendez; Peterlin, P\n\n2016-06-15\n\nPurpose: Aim of the multi-centre study was to analyse beam hardening effect of the Integral Quality Monitor (IQM) for high energy photon beams used in radiotherapy with linear accelerators. Generic values for attenuation coefficient k(IQM) of IQM system were additionally investigated. Methods: Beam hardening effect of the IQM system was studied for a set of standard nominal photon energies (6 MVâ18 MV) and two flattening filter free (FFF) energies (6 MV FFF and 10 MV FFF). PDD curves were measured and analysed for various square radiation fields, with and without IQM in place. Differences between PDD curves were statistically analysedmoreÂ Â» through comparison of respective PDD-20,10 values. Attenuation coefficients k(IQM) were determined for the same range of photon energies. Results: Statistically significant differences in beam qualities for all evaluated high energy photon beams were found, comparing PDD-20,10 values derived from PDD curves with and without IQM in place. Significance of beam hardening effect was statistically proven with high confidence (p < 0,01) for all analysed photon beams except for 15 MV (p = 0,078), although relative differences in beam qualities were minimal, ranging from 0,1 % to 0,5 %. Attenuation of the IQM system showed negligible dependence on radiation field size. However, clinically important dependence of kIQM versus TPRs20,10 was found: 0,941 for 6 MV photon beams, to 0,959 for 18 MV photon beams, with highest uncertainty below 0,006. k(IQM) versus TPRs were tabulated and polynomial equation for the determination of k(IQM) is suggested for clinical use. Conclusion: There was no clinically relevant beam hardening, when IQM system was on linear accelerators. Consequently, no additional commissioning is needed for the IQM system regarding the determination of beam qualities. Generic values for k(IQM) are proposed and can be used as tray factors for complete range of examined photon beam energies.Â«Â less\n\nComparison of PA imaging by narrow beam scanning and one-shot broad beam excitation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXia, Jinjun; Wei, Chen-Wei; Huang, Lingyun; Pelivanov, I. M.; O'Donnell, Matthew\n\n2011-03-01\n\nCurrent systems designed for deep photoacoustic (PA) imaging typically use a low repetition rate, high power pulsed laser to provide a ns-scale pulse illuminating a large tissue volume. Acoustic signals recorded on each laser firing can be used to reconstruct a complete 2-D (3-D) image of sources of heat release within that region. Using broad-beam excitation, the maximum frame rate of the imaging system is restricted by the pulse repetition rate of the laser. An alternate illumination approach is proposed based on fast scanning by a low energy (~ 1 mJ) high repetition rate (up to a few kHz) narrow laser beam (~1 mm) along the tissue surface over a region of interest. A final PA image is produced from the summation of individual PA images reconstructed at each laser beam position. This concept can take advantage of high repetition rate fiber lasers to create PA images with much higher frame rates than current systems, enabling true real-time integration of photoacoustics with ultrasound imaging. As an initial proof of concept, we compare conventional broad beam illumination to a scanned beam approach in a simple model system. Two transparent teflon tubes with diameters of 1.6 mm and 0.8 mm were filled with ink having an absorption coefficient of 5 cm-1. These tubes were buried inside chicken breast tissue acting as an optical scattering medium. They were separated by 3 mm or 10 mm to test spatial and contrast resolution for the two scan formats. The excitation wavelength was 700 nm. The excitation source is a traditional OPO pumped by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with doubler. Photoacoustic images were reconstructed using signals from a small, scanned PVDF transducer acting as an acoustic array. Two different illumination schemes were compared: one was 15 mm x 10 mm in cross section and acted as the broad beam; the other was 5 mm x 2 mm in cross section (15 times smaller than the broad beam case) and was scanned over an area equivalent to broad beam illumination\n\nNarrowing beam-walking is a clinically feasible approach for assessing balance ability in lower-limb prosthesis users.\n\nPubMed\n\nSawers, Andrew; Hafner, Brian J\n\n2018-05-08\n\nChallenging clinical balance tests are needed to expose balance deficits in lower-limb prost-hesis users. This study examined whether narrowing beam-walking could overcome conceptual and practical limitations identified in fixed-width beam-walking. Cross-sectional. Unilateral lower-limb prosthesis users. Participants walked 10 times along a low, narrowing beam. Performance was quantified using the normalized distance walked. Heuristic rules were applied to determine whether the narrowing beam task was \"too easy,\" \"too hard,\" or \"appropriately challenging\" for each participant. Linear regression and Bland-Altman plots were used to determine whether combinations of the first 5 trials could predict participants' stable beam-walking performance. Forty unilateral lower-limb prosthesis users participated. Narrowing beam-walking was appropriately challenging for 98% of participants. Performance stabilized for 93% of participants within 5 trials, while 62% were stable across all trials. The mean of trials 3-5 accurately predicted stable performance. A clinical narrowing beam-walking test is likely to challenge a range of lower-limb prosthesis users, have minimal administrative burden, and exhibit no floor or ceiling effects. Narrowing beam-walking is therefore a clinically viable method to evaluate lower-limb prosthesis users' balance ability, but requires psychometric testing before it is used to assess fall risk.\n\nGeneration of a cylindrically symmetric, polarized laser beam with narrow linewidth and fine tunability\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHirayama, Toru; Kozawa, Yuichi; Nakamura, Takahiro; Sato, Shunichi\n\n2006-12-01\n\nWe demonstrated a generation of cylindrically symmetric, polarized laser beams with narrow linewidth and fine tunability. Since an LP11 mode beam in an optical fiber is a superposition of an HE21 (hybrid) mode beam and a TE01 or TM01 mode beam, firstly, a higher order transverse (TEM01 or TEM10) mode laser beam with narrow linewidth and fine tunability was generated from an external cavity diode laser (ECDL) in conjunction with a phase adjustment plate. Then the beam generated was passed in a two mode optical fiber. A doughnut shaped laser beam with the cylindrically symmetric polarization (a radially or azimuthally polarized beam) was obtained by properly adding stress-induced birefringence in the optical fiber.\n\nPhotonic crystal devices formed by a charged-particle beam\n\nDOEpatents\n\nLin, Shawn-Yu; Koops, Hans W.

We studied the effects of error augmentation on short-term learning of walking on a balance beam to determine whether it had beneficial effects on motor performance. Four groups of able-bodied subjects walked on a treadmill-mounted balance beam (2.5-cm wide) before and after 30Â min of training. During training, two groups walked on the beam with a destabilization device that augmented error (Medium and High Destabilization groups). A third group walked on a narrower beam (1.27-cm) to augment error (Narrow). The fourth group practiced walking on the 2.5-cm balance beam (Wide). Subjects in the Wide group had significantly greater improvements after training than the error augmentation groups. The High Destabilization group had significantly less performance gains than the Narrow group in spite of similar failures per minute during training. In a follow-up experiment, a fifth group of subjects (Assisted) practiced with a device that greatly reduced catastrophic errors (i.e., stepping off the beam) but maintained similar pelvic movement variability. Performance gains were significantly greater in the Wide group than the Assisted group, indicating that catastrophic errors were important for short-term learning. We conclude that increasing errors during practice via destabilization and a narrower balance beam did not improve short-term learning of beam walking. In addition, the presence of qualitatively catastrophic errors seems to improve short-term learning of walking balance.\n\nMethod for shaping and aiming narrow beams. [sonar mapping and target identification\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHeyser, R. C. (Inventor)\n\n1981-01-01\n\nA sonar method and apparatus is discribed which utilizes a linear frequency chirp in a transmitter/receiver having a correlator to synthesize a narrow beamwidth pattern from otherwise broadbeam transducers when there is relative velocity between the transmitter/receiver and the target. The chirp is so produced in a generator in bandwidth, B, and time, T, as to produce a time bandwidth product, TB, that is increased for a narrower angle. A replica of the chirp produced in a generator is time delayed and Doppler shifted for use as a reference in the receiver for correlation of received chirps from targets. This reference is Doppler shifted to select targets preferentially, thereby to not only synthesize a narrow beam but also aim the beam in azimuth and elevation.\n\nDetecting photons in the dark region of Laguerre-Gauss beams.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlimov, Vasily; Bloch, Daniel; Ducloy, Martial; Rios Leite, Jose R\n\n2009-06-08\n\nWe show that a photon detector, sensitive to the magnetic field or to the gradient of electric field, can help to characterize the quantum properties of spatially-dependent optical fields. We discuss the excitation of an atom through magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole transitions with the photons of a Bessel beam or a Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams. These spiral beams are shown to be not true hollow beams, due to the presence of magnetic fields and gradients of electric fields on beam axis. This approach paves the way to an analysis at the quantum level of the propagating light beams having a complicated spatial structure.\n\nSingle photon at a configurable quantum-memory-based beam splitter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuo, Xianxin; Mei, Yefeng; Du, Shengwang\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe report the demonstration of a configurable coherent quantum-memory-based beam splitter (BS) for a single-photon wave packet making use of laser-cooled 85Rb atoms and electromagnetically induced transparency. The single-photon wave packet is converted (stored) into a collective atomic spin state and later retrieved (split) into two nearly opposing directions. The storage time, beam-splitting ratio, and relative phase are configurable and can be dynamically controlled. We experimentally confirm that such a BS preserves the quantum particle nature of the single photon and the coherence between the two split wave packets of the single photon.\n\nTerahertz plasmonic lasers with narrow beams and large tunability\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJin, Yuan; Wu, Chongzhao; Reno, John L.; Kumar, Sushil\n\n2017-02-01\n\nPlasmonic lasers generate coherent long-range or localized surface-plasmon-polaritons (SPPs), where the SPP mode exists at the interface of the metal (or a metallic nanoparticle) and a dielectric. Metallic-cavities sup- porting SPP modes are also utilized for terahertz quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs). Due to subwavelength apertures, plasmonic lasers have highly divergent radiation patterns. Recently, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrated a new technique for implementing distributed-feedback (DFB), which is termed as an antenna- feedback scheme, to establish a hybrid SPP mode in the surrounding medium of a plasmonic laser's cavity with a large wavefront. This technique allows such lasers to radiate in narrow beams without requirement of any specific design considerations for phase-matching. Experimental demonstration is done for terahertz QCLs that show beam-divergence as small as 4-degrees. The antenna-feedback scheme has a characteristic feature in that refractive-index of the laser's surrounding medium affects its radiative frequency in the same vein as refractive- index of the cavity. Hence, any perturbations in the refractive-index of the surrounding medium could lead to large modulation in the laser's emission frequency. Along this line, we report 57 GHz reversible, continuous, and mode-hop-free tuning of such QCLs operating at 78 K based on post-process deposition/etching of a dielectric on an already mounted QCL chip. This is the largest tuning range achieved for terahertz QCLs when operating much above the temperature of liquid-Helium. We review the aforementioned experimental results and discuss methods to increase optical power output from terahertz QCLs with antenna-feedback. Peak power output of 13 mW is realized for a 3.3 THz QCL operating in a Stirling cooler at 54 K. A new dual-slit photonic structure based on antenna-feedback scheme is proposed to further improve output power as well as provide enhanced tunability.\n\nHighly integrated optical phased arrays: photonic integrated circuits for optical beam shaping and beam steering\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHeck, Martijn J. R.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTechnologies for efficient generation and fast scanning of narrow free-space laser beams find major applications in three-dimensional (3D) imaging and mapping, like Lidar for remote sensing and navigation, and secure free-space optical communications. The ultimate goal for such a system is to reduce its size, weight, and power consumption, so that it can be mounted on, e.g. drones and autonomous cars. Moreover, beam scanning should ideally be done at video frame rates, something that is beyond the capabilities of current opto-mechanical systems. Photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology holds the promise of achieving low-cost, compact, robust and energy-efficient complex optical systems. PICs integrate, for example, lasers, modulators, detectors, and filters on a single piece of semiconductor, typically silicon or indium phosphide, much like electronic integrated circuits. This technology is maturing fast, driven by high-bandwidth communications applications, and mature fabrication facilities. State-of-the-art commercial PICs integrate hundreds of elements, and the integration of thousands of elements has been shown in the laboratory. Over the last few years, there has been a considerable research effort to integrate beam steering systems on a PIC, and various beam steering demonstrators based on optical phased arrays have been realized. Arrays of up to thousands of coherent emitters, including their phase and amplitude control, have been integrated, and various applications have been explored. In this review paper, I will present an overview of the state of the art of this technology and its opportunities, illustrated by recent breakthroughs.\n\nInvestigation of photon beam models in heterogeneous media of modern radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nDing, W; Johnston, P N; Wong, T P Y; Bubb, I F\n\n2004-06-01\n\nThis study investigates the performance of photon beam models in dose calculations involving heterogeneous media in modern radiotherapy. Three dose calculation algorithms implemented in the CMS FOCUS treatment planning system have been assessed and validated using ionization chambers, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and film. The algorithms include the multigrid superposition (MGS) algorithm, fast Fourier Transform Convolution (FFTC) algorithm and Clarkson algorithm. Heterogeneous phantoms used in the study consist of air cavities, lung analogue and an anthropomorphic phantom. Depth dose distributions along the central beam axis for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams with field sizes of 5 cm x 5 cm and 10 cm x 10 cm were measured in the air cavity phantoms and lung analogue phantom. Point dose measurements were performed in the anthropomorphic phantom. Calculated results with three dose calculation algorithms were compared with measured results. In the air cavity phantoms, the maximum dose differences between the algorithms and the measurements were found at the distal surface of the air cavity with a 10 MV photon beam and a 5 cm x 5 cm field size. The differences were 3.8%. 24.9% and 27.7% for the MGS. FFTC and Clarkson algorithms. respectively. Experimental measurements of secondary electron build-up range beyond the air cavity showed an increase with decreasing field size, increasing energy and increasing air cavity thickness.

FFTC and Clarkson algorithms with a 6 MV photon beam and 0.4%. 6.3% and 9.1% with a 10 MV photon beam, respectively. In the anthropomorphic phantom, the dose differences between calculations using the MGS algorithm and measurements with TLD rods were less than +/-4.5% for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams with 10 cm x 10 cm field size and 6 MV photon beam with 5 cm x 5 cm field size, and within +/-7.5% for 10 MV with 5 cm\n\nEffects of physical guidance on short-term learning of walking on a narrow beam\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDomingo, Antoinette; Ferris, Daniel P.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nPhysical guidance is often used in rehabilitation when teaching patients to re-learn movements. However, the effects of guidance on motor learning of complex skills, such as walking balance, are not clear. We tested four groups of healthy subjects that practiced walking on a narrow (1.27 cm) or wide (2.5 cm) treadmill-mounted balance beam, with or without physical guidance. Assistance was given by springs attached to a hip belt that applied restoring forces towards beam center. Subjects were evaluated while walking unassisted before and after training by calculating the number of times subjects stepped off of the beam per minute of successful walking on the beam (Failures per Minute). Subjects in Unassisted groups had greater performance improvements in walking balance from pre to post compared to subjects in Assisted groups. During training, Unassisted groups had more Failures per Minute than Assisted groups. Performance improvements were smaller in Narrow Beam groups than in Wide Beam groups. The Unassisted-Wide and Assisted-Narrow groups had similar Failures per Minute during training, but the Unassisted-Wide group had much greater performance gains after training. These results suggest that physical assistance can hinder motor learning of walking balance, assistance appears less detrimental for more difficult tasks, and task-specific dynamics are important to learning independent of error experience.

During training, Unassisted groups had more Failures per Minute than Assisted groups. Performance improvements were smaller in Narrow Beam groups than in Wide Beam groups. The Unassisted-Wide and Assisted-Narrow groups had similar Failures per Minute during training, but the Unassisted-Wide group had much greater performance gains after training. These results suggest that physical assistance can hinder motor learning of walking balance, assistance appears less detrimental for more difficult tasks, and task-specific dynamics are important to learning independent of error experience.\n\nMagnetic field influences on the lateral dose response functions of photon-beam detectors: MC study of wall-less water-filled detectors with various densities.\n\nPubMed\n\nLooe, Hui Khee; Delfs, BjÃ¶rn; Poppinga, Daniela; Harder, Dietrich; Poppe, BjÃ¶rn\n\n2017-06-21\n\nThe distortion of detector reading profiles across photon beams in the presence of magnetic fields is a developing subject of clinical photon-beam dosimetry. The underlying modification by the Lorentz force of a detector's lateral dose response function-the convolution kernel transforming the true cross-beam dose profile in water into the detector reading profile-is here studied for the first time. The three basic convolution kernels, the photon fluence response function, the dose deposition kernel, and the lateral dose response function, of wall-less cylindrical detectors filled with water of low, normal and enhanced density are shown by Monte Carlo simulation to be distorted in the prevailing direction of the Lorentz force. The asymmetric shape changes of these convolution kernels in a water medium and in magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T are confined to the lower millimetre range, and they depend on the photon beam quality, the magnetic flux density and the detector's density. The impact of this distortion on detector reading profiles is demonstrated using a narrow photon beam profile. For clinical applications it appears as favourable that the magnetic flux density dependent distortion of the lateral dose response function, as far as secondary electron transport is concerned, vanishes in the case of water-equivalent detectors of normal water density. By means of secondary electron history backtracing, the spatial distribution of the photon interactions giving rise either directly to secondary electrons or to scattered photons further downstream producing secondary electrons which contribute to the detector's signal, and their lateral shift due to the Lorentz force is elucidated. Electron history backtracing also serves to illustrate the correct treatment of the influences of the Lorentz force in the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code applied in this study.\n\nAn empirical model of diagnostic x-ray attenuation under narrow-beam geometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nMathieu, Kelsey B; Kappadath, S Cheenu; White, R Allen; Atkinson, E Neely; Cody, Dianna D\n\n2011-08-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to develop and validate a mathematical model to describe narrow-beam attenuation of kilovoltage x-ray beams for the intended applications of half-value layer (HVL) and quarter-value layer (QVL) estimations, patient organ shielding, and computer modeling. An empirical model, which uses the Lambert W function and represents a generalized Lambert-Beer law, was developed. To validate this model, transmission of diagnostic energy x-ray beams was measured over a wide range of attenuator thicknesses [0.49-33.03 mm Al on a computed tomography (CT) scanner, 0.09-1.93 mm Al on two mammography systems, and 0.1-0.45 mm Cu and 0.49-14.87 mm Al using general radiography]. Exposure measurements were acquired under narrow-beam geometry using standard methods, including the appropriate ionization chamber, for each radiographic system. Nonlinear regression was used to find the best-fit curve of the proposed Lambert W model to each measured transmission versus attenuator thickness data set. In addition to validating the Lambert W model, we also assessed the performance of two-point Lambert W interpolation compared to traditional methods for estimating the HVL and QVL [i.e., semi-logarithmic (exponential) and linear interpolation]. The Lambert W model was validated for modeling attenuation versus attenuator thickness with respect to the data collected in this study (R2 > 0.99). Furthermore, Lambert W interpolation was more accurate and less sensitive to the choice of interpolation points used to estimate the HVL and/or QVL than the traditional methods of semilogarithmic and linear interpolation. The proposed Lambert W model accurately describes attenuation of both monoenergetic radiation and (kilovoltage) polyenergetic beams (under narrow-beam geometry).\n\nAn empirical model of diagnostic x-ray attenuation under narrow-beam geometry\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMathieu, Kelsey B.; Kappadath, S.

Both numerical and experimental results show that the valley degeneracy in the photonic graphene is broken when the frequency is away from the Dirac point. The peculiar anisotropic wave transport property due to distinct valleys is analyzed using the equifrequency contours. More interestingly, the valley-dependent self-collimation and beam splitting phenomena are experimentally demonstrated with the armchair and zigzag interfaces, respectively. Our results confirm that there are two inequivalent Dirac points that lead to two distinct valleys in photonic graphene, which could be used to control the flow of light and might be used to carry information in valley polarized beam splitter, collimator or guiding device.\n\nSU-F-T-360: Dosimetric Impacts On the Mucosa and Bone in Radiotherapy with Unflattened Photon Beams\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChow, J; Owrangi, A\n\nPurpose: This study investigated the dosimetric impacts on the mucosa and bone when using the unflattened photon beams in radiotherapy. Dose calculations were carried out by Monte Carlo simulation. Methods: Heterogeneous phantoms containing water (soft tissue and mucosa), air and bone, with mucosa thicknesses varying from 0.5 â 3 mm were irradiated by the 6 MV unflattened and flattened photon beams (field size = 10 Ã 10 cm{sup 2}), produced by a Varian TrueBEAM linear accelerator. The photon energy spectra of the beams, mean bone and mucosal doses with different mucosa thicknesses were calculated using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code.moreÂ Â» Results: It is found that the flattened photon beams had higher mean bone doses (1.3% and 2% for upper and lower bone regarding the phantom geometry, respectively) than the unflattened beams, and the mean bone doses of both beams did not vary significantly with the mucosa thickness. Similarly, flattened photon beams had higher mucosal dose (0.9% and 1.6% for upper and lower mucosa, respectively) than the unflattened beams. This is due to the larger slope of the depth dose for the unflattened photon beams compared to the flattened. The mucosal doses of both beams were found increased with the mucosa thickness. Moreover, the mucosal dose differences between the unflattened and flattened beams increased with the mucosa thickness. For photon energy spectra on the mucosal layers, it is found that the unflattened photon beams contained a larger portion of lowenergy photons than the flattened beams. The photon energy spectra did not change significantly with the mucosa thickness. Conclusion: It is concluded that the mucosal and bone dose for the unflattened photon beams were not more than 2% lower than the flattened beams, though the flattening filter free beams contained larger portion of low-energy photons than the flattened beams.Â«Â less\n\nPhotonic guiding structures in lithium niobate crystals produced by energetic ion beams\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Feng\n\n2009-10-01\n\nA range of ion beam techniques have been used to fabricate a variety of photonic guiding structures in the well-known lithium niobate (LiNbO3 or LN) crystals that are of great importance in integrated photonics/optics. This paper reviews the up-to-date research progress of ion-beam-processed LiNbO3 photonic structures and reports on their fabrication, characterization, and applications. Ion beams are being used with this material in a wide range of techniques, as exemplified by the following examples. Ion beam milling/etching can remove the selected surface regions of LiNbO3 crystals via the sputtering effects. Ion implantation and swift ion irradiation can form optical waveguide structures by modifying the surface refractive indices of the LiNbO3 wafers. Crystal ion slicing has been used to obtain bulk-quality LiNbO3 single-crystalline thin films or membranes by exfoliating the implanted layer from the original substrate. Focused ion beams can either generate small structures of micron or submicron dimensions, to realize photonic bandgap crystals in LiNbO3, or directly write surface waveguides or other guiding devices in the crystal. Ion beam-enhanced etching has been extensively applied for micro- or nanostructuring of LiNbO3 surfaces. Methods developed to fabricate a range of photonic guiding structures in LiNbO3 are introduced. Modifications of LiNbO3 through the use of various energetic ion beams, including changes in refractive index and properties related to the photonic guiding structures as well as to the materials (i.e., electro-optic, nonlinear optic, luminescent, and photorefractive features), are overviewed in detail. The application of these LiNbO3 photonic guiding structures in both micro- and nanophotonics are briefly summarized.\n\nOn the effective point of measurement in megavoltage photon beams.\n\nPubMed\n\nKawrakow, Iwan\n\n2006-06-01\n\nThis paper presents a numerical investigation of the effective point of measurement of thimble ionization chambers in megavoltage photon beams using Monte Carlo simulations with the EGSNRC system. It is shown that the effective point of measurement for relative photon beam dosimetry depends on every detail of the chamber design, including the cavity length, the mass density of the wall material, and the size of the central electrode, in addition to the cavity radius. Moreover, the effective point of measurement also depends on the beam quality and the field size. The paper therefore argues that the upstream shift of 0.6 times the cavity radius, recommended in current dosimetry protocols, is inadequate for accurate relative photon beam dosimetry, particularly in the build-up region. On the other hand, once the effective point of measurement is selected appropriately, measured depth-ionization curves can be equated to measured depth-dose curves for all depths within +/- 0.5%.\n\nUltra-compact laser beam steering device using holographically formed two dimensional photonic crystal.\n\nPubMed\n\nDou, Xinyuan; Chen, Xiaonan; Chen, Maggie Yihong; Wang, Alan Xiaolong; Jiang, Wei; Chen, Ray T\n\n2010-03-01\n\nIn this paper, we report the theoretical study of polymer-based photonic crystals for laser beam steering which is based on the superprism effect as well as the experiment fabrication of the two dimensional photonic crystals for the laser beam steering. Superprism effect, the principle for beam steering, was separately studied in details through EFC (Equifrequency Contour) analysis. Polymer based photonic crystals were fabricated through double exposure holographic interference method using SU8-2007. The experiment results showed a beam steering angle of 10 degree for 30 nm wavelength variation.\n\nClinical implementation of photon beam flatness measurements to verify beam quality.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoodall, Simon; Harding, Nicholas; Simpson, Jake; Alexander, Louise; Morgan, Steve\n\n2015-11-08\n\nThis work describes the replacement of Tissue Phantom Ratio (TPR) measurements with beam profile flatness measurements to determine photon beam quality during routine quality assurance (QA) measurements. To achieve this, a relationship was derived between the existing TPR15/5 energy metric and beam flatness, to provide baseline values and clinically relevant tolerances. The beam quality was varied around two nominal beam energy values for four matched Elekta linear accelerators (linacs) by varying the bending magnet currents and reoptimizing the beam. For each adjusted beam quality the TPR15/5 was measured using an ionization chamber and Solid Water phantom. Two metrics of beam flatness were evaluated using two identical commercial ionization chamber arrays. A linear relationship was found between TPR15/5 and both metrics of flatness, for both nominal energies and on all linacs. Baseline diagonal flatness (FDN) values were measured to be 103.0% (ranging from 102.5% to 103.8%) for 6 MV and 102.7% (ranging from 102.6% to 102.8%) for 10 MV across all four linacs. Clinically acceptable tolerances of Â± 2% for 6 MV, and Â± 3% for 10 MV, were derived to equate to the current TPR15/5 clinical tolerance of Â± 0.5%. Small variations in the baseline diagonal flatness values were observed between ionization chamber arrays; however, the rate of change of TPR15/5 with diagonal flatness was found to remain within experimental uncertainty. Measurements of beam flatness were shown to display an increased sensitivity to variations in the beam quality when compared to TPR measurements. This effect is amplified for higher nominal energy photons. The derivation of clinical baselines and associated tolerances has allowed this method to be incorporated into routine QA, streamlining the process whilst also increasing versatility. In addition, the effect of beam adjustment can be observed in real time, allowing increased practicality during corrective and preventive maintenance\n\nUltrabright narrow-band telecom two-photon source for long-distance quantum communication\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNiizeki, Kazuya; Ikeda, Kohei; Zheng, Mingyang; Xie, Xiuping; Okamura, Kotaro; Takei, Nobuyuki; Namekata, Naoto; Inoue, Shuichiro; Kosaka, Hideo; Horikiri, Tomoyuki\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe demonstrate an ultrabright narrow-band two-photon source at the 1.5 Âµm telecom wavelength for long-distance quantum communication. By utilizing a bow-tie cavity, we obtain a cavity enhancement factor of 4.06 Ã 104. Our measurement of the second-order correlation function G (2)(Ï) reveals that the linewidth of 2.4 MHz has been hitherto unachieved in the 1.5 Âµm telecom band. This two-photon source is useful for obtaining a high absorption probability close to unity by quantum memories set inside quantum repeater nodes. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the observed spectral brightness of 3.94 Ã 105 pairs/(sÂ·MHzÂ·mW) is also the highest reported over all wavelengths.\n\nPlastic scintillator block as photon beam monitor for EGRET calibration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLin, Y.

B.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe EGRET (Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope) detector has been calibrated at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator) and, to a lesser degree, at the MIT Bates Linear Accelerator Center. To monitor the photon beams for the calibration, a plastic scintillator block, 5 cm x 5 cm in cross section, 15 cm in length, and viewed by a single photomultiplier tube, was used for the entire beam energy range of 15 MeV to 10 GeV. The design operation, and method of analysis of the beam intensity are presented. A mathematical framework has been developed to treat the general case of a beam with multiphoton beam pulses and with a background component. A procedure to deal with the fluctuations of the beam intensity over a data-taking period was also developed. The photon beam monitor is physically sturdy, electronically steady, simple to construct, and easy to operate. Its major merits lie in its sheer simplicity of construction and operation and in the wide energy range it can cover.\n\nSU-F-T-425: Head-Scatter Off-Axis for FFF Megavoltage Photon Beams\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZhu, T; Penjweini, R; Dimofte, A\n\nPurpose: Head-scatter photons inside a clinical accelerator cause the output to change with collimator setting. On the central-axis, this contribution is well-described by output factor in air (or head-scatter factor). However, a few studies have examined this component at off-axis points. Methods: We define the head-scatter off-axis ratio, HOA, as the ratio of the water kerma in air due to head-scatter photons at the off-axis position x to the water kerma from direct primary photons on the central axis: HOA(cx,cy,xy) = (Q(cx,cy,x) â QP(cx,cy,x))/QP(cx,cy,0), where Q(cx, cy,x), QP(cx,cy,x) are charges measured by an ionization chamber in a miniphantom for collimatormoreÂ Â» setting cx Ã cy and cx Ã 3 cm, respectively, at off-axis point x. âDirect primaryâ is those photons that come from the source without interactions in the intervening structures. Results: We measured HOA for two energies (6XFFF and 6X) along X and Y jaw directions for various collimator settings. The shape of HOA has well defined penumbra for collimator setting larger than 10 Ã 10 cm2. Conclusion: The narrow gaussian component is interpreted as the source of photons scattered in the flattening filter and the primary collimator. The broad component is attributed to photons scattered in the secondary (variable) collimators. By a direct comparison between 6X and 6XFFF beams, we can confirm that the second component is indeed coming from collimator jaws and identify the parts coming from the primary collimator and the flattening filter, respectively.Â«Â less\n\nPackaging consideration of two-dimensional polymer-based photonic crystals for laser beam steering\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDou, Xinyuan; Chen, Xiaonan; Chen, Maggie Yihong; Wang, Alan Xiaolong; Jiang, Wei; Chen, Ray T.\n\n2009-02-01\n\nIn this paper, we report the theoretical study of polymer-based photonic crystals for laser beam steering which is based on the superprism effect as well as the experiment fabrication of the two dimensional photonic crystals for the laser beam steering.

In this study, narrow-banded beams of light within the visible light spectrum were used to explore their ability in improving the visibility of external injuries. The beams of light were induced by four crime-lites(Â®) providing narrow-banded beams of light between 400 and 550Â nm. The visibility of the injuries was assessed through specific long-pass filters supplied with the set of crime-lites(Â®) . Forty-three percent of the examined injuries improved in visibility by using the narrow-banded visible light. In addition, injuries were visualized that were not visible or just barely visible to the naked eye. The improvements in visibility were particularly marked with the use of crime-lites(Â®) \"violet\" and \"blue\" covering the spectrum between 400-430 and 430-470Â nm. The simple noninvasive method showed a great potential contribution in injury examination.

In this paper, the beam quality of orthogonal bremsstrahlung beams defined as the 90 degrees component of the bremsstrahlung distribution produced from megavoltage electron pencil beams striking various targets is presented, and the suitability of their use for improved radiotherapy imaging is evaluated. A 10 MeV electron beam emerging through the research port of a Varian Clinac-18 linac was made to strike targets of carbon, aluminum, and copper. PDD and attenuation measurements of both the forward and orthogonal beams were carried out, and the results were also used to estimate the effective and mean energy of the beams. The mean energy of a spectrum produced by a carbon target dropped by 83% from 1296 keV in the forward direction to 217 keV in the orthogonal direction, while for an aluminum target it dropped by 77% to 412 keV, and for a copper target by 65% to 793 keV. An in-depth Monte Carlo study of photon yield and electron contamination was also performed. Photon yield and effective energy are lower for orthogonal beams than for forward beams, and the differences are more pronounced for targets of lower atomic number. Using their relatively low effective energy, orthogonal bremsstrahlung beams produced by megavoltage electrons striking low atomic number targets yield images with a higher contrast in comparison with forward bremsstrahlung beams.\n\nThe physics of small megavoltage photon beam dosimetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndreo, Pedro\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe increased interest during recent years in the use of small megavoltage photon beams in advanced radiotherapy techniques has led to the development of dosimetry recommendations by different national and international organizations. Their requirement of data suitable for the different clinical options available, regarding treatment units and dosimetry equipment, has generated a considerable amount of research by the scientific community during the last decade. The multiple publications in the field have led not only to the availability of new invaluable data, but have also contributed substantially to an improved understanding of the physics of their dosimetry.

Methods: A high-sensitivity, intensified CCD camera (ICCD) was configured to acquire 2D projection images of Cerenkov emission from a 4 Multiplication-Sign 4 cm{sup 2} 6 MV linear accelerator (LINAC) x-ray photon beam operating at a dose rate of 400 MU/min incident on a water tank with transparent walls. The ICCD acquisition was gated to the LINAC sync pulse to reduce background lightmoreÂ Â» artifacts, and the measurement quality was investigated by evaluating the signal to noise ratio and measurement repeatability as a function of delivered dose. Monte Carlo simulations were used to derive a calibration factor for differences between the optical images and deposited dose arising from the anisotropic angular dependence of Cerenkov emission. Finally, Cerenkov-based beam profiles were compared to a percent depth dose (PDD) and lateral dose profile at a depth of d{sub max} from a reference dose distribution generated from the clinical Varian ECLIPSE treatment planning system (TPS). Results: The signal to noise ratio was found to be 20 at a delivered dose of 66.6 cGy, and proportional to the square root of the delivered dose as expected from Poisson photon counting statistics. A 2.1% mean standard deviation and 5.6% maximum variation in successive measurements were observed, and the Monte Carlo derived calibration factor resulted in Cerenkov emission images which were directly correlated to deposited dose, with some spatial issues. The dose difference between the TPS and PDD predicted by Cerenkov measurements was within 20% in the buildup region with a distance to agreement (DTA) of 1.5-2 mm and {+-}3% at depths beyond d{sub max}. In the lateral profile, the dose difference at the beam penumbra was within {+-}13% with a DTA of 0\n\nNarrow linewidth operation of a spectral beam combined diode laser bar.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Zhanda; Jiang, Menghua; Cheng, Siqi; Hui, Yongling; Lei, Hong; Li, Qiang\n\n2016-04-20\n\nOur experiment is expected to provide an approach for realizing ultranarrow linewidth for a spectral beam combined diode laser bar. The beams of a diode laser bar are combined in a fast axis after a beam transformation system. With the help of relay optics and a transform lens with a long focal length of 1.5Â m, the whole wavelength of a spectral combined laser bar can be narrowed down to 0.48Â nm from more than 10Â nm. We have achieved 56.7Â W cw from a 19-element single bar with an M2 of 1.4ââ(in horizontal direction)Ã11.6ââ(in vertical direction). These parameters are good evidence that all the beams from the diode laser bar are combined together to increase the brightness.\n\nImproving the trapping capability using radially polarized narrow-width annular beam\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Hua-Feng; Zhang, Wei-Jun; Qu, Jun; Huang, Wei\n\n2016-03-01\n\nA novel optical-trap method for improving the trapping capability using a radially polarized narrow-width annular beam (NWAB) has been proposed. In this paper, we theoretically study the tight focusing properties of a radially polarized NWAB, formed by subtly blocking the central portion of a radially polarized Bessel-Gaussian beam (the original doughnut beam), through a high-numerical aperture objective. It is shown that a sub-wavelength focal spot (?) with a quite long depth of focus (about ?) can be formed in the vicinity of the focus. Furthermore, the optical trapping forces acting on a metallic Rayleigh particle are calculated for the case where a radially polarized annular beam is applied. Numerical results show that the radially polarized NWAB can largely enhance the transverse trap stiffness and broaden the longitudinal trap range compared with the usage of the original doughnut beam. The influence of the annular factor Î´ on the focusing properties and the trap stiffness is investigated in detail.\n\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR: Green emission and bandgap narrowing due to two-photon excitation in thin film CdS formed by spray pyrolysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUllrich, B.; Schroeder, R.\n\n2001-08-01\n\nThin (10 Âµm) film CdS on PyrexÂ® formed by spray pyrolysis is excited below the gap at 804 nm with 200 fs laser pulses at room temperature. Excitation intensities up to 250 GW cm-2 evoke green bandgap emission due to two-photon transitions. This two-photon photoluminescence does not show a red emission contribution in contrast to the single-photon excited emission, which is dominated by broad emission in the red spectral range. It is demonstrated that two-photon excitation causes photo-induced bandgap narrowing due to Debye screening. At 250 GW cm-2 bandgap narrowing of 47 meV is observed, which corresponds to an excited electron density of 1.6Ã1018 cm-3.\n\nMatching extended-SSD electron beams to multileaf collimated photon beams in the treatment of head and neck cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nSteel, Jared; Stewart, Allan; Satory, Philip\n\n2009-09-01\n\nMatching the penumbra of a 6 MeV electron beam to the penumbra of a 6 MV photon beam is a dose optimization challenge, especially when the electron beam is applied from an extended source-to-surface distance (SSD), as in the case of some head and neck treatments. Traditionally low melting point alloy blocks have been used to define the photon beam shielding over the spinal cord region. However, these are inherently time consuming to construct and employ in the clinical situation."
