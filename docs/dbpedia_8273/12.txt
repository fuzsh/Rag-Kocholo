Film Synopsis

The toothy, blonde Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) visits a girlfriend in London in the hopes of scoring an exclusive interview with a celebrity for her college newspaper back in America. At a magic show, of all places, she finds herself volunteering to be rendered invisible by a hokey magician (Woody Allen).

Alone in the magic box, a ghost seizes the opportunity to appear before her and give her the name of London's infamous Tarot Card Killer, a serial killer currently dodging the local police.

What follows is comic farce as Pransky and her newfound magician friend follow the trail in the hopes that she can get her first big scoop.
