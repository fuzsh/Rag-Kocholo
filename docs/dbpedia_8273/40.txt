Woody Allen has made some great films and he’s made some stinkers, but he is a man who consistently cranks films out year after year. In 2006, his film “Scoop” happened to have a stage magician in it and, because of that, we felt it was important to include in our series about films made about stage magic in 2006. But paired with the other two films in this series — “The Prestige” and “The Illusionist,” this film falls flat. But that doesn’t mean we don’t have a great time talking about it. Join us — Pete Wright and Andy Nelson — as we wrap up our magic series with one of Allen’s worst films, “Scoop.” We talk about the magic, the murder mystery and the comedy in this film and how none of them particularly stand out. We discuss the actors — Scarlett Johansson, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane and Woody Allen in particular — and what, if anything, they bring to their roles. And we chat about what works in Allen’s films and why this film feels so slight and forgettable. It’s not one of our favorites, but we still have a great conversation about it. Tune in!
