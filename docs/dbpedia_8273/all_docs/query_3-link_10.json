        "text": "Rufus Sewell plays Prince Andrew\n\nRufus Sewell is best known for films including \"The Holiday\" and \"Old,\" as well as Amazon's \"The Marvelous Ms. Maisel.\"\n\nDuring a Netflix event in London that Business Insider attended, Sewell said he prepared for the role by watching old footage of Andrew to get a better understanding of his life outside the controversy.\n\n\"I watched a lot of footage of him when he was younger and him at his best, you know, because one of the temptations is to avoid anything that seems to show the good lights or, you know... it's quite a responsibility,\" Sewell said.\n\nLike most working members of the British royal family, Prince Andrew used to receive an income from the Sovereign Grant — which the UK government gives them. In 2019 it totaled £82.2 million, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHe was also given some money from the Duchy of Lancaster, which is a collection of properties owned by the family that generates money.\n\nBuckingham Palace stopped providing financial data about specific royals in 2010, but The Guardian estimated in 2023 that Andrew had received around £12.9 million from the Duchy over a 40-year period. However, it's not known whether those payments have continued since he stepped down from his duties in 2019.\n\nBillie Piper plays Sam McAlister\n\n\"Doctor Who\" star Billie Piper plays Sam McAlister, the \"Newsnight\" producer behind the interview with Andrew.\n\nThe film details how McAlister negotiated with the palace for a year to get the interview, which was originally going to focus on Andrew's charity work, but pivoted following his arrest in July 2019.\n\nAt the London Netflix event, McAlister praised the film for adding new dimensions to the interview. She said: \"There were definitely perspectives that you hadn't had before.\"\n\nThe film is taken from McAlister's book, \"Scoops: Behind the Scenes of the BBC's Most Shocking Interviews,\" which she wrote after the interview with Prince Andrew.\n\nGillian Anderson plays Emily Maitlis.\n\n\"The X-Files\" star Gillian Anderson played journalist Emily Maitlis, the journalist who interviewed the prince on camera.\n\nMaitlis had the job of grilling Andrew about his friendship with Epstein, and she pushed him to respond to the allegations from Virginia Roberts Giuffre that the he paid her for sex when she was 17 years old.\n\nThe journalist told Deadline that she tried not to get too involved with \"Scoop,\" although she is an executive producer on the film.\n\n\"I've left them very much to do their own thing because I think the last thing they want is me peeking around the edges offering my [views],\" she said."
