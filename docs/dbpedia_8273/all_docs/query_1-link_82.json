        "text": "THE infamous Prince Andrew Newsnight interview is being brought to life by Netflix.\n\nBut film fans may wonder who plays the Duke of York in the new gripping movie, Scoop.\n\nWho plays Prince Andrew in Scoop?\n\nNetflix's Scoop is inspired by real events of the tenacious journalism that landed Prince Andrew's earth-shattering Newsnight interview.\n\nFrom producer Sam McAlister’s high stakes negotiations with Buckingham Palace, all the way to Emily Maitlis’ showdown with the Duke of York, the film tells the inside story.\n\nThe sensational 2019 interview saw the royal open up about his relationship with disgraced financier and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who went on trial in the same year on sex trafficking charges.\n\nPlaying Prince Andrew is esteemed actor Rufus Sewell.\n\nBorn in London on October 29, 1967, the star is known on both the big and small screen.\n\nRufus grew up around creativity as his mum was an artist and his father was an animator who even worked on The Beatles movie Yellow Submarine.\n\nAfter learning his craft at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London in the late 80s, he was set up with an agent by Dame Judi Dench.\n\nRufus' breakthrough role was in 1993 when he played Tim in Michael Winner's film Dirty Weekend.\n\nIs Rufus Sewell married and does he have children?\n\nIn December 2023, Rufus Sewell got engaged to girlfriend Vivian Benitez – who is 30 years his junior.\n\nThe couple announced the news by posting two photographs of her wearing a huge sparkler on her left finger on Instagram, with one of the images also showing Rufus kissing her on the cheek.\n\nThe actor has been dating Vivian since 2021 and the pair have largely stayed out of the public eye throughout their relationship.\n\nWhen they finally marry, Rufus will be walking down the aisle for the third time.\n\nRufus first tied the knot with longtime girlfriend Yasmin Abdallah in 1999, but they divorced the following year.\n\nFour years later, he married Amy Gardner and together they had a son called William before divorcing in 2006.\n\nRufus also has daughter Lola with his ex-girlfriend Ami Komai.\n\nWhat has Rufus Sewell starred in?\n\nOver on the big screen, Rufus is known for his villainous film roles, including A Knight's Tale, The Legend Of Zorro, Bless The Child, Helen Of Troy, and The Illusionist.\n\nBut he is perhaps best known for playing Kate Winslet's scoundrel ex-boyfriend in the famous Christmas movie, The Holiday.\n\nI just became obsessed with watching the interview and watching him - and even on my own, I would dress up as him.\n\nRufus Sewell on playing Prince Andrew in Scoop\n\nRufus has enjoyed great success on TV, and most notably starred in the Netflix smash hit series The Diplomat.\n\nHe also played the role of Lord Melbourne in ITV's period drama, Victoria.\n\nThe series depicted the life of Queen Victoria, with Jenna Coleman taking the lead role.\n\nWhat has Rufus Sewell said about Scoop?\n\nRufus revealed he obsessively watched footage of Prince Andrew, and even dressed up as the Duke of York home, in order to get to grips with his role in Scoop.\n\nSpeaking on Next On Netflix about how he learnt to mimic the Prince, Rufus said: \"It wasn't an easy yes, but I read the script, and it was so extraordinary that I found that I kind of needed to do it.\n\n\"But, I didn't actually say yes until I'd worked on it on my own for a while, which is not something I'd normally do before a part.\n\n\"I had an instinct about playing him, and I have a good ear with accents, but not that natural ability to mimic.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I just became obsessed with watching the interview and watching him - and even on my own, I would dress up as him.\n\n\"I won't tell you how I'd dress up, but what I mean is - I would put on clothes that felt like I could believe the idea of myself [being him].\n\n\"When people would catch me doing it, it was really embarrassing.\""
