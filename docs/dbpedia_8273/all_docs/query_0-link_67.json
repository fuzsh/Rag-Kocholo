        "text": "The post Jack Black Promises Tenacious D “Will Be Back” appeared first on Consequence.\n\nWe have not heard the last from Tenacious D.\n\nDuring the red carpet premiere of Borderlands on Tuesday, Jack Black was asked about the band’s status following bandmate Kyle Gass’s joke about an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, which led Black to cancel the band’s upcoming tour dates. Speaking to Variety, Black promised that Tenacious D “will be back.”\n\n“We need to take a break. Everybody needs a break sometime,” Black explained. “And we’ll be back.”\n\nAsked if he had spoken to Gass since canceling the tour, Black replied, “Yeah, we’re friends. That hasn’t changed. These things take time sometimes… And we’ll be back when it feels right.”\n\nAs proof of his commitment to Tenacious D, Black noted that he was wearing the magical guitar pick from the band’s 2006 film, Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. “I love Tenacious D. It’s probably my favorite job, if you can call it that, Black added. It’s a work of art, it’s my baby.”\n\nDuring a Tenacious D concert in Australia last month, Gass was asked to make a wish for his birthday and responded, “Don’t miss Trump next time.” While Gass initially apologized for the comment as “highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake,” he later removed the apology post from his Instagram page.\n\nFor his part, Black initially said he was “blindsided” by the joke, and decided to cancel the band’s remaining tour dates and put “all future creative plans are on hold.”\n\nLast weekend, Dave Grohl covered a portion of Tenacious D’s song “Tribute” during Foo Fighters’ concert in Denver.\n\nJack Black Promises Tenacious D “Will Be Back”\n\nScoop Harrison\n\nPopular Posts\n\nDavid Lynch Suffers from Emphysema, No Longer Able to Direct in Person\n\nBoyWithUke Announces New Album Burnout, Breaks Down Origins of \"Ghost\": Exclusive\n\nMs. Lauryn Hill Cancels US Leg of Co-Headlining Tour with Fugees At Last Minute Without Explanation\n\nStray Kids Took on Lollapalooza and Emerged Triumphant: Interview + Set Recap\n\nAerosmith Retire from Touring Due to Steven Tyler's Vocal Injury\n\nSt. Vincent Thinks John Mayer's \"Daughters\" Is the Worst Song Ever Written"
