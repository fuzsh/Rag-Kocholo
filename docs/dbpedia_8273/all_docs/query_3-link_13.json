        "text": "All the buzz surrounding the British royal family of late has been about the medical trials facing King Charles III and Princess Kate, both dealing with undisclosed cancers.\n\nTheir private battles have forced other royals to step up their public duties. But not Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's so-dubbed favorite son, who stepped back from royal life several years ago after being enmeshed in the sordid life of his onetime friend, convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIf you don't remember the details of that fall from grace, \"Scoop\" is here to remind you. The new Netflix film (streaming now) is based on the book \"Scoops: The BBC's Most Shocking Interviews, from Steven Seagal to Prince Andrew,\" by BBC producer Sam McAlister. The movie stars Billie Piper as McAlister, Gillian Anderson (\"The Crown\") as BBC interviewer Emily Maitlis and Rufus Sewell (\"The Diplomat\") as Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Scoop\" focuses on the prince's decision to speak to the media about his past association with Epstein and allegations that he was connected to one of the teens being trafficked by the financier. Andrew was sure the frank talk would clear his name, but the opposite ensued.\n\nMcAlister explains to USA TODAY which parts of her infamous scoop were spot on and where \"Scoop\" had to take creative liberties to keep the story moving.\n\nFrom 'Poor Things' to 'Damsel': Here are 15 movies you need to stream right now\n\nDid Prince Andrew agree to the BBC interview as quickly as the movie suggests?\n\nIn \"Scoop,\" McAlister indefatigably works the phone to secure her famous subject in what seems like a matter of weeks. But in truth, \"we're talking about 13 months of work to land that interview,\" she says.\n\nIt all started with an email McAlister received in fall 2018 from publicists working with the prince, who asked if \"BBC Newsnight,\" the \"60 Minutes\"-type program she worked for, might want to speak to Andrew about his charitable work. McAlister declined but said the BBC would be interested if the prince − who by then was known to have been a friend of Epstein's for more than a decade − wanted to have a broader conversation.\n\n\"Most people never call back,\" says McAlister. But seven months later, McAlister was invited to Buckingham Palace to meet Andrew's chief of staff, Amanda Thirsk (Keeley Hawes).\n\nDid BBC producer Sam McAlister actually suggest to Prince Andrew's chief of staff that they go for a drink?\n\nMcAlister comes across in \"Scoop,\" and in real life, as a brash straight shooter who doesn't mince words, as evidenced in a scene where she insists that Thirsk dispense with the formal tea and hit a local bar for a martini. There, the two women develop a mutual respect that will shape the delicate negotiations to land the prince for the interview.\n\n\"We didn't go for a martini, we just had tea at the palace,\" says McAlister with a laugh. \"I don't know if she drinks, but I do.\"\n\nMcAlister says that throughout their parlay, Thirsk remained a \"woman of integrity. She was cool, calm, clever and direct.\" It is Thirsk who ultimately overrules a hired consultant who is advising against Andrew going on TV.\n\nDid Princess Beatrice participate in negotiations to get Prince Andrew on the BBC?\n\nIn a watershed moment in \"Scoop,\" three representatives of the BBC, including McAlister and anchor Maitlis, are invited by Thirsk to meet with Andrew to discuss the parameters for a possible interview. But there was an unexpected guest: Princess Beatrice, his grown daughter with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.\n\nMcAlister tells the prince he is known as \"Randy Andy,\" a nod to his womanizing, and far worse on social media. Andrew replies that he pays no attention to social media, but Beatrice pipes up to confirm McAlister's point, which makes Andrew stiffen.\n\n\"I don't recollect exactly what she said, but it was absolutely pivotal to have her in the room,\" says McAlister. Andrew then announced he would be speaking to his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. \"At first I thought, you're 59, why are you checking with your mum? But if you imagine him doing so, that is quite amazing.\"\n\nDid Prince Andrew really think the BBC interview that sealed his fate had gone well?\n\nThe ensuing one-hour interview at Buckingham Palace resulted in a number of shocking statements: Andrew saying he didn't sweat, he didn't know where the bar was at a nightclub he frequented, he couldn't have been with a trafficked minor because he was at a pizza parlor with his daughter. The world turned on the royal and days later, Andrew announced he would step away from public duties.\n\nBut when the interview ended, Andrew thought things had gone swimmingly. \"He looked pleased, and offered (interviewer) Emily a tour,\" says McAlister. \"But I was shocked. He'd told us some of these things in a meeting days before the interview, but I never thought he'd say these things for the camera.\"\n\nPreviously: Prince Andrew to 'step back from public duties' after Jeffrey Epstein fallout\n\nMcAlister intuitively knew she'd helped the BBC get the scoop of a lifetime. \"I was 15 feet behind him during that interview, and the two parts of my brain reacted immediately,\" she says. \"The former criminal defense attorney thought, although he's denying the allegations (of sex with minors), it's a prosecutor's dream. And the journalist in me is thinking, 'Oh, my God, every answer of his is a fresh news line.' My brain was exploding.\"\n\nWill Prince Andrew ever be able to live down the BBC interview that is retold in 'Scoop'?\n\nIn the BBC interview, which took place in November 2019, Prince Andrew is confronted with not only his ill-judged friendship with Epstein, but by his choice to continue their association, despite Epstein's sex-trafficking convictions and sordid connections.\n\nAndrew also denied ever knowing one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Giuffre, despite photographic evidence that he was in a room with his then-teenage accuser and Epstein's girlfriend and facilitator, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is imprisoned in the U.S.\n\n\"Scoop\" features an avalanche of tweeted comments that followed the BBC interview, all suggesting forgiveness won't be forthcoming.\n\n\"It doesn't surprise me that Andrew isn't back doing public duties, despite the current hardships for the royal family,\" says McAlister. \"There's the royal court and there's the court of public opinion, and while he may deny all the allegations, the court of public opinion drew its conclusions the day of that interview. His return is not conceivable to the British public.\""
