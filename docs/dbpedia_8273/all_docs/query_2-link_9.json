        "text": "New out on DVD/Blu-ray for Tuesday April 30.\n\nSilver Linings Playbook\n\nLife doesn't always go according to plan. Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has lost everything - his house, his job, and his wife. He now finds himself living back with his mother (Jacki Weaver) and father (Robert De Niro) after spending eight months in a state institution on a plea bargain. Despite suffering from a severe case of bipolar disorder, Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife. All Pat's parents want is for him to get back on his feet - and to share their family's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. When Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both their lives.\n\nNow is your chance to finally check out one of the most acclaimed films of the year. Nominated for 8 Academy Awards and winner of the Best Actress Oscar for Jennifer Lawrence, Silver Linings Playbook is an absolute joy to watch and easily one of the best films of the past year. It's an unconventional film that consistently defies expectations. On the one hand it is a sweet and charming romantic comedy about two people who suffer from mental illness and depression discovering that they are kindred spirits, and on the other hand it takes a dramatic and realistic look at the effects that mental illness has on individuals and their loved ones. But just to be clear, this movie is truly hilarious at times and I found myself laughing and smiling throughout the duration of the film.\n\nWriter and director David O. Russell (Three Kings, The Fighter) does a brilliant job of finding the right tone for this film. Showcasing two mentally ill people falling in love could have become cringe-inducing or goofy but in his capable hands it never devolves into either. Instead it is handled with realism, humanity and charm. This film has a real heart to it and more depth than you would find in most Hollywood romantic comedies.\n\nFeaturing superb performances from an excellent cast and smart, witty dialogue throughout, Silver Linings Playbook is a simply wonderful film that I sincerely hope everyone seeks out as soon as possible.\n\nI loved it!\n\nThe Guilt Trip\n\nAs inventor Andy Brewster (Seth Rogen) is about to embark on the road trip of a lifetime, a quick stop at his mom's (Barbara Streisand) house turns into an unexpected cross-country voyage with her along for the ride.\n\nThe Guilt Trip is a pretty standard, formula comedy featuring the annoying, nagging mom who makes life miserable for her meek and nerdy son. Streisand does a fine job playing the typical Jewish mother who knows it all and constantly offers her son advice on how to live his life. Most of the comedy in this film stems from them bickering with one another during their road trip and it grows tired pretty fast. There isn't a whole lot of originality here at all, but if you are in the mood for a light-hearted and sometimes cute comedy then I suppose there are worse films you could watch than The Guilt Trip.\n\nFor the most part though I found this film to be pretty lame-brained and there was nothing overly special about it.\n\nMeh!\n\nNot Fade Away\n\nWhen the Rolling Stones appear on U.S. TV in 1964, they set off a shock wave that found kids all over America buying cheap guitars and starting bands of their own. This coming-of-age tale features a group of friends in New Jersey who set out for rock stardom.\n\nDirected by David Chase, the creator of the hit series The Sopranos, Not Fade Away is a small, character driven drama that finds Chase returning to his New Jersey roots. He even reunites with James Gandolfini, who plays the main character's father.\n\nThe best part about Not Fade Away is the soundtrack. It features a plethora of great music from the sixties. Unfortunately I found the story to be somewhat disjointed and I never found myself fully invested in the characters. The film just sort of meanders along until the unsatisfying conclusion.\n\nI felt that Not Fade Away was a well-intentioned but ultimately mediocre film.\n\nAlso out this week is the dark comedy The Details starring Tobey Maguire, Elizabeth Banks, Laura Linney and Ray Liotta, the Spanish drama As Luck Would Have It starring Salma Hayek and the football documentary called Undefeated.\n\nBlast From the Past\n\nThis week featured the release of the road trip comedy The Guilt Trip which was nothing to write home about at all. There have been a multitude of films released over the years that involve some form of road trips that are far better so I thought I would provide you with a list of some of the best road trip movies of all-time. Here are 15 to choose from in no particular order.\n\n1. Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987) - One of the funniest road trip movies ever featuring Steve Martin and John Candy desperately trying to make it home for Thanksgiving.\n\n2. National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) - What doesn't go wrong in this hilarious comedy about the Griswolds cross-country odyssey to reach a theme park?\n\n3. It Happened One Night (1934) - Frank Capra directed this screwball comedy starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. It's an all-time classic.\n\n4. Smokey and the Bandit (1977) - One of the most popular chase movies ever made, this fun Burt Reynolds vehicle also featured the always hilarious Jackie Gleason and Sally Field.\n\n5. The Straight Story (1999) - David Lynch's wonderful and gentle tale of an old man (played beautifully by Richard Farnsworth) who travels across several states on a riding lawnmower to visit his dying brother. One of my personal favourites.\n\n6. The Motorcycle Diaries (2004) - Gael García Bernal is excellent as a young, pre-revolutionary Che Guevara who journey's across South America on a motorcycle encountering various downtrodden people.\n\n7. Little Miss Sunshine (2006) - One of the best dysfunctional-family-on-the-road comedies ever made, this gem of a film features Steve Carell, Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Toni Collette and Paul Dano piling into a yellow VW bus to take little Abigail Breslin to a beauty pageant. Hilarity ensues!\n\n8. The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994) - This Australian comedy features Guy Pearce, Terence Stamp and Hugo Weaving as a trio of drag queens who make their way to a show in the middle of the desert. It's outrageous.\n\n9. Midnight Run (1988) - Great action comedy with bounty hunter Robert De Niro escorting Mob accountant Charles Grodin cross-country while rival bounty hunters and mobsters are in pursuit.\n\n10. Sideways (2004) - Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are stellar as two buddies who embark on a week-long road trip through the California wine country. This intelligently written film is funny, touching and full of wisdom. I loved this movie.\n\n11. Harry and Tonto (1974) - Art Carney's Oscar winning turn as an elderly man who travels across the country to visit family accompanied by his beloved cat named Tonto. This would make a wonderful companion piece to The Straight Story.\n\n12. Rain Man (1988) - Tom Cruise ends up bonding with his autistic brother Dustin Hoffman in this excellent Oscar winning drama.\n\n13. Dumb and Dumber (1994) - I doubt that Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey have ever been goofier and funnier than they were in this hilariously stupid buddy comedy about the misadventures of two complete knuckleheads.\n\n14. Thelma & Louise (1991) - Ridley Scott's highly entertaining action drama about two women on the lamb who hit the road in a '66 Thunderbird. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are both superb in this rousing road adventure.\n\n15. It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963) - One of my all-time favourite comedies, this film features arguably the greatest ensemble cast of comic actors ever in the history of cinema. The funniest people that ever lived all gather in a madcap dash across the country to locate a buried treasure. I never get tired of this classic.\n\nNew out on DVD/Blu-ray is brought to you by Leo's Videos, 2680 Pandosy St. (250) 861-8437\n\nThis article is written by or on behalf of an outsourced columnist and does not necessarily reflect the views of Castanet."
