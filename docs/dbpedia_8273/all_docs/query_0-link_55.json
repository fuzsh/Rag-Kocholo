        "text": "\"I've never been smuggled into a palace before.\" Netflix has unveiled the main official trailer for the film Scoop, a behind-the-scenes account of Prince Andrew's infamous Newsnight interview. This is debuting in early April on Netflix worldwide for everyone to enjoy (first teaser here). It tells the story of how the BBC obtained their bombshell interview with Prince Andrew bravely discussing his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The interview aired in 2019 just a few years ago - you can watch a BBC video about it here. Gillian Anderson (as Emily Maitlis), Keeley Hawes (as Amanda Thirsk), Billie Piper (as McAlister), and Rufus Sewell (as Prince Andrew) star in Scoop, which is directed by Philip Martin, who has been directing episodes of \"The Crown\", \"Catherine the Great\", & \"Night Sky\" most recently. The film is a tribute to the tenacity and bravery of journalists, showing how far they're willing to go for a major scoop. Might be good! The performances in this look tremendous, seems like it's going to be an invigorating watch.\n\nHere's the main official trailer (+ two posters) for Philip Martin's Scoop, direct from Netflix's YouTube:\n\nYou can rewatch the teaser trailer for Philip Martin's film Scoop right here, to view the first look again."
