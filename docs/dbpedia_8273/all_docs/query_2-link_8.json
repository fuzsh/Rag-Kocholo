Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKate Winslet played Iris, a woman who decides to spend the holidays in Los Angeles after her ex-boyfriend announces he's engaged to another woman.\n\nAfter receiving the heartbreaking news, Iris is depressed and distraught. However, after getting a request from Los Angeles movie trailer executive Amanda, played by Cameron Diaz, to switch homes for the holidays, everything starts to look up for Iris.\n\nWhile in Los Angeles, she befriends an elderly neighbor who was a writer for many old Hollywood movies and gains self-confidence.

However, this changes when he meets Amanda and they fall in love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJude Law is known for his performances in \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" and \"Cold Mountain.\"\n\nLaw also co-starred in the \"Sherlock Holmes\" films alongside Robert Downey Jr. and in \"Anna Karenina\" with Keira Knightley.\n\nIn 2016, Law starred as the title role in HBO's \"The Young Pope.\" The actor has also held prominent roles in \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" and \"Captain Marvel.\"\n\nHis most recent acting credits include appearing again as Albus Dumbledore in \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore\" and as Captain Hook in \"Peter Pan & Wendy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack Black plays Miles, a funny and down-to-earth film score writer who befriends Iris and Arthur, her elderly neighbor.\n\nMiles is originally introduced as one of Amanda's ex-boyfriend's friends and his friendship with Iris grows throughout the movie. They connect by watching old Hollywood movies, many of which were written by Arthur.\n\nTheir friendship turns romantic after they decide to help prepare Arthur for an event in his honor.

Iris tells Jasper she is going on holiday to get over him.\n\nHowever, instead of leaving her alone, Jasper asks Iris for notes on his manuscript while she's on vacation. He also shows up in Los Angeles unannounced to tell Iris he's afraid of losing her but is still engaged. Iris breaks it off, finally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe British actor has starred in movies like \"Judy\" and TV shows like \"The Man in the High Castle\" and \"Victoria.\"\n\nIn addition to those roles, Sewell also guest-starred in \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" as a stubborn, but genius, artist.\n\nHis most recent acting credits include roles in \"Kaleidoscope,\" \"The Diplomat,\" and \"The Trouble with Jessica.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEdward Burns plays the small role of Amanda's ex-boyfriend, Ethan.\n\nAfter a rip-roaring fight in one of the first scenes of the movie, Ethan tells Amanda he has cheated on her with his secretary but blames it on the fact that he doesn't feel connected to Amanda.
