        "text": "Scoop is a yellow backhoe digger, the first machine in Bob's team, and the unspoken leader of Bob's crew of construction machines. Scoop is based at Bob’s yard, along with his other machine friends.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was Bob's first machine as shown in When Bob Became a Builder, when Bob was choosing a backhoe digger from behind a chain-link fence. Scoop was the one chosen by Bob when Scoop kept following him to attract his attention.\n\nWhen a storm swept through Bobsville, Bob and Scoop went out to do repairs throughout the town. While they were gone Pilchard had an accident that left her dangling off a broken tree over a duck pond. Bird was able to alert Scoop about the situation and Bob and Scoop set off to the rescue, Scoop was able to use his backhoe to move the Ducks out of the pond and into Dizzy's mixer and then used his backhoe to rescue Pilchard. Scoop is shown to be faster than Travis as shown in Travis and Scoop's Race Day, when Spud challenged them to a race after an argument broke between him and Travis. Despite Spud's attempts to sabotage him Scoop was able to win the race.\n\nIn the third series, Bob and Wendy were invited to lunch at the Town Hall and put Scoop in charge of building a garage for the mayor making him a bit cocky. Unfortunately while Mr. Bentley was inspecting the job, Scoop accidentally ran over Mr Bentley's watch. While on a break, Spud convinced Scoop to help him pull some pranks, and later had to rescue Lofty after Spud caused him to fall over.\n\nIn the fourth series, while working at a ditch near Farmer Pickles' Farm, Scoop managed to uncover the fossils of a Stegosaurus, and another time discovered he had hay fever after the hay started to make him sneeze although Spud attempted to find other things to make him sneeze, much to the digger's annoyance.\n\nIn the seventh series, Scoop wanted to join the Snowman competition, but was called away for a job at Mr. Sabatini's.\n\nIn Snowed Under: The Bobblesberg Winter Games, Scoop and the rest of the team went to Bobblesberg to watch the Winter Games and build a log cabin for the mayor. Bob appointed Scoop to be team leader for the job but before they left Scoop began having nightmares about letting Bob down which worried him. When a snowstorm prevented some machines from arriving (with the exception of Benny) to build the course for the winter games, Scoop volunteered the team to help with Benny's assistance, however still worried about his nightmares coming true, Scoop tried to do everything himself leading to arguments and him falling out with the rest of the team and Benny, only after he accidentally destroyed the ice rink did Scoop realize what he had done. Scoop went off and made amends with his friends and together the team manage to finish the course in time for the games. Later Bob told Scoop he was pleased with him telling him it took guts to admit he made a mistake.\n\nin Series 10 Bob won a contest to design a town in Sunflower Valley, Bob also discovered that the winner of the contest had to build the town so the team along with Scoop moved to Sunflower Valley while Wendy initially stayed back in the yard until she could find a replacement Builder. Scoop decided to ask Bob's father Robert if he knew where to find a builder, Robert decided to come out of retirement to take over the yard leaving Wendy free to move to the valley. Robert would occasionally borrow scoop for jobs in Bobsville however this became a problem as Scoop was also needed in Sunflower Valley and being needed in two places wore Scoop out, while Scoop slept Robert decided to call a machine-hire company for a digger and the company sent him Benny, when Scoop awoke he was shocked and delighted to see Benny again.\n\nIn Series 11 Farmer Pickles acquired a forklift named Sumsy to move bottles from his sunflower oil factory to a storage Depot, Scoop wanted to show her around claiming he knew everything about the Valley, Sumsy states she needed to move the bottles, but Scoop didn't listen however stating that Bob didn't even build the depot yet and kept distracting her from doing her job, when she finally got away from him Scoop cut in front of her causing her to break some bottles of oil, it turns out that Sumsy needed to take the bottles to be labeled embarrassing Scoop.\n\nIn Series 14 while building salt pans Bob slipped on some seaweed and fell on to the Sluice Gates breaking them, later Scoop slipped on the seaweed and bumped the broken Sluice Gates making him think he was the one who broke them, Scoop then spent the day trying to hide his supposed mistake from Bob.\n\nPersonality\n\nScoop is a bright yellow digger and is the unspoken leader of the Can-Do Crew. Scoop's personality is notably similar to Bob's in several ways. Scoop also looks up to Bob, and occasionally asks the others, \"Can We Fix It?\".\n\nWhenever Bob and/or Wendy are absent, they leave Scoop in charge of helping out with the job. He is also great at solving problems and is always more than beyond willing to look out for anyone in need.\n\nAlthough he is carefully dedicated to his work, he is always eager to have fun. He also loves to play practical jokes.\n\nHe is also very confident, sensible and reliable according to Bob.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nBasis\n\nScoop resembles a JCB 3CX backhoe digger.\n\nLivery\n\nScoop is yellow with black cab supports and an orange-yellow warning light on the top of his cab, which he turns on only in few occasions. He has a grey exhaust pipe coming out of his perspective left side of his hood. He has large rugged black tires on the rear and smaller ones on the front.\n\nIn the Pilot Episode Scoop had a searchlight on top of his cab, with his eyes on his windshield, a more generic styled mouth, his exhaust pipe in the centre of his hood, two red lights on his rear fenders and the number 1 painted on his sides.\n\nAppearances\n\nTrivia\n\nScoop has two detachable tools:\n\nA loader bucket\n\nA plough blade\n\nThere were two prototype designs for Scoop before the final one was settled upon; one with a mouth-like bucket, and another pre-series design used in the original test pilot.\n\nScoop was the first character designed by Keith Chapman; he is also one of the few characters to closely resemble a real-life type of machine.\n\nScoop could of been considered as the main character of the series, as, during development, the title of series changed daily from Bob the Builder to Scoop's Troop.[1]\n\nIn 2000, Scoop was released as a coin-operated kiddie ride by (Jolly Roger Amusement Rides) LTD, and he features Bob climbing on his left (viewer's right) side and Pilchard in his bucket.\n\nScoop is allergic to hay, grass and flowers, as he has hay fever. This makes him the first machine to have an allergy.\n\nScoop's movement sound is his engine accelerating, in which sounds similar to a truck engine.\n\nScoop's railway compatible Brio models incorrectly depict him without his rear actor. It is included in his Builder System model.\n\nIn the Pilot Episode, Scoop was originally named Digger,and had a different design, he also appeared with a number 1 on his sides.\n\nDespite having a rear actor, Scoop has the ability to be hitched up to trailers as seen in the episodes Muck Gets Stuck, Muck's Sleep-Over and Scruffty the Detective in which he towed the mobile Generator and the special Snowed Under: The Bobblesberg Winter Games in which he towed an ice resurfacer. The hitch appears to be located just underneath the base of his rear actor's first vertical joint.\n\nScoop was the first machine that Bob had a ride on.\n\nRob Rackstraw gives him a Cockney Londoner accent similar to one of his later roles, Kwazii Cat from Octonauts. But Alan Marriott and David Menkin give him a clear American accent.\n\nIn the international versions:\n\nIn the Albanian version, Scoop is called \"Germuesi\", which is Albanian for \"the germ\".\n\nIn the Brazilian Portuguese version, Scoop is called \"Escave\", that means \"Dig\" in Portuguese.\n\nIn the Catalan version, Scoop is called \"Golut\", which is Catalan for \"throat\".\n\nIn the Czech version, Scoop is called \"Béďa\", which is Czech for \"alas\".\n\nIn the Danish version, Scoop is called \"Grab\".\n\nIn the European Portuguese version, Scoop is called \"Escavão\".\n\nIn the Finnish version, Scoop is called \"Kaivuri\", which is Finnish for \"excavator\".\n\nIn the French version, Scoop is called \"Scoup\", which is similar to his English name.\n\nIn the German version, Scoop is called \"Baggi\".\n\nIn the Hungarian version, Scoop is called \"Markús\", a Hungarian version of \"Marcus\".\n\nIn the Norwegian version, Scoop is called \"Skuff\", which is Norwegian for \"drawer\".\n\nIn the Polish version, Scoop is called \"Koparka\", which is Polish for \"excavator\".\n\nIn the Slovenian version, Scoop is called \"Drejc\".\n\nIn the Turkish version, Scoop is called \"Kepçe\", which is Turkish for \"ladle\".\n\nPrior to the 2015 Series (which a different canon to the original series), Scoop was the only male machine of Bob's crew to be voiced by a male actor in the US dub. The others (Muck {who was female in this dub}, Roley and Lofty) were all voiced by female actresses. For most international versions, Scoop is male, but in Poland and Sweden, Scoop is female.\n\nScoop is the only machine in the series to appear in the 'Official Children in Need Medley' music video.\n\nDespite being the most mature of the machines, Scoop acts a bit immature in some of the earlier episodes.\n\nIn Muck Gets Stuck, he makes fun of Muck being scared of the dark and calls him a scaredy truck.\n\nScoop is also most often a careful machine (with rare exceptions), in comparison to his Reboot series counterpart, who is much clumsier.\n\nScoop's prop, along with Dizzy's, is currently on display at the Portsmouth City Museum."
