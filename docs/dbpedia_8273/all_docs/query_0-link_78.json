Ellie Harrison looks at the truth behind the drama\n\nHRHHermione\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJan 1, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n4,298\n\nCity\n\nBoston\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nI watched the movie this weekend and I thought it was pretty decent, but it didn’t really change how I perceive the story at all. Andrew seems like a lonely man raised in a bubble who is entitled and has appalling judgement who just didn’t ever bother to ask any questions or care about what was happening around him because he really only thinks of his own interests.\n\nLeopoldine\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nApr 27, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n1,241\n\nCity\n\nNew York\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nI watched it. It made me have more sympathy for Andrew, his cringe-worthy statements aside. I didn't expect that to happen.\n\nJoined\n\nMar 19, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n766\n\nCity\n\nNowheresville\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nI watched it. It made me have more sympathy for Andrew, his cringe-worthy statements aside. I didn't expect that to happen.\n\nHe almost seemed to be trying not to damn Epstein and it’s like he seemed to forget he was a convicted pedophile. He struck me as someone who convinced himself he’d done nothing wrong and grasped at straws with the pizza and sweating stories - good grief! Portrayed as good for a laugh, infantilized, and entitled. I’d forgotten that Beatrice had been there to help her father decide about the interview. How awful for her the way it turned out! They didn’t make it clear -to me at least - if the new PR guy got to tell Andrew to run away from the interview or if he just quit when he was told it was going to happen.\n\nkalnel\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nMar 4, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,208\n\nCity\n\nCity\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nAs a movie, it was just OK. It builds up the drama very well, but the end sort of fizzles out.\n\nAs far as telling Andrew's story, I thought it painted him as a needy, insecure, pathetic character so far removed from the outside world that he can barely relate to concepts like truth and crime.\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,279\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nI enjoyed it and thought Gillian Anderson was superb in her role.\n\ntommy100\n\nHeir Apparent\n\nJoined\n\nApr 20, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n5,107\n\nCity\n\nEngland\n\nCountry\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nI found it pretty meh but that is because, like all the movies in the recent trend of turning current events into films, it offered nothing new. It was well acted (though I did think Gillian Anderson slipped into Margaret Thatcher role from the Crown at times) but was really just a retelling of what we already knew. That is fine if you are looking back decades later and people have forgotten but I never get the point in doing that so soon after its actually happened. The story of how they got the interview was pretty boring IMO and the most \"wow really\" moment is the interview itself, which of course we have all seen.\n\nInterestingly Matlis is herself a producer on an Amazon three parter about the interview which is coming out later this year. I wonder if that might not offer more given its over three parts?\n\nIt was okay and watchable but just okay IMO.\n\nvictor1319\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nAug 5, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n1,132\n\nCity\n\nBerlin\n\nCountry\n\nGermany\n\nHi,\n\nI have just watched the movie and the plot in here was not fair: Three smart women against a pretty thick Prince - an absolute trainwreck for His Majesty, the Duke of York.\n\nBTW They called him, the Prince, Majesty in this movie... Is this all the fuss, that is about the title HRH, which was stripped from Prince Harry? If yes: I did not know this and I read the Royal Forums since a long time...\n\nBTW Note to myself: If in a position of power, do not surround yourself with personell, that has a light crush on you!\n\nSister Morphine\n\nHeir Apparent\n\nJoined\n\nDec 2, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n3,526\n\nCity\n\nThe Land of 10,000 Starbucks\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nHi,\n\nI have just watched the movie and the plot in here was not fair: Three smart women against a pretty thick Prince - an absolute trainwreck for His Majesty, the Duke of York.\n\nBTW They called him, the Prince, Majesty in this movie...

Also, it's incorrect to refer to Andrew as \"Your Majesty\" or \"His Majesty.\" He's not the king, nor will he ever be."
