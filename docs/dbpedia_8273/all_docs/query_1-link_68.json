        "text": "It's getting harder and harder to remember the era when a new Woody Allen movie was cause for excitement.\n\nAllen's name used to be a reliable signal that a film would be hilarious -- or inventive, or startling. At the very least, it meant that a film was witty even if its humor was lowbrow.\n\nThese days, Allen seems to be cranking out one nondescript movie after another. A few (including last year's \"Match Point\") are quite enjoyable, but those are the ones that seem like anomalies.\n\nThe bulk of his films are more along the lines of the thoroughly forgettable \"Anything Else\" from a few years back. They're just sort of time-passers, for both the audience and for Allen himself; they're devoid of passion for his subject, for his characters and for filmmaking in general.\n\nThe latest entry in that catalogue is \"Scoop,\" a moderately enjoyable mix of comedy, romance and mystery that's not especially funny, romantic or suspenseful.\n\nIt's not without its charms. Allen has always had a keen eye for evocative locations, usually New York but lately London. He revisits the scene of \"Match Point\" in his new film, and the setting provides much of \"Scoop\"'s limited flavor.\n\nThe screenplay has some strong elements too. Seemingly inconsequential points early in the film turn out to be more telling than we thought, and everything is wrapped up neatly in a compact package. And there are some really fun performances, notably by the always enchanting Scarlett Johanssen and Ian McShane.\n\nBut there's a general lack of real wit in both the story and dialogue. Even Allen's most forgettable films in the past (e.g., \"Shadows and Fog\") had scattered, memorable epigrams. \"Scoop\" has only one, marginally clever line (Allen's character says he was raised Jewish but converted to narcissism).\n\nWorse, there are more than a few huge lapses in logic. A murder suspect hides a key piece of evidence in a locked room. After the amateur sleuths who are on to him gain entry into the room and find the evidence, he hides another, even more incriminating clue in exactly the same place. Both were fairly innocent-looking items that he could have tossed in a trash can, and they would have never been discovered.\n\nThe story has Johanssen as a journalism student vacationing in London, which is in the midst of a scare by a serial killer who leaves tarot cards at his crime scenes.\n\nShe attends a performance by a mediocre magician called Splendini, whose really a Brooklynite named Sid Waterman (played by Allen). She volunteers to be the subject of a trick in which she's put inside a box and made to disappear.\n\nInside the box, she's visited by the ghost of a legendary but recently departed newspaper legend (McShane). He tells her that a famous aristocrat (Hugh Jackman) is the Tarot Card Killer, and urges her to ferret out the truth. She takes on the challenge, but insists on bringing Waterman along.\n\nPredictably, she ends up falling in love with Jackman.\n\nThe mystery itself is OK. We're interested in finding out if Jackman is the killer, but we never really care all that much. The romance is even less compelling. There's almost no dramatic tension in either storyline.\n\nThe film's biggest liability, though, is Allen's performance. He plays essentially the same character he made famous in the 1960s -- bumbling, bewildered and socially inept. There was a certain charm to the character 35 years ago. But now that Allen is in his 70s, the character comes across as kind of creepy.\n\nStars Scarlett Johansson, Hugh Jackman, Woody Allen and Ian McShane. Written and directed by Allen. 97 min. Rated PG-13. Grade: C+\n\nREVIEW: Scoop"
