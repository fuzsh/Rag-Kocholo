        "text": "Products & Purchases\n\nsome\n\nMovie centers on Newsnight TV show on the BBC, both of which are mentioned frequently. A Canon camera is used by a character and shown prominently in numerous shots. Nando's is mentioned and a takeaway bag seen on-screen. A Chanel logo is seen on a jacket worn by a main character in most scenes, and an Apple iPhone and Macbook are used. Google search screen is shown numerous times. BIC biros, Tramp nightclub, and Pizza Express are all referenced. Newspapers shown and mentioned include News of the World, Evening Standard, and Daily Mail.\n\nPositive Role Models\n\nsome\n\nSam is hardworking and is confident in her ability and opinions. She uses initiative to get big stories but doesn't always play by the rules and rubs her colleagues the wrong way. But her perseverance pays off on a big scoop, and her intelligence and savviness are eventually acknowledged. Emily is well-respected and good at her job as a newsreader, but also open to listening to the views of those she respects. The news crew put their differences aside and use teamwork to secure a big interview. Amanda is dedicated to Prince Andrew, supporting him and trying her best to do right by him. She goes against the advice of others to pursue her own direction, which ends up putting him at risk. Andrew appears to be privileged and clueless when it comes to the repercussions of his actions. He faces serious accusations surrounding his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He's polite to most people but rude to a palace maid on one occasion, and is shown to struggle under pressure.\n\nDiverse Representations\n\na little\n\nWomen are seen in positions of power and authority and to be the people making the interview happen on both sides. The cast is mostly White, with just one Black person on the news team and a Black teen in a supporting role. Sam is referred to as \"too Daily Mail\" by a colleague and doesn't feel accepted by those she works with due to her working-class background, though she proves herself as an asset to the team and gains their respect. Both Sam and Amanda are single mothers, and portrayed as smart, successful women. Sam is shown to be close to her son and a confidant to him, though sometimes puts work first in an emergency.\n\nDid we miss something on diversity? Suggest an update.\n\nParents need to know that Scoop is a fictionalized drama based on the infamous Prince Andrew interview on British TV show Newsnight. It shows how mostly women were responsible behind the scenes for securing the scoop, and women are portrayed as intelligent and resourceful throughout. Due to the subject matter, there are references to pedophilia, child sexual abuse, and sex trafficking, as well as mention of suicide. There's brief male nudity from behind, characters drinks alcohol on occasion, and strong language includes \"f---ing\" and \"s--t.\" Newspapers and brands are seen and mentioned, as well as constant references to Newsnight and the BBC. The film is based on true events that made headlines across the world and has a star-studded cast including Billie Piper, Gillian Anderson, and Rufus Sewell, which will likely draw in intrigued audiences who enjoy a well-made current affairs drama with mature themes.
