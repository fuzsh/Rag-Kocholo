        "text": "Story\n\nSondra Pronsky (Scarlett Johansson) is an American journalism student on holiday in London with her friend Vivian (Romola Garai). On a trip to the theatre to see magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), Sondra has an unlikely encounter with recently deceased Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), a journalist famous for getting the latest ‘scoop’.\n\nJoe tells Sondra that Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), son of Lord Lyman, is in fact the ‘Tarot Card Killer’, a serial murderer who preys on prostitutes. The killer left a clue at his latest murder, which Lord Lyman’s secretary, now dead, passed on to Joe. Sondra, of course, finds this hard to believe. Nevertheless, with the help of Waterman, who poses as her father, she sets out to find the truth.\n\nSondra manages to set up a meeting with Peter Lyman, who is instantly attracted to her and dazzles her with his charm and good fortune. Sondra falls in love with Lyman and is very relieved when someone else is arrested for the murders. But not all is as it seems and Sondra finds herself in great danger.\n\nThemes\n\nMurder; life after death\n\nViolence\n\nThere is some violence in this movie including:\n\nCharacters talk about women being murdered (nothing is actually shown).\n\nSid dies in a car crash (nothing actually shown).\n\nPeter pushes Sondra into the lake to drown her\n\nSexual references\n\nThere are some sexual references in this movie, including:\n\nSondra goes to interview an actor called Michael Tinsley who plies her with alcohol. Vivian later asks her how the sex was but Sondra can’t remember because she was too drunk. Vivian says she wouldn’t mind a roll in the hay with Michael Tinsley.\n\nSid says Sondra has a problem with promiscuity.\n\nSid asks Sondra if she gained anything from her weekend other than the chance of pregnancy.\n\nAlcohol, drugs and other substances\n\nThere is some use of substances in this movie, including:\n\nAlcohol is drunk at a number of different settings.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nThere is some nudity and sexual activity in this movie, including:\n\nSondra and Peter are shown kissing and sleeping together apparently naked but they are covered by sheets.\n\nProduct placement\n\nThe following products are displayed or used in this movie:\n\nWalkers chips\n\nCobra beer\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere is some coarse language in this movie, including:\n\nGod\n\nJesus\n\nBloody\n\nIdeas to discuss with your children\n\nScoop is a black comedy about life and death, which shows that reality isn’t always what it appears to be.
