        "text": "The film is essentially a piece of nostalgia, but it swings along with an insouciance we haven't had from him in a long time.\n\nFull Review | Nov 2, 2018\n\nIt's funny enough to keep you from cringing, but not nearly as good as Match Point. Of course, Match Point wasn't trying to be funny either. So proceed with caution.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Nov 2, 2018\n\nScoop is classic Allen -- light comedy with a murder mystery plot, supernatural themes and enough jokes about sex, death, psychoanalysis and philosophy to keep fans happy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Nov 2, 2018\n\nLast year's Match Point marked a surprising return to vital filmmaking form for Woody Allen, but that movie had the distinct advantage of not being a comedy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/4 | Aug 5, 2015\n\nScoop is reminiscent of several of Woody Allen's films, but in a strange way, it harks back to films that were neither great nor lousy -- and like those films, it is an enjoyable diversion.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Aug 5, 2015\n\nThe initial novelty of seeing and hearing Johansson put on an Allen avatar geek persona in her first scene can't carry the film.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Aug 26, 2007"
