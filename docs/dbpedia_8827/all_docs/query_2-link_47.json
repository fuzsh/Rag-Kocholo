        "text": "Even otherwise intelligent people sometimes have trouble with Woody Allen, these days.\n\nLiberal-minded folks who wouldn't have dreamt of convicting O.J. Simpson before the juries had their says believe everything Mia Farrow ever had to rant about Woody Allen and condemn him for his relationship with Soon Yi, sentencing themselves to never watching his films.\n\n\"He was a father figure to her!\" screams a pal. \"He took advantage of that relationship!\"\n\nWell, there are two major and many minor things wrong with that stance:\n\n-- Mia Farrow was the great adopter of children and I pray that God blesses her for it. Woody Allen was her part-time squeeze who lived on the other side of Central Park. I don't believe he was ever, for as much as one second, a father figure to Soon Yi. Also, Soon Yi -- in the various film bits and news footage I have seen of her -- seems plenty bright. Nobody is taking advantage of that young woman.\n\n-- But more to the point, those people need to remember something that has been a rule of the arts since there were people bright enough to think about them: The art and the artist are not the same thing. The ancient Greeks knew that; we ought to be keeping it in mind.\n\nOne review I saw of \"Deconstructing Harry\" is a case in point. The ill-informed reviewer said, in effect, that Woody Allen's sexual life was on view in the movie -- which it was not. Better informed writers were saying the movie was loosely based, in fact, on a certain famous novelist.\n\nOther less-than-bright reviewers are fond of using the phrase \"the Woody Allen role,\" such as \"In 'Bullets Over Broadway,' John Cusack played the Woody Allen role.\"\n\nWrong, people.\n\nWoody Allen is a writer, and he writes about subjects he finds interesting. He has toolbox full of techniques, personalities, social situations, jokes, descriptions with which he builds his stories and movies.\n\nOne of the characters we see in his movies quite often is the nebish -- Yiddish for \"little nerd.\" An awkward, physically inept, socially ungraceful guy. Well, that's not Woody Allen. He may not be built like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but he's always been something of an athlete, since his grade-school days, and is still in pretty good shape at the ripe old age of 64. He is not socially inept except when he wants to be and is in fact a possessor of a powerful and competent personality, which has driven the making of his many wonderful movies and ... gotten him the attention of a lot of extraordinatry women over the years.\n\nIs there a nebish inside him somewhere? Eh, maybe, to some degree. Perhaps all authors have some portion of their characters inside them.\n\nAristotle said \"comedy aims at representing men as worse ... than in actual life.\" So, maybe Allen sees that nebish in himself or in someone else, then expands on it for the sake of his art.\n\nHe saw a womanizing, morally bankrupt, emotionally detached novelist among his New York contemporaries, and made that character worse for the sake of the movie \"Deconstructing Harry.\"\n\nIn the process, he earned some laughs, and he made some comments about segments of humanity. He enriched us in the process.\n\nWoody Allen is not Virgil Starkwell (\"Take the Money and Run\"), Fielding Mellish (\"Bananas\", Allan (\"Play It Again, Sam\"), Boris Dimitrovich Grushenko (\"Love and Death\"), Alvy Singer (\"Annie Hall\"), David Shayne (\"Bullets Over Broadway\"), Lenny (\"Mighty Aphrodite\"), Ray Winkler (\"Small-Time Crooks\") or any of the other characters he has created, and even acted.\n\nWoody Allen is a sharp-eyed observer of humans and their strengths and frailities, and he is a wonderful story teller and entertainer.\n\nI've been a fan of Woody Allen for more than 40 years, starting with his TV appearances as a comedian. Over the decades he has made me laugh, he has touched my heart and mind, he has impressed me, and he has helped me learn how to be a human being.\n\nThose who reject him because of Mia Farrow and Soon Yi are depriving themselves of those enrichments. Too bad for them."
