        "text": "What movie could be more appropriate on your visit to Manhattan than New York Stories? This 1989 film partially directed and written by Woody Allen, consists of three stories, with the central theme being New York City. The first, entitled “Life Lessons” was written by Richard Price, and tells the story of an artist who is having trouble finishing paintings for a major gallery exhibition. Paulette, his apprentice, assistant, and former lover lives and studies with him. Their tumultuous relationship fuels his creativity, but when she leaves, he realizes he can no longer paint. He is in need of the emotional turmoil he had with her. At the art exhibit, he meets another young woman who is an artist. By the end, he has convinced her to come home with him and become his new assistant, and most likely his new lover, thus beginning the cycle all over again.\n\nThe second story, entitled “Life Without Zoe,” was written by Francis Ford Coppola and follows a 12 year old girl named Zoe who spends much of her time trying to reunite her divorced parents.\n\nFinally, the third short is by Woody Allen and called “Oedipus Wrecks.” Sheldon, A New York lawyer, played by Woody himself, wishes that his critical Jewish Mother would disappear. As a bonding experience, he takes his mother and girlfriend whom she does not approve of to a magic show. When Sheldon’s mother is called onstage as a volunteer, she disappears for the magician’s trick. The unexpected part is that she never reappears. This is great for Sheldon as he begins living his life without the stress caused by his mother. However, his mother soon miraculously appears in the sky over New York City wreaking havoc in his daily life and ends his relationship. In search of a cure, he goes to see a psychic who he hopes can set his mother straight. It is unsuccessful, but Sheldon falls for the psychic who reminds him of his mother, and of course, his mother finally approves.\n\nWoody Allen is an American film director, writer, playwright, actor, comedian and musician who has been an important figure in Hollywood. Born in New York City on December 1st 1935, Woody was raised in a middle-class family, and was actually named Allan Stewart Konigsberg. Manhattan can be said to be Woody Allen’s playground. He has directed and written countless films that have been filmed here in wonderful New York.\n\nTake the TCM Classic Film Tour around Manhattan to explore classic film locations on this three-hour guided bus tour of iconic films spanning from the 1940s through the 1980s. You’ll get to see where the famous Tavern on the Green was located as well as other locations from some other Woody Allen movies including, Manhattan. This location was used in the Oedipus Wrecks section of New York Stories. This is only one of over 40 great locations from movies like Crimes and Misdemeanors, Three Men and a Baby, The Seven Year Itch, and Kramer vs. Kramer, among many others."
