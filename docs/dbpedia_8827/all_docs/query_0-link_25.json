        "text": "Welcome to the official Film/Art Gallery collection of original Manhattan vintage movie posters. Film/Art Gallery offers a wide range of movie posters and artwork for the cinema's ultimate romantic comedy films.\n\nManhattan is an American romantic comedy film in 1979 produced by Charles H. Joffe and directed by Woody Allen. Allen and Marshall Brickman wrote the screenplay. Allen co-features as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl (Mariel Hemingway) but becomes infatuated with his best friend (Michael Murphy)'s mistress (Diane Keaton). Meryl Streep and Anne Byrne star as well.\n\nManhattan was shot in black-and-white and 2.35:1 widescreen. It contains music by George Gershwin, including Rhapsody in Blue, which motivated the film. Woodly Allen narrates the film as a fusion of Annie Hall and Interiors.\n\nThe film received favorable critical reviews and was nominated for Academy Awards in categories of Best Actress, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. The Woody Allen film also hauled a North American box-office gross of $39.9 million. Manhattan is Allen's second-biggest box-office hit (adjusted for inflation) and is ranked 46th on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list and is considered one of his finest films. In 2001 the United States Library of Congress considered the film \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nManhattan revolves around Isaac Davis, a forty-two-year-old man who has a glamourized view of his hometown, New York City, most specifically Manhattan, as channeled through the lead character in the first book he is writing - even though his own Manhattan-based life is more of a tragicomedy. Davis has just quit his work as a hack writer for a bad television comedy and, beyond the ten second rush of endorphins during the actual act of leaving, is now regretting the decision. There is increased fear and uncertainty as to whether he can live off his book-writing career, especially considering he is paying off his second ex-wife, Jill Davis, a lesbian who is writing her own tell-all book of their bitter split. One bright spot in the main character's life is that he is dating a young woman named Tracy, although she is only seventeen and still in high school. Because of their age distinction, he does not see an everlasting future with her. Davis' life has the potential to be even more tragicomical when he meets Mary the journalist.\n\nFilm/Art Gallery’s collection of original Manhattan ­­­movie posters include a poster designed by Burt Kleeger for Joseph Caroff Associates. Also included in the Manhattan poster collection are a variety of release styles.\n\nFilm/Art Gallery movie posters are original prints and film poster collectibles. These are original movie posters. We do not carry any movie poster reproductions or reprints of any kind."
