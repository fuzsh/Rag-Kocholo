        "text": "â€” One of the things we try to do in the writing biz is not to waste too much. So it's unusual for me to write a review that's never published in the newspaper.\n\nIt happened once in the past decade. I saw Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and sometime before themovie slipped completely out of my head wrote a review in anticipation of it opening in Arkansas. It never did.\n\nMaybe more remarkable than the fact that I finished a review that never ran is that a late-model Woody Allen film never surfaced in an Arkansas theater. Contrary to what a lot of people think, we're hardly a backwater - largely thanks to Matt Smith's Market Street Cinema in Little Rock, we get an awful lot of independent andforeign films in this market. When it comes to the variety of choices, Little Rock is far better off than any similarsize city I can think of - almost every movie that achieves any sort of national profile eventually opens here.\n\nThat Cassandra's Dream did not is indicative of how far Woody Allen has fallen from the 1970s-'80s heyday when his movies were seen as an essential part of the culture. For a certain kind of moviegoer, a new Woody Allen film was an inevitable experience.\n\nI still think new Woody Allen films are important although the last 20 years or so have muted my anticipation for the annual issue. Now, every Woody Allen movie becomes an occasion to discuss what went wrong with WoodyAllen movies.\n\nMy theory is that Allen became too efficient at getting movies made. He works quickly and cheaply and never has to convince backers that his latest project is a good idea. Cassandra's Dream was the 38th film Allen has written and directed since 1966; his 39th - Vicky Cristina Barcelona - opened a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThat's too many. Allen has arranged his life so no one ever gets to tell him \"no.\" And sometimes - althoughnot as often as his haters think - \"no\" is something he needs to hear.\n\nI'm not sure we ought to hold this against him. I understand the man likes to work; he once told me he'd never - not once - turned down a movie role. (He says he isn't asked that often.)\n\nStill, throw out Allen's 18 weakest movies - among them The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Anything Else, Bullets Over Broadway, Shadows and Fog - and you'd be left with a prolific master. Had Allen murdered his weaker darlings, he'd be a different kind of movie legend and no one would have to open a review of one of his films by explaining how the latest Woody Allen film is not so much a bad film as a superfluous one.\n\nFor people who - against my advice - pay attention to such things, I did not like Cassandra's Dream very much. I scored it a 79, which means nothing other than though I wouldn't recommend the movie to a casual fan, I wouldn't discourage the curious from seeing it. (It's not my job to decide which movies you see.)\n\nI like Vicky Cristina Barcelona quite a bit more, although I don't anticipate writing about it in any end-of-the-year wrap-ups. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a trifle that thankfully doesn't try to be profound. (And to answer the most popular question engendered by my Vicky Cristina Barcelona review, there's no nudity.)\n\nIt follows Allen's recent pattern of following a couple of disappointing movies with a reasonably enjoyable one - it was immediately preceded by Cassandra's Dream and Scoop, which were preceded by the excellent Match Point, which came on the heels of the negligible Melinda and Melinda and Anything Else, which came after the criminally underrated Hollywood Ending.\n\nBut none of these movies have been genuinely important, and if you ask me what the last great Woody Allen film was, I might have to go back to 1989's Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\nStill, Allen made some really nice movies in the 1990s. Mighty Aphrodite (1995), Sweet and Lowdown (1999) and Husbands and Wives (1992) would be examples of a good decade for almost any other writer-director. It's not that he stopped making good movies but that he started making so many indifferent movies that recycled and diffused hisbest ideas. Had he not made the superior (and similarly themed) Match Point, Cassandra's Dream might have been considered the return of the bleakly philosophical Woody (as opposed to the funny Woody or the Woody who flatters the professional classes of Manhattan under the guise of exposing them).\n\nBut you have to consider Cassandra's Dream in light of Allen's previous work; it suffers in comparison to Match Point. And Vicky Cristina Barcelona isn't the equal of Annie Hall, it's just a pleasant exercise in heterosexual male wish fulfillment dressed up in Almodovar color.\n\nAllen's problem is that every offhand, half-considered notion gets blown up and projected on the screen. He's still capable ofmaking strong movies, and his bad movies are never as bad as his critics insist - they're only bad movies compared to what he has demonstrated himself capable of making.\n\nWe know too much about Woody Allen ever to take his movies at face value - we know his tabloid history and tend to seek out the Woody Allen surrogate in every film. (Usually, it's Woody Allen. In the latest film, it's Javier Bardem.)\n\nYet I can't help anticipating the next Woody Allen film; I'm stuck in the same time warp as a lot of his fans. I keep waiting for the next great Woody Allenmovie even though I recognize that it's increasingly unlikely there will be one. I have adjusted my expectations, and if - as at least one friend has alleged - I tend to go a little easy on the old man, it may be that I'm employing the soft bigotry of low expectations. Woody Allen will likely always be among the six or seven filmmakers whose name spills out if I'm asked to name my favorites, but I don't anticipateanything more profound than entertainment from him these days. Which I imagine is all that he'd claim to offer. He's like Bob Dylan; he'd prefer to be seen as just another song and dance guy who does a lot of shows."
