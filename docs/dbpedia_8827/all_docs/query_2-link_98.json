        "text": "irrationalman.jpg\n\nEmma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix in a scene from Woody Allen's \"Irrational Man.\" (Sony Pictures Classics)\n\n(Sabrina Lantos /Sony)\n\nThe credits say that \"Irrational Man\" was written and directed by Woody Allen, but I'm not so sure. Like so many of the films credited to Woody over the last few years, it feels more like a clumsy homage to his earlier work, a sloppy undergraduate thesis meant to expound on the themes of a masterful dissertation like, say, \"Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\n\nIn fact, the bald-faced banality, tedious philosophizing and discomfiting analogues to Woody's real-world personal scandals make it seem possible that the maker of \"Annie Hall\" and \"Stardust Memories\" has been replaced. Perhaps, for all we know, there's a small film studio on the Upper West Side of Manhattan churning out \"Woody Allen\" movies once a year as if the erstwhile Greatest Living American Filmmaker were just a brand name, like Clive Cussler or Carolyn Keene. (Occasional successes such as \"Blue Jasmine\" or \"Midnight in Paris\" only show that some of his proxies have actual talent.)\n\nThat explanation would be a relative comfort, in fact, to those who've tried to remain loyal to Woody's work and forgiving of his various lapses in personal and aesthetic judgment. But it's more obvious now than ever that he's on some sort of misanthropic autopilot, regurgitating the same tired tropes in the voices of the various actors he recruits as his on-screen surrogates.\n\nBecause he's still Woody Allen (at least publicly), those actors are usually skilled. Joaquin Phoenix, for instance, is responsible for almost every worthwhile moment in \"Irrational Man.\" He plays Abe Lucas, a philosophy professor with a troubled past. Abe shows up at his new teaching gig at a bucolic Northeastern private college with a potbelly full of bitter angst and a reputation for romancing his students. This, of course, makes him catnip for Jill Pollard, the perky undergrad played by Emma Stone, whose community service has surely been completed after starring in Woody's last two movies.\n\nWhen Abe and Jill overhear a diner conversation about a corrupt local judge, he goes all utilitarian and decides that the greatest good would be accomplished by murdering the scoundrel. Cue a series of discussions about existential ethics that might seem familiar if you've seen \"Match Point,\" \"Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" Hitchcock's \"Strangers on a Train\" or the inside of a liberal arts college dorm room after 11 on a Friday night.\n\nWhat's especially frustrating, compared to earlier, forgettable Allen misfires like \"Anything Else\" or \"Scoop\" is that \"Irrational Man\" is apparently meant to be taken seriously. Jill's fascination with Abe's two-dimensional \"bad boy\" shtick is ludicrous, but the movie doesn't know it. The philosophy in the film is about as profound as the jacket copy of a Nietzsche anthology. And, once again, Woody (or \"Woody\") demonstrates a remarkable lack of self-awareness with yet another story about an older, smarter man and a much younger, impressionable woman.\n\nPhoenix, gut and all, does what he can with Abe, and Parker Posey energizes her scenes as an unfaithful faculty wife. Woody's usual first-rate collaborators, including cinematographer Darius Khondji, give \"Irrational Man\" more visual sophistication than it deserves. But that's about all there is to recommend the director's 51st feature, if it's really his.\n\nAllen's movies, even at their lowest, have usually boasted interesting musical scores, melding jazz, classical, and American standards. \"Irrational Man,\" though, uses The Ramsey Lewis Trio's \"The 'In' Crowd,\" an already overexposed riff, so repetitively that I thought I was seeing the film with a temp soundtrack. The real Woody, whatever his flaws, would never have allowed this. I hope he comes back someday.\n\n-- Marc Mohan for The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\n***\n\n\"IRRATIONAL MAN\"\n\nGrade: D\n\nRating: R\n\nRunning time: 96 minutes\n\nPlaying at: Opens Friday, July 31 at Regal Fox Tower\n\nCast and crew: Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Parker Posey, Jamie Blackley, Ethan Phillips, Betsy Aidem; directed by Woody Allen."
