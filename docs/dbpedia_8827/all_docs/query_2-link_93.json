        "text": "Whoa whoa whoa......\n\nLet's trash Woody Allen for all the right reasons.\n\nWhich include his adaptations (what - you say direct theft ?) of virtually every important idea Ingmar Bergman ever had.\n\nAlso, his b&w font during opening credits. With snazzy jazz.\n\nFuck that classic reference to the GOOD OLD DAYS.\n\nAllen was a talented comic/director who never broke ground but\n\ncertainly honored the ground of his predecessors.\n\nWoody Allen met his STEP-DAUGHTER for the first time when she was 18 years-old. Andre Previn was her father before then because Mia Farrow had decided to adopt the entire sub-Saharan African Plains. She was Angelina before Angelina !)\n\nSo, Woody did not raise her with Mia.\n\nNow, that still leaves the weirdness of a 50-plus year old man and\n\nthe impossible romance of an 18 year-old, but he's not criminal\n\nin the same sense as ROMAN POLANSKI\n\nROMAN POLANSKI - definitely guilty of much worse than Woody in my opinion\n\nWoody Allen met his STEP-DAUTHER for the first time when she was 18 years old.\n\nSo, Woody did not raise her with Mia.\n\nNow, that still leaves the weirdness of a 50-plus year old man and\n\nthe impossible romance of an 18 year-old, but he's not criminal\n\nin the same sense as ROMAN POLANSKI\n\nROMAN POLANSKI - definitely guilty of much worse than Woody in my opinion\n\nI'm not so sure of this. Every account I've ever read says Woody met Soon-Yi when she was 10 years old. Since he and Farrow never married, he was never even her step father and her adoptive father said \"Allen was never a father figure to Soon-Yi.\" However he certainly knew her long before she turned 18. It was nude photographs of a teenage Soon-Yi that Farrow found that led to the whole eventual scandal.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong. In other news, I really like \"Match Point,\" probably my favorite Allen movie, but maybe that's just because of Scarlett.\n\nI've been sick the past week, some sort of hell-created chest cold. I've been coughing like crazy, and the coughing has been keeping me from sleeping. so I can't concentrate and I'm cranky. can't read, write, etc. so I've been watching a lot of Marx Brothers movies. I love the Marx Brothers. and while watching these movies I'm reminded of how much I like Woody Allen movies.\n\nand while I understand the criticism of his movies and especially his character as a human being, the Woody Allen I see in movies works for me. really works.\n\nFunny choice of words (interesting, not ha ha); the line \"the prisoners received one hot meal a day - a bowl of steam\" (from Take the Money and Run) is among the funniest lines in all of film to me. I can see how you'd really dislike Allen's genre; pseudo-intellectual slapstick doesn't appeal to everyone. It's one of those things that either is really funny to me or I'm not in the mood for it at all.\n\nI agree with you. Stavrogin didn't use the sarcasm font\n\nI've been sick the past week.........whining and complaining,which is not normal for Canadians.... so I've been watching a lot of Marx Brothers movies. I love the Marx Brothers. and while watching these movies I'm reminded of how much I like Woody Allen movies.\n\nand while I understand the criticism of his movies and especially his character as a human being, the Woody Allen I see in movies works for me. really works.\n\nThe Marx Brothers remind me of Woody Allen and vice versa, too. The Seinfeld TV show always reminds me of Woody Allen.\n\nmanhattan was on the other day and catching it for the, say, fourth time, it was really fucking good. his views on women and relationships really works for me too.\n\nthen again, i'm going through some rough times with women, so maybe it hit home a bit more...\n\nI just watched Manhattan and I like the movie but I don't agree with his take on women and relationships all of the time. Which probably has more to do with Woody Allen the man verses Gerard the man.(-me not being a neurotic scrawny Jewish intellectual genius screen writer director.)\n\nI had completely forgotten about this thread until this week.\n\nAnyway - if I sounded dismissive of Allen earlier, it was because I was wearing my critical-thinking helmet and judging his work solely against Bergman. And all the other greats. Woody Allen vs. Cinema itself.\n\nSometimes that helmet fits too tight. Let me re-phrase....\n\nHe is not an insignificant director, really. I have laughed my ass off at so many. many films by him. He perfectly wrote and portrayed the insecure New Yorker looking at life and freaking out. When it comes to romantic comedies, he is the best, I think. (Neil Simon ? No thanks.)\n\nSo, he imitated Bergman, but still pulled off some funny, sentimental stories. My faves are \"Sleeper\", \"Radio Days\" and \"Mighty Aphrodite\". Didn't care for \"Match Point\" at all. But that was more in the character, rather than the script, which had some decent moments.\n\ndammit, man! you cut out all the dramatic tension of my story! why nothing but Marx Brothers movies could help me!\n\ndon't ever become an editor!\n\nbut if you do, let me know. I have some stuff I can send you...heh\n\nI realized at the time of my multi-quote, that I bit off more than I could chew and I knew I should have left more of your whining in there. I must have been drinking or something at the time.:("
