        "text": "In Woody Allen’s 1979 comedy Manhattan, the filmmaker, then 44, dated a 17-year-old character played by Mariel Hemingway. The part earned Hemingway an Oscar nomination, and, according to the actress in a forthcoming memoir, also the unwanted romantic attention of Allen.\n\nIn Out Came the Sun, which will be released on April 7, Hemingway claims that Allen attempted to lure her to Paris once she turned 18—two years after she had filmed Manhattan. “Our relationship was platonic, but I started to see that he had a kind of crush on me, though I dismissed it as the kind of thing that seemed to happen any time middle-aged men got around young women,” writes Hemingway. The actress suggests that Allen attempted to act upon the crush by flying to her parents’ home in Idaho and inviting the teen to Europe.\n\nAccording to an excerpt obtained by Fox News, the actress cautioned her parents “that I didn’t know what the [sleeping] arrangement was going to be [in Paris], that I wasn’t sure if I was even going to have my own room. Woody hadn’t said that. He hadn’t even hinted it. But I wanted them to put their foot down. They didn’t. They kept lightly encouraging me.”\n\nHemingway says that she woke up at night with the realization that “[n]o one was going to get their own room. His plan, such as it was, involved being with me.” She says that she went into his guest room and woke him up asking, “I’m not going to get my own room, am I? I can’t go to Paris with you.”\n\nThe actress says that Allen left Idaho the next morning.\n\nDespite the nervousness Hemingway said she felt during that time of her life, the actress has spoken positively about her experience with the filmmaker in recent years. In 2011, she told W magazine, “In real life, Woody and I didn’t have a romantic relationship, but he did make me feel incredibly intelligent. He took me to museums and concerts. He gave me his wisdom, and you can see that in the character.”\n\nShe also has spoken about how her first kiss, which was with Allen in the film, was an anxiety-ridden one. “I had never kissed anybody. So the kiss in the cab around Central Park terrified me. I was worried about it for weeks,” she told The New Cinema Magazine in 2010. Fortunately it was a long shot and I didn’t have to do much . . . he attacked me like I was a linebacker.”\n\nRelated: Mia Farrow Talks to Maureen Orth About Surviving Scandals Past\n\nTelevision\n\nThe 25 Best Shows on HBO and Max to Watch Right Now\n\nStop aimlessly scrolling: We’ve got all the recommendations you need.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Woman Who Engineered Donald Trump’s Rise From the Ashes of 2020\n\nIn an excerpt of Trump in Exile, Meridith McGraw reveals how the former president was overwhelmed by the dysfunction his election loss brought upon Mar-a-Lago—until Susie Wiles took the wheel of his comeback campaign. “I don’t know who’s in charge,” he told Wiles. “I need you to fix it.”\n\nCelebrity\n\nChasing James Baldwin’s Shadow in the South of France\n\nIt is the centenary of my literary hero.
