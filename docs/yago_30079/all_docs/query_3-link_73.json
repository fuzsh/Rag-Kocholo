        "text": "GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nTITLE: THE LION, THE WITCH & THE WARDROBE\n\nAUTHOR: C S LEWIS\n\nPAGES: 106\n\nPUBLISHER: HARPER COLLINS\n\nYEAR: 1950\n\nGENRE: FANTASY / CHILDREN’S FICTION\n\nCOVER TYPE: PAPER BACK\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe\n\nhttp://cslewis.com\n\nBLURB FROM THE COVER\n\nJourneys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures and epic battles between good and evil – what more could any reader ask for in one book? That book was The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, written in 1949 by C S Lewis. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nFor the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a world where magic meets reality and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations.\n\nThis edition presents all seven unabridged books in one impressive volume. The books are presented according to Lewis’s preferred order, each chapter graced with illustrations by the books’ original artist, Pauline Baynes. Deceptively simple and direct, The Chronicles of Narnia continue to captivate fans with adventures, characters and truths that speak to readers of all ages, even fifty years after they were first published…\n\nREVIEW\n\nThe Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe is chronologically the second Narnia tale. Lewis published it first.\n\nThis is the first chronicle I read. I didn’t know there were any other books about Narnia when I read it. I got it as a Christmas present when I was 11 or 12. I remember it like it happened yesterday. I curled up on the couch and got lost in the world of Narnia. I read it in a couple of hours.\n\nThe Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe has remained one of my favourite books for twenty years. It’s probably one of the best known children’s fantasy novels ever written.\n\nFour children go through a magical wardrobe into a world of snow filled with talking animals. They defeat an evil witch and are crowned kings and queens of Narnia. Queue happy ending.\n\nLewis uses the simple language I loved in The Magician’s Nephew. I still got that kindly old grandfather telling bedtime stories vibe.\n\nLike The Magician’s Nephew, I was blown away by how much Lewis packed into a small amount of pages. That’s a skill.\n\nLewis uses the chatty, realism he used in The Magician’s Nephew which gives the impression The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe is a true story.\n\nThere are loads of brilliant scenes in The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe. When Father Christmas comes to Narnia. Aslan’s death and resurrection. The battle between the good talking creatures in Narnia and the witch’s evil monsters. The witch’s death.\n\nThe ending of The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe is quite sad.\n\nThe four children have ruled Narnia for many years and go off to hunt a white stag. The stag leads them through the woods and eventually they go back through the wardrobe back to their own world and time where only seconds have passed since they left. I wish Lewis had just left them hunting the stag.\n\nTHE OPENING LINE\n\nOnce there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy…\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nThe Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe is my favourite Chronicles of Narnia. It’s the perfect high fantasy novel featuring children defeating evil. Sort of like Harry Potter but a million times better.\n\nThe Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe was adapted for the screen by the BBC years ago along with another couple of Narnia chronicles. I have them all on DVD. I love them even though they look dated now.\n\nThe Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe was adapted for the screen a few years ago by Walden Media / Disney. I have this on DVD as well. It’s a great film. It stars Tilda Swinton, one of my favourite actresses who’s amazing as the white witch."
