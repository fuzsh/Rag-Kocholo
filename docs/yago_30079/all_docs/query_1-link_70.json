Most voting centers closed at 7 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nThe primary election includes Democratic and Republican primaries, as well as nonpartisan positions. Because Georgia is an open primary state, voters were able to choose to pull any ballot they preferred.\n\nThe election results will determine who will represent each party in the general election. The Democratic and Republican ballots featured several important partisan contests for positions such as U.S. Congress members, state legislators, county commissioners, sheriffs, and district attorneys. The winners of the party primaries will face each other in the general election on Nov. 5.\n\nIn counties that heavily favored one party, the primaries essentially decided the winner of the general election.\n\nClayton County\n\nCobb County\n\nDeKalb County\n\nFulton County\n\nGwinnett County\n\nCounties A-G\n\nCounties H-S\n\nCounties T-Z\n\nU.S. House\n\nGeneral Assembly - State House & State Senate\n\nJudicial\n\nRECENT ELECTION STORIES"
