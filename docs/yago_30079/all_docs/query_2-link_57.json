        "text": "I’m a big believer in accountability in government.\n\nIf people have questions, comments or complaints, they should be able to voice them directly to their elected and appointed officials.\n\nOfficials should be there to listen whether it’s the township supervisor, village manager or the county dog catcher.\n\nWhich brings me to the point of this column – the proposed Polly Ann Trail pedestrian bridge over M-24 in Oxford.\n\nThe site plan and the bridge itself have garnered significant criticism from the Oxford Village president, police chief and planner, not to mention the fire chief and an OCDA board member.\n\nWhen I interviewed The Great and Powerful Larry Obrecht a few weeks ago about the proposed bridge (which in his mind is “ready to go”) he told me he didn’t want me to get people “riled up” about this project.\n\n(Just in case you don’t know who Obrecht is, he’s a former Oakland County Commissioner, former Polly Ann Trail manager and the man who initiated the bridge project and is overseeing it. He currently manages the county’s Animal Control Division. In other words, he’s the dog catcher.)\n\nDuring our interview, Obrecht didn’t seem to understand why I was asking questions or doing a news story about the proposed bridge design. When I said the public wants to know what it’s going to look like, Obrecht suggested the public should attend the village planning commission meeting rather than read about it in the newspaper.\n\nWhile we certainly encourage residents to attend meetings, not everybody has the time and a newspaper’s job is to inform the public, to be their eyes and ears especially when they can’t be there.\n\nObrecht’s attitude about the bridge was both evasive and arrogant. It was a mixture of “It’s my new toy and you can’t see it!” and “How dare you question me! Do you know who I am?”\n\nYes Larry, I know who you are.\n\nYou’re the dog catcher.\n\nI have the feeling if Obrecht had his way, nobody – officials or residents – would see what the bridge is going to look like until after it was constructed.\n\nFrom blatantly ignoring the village bridge committee’s guidelines to submitting an incomplete site plan lacking important details, it all seems like an elaborate ruse on Obrecht’s part to create confusion and keep everyone guessing so he can quietly slip his monstrosity through.\n\nI think the public should let Obrecht know how they feel about the bridge – good or bad. I urge people to contact Obrecht. Ask questions. Voice complaints. Give praise, if there’s any to give. Throw the man a bone.\n\nYou can reach Obrecht at (248) 391-4100 or e-mail the Lord of the Canines at obrechtl@co.oakland.mi.us.\n\nYou’re probably wondering what I think of the bridge project. I can sum it up in a few words – ugly, unncessary, a waste of money, something only a dog catcher who lives in Orion could love.\n\nBowwow.\n\nFor a stone-cold political junkie like me, just thinking about next year gets me higher than a kite.\n\nIt’s an election year! It’s an election year!\n\nI know I have a problem, but I don’t care. There’s no 12-step program for those hopelessly addicted to the American political scene.\n\nEven though he’s dead, I’ll bet Richard Nixon will be running for office somewhere warm next year.\n\nIs Satan an elected position?\n\nBut it’s not just the presidential election (i.e. the Super Bowl of American Politics) that gets me all geeked up, it’s the local elections.\n\nNext year is an election year for Michigan’s townships and it promises to be an interesting one in Oxford and Addison.\n\nIn Oxford, I’m going to predict right here and now that Treasurer Joe Ferrari will NOT survive next year’s election to enjoy a fourth term in office, if he’s faced with a serious, viable, breathing opponent who can walk and chew gum at the same time.\n\nI base that prediction on a few things.\n\nOne is my “Wilhammer Theory.”\n\nIn the 2000 general election, Ferrari’s opponent, a relatively unknown independent named Bill Wilhammer, garnered an impressive 1,412 votes.\n\nDue to unfortunate circumstances that arose in his personal life, Wilhammer did zero campaigning, erected not one campaign sign, made no speehes or public appearances, received no endorsements, organized no election committee, bought no advertising in the local newspapers, had zero letters to the editor written on his behalf and didn’t participate in any candidate Q&A’s in the local papers.\n\nDespite all that, Wilhammer managed to receive 1,412 votes. That’s astounding!\n\nThat tells me there are 1,412 residents who were willing to vote for anybody but Ferrari, even someone they knew absolutely nothing about and who did absolutely nothing to get the job.\n\nI don’t know if these voters were more anti-incumbent or anti-Ferrari, but either way, they’re still out there. Lurking. Waiting. Watching. And ready to vote again.\n\nSecondly, this whole business with Sharon Fahy’s lawsuit is going to cost Ferrari lots of votes at the polls, just as the settlement cost the township General Fund $50,000 and the township’s insurance carrier $50,000.\n\nWhether you believe Ferrari is innocent or guilty of Fahy’s accusations, one thing’s for sure – voters take a very dim view of any elected official who costs the community a $50,000 chunk of its budget.\n\nThat’s $50,000 that could have been spent on something the community really needs – like safety paths for instance.\n\nThirdly, I know some people who are still mad – and I’m one of them – that the township paid $3,955 toward Ferrari’s master’s degree in Public Administration from Oakland University. That figure was equal to half of Ferrari’s tuition.\n\nGranted, the township should not have agreed to do it in 1996, but by the same token Ferrari should never have requested the funds in the first place.\n\nI guess the sweet slop of the public trough was just too tempting for the treasurer to resist. Oink, oink, pass the tax dollars!\n\nSorry Joe, but I think your time is up. Better start getting the old resume together. I’m sure there’s a village manager position open somewhere.\n\nBut hey, it’s just a prediction. If I’m wrong, I’ll put in a few bucks toward your doctorate.\n\nWhen two or more candidates run against each other for a government position, it’s called an election.\n\nWhen an incumbent official runs unopposed for his position, it’s called a formality.\n\nThe first is a healthy process whereby the system of representative government renews, refreshes and perpetuates itself.\n\nThe second does nothing to strengthen representative government. Just the opposite. It severely weakens it.\n\nUncontested elections perpetuate low voter interest and low voter-turnout. In these situations, people know their votes literally don’t count because there’s no choice, so why bother to go to the polls. All the candidate has to do is vote for himself and he’s in.\n\nUncontested elections create lazy officials who believe they don’t have to work hard at their jobs or campaigns to garner votes. They expect re-election.\n\nTo them, re-election to their office is not seen as a privilege bestowed upon them by constituents making a thoughtful choice. It’s seen as a right. The same way a monarch or dictator views their position. Pure hubris.\n\nIs that how we want elected officials in our villages and townships to view themselves?\n\nThe only way to prevent that is to run for office.\n\nThere’s no excuse for uncontested elections. There’s no reason every village council seat and township board position shouldn’t have a candidate in the 2004 elections.\n\nMake no mistake, uncontested elections do NOT mean that 100 percent of the people think all of our elected officials are doing a bang-up job and require no challengers. Although some would have you believe it, an uncontested election is not a mandate from the people.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons people don’t run for office. Some bad, some good.\n\nThe bad ones are laziness, disinterest in government and politics, lack of civic responsibility and pride, apathy, etc. The good ones are a desire to spend more time with family, a demanding job, spending lots of hours doing volunteer work, etc.\n\nBut whatever the reason, there’s no excuse that communities consisting of thousands and thousands of eligible, potential candidates, can’t scare up a handful of people to challenge the incumbent officials.\n\nThe last three Oxford Village Council elections have been uncontested – mere formalities, not elections.\n\nBut maybe the March 8, 2004 election can be different. Maybe there can be a real election with incumbents and challengers, real campaigns with signs and literature and a real choice in which voters are forced to think and decide and translate that into action at the polls.\n\nBut it’s all up to YOU whether or not that happens.\n\nThere are two, three-year council seats open for the upcoming village election. All you have to do to run is file a nominating petition (which can be picked up at the village offices) containing a minimum of 25 valid signatures from registered village voters with the village clerk by 5 p.m. Friday, January 16.\n\nIf you’ve been a village resident for at least six months, are a registered voter, a U.S. citizen and at least 18 years of age, congratulations – you qualify to help govern your community and our tax dollars.\n\nIf no one except the incumbents file petitions for their two council seats, the village election will once again be a formality. The incumbents will again be the defacto winners and voters will again be the losers.\n\nNOTE: I learned Tuesday that Oxford Township resident Paul Butkis pulled nominating petitions to run for township treasurer. I applaud Mr. Butkis for wanting to get involved in his local government. I certainly hope more residents follow his lead.\n\nDespite what some state legislators are saying in the news media these days, I think term limits are a good and healthy thing for our representative system of government.\n\nTerm limits can give rise to new points of view, fresh ideas and serve as an impediment to business-as-usual politics.\n\nI don’t believe term limits are some sort of panacea which will cure all the ills government is prone to and give us perfect representatives.\n\nGovernment – and indeed society – can never be perfect because men by their very nature are hopeflessly imperfect beings.\n\n“In Adam’s fall, we sinned all.”\n\nBut I do believe term limits prevent incumbent officials from becoming so solidly entrenched in their positions that it usually takes death, retirement, resignation, or a lust for higher office to get them out.\n\nBeyond state government, I would like to see term limits extended to the local level – township boards, village and city councils, school boards, county officials, etc.\n\nOne elected position should never become a lifetime occupation for anyone.\n\nNobody should hold an elected office for 20 or 30 (or more) years. I don’t care who they are.\n\nAfter decades upon decades in the same position, most people become set in their ways, unwilling to try new ideas, and a little too comfortable to take risks.\n\nI think at a certain point in these long careers making sure you retain your position begins to take precedence over being an effective representative and advocate for your constituents.\n\nA lifetime in the same office can also make some people arrogant, believing they cannot be beaten. And in many cases, they’re right.\n\nMost challengers find it nearly impossible to unseat one of these “lifers” because they have decades upon decades of name recognition and local connections.\n\nFor these “lifers,” their entire career has been one long campaign for office.\n\nHow can a challenger be expected to gain more name recognition in a few short months of campaigning?\n\nUnless a longtime incumbent has been involved in a major scandal like committing crime or causing a lawsuit to be brought against the community, most voters will likely return him or her to office because of their familiarity with the name or person.\n\nUnfortunately, there are lots and lots of lazy voters out there. For them, it’s easiest to go with the name or person they’ve always known rather than actually study the issues or invest any time learning about the challenger(s). It’s sad, but true.\n\nSometimes there are no challengers to lifetime incumbents because potential candidates view it as a waste of time, money and resources to even run.\n\n“Why should I bother to run? That guy’s been in office for 100 years. Nobody’s going to beat him.”\n\nThe result is uncontested elections which help weaken representative government by diminishing the choice given to voters.\n\nI think the absolute maximum any local official should be allowed to serve is three terms in office – regardless of whether it’s a two, three or four year term. That’s long enough to be effective, but not entrenched, and still give some new faces a chance.\n\nDon’t misunderstand me.\n\nI have never believed that “change for change’s sake” is a good thing. I agree with the great 19th century Southern senator John Randolph who told his colleagues, “Change is not reform!”\n\nBut I do believe that effective representative government requires real choices be given to voters and lifetime incumbents are a hindrance to that.\n\nTerm limits eliminate the possibility of lifetime incumbents and open up opportunities for new people to serve in greater numbers.\n\nYou can’t really have a government “of the people, by the people and for the people” when certain people monopolize elected positions for a lifetime.\n\nNOTE: This column is dedicated to Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Wendy Potts, who’s currently presiding over the case which could end OPFEC for good.\n\nYour Honor, I’d like to make my case as to why the Oxford Public Fire and EMS Commission should be dissolved forever and ever.\n\nAllow me to present Exhibit A – the Wednesday, January 21, 2004 meeting.\n\nNever was there a spectacle so comical and yet so sad – except for maybe L. Brooks Patterson’s last road test.\n\nOPFEC in their infinite stupidity and penchant for wastefulness decided to have three, count them THREE, attorneys look over a single proposed agreement.\n\nFire Chief Jack LeRoy asked the board to approve the North Oakland County Mutual Aid Interlocal Agreement, in which fire departments from 13 communities agree to cooperate in various areas with the common goal of enhancing public safety.\n\nBut the board didn’t feel comfortable doing that without an attorney’s review of the document.\n\nFair enough. A wise and prudent decision.\n\nBut here’s where it gets all OPFEC-ed up.\n\nCommissioner Jerry Dywasuk, also a township trustee, suggested the township attorney review it because the interlocal agreement lists – in the opening paragraph – Oxford Township as one of the participants.\n\nIt was later pointed out that the signatory area lists OPFEC as the party and the agreement would actually be with OPFEC.\n\nVillage Manager Mark Slown then suggested the village and OPFEC attorneys also review the document.\n\nFinally, the board agreed to have all three attorneys review it.\n\nLet’s see, the township attorney charges $75 per hour, the village attorney $125 per hour and OPFEC’s legal counsel charges $175 an hour.\n\n(Judging by those fees, I’d say attorneys charge more based on how screwed up the government is.)\n\nSo, we’re going to spend a whopping $375 per hour in legal fees to review a single document.\n\nAnd people wonder why attorney bills are so astronomically high in Oxford government.\n\nHeck, I wish I had a law degree so I could ride the Gravy Train too. Now leaving Penniless Taxpayerville. Next stop Fat City and Big Bucks Junction. All aboard!\n\nGranted, OPFEC did do some good last week. Commissioners hired a full-time firefighter.\n\nBut even that positive action was tainted because it should have been done when it was originally requested by the fire chief in May 2003.\n\nHowever, once again OPFEC in their infinite stupidity and reckless disregard for public safety rejected the chief’s request at that time.\n\nOPFEC’s action at last week’s meeting didn’t add an extra full-timer to the department, it simply replaced one who had resigned in April 2003, which left the department short-handed for nearly nine months.\n\nGood job hiring another full-time firefighter, but it should have been done last year.\n\nFinally, there was the fine display of immaturity and profanity by Commissioner and village President Steve Allen at the end of the meeting.\n\nAllen’s use of words that children usually get their mouths washed out with soap for had no place in a public meeting, especially one being broadcast on Oxford public access television.\n\nI don’t care if he was angered by another commissioner’s sarcastic remarks, he could have expressed his criticism much, much more intelligently and professionally than he did.\n\nIn closing your Honor, may I just say that OPFEC is an abomination, disgrace and embarassment to the good people of Oxford.\n\nIt’s bad government. It wastes tax dollars. It uses naughty words. It’s cumbersome and ineffective.\n\nEvery OPFEC meeting becomes more and more like a FOX network reality TV show and less and less like a government body conducting the public’s business.\n\nYour Honor, I and the good people of Oxford humbly request you kill the Twelve-headed Beast.\n\nThe Prosecution rests – but not comfortably.\n\nI am by nature a lover of words.\n\nAs a writer, nothing gets me higher than finding that perfect word to describe something.\n\nIt feels right.\n\nIt sounds right.\n\nIt looks right.\n\nIt even tastes right (watch out for paper cuts).\n\nSome of my favorite words include – oligarchy, brouhaha, totalitarian and happy hour.\n\nBut last week a reader turned me on to the what I believe is the best word I’ve ever seen in my life.\n\nI fell in love with this word the minute I laid eyes on its five beautiful syllables.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nHere it is:\n\n“KAKISTOCRACY”\n\nIt’s a noun that means, “Government by the worst people.”\n\nIn a Feb. 6, 1956 letter to Time magazine, a reader asked if the word meant “a government of parrots,” considering a “kaka” is a New Zealand parrot.\n\nAlthough there are plenty of bird-brains in government, a kakistocracy has nothing to do with parrots.\n\nThe word originated as a combination of the Greek kakistos (superlative of kakos, which means “bad”) and the English suffix “-cracy,” meaning “form of government.”\n\nAt long last my five year search to find the perfect word to describe Oxford government is finally over.\n\nNo longer do I have to be content to use mundane words like incompetent, deceitful, lazy, moronic, greedy, selfish, stupid, dictatorial, secretive and arrogant to describe my local governments.\n\nThe Oxford Board of Education is a kakistocracy.\n\nThe Oxford Township Board is a kakistocracy.\n\nThe Oxford Village Council is a kakistocracy.\n\nThe Oxford Public Fire and EMS Commission is the Mother of All Kakistocracies.\n\nThey’re all kakistocracies.\n\nAnd I can call the officials who run these governments “kakistocrats.” Forget about Republicans and Democrats, they’re all “kakistocrats” now.\n\nI now feel complete, like a whole person again.\n\nI’m living in kakistocracy.\n\nYou’re living in a kakistocracy.\n\nWe’re all living in a kakistocracy.\n\nLook for me to use this word a lot in future columns.\n\nI invite readers to do the same at government meetings, in letters to the editor, during polite dinner conversation or when having an intense debate with the many voices in your head.\n\nSpecial thanks to the “anonymous” reader who sent me this word. You made my week.\n\nHats off to Channel 19\n\nLast week Oxford Community Television Channel 19 began taping the school board meetings.\n\nThe meetings will be broadcast on Thursdays at 8:30 p.m. and Fridays at 1 a.m. and 1 p.m.\n\nI want to thank Cable Commission Chairman Charles Kniffen and Station Manager Don Huegerich for making this happen so quickly.\n\nChannel 19 is performing a true public service by broadcasting these meetings and I encourage parents, kids and taxpayers to watch them – very closely.\n\nGood job cable guys.\n\nBy the way, I sincerely hope Addison Township and the villages of Oxford and Leonard decide to give the cable commission their rightful shares – i.e. the entire 5 percent – of the cable franchise fees.\n\nThat money should go toward developing and improving public access TV, not fattening these municipalities’ general funds.\n\nUsing that money for anything other than cable services constitutes a sneaky tax in my book.\n\nHypothetical situation – I surveyed 20 Oxford residents whether or not they liked me as a person.\n\nBased on my survey I learned 16 out of 20 answered ‘yes.’\n\nI proudly report in my column that a majority of the people in Oxford like me and I have an 80 percent approval rating.\n\nHow many of you would say that’s an accurate assessment?\n\nHow many of you would say that gets a good feeling for the pulse of the community?\n\nHow many of you would say I’m full of it like a Christmas goose?\n\nThe above hypothetical example has about as much validity and significance as the survey results reported by Oxford Village Manager Mark Slown in last week’s issue.\n\nA pathetic 29 citizens out of 3,540 village residents (or 0.82 percent) answered a survey regarding the village.\n\nApproximately 1,600 surveys were mailed out and it was also available on-line and at the village offices.\n\nI found village officials’ positive reaction to the survey results both amusing and self-delusional – the same reaction I had to former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean’s failed campaign for president.\n\nMy favorite quote was from village President Steve Allen – “Even though it may not have been a scientific survey, it certainly gets a good feeling for the pulse out there.”\n\nBased on those results, there is no pulse!\n\nAs Dr. Leonard McCoy would say, “It’s dead, Jim!”\n\nI don’t think it was even alive to begin with.\n\nMy other favorite quote was from Slown, who said, “I don’t know too many elections where you get a 74 percent approval rating.”\n\nThe manager’s comment was based on the fact that 20 out of 27 survey respondents slightly to strongly agreed with the statement, “I like my local government.”\n\nI’ve got news for you, that is NOT a 74 percent approval rating.\n\nHaving 20 residents out of a population of 3,540 agree with that statement is technically a 0.57 percent approval rating.\n\nTo be fair, we don’t know what the rest of the village thinks because a vast majority of the residents were either too lazy or too apathetic to answer the survey.\n\nWhy should a survey be any different than a typical village election?\n\nHardly anybody runs, votes or cares.\n\nI find it curious village officials didn’t mention what the survey respondents had to say about the form of government they would like to live under.\n\nThree people said “dissolve” or “disband” the village, two people said become a city and one person said remain a village as it has for 128 years.\n\nBased strictly on the survey, the idea of cityhood was rejected 4-2 or by a 2-1 margin. Interesting. . .\n\nBut I’m not dumb enough to attach any real significance to that result because it only reflects six opinions out of 29 survey respondents out of 1,600 mailed-out surveys in a community of 3,540 people.\n\nWho could be idiotic enough to draw any real conclusions from that kind of data?\n\nDrop Black issue! Enough already!\n\nI think Oxford Township Supervisor Bill Dunn is being stubborn to the point of pig-headness about his recommendation to reappoint George Black to the planning commission.\n\nTwice now the issue of Black’s appointment has been failed by the township board. It failed in December by a vote of 3-2 and again in 3-3 deadlock in January.\n\nDespite this, the supervisor has foolishly vowed he will bring the issue back to the board for a third vote or until he gets either four ‘yes’ or four ‘no’ votes.\n\nGranted, Dunn is well within the bounds of the law to do this according to the township attorney, but he’s not acting within the bounds of common sense.\n\nBlack has served on the planning commission for more than 20 years. That’s way too long for any one official – appointed or elected – to serve.\n\nThere are two willing and able candidates – Christopher Bishop and Jack Curtis – who have applied for the planning commission, but were not selected.\n\nI contantly hear officials complain about the lack of citizen volunteers willing to serve on these boards and committees, yet they’re willing to toss aside two perfectly good applicants in favor of someone who should have been replaced years ago.\n\nGood job discouraging future participation.\n\nEither Bishop or Curtis should be appointed instead of continuing to waste the township board’s time (and my patience) with this silly issue. There are plenty of other silly issues to waste time on.\n\nI urge the supervisor to swallow his pride, drop the Black issue and move on. Enough is enough! One person on a board of nine is not worth all this grief.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of our allegedly free society is CHOICE.\n\nIt’s a beautiful little six-letter word that excites libertarians enough to make them soil their copies of Atlas Shrugged.\n\nLiberals on the other hand have mixed feelings about choice.\n\nWhen it comes to abortion, liberals say choice is good. When it comes to schools, liberals say choice is bad and start muttering about how vouchers are evil.\n\nConservatives also have mixed feelings about choice.\n\nWhen it comes to privatizing government services like trash collection and food in prisons, conservatives say choice is good. When it comes to deciding what we watch on television or listen to on the radio, conservatives say choice is bad and call in the Federal Communications Commission to decide for us. (The chilling spirit of McCarthyism lives on in those Congressional Indecency Hearings.)\n\nFor the most part, I think choice is a good thing, especially in elections.\n\nAt its best, choice breeds a competition of ideas and a diverse selection of candidates.\n\nAt its worst, it leads to a choice between the lesser of two evils. At least there’s still a choice.\n\nBut in uncontested elections, there is no choice.\n\nThe outcomes are decided after one vote is cast.\n\nUncontested elections serve no purpose, weaken our representative system of government and worst of all – THEY’RE BORING!\n\nI can stand a lot of things, but not boredom.\n\nThat’s why I’m encouraging Oxford Village voters to have a little fun in the Monday, March 8 election.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive year, the village council election is uncontested.\n\nIncumbent council persons Dave Bailey and Renee Donovan are running unopposed. The election hasn’t even happened and they’ve already won.\n\nSince the outcome is already decided, why not have a little giggle? A few laughs. A chuckle or two.\n\nLet’s write in candidates name instead of voting for the two non-choices on the ballot.\n\nThese write-in candidates can be living or dead, fictional or real, cartoon or flesh-and-blood, residents or non-residents, famous or average, etc.\n\nThe only thing I ask is they be fun!\n\nFor instance, I’m voting for Eric Cartman (a rude, opinionated, foul-mouthed, big-boned fourth-grader who lives in the cartoon town of South Park, Colorado) and Charo (the 1970s/80s-era celebrity who appeared on the Love Boat more times than the cruise ship itself).\n\nI admire Cartman’s take-no-prisoners style of dealing with people and his unique ability to eat his bodyweight in Cheesy Poofs. I also share his deep hatred of Tree Huggin’ Hippies.\n\nI admire Charo’s gratuitous use of the phrase “Cuchi, cuchi!” and the fact she appeared on the Love Boat as “April Lopez” a total of eight times. Twice in Season Four (episodes #93 and #99).\n\nCandidates Cartman and Charo would also give a voice to the two most under-represented and oppressed minorities in Oxford – obese cartoon characters and Spanish-speaking singers/musicians/comedians/actresses who wear low-cut dresses.\n\nTo those who would say it’s wrong to make a mockery of our local election process, I say why?\n\nConstantly having elections with no challengers is a joke anyway – why not treat it like one?\n\nAt least now, I’ve given myself – and hopefully others – a choice, a fun alternative in a boring and sad election that epitomizes our apathy and ignorance.\n\nRemember your vote can’t and won’t make a difference, so be sure to get to the polls early on March 8. Relax, the future of the village is not in your hands.\n\nIn politics and the court of public opinion, perception and appearances loom large.\n\nThe way an elected official or public body’s actions are perceived is just as important – if not more so – as the reality.\n\nAlthough it appears to be perfectly legal for Pat Fitchena to serve as the executive director of the North Oakland Transportation Authority, I don’t believe it looks good to the public or reflects well on either Fitchena, NOTA or the Oxford Township Board. (For the background see my page 1 story.)\n\nLet me start out by saying that I like Pat a lot and I think she’s been a good representative for the people of Oxford, – especially the Average Joes and local business owners – over the last 16 years.\n\nShe’s honest. She’s not afraid to speak her mind. She’s a hard-worker. She’s tough, but fair, and has a good, caring heart that’s as big as all outdoors. I know Pat cares about doing what’s right as much as I do.\n\nThat being said, I don’t think Fitchena should continue to serve as both a township trustee and NOTA director in a permanent fashion.\n\nHer taking the NOTA job for a 90-day interim period was perfectly acceptable and I have absolutely no problem with it. She should be allowed to continue as director until that temporary appointment expires April 15.\n\nBut after April 15 she should choose which job she wants more – township trustee or NOTA director.\n\nGranted, it appears to be legal for her to serve in both capacities, according to township attorney Chris Kaye.\n\nThere’s a state constitutional exception or provision that specifically allows Fitchena to do both jobs because NOTA is an intergovernmental body or interlocal authority.\n\nKaye stated in this case the state constitutional exception “trumps” the Incompatible Public Offices Act and the law governing conflicts of interest, to the extent those laws could ever force her to give up either position.\n\nIt’s my opinion that Kaye’s opinion is correct and the state constitution does trump laws made by the state Legislature. However, just because it’s legal, doesn’t mean it’s the correct or wise thing to do.\n\nI don’t think it ever looks kosher to the public when an elected official is given a salaried position in a government agency over which the governing body the elected official serves on has some degree of oversight.\n\nIn this case, the Oxford Township Board votes on NOTA’s annual budget (as do the other communities involved) and has the power to pull out of the authority any time it wishes.\n\nIt’s true Fitchena could abstain from votes on such issues, but some could say she still has some degree of influence with her fellow officials by virtue of her seat.\n\nAlso, the specter of “political patronage” could raise its ugly head. Some members of the public could say Fitchena was given the job as a political favor which could be later traded in for a vote on a future issue.\n\nAn accusation of “cronyism” could be levied. People could suspect Fitchena was given the job strictly because of the friendships and associations she’s made as a township trustee.\n\nI’m not saying any of this is true, but perceptions and appearances must be seriously considered, especially by elected officials. I would hate to see unfair and untrue accusations hurled at Fitchena, which could make her and the township board look bad.\n\nWe’ve had enough controversy.\n\nThe glue that binds the relationship between elected officials and the public is trust. Anything – be it real or perceived – that damages that trust is harmful to our representative system of government.\n\nElected officials must always be conscious of how their actions will be perceived by the public.\n\nFor much of the voting public, what they think about an elected official is the reality, the facts be damned.\n\nAlthough the appearance of impropriety is not nearly as bad as actually committing an impropriety, the effects of both can be equally damaging to the official, to the public and to the trust that hopefully exists between them.\n\nAs I stated earlier, Fitchena should be allowed to finish her interim directorship of NOTA until April 15, but if she takes the position permanently, she should step down as township trustee. It’s the right move for her, the township board and the public.\n\nNow a few quick words about her main critics on this issue – Oxford Township Trustee Jerry Dywasuk and Orion Township.\n\nI find it interesting that the attorneys for Oxford and Addison townships and the villages of Leonard and Oxford, all agree it’s legal for Fitchena to serve as both township trustee and NOTA director.\n\nI find it interesting the only NOTA community to find anything legally wrong with Fitchena’s dual roles is headed by Orion Township Supervisor Jerry Dywasuk, Sr. – father of Oxford Township Trustee Jerry Dywasuk, Jr., who’s adamantly opposed to her having both jobs. Hmmm. . .\n\nI find it interesting Oxford Township was willing to openly share its attorney opinion letter, but Orion’s letter is concealed under attorney/client privilege, something which can easily be lifted by the client, in this case Orion Township.\n\nI’m inclined to say that Trustee Dywasuk’s opposition to Fitchena having the NOTA job is at least partly based on SOUR GRAPES over Oakland County Sheriff’s Deputy Randy Praski’s failed bid for trusteeship in 2000.\n\nIt’s believed by some that an Attorney General’s opinion stating being a sheriff’s deputy and township trustee (in a community that contracts with the sheriff’s department for police service) are incompatible offices was the main reason for Praski’s defeat.\n\nBut the fact is those public offices are legally incompatible because the sheriff’s department is NOT an intergovernmental body and is therefore NOT covered by the state constitutional exception as NOTA is.\n\nPraski lost. Get over it Trustee Dywasuk.\n\nSafety paths are a good thing.\n\nThey provide pedestrians, young and old, with a safe area to walk, bicycle, run, jog and roller-blade along side busy roads.\n\nThey allow people to get from Point A to Point B without using a motorized vehicle and without becoming road kill.\n\nI’ve got no problem with Oxford Township wanting to build more of them. As newly convicted felon Martha Stewart would say, ‘It’s a good thing.?\n\nHowever, I do have a problem with township officials looking into paying for more safety paths through a dedicated millage.\n\nTownship officials are considering placing a safety path millage proposal on the November 2004 ballot.\n\nThe township board will discuss the issue at a future meeting. Officials tabled it at the March 24 meeting as there were only four board members present and they wished to bring the issue before a full board.\n\nAccording to Treasurer Joe Ferrari, who chairs the safety path committee, no proposed millage rate has been determined yet as the committee is looking for direction from the township board.\n\nI sincerely hope the direction from the township board is NO dedicated millage, NO ballot issue.\n\nIf the township wants more safety paths, let it find the money within its own budget first, before rushing to ask the voters to approve yet another new tax.\n\nI’m sure there’s some extra money (i.e. waste, perks, endless attorney bills, $50,000 payments to settle lawsuits from ex-employees, etc.) floating around in that big ol? budget which could be used for safety paths.\n\nLet’s see what can be collected from the existing budget before the township attempts to milk the cash cows (taxpayers) at the polls.\n\nGovernment has rough, cold hands and taxpayers? udders are pretty sore these days. Moo.\n\nAlso, look into collecting private donations from businesses, service groups and individuals.\n\nIf we can raise nearly $160,000 for a giant playground, surely there are folks willing to donate some bucks for safety paths ? something of genuine importance to community.\n\nIf such a safety path millage proposal does unfortunately make it to the November ballot, I sincerely hope it will be asked ONLY of unincorporated township residents, NOT village residents too.\n\nFerrari told me they’re looking to levy such a millage over the ‘entire township,? including the village, because the ‘eventual goal? is to link the township safety path system with the existing village sidewalk system.\n\nVillage residents already have a sidewalk system, which they have paid for and continue to pay for.\n\nVillage residents should not be subjected to another tax burden, so the township can build what it lacks and what the village already has.\n\nIn my book, that’s not only unfair, it amounts to double taxation.\n\nSpeaking as an overtaxed village resident myself, I can say I would most definitely vote NO on any safety path millage.\n\nAnd you can count on me to encourage others to do the same.\n\nI hope township officials will take what I’ve said to heart.\n\nSee what you can do with what you already have before you ask for more.\n\nAnd remember ? it’s an election year.\n\nIt’s been a long time ? at least 10 minutes or so ? since a public official has angered me as much as Janet Thomas has.\n\nWords cannot even begin to describe the sheer loathing and utter contempt the current vice president of the Oakland Schools Board of Education generates within me.\n\nMuch like a freeloading in-law or sloppy drunk party guest, Thomas doesn’t know when it’s time to leave. Worse still, she’s trying to make it seem like she’s doing us a favor by staying.\n\nEven though all the other ISD board members who oversaw the reign of King James Redmond (Tony Rothschild, Helen Prutow, DiAnne Cagle Leitermann and Carol Borich) have resigned, Thomas remains stubborn and defiant to the end ? much like Marie Antoinette.\n\n‘I made a commitment when I was elected the first time.

There was a clear pattern of on-going gross abuse for years.\n\nEither Thomas was a willing accomplice to all of it or she was so totally blind and embarrassingly incompetent, she honestly didn’t know what was going on ? which still isn’t a defense given her oversight role as a board member.\n\nThe bottom-line is Thomas did not do her duty as an ISD board member. She failed miserably, along with the other board members at the time.\n\nThomas failed the 28 school districts of Oakland County. She failed the school boards, administrators and teachers of Oakland County.\n\nThomas failed the students and parents of Oakland County.

Would you spend about $47,500 to have a gaggle of lawyers tell you to take money out of your left pocket and put it in your right pocket?\n\nOxford Village and Township did.\n\nThe above analogy is the easiest way to understand how the village and township settled their dispute over allegedly improperly spent tax monies. (See story on page 1.)\n\nAfter more than a year of the village attorney and council demanding the township return hundreds of thousands of tax dollars to village taxpayers, in turns out all the township had to do to satisfy the village was repay township internal funds with state revenue-sharing monies and ordinance enforcement revenues.\n\nGo figure.\n\nWhat a colossal waste of time, effort and tax dollars by our so-called leaders. Let’s look at the results:\n\nn The attorneys for both sides are richer with tax dollars.\n\nn Tax money that could have been spent on silly, trivial little things like roads, public services, parks, teen centers, was instead spent on lawyers.\n\nn The village taxpayers (the supposed victims) who were allegedly wronged will receive no rebate checks in the mail.\n\nn According to the consent judgement agreed to and signed by both parties, the village “does not consent, acknowledge or accept that it is the proper party in this litigation” and the township “does not consent, acknowledge or accept that any money is owed to the village or its taxpayers.” Was anybody involved?\n\nn Money from state revenue-sharing and local ordinance enforcement that would have ended up in the township’s General Fund and Building and Site Fund anyway, will be now be put there over a five-year period to offset the amount allegedly misspent ($416,000) by the township for police services in 2000.\n\nn The township will spend this $416,000 as it normally would have, with part of the money financing the township’s operations (General Fund) and the rest be saved to someday build a new township hall (Building and Site Fund).\n\nSo what was the purpose of this costly little exercise in government futility? I have no idea.\n\nWhat was end result? Nothing.\n\nHow is the outcome of the settlement different than if nothing had been done in the first place? It’s not, except for all the attorney bills and a little money shuffled around internally.\n\nDon’t worry, if you’re thinking none of this makes any sense, it’s because it doesn’t.\n\nHowever, if you think it you think it makes perfect sense, congratulations, you have a future in government ? or as a lawyer.\n\nWhat still amazes me about the whole thing is the village’s assertion that’s it was not the “proper party” in this whole legal mess.\n\nAccording to a press release from village President Steve Allen, it was the council’s “belief that it was not the correct party to assert or compromise the rights of its Oxford Township taxpayers (i.e. village taxpayers).”\n\nWait a minute, didn’t the village spent $16,685 in taxpayer money on the high-powered law firm Miller-Canfield to determine how much the township allegedly improperly spent and allegedly owed village taxpayers?\n\nDidn’t Miller-Canfield send a letter to the township demanding money on behalf of the village in August 10, 2001? The letter clearly stated, “We hereby demand payment of such amount, forthwith. The township should forward payment directly to the village (emphasis added).”\n\nDidn’t the council pass a resolution on Sept. 24, 2001 requesting the township repay the allegedly misspent monies directly to village taxpayers? At that same meeting, Allen stated for the record, “We must get the message out to the public that we folks (the council) are willing to get their money back. It’s their money and we recognize it’s their money and it will be coming back to them.”\n\nDidn’t the village spend thousands of dollars in taxpayer money on village attorney Bob Bunting to also handle the whole matter?\n\nFor the village to say it’s not the “proper” or “correct” party is utterly ridiculous and simply not true.\n\nIf the village government isn’t the “proper” or “correct” party, all the tax dollars spent on Miller-Canfield and Bunting should be returned to the village coffers.\n\nHow can the village claim that it’s not the “correct party to assert or compromise the rights of its Oxford Township taxpayers” yet spend village tax money on lawyers to do just that?\n\nHow can the village expend tens of thousands of tax dollars on a matter it now insists it was never a party to?\n\nOh well, the whole matter is over with and all is right with the world again.\n\nThe lawyers are richer. The taxpayers are poorer. And government is at fault.\n\nIn our ever-changing world and fast-paced modern society, it’s nice to know some things stay the same. Why doesn’t that comfort me?\n\n“Hey Wang, what’s with the pictures? It’s a parking lot!” ? Comedian Rodney Dangerfield in “Caddy Shack”\n\nWhile a I wholeheartedly agree with the need for additional parking in downtown Oxford, I must disagree with a few aspects of the Oxford Community Development Authority’s (OCDA) concept plan to reconfigure, resurface and expand the southeast parking quadrant.\n\nThree elements of the plan immediately struck me as completely unnecessary and a total waste of tax money and resources.\n\nThe first is the “pocket park” that’s depicted on the concept plan right behind the Oxford Cinema 7, facing Stanton St.\n\nThe concept plan calls for a small park space consisting of a gazebo, benches and trees.\n\nFirst of all, what a lousy, ugly, silly location for a park.\n\nWho wants scenic views of the back of a movie theater and the Oxford Bank parking lot and drive-thru facilities directly across Stanton? Sounds breathtaking.\n\nSecond, the proposed park area should be used to provide parking, which by the way constitutes a portion of the land’s current use.\n\nGreat idea, eliminate some parking to put in a park in a downtown where one of the main complaints is the lack of parking.\n\nYou don’t need a fancy taxpayer-financed master’s degree in government to see it’s a bad idea.\n\nTo be fair, the plan does increase the total number of parking spaces in the southeast quadrant, but many of those new spaces are located much further away from the businesses than these current parking spaces tenatively slated to become a park.\n\nMost people don’t enjoy walking long ways through parking lots and try to park as close to the businesses as possible. Some of them do it for safety reasons. Some for physical reasons. Many do it out of pure laziness. (I fall into the latter category.)\n\nIf you have parking spaces close to businesses, you don’t eliminate them, especially not for a park.\n\nAlso, why develop a new park when the downtown area already has the extremely under-utilized and under-appreciated Centennial Park?\n\nThe OCDA should be working to attract more people to Centennial ? which already has a gazebo ? rather than trying to turn existing parking spaces into another park.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the owners of Parkside Dairy, John and Holly Thomas, have done more to bring people to Centennial Park ? and downtown Oxford ? than the OCDA has.\n\nAnother example of why if you want something done, look to the private sector, not government.\n\nParkside’s “Concerts in the Park” series attracted people to Centennial every Thursday evening for 11 consecutive weeks this past summer.\n\nHow many times did the OCDA bring visitors to Centennial Park this summer?\n\nOnce ? the Taste of Oxford at Celebrate Oxford.\n\nMy advice, nix the park, leave the existing parking ? maybe even increase the number of spaces in that area ? and focus on improving and cultivating activities in Centennial Park. Use what you already have before you consider building more.\n\nLet’s move on from parks to the arts.\n\nThe concept plan also calls for a “sculptural centerpiece” to be located in the center of a proposed circular drop-off area behind Lynne’s Hallmark, Creative Embroidery and Victoria’s Delights.\n\nWhy do we need a sculpture in a parking lot? It’s not a museum or an historical landmark. It’s a place to store your vehicles while you shop, eat, see a movie, etc.\n\nI’m sure the planners will argue the sculpture is designed to beautify the downtown, increase Oxford’s overall aesthetic value and make people feel good inside, but again, it’s a parking lot. Let’s be realistic.\n\nThe taxpayers ? particularly the merchants who will most likely pay a special assessment for this project ? should not be forced to pay for a sculpture in a parking lot. After all, it’s a parking lot.\n\nFrom the arts we go to trees.\n\nThe concept plan calls for a bunch of trees to be placed on islands throughout the parking lot.\n\nI bet if those islands and trees were eliminated from the plan, a few more additional parking spaces could be squeezed in and a lot of tax money could be saved. The southeast quadrant needs more parking spaces, not trees.\n\nThe bottom-line is when motorists go into a parking lot, they want and expect to find spaces. Businesses want their customers to be able to easily find available parking. The main objectives of the southeast quadrant improvement plan should be to increase the total number of parking spaces and repair the deteriorated lot.\n\nNobody cares about having islands with trees, “pocket parks” with gazebos and “sculptural centerpieces” in their parking lots except pie-in-the-sky planners and officials out of touch with reality and who don’t have to pick up the tab for their grandiose ideas.\n\nEvery time I see one of those Disney movies where a group of kids band together to fight City Hall, it never fails to make me cringe. Allow me to explain.\n\nWe’re all familiar with the movie where the out-of-touch City Council wants to sell a vacant piece of land to an evil developer who wants to build a new subdivision or high-rise on it.\n\nThe only problem is it’s the same land some local kids are using as a playground or have built a clubhouse on.\n\nSo the kids band together, march into City Hall, make a tear-jerking presentation and convince the elected officials to change their old-fogy minds.\n\nIn fact, the presentation is so good it convinces the evil developer to mend his greedy ways and offer to turn the land into something for the kids, free of charge. Everyone cheers and hugs, the day is saved and the credits roll. So why does this type of film bother me?\n\nIt ignores realities, circumstances, regulations, local ordinances and real-life political processes.\n\nIt oversimplifies the way government really works and sets up unreal or false expectations in kids’ minds that could someday lead to severe disillusionment with the political process that underpins our republic.\n\nThat’s what I’m worried is going to happen to the members of the Rockin’ Excellent and Determined Youth (READY) youth who are working to convert the old fire hall into a teen center.\n\nThe way it looks right now, this teen center might not get off the ground for a number of reasons, including funding and zoning ordinance requirements regarding parking and setbacks.\n\nI’m not saying the teen center’s definitely not going to happen, but the parking and setback requirements appear to make it highly unlikely at this point.\n\nIt’s highly unlikely a variance will be granted to resolve the parking issue (i.e. the severe lack of it). It’s also highly unlikely another variance would be granted to allow for a teen center with 7.5-foot and 10-foot setbacks from abutting residential areas, when the zoning ordinance requires a minimum of 100-foot setbacks for indoor recreational facilities.\n\n(Note: There’s a reason we have required setbacks and one of them is noise. A teen center will most likely generate a lot of noise, which could become a nuisance to residents living in such close proximity.)\n\nVariances are not granted “just because” someone wants one. Certain very strict, very narrow requirements, outlined in the zoning ordinance, must be met.\n\nThis isn’t just my opinion. I’ve had a few officials tell me in private that this teen center isn’t going to happen, but they aren’t willing to say so publicly.\n\nWhat I don’t want to see happen is for township or village officials to give READY any preferential treatment, special consideration or bending of the rules because of the nature of the project or the fact that a group of local teens is behind it.\n\nI’m not saying this has been done or even will be done, but I can certainly see where officials not wishing to look like ‘bad guys’ or truly believing in the teen center project themselves, may be tempted to treat READY differently than the average applicant.\n\nWhen discussing the fire hall ownership issue at the Jan. 14 village council meeting, Manager Mark Slown said he wanted the matter settled because “it may block progress toward completion of the teen center later, harming the morale of the READY crew and other young people in the community. This is a risk we must not take.” Slown told council if the teen center proposal “blows up in our faces” there will be a “bunch of unhappy kids and parents.”\n\nSlown’s comments make it seem like the teen center absolutely must happen, no matter what.\n\nAlthough Slown’s sentiments and personal belief in the project are admirable, they’re not appropriate.\n\nIf we really want the community’s youth to learn about local government through this teen center project, they must learn about things like complying with local zoning ordinances. They must be treated like any other applicant wishing to develop something in the village.\n\nOne of the major underpinnings of our political system is that everyone must be treated fairly and equally under the law. No exceptions. But along with fair and equal treatment comes the possibility of rejection and disappointment, as with anything in life.\n\nShielding the READY teens from these more unpleasant aspects of the process for fear of “harming (their) morale” would do them a great disservice and deprive them of a valuable learning experience.\n\nContrary to popular belief in our modern feel-good society, self-esteem is not the most important thing in life. One of the greatest lessons in life is “You can’t always get what you want.”\n\nIf turning the old fire hall into a teen center can’t happen because of a lack of parking or setbacks which are 90 to 92.5 feet short of the legal requirements, READY should not feel discouraged or give up.\n\nREADY could pursue a ballot initiative asking voters to approve money for the construction of a teen center somewhere else. Or they could find another vacant building in Oxford to convert into a teen center. Both are viable alternatives.\n\nThis teen center project is a great real-life opportunity for young people to get involved in local government and see how it really works. I just want our local officials to treat them like everyone else, equally and fairly, even if that means the old fire hall can’t become a teen center. And if it can’t, READY shouldn’t quit.\n\nGood job West Bloomfield!\n\nBravo to the West Bloomfield Board of Education for passing a resolution last week speaking out against the Oakland Schools scandal, thus breaking the “conspiracy of silence” among the county’s 28 districts.\n\nIt’s nice to see that not all school boards are filled with cowards and collaborators. Finally, a group of school officials who actually know the difference between right and wrong.\n\nIn a letter to the editor published in the Feb. 3 Oakland Press, Gabriel Kowalski, of Oxford, asked, “And why aren’t the local school districts raising their voices over the squandering of tax dollars?”\n\nMr. Kowalski I suggest you contact the Oxford Board of Education and ask them. I suggested they speak out on this very issue three weeks ago. Since then, their silence has been deafening.\n\nSome suggestions for school cuts\n\nA Feb. 17 press release from Oxford Area Community Schools stated that in response to decreased state funding, rising operational costs and anticipated budget shortfalls ?\n\n“All buildings and every district department (elementary schools, middle school, high school, athletics, transportation, maintenance and grounds, technology, special education, administration, support staff, food services, curriculum support and administrative support) has been asked to identify about 10 percent in cuts to their particular areas in order to achieve a balanced budget for next year.”\n\nI have a few suggestions to help the district save a huge chunk of money.\n\nFirst, cut the $34,000 in bonuses the district’s top four administrators ? superintendent, assistant superintendent, executive director of curriculum, executive director of human resources ? will be paid at the end of the 2002-03 school year and permanently eliminate such bonuses from future administrator contracts.\n\nWhen finances are tight, you don’t give bonuses. This is a school district, not K-mart.\n\nNext, the top four administrators should each take a temporary 10 percent salary cut ? just until the district’s financial difficulties are over.\n\nThe Big Four currently earn a grand total of $406,228 per year, excluding bonuses.\n\nA 10 percent salary reduction would save the district $40,623 annually.\n\nThen, let’s cut the combined $11,400 per year in monthly stipends the top four administrators receive for “car mileage.”\n\nFinally, eliminate all nonessential, noneducational positions such as the Director of Communications post, which presently commands a salary of about $51,000 annually plus benefits.\n\nAll these cuts I’ve suggested are at the very top (Central Administration) and in no way hinder the actual day-to-day education of Oxford students.\n\nArmed with a calculator and some common sense, I’m proposing $137,023 in budget cuts that don’t affect the classroom ? the place that matters most.\n\nThe press release stated that “As Oxford Schools looks for more ways to streamline, save money and institute possible cost-effective processes, Superintendent Virginia Brennan-Kyro has emphasized that the decisions made must be in keeping with the district mission, and do what’s best for our kids by providing a quality education for every student.”\n\nI feel my cost-cutting suggestions are in keeping with the spirit and letter of the above statement and ask school officials to consider implementing them.\n\nLet’s not just talk about doing what’s best for our kids’ education, let’s actually do it.\n\nLet’s cut from the top-down, not the bottom-up.\n\nThree cheers for private enterprise\n\nWe’ve heard a lot lately about how Oxford needs a teen center, a skate park, more sports fields, more recreational opportunities, more stuff for young people to do, etc. We’ve also heard a lot about paying for these needs with a mixture of tax dollars, private donations and special fund-raisers.\n\nHowever, in all this community discussion, I hadn’t heard the one solution that could fulfill all these needs without costing anyone ? except for users ? a single dime. Until now.\n\nIt seems that a private investment company backed by a wealthy investor wants to build a for-profit sports/recreation center in Oxford Township on M-24 (See page 1 story). What perfect timing.\n\nOxford has a need for more sports, recreational and youth-oriented facilities.\n\nA private investor has the capital to build a facility in Oxford to meet that need.\n\nIn return, the investor wants to make his money back, plus a profit.\n\nIt’s basic supply and demand. It’s the free market. I’m sure the 18th-century economist Adam Smith is smiling somewhere.\n\nI applaud the efforts of the Metamora-based Mack Investment Group, Inc. and investor Anthony Calliea to build something that will directly benefit Oxford and its youth while hopefully turning a profit.\n\nBest of all, it doesn’t involve government or tax dollars. Imagine that.\n\nPlus, a privately owned and operated sports/recreation center means more local jobs, more tax revenue for local governments and a major attraction to draw people to Oxford.\n\nPrivate enterprise is a beautiful thing.\n\nJob opening for former police chief\n\nThrough our sister newspaper The Clarkston News, I learned that the City of the Village of Clarkston’s police department is searching for a new police chief.\n\nWhen I read that, one name immediately sprang to mind ? Gary Ford.\n\nFord’s been out of work since Dec. 31, 1999, his legal bills have been piling up since then, he was denied disability payments from MERS and now he’s suing Oxford for $40,523.\n\nObviously, the poor man needs some money, but just can’t get back on his feet.\n\nGary’s either too proud to ask for help or maybe he just never learned how.\n\nSo Gary, if you’re reading this (and you know you are), give the Clarkston city offices a call at 625-1559 and apply for that police chief position.\n\nLet me know if you need a reference letter.\n\nNo need to thank me.\n\nHelping a down-on-his-luck, publicly-disgraced, ex-police chief facing a criminal trial is its own reward.\n\nI hate to admit it but I must agree with Governor Jennifer Granholm and even applaud her actions.\n\nIn light of the state’s $2 billion budget shortfall and the large number of spending cuts ahead, Granholm said she will cut her own $177,000 annual salary by 10 percent to lead by example, according to the Feb. 24 Oakland Press.\n\nShe’s also encouraging state legislators to take a pay cut as well.\n\nWait just a minute!\n\nA government official is suggesting her own salary be cut by 10 percent because the state’s in a big financial mess.\n\nA government official, who’s preparing to make massive budgets cuts that will affect the lives of many people, wants to lead by example by first cutting $17,700 a year from her own pocket.\n\nA government official is urging other government officials to take a pay cut.\n\nCan this be real? Did a Democrat actually say that?\n\nI sure hope the Oxford school district’s top four administrators are reading this as they face their own budget shortfalls and spending cuts.\n\nMaybe the Educrats will learn a lesson from Granholm. A 10 percent pay cut has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it guys?\n\nI was also forced to agree with another Democrat, Rep. Andy Meisner of Ferndale, who told the Press, “We’re asking people across the state to tighten their belts so I think it’s only fair for us to do the same.”\n\nEgads, fiscal logic from a Democrat! Isn’t that a sign of the Apocalypse? Run for your lives!\n\nNot to be outdone, some Republicans joined in.\n\nRep. Brian Palmer (R-Romeo) introduced an amendment to the state Constitution that would require a 10 percent pay cut for top state elected officials, lawmakers and Michigan Supreme Court justices in the fiscal year after Michigan’s “rainy day” or emergency fund falls below $250 million.\n\nIf approved by lawmakers, the constitutional amendment could be considered by voters in 2004.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Ken Sikkema (R-Wyoming) said he will reduce his pay by 3 percent if state employee unions agree to forgo a planned 3-percent raise to avoid massive layoffs. He urged his fellow legislators to do the same.\n\nOf course, I shouldn’t have to write a column complimenting government officials for wanting to take a pay cut during hard economic times.\n\nIt should be a given. It should be automatic.\n\nIt should be the first thing on the chopping block whenever it’s time for serious spending cuts by any government unit ? federal, state, county, city, township, village or SCHOOL DISTRICT.\n\nToo often public officials aren’t willing to lead by example when it comes to cutting their own salaries, perks and bonuses.\n\nMost officials are perfectly willing to cut services, cut programs, cut personnel and cut others’ wages and benefits, but when the axe nears their own pocketbooks, they come up with a million excuses (all of them lame) as to why they should keep making the big bucks while everyone and everything around them takes a hit.\n\nI’m glad to see Granholm and some responsible state lawmakers ? both Republican and Democrat ? are willing to make cuts that directly affect them, not just others. That’s true leadership ? a quality sadly lacking in all levels of government these days.\n\nAs for the state lawmakers who have attacked Granholm and her call for pay cuts, I say nuts to them.\n\nState Sen. Mike “Go Mike Go!” Bishop (R-Rochester) said Granholm is “trivializing” the budget situation by calling for a “pittance reduction of official’s salaries.”\n\n“I think it’s political pandering at its best,” he told the Press. Then Bishop turned around and said, “Whatever we decide to do (for reducing salaries), I’ll be the first in line to do it.”\n\nMr. Bishop, does your mouth ever get sore from talking out of both sides of it?\n\nBishop’s comments represent mindless partisanship at its best and political double-speak at its worst.\n\nI’m a much more conservative Republican than Bishop and even I can admit Granholm’s call for pay cuts is logical, responsible and an example of real leadership. I don’t like Granholm or what she stands for and I didn’t vote for her in the general election, but I can still recognize a good idea when I hear one, no matter who came up with it.\n\nSome lawmakers said cutting their salaries would be largely symbolic considering the extent of the state budget mess, but meaningful nonetheless.\n\nMy grandparents and parents taught me that every penny counts ? especially when money’s tight ? because in the end, it all adds up.\n\nMany families live by that same motto when it comes to their own simple budgets.\n\nGovernment should live by it too, especially since the money in their budgets is OUR money.\n\nWhether it’s clipping coupons to lower the family grocery bill or shaving a few thousand dollars off government officials’ salaries to help balance the budget, it all adds up in the end.\n\nI hope Oxford Schools’ top administrators remember that every penny counts and take a cue from Granholm’s leadership. If you’re going to cut others, you’d better include yourself.\n\nThank you Oxford AMVETS\n\nI wish to extend my sincere gratitude and a heartfelt thank you to Oxford AMVETS Post 108 for presenting me with a plaque last Wednesday to show their appreciation for the articles and photos I’ve published about them (see page 4).\n\nTheir plaque meant more to me than most of the other awards I’ve received in life because it came from brave souls who have served their country in the armed forces with honor, dignity and courage.\n\nIt was their sacrifices and devotion to duty that made possible the freedom of the press that I enjoy every week. For that, I am eternally grateful.\n\nThumbs up to the Oxford Village Council for voting not to participate in the North Oakland Household Hazardous Waste Consortium (see story page 5).\n\nVillage officials correctly reasoned that because the Oxford Township Board voted to join the Consortium in November 2002, village residents will be able participate in the program as township residents and taxpayers.\n\nIt would have been a waste of money and redundant for the village to pay the fixed $1,092 annual administrative fee to participate.\n\nGranted, because of the village’s decision, the township will be required to pay its $4,140 administrative fee plus the village’s $1,092.\n\nBut that’s okay. Village residents pay 0.95-mill every year to the township so it’s not like the they’re getting a freebie.\n\nWhy shouldn’t village residents pay for this new service through their township taxes as opposed to their village taxes?\n\nBased on economies of scale, paying the $1,092 fee through the township makes more fiscal sense because it’s being drawn from a much larger tax base and budget than the village has on its own.\n\nAs for the $35 per car fee, it doesn’t matter whether the township decides to pay it all, have residents pay it all or some combination where both pay a portion. Village residents will either pay for it from their own pockets if they choose to participate or through their township taxes.\n\nI’m glad council saw the logic of all this, followed the lead of every other village in the Consortium’s coverage area and decided to participate through its township.\n\nManager Mark Slown argued it might be to the village’s advantage to participate in the Consortium and pay the fee so the village could get a “seat at the table,” meaning council would be able to select a representative to the Consortium Board to help oversee the program.\n\nThe manager stated that going through the township “relinquishes all control of the service to another government.” The township is not some alien government.\n\nVillage residents are township residents who help elect township board members. The township board represents each and every village resident.\n\nThe village already has a “seat at the table” through it’s township representative (Shirley Clancy) to the Consortium Board.\n\nIt would have been a waste of tax money on the village’s part to pay $1,092 a year just to have a council member sitting on the Consortium Board.\n\nConstantly “going your own way” for its own sake is not only illogical, it’s quite expensive.\n\nI’m glad council was wise enough to recognize this.\n\n$3,000 for hats! Is the council insane?\n\nWhen village residents pay their property taxes I’m sure most, if not all, of them are under the impression they’re money is going to be spent on little things like roads, police, fire, parks, the Department of Public Works, village administration, etc.\n\nI was shocked and dismayed to learn the village council last week approved paying a $3,000 bill for 250 baseball-style hats embroidered with the new Scripter Park logo. No, this is not a misprint.\n\nCouncil spent $3,000 on hats. Hats!\n\nOfficials said these hats will be used to promote Oxford, given away to local volunteers as tokens of appreciation, possibly sold at Celebrate Oxford and given away as gifts at the village’s annual appreciation dinner, held to recognize all village board members, employees and volunteers.\n\nWords cannot begin to describe what a blatant and idiotic waste of taxpayer dollars these hats are.\n\nWords cannot express how frivolous, unjustifiable, ridiculous, inappropriate and irresponsible it was for the village to spend $3,000 on hats.\n\nThat’s $3,000 in tax money that could have been put toward some legitimate community need, but was instead piddled away on useless hats that do not benefit the residents in any way, shape or form.\n\nSome may say I’m getting a little too upset over a measly $3,000, but as I’ve stressed over and over and over again, every penny adds up, especially when they’re taxpayer pennies.\n\nIt’s the wasting of a few thousand tax dollars here and there for seemingly harmless little things ? like hats ? that eventually adds up to high property taxes.\n\nIt’s easy to spot and rail against the obvious wasting of tax dollars when it’s in the five, six and seven-digit range, but it’s the “$100 for this and $1,000 for that” nobody pays much attention to or questions that nickel-and-dime taxpayers into the poorhouse.\n\nNote to village officials ? Either use the tax money we give you for legitimate government functions that benefit the health, safety and welfare of the residents or lower our taxes and let us keep more of our hard-earned cash.\n\nWe can buy our own hats. Thanks anyway.\n\nNote: In his State of the Village address Monday, council President Steve Allen mentioned how “despite numerous funding challenges, the village has achieved many of its goals.” He went on to list “challenges for 2003-04” which included “decreased revenue sharing due to state budget pressures” and “continual upgrades to aging infrastructure,” which are getting “more expensive every year.”\n\nIf finding funding is such a “challenge” for the village, then stop wasting money on stupid things like hats!\n\nBravo to Lake Orion school administrators\n\nReading the Feb. 26 edition of our sister newspaper The Lake Orion Review, I ran across an interesting little tidbit that I thought deserved some recognition.\n\nIn light of the Lake Orion school district’s budget crunch, the superintendent and assistant superintendents offered to donate back to the district their 2004 salary increases, totalling $10,600.\n\nI was impressed by their gesture because I’m not used to school administrators voluntarily offering to give up money from their own pockets when faced with budget shortfalls. I applaud Lake Orion’s top school administrators for their action. I applaud them for leading by example. Leading by example ? what a novel concept.\n\nPriorities please!\n\nWith the exception of Ron Mutch and Patricia Smith (who was not at the meeting), Oxford School Board members Tuesday expressed their opposition toward contributing any money for a new traffic signal at the intersection of East Burdick (Lakeville Rd.) and Glaspie (North Oxford Rd.).\n\nAlthough they tabled the item, most officials publicly balked at the idea of matching whatever Oxford Township contributes to the new signal, up to $7,500.\n\nA majority of the high-volume traffic that jams that intersection comes from Oxford High School, Oxford Middle School and Lakeville Elementary School.\n\nSince the schools are the biggest contributor to that intersection’s woes, they should put up some money.\n\nThe maximum the district is being asked to contribute is “up to $7,500” for a signal that could cost between $50,000 and $60,000.\n\nSchool officials claim they can’t spare $7,500 or less to help solve a serious traffic flow and public safety problem, yet they can approve $34,000 in bonuses for four top administrators without batting an eye?\n\nWhat are the school board’s priorities? Obviously they’re not the same as the public’s.\n\nGoodbye and thanks to John Thomas\n\nJohn Thomas attended his last Oxford Village meeting Tuesday as a councilman. He chose not to seek re-election after serving a one-year term.\n\nI hate to see John go because he was honest, trustworthy and truly had residents’ best interests at heart. Those qualities will be sorely missed from council.\n\nJohn didn’t play petty politics or have a private agenda. What you saw was what you got.\n\nJohn wasn’t afraid to roll up his sleeves and do some hard work, as evidenced by the return of summer concerts to Centennial Park last year ? which would never have happened if not for him and his wife Holly.\n\nThanks for your sevice to village residents John.\n\nI wish you continued success with your downtown business (Parkside Dairy, Catering and Carry-out) and happiness with your family.\n\nA little clarification\n\nI just wanted to clarify that my criticism of Oxford Village’s spending of $3,000 for baseball caps featuring the new Scripter Park logo was in no way, shape or form meant to portray Creative Embroidery (the Oxford vendor from which the hats were purchased) in a bad light. My opinion was simply that village officials exercised extremely poor judgement by blatantly wasting $3,000 in taxpayer money on something totally unncessary to functioning of a local government and servicing of residents.\n\nI do not blame Creative Embroidery for selling the hats to the village because it was simply providing a service to a customer. It was the customer’s judgement I questioned, not that of the business.\n\nCreative Embroidery acted properly and professionally by providing a quality product and service to its customer for a fair price. In fact, the only positive thing I could possibly say about the village’s purchase of those hats was at least the tax dollars were spent at an Oxford business thereby keeping the money within the community. Creative Embroidery is a fine local business that helps keep downtown Oxford strong.\n\nI wish them nothing but success and longevity.\n\n“We prefer most contact via e-mail if possible. It is more efficient for us to process your\n\nrequest.” ? a message to visitors on State Sen. Mike Bishop’s website\n\nOver the weekend, a local resident sent me copies of e-mails exchanged between herself and State Sen. Mike Bishop (R-Rochester) that I found quite interesting and definitely worthy of sharing.\n\nI believe this e-mail exchange offers a rare and honest glimpse into what politicians really think of the public when they’re not shaking hands, marching in parades or prostituting themselves for votes.\n\nGiven Bishop represents the Oxford and Addison areas, I thought his constituents would especially enjoy reading how their state senator actually feels about their thoughts and opinions.\n\nIt all began when Oxford resident and Republican Robin Moore sent an e-mail to Bishop on March 14 that both complimented and criticized the newly-elected state senator. Her e-mail read:\n\nDear Rep. Bishop,\n\nI am proud to know you are working hard to hold off Canadian trash ? thank you! However, I take issue with any whining you might do in response to Gov. Granholm’s suggestion that state legislators take a pay cut. Grow up a little, k? Thanks!\n\nThe next morning Moore received an e-mail from Bishop which simply read, “Get a life.”\n\nMoore reponded to Bishop’s sarcastic remark by e-mailing the message, “Isn’t that classy? Thank you for responding.”\n\nWithin the hour, Moore received another e-mail from Bishop which stated:\n\n“This e-mail address is no longer available to the receiver of this automated message. Your name and e-mail address has been added to the ‘block sender’ list. We’re sorry that we had to close dialog with you, but the host has authorized blocking in the event our system is abused or used counter-productively. Very few have violated the decorum of our system. In fact, since the inception of this web address, you are only the 6th name to be added to this list.\n\nIf you feel your name has wrongly been added to the ‘block sender’ list please contact our office and we will take action immediately. ?

God bless America.\n\nBishop’s overall response to Moore epitomizes the true attitude many politicians have toward the people they allegedly represent ? “Vote for me, then shut up and go away until I need your vote again.” Or as W.C. Fields once remarked, “Go away kid, you bother me!”\n\nI spoke with Bishop Tuesday about his e-mail exchange with Moore and he stood by his actions, characterizing her message as “sarcastic,” “rude” and “very abusive.”\n\n“I characterize it as abusive any time people take advantage” of the e-mail system,” he said.\n\nOf Moore’s remark, “Grow up a little, k?” Bishop said, “That offends me deeply.”\n\n“I’m really offended by those out there with a seek and destroy mentality,” Bishop said.\n\nOf his “Get a life” comment to Moore, Bishop said he merely “responded in kind” and was being “stern” with her. “I wanted her to know that I’m a human being,” he said.\n\nBishop said Moore was blocked from the e-mail system because she “abused the privilege.”\n\nBishop said he spends a lot of his free time personally responding to e-mails and a message such as Moore’s “upsets” him and “ruins my ability to communicate with people effectively.” The senator challenged other elected officials to communicate with their constituents as much as he does.\n\nHey Mike, you want to know what I’m doing right now? I’m playing the worldest saddest song on the worldest smallest violin just for you.\n\nIf your skin is that paper-thin, you shouldn’t hold public office. Moore’s innocuous comments certainly didn’t merit your insulting and over-the-top response. You went overboard Mike, off the deep end.\n\nEven if you were severely offended by her e-mail (which I think is a bunch of mule muffins), as a public official you should have risen above the urge to strike back like a vengeful, immature child.\n\nYou need to either get a life or grow up a little, k? How about a nice anger management course, k?\n\nBishop also wanted it noted that the e-mail address Moore was blocked from sending messages to was his private account, not his state one. But I must note that her original e-mail was sent to his state account and he responded using his private e-mail.\n\nI urge readers to contact Mr. Bishop at both his state address mike@gomikebishop.com and his private account MikeBishop@comcast.net and tell him what you think of his snotty attitude toward Mrs. Moore. If he doesn’t respond, send two or three e-mails just to make sure he gets the message.\n\nBut be careful what you write. We musn’t hurt the poor “widdle” senator’s delicate feelings.\n\nJust in case any local government officials were pondering asking for a tax increase this year, I thought I’d give them a heads up as to the overall mood of Michigan voters.\n\nThe March report from the Citizens Research Council (CRC) of Michigan indicated that of the 187 proposed tax increases across the state on the November 2002 ballot, a whopping 126 were rejected by voters.\n\n“Tax rate increases accounted for 60 percent of the tax issues electors voted on in the 2002 general elections. Only about one-third of these issues received voter approval,” according to the report.\n\nOn the county level, voters sunk 23 of the 35 proposed tax increases.\n\nOn the city level, six out of 10 potential tax hikes met with defeat.\n\nTownship voters torpedoed 88 of their 132 proposed increases.\n\nSpecial authorities fared the worst with voters saying ‘no’ to nine out of 10 proposed hikes.\n\nVoters weren’t in the mood to override the Headlee Amendment either, according to the CRC’s report.\n\nOf the 17 proposed Headlee overrides on the November 2002 ballot, 15 were rejected.\n\nCounty voters rejected all four of their Headlee overrides, city voters rejected their six and township voters failed five of their seven.\n\nAlthough most voters didn’t want their taxes raised according to the CRC report, the majority were willing to renew the ones already in place.\n\nOf the 92 tax renewals requested statewide, 88 were approved.\n\nTax renewals went five for five on the county level, four for four in cities and two for two in special authorities.\n\nTownship voters gave thumbs up to 77 of their 81 renewal requests.\n\nThe report’s summary stated that “Overall, electors were willing to continue the levy of taxes that were previously authorized, but approved the authorization to collect new taxes, increase tax rates, or override Headlee rollbacks on only about one-third of the ballot issues.”\n\nIn other words, the majority of Michigan voters are not so much “anti-tax” as they are “anti-new tax” and “anti-tax increase.”\n\nVoters are willing to keep paying the same taxes for the same services, but no more, no extras, no frills.\n\nI also believe voters are currently more willing to approve millages for absolute necessities as opposed to non-essential luxuries.\n\nThis point was illustrated by the fact that 77 of the 113 (or 68.1 percent) millages involving public safety were approved while millages for parks and recreation were passed only 37.5 percent of the time (nine out of 24), according to the report.\n\nOxford voters mirrored this statewide trend in the 2002 elections by approving a millage renewal for Oakland County Sheriff’s service contract while failing a tax increase for the parks and recreation department.\n\nGovernment officials contemplating tax increases for 2003 should look long and hard at these numbers ? and the overall economy ? and ask themselves, “Is a tax increase a good idea this year?”\n\nThe wise official would say, “No.”\n\nI hope all of our local officials possess such wisdom. Just because you can ask for more money, doesn’t mean you should.\n\n‘Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.?\n\n? Animal Farm by George Orwell\n\nOxford is a community with one fire department owned by two governments ? one existing inside the other ? and overseen by a third unit of government consisting of 12 elected officials from the other two governments.\n\nIt’s hard to read that statement without going cross-eyed.\n\nDon’t worry if the opening paragraph sounds complicated, confusing or just plain stupid ? it is.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s a completely accurate description of the inefficient, cumbersome and redundant system under which the Oxford Fire Department is governed.\n\nNo sane, logical or intelligent person could possibly argue that this arrangement functions well and should be preserved for the ages.\n\nFortunately, Oxford Township decided a few weeks ago that it was time to stop the madness, simplify things and move toward placing the fire department under its direct control.\n\nGranted, it was a decision that should have been made three years ago, but government moves a lot slower than the real world.\n\nThe justification behind township ownership and operation of the fire department can be summed up in one simple statement ? ‘Every Oxford resident is a township resident.?\n\nThat’s all residents need to remember as they witness this intergovernmental tug-of-war unfold.\n\nWhether you live in the village or the unincorporated areas, whether you live on Hudson St. or Seymour Lake Road, whether you live in the Burdick Woods Condos or Red Barn subdivision, whether you’re served by the village police or county sheriff, one thing remains the same ? WE ALL LIVE IN OXFORD TOWNSHIP.\n\nWe can all vote for the seven members of the township board.\n\nWe can all run for seats on the township board.\n\nWe are all equally represented by the township board.\n\nWe all pay township taxes, which include the fire bond approved in 2000.\n\nIt makes perfect sense that the one government under which everyone is an equal part, be the single entity under which the fire department, that also serves everyone equally, is owned and operated.\n\nI’m not going to launch into some infantile debate over whether the ownership split between the township and village is 82-18, 77-23 or 50-50 because the undisputable fact is Oxford taxpayers own 100 percent of the fire department.\n\nEvery property taxpayer, from Oxford Lakes to Waterstone, owns an equal share of the fire department because each pays the same property tax rates to support it. Equal ownership demands equal representation in both government and business.\n\nHowever, the Oxford Public Fire and EMS Commission (OPFEC) does not represent all township and village residents equally and fairly.\n\nVillage residents can vote for the five village council members and seven township board members that makeup OPFEC, while unincorporated township residents can only vote for the latter.\n\nThe five village council members that sit on OPFEC do not have any accountability ? direct or otherwise ? to unincorporated township residents, yet they hold veto power over all board actions.\n\nWhile I’m sure village members of OPFEC try their hardest to temper their decisions with what’s best for the fire department and community as a whole, in the end they are elected to represent village interests and are accountable only to village voters.\n\nIt’s therefore reasonable to assume OPFEC’s village contingent is somewhat skewed or biased toward doing what’s best for the village as opposed to the township and fire department.\n\nIn essence, village residents have double the political representation and rights under OPFEC than unincorporated township residents. That’s wrong.\n\nThe residents of Dennsion St. should be entitled to no greater voice in the fire department’s operations than the residents of Newman Road and vice versa.\n\nOne of the founding principles of this great Republic of ours is that we are all equal at the ballot box.\n\nBut under the flawed OPFEC, to quote George Orwell’s 1945 classic Animal Farm, ‘All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.?\n\nIt’s time for the pigs, horses, cows and chickens to put their house in order before it burns down.\n\nI hear a lot of talk about the need for one government in Oxford.\n\nWe already have that under the township.\n\nLet’s stop trying to reinvent the wheel.\n\nWe don’t need OPFEC or any other type of fire board. We need less bureaucracy, not more.\n\nOne fire department requires one government that represents everyone equally, not three governments that represent chaos and inequity.\n\nC.J.Carnacchio is an Oxford Township resident and taxpayer who resides in the Village of Oxford on Park St.\n\n‘It is a general popular error to suppose the loudest complainers for the public to be the most anxious for its welfare.? ? Edmund Burke\n\nI was thumbing through some of my old files last week when I ran across an e-mail exchange that I thought would interest readers.\n\nThese communications were particularly interesting in light of the village’s renewed drive toward seceding from the township and becoming a city.\n\nDated Sept. 12, 2002, the e-mails were from village Manager Mark Slown and village President Steve Allen to the village council.\n\nSlown’s e-mail stated:\n\n‘Dear Council,\n\nAfter Ian Hill’s encouragement yesterday, and after reflection overnight, I strongly recommend the Council consider passing a resolution authorizing an Oxford Community Government Charter Commission be established to craft a new government Charter and a ballot proposal on creation of one government for the entire community with the details to be worked out by the charter commission under advisement from all interested parties in a series of public hearings, and a majority vote in a general election of both the Village and Township required for approval of the new charter. This government change will be a complex and difficult process with many challenges…\n\nI suggest the only absolute restrictions would be\n\n1) Village and township employees not retained in the new government must be properly cared for in closing agreements with their current employers.\n\n2) Village residents would not lose any Village government services which they currently enjoy that a majority of them desire to retain.\n\n3) New elections for newly created elected positions will be held after the charter is approved while the existing governments remain as caretakers until the new government is established.\n\nThe form of government (Township, Council-manager, strong or weak mayor, etc) would not matter as long as these conditions were achieved.\n\nLet us act on our responsibilities, as we are able, to achieve a more efficient single government in Oxford. Let us break down the old barrier between the Village and the Township governments to make one whole and more healthy community.?\n\nIn response, Allen wrote to council:\n\n‘For those of you that missed last night’s event, it was a life-altering experience. Mark has heard the message and believes. I have heard the message and believe as well. This is scary stuff, but change always strikes us that way.?\n\nFrom one government for all to cityhood for some, what a difference nine months can make.\n\nI guess ‘the message? had a shelf life.\n\nI also find it interesting that while village officials and some residents are pursuing cityhood, there is a contingent of Oxford Lakes residents researching how to have their subdivision annexed by the township.\n\nUnfortunately, I have not had any direct contact with these individuals nor do I know who they are or their numbers.\n\nAll I know right now is that some Oxford Lakes residents approached a township official about detaching from the village and becoming part of the unincorporated township. Apparently, these individuals are tired of suffering under the village’s high tax burden.\n\nObviously, not all village residents are on board with the cityhood idea. Some would like to be directly governed by the township with no village in between.\n\nI urge them to contact me because I would very much like to write an article about their efforts.\n\nIt’s critical that all possible aspects of Oxford’s future governance ? be it in a singular or plural form ? are explored in detail and presented to the public.\n\nOver the last few weeks, the reports on the village’s effort to become a city have been a somewhat one-sided because no public opposition has reared its head.\n\nNow is the time for opponents to speak their minds.\n\nThe future of Oxford is being discussed right now.\n\nEveryone needs to join in that discussion, not just the village’s pro-cityhood folks. Don’t be afraid to express a different or unpopular opinion.\n\nWho will govern Oxford and how it will be done are the two most important questions facing all residents. Each demands an informed answer.\n\nDon’t just sit on the sidelines of History, get in the game and win one for the future.\n\nI urge all those involved in the debate over Oxford’s future to remember what the 19th century Southern Senator John Randolph told his fellow legislators, ‘Change is not reform!?\n\n‘How can (a man) be free if the fruits of his labor are not his to dispose of, but are treated, instead, as part of a common pool of public wealth? Property and freedom are inseparable: to the extent government takes one in the form of taxes, it intrudes on the other.?\n\n? ‘The Conscience of a\n\nConservative? by Barry Goldwater\n\nMuch of my mental attention as of late has been devoted to the renewed campaign to tranform the Village of Oxford into the City of Oxford (or the City of the Village of Oxford if we were to follow Clarkston’s example).\n\nOne of the major issues that concerns me is the ability of cities to levy income taxes, something townships and villages are NOT empowered to do.\n\nWhen I was growing up in Detroit, my father, Joe, constantly complained about having to pay a city income tax in addition to the ones imposed by the federal and state governments.\n\nThe City of Detroit was able to tax my family’s home through property taxes then confiscate a portion of my father’s hard-earned paycheck through its income tax.\n\nEven though I was just a youngster, I knew this wasn’t right. It was double-dipping, double-taxation. Local government taxes your property, it doesn’t need to rape your income as well. Ever since then, I’ve opposed the concept of city income taxes.\n\nThankfully, state law requires voter-approval before a city can levy an income tax.\n\nVoter-approval is a proper and necessary safeguard because our elected officials can’t always be trusted, especially when it comes to the power to tax, wh"
