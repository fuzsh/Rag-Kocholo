        "text": "Julian Crane is a fictional character from the American soap opera Passions portrayed by original cast member Ben Masters.\n\nIn the soap's early years, Julian is portrayed as a drunken philanderer who shares an antagonistic, loveless marriage with his wife of over twenty years, Ivy Crane. Though he tries to exude an image of confidence and power, Julian is in actuality desperate for his father's approval and becomes something of a villain, aiding his father in his attempts to separate Julian's sister, Sheridan, from her fianc√©, Luis."
