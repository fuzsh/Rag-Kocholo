He passed from this life on June 10, 2024, at his home in Winthrop, Arkansas, but now lives in glory with His Lord and Savior.\n\nStevie was the son of Steven Gary Crawford Sr., and Kathy Marie (Sanderson) Schiffman. He moved with his family from California to De Queen, Arkansas in 1977, where he grew up with his siblings and cousins. He loved his wife of 34 years, Terrie (Cook) Crawford, more than any earthly thing, and his children and grandchildren were his pride and joy. He was highly active in his children’s activities, almost never missing a sporting event, choir concert, or any other activity that his kids were involved with. With anything that his kids took interest in, he always made it a priority to support them and help them in any way he could.\n\nPrior to a traumatic brain injury in 2005, Stevie held many colorful blue-collar jobs starting as an 11-year-old changing truck tire flats at the family’s local Fina station; and later as a 16-year-old hod carrier, moving up quickly to journeyman, traveling throughout the United States doing construction. He later drove a truck in Tuscon, Arizona, before making a stop back in De Queen to take a job on a hog farm for the summer, before going back to Arizona. His plans hit a hiccup when he met a little red headed young lady who he said, “detained him 12 years” from getting back to Arizona, which he loved. Riding in the desert in his four-wheel drive was his “blood pressure medicine,” as he called it. Taking many for the rides of their lives. He later took up photography which included many beautiful desert scenes.\n\nHe worked in industrial construction, quickly becoming a journeyman with Tri-Lakes in Gillham. He spent much of his time at the Valliant paper mill, and later as a welder/fitter for other companies. At the time of his TBI, Stevie was pastoring a church and working two jobs to support his family in Arizona. His strong work ethic is carried on through his children.\n\nHe surrendered to preach in February 1999 and was sent on the mission field to Wickenburg, Arizona in 2001 by Geneva Missionary Baptist Church. He later went on to pastor Maranatha Missionary Baptist Church in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as served as interim pastor to two other Missionary Baptist churches in Arizona. He loved all of his Arizona church families dearly. He was currently serving as pastor at Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Ashdown, AR, all of whom he loved dearly.\n\nStevie loved his Heavenly Father more than anything, and his dedication to the Lord was evident in all aspects of his life, especially his daily study of The Word.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his father, Steven Crawford, Sr.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Terrie Lynn; his son, Caleb Andrew Crawford (Cora)of Branson, MO; his daughter, Kaytlynn Maye Franklin (Keith), Dierks, AR; his grandsons, Byron Andrew, Foster Steven, and Nolan Carl Crawford; his mother, Kathy Schiffman, Temple, TX; his brother, Ronald Crawford (Nicole), Shorewood, IL; his sister, Michelle Worley, Nashville, AR; his in-laws who loved him like a son: JL and Lorene Presley, De Queen, and Harley and Debbie Cook of Longview, TX; two brothers-in law: Larry Cook, Texarkana, AR and Waylan Cook, De Queen, AR, a host of special nieces, nephews, cousins, aunts, uncles, close friends and brethren in Christ.\n\nFuneral Services for Mr. Stevie Crawford will be held at 10:00 A.M.
