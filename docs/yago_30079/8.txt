Nicholas Foxworth Crane (Fox) is Ivy and Julian�s son. He always felt as though his mother ignored him growing up and eventually she sent him away to several boarding schools before he made his home back in Harmony. Ivy had such a hard time with Fox being around because he always served as a reminder to her that she had chosen love over money, which she thought was a mistake. Fox was never able to forgive Ivy and even harbored resentment towards Ethan since Ivy always showed favoritism to him. He was a troublemaker in each of the boarding schools he went to, all the way through college. He was also a spoiled young man and was the only heir to the Crane's family fortune.

Upon returning to Harmony, it became apparent that no one was excited to see him return, although it amused him at all the things that had changed while he was gone. Everyone also had learned that he gambled away all his money. He met Theresa, his father's wife, and he quickly started building a relationship with her, although it was not a pure relationship. It was mainly to upset his family because they detested her. But as their relationship grew, he knew there was much more to Theresa and her scheming ways that he wanted to learn about.

As soon as he met Whitney Russell, he began feeling very strongly about her. He pretended to be friends to Whitney and Chad by giving relationship advice, which is something he learned from Theresa. They both schemed together to help each other get what they wanted. Theresa was trying to get Ethan away from his wife and child and Fox needed help getting Whitney away from Chad so she would be his. Although the plan sounded great at first, Fox was still cautious because he felt Theresa would be putting Ethan and Gwen�s child at risk. As the plan unfolded, Sarah did die partly due to some of their actions. Theresa tried to convince him that God wanted this to happen so they could be with the ones they love. The plans failed and Ethan did not end up with Theresa and Fox still felt very strongly for Whitney and continued trying to break her and Chad up. Fox�s father talked with Chad about the situation and made Fox realize the way to get the woman he loves is to stop trying to hurt her. So he settled for Theresa, although he did not love her, but he decided he could not have Whitney, his true love.

Fox and Theresa did become close friends and even slept together one night. He always had her back and supported her, even if he did not agree how she was going about getting what she wanted. He also was her support after losing custody of her son. He played a big part in helping Theresa steal the fertilized egg (Ethan�s and Gwen�s) that was supposed to be implanted into a surrogate. He even tried to tell her that secretly seducing Ethan might hurt her chances at the pregnancy. They finally talked about their true feelings for each other. She knew that he still loved Whitney and he admitted to it and Theresa was honest about betraying Fox.

Fox and Whitney ended up getting together and she ended up getting pregnant. Fox was so excited about becoming a father and started making the plans. Fox gave Whitney his power of attorney because he was going to have to leave Harmony for a while. He wanted to make sure she had what she needed in case something happened while he was gone. He was gone to help Ethan rescue Gwen and Katherine and while away, Whitney gave birth to a baby boy. His excitement soon ended when he found out that Whitney had already given the baby up for adoption by using his power of attorney. He tried to get custody of his son back but was unsuccessful. He could not help his feelings for Whitney. He still loved her no matter how angry he was about this. He also found out that the baby was never even his, but Chad's and that he was the one who adopted the baby.

Fox moved on and fell deeply in love with Kay Bennett and started helping her raise her daughter Maria. He was worried when Miguel came back to Harmony and afraid that she might not be over him yet. He shifted his focus and to provide for them and became a successful executive at Crane Industries.

He could not shake his jealousy of Miguel though and, watching Kay grow close to him again brought out the Crane in him. Joining forces with his father, he plotted to keep Kay and Miguel apart. First, they hired actors to fake being Miguel and Charity to convince Kay that he had gone back to her. Then Fox hired Spike to run him over to make it appear as though Miguel had tried to kill him. Through all of this, Kay couldn't fight her feelings for Miguel. Finally Fox faked that he was dying of a terminal illness, a fraud complicated when he was giving a dangerous medication that made him really ill. Once he recovered, this deception was exposed and Kay finally left him. As the couple moved to divorce, Fox began seeing Esme after she came back to town. He invited her and her niece to live at the mansion when they had nowhere else to go. After Fox and Esme made love for the first time, he was murdered.
