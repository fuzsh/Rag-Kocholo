You cannot reserve a seat to a session on this site; if a session looks \"full\" it’s only because we input the capacity of the rooms. All sessions at LeakyCon are first-come first-serve except for the autograph and photo-booth sessions that indicate otherwise. Lit programming may still only be attended by those who have a Lit badge (these are now sold out). Again: you do not have to sign up for this site or use it in any way in order to go to any event at LeakyCon. it’s a way for you to find other people who are interested in the same things you are, and a way for you to show your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and beyond what you’re interested in at the conference.
