You may be looking for the witch named after her.\n\nLily Potter (née Evans) (January 30, 1960 – 31 October, 1981) was a Muggle-born witch, the younger daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Evans and the sister of Petunia. She learned that she was a witch as a child, after Severus Snape, a wizard boy who lived nearby, recognised her as a witch and told her of the existence of magic. The two became close friends, but their friendship became strained over the years due to Snape's interest in the Dark Arts and his interest in joining the Death Eaters. Lily ended the friendship in their fifth year, after Snape called her a Mudblood. She attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1971 to 1978 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. A talented student, Lily was a member of the Slug Club and was made Head Girl in her seventh year.\n\nAfter Hogwarts, Lily married James Potter and they had a son, Harry. She, James, and James's friends (Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew) all joined the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War; she and her husband defied Lord Voldemort himself three times. However, Lily and James were forced to go into hiding after a prophecy was made concerning Lord Voldemort and their infant son. James and Lily were betrayed by Peter Pettigrew to Lord Voldemort. Lily was murdered by Voldemort in 1981, along with her husband, while they were trying to protect their son. Lily briefly appeared again through the Resurrection Stone, along with James, Sirius and Remus in 1998. After the Second Wizarding War, Lily had three grandchildren through her son, Harry Potter; James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter, who was named after her grandmother.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nLily was born to Mr. and Mrs. Evans, two Muggles of the Evans family, on January 30, 1960. She had an older sister named Petunia, and the family lived in Cokeworth,[2] England. At the age of nine, Lily became friends with Severus Snape, who lived down in Spinner's End, which was within walking distance of the Evans' house. However, they were were apparently not as poor, since Petunia sneered at Snape for coming from that poverty-stricken neighbourhood. Severus was the first person to tell Lily that she was a witch, and he went on to teach Lily a great deal about the wizarding world while the two eagerly awaited the time when they could attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry together. Originally, Petunia and Lily were quite close, but her magical abilities and her friendship with Severus caused problems between the sisters. Envying her sister's abilities, Petunia wrote to Dumbledore, asking if she could attend Hogwarts with Lily.\n\nLily bought her wand from Ollivanders Wand Shop in Diagon Alley at the age of eleven. The wand was 10¼\" willow, \"swishy\", and, according to Mr. Ollivander, good for charm work.\n\nHogwarts years\n\nAt the age of eleven, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she was sorted into Gryffindor house. She became quite skilled at Potions and perhaps Charm, attracting the attention of Professor Horace Slughorn, who made her a member of his Slug Club.\n\nIn her fifth year, Lily stood up for her then best friend — Severus Snape — when he was being bullied by James Potter, whom she considered to be an arrogant toe-rag. She had addressed James by his surname —James himself having called Lily by hers — and attempted to stop his bullying. Snape lashed out at her in his humiliation, calling her a \"Mudblood.\" [3] Severus begged for Lily's forgiveness and she, in turn, asked him if he still intended to join the Death Eaters. When he did not deny this, Lily realized that Snape did not understand what was wrong with the Death Eaters.\n\nThis led to a parting of ways between Lily and Snape, as the former had already become dismayed by Snape's fascination with the Dark Arts, and his friendship with his Slytherin house-mates Mulciber and Avery, both of whom were aspiring Death Eaters. Harry would later witness the scene of his father's bullying and his mother's ambiguous intervention twice via a pensieve, as well as other scenes depicting his mother's friendship with Snape.[4]\n\nBy Lily's fifth year, James was repeatedly asking her out, but she refused him, calling him an \"arrogant toerag\" because he bullied other students, particularly Severus Snape. James's best friend Sirius Black later commented that James could not resist showing off and making a fool of himself whenever she was around. Lily did not, however, hate James. While she didn't approve of his bullying, she did admire how James stood up for his friends and other people who were cruelly treated by Snape's aspiring-Death Eater friends.[3]\n\nDuring their seventh year, James matured greatly, proving himself to be responsible and brave. This led to her finally agreeing to go out with him; and Lily's attraction to him grew into genuine affection and eventually love. The young couple were chosen to be Head Boy and Head Girl.[5]\n\nIn late 1977, Lily and James had a disastrous first meeting with Petunia and her then-fiancé, Vernon Dursley,[6] which presumably took place over Christmas break, as they were both still at Hogwarts. When Vernon tried to impress James with his car, the wizard in turn boasted of his own material wealth, and a row ensued.[6] The evening ended with someone storming out of the restaurant and Lily bursting into tears.[6]\n\nPetunia was married by the end of 1977. Though Lily and James were invited to the wedding, Petunia refused to have Lily as a bridesmaid, upsetting her deeply. [6] At the reception, Vernon would not talk to James, but described him as \"some magician\" within his earshot.[6]\n\nMarriage and the Order\n\nSometime after graduating from Hogwarts in 1978, Lily and James married, with Sirius Black serving as James' best man.[7] Petunia and Vernon refused to attend the wedding.[6] Lily had little contact with her sister from that point.\n\nLiving off James' family fortune, the Potters became full-time members of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, along with their friends Sirius, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.[8] During the war, they defied Voldemort on at least three occasions, the first being when they refused to join his cause when he tried to recruit them.[9]\n\nLife in hiding and death\n\nLily became pregnant in the autumn of 1979. Around the same time,[10] Sybill Trelawney made a prophecy in front of Albus Dumbledore, predicting that \"the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches\" and would be born at the end of July to parents who had \"thrice defied\" him.[3] The first part of the prophecy was overheard by Lily's ex-friend, Snape, who had since become a Death Eater.[11] He loyally reported what he had heard to his master, and was horrified when Voldemort came to believe that Lily's son was the subject of the prophecy.[11][12] It was the threat to Lily that led Snape to change sides, warning Dumbledore of the Dark Lord's plans, and vowing to do anything to keep the woman he still loved safe. It was this vow, based upon Snape's continuing devotion to Lily, that made Dumbledore certain of his double agent's true loyalties.\n\nThe Potters went into hiding while Lily was still pregnant.[8] Their son, Harry James Potter, was born on 31 July, 1980. Due to the danger they were in, Lily and James chose to keep Harry's christening a \"very hurried, quiet affair\" with Sirius Black as the only guest.[13][14] The couple also chose Sirius to be Harry's godfather.[7] Lily sent a birth announcement to Petunia; it was to be the last piece of mail she ever sent her sister.[6]\n\nIn a letter to Sirius dated around Harry's first birthday in July 1981, Lily mentioned that the family had a pet cat, and relayed a story about Harry flying on the toy broomstick Sirius had given him as a birthday present.[4] The Fidelius Charm was placed on their home in Godric's Hollow. Their Secret-Keeper, Peter Pettigrew, was chosen as a less likely choice than Sirius Black, but he betrayed the Potters by telling Voldemort of their whereabouts.[15]\n\nOn October 31 in 1981, Voldemort entered their home. James told Lily to take Harry and leave while he held him off. James, however, was killed before Lily and Harry could escape the house. Trapping mother and son in Harry's nursery, Voldemort, honouring Snape's request to spare her life, offered Lily a chance to step aside. She steadfastly refused to stop shielding her son, and Voldemort killed her. Because Lily's death was a pure sacrifice (she intended to die, and was not hoping to save herself) Harry was marked with the protection of her love, and Voldemort's Killing Curse rebounded off the one-year old, destroying the Dark Lord's body and temporarily defeating him. If not for Snape's love for Lily, which led to him to beg Voldemort for Lily's life, her death would not have been a willing sacrifice, and there would have been no Boy Who Lived. [4]\n\nPost-mortem\n\nHowever, that would not be the last Harry would see of his mother. During his first year at Hogwarts, he stumbled upon the Mirror of Erised and saw his parents beside him, along with his grandparents and other ancestors. At the end of the first year, Hagrid gave him a photo album filled with pictures of his family. In his third year, whenever he encountered a Dementor, he was forced to relive his parents' deaths.\n\nIn Harry's fourth year while duelling with Voldemort in the Little Hangleton graveyard, they experienced Priori Incantatem and shades of his mother and father and others which Voldemort's wand had killed came out of Voldemort's wand to help Harry in his escape from the graveyard.\n\nIn Harry's fifth year, he entered Severus Snape's memory of being bullied by James and Sirius via the use of Pensieve and saw his mother standing up for Snape. In 1998, he relived that same memory of Snape's, as well as many others containing his mother. Finally, during the final battle when Harry believed himself to be walking to his own death, he used the Resurrection Stone to bring back the spirits of Lily, James Potter, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin. Both James and Lily told Harry that they were so very proud of him, proud of his outstanding courage and strength, and assured him that they would stay with him until the very end. Harry described their very presence as his courage, the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other, with Lily smiling at him, and James nodding encouragement.\n\nLily's only granddaughter was named after her.[4]\n\nPhysical description\n\nLily was a very pretty woman with thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders and bright green almond-shaped eyes.[4] Apparently, her bright green eyes were extremely distinctive, because every person who knew Lily would always see them in Harry.\n\nPersonality and traits\n\nLily was known for being an exceptionally kind-hearted and talented witch, becoming Head Girl in her final year at Hogwarts. She also was an all-time favourite of her Potions Master, Professor Horace Slughorn, who noted that she was witty and charming, as well as having a knack for potions.[16] Remus described her as having a habit of seeing the best in others, even when they could not see it themselves, though her good opinion, once lost, was gone forever. On at least one occasion she called out James and Sirius for their bullying of Severus Snape while Remus sat by and did nothing. Her actions were not, however, effective.\n\nWhen in a temper, Lily had a sharp tongue, and had no trouble standing up to others. She had strong principles, ending her friendship with Snape when she could no longer tolerate his fascination with the Dark Arts or his devotion to Voldemort's genocidal cause.\n\nLily and her husband were also brave and self-sacrificing, defying Voldemort three times as members of the Order of the Phoenix, and dying to protect their son. Dumbledore has claimed that she was very much like her son, Harry.\n\nMagical abilities and skills\n\nLily Potter was an extremely talented and skilful witch. Her skills were such that, Lord Voldemort was willing to overlook her Muggle-born status and asked that she and her husband join him.[9][17]\n\nControl of under-age magic: Before attending Hogwarts, Lily was revealed to already have a level of control over her magic, which was a rare skill. She was able to slow her descent through the air after jumping off a swing, and control the petals of a flower.\n\nPotioneer: According to Horace Slughorn, Lily was an excellent potioneer.\n\nCharms: Her wand was said to have been good for Charms work, which meant that Lily must have been talented at Charms.\n\nPatronus Charm: Lily could conjure a Patronus in the shape of a doe, which is identical to Severus Snape's Patronus and the female counterpart to her husband's Patronus and Animagus form, as well as her son's Patronus.\n\nDuelling: Lily, along with her husband, James, was able to defy and escape Lord Voldemort three times. On the fourth encounter, however, she was killed (though it must be noted that she was not carrying her wand at the time).\n\nTransfiguration: Lily also had at least some skill in Transfiguration. During her youth, she performed some Transfiguration spells in front of her sister Petunia during the holidays, doing illegal under-age magic. She gave Horace Slughorn a present, a lily petal floating in a bowl, and as he witnessed the petal fall towards the bottom of the bowl, it was transformed into a fish that he kept as a pet, until it disappeared on the day she was killed by Voldemort.\n\nRelationships\n\nFamily\n\nLily had a close relationship with her mother and father and, initially, with her older sister, Petunia. The two girls played together, and when Lily began demonstrating magical ability, Petunia was \"torn between curiosity and disapproval.\" Petunia was disdainful of the friendship Lily struck up with Severus Snape, the poor, young wizard who had taken to spying on Lily and who first informed her that she was a witch; in turn, Snape was quite insulting to Petunia for being a Muggle. When Lily was invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Petunia wrote to the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, requesting that she be permitted to do the same. Although his refusal was kind, Petunia became very bitter, and jealously deemed her sister a \"freak\".[4] Their relationship seems to have deteriorated greatly afterwards, and even as an adult, Petunia resented that her parents were proud of Lily's magical abilities and took out her enmity on Lily's son, Harry. However, despite the bitterness on Petunia's end, the two appeared to still be in contact; Harry, as an infant, was said to have \"smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent Lily for Christmas.\"[4] Petunia also grudgingly took Harry in, at Dumbledore's request, after Lily's death.\n\nSeverus Snape\n\nSeverus Snape lived near the Evans family when he was a child, and soon began spying on Lily after he noticed that she was a witch. The two became friends when he started telling her about the wizarding world, and were best friends until their fifth year at Hogwarts. Lily became increasingly dismayed by Snape's friendships with people such as Avery and Mulciber, who practised the Dark Arts and disdained Muggle-borns. When Snape called Lily a \"Mudblood\" in a fit of anger and humiliation, it was the last straw for Lily. When she later asked him if he still intended to become a Death Eater and he did not deny it, she severed all ties with him.\n\nDespite the ending of their friendship, Snape still loved Lily. When he realized that it was Harry who Voldemort had fixated on as his enemy mentioned in the Prophecy, Snape begged him to spare Lily's life. He, however, showed no concern for the life of her son or husband. Voldemort agreed to this request and offered Lily several chances to step aside. Her refusal to do so even though she had a choice is what created the magic that protected Harry.\n\nLily loved Snape as a friend, and, tragically for him, might have returned his romantic love if he had not once been consumed by the Dark Arts[1]. The deep, unrequited love Snape held for Lily for almost all of his life also influenced his Patronus, which took the form of a silver doe-- the same as hers, caused him to spy on Voldemort for Albus Dumbledore, and protect her son, Harry, until his own death, where he told Harry to ‘Look at him’, wishing to see Lily’s eyes once more before he died as it was shown he was particularly fond of her green eyes, which Harry inherited.\n\nLily's grandson, Albus, has both Lily's eyes (like Harry) and the middle name Severus.\n\nJames Potter\n\nLily's relationship with James Potter was initially a volatile one. They first met on the train just before the start of their first year at Hogwarts, where Lily was angered by James' and Sirius Black's mockery of her best friend, Severus Snape[4]. Although James was a popular student and a talented Quidditch player, well-liked by most, Lily considered him an arrogant bully and treated him with contempt. This was likely motivated partly by James' hostile relationship with Snape, and partly by his bad habit of hexing innocent students just for fun. By his fifth year, James started to have romantic feelings for Lily, and would show off to try to impress her, without success.[3] She refused to accept his many invitations to go out with him until their seventh year, when James and Lily were made Head Boy and Girl. It seems that, by that time, James had \"deflated his head a bit\" and stopped hexing people \"for the fun of it\"[3]. The two joined the Order of the Phoenix after graduating, in addition to getting married and having one child: Harry James Potter.\n\nThe Marauders\n\nLily met Sirius Black on the Hogwarts Express at the same time she met James. She disliked them both, as they quickly began teasing Severus Snape, Lily's best friend at the time, though it was Snape who had initiated the argument by mocking the other boys' preference of House. When Lily and Sirius were both sorted into Gryffindor House, Lily remembered him from the train, and turned her back on him when he made room for her at the Gryffindor table. However, during their late school years, they became good friends, and Lily eventually married Sirius's best friend, James. The Marauders themselves did not seem to be aware of Lily's past with Severus, as they were only blissfully aware of her past relationship and friendship with him, due to the latter being all but animosity for the four of them, particularly James. Sirius, Lily and the Marauders became members of the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War and fought in several battles against Lord Voldemort. When James and Lily cast a Fidelius Charm to hide from Voldemort, they originally made Sirius their Secret Keeper, as they knew him to be completely and utterly trustworthy, and Lily sent him at least one letter and a photograph of her family during her time in hiding. However, Sirius had proposed that Peter be made Secret Keeper instead, thinking that Voldemort would not expect a \"weak, talentless thing\" like Peter to be given a such crucial role. This turned out to be a fatal mistake, as Peter had turned traitor and become a spy for the Death Eaters; thus Peter betrayed James and Lily to Voldemort, leading to them being tragically killed. Sirius was deeply devastated; he attacked Peter and attempted to kill him.\n\nSirius was also godfather to Lily's son, Harry Potter, and they shared an intimate relationship; Harry regarded Sirius as a mixture of father and older brother, and Sirius viewed Harry as an exceptionally brave and matured adult with rights to knowing difficult truths, fully capable of shouldering burdens that many wizards much older and wiser than he could not.\n\nLily was also a good friend of Remus Lupin, paying no mind to the stigma surrounding his condition as a werewolf. Unlike his friends, Remus never took part in bullying students out of either dislike or boredom, including Severus Snape, though he also did nothing to stop it. When Snape insisted there was something strange about Remus, apparently having deduced the nature of Lupin's condition, Lily answered that she didn't care about what the Marauders did; most likely, she had also realised that Remus was a werewolf, but didn't want others to know. After graduating from Hogwarts, Remus helped James and Lily hide, and would have willingly died for his friends rather than betray them to save his own skin. When James and Lily died, Remus was devastated, and initially believed, along the rest of the wizarding world, that Sirius had been a traitor.\n\nLater on, Remus grew close to Lily's son, Harry Potter. He taught Harry the Patronus Charm, and protected him throughout the Second Wizarding War, while Harry ended up becoming godfather to Remus's son Teddy.\n\nDespite Peter Pettigrew's cowardly nature, Lily became more friendly with him as she warmed to James, even affectionately referring to Peter as \"Wormy,\" from his nickname \"Wormtail.\" When James and Lily went into hiding from Lord Voldemort, Lily and James trusted Peter enough to make him their Secret Keeper, though only at Sirius' suggestion to use someone less obvious than himself for the role. By then, however, Peter had already become a spy for Voldemort, and he betrayed his dearest friends out of fear for his own life; the last time Peter saw Lily and James, Lily noted that he \"seemed down.\" After Voldemort killed Lily and James, it is possible that Pettigrew felt some regret for his treacherous, heartless betrayal; in 1998, Pettigrew unintentionally saved Harry from Lord Voldemort, who was trying to kill the boy through Pettigrew's silver hand, by briefly hesitating when Harry reminded him of his life debt. This one, tiny impulse of mercy, however, led to Pettigrew being killed by the same hand.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nJames and Lily loved their son more than anything, sacrificing themselves in order to save him when he was but one year old. Harry barely knew them, but nevertheless regarded them with great reverence and fiercely defended their memory if anyone spoke ill of them. In 1995, he punched Draco Malfoy for insulting his mother, and he was frequently at odds with Professor Snape, who taunted Harry that James was not the great man others made him out to be. An incident that Snape would have delightfully used as an example was witnessed by Harry in the spring of 1996, when Harry accidentally watched James bullying Snape with no provocation (other than the already-existing animosity between them,) in one of Snape's own memories, during Harry's Occlumency lessons. Harry began to question how his mother even came to marry James when she clearly despised him for acting in such a way, though Remus and Sirius later assured Harry that his father had changed his ways, having matured enough to become Head Boy and eventually win Lily over.\n\nThe few times he ever saw his parents were in pictures given to him by Rubeus Hagrid, through a vision within the Mirror of Erised, as spectral forms which came out of Voldemort's wand during Priori Incantatem, as stored memories within the Pensieve, and again as spectral forms when he \"recalled\" them during the Battle of Hogwarts, by using the Resurrection Stone. Lily's spirit was described as looking at Harry as if she couldn't do so enough, and Harry asked his mother to stay close to him as he approached the Death Eaters' camp, and certain doom. Both James and Lily told Harry that they were tremendously proud of him for being so brave and strong despite all the pain and suffering he had endured, and gave him the support he needed to sacrifice himself to Voldemort.\n\nHarry eventually named two of his children after his late parents and godfather, James Sirius and Lily Luna.\n\nHorace Slughorn\n\nDuring her time at Hogwarts, Lily demonstrated brilliance in potions, becoming one of Potions master Horace Slughorn's \"all-time favourites\" and a member of his Slug Club. Slughorn considered her to be one of the brightest students he had ever taught, and knew her to be a vivacious, charming, talented, if sometimes cheeky, girl; he even stated, \"I don't imagine anyone who met her wouldn't have like her...very brave...very funny...\", though he was surprised by her Muggle lineage. Lily also gave Slughorn a present, probably as a token of her respect and love for him as her teacher: a bowl of water, on which a petal from a lily floated, and as the petal sank, it transformed into a fish, just before it reached the bottom. He described it as \"beautiful magic, wondrous to behold\", and named the fish Francis. When Francis suddenly disappeared one day, Slughorn realised that Lily had died[18], and her death haunted him for many years. Harry Potter used Slughorn's sympathy and grief for his mother's death to his advantage while under the effects of Felix Felicis, persuading Slughorn to give him the true memory of Tom Riddle's inquiry about Horcruxes, by encouraging him to be as brave as his mother was, and claiming that it would undo whatever great wrong he had done.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore\n\nAlbus Dumbledore was Lily's Headmaster when she was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Dumbledore invited Lily to attend Hogwarts, her sister, Petunia, became jealous, and sent a letter to Dumbledore requesting to be enrolled in Hogwarts as well. Dumbledore answered Petunia that she could not, though in a way Lily found to be \"very kind\". During Lily's years at Hogwarts, Dumbledore became very fond of her, seeing her as an extremely talented witch with a pure, kind heart, and eventually appointing her Head Girl. After Lily and her friends graduated from Hogwarts, they became members of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation Dumbledore founded and led. When James and Lily became targets of Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore offered to be their Secret Keeper in an attempt to protect them, but the role went to Peter Pettigrew instead, at Sirius' suggestion. This turned out to be the couple's death sentence, as Peter betrayed them to Voldemort, who found them and killed them. Dumbledore was deeply upset by their deaths, and dedicated the rest of his life to keeping their son safe. He eventually became Harry's mentor, often telling Harry of the love and goodness of his parents, and continually insisting that Harry's love for his parents was his greatest strength and a source of incredible power-- the power the Dark Lord knows not.\n\nMinerva McGonagall\n\nMinerva McGonagall appeared to have a very close relationship with Lily during the First Wizarding War. McGonagall was the Transfiguration Professor and also the Head of Gryffindor House while Lily attended Hogwarts. During Lily's years at Hogwarts, she presumably became a favourite of McGonagall, as she was an extremely talented witch with a pure kind heart, and would neither participate in nor tolerate bullying, the qualities that McGonagall undeniably would have favoured in a student. After Lily left Hogwarts, both she and McGonagall became members of the first Order of the Phoenix and fought against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. After Voldemort found and killed the Potters, McGonagall was devastated to learn of Lily's death, and that of her husband, James, to which she actually broke down into tears. Professor McGonagall was fond of Lily's son, and protected him as best as she could throughout his time at Hogwarts.\n\nOrder of the Phoenix members\n\nDuring the First Wizarding War, Lily was a member of the Order of the Phoenix and would have fought alongside many of its members during the First Wizarding War. She appeared to be friendly with some members, such as Rubeus Hagrid, Elphias Doge and the McKinnons; she also appeared to be very upset when she learned about the McKinnons' death, crying all night.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe given name Lily comes from the name of the flower, which is a symbol of purity.[19] Specifically, the lily is often associated with the Blessed Virgin Mary; one type of the flower is known as the Madonna lily. Greek mythology also links lilies to the Muses and to the goddess Hera, and the flowers continue to be representative of purity and love in Europe. In China, lily means \"forever in love\", and the flowers were thought to be capable of averting evil.[20]\n\nLily's maiden name was Evans. Evans is a Welsh or English surname derived from the given name Evan[21]. As a Welsh name, Evan means \"young warrior\"; it can also be considered a form of the name John, (named after the apostle John) meaning \"God is gracious and merciful\"[22].\n\nLily's married surname is Potter. Potter is a very common surname of English origin.[23] It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. Beatrix Potter was a well-known English children's author. Potter's Field is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans; It is first mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew, the Potter family had many members that fit that description. The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University. J. K. Rowling has also commented that she has liked the name since childhood, due to a relationship with two friends called Ian and Vikki Potter.[24]\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nIn the films, Geraldine Somerville plays Lily as an adult, Susie Shinner plays her as a teenager, and Ellie Darcey-Alden plays an even younger Lily in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows [25] and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptions. J.K. Rowling was asked to play Lily in the Mirror of Erised scene of the film version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but she refused the part because she said that she was \"not cut out to be an actress because she'd mess-up somehow.\"[26]\n\nIn the Harry Potter novels, Lily is mentioned to have died aged 21, yet in the films she appears much older. This could be that she is seen with Harry in the mirror at the age she would be at the time, had she been alive (31), though this doesn't make sense as she still appears to be older than 21 in flashbacks, photographs and during the Prior Incantatem scene. So it's most likely that just like Severus Snape in the films (the character is in his 30s, Alan Rickman is in his 60s) the character herself is still in her 20s, however she merely looks like she is in her 30s.\n\nIn the novels it is often mentioned that Lily had green eyes and that Harry had the same eyes. In the films however, Harry has blue eyes and young Lily has brown eyes.\n\nIn the film version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Remus Lupin mentions that Lily had been there for him at a time when no one else was. This statement may or may not be canon, as the books never imply that Lily knew Lupin well until after she started dating James. However, considering her high academic standing prior to her appointment as Head Girl, it seems likely that Lily and Remus would have served as Gryffindor prefects together.\n\nSusie Shinner did not appear as Lily in the film version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, although a promotional image showed her in costume.\n\nIn the film version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort taunts Harry by calling Lily \"your filthy Muggle mother\" rather than \"Mudblood\", even though she's a Muggle-born witch. Note that in the film version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the Tom Riddle coming out of his diary uses the term Mudblood. Although, it should be noted that Voldemort, believing in total blood purity, wouldn't care for technicalities and likely considered muggle-borns as \"bad\" as muggles themselves\n\nIn European folklore and the infamous treatise on witchcraft, Malleus Maleficarum, the combination of red hair and green eyes was considered the mark of a witch, thus it is notable that Lily Evans possesses this exact colouring.[27]\n\nIn the film version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, there is an additional sequence after Aragog's funeral where Horace Slughorn describes a gift given to him by Harry's mother, Lily. One day, he'd found a bowl in his office with a small amount of water in it, upon which floated a single petal from a lily. As he watched, the petal sank into the water, and just before it reached the bottom, it transformed into a fish. Slughorn was delighted by what he considered a beautiful piece of magic, and kept the fish for many years, naming it Francis. On the night of 31 October, 1981, the night Lily Potter died, Francis disappeared from his bowl, and Slughorn knew right then and there what had happened to Lily.\n\nLily's youngest grandson and her son are the only Potter members to inherit Lily's eyes. It is very clear they are Lily's eyes, most people comment that Harry has her eyes, and looks very much like James. Harry, when looking into Albus' eyes, comments they were Lily's eyes.\n\nLily and Order of the Phoenix member, Nymphadora Tonks, are very similar. They are the only people who married a Marauder. Lily married James and Nymphadora married Remus Lupin. They both are related to Muggles (Lily's parents and Nymphadora's paternal grandparents) and have one son, Harry Potter and Teddy Lupin, both sons were only babies when their mothers died fighting Dark forces and both sons have inherited something from their mothers: Harry inherited his mother's eyes, Teddy inherited his mother's Metamorphmagus ability.\n\nLily and her daughter-in-law Ginny, also are very very similar to each other. They both have red hair, they both married a Potter: Lily married James Potter; Ginny married Harry Potter, they both were very popular in school, both weren't afraid to stand up for their friends: Lily when the Marauders harassed Severus Snape, and Ginny when people ridiculed Luna Lovegood by calling her Looney Lovegood.\n\nRubeus Hagrid revealed that Lord Voldemort tried to recruit James Potter and Lily Evans before they left Hogwarts. While this is understandable for James, it was revealed by Rowling that Muggle-borns such as Lily can be permitted to join the Death Eaters, but only in rare circumstances.[28]\n\nJ.K. Rowling said that like Ginny, she was a popular girl.[29]\n\nLily Evans's life bears some resemblances to that of the character Lilias Craven in Marsha Norman's stage musical adaptation of Francis Hodgson Burnett's novel The Secret Garden, having died prematurely, been part of an unrequited love triangle, and having passed her eyes on to a young relative.\n\nLily's name continues a pattern of flower names in the series. For instance, in the generation during the First Wizarding War, there was her and Petunia Evans. A lily and a petunia are both flowers. In the generation of the Second Wizarding War there was Narcissa Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Fleur Delacour, Poppy Pomfrey and Lavender Brown. In the generation after the war there was Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger's daughter, Rose Weasley. There was also Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley's daughter, Lily Luna Potter.\n\nLily is the only named Head Girl.\n\nThough Harry bears a great resemblance to his father, it is often noted that he has Lily's eyes. In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated, \"Harry has his father's and mother's good looks. But he has his mother's eyes and that's very important in a future book\". That future book was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In Snape's death scene in that novel, after having passed on his memories to Harry, he whispers to Harry: \"Look... at... me...\" In one of Snape's memories, it is revealed that Dumbledore persuades Snape to protect Harry after Lily's death by mentioning the fact that he has \"precisely\" the same eyes as his mother. His last words to Harry were simply a desire to see Lily's eyes before he died.\n\nLily's initially negative opinion of James is not shown in the films, and the attraction between them seems to develop much sooner.\n\nEllie Darcey-Alden who plays young Lily Potter in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, actually has brown eyes, unlike how Lily's eyes are described, Daniel Radcliffe's eyes or Geraldine Somerville's eyes.\n\nAppearances\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Mentioned only)\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) (Appears in photographs)\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Appears in flashback(s))\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) (Appears in photographs)\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Appears in flashback(s)) (Appears as a ghost or a spirit)\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) (Appears as a ghost or a spirit)\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Appears in flashback(s)) (Appears in photographs)\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Appears in photographs)\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Mentioned only)\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (Appears in photographs)\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Appears in flashback(s)) (Appears as a ghost or a spirit)\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (Appears in flashback(s))\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (Appears in flashback(s)) (Appears as a ghost or a spirit)\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (video game) (Appears as a ghost or a spirit)\n\nLEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 (Appears in flashback(s)) (Appears as a ghost or a spirit) (Appears in photographs)\n\nPottermore (Mentioned as Harry's mother)\n\nNotes and references\n\nPreceded by:\n\nUnknown Head Girl\n\n1977–1978 Succeeded by:\n\nUnknown"
