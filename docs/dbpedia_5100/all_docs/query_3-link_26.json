        "text": "Whether you’re brewing Murtlap Essence in Severus Snape’s dungeon, winning a vial of Felix Felicis from Horace Slughorn, or secretly concocting Polyjuice Potion inside of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, the art of potion-making is one which often causes a stir in animal rights circles.\n\n​Despite the intertwining between the magical properties of potion-making and herbal healing, we often read the ingredients lists in the Potter universe with horror. Think murtlap tentacles, bat spleens, and billywig wings to name just a few!\n\nIt begs the question, do vegans and animal rights activists have a place in the Potions classroom at Hogwarts? And if so, are these jaw-dropping ingredients all they appear to be?\n\nWhether dozing in the Owlery to escape the cold or digging through the earth in search of buried gold, magical creatures abound in all corners of the wizarding world. There are countless examples of their relationships with humans - both good and bad.\n\nWhile there are many notable “creature” moments throughout the Harry Potter series, such as the persecution of Buckbeak the hippogriff, many of them are more nuanced; namely, the use of animals in potion-making, Fred and George Weasley’s Pygmy Puff (“designer” Puffskein) breeding, and the revelation that the Hogwarts carriages that “pull themselves” are drawn by Thestrals.\n\nWhen it came to compiling this list of “most animal friendly characters,” we solemnly swore to leave no stone unturned! At the same time - and to use a “Newtonian” phrase - it may have involved “just a smidge” of reading between the lines, particularly for characters who don’t feature as prominently in the books, but who definitely have the character and credentials for “animal-worthy” activism.\n\n​\n\nNorthern Star Productions was founded by Courtney Crisfield and Bayne Orion Bradshaw, two talented actors and creators who also happen to be vegan activists.\n\nBased in Australia, the dynamic duo has been hard at work writing, producing, directing, AND acting in multiple projects that make up their Lights Up: Animal Activism Through Fiction anthology series.\n\nAmong these projects is one that greatly piqued our interest: Mandrakes Feel Pain! And Other Magical Vegan Myths. It poses the question of what would happen if a vegan attended Hogwarts.\n\nTo put it simply, this is right up our Diagon Alley!\n\nIt’s not every day your young witch turns 22. In celebration of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” actress Ellie Darcey-Alden’s recent birthday, we’re taking a moment to honor her and the fantastic activism that she has been partaking in.\n\nThe British actress and Oxfordshire native made her big debut in the Potter film franchise when she appeared as the young Lily Evans. The small role launched the ginger-haired Gryffindor straight into the hearts of Potterheads all around the world. Ellie’s five minutes of screentime left such an impression that she is still showered with love by fans 10 years later.\n\nEllie’s compassion for animals and her commitment to veganism led us to admire her more than we already did. We’re proud to welcome Ellie into The Protego Foundation as our very first official Ambassador!\n\nNow dwelling in Los Angeles and balancing her acting career with a side job as a nanny for a vegan family, Ellie has been exploring ways to become a better vegan, activist, and advocate for animals and the planet.\n\nWe had the exclusive opportunity to speak with Ellie about the animal rights and welfare causes that mean the most to her, what inspires her as a vegan, and her tips on being an environmentally-conscious animal supporter on even the tightest budget.\n\nHere’s what Ellie had to say.\n\nJune 3rd, 2021 marked the grand opening of Harry Potter New York. The unveiling of the new store had a bit of a rainy start. But, as Ron Weasley oh-so-cheerfully suggested to Harry in Prisoner of Azkaban, we weren’t going to let the Muggles (or in this case, weather forecast) get us down. A dreary morning of lashing rain and gray skies wasn’t enough to deter the colorful crowd of people lined up on the New York City streets of the Flatiron District.\n\nAmong them? Some of the team from The Protego Foundation!\n\nWith as much excitement as queuing up for the Quidditch World Cup or one of the original Harry Potter midnight book releases, Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, Gryffindors, and Slytherins all united to explore (and maybe even plunder) the untold depths of magical merch at New York’s very own (and the world’s first) flagship Harry Potter store.\n\nThe Protego Foundation was there among the thousands of magical people who passed through the hallowed halls of the store on the very day it opened to the public.\n\nAh, butterbeer. There's no denying that it's the most popular drink found in the wizarding world.\n\nIf you've ever found yourself daydreaming about cozying up in a booth at the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade with a warm mug of butterbeer in hand, we're right there with you.\n\nOr perhaps you'd prefer your butterbeer bottled and chilled, straight from the cellar of the Hog's Head (sans dust). Luckily, we have a recipe that can be prepared either way!\n\nWe think Harry, who's been known as an avid butterbeer fan since he first tasted it in his third year, would approve of this simple, frothy, and delicious recipe!\n\nAfter spending two years within the magical walls of Hogwarts Castle, it’s understandable that leaving the wizarding world behind for the summer holidays in the Muggle world at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban was such a dismal thought to Harry Potter, especially since he had to spend months with his dreaded Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley Dursley.\n\nHowever, to Harry’s delight, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, he didn’t end up spending much time with the Dursleys between the end of his second year and the start of his third.\n\nAfter accidentally blowing up his Aunt Marge, Harry packed his belongings, found himself on the Knight Bus, and ended up at the Leaky Cauldron, spending the remainder of his summer basking in the glory of Diagon Alley.\n\nBetween his daily ice cream sundaes from Florean Fortescue's and discovering Butterbeer at The Three Broomsticks, we'd say that Harry had a pretty good year when it came to food!\n\nAs our own summer season comes to an end, we thought we’d put together some delicious recipes from Prisoner of Azkaban for you to enjoy!\n\nOur Witch Weekly series is back – this time with the courageous and compassionate Evanna Lynch! To celebrate Evanna’s birthday (August 16th!), we’re exploring what makes this fearless Gryffindor our newest Witch Weekly’s Most Inspiring Activist!\n\nWe’re introduced to the Irish actress in Order of the Phoenix as the quirkiest witch of her age – Luna Lovegood!\n\nBeyond the world of Potter, Evanna is one of the most daring and outspoken advocates for veganism, animal welfare, and animal rights. Through her writing, podcasting, and entrepreneurship, Evanna is inspiring Potter fans worldwide to adopt a more compassionate lifestyle.\n\nEvanna started her activist journey young when, at the age of 11, she became a vegetarian because she was distressed at the thought of animals being used as food. She wanted to avoid “bloodshed” on her plate.\n\nIt’s time to give your feline friends an extra cuddle — today is International Cat Day!\n\nOur cat companions are there for us through hard times, fun times, and the plain, average days when, like them, you want nothing more than to nap in the sun or curl up under a fuzzy blanket. We’re taking today to appreciate them and the love and affection they show us every day.\n\nTime for a quick Muggle history lesson.\n\nAs noted by the “brightest witch of her age,” Miss Hermione Granger, the Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats. During this time, cats made the world safer. In a practical sense, they stopped other animals, such as rats and snakes, from spoiling grain stocks or sneaking about inside clay vases.\n\nIn a spiritual sense, cats in Egypt were thought to be able to spot someone treacherous. Primarily they were known for their association with the protection goddess Bast, who was famous for her powerful ability to vanquish evil spirits.\n\n​\n\n​"
