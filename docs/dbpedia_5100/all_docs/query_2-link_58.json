        "text": "As General Hospital forges forward with its bittersweet goodbye to Bobbie Spencer this week, the soap is about to welcome two new faces that will, in a way, keep the beloved nurse’s storyline going.\n\nAs previously reported, a stranger shows up at Bobbie’s memorial service and propels the deceased’s daughter Carly and dear friend Felicia into a new adventure overseas. There, the unlikely duo tries to complete the business that Bobbie left unfinished as she attempted to settle late brother Luke’s affairs. So where does the new twosome fit in?\n\nEnglish-American actress Ellie Darcey-Alden — who you may recognize as the young Lily Potter from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 — has been cast as Cornelia, who will interact with Carly and Felicia in their endeavors abroad, Soap Opera Digest reports. Elise Robinson has also been hired to play Famke, another figures who plays into the mystery our Port Charles heroines attempt to solve.\n\nCredit: Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images\n\nAs viewers well know, Jacklyn Zeman, who made her debut as Bobbie in 1977, passed away at age 70 in May. The funeral for Bobbie also, in a way, serves as a tribute to the beloved actress. After her passing, Laura Wright, aka her on-screen daughter, shared that she was “so grateful to have shared so many years with this beautiful woman. Jackie told the best stories. She had an incredible spirit, and she lived such an amazing life. She loved working on General Hospital. She adored her daughters and lit up when talking about her grandchildren. Saying she will be missed is an understatement.”\n\nMore: Photos from Bobbie’s funeral"
