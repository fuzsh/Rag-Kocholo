Cruises always required an art-auction paddle (and Gary's wallet).\n\nPatty, the Condiment Queen, enjoyed her kitchen where she created luscious and never-before-seen charcuterie boards.

He was born in Galt, Waterloo County, Ontario on July 26, 1948 and was raised in Ontario until the age of 3. With his mom and new dad, they started to travel Canada as a Royal Canadian Airforce brat. He gained two sisters from mom and dad which he loved and enjoyed being around; as well helping with the care and well being of those sisters like a big brother would. He himself decided that at the age of 17 he would join the Royal Canadian Airforce. After boot camp he was sent out west to join the 407 Squadron in Comox, BC where he began his career as an aircraft engineer. After a year of being on the island he met my mom on a blind date in 1968 and married in 1970. From that moment on they were never apart until her untimely passing in April of 2019. From this union of love and friendship two children were born  daughter, Dawn Scott (grandson, Nate Scott; and granddaughter, Teanna Scott); and son, Daniel Scott (granddaughter, Yvonne Scott).\n\nDad left the military career behind in 1973 and joined Pacific Western Airlines (PWA) in Vancouver, BC; as an aircraft mechanic and then later as a Crew Chief. He watched the company grow from PWA to Canadian Airlines and then finally to Air Canada where he retired from in Calgary, AB. In his life time he met and became friends with numerous people with a smile and story. Some of those friends became so close that they were seen as family. Dad never lost the love of Vancouver Island or Shuswap Lake. He went home numerous time to visit, camp, go boating or just to get away. His love of the coast never left his heart. Don is lovingly remembered by his daughter, Dawn; son, Dan; grandchildren, Nate Scott, Teanna Scott and Yvonne Scott; as well as sister, Marlene (Dave) Evans of Red Deer Alberta and sister, Elaine (Don) Livingston of Cloverdale, BC; niece, Jody Ellis and family; and nephew, Greg Evans. He was predeceased by wife, Gwen Scott; mother and father, Margaret and George Scott; as well mother and father-in-law, Jack and Evelyn High; brothers-in-law, Arthur Meilke, Roger High, Andrew High and Robert Bob High. A small Memorial will be held in Carstairs, AB and if COVID permits a larger gathering in Sorrento, BC in July.\n\nFebruary 26, 2021 Captain William (Bill) Harkley\n\nCaptain Bill Harlkey passed away, peacefully, on his own terms at his home on Salt Spring Friday February 26, 2021. He is survived by his wife, Janice, his children Graham (Sharon) Harkley, his daughter Laureen Hooker, his son in law Ross Hooker, his stepson Pete ( Jamie) Shpak , 5 grandchildren Nick, Jenna, Grace, Evan, Kennedy, his sister Cathy (Les) Bayer and the mother of his children, Marilyn Harkley.\n\nBill was born in Vancouver August 31, 1940. Flying was his career and his life. He started flying in the bush in Northern Ontario and was eventually hired by Pacific Western Airlines May 1, 1969. He flew on all continents, except Antarctica. On March 27, 1980 Bill confirmed to YVR control that Mt. Saint Helens had, indeed, erupted as the plane he was flying was right there. By the time Bill retired fully from the airlines in 2010, he had flown through the mergers of Pacific Western Airlines, Canadian Pacific Airlines, Wardair Canada, and Air Canada. He never thought of flying as work, it was such a joy for him to fly, to experience the world, and to spend time with his airline crews.\n\nBill was always and forever an adventurer...from sailing to Hawaii on a 8 meter sailboat with Charlie and Margo White (Charlies Charts), to cycling from Vancouver to San Francisco in 10 days, to circumnavigating Vancouver Island solo on his 22 foot NonSuch at age 68, to riding a motorcycle with his dear friend Steve Knight over the Altas Mountains into the Sahara at age 70. This amazing man never stopped exploring and continuously inspires those who knew him to do the same.\n\nBill and Janice were married in 1991. Together they created 3 businesses, River Run Cottages in Ladner, Salt Spring Winery on Salt Spring and Salt Spring Mercantile on Salt Spring. You can tell that Bill never sat still, we called him the Energizer Bunny. To be diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy made collective sense of the many symptoms he had experienced over the past several years. It is rare and untreatable. He spent his last months in Ladner, watching the river run.\n\nBill was a man filled with gratitude and kindness, a loving husband, father and grandfather. A celebration of his life will be held this summer, pandemic permitting, on the docks of his sons home in Ladner.\n\nOur special thanks to the medical community on Salt Spring that were so caring. In lieu of flowers, a contribution to a charity of your choice in Bills memory would be lovely.\n\nFebruary 23, 2021 Tommy Standell\n\nA sweet hearted man who always had a great smile and good sense of humour prayers to God for my friend\n\nTommy Standell may you rest in peace Amen praise God for wonderful blessings that you were. Tom worked at YVR Cargo. RIP\n\nFebruary 13, 2021 Captain Harold (Hal) G. Lowe, B-April 1, 1930\n\nJust advised today that our dear friend and colleague Hal Lowe passed away peacefully at home in Tsawwassen, B.C. this past Saturday, Feb. 13th with his beloved Ingrid at his side.

He had a passion for the water and for fishing and spent many hours teaching his children and grandchildren to fish, to boat, to explore and to appreciate the nature that was The Bay. His friends and family will remember hot summer days on the dock where Glen would share with us his colourful life stories  always embellished for comedic effect. He will be dearly missed by his friends and acquaintances in Mount Forest as Glen often spoke of their regular meet-ups at the local The Spot Restaurant.

Immigrating to Canada in 1956, he was hired by Pacific Western Airlines in Edmonton, soon meeting Elaine and making Canada home, retiring from Canadian Airlines thirty-five years later. Known as Taffy, he won at darts and golf, loved to swim, completing seventy-five lengths in his seventy-fifth year at the Canyon Meadows pool. Respected for his ingenuity, he repaired Hercules aircraft in Resolute Bay at minus fifty and survived a crash in the Peruvian jungle, working from Angola to Beirut.\n\nAlways learning, leading, and loving the outdoors, whether flying into a remote fishing shack in northern Alberta with Frank, hunting with Bill or George (rarely pulling a trigger), and road-tripping with Elaine and special friends the Becks. He orchestrated the best fun family summers at the Shuswap, and later, endless backyard adventures with grandkids, all while cultivating the finest Early Girls on the block. His list of interests and fixing skills were admirable, and his years of patience and artistry in woodworking culminated into a flock of exquisitely hand-carved and hand-painted birds.\n\nJohn was a man with a story, a laugh, a whistle, with a flame for Elaine that never wavered. As a father he was generous, happy and wise, but he truly shone as a grandfather: patient, indulgent, and present. After Elaines death, he moved to supportive living at AgeCare Skypointe, and was popular for his fiercely independent yet congenial manner. We are deeply indebted to the caring staff who let him shine, and who made his last days comfortable. We are grateful to his many companions, notably Carole, Lisa Marie, and Nicky, who enthusiastically chatted with him about rugby, Wales, winter tires, chicken stock . . .\n\nNever looking back from his decision to live in Canada, his stories of late were of his childhood and youth in Carmarthenshire, Wales  the familys pub The White Hall, skipping school to fish, crashing his motorcycle into the side of a cow, enjoying a half-pint in each of Llandoverys twenty-two pubs all in the same evening, winning a silver medal boxing for Wales at age sixteen. We know he is back there now, running through the hills.\n\nJohn is survived by his children, Glyn (Kelly), Donna, and Diane (Jason Schaaf); siblings, Donna, Eric (Jill), June Anderson (Colin) and Michael (Wendy); sisters-in-law, Eleanor Anderson (Bob), and Pat; Yvonne, Janice, and the Welsh contingent of nieces and nephews, all who were special to him. He was adored by his grandchildren, Jon, Tim, Megan, Will, and great-granddaughter Emilee. He was predeceased by his loving wife of fifty-seven years, Elaine, his parents, Howell Newton Williams and Annie Elizabeth (nee Theophilus), his brothers Roy and Neville Williams.\n\nA private service will be held in Johns honour. Condolences, memories and photos may be shared and viewed on Johns obituary at www.McInnisandHolloway.com.

Following high school, he moved back to the Netherlands to attend flight school. While there he met his next-door neighbour and future wife of fifty years, Gerry van der Ven.\n\nAfter obtaining his pilots license, he joined the Dutch Navy for a two-year tour of duty and immigrated back to Canada to pursue his flight career. John started by flying bush planes in Northern Ontario and was subsequently hired by Pacific Western Airlines (PWA) in 1974. He went on to serve as a captain with Canadian Airlines and subsequently Air Canada. His flight career took him from the Canadian arctic, to Africa, the far east, Europe, and back home to Vancouver again. He loved to fly and was disappointed when his career prematurely ended due to health concerns.\n\nHe was an avid sportsman and excelled at tennis, windsurfing, and skiing. He completed a pentathlon, a marathon, and a triathlon.\n\nHe is survived by his wife (Gerry), son (Hamish), daughter-in-law (Katy), and granddaughter (Ada) and friends and family in the Netherlands and Vancouver.\n\nA celebration of life will be held at a future date. Donations may be made in his honour to BC Childrens Hospital. No flowers please.\n\nOctober 14, 2020 SNOWDON, Barbara\n\nBarbara Snowdon of Calgary, Alberta and Bedford, Nova Scotia passed away peacefully at home on October 14, 2020.

This was the start of his life long career in aviation. He retired in 2000 as a Captain for Air Canada. During this period George flew every aircraft in the RCAF inventory at that time, from the piston Tiger Moth to the jet-T 33. When he transitioned to civil aviation he flew the world in his PWA Hercules which took him from the cold and dark of the High Arctic to Europe and the sun and sands of Africa. He transitioned to the 737, his favourite plane and transpacific DC-10 which took him to the Far East. Lesley has even been heard to say that she felt most safe when George was Captain.\n\nWhat George took most pride in was not however his accident free career but his two much loved doctor sons, Dr. Noel Chivers and Dr. Quinton Chivers.\n\nIn retirement, George continued his life long skill set of fixing and maintaining aircraft. He carried more endorsements and \"tickets\" related to aircraft maintenance than most engineers in Canada. When anyone in the Canadian aviation world had a question regarding vintage aircraft, George was the go to source.\n\nDue to COVID restrictions , funeral services will be delayed. However, there will be a Memorial Service and Wake when it is safe to do so and further notice will be given for friends and family to attend.\n\nIn lieu of flowers please consider giving to the Dialysis Unit 5B1 at U of A Hospital.\n\nSep 4, 2020 Captain Terje (Terry) Harvigsen, Born Sep 20, 1946\n\nAnyone who had the chance to fly with Terje (Terry) would say the cockpit was a place with warm conversations, the occasional good laugh and a great flight.

She went to school as a boarder at Queen Margaret's in Duncan, BC, travelling by herself on the E&N Railway to go home for holidays. It was at school that she became the very independent, intelligent, and determined person she remained all her life. After graduation Mary worked at the Bank of Nova Scotia and then a recording company while going to BCIT. She then joined Count On Us Travel, which led her to join Pacific Western Airlines in 1971, working at the reservations office in Vancouver. Mary then went to work at the Port Hardy Airport, Cranbrook Airport, and finally Vancouver International Airport. During this time she met and married her life partner Ian Martin. Mary became involved in the union movement serving as a district chairperson, bargaining committee, and executive assistant to the union President. She was appointed by the BC Provincial Government to serve on the Motor Carrier Commission, and after the tragedy of 9/11, was appointed by the Federal Government as a founding member of the Board of Directors of the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, where she served for five years. Mary's airline career lasted 32 years with PWA, Canadian Airlines, and Air Canada, and we were able to travel to many wonderful places and experience different cultures.\n\nAfter retirement she enjoyed her passion for gardening and travel, being with her friends, and became a Marriage Commissioner.\n\nMary was diagnosed with Alzheimer Disease shortly after returning from her last trip to South Africa, to visit where her grandmother was born, a place she had always dreamed to see.

Frank retired from Edmonton International Airport and Air Canada in 2002 after 27 1/2 years. https://www.mourningglory.ca/obituary/Frank-Hauser\n\nNovember 21, 2019 Dave Hanas\n\nTerry Martin shared some sad news that our Hercules buddy Dave Hanas, ramp rat, Herc rat, Resupply LM, northern airport operations expert, farmer, father and all around happy go lucky guy has passed away in Edmonton. Dave was always full of life and had a big hearted spirit that filled a room or flight deck, moments after he opened the door and joined right into the next adventure. From the Central Western ramp at YXD in the late 1960's through the PWA Hercules and Resupply Operation in the High Arctic, to remote locations across the globe hauling outsized cargo to unique destinations and then to Canadian Airlines and Canadian North and his life after the airlines with his family, farm and friends.\n\n\" Baby Hughie \" was well known and well liked by everyone.\n\nAs you can see in the attached 1994 photo with fellow Loadmasters Gary Horobin, PJ Wheeler, Dave, Stu Russell and Harry Beck he was larger than life and that smile of his was infectious. There is no doubt that everyone on our Hercules Reunion email list has shared an adventure with Dave anywhere from the frozen Arctic to the intensely hot African deserts. There was one cook in Dundo Angola \" Big House \" that found out his sense of haha was not always there, after Dave and crew went to Francistown, Botswana and brought home the first steaks, butter and beer anyone had seen in weeks and the cook tried to put the steaks on the grill that was covered with rancid olive oil while Dave was showering and was last seen flying over the kitchen hedge into the yard next door. Those butter cooked steaks and Carling Black Label beer went a long way to keep morale up and Dave's appetite happy.\n\nTerry confirmed that a celebration of Dave's life will be held at the Calmar Legion, west of Leduc, at 1300 on Friday December 6th.\n\nOur sincerest condolences are extended to Jane and Dave's entire family.\n\nHe has moved on to a more peaceful place but will certainly never be forgotten by all who knew him.\n\nRest easy old pal - clear blue skies and long white contrails - our thoughts are with you!\n\nSep 3, 2019 Guy Tougas - Crew Planning\n\nIt is with sadness that I advise of the passing of our friend and coworker Guy Tougas on September 3 in YYC from cancer.\n\nGuy began his career with Transair in 1977 in YWG . With the PWA merger, he and his young family relocated to YXD in 1981 where he worked as a crew planner in Flight Operations. With the consolidation of the crew planning area in 1984 he moved to YYC. Guy held supervisory and management positions with Crew Scheduling and In Flight Services for PWA, Canadian Airlines and Air Canada. Guy took retirement in May 2003.\n\nGuy enjoyed his retirement and spent winters in Arizona with his wife Sylvia and enjoyed traveling with his many friends and family. He loved woodworking, making wine and just enjoying life. He had an amazing sense of humour and an acerbic wit. He was the proud owner of a joke file that would have you laughing from start to finish. He will truly be missed.\n\nGuy is survived by his loving family; wife Sylvia, daughter Jennifer, son Nick, their spouses and 6 grandchildren that brought him joy every day.\n\nA private cremation will be held and no service at his request. He would want you to raise a glass for him instead. Condolences can be sent to the family via e-mail GuyTougasFamily (sent by J.

Oscar was a character second to none. His good friend Gary Horobin mentioned he was born in Stellarton, Nova Scotia and lived there prior to joining the RCAF in 1963, where he served as a Traffic Tech and then a Hercules loadmaster with RCAF 435 squadron at Namao. Oscar joined PWA in 1974 and flew on the Hercules aircraft throughout the arctic, around the globe and into some amazing places. He was well known for his colourful writing skills and always smiled when the  Voice of the Arctic  shared some paragraphs discreetly over the aviation air waves in the middle of the arctic winter nights. Oscar was a good Loadmaster and proved that many times over, and also an expert at finding ways of getting into mischief when the opportunity presented itself.\n\nOscar may have left us, but his memory will always live on in Hercules folk lore.\n\nOur thoughts go out to Yvonne, his family and friends, including long time pals Gary and Tannis Horobin\n\nSent by Stu & Knut\n\nApril 6, 2019 Lloyd William Tuckey\n\nFebruary 16, 1929 - April 6, 2019\n\nIt is with great sadness we announce the passing of Lloyd W Tuckey, husband, father, Papa and Great-Papa on April 6, 2019.

Kenneth Gordon\n\nMay 24, 1936  December 12, 2018 at the age of 82 years\n\nAfter a long and difficult illness, Ken left us peacefully on December 12, 2018 in Salmon Arm, B.C. He leaves to mourn his brother Harry (Oresia) of Montreal, sister Kathleen Prince (Hayward) of Winnipeg, son Christopher (Lindsey) of Edmonton, daughter Laurie of Edmonton, grandsons Kyle and Owen, and granddaughter Justine. He is also survived by his sister-in-law France Brown and her husband Doug and sister in law Alice Hastings plus numerous nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his sister Iris, his first wife Joan and his second wife Marie-Paule.\n\nKen was born in Winnipeg to Fred and Agnes (Chambers) Escott. From his earliest years, he always knew what he wanted to do for a living  he wanted to fly.\n\nHe realized his dream. His first jobs were bush flying, where he had some hair-raising adventures. In time, as one of Canadas earliest water bomber pilots, he progressed to water bombing, flying Cansos. His career then took him to Midwest Airlines, Transair, and Canadian Airlines, from which he retired as Captain of Boeing 737s. He was proud of being a by the book pilot.\n\nKen was a kind, modest man. He didnt often talk about his adventures, but when we could get him going hed often laugh till the tears ran down his face. We urged him to write his memoirs, to no avail.\n\nKen loved being surrounded by family, so much so that, when hed visit out-of-town relatives, rather than stay in a hotel, he preferred to cram his 64″ frame onto someones too-short sofa. His love of family was further evidenced by the generosity he showed in playing tour guide to multiple family members, young and old, in his favourite place, Hawaii. It was his happy place.\n\nFrance and Doug, you are both so special. Whatever would we have done without you? Those innumerable trips, first to Kelowna, then to Salmon Arm in rain, shine, or snow; all those doctor visits; taking care of business affairs, plus a million so-called little things that made such a difference to Ken, and to us  youll never know how much they meant. No service, by request. In lieu of flowers, donations to Parkinson Canada would be appreciated.\n\nNov 18, 2018 Captain John Web Marvin Barnes\n\nOctober 26, 1931 - November 17, 2018\n\nJohn was born in London, England on October 26, 1931, and passed away peacefully on a beautiful autumn evening on November 17, 2018, with his wife by his side.

Richard started his career as a pilot for B.C. Airlines in the Queen Charlotte Islands, now Haida Gwai, where he met his wife Regina, who he married in 1966. Many different postings with PWA, Air Algerie, Canadian and Air Canada took him all over the world. He loved flying but even more than that he loved and cherished his family and was proud of all they accomplished. After 36 years, he retired as captain on the 767 and then enjoyed travels with his wife and sons family to Maui, cruises with friends to Europe and Asia. He also loved the outdoors camping, hunting, fly fishing and golfing. He was a devoted husband, father and grandfather who loved his family and friends with all his heart.

Al suffered an unexpected heart attack at his home with Margie by his side.\n\nAl built their home on the acreage where they loved living together with their dogs, horses and nature.\n\nHe delighted in being active and outdoors - trail riding, camping, hiking, kayaking, sailing, skiing, flying and enjoying life to the full.\n\nHis love of flying began in Abbotsford with a Piper Cub which led to a 34 year airline career, earning his captaincy at a very young age, with Pacific Western Airlines, Canadian Airlines and Air Canada. He flew Hercules, 737, DC10, 747 and 767 with the Herc and the 747 holding a special place in his heart. He had the honour of flying the Prime Minister and all the premiers on their South American Team Canada tour in 1998.\n\nHe became involved with the local Radio Control community with a particular passion for scale aircraft but enjoyed anything that flew and took particular delight in flying his turbo Beaver on floats on the many float fly camping trips with his great flying buddies.

For as long as I can remember, my Dads log book has been his steady companion, each moment in flight meticulously recorded in his copperplate script. He could have been anything- an architect, a designer, a Formula One driver, but being in the cockpit of a Sabre sealed the deal. An engaging raconteur, I could listen to accounts of his antics for hours. Whether it was painting his name with his best friend on a container ship in 20 foot letters, crop-dusting a motorcycle cop, or getting busted for low level acrobatics in a residential area, his non-conformist spirit always prevailed. He loved jazz, good design, and Bugattis with a ferocious dedication. He was passionate about world events, and we shared the notion that laughing in the face of adversity is really the only way to get through life. He was never stingy with expressing affection and admiration for those he loved.\n\nHis nieces and nephews adored him, his siblings looked up to him, and anyone who was lucky enough to be in his close circle of friends knows that though he preferred his own company to that of others, he was loyal, and he was good to have on your team. After 17,859 hours and 9 minutes in the air, and a life very well lived, his passing comes as a release for a brilliant mind trapped in an almost 90 year old body. He slipped away on April 26th during the blue hour, and we miss him dearly.\n\nPlease join us as we celebrate the unique journey of Captain Murray Cliff on Wednesday Jun. 20 @ Sawbucks Neighbourhood Pub 1626 152nd. Street, South Surrey Airborne @ 11:30 hrs. (Limited parking at rear of pub,ample parking at Semiahmoo mall across the street on the west side of 152st)\n\nApril 10, 2018 -Marie Paul Escott (Dick) b:April 7, 1941\n\nMarie-Paule passed away peacefully surrounded by her family. Marie-Paule is survived by her beloved husband Ken Gordon Escott, stepson Chris (Lindsay), grandsons Owen and Kyle, stepdaughter Laurie, granddaughter Justine, sister in law Kathleen Prince (Hayward) Winnipeg, brother in law Harry Escott (Oresia) Brossard, sisters France St Louis Brown (Doug) Blind Bay and Rachel Chevrier (Raymond) Ottawa and brother Regent St Louis (Julie )Brossard.\n\nMarie-Paule had a great career as a Flight Attendant & Customer Service Director with Pacific Western and Canadian Airlines. Everyone loved flying with Marie-Paule, you were always in for a good day. Unfortunately ill health took her away from her passion. Even at the retirement home she would be gracious to other residents and offer help. The staff used to say you can always see the Flight Attendant in Marie-Paule. Marie & Ken retired to Kelowna and when it got too cold in December they would leave for Honolulu.\n\nMarie-Paule requested no service and in lieu of flowers donations to the SPCA would be appreciated.\n\nMar 3, 2018 - Joan Mary Darling\n\nJoan passed away peacefully at her home in Comox on March 3, 2018.\n\nShe leaves behind the love of her life, her husband Gordon Darling of 28 years, her sons Ian and Rob (Sharlene) as well as step-daughter Jennifer. Also mourning her loss are her many quilting friends, Pippa and Gladys to name a couple, and long-time dear friend, Cathy.\n\nBorn in Verdun Quebec in 1944 to John and Pauline McDerment, Joan was an only child. She moved to Whitehorse Yukon as a teenager and met and married her first husband and father of her sons, Robert Campbell. Joan earned a private pilots license and ham radio ticket in those early years.\n\nJoan was a free spirit and fun-loving. She tried her hand at skydiving, travelled the world by sea and air and perfected her talents as a fibre artist (quilting, knitting, embroidery). She built a 20-year career with Canadas major airlines doing jobs ranging from ticket sales to management. Her all time favourite places were Hawaii and Mexico.\n\nAbout 20 years ago Joan sailed into the Comox harbour with Gord and Comox remained her home ever since. In later years she teamed up with quilting friends and used her skills as a fibre artist for humanitarian purposes to teach women to sew in countries such as Uganda and Kenya.\n\nJoan was a member of the Comox Valley Schoolhouse Quilters Guild. She was a proud mother, loved her quilting bees and was also passionate about football.\n\nJoan suffered a deteriorating health condition related to her heart, but this did not get in the way of her adventures, fun-loving nature and infectious smile and laugh.\n\nThere will be no service at Joans request. Rest in peace Mom, Pixie  forever in our hearts.\n\nFebruary 15, 2018 - Derek John Hicks - b:May 6th, 1930\n\nDerek Hicks passed away peacefully at Oakview Place on February 15, 2018 at the age of 87.

He will be deeply missed by his wife Phyllis; daughters Carol Persak (Peter) and Shirley Coulthard (John); granddaughters Nicole, Jennifer (Jon) and Abbey; plus countless nieces and nephews who adored \"Uncle Charlie\". He was a Proud Canadian, a throwback to a bygone era, living a life governed by Integrity, High Moral Standards, Hard Work and Family. Born December 3, 1928 in Mannville Alberta, he \"knocked around\" at various jobs before entering the Aviation Industry with companies such as the famous \"Flying Tigers\" which took him to work sites in Los Angeles, Whitehorse and Gander, Newfoundland. It was in Gander he met and married Phyllis in 1957 before heading back to Edmonton where he started a long career with Pacific Western Airlines - a career that saw him relocate his young family to Richmond in 1965, and ended with a coveted position of Vice President. After retirement in 1987, he became heavily involved with the Historical Arms Collector's Society of B.C. and also joined the Free Masons. Never content to sit still, he kept busy \"puttering around\" the family home on Fairdell doing odd jobs and projects, as well as taking frequent holiday trips. Nothing mattered more to Charlie than family and he took great pains to make sure they were always well looked after, even when they became adults. He considered himself very lucky his two kids and their families lived close by, and not a day went by when we would not visit or talk on the phone. Right up to the end, we constantly sought him out for guidance and support. Rarely does such an upstanding and caring individual pass this way, and for those of us who were lucky enough to have known him, his treasured memory will forever be in our hearts, and we shall always live by his shining example. The Family would like to thank all the staff at the Richmond General Hospital Palliative Care unit and The Salvation Army Rotary Hospice for their professionalism and kind support. A Celebration of Life will be held on February 10th at 2:00pm at Richmond Funeral Home.\n\nDecember 26, 2017 - Captain Wilmer (Bud) Sawatzky\n\nWilmer was born the sixth of nine children to Ben and Mary Sawatzky. He was born in Lucky Lake, Saskatchewan on December 21, 1937. When he was brought home from the hospital his three older sisters called him Buddy and he has been Bud ever since. At the age of five Bud lost his brother, Elmer who was just two years older than Bud. This loss has always been remembered. Bud attended the Whiteby, one room school, until he was 8 years old. In 1946 Bud's family left Saskatchewan by train and settled in Abbotsford. He grew up on a mixed farm with his seven siblings. He attended the Huntingdon Elementary School, Airport Middle School, and Phillip Sheffield High School where he graduated in 1955.\n\nWhile living on the farm Bud observed C.P. Air piston airplanes and dreamed of someday becoming a pilot. During that time in his life, Bud with his cousin, Henry Krahn watched the movie, \"The Missing Christian\" after which he accepted the Lord as his personal Saviour. As a teenager Bud was baptized.\n\nIn Bud's last year of High School he met his wife to be, Sylvia. After Graduation, Bud went to Vancouver to work at B.A. Oil and went to night school at U.B.C. Working in a Service Station led to being an independent Service Station operator in several locations. It was during this time that Bud married his sweetheart, Sylvia in 1958. After two children were born (Mike and Paddi-Lou) Bud decided to pursue his dream of a flying career. It was at that time that their third child, Pamela was born. After three years Bud got his first flying job at Air West in Vancouver, B.C.\n\nTwo years later Bud joined Pacific Western Airlines out of Edmonton, Alberta as a first officer on a DC4 flying in the Arctic. The family moved to Edmonton and enjoyed the new friends there. With a promotion to fly a Boeing 707 out of Vancouver, moving back to Vancouver made the family very happy. After two years of flying internationally Bud was promoted to Captain of a Lougheed Electra flying into the Arctic. The family was moved to Edmonton permanently. Two years later, Bud was promoted to fly a Boeing 737 out of Edmonton. While living there, the family enjoyed going to Penticton, BC to camp and water ski for a month every summer; a very memorable time for all. They took several trips to Hawaii with the children and sometimes just Bud and Sylvia enjoyed those times too.\n\nOn February 14, 1978, while Bud was playing racquet ball, he suffered a heart attack. Unfortunately, Bud had to give up his flying career. The family moved back to Vancouver where Bud recuperated and took the position as a simulator instructor in Vancouver. It was at this time that Bud and Sylvia bought a cabin cruiser and enjoyed charter salmon fishing as well as boating with family and friends. After 18 months, he was promoted to Director of Aircraft Sales and Leasing. Bud had a successful career in this position worldwide. He was then loaned to Guiness Peat Aviation and acted as Vice President of Americas based in Stamford, Connecticut for one year after which he again pursued his former position with P.W.A. in Vancouver. In 1995 Bud retired from Canadian Airlines.\n\nIn 1998 Bud had open heart surgery, after recovery, he purchased a Motor Home and he and Sylvia began to travel to many southern destinations.

He died on May 19, 2016, after a struggle with bowel obstruction and congestive heart failure, kidney failure, COPD, and diabetes. Although he was rallying in the last few months, he had been pining for his wife, Eunice Mary Thorne, of 58 years, who had only passed away two years ago, almost to the day.\n\nRay was a financial analyst for Canadian Airlines, formerly PWA. Previous to his immigration to Canada, Ray worked at the coal mines in Wales, starting out in the mines and quickly becoming an accountant for the mines and working above ground. He moved his wife and young son to Canada in 1969 when he realized the future in the valley would not provide enough opportunities for his son. He and Eunice left behind their families and life-long friends for the chance to live a bigger life in Canada. They joined their relatives in Vancouver region and formed a comfortable life here over the years.\n\nRay became an accomplished wood carver over the years, studying with great masters like Arnold Mikelson and winning several first place entries in shows. He has been carving at the Kennedy Senior Center for years now and has established long friendships. His art work is a reflection of his ability to focus on detail and his never-ending patience. Ray enjoyed carving animals and birds and leaves behind two beautiful carousels for his grandchildren. They will be on display at the Kennedy Centre in July.\n\nRay recently enjoyed a visit with his son, Michael Thorne and grandchildren, Anastasia Clement Thorne and Broderic Clement Thorne.
