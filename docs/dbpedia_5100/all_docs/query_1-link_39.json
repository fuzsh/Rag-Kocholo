It was obtained by Dan Hamrick and Mary Griffey on behalf of the Pioneer Family History Preservation Society Inc. This list isn't a complete list of Webster County burials, just those handled by the funeral homes with which Mr. Reed is affiliated. The file was corrupted and it took several volunteers to extract the information from it. No claims are made as to the accuracy or completeness of this list. Thanks to John Reed, Jill Hagelin, Norma Hamrick, Lucille Phillips, Nettie Gregory, and Michael Henline for their work on this file."
