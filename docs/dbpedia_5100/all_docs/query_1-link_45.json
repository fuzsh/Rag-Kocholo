        "text": "Severus Snape’s Timeline\n\nPart 2\n\nAt the end of Part 1 Lily, the love of Snape’s life, had just been murdered. Snape was heartbroken but had agreed with Dumbledore that he would protect Lily’s son, Harry Potter, so that she wouldn’t have died in vain.\n\nAfter Voldemort had fallen all the Death Eaters were rounded up, the majority were taken to Azkaban like Bellatrix Lestrange, Igor Karkaroff, Augustus Rookwood and many others. Some avoided Azkaban like Lucius Malfoy, who said he was only acting under the Imperius curse. Severus Snape also avoided going to Azkaban as Dumbledore vouched for him.\n\nThis blog is going to start with Harry Potter attending his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry:\n\nHarry Potter’s Arrival at Hogwarts\n\nIn 1991 Harry arrived at Hogwarts for his first year. Snape immediately had a strong disliking for Harry believing that the boy was like his father.\n\nBeing in allegiance with Dumbledore meant that Snape needed to carry out his instructions and Snape was instructed to keep an eye on the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Quirrell.\n\nFun Fact: Quirinus Quirrell began working at Hogwarts in 1985 not as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, but as the Muggle Studies teacher. In 1990 Quirrell took a yearlong break from teaching to search for Lord Voldemort because he was sick of being looked down on, made fun of and thought of as weak. Quirrell got more than he bargained for when Voldemort attached himself to Quirrell who brought him back to Hogwarts.\n\nUnder the influence of Lord Voldemort Quirrell attempted to murder Harry twice via a broomstick accident. The first time was during Harry’s first flying lesson. Voldemort/Quirrell cursed a broomstick to behave erratically, however Neville ended up using that broomstick and therefore broke his wrist. Then Quirrell/Voldemort tried to jinx Harry’s broomstick during his first Quidditch match however Snape was there to say the counter-curse.\n\nAs well as attempting to murder Harry Potter Quirrell/Voldemort’s goal was to steal the Philosophers Stone, they first broke into Gringotts, but Hagrid and Harry took it before they could reach it. The stone was transferred to Hogwarts where it was put behind several obstacles. On the night of Halloween Quirrell invited a troll into the school as a diversion so he could attempt to steal the stone, however Snape was onto Quirrell and tailed him but ended up getting bitten by Fluffy, the three headed dog guarding the stone.\n\nLord Voldemort couldn’t trust Snape at the moment and therefore didn’t reveal himself to Snape and at the same time Snape didn’t know that Voldemort was inhabiting the back of Quirrell’s head.\n\nSnape didn’t have to do much else during Harry’s first year as it was Harry, Ron and Hermione who ultimately stopped Quirrell getting the stone and defeated him, so we move onto Harry’s second year where the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Snape agreed to help Gilderoy Lockhart start up a duelling club so the students would be more prepared to deal with whatever the creature was that was petrifying students.\n\nSirius Black\n\nIn 1993 when Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban, Snape is furious. Snape believes that Sirius is the reason that Lily died because he was the one to inform Voldemort about the location of Lily, James and their son. Snape wanted his revenge which is why, when he finds Sirius in the Shrieking Shack he’s so willing to hand him over to the Dementors for the kiss of life.\n\nSnape is also dubious about letting Lupin join the staff at Hogwarts as Defence Against the Dark Arts. He believes that Lupin could be helping Sirius seeing as they were such good friends all those years ago. However on Dumbledore’s orders Snape does agree to make the incredibly difficult and dangerous wolfsbane potion every month for Lupin which means that Lupin can stay sane and in control when he transforms into a werewolf. On the evening of the 6th June 1994 Snape was delivering the potion to Lupin in his office when he discovered the office was empty and the Marauders Map was open on his desk revealing the location of Lupin and more importantly Sirius Black. Snape storms towards Shrieking Shack discovering Harry’s Invisibility cloak that he puts on and creeps into the shrieking shack wearing to find Lupin, Sirius, Harry, Ron and Hermione. He’s about to get his revenge on Sirius but ends up being attacked by Harry Potter who used Expelliarmus on him causing Snape to be knocked unconscious The next thing Snape knows is waking up outside the Whomping Willow to find that Lupin has transformed into a werewolf, and that Harry, Hermione and Sirius had all collapsed after the Dementors had descended on them, but that they were, for some unknown reason, retreating. Snape handed Sirius over Fudge so that the Kiss could be performed and Snape was going to receive, Order of Merlin First Class for his services. However Harry and Hermione, via the use of the time-turner allowed Sirius to escape. Snape was furious, he blamed Harry for Sirius’s escape even though he had no idea how he managed it.\n\nTri-Wizard Tournament\n\nSeptember 1994, a new school year began which brought the Tri-Wizard Tournament along with some very unwelcome faces to Severus’s life, like Mad-Eye Moody who isn’t Severus’s no.1 fan simply because Mad-Eye doesn’t completely trust Snape. He believes once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater.\n\nIgor Karkaroff too is an unwelcome visitor. Igor and Snape were both Death Eaters at one point and are both branded with the Dark Mark which they can see darkening over the year.\n\nOn June 24th 1995 Lord Voldemort returned to full power. Voldemort called his loyal Death Eaters to him, Snape did not go to him immediately, he waited until Dumbledore told him he should go which happened to be two hours. Within those two hours Snape discovered that Barty Crouch Jr, who had been using Polyjuice potion to appear as Mad-Eye Moody, had been a spy at Hogwarts.\n\nCornelius Fudge, being the scared idiot that he is allowed the Dementors kiss to be performed on Barty meaning that the truth died with him. Fudge immediately buried his head in the sand, refusing to believe that Voldemort was back. Snape showed Fudge his Dark Mark, explaining that it was a mark that Death Eaters received from Voldemort himself. He also explained that when the mark is pressed, that means you are to go to Lord Voldemort. Snape explained how it had been getting darker all year and that he felt the call earlier that night. However Fudge, being the stubborn man he is, refused to see what was plainly in front of him. When Fudge gone Albus knew the time was now to start up the Order of the Phoenix again, which is why he revealed to Snape, and Molly Weasley who was also present at the time that Sirius Black was an animagus who could transform into a dog and that he was innocent and on Dumbledore’s side. Snape and Sirius were forced to shake hands before Dumbledore asked Snape to return to Voldemort as a spy.\n\nWhen Severus eventually went to the Dark Lord, he had to try and convince Voldemort that he was still on his side. The reason Snape hadn’t gone to find Voldemort was because he believed the Dark Lord had died, and therefore could have no reason to believe that Quirrell was working with Voldemort to procure the Philosophers Stone. Snape gave a convincing performance which meant that Voldemort trusted Snape once again. Snape also gave Voldemort information about Harry, Dumbledore and Hogwarts that he might find useful.\n\nOrder of the Phoenix\n\nDuring Harry’s fifth year Severus had to teach Harry Occlumency, the power to close your mind, thoughts, memories and feelings so that the Dark Lord couldn’t gain information from Harry or control him.\n\nDuring one of these Occlumency lessons Harry went into Snape’s memory via the pensive and discovered the moment when James, his father, unprovoked, humiliated Snape by hoisting him into the air and then because of his anger Snape called Lily a Mudblood. When Snape discovered that Harry had seen this memory he was livid and told Harry to leave his office and never return.\n\nIn June 1996 Harry was shown a vision by Lord Voldemort that Sirius had been captured and was being tortured. Harry attempted to make contact with Sirius but was caught by Dolores Umbridge, the evil Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry, Ron, Hermione, were held hostage by Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad when Snape turned up, being summoned by Umbridge to deliver Veritaserum, the truth telling potion. Snape knew he couldn’t give them the potion as it could reveal all sorts of secrets. Harry then cryptically told Snape that Sirius was trapped in the ministry. Snape, when he was free of Umbridge, went and informed the Order which allowed them to get to Ministry of Magic to help Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna in their pursuit to save Sirius.\n\nHalf-Blood Prince\n\nIn the summer of 1996 Narcissus Malfoy (Draco’s mother) and Bellatrix Lestrange, Narcissus’s sister showed up at Snape’s house in Spinners End. Wormtail was living with him at the time. Narcissus knew that Draco had been tasked with murdering Albus Dumbledore. Snape knew of this plan and so Narcissus asked for Snape to lookout for Draco. Snape agreed but Bellatrix took it one step further asking for Snape to make an unbreakable vow. Snape once again agreed and even agreed to carry out the plan if Draco fail.\n\nAlso during the summer Dumbledore visited Severus, almost near death after he had foolishly put on the Gaunt ring, one of the Horcruxes. Severus needed to create an unidentified thick gold potion and spoke several incantations in order to stop Dumbledore’s immediate death. Snape could only delay the process and it was likely that Dumbledore would be dead within the year which was why Dumbledore agreed that if it came to it Snape would need to be the one to kill Dumbledore, in order to save Draco’s soul. Severus was not happy with this plan but agreed to it.\n\nShortly before Dumbledore knew he was going to die he passed on information to Snape that he wanted him to pass onto Harry. The information was that there was a piece of Voldemorts soul that was living inside of Harry at this very moment and that it would be crucial for Voldemort to be the one to kill him in order to destroy the piece of Voldemorts soul that was living inside Harry. Snape was only allowed to tell Harry this when Voldemort feared for the life of his snake Nagini.\n\nDumbledore never told Snape about the Horcruxes’s or the Deathly Hallows.\n\nBattle of the Astronomy Tower\n\nOn June 30th 1997 Draco brought in Death Eaters to the castle. Luckily members of the Order of the Phoenix were there to protect Hogwarts, the students and they attempted to save Dumbledore. Several Death Eaters broke through like Amycus and Alecto Carrow, the werewolf Fenrir Greyback and another unnamed Death Eater. Draco, although he had plenty of time and ability to murder Dumbledore, couldn’t do it, so when Severus entered the tower he did it immediately, he cast the killing curse that hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest which cause him to fall from the tower. It had already been agreed between the two of them that Severus would have to do it, even though he didn’t want to.\n\nAfter murdering Dumbledore, Snape fled the grounds of Hogwarts, but not before revealing to Harry that he was the Half-Blood Prince.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\n\nWith Dumbledore dead Voldemort was able to take control of the magical world, he appointed Severus to become Headmaster at Hogwarts so he could oversee what was going on at Hogwarts and make sure that the students were taught the new ways: the dark arts.\n\nSeverus kept in contact with Dumbledore via his portrait in the Headmasters office.\n\nFlight of the Seven Potters\n\nVoldemorts next step, and greatest desire was to murder Harry Potter.\n\nHarry was staying with his Aunt and Uncle in Privet Drive because there he had the protection of his mothers sacrifice she made for him. However, that protection wasn’t going to last forever so Harry had to be moved. The order agreed to move him on 27th July 1997. Severus discovered this was the date they were going to move him from Mundungus Fletcher. Severus and Dumbledore agreed that Snape should tell Voldemort the correct date that Harry would be moved on, however Severus didn’t tell Voldemort that there would be seven Harry’s in the air via the Polyjuice potion.\n\nOn the night of the 27th July 1997 Harry set of with Hagrid on Sirius Black’s motorbike, Bill set off with Fleur, Tonks set of with Ron on a broomstick, Kingsley Shacklebolt was with Hermione on Thestral, Remus Lupin was with George on a broomstick, Fred was with Arthur Weasley on a broomstick and Mad-Eye Moody was with Mundungus Fletcher on a broomstick. Fleur, Ron, Hermione, George, Fred and Mundungus had all taken Polyjuice potion to look like Harry.\n\nAlmost immediately the Death Eaters began pursuing the seven Potter’s. Snape was one of them and he saw that Remus Lupin was going to be hit by one of Death Eaters so he sent the Sectumsempra curse to hit the Death Eater, but he accidently hit George with the curse causing his ear to be sliced off.\n\nFan Theory: It’s possible that Snape was the one to kill Hedwig at the beginning as this would have been a clue that this was the real Harry Potter, however it’s an unconfirmed theory.\n\nWhile at Hogwarts Snape would talk to Dumbledore’s portrait for advice. He would also speak to Phineas Nigellus’s portrait. Phineas had two portraits, one in the headmasters office at Hogwarts and one at No.12 Grimuald Place, or at least that’s where it resided until Hermione removed it off the wall and placed it into her magical extendable bag. While Harry, Ron and Hermione were hunting horcruxes Hermione inadvertently revealed to Phineas that they were in the Forest of Dean which Phineas then revealed to Snape. Under Dumbledore’s instructions Snape led Harry to the sword of Godric Gryffindor via his Patronus of a doe. Snape couldn’t reveal himself to Harry encase Voldemort saw that Snape was helping Harry in Harry’s mind.\n\nFun Fact: Snape’s Patronus is a doe because, Lily’s Patronus is a doe, showing that Snape is still in love with Lily, Always.\n\nBattle of Hogwarts\n\nOn the 2nd May 1998 Severus, became aware that there was in intruder in the castle. He believed it could be Harry Potter and went to investigate. Snape came across Minerva McGonagall. Harry and Luna who were under the invisibility cloak nearby. Minerva took this chance to attack Snape and although she was quick, Snape was quicker and he used a shield charm. The two began a short battle before Flitwick, Sprout and Slughorn arrived to help Minerva.\n\nSnape was quick and powerful though and managed to escape through a window, flying away like a bat into the night.\n\nSeverus Snape’s Death\n\nSnape was called to go and see Lord Voldermort via Lucius Malfoy. Before Voldemort could make his intentions clear Snape repeatedly asked to go and retrieve Harry for his master. Snape’s true intention was to find Harry to tell him what Dumbledore had told him the previous year, that Harry needed to die at the hand of Voldemort so that the piece of Voldemorts soul that lived inside of him would die. However Voldemort revealed that the reason why he had wanted Snape to visit him was to kill him as the Dark Lord believed that this would make him the master of the Elder wand.\n\nVoldemort had to kill Snape, but he didn’t want to use the Avada Kadavra killing curse because he didn’t believe the spell would work as he believed that Snape was the master of the elder wand. A wand cannot kill its own master, so instead Voldemort sent Nagini to kill him.\n\nAfter Voldemort and Nagini had left, but moments before Snape was dead, Harry came to him. Snape was unable to speak full sentences and so released the crucial memories of his past into his tears for Harry to collect and then pour into the pensieve.\n\nHarry learned the truth, that Snape had ultimately been on the right side, he had loved Lily with all of his heart and was truly trying to bring down the Dark Lord. Snape’s sacrifice saved Harry and the Wizarding community from the tyranny of Lord Voldemort and helped end the Second Wizarding War. He will be remembered, Always!\n\nSeverus Snape’s Timeline\n\nPart 1\n\nName: Severus Snape\n\nBorn: 9th January 1960\n\nDied: 2nd May 1988, aged 38, at the Shrieking Shack in Hogsmade\n\nParents: Father – Tobias Snape (Muggle), Mother – Eileen Snape (née Prince)(Pure-Blood)\n\nBlood Status: Half-blood\n\nHogwarts House: Slytherin\n\nPatronus: Doe\n\nBoggart: Lord Voldemort\n\nOccupation: Potions Teacher, Head of Slytherin House, Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\n\nWand Details: Unknown, although it is presumed that his wand is made from Ebony.\n\nEarly Years\n\nSeverus grew up at Spinner’s End, near the river in Cokeworth which is found in the Midlands.\n\nSeverus followed in his mothers footprints and developed magical powers, unlike his muggle father.\n\nHis parents, Tobias and Eileen didn’t get along and would fight often meaning that Severus’s time at home was not happy, and just like Harry, he would be glad for the end of summer and the return to Hogwarts.\n\nFun Fact: Vernon Dursley, in an attempt to stop Harry receiving his letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, takes Petunia, Dudley and Harry on a trip away from No. 4 Privet Drive and the first stop is the Railview Hotel in Cokeworth, not far from where Snape and Lily Evans grew up.\n\nSeverus had no close friendships growing up except for a young girl named Lily Evans who lived in a nearby town. Severus observed Lily discovering her powers. In fact it was Snape himself who told Lily that she was a witch. Severus and Lily bonded over the fact that they were both magical which drove a wedge between Lily and Petunia until one day Snape caused a branch to come crashing down on Petunia’s shoulder hurting her. Lily evidently forgave Snape as she invited him into her house which is where he discovered the rejection letter Petunia had received from Dumbledore after she had asked to attend Hogwarts.\n\nStarting at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\n\nSnape sat next to Lily Evans on the Hogwarts Express train journey. It was on this train journey that he first met James Potter and Sirius Black. There dislike for each other started when they all began arguing about which is the best Hogwarts House. Snape was then shocked and disheartened when Lily was sorted into Gryffindor.\n\nAlthough Snape developed several friendships at Hogwarts, he also created 4 enemies: Peter Pettigrew, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and James Potter. It’s hard to say who was at fault between the two sides but one day when Snape was minding his own business, sitting under a tree reading a book James came along and performed the Levicorpus curse on him causing Snape to be hoisted into the air by his ankle and then as a result his trousers started falling which revealed his underwear to laughing students.\n\nAlthough Lily tried to stand up for Snape she ends up getting rudely insulted when Snape takes his frustrations out on Lily by calling her a Mudblood. This resulted in their relationship becoming fractured.\n\nSnape discovered that Lupin was disappearing once a month and wanted to know why. Severus followed him through the Whomping Willow. He knew to touch the knot on the tree after Sirius told him to do so. Sirius wasn’t doing this to be friendly and helpful, he did it as a cruel trick knowing that if he accidently ran into Lupin as a werewolf he could have been killed. James realised what Sirius had done and risked his own life to save Snape, however not before Snape discovered that Lupin turned into a werewolf once a month at the full moon. Albus swore Snape him to secrecy that he wouldn’t tell anyone Lupin’s secret.\n\nSeverus was adept at the Dark Arts right from the beginning, before he left Hogwarts Snape created a number of spells and curses including Levicorpus (a spell that causes the victim to be hoisted into the air by their ankle), Liberacorpus (this is the counter-jinx to Levicorpus), Muffliato (this spell fills the ears of anyone around the caster with a buzzing sound in there ear which stops them from listening into conversations), Langlock (a curse that causes the intended persons tongue to stick to the roof of their mouth preventing them from speaking) and Sectumsempra (a curse which causes the intended person to become lacerated, which causes severe blood loss).\n\nSeverus, like the Dark Lord, decided he wanted his own nickname. He used a mixture of his own blood status: half-blood, and his mother’s maiden name: Prince.\n\nLord Voldemort created his nickname to free himself of his muggle fathers name, Snape did the same thing in creating his nickname. The biggest difference though is that Snape appeared to keep the name almost to himself, whereas Voldemort demanded that everyone adopt his new name.\n\nAllegiance with Lord Voldemort\n\nSeverus was sorted into Slytherin House and immediately became friends with Lucius Malfoy, who in Severus’s first year, is already a prefect in his sixth year. Snape also becomes friends with people who later become Death Eaters like Avery, Mulciber, Bellatrix Black, Rodolphus Lestrange, Evan Rosier and Wilkes.\n\nAfter leaving Hogwarts Snape became a spy for Voldemort. Voldemort asked him to spy on Dumbledore and therefore asked him to work at Hogwarts which is why Snape asked to become the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Dumbledore turned him down knowing that the position was cursed by Voldemort, however he did offer him the Potions Master job as that year Horace Slughorn left his teaching position at Hogwarts.\n\nSpying on Dumbledore led Snape to the Hogs Head Inn in 1980. It was here that he eavesdropped on Sybil Trelawney’s interview for the Divination post at Hogwarts. Albus wasn’t going to continue with the class but because she was the great-great granddaughter of the legendary seer Cassandra Trelawney he thought she was at least worth an interview. The conversation left Dumbledore feeling that it would be the right decision to remove Divination from the syllabus until Dumbledore turned to leave and then Sybil revealed The Prophecy that said that a child who was born at the end of July, whoose parents have three times thwarted the Dark Lord will have power Voldemort doesn’t have and therefore potentially bring about his downfall. Snape, who was there to spy on Dumbledore overheard part of this prophecy. Aberforth, Dumbledore’s brother and the owner of the Hog’s Head, saw that Snape was eavesdropping and so kicked him out of the Hog’s Head, but Snape went and relayed what he had heard to his master.\n\nWhen Severus discovered that Voldemort wanted to murder Harry Potter, the son of the woman he loved more than anyone else, that was when his allegiance changed, he knew he needed to protect Lily and therefore her son, and he knew he needed Albus’s help. Snape told Dumbledore what he knew and told Dumbledore to hide them. Dumbledore hid them in Godrics Hollow\n\nFun Fact: Eileen Prince, Snape’s Mother, actually attended Hogwarts at the same time as Lord Voldemort. He started Hogwarts in 1938 and she began in 1941. Presumably Eileen was in Slytherin, along with Voldemort, meaning they probably spent time around each other in the common room.\n\n31st October 1981\n\nRoughly one week before 31st October 1981 Peter Pettigrew was made Lily and James’s Secret Keeper. He knew where they were hiding and he told Lord Voldemort there location. On Wednesday 31st October 1981 Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) set out to Godric’s Hollow with the intent on murdering 1 year old Harry Potter. On Snape’s request he would spare Lily Potter if possible.\n\nUpon arriving at the house Voldemort saw Lily, James and Harry all in the front room together. James was alerted to Voldemorts presence first and so told Lily to flee upstairs with Harry. James left his wand on the sofa when he went to face the Dark Lord and was therefore defenceless when Voldemort performed the killing curse on him.\n\nVoldemort then proceeded upstairs and found Lily and Harry. Surprisingly in keeping his promise to Snape he asked Lily to step aside, she didn’t need to die as long as he was allowed to murder the child. Lily of course refused to step aside and so in Voldemort’s mind, he had no other choice but to murder her, performing the killing curse for the second time that night. Voldemort then turned on Harry, who began to cry. As Voldemort performed the curse it rebounded causing a piece of Voldemorts soul to be ripped from his body and attach itself to the only living thing in the room, Harry Potter. The house was blown apart and the crying Harry Potter was left with a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead.\n\nPlease note that it was only in the film that Snape visits Lily’s dead body at Godric’s Hollow. In the books Snape finds out the truth from Dumbledore. Snape is so distraught that he wishes that he were dead. Knowing that his one true love is dead and at the hands of Lord Voldemort, this is when he agrees to protect Harry as a service to Lily Potter.\n\nTo be continued in Part 2 coming Monday 28th February 2022\n\nPairing Harry Potter Characters with Pokémon\n\nI was listening to one of my most favourite podcasts, Fantastic Geeks and Where to Find Them, and the hosts, Brizzy and Tessa came up with the idea of pairing up Harry Potter characters with Pokémon and I thought this was such a fun idea that I would have a go.\n\nIf you have any favourite pairings I would love to read them in the comments below.\n\nI am only going to be focusing on the first generation of Pokémon because these are the ones I am most familiar with.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nI’m 100% pairing Harry with Pikachu not only because Harry has a lightning bolt scar and Pikachu is an electric Pokémon but because Harry and Ash are so similar, both main characters, both wanting to be the best person they can possibly be and both trying to be a friend to everyone.\n\nHermione Granger\n\nI struggled with Hermione, mostly because there’s no particular book style Pokémon. I thought maybe Tangla because they both have crazy hair, I also thought of Eevee because they both have a lot of potential to evolve but I think I’m going to settle with Ditto because Hermione is very good at reading people. She worked out that Lupin was a werewolf, she worked out that Mr. Bagman wasn’t a kind man she saw what kind of woman Umbridge was from the beginning.\n\nRonald Weasley\n\nI definitely think that Ron would be starting his first year at Hogwarts with a Mr. Mime because the way I imagine it is that Mr. Mime would be a family Pokémon that would have helped Mrs. Weasley around the house but Ron would have been given him as a hand-me-down just like everything else Ron owned. I don’t think Ron would have kept Mr. Mime forever, he would definitely upgrade to a Pokémon more suited to him but initially he would be paired with Mr. Mime.\n\nGinny Weasley\n\nI’m pairing Ginny with Raichu because it would foreshadow that Harry and her are destined to be together but also because it’s small and powerful just like Ginny.\n\nFred and George Weasley\n\nI had to think of a cheeky Pokémon to pair up with Fred and George which is why I have chosen Mankey. I could see Mankey helping the twins complete pranks, steal things they need for potions and causing mayhem just like the Weasley’s.\n\nLuna Lovegood\n\nThis may sound like a strange thought but I am pairing Luna with Weedle because Luna is someone who loves the unlovable and sees the best in everyone and Weedle is a Pokémon that I can see not getting much affection. Also Weedle’s final evolved form is Butterfree which is such a beautiful and freeing Pokémon and that suits Luna’s personality.\n\nNeville Longbottom\n\nMagikarp, it has to be Magikarp for Neville. Magikarp is the weakest Pokémon of them all, it’s only move is splash, it is basically Neville in Pokémon form. However, when it evolves, when it is pushed, it turns into one of the fiercest Pokémon to ever live, Gyarados. Just like how Neville evolves to become one of the bravest people in the fandom, standing up to Lord Voldemort.\n\nSeverus Snape\n\nI’m stealing Brizzy’s answer – Severus Snape’s Pokémon is definitely Golbat. JK Rowling always describes him as an overgrown bat so what’s better than a bat Pokémon.\n\nDelores Umbridge\n\nUmbridge has to have a pink Pokémon and you don’t get more pink than Jigglypuff. That’s not the only reason these two are perfect together. Jigglypuff, just like Umbridge has anger issues.\n\nRemus Lupin\n\nWhen trying to think of a Pokémon to pair up with Lupin, I have to consider a Pokémon that would be able to cope with him when he’s a werewolf and that’s why I think Arcanine would be his perfect Pokémon.\n\nSirius Black\n\nSirius is another character who I thought could pair up with Arcanine but for some reason I feel as though Vulpix is a better fit. Vulpix just seems a lot kinder and warmer and deep down Sirius is a wonderfully warm character too.\n\nPeter Pettigrew\n\nWithout even thinking about it I had to go for Raticate. A) because they’re both rats and B) because Peter always tries to align himself with more powerful beings and Raticate is the evolved form of Rattata.\n\nBellatrix Lestrange\n\nIt had to be one of the ghost Pokémon and although any of the ghost Pokémon would fit I have to choose Ghastly because as I remember him from the show, he was that little more darker than Haunter.\n\nLord Voldemort\n\nAs Voldemort is a Parseltongue I am sure he would bond with Arbok as he bonded with Nagini in the books. Also did you know Arbok spelt backwards is Kobra and Ekans spelt backwards is snake.\n\nWhat do you think? Did you get different pairings than me? Let me know in the comments below and come back on Friday 7th June for a blog all about the Phenomenon of Harry Potter.\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child Spoiler Review\n\nWarning: This Blog Post will be full of Spoilers!\n\nI have just gotten back from going to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Part 1 and 2 in the theatre in London and I have a lot of thoughts that I want to share about the play. I have done an entire non-spoiler blog post with tips and tricks about going to see the play that you should check out. In this blog post I am only going to be talking about my opinions on the play. I repeat that there will be spoilers!\n\nThe play:\n\nI went to go and see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child part 1 and 2. If you don’t know what this is, it’s a theatre production based around the characters of the Harry Potter books, it is set 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts. The plays focus mainly on the children on Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley – Albus Severus and Lucius Malfoy and Astoria – Scorpius Malfoy. They form the unlikely friendship when they both meet on the Hogwarts express and then both become sorted into Slytherin.\n\nAlbus and Scorpius are both outsiders trying to work their way through the years of Hogwarts with only each other to lean on. The characters are massively flawed and that’s what make me love them so much, because they have so much room to grow. Surprisingly it was Scorpius who captured my heart. My initial reaction was that he was going to be an annoying character only put in for the laughs but he was the heart and soul of the play. I think the actor who played Scorpius helped in making him as amazing as he was. There are two scenes in particular with Scorpius where he’s very emotional and Jonathan Case who played Scorpius portrayed these moments wonderfully, I was blown away by how raw his performance was.\n\nThe one thing I had heard about the play was that it’s better to watch it as a play rather than read it as a book, and I would agree with that. When reading the book I thought that Draco was written as such a lame character, that Hermione didn’t suit being minister for magic and no character really stood out to me. Watching the play was a completely different experience. For example…\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was for there to be so much magic, a glowing wand for the lumos spell was all that was going to be likely, but this play went beyond what was needed. Most of my most favourite moments are when there is some sort of magic appearing. I especially love the duels you see between Draco and Harry and Harry and Delphi. There is a scene where Hagrid puts a blanket over an empty bed and suddenly Harry and Ginny appear underneath the sheets. Another of my most favourite scene is so simple and it’s when Harry waves his wand and his messy desk with scattered pieces of paper turn into a tidy desk with just the flick of his hand.\n\nSometimes there is so much magic going on, you don’t know where to look. For example there is a scene at a magical old folks home and in the background, a character was pulling a seemingly everlasting piece of string out of his mouth. Other important things were happening at the time of this scene that you would miss them so I recommend looking around.\n\nThe ending of the first play was the most intense thing I’ve ever seen, it was thrilling but I also found it really scary! Those dementors! They almost leave me speechless. I was fine with the ones on the stage, but the one that flies up towards the seats really made me feel unsettled and I understand that all they are is people with a bit of fabric over the top of them, but they seriously gave me the creeps. I think it helps that the audience was so quiet and respectful, it really added to the eerie atmosphere.\n\nIt was also harrowing to watch Ron and Hermione die and get carried upwards by the dementors! This moment was when the first of only two malfunctions happened. So we saw the dementors sweep down upon Ron and Hermione and Ron was carried away no problem but Hermione for some reason couldn’t be carried away. Very quickly two extras came on stage and one fanned out his cloak to shield the view between the audience and the dementors and Hermione, the whole problem situation only lasted roughly a minute and was responsibly handled.\n\nThe second malfunction came when Albus and Scorpius surface from under the water. Albus’s audio sounded muffled so it was hard to hear him. He tried to sort it out on stage, he hid under his robes trying to fix it, but wasn’t able to make a difference. He was only onstage a minute more with very little dialogue so it wasn’t too noticeable and when he came back on stage the problem was fixed.\n\nAnother part that gave me the heebie-jeebies was seeing Voldemort, he looked so malicious. I didn’t mind the Harry Voldemort but the real Voldemort was creepy. There is a point when Voldemort walks into the crowd on the bottom floor, and I consider myself lucky that I wasn’t in the seats on the ground floor where Voldemort walks through otherwise I seriously think I would have run away!\n\nSo let’s talk about Delphi. She is such an interesting character. She’s very cool looking with her blonde and blue hair and she seems a bit of a rebel, but when you realise that she is the child of Bellatrix and Lord Voldemort she is very underwhelming. You would expect their child to be smarter, more cunning and more malicious than she is. I mean her plan to rely on two teenage boys to mess up so badly that time can be rewritten so Voldermort survives? Nope! That is an awful plan. I think they needed to think through her story a little more. More could of been done with her and in 10 years I wouldn’t say no to seeing a new play being released featuring a Delphi comeback.\n\nThe only complaint I have about the story is the trolley witch morphing into some sort of a crazy creature. I read it in the book and I was literally like “Nope”. It was just too farfetched but I thought that I would see if the play could make more sense of it, but watching it I still thought “Nope”. If she had turned out to be some sort of creature from Fantastic Beasts or if it was explained that this was the side effect of a blood curse then I would be on board, but it just seemed so weird. Also, only her fingers seemed to grow, nothing else seemed to change so it was a bit weird.\n\nOverall I loved this play, it lived up to my every expectation. It is very fast moving and covers a lot of ground and so you’re never bored. I was nervous about the prospect about sitting through two full length plays in the same day but I found it such an enjoyable and worthwhile experience that the length really wasn’t a problem.\n\n. �\n\nThe Making of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2\n\nCast\n\nThe Trio\n\nHarry Potter is played by Daniel Radcliffe.\n\nHermione Granger is played by Emma Watson.\n\nRon Weasley is played by Rupert Grint.\n\nThe Weasley’s\n\nArthur Weasley is played by Mark Williams and Molly Weasley is played by Julie Walters.\n\nGinny Weasley is played by Bonnie Wright, Fred and George are played by James and Oliver Phelps.

In 2012 Jamie went on to take a small part in the London riots in London. He drank stolen champagne and carried a bomb device.\n\nHogwarts Teachers\n\nProfessor Flitwick is played by Warwick Davis.

The role was reportedly offered to Kate Winslet, but her manager made the decision herself to turn down the role as she didn’t feel as though Kate would want to be in something as common as the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nAberforth Dumbledore is played by Ciarán Hinds, his sister, Ariana Dumbledore is played by Hebe Beadsall.\n\nDumbledore is played by Michael Gambon.\n\nOlivander is played by John Hurt.\n\nDevelopment\n\nIt wasn’t always assumed that the final book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows would be split into two films, but when the script was over 500 pages long, and the estimated run time was over 5 hours, they decided that they had no choice but to split the book into two films.\n\nThis was the only film in the franchise to be released in 3D. It was filmed in 2D because they didn’t get the go ahead on it being in 3D until Avatar was released in 3D half way through filming Deathly Hallows, and they realised how many people would be enticed to watch a film if it was in 3D. filming. The film was converted into 3D and released in both IMAX 3D and 2D.\n\nGringotts\n\n210,000 coins were made for the scene inside of the Lestranges vault.\n\nHufflepuffs cup was made out of a soft pewter material and then painted gold.\n\nThe majority of the items that fill up the Lestranges vault are made of rubber because rubber is easier to mass producer and safer for the actors to work with.\n\nAlthough the Goblins are on screen for under 10 minutes, each of the goblins looks were designed and planned out months in advance, the absolute best makeup artists were brought in and each hair on the goblins was put in by hand one by one to make sure they looked authentic.\n\nThe Room of Requirement\n\nThe Room of Requirement is made out of props from other the other films in the series, which is why you can find a lot of easter eggs from other films in the franchise. For example Gilderoy Lockhart dumped the Cornish Pixies in there after his disastrous Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson back in Harry’s second year at Hogwarts. There are in fact around 2000 chairs. You can find lamps from Slughorn’s Christmas party, chess pieces from the Philosophers stone and much more.\n\nIn the scene where Harry Ron and Hermione are all on brooms racing away from the Fiendfyre, to make the brooms more comfortable for Ron and Hermione (Rupert and Emma) casts were made of their bottoms so that bicycle seats could be attached to the brooms to make them easier to sit on.\n\nIn the Room of Requirement Draco turns up saying that he has been using his mothers wand, however it is clearly seen in the previous film that Dobby steals Draco’s mothers wand.\n\nThe Kiss\n\nEmma and Rupert were told about that they would be filming the kiss the day before it happened. It was filming in what looks like the Chamber of Secrets, but the only part of that set that was built was the floor. The special effects were able to use enough footage filmed from Chamber of Secrets to make it look like Ron and Hermione were really there.\n\nBother Rupert and Emma said it was a bit of an awkward moment because they see each other more as like siblings.\n\nThe kiss between Ginny and Harry on the stairs was very spontaneous, it wasn’t written into the script, Dan just thought that it would be an appropriate place to put in a kiss, seeing as they may never see each other again.\n\nThe Pensieve\n\nYoung Lily Potter in the pensieve was played by Ellie Darcey Alden and young Snape is played by Benedict Clarke.\n\nYoung Petunia Dursley is played by Ariella Paradise\n\nA lot of creative liberties were made with the scene in which Harry looks into the memories of Severus Snape. For example Snape would have never seen Lily saying goodbye to Harry moments before she’s killed.\n\nThe Battle at Hogwarts\n\nThe Battle at Hogwarts began with the fight between Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape. It was planned that Harry was going to take over from McGonagall, however JK Rowling put a stop to that because she wanted this to be McGonagall’s moment.\n\nAlso during this fight McGonagall fires the Avada Kadavra curse towards Snape, but he deflects it and aims it towards the Carrows, two death eaters watching over Hogwarts. Snape could have sent the curse towards the students of Hogwarts or one of the many other professors but he didn’t he aimed them at the death eaters as a nod to his true alliance.\n\nIn the scene where Voldemort gives Draco a hug, this was completely unscripted and showed Tom Felton’s/Draco’s real reaction. This scene was filmed several times and each time Voldemort acted differently because he wanted to shock the audience around him so it would look like they were all scared of him.\n\nMolly was written in to the story to defeat Bellatrix Lestrange because a reader of the series once mentioned to JK Rowling that she didn’t think Molly would be much use in the battle because she is stay at home mum. This allowed Julie Walters (Molly Weasley) to deliver her most favourite line ever “Not my daughter you bitch!”\n\nBoth Helena and Julie (Bellatrix and Molly) had to go for physiotherapy after filming there fight scene because of all the movement and work they needed to do. Bella further injured herself during a take by falling off the end of the table she was walking on, luckily she had the smarts to ask for someone to stand at the end to catch her, which they did.\n\nSean Biggerstaff who played Oliver wood the first two films returns to lead an aerial assault on the death eaters. He is the one that shouts “Come on”.\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nThere is a deleted scene where Ron, Harry and Hermione are in Shell cottage contemplating breaking into Gringotts and Ron asks how they will know which item in the Lestrange vault is the Horcrux. The scene ends with Bill warning the trip not to trust Griphook.\n\nAnother deleted scene shows Luna comforting Harry at Dobby’s grave before she leaves to return to Hogwarts. In the same scene Harry tells Ron that he thinks he’s seeing Dumbledore in the mirror before Hermione enters dressed as Bellatrix.\n\nThe scene where Ron, Harry and Hermione converse with Aberforth was cut short. In the deleted scene Aberforth warns Harry about not continuing Dumbledore’s mission.\n\nA deleted scene at Hogwarts showed the student marching down the stairs with a concealed Harry in the middle of them.\n\nA further deleted scene showed Seamus and other Hogwarts students putting the explosive devices on the bridge.\n\nA scene where Tonks runs into the loving arms of Remus at Hogwarts just before the battle was cut. In this scene we would have learnt that Tonks had given to birth to a boy named Teddy and was sleeping at home, safe and sound.\n\nA scene of Argus Filch locking up the Slytherins in the dungeons was cut out rather sadly as it showed them escaping out by use of explosion. However the scene also shows Draco apparating into the school, which isn’t actually possible as Hermione points out to repeatedly in the books.\n\n19 Years Later\n\nAlbus Severus Potter is played by Arthur Bowen. Surprisingly this isn’t his only role in a Harry Potter film. He can be seen in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. He is in the Diagon Alley scene collecting nuts into a paper bag that have just been warmed by a fire breathing dragon.\n\nLily Potter, Harry and Ginny’s daughter is played by Daphne de Beistegui.\n\nJames Potter, Harry and Ginny’s son is played by Will Dunn.\n\nBoth Bonnie (Ginny) and Rupert (Ron) had to wear padded suits to make it look like they had put on weight in their older years.\n\nAstoria Malfoy is played by Jade Gordon, Tom Felton’s (Draco’s) real life girl friend.\n\nScorpius Malfoy is played by Bertie Gilbert.\n\nRose Weasley is played by Helena Barlow\n\nHugo Weasley is played by Ryan Turner.\n\nLondon Premiere\n\nThis is the last film of the Harry Potter series and so for the London premiere which took place on 7th July in Trafalgar Square. It was the largest premiere that the UK has ever seen. Some people waited for 4 days for a chance to see some of the stars of the film arrive. They expected 18 thousand people to turn up.\n\nFor the people who didn’t camp out, Sky put out a TV release and a 3D release! When the premiere was being filmed live it was sent out to 18 cinemas for people to watch live at the cinema.\n\nOne mistake they did make during the premiere was that the narrator Craig Stevens called Luna Lovegood, Luna Lovejoy.\n\nLucius admitted that that he hit his son with his cane a little too hard in their first film together during an interview at the premiere. It was also revealed that secret escapes were built into the walls of the great hall for fire safety.\n\nThe End\n\nHere end the end of my The Making of Harry Potter and the…. Series. I have covered all the films in the series and I just want to take a moment to say I’ve loved it. They are some of my most viewed blogs and they have been so worthwhile to create because I’ve learnt so much about a world I already love.\n\nThe Uprising of Lord Voldemort Part 3\n\nBefore reading this blog, I highly recommend that you go and read the previous two blogs in this series because they will tell you all about Voldemort’s childhood, his family tree, his early years at Hogwarts, where he went after Hogwarts and so on. I left part 2 at the end of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Voldemort had finally gotten a body and he was beginning to build up an army to start the Second Wizarding War.\n\nSecond Wizarding War\n\nDumbledore trusted Harry, he knew he was right about Voldemort returning and so in order to be ready for Voldemort he restarted the Order of the Phoenix with No. 12 Grimuald Place as Head Quarters.\n\nVoldemort, like Dumbledore, knew he needed to grow his army and bring back some of his more dedicated followers and so broke into Azkaban and freed several of his death eaters including Bellatrix Lestrange. The freedom of these death eaters was relatively easy for Voldermort because now he had the dementors on his side. The dementors under the rule of the ministry were oppressed but under Voldemorts rule they were allowed to breed at will.\n\nVoldemort also believed that to win the war he needed to hear the whole of the prophecy that was first spoken by Sybil Trelawney to Dumbledore. He knew the prophecy was being kept in the Department of Mysteries. Sturgis Podmore, a ministry worker, was put under the Imperius Curse and instructed to try and steal the prophecy. He was unable to do so and was caught and sent to Azkaban. Voldemort did however learn that only Unspeakables would be able to enter the Department of Mysteries which is why Broderick Bode was next to be put under the Imperius spell and ordered to retrieve the prophecy, however, he too ended up failing and having to go to St Mungos, a hospital for witches and wizards.\n\nVoldemort then learnt that only the person or people the prophecy are relating to can retrieve it. When Voldemort realised this, he used his link with Harry Potters mind to plant a false vision in his head that showed Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, to be in danger in the Department of Mysteries.\n\nHe Who Must Not Be Named Returns\n\nHarry, along with his friends Neville, Ginny, Ron, Hermione and Luna rush to save Sirius, but discover that they have fallen into Lord Voldemorts trap which ends with a legendary battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore. Voldemort, for a very short period entered into the mind and body of Harry Potter, this turned out to be excruciatingly painful for Voldemort, who had never experienced the feeling of love, and so with Harry feeling this emotion he was able to repel Voldemort from him. Voldemort was then seen by Cornelius Fudge, the minister for magic and other ministry officials.\n\nNo longer needing to hide, there are now many muggle and non muggle murders, including the death of Amelia Bones, the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. She was a talented witch, but ultimately Voldemort was stronger.\n\nLucius Malfoy, a loyal Death Eater, was not in Voldemorts favour, due to the fact that he had not secured the prophecy and so to make an example of him, his son was asked to become a Death Eater and he was tasked with murdering Albus Dumbledore. Malfoy, although making several attempts, failed in his efforts and instead Severus Snape carried out the task. This meant that Lucius, and now Draco were on the wrong side of Voldemort more than ever. However in the summer of 1997, Lucius offered Malfoy Manor as HQ for Voldemort. It was the least Lucius could do as Voldemort broke him out of Azkaban.\n\nVoldemort continued on his murderous journey and brought the Muggle Studies teacher to the Headquarters and murdered her in front of all his followers and then allowed Nagini, his snake to eat her.\n\nPotter takes Flight\n\nVoldemort was still obsessed with being rid of Harry Potter. He knew that he couldn’t attack him while he was still living at his Aunt and Uncles house because the magic his mother created when she sacrificed herself for her son, protected him at the Dursley home. Voldemort knew that the only way to get to him was when he was being moved. Severus Snape discovered the night they would travel, but failed to tell his master that Potter would be concealed within his friends, as several of them would be taking pollyjuice potion to look like Harry so if they get ambushed Voldemort and the other death eaters won’t know which is the real Harry. Severus Snape was working as a double agent, Voldemort believed that Snape was on his side, but he was on the Order of the Phoenix’s side. Voldemort however did work out which was the real Harry and attempted to murder him. For reason Voldemort didn’t understand at the time, Harry’s wand fought back against Voldemorts, long enough for Harry to get away. Voldemort hadn’t used his own wand for this attack, because he believed that the reason they had repelled each other the night Voldemort got his back was because they both had the same core, Phoenix feather, from Albus Dumbledore’s wand. Instead Voldemort had used Lucius Malfoy’s wand, but the results had still been the same.\n\nElder Wand\n\nIn order to overcome the wand problem, Voldemort believed that the Elder wand would fix everything, the Elder wand was the most powerful wand in existence. He had interrogated and tortured Olivander, the best wand maker in the country, for information, and then set out to find Gregorovitch, the best wand maker in Germany.\n\nGregorovitch admitted that he did have the wand but that it was stolen by someone, but he didn’t know who. Voldemort used Legilimency to see if he was lying and he saw the vision of the boy leaving Gregorovitch’s house with the wand.\n\nVoldemort now needed to find out who this boy was. This didn’t take long.\n\nVoldemort was called to Godrics Hollow by Nagini because Harry Potter had turned up there, looking for Horcruxes to destroy. Although when Voldemort arrived, Harry had escaped he did however find a book, the Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, and in this book was a picture of Dumbledore and the boy who stole the wand, Grindelwald.\n\nVoldemort travelled to Austria where he broke into Nurmenguard, found Grindelwald and demanded to find out where the wand was but he refused to tell and this aggravated Voldemort who murdered Grindelwald. Voldemort deduced that the wand was with Dumbledore and went to his tomb, broke it open and stole it.\n\nChanges at the Ministry\n\nRufus Scrimgeour was interrogated for the whereabouts of Harry Potter and when he refused to cooperate, he was murdered. Instead Pius Thicknesse was put under the Imperius curse and he was seen as the Minister for Magic.\n\nVoldemort put Death Eater Yaxley as the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement.\n\nMuggle born registration was set up to round up muggle borns and were then forced into Azkaban.\n\nHarry Potter was deemed Undesirable No1 and wanted for questioning over the death of Albus Dumbledore.\n\nDestroying Horcruxes\n\nIn Harry’s second year at Hogwarts he destroyed the diary, by use of a Basilisk fang.\n\nWhile Voldemort was busy trying to find the ultimate wand, Harry, Ron and Hermione had found the Slytherin locket and Ron destroyed it with Godric Gryffindor’s sword.\n\nJust the year before Albus Dumbledore had destroyed the ring.\n\nVoldemort had no idea that anyone knew he had created Horcruxes, however when Voldemort was informed by the Goblins that Bellatrix’s vault had been broken into and a cup had been stolen, Voldemort knew what Harry, Ron and Hermione were up to and murdered the messengers in his furry. Voldemort envisioned all the Horcruxes, each in there resting place and when he did so, he showed Harry who could see into his mind that the diadem was at Hogwarts and that Nagini was the last Horcrux.\n\nVoldemort flew into action, quite literally and went straight to the Gaunt Shack and found that the ring was missing and then he went to the cave and once again found that his locket was missing. He was three Horcruxes down.\n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione headed straight to Hogwarts where Ron and Hermione found a basilisk fang and used it to destroy the Hufflepuff cup. While the diadem was destroyed by Crabbe using the spell Fiendfyre.\n\nEventually the only Horcruxes left were Nagini and Harry.\n\nThe Owner of the Elder Wand\n\nVoldemort knew that the Elder wand wasn’t working for him, not like it should have been. It was resisting him and he came up with a rather logical solution to his problem. He believed that the reason why the wand resisted him was because it’s alliance was with Severus Snape, because he was the one who had defeated Dumbledore. This would have been true, if it wasn’t for the fact that Draco Malfoy had first disarmed Albus when he was attempting to murder him. This means that for a time, Draco Malfoy was the true master of the Elder Wand, until Harry Potter disarmed Malfoy. Unluckily for Voldemort, he didn’t know any of this. He only believed that Snape was the one who stood in the way of himself becoming the master of the Elder wand and so he set out to sacrifice him for the greater good. Voldemort brought Snape to the Shrieking Shack and murdered him. In the last few moments on Severus Snape’s life, when he was bleeding to death, Harry Potter went to him and collected the tears of the dying man. These tears were emptied into the pensieve and allowed Harry to learn the truth, that he had a part of Voldemort living inside of himself and that he needed to die, in order for Lord Voldemort to finally be defeated.\n\nThe Battle at Hogwarts\n\nAfter realising that his Horcruxes were being destroyed, he headed to Hogwarts with his fellow Death Eaters, snatchers, werewolves, dementors, giants and acromantula to fight, but Voldemort did not involve himself. Instead he waited for Harry to come to him, when Harry didn’t, he allowed the school to be in peace for 1 hour and if Harry still didn’t come he would murder ever man, woman or child who stood in his way. Harry realised that he had to die and so he voluntarily went to Voldemort. In the Forbidden Forest Voldemort, for the fourth time, attempted to murder Harry Potter. Voldemort did succeed. Harry did die and so did the Horcrux, the part of Voldemorts soul living inside him, but by the power of the resurrection stone, Harry came back to life. This resurgence was hidden from Voldemort by Narcissa Malfoy, the mother of Draco Malfoy, who knew that the only way she would be permitted to go to Hogwarts and search for her son to see if he was injured, would be in Voldemort believed Harry was dead.\n\nVoldemort walked with his Death Eaters and Harry being carried (believed dead), up into Hogwarts. Voldemort asked for all of his enemies to join him or die and they choose to fight, to not give up hope, even though there leader, Harry Potter, was believed to be dead.\n\nAs the fight broke out, Ron and Hermione focused on killing the last Horcrux, Nagini, but it was Neville Longbottom with the sword of Gryffindor who got there first.\n\nVoldemort duelled Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minerva McGonagall and Horace Slughorn all at once. Molly Weasley, in attempting to defend her daughter, duelled Bellatrix Lestrange and won, which angered Voldemort, he turned on Molly and this was when Harry revealed to everyone that he was not dead as he cast a shield charm between Voldemort and Molly.\n\nVoldemort and Harry then focused on each other. Harry explained to Voldemort that Snape was never the master of the Elder Wand and that Draco was, until Harry himself disarmed him and so he was now the true owner of the Elder Wand.\n\nHarry gave Voldemort one last chance to heal his soul, to save himself, but Voldemort refused and while Voldemort cast the killing curse, Harry cast “Expelliarmus”. The Elder wand couldn’t hit Harry with the curse, because he was the wands true master, instead the curse rebounded and hit Voldemort who died instantly. His body did not disintegrate, like in the film, but instead his body remained intact and was moved to an unknown room. Voldemorts soul was so badly damaged that it could not move on, and therefore was left in limbo for eternity.\n\nThe End.\n\nThe Uprising of Lord Voldemort Part 2\n\nBefore we get started I recommend you go and read part 1 of this blog because it will explain all of Lord Voldemorts childhood, his teenage years and his family tree. Now I will recap what Horcruxes Voldemort has and how he created them.\n\nVoldemort murders a muggle tramp to turn the Salazar Slytherins locket into a Horcrux and hid it in the cave that the Voldemort had lured the muggle children from the orphanage to. After he found the diadem in a hollowed out tree he murders an Albanian peasant to turn it into a Horcrux, he then hides it in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts. The diary that was turned into a Horcrux from the death of Moaning Myrtle has been given to Lucius Malfoy for safe keeping, while the Hufflepuff cup was given to Bellatrix Lestrange to keep in her Gringotts vault. The ring was turned into a Horcrux after Voldemort murdered his father and grandparents and was left in the rubble of the old Gaunt house.\n\nVoldemort has asked for a job teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts but he has been turned down by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster. Voldemort is now planning on raising an army against the Wizarding World. He is already a very capable wizard and has the power of Legilimency, which is the power to read and unhinge the minds of anyone he wishes.\n\nThe first Wizarding world war 1970 – 1981\n\nVoldemort, since starting at Hogwarts has always had a band of followers who call themselves the Death Eaters, but he knows that’s not enough, so he recruits the giants. He wishes for the Wizarding world to take over the muggle world and therefore the giants would be free to roam rather than be hidden away in the mountains.\n\nThe Dark Lord went on a killing rampage, murdering the muggles who wouldn’t be missed, the homeless. This is a small portion of terror he created and because of this people now referred to him as “He Who Must Not Be Named” and “You Know Who”.\n\nVoldemorts reasoning for doing this was so he could put a spell on their corpses and turn them into Inferi. Hundreds of Inferi were sent to the cave where he had once tortured little Amy and Dennis during a holiday with the orphanage. The Inferi there were put in as an extra measure of protecting one of his Horcruxes’s, the locket. He had used Kreacher, the house elf of Death Eater Regulus Black, to drink the torturous potion and place the locket in the cave and was then left there for dead. This was the first mistake of Lord Voldemort. He didn’t for a second consider that a House Elf would be able to escape, but he did, and so the house elf was able to share with Regulus what Voldemort had made him do.\n\nKreacher took Regulus to the cave, he made a duplicate of the locket, and swapped it with a fake locket after drinking the potion. Similarly with Dumbledore, Regular had to gasp for water and was attacked by the Inferi and dragged down to his watery death.\n\nMany people wanted to be rid of Voldemort but Dumbledore was the one who started putting plans into action, he created The Order of the Phoenix.\n\nThe only person who Voldemort was ever afraid of was Dumbledore which is why Hogwarts school remained safe during the war.\n\nThe Prophecy\n\nHogwarts was looking for a new Divination teacher which is why Dumbledore could be found at the Hogs Head interviewing Sybil Trelawney. During this interview Sybil made an actual prophecy:\n\n“The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches…Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies…And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not…and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.”\n\nSeverus Snape overheard only half of prophecy and then rushed back to tell his master.\n\nThis prophecy could have referred to two different boys. Neville Longbottom or Harry Potter. Both boys were born at the end of July and both parents were a part of the order who had thrice defied him. Voldemort, very interestingly choose to target Harry Potter because he is a half blood just like himself, not the pure blood wizard Neville Longbottom. Voldemort believed that Harry Potter was the only thing standing between him and Wizarding domination and he needed to be rid of him.\n\nAlthough Dumbledore put spells in place to protect Harry and his parents, Voldemort overcame them, but not by himself. He had the help of Peter Pettigrew. He was one of the few people who knew where the Potters lived and he told The Dark Lord. On the night of 31st October, Voldemort broke into the house, murdered James and then went upstairs to murder Harry. Lily, Harry’s mother got in the way and begged Voldemort to spare him and take her instead but Voldemort ignored her wishes, he wasn’t going to kill her, he was going to respect the wishes of one of his closest Death Eaters, Severus Snape, but because she didn’t stand back, he killed her and then attempted to murder baby Harry. BUT, it didn’t work, the curse rebounded because Lily had sacrificed herself to try and save her child. This was ancient magic and it caused Voldemort’s body to be ripped apart. Unbeknownst to Voldemort, that night he made another Horcrux. Another piece of his soul was now living inside Harry.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nVoldemort has lost his physical form and the majority of his power but he still had a portion of his soul. He travelled to the forest of Albania to seek refuge and there he waited for 10 years. Within this time he waited for one of his death eaters to come and find and rescue him but none did. Voldemort survived by inhabiting the body of the animals in the forest, his favourites were snakes, but even they couldn’t survive long with Voldemort living inside them.\n\nThe majority of the death eaters, without their master, quickly claimed that they were under the Imperious curse, that they had never meant to do any of the things they had done, other death eaters, the more dedicated ones became angry that Voldemort had gone. Bellatrix, Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange and Barty Crouch Jr were among the latter. They went to home of Frank and Alice Longbottom and tortured them by use of the Cruciatus Curse. Luckily, many of these dedicated supporters were sent to Azkaban for lifetime imprisonment.\n\nQuirrell and the Philosophers Stone\n\nIn the summer of 1991, Quirinus Quirrell travelled to Albania in hopes of finding Lord Voldemort, not because he was a dedicated follower but because he wanted glory, he hoped he would be able to learn a thing or two from the Dark Lord. Once he found him, Voldemort took his chance and latched onto Quirrell who brought him to Hogwarts where Quirrell could teach Defence Against the Dark Arts for Harry Potters first year at Hogwarts School.\n\nIn order for Voldemort to survive, he forced Quirrell to drink unicorn blood. which helped the both of them survive. At some point after meeting Quirrell, Voldemort discovered that the Philosophers’ Stone, the stone that contains the Elixir of Life, is currently being protected at Gringotts the Wizard bank in Diagon Alley. Voldemort has no option but to force Quirrell to try and steal the stone, but he fails and the stone is moved the Hogwarts, with enchantments and protections from many teachers at the school including Professor Snape the potions master, Madame Hooch the flying instructor, Hagrid the groundskeeper, and more.\n\nIn order to get past Fluffy, a three headed dog, the first task in getting to the stone, Quirrell, disguised as a traveller found Hagrid one night in a pub, they played card games and discussed animals which is how Quirrell/Voldemort discovered that Fluffy goes to sleep if you play him some music.\n\nWith the information he needed Voldemort/Quirrell attempted to steal the Philosophers’ Stone, but was thwarted by none other than Harry Potter, who with the help of his two friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione, were able to prevent him from stealing the stone and sent him back to Albania where he would be waiting for two more years until a devoted follower would come to find him.\n\nPeter Pettigrew\n\nIn the summer of 1994, Peter Pettigrew’s hidden identity was revealed. He had been posing as a Rat, belonging first to Percy Weasley and then being handed down to Ron Weasley. He was unmasked by Sirius Black who had wrongfully been sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban for the murder of several muggles.\n\nPettigrew was vulnerable and always sought the protection of bigger and more powerful people. This is why Pettigrew saw no other option than to hunt down his old master, Lord Voldemort. Shortly after finding him, Pettigrew very quickly realised that he was in over his head, but was now trapped to serve his old master. He fed the very weak Voldemort a mixture of unicorn blood and snake venom, offered from the snake Nagini.\n\nAt this same time Bertha Jorkins, a Ministry witch travelled to Albania where she came across Pettigrew and Voldemort. She divulged the information that Hogwarts would be playing host to the Triwizard tournament. Voldemort knew that this would work in his favour.\n\nVoldemort, when searching through Bertha’s mind, discovered that someone had put a memory charm on her. Bertha, in the past, had visited Barty Crouch’s house. Barty Crouch was a Ministry Wizard. Inside the house, hiding, and under the Imperius curse was Barty Crouch Jr, who was meant to be in Azkaban. However, his father had taken pity on him and snuck him out. Crouch Jr was a big supporter of Voldemort. This information would prove invaluable in Voldemorts return.\n\nVoldemort murdered Bertha and used this murder to turn Nagini, a snake he had a very close connection with, into a Horcrux.\n\nWormtail and Voldemort headed back to England where they broke into the house of Barty Crouch, performed the Imperius curse on him and set free Crouch Jr so he could begin helping his master once again.\n\nVoldemort, Peter Pettigrew and Barty Crouch Jr, travelled to Tom Riddles old house. They needed to be near here so they could find a potion ingredient that would help Voldemort get his body back. They needed a bone of his father, Tom Riddle, the flesh of servant, Peter Pettigrew’s hand and the blood of an enemy, and what better enemy than the boy whose parents you unjustifiably murdered.\n\nVoldemort saw how important it was to have eyes at Hogwarts so he sent Crouch Jr to go and kidnap Mad Eye Moody, an old and powerful wizard who in the past had helped to capture dark wizards. He was on his way to Hogwarts to teach the new position of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Through the use of Pollyjuice potion, Crouch Jr took Moody’s place at school. Moody/Crouch Jr taught the students all about the Unforgiveable curses and helped Harry Potter to not only get through the Triwizard tournament competitions, but also help him to reach the cup first and win.\n\nThe cup was transformed into a portkey (a transportation device), so when Harry and Cedric, another Hogwarts competitor, grabbed hold of the cup, they were transported to the graveyard where Voldemort, with the help of Pettigrew brewed the potion with all three ingredients and finally got his body back.\n\nAfter summoning a number of loyal death eaters and explaining to them his absence, he turned to Harry Potter whom he intended to kill by used of the same curse he tried to kill Harry with back when he was a baby. Voldemort was once again stopped by ancient magic. This time Priori Incantatem. This piece of magic brought back to life the spirit of Frank Bryce, Bertha Jorkins and Lilly and James Potter who all distracted Voldemort so that Harry could escape with his life and the body of Cedric back to Hogwarts where Barty Crouch Jr found him.\n\nCrouch Jr then took Harry up to his office where he too tried to murder Harry. This time Harry was saved by Albus Dumbledore.\n\nBefore Crouch Jr was spoken to, the dementors were given permission to suck out his soul. This meant that no one was around to confirm Harry’s story that Voldemort was really back. Due to ignorance of the ministry, Voldemort could work his plans for an entire year without the detection of the Ministry.\n\nThat is where we are going to end this blog. Come back on Monday 21st to find out how Voldemort is defeated once and for all!\n\nThe Uprising of Lord Voldemort\n\nThis is the first blog in a two part series all about the rise and fall of my most favourite villain, Lord Voldemort.\n\nMarvolo, Morfin, Merope and the Muggle Boy Tom Riddle\n\nThe story of Lord Voldemort starts with a woman whose name is Merope Gaunt. Merope is the daughter of Marvolo and the sister of Morfin. It has not been revealed who Merope’s mother is. These three are the last living descendants of Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is because of this ancestry that Merope, Marvolo and Morfin can speak to snakes.\n\nMerope has spent her entire youth being bullied by her father and brother and because of this her magical skill is lacking. It is unknown whether she went to Hogwarts but I suspect not, however she does own a wand but prefers to do things without magic.\n\nTwo items the family posses at this point that will be of significant importance later on is the Salazar Slytherin locket and the Gaunt family ring.\n\nMerope falls in love with a muggle boy who lives in the village, his name is Tom Riddle. There love is hindered by Morfin who discovered his sisters love for the boy. He is disgusted that a witch should fall for a muggle and therefore does what he sees as right and hexes Tom with a spell that caused him to erupt in hives.\n\nWhen Morfin was confronted by Ministry Officials a battle broke out between Morfin an Marvolo and the Ministry Officials. Ultimately the Ministry Officials won the fight and Morfin was sentenced to 3 years in Azkaban while Marvolo was sentenced to 6 months in Azkaban. This left Merope alone and free for the first time in her life.\n\nMerope used this time to concoct a love potion that she tricked Tom Riddle into drinking. Tom, now under the effects of the potion became obsessively infatuated with Merope. Together they got married and soon after Merope fell pregnant. For unknown reasons we know that Merope stopped giving Tom Riddle the love potion, either because she felt that Tom had actually fallen in love with her for real, because she was pregnant and therefore she believed that he couldn’t leave her and their unborn child, or Merope didn’t want to continue manipulating the man she truly loved. Either way Merope stopped giving Tom the potion and he left her, as quick as an apparition.\n\nMerope was left with her unborn baby feeling very much alone. Merope took the Salazar Slytherin locket to Borgin and Burkes and sold it for the pittance of 10 galleons, it was worth a lot more than this but Merope was either not aware of this or wasn’t in a position to bargain. From there Merope found herself at Wools orphanage where she gave birth to Tom Marvolo Riddle on 31st December 1926. He was named Tom Marvolo Riddle, Tom and Riddle after his muggle father and Marvolo after his wizard grandfather. Merope died one hour after giving birth. She was only 19 years old.\n\nIt has been revealed by JK Rowling herself that because Tom Marvolo Riddle was conceived under the effect of a love potion, this is why he could never feel or express love.\n\nTom Marvolo Riddle\n\nTom grew up at Wools Orphanage. He was cared for by the matrons who said that as a baby he rarely cried. He never had any visitors and he never made any friends with the other children at the orphanage. Several unkind events happened at Wools Orphanage while Tom attended there but nothing was ever traced back to him.\n\nOne particularly nasty event occurred when Tom, Amy and Dennis went exploring a cave when the orphanage went on holiday one summer. None of the children ever discussed what happened in that cave, but Amy and Dennis weren’t the same after that event.\n\nIt was in these young years that Tom discovered that he was parselmouth. He had the ability to talk to snakes, just like his mother, grandfather and uncle.\n\nTom’s first and only visitor was that of Albus Dumbledore who came to inform Tom that he was a wizard and that if he would like to, he could attend Hogwarts School. This was when Tom found out he was a wizard. Before this point Tom knew he was special but he hadn’t put a label on what it was. Tom revealed to Albus that he used his powers for personal gain and to punish those around him.\n\nDumbledore revealed Tom’s habit of stealing possessions from the other children in the orphanage.\n\nDuring this meeting between Albus and Tom we also learn a lot about the kind of person Tom is. We know that he is very manipulative, he likes to charm people to get what he wants. We also see that Tom is very independent. At the age of 11 he would prefer to go into London on his own to get his wizard supplies. We also find out that Tom hates having anything in common with other people, e.g. his name being the same as Tom the barman of The Leaky Cauldron.\n\nWhen Tom went into Olivanders to purchase his wand it was a thirteen and a half inches, yew and phoenix feather wand. The phoenix feather came from the Phoenix that belongs to Albus Dumbledore whose feather also gives one other feather that would later be formed into Harry Potters wand.\n\nTom goes to Hogwarts\n\nAs soon as the sorting hat is placed on Toms head it is revealed that he would be a Slytherin.\n\nApart from Dumbledore, all of the teachers thought that Tom was a highly talented, polite and quiet boy, he was a top student.\n\nTom never had a friend at Hogwarts but he did surround himself by devoted followers who were more than happy to look to him as a leader. These followers would later become known as Death Eaters.\n\nDuring Tom’s first few years at Hogwarts he was very interested in finding out more about his parents. He believed that his mother couldn’t have been a witch because if she was, she wouldn’t have died. However when Tom found no evidence of any Tom Riddle going to Hogwarts he was forced to research the history behind the name Marvolo. This research is likely to be how Tom found out that he was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin.\n\nWithin Tom’s research he discovered where his mother used to live and so he decided to visit the house and this is where he came across his uncle Morfin. Morfin now lived alone, his father, Marvolo now dead due to not being able to take care of himself.\n\nWhen Tom and Morfin met for the first time, Morfin thought Tom was the muggle boy from the village he once hexed, but when Tom revealed he could speak Parseltongue, Morfin realised that he was the son of Merope his sister.\n\nMorfin gave Tom the information he needed about who his father was and where he was. Tom stuns Morfin, takes his wand and goes to find his muggle father who is sat in the dining room with his parents, Toms grandparents, and he murders them all. This is his first killing.\n\nTom Riddle senior: 1905-1943.\n\nVoldemort then returns to Morfin who performs a memory charm on him to make him believe he was the one who had murdered the Riddle family. Voldemort returned Morfins wand to him and leaves with the Gaunt family ring.\n\nThe ministry went to visit the Gaunt house and Morfin admitted to the murders he didn’t commit and the ministry never looked any further into the murders. Morfin spent the rest of his life in Azkaban. His only visitor is Dumbledore, who through Legilimency discovers the truth.\n\nIt was around this time he discovered that his dad was a muggle that he dropped the name Tom Riddle, not wanting to be associated with that name or that heritage. His group of followers now referred to him as Lord Voldemort which loosely translates to “flight of death”.\n\nVoldemort became obsessed with the idea of overcoming death. Through his extensive research Tom discovered magic called a Horcrux. This is a branch of magic which allows the witch or wizard to rip apart there soul and hide pieces in normal everyday items like diary’s and lockets. Tom knew that killing, murdering in cold blood, rips the soul but he didn’t know if it was possible to rip your soul more than once. This is why Tom, armed with his powers of persuasion went to his potions teacher, Professor Slughorn, and asked him if it was possible to rip your soul 7 times, the most powerful magical number. Professor Slughorn, although reluctantly, gave Voldemort the knowledge he needed. Voldemort used the death of his father to turn the Gaunt ring, he had stolen from Morfin, into a Horcrux.\n\nTom’s Last Years at Hogwarts\n\nWhen Tom returned to Hogwarts for his sixth year he opened the chamber of secrets which resulted in the death of moaning Myrtle. It was this death that resulted in Voldemort turning the diary into a Horcrux.\n\nVoldemort had to close the Chamber due to the possibility of Hogwarts being closed so instead he framed Hagrid saying that he had let loose a monster into the castle which murdered Myrtle. Tom received an award for special services to the school.\n\nAlso in this year at Hogwarts Tom gained the trust of the grey lady, Helena Ravenclaw, Rowena Ravenclaws daughter. Helena revealed to Tom the location of Ravenclaws diadem which was in a hollowed out tree in Albania.\n\nAfter Hogwarts\n\nVoldemort finished school with top grades and although many teachers offered to set up interviews for Tom, he turned them all down and instead Voldemort turned to Armando Dippet, the headmaster of the school, asking him to become the defence against the dark arts teacher. This job would have been of interest to Tom for a few reasons. Firstly, so that he could remain at Hogwarts, the first and only place he felt at home, secondly, so that he could recruit selected young witches and wizards to become loyal death eaters and thirdly so he could continue learning the secrets behind Hogwarts.\n\nVoldemort was however turned down for the role. He was told to go out into the world, get a bit more experience and come back in a couple of years.\n\nVoldemort could have gotten a job almost any job he wanted and he ended up working in Nockturn alley in Borgin and Burkes. He used his powers of manipulation to encourage people to give over their prized possessions. One woman with two items Voldemort was very interested in was Hephzibah Smith, a direct descendant of Helga Hufflepuff. She was in possession of the cup of Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherins locket. The locket that Voldemorts mother had sold to Borgin.\n\nTwo days after being shown the locket and the cup Voldemort returns to Hephzibah Smith’s house, murders her and steals the two items. Voldemort this time made sure that it looked like it was her Elf who accidently murdered her master. Voldemort uses the death of Hephzibah to turn the cup into a Horcrux.\n\nNo one thought anything differently until it was realized that the cup and the locket had been stolen, however by this point Lord Voldemort had gone into hiding and he wouldn’t reappear for 10 years.\n\n10 Years\n\nVoldemort spends the next 10 years in Albania where he hunts down the diadem.\n\nVoldemort murders a muggle tramp to turn the Salazar Slytherins locket into a Horcrux and after he found the diadem in a hollowed out tree he murders an Albanian peasant to turn it into a Horcrux.\n\nThe diary that has already been turned into a Horcrux has been given to Lucius Malfoy for safe keeping, while the Hufflepuff cup was given to Bellatrix Lestrange to keep in her Gringotts vault.\n\nThe locket was hidden in the cave that Voldemort once took the muggle children from the orphanage Amy and Dennis into.\n\nNearing the end of the 10 years Voldemort returns to Hogwarts to ask Dumbledore, the headmaster, for the defence against the dark arts job, which Dumbledore turns him down for. Dumbledore knows that his motives for wanting to be a teacher aren’t good. Voldemort half expected this but wasn’t happy with the result and so this was when he put a jinx on the teaching position so that no one would last longer than a year. Also on this return trip to Hogwarts he took this moment to hide the diadem in the Room of Requirement.\n\nVoldemort is at the height of his power, nothing can stop him. He has successfully made 5 horcruxes but he has ripped his soul into 6 pieces. Pieces of his soul lay in the ring, the locket, the Hufflepuff cup and the diadem, not forgetting that Voldemort still has a piece of his soul residing in himself.\n\nThat is where I am going to end my blog all about the uprising of Lord Voldemort. Next month I will be releasing the sequel all about the downfall of Lord Voldemort.\n\nThe Making of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nDirected by: David Yates who also cameos in one of the paintings on the grand staircase.\n\nMike Newell, the director of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was offered the role but had to turn it down. They looked at Mira Nair, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Matthew Vaughn but they all turned down the job.\n\nScreenplay by: Michael Goldenberg, this is the only film in the series that Steve Kloves doesn’t write the screenplay for. He had to turn down the job due to working on other commitments.\n\nCast\n\nHogwarts Students\n\nHarry Potter is played by Daniel Radcliffe.\n\nHermione Granger is played by Emma Watson, although Emma was seriously considering ending her acting career, at least temporarily, she knew she couldn’t see anyone else playing her part.\n\nRon Weasley is played by Rupert Grint, during filming Rupert, along with Mathew Lewis who plays Neville Longbottom, was banned by Alan Rickman, who played Snape, from going anywhere near his new BMW because when filming the previous film they spilt a milkshake on his car.\n\nGinny Weasley is played by Bonnie Wright, Fred and George are played by James and Oliver Phelps. If you want to tell them apart, Oliver has got a mole on the side of his neck. Percy was played by Chris Rankin.\n\nNeville Longbottom is played by Matthew Lewis, who in this film, like the previous film, wears bigger than necessary shoes, false teeth, and plastic behind his ears to make them stick out.\n\nSeamus Finnigan is played by Devon Murray and Dean Thomas is played by Alfred Enoch. Padma Patil is played by Afshan Azad and Parvarti Patil is played by Shefali Chowdhury. In the books, these two are twin sisters, however the actresses that play them are not related at all.\n\nDraco Malfoy is played by Tom Felton. Crabbe is played by Jamie Waylett and Goyle is played by Josh Herdman.\n\nCho Chang is played by Katie Leung.\n\nLuna Lovegood is played by Evanna Lynch who was 14 years old when she got the role. She beat over 15,000 people for the role and although many people believe that she got the role because of JK Rowling, this is not the case. They had been communicating via letters for a while, JK was helping Evanna as she was going through problems concerning an eating disorder. When the auditions were taking place JK had no idea that Evanna was even considered for the role, let alone was the person who would eventually be chosen for the role.\n\nThe radish earrings that Luna wears in the film were made by Evanna.\n\nEvanna is a big fan of Harry Potter, she started reading the books when she was 8 years old. She actually painted her bedroom orange with turquoise quotes from the book around her bedroom.\n\nHogwarts Teachers\n\nAlbus Dumbledore is played by Michael Gambon, Minerva McGonagall is played by Maggie Smith, Hagrid is played by Robbie Coltrane and Argus Filch is played by David Bradley.\n\nProfessor Flitwick is played by Warwick Davis, once again as Professor Flitwick doesn’t have a big role so they gave him a cameo as one of the Ministry of Magic workers that can be seen in the lift that Harry Potter and Arthur Weasley get into when they travel to Harry’s trial.\n\nDelores Umbridge is played by Imelda Staunton, the producers only choice for the character.\n\nIn the book the character of Umbridge is described as a toad, to give this effect in the film, because Imelda is a little trimmer than her character she was given a bit of padding in and under her clothes.\n\nOther\n\nArabella Figg is played by Kathryn Hunter.\n\nCornelius Fudge is played by Robert Hardy.\n\nArthur Weasley is played by Mark Williams. J K Rowling has admitted that she seriously considered killing of Arthur Weasley in this film when he gets attacked by Nagini. This would have made more plausibility for why Harry would be so desperate to save Sirius. However JK Rowling realised that she couldn’t kill him of.\n\nSirius is played by Gary Oldman. The dog Sirius is a Scottish Deerhound named Cleod.\n\nIn the scene where Sirius dies, the scream that Dan lets out was so harrowing and too emotional to hear, so David, the directors, choose to partially mute the scene and let the music take over. It is such a beautifully sad scene.\n\nLupin is played by David Thewlis.\n\nMad Eye Moody is played by Brendan Gleeson.\n\nKreacher was voiced by Timothy Bateson, this would end up being his last role as he passed away in 2009. In the original script Kreacher was not included, they didn’t feel that his character was one that needed to be included. At the time of making this film, the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was only released 10 days before this film came out, so no one knew how crucial he would be to the storyline, but JK Rowling was around to hint that they needed to include him.\n\nThe Centaur was played by Michael Wildman.\n\nGrawp is played by Tony Maudsley. In order to create the character of Grawp the workers used a new method which was created by Image Metrics. This newly created technology recorded the actors performance along with the muscles in his face, they then transferred the actors performance onto the animated body of Grawp the giant. I must admit that it looks very realistic in the film.\n\nNymphadora Tonks was played by Natalie Tena. Tonks is a metamorphmagus which means that she can change her appearance at will. Although in the books she is described as having pink hair it was decided to reserve that colour for Delores Umbridge so instead of pink Tonks was given purple hair.\n\nKingsley Shaklebolt is played by George Harris.\n\nBellatrix Lestrange is played by Helena Bonham Carter, originally the role was given to Helen McCroy but due to pregnancy she had to turn down the role. McCroy couldn’t stay away from the Harry Potter fandom and was later cast as Narcisa Malfoy, sister of Bellatrix.\n\nBellatrix took the pain loving part of her character very seriously because during the scene where Bellatrix is keeping Neville captive, she put her wand inside Neville’s ear and actually perforated his ear drum. If you watch the DVD extra scenes you can see Mathew, (Neville), checking his poor ears in the background. Helena felt awful about what happened and apologised profusely.\n\nOne character that doesn’t appear in this film was Kenneth Brannagh who was planning to reprise his role as Gilderoy Lockhart. They were planning on re-creating the scene that is written in the book where the Weasley clan plus Harry go and visit Arthur Weasley after he is attacked in St Mungos. In the hospital would be Gilderoy Lockhart, who is still unsure about who he really is after the memory loss spell backfired on himself in the chamber of secrets.\n\nLord Voldemort\n\nLord Voldemort is played by Ralph Fiennes. Committing to the role as much as possible he shaved his head and armpits. Ralph also asked that he didn’t have too much prosthetic make up, he wanted to look as stripped down as possible and he didn’t want his facial and body moments to be restricted. The look of him, the dark but pale skin and the visible veins were all done with tattoo and make-up. The removal of his nose was done during the editing process so while he was being filmed he had coloured dots all over his face. This sounds comical but Ralph took his character seriously and really acted as intense and scary as we see on screen so that Dan and the other actors around him while filming could really play of him, and therefore they could create a powerful scene.\n\nIn the books Voldemort is described as having slits for eyes, however this idea wasn’t used in the film because they didn’t believe that the audience would be able to understand how Voldemort is feeling as the red eyes would hide the emotion.\n\nNumber 12 Grimuald Place\n\nThe street in which you can find Grimuald Place was built on the Leavesden Studios backlot, along with Privet Drive and this is because the residents of the real Privet Drive demanded too much money so they just decided to make their own.\n\nWhen creating the room in which the Black tapestry was, before they could progress they needed names and details on who is the family and how they all link together. Within 15 minutes JK Rowling had sent over a full family tree dating back years. This is just one example of how much detail JK has about the world she has created.\n\nRoom of Requirement\n\nWhen Dan was deciding what to wear on his first day being a teacher in the room of requirement he made a conscious effort to pay homage to his favourite Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin and opted for a cardigan.\n\nIt took 5 special effects artists 3 months to remove all the reflections. Due to the fact that they lit the floor from the underneath and there was a lot of lighting and there were fires to add ambience, the actors said it was like working in a furnace.\n\nThe Kiss\n\nReportedly, on the scheduled day of the kiss Dan came down ill so the kiss had to be postponed.\n\nMinistry of Magic\n\nThe code to enter the Ministry of Magic via the visitor entrance in the telephone box is 62442, which spells out Magic.\n\nThe look of the Ministry of Magic is based on the London Underground. There are 30,000 tiles\n\nIn order to make the Ministry look bigger than it actually is, they built two layers of the offices and then in editing basically copied and pasted more layers to make it look like it is bigger than it actually is. Although they had to digitally enhance the size this was still the largest set they have made. It took 22 weeks to build and only appears for around 10 minutes. They based the look of it on the London Underground which is why they made the arched ceilings and the dark tiles which they used 30,000 of. They just added a lovely, fully working fountain to make it more magical.\n\nThe duelling in the battle at the end of the film had to be choreographed by a dance choreographer and a fight choreographer. The dance choreographer was Paul Harris. They created 5 attack moves and 5 defence moves but then the characters were able to put their own spin on it. They practised the scene so much that Helena, Bellatrix, actually got a wand blister.\n\nHall of Prophecies was the most technical scene ever created, practically the whole room was green screen.\n\nEaster Eggs\n\nDuring the breakfast scene in the Great Hall if you look at the cereal boxes in the background you can see cereal called “Cheeri-Owls” and “Pixie Puffs”. These are obviously a play on “cheerios” and “sugar puffs”.\n\nBits and Bobs\n\nFilming was put on hiatus so that Dad could sit his A-levels and Emma could sit her GCSE’s.\n\nThe film required over 1,400 visual effects shots.\n\nThis is the 47th highest grossing film.\n\nHarry Potter Theories\n\nIn this blog post I am going to discuss my most favourite Harry Potter fan theories. I would like to say firstly that 3/4 ideas are not my own, I am not taking credit for them and although I have tried to discover who created these theories, I have found nothing. If you, yeah you, the reader, do know, please leave the information in the comments below.\n\nJust to warn you, there will be SPOILERS throughout!\n\nDursleys Effected by the Harry Horcrux?\n\nThe reason why the Dursleys are so unkind and distance themselves from Harry is because Harry has a little bit of Voldemort’s soul living inside him. Harry is a Horcrux created unintentionally by Voldemort himself. The effect of being close to a Horcrux can differ from person to person. For example when Harry, Ron and Hermione wore Salazar Slytherin’s locket they became moodier, angrier and couldn’t produce a Patronus, however when Dolores Umbridge wore the Horcrux locket, her magic was enhanced. Maybe the Dursleys are suffering negative effects of being close to Harry the Horcrux.\n\nLet’s look at the evidence. Harry has been living in the muggle world for 13 years before he is whisked away to Hogwarts and in those 13 years Harry doesn’t have a single friend. Harry doesn’t mention a single person from school who was even an acquaintance, not even a teacher who should have recognised that Harry didn’t have a single friend and was uncared for by his Aunt and Uncle.\n\nEven the awful Dudley Dursley had friends, but not poor Harry. I know in the book it’s explained that Dudley is the reason for Harry being friendless, but come on, not even one acquaintance.\n\nI can hear what you’re saying, “What about Ron and Hermione?” Well they’re only two people and they are part of the Wizarding World, maybe the Dursleys and the people in the muggle world are that little bit more susceptible to the effects of being too close to a Horcrux.\n\nOverall I think this theory is very possible, I’m going to give it a 4.5/5 for plausibility.\n\nHarry’s Immortal?\n\nThe second theory is that Harry Potter got Voldemorts wish, he’s immortal.\n\nThe prophecy says that “either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives”. This is assumed that either Harry or Voldermort have to kill each other and while that is true, it can also mean that the winner, Harry Potter, now must live forever or it means the rebirth of his foe, Voldemort. Harry is now the protector of the world against Voldemort, forever. This is a pretty rough deal for Harry because all he’s wanted was to be with his family and now he’ll never meet them, not even in the afterlife.\n\nSimilarly with the previous theory, this one is also very possible, I’m going to give it a 4/5 for plausibility.\n\nIt’s all a Dream?\n\nThe third theory is one that I had thought of and then I found that lots of other people had thought of this theory as well. The theory is that Harry dreamed the whole thing. I think Harry was involved in a car accident that caused him to lose his parents and gain the lightning bolt shaped scar. This would also explain why he was living with "
