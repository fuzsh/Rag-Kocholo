        "text": "Q.) If Harry and Edward had to duel against each other using their own abilities, who do Du think would win?\n\nMeyer:\n\nA.) Oh gosh, don’t get mad at me but I don’t know what a wizard fight looks like in her (JKRowling's) head. I know what it looks like in the Filme so I have to go on what it looks like in the movies. But here is the thing, if it’s possible for a human to ente a wand being shot at them; a vampire is not going to have a problem. The fight would be over in .01 Sekunden because Edward would be across the room snapping his (Harry's) neck. He would be done. He wouldn’t even have time to say his spell word. I’m sorry but Edward would win that one.\n\n------------------\n\nThis was an interview done in 08 I think Von MuggleNet podcast. I personally think it's ridiculous (and I feel the need to Crucio her).. but do Du agree?"
