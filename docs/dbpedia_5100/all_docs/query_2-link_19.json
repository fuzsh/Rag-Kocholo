Passes can give you access to one or more days, depending on which one you choose.\n\nIt's important to remember that you can't enter the convention without a pass.\n\nIn addition to passes, organizers sell extras for activities with guests. These may include photo ops, autograph sessions, meet and greets, and so on. These must be purchased in addition to the pass. If you bought extras without a pass, you won't be able to do them, and you've wasted money."
