Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter invited visitors to delve into the world of spellcasting, potions, and wizard duels as it hosted its first Summer Spells feature. Visitors discovered first-hand how spells such as the Levitation Charm came to life on screen and how the wand movements that accompanied them were developed.\n\nKnowledgeable staff members were on hand to teach wand battle choreography, aided by an interactive experience created by choreography expert Paul Harris. Paul composed the battle scene between Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and is the world’s only wand combat choreographer.\n\nThose exploring Diagon Alley were able to take part in a special effects demonstration created by BAFTA-winning special effects supervisor John Richardson. By pointing a wand, visitors were able to cast a spell that made the sign above Potage’s Cauldron Shop bang and flash as if by magic.\n\nIn scenes where a character conjured his or her Patronus – a protective charm that usually takes the form of an animal and shields the wizard against Dementors – actors such as Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter, whose Patronus was a stag) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger, who casts an otter Patronus) had to use their imagination; Patronuses were created post-filming using CGI. The cast was, however, aided by an Irish wolfhound dressed in a specially made costume, which helped them visualize the glowing effect of a Patronus. This was on display at the Studio Tour for the first time throughout the Summer Spells feature.\n\nSpellbinding secrets:\n\nIn the first and second films, the wands looked quite plain. This was drastically changed in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban when the wands were given distinctive shapes and carvings, reflecting the owners’ personalities. For example, the wand of Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) is inlaid with silver slug trails and has a slug-shaped handle.\n\nSome of the cast of the Harry Potter film series had their own ideas about how their characters’ wands should look. Actor Ralph Fiennes said he wanted Voldemort’s wand to look like an evil finger pointing off into the distance; this influence can be seen in the wand he used on-screen, which appears to be made of bone.\n\nOver the course of the films the prop team created thousands of wands. Rumor has it they never lost a single one – though Daniel Radcliffe wore out over 60 wands during the making of the film series.\n\nHundreds of potion jars line the walls of the Potions classroom, which can be seen at the Studio Tour. Among the ingredients kept in them are plastic animals from a zoo gift shop, baked animal bones from a local butcher shop, and dried leaves and herbs.\n\n⬆ Back to top\n\nOne-Year Anniversary (Mar 31, 2013)\n\nOne-year anniversary celebration with a series of surprises for visitors\n\nMuggleNet represented by Claire Furner\n\nRead the Report\n\n⬆ Back to top\n\nWand Week - Part 1 (Feb 16-24, 2013)\n\nThe Warner Bros.

Studio Tour London\n\nWarner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter is already planning a summer you won’t soon forget to celebrate the studio’s 11th anniversary. Just like Hogwarts students receive their letters inviting them to the school when they turn 11, Studio Tour London is inviting Potterheads to come rediscover Harry Potter’s first year at Hogwarts during its special summer feature Discovering Hogwarts, which will take place between May 2 and September 4, 2023.\n\nAs the year nears its end, we’re thrilled to know that some magic already awaits us in 2023. Tickets for the tour can be booked now. Please note that you need to book your tickets in advance, so hurry before they’re all gone.\n\n⬆ Back to top\n\nWill Dunn's (James Sirius Potter) Report\n\nSo on Sunday, I went back to Leavesden Studios (Now Warner Bros Studios Leavesden I guess...) with some of the other Potterkids (yes, that's what we call each other) to see the Warner Bros. Studio Tour. IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD. That probably sounds like a shameless plug or something, but it genuinely is.\n\nSeeing the studios again after nearly two years was very, very odd; the place has completely changed, which for film crews and tour-goers is great, it was definitely a little strange for me personally though, even though I only shot there for a week.\n\nSO THE TOUR ITSELF. I don't want to give away too many spoilers... hmm. Well, for starters, there's a really cool-looking café at the start. That's not too spoiler-y, right? I ended up waiting at said café for a while; Ryan (Hugo) Ellie (Lily, Harry's mama, not daughter), and Ben (Young Sev!) had booked an earlier slot, and Helena (Rose) had gotten stuck somewhere in central London, thus I waited with a Sprite, people watching, as you do. So I now hold fond memories of that café, I recommend it, etc etc.\n\nWe started the first part of the tour by opening the huge doors into the Great Hall, and then the hangar after that had a huge collection of various sets from the series, which are just amazing to see in person, the amount of detail, and the obvious amount of effort that the set designers put into them, is just incredible. So props to them for that (did you see what I did there?!). There are parts of the Ministry of Magic set too, that especially took me back to when I did Potter; we all did our first rehearsal on that set, with the trio and David Yates, and all the crew. I remember being blown away by the size of it, not to mention the fact I was even there. I guess that was a reminder of how lucky I was to be part of it.\n\nThere's a part that involves brooms and green screens... I say no more.\n\nAnd then, the tour continues onward, but OUTSIDE. Yes, you heard me. OUTSIDE. And what could possibly make this outside-ness better? Butterbeer. And Hagrid's Bike. And the Knight Bus. Helena and I decided to hijack Hagrid's Bike, I got a little concerned I wasn't gonna get out of the sidecar after I got in, but I just about squeezed out.\n\nSo then, assuming you've finished your butterbeer (taking drinks indoors is a nono), we proceed onwards again to, if I recall correctly, GOBLINS. And SPIDERS. My mum got especially scared by the spiders. YAY. I believe I saw Warwick Davis' face in a mould somewhere too.\n\nIt was pretty crazy seeing all the different sections, and thinking of the sheer amount of people that worked on the films. I think the number that worked on DH was around 2000.\n\nI'm trying not to make this too much of a walkthrough, I have a feeling I'm failing. Oh well. This pic speaks for itself! Yes, it was huge.\n\nThen the wand boxes. To sum it up, pretty much everyone that played a part in the making of the films, no matter what they did to contribute, got a wand box, which are all in this section. I think this is a really cool touch, so often crew members get a place on the credits (or not even that) and that's it, cheers, you're done, bye! But here, the wand boxes give them the extra recognition that they definitely deserve. And let's be honest, having a wand named after you is more than cool.\n\nSeeing my own box was great too! Thankyouthankyouthankyou to Hannah who spotted Helena and me and showed them to us. And thanks for putting up with my requests for Jenny Harling and Jonny Greenwood, her knowledge of where they all are is pretty impressive... as is the enthusiasm of all the people that work there.\n\nAnd then, that was it. Worth it? Oh yus. The interactivity is so good, and it was a nice little nostalgic Potter top-up for me (I need one every now and again, don't we all?). I think (and hope) I can speak for the other kiddies in saying that we all loved it; we met up afterward for a meal and were raving about it.\n\nOh, I couldn’t resist doing this either.\n\n⬆ Back to top\n\nEllie Darcey-Alden's (Young Lily Evans) Report\n\nI think that my studio tour was absolutely amazing; it was a totally awesome adventure. My favorite part was either seeing the mini version of the Hogwarts Castle, riding on the broomsticks, or standing in the Great Hall again, I can't really decide which because they were all so fantastic. Standing in the Great Hall made me feel proud because I remembered being under the Sorting Hat, riding the broomstick was just so cool because I had never really done it before, and as for the miniature castle... well you have to see it to believe it, I think it should be the 8th Wonder of the world. Oh and I also loved finding the Wand Box with my name on it in the Wand room, I can't believe it really...\n\nEverything was mind-blowing, from art sketches to mechanical beasts like Aragog. It was mesmerising to see ALL of the sets and props they used from the first film all the way to the last. All of the crew put so much effort into the making; they had to make sure that every minor detail was correct like every strand of hair on the Goblins to every one of Buckbeak's feathers. It is totally incredible to think that all of this originated from the imagination of J.K. Rowling... Wow completely mind-blowing!!!\n\nI recommend a visit to everyone, I think they should go and experience this wicked adventure.\n\n⬆ Back to top"
