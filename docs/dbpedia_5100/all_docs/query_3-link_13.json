        "text": "Ellie Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Ellie is a girl's name of English origin meaning \"bright shining one\".\n\nEllie first took off in the UK—yes, in this nickname form—and this warm and friendly name has also become hugely popular here. In 2011, Ellie entered the US Top 100 girl names for the first time and has remained near the top of the charts ever since.\n\nEllie derived as a nickname for names beginning with El-, such as Eleanor, Ella, and Elizabeth. In fact, Ellie's biggest downside is that it's used as a nickname for so many names, and given so frequently on its own, that you are sure to hear it far more than you might guess. Ellie is the standard spelling, but Elly and Elli are occasionally seen as variations.\n\nEllie also has surprising international range, ranking highly not only in English-speaking countries but throughout Scandinavia and in Belgium and Switzerland.\n\nEllie has been making many media appearances. Most recently, she's the young heroine played by Bella Ramsey in The Last of Us, based on a popular video game. Ellie has also been seen in the animated film Up, on The West Wing, and even as a woolly mammoth in the film Ice Age: The Meltdown."
