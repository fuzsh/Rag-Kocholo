        "text": "Ellie May Darcey-Alden[2] (b. 4 September 1999[1]) is a former English child actress of film, stage and television who is best known for playing young Lily Evans in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. She is also known for playing Francesca \"Franny\" Latimer in the Doctor Who series 7 Christmas special, \"The Snowmen.\" Before joining such large franchises as Harry Potter and Doctor Who, she appeared in minimal parts in British theatre and television. She has also done small-time modelling, commercials, voice over work and competitive dancing.[1]\n\nCareer[]\n\n2009â€“2011: Harry Potter[]\n\nHer most notable role came in summer 2008 when she attended an open audition for the latest Harry Potter installment. It was not yet decided by the producers that the final book in the series would be split into two parts and once this decision was made, Darcey-Alden was expected to \"re-audition over a year later\" in December 2009 and \"luckily still met the height and role requirements.\"[6] She recalled:\n\nOn 25 January 2010, she was called back for a second audition at Pinewood Studios where she met director David Yates and worked with a number of other potentials for the parts of young James Potter, Sirius Black, Severus Snape and Lily Evans. During the process, the children were asked to improvise short conversations. She subsequently received a screen-test with then 13-year-old Benedict Clarke (who would be cast as young Severus Snape) \"as well as an associated costume, hair and makeup meeting\" at Leavesden Studios, where she met then 21-year-old actor Daniel Radcliffe on her first day.[8][9]\n\nAt a 2013 LeakyCon panel in Portland, Oregon, Dracey-Alden further elaborated on her meeting with Radcliffe. She said:\n\nRadcliffe reportedly setup the meeting, knowing Darcey-Alden had booked the part even though she was unaware at the time.[6]\n\nA few weeks later in February, her mother was contacted by the producers and after school, Darcey-Alden was told that she received the part of young Lily Evans, cast at age 10, in the commercially successful Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.[11][12] She said:\n\nIn the film, Darcey-Alden appears in a flashback sequence as Harry's mother in her schooldays and reveals how she befriended Snape as a child, which is crucial in explaining the back story of the shady professor and his complex relationship to Harry's deceased parents, particularly his bitter resentment to his father, James.[14][15]\n\nAlthough Darcey-Alden was tipped for future success by her agents at Enfield, London-based casting and theatrical agency A&J Management, her parents decided to not treat her passion for acting seriously until she was more mature. Despite this, she resisted her family for a chance in the business, especially for a part in Harry Potter, a role which her mother initially did not believe she would eventually win. When production began, she was not allowed to tell her close friends of her casting in Potter as she left school for Leavesden Studios and Hatfield House to film her scenes. She said:\n\nFilming her scenes along with Benedict Clarke (young Snape), Ariella Paradise (young Petunia), Alfie McIlwain (young James) and Rohan Gotobed (young Sirius) took place in April 2010.[18] Shooting only lasted four days where one scene was shot per day[19] while re-shoots and pick-ups were completed in early 2011.[20]\n\nAccording to Darcey-Alden and Clarke at a 2013 LeakyCon cast junket in London, production alternated between sets at Leavesden Studios and on location shooting by the River Lea in the gardens of Hatfield Park near Hatfield House in Hertfordshire. Of the river scene in particular, Clarke elaborated by saying:\n\nDarcey-Alden added:\n\nOriginally, it was planned for Darcey-Alden and Clarke to shoot a sequence on the reconstructed green screen set of King's Cross at Leavesden Studios with young Severus and Lily meeting inside the Hogwarts Express on their way to Hogwarts for the first time. Clarke was meant to call Darcey-Alden a \"Mudblood\" (much earlier than this occurs in Rowling's novels), leading to a rift between their characters and in their friendship. A Hogwarts Express scene does appear in the final shooting draft of the screenplay; however, no dialogue is present and most notable child characters, including Petunia, make an appearance along with Severus and Lily. Neither version was ultimately produced.[22][23]\n\nOnce location shoots were completed, Darcey-Alden and Clarke joined McIlwain and Gotobed at Leavesden on the set of the Great Hall where the set was divided with one section of the Entrance Hall in ruins for the Battle of Hogwarts sequences; two days of shooting were completed from morning until evening, scheduled a week apart where three hours of school tutoring was provided.[24] Darcey-Alden mentioned in a LeakyCon 2013 panel session that she worked with Dame Maggie Smith the first half of the day and was quoted, jokingly:[17]\n\nShe later said in detail:[25]\n\nA week later, a final day of shooting commenced in the Hogwarts corridor where multiple takes had the four child actors walk and run up the corridor numerous times. The original cut had McIlwain and Gotobed chase a first year Slytherin student, though this detail was eventually omitted. \"Though originally the scene was without dialogue,\" Gotobed revealed in a blog post:[24]\n\nTo satisfy the look of her character as described in the books, Darcey-Alden is naturally red-haired although she was required to wear blue contact lenses to match Daniel Radcliffe's eye colour, given her eyes are brown, as revealed by her co-star Benedict Clarke.[1][26] Darcey-Alden herself later confirmed that she wore contacts in January 2015 when she was a special guest in a Harry Potter celebration at the Riverview Middle School in New Brunswick, Canada. Through a a live Skype Q&A with a winning classroom, she said:[27][28][29]\n\nLater, on 23 July 2015, she released a photo on Twitter of herself with Daniel Radcliffe posing on the set of Harry Potter to celebrate Radcliffe's 26th birthday, which further supported the fact that she had worn blue colour contacts.[30]Darcey-Alden again stated in an interview on 1 December 2018 that she wore contacts for the entirety of shooting her scenes, saying:[31]\n\nIn the novels, Harry is described as having his mother's bright green, almond-shaped eyes, although Radcliffe never sported any colour-correcting contacts in the films due to a negative reaction to them; J. K. Rowling later commented on this by saying it was not an absolute need that Harry have green eyes in the films, as long as there was a resemblance between his and his mother's.[32] However, the method of using blue contacts ultimately backfired and Darcey-Alden's natural eye colour showed through in the final footage. For an unknown reason, this error was not digitally corrected in post-production, though it could be because of producer David Heyman's dissatisfaction with past attempts.[26][33][34][35]\n\nWhen later asked by a fan of what it was like to be apart of a popular movie franchise, Darcey-Alden commented:[36]\n\n2012â€“present[]\n\nDarcey-Alden has been cast in a variety of independent and larger budget films. It was announced on 20 July 2011 via the official A&J Management Twitter that she had been cast in a cameo role in Welcome to the Punch, a British thriller co-starring James McAvoy, Mark Strong and Harry Potter alum Peter Mullan.[37] She appeared briefly in the aeroplane scene seated in the opposite aisle from Elyes Gabel.[38] Other roles include Pranks, a children's ghost story;[39] and Sam & Isobel, a coming of age tale of two young enigmatic children.[40][41]\n\nIn 2012, she returned to the BBC for the Doctor Who series 7 Christmas special, \"The Snowmen\" as Francesca Latimer, sharing the screen with real-life brother Joseph Darcey-Alden as on-screen siblings and co-starring alongside Jenna-Louise Coleman and Matt Smith.[42][43][44] To date, Darcey-Alden is the latest in a line of Harry Potter cast members to have appeared in both Potter and Doctor Who, including David Tennant, Michael Gambon, Helen McCrory, John Cleese, Zoe Wanamaker, Jim Broadbent, Toby Jones, Roger Lloyd Pack, Bill Nighy, Shirley Henderson, Adrian Rawlins, David Bradley, and John Hurt.[45]\n\nOther work[]\n\nDarcey-Alden has appeared at many Harry Potter events and other fan conventions over the years, including the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 cast and crew screening in October 2010,[46] the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 world premiere on 7 July 2011 in Trafalgar Square in London,[16][47][48] LeakyCon 2011 in Orlando, Florida,[49] the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London: The Making of Harry Potter in October 2012,[50][51] LeakyCon Portland 2013, LeakyCon London 2013[52] and Misti-Con 2013 in Laconia, New Hampshire.[53] In December 2012, she along with Potter alum Ryan Turner (Hugo Weasley) participated in the Leighton Christmas Festival.[54][55]\n\nIt was announced that she would be returning to LeakyCon 2014, which took place in Orlando, Florida from 30 July to 3 August.[56] In January 2015, she appeared as a special guest in a Harry Potter celebration at the Riverview Middle School in New Brunswick, Canada via Skype.[27][28]\n\nOn 6 April 2016, she visited The Wizarding World of Harry Potter Opening at Universal Studios Hollywood on behalf of MuggleNet[57][58][59] where she interviewed Harry Potter co-stars Tom Felton, James and Oliver Phelps, Evanna Lynch and Warwick Davis as well as art director Alan Gilmore.[60][61][62][63][64]\n\nSelect filmography[]\n\nFilm and Television[]\n\nYear Format Title Role 2008 Television Tess of the D'Urbervilles (Series 1, Eps. 1-4) Modesty Durbeyfield 2009 Television Robin Hood (Series 3, Episode 1) Mary 2009 Television Holby City (Series 12, Eps. 1-2; 11) Emma Walker 2011 Film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 Young Lily Evans 2012 Short Film Pranks Katie Kruek 2012 Television Doctor Who (Series 7, Episode 6) Francesca \"Franny\" Latimer 2013 Film Welcome to the Punch 12-Year-Old Girl (cameo) 2013 Television Borgia (Series 2, Eps. 11-12; deleted scenes) Felice della Rovere 2014 Short Film Sam and Isobel Isobel 2018 Film The Nameless Executive producer 2019 Televison Remnants (Series 1, Eps. 1-13) Alice\n\nTheatre[]\n\nYear Format Title Role Notes 2007 Stage Play Aladdin Street Urchin Dir.

Coincidentally, each couple had decided to hyphenate their daughters' surnames.\n\nShe met the likes of Evanna Lynch, Jason Isaacs,[79] Emma Watson,[80][81][82], J. K. Rowling, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Miriam Margolyes and Rupert Grint,[83][20] at the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 world premiere on 7 July 2011 in Trafalgar Square, London.\n\nSince starring in Harry Potter, she has maintained a close acquaintanceship with fellow alum Daniel Radcliffe who she saw perform in The Cripple of Inishmaan at the NoÃ«l Coward Theatre.[84]\n\nIs friendly acquainted with Benedict Clarke, Will Dunn, Ryan Turner, Helena Barlow, Chris Rankin, Scarlett Byrne,[85] Robbie Jarvis,[86] Devon Murray,[87] and Evanna Lynch.[88][89]\n\nHer role as Lily Evans was formerly preceded by Geraldine Somerville (as the adult incarnation) and Susie Shinner (as the teenage incarnation), respectively.\n\nOn 28 February 2014, it was announced on MuggleNet that a fan-made Harry Potter prequel entitled The Gathering Storm by a group of students from Emerson College in Boston, MA was in the works and was successfully backed on Kickstarter.[90] Darcey-Alden took to her Twitter a day later that she was interested in auditioning for a part, implying that she hoped to reprise her role as Lily in a reply to the main announcement tweeted by MuggleNet.[91] However, upon learning that the required playing age of the key cast was 16 (she was 14 at the time),[92] she tweeted on 5 March that she thought she was \"too young\" in a reply to a tweet by The Gathering Storm official film Twitter regarding a deadline for open auditions through video application submissions.[93] The part of Lily Evans eventually went to Laura Tarver.[94]\n\nMany online sources have confused Ellie with fellow Harry Potter actress Daphne de Beistegui, possibly due to a slight resemblance in their appearances, as well as which young Lily each of them playedâ€”Harry's mother, the late Lily Evans or Harry's daughter, Lily Luna Potter.[95][96]\n\nSome online sources have also confused her or compared her looks with fellow Twilight actress Mackenzie Foy.[97][98]\n\nShe somewhat shares a stronger physical resemblance, as described in the books, to Ginny Weasleyâ€”ginger hair worn as a long mane, freckles and brown eyesâ€”than she does to Lily Evansâ€”dark, thick red hair worn to her shoulders and brilliant green, almond-shaped eyes.\n\nShe revealed to MuggleNet during a Leakyon Portland 2013 panel that the characters she relates to the most from Harry Potter are Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley. She stated, \"I think because a lot of the characters, the main characters in Harry Potter, they're all kind of [points to Scarlett Byrne and Devon Murray ] your age now growing up... so, it's kind of hard for me. But I think I'm probably part Ginny, part Hermione. Hermione, because she's, 'Books, books, books! School, school, school!' That's kind of me because I'm very 'school', very 'books.' But then Ginny, because she's a really friendly person; she likes to have a bit of fun. She's a bit 'risk takey'; sometimes she'll take risks and stuff, which is me sometimes, depending. [...] Yeah, probably between those two, because it's kind of difficult for me because also [Scarlett and Devon] are a lot older.\"[99]\n\nShe is a big fan of Muggle Quidditch, and was taught to play by members of the five National teams that participated in the 2012 IQA Summer Games (Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, France, and the United States).[100][101] She commented to CNN:[102]\n\nHas been allergic to gluten since she was seven.[103]\n\nHer preferred genre of film is comedy.[104]\n\nReferences[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nMcCabe, Bob.
