        "text": "Bollywood hotshots shifting focus to Marathi cinema: Sumeet\n\nRaghavan added that Bollywood bigwigs are shifting their focus to Marathi cinema, which is a huge thing for the regional film industry. Citing the example of Priyanka Chopra's \"Ventilator\", he said, \"The film did not have a star, but the content was terrific.\" The actor has also acted in Bollywood films such as \"U Me Aur Hum\", \"Firraq\", Akshay Kumar-starrer \"Holiday\" among others.\n\nPicky and choosy about my work: Sumeet\n\nRaghavan said that although he is offered a lot of projects both on television and in films, he doesn't give his nod until he finds something interesting. \"There are a lot of factors for me to do a film. I have been very picky and choosy about my work. I have stayed away from monotony or sub-standard work\" he added.\n\nMadhuri's Marathi debut film 'Bucket List'"
