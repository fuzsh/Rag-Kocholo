        "text": "The popular sitcom of the 80s, Wagle Ki Duniya, is back in a new avatar! People were waiting for the show with bated breath ever since the new version was announced. And now that it has finally aired on TV, people are showering love on the show. Wagle Ki Duniya, featuring Aanjjan Srivastav, Bharati Achrekar, Sumeet Raghavan, is all about depicting the world from the lens of a middle-class common man, which is very relatable.\n\nWith his new show going on air on February 8, Times Now Digital had an exclusive interaction with Sumeet, who plays the role of Rajesh Wagle in the show. In conversation with us, the actor spoke about his reaction when he was offered the show, similarities between him and his character, and much more.\n\nWhile talking to us, Sumeet revealed that he had no reaction when he was offered Wagle Ki Duniya. \"I did not have any reaction at all, to be honest with you. It was something that I did not expect. I was in college when Wagle Ki Duniya aired in 1988. I have watched all these shows and suddenly when you get offered these shows, I said JD (Majithia) and Aatish (Kapadia), let's do this. But when they offered me this show, I just couldn't say no. I was like boss I have to do this. And let us concentrate our energies and our efforts through this. Right from the channel to the producer, director, and writer, everybody is in sync with this show. It is a great feeling to be a part of history.\"\n\nThe actor further spoke in detail about his character, Rajesh Wagle. Sumeet mentioned that he draws a couple of similarities with him. \"I think I draw a couple of similarities with Rajesh Wagle. One is that he does speak his mind. He doesn't shove things under the carpet. He is an adoring son, he is Shravan Kumar. These are some of the qualities that I completely identify with it,\" said Sumeet.\n\nThe actor also pointed an issue which his character has. And that is: \"The problem with Rajesh Wagle is that he may take big decisions but when he goes to the market, he doesn't know which coconut to buy. For him, the biggest concern is that now I have come in this shop, main ye lu ya vo lu. There are such beautiful moments. It is going to be a fantastic ride with Aanjjan ji and Bharati ji in the show. So, Rajesh is a lucky man to have parents like Srinivas and Radhika.\"\n\nBefore Sumeet signed off, we asked the actor if the new version of Wagle Ki Duniya will be able to achieve cult status or not. To which, he concluded by saying, \"First of all, I am not going into any kind of comparisons. It is indeed a cult show and we have original faces with us in the show. So, they are the poster boys of the show and the son. Now, it is his journey with the help of his parents. So, I have two sets of kids - one is a senior kid and I have my own kid. So you know, this is a remarkable situation that we all face in our lives. Men of my age have to take care of parents and kids. It is that kind of a tightrope walk. We are making a show with a lot of innocence and simplicity.\""
