        "text": "A Dentist who is mocked by his father for not being a real doctor, has a passion for acting. He barges into the audition and convinces the writer Vasant Kanitkar and the producer that he is their Sambhaji in the play, Raigadala jeva jag yete and a typhoon, a madness is born that shakes the whole of Marathi theatre for times to come. He goes on to become the one actor on stage who makes people whistle in Marathi theatre, the first actor who gets an applause at his entry, whose name is announced last in the list of actors and he goes on to be one of his kind, the first superstar of Marathi Drama.\n\nThat craziness of memorable roles like Sambhaji,Lalya, Garambhi cha bapu, in plays that created history, those impulsive and whimsical decisions both in the face of little personal tragedies or inadequacies, as well as professional life makes for a heart racing biopic.\n\nSomehow, this biopic gave me a feel of Devdas in the eyes of Dr Kashinath Ghanekar. It says faintly that he was a, brat of Marathi theatre but there were those little insults and provocations by either his own people or lady luck that justified his bratty behaviour. It indirectly portrayed the pitiable strife of the son trying to seek approval and accolades from people which he failed to receive from his father.\n\nFor the first time I realized that Prabhakar Panshikar was not only a great actor but a great human being as well as a friend.\n\nAll the characters as famous actors and well known figures in Marathi Theatre have a done good job, Subodh Bhave has proved that he is an excellent actor and same with Anand Ingle as Vasant Kanetkar and Sonali Kulkarni as Sulochana. Even Sumeet Raghavan as the intellectual Shriram Lagoo is adorable. The plus point on the writer’s and the director’s side is that the roles of the characters are very well defined. They do not fray their boundaries.\n\nAnd lastly Kanchan Ghanekar from whose book the biopic has been inspired is one image of unconditional affection well portrayed by Vaidehi Parshurami.\n\nAll in all an informative as well as exciting portrayal of the crazy actor that Dr Kashinath Ghanekar was.\n\nThe movie for those like me who are not much aware of the history of Marathi theatre may seem clipped and reattached. The editing could have been better.\n\nI liked the last dialogue of the movie that the first clap that the actor gets becomes the curse for him for if not for the clap, the actor could have become many other things like a good husband, a good son or a good friend but that one clap makes him only a great actor that he became.\n\nA special mention of my friend Paritosh Pradhan, who has done the role of Raja Paranjape in this biopic.\n\nMaitreyee"
