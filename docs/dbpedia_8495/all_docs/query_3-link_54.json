        "text": "NEW DELHI: Seasoned theatre and TV actress Apara Mehta, who became a household name with the hit serial \"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi\", has been around in the industry for three decades, but she still yearns to play the full-fledged role of a prostitute.\n\n\"I have never got an opportunity to play the full-fledged role of a prostitute, but that's something I would really like to do. It would be a big challenge for me,\" Apara told IANS over phone from Mumbai.\n\n\"As a woman, however hard I try, I would not be able to put myself in a prostitute's shoes. I always wonder what would be so forceful that a woman has to sell her body. It will be extremely tough to play this role,\" she added.\n\nThe actress has done small roles of a similar nature in films like \"Devdas\" and \"Chori Chori Chupke Chupke\", but she wants a well-written role of a prostitute.\n\n\"I know I'm overage to play this role now, but I know if a role is written well, then age won't be a barrier,\" said Apara.\n\nApart from her powerful role in \"Kyunki...\", Apara has been associated with various Gujarati plays and serials. She has also been part of shows like \"Ek Mahal Ho Sapno Ka\", \"Saat Phere\", \"Karam Apna Apna\", \"Solhaah Shringar\" and \"Virrudh\" to name a few.\n\nHowever, she is still seen as Smriti Irani's mother-in-law in \"Kyunki...\" That doesn't bother her, says Apara, and she has made no conscious efforts to change her image.\n\n\"It doesn't bother me that people still remember me with 'Kyunki...' In fact, I feel proud because that was a show that changed television forever. The TRPs, the viewership, everything was phenomenal. I'm glad that I was a part of it,\" said the actress.\n\nWhen asked how comfortable she was with comedy, Apara, who is married to National Award winning actor Darshan Jariwala, said: \"To be honest, I'm only comfortable with comedy. I have done many comic plays and serials in Gujarati. But when it came to comedy serials in Hindi, I'd always be sceptical because I wanted to take up something that was well-written and outstanding.\"\n\n\"Sajan Re...\" also stars Sumeet Raghavan and Tiku Talsania. The rib-tickler that has been shot in Mauritius as well as Mumbai revolves round a guy who lies to his boss to get a job and what follows is a whirlpool of lies."
