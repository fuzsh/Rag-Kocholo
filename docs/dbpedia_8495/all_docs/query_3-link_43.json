        "text": "When Nana Patekar decides to do a Marathi movie, the audience stops and takes notice. This legendary actor of our times barely does a movie that doesn’t leave his audience with a bittersweet aftertaste, provoking as many thoughts as the shades of his character in the film. And now he is back with a loud bang (quite literally!) with the trailer of his latest crime thriller, Aapla Manus.\n\nIf you haven’t seen the trailer already, go and take a look at it as it’s going to bowl you over! The trailer begins with the veteran actor riding a bike into the storm, fearlessly. In this movie, he plays the role of a cop who won’t stop till he finds the culprit. Apart from Nana’s turn as an intimidating albeit good cop, you also get a sneak peek into cleverly written dialogues that perfectly portray the banter between the relentless detective and the usual suspect.\n\nAapla Manus also stars notable actors Sumeet Raghavan and Irawati Harshe, who play the lead couple in this mind-spinning thriller. The movie explores their lives and their complex relationship with Sumeet’s on-screen father, depicting how difficult it is to juggle the pressures of a big city life with the demands of different relationships.\n\nThe couple’s life takes an unexpected turn when the father drops dead and Nana’s character steps into the fray, making the couple question their beliefs and family values. Both Sumeet Raghavan and Nana Patekar can be seen at the top of their acting game in the trailer of this crime flick.\n\nNana Patekar calls his role in the movie a special one, referring to it as a character that “wouldn’t leave me even after the narration.”\n\nIf that hasn’t gotten you excited, what Nana Patekar said further of his character surely will: “He is a complex character, something that I have never played before in Marathi cinema. He is a man of few words, has a peculiar dialect and mannerism, a characteristic that makes him so unique.” So now you can pretty much expect Aapla Manus to be a rollercoaster of a ride!\n\nAapla Manus has been directed by Satish Rajwade of the Mumbai-Pune-Mumbai fame and has been produced by Bollywood’s very own super cop of the movies, Ajay Devgn. Devgn had recently Instagrammed a picture of him and his wife, Kajol, giving the first clap on the first day of the shooting of Aapla Manus.\n\nThe movie is set to release on 9th of February, 2018 and promises to be an experience that you’ll never forget."
