        "text": "By Aakriti Mehrotra\n\nIndian television has not had many sitcoms which have been equally appreciated by the class and the mass. The slapstick comedy of shows like ‘Hum Paanch’, ‘Had Kar Di’, ‘Tu Tu Main Main’, ‘Khichdi’ and more recently ‘Taarak Mehta ka Oolta Chashma’ did manage to find a rather large following, but to say that it has found acceptance with both sections of the society would be of erroneous nature.\n\n(I know I am probably angering the reader who has watched ‘Dekh Bhai Dekh’, ‘Shriman Shrimati’ and ‘Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi’. Apologies! Since I haven’t seen any of the three, I would refrain from including the three in this write-up in depth)\n\nHowever, there have been two Indian shows which found themselves being loved by the audience-Office Office and Sarabhai vs. Sarabhai. These two shows found a huge following in their own respective time.\n\nOffice Office starred one of India’s finest actors, Pankaj Kapoor in the role of ‘Mussadilal’, a commoner, who was exploited by corrupt government officials. From 2001 to 2004, SAB TV, got the best TRP from this show. This show gained mass appeal which resulted in the show returning on the small screen just after a gap of twenty four months in 2006, for three more years and the show being transformed on the silver screen in 2011. However, both these “homecomings” were disappointing. ‘Naya Office Office’ was not likened, forget loved, and the movie, ‘Chala Mussadi… Office Office’, completely bombed on the box office and was met with negative reviews. To be fair to the makers of the show and more importantly, notable cast members like Kapur, Deven Bhojani, Sanjay Mishra, let’s just say that Office Office found the hearts of multitudes in its time (time being the original run from 2001-04). Let’s just not link the two dismal follow-ups to the original show so cleverly directed by Rajiv Mehra (Yes, the same man who directed SRK-Naseeruddin Shah starrer ‘Chamatkar’ and shows like ‘Zabaan Sambhaal Ke’– the hindi remake of Mind Your Language; and Sharaarat).\n\nSarabhai vs Sarabhai went on for only about sixteen and a half months, from November 2004 to March 2006, but the show managed to charm Indians everywhere. People began calling the show ‘the only Indian show which can be represented on an International level’ from its young days. ‘Hats Off’ productions managed to air 70 episodes before taking an apparent hiatus (the last episode of the show had the characters stating that the show would return, in the form of another season possibly). However, it has been over seven years now and just like American sitcom ‘F.R.I.E.N.D.S’, viewers can only wish for Maya and Monisha coming back to woo us again.\n\nIn India, comedy shows are usually very loud and are more often than not, trying too hard to be humorous. These shows end up irking us rather than giving us something to laugh about. This was certainly not the case with this STAR ONE show. The actors live their each unique, hilarious characters with perfection and act out a witty, funny and sophisticated script.\n\nSatish Shah, who did hilarious cameos in one of the first sitcoms in India, ‘Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi’, plays the character of Indravadan Sarabha. His portrayal of the middle aged Gujrati, upper class man living in the upmarket Cuffe Parade area of South Mumbai, continues to make us fall off our chairs in laughter.\n\nRatna Pathak Shah plays Maya Sarabhai. Needless to say, she is outstanding and her comic timing could not have been better. She has completely transformed the sterotype of the Indian saas. No, it’s not that she showers Monisha (her bahu) with praise and affection. She still does all that you expect from the mother-in-law on television. But the manner in which she does is wonderfully unique and unheard of, so far. She manages to make even the most serious audience earnestly laugh.\n\nRosesh Sarabhai, played by Rajesh Kumaar is the funniest character on the show. He is the youngest child of Maya and Indravadhan and is his mother’s pet. Rosesh talks like a child, writes poetry like a child and is obsessed with his mother like a child. His poems have literally caused many to fall of their chairs. If not for the fine acting skills of Shah and Shah, watch the show for the poems of Kumaar. Kumaar has acted phenomenally well.\n\nThe role of Saahil’s wife, Monisha Sarabhai, is played by Rupali Ganguly. Monisha’s character is one of a typical middle class woman, committed to her husband, the end of tantrums from her mother-in-law, and one who tries to save as much money as she possibly can. She is disorganized, lazy and the apple of her father-in-law’s eyes. She has given idiocy a new dimension with her ridiculous questions and even more illogical reasoning to them.\n\nSumeet Raghavan plays the character of Saahil Sarabhai, the eldest son of Maya and Indravadhan. He is the most sensible person in the family and is constantly sandwiched between his mother and wife. Raghavan has managed to make this rather sober character a funny one and it does not feel for one second that Saahil is falling out of place with the dysfunctional family. He is perhaps dysfunctional in a very functional way.\n\nThe show has notable actors like Deven Bhojani (who is also the director of this show!), Rita Bhaduri and Arvinda Vaidya in recurring roles. This show has also guest-starred Mallika Sherawat, Mandira Bedi, singer Roop Kumaar Rathore and the cast members of Khichdi.\n\nFor the one complete year it aired, 2005, the show went on to win 5 Indian Telly Awards and 5 Indian Television Academy Awards.\n\nThis is by far the finest, best Indian television show I have seen till now, sitcoms and soaps alike. I, like many others, can only hope ‘Hats Off’ and Bhojani return with a second season. But even if they don’t, the 70 episodes will continue to make me laugh everytime I catch a rerun by mistake, or especially go on YouTube (STAR has thankfully put all 70 of them on YouTube) to do so.\n\nA humble suggestion to all of you, if you’re an Indian and watch American sitcoms like ‘F.R.I.E.D.S’, ‘How I Met Your Mother’, ‘The Big Bang Theory’, ‘Modern Family’ etc, and have yet not watched Sarabhai vs. Sarabhai; you should be ashamed of yourself. You’re missing out on a masterpiece. Sorry for getting all patriotic on you, but go and watch SvS. The entire Sarabhai following is judging you…"
