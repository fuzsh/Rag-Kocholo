Verma, a businessman. The couple has a son together. Rupali took a break from her career to take care of her family. In an interview with Hindustan Times, she said, “When my son was born in 2015, I didn’t want anything else, and just wanted to focus on him, and enjoy every millisecond of motherhood. I started late as a mother, so those moments were very precious for me.”\n\nRupali added, “When the show (Anupamaa) was offered to me, my husband said it’s high time I got my due as an actor. He has been managing everything since, single-handedly. I am never there, unfortunately.” Her husband is hands-on-father to their son, and the actress is extremely grateful to him.\n\nWe wish this epitome of women empowerment a hearty congratulations and hope that she flies higher and higher in her career."
