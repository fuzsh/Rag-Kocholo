        "text": "I humbly feel that in today’s world of 30 sec reels, when visuals of something you watched yesterday play in your mind continuously after you wake up, like your own personal movie-reel, the thing you’ve watched has had an everlasting impact you. I am writing at 6 30 am this after watching the film Ekda Kaay Zala yesterday.\n\nOutstanding is an understatement for this film : which deals with a powerful topic in an entertaining yet impactful manner. The story is simple but unusual. The child actors around the central theme make it easier to absorb the intensity and surge of emotions felt throughout the film.\n\nWatching Sumeet Raghavan, Urmila Kothare, Dr Mohan Agashe, Suhas Joshi together on the screen is a warm and intense experience. The background score along with all the 4 songs hit the bulls eye & elevate the experience to another level.\n\nChintan, the lead child role is a perfect cast and so are his friends Guru and Raghu. All the supporting cast fall right in the place and complete the puzzle into a meaningful one.\n\nSaleel Kulkari, thanks for making something so spectacular with umpteen highlights over emotions, relationships and morals in our mother-tongue.\n\nThis is not a paid review. This is an honest attempt at journalling my thoughts on the morning of its impact on me. I have deliberately written all of this in English as though this film is in Marathi, it has English subtitles and can be experienced by everyone. Please do not miss this gem!\n\nHere are two of my most favourite songs from the film\n\nI am sharing a few things which I loved about this film. (May contain spoilers, please read the forthcoming part after you have seen this film)"
