        "text": "‘Short films are such unique beasts’\n\nActor Harrsh A Singh whom we have recently seen in Mumbai Diaries 26/11 is on cloud nine as his recent short film Green Room : Thehrav won the audience award at the Cannes Film Festival. Speaking about the big win Harrsh says,” It's been a wonderful experience. We shot it in an empty flat in Powai.\n\nA small group of amazing creative funny people helped put the whole film together. These wonderful people from Misfit Motion Pictures It felt like a community effort. Everyone putting their heart and soul into this story. It's such a sweet and funny script. Totally an actor's script. All about what actors go through. It's only 2 actors in the whole film so it's even more important that we were convincing 8n our roles. Apart from me, actor Raj Chauhan is there and it's directed by Abhishek Krishnan who is the whizkid, - actor, director, entrepreneur.\n\nAbhishek and I met during our NCPA play Gandhi. We were acting together in that and then he sent me this script, which he wanted to direct. I said yes without even reading it. I would do it for Abhishek blindly. He's such a talented person and has my wicked sense of humour. Whenever we meet, we have some great quality time.”\n\nHe also adds,” Short films are such unique beasts. They can be totally a directors or an actor's medium. They don't really have to be box office hits so short film makers tend to be more experimental and they also give actors more breathing space. They are always different - fresher concepts, easier to make, less expensive to produce. I just wish there were more avenues to watch these films and I wish the audience would be more receptive to this format.”\n\nThis is Harrsh’s 6th short film. His last short film \"Ibadat\" won the Dada Saheb Phalke Award for best story. The year his other film \"Hello Mumbai\" won the Best Short Film at the National Short Film Awards. He has even written and directed one called \"The Good Girl\" which was nominated for best film and best actor at the NMIMS awards.\n\nDream come true\n\nEver since its premiere, Zee TV’s latest fiction show - Rishton Ka Manjha, has made a remarkable impression on the audience through its intriguing plot and relatable characters of Arjun (Krushal Ahuja) and Diya (Aanchal Goswami). The duo has already received immense love from the viewers for their adorable chemistry, and in a surprising twist, they will be seen getting married in a sudden manner. However, it is Diya’s wedding look that has already gone viral. The actress, who was seen in a chic Bengali bridal avatar, has suddenly become the talk of the town.\n\nTo showcase Diya’s character as authentic as possible, Aanchal had recently taken up an authentic Bengali bridal avatar for Rishton Ka Manjha’s upcoming wedding sequence. The actress looked gorgeous as she wore a red Banarasi saree embellished with golden details and embroidery to match the gold jewelry that she adorned. While her snaps from the set and promo have been trending, it looks like Aanchal had a gala time getting into such an avatar and shooting for this crucial sequence. In fact, the actress also revealed how Bipasha Basu was one of the biggest inspirations behind the look.\n\nShe reveals reveals, “I love the Bengali culture and I got really excited when I came to know that I'll have to shoot for a wedding sequence in Rishton ka Manjha. While playing Diya and embodying the Bengali culture has been pretty exciting, the show has also made my dream of being a Bengali bride come true.\n\nTech savy or not?\n\nOny SAB's Wagle Ki Duniya – Nayi Peedhi Naye Kissey catering to three different generations has struck a chord with the viewers, and its refreshing storyline is loved and appreciated across the country. The upcoming episodes will showcase Rajesh's (Sumeet Raghavan) enthusiasm as he takes up the challenge of learning coding for his official work.\n\nWith Kiara's, Rajesh’s boss, (Anju Jadhav) attempt to introduce technologically drivencoders into the company, Rajesh finds himself taking on a new challenge of learning how to code so that he is able to supervise his team.He takes up the challenge and asks for eight days from his boss to do a crash course. Everyone is surprised as Rajesh steps up to learn new technology through coding at the age of 40. He doesn't pay heed to the comments thrown at him for being ambitious, and after facing several hurdles, he finally joins a coding class. He co-incidentally lands into the same coaching centre as his son, Atharva (Sheehan Kapahi). It becomes difficult for Rajesh to grasp new things at the class as compared to Atharva, who does it effortlessly.\n\nWill Rajesh be able to keep up with the fast pace learning module like his son? Will he succeed in learning how to code in just eight days?\n\nSumeet Raghavan, essaying the role of Rajesh Wagle, said, \"It was a back to school situation for Rajesh and these episodes also took me back to my school days. I had a great time shooting for these episode as it was a lot of fun, and I had an opportunity of reminiscing old days. I believe that there is no end or a right age for learning. To learn anything new, one must have the right attitude and passion towards it.\""
