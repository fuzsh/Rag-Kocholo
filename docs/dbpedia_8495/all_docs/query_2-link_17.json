The actor was all of 16 when he played the role of Sudama in the show.\n\nThe epic show is being re-telecast on Doordarshan amid the nationwide lockdown. Fans were quick to spot Raghavan and shared the screenshots with the actor, asking if it was actually him.\n\nSpeaking to a daily, Sumeet said, \"I was very young when I bagged the role, and as excited as any new kid on the block. I was quite skinny at the time, probably thatâ€™s why I got the role! (laughs). We had barely shot for 3 to 4 days and I remember shooting the Sandipani Ashram portions in Film City and the rain dance sequence at Chena creek. Back then, I did not realise that I was going to be a part of history. But I do remember seeing Mukesh ji (Khanna) and Nitish ji (Bharadwaj) on the set. They were in their prime then, and I was completely in awe of them,\" he said.\n\nAlso see: Viewers spot an air cooler behind Bhishma in 'Mahabharat'; Twitter compares it to the 'GOT' coffee mug goof up\n\n\"Once the episodes were aired again, there was a flurry of questions on my social media. People were taking screenshots of the episode tagging me, asking, 'Is this you? We never knew you were a part of this epic show!' I am happy that I got to work with such revered actors and be a part of a classic like Mahabharat,\" he added."
