        "text": "New Delhi: BR Chopra’s Mahabharat continues to entertain viewers even decades after its original release and still enjoys a strong fan base. The epic drama is enjoying another successful run on Colors channel. Actors like Gufi Paintal, Punit Issar, Nitish Bharadwaj and Rupa Ganguly shot to overnight stardom after playing key roles in 'Mahabharat'. However, there is one more actor who essayed the character of adolescent Sudama and was recognized later for his role - Sumeet Raghavan. Sumeet played the character of Krishna’s friend, Sudama on the show. While he was just 16 years old back then, the actor shares that he had no inkling that the show will create history. He shares, “I was very young when I bagged the role, and as excited as any new kid on the block. I was quite skinny at the time, probably that’s why I got the role! (laughs). We had barely shot for 3 to 4 days and I remember shooting the Sandipani Ashram portions in Film City and the rain dance sequence at Chena creek. Back then, I did not realize that I was going to be a part of history.\" Also READ: Did You Know 'Naagin 3' Actor Chetan Hansraj Was Part Of Mahabharat & Played THIS Role? \"But I do remember seeing Mukesh ji and Nitish ji on the set. They were in their prime then, and I was completely in awe of them. Once the episodes were aired again, there was a flurry of questions on my social media. People were taking screenshots of the episode tagging me, asking, ‘Is this you? We never knew you were a part of this epic show!’ I am happy that I got to work with such revered actors and be a part of a classic like Mahabharat,” the actor further said in a statement.
