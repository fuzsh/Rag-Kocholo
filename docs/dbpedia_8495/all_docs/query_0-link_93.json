        "text": "The legendary Oscar Wilde once said, “I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being.” And in honour of the stage, March 27 is annually celebrated as World Theatre Day. Theatre allows us to gain a fresh perspective by exploring dialogue, monologue, and character, leading to greater empathy and understanding of what it means to be human. Over time, theatre has evolved significantly, and now its boundaries with TV and movies have become increasingly blurred.\n\nSumeet Raghavan, a versatile actor who has done TV and films in Hindi and Marathi, is currently portraying the character of Rajesh Wagle in heart-warming family drama Wagle Ki Duniya. Sumeet has always been vocal about his love for theatre. His acting journey began as a child actor when he took part in his first play. From thereon, his involvement in numerous theatrical productions eventually opened up other acting opportunities for him, both on television and in films. Even in his current role as Rajesh Wagle, Sumeet draws on his theatrical background to deliver raw and genuine emotions. He attributes his improved comic timing, ability to underplay a scene, and script comprehension to his work in theatre."
