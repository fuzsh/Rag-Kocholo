        "text": "Mumbai:Â The Mumbai Police are on the lookout for an unidentified but affluent person who behaved obscenely and masturbated before noted Marathi actress Chinmayee Surve-Raghavan on the afternoon of 19 February, an officer said.\n\nThe incident came to light after the woman’s husband and veteran actor Sumeet Raghavan lodged a complaint with Vile Parle Police and the Mumbai Traffic Police.\n\nLater, Raghavan tweeted about the incident and sought help to trace the culprit who was in a white BMW with the last four registration digits as 1985.\n\n“The driver wearing a grey safari who had parked near the Parle Tilak Vidyalaya School in Vile Parle east got off his car and started masturbating in front of my wife. Before she could slap him, he escaped. She could note down just the last four digits,” he posted on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nRaghavan added that the person needed to be found as there are schoolgirls in that area and he must have done this to them as well.Â After scanning the footage from CCTV in the locality and based on the number of the vehicle, police moved swiftly to trace the culprit within hours.\n\n“Yes, we have detained the 42-year old driver of the vehicle, identified as Jivan Choudhary and further investigations are underway,” Vile Parle police chief, Senior Police Inspector Laxman Chawan told IANS.\n\nRaghavan is an actor since the past 35 years with several teleserials and Marathi and Hindi films to his credit, while Chinmayee is also an acclaimed Marathi stage, teleserial and film actress.\n\nShortly after the incident was highlighted, the social media came out in support of the popular actor-couple."
