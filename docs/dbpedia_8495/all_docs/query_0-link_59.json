I never got an opportunity to meet Nilu Phule but I was thrilled to hear from his daughter that he was fond of one of my television serials”, said Raghavan.\n\nHe expressed concern over the condition of the public theatres in our country and said that condition of theatres in western countries is far more superior as their approach is to conserve and not renovate. He also opined that the folk and professional artists need to come together to and perform the the traditional folk art in a bid to save it."
