        "text": "Chinmayee Salvi, who is playing the character of Sakhi in the famous show 'Wagle Ki Duniya - Nayi Peedhi Naye Kissey' is celebrating her 20th birthday today (July 29). Her on-screen father Rajesh Wagle which is Sumeet Raghav wished her with a super sweet post.\n\nThe actor shared a picture of himself with Salvi on his social media handle. In the picture, the duo was all happy and smiling. They were ready in good looking ethnic wear. Sharing the picture on Instagram, he wrote, \"Well,this filmy daughter of mine introduced this song from the film \"Guna\". It is her birthday today so return gift de raha hu..hahaha.. Dedicating this song to her with lots of good wishes and love.Happy Birthday #Sakhi. जशी आहेस तशीच रहा. Always smiling... okay?? Promise #HappyBirthday @chinmayee_salvi \"\n\nThe duo shares a cordial on-screen and off-screen bond. They are often seen enjoying on the sets while shooting. Recently, the show completed a year of entertaining the viewers.\n\nFrom discovering a teenager's bond with her parents to handling sensitive problems with grandparents, to suddenly becoming the grown up elder sister dealing with a younger brother, Wagle has given me opportunities to perform scenes that will forever be close to my heart. Showing upon topics that are less spoken about is great, and I couldn’t be more thankful for the appreciation that the audience has showered on Sakhi. I just want to give a big shout out to all the fans out there that have followed my work up until now. You guys are just super sweet!”\n\nChinmayee expressed her excitement and shared that working with Sumeet Raghavan is an once-in-a-lifetime chance. She said, \"It’s been an wonderful journey, every single day has been amazing, working with the best team. Sharing the screen with actors like Bharati Ji and Sumeet Sir is an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I can’t thank my luck enough. Every moment that I have spent together with them is special, and we continue to make memories that we will cherish for life. Ever since I started playing Sakhi, I have explored my skills as an artist and have expanded my craft.\n\nGreat news for the people of MP! There will be heavy rain in these districts\n\nInd vs WI: KL Rahul replaced by this dashing batsman, will play T20 against WI"
