        "text": "Kiran Karmarkar who was to play a major character on Star One's upcoming show Resham Dankh has now been replaced by Sumeet Raghavan, who was earlier slated to play another character on the same show. Subsequent to this major change in the casting, the family drama has now undergone quite a few changes in terms of characters and script.\n\n\"The role offered to me now is much more challenging than the one offered earlier!\"-Sumeet Raghavan\n\nProducer JD Majethia says, \"We have re-started on a fresh note. Honestly, when we started off we took a lot of time. So after shooting four episodes, we made certain changes and started re-shooting.\"\n\nSo, were these change the reason for Kiran to leave the show? \"When we made the changes we needed more dates from him, but that was not possible for him as he had other commitments. So, we had to move on without him being a part of the show,\" says the producer.\n\nA source close to the production house reveals that they started re-shooting 15 days ago because of technical problems. He says \"The lights were not up to the mark, so they had to shoot all over again.\"\n\nSumeet Raghavan will now be playing Shantanu Balraj, Rahil Azam's elder brother on the show. Rahil essays the lead role of Aditya Balraj.\n\n\"When they approached me for Shantanu's character, I did take some time to think about the same, as the dates were clashing with Akela. But, as it was Hats Off production I was very confident, so agreed upon the same. Also, this role is much more challenging than the role I was offered before. My character is that of a drunkard, and has sarcastic undertones to it.\"\n\n\"Because of some major changes, we had to re-shoot everything!\"-JD\n\nSumeet Raghvan's earlier character will now be played by Jiten Lalwani who is currently been seen in Sony's Rishton Ki Dorr and was a part of Kyunkiâ€¦before the leap. \"Yes, I am doing Resham Dankh. My role is that of Aditya's (played by Rahil Azam) best friend, and later on the show we turn out to be business rivals,\" says the actor.\n\nApart from these changes, Rajiv Mehta aka Praful of Instant Khichadi and Dimple Shah, a famous Gujarati actor who was last seen in Kudkudiya House No 42 on Sony will also be seen on the show.\n\n\"They have always been a part of the show, but were to enter the track after the ninth episode. But then as it's a family drama, we thought that a house with only six people won't look good enough. In fact, it would look very empty, so now the audience will get to see everyone from the very beginning itself,\" affirms JD.\n\nWe hope after a clump of changes it lives upto everyone's expectations!"
