        "text": "Popular TV sitcom, Sarabhai vs Sarabhai, ended a decade ago, in 2006. Its cast members, Ratna Pathak Shah, Satish Shah, Rupali Ganguly and Rajesh Kumar — who made us laugh, and laugh even more — with their characters and wit on the show, went on to take part in other projects once the show went off air. Here’s what they’re up to.\n\nRatna Pathak Shah: She played the role of Maya Sarabhai, an elite mother-in-law, who left no opportunity to tell her daughter in law that she is “downmarket”. Ratna has been part of many films since then. Some of these include Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na (2008), Golmaal 3 (2010) and Kapoor & Sons (2016). Her latest film Lipstick Under My Burkha was in the news when the film was refused certification by the Censor Board.\n\nSatish Shah: He played Maya’s husband Indravadan on the show. The actor was last seen in the film, Humshakals in 2014. He has also been part of films such as Khichdi: The Movie (2010), Bhootnath (2008) and Ra.One (2011).\n\nSumeet Raghavan: Sumeet Raghavan played the role of Sahil on the show and was seen as the constant mediator between his wife Monisha and mother Maya. The actor has been part of comedy shows such as Ghar Ki Baat Hai and Sajan Re Jhoot Mat Bolo. He was in the news for turning VJ with the show, Raina Beeti Jaaye. Last year, he was part of the show Badi Dooooor Se Aaye Hai.\n\nRupali Ganguly: Rupali played Monisha, Maya’s typical ‘middle-class daughter-in-law’ on the show. Since then, the actor has been part of fiction shows such as Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii, Kkavyanjali and Aapki Antara, as well as reality shows such as Bigg Boss season 1 and Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi season 2. Rupali was last seen in Parvarrish – Kuchh Khattee Kuchh Meethi in 2013, after which she got married to businessman Ashwin K Verma and was blessed with a baby boy.\n\nRajesh Kumar: Inarguably the most popular character of the show, Rajesh Kumar played the role of Rosesh. Last year, the actor was seen in the show Neeli Chatri Waale and Badi Dooooor Se Aaye Hai. The actor currently essays the role of Yamraj in Yam Kisi Se Kam Nahin."
