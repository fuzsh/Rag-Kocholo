Actor Sumeet Raghavan, best known for his role in TV series 'Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai' was part of BR Chopra's epic show 'Mahabharat'. The actor was all of 16 when he played the role of Sudama in the show.

The epic show is being re-telecast on Doordarshan amid the nationwide lockdown. Fans were quick to spot Raghavan and shared the screenshots with the actor, asking if it was actually him.

Speaking to a daily, Sumeet said, "I was very young when I bagged the role, and as excited as any new kid on the block. I was quite skinny at the time, probably thatâ€™s why I got the role! (laughs). We had barely shot for 3 to 4 days and I remember shooting the Sandipani Ashram portions in Film City and the rain dance sequence at Chena creek. Back then, I did not realise that I was going to be a part of history. But I do remember seeing Mukesh ji (Khanna) and Nitish ji (Bharadwaj) on the set. They were in their prime then, and I was completely in awe of them," he said.

"Once the episodes were aired again, there was a flurry of questions on my social media. People were taking screenshots of the episode tagging me, asking, 'Is this you? We never knew you were a part of this epic show!' I am happy that I got to work with such revered actors and be a part of a classic like Mahabharat," he added.
