Good luck Kaja!”\n\nEstonian S&D MEP Marina Kaljurand said that Kaja Kallas’ government has not yet taken office and is already making history, not only with Kallas becoming the country’s first female prime minister, “but even more important than one position is that half of the members of the government are women.”\n\nDutch deputy Sophie in 't Veld said, “Congratulations to the new Prime Minister of Estonia, Kaja Kallas, adding, “Best wishes to the new, gender-balanced, pro-European, reform-minded government!”\n\nFinnish member Nils Torvalds said, “Congratulations Kaja Kallas, my good friend, on forming a government in Estonia!
