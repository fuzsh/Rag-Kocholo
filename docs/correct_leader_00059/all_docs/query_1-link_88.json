        "text": "Tallinn,March 8, 2002Prime Minister Siim Kallas had a meeting today with Finnish President Tarja Halonen. The talks concentrated mainly on issues related to the European Union, including the issues discussed yesterday in Brussels on energy and agriculture. Before meeting with the Estonian Prime Minister, Halonen was on an official visit to Lithuania where she gave a speech. The Finnish Prime Minister emphasized that accession to the European Union was a very long process for Finland and Sweden. At the same time, the accession process for current candidate states is much faster, and such a pace is the only possible option, noted Halonen.\"I have told the leaders of candidate states that paying more attention to a social balance would help people better understand the European Union,\" said Halonen.Prime Minister Kallas stressed that the progress of negotiations with the European Union is extremely vital for Estonia. The proposals the European Commission has made regarding financing agriculture are provisional. According to Kallas, the proposed principles are generally reasonable, but Estonia stresses the importance of being treated equally in the European market and reaching production quotas that satisfy Estonian producers.Prime Minister Kallas and the President also discussed the cooperation and security policy in the Baltic Sea region as well as bilateral relations. Siim Kallas was pleasantly surprised that the Finnish President is studying Estonian.Sincerely,Hanna Hinrikus Government SpokespersonTelephone 693 5792GSM 051 85427www.riik.ee/press"
