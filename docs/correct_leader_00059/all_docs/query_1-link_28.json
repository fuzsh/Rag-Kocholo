        "text": "Estonia’s popular foreign minister resigned from her post on Friday to launch a campaign and bid for the country’s highest office of the president, according to the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.\n\nMarina Kaljurand is up against former prime minister and European Commissioner Siim Kallas, who has the official backing of the Reform Party although Kaljurand is very popular with its supporters. She will also face Mailis Reps of the opposition Center Party and candidates from some smaller parties.\n\nKaljurand said she would “stand as a rock for Estonia.”\n\nSpeaking after her announcement, Estonia’s Prime Minister and Reform Party Chairman Taavi Rõivas, said: “Although it can be expected that in the case of multiple candidates with a similar worldview, both candidates’ odds are diminished, running for president is Kaljurand’s personal decision and constitutional right.”\n\nWith only two weeks to go before the vote in an 335-strong electoral college made up of MPs and local government leaders, Kaljurand must now collect 21 signatures to get her name onto the ballot.\n\nThis is the fourth attempt to nominate a president to take over from the incumbent, Toomas Hendrik Ilves. Previous votes in the country’s parliament were inconclusive since the support of two-thirds of MPs was needed to win — something the frontrunner Kallas was unable to secure.\n\nAlthough the Estonian presidency is largely a ceremonial post, Ilves has effectively used the position to build his country’s reputation abroad at a time of growing concerns about Russia’s perceived threat to the Baltic countries.\n\nAlso On POLITICO"
