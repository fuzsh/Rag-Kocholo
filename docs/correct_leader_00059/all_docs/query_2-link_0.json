        "text": "Kallas, who founded the liberal Reform party and was prime minister from 2002-03, announced last week that he wanted to be prime minister, to succeed Andrus Ansip, the current prime minister.\n\nKallas said that the party’s candidate should have a year to prepare a programme for the elections in March 2015. If Kallas is selected, he might leave his post as commissioner as early as this spring, several months before this Commission’s mandate expires on 31 October.\n\nAnsip, who has been in office since 2005, making him the longest-serving prime minister in the EU, is interested in becoming Estonia’s European commissioner. Kallas has said that there are other good candidates to lead the Reform party, including Urmas Paet, the current foreign minister, and Kaja Kallas, his daughter, who is an MP. She is standing for election to the European Parliament.\n\nKallas, who is 65, said that his prime motivation for a second stint as prime minister was to organise Estonia’s presidency of the Council of Ministers in the first half of 2018.\n\n“It is an opportunity to show the so-called ‘Old Guard of Europe’ how much better we are compared to them,” he said."
