        "text": "SPEECH/07/343\n\nSiim Kallas\n\nVice-President of the European Commission responsible for Administrative Affairs, Audit and Anti-Fraud\n\nCorruption and conflicts of interest: red lines and grey areas\n\nBritish-Estonian Chamber of Commerce\n\nTallinn, 25 May 2007\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nNowadays corruption is no longer a taboo subject. As private and public organisations around the world set up ethics offices, every organisation needs to ask itself whether enough is being done to prevent conflicts of interest causing scandal. As vice-president of the European Commission, I am in charge of some 27 000 staff working for the institution, administering a budget of some 110 billion euros a year. In my field of personnel and financial management, an image of fraud and waste of money is maybe the single most important obstacle for the Commission to improving its reputation as a trusted institution working for the European good.\n\nIn Europe, thanks to legislation, active and passive corruption of officials is a criminal offence with clear penal sanctions and we have a sound legal framework in place. However, if we define corruption as abuse of institutional power for personal interests there is a large grey area of unethical behaviour which, even if it is not criminal, should not be tolerated. Increased transparency on use of public money and decision making, together with agreed principles of ethical conduct, are key to closing off corruption and weeding out questionable activities. In these fields, the European Commission is actively going beyond a rules-based approach. Let me elaborate:\n\nThe red line: corruption is a criminal offence with penal sanctions\n\nThe European Commission is the executive arm of the European Union. [1] Even though the Commission has no immediate jurisdiction over anti-corruption legislation and enforcement within the EU Member States, with the support of the European Parliament and the Member States, it is promoting good governance and endeavours to reduce corruption at all levels within the EU institutions, in EU Member States and outside the EU.\n\nIn the EU and for the protection of the financial interests of the EU we have a sound system and legal framework in place. The fact that many provisions are fairly recent testifies to the new awareness of the harmful consequences of corruption. Let me present briefly the main elements:\n\n-\n\nThe Commission has promoted legislation criminalising active and passive corruption of officials [2] . In June 2003, it adopted a communication which calls for the detection and punishment of all acts of corruption, confiscation of illicit proceeds and reduction of the opportunities for corrupt practices through the establishment of transparent and accountable public administration standards. It appeals to Member States to enact swiftly all relevant supranational and international anti-corruption instruments, in particular the conventions of the EU, the OECD and the Council of Europe.\n\n-\n\nThe Commission supported EU legal instruments that oblige Member States to ensure that corruption in the private sector constitutes a criminal offence [3] A Protocol to the Convention on the Protection of the EC Financial Interests, adopted in 1996, criminalises both active and passive corruption of national and Community officials, where such corruption damages the EU budget. In May 1997, another EU convention made active and passive corruption of officials punishable offences, even where financial damage to the Union is not affected. It covers the criminal liability for heads of businesses and contains provisions on jurisdiction, extradition and international cooperation. This was followed up in 1997, by a second protocol which has provisions for the criminalisation of money laundering and the proceeds of corruption, which introduced liability to legal persons in cases of fraud, active corruption and money laundering, and which provided for the possibility of confiscation of these proceeds or the corresponding property.\n\nFor all these legal instruments, we need a joint effort for effective application.\n\nBeyond these sanctioning provisions, we recognise that good governance means more than just the fight against corruption. Since corruption often is a symptom of poor governance and of a lack of transparent, accountable management and control systems, strategies to fight corruption must be considered a cross-cutting issue. The Commission follows a broad approach to governance related to the political, economic, social spheres and based on principles that apply to the main functions of government and to the interaction between public institutions and citizens. The European Commission promotes various measures to prevent and combat corruption.\n\nClear rules and strong bodies within the European administration\n\nBuilding on earlier structures within the European Commission, the EU created, in 1999, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), in charge of the fight against corruption and fraud affecting the EU budget. OLAF is an office of the Commission but carries out its investigations in full independence. [4] It investigates corruption and fraud affecting the EU budget, as well as misconduct within the European institutions. OLAF assists EU and national authorities in their fight against fraud, by fraud proofing, prevention, deterrence and strengthening of legislation, making it more difficult for fraud and irregularities to occur.\n\nSince 1999, the Commission has implemented a number of other measures to fight fraud and corruption inside the institutions, ranging from a state-of-the-art accounting system, a completely modernised administration with a new internal audit culture, a disciplinary office and whistleblower provisions.\n\nOn the basis of the experience gained, the Commission and OLAF are currently working on:\n\n-\n\nimproving the availability and comparability of data on fraud and corruption;\n\n-\n\nimproving the exchange of information about unreliable economic operators _more commonly known as 'blacklisting'.\n\nAlthough the public is generally aware that corruption in the EU institutions is no higher than at national or local level, there are some EU Member States where public suspicion surrounding the activities of European institutions, especially the handling of finances by the Commission, is significant. According to actual experience, corruption is likely to be less widespread in the EU institutions than elsewhere, due to the reinforcement of internal audits, controls _ and to the work of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.\n\nFor example, the UK House of Lords recently scrutinised [5] the European Commission and concluded that none of the evidence examined would support the allegation that there is a significant element of corruption within the Commission. The Lords also concluded that the level of fraud against the EU budget is no higher than in comparable public expenditure programmes, including in the UK.\n\nThis brings me to my last part:\n\nThe grey area: dealing with conflicts of interest by moving beyond rules\n\nThe rules and legislation have drawn the red line of what is punishable corruption. Even though we cannot prevent nasty cases from happening, we have in the European system the tools to detect and sanction it. The difficulty in the modern world resides in the largely untackled grey area of dubious behaviour.\n\nWhat do I mean?\n\nIf we define corruption as abuse of institutional power for personal interests, there is a large area of unethical behaviour which, even if it is not criminal, is nevertheless highly damaging. This grey area is also characterised by other types of fraud and irregularities, often a large black economy and underground and informal transactions. All these have in common that they considerably reduce the transparency and possibility to control and hold accountable. It creates an endemic atmosphere or culture of biased decisions where paying for service will be considered 'oiling the machine'. Such actions foster an atmosphere where corruption, nepotism and abuse of power can thrive. In the longer term, it will undermine the authority of any administration and public authority. This is still the case in various countries.\n\nIntegrity is a core principle for the European administration. As I explained in the first part of my speech, the rules are clear and the structures are in place. But we must recognise that the grey area _ the question of conflict of interests _ is a complex one that spares no one. It relates to acceptance of gifts or invitations, outside activities, previous activities, diverging loyalties, activities of spouses, \"revolving doors\", disclosure of financial interest, etc. _ the area is vast.\n\nAnd conflict of interest is an area that it is almost impossible to solve by way of rules alone.\n\nIt is also a question of culture and personal appreciation. What is acceptable behaviour?\n\n'Circumstances alter cases'. (ascribed to Cicero.)\n\nIt leads to questions such as:\n\n-\n\nthose surrounding the Wolfowitz affair (special severance package and pay increase for partner who also worked in the World Bank);\n\n-\n\nthe French finance minister Hervé Gaymard, who had to quit his post in February 2005 because he had a 600 m2 apartment paid by the state, when he in fact possessed various property;\n\n-\n\nend of 2004, the UK Home Secretary David Blunkett resigned after it emerged that his office had fast tracked a visa application for his ex-lover's nanny;\n\n-\n\nthe question of the payments made by BAE systems (British Aerospace) for contracts with Saudi Arabia, the investigation of which by the Serious Fraud Office had to be closed for reasons of \"public interest\";\n\n-\n\nthe job taken by the German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder in Gazprom shortly after ending his political mandate;\n\nand the list could be continued.\n\nEthical dilemmas arise because rules conflict, or miss the mark, or otherwise seem likely to produce adverse unintended consequences in a given case. As a multicultural organisation, the European Commission faces complex questions. In its multidisciplinary approach, the Commission has developed a number of actions that can be classified as integrity-enhancing and which I would like to expose here because I truly believe that they can serve as examples for others.\n\nResponse No 1: the transparency initiative\n\nOver the last two years, I have led the Commission to initiate further efforts to improve governance:\n\nThe European Transparency Initiative has, as a dual objective, to provide information as regards the use of all public funds from the EU budget; and to ensure the greatest possible transparency in public decision-making processes by introducing clear disclosure rules on lobbying in EU institutions. The transparency initiative draws particular attention to lobbyists, pressure and interest groups, where the borderline between legitimate expression of interests and illicit influence peddling is sometimes very blurred. In this area we are promoting a voluntary register and adherence to a code of good conduct. On the use of money, we have been able to convince Member States to join the Commission efforts to publish the use of subsidies financed by the EU budget. This will be compulsory and information should be easily accessible via the internet. This objective was attained already last December, only two years after the idea was launched.\n\nFor a complex governance system like the European Union, communicating openly and honestly how decisions are taken and funds are used is a major communication challenge in which transparency is a win-win situation: it is beneficial for the administration and the public alike. Transparency plays an enormous role in promoting a more citizen-friendly EU and thereby helps to increase public trust in the institutions. The EU needs the latter as it helps to `clear the fog' and focus the discussion on real issues to be resolved at the European level.\n\nResponse No 2: the ethics initiative\n\nAlready as part of the transparency initiative, the Commission has ordered a comparative study on existing codes of conduct for public office holders. Based on this, I would like to encourage a broad debate about integrity. Raising awareness is a key element in fighting corruption and misbehaviour.\n\nLately we are raising the awareness of our staff on ethics in professional life, including questions of integrity and conflicts of interest. Last July, we organised an ethics day to discuss concrete, if invented cases. It was a huge success.\n\nMore recently the European Commission has launched a new initiative, aimed at its staff, to discuss and define principles of ethical professional behaviour. We need to develop common standards and basic ethical reflexes. We need a reasoned application of principles, not blind obedience. The value of codification is limited when dealing with complex issues. By their very nature, codes of ethics cannot prescribe actions for every possible case that might arise. A `strict compliance' approach discourages officials from developing the necessary judgement skills to be reliable at resolving complex matters, or situations not covered by their institution's code. Staff should be fully involved, and international best practice will be studied.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIn Europe as a whole, and in the European Commission's administration in particular, we have a strong set of rules with sanctions, and a detection mechanism that works. The red lines are painted thick and clear.\n\nThe challenge we face today is to move beyond a culture of compliance, and towards one of shared principles of ethical behaviour. To deal with the grey area of conflicts of interest, instead of layers and layers of rules, how much can we achieve with a modern philosophy of openness, trust in staff and responsibility of judgement for the individual?\n\nTo tackle the grey area, we need transparency of our decision making and financial management, shared ethical principles and broad awareness _ what I sometimes like to call an ethical space _ and a public opinion and media that will not tolerate contravening them. It's a matter for all of us, and not the legislator or the administration alone.\n\nI thank you for your attention and look forward to the discussion.\n\nother sources :\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/crime/economic/fsj_crime_economic_en.htm\n\n[1] http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm\n\n[2] Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union, OJ C 195, 25.6.1997.\n\n[3] Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector, which repealed the Joint Action of 22 December 1998 adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on corruption in the private sector, OJ L 358/2 31.12.1998.
