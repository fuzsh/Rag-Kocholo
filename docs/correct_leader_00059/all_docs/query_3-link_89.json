        "text": "Tallinn, Stenbock HouseJune 8, 2002Today's meeting of Prime Minister Siim Kallas, Defence Minister Sven Mikser and United States Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at Toompea focused on such important issues for Estonia as integration to NATO and the European Union; and relations with Russia. Kallas described to Rumsfeld the reforms the Estonian Defence Forces are undergoing and assured that Estonia has a modern concept about the development of defence forces. \"We know that the nature of military risks has changed, and today the ideas of war from the Second World War are out of place,\" added the prime minister. Kallas confirmed Estonia's preparedness to make its contribution in improving overall security; the clearest example of it is Estonia's solid wish to maintain the defence expenditure at least on the 2% level of GDP. Rumsfeld also dwelled on the issue of changed security risks and described his foreign policy meetings around the world. \"After the 9/11 attacks on the USA, the world has become acutely aware of the danger that a means of mass destruction possessed by terrorists impose, and the danger when it is attempted to take some religions `hostageÂ´ and used for terrorist purposes,\" mentioned Rumsfeld.According to Kallas, Estonia welcomes the recent positive changes in the relations between NATO and Russia. As Kallas put it, for Estonia it is very important to get rid of the constant sense of danger from the back of our minds. \"We wish that Estonia would never be the object of a big international conflict; we do not wish to live beside a hostile neighbor,\" stated Kallas. At Rumsfeld's request, Kallas gave an overview of Estonia's accession to the EU.Government Press Office"
