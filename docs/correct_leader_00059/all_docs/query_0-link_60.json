        "text": "The Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has been put on Russia's wanted list, accused of destroying monuments and memorials to Soviet soldiers who fought against Nazism. Kallas ended up on the Kremlin's blacklist along with some ministers, mayors and municipal councilors from the Baltic countries. This move confirms the strong tensions between Moscow and the NATO Eastern flank countries, among the most convinced supporters of the hypothesis that Russia, after Ukraine, is preparing to attack the Atlantic Alliance. But who is Kaja Kallas? Why does Putin want her?\n\nRussia threatens Estonia, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas on the wanted list: here are all the European politicians in Putin's sights\n\nWho is she\n\nKallas is the daughter of Siim Kallas, former Estonian Prime Minister and former European Commissioner for Transport. During the Soviet deportations from Estonia, her mother Kristi, who was six months old at the time, was deported to Siberia with her mother and grandmother on a cattle car and lived there until she was ten years old. Her grandfather Eduard Alver was one of the founders of the Republic of Estonia and the first chief of Estonian police. Kallas began her career working as a lawyer in the field of European and antitrust law. She became a member of parliament in 2011 and in 2018 and the same year Secretary of the Estonian Reform Party. The executive chaired by Kallas took office in 2021. After a turbulent legislature, culminating in her resignation, she was given a new mandate in 2023.\n\nThe clash with Moscow\n\nPrime Minister Kallas has described the Russians' announcement as proof that she herself is \"doing the right thing\" and added that she will continue to ensure her \"strong support for Ukraine\" and to fight to \"strengthen Europe's defense\". \"The Kremlin now hopes that this decision will silence me and others, but it will not be so\", Kallas added in a message on X. The Minister of Culture of Lithuania Simonas Kairys, recipient of a similar measure from Russia, stated that Moscow is \"trying to stifle freedom\".\n\nThe accusations\n\nMoscow's decision stems from an investigation initiated by the head of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, against 170 people, including citizens of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and Ukraine, for 143 acts of destruction, damage or desecration of tombs, monuments and memorials of Soviet soldiers. The three Baltic States, annexed in 1940 to the Soviet Union and then occupied by Nazi Germany, returned under Moscow's control at the end of the Second World War, to gain independence in 1991 with the collapse of the USSR.\n\nThe wanted list\n\nAmong others, the former Minister of the Interior of Latvia Marija Golubeva and three current Latvian ministers accused of having voted in 2022, when they were members of Parliament, in favor of a law that allowed the destruction of Soviet monuments: Armands Krause (responsible for Agriculture), Arvil Asheradens (Finance) and Inese Libina-Egnere (Justice). According to Peskov, the accused are responsible for \"hostile actions\" and have made decisions that are \"an outrage to the historical memory\" of Russia."
