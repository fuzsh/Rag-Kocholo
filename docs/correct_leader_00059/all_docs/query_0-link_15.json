        "text": "Brussels,April 8, 2002Press releaseToday at the session of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) in Brussels, the Prime Minister, Siim Kallas, the Minister of Defence, Sven Mikser, and the Commander of Defence Forces, Vice Admiral Tarmo Kõuts, explained Estonia's preparedness to join NATO for the last time before the Prague summit. The Prime Minister focused mainly on the developments in Estonia over the last several months, last year's economic results, the sustainability of the economy, and public support in his speech. Siim Kallas assured the NATO council that Estonia wishes to keep defence expenditures at 2% of GDP. \"The Estonian economy has continuously grown over the last few years. We have already raised our defence expenses to 2% of GDP starting 2002,\" said Kallas. \"We plan to maintain this level in the future,\" the Prime Minister confirmed. The Minister of Defence Sven Mikser emphasized in his speech the realistic nature of Estonian new defence plans and assured that Estonia is on the right course. \"The work on our combat readiness goes as planned, we have full financial coverage and the previous preparation activities have been excellent,\" told Mikser to Council. The goal of the Prime Minister's speech was to provide answers to previously posed questions from member states and clarify the information that has changed since Estonia submitted its progress report to NATO. If Estonia receives an invitation to join NATO at the Prague summit, the accession protocol will be prepared and signed within half a year. According to previous international practice, it will take about a year or a year-and-a-half from the signing of the accession protocol before a nation becomes a full member since the accession protocol needs to be ratified by the national parliament. If NATO invites Estonia to join the alliance in November at the Prague summit, said Kallas, then Estonian security will have the best guarantees it has ever had in its history. NAC is NATO's higher decision-making body, being comprised of the representatives of all member states. The council meets on a regular basis in Brussels on the ambassadorial level and at least twice a year at the foreign ministers' level. Estonia has been to asked to participate in the 19 + 1 format (member states and Estonia) for a third time. The Prime Minister was accompanied to the meeting by the Minister of Defence, Sven Mikser, the Commander of Defence Forces Vice Admiral Tarmo Kõuts, the Estonian Ambassador to NATO, Sulev Kannike, the employees of the Prime Minister's Office, and officials from the Defence Ministry and Foreign Ministry. The Prime Minister will return to Estonia on Tuesday afternoon. For additional information contact: Hanna Hinrikus Government Spokesperson Telephone +372 51 85427"
