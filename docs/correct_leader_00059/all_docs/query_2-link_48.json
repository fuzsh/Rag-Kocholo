        "text": "For Immediate Release\n\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\nContact: 202-282-8010\n\nBRUSSELS—Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano today traveled to Paris and Brussels to meet with her counterparts and discuss the Department’s collaboration with international partners on information sharing, cybersecurity, and facilitating legitimate trade and travel.\n\nIn Paris, Secretary Napolitano met with Secretary General for Defense and National Security Francis Delon and Minister of the Interior Manuel Valls. Secretary Napolitano then traveled to Brussels where she met with Belgian Minister of the Interior Joëlle Milquet, senior representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Vice President of the European Commission and Commissioner for Transportation Siim Kallas. Secretary Napolitano will meet with World Customs Organization (WCO) Secretary General Kunio Mikuriya tomorrow to discuss international collaboration to secure the global supply chain while facilitating trade.\n\nThe international community has made significant progress in protecting the global supply chain through Program Global Shield, which was launched in 2011 in collaboration with the WCO, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and Interpol. As part of Program Global Shield, 90 participating nations and international organizations share information in an unprecedented law enforcement effort aimed at combating the theft or illegal diversion of chemicals that can be used to make Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). As of June 2012, Program Global Shield has accounted for 41 seizures of chemical precursors totaling more than 126 metric tons related to the illicit diversion of these chemicals.\n\nYesterday, Secretary Napolitano traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark where she joined Attorney General Eric Holder and her European counterparts for the biannual U.S.- EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial to discuss U.S.-EU efforts related to border management, countering violent extremism, law enforcement cooperation, global supply chain security, aviation security and cybersecurity.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.dhs.gov.\n\n###"
