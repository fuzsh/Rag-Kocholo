        "text": "by Vello Pettai and Pille Ivask\n\nEstonia underwent a political makeover in 2016, involving both the election of a new president in October and, within the following six weeks, the appointment of a new government headed for the first time in nearly 25 years by the left-leaning Center Party (CP). Although the first event was not directly the cause of the second, the political jockeying that took place around the presidential election eventually engendered a shake-up in the previous government coalition. Not only did the Center Party rise to the prime minister’s office from the opposition, but also the long-governing Reform Party was, in turn, ousted from power and sent to the backbenches after more than 16 years in government. Estonia seemingly got its long-awaited ‘left turn’, with the Center Party now governing in a coalition with the Social Democrats (SDE). However, their third partner remained the national-conservative Pro Patria and Res Publica Union (PPRPU). This means that a careful balance will need to be struck on issues such as minority integration, taxes, and foreign policy.\n\nThe somewhat surprising turn of events started in August and September, when procedures began for electing a new president to succeed Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who was approaching the end of his 10 year term-limit in office. Signs that the election would not go smoothly, however, began to emerge in the summer, when five out of the six parties in parliament pledged to nominate their own candidate, thus threatening a deadlock when parliament moved to vote for a new president.\n\nPredictably, in late August parliament failed to form the necessary majority around any of the candidates, causing the process to move to a special electoral college. Although this contingency had happened before during presidential elections, the system had always worked, since one of the final candidates had been able to obtain an absolute majority among the participating delegates. This time, however, that outcome did not materialize, as several dozen delegates rejected both final contenders. The consequence was that the responsibility to vote was remitted to parliament, where hasty consultations among the political parties resulted in a consensus around Kersti Kaljulaid, a former Estonian representative to the EU Court of Auditors. Kaljulaid thereafter was quickly approved, and took office in early October.\n\nAs this debacle unfolded, two parallel processes took place. The first related to the position of Prime Minister Taavi Rõivas, who was accused during the presidential election of being indecisive in how he positioned his Reform Party amid the contest. On the one hand, the founder of the 20-year-old party, Siim Kallas, had announced in April that he would like to seek the presidency as a final milestone in his long political career. On the other hand, later in the summer a more popular candidate among the Estonian public, Foreign Minister Marina Kaljurand, appeared. Rõivas had a difficult time navigating between these two formidable personae. Although the party eventually threw its support behind Kallas, this bid failed in the electoral college, leaving bad blood among the individuals involved. Rõivas’s position as leader had been greatly tarnished.\n\nMeanwhile, Estonia’s other largest party, the Center Party, also went through upheaval as opponents of the group’s long-standing leader, Edgar Savisaar, finally succeeded in ousting him from power. Although Savisaar had survived a leadership challenge in November 2015, in the intervening months the situation for the party had deteriorated severely. Savisaar continued to be suspended from his position as mayor of Tallinn because of a wide-ranging corruption investigation by Estonia’s prosecutor general. Meanwhile, a number of financial irregularities within the party itself began to threaten the CP’s very survival. When a special congress was called in November 2016 to resolve these issues, Savisaar conceded defeat by not even standing for reappointment. Jüri Ratas took over as the Center Party’s leader, promising to put the party’s misdeeds behind it.\n\nBoth Taavi Rõivas’s weakening standing as prime minister and the rise of Jüri Ratas as an alternative within the Center Party opened the door to a switch in the governing coalition. Added impetus came from the leader of the Social Democrats, Jevgeni Ossinovski, who had long complained about the Reform Party being too domineering after governing for such a long period. He was more than happy to help engineer the coalition switch, which came almost immediately after Ratas had deposed Savisaar.\n\nThe new government therefore included, for the first time in Estonia’s re-independence history, two center-left parties, who see eye-to-eye on making Estonia’s tax system more progressive and expanding social spending for the country’s less well-off. In order to obtain a parliamentary majority, however, the parties had to include the PPRPU, who will resist many of these measures, as well as insist on a strong pro-Western foreign and defense policy. Through some rounding of these sharp corners, the parties agreed on a government program that may successfully take them to the next elections in 2019.\n\nIndeed, one of these compromises involved local government reform, a policy area where Taavi Rõivas’s government scored a major political achievement. In June, Rõivas succeeded in pushing through parliament an important framework law that would engender a radical reduction of Estonia’s 213 local governments down to around 100. Although the Center Party had been vocal in its critique of the reform while in opposition, it now agreed to take on responsibility for the reform’s implementation, including working out financial rewards for local governments that had agreed to merge into larger units."
