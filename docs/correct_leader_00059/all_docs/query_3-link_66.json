        "text": "Estonia's two biggest political parties clinched a deal Sunday to form a new government to be led by a female prime minister for the first time in the Baltic country's history, replacing the previous Cabinet that collapsed in a corruption scandal earlier this month.\n\nThe party councils of the opposition, center-right Reform Party and the ruling, left-leaning Center Party, voted in favor of joining a Cabinet headed by Reform's prime minister-designate and chairwoman, Kaja Kallas.\n\nBoth parties are set to have seven ministerial portfolios in addition to Kallas' prime minister post in the 15-member government, which would muster a majority in the 101-seat Riigikogu Parliament.\n\nA joint statement said the Reform Party and the Center Party \"will form a government that will continue to effectively resolve the COVID-19 crisis, keep Estonia forward-looking and develop all areas and regions of our country.\"\n\nEarlier this month, President Kersti Kaljulaid, who is expected to appoint Kallas' Cabinet in the next few days, said tackling Estonia's worsening coronavirus situation and the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic should be an immediate priority for the new government.\n\nKaljulaid tasked Kallas to form the government as her pro-business and pro-entrepreneurship Reform Party emerged as the winner of Estonia's March 2019 general election.\n\nPending approval from lawmakers, Kallas, 43, will become the first female head of government in the history of the small Baltic nation of 1.3 million, which regained its independence amid the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nA lawyer and former European Parliament lawmaker, Kallas is the daughter of Siim Kallas, one of the Reform Party's creators, a former prime minister and a former European Union commissioner.\n\nKaja Kallas took the reins at the Reform Party in 2018 as its first female chair. Her first Cabinet will see women in other key positions too as Reform's Keit Pentus-Rosimannus takes over the finance minister post and diplomat Eva-Maria Liimets becomes the foreign minister.\n\nThe government formation marks the second such attempt for Kallas in less than two years as she failed to bring about a Reform Party-led government after the 2019 election. That paved the way for the archrival Center Party and its leader, Juri Ratas, to form a three-party coalition without the Reform Party.\n\nRatas and his Cabinet resigned on Jan. 13 over a scandal involving a key official at his Center Party suspected of accepting a private donation for the party in exchange for a political favor on a real estate development at the harbor district of the capital, Tallinn.\n\nRatas' government, which took office in April 2019, was shaky from the start as the coalition included the populist EKRE, the nation's third-largest party, which runs on a nationalist, anti-immigration and anti-EU agenda.\n\nThe strong rhetoric of the EKRE leaders, Mart Helme and his son Martin Helme, created several embarrassing situations for Ratas' government with public statements that were seen as insulting to Estonia's international allies and tarnishing the country's image, and which brought the government to the brink of collapse at least twice.\n\nKallas rejected including EKRE members in her Cabinet, citing considerable differences in values. Reform Party defines itself on its website as \"the leader of the liberal worldview in Estonia.\"\n\nKallas acknowledged earlier to Estonian media that her Cabinet would embark on a diplomatic mission to regain trust among the country's allies and assure them of Estonia's new political course."
