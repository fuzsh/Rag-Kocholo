Louise Mountbatten with her fianc√©, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden.

Louise was a first cousin of OTMAA, younger daughter of Alexandra Feodorovna's eldest sister Victoria. Born in 1889, she was somewhat older than her Russian cousins, but was on affectionate terms with them, visiting Russia on occasion with her mother and keeping up a correspondence with them.

Still unmarried in her early 30s after a few failed engagements, everyone was surprised when Louise, who had vowed never to marry a king or a widower, became engaged to the widowed Crown Prince of Sweden. They married in 1923, and he became king in 1950.
