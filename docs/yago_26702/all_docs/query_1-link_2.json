Edwina Ashley was wearing something that looks very similar at her wedding to lord Louis Mountbatten a year before, you can find photos of the wedding here: Royal Musings: July 2012 if you scroll down to July 18, 1922. I have to say that I prefer lady Louise's wedding dress of the three royal/noble brides' of 1922-1923, the third was of course lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, The Windsor Diary – Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Marries Albert, Duke of York « , although the fashion of the early 20ies didn't do any favours really when it came to stylish wedding dresses.\n\nWell, I found an description of lady Louise's dress on a Swedish site, it was not white, but made of a silver-shimmering sari cloth given to her by her uncle and sewn in Paris, and it had a lover's knot at the hip with orange flowers: http://tinyurl.com/cdexhe7 A pity that there are no colour photo's of the dress."
