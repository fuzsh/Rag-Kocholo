        "text": "Admiral of the Fleet Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas Mountbatten, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, generally known as Lord Mountbatten or \"Dickie\", is the maternal uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is played by Greg Wise in Seasons 1 and 2, and by Charles Dance in Seasons 3 and 4 of The Crown.\n\nLife[]\n\nBefore The Crown[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nLouis Mountbatten was born Prince Louis of Battenberg on June 25, 1900. His father, also named Prince Louis of Battenberg, was a German Prince who had emigrated to Britain and served in the Royal Navy. His sister was Princess Alice of Battenberg, making him an uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. His other sister was Princess Louise of Battenberg, who would later become Queen of Sweden through her marriage to King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. During the First World War, in an effort to downplay their German heritage, the Battenbergs changed their name to the House of Mountbatten. Louis followed in his father’s footsteps and pursued a naval career, joining the Royal Navy in 1916.\n\nSecond World War[]\n\nDuring the Second World War, after being involved in the planning of several Allied raids along the Atlantic Wall, Mountbatten was appointed Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia, and was tasked with leading Allied forces against the Japanese during the Burma Campaign. The campaign was a success and resulted in the liberation of Burma and the creation of the victory title “Earl Mountbatten of Burma”, which Mountbatten and his successors continued to use. Mountbatten was present at the signing of the Japanese surrender in 1945.\n\nIndia[]\n\nAfter the war, Mountbatten served as the final Viceroy of India, and was tasked with overseeing Indian independence. During this time, according to him, his wife Edwina began a relationship with Jawaharlal Nehru “right under [his] nose”. Nehru would eventually serve as India’s first prime minister. During his time as Viceroy, he had initially hoped for all of India to become one independent nation, but the insistence of the Muslim League on creating a separate nation for the Muslims of the Indian Subcontinent (as well as Mountbatten’s own insistence on granting independence to India as soon as possible) resulted in the Partition of India, which created the two independent nations of India and Pakistan. He served as India’s first Governor-General for another year, as the representative of King George VI, who was still king of India although it was independent. His role in Indian independence resulted in Winston Churchill and Edward, Duke of Windsor later mockingly referring to him as “the man who gave away India”.\n\nIn The Crown[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nLord Mountbatten first appears in Wolferton Splash congratulating his nephew after he's been knighted. He is later seen at the wedding standing next to Philip before sitting with his wife. Winston Churchill comments how he's the man who gave away India. Mountbatten is next seen getting his picture taken with his nephew, sister, and new niece after the wedding.\n\nIn the episode “Windsor”, following the death of King George VI, Mountbatten briefly causes a controversy within the royal family, by bragging that, because his nephew, Prince Philip is now married to Queen Elizabeth II, the house of Mountbatten will become the ruling house of the United Kingdom. This angers Queen Mary, who is told of it by Prince Ernst of Hanover. In the end, the new Queen decides, on the advice of Churchill, to keep the name Windsor.\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nIn the latter half of Season 2, Mountbatten begins his mentorship of Prince Charles. In Paterfamilias, he supports the Queen in her decision to send Charles to Eton College. Philip, however insists that he be sent to Gordonstoun in Scotland. During Charles’ time at Gordonstoun, he is increasingly demoralised and Mountbatten occasionally visits to encourage him. He also tells Charles to let him know if he wants to leave Gordonstoun.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nMountbatten’s first appearance in Season 3 is in Coup. As Harold Wilson’s government struggles to keep the economy afloat, his ministers suggest removing Mountbatten from his office as Chief of the Defence Staff, to make room for defence cuts. Wilson personally speaks to Mountbatten and forces him into retirement. After this, Mountbatten meets with Cecil King and other individuals dissatisfied with Wilson’s government and King proposes that the group stage a coup d’etat to oust Wilson’s government and replace him with Mountbatten. After initially refusing, Mountbatten decides to consider it and at their next meeting, he determines that a coup in the UK would be impossible without the support of the Queen. The Queen, who has already been informed by the Prime Minister of the plot, summons Mountbatten and scolds him for his actions. Later, Mountbatten meets with his sister, Alice, and she tells him to stop interfering in government affairs, claiming that such things are no longer his problem.\n\nIn Dangling Man, Charles speaks to Mountbatten about possibly starting a relationship with Camilla Shand. Mountbatten initially encourages the relationship, hoping it won’t develop into something long-term, but as Charles begins to fall in love with her, Mountbatten gives him a posting overseas in an effort to keep his mind off her. At the same time, Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother meets the families of both Camilla and her boyfriend Andrew Parker-Bowles to settle the situation. When the Queen learns of this she meets with both of them to stop them from interfering in Charles’ personal life, but upon learning that Camilla was already seeing someone else when she started seeing Charles, she allows them to carry out their plan.\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nIn Gold Stick, Mountbatten argues with Charles over his continued infatuation with Camilla, as she is now married to Andrew Parker-Bowles. While on holiday in County Sligo, Ireland, Mountbatten writes a letter to Charles, stating that he needs to not only marry a woman who he loves, but also one who would make a good queen, which he does not believe Camilla would. After sending the letter, Mountbatten leaves to go fishing with his grandchildren and, unbeknownst to him, the IRA has planted a bomb on the fishing boat. It detonates and Mountbatten is killed. The Queen and Prince Charles are immediately informed and Charles only receives the letter after hearing of Mountbatten’s death. A state funeral is held for Mountbatten at Westminster Abbey on September 5, 1979.\n\nHonours[]\n\nDuring the series Lord Mountbatten is seen wearing numerous decorations, the most notable being:\n\nKG - Knight of the Order of the Garter (1946)\n\nGCB - Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (1955)\n\nOM - Member of the Order of Merit (1965)\n\nGCSI - Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (1947\n\nGCIE - Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (1947)\n\nGCVO - Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (1937)\n\nDSO - Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (1941)\n\nPhotos[]\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nSeason 1 Appearances Wolferton Splash Hyde Park Corner Windsor Act of God Smoke and Mirrors Gelignite Scientia Potentia Est Pride & Joy Assassins Gloriana\n\nSeason 2 Appearances Misadventure A Company of Men Lisbon Beryl Marionettes Vergangenheit Matrimonium Dear Mrs. Kennedy Paterfamilias Mystery Man\n\nSeason 3 Appearances Olding Margaretology Aberfan Bubbikins Coup Tywysog Cymru Moondust Dangling Man Imbroglio Cri de Coeur"
