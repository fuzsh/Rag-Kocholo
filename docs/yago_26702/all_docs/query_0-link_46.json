        "text": "\"In 1950, Louise’s husband became King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden upon the death of his father, and she became queen. She disliked the attention she received just because she was a queen and said, “People look at me as if I were something fancy. I do not look different today than I did yesterday!” Despite this, Louise diligently carried out her duties, even when she was ill.\"\n\nCreated by: , Jonathan101862"
