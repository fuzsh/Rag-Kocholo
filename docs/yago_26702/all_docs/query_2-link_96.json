        "text": "STOCKHOLM, Sept. 15 — King Gustaf VI Adolf of Swe den died at 8:35 P.M. (3:35, New York time) today in the hospital in Halsingborg. He was 90 years old and had reigned for nearly 23 years.\n\nThe King had been taken to the hospital 20 days ago for an emergency operation. Since then, doctors had fought for his life with surgery and blood transfusions.\n\nCrown Prince Carl Gustaf, the 27‐year‐old heir to the throne, and other relatives were at the hospital at the end. The Crown Prince immediately became King Carl XVI Gustaf. A formal investiture is to be held within three days. No coronation is held in Sweden.\n\nThe King died of complica tions following treatment for what was described as a rare disease.\n\nDuring surgery, doctors sought to stop passive in testinal bleeding. The doctors discovered that the bleeding was due to inflammation and superficial ulcers of the duo denum, the first portion of the small intestines.\n\nDr. Gunnar Biorck, the King's chief physician, said that the disease causing the bleeding was the first known case of the disorder in Sweden. Eight cases of the illness, called erosive mucosa] duodenitis, have been reported in the United States.\n\nThe funeral is expected to be held within 7 to 10 days.\n\nUnpretentious Monarch\n\nBy PAUL L. MONTGOMERY\n\nGustaf VI Adolf became King of Sweden at an age when most men are already in retire ment. During his prosperous reign, the lean, scholarly ruler established a reputation as one of the most beloved and un pretentious of Europe's mon archs.\n\nHe became King on Oct. 30, 1950, the day after his father, Gustaf V, died at the age of 92, and 12 days before his own 68th birthday. Longevity is a mark of the family. The found er of the dynasty lived to 81 years of age.\n\nFollowing the unofficial Scandinavian slogan that kings reign but the people rule, Gus taf took the throne of the con stitutional monarchy in a sim ple state ceremony in the royal palace. He had rejected a coro nation as a waste of money, a view also taken by his father. Through his reign, state occa sions were without pomp. He never wore a crown, or held a scepter.\n\nKing Gustaf was the most democratic of princes. He had a walk‐on part in the children's movie “The Wonderful Adven tures of Nils” and gave the first audience for the press in the history of Sweden's royal family. On his public birthdays, citizens would send him gin gersnaps and homemade socks.\n\nGustaf inherited the royal family's artistic andintellec tual gifts. He was a noted sportsman in his youth, an ac complished archeologist and skilled botanist, a connoisseur of Chinese art, a carpenter and a linguist.\n\nHe's All Right\n\nThe King's curiosity about things was legendary. “Just answer anything he asks you and he'll he perfectly happy,” his wife, the late Queen Louise, once told one of his hosts.But he won't be content until he knows all there is to know.”\n\nWhen he visited the United States in 1926, he met Gov. Al fred E. Smith of New York, who said of him: “Why; that fellow—he could be elected president of Sweden if it was a republic. He's all right.” In fact, through his reign, public opinion polls showed him to be the most popular and respected man in the country.\n\nKitt Gustaf was born in the royal palace at Stockholm on Nov. 11, 1882, son of Gustaf V and Queen Victoria, a princess of the Grand Duchy of Baden, in Germany.\n\nHe was a great‐great‐grand son of Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, one of Napoleon's generals, who was chosen crown prince of Sweden in 1810 and ruled as Charles XIV Johan from 1818 to 1844.\n\nThe future monarch was christened Oscar Fredrik Wil helm Olaf Gustaf Adolf and given the title Duke of Scania, but the solid terseness of Gustaf Adolf suited him better. As a young prince he began a rigorous training in the palace schoolroom. In military service he slept on the ground and marched with the others.\n\nAt the University of Uppsala he studied history, economics, government, statistics and law, and acquired his life‐long love of archeology.\n\nHe was a 6‐footer, erect and athletic. Like his father, he was a tennis player, but preferred skiing. He was also an expert marksman and able horseman; winning the gold insignia of the Swedish Athletic Associa tion in open competition. In later life, he became a golfer.\n\nConcurrent with his academic training, Gustaf rose through the military. He was made first lieutenant in 1903, a colonel in 1918 and a full gen eral in both the infantry and cavalry in 1932. As King he was commander in chief of the defense forces.\n\nIn 1904, while wintering in Egypt, the young crown prince met Princess Margaret of Con naught, granddaughter of Queen Victoria of England. Their engagement was an nounced in February, 1905, and they were married in June at Windsor Castle. It was the first time a member of Swedish royalty had wed a member of the British royal family in 500 years.\n\nFour sons and a daughter were born to the royal couple before the Queen died of blood poisoning in 1920. Three years later the King married Lady Louise Alexandra Marie Irene Mountbatten, a sister of Earl Mountbatten of Burma and a great‐granddaughter of Queen Victoria. They had no children. Gustaf's second wife died in 1966.\n\nHis oldest son, Prince Gustaf Adolf, died in an airplane crash in 1947. Two other sons, Sig ward and Carl Johan, forfeited their rights to the throne by marryin'g commoners. His daughter, Ingrid, married the King of Denmark.\n\nWhen his oldest son was killed, Gustaf took over the education of his grandson, the current crown prince, Carl Gustaf, who was nine months old at his father's death.\n\nTraveled Widely\n\nGustaf's transition from crown prince to king was nat ural and comparatively easy because for some 60 years he devoted himself to the prep aration. During his appren ticeship he assumed the re gency several times while his father was absent from the country.\n\nHe coupled practical knowl edge of a sovereign's duties with intensive training in civil administration and military work. He traveled widely through Sweden, meeting thou Oands of citizens face to face. He afso traveled extensively overseas.\n\nHe visited the United States twice, in 1926 and again in 1938 for the tercentenary of the arrival of Swedish settlers in America. He held honorary degrees from Princeton, Yale, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, Clark University, Lafayette College and the Uni versity of Chicago. Many European universities, including Oxford, also awarded him hon orary degrees.\n\nWhen he became King, Gus taf chose as his motto “Duty Above All.” Though his powers were limited under the con stitution, he became a respected counselor to successive govern ments. He frequently used state occasions to advance progres sive ideas in both domestic and world affairs. In 1972, in a speech from the throne, he called on the United States to stop its “merciless” bombing of North Vietnam, echoing the views of the Swedish Govern ment.\n\nHe kept ceremony to a mini mum, but he was a familiar figure at events in Sweden. One of the best‐known of these was the annual presentation of the Nobel Prizes. He missed only one of the ceremonies—in 1972, when he had a cold.\n\nHe enjoyed watching sports, from the 1956 Olympics in Stockholm to local tennis matches. In 1959, when Inge mar Johanssen of Sweden won the heavyweight boxing title from Floyd Patterson in New York, the King was the first to send congratulations.\n\nThe King's leisure pursuits were as extensive as his public duties, and his breadth of knowledge was wide."
