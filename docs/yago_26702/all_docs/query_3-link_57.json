        "text": "Battenberg family, a family that rose to international prominence in the 19th and 20th centuries, the name being a revival of a medieval title.\n\nThe first Battenbergs were a family of German counts that died out about 1314 and whose seat was the castle of Kellerburg, near Battenberg, in Hesse. The title was revived in 1851, when Alexander (1823–88), a younger son of Louis II, grand duke of Hesse, contracted a morganatic marriage with the Polish countess Julia Theresa von Hauke (1825–95), who was then created countess of Battenberg. In 1858 the countess and her children were all raised to the rank of prince or princess (Prinz or Prinzessin) of Battenberg.\n\nIn 1917 the eldest son of this union, Louis Alexander (1854–1921), who had become an admiral in the British navy, was created marquess of Milford Haven (see Milford Haven, Louis Alexander, 1st marquess of), and, at the request of King George V, the members of the family who lived in England renounced, in 1917, the German title of prince of Battenberg and adopted the English form of Mountbatten as a surname."
