        "text": "Gustaf V (Oscar Gustaf Adolf; June 16, 1858 – October 29, 1950) was King of Sweden from 1907 until his death in 1950. He was the eldest son of King Oscar II of Sweden and Sophia of Nassau, the youngest daughter of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau, by his second wife Princess Pauline Friederica Marie of Württemberg. Duke Wilhelm of Nassau was also the father of Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg by his first wife, Princess Louise of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\n\nKing Gustaf V of Sweden\n\nReigning from the death of his father Oscar II on December 8, 1907, until his own death 43 years later, Gustaf V holds the record of being the oldest monarch of Sweden and the third-longest reigning after Magnus IV-VII of Sweden and Norway (1319-1364) and the present Swedish King, Carl XVI Gustaf. He was also the last Swedish monarch to exercise his royal prerogatives, which largely died with him, although formally abolished only with the remaking of the Swedish constitution in 1974. He was the first Swedish king since the High Middle Ages not to have a coronation and hence never wore a crown, a tradition continuing to date.\n\nGustaf’s early reign saw the rise of parliamentary rule in Sweden, although the leadup to World War I pre-empted his overthrow of Liberal Prime Minister Karl Staaff in 1914, replacing him with his own figurehead Hjalmar Hammarskjöld (father of Dag Hammarskjöld) for most of the war. However, after the Liberals and Social Democrats secured a parliamentary majority under Staaff’s successor, Nils Edén, he allowed Edén to form a new government which de facto stripped the monarchy of all virtual powers and enacted universal and equal suffrage, including for women, by 1919.\n\nMeeting of the three kings in Malmö, December 18, 1914: Haakon VII of Norway, Gustaf V of Sweden, and Christian X of Denmark.\n\nBowing fully to the principles of parliamentary democracy, he remained a popular figurehead for the remaining 31 years of his rule, although not completely without influence – during World War II he allegedly urged Per Albin Hansson’s coalition government to accept requests from Nazi Germany for logistics support, refusing which might have provoked an invasion. This remains controversial to date, although he is not known to have shown much support for fascism or radical nationalism; his pro-German and anti-Communist stance was well known also in World War I.\n\nOn September 20, 1881 he married Princess Victoria of Baden in Karlsruhe, Germany. Victoria of Baden was the daughter of Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden, and Princess Louise of Prussia, the second child and only daughter of German Emperor Wilhelm I and Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Victoria was named after her aunt, Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia, the eldest child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nGustaf and Victoria\n\nGerman Emperor Wilhelm I and Empress Augusta were present at the wedding, and marriage was arranged as a sign that Sweden belonged to the German sphere in Europe. The marriage was popular in Sweden where she was called “The Vasa Princess”, because of her descent from the old Vasa Dynasty\n\nVictoria of Baden was the granddaughter of Princess Sophie of Sweden, Grand Duchess of Baden, the daughter of the deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden and his wife, Frederica of Baden. Victoria’s marriage to Gustaf V united the reigning Bernadotte dynasty with the former royal house of Holstein-Gottorp, which claimed descent from the House of Vasa which brought Sweden its independence and thus was popular throughout Sweden.\n\nThe kings of the House of Holstein-Gottorp, which produced the kings of Sweden from 1751 to 1818, often emphasized their Vasa descent, albeit through a female line. The current ruling house of Bernadotte similarly prides in its Vasa descent: Carl XIV, the first Bernadotte king, was an adopted son of Carl XIII, the last from the House of Holstein-Gottorp; his son Oscar I married a Vasa descendant Josephine of Leuchtenberg; and the focus of this blog post, his grandson Gustaf V, married Victoria of Baden who was, as we’ve seen, a great-grandchild of Gustav IV Adolf of the house Holstein-Gottorp.\n\nGustaf and Victoria were brought together by their families and their marriage was reported not to have been a happy one. Their marriage produced three children:\n\n1. King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden (1882-1973) (aged 90) married 1) Princess Margaret of Connaught (1882–1920), had issue (four sons, one daughter), married 2) Louise Mountbatten (1889–1965), a stillborn daughter.\n\n2. Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland (1884-1965)(aged 80) married Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890–1958), had issue.\n\n3. Prince Erik, Duke of Västmanland (1889-1918) (aged 29) died unmarried of the Spanish flu, no issue\n\nVictoria, Crown Princess of Sweden with her mother, Grand Duchess Louise of Baden (only daughter of Wilhelm I, German Emperor) and her eldest son, baby Gustaf Adolf, 1883.\n\nIn 1890–1891, Victoria and Gustaf travelled to Egypt to repair their relationship, but it did not succeed, allegedly due to Victoria’s interest in one of the courtiers, and she repeated the trip to Egypt in 1891–1892. After 1889, the personal relationship between Victoria and Gustaf is considered to have been finished, in part, as estimated by Lars Elgklou, due to the bisexuality of Gustaf V.\n\nVictoria of Baden, Queen Consort of Sweden\n\nAn avid hunter and sportsman, Gustaf V presided over the 1912 Olympic Games and chaired the Swedish Association of Sports from 1897 to 1907. Most notably, he represented Sweden (under the alias of Mr G.) as a competitive tennis player, keeping up competitive tennis until his 80s, when his eyesight deteriorated rapidly. He died from flu complications and was succeeded by his son as King Gustaf VI Adolf.\n\nFollowing his death at age 92, in 1950, Gustaf V was implicated in a homosexual affair in the Haijby affair. His alleged lover Kurt Haijby was imprisoned in 1952 for blackmail of the court in the 1930s. Homosexuality was a criminal offense in Sweden until 1944, though Gustaf’s position would have granted automatic immunity."
