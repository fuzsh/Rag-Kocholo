        "text": "He would have helped himself quite a bit if he had won enough at UCLA to make his own job security a bit more of a sure thing. Right now there doesn't seem to be much difference in Alford over Crean, so why pay the contract buyouts?\n\nAlthough I suppose if Alford wins two more games, he's a hot name again.\n\nI think that the buyout and the fact a lot of talent is coming back give Crean another year.\n\nAs an alum I also think that IU has delusions about their program. The kids they are currently recruiting were born in 1997-1998. IU has gone to one Final Four in the last 22 years and two more times to the round of 16. I don't think the typical recruit has any interest in the glory days of Bobby Knight.\n\nI also think if I was a four or five star recruit who had played a lot of AAU traveling ball that Bloomington would be my first choice as a place to play. It is also one of three schools in state playing in an elite conference. I think IU suffers from the same delusion as Nebraska. It is not a top tier location anymore."
