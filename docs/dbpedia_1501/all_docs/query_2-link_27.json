        "text": "Who is Bob Godshall?!\n\nBorn in Texas, raised in Philadelphia, I moved to New Mexico in 1976 and, except for the 3 years I spent with the U.S. Border Patrol in Sierra Blanca, Tx., this state has been my home ever since.\n\nI'm retired from the Department of Homeland Security after a 28 year career with Federal Law Enforcement. That career began after I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree program in Political Science at the University of New Mexico in 1980. In the course of my time at UNM, I postponed my studies temporarily in order to put together a financial foundation from which to continue. I know from that experience what it's like to be poor.\n\nI became politically active in Albuquerque in 2012 volunteering for a number of Republican candidates ranging from Janice Arnold-Jones, Larry Larranaga, and Wayne Johnson to Brook Bassan, among others. During this time, I have knocked on thousands of doors and spoken to countless people, many of whom are in District 27.\n\nI have spoken to many of you about your frustrations and your hopes for this state and this country and, believe me, I can relate."
