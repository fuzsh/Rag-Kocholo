He, along with Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, is one of two DI men's coaches — so far — to win more than 1,000 games.\n\nOnly one active coach at the Division I level has picked up 800 wins in his DI career:\n\nCoastal Carolina's Cliff Ellis is 819-541 after wrapping up his 44th season coaching at the DI level.\n\nHere is the full list of the Division I men's basketball coaches with 500 or more wins at the end of the 2021-22 season.\n\n(All stats are current through the end of the 2022-23 season and taken from the NCAA’s official records, which can be found here)"
