        "text": "Is it time to hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete on the entire sport and reboot with renewed emphasis on authentic student-athletes? Beneath its vibrant veneer, college basketball has a description-defying rap sheet cast including a colossal collection of contemptible characters. Like it or not, it's an unfortunate fact of life that many reality show-addicted onlookers find it alluring to explore the private lives and personal misfortunes of standout players who think they are hoop heartthrobs.\n\nNever underestimate the astonishing absence of integrity among the powers-that-be charlatans tarnishing many major universities. Amid the showmanship and scam artistry, PT Barnum continues to chortle, \"I was right all along!\" about \"there's a sucker born every minute.\"\n\nEntering dangerous terrain when comparing unprincipled athletes to the public-at-large segment of our population, there is a seemingly congested intersection populating hot hoop prospects who become prime suspects. Rarely exposed to the rigid word \"no,\" some of the hero worshiped think the world revolves around them and develop a sordid sense of \"out-of-bounds\" entitlement. Many of the misguided go from the brink of the NBA to the clink put away, donning a jumpsuit rather than a uniform.\n\n\"When you are among the high-flying adored, your view of the world becomes blurred,\" wrote psychologist Stanley Teitelbaum of the flouting-of-the-law behavior in the book \"Sports Heroes, Fallen Idols: How Star Athletes Pursue Self-Destructive Paths and Jeopardize Their Careers.\"\n\n\"Off the field, some act as if they are above the rules of society; hubris and an attitude of entitlement become central to the psyche of many athletes. They may deny that they are vulnerable to reprisals and feel omnipotent and grandiose as well as entitled.\"\n\nFar too many depraved derelicts can't resist and make the toxic transition from game-breakers to lawbreakers when seduced by the dark side. There have been a striking number of heart-breaking stories rocking the world of sports, derailing dreams and creating miscreants who are poster boys for bad behavior.\n\nIdaho professor Sharon Stoll was not surprised when sports pages occasionally read like a police blotter focusing on 15 minutes of shame or 15 seconds when it comes to Slick Rick's prowess.\n\n\"In sport, we have moved away from honorable behavior,\" said Stoll, who operated the Center for Ethical Theory and Honor in Competitive Sports and conducted a 17-year study during which 72,000 athletes filled out questionnaires. \"The environment of athletics has not been supportive of teaching and modeling moral knowing, moral valuing and moral action. Many of these young people have no sense of what is acceptable behavior.\"\n\nAn \"I'm-a-stud\" mindset goes way out of bounds when an alarming number of former college hoopers think they're still BMOC when hired by a high school district and victimize underage females.\n\nIt's unnerving when active or former narcissistic players go from the big time to the big house. Infinitely more disconcerting is when deaths are involved amid the life and crimes. Nowhere did the plot sicken more than during the trashy summer of 2003 at Baylor. Carlton Dotson, a J.C. recruit, was sentenced to 35 years in prison after pleading guilty to murdering Bears roommate/teammate Patrick Dennehy with a hand gun. Dennehy, shot twice above the right ear, was New Mexico's leading rebounder (7.5 rpg) in 2001-02 under coach Fran Fraschilla before he was dismissed from the squad when Ritchie McKay succeeded Fraschilla. Dotson was arrested upon telling FBI agents he shot Dennehy after the player tried to shoot him.\n\nCoach Dave Bliss was fired by Baylor, the world's largest Baptist school, before reports surfaced about his direct involvement in a Hall of Shame coverup attempting to hide drug use and NCAA violations within his program by repulsively encouraging an assistant coach and Bears players to depict the slain Dennehy as a drug dealer.\n\n\"I liken Bliss to a child molester,\" said Brian Brabazon, Dennehy's stepfather, to USA Today. \"He may not physically molest kids, but he molests their minds. What a callous, cold-hearted person he is.\n\n\"I'm not sure where Carlton's mind was when the shooting started, but as far as I'm concerned, Bliss was in that field (where the body was discovered).\"\n\nAmid the occasional repulsive garbage, college basketball is too great a game to be ruined by moral malfeasance. The accompanying \"Thugs R Us\" profiles aren't designed to defile hoopdom. Actually, if college basketball can survive such unsavory incidents and classless ambassadors, it must be a helluva sport.\n\nBut what went awry for slam dunkers who wound up in the slammer? The common thread seems to be how the delusional perpetrators think they're slick enough to talk or force their way into anything; then desperate enough to be shamed by virtually nothing. Equally shameful are the self-indulgent coaches willing to pursue dim-witted recruits boasting questionable pasts without conducting any sort of background check or simply ignoring known criminal activity by their soon-to-be mercenaries. The partnering by coaches in the deceit and dishonesty is an incalculable affront to their counterparts who attempt to abide by the rules.\n\nIf anyone seemed to be operating above the fray, it was The Doctor. But it turned out that Julius Erving was immersed in financial woes, auctioning memorabilia in the fall of 2011 to cover debts. Erving had admitted he was the father of Alexandra Stevenson amid her run to the 1999 Wimbledon semifinals. It wasn't as if Dr. J needed more favorable publicity as a role model providing positive inspiration! Stevenson's mother is a free-lance journalist who worked as a sports writer in Philadelphia when he displayed his high-wire act there for the 76ers.\n\nThe NBA Players' Association reportedly reminds its rookies every year that 60% of NBA players such as Joe Smith (first overall pick out of Maryland in 1995 earned $61 million over 16-season career) go broke five years after their final basketball-related paycheck. Ill-equipped to handle millions of dollars, drug-related problems seem to escalate for college kids with sufficient skill to play professionally. According to time.com, sources estimated that 2/3 of the NBA's out-of-control players smoked weed in the late 1990s, becoming a drag on society with each drag to get high. The straight dope is that most of the college culprits corrupting an otherwise grand game seem to \"go to pot\" first. Too bad these \"Dope Diamonds\" didn't boast the character to invest that \"wasted\" time taking \"trips\" to the free-throw line to work on improving their \"foul\" shooting from the charity stripe.\n\nMeanwhile, promiscuous individuals who must have majored in some misguided \"Big Bang Theory\" expect female groupies to be nothing more than charitable harems. There was anecdotal evidence about the number of out-of-wedlock babies stemming from NBA dead-beat dads dispensing DNA was higher than the annual total of win-one-for-the-stripper players in the league.\n\nNever underestimate the extent of entitlement. For instance, needy Kobe Bryant's resort commingling before knee surgery in Vail, Colo., made him a perverted piker compared to Earvin Johnson admitting his Magical Mystery Tour sexual frivolity included sleeping with 300 to 500 people per year (entertainment venue featured the Lakers' locker room and sauna). How many team employee enablers, perhaps singing \"Do You Believe in Magic?\" while in the process of doing their dirty deeds, facilitated such indulging nonsense? Of course, this great feat of Magic paled in comparison to Wilt Chamberlain's community partnership claim to bedding 20,000 women before and after leaving Philly to drive around the plains of Kansas in a souped-up red and white Oldsmobile convertible.\n\nStatistics show athletes, provided go-to attorneys along with go-to professors to remain eligible, are convicted at a much lower rate than the national average. According to a USA Today study during a Kobe trial, prominent athletes are much less likely to be convicted of sexual assault than the average citizen. Consider this start statistical comparison: 2/3 of the general population is convicted when charged with sexual assault while 2/3 of prominent athletes are exonerated in sexual assaults.\n\nA byproduct of \"players\" aspiring to set statistical records on and off the court, Michael Jordan's philandering contributed to the most costly divorce ever (estimated $168 million in settlement ending 17-year marriage to wife Juanita) prior to golf legend Tiger Woods' breakup. The absence of a pre-nuptial reportedly cost Bryant $75 million, including three houses in the Newport Beach area, as part of his divorce settlement. Elsewhere, James Worthy, Jordan's college teammate and Magic's Lakers teammate, was arrested and charged with solicitation for prostitution. Said Worthy's ex-wife Angela, a former North Carolina cheerleader: \"That feeling of entitlement, that whatever I want, I can have, and that feeling of invincibility. It's a lethal cocktail.\"\n\nAny accountability goes out the door when a commentator such as ESPN's Screamin' A. Stiff includes Bryant among the players he is thankful for at Thanksgiving because of his professionalism and way he conducts himself. Actually, booby bars and escort services all across the country go into a major depression when there is an NBA lockout or a \"Superman\" such as Shaq retires; particularly since he says with a straight face that he was a \"respectful cheater.\" This seemingly endless tawdry conduct also included chaotic card games on plane flights cannibalizing several squads, adding fuel to the filthy flamboyance.\n\n\"Let's face it,\" longtime NBA forward Eddie Johnson told SI about the league's sexually overactive appetite. \"Athletes are whores. We're paid to use our bodies. So sex becomes the same thing after the games. We become like dogs sometimes, and we all talk about the same women in every city.\" Consequently, it shouldn't be a surprise when a Left Coast culture created by Wilt, Magic, Worthy, Shaq and Kobe fosters a video secretly recorded by Los Angeles Lakers rookie D'Angelo Russell leaked on the Internet went viral about a teammate discussing his involvement with a teenage girl who isn't his rapper fiancee.\n\nWhat ignites the malignant bile to where Cincinnati product Jason Maxiell acknowledged on the Oprah Winfrey Network that he slept with 341 side chicks (apparently one for each DI school) before and during his marriage to reality-star wife (Basketball Wives LA)? Grossly under-reported is the prevalent use of sex as a racy college recruiting tool. The arousal culture commences innocently enough with exceptional scantily-clad hostesses displaying their wares to exceptions - scholastically suspect \"studs\" who don't meet a school's usual admission standards but gain entry because of a special talent compromising academic values. In other words, a classless institution of lower learning is more attracted to someone adept at throwing a no-look pass than exhibiting a citadel of higher learning focusing more on looking at an authentic student infinitely more capable of passing a genuine college class. Whatever happened to \"No Pass/No Play?\" as coaches across the country make a mockery of standardized testing. Breeding scholastic fraud, sham majors are widespread in order to meet academic progress for tournament eligibility and contract bonus provisions.\n\nAt some point, these \"special\" individuals are totally responsible for their actions (including sexual activity); especially when they begin attending a university. Out-of-control coaches toying with testosterone transgressions, resembling sleaze-ball agents wooing potential clients, should be fired on the spot if it is discovered they allowed, even if tacitly, their veteran players to \"escort\" impressionable and susceptible teenage \"rock stars\" to anything connected with jiggle joints/sex parties/lusty liaisons during morally-reprehensible recruiting visits. In a 2015 sexcapade, a former recruit said he felt as if \"I was in a strip club\" when visiting Louisville. Since coaches are so fond of portraying a fatherly-figure image, it seems anyone harmed by a thug they brought to campus should be able to sue the indifferent mentors as if they were a real parent. But many dense despots won't come to grips with their elemental enabling until a coach's own delicate daughter is dragged into the deviant dragnet.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a prude, it should be declared institutional neglect if a tone-deaf school doesn't issue to parents of a prospective signee an itinerary detailing precisely what their son did under the school's supervision while on and off campus during a recruiting visit. Far too many pimp-like coaches seem to take an unprincipled hear-no-evil/see-no-evil stance by simply looking the other way while devilish boys-gone-wild recruits sample the latest favors and flavors they could enjoy by signing on the dotted line. An example of this self-absorbed attitude was former Syracuse guard Scoop Jardine tweeting that \"#collegetaughtme that groupies really exist! But we just call them #teamplayers! Ahaha.\"\n\nIn many instances, the incessant preaching about abiding by regulations is complete propaganda BS from the outset via schools becoming little more than incubators for abhorrent activity, including creating a dangerous \"War on Women.\" How many self-centered unethical coaches - male and female - helped arrange abortions over the years so they could maintain control over their players' bodies amid their inability to control themselves? How low has the bar been set when nearly every marquee coach associated with scumbag such as player pimp/drug dealer Curtis Malone in Washington, D.C.? Lifting up the sewer manhole covering basketball's boulevard, the scandalous stench can render you senseless. The corrosive \"Cradles of Criminals\" seems to focus on Chicago, Cincinnati, Las Vegas, Memphis, New York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore/Washington.\n\nThe simplistic notion that staying in college longer to allegedly become more mature isn't any sort of remedy. In fact, a study at the Mississippi College School of Law infers that the less time a player spends in college, the less likely he was to get arrested. Female hoopers seemed to be trying to keep up with the \"bad boys.\" Tennessee legend Chamique Holdsclaw faced criminal charges in Atlanta for allegedly firing a gun at her ex-girlfriend's auto in 2012 and Baylor All-American Brittney Griner had a highly-publicized domestic violence incident with her partner.\n\nCoaches often try to convince the masses they focus on instructing their players about making choices, but we never thought that meant them deciding whom to contact from jail with their one phone call. There may be sadder tales of athletic falls from grace, although not many with about 100 \"Fall-Americans\" included among the disarray. Disinfectant might be needed while wading through the cesspool, but the following alphabetical list of unfiltered summaries are American tragedies exploring self-absorbed punks who went from playing on one court to pleading in another:\n\nAbdul Abdullah, Providence (coached by Rick Barnes) - Big East Conference's leader in assists in 1993-94 was arrested in summer of 2017 during a traffic stop in Rhode Island as a fugitive from justice and held for extradition to Georgia as a probation violator on a statutory rape conviction (step niece just turned 14 at the time) dating back to a New Year's Day 1999 offense. Rhode Island police subsequently issued an arrest warrant because he did not register as a sex offender.\n\nAlex Abreu, Akron (Keith Dambrot)/West Georgia (Michael Cooney) - The Zips' leader in assists late in 2012-13 campaign when he was suspended following an arrest ending up in him pleading guilty to one count of felony drug trafficking (handling more than $15,000 in cash and $25,000 in weed). Puerto Rico native was able to transfer after receiving probation instead of jail time.\n\nRichie Adams, UNLV (Jerry Tarkanian) - A 1989 conviction for larceny and armed robbery led to a five-year prison term for the two-time Big West Conference Tournament MVP. Following his parole, Adams was convicted of manslaughter in September 1998 after being accused of stalking and killing a 14-year-old Bronx girl in a housing project where both lived. The girl's family said Adams attacked her because she rejected his advances. Adams, nicknamed \"The Animal\" because of his intense playing style, was considered a defensive whiz and led the Rebels in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots for their PCAA champions in 1983-84 and 1984-85. \"I used drugs occasionally, when I wanted to do it,\" Adams said. \"When I went to play basketball, if I needed a pain reliever, I would sniff some cocaine.\" His trouble with the law escalated in 1985, a day after he was drafted in the fourth round by the Washington Bullets, when the two-time All-PCAA first-team selection was arrested for stealing a car. In high school, Adams and several teammates allegedly stole their own coach's auto.\n\nGlendon Alexander, Arkansas (Nolan Richardson Jr.)/Oklahoma State (Eddie Sutton) - Imprisoned at Seagoville (Tex.) Federal Correctional Institution after pleading guilty to bank and wire fraud. Among a variety of con jobs and scams, Alexander's most brazen was transferring nearly $1.5 million from the account of a California adult-entertainment industry executive into his account. Alexander, who averaged 10.1 ppg from 1996-97 through 1999-00 before saying later he seldom attended class at either school, took the money after meeting the nanny of the adult entertainment figure's children in an internet chat room and visiting her in Encinitas, Calif. Alexander, who earned a spot on the 1996-97 SEC All-Freshman team with Arkansas before competing in the NCAA playoffs with Oklahoma State, also admitted to writing checks totaling $46,500 off the commercial account of a Dallas area dentist and $150,000 worth of cash and jewelry from former major leaguer Derek Bell. He averaged 9.4 ppg in 1998-99 when OSU teammate Doug Gottlieb led the nation in assists. Described by Richardson as \"a troublesome person; an habitual liar,\" Alexander was arrested in May 2009 and sentenced to six months in federal prison for failure to make restitution payments. He reportedly attempted to cash a scholarship check belonging to a OSU teammate with a forged signature.\n\nAndre Allen, Memphis (John Calipari) - Arrested in fall of 2010 and faced charges including possession of marijuana with intent to sell, improper display of registration and violation of light law. Police also noticed a loaded handgun in Allen's pants although he had a handgun carry permit. The backup to standout point guard Derrick Rose was suspended from the Tigers' 2008 squad before it reached the Final Four for failing an NCAA-mandated drug test. He spent his first season out of uniform focusing on academics and dealing with charges of soliciting a prostitute. In the fall of 2014, Allen was arrested after officials said they found money, pot and a stolen loaded gun in his Cadillac. In late March 2019, he was arrested at his residence after narcotics detectives executed a search warrant.\n\nClifford Allen, UNLV (Jerry Tarkanian) - November 1985 J.C. signee by the Rebels was sentenced to 45 years in prison after pleading no contest to second-degree murder as part of a plea bargain in the death of a man in Milton, Fla. Allen, a native of Los Angeles, said in a recorded statement that he used a steak knife to kill a 64-year-old guidance counselor after the man allegedly made sexual advances in the counselor's trailer. Allen was driving the victim's auto when he was arrested.\n\nTony Allen, Oklahoma State (Eddie Sutton) - Big 12 Conference MVP in 2004 was charged in late November 2021 with domestic assault, domestic vandalism and interference with emergency calls in connection with an incident at his wife's apartment. Previously, he was found not guilty after indicted on three counts of aggravated battery escalating into an August 2005 shooting in his native Chicago. Juco recruit was arrested in late summer 2002 for obstruction and resisting a police officer after 25 cops were summoned at 2:30 a.m. to break up riot of about 300 people linked to rival groups from OSU and Langston University at a Whataburger restaurant.\n\nDonell \"D-Nice\" Allick, Providence (Tim Welsh)/Louisiana Tech (Keith Richard) - After averaging 11.8 ppg, 3.5 rpg and 3.6 apg as a Louisiana Tech teammate of Paul Millsap in 2003-04 and 2004-05 following a brief stint with PC, junior college recruit was convicted of several drug offenses and served time in prison. In late June 2011, he was the victim of a homicide in the wee hours of the morning in New Haven, Conn., when he was shot several times in the back. Police believe he was targeted and ambushed after a domestic dispute. He had pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance after being nabbed in New Rochelle with 1,000 packets of heroin before violating probation in 2010.\n\nDesmond Allison, Kentucky (Tubby Smith)/Martin Methodist TN - Slain in Columbus, Ohio, in late July 2011 when shot multiple times in senseless incident at an apartment complex amid two women arguing over a baseball cap. Starter as a freshman (over future NBA standout Tayshaun Prince), he was kicked off the Wildcats' squad just before the 2000 NCAA playoffs after a DUI and marijuana possession charge in connection with UK's short-lived \"no-tolerance\" policy. He subsequently had multiple arrests in his Tampa hometown on drug charges. At the end, Allison left behind multiple children and mothers.\n\nDarrell Allums, UCLA (Gene Bartow, Gary Cunningham and Larry Brown) - Center for the Bruins' 1980 NCAA Tournament runner-up was sentenced to nine years in state prison for armed robbery. According to a probation report, Allums became dependent on cocaine and turned to robbing Target stores and Domino's Pizza deliverymen to get cash.\n\nRafer Alston, Fresno State (Jerry Tarkanian) - Pleaded no contest in 1997 to assaulting his former girlfriend and was arrested for violation of parole in 1998 the same year he set Fresno's single-season record for assists. Alston had two brushes with the law in August 2007 - charged with misdemeanor assault and public intoxication in Houston and charged with stabbing a man at a Manhattan nightspot. He was sued stemming from a brawl in July 2010 for allegedly hitting a fellow Queens strip club patron with a bottle. Alston was suspended by the Miami Heat for the final portion of the 2009-10 campaign after an unexplained absence from the team.\n\nBenny Anders, Houston (Guy Lewis) - After participating in back-to-back Final Fours (1983 and 1984), his college career ended in the summer of 1985 when he was sentenced to three years' probation for possession of a gun on campus.\n\nChris Andersen, Houston (Clyde Drexler) - UH dropout received a two-year ban from the NBA in 2006 for violating the league's drug policy. He tested positive for a \"drug of abuse\" (not marijuana, which would have drawn a five-game suspension).\n\nDwight Anderson, Kentucky (Joe B. Hall)/Southern California (Stan Morrison) - Prep phenomenon claims he got into drugs after transferring from UK to USC, where Anderson led the Trojans in scoring in 1980-81 and 1981-82. Shackled by a reputation of drug addiction, he bounced around in the basketball minor leagues before ending up in the back alleys of his Dayton, Ohio, hometown and becoming homeless (living on his parents' porch because they wouldn't let him in). Played in underground games hosted by drug dealers before turning his life around working for a local church.\n\nGreg \"Cadillac\" Anderson, Houston (Guy Lewis) - The All-SWC first-team selection in 1985-86 and 1986-87 was sentenced to five months in prison after pleading guilty in federal court to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. A grand jury in Biloxi, Miss., indicted Anderson in June 1998, accusing him and three other men of buying and selling cocaine in Biloxi and Houston, his hometown.\n\nWillie Anderson, Georgia (Hugh Durham) - In the fall of 2003, he reportedly lost almost all of the $1.75 million he was to receive from a deferred 10-year contract with the San Antonio Spurs to the IRS and three women who said he did not pay child support. The IRS, in a lawsuit, had sought almost $400,000 from what it said were unpaid taxes from a nightclub Anderson co-owned, Strictly Jazz, plus unpaid income taxes. During court hearings in 2000, it was revealed Anderson fathered at least nine children by seven women. Civil warrants were issued twice for his arrest in child-support matters in Georgia state court. The two-time All-SEC selection in the late 1980s was jailed in November 1999 for contempt when he didn't show up for another hearing.\n\nCarmelo Anthony, Syracuse (Jim Boeheim) - Arrested on suspicion of drunken driving at 4 a.m. in mid-April 2008 after one of his worst games of the season with Denver. He was suspended for 25 contests during the 2006-07 campaign for punching New York Knicks guard Mardy Collins in the face during one of the NBA's worst brawls. Linked to the mantle of the \"stop snitchin'\" movement, appearing in an underground DVD circulated in his Baltimore hometown in 2004, encouraging those who are questioned by the police to refuse to \"snitch\" on drug dealers, murderers and other criminals. Suspended one game without pay midway through the 2012-13 campaign for confronting an opposing player (Boston's Kevin Garnett) multiple times (in arena tunnel, near players' locker rooms and in parking garage) following a loss against the Celtics.\n\nKeith Appling, Michigan State (Tom Izzo) - All-Big Ten Conference selection was sentenced to a year in jail after pleading guilty to carrying a concealed weapon and attempted resisting and obstructing a police officer as part of a plea deal. The case was the third in which he faced weapons-related charges in a four-month span in mid-2016. The Spartans' leader in assists from 2011-12 through 2013-14 was arrested at a Dearborn strip club in late spring and charged with carrying a concealed weapon (handgun under driver's seat), possession of a loaded firearm (AK-47 in trunk) and marijuana possession. The next month, Appling was arrested again on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon. Near the end of summer, he was apprehended after police located a discarded Gucci bag missing from his vehicle (with loaded semi-automatic Beretta inside). In mid-February 2020, Appling faced heroin charges (sentenced to 18 months of probation). Appling and teammate Adrien Payne were accused of raping a student in their dorm room in September 2010 during freshmen orientation, but no charges were filed and neither was suspended. In May 2021, he was arrested in connection with the probe of a Detroit murder. Earlier the same month, he faced serious charges for two felonies: Assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder and felony firearms (altercation with a female acquaintance's ex-boyfriend).\n\nGilbert Arenas, Arizona (Lute Olson) - Suspended for most of the 2009-10 NBA season stemming from a felony gun possession in a locker room and subsequent actions appearing to make light of the episode. Arrested in May 2006 in Miami after allegedly ignoring a police officer's command to return to his car (charges later dropped). Pleaded no contest to misdemeanor weapon charges resulting from an incident in San Mateo County (Calif.) in 2003 after being an All-Pacific-10 selection as a sophomore in 2000-01. Arrested in California in late June 2013 for possession of illegal fireworks in the back of his pickup truck. In the spring of 2014, Arenas took a cinder block and smashed a Mercedes his longtime flame had been driving, claiming the incident was revenge for her allegedly breaking numerous windows in his house and ruining his Netflix account by throwing his computer into the pool. In late January 2016, Arenas bragged on social media how he committed credit-card fraud at strip clubs.\n\nRon Artest, St. John's (Fran Fraschilla and Mike Jarvis) - Authorities arrested him in early March 2007 after a woman called 911 from his five-acre Sacramento estate saying she had been assaulted. Deputies arrested him on suspicion of domestic violence and using force or violence to prevent his victim from reporting a crime. Five years earlier, he was ordered to attend anger management classes after another girlfriend (mother of one of his children) filed assault charges against him. His temper flared in 2003 at New York's Madison Square Garden when he smashed a video monitor valued at $100,000. He drew six suspensions in the 2002-03 season and two in the 2003-04 campaign. On November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills (Mich.), Artest went into the stands igniting a melee with the crowd and subsequently received the longest suspension in NBA history for an infraction not linked to drugs or gambling (86 games: 73 regular season and 13 postseason). All-Big East Conference first-team selection as a sophomore in 1998-99 changed his name to Metta World Peace in mid-September 2011. Told Yahoo Sports that on multiple occasions he was approached to fix games when he played for St. John's.\n\nVincent Askew, Memphis State (Dana Kirk) - Freshman starter for the Tigers' 1985 Final Four team was arrested in mid-August 2008, accused of unlawfully having sex with a minor (16-year-old girl) in a Miami hotel room. He pleaded guilty to a charge of child abuse with no great bodily harm and was placed on probation for three years. Briefly coached Elliston Baptist Academy in Memphis before leaving the job under a cloud. Attended summer school at Kansas under Larry Brown before budding transfer returned to Memphis. KU was placed on probation stemming from wrongdoing in connection with improper inducements to Askew.\n\nCornelius \"Corky\" Ausborne, UNLV (Bill Bayno) - J.C. recruit who averaged 6.5 ppg as a senior in 1997-98 was sentenced in mid-February 2005 to two to five years in prison followed by five years probation for being a teacher having sexual relations with two middle school Hispanic girls.\n\nClyde Austin, North Carolina State (Norman Sloan) - Sentenced to 17 1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty in mid-December, 2003, to fraud and money laundering charges related to a Ponzi scheme that duped over 1,000 investors out of more than $16 million. What made Austin's situation worse was that most of the people he swindled trusted him as a minister. He was an All-ACC second-team selection as a sophomore in 1977-78.\n\nRyan Ayers, Notre Dame (Mike Brey) - Charged with three counts of voyeurism and one count of domestic violence. Charges involved his relationships with two women over a four-year span where he allegedly recorded them, without their consent, naked or while having sex with them.
