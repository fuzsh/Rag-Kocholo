        "text": "Obituary\n\nMass of the Resurrection for Katie Garcia, 90, currently of Albuquerque, will be celebrated at 10:00 AM, Wed., Mar. 31, 2021 at St. Helen Catholic Church by Fr. Francisco Carbajal. Burial will follow in the Portales Cemetery with Rick Garcia, Marquez Garcia, Adam Gomez, Daniel Gomez, Robert Sanchez and Frankie Dean Armijo serving as pallbearers. Her former son-in-law, Alfonso Gomez will be an honorary pallbearer.\n\nCayetana Garcia was born April 12, 1930 in Encino, NM to the home of Julia (Pena) and Jose T. Larranaga and died on the morning of Mar. 27, 2021 at the home of her son in Albuquerque. Shortly after starting school, she decided to use the name “Katie,” as Cayetana seemed to be too hard to pronounce. Katie was the name she used for the rest of her life. On July 1, 1948, in Encino, she was married to Edward D. Garcia. Soon after their marriage, they moved to Portales to make their home. For most of her life she was a fulltime homemaker, raising her daughter and three sons. For a time she worked as a cook at a local truck stop, and also sometimes worked cleaning motel rooms. She loved to crochet and embroider as well as sewing. Mrs. Garcia was a faithful member of St. Helen Catholic Church, and also of Des Colores.\n\nShe is survived by two sons and daughters-in-law, Paul and Angie Garcia of Sacramento, CA and Lawrence and Linda Garcia of Albuquerque; 14 grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren, great-great-grandchildren and even great-great-great-grandchildren; and by her former son-in-law, Alfonso Gomez of Portales. She was preceded in death by her parents, a son, Jerry Garcia, a daughter, Connie Wilson and by her beloved husband, Edward D. Garcia who died Oct. 25, 2005."
