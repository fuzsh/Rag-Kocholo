Bish,79, of Weirton, WV passed away on Friday, November 20, 2020, at Valley Hospice Care Center South (Lizaâ€™s Place) in Wheeling, WV.\n\nLarry was born November 13, 1941, son of the late Guy Clifford Bish and Mary Agnes (Murphy) Bish. He was also preceded in death by his brothers Jim and Bill and sisters Betty, Helen, and Evelyn.\n\nLarry is survived by his wife of 56 years, Judy (Dennis) Bish. He is also survived by his four children; Greg (Alice Kao), Chuck (Missy Basler), Jim, and Patty Jo Kell (Tim Knierim) as well as his five grandchildren; Brennan, Ethan, Augy, Suzannah, and Katie; his siblings, Carl, Ruth, John, Bernie, and Mary Jane, as well as many nieces and nephews.\n\nLarry found great joy in supporting the endeavors and accomplishments of his children and grandchildren. He always encouraged them towards their goals and assisted them any way he could to overcome challenges. He was extremely proud of each of them.\n\nLarry was known for the many family vacations, hunting, fishing, reading, watching sports, and cheering on the greyhounds as they ran around the track. Larry especially enjoyed the treasured moments he spent with his grandkids. He was well known by all of the family picnic attendees as the French fry guy serving up fresh hot fries for hours on end. However, some of his greatest memories were from the time he spent on Piney Ridge.\n\nLarry had a great talent for storytelling. He was a man who knew and valued the importance of education and hard work. He always encouraged others to do the same.\n\nLarry served in the U.S. Army for three years. He proudly retired in 1994 from Weirton Steel after 30 years of dedicated service.\n\nA private service will be held at Greco-Hertnick Funeral Home at the convenience of his family. Larry will be cremated per his wishes, and his final resting place will be on Piney Ridge.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to Mary H. Weir Library in his memory.\nShare tributes and memories at www.grecohertnick.com",
