        "text": "Signs Exhibit 10 deal\n\nAn undrafted guard out of UNLV, Harkless joined the Clippers for Summer League and was a standout performer. He'll get to stick with the organization to start training camp, but Harkless has an uphill battle to make the initial NBA roster and likely will start his rookie campaign in the G League.\n\nPuts up 19 in win over Brazil\n\nBatum heavily contributed in the scoring column while picking up significant minutes in Saturday's win. The 35-year-old is competing in his fourth Olympic Games, and his veteran presence will play an important role in France's Olympic campaign. The 16-year NBA vet played in 57 regular-season games for the 76ers last season, during which he averaged 5.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists across 25.8 minutes.\n\nLands two-way deal\n\nFlowers initially committed to play collegiately at Louisville but ultimately chose to play in the NBL in Australia with the Adelaide 36ers last year. He averaged 5.5 points and 3.1 rebounds in 14.4 minutes per game with Adelaide and will now attempt to carve out a role in the NBA."
