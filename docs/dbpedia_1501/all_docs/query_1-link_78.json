        "text": "Days remaining in session: 8\n\nWorker benefits: Local governments no longer would be able to mandate that businesses provide sick leave, family leave or fringe benefits for workers under a bill that cleared the House Business and Employment Committee on Tuesday.\n\nHouse Bill 211, sponsored by Rep. Jason Harper, R-Rio Rancho, and Sen. Mark Moores, R-Albuquerque, originally would have taken away the ability of local governments to establish their own minimum wage. However, Harper on Tuesday introduced a substitute bill that removed the wage provision, which would have rolled back the minimum wage laws enacted in Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Las Cruces, as well as Santa Fe and Bernalillo counties.\n\nHarper and Moores removed that provision after protests from workers and labor groups at a previous hearing.\n\nVarious business groups and small business owners spoke in favor of the bill, while representatives from labor unions opposed it.\n\nEleven members — seven Republicans and four Democrats — voted for the bill, while two Democrats opposed it.\n\nThe bill goes to the House floor. If passed by the House, the proposal would go to the Senate.\n\nBipartisan gun bill: A Senate committee's action Tuesday drew praise from a former astronaut who now is a spokesman for a national gun-control group.\n\nMark Kelly, who with his wife, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, founded Americans for Responsible Solutions, applauded the Senate Public Affairs Committee for unanimously recommending passage of Senate Bill 331. Supporters say the measure would close loopholes in New Mexico law by requiring the state's courts to report relevant mental health records to the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\n\n\"Today, Republicans and Democrats came together to strengthen our background checks system, keep guns out of the wrong hands, and make New Mexico's families safer,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"This legislation recognizes the reality that our background check system is only as good as the records of the dangerous individuals that it contains, and this bill will help ensure that more of those records are in the system and fewer guns fall into the wrong hands.\"\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Sen. Daniel Ivey-Soto, D-Albuquerque, now goes to the Senate Judiciary Committee. An identical House bill, HB 91, sponsored by House Majority Leader Nate Gentry, R-Albuquerque, is stuck in the House Rules Committee, which, three weeks into the session, has not yet met.\n\nAbortion bill: It looks like a House panel will get to vote again on a bill to increase state oversight of abortion providers.\n\nThe House Health Committee last week voted 6-4 to table HB 275, sponsored by Rep. Rod Montoya, R-Farmington. Republican Rep. Andy Nuñez of Hatch voted with five Democrats to table the bill.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Nuñez told the committee he wants to change his vote on the proposal, which would require state workers to inspect abortion clinics to determine if infants \"born alive\" after attempted abortions were then killed by medical professionals.\n\nEven with Nuñez's reversal, prospects for the bill are nil. Assuming no other committee member's vote is changed, Nuñez's turnabout would make it a 5-5 tie, and the bill would not advance.\n\nRep. Debbie Armstrong, D-Albuquerque, a committee member who voted against the measure, said she expects the panel will hear it again Thursday.\n\nEarly childhood education: Senate Democrats held a news conference Tuesday to criticize Republican Gov. Susana Martinez. They said Martinez's focus on crime-and-punishment bills has stalled or stopped bills that would put people to work.\n\nSen. Michael Padilla, D-Albuquerque, said 5,300 jobs could be created through a proposed constitutional amendment to use part of the $15 billion land grant endowment for early childhood education. Martinez's opposition is stopping that, Padilla said.\n\nBut standing near Padilla was fellow Democratic Sen. Carlos Cisneros, who has been one of the more outspoken opponents of tapping the endowment for early childhood programs.\n\nAsked if he had changed his position, Cisneros didn't directly answer. Instead, he said the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is a member, would look closely at the proposed constitutional amendment. The committee in previous years has rejected the proposal to expand early childhood education, and Cisneros has voted against it.\n\nA committee of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has already stopped a similar proposal to fund early childhood education, so it appears that the amendment won't make the ballot no matter what the Senate does.\n\nCrime bills: House Republicans held their own news conference and again blasted Senate Democrats for holding up their crime-and-punishment bills.\n\nRep. Paul Pacheco, R-Albuquerque, sponsor of many of those bills, told reporters that the Republican majority in the House is \"responding to the will of the people\" in passing a slate of tough-on-crime bills.\n\n\"How much is a human life worth?\" he said, referring to victims of high-profile crimes last year.\n\nPacheco also argued that crime may impact whether companies want to locate to the state.\n\nRep. Larry Larrañaga, R-Albuquerque, chairman of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee, responded to Democrats' criticism that the GOP wasn't doing anything about job creation. He cited a job-training program as an example of a Republican jobs item in the state budget proposed by the House.\n\nLooking Ahead: Twenty community groups including the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter plan to host Land, Water and Wildlife Day at the Capitol from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 11. The event offers the public an opportunity to meet with representatives from dozens of conservation organizations, attend a lobby training and hear from legislators including Sen. Howie Morales, D-Silver City; Sen. Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe; Rep. Brian Egolf, D-Santa Fe; Rep. Jeff Steinborn, D-Las Cruces, and others.\n\nQuote of the day: \"Somehow this became known as the anti-minimum wage bill.\" — Rep. Jason Harper, R-Rio Rancho, at a committee hearing on his HB 211. The bill became known as \"anti-minimum wage\" because in its original form it would have meant smaller paychecks for low-wage workers in some cities — including a drop of more that $3 an hour in Santa Fe.\n\nRead Steve Terrell's blog at http://tinyurl.com/ROUNDHOUSEROUNDUP and Milan Simonich's Ringside Seat column at http://tinyurl.com/RingsideSeat"
