        "text": "Vernon Lloyd Houston, 89, went home to be with the Lord Thursday evening. He was born in Capulin, New Mexico on November 18th, 1928 to Ben and Bonnie (Barnes) Houston. His father was a barber and the family moved often. Vernon attended schools in several communities around New Mexico including, Farley, Santa Rosa, Tucumcari, and Hot Springs (T or C). He served as a Corporal in the U.S. Army from January 1951 to December 1952. He came to Socorro in 1953 to attend New Mexico Tech, where he met his wife, Betty (Halderman) Houston of 53 years. Together they operated the Fashion Dry Cleaners for 31 years. They opened the first self-serve gas station in Socorro several years later. Together they had two daughters and later adopted a son. Vernon was active in the Socorro community; Captain on Socorro’s Volunteer Fire Dept., a charter member of The Socorro Old Car Club, he belonged to the V.F.W. and the American Legion, was Zoning Commissioner, and a Trustee of St. Paul’s United Methodist Church. In more recent years, he was an active member of the Knights of Pythias helping to locate plots and grave sites at the Socorro Masonic Cemetery, a member of the Tin Lizzy Club of Albuquerque, and attended church at St. Paul’s UMC regularly. He loved restoring houses and old cars as well as traveling to his vacation home in Puerto Lobos, Mexico. Going to the Flea Market and talking to everyone he knew was the highlight of his week.\n\nVernon is preceded in death by his mother, father, his brother Allan Houston and his wife Cynthia, his daughter Deanna Lea Houston, and son Darrell Lloyd Houston. He is survived by his loving wife, Betty, and their daughter Debra Berkey, son-in-law DeGraff Berkey, two grandsons, Houston and John, and two nephews James Allan Houston and family, and Spencer Houston and family.\n\nServices will be held at St. Paul’s United Methodist Church in Socorro, NM on Wednesday, March 28th at 10:00 a.m. There will be early visitation beginning at 8:30 a.m. Interment will be at the Socorro Masonic Cemetery immediately following the service. In lieu of flowers please send a donation to the charity of your choice."
