Three hundred eleven patients with primary operable carcinoma of the breast were entered in a surgical and adjunctive chemotherapy trial in Alabama between 1975 and 1978. A total of 91 surgeons participated (all Diplomats of the American Board of Surgery and Members of the American College of Surgeons). All operative reports, pathology and therapy were reviewed by referees. Histologically node positive patients were randomized after operation to receive melphalan or C.M.F.(cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-FU) for 1 year. After a median follow-up of 5.5 years, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival or in overall survival between the two groups. There was a trend toward improved 5-year survival rates in the radical mastectomy group compared to the modified radical mastectomy group (84% vs. 76%, p = 0.14). There was also an increased incidence of local wound recurrence in those patients receiving modified radical mastectomy, but the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.09). Longer follow-up will be necessary to evaluate these results more fully.

Most commonly the surgical approach of choice is a modified radical mastectomy (MRM), due to it allowing for both the removal of the main tumor mass and adjacent glandular tissue, which are suspected of infiltration and multifocality of the process, and a sentinel axillary lymph node removal. Most commonÂ post-surgical complications following MRM are the formation of a hematoma, the infection of the surgical wound and the formation of a seroma. TheseÂ post-surgical complications can, at least in part, be attributed to the drainage of the surgical wound. However, the lack of modern and official guidelines provides an ample scope for innovation, but also leads to a need for a randomized comparison of the results. We compared different approaches to wound drainage after MRM, reviewed based on the armamentarium, number of drains, location, type of drainage system, timing of drain removal and no drainage alternatives. Currently, based on the general results, scientific and comparative discussions, seemingly the most affordable methodology with the best patient outcome, with regards to hospital stay and post-operative complications, is the placement of one medial to lateral (pectoro-axillary) drain with low negative pressure. Ideally, the drain should be removed on the second or third postoperative day or when the amount of drained fluid in the last 24 hours reaches below 50 milliliters.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of latissimus dorsi restoration during modified radical mastectomy in breast cancer patients by evaluating 365 cases. Among these cases, 185 received modified radical mastectomy combined with intraoperative latissimus dorsi restoration, while 180 received modified radical mastectomy alone. The flap tension, drainage fluid amount and extubation time were compared between the two methods. The flap tension in patients who received modified radical mastectomy combined with intraoperative latissimus dorsi restoration was significantly lower and the blood supply was better. After surgery, the drainage fluid amount was also significantly lower in these patients compared with the control group. Furthermore, the mean time to drainage tube removal was significantly shorter in these patients and the postoperative cosmetic outcome was superior. Thus, it was concluded that modified radical mastectomy combined with intraoperative latissimus dorsi restoration in breast cancer patients was associated with reduced drainage fluid effusion, shorter hospitalization time and decreased flap tension.

It is estimated that the local recurrence rates following nipple-sparing mastectomy are very similar to breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of nipple-sparing mastectomy and areola-sparing mastectomy for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer in women. We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (via OVID) and LILACS (via Biblioteca Virtual em SaÃºde [BVS]) using the search terms \"nipple sparing mastectomy\" and \"areola-sparing mastectomy\". Also, we searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. All searches were conducted on 30th September 2014 and we did not apply any language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) however if there were no RCTs, we expanded our criteria to include non-randomised comparative studies (cohort and case-control studies). Studies evaluated nipple-sparing and areola-sparing mastectomy compared to modified radical mastectomy or skin-sparing mastectomy for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer. Two review authors (BS and RR) performed data extraction and resolved disagreements. We performed descriptive analyses and meta-analyses of the data using Review Manager software. We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool to assess studies, and adapted it for non-randomised studies, and we evaluated the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. We included 11 cohort studies, evaluating a total of 6502 participants undergoing 7018 procedures: 2529 underwent a nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM), 818 underwent skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) and 3671 underwent traditional mastectomy, also known as modified radical\n\nThe pattern of prognostic and risk indicators among women with breast cancer undergoing modified radical mastectomy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\n\nPubMed\n\nMwakigonja, Amos R; Rabiel, Happiness; Mbembati, Naboth A; Lema, Leonard E K\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBreast cancer is the commonest female malignancy globally and the second (after uterine cervix) in sub-Saharan Africa including Tanzania. Prognostic indicators reportedly influence post-mastectomy adjuvant therapy by predicting risks on survival and recurrence although in Tanzania this data is lacking. Here, we evaluate the pattern of prognostic and risk indicators among women with breast cancer undergoing modified-radical-mastectomy (MRM) at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) and Tumaini Hospital (TH), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This hospital-based prospective cross-sectional study included female patients undergoing MRM from April 2011 to January 2012. Clinical stage I-III patients were enrolled after being scheduled for mastectomy. Patients with evidence of distant metastasis (stage IV) were excluded. Mastectomy and axillary lymph nodes biopsies were submitted to the Histopathology laboratory for grade, type, nodal and margins status. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS. A total of 348 patients were admitted with breast cancer including 86 patients (with 16 from TH having similar demography and presentation) meeting inclusion criteria. Age-range at diagnosis was 28-79 years, mean 52.1Â years. Most (89Â %) attained menarche after 11Â years. About 56Â % were postmenopausal. The majority (78Â %) were multiparous with positive family history in 14.1 and 37.6Â % used hormonal contraceptives. About 27.1Â % were social alcohol drinkers. The majority (61Â %) had T4b disease, 75.6Â % had positive axillary nodes including 42.7Â % with 4-9 involved nodes (N2). The commonest (91.9Â %) histological type was invasive ductal carcinoma. Lobular, medullary and mucinous carcinomas were rare. Most (83.7Â %) of our patients presented with stage III and the rest stage II. Intermediate- and high-grade tumors accounted for 73.5Â %.

No participants underwent areola-sparing mastectomy. There was a high risk of confounding for all reported outcomes. For overall survival, the hazard ratio (HR) for NSM compared to SSM was 0.70 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.73; 2 studies; 781 participants) and the HR for NSM compared to MRM was 0.72 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.13; 2 studies, 1202 participants). Local recurrence was evaluated in two studies, the HR for NSM compared to MRM was 0.28 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.68; 2 studies, 1303 participants). The overall risk of complications was different in NSM when compared to other types of mastectomy in general (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.82, 2 studies, P = 0.03; 1067 participants). With respect to skin necrosis, there was no evidence of a difference with NSM compared to other types of mastectomy, but the confidence interval was wide (RR 4.22, 95% CI 0.59 to 30.03, P = 0.15; 4 studies, 1948 participants). We observed no difference among the three types of mastectomy with respect to the risk of local infection (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.09, P = 0.91, 2 studies; 496 participants). Meta-analysis was not possible when assessing cosmetic outcomes and quality of life, but in general the NSM studies reported a favourable aesthetic result and a gain in quality of life compared with the other types of mastectomy. The quality of evidence was considered very low for all outcomes due to the high risk of selection bias and wide confidence intervals. Authorsâ conclusions The findings from these observational studies of very low-quality evidence were inconclusive for all outcomes due to the high risk of selection bias.

Women aged 20-49 years, diagnosed with early breast cancer between 1989 and 1998, were identified. Management with BCT or MRM was compared for local (L), locoregional (LR), and distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) by age group (20-39 years, 40-49 years). The analysis was repeated for patients considered \"ideal\" candidates for BCT: tumor size < or =2 cm, pathologically negative axillary nodes, negative margins, and no reported ductal carcinoma in situ. A total of 1,597 women received BCT, and 801 had MRM. After a median follow-up of 9.0 years, the outcomes (L, LR, BCSS) were worse for the younger age group; however, the outcomes were not statistically different by type of local treatment. For women aged 20-39 years considered \"ideal\" for BCT, those treated with BCT had slightly lower LRFS compared with those treated with MRM (p = 0.3), but DRFS and BCSS were similar. A difference in LRFS at 10 years potentially favored MRM among women aged 20-39 years considered \"ideal\" BCT candidates but was not statistically significant and did not translate into a noticeable difference in DRFS or BCSS. Our data suggest that young age alone is not a contraindication to BCT.\n\nErector spinae plane block for radical mastectomy: A new indication?\n\nPubMed\n\nVeiga, M; Costa, D; BrazÃ£o, I\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe erector spinae plane block is a technique recently described by Forero et al. in September 2016. It has applications in the control of chronic pain with neuropathic component of the chest wall, and for pain control in thoracoscopic surgery. In this article, we describe the use of this technique as part of a multimodal analgesic approach in a 40-year-old woman, who underwent radical mastectomy due to breast cancer. By performing this block before anesthetic induction, we have achieved an opioid sparing effect, avoiding a possible immunomodulatory effect, although not yet proven in humans. During hospitalization, the patient reported no pain (0/10 in numeric scale), without resorting to rescue analgesia. The easy, fast and safe execution of erector spinae plane block makes it a promising technique in the context of surgical pain during radical mastectomy.

Six patients with cervical ulcers as a result of radiotherapy after radical mastectomy were hospitalized from March 2010 to February 2015, suffering from persistent pain in different degrees. The wound area ranged from 6 cm Ã 4 cm to 10 cm Ã 6 cm before debridement, 8 cm Ã 5 cm to 16 cm Ã 10 cm after debridement. Ipsilateral lower trapezius myocutaneous flap was used to repair the wound after thorough debridement, with the area ranging from 10 cm Ã 7 cm to 20 cm Ã 13 cm. The donor sites were sutured directly or covered with medium-thickness skin graft obtained from the back. Pain was obviously relieved in all the patients 2 days after surgery. The wounds in five patients were healed, while necrosis of superficial skin approximately 1 cm in diameter appeared at the distal end of one myocutaneous flap, and it healed after dressing change. During the follow-up period of 3 to 18 months, no recurrence of ulcer was found, the texture of the myocutaneous flaps was soft with good appearance, and the donor sites healed well. On the basis of thorough debridement, it is feasible to repair the cervical ulcer as a result of radiotherapy after radical mastectomy with the ipsilateral lower trapezius myocutaneous flap.\n\nPostmastectomy radiation therapy for lymph node-negative, locally advanced breast cancer after modified radical mastectomy: analysis of the NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, James B; Wilson, Lynn D; Dasgupta, Tina; Castrucci, William A; Weidhaas, Joanne B\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThe role of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) for lymph node-negative locally advanced breast carcinoma (T3N0M0) after modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with regard to improvement in survival remains an area of controversy. The 1973-2004 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was examined for patients with T3N0M0 ductal, lobular, or mixed ductal and lobular carcinoma of the breast who underwent MRM, treated from 1988-2003. Patients who were men, who had positive lymph nodes, who survived < or =6 months, for whom breast cancer was not the first malignancy, who had nonbeam radiation, intraoperative or preoperative radiation were excluded. The average treatment effect of PMRT on mortality was estimated with a propensity score case-matched analysis. In all, 1777 patients were identified; 568 (32%) patients received PMRT. Median tumor size was 6.3 cm. The median number of lymph nodes examined was 14 (range, 1-49). Propensity score matched case-control analysis showed no improvement in overall survival with the delivery of PMRT in this group. Older patients, patients with ER- disease (compared with ER+), and patients with high-grade tumors (compared with well differentiated) had increased mortality. The use of PMRT for T3N0M0 breast carcinoma after MRM is not associated with an increase in overall survival. It was not possible to analyze local control in this study given the limitations of the SEER database. The impact of potential improvement in local control as it relates to overall survival should be the subject of further investigation.

The parecoxib group received intravenous parecoxib (40 mg, 5 mL) during general anesthesia induction, post-operative day 1 and day 2; the control group received intravenous normal saline (5 mL) at the corresponding time points. Their peripheral bloods were collected for routine test in the morning of the surgery day (T1), and Day 1 (T2), Day 3 (T3) and Day 7 (T4) after the surgery, and NLR was calculated.â© Results: Compared with T1, NLR in the control group at T2 and T3 was significantly increased (P<0.05), but not at T4 (P>0.05); NLR in the parecoxib group was sharply increased at T2 (P<0.01), and returned to preoperative levels at T3 and T4 (P>0.05). NLR in the parecoxib group was significantly lower than that in the control group at T2 (P<0.05), but there were no significant difference between the two groups at other time points (P>0.05).â© Conclusion: Parecoxib can restrain the inflammatory responses and improve immune function of the breast cancer patients by suppressing the elevation of NLR after the modified radical mastectomy, which is expected to improve the prognosis of the breast cancer patients.\n\nEffects of music therapy on pain among female breast cancer patients after radical mastectomy: results from a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Xiao-Mei; Yan, Hong; Zhou, Kai-Na; Dang, Shao-Nong; Wang, Duo-Lao; Zhang, Yin-Ping\n\n2011-07-01\n\nMusic therapy has been used in multiple health care settings to reduce patient pain, anxiety, and stress. However, few available studies have investigated its effect on pain among breast cancer patients after radical mastectomy. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of music therapy on pain reduction in patients with breast cancer after radical mastectomy. This randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Surgical Department of Oncology Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from March to November 2009. A total of 120 breast cancer patients who received Personal Controlled Analgesia (PCA) following surgery (mastectomy) were randomly allocated to two groups, an intervention group and a control group (60 patients in each group). The intervention group accepted music therapy from the first day after radical mastectomy to the third admission to hospital for chemotherapy in addition to the routine nursing care, while the control group received only routine nursing care. Pain scores were measured at baseline and three post-tests using the General Questionnaire and Chinese version of Short-Form of McGill Pain Questionnaire. The primary endpoint was the change in the Pain Rating Index (PRI-total) score from baseline. Music therapy was found to reduce the PRI-total score in the intervention group significantly compared with the control group with a mean difference (95% CI) of -2.38 (-2.80, -1.95), -2.41 (-2.85, -1.96), and -1.87 (-2.33, -1.42) for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd post-tests, respectively. Similar results were found for Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scores. The findings of the study provide some evidence that music therapy has both short- and long-term positive effects on alleviating pain in breast cancer patients following radical mastectomy.\n\nCombining Manual Lymph Drainage with Physical Exercise after Modified Radical Mastectomy Effectively Prevents Upper Limb Lymphedema.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Lijuan; Fan, Aiqun; Yan, Jun; He, Yan; Zhang, Huiting; Zhang, Huizhen; Zhong, Qiaoling; Liu, Feng; Luo, Qinghua; Zhang, Liping; Tang, Hailin; Xin, Mingzhu\n\n2016-06-01\n\nUpper limb lymphedema is a common complication after radical mastectomy in patients with breast cancer. In this study, we examined the efficacy of self-manual lymph drainage (MLD) after modified radical mastectomy for the prevention of upper limb lymphedema, scar formation, or shoulder joint dysfunction in breast cancer patients. Breast cancer patients scheduled for modified radical mastectomy were randomly apportioned to undergo physical exercise only (PE group, the control; nâ=â500) or self-MLD as well as exercise (MLD group; nâ=â500) after surgery. In the PE group, patients started to undertake remedial exercises and progressive weight training after recovery from anesthesia. In the MLD group, in addition to receiving the same treatments as in the PE group, the patients were trained to perform self-MLD on the surgical incision for 10âmin/session, 3 sessions/day, beginning after suture removal and incision closure (10 to 30 days after the surgery). Scar formation was evaluated at one week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery, respectively. Upper limb circumference and shoulder abduction were measured 24âh before surgery, and at one week, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the surgery. Compared to those in the PE group, patients in MLD group experienced significant improvements in scar contracture, shoulder abduction, and upper limb circumference. Self-MLD, in combination with physical exercise, is beneficial for breast cancer patients in preventing postmastectomy scar formation, upper limb lymphedema, and shoulder joint dysfunction.\n\nPresent and changing trends in surgical modalities and neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration for female breast cancer in Beijing, China: A 10-year (2006-2015) retrospective hospitalization summary report-based study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBao, Xiaoyuan; Sun, Kexin; Tian, Xin; Yin, Qiongzhou; Jin, Meng; Yu, Na; Jiang, Hanfang; Zhang, Jun; Hu, Yonghua\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThis study was conducted to describe present and changing trends in surgical modalities and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in female breast cancer patients in China from 2006 to 2015. Data of 44 299 female breast cancer patients from 15 tertiary hospitals in Beijing were extracted from hospitalization summary reports. Surgeries were categorized into five modalities: breast-conserving surgery (BCS), simple mastectomy (SM), modified radical mastectomy (MRM), radical mastectomy (RM), and extensive radical mastectomy (ERM). In total, 38 471 (86.84%) breast cancer patients underwent surgery: 22.64% BCS, 8.22% SM, 63.97% MRM, 4.24% RM, and 0.93% ERM. Older patients (> 60) underwent surgery more frequently than younger patients (< 60). The proportion of patients who underwent BCS was highest in the age â¥ 80 (39.24%) and < 40 (28.69%) subgroups and in patients with papillary carcinoma (35.48%), and lowest in the age 60- subgroup (18.17%) and in patients with Paget's disease (19.05%). SM was most frequently performed in patients with Paget's disease (29.00%), and MRM for ductal (64.99%), and lobular (63.78%) carcinomas. During the study period, the proportion of patients who underwent MRM dropped by 29.04%, SM and BCS increased from 15.78% and 30.83%, respectively, and NACT increased in all subgroups, particularly in patients with lymph node involvement (26.72%). Surgical modalities varied significantly by age and histologic group. The use of BCS and SM increased dramatically, while MRM declined significantly. The proportion of patients treated with NACT has increased significantly, especially in patients with lymph node involvement. Â© 2018 The Authors.

Between January 2015 and December 2015, 25 female patients with breast cancer were enrolled, aged 24-62 years (mean, 40.6 years). The tumor located at left side in 9 cases and right side in 16 cases; 14 cases were in the left upper quadrant, 4 cases were in the left lower quadrant, 7 cases were on the top of the breast. All cases were invasive ductal carcinoma. According to TNM staging, 14 cases were at stageâ and 11 cases were at stageâ ¡A. The diameter of lumps were all less than 3 cm. All those lumps were solitary and without distant metastasis. The sentinel nodes were all negative. After modified radical mastectomy, the breasts were reconstructed by serratus anterior muscle flap and breast implants. The nipples were spared in 22 cases. The operation time was 113-148 minutes (mean, 136 minutes). All breasts survived and incisions healed at stageâ . There was no complication such as hematoma, infection, etc . All patients were followed up 6-18 months (mean, 15 months). Except 1 case, the others were evaluated according to the criteria of the reconstructed breast at 12 months after operation. Among them, 23 cases were evaluated as good and 1 case as fair. There was no tumor recurrence during the follow-up period. The combination of serratus anterior muscle flap and breast implants after the modified radical mastectomy is a handy approach of breast reconstruction which is less harmful with few postoperative complications. It also gains a high degree of satisfaction from patients for good breast shape.\n\nPsychological effects of breast conserving therapy in comparison with radical mastectomy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBartelink, H.; van Dam, F.; van Dongen, J.\n\n1985-02-01\n\nPsychosocial sequelae of breast conserving therapy (BCT) and radical mastectomy (RM) have been compared. Also, in the BCT group, the cosmetic results were judged by the patients themselves and two plastic surgeons. Body image in the BCT group (n = 114) was significantly more positive than in the RM group (n = 58). Patients treated with BCT had even less fear of recurrence of the cancer and would, if necessary, choose the same treatment again. Cosmetic results were good to excellent in 75% of the cases as judged by the two plastic surgeons. Most of the patients with a badmoreÂ Â» grading by the surgeons were happy with the results.Â«Â less\n\nThe appropriate number of ELNs for lymph node negative breast cancer patients underwent MRM: a population-based study.\n\nPubMed\n\nChi, Huiying; Zhang, Chenyue; Wang, Haiyong; Wang, Zhehai\n\n2017-09-12\n\nWhether number of examed lymph nodes (ELNs) would bring survival benefit for patients with negative lymph nodes after modified radical mastectomy (MRM) is uncertain. In our study, using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2009, we screened the appropriate patients with negative lymph nodes underwent MRM. The Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to determine the effect of number of ELNs on cancer specific survival (CSS). The results showed that the number of ELNs was not an independent prognostic factor on CSS ( P = 0.940). Then the X-tile mode was used to determine the appropriate threshold for ELNs count. The results showed that 9 was the appropriate cut-off point. Next, the log-rank Ï 2 test was used to analyze the CSS based on different subgroup variables. The results showed that some subgroup variables including age < 50/ â¥ 50, grade I/III, AJCC T1/T2, ER positive/negative and PR positive/negative ,demonstrated significant CSS benefits among the patients with the number of ELNs â¤ 9 (all, P < 0.05). However, three subgroup variables including grade II, AJCC T3 and AJCC T4, the patients with the number of ELNs â¤ 9 did not bring significant CSS benefits (all, P > 0.1). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the number of ELNs was not an independent prognostic factor on CSS, and 9 can be selected as the appropriate cut-off point of ELNs for patients with negative lymph nodes who underwent MRM.\n\nEffects of music therapy on anxiety of patients with breast cancer after radical mastectomy: a randomized clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Xiao-Mei; Zhou, Kai-Na; Yan, Hong; Wang, Duo-Lao; Zhang, Yin-Ping\n\n2012-05-01\n\nâ This paper is a report of a clinical trial of the effects of music therapy on anxiety of female breast cancer patients following radical mastectomy. â There is insufficient evidence on the effects of music therapy on state anxiety of breast cancer patients following radical mastectomy. â A Hall's Core, Care, and Cure Model-based clinical trial was conducted in 120 female breast cancer patients from March to November 2009. A randomized controlled design was utilized. The patients were randomly allocated to the experimental group (n = 60) received music therapy in addition to routine nursing care, and the control group (n = 60) only received routine nursing care. A standardized questionnaire and the State Anxiety Inventory were applied. The primary endpoint was the state anxiety score measured at pretest (on the day before radical mastectomy) and at three post-tests (on the day before patients were discharged from hospital, the second and third time of admission to hospital for chemotherapy respectively). â The pretest score revealed that the majority of the patients had a moderate level (77Â·5%) and 15% had severe level of state anxiety. The repeated-measure ancova model analysis indicated that the mean state anxiety score was significantly lower in the experimental group than those in the control group at each of the three post-test measurements. The mean difference between the experimental and control group together with 95% confidence intervals were -4Â·57 (-6Â·33, -2Â·82), -8Â·91 (-10Â·75, -7Â·08) and -9Â·69 (-11Â·52, -7Â·85) at the 1st post-test, 2nd post-test and 3rd post-test respectively. â Music therapy is found to have positive effects on decreasing state anxiety score.

The present study was planned to compare the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided PecS II block with thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) for postoperative analgesia after modified radical mastectomy. Forty adult female patients undergoing radical mastectomy were randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1 patients received a TPVB with ropivacaine 0.5%, 25 ml, whereas Group 2 patents received a PecS II block using same volume of ropivacaine 0.5% before induction of anaesthesia. Patient-controlled morphine analgesia was used for postoperative pain relief. The duration of analgesia was significantly prolonged in patients receiving the PecS II block compared with TPVB [mean (sd), 294.5 (52.76) vs 197.5 (31.35) min in the PecS II and TPVB group, respectively; P<0.0001]. The 24 h morphine consumption was also less in the PecS II block group [mean (sd), 3.90 (0.79) vs 5.30 (0.98) mg in PecS II and TPVB group, respectively; P<0.0001]. Postoperative pain scores were lower in the PecS II group compared with the TVPB group in the initial 2 h after surgery [median (IQR), 2 (2-2.5) vs 4 (3-4) in the Pecs II and TPVB group, respectively; P<0.0001]. Seventeen patients in the PecS II block group had T2 dermatomal spread compared with four patients in the TPVB group (P<0.001). No block-related complication was recorded. We found that the PecS II block provided superior postoperative analgesia than the TPVB in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy without causing any adverse effect. CTRI/2014/06/004692.

Recent studies however, have suggested that these randomized clinical trials findings may not be representative of the entire population or the nature of current patient care. A retrospective analysis of female invasive breast cancer patients who underwent surgery in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1990-2003) was performed. Survival was compared amongst women who underwent partial mastectomy, partial mastectomy plus radiation (PMR), or MRM. Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to investigate the impact of method of treatment upon survival, after adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics. A total of 218,043 patients, mean age 62 years, were identified. MRM accounted for 51.5 per cent of the study population whereas PMR accounted for 34.9 per cent. On multivariate analyses, significant improvement was observed in patient survival associated with PMR when compared with MRM patients (hazard ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval = 0.67-0.74, P < 0.001). This population-based study suggests that there is a survival benefit for women undergoing PMR in the treatment of breast cancer.\n\nHarmonic scalpel versus electrocautery dissection in modified radical mastectomy: a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Salma; Khan, Shaista; Chawla, Tabish; Murtaza, Ghulam\n\n2014-03-01\n\nTo test the hypothesis that the use of a harmonic scalpel increases operative time but results in less estimated blood loss, postoperative pain, drainage volume, and duration of surgery, as well as fewer complications, such as flap necrosis, seroma, and surgical site infection (SSI), than electrocautery. This parallel-group, single-institution blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at the department of surgery of our institute between April 2010 and July 2011. Women undergoing modified radical mastectomy were randomly allocated to either harmonic dissection (n = 76) or electrocautery (n = 76). Both the groups were comparable for baseline variables with age of 50.5 Â± 12.2 and 48.5 Â± 14.5 years in the harmonic and electrocautery groups, respectively. Harmonic dissection yielded better outcomes compared to electrocautery with lower estimated blood loss (100 Â± 62 vs. 182 Â± 92, p < 0.001), less drain volume (631 Â± 275 ml vs. 1035 Â± 413 ml, p < 0.001), fewer drain days (12 Â± 3 vs. 17 Â± 4, p < 0.001), less seroma formation (21.3 vs. 33.3 %, p = 0.071), and less postoperative pain [median (interquartile range) 2 (2-2) vs. 3 (3-4), p < 0.001], whereas mean operative time (191 Â± 44 vs. 187 Â± 36 min, p = 0.49) and SSI (0 vs. 4 %, p = 0.122) did not differ. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, harmonic dissection was associated with lower risk of significant postoperative pain [adjusted relative risk 0.028 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.004-0.2)] and overall complications [adjusted relative risk 0.47, (95 % CI 0.26-0.86)]. On multiple linear regression, duration of drains in the harmonic dissection group was 4.5 days less than electrocautery (r2 = 0.28, Î² = 11.8, p < 0.001). The harmonic scalpel significantly reduces postoperative discomfort and morbidity to the patient without increasing operating time. We thus recommend preferential use of harmonic dissection in modified radical mastectomy.

The aim of this study was to analyze the costs and the efficiency of use of continuous infusion of levobupivacaine 0.5 % with the help of an infusion pump in modified radical mastectomy. A cost calculation of the analgesic procedures (continuous infusion of levobupivacaine 0.5 % [levobupivacaine group (LG)] or saline [saline group (SG)] (2 ml/h 48 h) has been carried out based on the data of a previous clinical trial (double-blind randomized study) of patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy surgery. The measure of the effectiveness was the point reduction of pain derived from the verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS). The usual incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was performed. Considering only the intravenous analgesia, overall costs were lower in LG, as less analgesia was used (EUR14.06 Â± 7.89 vs. 27.47 Â± 14.79; p < 0.001). In this study the costs of the infusion pump were not calculated as it was used by both groups and they offset each other. However, if the infusion pump costs were included, costs would be higher in the LG, (EUR91.89 Â± 7.89 vs. 27.47 Â± 14.79; p < 0.001) and then the ICER was -8.51, meaning that for every extra point of decrease in the pain verbal numerical rating score over the 2-day period, the cost increased by EUR8.51. Infiltration of local anesthetics is an effective technique for controlling postoperative pain and the associated added costs are relatively low in relation to the total cost of mastectomy, therefore providing patients with a higher quality of care in the prevention of pain. clinicaltrials.gov: reference number NCT01389934. http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01389934\n\nEffect Of Preoperative Intravenous Steroids On Seroma Formation After Modified Radical Mastectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Maryam Alam\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWith the steep increase in breast cancer incidence globally and regionally, there has been a trend toward reducing patient morbidity by meticulous surgical techniques to obviate complications like seroma formation; use to pre-operative steroids seems to be convenient, cost effective and shows promising results in trials. This randomized clinical trial was conducted at Surgical Department of Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar, from January 2012 to April 2014 on 65 patients randomly allocated to Group A and Group B using lottery method. Group A underwent MRM+AD in the conventional manner while Group B received a 120 mg of injection Depomedrol intravenously 1 hour before the surgery. The two were compared in terms of total drainage, days of drainage, wound complications and incidence of seroma. Data was entered and analysed using statistical program SPSS-21. The mean age in group A was 34.2Â±10.1 years and B was 32.3Â±9.1 years. The mean drainage in intervention group was significantly reduced as compared to control group (755.4Â±65ml vs 928.3Â±102.5). Total drainage days were reduced (6.5Â±1.6 days vs 10.2Â±2.2 days) and incidence of seroma was also reduced (A=18.75% vs B=6.06%). However, three patients in group B had wound infection. Seroma formation is the most common complication of Mastectomy and among the methods used to reduce its incidence, steroid administration seems to be the most cost effective and shows promising results.\n\nClinical application of 3D-printed-step-bolus in post-total-mastectomy electron conformal therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Kwangwoo; Park, Sungjin; Jeon, Mi-Jin; Choi, Jinhyun; Kim, Jun Won; Cho, Yoon Jin; Jang, Won-Seok; Keum, Yo Sup; Lee, Ik Jae\n\n2017-04-11\n\nThe 3D-printed boluses were used during the radiation therapy of the chest wall in six patients with breast cancer after modified radical mastectomy (MRM). We measured the in-vivo skin doses while both conventional and 3D-printed boluses were placed on the chest wall and compared the mean doses delivered to the ipsilateral lung and the heart. The homogeneity and conformity of the dose distribution in the chest wall for both types of boluses were also evaluated. The uniformity index on the chest skin was improved when the 3D-printed boluses were used, with the overall average skin dose being closer to the prescribed one in the former case (-0.47% versus -4.43%). On comparing the dose-volume histogram (DVH), it was found that the 3D-printed boluses resulted in a reduction in the mean dose to the ipsilateral lung by up to 20%. The precision of dose delivery was improved by 3% with the 3D-printed boluses; in contrast, the conventional step bolus resulted in a precision level of 5%. In conclusion, the use of the 3D-printed boluses resulted in better dose homogeneity and conformity to the chest wall as well as the sparing of the normal organs, especially the lung. This suggested that their routine use on the chest wall as a therapeutic approach during post-mastectomy radiation therapy offers numerous advantages over conventional step boluses.\n\nClinical application of 3D-printed-step-bolus in post-total-mastectomy electron conformal therapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPark, Kwangwoo; Park, Sungjin; Jeon, Mi-Jin; Choi, Jinhyun; Kim, Jun Won; Cho, Yoon Jin; Jang, Won-Seok; Keum, Yo Sup; Lee, Ik Jae\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe 3D-printed boluses were used during the radiation therapy of the chest wall in six patients with breast cancer after modified radical mastectomy (MRM).

During 1998 this research program has used new and existing data to create an important tool for the development and improvement of \"maintenance resource management\" (MRM). Thousands of surveys completed by participants in airline MRM training and/or behavior change programs have, for the first time, been consolidated into a panel of \"MRM Attitudes and Opinion Profiles.\" These profiles can be used to compare the attitudes about decision making and communication in any given company at any stage in its MRM program with attitudes of a large sample of like employees during a similar period in their MRM involvement. This panel of comparison profiles for attitudes and opinions is a tool to help audit the effectiveness of a maintenance human factors program. The profile panel is the first of several tools envisioned for applying the information accumulating in MRM databases produced as one of the program's long range objectives.\n\nPrognostic Value of Molecular Subtypes, Ki67 Expression and Impact of Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients With Negative Lymph Nodes After Mastectomy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSelz, Jessica, E-mail: chaumontjessica@yahoo.fr; Stevens, Denise; Jouanneau, Ludivine\n\n2012-12-01\n\nPurpose: To determine whether Ki67 expression and breast cancer subtypes could predict locoregional recurrence (LRR) and influence the postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) decision in breast cancer (BC) patients with pathologic negative lymph nodes (pN0) after modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Methods and Materials: A total of 699 BC patients with pN0 status after MRM, treated between 2001 and 2008, were identified from a prospective database in a single institution. Tumors were classified by intrinsic molecular subtype as luminal A or B, HER2+, and triple-negative (TN) using estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. Multivariate Cox analysis was used to determine the risk of LRRmoreÂ Â» associated with intrinsic subtypes and Ki67 expression, adjusting for known prognostic factors. Results: At a median follow-up of 56 months, 17 patients developed LRR. Five-year LRR-free survival and overall survival in the entire population were 97%, and 94.7%, respectively, with no difference between the PMRT (n=191) and no-PMRT (n=508) subgroups. No constructed subtype was associated with an increased risk of LRR. Ki67 >20% was the only independent prognostic factor associated with increased LRR (hazard ratio, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.11-15.77; P<.0215). However, PMRT was not associated with better locoregional control in patients with proliferative tumors. Conclusions: Ki67 expression but not molecular subtypes are predictors of locoregional recurrence in breast cancer patients with negative lymph nodes after MRM. The benefit of adjuvant RT in patients with proliferative tumors should be further investigated in prospective studies.Â«Â less\n\nHigh Throughput Protein Quantitation using MRM Viewer Software and Dynamic MRM on a Triple Quadruple Mass Spectrometer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiller, C.; Waddell, K.; Tang, N.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRP-122 Peptide quantitation using Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) has been established as an important methodology for biomarker verification andvalidation.This requires high throughput combined with high sensitivity to analyze potentially thousands of target peptides in each sample.Dynamic MRM allows the system to only acquire the required MRMs of the peptide during a retention window corresponding to when each peptide is eluting. This reduces the number of concurrent MRM and therefore improves quantitation and sensitivity. MRM Selector allows the user to generate an MRM transition list with retention time information from discovery data obtained on a QTOF MS system.This list can be directly imported into the triple quadrupole acquisition software.However, situations can exist where a) the list of MRMs contain an excess of MRM transitions allowable under the ideal acquisition conditions chosen ( allowing for cycle time and chromatography conditions), or b) too many transitions in a certain retention time region which would result in an unacceptably low dwell time and cycle time.A new tool - MRM viewer has been developed to help users automatically generate multiple dynamic MRM methods from a single MRM list.In this study, a list of 3293 MRM transitions from a human plasma sample was compiled.A single dynamic MRM method with 3293 transitions results in a minimum dwell time of 2.18ms.Using MRM viewer we can generate three dynamic MRM methods with a minimum dwell time of 20ms which can give a better quality MRM quantitation.This tool facilitates both high throughput and high sensitivity for MRM quantitation.\n\nHalf versus full vacuum suction drainage after modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer- a prospective randomized clinical trial[ISRCTN24484328\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChintamani; Singhal, Vinay; Singh, JP; Bansal, Anju; Saxena, Sunita\n\n2005-01-01\n\nBackground Suction drains are routinely used after modified radical mastectomy and are an important factor contributing to increased hospital stay as the patients are often discharged only after their removal. Amongst various factors that influence the amount of postoperative drainage, the negative suction pressure applied to the drain has been reported to be of great significance. While a high negative suction pressure is expected to drain the collection and reduce the dead space promptly, it may also prevent the leaking lymphatics from closing and lead to increased drainage from the wound. Against this background a prospective randomized clinical study was conducted to compare the amount and duration of drainage between a half negative suction and full vacuum suction drainage in patients following modified radical mastectomy. The associated postoperative morbidity was also compared between the two groups. Methods 85 FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) proven cases of locally advanced breast cancer were randomized. (Using randomly ordered sealed envelops, which were opened immediately before the closure of the wound) in to 50 patients with full vacuum suction (pressure = 700 g/m2) and 35 cases in to half vacuum suction drainage (pressure = 350 g/m2) groups. The two groups were comparable in respect of age, weight, and technique of operation and extent of axillary dissection. Surgery was performed by the same surgical team comprising of five surgeons (two senior and three resident surgeons) using a standardized technique with electrocautery. External compression dressing was provided over the axilla for first 48 hrs and following that patients were encouraged to do active and passive shoulder exercises. The outcomes measured were postoperative morbidity and the length of hospital stay. Statistical methods used: Descriptive studies were performed with SPSS version 10 and group characteristics were compared using student t-test.

A total of 170 patients were randomly allocated to the intervention group (n = 85) receiving music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training plus routine nursing care and the control group (n = 85) receiving routine nursing care. Music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training were performed twice a day within 48 h after radical mastectomy, once in the early morning (6a.m.-8a.m.) and once in the evening (9p.m.-11p.m.), for 30 min per session until discharged from the hospital. A general linear model with univariate analysis showed that the intervention group patients had significant improvement in depression and anxiety in the effects of group (F = 20.31, P < 0.001; F = 5.41, P = 0.017), time (F = 56.64, P < 0.001; F = 155.17, P < 0.001) and group*time interaction (F = 6.91, P = 0.009; F = 5.56, P = 0.019). The intervention group patients had shorter length of hospital stay (12.56 Â± 1.03) than that of the control group (17.01 Â± 2.46) with statistical significance (F = 13.36, P < 0.001). Music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training can reduce depression, anxiety and length of hospital stay in female breast cancer patients after radical mastectomy.

There has been a major shift toward less-invasive local treatments, from radical mastectomy to breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and oncoplastic breast surgery (OBS). In order to investigate the efficacy of each of the three abovementioned methods, a literature review was conducted for measurable outcomes including local recurrence, survival, cosmetic outcome, quality of life (QOL), and health economy. From the point of view of oncological result, there is no difference between mastectomy and BCT in local recurrence rate and survival. Long-term results for OBS are not available. The items assessed in the QOL sound a better score for OBS in comparison with mastectomy or BCT. OBS is also associated with a better cosmetic outcome. Although having low income seems to be associated with lower BCT and OBS utilization, prognosis of breast cancer is worse in these women as well. Thus, health economy is the matter that should be studied seriously. OBS is an innovative, progressive, and complicated subspeciality that lacks published randomized clinical trials comparing surgical techniques and objective measures of outcome, especially from oncologic and health economy points of view.

Borrowed from stable-isotope dilution (SID) methodologies in the field of small molecules, MRM is now routinely used in proteomics laboratories. While its usefulness validating candidate targets is widely accepted, it has not been established as a discovery tool. Traditional thinking has been that MRM workflows cannot be multiplexed high enough to efficiently profile. This is due to slower instrument scan rates and the complexities of developing increasingly large scheduling methods. In this issue, Colangelo etÂ al. (Proteomics 2015, 15, 1202-1214) describe a pipeline (xMRM) for discovery-style MRM using label-free methods (i.e. relative quantitation). Label-free comes with cost benefits as does MRM, where data are easier to analyze than full-scan. Their paper offers numerous improvements in method design and data analysis. The robustness of their pipeline was tested on rodent postsynaptic density fractions. There, they were able to accurately quantify 112 proteins at a CV% of 11.4, with only 2.5% of the 1697 transitions requiring user intervention. Colangelo etÂ al. aim to extend the reach of MRM deeper into the realm of discovery proteomics, an area that is currently dominated by data-dependent and data-independent workflows.

MRM carried out on a low-resolution triple quadrupole instrument faces a lack of specificity when addressing the quantification of weakly concentrated proteins. In this case, extensive sample fractionation or immunoenrichment alleviates signal contamination by interferences, but in turn decreases assay performance and throughput. Recently, MRM(3) was introduced as an alternative to MRM to improve the limit of quantification of weakly concentrated protein biomarkers. In the present work, we compare MRM and MRM(3) modes for the detection of biomarkers in plasma and urine. Calibration curves drawn with MRM and MRM(3) showed a similar range of linearity (R(2)â>â0.99 for both methods) with protein concentrations above 1 Î¼g/mL in plasma and a few nanogram per milliliter in urine. In contrast, optimized MRM(3) methods improve the limits of quantification by a factor of 2 to 4 depending on the targeted peptide. This gain arises from the additional MS(3) fragmentation step, which significantly removes or decreases interfering signals within the targeted transition channels.\n\nMastectomy - discharge\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

This study included 246 patients who received modified radical mastectomy. The patients were scanned with computed tomography, and the chest wall (with or without the internal mammary lymph nodes) and supraclavicular region were delineated. For 143 patients, the chest wall and supraclavicular region were combined as an integrated planning volume and treated with IMRT. For 103 patients, conventional treatments were employed with 2 tangential fields for the chest wall, abutting a mixed fieldmoreÂ Â» of 6-MV x-rays (16 Gy) and 9-MeV electrons (34 Gy) for the upper supraclavicular region. The common prescription dose was 50 Gy/25 Fx/5 W to 90% of the target volume. The dosimetric characteristics of the chest wall, the supraclavicular region, and normal organs were compared. For the chest wall target, compared with conventional treatments, the integrated IMRT plans lowered the maximum dose, increased the minimum dose, and resulted in better conformity and uniformity of the target volume. There was an increase in minimum, average, and 95% prescription dose for the integrated IMRT plans in the supraclavicular region, and conformity and uniformity were improved. The V{sub 30} of the ipsilateral lung and V{sub 10}, V{sub 30}, and mean dose of the heart on the integrated IMRT plans were lower than those of the conventional plans. The V{sub 5} and V{sub 10} of the ipsilateral lung and V{sub 5} of the heart were higher on the integrated IMRT plans (p < 0.05) than on conventional plans. Without an increase in the radiation dose to organs at risk, the integrated IMRT treatment plans improved the dose distribution of the supraclavicular region and showed better dose conformity and uniformity of the integrated target volume of the chest wall and supraclavicular region.Â«Â less\n\nBreast Cancer Surgery: Comparing Surgical Groups and Determining Individual Differences in Postoperative Sexuality and Body Change Stress\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYurek, Debora; Farrar, William; Andersen, Barbara L.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWomen diagnosed and surgically treated for regional breast cancer (N = 190) were studied to determine the sexual and body change sequelae for women receiving modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with breast reconstruction in comparison with the sequelae for women receiving breast-conserving therapy (BCT) or MRM without breast reconstruction. The sexuality pattern for women receiving reconstructive surgery was one that was significantly differentâwith lower rates of activity and fewer signs of sexual responsivenessâthan that for women in either of the other groups. Significantly higher levels of traumatic stress and situational distress regarding the breast changes were reported by the women receiving an MRM in contrast to the women treated with BCT. Using a model to predict sexual morbidity, regression analyses revealed that individual differences in sexual self-schema were related to both sexual and body change stress outcomes.

Methods: We created 2 sets of IMRT plans based on PTV0.5 and PTV0.7 (with CTV displacement of 0.5cm and 0.7cm respectively) for each of the ten consecutive left-sided breast cancer patients after modified radical mastectomy, and compared the difference in PTV coverage and organ at risk (OAR) sparing between the two groups. And then, we compared the difference in PTV coverage in IMRT plans based on PTV0.5 between the group with properlymoreÂ Â» estimated CTV displacement (presuming the actual CTV displacement was 0.5cm) and the one with underestimated CTV displacement (presuming the actual CTV displacement was 0.7cm). The difference in results between the corresponding two groups was compared using paired-sample t-test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: IMRT plans derived from PTV0.5 had more homogenous PTV coverage, and less heart, left lung, right breast, right lung, left humeral head and B-P radiation exposure, as well as less total Mu as compared with the ones stemmed from PTV0.7 (all p<0.05). IMRT plans with appropriate estimation of CTV displacement had better PTV coverage compared with the ones with underestimated CTV displacement (all p<0.01). Conclusion: The IMRT plans with smaller CTV displacement in post modified radical mastectomy radiotherapy for left-sided breast cancer has dosimetrical advantages over the ones with larger CTV displacement. Underestimation of CTV displacement can lead to significant reduction of PTV coverage. Individually quantifying and minimizing CTV displacement can significantly improve PTV coverage and OAR (including heart and left lung) sparing.

Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) or selective reaction monitoring (SRM) is a highly selective, sensitive, and robust assay to monitor the presence and amount of biomolecules. Until recently, MRM was typically used for the detection of drugs and other biomolecules from body fluids. With increased focus on biomarkers and systems biology approaches, researchers in the proteomics field have taken advantage of this approach. In this chapter, we will introduce the reader to the basic principle of designing and optimizing an MRM workflow. We provide examples of MRM workflows for standard proteomic samples and provide suggestions for the reader who is interested in using MRM for quantification.\n\nPredictors for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in breast cancer patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFu, Yun; Zhuang, Zhigang; Dewing, Michelle; Apple, Sophia; Chang, Helena\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: In recent years, radical breast cancer surgery has been largely replaced by breast conservation treatment, due to early diagnosis and more effective adjuvant treatment. While breast conservation is mostly preferred, the trend of bilateral mastectomy has risen in the United States. The aim of this study is to determine factors influencing patientsâ choice for having contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). Methods: This is a retrospective study of 373 patients diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer who were treated by bilateral or unilateral mastectomy (BM or UM) at the Revlon/UCLA Breast Center between Jan. 2002 and Dec. 2010. In the BM group, only those with unilateral breast cancer who chose CPM were included in the analysis. Results: When compared with the UM group, the following factors were found to be associated with BM: younger age, pre-menopausal, a family history of breast/ovarian cancer, BRCA mutation, more breast biopsies, history of breast augmentation, having MRI study within 6 months before the surgery, more likely to have reconstruction and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and fewer had neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy/radiation. When patients with bilateral breast cancer were excluded, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated younger patients with negative nodes, SLNB as the only nodal surgery and positive family history were significant factors predicting CPM and immediate reconstruction using tissue expanders or implants. Conclusion: Younger age, lower TN stage, requiring only SLNB and high risk family history predict contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Tissue expander/implant-based reconstructions were more frequently chosen by patients with BM.

Eight-year follow-up.\n\nPubMed\n\nSklaroff, R B; Sklaroff, D M\n\n1976-07-01\n\nSixty-four women with Stage II breast cancer who had Sr85 bone scans at the time of radical mastectomy were followed for 8 years in a prospective study. Those women with positive scans had a slight, but statistically significant, increased incidence of metastic disease, particularly for metastases to bone.However, 40% of those women with positive bone scans and negative roentgenograms survived 8 years without evidence of any metastatic disease. Therefore, it has not been shown at this time that bone scans should be obtained in order to exclude bone metastasis before regional therapy for breast cancer is instituted. Also, a significant percentage of women with negative bone scans developed both bone and soft tissue metastases. As many as 30% of asymptomatic women with a history of breast cancer and positive bone scans and negative bone roentgenograms may still harbor disease in bone after 8 years.\n\nMale breast cancer: 20-year survival data for post-mastectomy radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nEggemann, Holm; Ignatov, Atanas; Stabenow, Roland; von Minckwitz, Gunter; RÃ¶hl, Friedrich Wilhelm; Hass, Peter; Costa, Serban-Dan\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe goal of this population-based study was to determine the impact of post-mastectomy radiation therapy on long-term overall survival (OS) of male patients with breast cancer. We investigated 20-year OS rates of 664 patients diagnosed with primary stage I-III breast cancer in former East Germany between 1970 and 1989. Patients had a radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection without systemic adjuvant therapy. Median follow-up time was 26.2 years (range 19-38 years). 52.4% of the patients had post-mastectomy radiotherapy. Radiotherapy showed different effects in each stage group after 20 years. Whereas there was an OS trend for radiotherapy to harm patients with stage I disease (hazard ratio (HR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-2.15; p = 0.065), radiotherapy showed no benefit in patients with stage II disease (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.62-1.1; p = 0.15). There was a significant survival benefit for patients with stage III disease receiving radiotherapy (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41-0.88; p = 0.008). Post-mastectomy radiotherapy is associated with longer OS in male patients with stage III breast cancer. Male breast cancer patients at stages I and II do not seem to benefit from radiotherapy, but obsolete irradiation techniques might explain adverse long-term effects in earlier stages.\n\nBody image disturbance and surgical decision making in egyptian post menopausal breast cancer patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShoma, Ashraf M; Mohamed, Madiha H; Nouman, Nashaat; Amin, Mahmoud; Ibrahim, Ibtihal M; Tobar, Salwa S; Gaffar, Hanan E; Aboelez, Warda F; Ali, Salwa E; William, Soheir G\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground In most developing countries, as in Egypt; postmenopausal breast cancer cases are offered a radical form of surgery relying on their unawareness of the subsequent body image disturbance. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of breast cancer surgical choice; Breast Conservative Therapy (BCT) versus Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM); on body image perception among Egyptian postmenopausal cases. Methods One hundred postmenopausal women with breast cancer were divided into 2 groups, one group underwent BCT and the other underwent MRM. Pre- and post-operative assessments of body image distress were done using four scales; Breast Impact of Treatment Scale (BITS), Impact of Event Scale (IES), Situational Discomfort Scale (SDS), and Body Satisfaction Scale (BSS). Results Preoperative assessment showed no statistical significant difference regarding cognitive, affective, behavioral and evaluative components of body image between both studied groups. While in postoperative assessment, women in MRM group showed higher levels of body image distress among cognitive, affective and behavioral aspects. Conclusion Body image is an important factor for postmenopausal women with breast cancer in developing countries where that concept is widely ignored. We should not deprive those cases from their right of less mutilating option of treatment as BCT.

Fifty-five patients who had undergone mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection between June 2009 and January 2010 were included in this study. The patients were informed by a trainer nurse about the precautions they should take to prevent the development of lymphedema. The patients were also trained for the appropriate exercises and were given written educational material prepared by the investigators. Among the participants, 96.4% underwent modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and 3.6% breast-conserving (BCS) surgery. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 9.87 Â± 17.55 months. The degree of lymphedema was found lower, even within 6 months, in the patients that exercised as compared to the patients that did not (p<0.05). The results indicate that the risk of development and progression of mastectomy-related lymphedema was reduced with education and exercise provided by trained nurses at an early stage.\n\nData Pre-Processing for Label-Free Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) Experiments\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChung, Lisa M.; Colangelo, Christopher M.; Zhao, Hongyu\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMultiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) conducted on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer allows researchers to quantify the expression levels of a set of target proteins.

A randomized, double-blind, prospective study. Academic medical center. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov under number: (NCT02620371) after approval by the ethics committee of South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assuit University, Assuit, Egypt. Sixty patients aged 18 - 60 years scheduled for modified radical mastectomy were enrolled and randomly assigned into 2 groups (30 patients each): Control group patients were given ultrasound-guided, Pecs block with 30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine only. Ketamine group patients were given ultrasound-guided, Pecs block with 30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine plus ketamine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg). Patients were followed up for 48 hours postoperatively for vital signs, VAS score, first request of rescue analgesia and total morphine consumption, sedation score, and side effects. Ketamine plus bupivacaine in Pecs block compared to bupivacaine alone prolonged the mean time of first request of analgesia (18.25 Â± 1.98), (12.56 Â± 2.64), respectively (P < 0.001), reduced total morphine consumption (12.50 Â± 4.63), (18.86 Â± 6.28), respectively (P = 0.016). With no significant difference in hemodynamics, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, VAS and sedation scores, and side effects observed between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). This study is limited by its sample size. The addition of ketamine to modified Pecs block prolonged the time to first request of analgesia and reduced total opioid consumption without serious side effects in patients who underwent a modified radical mastectomy.

Most men are currently treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM) or simple mastectomy (SM). We compared the oncologic treatment outcomes of early-stage MBC to determine whether breast conservation therapy (BCT) is appropriate. We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for MBC cases. That cohort was narrowed to cases of stage I-II, T1-T2N0 MBC with surgical and radiation therapy (RT) data available. The patients had undergone MRM, SM, or breast conservation surgery (BCS) with or without postoperative RT. We calculated the actuarial 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS). We identified 6263 MBC cases and included 1777 men with stage I or II, T1-T2, node-negative disease, who had the required treatment information available. MRM without RT was the most common treatment (43%). Only 17% underwent BCS. Of the BCS patients, 46% received adjuvant RT to complete the traditional BCT. No deaths were recorded in the BCT group, regardless of stage, or in the 3 stage I surgical groups if the men had received RT. The actuarial 5-year CSS was 100% in each BCT group. MRM alone resulted in an actuarial 5-year CSS of 97.3% for stage 1% and 91.2% for stage 2. The results from our study suggest that BCT for early-stage MBC yields comparable survival compared with more invasive treatment modalities (ie, MRM or SM alone). This could shift the treatment paradigm to less-invasive interventions and might have the added benefit of increased functional and psychological outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our conclusions. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We developed a specific questionnaire and compared two groups of women who underwent radical mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR). Between 2004 and 2006, 310 women with NAC preservation and 143 patients with successive NAC reconstruction were mailed the questionnaire at follow-up 1 year after definitive complete breast reconstruction surgery. 256 questionnaires was available. Our results showed significant differences in favour of the NAC sparing group regarding body image (difficulty in looking at themselves naked and being seen naked by their partners after surgery, P = 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively); regarding satisfaction with the appearance of the nipple (P < .0001) and with the sensitivity of the nipple (P = 0.001); regarding the feeling of mutilation (P = 0.003).

The strengthening of the robustness of discovery technologies, particularly in mass spectrometry, has been followed by intense discussions on establishing well-defined evaluation procedures for the identified targets to ultimately allow the clinical validation and then the clinical use of some of these biomarkers. Some of the obstacles to the evaluation process have been the lack of the availability of quick and easy-to-develop, easy-to-use, robust, specific and sensitive alternative quantitative methods when immunoaffinity-based tests are unavailable. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM; also called selected reaction monitoring) is currently proving its capabilities as a complementary or alternative technique to ELISA for large biomarker panel evaluation. Here, we present how MRM(3) can overcome the lack of specificity and sensitivity often encountered by MRM when tracking minor proteins diluted by complex biological matrices.\n\nSex Therapy and Mastectomy\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWitkin, Mildred Hope\n\n1975-01-01\n\nBecause the emotional trauma associated with a mastectomy exceeds the physical trauma, the recovery of the woman is greatly affected by the response of her husband or lover. Sex therapy, therefore, involves the couple. The approach described is aimed at assisting the couple to confront and integrate the mastectomy experience.

Named Rassvet, Russian for \"dawn,\" the module is the second in a series of new pressurized components for Russia. Rassvet will be used for cargo storage and will provide an additional docking port to the station.\n\nDevelopment of MRM-based assays for the absolute quantitation of plasma proteins.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuzyk, Michael A; Parker, Carol E; Domanski, Dominik; Borchers, Christoph H\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMultiple reaction monitoring (MRM), sometimes called selected reaction monitoring (SRM), is a directed tandem mass spectrometric technique performed on to triple quadrupole mass spectrometers. MRM assays can be used to sensitively and specifically quantify proteins based on peptides that are specific to the target protein. Stable-isotope-labeled standard peptide analogues (SIS peptides) of target peptides are added to enzymatic digests of samples, and quantified along with the native peptides during MRM analysis. Monitoring of the intact peptide and a collision-induced fragment of this peptide (an ion pair) can be used to provide information on the absolute peptide concentration of the peptide in the sample and, by inference, the concentration of the intact protein. This technique provides high specificity by selecting for biophysical parameters that are unique to the target peptides: (1) the molecular weight of the peptide, (2) the generation of a specific fragment from the peptide, and (3) the HPLC retention time during LC/MRM-MS analysis. MRM is a highly sensitive technique that has been shown to be capable of detecting attomole levels of target peptides in complex samples such as tryptic digests of human plasma. This chapter provides a detailed description of how to develop and use an MRM protein assay. It includes sections on the critical \"first step\" of selecting the target peptides, as well as optimization of MRM acquisition parameters for maximum sensitivity of the ion pairs that will be used in the final method, and characterization of the final MRM assay.\n\nLifetime Costs of Prophylactic Mastectomies and Reconstruction versus Surveillance.\n\nPubMed\n\nMattos, David; Gfrerer, Lisa; Reish, Richard G; Hughes, Kevin S; Cetrulo, Curtis; Colwell, Amy S; Winograd, Jonathan M; Yaremchuk, Michael J; Austen, William G; Liao, Eric C\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe past decade has seen an increasing prevalence of prophylactic mastectomy with decreasing ages of patients treated for breast cancer. Data are limited on the fiscal impacts of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy trends, and no study has compared bilateral prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction to surveillance in high-risk patients. Lifetime third-party payer costs over 30 years were estimated with 2013 Medicare reimbursement rates. Costs were estimated for patients choosing contralateral or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy versus surveillance, with immediate reconstructions using a single-stage implant, tissue expander, or perforator-based free flap approach. Published cancer incidence rates predicted the percentage of surveillance patients that would require mastectomies. Sensitivity analyses were conducted that varied cost growth, discount rate, cancer incidence rate, and other variables. Lifetime costs and present values (3 percent discount rate) were estimated. Lifetime prophylactic mastectomy costs were lower than surveillance costs, $1292 to $1993 lower for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy and $15,668 to $21,342 lower for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, depending on the reconstruction. Present value estimates were slightly higher for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy over contralateral surveillance but still cost saving for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy compared with bilateral surveillance. Present value estimates are also cost saving for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy when the modeled contralateral breast cancer incidence rate is increased to at least 0.6 percent per year. These findings are consistent with contralateral and bilateral prophylactic mastectomy being cost saving in many scenarios, regardless of the reconstructive option chosen. They suggest that physicians and patients should continue to receive flexibility in deciding how best to proceed clinically in each case.\n\nPectoralis-serratus interfascial plane block vs thoracic paravertebral block for unilateral radical mastectomy with axillary evacuation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHetta, Diab Fuad; Rezk, Khalid Mohammed\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of pectoralis-serratus interfascial plane block in comparison with thoracic paravertebral block for postmastectomy pain.
