He could ride, rope, tackle, plow, and fix just about anything. Along with his family, he had a well-earned reputation for hard work and honesty. His friends always joked that John was an ‘acquired taste’ and once acquired, was hard to give up. He laughed the loudest and found humor in the most inappropriate matters, which, of course, made him all the more endearing. John had a strong sense of duty to God, family, friends and community. Far from standing on the sidelines, he invested time working for the common good. Thank God for the life of John Birdwell. Heaven is a little louder filled with John’s laughter.

His life story was about devotion to family, about international understanding, and a passion for public service. Born July 7, 1952 in Arlington, Virginia, Charles was born into a family of leaders. His father was a senior U.S. Army officer, and Charles grew up in Hawaii, Berlin, and on bases across America. He attended New Mexico Military Institute, and attended Princeton University–both of which built in him a lifelong appetite for reading and learning. From college Charles served on the staff of U.S. Senator Philip Hart of Michigan, and advanced to a position with the White House Press Office in President Carter’s Administration. He moved to private public relations work with the Pat Bario firm in Washington, DC. A new chapter opened in his life when he moved to Spokane to marry Rose Harvey, and they enjoyed almost 27 years of living and raising a family in Spokane. Charles began working at Ambassador Programs in Spokane in 1982, where he used his considerable skills around the world as Director of Operations for the People to People Citizen Ambassador Programs. His travels took him regularly to Russia, South Africa, South America, China, Mongolia, India, Nepal and Europe. He was also involved in the selection of Jilin, China, as a Sister City to Spokane. His finest hour with People to People was as ‘the last man out’ in the People’s Republic of China immediately following the Tiananmen Square incident. In a tense atmosphere where tanks were parked in front of his hotel and troops had locked down Beijing, Charles showed great courage. He personally negotiated with officials and supervised the safe return of several hundred professionals back to the US, gaining the gratitude of families across the country. In 1997, Charles took early retirement to enjoy life with his family. He loved traveling, reading history and current affairs, and was a consummate host. To stay involved with his daughter’s school, he served as President of St. George’s School Parent Association. A lifelong Democrat with personal experience in the White House, he was proud of President Obama’s election and its statement to the world about America. He is survived by his wife, Rose; son Steven of Merced, CA; and daughter Christjana, Spokane; his mother, Christjane (Kiki) Thom Goodwin; his brother, Samuel “Mac” Goodwin and his wife Geri, Revere, MA; his brother Peter B.

He also loved traveling and playing bridge with his great friends Jim and Jonelle Bellis and hosting receptions and dinners with dear friends. The world has lost a true gentleman—soft-spoken, gracious, and humble—but with the heart of a lion when it came to serving his fellow man.\n\nGraham, Edward D. 1970 HS ~ 01-Apr-2002\n\nGray, Charles W. “Bill” 1970 HS , age 51, of Clinton, Mich., lost his long, courageous battle with pancreatic cancer on Sept. 26, 2003.

Kimball was born to Earl and Carol Jensen in Fort Ord, CA on October 4, 1951. He married Brenda Lynn Jensen (Williams) on September 3, 1972. Together, they enjoyed a life of travel, children, and grandchildren. As a small child, Kimball traveled extensively with his parents and first three sisters, Kristina, Judy, and Tamara. His family lived in Israel, Sacramento, CA, Washington D.C., and Ogden, UT. The family then moved to Mexico until he was a teen-ager. He attended the New Mexico Military Institute at Roswell, NM, before he set off again to explore the world and its skies. These early life adventures shaped his bold and unique perspective on life and learning. He ultimately settled in Southern Utah, where he and Brenda raised their three daughters. Kimball loved to fly. He was fascinated by the subject of air and space. He earned his pilot’s license in his early 20s, and was an avid reader of military and aeronautical history. Kimball was passionate about travel and exploration. He loved to see the world, and inspired many others to do the same. He was a talented drummer and vocalist. He took great pleasure in music. He played a diverse range of albums during his travels, resulting in memorable soundtracks for all of his travel adventures. Kimball also was a licensed contractor. He designed and built custom homes throughout Southern Utah. He was well-known for the aesthetic architectural designs and clever features he created. Kimball was intent on being of service to his community. He first became an EMT in the early ’80s, which led him to a remarkable career in medicine. In 1984, Kimball received his degree in Nursing, with high honors, from Weber State College via Dixie College and SUSC. Over the next 30 years, Kimball led the charge as a registered nurse in emergency departments (ERs) in Utah and Nevada, helping to save thousands of lives. Kimball first worked in the ER at Dixie Medical Center, in St. George, UT, where he helped to establish its first fixed-wing Life Flight unit. Later, Kimball also worked in the ER at Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, NV, and then moved his practice to North Vista Hospital in North Las Vegas in the early ’90s. He accepted a position as booking nurse at the Las Vegas City Jail in 1999. In 2003, the open road called, and he took a 1-year hiatus to drive 18-wheeler trucks from coast-to-coast for Dick Simon Trucking. He returned to saving lives in 2004, when he accepted a position in the ER at Mesa View Regional Hospital in Mesquite, NV, where he practiced medicine for another 10 years before hanging up his stethoscope to prepare for retirement. At the time of his death, Kimball was building a self-sustaining, eco-friendly home, greenhouse, and garden, the designs of which are marvels of engineering. He was also planning the next family vacation, as well as a European trip with Brenda. Kimball was a brilliant, commanding, and adventurous leader and visionary. He was a devoted and cherished husband, father, grandpa, brother, uncle, friend, and mentor. Words cannot describe our grief in losing him, or the depth of our gratitude for being loved by him. Kimball is survived by his loving wife, Brenda, and their three daughters: Janna Jensen Lewis (Michael), Sandra Lee (Charlie), Karen Macias (Joe); seven grandchildren: Kimball, Savannah, Thomas, Olivia, Sofia, Fiona, and Lucia; and his many, dearly-loved siblings; all of whom he was fiercely proud.

But last June, facing health problems, Mills left the Plaza for the last time, relocating to Las Cruces to live with his sister, Susan, and to battle lung cancer. He succumbed to the disease in a hospice-care facility in Las Cruces last Friday, Susan Mills said. He was 68. “His work and his art was his life,” she said Monday. “He loved being out on the Plaza, he loved Santa Fe, he loved the people he met and the people he worked with. That’s primarily why he never married. There were just so many people who he loved.” Patricia Wyatt, who has run an arts booth on the Plaza for 23 years, said Mills’ outlook was unlike many others. “He liked that contact with people who you otherwise might not meet, to talk to each other about your experiences,” she said. Cliff Mills was born Oct. 23, 1950, in Las Vegas, N.M. His father, also named Cliff, was a teacher who soon thereafter moved the family to Los Alamos to take a job. His mother, Ann Spiess Mills, was an embroidery and needlepoint artist. The younger Mills graduated from Los Alamos High School in 1968 and immediately enrolled in the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, where he spent two years, his sister said. But military decorum was not for him, so he joined the Peace Corps, spending about two years in Ethiopia — an experience that led him to return there years later to help feed hungry children in a famine camp, Susan Mills said. “He loved the people and the culture there, but he did not like seeing the starving children,” she said. “We didn’t talk too much about the famine camps; he just couldn’t do it.” After taking some classes in medicine and journalism at several New Mexico colleges, he began developing a career as an artist. B.G. Randall, his great-grandfather, took photographs as a mining engineer in Taos in the early 1900s, and in 1978, Cliff Mills’ grandmother showed him the family collection of her father’s pictures. Many of those images portrayed life on Taos Pueblo and the nearby plaza area. Mills told The New Mexican in June he used to develop his grandfather’s black-and-white photos in a darkroom before hand-tinting them with acrylic, oil or pastel paints. In 2004, he said he started experimenting with digital versions of both his great-grandfather’s and his own photos of New Mexico’s people and nature. “I was always bored with conventional photography. My idea of being successful was to be as different as I could be,” he said. “My authenticity came from the fact that I came from a family of photographers and always explained my process and my materials.” Mills’ niece, Rose Clark, sometimes worked with him on the Plaza. She said the Plaza was “heaven to him. Being there was what he loved more than anything else.” Clark’s mother died when she was 14 and at that point Mills “helped my dad pick up the slack with not having my mom anymore.” Although he was a “goofy, fun uncle,” he also gave her grief when he discovered she had taken up smoking. She quit. Cliff Mills is survived by his sisters, Susan Mills and Telynnrees Daoren and three nieces and three great nephews, as well as two dogs, Dulce and Canela. “They don’t understand everything yet,” Susan Mills said of the dogs. “But they know he’s gone.” The family is trying to arrange a public memorial of Mills’ life on the Plaza or in some public space in the city in late October.\n\nMontoya, Danny P. 1970 HS\n\nMontoya, Ronald M. 1970 HS ~ 25-Aug-2003\n\nMoore, Michael E. 1970 HS ~ 23-Sep-2010\n\nMorgan, Richard P. 1970 HS ~ 14-Dec-2006\n\nMyrtue, Anton 1970 JC\n\nNash, Charles Edgar 1970 HS ~ 14-May-2005\n\nPerez, Victor L. 1970 JC ~ 17-Sep-2009 age 59 a resident of Las Vegas, New Mexico, for the past fifteen years formerly of Santa Rosa, Vaughn and Encino, New Mexico, passed away September 17, 2009 at the Alta Vista Regional Hospital.

Vernon’s passion was his numerous restaurants including Vernon’s Grille in Dallas, Calico Cafe in Corrales, and Vernon’s Hidden Valley Steaks in Los Rancho de Albuquerque.

Vernon’s last words to Angel just moments before passing were, “I wish everyone in the world could find and share the love we have.” So as a special gift from Vernon to you, the family would request not donations or sympathy for us; but a peace that you would make with an estranged family member, old friend or anyone that God puts in your path.

Chuck’s position allowed him to focus on the important things in life rather than helping with the dishes. Finding Chuck in a room full of people was always easy. All one had to do was listen for grand laughter, see someone getting a huge Chuck hug, or observe who was on the dance floor first. Chuck was loving and loyal to his friends. Realizing having nephews to play with and their toys you could enjoy, Chuck’s heart told him there was room for some females. His first opportunity to expand ”His” family was becoming Godfather for Maryl McNally. As time moved on two beautiful young women, Whitney and Alexandre Harrell became his ”heart” daughters.

He was 68 years old. Leo was born November 2, 1947 in Washington, DC, to Colonel Leo C. Brooks and his wife Mary “Dink” and became the third generation in a proud military family. His earliest desire was to follow his father into aviation, and he accomplished his dream in spades. He served in Vietnam flying 110 missions in an AC-119 K Gunship, where he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and The Air Medal. After Vietnam, he flew refueling tankers for the Strategic Air Command, receiving many commendations for natural leadership, strong judgment, and exceptional flying skills. Leo remained in the US Air Force for six years before joining the Reserves as he also joined Continental Airlines. He not only distinguished himself as a “great stick,” but as a much beloved and respected instructor and check airman. He flew for 41 years, over 28,000 hours, including 39 years as a Command Pilot with 35 years in heavy jets. For many years he was a Line Check Airman and Proficiency Check Airman on Airbus 300s, Boeing 757s, 767s, and 777s. He was Flight Test Lead for the DC-10 fleet, and a Boeing 747 Instructor Pilot. He helped set up airlines on behalf of Continental for Ireland, Greece, Pakistan, and Turkey, among others. The thread that wove through his career as a pilot was his love of people and food. In Vietnam he organized memorable dinners for all, undaunted by the idea of feeding fifty to sixty air crew with steaks and scotch he had located by any means possible. When later furloughed from Continental for two years, he captained non-scheduled flights of a B-707 all over Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, gently ferrying pregnant cows from Holland to Nigeria, or State-Department-sanctioned supplies to our then-ally Iraq. He did his job well, and he also went into every kitchen he came close to, learning about strange and wonderful foods and gathering recipes everywhere he went. In later years, his wife would marvel at how many pantry items appeared out of his bag, including the best saffron and delicious wierd marinated things. He and his wife Barbara Hanley met and married in Miami, Florida, and moved to Westport in 1995 from Boston. He continued flying with Continental Airlines after it merged with United Airlines until he retired in November 2012, meanwhile co-founding cheese company Shy Brothers Farm® with his wife and dairy farmers Karl, Kevin, Norman, and Arthur Santos. Leo loved to fish and cook, and, when not in a cockpit, was happiest with his dogs or in front of a cook fire at Boat Beach. In the last few months, he got to visit the mountain field in Serbia where his father had led Operation Halyard, a stealth rescue mission of 269 downed pilots under the German forces’ nose in World War II. Leo was a quiet, kind, and generous man, and he will be missed by many. Leo is survived by his wife Barbara and his brother Joe Brooks of Orlando Florida, as well as many friends and colleagues around the country.\n\nBrown, Michael P. 1968 JC\n\nBrownfield, John V. 1968 JC ~ 28-Jul-2001\n\nBrummett, Tom W. 1968 JC ~ 16-Aug-1975\n\nButton, Larry R., Sr. 1968 JC ~ 02-Feb-2004 , was born June 14, 1948 in Fort Worth, Texas to Nathan A. and Betty Button and passed away February 2, 2004 in Richardson, Texas.

Gene was born on February 26, 1948, in Lubbock, Texas, the first child of Charles W. Jones and Cora Lee Reed Jones. During his early life, the family moved around to several Texas towns, eventually settling in Ballinger when Gene was 10 years old. His fun and adventurous streak was evident early on, beginning with the childhood adventures he would have with his two sisters, Julia and Laura Lee. In addition to his two sisters, his four first cousins, “the Jones boys,” were like brothers to him and they remained close throughout his life. He graduated from New Mexico Military Institute in 1966. Shortly thereafter, he moved to Dallas and began a career in construction equipment sales and rentals, which allowed him to meld his mechanical mind with his interpersonal and sales prowess. This career moved him to Houston in 1986, to Sydney, Australia in 1989, and back to Houston in 1991. After returning to Houston, he became a municipal building and plumbing inspector, which he continued until he retired in 2016. Gene’s life was defined by so much more than just his professional accomplishments, though – most notably by his 38-year marriage to the love of his life, Fran, and his never ending sense of adventure, which sent him all over the world and connected him with a wide array of friends. While living in Dallas in the mid-70s, Gene became interested in private piloting and learned to fly single-engine airplanes, earning his pilot’s license in 1976. Gene and Fran’s story began while they were both living in Dallas in the late 70s, when Gene’s sister, Julia, fatefully asked her brother to fill in as a four that a bridge game along with Fran, her best friend. From the moment the two met across the bridge table, the sparks flew. They were finishing each other’s sentences almost immediately, and a relationship for the ages was born. They married in Dallas on March 29, 1980, and over the next 38 years, continued to be the type of soulmates, rare in today’s world, with true connection evident to anyone fortunate enough to witness it in action. Even in the midst of the hardest times, their house was always full of love, fun, and howling laughter. Gene and Fran shared a love of camping, and one of their favorite memories was of a particularly resplendent sunrise in the Santa Elena Canyon in Big Bend that they saw on one of their camping trips in the early days of their relationship. They also always shared a love of baseball which, was initially centered on the Texas Rangers, but eventually focused on the Houston Astros. In the mid-80s, Gene discovered his love of sailing. During the time he and Fran lived in Sydney, Australia, they traveled extensively throughout that continent and he continued to develop his sailing skills along with undertaking other new adventures, including bungee jumping (which was cutting edge at the time). When they moved back to Houston, it was critical that they be close to the water so Gene could sail, so they settled in the Clear Lake area. While most people would be satisfied with a house that was already constructed, Gene took on the additional challenge of building their home himself. He continued to sail over the years, and captioned a 43′ sailing vessel, “The Wild Thing”, and won a race to Puerto Aventuras. In the early 2000s, Gene became interested in racing cars, and drove in numerous Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), Houston, solo races for several years, winning C Street Prepared in 2001. He also had a lifelong interest in motorcycles, riding intermittently throughout his life. After retiring in 2016, he focused his attention on long distance motorcycle rides, culminating in the achievement of one of his major bucket list items, when he rode his Harley-Davidson to Alaska and back, in 28 days. Gene is survived by his loving wife, Frances Ekstrum Jones; grandchildren, Bailey McKenna Pruitt and Maxwell “Max” Connor Pruitt; and sisters, Julia Ellen Jones and Laura Lee Jones Reininger and her husband, David. Gene also leaves behind an extended family including his niece, nephew, aunt and cousins, as well as dear friends, who all adored him. Gene was preceded in death by his daughter, Laura Ellen Jones Lee; father, Charles W. Jones; and his mother, Cora Lee Reed Jones.\n\nKelley, Dr. Patrick D. 1968 JC ~ 08-Sep-2000\n\nKlein, Keith V. 1968 JC\n\nKrattiger, William D. 1968 JC ~ 03-Apr-2006\n\nLapka, Judge Adrian A. 1968 HS ~ 28-Oct-2005 56, Minneapolis, died Friday, Oct. 28, 2005.

A native of Arivaca, Arizona, Earle attended the Sopori School, the New Mexico Military Institute, and the University of Arizona, where he graduated with a degree in agriculture. Earle remained an ardent Wildcat and Aggie the rest of his life. Starting his career at Arizona Feeds, he found his calling as a serviceman for the Valley Telephone Cooperative, Inc., working for decades out of Animas, New Mexico, and Willcox, Arizona. He ultimately retired in Sunsites (Pearce), Arizona, where he pursued an active lifestyle of golf, fishing, and good neighboring until pain in his knees and hips forced him to reduce his activity level. It was in pursuit of a new set of knees and hips that his heart finally failed him. Earle was blessed to grow up on a working cattle ranch where he enjoyed the cowboy life. Pursuit of an education lead him to other walks of life, but he never lost his love of the countryside, the desert, and the off-work fun they provided him. Earle’s ready, boisterous laugh and constant sense of humor added lots of spice to his life and the lives of his family and friends. Earle was also a very private man, never married or had children, but left an extended family of cousins from all over the United States in addition to his mother, siblings, and aunts, and a large group of friends. Earle is survived by his elder sister, Pamela Ruth Osborne; his younger brother, John Edwards (Diana) Osborne and his aunts, Mary Ellen McArthur and Dottie Osborne.
