        "text": "Born November 28th, 1981 in Joplin, MO. and passed away August 21, 2009. He is survived by his Mother Sandi and Father Jim; Brother – Jimmy Kristin Nephews, Grayson and Jesse; Sister Kelly Matt Nephew, Jacob and Nieces, Megan and Katie; Loving Girlfriend, Elise Larkin; and many ‘adopted’ brothers: Cory, Chris, John and Mike. He was also survived by an extensive amount of Aunts, Uncles, Cousins and extended family.\n\nAs a child, Adam played baseball, basketball, soccer and loved playing the saxophone. After high school, Adam went through a 5 year apprenticeship with the Local 11 Electricians Union and worked as a proud electrician in the South Bay. He touched many lives and will be sorely missed.\n\nAdam was a Loyal Son, Brother and Uncle and Friend and was thankful for all the relationships he had over the years.\n\nHe was philosophical in life and has been philosophical in death.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in his name to CHOC’s Children’s Hospital of Orange County would be greatly appreciated.\n\n‘Through the dark smoke, I can see the light. I know for sure everything is going to be alright. With the pain and chaos comes a comforting hand. We don’t understand, but deep down know it is God’s plan.’"
