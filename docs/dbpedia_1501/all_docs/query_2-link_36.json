        "text": "The 2023 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament has been whittled down to just four teams. And the field is left without many of its household names on the sideline.\n\nMike Krzyzewski, Jay Wright and Roy Williams are retired. Jim Boeheim missed the tournament in his final season at Syracuse. Bill Self, Tom Izzo, John Calipari and Bob Huggins all came up short in the tournament this year.\n\nOf the four coaches left, no one has as much experience as Jim Larranaga, Miami's head coach. Larranaga has guided the Hurricanes to their first-ever Final Four in his 12th season in Coral Gables. Only UConn's Dan Hurley has been a collegiate head coach longer than Larranaga's Miami stint alone.\n\nHow old is the Canes' head coach? Here's what you need to know.\n\nTSN's MARCH MADNESS HQ\n\nLive NCAA bracket | TV schedule | Predictor tool\n\nHow old is Jim Larranaga?\n\nLarranaga was born on Oct. 2, 1949, and is 73 years old as of this year's NCAA Tournament.\n\nJim Larranaga career timeline\n\nLarranaga is one of the winningest coaches in men's basketball history. He is 13th among active head coaches with 725 wins, per the NCAA, and 45th all-time.\n\nLarranaga has not spent his entire coaching career with Miami, however. He has made three previous head coaching stops along the way.\n\nAmerican International: 1977-79\n\nBowling Green State: 1986-1997\n\nGeorge Mason: 1997-2011\n\nMiami: 2011-Present\n\nPrior to coaching, Larranaga was a player for Providence. In three seasons with the Friars, he appeared in 77 games and averaged 16.3 points with 6.0 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game. He graduated in 1971, and was named to the college's Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nAfter Larranaga's playing career, he joined Terry Holland's coaching staff at Davidson College as an assistant coach from 1971-76, during which time the Wildcats won three Southern Conference titles and appeared in the NIT each year.\n\nIn 1977, Larranaga was given his first chance to become a head coach, guiding the Division II program American International. During his two years there, the team went 28-25. He went from there to an assistant coaching spot at Virginia in 1979, again working under Holland.\n\nHe returned to being a head coach in 1986 when he arrived at Bowling Green. The Falcons improved from 7-20 in 1985-86 to go 15-14 in Larranaga's first season. Larranaga's teams had losing records in four of the next seasons, but ended on a run of four straight winning campaigns, including a MAC regular-season title in 1997.\n\nLarranaga's success with the Falcons led to him getting hired to be the next head coach at George Mason. The Patriots endured a 9-18 season in his first year with them, but turned around quickly from there.\n\nBy the time he left in 2011, he had made five NCAA tournament appearances, including taking No. 11 George Mason to the Final Four in 2006. He won four CAA regular-season and three tournament titles and set the program record with 273 wins.\n\nMORE: Larranaga, 17 years after George Mason run, leads Miami to first Final Four\n\nThe Hurricanes hired Larranaga after the 2010-11 season, and they found immediate success under his leadership. Miami went to the NIT in his first season as the coach. The next year, the Hurricanes won the ACC regular season and tournament en route to the NCAA Tournament, at one point reaching as high as No. 2, the highest the team has been ranked in the AP Poll.\n\nBefore the 2022-23 season, Larranaga took Miami to the NCAA Tournament four times. In the 2021-22 campaign, the Hurricanes reached the Elite Eight, the farthest the program had advanced in March. This year, he's taken them one step farther.\n\nLarranaga has won more games with the Hurricanes than any other Miami head coach, with a record of 255-148 entering the Final Four. Bruce Hale's 220 wins are the second-most among coaches.\n\nJim Larranaga son\n\nLarranaga has evidently passed down the coaching gene to his son. Jay Larranaga, who played for his dad at Bowling Green from 1993-97, enjoyed an international basketball career through 2009. Late in his career, he was a player and coach for the Ireland men's basketball team.\n\nHe coached them through 2010 before becoming the head coach of the NBA Development League squad Erie BayHawks. He was the team's head coach until 2012 when he was hired by the Boston Celtics to become an assistant coach under Brad Stevens.\n\nJay Larranaga is currently an assistant coach for the Clippers, a position for which he was hired in 2021."
