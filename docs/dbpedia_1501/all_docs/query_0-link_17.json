        "text": "March 9, 1938 ~ August 15, 2021 (age 83)\n\nObituary\n\nAndy Peña, 83, passed away peacefully at the family home in Albuquerque, NM on August 15, 2021 surrounded by family after a lengthy illness. A lifelong Catholic, it was no surprise that he was taken to the gates of paradise by our Mother Mary on her Assumption Day. Born on March 9, 1938 in Encino, NM to Andres Peña and Octaviana Larrañaga Peña, he was the youngest of seven brothers and sisters and the last living survivor of the original Peña family. He graduated from Encino High School where he excelled in academics and sports; briefly attended Highland’s University in Las Vegas, NM and later received an associate degree in air conditioning, heating and cooling from TVI. He held several jobs and lived in various places around New Mexico. He was especially proud to have worked as a photographer for the missile booster program at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base. After receiving his degree from TVI, he worked as an appliance service technician for General Electric where he was awarded Technician of the Year and retired thirty years later. He was a veteran of the U.S. Army AUS Infantry in Ft. Carson, CO where he served as an E-1 Private Sharpshooter and Marksman until he received a hardship honorable discharge to care for his ill parents right before he was scheduled to be stationed in South Korea.\n\nIn his spare time, he was an avid outdoorsman often found fishing, hunting and camping. In the 1990’s, he harvested a trophy mule deer that was the biggest buck that had ever been found in the “Ramadero” area in Eastern New Mexico. He was so proud that he had the head stuffed, mounted and it hangs in the family living room today. He loved to read newspapers, magazines and Louis L ’Amour western books. He loved listening to music and could always be found listening to Dolly Parton, Allison Kraus, Kitty Wells, Loretta Lynn, SPARX as well as other classic country and New Mexican music. He also loved going to the casinos, going out to eat as well watching TV westerns with John Wayne, Kenny Rogers and Jimmy Stewart. He was a huge sports fan and loved to watch college and professional sports, especially football, basketball and track and field. He followed the UNM Lobos, NMSU Aggies and was a Dallas Cowboys fan for many years-depending how good they were! Even towards the end of his illness, he still tried to watch the 2020 Olympics as best he could. Among his favorite foods were fresh pinto beans, chicharrones, fried potatoes, lamb, steak or any type of meat. He was also a pretty good grill master on the BBQ and his legendary green chili stew was highly requested by members of the family when they were sick for its’ healing power. He enjoyed his daily walks with Jared and would often return joking that people stopped to compliment how pretty Jared was, but no one thought he was pretty. He loved giving nicknames to people often calling his wife “lady” and his granddaughters “Miggy” and “Paquita.” He loved gardening and could be found tending to the beautiful roses and lawns he so tenderly cared for daily. He was happiest spending time with family and friends and talking on the phone to keep up with the latest events in the family. He would often call people on their birthday and customize Las Mañanitas to fit the person. As a man of Faith, the two traits he most valued in people were honesty and integrity and he ensured his family were raised with the same beliefs. His determination, perseverance and belief in old fashioned hard work helped propel him from being born into a family with very meager resources to a successful and respected man-again ensuring his family were instilled with these traits.\n\nHe is survived by the love of his life of 56 years, Mercedes Peña – nearly missing their 57th anniversary on August 22nd; two sons, Chris Peña and Bobby Peña; one daughter in law, April Peña; two granddaughters, Renee Peña and Alyssa Peña; his beloved four-legged best friend, Jared, along with many nieces, nephews and other relatives.\n\nThe family would like to thank Presbyterian Complete Care, especially Lyndzy McKay and Charlene Gardner for their weekly care during his illness and Presbyterian Homecare Hospice, especially Rusty and Patti for their assistance.\n\nA rosary will be recited on Monday, August 23, 2021 at 6pm at French - Lomas and Eubank in Albuquerque, NM. High Mass will be celebrated on Tuesday, August 24, 2021 at Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church at 11am on Lomas and Tennessee also in Albuquerque, NM with Father Edward Dome as celebrant assisted by Deacon Jim Delgado. Christian burial with Military Honors will follow at the Encino Catholic Cemetery in Encino, NM around 1:45pm followed by a meal at the new Encino Fire Department building next to the church around 2:30pm. Serving as pallbearers will be Victor Larrañaga, Ernest Archibeque, Robbie Larrañaga, Edward Tenorio, Pat Garcia and Sonny Tapia. Honorary pallbearers will be Renee Peña, Alyssa Peña, Cindy Lovato, Canda Hernandez, Marylou Urioste, Tina Romero and his beloved Jared.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Andy Peña, please visit our floral store.\n\nServices\n\nROSARY\n\nMonday\n\nAugust 23, 2021\n\n6:00 PM\n\nLomas Chapel\n\n10500 Lomas Blvd NE\n\nAlbuquerque, NM 87112\n\nRECEPTION\n\nMonday\n\nAugust 23, 2021\n\n7:30 PM\n\nLomas Reception room\n\n10500 Lomas Blvd NE\n\nAlbuquerque, NM 87112\n\nMASS\n\nTuesday\n\nAugust 24, 2021\n\n11:00 AM\n\nOur Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church\n\n811 Guaymas Pl.
