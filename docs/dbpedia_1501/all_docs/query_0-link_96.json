We have further to record the equally interesting project where- by the turbulent Colorado River was diverted from its course into a new channel, thus establishing the fact that the greatest of all en- gineering projects of the world, the Hoover Dam, was successfully launched. In our landmarks work, we have great progress to record. Ex- tensive excavations were made at Cainpo de Cauenga Memorial Park whereby the exact size and dimensions of the Casa de Cauenga was revealed. This is the historic site where Fremont met Pico and the Articles of Capitulation, known as the Treaty of Cauenga, were signed, thus establishing permanent peace in California and finally bringing this state into the possession of the United States. Another great achievement to be noted is the restoration of San Diego mission chapel. This was the first established mission in the long chain of missions built by the Franciscan friars in Alta Cali- fornia. Also San Diego has marked thirty-eight historic landmarks. These projects in history and landmarks work set a high mark for future attainments. May Patriotism, Prosperity, and Progre.ss attend us ■ — under Infinite guidance. Publication Committee Olympic Memorial Coliseum — Los Angeles, July 30, 1932 Photo by Keystone Xth olympiad — LOS ANGELES ‘\"The main issue in life is not the victory but the fight; the es- sential is not to have won but to have fought well.” The revival of the modern Olympic Games, the first of which were celebrated in Athens, Greece, in 1896, was due to the idealism and enterprise of Baron Piere de Coubertin. His first public announce- was as follows: “Let us export our oarsmen, our runners, our fencers, into other lands. That is the true Free Trade of the future; and the day it is introduced into Europe the cause of Peace will have received a new and strong ally. It inspires me to touch upon the future step I now propose, and in it I shall ask your help, so that together we may attempt to realize, upon a basis suitable to the conditions of our modern life, the splendid and benificent task of reviving the Olympic Games.” Two years later, a circular to all Athletic Associations brought together in the Amphitheatre of Sorbonne in June, 1891, enough del- egates from various countries to organize the International Olympic Committee. At this meeting Baron de Coubertin proposed that the first games of the new era be celebrated in Athens, thus launching the series of modern Olympiads of which Los Angeles celebrated the Tenth. . The ceremony was opened promptly at 2:30 p.m. Saturday, July 30, 1932, in the Olympic Memorial Coliseum, Exposition Park, Los Angeles. Singing of The Star Spangled Banner by a choir of twelve hundred voices prepared the vast audience of one hundred and twen- ty thousand persons for the “Parade of Nations,” when the flower of the world’s athletes passed in review before the Vice-President of our nation, Honorable Charles Curtis. These youths entered in the or- der as prescribed by rule. Greece, founder of the Games, leading, and the United States, host of the Nations, at the rear. The list included thirty-eight nations. After the last group of athletes had moved into position, William May Garland, J^resident of the Organizing Com- mittee of the Olympic Games, gave an address of w^elcorne. Vice-President Honorable Charles Curtis then formally opened the games with the prescribed words: 272 Historical Society of Southern California “I proclaim open the Olympic Games of Los Angeles celebrating the Xth Olympiad of the modern era.” This was followed by an artillery salute and the Olympic torch ritual, when a mighty column of flame flared up from the peristyle where it was to burn throughout the games. Other addresses were made, and then came the final spectacle of adminstering the athlete’s oath. As the solemn and impressive words of the oath: “WE SWEAR THAT WE WILL TAKE PART IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN LOYAL COMPETITION, RESPECTING THE REGULA- TIONS WHICH GOVERN THEM AND DESIROUS OF PARTI- CIPATING IN THEM IN THE TRUE SPIRIT OF SPORTSMANSHIP FOR THE HONOR OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE GLORY OF SPORTS,” rang out through the voice of Lieutenant George Calnan, a thousand individual representatives of other nations raised their right hands in token of acquiescence and participation of the oath. The Parade of Nations left the Coliseum. All was in readiness for the games. During the games there were many heart-aches and disappoint- . ments, but the spartan spirit of CITIES, ALTIUS, FORTIUS, (swifter, higher, stronger) steeled the brave hearts of the youths to smilingly accept defeat as well as victory. No one can ever forget, who heard the ringing words, CEREMONIE OLTMPIC PROTOCOLAIRE, (the Olympic victory ceremony) and the stirring applause that greeted the flass of the winning nations when hoisted to the notes of their national anthems. The sweeping victory of America’s athletes aston- ished the sporting world and left a grave responsibility for the future vouth. Sixteen days of triumph and happiness, then came the closing day and its impressive ceremonies, one of which placed a pleasing responsibility upon the City of Los Angeles when Count Baillet- Latour, President of the International Olympic Committee, delivered into our keeping the Olympic Flag. Mayor John C. Porter, representing the City accepted the flag in the words: “Mr. Chairman, I wish to thank you and to assure you that the Olympic Flag you are entrusting to me will be kept in the City Hall Xth Olympiad — Los Angeles 273 of Los Angeles until the end of the Xth Olympiad, when it will be entrusted to the City of Berlin in 1936.” The Olympic torch flamed high and then faded as the echoes of “Aloha”, the farewell of the Pacific, were hummed by the throng as they departed in suppressed feeling. The games were at an end. Hail and Farewell! 1 HOOVER . DAM . PROJECT Reprinted from Hoover Dam Project, by William Woollett ON JLL^ 3, 1930, President Hoover approved the initial appro- priation of $10,660,000.00 for construction of a dam in Black Canyon, later named '\"Hoover Dain/' Final surveys were immediately instituted, followed as rapidly as possible bv the construction under contract of thirty-three miles of standard gauge railroad line and thirty miles of paved highway to connect the project with trunk lines; the erection of 222 miles of transmission line to bring electrical power from the Sierra Nevada mountains; and the choosing of a site for a construction camp, where the town of Boulder City was later laid out to accommodate a popu- lation of 6,000 persons. In the spring of 1931, erection of buildings was started in the construction camp and in twelve months the town included 900 homes, eleven dormitories for 1.500 men, several office buildings, churches, stores, restaurants, garages and theatre, with all conveniences of paved streets, electricitv at low rates, an adequate supply of pure water and an efficient sanitarv sewer system. The principal contract for construction of Hoover Dam, power plant and appurtenant works was awarded to Six Companies, Inc., of San Francisco in March. 1931, and by the end of that month, this or- ganization had commenced work at a dozen locations. Dormitories and residences were speedily erected in Boulder City, standard gauge railroad lines were laid connecting all major operations, roads were built along tlie sheer walls of Black Canyon to the inlet and outlet portals of diversion tunnels, cableways and bridges were flung across the river, a sand and gravel screening and washing plant of 500 tons per hour capacity, and a 250-cubic-yard per hour concrete mixing plant were erected. Two months after the contract was awarded. Six Companies, Inc., was driving diversion tunnels through the walls of Black Canvon around the damsite, to carry the entire flow of the Colorado River while building the dam. Excavation for these four 56-foot average diameter bores, for their aggregate length of three miles, was com- pleted a year later, involving the removal of a million and a half cubic yards of rock. Lining the tunnels with a three-foot average thickness of concrete and building portals and gate structures, some to support 50 feet bv Hoover . Dam . Project 277 50 feet steel gates, each weighing three million tons, have been in progress since February, 1932, and will be completed, or nearly so, by February, 1933. According to present plans, the Colorado River started flowing through two of these tunnels on November 13, 1932, and by the time of the spring floods of 1933, each of the four tunnels will be carrying a portion of the river flow. Work now in progress includes constructing an earth and gravel fill dam, 100 feet high and 700 feet thick, at a location downstream from the inlets of diversion tunnels, to turn the river from its old channel through the tunnels; excavating large niches in the canvon walls for four reinforced concrete towers, 75 feet in average diameter and 338 feet high; stripping loose and overhanging rocks from canyon walls above the damsite and structures downstream; excavating two channels of average dimensions 600 feet long, 150 feet wide, and 120 feet deep that will form the spillways; and driving 56 feet average diameter inclined tunnels connecting spillway channels with outer diversion tunnels.

Campo de Cauenca — Fremont-Pico Memorial Park THE FREMONT-PICO MExMORIAL PARK (Campo de Cauenga) The Home of Don Tomas Feliz Its Excavation and Proposed Restoration By J. Marshall Miller ' (Editor’s Note: The research and excavation work described in this article have been undertaken by the author, Mr. J. Marshall Miller, a member of the Historical Society of Southern California, for the purpose of assembling and organizing all available facts regarding the Cauenga house, in preparation for the anticipated restoration, hoping thus to eliminate the inaccuracies which often occur in hasty research. Mr. Elmer R. King, member of the faculty of the John C. Fremont High School, with several of his students, gave able assistance in the excavation work.) AS the molding of the adobe bricks was progressing, and the walls of his extensive dwelling slowly took shape, Don Tomas Feliz did not dream that this hacienda which he was erecting for his family on the sloping Cauenga* plain was destined to become a famous land- mark of California and the Southwest. Here at the foot of the north slope of the Providencia (Santa Monica), Mountains, at the northern approach to Cahuenga Pass and within a few hundred feet of the Rio de Porciuncula (Los Angeles River), Don Tomas had selected a site for his home. Nearby a stretch of El Camino Real wound its leisurely way, linking iVIision San Fern- ando with La Ciudad de Los Angeles. Near this spot were fought several battles between the northern and southern factions of Alta Cali- fornia in the davs of Micheltorena and Pico. In this no-man's-land of earlv California the Casa de Cauenga was built in 1845. On the ver- anda of this house on January 13,1817, Lieut. -Col. John C. Fremont and Gen. Andres Pico met to sign the Articles of Capitulation (Treaty of Cauenga ) which marked the close of military activities in Califor- nia hetweeen Mexico and the United States, soon to be followed by the cession to the United Slates of the vast territory now comprising our Southwest. At the time of the signing of the Articles of Capitulation, the Casa de Cauenga was only two years old. During the next several decades the property underwent several changes in ownership and the house went from varied uses eventually to disuse and ruination. By 190U only a mound of adobe marked the site of this famous landmark, and 280 Historical Society of Southern California upon the subdivision and development of the tract in 1915-20, the last visible traces of the house were erased in the processes of grading and leveling. As the modern street and property lines run diagonal to the old walls, the later widening of Lankershim Boulevard has destroyed a corner of the foundation. Due to uncertainty of data regarding the exact location, and also to the lack of sufficient funds at the time of the purchase of the property by the Gty of Los Angeles in 1923, only a part of the ground formerly covered by the house was secured. Not until 1931, when the possibility of restoration was in view and excava- tion had begun, did the full extent of the original building become known. Excavation and study of the foundations was undertaken to aid in establishing the true size and features of the house in anticipation of proper restoration, as well as to assure the exact identity and extent of the place. The sources of information pertaining to the early history of the building and its environs and to its original appearance were meager and scattered. No photographs or sketches of the place have been found of earlier date than 1904, and by that time the building was a total ruin. The only source of data wdiich remained to us for the period previous to that date was early surveys or land plats, and in this field of inquiry we had considerable success. Information was obtained from pioneers who remembered the place. Descriptions in contemporary writings have also proved helpful. Four early surveys are available which delineate that section of the valley. In some cases these give detailed facts about the house itself. The dates of these surveys range from 1854 to 1877. The earliest survey of w'hich we have knowledge is- one by George Hansen dated July 24, 1854. This shows the southwestern portion of San Fernando Valley in the vicinity of Cahuenga Pass, and although it is of quite small scale, it shows the situation of the “Cahunga” house on a portion of the property owned by Tomas Feliz. The “Plat of Ex-Mission San Fernando,” a survey by Reynolds dated March 16, 1871, is a land survey covering the entire San Fer- nando Valley and outlining the area finally confirmed to Euligio de Celis. This survey shows the location and name of the “Cahuanga . house. The bounds of the entire original Ex-Mission area are shown.. The site of the Cauenga house was in the southeast corner of this area, and not on the Rancho San Rafael or the Rancho Providencia y- Fremont-Pico Memorial Park 281 Cahuenga as has been supposed. The third survey of which we have knowledge is a “Map of Por- tion of Ex-Mission de San Fernando” dated 1874 and signed by A. C. Ruxton, Surveyor, and Frank Lecouvreur, Del. Here again the place of the “Cahuanga House” is clearly shown and named. For many years it was thought that the Cauenga house was a subsidiary of Mission San Fernando and it was often called the “Cahuenga Chapel.” This supposi- tion is shown to be incorrect by reference to the 1874 survey which shows the “Carvanza Mission” situated northeast of the Cauenga house and across the road quite near the river. The field survey book of John Goldsworthy, Tnited States Deputy Surveyor, contains a comparatively large-scale survey of the location of “Cahuenga Ruins” and immediate vicinity, dated August 4, 1877. The extent of the house, which was even then partially in ruin, is clearly shown, with a corridor on the west side, another corridor on the north side and a porch on the east, the {)i operty on which the house was outlined being 150.21 feel by 200 feet. A short distance to the north is shown the old oak tree which was near the river bank. This tree is an old landmark usually associated with the Cauenga house. According to one Miguel Linares, brother-in-law of General Andres Pico and an eye witness on this occasion, it was under this tree that the horses of Pico and Fremont stood while the two men met to sign the Articles of Capitulation in 1817. The inference has sometimes been incorrectly made that the treaty was signed under this tree. On each of these surveys the house is located and named and its relation to surrounding landmarks clearly shown. Thus there is no question as to the exact spot it occupied or its identity. Although the knowdedge gained from surveys and descriptions was of great value, it was necessarily limited. The last possible source of information was the ruin itself. No particular investigations had been made at the site because the general impression was that the pro- gress of the modern city with its streets and other improvements, had rid the site of all clues. But upon examination of the ground, it was soon discovered that at least some of the foundations and tile floors still remained intact below the present grade. This revelation was most encouraging and upon further excavation many interestitjg facts were })i-ought to light and solved many puzzling problems. Before discussing the findings at the site, consideration will be 282 Historical :^ociety of Southern California I 1 'Y SuRV / . r.

Deputy Surveyor, Made August 4, 1877 ■-^?l -M: Fremont-Pico Memorial Park 283 given to the location of the building and its setting in relation to topographical delineations and to recent improvements and develop- ments in the vicinity resulting from the growth of the city. The tract of land under discussion lies in the southeastern part of San Fernando Valley just north of Cahuenga Pass in the County of Los Angeles. It is in Township 1 North, Range 14 West, San Bernar- dino and Meridian, near the southwest corner. Upon the subdivision of the property the site of the house became known as Lots 15, 16, and 17 of the Universal City Tract in the City of Los Angeles. These lots are located on the northwest side of Lankershim Boulevard and op- posite the Universal Motion Picture Studio. The lots as subdivided measure 50 x 200 feet each. Lots 16 and 17 are now in possession of the City of Los Angeles, while Lot 15 is still in private hands. When the land in this section was subdivided and sold by the Lankershim estate, the whole tract was graded to a common level. Seeminglv those in charge of the grading had no knowledge of or interest in the matter of investigation or preserving any remains of the Cauenga house. No doubt many valuable and interesting remnants and clues were destroyed or lost by the leveling of the land. The house was of adobe construction. The foundations are of cobblestone set in lime mortar. The foundations of the exterior and other major walls are 3 feet thick and vary from 1 foot 6 inches to 3 feet in depth. The minor partition walls have foundations 2 feet in width and about 1 foot 6 inches deep. The tops of all foundations are apjyioximatelv at the floor level. The surface of all the property in this vicinity slopes slightly toward the river, and in the laying of the foundations and floors, Don Tomas made no particular attempt to establish a differing level; consequently the levels of the floors and foundations conform more or less to the slope of the surrounding site. Since all the adobe walls were carried on cobblestone foundations, the number, size, and extent of all rooms could be fairly well deter- mined upon the unearthing of the foundations. All rooms were floored with tile. This tile, averaging in size about 11 x 14 inches and about 1 to 2 inches thick, is of typical mission shape, workmanship, and texture- and very probably came from the kiln near Mision San Fern- ando, or perhaps from mission ruins themselves. The roof tile, broken pieces of which were scattered all about the site, was a mission product and probably came from the same source as the floor tile. Typical roof .1 ^ 99'-6\" 284 Historical Society of Southern California Fremont-Pico Memorial Park 285 tiles of this period varied from 21 or 21 inches in length, and from 10 to 12 inches across the large end. The adobe used in the making of the bricks was found on or adjacent to the site, and was probably procured, mixed, and molded near the river where water was at hand for mixing. Considering the fact that the main walls were three feet thick and the thinner ones two feet, it may be assumed that the size of the bricks was about 11 x 2 4 x 3 inches. Upon completion of the excavation, the full extent of the main building was clearly shown. The building proper measures 39 feet 0 inches x 99 feet 6 inches. In addition, foundations for pillars were unearthed which indicated that there had been a corridor 13 feet 10 inches wide along the entire north end. Evidence was also present of a long porch adjoining this corridor along part of the west wall, and a short porch on the east side. The house lies almost exactly with the points of the compass, the long dimension being north and south. There were six rooms in the house, separated by adobe walls, and floored with tiles. The largest room was found on the east side, mea- suring 15 feet in width and 61 feet 6 inches in length. This large room probably served as the living room or sala grande, and it was here that the social gatherings so characteristic of early California were held. The exact location of the kitchen has not been clearly deter- mined, since it is not mentioned in description or drawings, and no traces ot it have yet been discovered at the site. It is possible that it was in a separate unit apart from the main structure, and we hope that more extensive excavation will clarify this point. The small room in the southwest corner was the logical place for the altar, while the remaining rooms were probably sleeping rooms and guest rooms. During the excavation process, all findings were accurately record' ed, and many photographs were taken for verification and future re- ference. Following completion of work at the site, plans were drawn for the restoration of the house, incorporating the data gleaned from all known sources of information on the subject. The structure was thoroughly typical of the rural home of the “late mission” period, the construction, details, and workmanship being of the same general type as found in the later mission structures. The use of adobe and tile bricks for wall and pillar construction: the extensive use of timbers for beams and rafters, for corridor posts. Fremont-Pico Memorial Park 287 Lester S. Ford Excavation Disclosing Portions of the Folndation of Casa de Cauenga doors, sliuHers and grilles; tlie liand-wroiiglit hinges, locks and nails; the hand-made roof tile and floor tile, and the roof covering of thatch and hrea, as well as tile, were all typical of lionies built in the Thirties and forties as well as in the earlier mission-building period. There is no (pieslion but that this site is one of the foremost of California’s landmarks, as well as a vital spot in the history of the Southwest. Its significant historical value should serve as a stimulus to assure the restoration of this early home. With tlie active supj)ort of interested individuals and groups, the restoration should be entirely possible. The Los Angeles City Park Department (the })resent custodians of the site) favoi*s restoration. The Los Angeles Library Hoard are greatly interested in the possible use of a jK>rtion of the proposed building as a branch library especi- illv for California. The facultv and student bodv of the John C. Fre- 288 Historical Society of Southern California Lester S. Ford Excavation Disclosing Portions of the : Porch Foundation at Casa de Cauenga - moot Higli School wish to secure an appropriate place to deposit and preserve their collection of relics and belongings of Andres Pico and Fremont, and will lend their enthusiastic support lo the restoration of the Cauenga house. With the cooperation of these groups and, the support of the historical and other interested societies and organiza- tions, this important landmark, for so many decades a formless ruin, shall once again live and serve. The restoration will result not only in a monument appropriate to commemorate an historic event, but in the re-creation, through accurate and careful use of facts and building materials, of a setting and atmosphere wholly typical of the life of the early California rancho, with its spirit of hospitality, of ease and of gaiety. As has been the case with other important landmarks, this will prove a definite asset to community and state, an historic shrine for tliose who have at heart the preservation of the glorious history of California. *The name Cauenga is derived from the name of a former Gabrielea Indian rancheria situated in this district. There are several different spellings of the word by different authors, the earlier form being most Frkmont-Pico Memorial Park 289 California History Nug«:et Lester S. Ford Old Tile Floor at Casa de Calenga inconsistent. Hug-o Ried, in his writings of 1852, used Cabeugna. Lieut. Col. .John C. Fremont, in his Memoirs, spells the word Couenj^a, as does Bryant who was a member of the U. S. forces in this vicinity in 1847. In the Articles of Capitulation written by Don Jose Antonio Carrillo, we find the words Campo de Cauen^a. Carrillo was a scholar and was recognized as one of the best educated men of the vicinity in his time. He had knowledge of both Spanish and Indian languages, and was well acquainted with the earlier rancherias of the neighborhood, so it is logical to assume that his spelling would be the correct form. His was the first recorded spelling, and is substantiated by the fact that the Spanish spelling of the name of the Indians living there was Caue. Mr. John P. Harrington, a noted authority on Indian languages, their derivation and translation, states in a letter to F. W. Hodge on Nov- ember 10, 1932, regarding the native form and meaning of the word, “It is almost certain that it starts off with gaw and that it is a diminutive form of the word meaning hill or mountain. Unfortunately the Spanish loan-word Cahuenga is from the locative, and the nominative form of the place name is nowhere recorded in Spanish records.” The gaw of the Indian has never been translated as Cahu but as Cau. Mr. Adolph Rivera, historian of the Ramona Parlor, N. S. G. W. a resident of the district who has made a study of its place names, states that the only proper spelling of the word is Cauenga. ACQUISITION OF CAMPO DE CAUENGA BY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES [Reprint from ''The Clubwoman'\" November, 1923.) California History and Landmarks Club By Mrs. A.S.C. Forbes. President T^HE California History and Landmarks Club was organized in 1916 ^ with the definite object and purpose of arousing greater interest, in the American part of the history and landmarks of this State. Dif- ferent persons had from time to time attempted to save the historic spot where the Treaty of Cauenga was signed by Lieut. -Col. John C. Fremont and Gsn. Andres Pico, but through lack of information or profound indifference the general public remained passive toward the project and the site was marked only by a Camino Real Bell. The Bell was erected by the Hollywood Woman’s Club in 1910 and de- dicated by Miss Elizabeth Benton Fremont, only daughter of Col. Fre- mont. The history connected with this spot and the pathos of this lonely Bell holding vigil over the most historic event in the annals of Ameri- can-California appealed to the members of the California History and Landmarks Club with the result that a campaign was wage(^ that has lasted over seven years, but we have won and the historic spot is now owned by the City of Los Angeles. It has been placed in the Park De- partment and will be made a fitting memorial to the memory of Col. Fremont and Gen. Pico. So far we have centralized on this work, therefore, to tell of our club is to tell of this project. We took up the work laid down by Mr. Horatio Rust of South Pasadena. In 1902 when Mrs. Fremont was still living Mr. Rust circulated a petition asking the legislators of California to appropriate the small sum of one thousand dollars for a suitable monument to mark this spot. The petition was signed by the Southern California Histo^-ical Society, The Landmarks Club, the Superintendent of Schools, bankers, merchants, hotel ^men, and individuals of all classes to the number of over two hundred. The legislature passed the bill but Governor Gage vetoed it. Mr. Rust tried again at the next session but failed to obtain any favorable results. Then there arose contentions as to the validity of the location. . It was to quiet thf^ title, as it were, that first interested us. We searched Acquisition of Campo de Calenga by Los Angeles 291 the archives and found that in tlie San Fernando Mission lands there was included the tracts called \"Cahuenga”, “Encino”, “Los Alamos”, and “Calabasas.” That about the year 1800 the tract called ‘Cahuenga” was granted to one Rameriz. In 1845 Don Tomas Feliz moved to the rancho and built the adobe house near the Cahuenga Pass where the Treaty ^vas signed. Col. Fremont in his Memoirs says on Page 652 that of Cahuenga. Both Col. Fremont and his wife established the location the articles of Capitulation were made and entered into at the rancho as did Don Geronirno Lopez who carried the flag of truce. So just why there ever was any contention was and is still a mystery to us. Yet just so long as there remained any unproven step toward a complete veri- fication we could not ask the public to make purchase of this site. When our proof was comjilete we asked the State Historical Survey Commission^o make careful examination of the papers and examine the site. This was done. A written endorsement was given to us saying the proofs were “full and sufficient” to prove the validity of the site. W e again took the project of purchasing the site as memorial to Fre- mont and Pico, to the public. WY presented our pa])ers to the women’s clubs, the Native Sons and Daughters, The D. A. IL, Pioneers Society and patriotic organization. Each and all approved of our asking the business m6n to provide a manner for the purchase of the site. We took it to the Chamber of Commerce and those public-spirited men recom- mended that the })urchase be made by the City Council. The City Council referred it to the City Planning Commission for approval and investigation as to the validity of the location. The Planning Commis- sion examined our j)apers and recommended the purchase. On May 25 a resolution was j)assed by the City Council authorizing the purchase I Purchase Price was $15,000). So after seventy-seven years the peo})le of the State of California are doing a belated honor to the man who brought Peace to California and paved the way whereby the glorious state became the property of the United States. The exact location is lots 16 and 17, Universal City tract of Los Angeles. It lies opposite the Universal City Film Company plant. There are two re-enforced concrete buildings on the property but as they are most fortunately desifrned along lines similar to the original adobe house they make an attractive nucleus toward this memorial. We will gather historical relics to make the memorial irjteresting and will assist the Park De- ])artment in making the place beautiful and attractive. General Steppien W. Kearney Com. Robert F. Stockton REPORT OF COMMODORE STOCKTON '* [. Of His Operation on the Coast of the Pacifi^ .. - From Executive Document No. 1 accompanying^ President’ s Message]^ at the 2nd Session of the Thirtieth Congress, December, ( The following article is prepared and printed in acknowledgment of 'M the cooperation of the John C. Fremont High School and members ofj^ the Fremont Pioneers’ Club in the work of excavation at Casa de Cauenga) ' \", SIR: On my return from California in iNovember last, the cumstances of the times seemed to present reason for delaying full report of my transactions and operations on the coast of the^| Pacific. The period, however, has now arrived in which I feel that can, without the imputation of improper feelings or motives, lay Beforci the Executive, in a tangible and official form, a narrative of the oc*^ currences which I directed in California. It appears now to be Jioj longer questioned that I actually possessed and exercised the power of^ governor of California and commander-in-chief of the forces of ith^? Lnited States in that quarter, and that, whether rightfully or wrongj| Report of Commodore Stockton 293 fully, I executed the duties and administered the functions appertain- ing to these high offices, for the administration of which I am alone responsible. The dispatches which were from time to time addressed to the Department were designed to furnish the government with ac- curate information of what transpired, it did not enter into my purpose to give a general narrative of the entire operations. Opening a full view of the; circumtances which influenced my judgment in selecting the course ^hich was adopted, and the policy by which that course was determinedWith your permission I beg leave, at this time to perform this duty. • > • . “Undec the instructions of the Department, I arrived, in command of the Unit^ States Frigate Congress, at the harbor of Monterey about the middlef of July, 1846. The American flag was there flying. 1 immediately w'ent on board the United States frigate Savannah, then lying off that town and, in conformity with my orders, I reported myself to Commodore Sloat as forming part of the Squadron then under his command. From him I learned that in the preceding month of June, w’hile lying off Mazatlan, he had received intelligence that war had commenced between the United States and Mexico; that he had forthwith proceeded to Monterey, landed a force, and hoisted the flag of theXnited States without resistance. In the course of our inter- view% Commodore Sloat apprised me of his intention to return in a short tirne^to the United States, wherel)y the command of the squadron would devolve upon me “Previous to the departure of Commodore Sloat, he had, at my instance and upon my representations, placed at my disposal the United States sloop-of-war Cyane, as well as the forces on shore. I immediately apprised Captain Fremont, then of the topographical corps, \\\\ith w'hom I had previous communication, of the position in which I. was placed and that I had determined upon my plan of oper- ation. , “Captain Fremont and Uieutenant Gillespie, of the marine corps, had already raised a body of 160 volunteers, prepared to act accord- ing to’ circumstances. I informed those gentlemen that if they, together with the men whom they had raised, would volunteer to serve under my command so long as J should remain in California and require their services, that I would form them into a battalion, ap])ointing the former major and latter captain. These arrangements were all com- 294 Historical Society of Southern California pleted in the course of the 23rd of July, and my letters of that date to Commodore Sloat, to Commander Du Pont, and Captain Fremont, on the file in the Department, will have apprised you of my move-^ ments. 1 ■ “It was thus that the battalion of California volunteers was or- ganized, which subsequently, under its gallant officers, to’ok so patrio- tic and efficient a part in the military operations in that territory. It was received into the service of the United States to aid the navy, as essential as well to the maintenance of the position we then occupied as to execute the plans which I had contemplated in the interior. “A few days subsequently. Commodore Sloat sailed in the Levant, thus devolving upon me the command of the entire force\", both afloat and on shore. That force then consisted of the frigates Congress and Savannah, sloops-of-war Portsmouth, Cyane, and Warren, and the store ship Erie. The Portsmouth was at San Francisco, the Congress and Savannah at Monterey, the Warren was at Mazatlah, the Cyane had been sent with the California battalion to San Diego, and the Erie was at the Sandwich Islands. The force to be emplclyed on land consisted of 360 men, furnished from the Congress, provided with about 90 muskets and bayonets, some small cannon procured from the merchant-vessels, and tlie battalion of volunteers with'-the append- age of an army. “Leaving the Savannah at Monterey, for its protection, I sailed about August first, in the Congress, for San Pedro bn the way to San Pedro, we landed at Santa Barbara, of which we took posses- sion. and, leaving a small force for its defense, proceeded to'San Pedro where we arrived on the 6th of August. Here information was received of the arrival of the Cyane at San Diego, of the landing of the battalion (under Fremont) and supply of horses “Having completed arrangements which time and circumstance had permitted, and dispatched a courier to Major Fremont, appris- ing him of my movements, we commenced our march towards the camp of the enemy on the 11th of August. In the course of the afternoon of that day information reached us that the enemy's force, instead of awaiting our approach, had dispersed: that they had buried their guns, and that the governor and general had retreated, as we supposed toward Sonora. We continued our march towards Ciudad de Los An- geles, and on the 13th, having been joined bv Major Fremont with a 4 Report of Commodore Stockton 295 aI)out 120 volunteers under his command, we marched into the city, which wc/quietly occupied. “After the dispersernent of the army of tlie enemy, the flight of the general and governor-in-chief out of the territory, a number of the officers of the Mexican army were captured, and made prisoners of war. Amo;ig these were Jose Maria Flores, whose name hereafter will appear prominently, and Don Andres Pico, brother of Governor Pio Pico. These officers were released upon their parole of honor not to bear arms against the United States pending the war, unless ex- changed, >vith what fidelity they performed this obligation will appear in the sequel. The people in general came in, tendered their submis- sion to oyr authority, and promised allegiance to our government. Every indication of a hostile force had now disappeared from the country, tyanquility was restored, and I forthwith determined to or- ganize a temporary civil government to conduct public affairs and to administer justice as in time of jjeace. Various considerations promp- ted me to.^this course. It appeared that the existence of such a govern- ment, unejer the authority of the United States, would leave no pretence upon whiph it might be urged that the conquest of the country had not been j accomplished. While merely the military power exercised power, enforced its authority by martial law, and executing its func- tions through the instrumentality of a regular military force, nothing could be regarded as settled, and opj)osition to its power would be con- sidered Jawful opposition to a foreign enemy Actuated by such considerations. I \"ave mv immediate attention to the establishment, upon a permanent basis, of a civil government throughout the country, as much iti confoiinitv with the former usages of the countrv as could be done in the absence of any written code. A tariff of duties was fixed, and collectors aj)pointed. Flections were directed to be held for the various civil magistrates; Major Fremont was apj)ointed military commandant of the territory, and Captain Gillespie military comman- dant ^'of the southern department. The battalion of volunteers was ordered to be augmented to three hundred; and, contemplating soon to leave the territory, 1 determined on my de])arture to aj)point Major Fremont Governor of California. Ffe was aj)prised of these intended arrangements, and instructed to meet me in San Francisco on the 25th of Vjetober for the pur})ose of consumating them. These acts and in- 296 Historical Society of Southern California Department in rny' tentions were officially communicated to the several dispatches. “This explanation of my operations and acts will, I trust, prove '.j satisfactory to the Executive, and be a sufficient reply to Commodore j Shubrick’s charge of premature action. Having achieved the conquest'^ of the country, and finding my military strength ample to retain it,' the establishment of a civil government naturally and necessarily ^ resulted “About the 2nd of September I left Ciudad de Los Angeles, em barked on board the Congress on the 3rd, and on the 5th sailed for^^ Santa Barbara. Having taken on board the small detachment which had | been landed at that place, we proceeded to Monterey, where everything was found tranquil. The people here appeared to be quite satisfied with ! the state of affairs. Information was here received leading to the ap-.^ prehension that Sutter's settlement on the Sacramento wa§ threatened with an attack by a body of a thousand Wah-lah-wah-lah Indians. . . .”-J (Fremont was sent to treat with them, which he did with understand- ing and without force.) “About the 30th of September, a courier arrived from Captain-.’i Gillespie, despatched by that officer to convey to me the information that an insurrection had broken out at Ciudad de Los Angeles, and that he was besieged in the government-house at that place by a l^rge force. i 4 I immediately ordered Capt. Mervine to proceed in the Sqvannah San Pedro, for the purpose of affording aid to Captain Gillespie. Major Fremont was at Sacramento I sent a request to l^im forth- with to join me in San Francisco with his command, and to brjng along as many saddles as he could procure. While awaiting the arrival of Major, Fremont I despatched officers in various directions for the purpose of procuring volunteers to join the battalion and engaged the^ merchant-ship Sterling to take them down to Santa Barbara. “About the 12th of October, Major Fremont arrived ^t San Francisco, and immediately embarked on board the Sterling, with: about one hundred and sixty volunteers. He was directed to proceed. J to Santa Barbara, there to procure horses to march to Ciudad d^ Los Angeles, while I, with the Congress, was to sail to San Pedro, aq^ that route advance toward the same point. The Congress and Ster|ing«j sailed in company from San Francisco, but separated the same eveqing^ in a fog. Between San Francisco and Monterey we spoke a mercha|[lt-J Report of Commodore Stockton 297 vessel from the latter port, with dispatches from Lieutenant Maddox, apprising me that Monterey was threatened with an attack, and that he was in want of immediate assistance. We ran into the Bay of Mon- terey, landed two officers with fifty men and some ordnances. Having thus strengthened that post, I proceeded to San Pedro. On my arrival at that place, about the 23rd of October, I found the Savannah frigate. Captain iMervine informed me that Captain Gillespie, with the volun- teers under his command, was on board his vessel, having left Ciudad de Los Angeles, under a capitulation entered into with General Flores, the leader of tlie insurrection — one of the iMexican officers who, having been made prisoner of War, had been released on his parole. “Captain Mervine further informed me that, about two weeks before he had landed with his sailors and marines for the purpose of marching in conjunction with Captain Gillespie and his detachment of volunteers to Ciudad de Los Angeles. He had not carried any artillerv with him; that about twelve miles from San Pedro, he encountered a partv of the insurgents with one piece of artillery; a battle ensued; that several charges had been made upon the insurgents’ gun, but it was impossible to capture it, as, whenever he approached, they liitched their horses to it and retreated. Having sustained a loss of several men killed and wounded, he retired with his force and re-embarked. “Proper arrangements having been made during the night, in the morning we landed a strong force with several pieces of artillery, once more hoisted the flag of the Lnited States in San Pedro. The insur- gents had taken the precaution to remove l)eyond our reach every horse and all the cattle which rniglit have been available either for food or transportation. The roadstead at San Pedro was also a dangerous position for men-of-war, being exj)osed to the storms which at that season of the year rage with great violence upon the coast. This con- sideration decided me to proceed to San Diego. We did not, however, leave San Pedro until I had been compelled to relimjuish all expecta- tion of the cooperation of Major Fremont from whom I had not heard a word since we parted off San Francisco, nor until the officers and the men had become completely exhausted by their incessant duties on shore, in guarding the camp from attacks and pursuing small parties of the insurgents who approached us. Having embarked the men be- longing to the squadron, and volunteers under Captain Gillespie, I sailed for San Diego in the Congress. “On my arrival off San Diego, I received information from Lieu- 298 Historical Society of Southern California tenant Minor that the town was besieged by the insurgents, that his stock of provisions was small, and that he was in want of addi- tional forces ‘‘On the following day the !Malek Adhel, a prize to the Lnited States ship M arren, arrived from Monterey with dispatches from Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont. I thus received information from that officer that on his way to Santa Barbara he met the merchant-ship \\ andalia, from San Pedro, by whom he was informed of the state of affairs at the South; that it would be impossible for him to procure horses at Santa Barbara, in consequence of which he had proceeded to Monterey, and would employ all diligence in preparing his force to march for Ciudad de Los Angeles. ■'Lieutenant Minor was directed to send the ship Stonington, then lying in the harbor of San Diego, to Ensanado, for a supply of horses and beefs. Captain Mervine was dispatched in the Savannah to [Mon- terey. to aid Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont ■'Having accomplished the landing of the men ( at San Diego ) from the ship, the attack of the insurgents which was in progress was successfully repelled by the combined force under the command of Lieutenant [Minor and Captain Gillespie The expedition south- ward for animals, under Captain Gibson, of the battalion, had suc- ceeded in driving about ninety horses, and two hundred head of beef- cattle into the garrison. Another expedition, under command of Cap- lain Henslev, of the battalion sent to the southward for animals, re- turned with five hundred head of cattle, and one hundred and forty horses and mules. About the 3rd of December, two deserters from the insurgents, whose families lived in San Diego, reported themselves to Lieutenant [Minor. ^ hile engaged in examining one of these deserters, a messenger arrived ^cith a letter from General Kearney, of the United States army, apprising me of his approach, and expressing a wish that I would open a communication with him. and inform him of the state ot affairs in California. ■'Captain Gillespie was immediately ordered to proceed to General Kearney's Camp. He left San Diego at about half-past seven o'clock that same evenins:. takinsr with him one of the deserters to act as guide. The force that accompanied Captain Gillespie consisted of a company of volunteers, composed of Acting Lieutenant Beale, Passed [Midship- man Duncan, ten carbineers of the Congress, Captain Gibson, twenty- Report of Commodore Stockton 299 five of the battalion. Mr. Stokes, who was the bearer of the letter from General Kearnev, was also of the company. In the evening of De- cember 6th, Mr. Stokes returned to San Diego, to inform me that General Kearney, on the morning of that day, had attempted to sur- prise the insurgents, under command of Captain Andres Pico, in their camp at San Pasqual, and that he had been worsted in the action that ensued. ‘The following morning, Lieutenant Godey, of the California battalion, with two men came into San Diego with a letter from Cap- tain Turner, of the dragoons, informing me that General Kearney had had a fight with a considerable body of the Mexicans; that he had had about eighteen killed, and fourteen or fifteen wounded; and suggested the propriety of dispatching without delay, a considerable force to his assistance. Preparations were immediately made to dispatch a detach- ment for this purpose. Before, however, the advance moved, an Indian came in from General Kearney. About ten o’clock at night, Acting Lieutenant Beale, of the Congress, arrived from General Kearney’s camp, and confirmed the worst accounts we had received, and the im- })ortance of prompt assistance. 1 he advanced body, increased to the number of 215 men, was placed under the command of Lieutenant Gray, my aid-de-camp, with orders to proceed directly to the canij) of General Kearnev. The order was successfully performed, and Lieuten- ant Gray having accomplished it, returned to San Diego, accompanied bv the General The arrival of General Kearney was to me a source of gratification, although it was my decided opinion — which as yet I have seen no reason to change — - that, under the circumstances that existed, I was entitled to retain the position in which I was placed as commander-in-chief ; yet, in consideration of his high standing in the armv, his long exj)erience as a soldier, the importance of mili- tarv science and skill in the movements that were to be made in the interior of the country, 1 immediately determined to yield all personal feelings of ambition, and to place in his hands the supreme authority. In accordance with this determination. 1 tejidered to General Kearney, the position of commatuler-in-chief, and offered to accompany him as his aide. “This position was on more than one occasion renewed, and with all sinceritv and singleness of purpose I he offers thus made were, however, on everv occasion distinctly and positively declined by Cieneral Kearney, who on his side, offered to accompany me in the 300 Historical Society of Southern California capacity of my aide, and tendered to afford me the aid of his head? and hand. . “A few days before I expected to take up the line of march, addressed a note to the general, expressing a wish that he would ac-1 company me. In his reply he repeated the language which he had be-1. fore employed. After the troops had been paraded, and were nearly! ready to commence the march, as I was about to mount my horse,! General Kearney approached me and inquired who was to commands the troops. I replied. Lieutenant Rowan was to have the command^ On expressing a wish that he should himself command them, I replied,^ that he should have the command. The different officers were at < convened, and informed that General Kearney had volunteered to3 command the troops, and that I had given him the appointment, re^ serving my own position as commander-in-chief. This arrangement having been made, we proceeded on the march. “On the morning of the day we marched into Ciudad de Los AmS geles, General Kearney came to me with Mr. Southwick, ivho acting as engineer, to ascertain from me by what road I intended tc^ enter the city. He requested Mr. Southwick to mark on the sand the! position of the city, and the different roads leading into it. I selectedj the plainest and broadest road, leading into the main street of the city;j and when we marched into the city, I led the way with the advance- guard. My position as commander-in-chief was again distinctly recog-| nized in a letter of January 13, addressed to me by General Kearne)%| as Governor of California, commanding United States forces. “A few days after we had taken Ciudad de Los Angeles, Lieu-5|;s tenant-Colonel Fremont arrived with his part of the battalion “The California battalion ( Fremont’s) was organized under my| own personal direction and authority, under a special condition thatj it should act under my orders as long as I might remain in California'^ and require its services. It was paid by my orders, as long as I hadj anything to pay with. The officers derived their appointments exclu*| sivelv from me. It was never, in any form or manner, mustered into-, the service of the United States as a part of the army or connected! with it. It was exclusively and essentially a navy organization. The baM talion was entirely composed of volunteers, organized under authority, but with my own free consent, according to the terms of distinct and specific agreement to obey my orders and to serve whil^j Report of Commodore Stockton 301 ■- I should require their services. These men were not of that kind of per- sonnel which sometimes compose regular armies: they were principally free American citizens who had settled in California; they were men of respectability, of influence, and of property; they were no ordinary men, because, when told that I had offered them as pay ten dollars a month, they said that they would not accept that pay — that it would not pay their expenses — but that they would volunteer to serve under my command without compensation. “That was the origin, character, and position of the battalion when engaged, in cooperation with the squadron under my command, in accomplishing the objects which I had in view “The battalion was never placed under the command of General Kearney by me, and was not subjected to his order “7 have the honor to be, jaithjully, “} our obedient servant.

The house known in those primitive days as La Casa de Cauenga faced to the south-west. Along the front was a porch and the chimney was in the rear. The house had tile roof. In 1859 my aunt and her family proposed a picnic. We decided to go to Casa de Cauenga where Mrs. Emilia Gates lived with her husband and two children, Adelaida and Alexander Gates. The day was set. We left Los Angeles and all the guests arrived on time at La Casa de Cauenga. Those present on this occasion whom I remember were: Mr. Francis Melius and his wife Mrs. Anita Johnson de Melius the leader and family, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Melius and family, Gover- nor John G. Downey and wife, Mrs. Katie Wilson, Don Juan Bautista Trudle, Senora Adriana Johnson de Almon, Senora Carmel Cuirado de Johnson, Senora Eulalia Guillen, Senora Francisca Botello, and a maid Sta.

Los Angeles County, California. In his hovhood days his parents sent him to a private school at the Adobe House, know in those primitive days as La Casa de Cauenga. The teacher was Don F’ran(‘isco Lopez, Jr., who had received his education from the Franciscan Fhidres at Santa Barbara Mission. Alluding to data during the Mexican War. Don Geronirno Lopez relates that there were voimg and old men in the Mexican army. He remembers General Jose Maria Flores who wais in command of the Mexican annv in Southern California, with hearhpiarters at the Pueblo de Los Angeles. But he lelt prior to the American soldier's entering the Pueblo. Don Geronirno was in his eighteenth year and was a<‘ting as messenger for (ieneral Andres Pico. He remembers (ienera! Kearney, who with Iris soldiers marching to the Pue!)lo met the Mr'xican soldiers in command of Captain Juan Bautista Moreno. Both side's met on the west side, on the mesa of San Gabriel River, at Paso de Corruga. which was knowrr as El l^aso de Bai tolo. and not so lar from tire adobe house that was built in 18 H bv Don \\ icente Lugo, d he battle torjk jdace January 8. 1817. Few American soldiers were killeel. On the Mexican side Q. (?) Se})uiveda and anotlu'r known as El (iuayme'tro were killed. The Mexicans were defeated and retreated toward El Aliso Alto — the tall sycamore tree that was located on the Lugo grant. This lonely sycamore tree in the primitive days was a landmark for all travelers. It is about three miles from Los Angeles. There the Mexican soldiers made a stand. On the following day. January 9, 1817, General Kearney with his soldiers met them and they had a guerrilla skirmish. Captain Antonio Maria Lugo with his forces joined Captain Moreno, but they did not succeed, and they retreated. General Kearney with his soldiers 314 Historical Society of Southern California marched into the Pueblo. He took possession of the Mexican State bi^ilding that was located then where the St. Charles Hotel now stands, and there made his headquarters. On the morning of January 11, (1847), General Andres Pico sent for Geronimo Lopez. He came forward. General Pico said to him, ‘‘Here are these special letters. Go, and deliver them in person to Captain Lgenio Montenegro.” Captain Montenegro with one hundred soldiers had his headquarters at San Fernando Mission. \\oung Geronimo Lopez being a good horseman and knowing the country so well, he lost no time, and safely arrived at the Mission. He then ascertained the presence of Captain Lgenio Montenegro. One of the soldiers looked him up and in a few minutes Captain Montenegro made his appearance. Young Geronimo Lopez delivered the letters and waited for orders. ^ here, then the Captain said, “This letter is for me and this other letter is for Lt. -Colonel John C. Fre- mont.” Captain Lgenio Montenegro then gave orders for fifteen soldiers. The mounted soldiers came forward. T oung Geronimo Lopez was appointed to carry the “Flag of Truce.” The soldiers then traveled north and over the mountain divide. Down on the slope near Newhall they came in sight of Lt. -Colonel Fremont's camp. The guards noticed them and they were met by a few American soldiers. Captain Monte- negro explained his mission and the few Mexican soldiers were guided to the camp, where in person to Lt. -Colonel John C. Fremont the message was delivered. Lt. -Colonel Fremont answered it, and he deliv- ered a letter to Captain Montenegro, and he in turn gave it to young Geronimo Lopez. Thev then traveled back to the Mission of San Fer- nando. Then young Lopez proceeded to the headquarters of General Andres Pico and delivered him the message. The folloAs'ing dav. January 12 ( 1847 ), Lt. -Colonel Fremont and his soldiers marched to San Fernando Mission where they made camp. Captain Montenegro had departed. The next morning. Januarv 13. 184 <.

Don Geronimo Lopez 315 The superior officers, on both sides, with their aides retired a little distance for consultation to arrange favorable terms for the capitulation. They then returned to the porch of the Adobe House, known as Casa de Cauenga, and there in the presence of the Mexican and American soldiers the Mexican treaty was signed by the aides and approved by General Andres Pico and Lt. -Colonel John C. Fremont on January 13, 1847. ‘T was present-” said Don Geronimo Lopez. “T^Tiile Lt. -Colonel Fremont and his soldiers were marching to the Pueblo I, Geronimo Lopez, was sent to San Gabriel Mission with a message for the people giving them the information that the Treaty had been signed.” Then Don Geronimo Lopez returned to the Pueblo. Several days after the arrival of Lt. -Colonel Fremont at the Pueblo de Los Angeles, the Publanos (inhabitants) gave a grand ball at the Casa (house) of Don Alexander Bell, that was im the primitive days located where is now the S.E. corner of Aliso and North Los Angeles streets. The ball was given in honor of Lt. -Colonel John C. Fremont, General Kearney, Commodore Stockton, and their aides. ‘T was present and Lt. -Colonel Fremont knew me as being the one who had carried the ‘Flag of Truce.’ He came and shook hands with me,” so said Don Geronimo Lopez. And all the aristocratic Sehoras, Dons, and their families attended. The Sehoras were dolled up in their best. It was one of the grandest affairs that ever took place in the Pueblo days of Los Angeles. In conclusion, Don Geronimo Lopez adds that Lt.-Colonel John C. Fremont was known among the inhabitants as El Coronel Fla-mont, same being the sound in the Spanish language for Fremont. A ffidavit.

Villegas Mrs. John Wilson California History Nugget Mision San Diego de Alcala, Restored 1931 RESTORATION OF MISSION SAN DIEGO DE ALCALA by Albert V. Mayrhofer T^HE restoration of Mission San Diego de Alcala represents twenty * years of dreaming, planning and finally of a success which had its culminating point in the dedication of the restored structure on Sep- tember 12 and 13, 1931. It was in 1911 that the dream of the restored Mission first came to me. This idea was furthered by Rev. Joseph Mesny, oldest acting Catholic priest in San Diego Countv. and then living near the Mission. Our hopes were heightened when the late John D. Spreckles evinced great interest and assured us that if there were no obstacles he would restore the Mission. An obstacle presented itself. The late Bishop Thomas J. Comity had no practical use for the Mission and was un- willing that it should he only a museum and gathering place for the curious. Despite the lack of encouragement, men of all creeds and opin- ions gave generouslv of their time and money to })ieserve what they could of its crumbling walls and to keep its hallowed ruins still a shrine. In 1919 George W. Marston, Philip Morse, and others started a definite move to raise money for the preservation of the ruins and to go as far as possible with the restoration. The result of this activity was meager, but one important object was achieved. J'hese men suc- ceeded in saving for jiosterity the facade of the Old Mission, and, when the later restoration was made possible, this early labor of saving the facade was found to have been the real beginning of the actual and com])lete restoration. Another thing accomplished bv these men was their arousing an interest in the Old Mission which never died. The Marston committee spent more than $7500.00, and to those who made these expenditures jiossible too much credit cannot be given, for it is {lossible that without this money the entire Mission would have become long ago a heap of grass-grown debris. In 1920 the Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West held a hall in the auditorium in Balboa Park, for the benefit of the Old Mission, and more than $1000.00 was raised. This money was kept as a nucleus for the present restoration. In 1927 the matter of the restoration was taken up by myself, acting as Deputy Grand President 318 Historical Society of Southern California of the Native Sons of the Golden West, as I felt that the order should sponsor the restoration of the first landmark of California. At this time the Rt. Rev. John J. Cantwell D.D., who is Bishop Conaty’s suc- cessor in the diocese of Los Angeles and San Diego, officially ap- pointed me as the head of the restoration movement and gave me S5000.00 to start the restoration campaign. Encouraged by this au- thority, I then approached the Rev. Mother Kanian, mother superior of Nazareth House, and later on her successor, Mother Cvprian, the present mother superior, and through their -efforts the mother house of the Order at Hammersmith, England, advanced $25,000.00 as the Order’s share in the restoration work. The Sisters of Nazareth conduct a home for children which has been built near the Old Mission. Soon after this money was received, I appeared before the Officers and Delegates of the Native Sons Grand Parlor, held in San Francisco, 1929, and after a new presentation of what had become an old theme, I was gratified by their promise to give S2500.00 toward the restor- ation fund. Upon my return to San Diego I opened an appeal to the citizens to donate the money still needed to restore the Mission. The response to this appeal was most discouraging. Practically not a dollar was obtained through it. I then turned to my friend, James Wood Coffroth, with the idea of getting help from a native son and the son of a pioneer of the Mother Lode district. He gave me $5000.00. With this gift my spirits mounted. I now had almost $40,000.00 toward the restoration, and I resolved to devote every waking moment to the task to which I had been assigned. I went to Miss Ellen Brown- ing Scripps, who donated $3000.00 to the work. George ^ . iMarston, who alreadv had spent thousands of dollars in preserving the Old Mission, gave another $1000.00. The San Diego Union and Tribune, through James MacMullen, contributed 31000.00. San Diego Catholic Daughters and Knights of Columbus gave 83000.00. The Native Sons and Daughters brought their collective donations to more than $7000.00 \" Edward Hall and Col. Ed. Fletcher each contributed $500. The San Diego Clearing House Association gave $1000.00. and so did Lowerison and olstencroft. I. E. Loveless and Cave J. Couts each ?ave $600.00 and members of the San Dieso Ad Club gave individual contributions. Restoration of Mission San Diego de Alcala 319 Original Drawing by H. C. Pratt, May 1852 Let me state here that nothing is lost to tlie fund tlirough failure of a bank in which some deposits of it were held. There remains $7250.00 in that account, but Bishop Cantwell has advanced that amount of cash to the fund and taken assignment of the account. All in all, a total of $65,000.00 in cash and subscriptions was raised. When the work was put under way, it was found that increased excavations and other necessary additions to the work would add considerably to the original estimate of the cost. In fact, the restored Mission San Diego de Alcala represents an expenditure of about $80,000.00. The deficit has been protected by Bishop Cantwell, who from the beginning has been a tower of strength in bringing the restoration to a successful culmination. RESTORING CALIFORNIA’S FIRST MISSION By J. Marshall Miller (Editor’s Note: The author of this article, a member of the His- torical Society of Southern California, acted as architect’s representa- tive and sunervisor of the construction during the entire process of re- storation of Mision San Diego de Alcala in 1980-31, under the general direction of I. E. Loveless, Architect. Mr. Miller had given particular attention for several years to the history and architecture of early California, and while a student at the University of Southern California made a complete study of Mision San Diego de Alcala, including re- storation drawings and a model of the mission church.) ON September 13, 1931, one hundred and sixty-two years after the founding of the Mision San Diego de Alcala, the first Franciscan estahlisliment in Alta California, the restored church building of that mission was dedicated with a})})ropriate ceremonies by church and citizen. The religious ritual was performed under the leadership of His Grace, Most Reverend Pietro Fumisoni-Diondi, Apostolic Delegate from the Vatican. Rome. Following this ceremony a dedication was conducted by the Native Sons and Native Daughters of the Golden West, concluding with the raising of the four flags under which the State has been ruled. Thus did (hilifornia reclaim one of her most noted and historic landmarks. On Julv 16. 1769. under the guidance of Fr. Junioero Serra. Mision San Dif‘go de Alcala was founded near the shores of San Diego Ray. Two hundred and twenty-seven years haal elapsed since Cahrillo's discovery of this land-locked liarhor. 3'he Spanisli colonial frontier moved very .‘^lowlv' in the direction of (.alifornia, and no definite attempt was launched in this direction until the encroachments of Russia in the north and the exjieditions of England in the Pacific had forced Spanish officials to admit the need of colonies to assure pos- session. In accordance with a j)lan formulated by Jose de Galvez, Inspec- tor Oneral for New S}>ain, with the cooperation of Father Serra, who was then in charge of missionary work in Baja California, the Fran- ciscan order was chosen to undertake colonization and civilization of Alta California through the establishment of a chain of missions along its coast. 7’he founding of the first mission was marked by a simple cere- monv on the small hill to the south of the river, later knowm as Historical Society of Southern California Presidio Hill. This site the Indians called “Cosoy,” and here the first chapel was built of poles and tules. The first location proved unsatis- factory for missionary endeavor because of the lack of water and resultant poor crops, and continued interference with the Indians by the presidio soldiers. In 1774, therefore, a new and permanent site was selected at a place known by the Indians as “Nipaguay,” about six miles up the San Diego valley. During the first year at the new site, there were erected a number of structures, including a church of poles and tules which served the new establishment until the Indian uprising of 1775 when the entire group of buildings was destroyed by fire. A new church was built of adobe in 1776. After four years of service this was outgrown and a larger church took its place in 1780, This structure, with walls of adobe and roof of tules and mud, served as a place of worship for twenty-eight years. The erection of the last and largest church of the mission was commenced on September 29, 1808. After five years of labor it was completed and dedicated on November 12, 1813, the feast day of Saint Diego de Alcala. Father Jose Bernardo Sanchez was in charge of the mission during this period, and to him might be attributed the design and supervision of the building. Mision San Diego enjoyed its greatest prosperity in the years from 1820 to 1825. Following the decree of secularization of 1833, the mission soon ceased its religious functions. In 1847, during the Ameri- can occupation of San Diego, the mission buildings were chosen by the United States Army as suitable barracks. During the occupation by the soldiers, the structure suffered many changes. Several partitions of adobe were erected, and a second floor was built to provide sleep- ing quarters for the soldiers. Space on the main floor was used as stables for the horses. The shingle roof replaced the weakened and delapidated tile roof. Additional doors and windows were cut through the thick adobe walls, all of which hastened the later ruin of the church structure. From the time of the evacuation by the soldiers in 1858, the pro- cess of ruination, both by man and ;by the elements, was rapid. By 1900 all that remained of the once splendid building was the front wall, the campanario base, and a few straggling sections of other walls. Restoring California’s First Mission 323 Fr. Antonio Ubach, during his forty years of custody of the mis- sion (1866-1907 ) cherished the hope of restoring the church, but his plans were never carried out. The San Diego Mission Restoration com- mittee in 1920 uncovered many of the old foundations and rebuilt some portions of the walls. This partial restoration was largely inac- curate due to the lack of sufficient research, and eventually had to be removed to give place to more authentic work. An organized movement for the restoration of the mission church along strictly historical lines was started in 1927, and funds were made available through combined efforts of interested groups and citizens throughout the state. After four years of constant endeavor, the re- storation w'as finally started on July 16, 1930, the 161st anniversarv of the founding. Since the structure was almost entirely in ruin, and data was meager and widely scattered, the process of collecting information, although fascinating, was slow. Other missions of the chain, parti- cularly those which have not been restored, were particularly fruitful sources of study, as they exhibited details of material and construc- tion which are typical of California mission architecture, although the individual designs vary considerably. The principal sources of material relative to early California and the missions are the files and libraries of organizations and societies which have been collecting data for many years. Among these are the California State Historical Association, the Historical Society of Southern California, the San Diego Historical Society, and the Society of California Pioneers. Other valuable sources in this w'ork are the public and university libraries, as well as private collections of pio- neer families. The material of highest value, in which we placed the greatest confidence from an architectural standpoint, was pictorial in nature, consisting of five or six sketches of the mission made before 1865, when most of the church building was still standing; and also several hundred photographs taken since that time at various stages of destruction and decay. Of special value were photographs taken by Watkins and Houseworth, and those taken by Turrill and Vischer, There are excellent collections of early photographs in the possession of several present-day photographers, among them C. C. Pierce, the Pacific Stereopticon Company, and H. P, Webb, all of Los Angeles; and Herbert R. Fitch of San Diego. 324 Historical Society of Southern California From a Daguerrotype Made About 1865 C. C. Pierce Restoring California’s First Mission 325 The major source of information was, of course, the mission ruin itself. A complete and accurate survey was made of the grounds and remaining ruins before proceeding with any excavations. All existing fragments of walls, foundations, and details were carefully measured and photographed. Principal among the remnants of the original church structure was the front wall with its buttress-wings extending toward the vallev, and the main doorway with window above, both of which had been partlv boarded up for many years. To the west of the front wall stood a portion of the baptistry with tile-arched entrance intact and adjoining this, the remains of the cobblestone tower base Two short flights of tile steps remanied to mark openings to the north- west wall, one set leading from the nave of the church to the ceme- tery, the other from tiie sanctuary to the sacristy. In the east front cor- ner, a second complete doorway was found opening from the church toward the living quarters of the main wing of the mission quad- rangle. Several fragments of wall still stood above the foundation level, and these, as well as the cobblestone foundations themselves, which remained in their entirety, were carefullv checked and mea- sured. All our finditms were carefully compared with previous surveys of the mission. The \".Alemany Plat” of 1862, the survey by Dr. Owen C. (iov in 1920. and the delineations ol Kexford Newcomb and Frances Rand Smith all served as valualde reference material. While discussing the extent of the ruins it may be of interest lO note brief! V the plan of the ♦mtire mission establishment and the re- lation of the different units to each other and to the site. As was ty{)ical of most of the missions, the buildings were arranged in a large (juadrangle about a courtyard or patio. At San Diego, the church foinied the northwest side of the (juadrangle, and faced almost directlv southwest as did the main wing ol the mission (|uarters which extended eastward from the Iront (d the church. In this main wing were the reception rooms, the padres (juarters, and rooms for guests, visitors, and the mission guard. I he southwest side of the (quadrangle was given over to shops and storerooms, with corrals adjoining the.se on the southwest toward the river. The fourth and rear side of the guadrangle was divided into dwelling quarters for the neophytes, with separate units for the young men and young women and for the mar- ried couples. The entire establishment occupied an elevated slope of ground 326 Historical Society of Southern California on the north side of the river, overlooking a large fertile stretch of valley where the padres planted their orchards and gardens. The minor buildings around the quadrangle fell into disuse and ruin many years before the church. By 1880 only a small portion of the walls of the main front wing still remained intact, and at present only one room of this unit, that one nearest the church, still stands. With the collapsing of the walls of these buildings, adobe has covered all the floors, foundations, and lower sections of the walls, forming a new and higher ground level and burying any details or objects which are below this new level. In the few excavation tests made at different points of the enclosure, old tile floors and foundations were found to be in a remarkable state of preservation. It has often been suggested that these foundations and floors be excavated for display to visitors, but it is more logical that these valuable details and fragments re- mained undisturbed until the restoration of these buried units becomes possible. Once uncovered and laid at the mercy of the elements and of curio collectors, it would be only a short time before the ruination of these remaining portions would be complete. Excavation of the area covered by the mission church was a process which proved exceedingly fascinating. During the removal of debris, many interesting discoveries were made of buried portions of the building hitherto unknown or only indefinitely approximated. On the tiled terrace or porch which is directly in front of the church between the two buttress-wings which extend at a right angle toward the valley, were found the remnants of several sections of tile walls. These walls were not a part of the original church, but formed a three-arched arcade or vestibule which was added at a later time. To provide support for the rafters of the roof over this arcade, a row of large holes had been cui. into the front wall of the church about 17 feet above the floor. During the military occupation in the ’fifties, this arcade was divided into several rooms and another new roof built, for which a second row of rafter holes was cut in the facade some two feet below the first row. These holes obscured or destroyed many decorative details of the facade, showing clearly that the arcade roofs were not integral parts of the original facade. The main doorwav fortunatelv remained almost intact, as did much of the detail on the lower part of the front wall. The single win- dow in the upj)er section over the doorway yielded some important Restoring California’s First Mission 327 discoveries. Upon removing the wooden window frame from the open- ing, a section of the original tile-arch of the window head was brought to light. By studying this fragment and projecting its curves, the shape of the entire original opening w'as determined. The window was found to be quite narrow and high, unlike all the others of the building. In its exterior sill appeared a small niche, which had been filled with adobe probably at the time the window w«s enlarged. Upon removal of the wooden beams over the inside of the window opening, another perfect tile arched head was found. The arched window opening viewed from the interior seems noticeably off center. The base of the campanario was carefully examined for clues which might lead to a solution of the original shape of the bell tower. The top of the base had been filled and leveled off, probably about 1894, to make a platform for the big recast bell which was placed there at that time. Upon removing this fill the tile floor beneath was uncovered and the outline of the campanario footing clearly shown. It consisted of a wall 4 feet in thickness across the front, with a low- tile parapet bordering the side and rear of the tower base. The shape of these unearthed foundations indicated that the campanario could have been of one possible form only, that of the heavy pierced-wall type, and not a square tower. The campanario base, with tile floor and railing mentioned above, provided an elevated platform for the canipanero or bell- ringer. Evidence of some sort of stairway leading to this platform was carefully sought. One of the earliest photographs of the west wall revealed a faint outline of the treads and risers of a stairw'ay where they abutted the wall. Upon excavating next to this portion of the wall, the entire cobblestone foundation of a stairway w-as discovered, with the first tile step complete, thus disclosing the exact location and di- mensions of this feature. Another interesting feature brought to light w'as the stairw^ay and entrance to the choir balcony. The doorw-ay into this balcony was ori- ginally from an exterior stairw^ay. The doorway was closed up with adobe bricks about the time of the soldiers’ occupancy. Upon removing these bricks the entrance was revealed in all its original charm. Three steep steps led through the thick adobe w^all; the entrance walls re- tained tlieir mellowed j)laster: and overhead were tlie original wooden beams across the top of the doorway. There was no trace of the lower 328 Historical Society of Southern California portion of this stairway, but by working downward from the upper steps in the wall, the remainder of the stairway was recreated. Differing somewhat from the usual practice, all final plans and detailed drawings were drawn at the site. This was quite imperative in order to permit constant reference to the ruins themselves, and to make a complete and accurate record of newlv unearthed portions of the structure before they could suffer any disturbance. The number of irregularities of design, construction and workmanship made it desir- able to do all drafting on the mission grounds. Perhaps the most fascinating work was the actual construction, especially the handling of the different materials, their selection, pro- cesses of making and varied methods of use in different portions of the project. For the structural units where the loads and stresses were the greatest, and where a lasting material was desirable to assure perman- ence and durability, reinforced concrete was used. The design and ap- pearance of the building was in no way affected by the use of this modern material, and the result is a building which will resist disin- tegration and minimize upkeep costs. The most interesting material used in mission construction is adobe. The adobe bricks, averaging in size about 3 x 10 x 20 inches, the dimensions varying in different sections of the country, are made from the adobe clav which abounds in this part of the state, and which has qualities verv similar to those of ordinary clay. The process of making adobe bricks is very simple. The clay is very hard and of a gravish-brown color when dry. It is first soaked well with water to make it plastic. A pile of clay is then shoveled to the place of mixing, usually a hollow in the ground, and after the desired plasticity has been obtained by mixing with water, a quantity of straw is added. The mixing is carried on by hand, with a hoe-shaped instrument, aided by the bare feet of the mixer. W hen thoroughly mixed, the mud is trans- ported to a level jiiece of ground wiiere it is formed into brick-shaped blocks by the use of wood moulds into which the mud is packed, kneaded, and smoothed off with the hands. The bricks are then dried in the sun, this recjuiring usually from one to three weeks, depending on weather conditions. The straw prevents checking and cracking dur- ing the drying process. When the bricks are dry they become hard and are then ready for use. The laying of such bricks is similar to the RESToriLNC California’s First Mission 329 laying of present-day common bricks, except that the adobe bricks are laid in a mortar of adobe clay. Tiles for roofs, floors, and walls are made in a similar manner, except for the addition of a small quantity of sand to the initial mix- ture. \\'vhen dry these are kiln-burned, which makes them especially hard, durable, and resistant to water. Upon burning, the color of the adobe changes to a dull brownish-red. The irregularities so noticeable in all mission tile work result primarily from the fact that the mould- ing and shaping is done by hand, and further from the crude methods of laying the already varying tiles. These irregularities, however, enhance rather than detract from the charm of the mission structures. ood and timberwork are quite essential in the mission type of building. Wood is principally used for ceiling beams and boarding, roof trusses and rafters, window grilles, shutters, and doors. At the Mision San Diego the heavy wooden ceiling beams and balcony beams, the sizes of which vary from 12 x 12 inches to 12 x 14 inches in cross section by 26 feet in length, are hand-hewn, as are the timbers which form the lintels over doors and windows. In these buildings two kinds of woods were customarilv used. For the bulk of the interior wood- work, such as beams, lintels, ceiling, etc., a local wood was used. In those places where exposure to the elements demanded great dura- bi"
