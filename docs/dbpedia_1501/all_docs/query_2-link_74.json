        "text": "If you want to know just how impressive freshman guard Reed Sheppard has been for Kentucky, pay attention to a message Kentucky assistant coach Orlando Antiguaâs daughter, Olivia, made on X (formerly Twitter) Tuesday night.\n\nKentucky was destroying Miami in the second half on its way to a 95-73 rout of the No. 8 Canes when she wondered âhow do I tell my boyfriend heâs longer my favoriteâ from London, Kentucky.\n\nHowever, my guess is that her boyfriend should understand because I have a feeling the majority of Kentucky basketball fans have the freshman guard as their favorite player right now.\n\nHe was sensational again Tuesday as he led UK with 21 points â he was 5-for-9 from 3-point range â and also had five rebounds, four assists, three steals and one blocked shot in 30 minutes. He had to carry a bigger load the second half after D.J. Wagner was injured in the first half and did not return but Sheppard was more than equal to the challenge.\n\nâI think he is the most complete basketball player on this roster,â ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said about Sheppard. âHe is an excellent defender. He is a guarantee of two or three steals per game. He has about as pretty a jump shot as you are going to see.\n\nâHe just has a complete game. One of the most impressive things is he is a two-way player. Heâs not the greatest athlete you will see but he knows how to position himself and he has great hands (on defense). His shot preparation is also so good.â\n\nMiami coach Jim Larranaga has seen a lot of terrific college basketball players. He left Rupp Arena very impressed with the former Kentucky Mr. Basketball.\n\nâHeâs so good at everything. I mean he can shoot it, he can handle it, he can pass it. He finds the open man great and he defends. You might look at him and think that okay, he’s not that athletic. You try to score on him, but heâs moving his feet using his hands and doing a great job at the defensive end of the floor as well,â Larranaga said.\n\nâHe comes up with a lot of deflections and steals as well. He had four assists and one turnover and then (Rob) Dillingham had nine assists and no turnovers. Thatâs a pretty good night from your bench. They donât start.â\n\nThe good thing about Sheppard is that statistics are meaningless. What matters to him is winning.\n\nâI do everything I can to help my team to make the right play. With these dudes around me, it is easy. We were hitting shots left and right tonight and everyone was passing and having fun,â Sheppard said.\n\nKentucky had a chance for a top 10 win earlier this season against Kansas but let a six-point lead slip away in the final three minutes. This time it did not waste a chance to get a win that will be important on a NCAA Tournament resume.\n\nâWe are going to enjoy this win tonight. Then get back at it tomorrow. We knew we had a good team and now we know for sure we have a good team,â Sheppard said. âWe just need to keep doing the little things, keep sharing the ball, keep passing it around. It’s going to be a fun season.â\n\nCalipari credits Sheppard for the work he has put in at UK to improve.\n\nâHe was never a knock-down shooter (in high school),â Calipari said. âYou know what heâs done, he lives in that gym. He works and heâs made himself, kind of like Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander) and some of these other kids that Iâve had, they build their own confidence.â\n\nTuesdayâs Rupp Arena crowd undoubtedly helped build that confidence also.\n\nâThe crowd was unbelievable. I donât think they sat down. It was so loud,â Sheppard said. âFrom the first possession to the last possession, they made a huge impact on the game. They made it tough for Miami to run plays. It will be a moment we will never forget.â"
