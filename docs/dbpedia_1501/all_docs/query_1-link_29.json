Recently, I had the pleasure of joining Tyler Moak, Nilanjan Mukherjee, MBA, and Michael Crowley, from Bio-Rad, BioPharma West region for an unforgettable sailing adventure. 👥 One of the most beautiful aspects of our sailing trip was the way it brought us together as a team. Sailing isn't just about navigating the waters; it's about working together, communicating effectively, and trusting each other. These are the same qualities we value at our company, and experiencing them firsthand outside of the office only reinforces their importance. 🌟 Our sailing adventure wasn't just about relaxation and enjoyment (although there was plenty of that!). It was also about fostering stronger bonds and promoting team chemistry. These are invaluable assets in any professional setting, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to strengthen them with such an amazing group of colleagues. 🎥 Check out the highlight video of our sailing trip below! Get ready to see teamwork, camaraderie, and a whole lot of fun in action 🤪. Here's to finding the perfect balance between work and play! https://lnkd.in/gJe8B8xk #TeamBuilding #SailingAdventure #WorkLifeBalance\n\n𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝟒 𝐨𝐟 𝟓𝟐 /// 𝐈𝐭 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐬 𝐚𝐬 𝐢𝐟 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐠𝐨 𝐮𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐝 Matteo’s dad’s team has won the F1 drivers’ championship this year. He looks so happy seeing his dad with the rest of the crew celebrating on tv. Look at him smile. And knowing that his dad will be home next week, he couldn’t be happier. But when should I tell him about next season? That the F1 calendar will feature a record 23 races across a period of just over eight months. There will be double and triple-headers which means marathon travel for team staff. His dad will be away for weeks, perhaps even months in a row. How should I answer Matteo’s difficult questions this time: “𝐼𝑠 𝑚𝑦 𝑑𝑎𝑑 𝑠𝑎𝑓𝑒? 𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑖𝑠 ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑒? 𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑖𝑠 ℎ𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑤? 𝑊𝑖𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑒 𝑏𝑒 ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑚𝑦 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑑𝑎𝑦? 𝑊ℎ𝑦 𝑑𝑜𝑒𝑠 ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑚 𝑎𝑠𝑘 ℎ𝑖𝑚 𝑡𝑜 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑙 𝑠𝑜 𝑚𝑢𝑐ℎ? 𝐶𝑎𝑛’𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑦 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒?” How should I respond when he is scared or feels alone: “𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑑𝑜 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑠 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑜 𝑜𝑢𝑟 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑑𝑎𝑑 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑜𝑡 ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒?

𝐼 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠 ℎ𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝑑𝑎𝑦…” How many times will I allow myself to tell a little white lie next season while in reality there are oceans between them? “Dad is working late the next couple of weeks and he has to start early every day, so you won’t see him.” Does the organization even realize what impact this schedule has on the team crew and their families involved? It feels as if our sacrifices go unnoticed. _ _ _ 🌍 Expat Valley is the global expert on successful international family relocations.

My friend and coach Julio \"Runner\" Molina is off to run the marathon of Río Boedo, at Bascones de Ojeda in northern Spain this Sunday. What makes this race particularly unique is that the village is home to 178 inhabitants and the local mare is the village doctor - who is passionate about running. This race attracts many die-hards from the various corners of Spain. Julio will be travelling 600 km with 3 other friends for this event. As the village doesn’t have a local gym or large building, the locals will offer their houses so the participants (around 60) can shower after the race. Furthermore, the villagers will manage the water stations and be involved in the whole event! You don’t have to aim to run Boston, NY or London right? Even a small and unassuming location can be the perfect setting for your challenge. What is worth remembering is that we need to set these challenges and goals to keep our focus and to support our own fitness and lifestyle. This location is on my list of “must run for 2024” Do you have an event planed? _________________________________________________________________________________ Hi! I'm Hec.

I spent around 80 hours walking - reaching 385 kilometres within two months, finally on 15th place. Is it a good or bad results? Should I be proud? I am #proud💙 Not only for myself but also for those who actively support my goal: 🫶Agata Dudziak thank you for remote walking together - seems there is no any obstacles for those who really want support others 🫶Beata Bogdan-Pierzchała thank you for walking together onsite and reaching the last kilometres My 🥇goes to Agnieszka Grubczak who is leading #ActiveNordeaCommunity and is responsible for making this challenge happen. In all difficult moments I thought about your smile, optimism, enthusiasm and unlimited trust🫶 Was it #easy to get this result - NOT - not for me who is a #reader rather than #walker. Was it #worth to do it - definitely YES - I am full of #proudness, #happiness, #positivevibes. Do I love walking - NO Do I care my health - YES Do I enjoy #togetherness -YES It is awesome to do what we love, but sometimes it is worth to do what we need. Maybe we love it, maybe not. But it will be done🍀 The funny thing was how I moved my goal - firstly want to be in 40, then in 20, finally fighting of 15th place up to the last minute. And, what a surprise, it wasnt a competition with others. I competed mostly with myself - my laziness, other passions, easier tasks. In this context I won💙 Thank you those who support💙 #challenge #competition #collaboration #support\n\nMy Cycling Adventure in Italy: A Journey of Connection and Learning What Happened: 🛣️ Embarked on a 750 km cycling adventure through Italy. 🚴 Met a diverse group of cyclists Elizaveta Demyanenko and few others during one of the legs of my journey. How These People Helped: 🤝 Sense of Belonging: The group welcomed me warmly, making me feel like part of their community. 🗳️ Democratic Decision-Making: Ensured all voices were heard and agreed on common actions without imposing decisions. 🌍 Local Guidance: Helped me understand local customs and traditions. 🎫 Practical Assistance: Assisted in booking tickets, navigating travel hassles, and finding the best travel options. 🌟 Supportive Environment: Offered continuous support and encouragement throughout the journey. Where We Met: 🏞️ Encountered the group during a cycling rest stop in a small Italian village. Learnings: 🌐 Cultural Understanding: Importance of connecting with people to understand and respect their culture. ❤️ Empathy and Collaboration: Learned how empathy and mutual respect can lead to effective teamwork. 🌟 Networking Beyond Business: Realized that true networking is about forming genuine human connections. 🌍 Adapting to New Environments: Emphasized the need to adapt and integrate into new cultural settings. 🫂 Community Spirit: Experienced the power of community and collective support. Looking forward to more such enriching encounters during my stay in Europe. #Networking #CulturalExchange #CyclingAdventure #TravelDiaries #Leadership #Empathy #Teamwork #TravelWithMe #LearningJourney #Collaboration #EuropeTrip\n\n👉 This one was a hard one too post 🏃♂️ I ran a marathon as a bet 💸 💸 💸 ◾ I've been taking a lot away from other people on LinkedIn sharing their personal experiences and so here is my attempt. ◾ A few years ago, after returning from a holiday to Thailand, I made a bet with my sister in-law that I could run a marathon without any training. ◾ I'd heard that if the Human body was in a life or death situation that it could run over 200km.... So for me 42.2km would be physically possible. That was my logic, and I didn't even fact check the information. With no preparation I was able to finish and this is what I learnt: 👉 We are capable of more than we think - We place mental barriers in front of ourselves and wait for someone else to do it first to let us know it's possible. I'd previously only ever ran 5km, but I was able to shift this mindset from a hearing one statement \"were capable of over 200km's\". 👉 You don't need all the expensive tools, tech or gear - I was running in $10 trainers from Bali. There's so much new tech out there, that we are becoming dependent on the next big thing. Solutions don't always need to rely on sophisticated and expensive hardware. 👉 Create small goals and don't be overwhelmed by the big picture - I first got cramp in my legs around the 18km mark and with 24.2km remaining I would cramp every couple of km's. So I focused on the checkpoint flags and getting my body to the next one rather than the finish line. Set small targets to achieve the big picture. 👉 It's rare to be 100% prepared and know all the answers - The night before the race I'd ate McDonalds for dinner and then threw down some Starburst the morning of the race. There were a lot of other people with gel packs and better preparation. But I was still able to complete the race. You might not always know the answers in the workplace or be 100% prepared going into a meeting or interview. But chances are you will get through it and have a lot more in you than you think. #work #marathon #fitness #threatintelligence #simplycybercommunitychallenge #perthwa #running\n\nLAUGHTER, the best medicine when facing through tough challenges (and mud!) 😂 Laughter is not just a great companion but essential support for both challenging ultra marathons and the demanding business race. Last weekend I embarked on my last ultra marathon for 2023 - 33 miles and 8,500 feet of elevation in 8 hours from Prestatyn beach to the summit of the Welsh mountain Cyrn y Brain, along the very undulating Offa’s Dyke ancient path. As the photo shows, there was plenty of mud along the route. 🤣 As I ploughed through ankle deep mud, I just laughed at myself, thinking “surely this is not how to spend a Sunday ?” 🤔 Laughter helps me through tough challenges and build a positive can-do attitude. Just as ultra marathons challenge our physical and mental stamina, the business world challenges our professional mettle. Businesses that embrace laughter create an environment where challenges are viewed as opportunities, and hurdles are a chance to thrive. Laughter acts as our 'mental hydration station'. It refreshes our mindset, toughening our resolve and helps us bounce back stronger after a setback. Using the marathon metaphor to its limits (sorry 😂), humour opens up our stride, paving the way for creative breakthroughs. In the race against market demands, a positive mindset, fuelled by laughter propels us forward, leaving competitors in the dust (or stuck in the mud !). How do you use laughter to help you ?
