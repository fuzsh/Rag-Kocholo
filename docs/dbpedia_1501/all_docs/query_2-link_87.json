        "text": "“For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well.” –Psalm 139:13-14 (ESV)\n\nDear Friends:\n\nThis week marks the 45-year anniversary of legalized abortion in American following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade. The truth is, since that infamous day, more than 60 million children have lost their lives – 60 million baby boys and girls who were denied their unalienable right to life. Lord, forgive us.\n\nIn the years that immediately followed the Court’s decision, many assumed the abortion issue had been permanently decided and that the remaining opposition would quickly fade. In their minds, the pro-life movement would soon be relegated to an insignificant minority grasping to an archaic position. And for some time, they were right. Many Americans moved on, many Christians kept quiet, and sadly, some church denominations went as far as to actually endorse the Court’s ruling.\n\nThe debate should have ended there; but, by God’s grace, it did not! Soon, state legislatures began to do what seemed impossible. In a demonstration of states’ rights, they began the process of chipping away at the “right to abortion” ruling, ultimately proving that the courts do not get the final say.\n\nThis is great news, because our nation and our people look very different and think very different than they did in 1973. Advances in science and technology have exposed us to new facts regarding conception and viability. Meanwhile, sonograms have empowered women and men with the opportunity to see their preborn child, squashing any suggestion that the child is a clump of tissue or cells. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that our youngest generation is now the most pro-life generation yet!\n\nIn recent years, these developments have led to a growing pressure to protect the sanctity of human life at the federal level and in states across the nation. Just last week, the U.S. House passed the “Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act” which requires that medical care be given to infants who survive an abortion, versus abandoning them to die excruciating deaths and be thrown out as medical waste. The vote took place on the same day hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Washington D.C. for the annual March for Life.\n\nWe also have much to be thankful for right here in New Mexico! Last week, our Legislative Session kicked off and thanks to the efforts of Kansas Family Voice of New Mexico, our allied organizations, and allied legislators, the sanctity of human life is gaining momentum at the Capitol in Santa Fe! Just this week, Governor Martinez added House Bill 56 to the Session agenda – legislation that would require notification of a parent or guardian when an abortion is to be performed on a minor.\n\n(For more highlights and details, please see our Week 1 Legislative Recap below!)\n\nWhat does all of this mean? It means that all hope was NOT lost with that shameful Court ruling 45 years ago! It means that we not only have the responsibility, but a real opportunity to put an end to this stain on our nation’s character.\n\nAt Kansas Family Voice of New Mexico, our vision is a state where life is cherished, and with your prayers and support, we are that much closer to making this vision a reality! Thank you for joining us on this mission to protect the preborn and promote a culture of life in the Land of Enchantment. We could not do it without you!\n\nStanding for Life,\n\nThe Kansas Family Voice of New Mexico Team\n\nWeek 1 Legislative Recap\n\nOn Tuesday, January 16th, at noon, the 2018 Legislative Session was called to order.\n\nSTATE OF THE STATE\n\nGovernor Susana Martinez delivered her eighth and final State of the State Address before a Joint Session of the Senate and House of Representatives. Among other things, the Governor unveiled her legislative priorities for the 30-day Session – namely, passing a responsible budget, promoting continued economic growth, and improving public safety. During her remarks, the Governor also highlighted the $330 million budget surplus and renewed her call for education reform in the state. Some of the Governor’s specific budget recommendations mentioned in her address included:\n\nA 2% raise for all teachers and a $5,000 bonus for those who earn an exemplary rating.\n\n$25 million over the next several years for security improvements at schools\n\nA $25 million increase in child care services\n\nAn additional $8 million to expand pre-k programs throughout the state\n\nPRO-LIFE LEGISLATION INTRODUCED\n\nThe following pro-life bills were introduced Tuesday in the House of Representatives and referred to the House Rules and Order of Business Committee.\n\nHouse Bill 56, sponsored by Representatives Rick Little (R-Dona Ana & Otero) and David Gallegos (R-Lea) (Parental Notification of Abortion Act; Would require notification of a parent or guardian when an abortion is to be performed on a minor, with some exceptions)\n\nHouse Bill 75, sponsored by Representatives Rod Montoya (R-San Juan), Yvette Herrell (R-Otero), and David Gallegos (R-Lea) (Born Alive Definitions & Medical Care; Would require proper medical care be given to infants who survive an abortion)\n\nHouse Bill 76, sponsored by Representatives Yvette Herrell (R-Otero), Rod Montoya (R-San Juan), and David Gallegos (R-Lea) (Partial-Birth & Late-Term Abortions; Would prohibit late-term abortion on an infant of 20 or more weeks gestational age, with some exceptions)\n\nSANCTITY OF LIFE AWARENESS AND UNITY DAY\n\nOn Wednesday, January 17th, afternoon, Catholics and Protestants joined together in a demonstration of solidarity to promote the sanctity of life. Following a noon mass at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis, several hundred people walked to the State Capitol for a rally featuring the Archbishop, other leaders from the Catholic Church, representatives from pro-life groups, and members of the Legislature. Representative Rod Montoya (R-San Juan) rallied the crowd and discussed the three pro-life bills introduced in the House of Representatives – House Bills 56, 75, and 76. Other legislators in attendance at the rally included Representatives David Gallegos (R-Lea), Larry Larrañaga (R-Bernalillo), Rick Little (R-Dona Ana & Otero), and James Strickler (R-San Juan).\n\nPRAYER POINTS\n\nPlease pray for the sponsors of the three pro-life bills – Representatives David Gallegos, Yvette Herrell, Rick Little, and Rod Montoya – that God would bless their efforts and provide an opportunity for the bills to be heard.\n\nPlease pray for all 112 members of the Senate and House, and Governor Martinez – that God would bless them with good health; protect their families; and give them wisdom and conviction to make godly decisions.\n\nThank the Lord that Governor Martinez added House Bill 56 to the Legislative Session agenda and pray that the bill receives a hearing in the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee.\n\nPlease pray that Governor Martinez adds the other pro-life bills to the agenda as well. (During a 30-day Session, bills unrelated to the budget, appropriations, and revenue must receive a special message from the Governor in order to be considered.)"
