        "text": "The purpose of this study is to provide an ethnohistoric and ethnographic assessment of selected American Indian communities along the OST. Text from the initial study design is provided in this and the next three sections of this chapter. It is important to understand the two events at which this project is being and will be discussed. There is a larger effort designed to provide data which potentially can be used in the management the Old Spanish National Historic Trail, which was placed in National Trails System by an act of Congress in 2002. The current study, however, is limited in scope to a few American Indian tribes who lived along the trail when it was being used for pack-trains between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Los Angeles, California.\n\nThis report is written in order to fulfill the overall requirements of the TEA-21 (Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century) mandates and specifically to provide an ethnographic consulting report for the District 7 TEA Archaeological Roadside Inventory Project. This report is one of two ethnographic reports written for the District 7 region comprising Los Angeles County and Ventura County. This report specifically concerns ethnographic findings in the Ventura county portion of the D-07 region.\n\nThe Museum of New Mexico monitored construction activities along Old Santa Fe Trail from Paseo de Peralta to Berger Street, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for the New Mexico State Highway Department August through October 1976. The historic artifacts from nine features along the Old Santa Fe Trail convey that this stretch of the road has been the site of continuous residential occupation for at least 100 years. Early commercial use of this road is also present.

The surveys were intended to elicit information concerning culturally significant plant gathering sites and other sites with contemporary cultural significance to Native Americans who are indigenous to the Caltrans D7 Los Angeles County project area. The project roads consist of approximately 400 miles of county roadway. Along the corridors on both sides of the highways, the roads were surveyed for culturally significant plants and other Native American traditional cultural properties visible above ground, extending approximately fifty feet from the highway right-of-way. The survey team identified a total of 106 species of culturally significant plants growing along the project roadways. The culturally significant plants have been recorded and mapped as “Gathering Places” (GP) with information describing the highway and gathering site.\n\nTaos Pueblo, a Northern New Mexico Pueblo, is designated as a World Heritage Site that continues to engage in traditional cultural practices. Because it is a living community practicing traditional customs, it is considered a living heritage site. Living heritage refers to the continuity of tangible and intangible heritage that is maintained by the core-community. Western conservation approaches have rarely integrated community-based strategies when protecting dynamic cultural sites. The purpose of this research is to explore conservation strategies at Taos Pueblo and how they reflect a living heritage approach. Using Rapid Ethnographic Assessment Protocol (Taplin, Scheld, & Low, 2002), I worked closely with the community by immersing myself in the culture through an emic perspective. I conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 residents of Taos Pueblo; the questions referred to preservation processes, restoration projects, preservation of the Tiwa language, sacred ceremonies, and...\n\nProduced along the Río de la Plata during the nineteenth century, shipped to Havana, and consumed by African slaves, the salt-cured beef known as tasajo affected both of those places and, to some degree, the Atlantic world in general. Initial exploration of the tasajo trail that connected Buenos Aires and Cuba employs primary sources such as nineteenth-century descriptions and shipping records to characterize the landscapes, places, routes, and agents of the largely unexplored research territory of that anomalous commodity: one that, unlike others such as sugar, slaves not only produced but also consumed; one that underpinned more prominent, latitudinal transatlantic flows such as the slave trade, yet itself flowed meridionally; one that, like all those flows, had an oceanic component that comprised an actively lived space of flows rather than a dead space of separation; and one that might be mundane, yet helped fuel major transformations of two of the principal nodes of Hispanic Atlantic. Producida en las riberas del Río de la Plata durante el siglo diecinueve, despachada a La Habana, y consumida por esclavos Africanos, la carne de res curada de sal y llamada tasajo tuvo un impacto sobre ambos lugares y, de cierto modo, sobre el mundo Atlántico en general. Esta exploración inicial del sendero tasajo que conectó Buenos Aires y Cuba utiliza fuentes primarias tal como descripciones y documentos de embarcación del siglo diecinueve para caracterizar el paisaje, los lugares, las rutas y los intermediarios del territorio de investigación en gran parte inexplorado de esta mercadería anómala. Una mercadería que, a diferencia de otras como el azúcar, los esclavos no solamente produjeron pero también consumieron; que sostuvo flujos latitudinales transatlánticos más destacados como el comercio de esclavos, pero que circuló meridionalmente; que, como todos esos flujos, tuvo un componente oceánico que compuso un espacio de flujos vivido activamente más que un espacio muerto de separación; y que podría ser banal pero que ayudó a alimentar trasformaciones mayores de dos de los principales centros del Atlántico hispánico.

In my historical study of this 18-century village, I draw upon archaeological evidence, archived documents, and oral historical accounts in order to explore processes of community formation and maintenance as they are revealed through the reciprocal relationship of structure and agency, otherwise known as structuration. Since the performance of social identity is a consequence of community creation, its investigation provides one means through which structuration may be accessed. Through the analysis and integration of the various lines of information, my research contributes to our understanding of the complex relationships that connect objects and places to people and community. Located in the northern Borderlands of New Spain, Las Huertas..."
