        "text": "Few college basketball fans are born with their love for the game. For most aficionados, at some point on the way from infancy to college hoops fan, there is a moment. A single play, shot, player, game, or event at which point they say to themselves, âI will always have this in my life.â Because it is the time of the season that carries the most gravitas, these things often happen in March. We asked some of our friends and correspondents: what was the thing that turned you into a lifelong college basketball fan? What was yourâ¦March Moment?\n\nOur final installment for this year has a pair of remembrances that remind us how just being part of the magic of the NCAA Tournament is something for which to be thankful. RTC correspondents Kraig Williams and Russell Burnett recount being in the crowd (and eventually on the floor) to see their teams earn automatic invites to the NCAA Tournament. Butler may be a 5-seed but theyâre still a so-called âmid-major,â and this is obviously the biggest storyline of this yearâs Final Four. These stories from Messrs. Williams and Burnett amplify how great Butlerâs achievement is, and goes to show that if you think every single mid-major program in the nation doesnât take pride in and hope from the Bulldogsâ presence in Indy this weekend, youâd better think again:\n\nKW: Iâve always been a big college basketball fan, and fondly remember the days of filling out a bracket before I even knew how to pronounce some of the schoolsâ names. Growing up in Utah, I remember watching Keith Van Horn carry Utah to a championship game; I jumped on the band wagons of Duke in â01 and Syracuse in â03 to win bracket pools among my friends and slowly college basketball seeped into my blood. It wasnât until last season that I had my ultimate March Moment.\n\nAs a student at Utah State University, we survived the adjustment from the Big West to the WAC only to surfer heartbreaks in the conference tournament year after year. Last season though, things were different. It was clear the Aggies were head-and-shoulders above the rest of the conference. Utah State steamrolled through Fresno State, somehow survived New Mexico State in the semi finals, and then came the dream matchup with Nevada on their home floor. Sitting outside the arena a couple hours before they would even let us in, it became apparent that this would be our night. Utah State students had the Nevada crowd nearly outnumbered, and when we got into the stadium it became clear that we would have the better team. Utah State jumped out to a 21-4 lead and the party began in the student section. After years of following the Aggies, and watching them come oh-so-close so many times, we were finally going to have a conference tournament banner to hang in The Spectrum. The clock ticked down, we shouted the âwinning team, losing teamâ chant, and then we rushed the court in Reno like our lives depended on it. We spent the next hour or so just standing on the court, talking to the players, taking photos with the trophy, and watching our guys cut down the nets. Thatâs a feeling Iâll never forget, knowing that we werenât going to be sweating bullets at home waiting to see if the selection committee would be nice enough to send us to the dance.\n\nRead the rest of this entry Â»\n\nFew college basketball fans are born with their love for the game.

We asked some of our friends and correspondents: what was the thing that turned you into a lifelong college basketball fan? What was yourâ¦March Moment? Weâll be posting some of their answers for the rest of the month.\n\nIn this submission, correspondent Steve Coulter tells a tale of a very rare occasion on which he changed allegiances from the team he loved to a team that went on a tournament run that weâll still all be talking about decades from now:\n\nIn my short lifetime there have been many memories from to the three glorious weeks referred to as March Madness.\n\nThere was Valparaisoâs miracle run to the Sweet 16 when I was only seven. I can still remember watching highlights of the Bryce Drew game with my dad later that day. There was #15 Hamptonâs huge upset of #2 Iowa State when I was only ten. I stayed up that night with my brother, but as the game wore on into the night we both found ourselves sound asleep and kicking ourselves the next morning while watching ESPN. More recently there was Davidsonâs Elite 8 run in 2008. Stephen Curry proved to be the littlest giant ever to step onto the hardwood in March, destroying the title hopes of teams such as Gonzaga, Georgetown, and Wisconsin. They almost conquered Kansas, the team that eventually won the tournament, losing 59-57 in a game for the ages.\n\nAll of these have been great and there have been many more excellent games, moments, and stories in my 19 years, but I am a sucker for the underdog and March Madness is where David always has a chance to conquer Goliath. And no true underdog team has ever pushed against all odds and had so much success in the NCAA tournament in my lifetime or anybody elseâs than No. 11 seeded George Mason, who in 2006 shocked the entire basketball world by becoming the most unlikely Final Four team in all of history.\n\nRead the rest of this entry Â»\n\nFew college basketball fans are born with their love for the game.

We asked some of our friends and correspondents: what was the thing that turned you into a lifelong college basketball fan? What was yourâ¦March Moment? Weâll be posting some of their answers for the rest of the month.\n\nIn this installment, Back Door Cuts contributor Mike Walsh describes how his March Moment changed his life and put him on a path from which heâs yet to stray:\n\nWithout a doubt, my defining March moment is from the 2001 NCAA tournament. It was my sophomore year at Saint Josephâs University and as the assistant sports editor at the student paper, I was lucky enough to travel to San Diego to cover our boys as the No. 9 seed in the West bracket.\n\nIn the first round, the Hawks topped eighth-seeded Georgia Tech. It was the first tournament game I ever saw in person and watching my team win from press row was icing on the cake. In the second round, St. Joeâs drew No. 1 seed Stanford. On paper, it shouldnât have been close. In the first half, it didnât look like it was going to be.\n\nBut then, I and everyone else in the arena witnessed an unforgettable performance.\n\nYou know those games where the whole arena is buzzing with the prospect of an upset in the making? This turned out to be one of those games. You know those players who are suddenly thrust into the spotlight after a stellar showing on the NCAAâs biggest stage? St. Joeâs junior guard Marvin OâConnor was that player.\n\nOn the shoulders of the scorching hot shooting guard, who tied a career high with 37 points on 15-of-20 shooting, the Hawks wiped out a 14-point first half deficit and gave the top-seeded Cardinal all they could handle in the second half. For a while, it felt like it could be one of those rare instances where a No. 1 seed was sent packing on the first weekend.\n\nRead the rest of this entry Â»\n\nFew college basketball fans are born with their love for the game.

We asked some of our friends and correspondents: what was the thing that turned you into a lifelong college basketball fan? What was yourâ¦March Moment? Weâll be posting some of their answers for the rest of the month.\n\nIn this submission, a Kentucky fanâs love for college hoops is cemented by, of all things, a game they ended up losing â but specifically a few seconds that were burned into his memory, thanks to a kind roll:\n\nMarch has a funny way of changing things. The NCAA tournament kicks off, and 65 teams get a shot to extend their seasons and for three weeks David and Goliath find themselves in the same shoesâ¦win or go home.\n\nIt has a unique way of bringing out the best and even the worst in people, and sets a stage for Cinderella to flex her muscles. Simply put, March Madness is without a doubt the best three weeks in sports.\n\nMost people have their favorite March memory, whether it be âThe Shotâ by Christian Laettner (which somehow find its way into every CBS broadcast), watching Houstonâs Phi Slamma Jamma square off against the Doctors of Dunk (Louisville and Darryl Griffith), or any moment in between.\n\nAs a Kentucky fan, I feel I have my own unique perspective of The Big Dance. Although the Cats have won two titles in my lifetime, the moment that stands out the most came in a loss.\n\nIn 2005, Kentucky was on a roll. After sweeping through the regular season with a 23-4 record, the Cats were poised to make some waves in the tournament. After a couple of close wins in the opening three rounds, the only thing standing in the way of UK and a Final Four berth was a pesky overachiever from East Lansingâ¦Michigan State.\n\nAfter playing the Spartans close for the entire game, Kentucky found itself down three points with just 19 seconds left in regulation. Thatâs when something spectacular happened. After a couple of misfires from behind the arc, Patrick Sparks chased down a long rebound with just two seconds left and let loose a prayer that would decide if the season would be extended. The prayer was answered. Overtime.\n\nAlthough the Cats would fall just two periods later, that shot would change my life.\n\nThatâs the moment that I realized how much Kentucky basketball meant to me. I had been a UK fan since before I can remember but in the seconds surrounding that play it took on such a new meaning. As Sparksâ three-pointer bounced around the rim, time stood still. Although just an instant, it felt like it lasted forever and my heart didnât resume beating until after the ball had found its way safely through the net.\n\nThe emotions that exploded after that one shot changed the way I looked at the game. Basketball wasnât just a sport anymore; it couldnât be. It was something so much bigger.\n\nWhile jumping around the living room with my dad and little brother, hugging and high fiving, I realized how important it was. The way it felt to share that with them is something Iâll carry with me for the rest of my life. As I get older Iâll always look back on that day and smile. That day, that moment, is when everything changed. Isnât it funny how March can do that to you?\n\nFew college basketball fans are born with their love for the game. For most aficionados, at some point on the way from infancy to college hoops fan, there is a moment. A single play, shot, player, game, or event at which point they say to themselves, âI will always have this in my life.â Because it is the time of the season that carries the most gravitas, these things often happen in March. We asked some of our friends and correspondents: what was the thing that turned you into a lifelong college basketball fan? What was yourâ¦March Moment? Weâll be posting some of their answers for the rest of the month.\n\nIn this edition, RTC correspondent Ray Floriani remembers a New York City night in 1971 that altered his perception of winning and losing, how he was affected by both, and how it all cemented his love for our game:\n\nNEW YORK CITY â The intensity, excitement and general myraid of emotions packed into that March evening will probably never be duplicated. It was the ultimate heartbreaker. At the same time, this was the one. The game and experience that certifiably had yours truly hooked on basketball, notably college basketball, as the favorite sport. One that transformed a casual observer into a devout follower.\n\nMention âthe Georgia Tech game in the NITâ and any St. Bonaventure fan who can remember gas being under a buck a gallon will recall the year (1971) , the date (March 25), the circumstance and how it played out. A little backgroundâ¦\n\nThe 1970-71 season was my freshman year at St. Bonaventure. The previous March the Bonnies made it to the Final Four and if Bob Lanier hadnât been injured late in the East Regional final against Villanova, who knows? UCLAâs national championship run might have been interrupted.\n\nLarry Weise, St. Bonaventure coach from 1961-73\n\nThe team lost Lanier and a top notch lead guard in Billy Kalbaugh. There was optimism though as the returnees had experienced winning and approached the season with a positive mindset. Among the veterans returning for coach Larry Weise were Greg Gary, Matt Gantt, Dale Tepas, and Paul Hoffman. Gantt, at 6-5, was the big man. An incredible leaper, Gantt was the prototype âfrequent flyerâ who could make life miserable for opponents five (or more) inches taller. Sophomore Carl Jackson was up from the freshman team (they had them back then). Overall, there was talent.\n\nI had the good fortune to get into the program as one of the team managers. It was a job I did four years in high school and would do four years at Bonaventure. The season went extremely well with the Bonnies, ranked high as 11th at one point, finishing 18-5. Back then 25 teams made the NCAA tournament and with the East basically a group of independents, as Bonaventure was, you needed a great record to get in. The Bonnies accepted an NIT bid. Again, in that day it was a 16 team field with all games contested at Madison Square Garden.\n\nRead the rest of this entry Â»\n\nFew college basketball fans are born with their love for the game.

Weâll be posting some of their answers for the rest of the month.\n\nIn this edition, we have submissions from three friends. In the first, RTC utility man Tom Hager remembers a time he had to improvise a way to celebrate after two buzzer-beaters; the second has RTC correspondent Jason Prizoborowski barely escaping extended hoops deprivation; the third has Friend of the Program Mike Kiffney â he of the patented âKiffney threeâ â showing his age by recalling how he met a legend from his high school, and making a prediction that will please fans of the Orange:\n\nTH: My March moment came when I was 11 years old. It was Friday night of the first round of the NCAA tournament, and I was sleeping over at a friendâs house. He had no interest in basketball, but fortunately for me, he had fallen asleep by 9:00 that night. I spent the rest of the night watching some of the most exciting basketball I had ever seen in my life. I was sitting in the lower bunk trying to keep quiet as I watched Georgetown defeat Arkansas 63-61 on a buzzerâbeater. I remember watching Nat Burton drive to the lane and sink a shot just before time expired. When head coach Craig Esherick was asked for his thoughts on the game winner, he actually looked a little upset. âThe play was not designed to go to himâ¦â was how Esherick began the interview, but stated that Burton was a senior, and had the experience to take the shot.\n\nThat same night, I watched what I still think might be the best upset in the history of college basketball, when a team I had never heard of (Hampton) with a bunch of players I had never heard of (yeah, Tarvis Williams) defeat highly touted Iowa State. After Williams sank a hook shot with a few seconds left, and Jamaal Tinsley missed his shot at the buzzer, I saw Hamptonâs cheerleaders, players, and even coach Steve Merfeld jump in the air. I was doing the exact same. I ran outside my friendâs room and into his kitchen, where I could jump and scream (internally) over what had just happened without waking him up. By the time I was done celebrating, I had done more fist pumps than Tiger Woods and I was out of breath. I remember trying to go to bed that night but I was too excited to fall asleep right away, as that play ran over and over in my head. To this day, it is still my lasting image of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nRead the rest of this entry Â»\n\nFew college basketball fans are born with their love for the game.

We asked some of our friends and correspondents: what was the thing that turned you into a lifelong college basketball fan? What was yourâ¦March Moment? Weâll be posting some of their answers for the rest of the month.\n\nIn this submission, RTC contributor and bracketologist-in-residence Zach Hayes illustrates one of the many reasons why the NCAA Tournament is the greatest event in American sports â a good deal of the time, itâs not just about basketball:\n\nThereâs something different about growing up rooting for a mid-major.\n\nItâs elementary rooting for perennial powerhouses like Duke, Kentucky, North Carolina or Michigan State, teams that may experience hardship once a decade but can always be counted on to reload sooner than later, similar to playing the Rookie level on Madden.\n\nWhen that special season comes along for a mid-major, the urgency is palpable, the intensity unmatched, the hope for that perfect slipper fit lingers. Fans of mid-majors often see their small, unknown program wallow in the depths of obscurity playing in front of 1,000 fans for years, unable to migrate up the standings. Then that miracle-working coach comes along, diamonds in the rough begin to fill out the roster, and finally the school faces that one opportunity to achieve the previously unthinkable.\n\nFor me, that team was the 2002-03 Milwaukee Panthers. For me, that coach was Bruce Pearl.\n\nAs any college basketball fan knows, the conference tournament is the be-all and end-all for mid-major programs. A team can suffer through a losing regular season, reel off three straight wins and find themselves in the Big Dance. But on the flipside, a team can coast to the regular season title, play one bad 40-minute stint and miss out on a chance that may never present itself again.\n\nThat was the situation facing the Panthers during Pearlâs second season at the helm and my first season with season tickets at THE MECCA, the downtown arena that Kareem and Oscar formerly patrolled for the Bucks back in the early-70s. The middling Horizon League program had been lingering in the shadow of Marquette in our own city and Butler in our own league for the bane of our Division I existence.\n\nThen the perfect concoction came together for that 2002-03 season. We found a legitimate post player in Dylan Page, a sharp-shooting 2-guard in Clay Tucker, a steady point guard in Ronnie Jones and complimentary players like Jason Frederick and Nate Mielke that executed Pearlâs patented full-court press to a tee. It was a team incredibly easy to get attached to at 12 years old. Just me, my dad, our favorite coach and a mid-major trying to make a name for themselves.\n\nOur Panthers ended up toppling mighty Butler in the Horizon finals. The court filled in a matter of seconds with gold-clad students lifting players into the air. The previously unimaginable had been accomplished. But all I remember from that moment is hugging my father and the beaming smile that covered his face. Heâs taught at Milwaukee since 1982 and had experienced the lowest of lows with the program. It was for him.\n\nWe ended up losing to 5th seeded Notre Dame in the first round nine days later after Page missed a game-winning layup at the buzzer. The game ended around 11 PM on a school night, but of course my father let me stay up for the end. When Pageâs miss trickled around the rim and out and the Irish celebrated at center court, I remember expecting the tears to stream down my face.\n\nInstead, a smile of appreciation broke out. I looked over at my dad and he began to applaud.\n\nWe were too proud of them to do anything different.\n\nRTC asked its legion of correspondents, charlatans, sycophants, toadies and other hangers-on to send us their very favorite March Madness memory, something that had a visceral effect on who they are as a person and college basketball fan today. Not surprisingly, many of the submissions were excellent and if youâre not fired up reading them, then you need to head back over to PerezHilton for the rest of this month. Weâve chosen the sixteen best, and weâll be counting them down over the next two weeks as we approach the 2009 NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Hunter S. Thompson of College Basketball (submitted by Ray Floriani of College Chalktalk)\n\nSOUTH ORANGE, NJ â The NCAA tournament in 1979 turned out to be truly memorable. And not simply because of Magic vs. Bird. First, a little background. I was writing and doing some photographic work for Eastern Basketball magazine. EB was produced in the Long Island home of founders Ralph and Rita Pollio and enjoyed a good following. The three of us plus Ritaâs brother Ray took a twelve-hour drive to Raleigh for the first two rounds. On Friday evening Penn stopped Iona (coached by the late Jim Valvano) and St. Johnâs upset a good Temple team. On Sunday it was the day still known in ACC country as âBlack Sunday.â Penn upset top ranked North Carolina and St. Johnâs, who upset Duke in Decemberâs Holiday Festival consolation, made it two straight over the Devils with another upset victory.\n\nThe following weekend it was off to Greensboro for the regionals. I traveled with EB writer Happy Fine. An extremely knowledgeable basketball analyst and excellent writer, Happy knew a good number of people and was well connected. We flew to Greensboro, had regular hotel rooms, credentials and ate at good restaurants and covered some memorable games. Greensboro Coliseum was half (or more empty) with no ACC representatives. Even the local papers billed the regionals as the âfrost belt four.â For the record, Penn upset Syracuse and St.Johnâs did the same to Rutgers in the semis. Then Penn edged St. Johnâs in a thrilling regional final. As the sign Penn fans held in post game celebrations read, âweese going to Utah.â\n\nNow in 1979 there was no Big East. Penn naturally was in the Ivy, but schools like St. Johnâs were part of ECAC regional affiliations while Rutgers was in the Eastern Eight (now Atlantic Ten). We did not cover the ACC at EB â only the âtraditional East.â We had an agreement with the NCAA that if we got a team in we could get a Final Four credential (as inâ¦ one credential). As much as Rita tried, we could not secure a second for yours truly. Happy and I would drive to Philadelphia (about 2 hours) and fly on the Penn fan charter â the bad news was that I did not have a ticket nor did we have hotel rooms in Salt Lake City. Talk about âsurvive and advance.â\n\nWe flew out Thursday morning , two days before the semis. Happy secured us a âroomâ in the suite of SIâs Curry Kirkpatrick. A heavy hitter on SIâs team, I met Curry through Happy in Greensboro and felt him humble and passionate about the game. An hour into the flight, Happy had already secured tickets for me to the semis and finals with the whole cost setting me back only about $30. No complaints, at least I was in. The charter was mostly Penn students and we had a great time discussing basketball with them on the flight out. That night I went to the NABC (National Association of Basketball Coaches) all-star game at the old Salt Palace, where the Jazz played. Pleased to see James Bailey of Rutgers star in the contest which had a number of solid players.\n\nThe Final Four was held at the Arena on the University of Utah campus. On Friday at open practice I met with Al McGuire. There was no ESPN back then. NBC televised the tournament and some national games. Eastern teams like Syracuse got maybe a date or two or national TV. McGuire wanted to know more about Penn so Rita arranged for me to meet with him. She prepared a sizable portfolio on the Quakers. After meeting McGuire, quite a thrill since I idolized him and his coaching style since high school, he put the packet aside. In his unique style he jotted down key points about Penn. Their marquee players Tony Price and Bobby Willis. The multi-talented center Matt White. The coaching philosophy of Bob Weinauer. The streamers thrown after the first basket. Even the watering hole, Smokey Joeâs, which had cheap tap brews and great cheesesteaks. We met for about a half hour then McGuire gave me his card. Safe to say, from my vantage point, the McGuire meeting was a highlight of that Final Four (an example of his peculiar eloquence is below).\n\nGot back to the hotel and Happy asked if I wouldnât mind going to another hotel. No problem, even though I quietly arose at 7 a.m. that morning to go running. Seems Curry had âoverbookedâ his guests. We arranged for me to stay with Mike Madden of the Boston Globe. I met Mike covering some BC games. We got along well and had no problems with the situation.\n\nSaturday. Game day. Rode the NABC shuttle to the arena and one coach had a remark that could be etched in stone when he said, âthere is no better day in basketball than today.â Heâs right because as special as the finals are, the semifinal Saturday gives you four teams all with national championship hopes and dreams. Penn-Michigan State was the first game. The Quakers got inside Michigan Stateâs patented 2-3 matchup zone, but could not hit a thing, picking the most inopportune time to play their worst game. The margin was in the thirties in the first half as MSU cruised. The second game came down to the final minutes as Indiana State edged DePaul. Thought it was a special story that the same Ray Meyer who coached DePaul to prominence with George Mikan three decades prior was back in the limelight.\n\nThrough post game receptions with the NABC and media on Saturday night and into Sunday the talk was over Michigan State dismantling Penn and now Magic vs. Bird on Monday night. They told us Salt Lake City was dry. With the commerce dollars coming in that weekend, the cityâs âgood fathersâ probably looked the other way as the beer flowed like an amber cascade. Made some phone reports to Ralph but his phone was disconnected so we called the neighbor who would run across the street to get him.\n\nMet Basketball Times publisher Larry Donald on Sunday. Itâs ironic that about a decade later I would be working for him. Snapped some shots around the picturesque Utah campus and chatted with students. Arkansas coach Eddie Sutton stopped by a media reception on Sunday evening. Suttonâs Arkansas team dropped a heart breaker to Indiana State in a regional final but the coach was cordial and an interesting personality to discuss the game with. Happy and Bob Ryan told Sutton about this young high school player doing some work in Boston, Patrick Ewing.\n\nOn Monday I went to a few NABC clinics. As a basketball fanatic Iâm always looking for information on the game. Ohio Stateâs Don Devoe gave a great talk. Really impressed with a coach who would fall afoul to recruiting violations a few years later; New Mexicoâs Norm Ellenberger also spoke about the fast break. Back in those days they had a consolation game and Penn was thrilled to go out and prove they belonged. I âborrowedâ Happyâs press pass to get some photos on the floor. Penn played well and lost a tough one to DePaul. The Quakers gained back some respect, but unfortunately the game was not televised.\n\nThe final saw Magic Johnsonâs Michigan State vs. Larry Birdâs Indiana State. A great game. Greg Kelser was an inside factor for the Spartans and, though there was no three point shot, Jud Heathcote had a few good outside shooters that kept the defense honest. Michigan State held about a nine point lead through the second half. That nine felt like eighteen as they were in command throughout. Got on the floor for the post game awards. Snapped some shots then caught some of the post game press conference in a huge area to accommodate several hundred media. Shortly after, Happy and I went to the airport to catch our charter. It was a redeye and as we boarded, a Penn student brought a PENN sign from a side scoreboard at the arena. Why not ?\n\nWe flew cross-country in the middle of the night. Penn students slept. At times I stayed awake thinking about it all, wondering will Indiana State stay a major player or was this their âfifteen minutes of fame?â Penn will be a major Ivy player, but was this like Princetonâs â65 final Four run where everything came together? Magicâs greatest attribute is his ability to raise his teammatesâ games, and what a great story the DePaul resurgence was.\n\nAs years passed the â79 final went down as a classic. In truth, for me, the whole weekend was."
