        "text": "Jim and Vicki Berlier invite Friends of History members to their San Pablo Ranch in Encino, New Mexico (about a 90 minute drive from Santa Fe). The San Pablo is one of several ranch operations the Berliers own in New Mexico.\n\nThe day’s activities include:\n\nLearn about wind turbines: We will take a short walk to one of the 53 wind turbines on the ranch. Jim will discuss the San Pablo wind project and answer questions.\n\nVisit the ranch headquarters: The San Pablo Ranch was purchased by Jim’s great uncle Theo Berlier in 1937. The ranch includes several buildings built to display artifacts collected by the family. Great Uncle Theo originally put together the collections, including artifacts from Central America and many homestead articles. There will be plenty of time to view the collections and enjoy the ranch property.\n\nEnjoy a classic chuck wagon lunch: Bert Ancell has been in the cattle business for over forty years, rising from bunkhouse cowboy to manager of the Bell Ranch (until its sale in 2010). He spent years as a wagon cook at the Bell Ranch and Diamond A Ranch during cattle operations. Bert will make an authentic chuck wagon lunch for us.\n\nVisit Encino to tour a restored historic school building.\n\nVisit the Larranaga Ranch in Encino and tour the family church."
