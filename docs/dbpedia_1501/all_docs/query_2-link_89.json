Clark - 1:32 pm\n\nBy Ellen Ben-Naim\n\nLos Alamos\n\nI am writing in support of the Rec Bond. After a year and a half of public meetings and countless hours of staff and volunteer research and planning, the county has put together a well thought out package of recreation projects.\n\nThese facilities will help meet the needs of young families, student athletes and adults of all ages. They also will help increase our property values, benefit our schools and make Los Alamos a more attractive place to live for new hires to the Lab.\n\nI believe passing the recreation bond will help move Los Alamos County forward.

Clark - 12:33 pm\n\nBy JOHN N. HORNE\n\nLos Alamos\n\nI would like to add my name to the list of people who are opposed to the recreation bond. On May 5, Carolyn Roberts wrote an excellent assessment of the problems with this bond issue and I am in complete agreement with the points she has made.\n\nThe most important of these points is the following: “If something adverse happens at LANL or another fire devastates our community, WE, the property owners, are still responsible for paying this debt back. Additionally, if the projected recovery percentages fall short, Los Alamos County can, again, raise our property taxes to repay Read More\n\nLunch With A Leader: Rec Bond Forum May 16\n\nSubmitted by Chris Clark - 12:20 pm\n\nLWV News:\n\nAt 11:45 a.m., Tuesday, May 16, the League of Women Voters’ community event, Lunch with a Leader, will present information about the Recreation Bond at Mesa Public Library.\n\nDarren Meadows, Philo Shelton, James Chrobocinski, Susan O’Leary, Lisa Shin and Lisa Brenner will explain both sides of the bond and answer questions.

There are so many reasons to vote AGAINST this bond. Here are a few:\n\nLos Alamos County is not in a good predicament money-wise. Presently we have a $1,400,000 shortfall for this budget year due to the LANL contract’s limbo status. I hope everyone realizes that the windfall we’ve received from a for-profit company winning the last contract is what has funded our new Municipal Building, the Justice Center, the White Rock Library and other\n\nRead More\n\nAFTNM Pass Resolutions In Support Of Immigrant Community In New Mexico\n\nSubmitted by Chris Clark - 11:57 am\n\nAFTNM News:\n\nALBUQUERQUE ― American Federation of Teachers New Mexico President Stephanie Ly and American Federation of Teachers Executive Vice President Kathy Chavez released the following statements:\n\n“Today, our union took a stand of solidarity with our immigrant brothers and sisters, and especially our immigrant students.
