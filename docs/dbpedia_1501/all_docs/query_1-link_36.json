The Wildcats finished the season 17-0 at home, the 13th time they have finished a season undefeated in the 49-year history of the McKale Center. Arizona's 19-game home win streak is the longest active streak in the Pac-12 and the third-longest in Division I heading into next season. The 'Cats won nine road games for the first time since 2016-17 and were 7-0 in neutral site games.\n\nArizona's Tommy Lloyd won the Henry Iba Award in his first season as a head coach after spending 20 seasons on the bnech with Gonzaga.\n\n2021 Henry Iba Coach of the Year: Juwan Howard, Michigan\n\nMichigan second-year head coach Juwan Howard, who led the Wolverines to a Big Ten regular-season championship and a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, has been named the winner of the Henry Iba Award.
