        "text": "Red Hills Cemetery aka North Lucy Cemetery\n\nLarranaga Ranch, Torrance County\n\nCompiled by Kathe\n\nPhotos by Clifford Powell Â© 22 Dec. 2008\n\nReturn to Cemetery Page\n\nThe current owner of this area says it has always been known as the Larranaga Ranch. The Larranaga Ranch was established in 1897 by Juan Larranaga. Juan is the son of Christobal Larranaga from Spain. Christobal, a Basque medical doctor, brought the smallpox vaccine to New Mexico through his travels from Mexico. The current ranch owner, Larry Larranaga is the son of Lecadio Larranaga. Many thanks to Leland Harrell and Larry Larranaga for granting us permission to cross their ranches to this area. The ranch gate is locked and permission is required to go on the 2 ranches. A special thank you to Larry Larranaga for his kindness, time and assistance; and most of all for relating his family history while walking us through the cemetery. What a true gentleman he is.\n\nRed Hill Church Red Hills Gate"
