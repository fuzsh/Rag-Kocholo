        "text": "This morning from the Farnborough Airshow, we reported GE Aerospace's second quarter financial results. Overall, the team delivered another strong quarter marked by double digit growth across orders, operating profit, and free cash flow to cap off a solid first half of the year. Given our performance year-to-date and momentum across our businesses, we are raising our full-year profit and free cash flow guidance. We are making meaningful progress to advance our strategic priorities in service of our employees, customers, and shareholders as we work to meet historic demand. As we continue to leverage FLIGHT DECK, our proprietary lean operating model, I am confident we will fully deliver for our customers and create exceptional value for shareholders. My thanks to the GE Aerospace team for their hard work and continued commitment to our customers and to living our purpose—to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely.\n\nIt’s good to be back at the Farnborough International Airshow. Two years ago at the airshow, we unveiled our new GE Aerospace brand to the world—an important moment on our journey to becoming a standalone company. Today, we are proud to return to Farnborough as a pure-play aerospace company, well-positioned to define flight for today, tomorrow, and the future. It has been another energizing day of listening, learning, and celebrating the industry with our customers, suppliers, and employees. This is a critical moment for us to come together and focus on key issues, including how we can better work together on safety, quality, and delivery as well as looking to the future to address sustainability with innovative technology. I’m looking forward to some exciting announcements throughout the week and another successful airshow for the team!\n\nIt has been an energizing day together with customers, suppliers, and employees as we kick off an important week for the industry at The Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough International Airshow. I spent the morning at genba visiting our Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility in Wales. While there, we announced GE Aerospace’s plans to invest more than $1 billion over five years in our MRO and component repair facilities worldwide — intended to create capacity to meet growth in both the widebody and narrowbody installed base by adding additional engine test cells and equipment. The funding also will add cutting-edge technology, including enhanced inspection techniques, to reduce turnaround times for customers as well as expand component repair capability within our overhaul shops. And this afternoon at RIAT, we reaffirmed our long-standing commitment to our military and veteran community—including a $150,000 donation to veterans’ employment charities Hiring Our Heroes and Forces Employment Charity. These commitments help recognize the contribution that service members, veterans, and military families continue to have on the business, our communities, and their respective countries. More exciting news to come!\n\nIn the words of former U.S. President (and former GE employee) Ronald Reagan: “We’re blessed with the opportunity to stand for something — for liberty and freedom and fairness. And these are things worth fighting for, worth devoting our lives to. And we have good reason to be hopeful and optimistic.” On Independence Day and every day, I am proud of the GE Aerospace team and the role we play in supporting the U.S. military to defend liberty and justice across our great nation, and around the world. Wishing all those in the United States a happy and safe July 4th.\n\nI was deeply moved by an invitation from President Emmanuel Macron to represent GE Aerospace at the 80th D-Day commemoration yesterday on Omaha Beach. Each time I have visited Normandy, I listen to President Ronald Reagan’s stirring Pointe du Hoc speech, given at the 40th commemoration in 1984. I recall watching it live and wondering what it all meant 40 years later for the veterans in attendance, the so-called Boys of Pointe du Hoc, who bravely scaled the vertical seawall under heavy bombardment as part of the Normandy landings. Now, another 40 years since that speech, the magnitude of the sacrifice made there was hard to imagine as we gazed northward across the wide beaches at low tide on such a lovely June day. The remaining veterans who made the trip, some sadly perhaps for the last time, help remind us of what is possible on the part of otherwise ordinary people when duty calls. As President Reagan said, “strengthened by their courage, heartened by their valor, and borne by their memory, let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died.”\n\nAs we prepare to mark Memorial Day here in the U.S., I’m keenly aware of and humbled by GE Aerospace's critical mission to lift people up and bring them home safely, including supporting the warfighter so those serving the U.S. and our allies can return to their loved ones. Our GE Aerospace Veterans Network in Lynn, Massachusetts, recently honored a local Gold Star family, which is a family that has experienced the loss of a loved one on active military duty. The team spruced up a memorial near the home of GE Aerospace retiree Ray Harris, whose daughter, U.S. Marine Corps Captain Jennifer Jean Harris, was killed on February 7, 2007, when the T-58-powered CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter that she piloted was shot down in Iraq. This weekend especially, we remember with deep gratitude Captain Harris and all who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms.\n\nI’m happy to share that Patrick de Castelbajac will join GE Aerospace as the company’s first Chief Strategy Officer, effective June 24. In this role, Patrick will lead our enterprise-wide strategic planning, positioning GE Aerospace for long-term growth and value creation. Patrick is well regarded as one of the aerospace industry’s leading strategic operators. We are thrilled to have him join the team and help in our efforts to invent the future of flight.\n\nToday, I was honored to visit the The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., where I discussed how GE Aerospace is inventing the future of flight. It's an exciting time in our first weeks as an independent company and great things are happening: we are hiring 900 engineers this year; improving operations with FLIGHT DECK, our proprietary lean operating system; and building on our history of innovation to produce more sustainable engines for our customers and revolutionary adaptive engines for our combat fighters. Our employees and their work are central in our efforts to meet the needs of our customers today and tomorrow. The best part of the event was having some of them—Cassi Miller, Jonathan Blank, Robert Zacharias, and Kim Brady.\n\nToday, we were proud to launch the GE Aerospace Foundation. For more than 100 years, the previous GE Foundation transformed the communities where our employees live and work around the world. As a standalone company, GE Aerospace will continue this legacy, with a renewed commitment to our purpose of “lifting people up” in communities where we live and work. Our dedicated philanthropic programs will help nurture a robust, diverse workforce in aerospace and engineering, invest in workforce development initiatives, and continue our support for humanitarian aid efforts with a focus on aviation's unique role in disaster response. It’s important for our company to carry on the storied legacy of philanthropy that GE built. I’m excited to see the impact we can make with our partners as we start this new chapter with the GE Aerospace Foundation. https://lnkd.in/eFdJ3PiK\n\nToday, we hosted our first earnings call as GE Aerospace, where we shared GE’s final quarter of consolidated results and GE Aerospace’s standalone performance. Our team had an exciting start to the year with the successful spin-off of GE Vernova and launch of GE Aerospace as an independent, public company. We achieved this historic milestone while delivering strong consolidated GE results in the quarter, largely driven by significant profit and free cash flow growth at GE Aerospace. The Commercial Engines & Services and Defense & Propulsion Technologies businesses together delivered double-digit revenue, profit, and free cash flow growth. Given our solid start to the year and outlook for the remainder of 2024, we are raising our full-year profit and cash guidance. Moving forward as a focused global aerospace leader, we will continue to prioritize safety, quality, delivery, and cost—always in that order—while also investing in our future and driving long term profitable growth."
