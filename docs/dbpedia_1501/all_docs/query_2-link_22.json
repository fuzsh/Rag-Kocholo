Of those 14, five are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, including four from the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nWait for it....\n\nNow that's how you celebrate @CanesCoachL's 600th career win! pic.twitter.com/n7lCFkJMK8\n\n— Canes Hoops (@CanesHoops) January 14, 2017\n\nIn his career, Larrañaga has won 27 games at American International, 170 at Bowling Green, 273 at George Mason and 130 at Miami. He is one of 15 coaches all-time with 100 or more wins at three D-I schools, four of whom are actively coaching. He is also 11th among active coaches in total games coached (995) and ninth in most seasons coached (33).\n\nLarrañaga has posted 10 20-win seasons over his career, topped by the 29-7 mark at Miami in 2012-13, when the Canes won the ACC regular season Championship, ACC Tournament championship and played in the NCAA Sweet 16."
