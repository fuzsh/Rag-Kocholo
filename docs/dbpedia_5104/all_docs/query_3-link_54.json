        "text": "Lynchburg is a quaint rural village located in northwest Highland County Ohio. This little village is proudly surrounded by family-owned farms. In the past, the town was known for its whiskey distillery. Lynchburg is also home of the only covered bridge in the state of Ohio that is used to connect two counties. If you and your family are looking for a trip filled with history and excitement, Lynchburg is the place to be.\n\nFounded in 1830, the village of Lynchburg was named after the city of Lynchburg, Virginia. Back in 1910, this little town was the home of a very large whiskey distillery. A man named John Bowen from the Pricetown area began building the distillery in 1855. Lynchburg’s Freiberg and Workum (F&W) Whiskey Distillery produced whiskey for the next 60 years. When the Cincinnati-based F&W Distillery began producing whiskey in 1857, it had a capacity to mash in only 100 barrels per day. At the height of its production in 1910, it could process 3,000 bushels daily with a storage capacity of more than 100,000 barrels. The distillery developed into a self-contained operation, employing warehouse workers, bottlers, carpenters, malters, packers, night policemen, coal wheelers, engineers and proof-makers, mail room clerks, stenographers, bookkeepers and labelers. The distillery’s coopers built their own whiskey barrels, which were constructed with wooden stays and hoops just outside Lynchburg. Today, only one of the buildings from the Freiberg and Workum Whiskey Distillery operation remains in Lynchburg, Ohio, and is now a privately owned building.\n\nThe covered bridge is a popular attraction in Lynchburg, Ohio. The bridge is a historic wooden covered bridge that spans the east fork of the Little Miami River. Lynchburg is the home to Ohio's only wooden covered bridge that connects two counties: Highland County and Clinton County. In 1870 the bridge was constructed for a cost of $3138.66 by local bridge builder John C. Gregg of Hillsboro, who had built a number of bridges in the area. The project was completed in December 1870. It occupies a site at which a gristmill and sawmill once operated by the power of the Little Miami.\n\nIn 1963, the bridge was on its way to being removed and replaced with a conventional uncovered bridge. The community fought back against this and held a letter-writing campaign for its preservation. The Lynchburg Covered Bridge was later renovated in 2023. The covered bridge that has stood watch over its community for over 150 years was rededicated during a special ceremony at Ruth Cramton Memorial Park in Lynchburg where actors in period costumes portrayed characters from some of the bridge’s 15-plus decades.\n\nOne of the most popular shops in this town is Terry's Grocery and Pizza. This same building also includes Terry's Ice Cream, the home of the \"Crazy Shake.” Located along State Route 50, Terrys is a very popular place for both visitors and residents in Highland County. Whether it’s grabbing a delicious pizza for dinner, or getting one of the biggest and most creative shakes you’ll ever see, Terry’s is an excellent place to visit while in Highland County. The shop also offers both indoor and outdoor seating for customers who want to sit down and relax while they enjoy their food.\n\nDuring the winter holiday season, the citizens of Lynchburg hold their annual two day Lynchburg Village Christmas. The Village Christmas is an event that started over 30 years ago as a way for local businesses and crafters to open up their shops and homes to showcase their products and creations. During this event, visitors can enjoy a breakfast with Santa Claus, carriage rides, music throughout the town, and lastly watch the lighted Christmas parade.\n\nThe wonderful village of Lynchburg, Ohio has a variety of things to offer for both visitors and residents of northwest Highland County. No matter when you come to visit, Lynchburg will have something waiting for you to explore."
