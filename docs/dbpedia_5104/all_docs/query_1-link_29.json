For the first 100 years, tobacco was the most important product - here it was auctioned and processed. In the mid-1800s, the city was second only to New Bedford, Mass., in per capita income. Thomas Jefferson was a frequent visitor to the area. During his second term as President, he built Poplar Forest in Bedford County as his retreat, 90 miles from the activity of Monticello. Lynchburg was a major Civil War storage depot, as well as a burial place for more than 2,000 war dead. Six Confederate generals are buried here, including General Jubal Early, who commanded the Confederate forces during the brief Battle of Lynchburg. Through a ruse, the city was spared destruction from Union forces who were within a mile of the city. General Early ran an empty train back and forth with much commotion, making the Union force believe reinforcements had arrived. The breastwork for the defense of the city can still be seen at Fort Early.\n\nLynchburg is an independent city, not included in any county, though it is in the area of Campbell County.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nAttractions\n\nThe Lynchburg Fine Arts Center\n\n1815 Thomson Drive\n\nLynchburg, VA 24502\n\nPhone: 434-846-8451\n\nGo to Lynchburg Attractions\n\nReturn to Index\n\nLynchburg Chamber\n\nGreater Lynchburg Chamber of Commerce & Visitors Information Center\n\n216 Twelfth Street\n\nLynchburg, VA 24504\n\nPhone: 800-REAL VA 1 or (434) 847-1811.\n\nFAX: (434) 847-1811\n\nE-mail: RealVA@aol.com\n\nLynchburg Organizations\n\nGreater Lynchburg Chamber of Commerce & Visitors Information Center\n\n216 Twelfth Street\n\nLynchburg, VA 24504\n\nPhone: 800-REAL VA 1 or (434) 847-1811.\n\nFAX: (434) 847-1811\n\nE-mail: RealVA@aol.com\n\nLynchburg Libraries\n\nJones Memorial Library\n\n2311 Memorial Avenue\n\nLynchburg, VA 24501\n\nLynchburg Schools\n\nCentral Virginia Community College\n\nA member of the Virginia Community College System.
