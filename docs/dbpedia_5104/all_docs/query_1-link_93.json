Over the next several hours, the Federal cavalrymen engaged with Confederate cavalry, slowly pushing them back towards the city. By the afternoon, Jubal Early's Confederate force reached Lynchburg and took up positions near the Quaker-Meeting house. By 4 o'clock, Hunter's force arrived on the city's outskirts and renewed their attacks along the Confederate lines, pushing them back until Stephen Ramseur's Confederate division arrived on the field and halted the Federal advance.\n\nThroughout the night of the 17th-18th, Early's Confederates dug and created a stable line of earthworks. Meanwhile, Early came up with a plan to confuse the Union army by running trains in and out of the city while making the civilians of the town cheer every time the trains stopped in town. This illusion made Hunter believe more Confederates, possibly from the 2nd Corps were arriving.\n\nBy the morning of the 18th, both sides skirmished. That afternoon, Hunter decided to test the Confederate lines by sending infantry and cavalry towards their flanks to spot any weakness in their lines. Finally, at around 11:00 a.m., Early decided to probe the Federal’s center lines. The Confederate attack was ferocious, but the Federal center held due to the arrival of George Crook's division\n\nUnion\n\n700\n\n0 killed\n\n0 wounded\n\n0 missing & captured\n\nEstimated Casualties\n\n900\n\nUnion\n\n700\n\nConfed.\n\n200\n\nConfederate\n\n200\n\n0 killed\n\n0 wounded\n\n0 missing & captured\n\nAfter Early's attack subsided, Hunter fully believed that the 2nd Corps from Lee's army was on the field, making the Confederate force larger than his. However, Early's force was still much smaller than his and awaiting more reinforcements from the 2nd Corps. Hunter's problems only grew from there. Due to his army's extended supply lines, many of the vital wagons carrying the supplies to feed his army were captured by Confederate raiders forcing his army to run low on food and ammunition. Knowing that if the larger Confederate force to his front attacked, his army would not have enough ammunition to last a battle thus, Hunter decided to pull back at nightfall. Hunter’s withdrawal opened the Shenandoah Valley from Lynchburg to Maryland, allowing Early to march on Washington."
