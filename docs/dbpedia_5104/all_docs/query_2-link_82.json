Hine started work on his Ellis Island portraits, John Sevigny sought to document Latin American immigrants, hoping to give faces to the catch-all masses lambasted by Lou Dobbs, Pat Buchanan and others who equate immigration with crime. This collection of portraits of Central American immigrants was taken at the Belen Posada del Migrante, a shelter in the northern Mexican city of Saltillo. A subplot of this project is the immigrants' desire to travel for the sake of traveling. Many immigrants—particularly the males—who get to Saltillo do not continue their journey to the United States, but return to their home countries. Many seem to have found what they were looking for on the road. John Sevigny is a photographer and teacher from Miami who lives in Mexico. His photographs have been exhibited in the United States, Mexico and Portugal. He previously worked as a photographer and writer for international news organizations including the Associated Press and EFE News, the news agency of the Spanish government. His news photographs have appeared in the New York Times, Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle, Montreal Mirror, Dallas Observer, El Nuevo Herald and People Magazine. Artist Talks are free to Members and $10 to the General Public. Students 19 and under, $5 RSVP Talks@MplsPhotoCenter.com. The Opening Reception of John Sevigny's \"Nomad\" Exhibit will be held on August 26, and John Sevigny will be holding\n\n3.

Posted by http://MillCityTimes.com ** Please note: this tour is limited to 30 people and is currently full. To be placed on the waiting list emailadmin@preserveminneapolis.org. ** St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) overlooks historic St. Anthony Falls on the east bank of the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis. This unique location allows SAFL to divert Mississippi River water from the upper pool of the falls so that it flows through the building’s many experimental facilities, then rejoins the river’s main flow below the falls. These facilities are ideally suited to support a variety of innovative research and educational activities. SAFL was designed and built in the 1930s with funds from the Works Progress Administration and the University of Minnesota.

The Burial at Thebes by Seamus Heaney based upon Sophocles’ Antigone directed by Marcela Lorca with original music by J.D. Steele September 24 – November 6 Opening Night: Saturday, October 1 Guthrie Theater, 818 Second Street South, McGuire Proscenium Stage Seamus Heaney’s adaptation of Sophocles’ Antigone offers modern touches to revive this ancient tale of love and self-sacrifice. As with the original, The Burial at Thebes focuses on the never- resolved conflict between a person’s individual rights and the demands of the state. The timeless struggle for honor is called into question in the face of challenging authority: to whom does loyalty belong – to one’s family and cultural practices or to the law decreed by the state?
