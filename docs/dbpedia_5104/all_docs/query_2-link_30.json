        "text": "Born in Rochester, New York, in 1919, Collins grew up on Long Island, New York. In 1941, while attending the University of Miami in Florida, he substituted as the announcer for his English teacher's campus radio program and decided he wanted to pursue a career in radio.\n\nCollins began his professional career as a disc jockey at a bluegrass music station in Logan, West Virginia. By 1943, he was at WKPA in Pittsburgh, moving in 1945 to WIND in Chicago, and in 1946 to KNAK in Salt Lake City. Collins moved to New York City, and landed the overnight shift at independent powerhouse WNEW in 1950, where he invented the imaginary subterranean studio, when he looked around at the violet paint job in the announcers' booth and began telling his listeners about a glowing grotto with stalactites and mushrooms.\n\nMad Magazine c.1964 The Purple Grotto\n\nSoon, Collins and his night-owl audience invented a cavern filled with imaginary friends like Harrison, the 176-year-old purple Tasmanian owl with bright orange eyes, named after onetime \"Talk of the Town\" columnist Harrison Kinney of The New Yorker.\n\nIn New York, he did dog food ads by speaking directly to the dogs. Collins was such a character that Mad Magazine once did a cartoon spread on him and his imaginary characters in the 1960s.\n\nHe loved purple, once had a Porsche covered with purple velveteen and topped with a faucet, and he wore jumpsuits made by his wife, Patti, along with little hats.\n\nHe was also on the air in Utah, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. After 10 years of making his WNEW Purple Grotto a hipster's haven in New York, he came to San Francisco in 1960 and became part of the fabled air staff of KSFO. Collins was also one of the first disc jockeys to use an informal, conversational tone on the air. He would improvise, much like a jazz musician, often over background music.\n\nHe made several appearances on The Tonight Show with Steve Allen in the early 50s.\n\nJazzbo made up \"Grimm's Fairy Tales for Hip Kids\" and jazzy, beatnik nursery rhymes such as “Little Red Riding Hood,” “Jack and the Beanstalk”. [ LISTEN ] (3:18), and “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves”. The kids really dug these 78s.\n\nIn 1957, NBC-TV hired him for five weeks as the host of the Tonight show when it was known as Tonight! America After Dark in the period between hosts Steve Allen and Jack Paar. In 1957 Collins starred in an episode of NBC radio's science fiction radio series X Minus One. By 1959, he was with KSFO in San Francisco.\n\nOn television he hosted The Al Collins Show, which aired on KGO-TV. The format included appearances by celebrities such as Moe Howard of the Three Stooges. A popular segment on his show was the \"no stinkin' badges\" routine. Al would politely request the main guest don a Mexican bandit costume, complete with ammo belts crossing the chest, six-guns in holsters, a huge sombrero and large fake mustache. The guest then posed in front of cameras for the TV audience. With pistols pointing at the camera, the guest had to say \"I don't got to show you no stinkin' badges.\" If the guest did not say it with sufficient sinister tone Collins made him or her repeat it until in Al's opinion the guest got it right. Collins' bit was a play on a famous exchange in the 1948 film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.\n\nContained on one of Jazzbo's record albums, (where you can also send in for an official Bandido sticker), is Jazzbo issuing the Bandido Oath. [ LISTEN ] (2:02)\n\nLater in the 1960s, he was the host of Jazz for the Asking, and he worked with several Los Angeles stations late in the decade including KMET, KFI, and KGBS. He changed the spelling of his name to \"Jazzbeaux\" when he went to WTAE in Pittsburgh in 1969, and then moved to WIXZ in 1973, before returning to the West Coast three years later. While in Pittsburgh, he briefly hosted a late night television show titled Jazzbeauxz Rehearsal, an eclectic sampling of anything that caught Collins's interest.\n\nIn 1976 he returned to San Francisco, at KMPX, followed by an all-night program at KGO. He began the program with \"Blues in Hoss Flat\" by Count Basie. He also worked a late shift at KKIS in Pittsburg, California, in 1980.\n\nAfter a stint in New York and WNEW in 1981, he was back in San Francisco at KSFO in 1983, and KFRC in 1986. Then he returned ato WNEW from 1986–90, KAPX in 1990, and hosted a weekly jazz show at KCSM - College of San Mateo, California - beginning in 1993.\n\nAl \"Jazzbo\" Collins died on September 30, 1997 from cancer. He was 78. He was survived by his wife of 31 years, singer Patti Collins, and seven children from three marriages.\n\nWHERE DID JAZZBO WORK? Here is the list: WKPA, WIND, KNAK, WNEW, KSFO, VOA, KMET, KFI, KGBS, WTAE, WIXZ, KMPX, KGO, KFRC, KAPX, KCSM.\n\nSome materials found on this page were originally published by the following: Cosmic Aeroplane, Hammondcast’s Weblog."
