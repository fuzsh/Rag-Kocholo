Their original manuals are usually not very much more expensive than the photocopies from Tannenbaum:\n\nhttp://www.agtannenbaum.com/t_cat.html\n\nor photocopies from Sarrio:\n\nhttp://www.sarrio.com/sarrio/rsman3.html\n\nDale H.

I don't know if they match your series but hope they\n\nhelp. Let me know if you receive all three emails OK or if there's a problem.\n\nDon Black.\n\nsundownerc23 wrote:\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nHi, I bought a tek 453 at a hamfest, and it works!!
