        "text": "Founding\n\nThe University of Lynchburg was founded as Virginia Christian College in 1903 by Dr. Josephus Hopwood, a pioneer in Christian coeducation, and is one of the oldest coeducational institutions in Virginia. An accredited residential university, Lynchburg is affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), a denomination with a tradition of welcoming persons of all faiths and denominations.\n\nLocation\n\nLocated in Lynchburg, Virginia, at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the University of Lynchburg is approximately 180 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., and 120 miles west of Richmond, the state capital.\n\nStrategic Plan\n\nThrough Lynchburg’s strategic plan, we clearly state our intention to enhance the signature Lynchburg experience that generations of students and alumni hold dear. We will do this by pursuing our primary aspiration to be nationally recognized as the leader for student engagement in the classroom, athletics, and leadership.\n\nFaculty\n\nUniversity of Lynchburg faculty are outstanding scholars and leaders in their disciplines. Of the 200 full-time faculty members, 77% are tenured or tenure track. The student-faculty ratio is 10:1, which allows for personal attention and student-faculty collaborative research.\n\nStudent Body and Profile\n\nThere are 1,822 undergraduate and 870 graduate students, representing 44 states. Of the 1,822 undergraduate students, 39% are male, 61% are female, 22% are students of color, and 72% live on campus.\n\nAcademics\n\nUndergraduate programs: 52 undergraduate majors, 67 minors, and 16 pre-professional programs\n\nGraduate programs: three doctoral programs, and 14 master’s programs\n\nCampus\n\nLocated on 264 acres, the beautifully landscaped campus is a showplace. Facilities include more than 40 buildings, many of Georgian Revival-style architecture. The graduate health sciences building is a short walk from the main campus and houses the Doctor of Physical Therapy and Master of PA Medicine programs.\n\nAthletics\n\nThe intercollegiate athletic program provides opportunities for men and women to compete in NCAA Division III and the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) in 22 sports. Lynchburg has won 204 conference titles and produced 249 All-Americans. In 2014, the women’s soccer team won the NCAA Division III championship, the first team national championship in Lynchburg’s history. Lynchburg students can also play a variety of intramural and club sports.\n\nShellenberger Field, named for a legendary Lynchburg soccer coach, is state-of-the-art with artificial turf, an eight-lane track, night lighting, and a 3,000-spectator-capacity stadium.\n\nTuition and Fees\n\nTuition, fees, and room and board costs for the 2021-22 school year total $45,990 (assumes a residential student, who lives in a traditional residence hall with an unlimited meal plan.)\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nAt Lynchburg, 100% of traditional, first-year students receive financial aid, and 100% also receive an academic award. The average financial aid package (scholarships, loans, and work-study) totals $35,611.\n\nNational Recognition\n\nThe University of Lynchburg has acquired a national reputation as an institution that offers quality educational opportunities while building the character and leadership ability of its students.\n\nClaytor Nature Center\n\nClaytor Nature Center, in nearby Bedford County, is a 470-acre outdoor classroom and laboratory dedicated to the study and appreciation of our natural environment. It includes the A. Boyd Claytor III Education and Research Facility; Belk Astronomical Observatory; Cloverlea, an antebellum farmhouse with landscaped gardens; numerous natural features; and the Chandler Eco-Lodge.\n\nDaura Museum of Art\n\nThe Daura Museum of Art houses Lynchburg’s art collection, including paintings, drawings, prints, and sculptures by Pierre Daura and other American and European artists.
