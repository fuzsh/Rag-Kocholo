        "text": "Lynchburg\n\nLynchburg specializes in the relaxing life with cosmopolitan appeal, offering something for everyone.\n\nIn the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and alongside the scenic James River, Lynchburg provides both an urban oasis and recreational playground. This small city is centrally located in Virginia, and offers adventure, entertainment, and relaxation less than four hours from Washington D.C. via Amtrak or automobile, less than two and one half hour’s drive from Greensboro, N.C. and accessible via local airport from anywhere in the world. Lynchburg is the perfect place to fish the James River, its tributaries and Clemmons Lake at Ivy Creek Park, and is less than an hour drive from two state parks and the Blue Ridge Parkway. Add a few extra days stay to experience the sites, flavors and history of the Central Virginia region.\n\nAfter a fun day fishing, enjoy chef-inspired local cuisine, take part in the vibrant art scene or explore the region’s museums and historic landmarks.\n\nSmallmouth bass are the dominant game species here, but other species are plentiful, such as channel catfish, flathead catfish, muskellunge and various sunfish species. If you’re looking for a fishing spot with added fun, come discover Lynchburg!"
