        "text": "LYNCHBURG, Va. (WSET) -- Lynchburg is one of the fastest growing cities in our part of the state.\n\nAccording to Census data released this week, the city grew about a half percent last year.\n\nExperts told ABC 13, rises and declines are not usually high numbers year-to-year. You want to look at long term gains or losses.\n\nSince 2010, Lynchburg grew about 3.2 percent Roanoke only 1.8 and Danville fell more than 3.8 percent.\n\nOne of the driving factors for people coming or leaving a city is jobs.\n\nLynchburg college professor of economics Dr. Gerald Prante said, many communities in southside and southwest Virginia are losing people.\n\nHe says higher education institutions contribute to keeping Lynchburg on the positive trend.\n\nThe growth follows a nationwide trend.\n\n\"People are moving back to cities. We saw this flight away from cities for a long time now people are moving back to cities, and Lynchburg is one of those,\" Dr. Prante said.\n\nHe said a growing population means a growing tax base.\n\nThis allows for more or possibly higher quality services from local government, and it's vice versa if areas are losing population.\n\nFor cities struggling to keep people, the answer is jobs according to Dr. Prante.\n\nPeople follow where there are openings."
