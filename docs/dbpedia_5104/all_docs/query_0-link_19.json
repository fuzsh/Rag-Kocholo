        "text": "Kamchak Tuchuk\n\nI've got one of these units that once belonged to my Grandfather. I don't have the test probes\n\nthough. Figure I need to fashion my own, if possible. Question is regarding the RF probe and also\n\nthe audio probe. What does the RF probe consist of? What kind of connector is this? BNC or\n\nsomething? The audio probe apparently has two inputs so it seems theres more to it than just a\n\nnormal test probe. What would I need to do there? Thanks for any help."
