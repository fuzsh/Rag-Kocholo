        "text": "Welcome to Downtown Lynchburg, Virginia\n\nLocated east of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Downtown Lynchburg is one of the most vibrant parts of the city. Street art scatters the walls and walkways, while local businesses fill the storefronts on our historic Main Street and beyond. Downtown LYH is the perfect backdrop for any occasion or event, from a concert to movie nights or weddings. Lynchburg is known as the City of Seven Hills. These hills represent various neighborhoods that make up the history and founding of the city. The seven hills are College Hill, Daniel’s Hill, Diamond Hill, Federal Hill, Franklin Hill, Garland Hill, and White Rock Hill.\n\nCity of Lynchburg’s History\n\nIn the early years of Lynchburg, tobacco and iron were the primary outputs. Through John Lynch’s ferry system on the James River, Downtown Lynchburg quickly became one of the largest tobacco markets in the United States. The James Calloway Furnace, which operated from 1770 until 1779, and the Davie Ross Furnace, which operated from 1781 until 1837, supplied the Continental Army with pig iron and cannonballs during the American Revolution. Lynchburg served as a major storage depot during the Civil War, as well.\n\nOver the last 20 years Downtown Lynchburg has received a lot of revitalization efforts through its affiliation with a Main Street Community and through major renovations of historic buildings like the Virginian Hotel, Craddock Terry Hotel, Academy Center of the Arts, and redeveloped loft-style apartments.\n\nWhat you can find in downtown Lynchburg?\n\nMain Street is the heart of Downtown Lynchburg. Boutiques, restaurants, cafes and other shops reside in unique, historic buildings with large front windows.
