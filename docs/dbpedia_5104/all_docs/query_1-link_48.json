        "text": "Welcome! And thank you for your interest in the University of Lynchburg. International students who are accepted and enrolled here can be sure that they will be part of a supportive campus community and safe learning environment.\n\nWe appreciate the different perspectives of our students, and welcome students from all over the world to join our community and make a difference. One of our alumni, Setsuko Thurlow, won the Nobel Peace Prize. She came to the U.S. from Japan shortly before she enrolled at the University of Lynchburg. Maybe you will be next to make an impact on the world because of your University of Lynchburg education.\n\nOur Campus Community\n\nWe offer a wide variety of courses in business and we have a long history of success in the sciences and health-related fields. Our fine arts program is especially strong and we have nationally-ranked athletic programs.\n\nOur students receive a well-rounded education that is based in the liberal arts and sciences, with professional studies and a residential community that support their growth.\n\nLynchburg offers many opportunities for the people of Central Virginia. These include cultural opportunities, services, and the work of students and staff. We also have a variety of Quick Facts about us that you can read.\n\nHousing\n\nThe University of Lynchburg guarantees four years of housing to all students. During their first year, all students must live in a residential dorm on campus. After their first year, we offer many other options for our students, including townhouses, apartments, and houses which are next to the campus. All these housing options are owned and operated by the University.\n\nUndergraduate international students are able to remain in campus housing for all breaks (fall, Thanksgiving, winter, spring, and summer).\n\nOur Location\n\nThe University of Lynchburg is located in the city of Lynchburg, Virginia, which is in the central part of Virginia.\n\nLynchburg is a small city of approximately 76,000 citizens surrounded by beautiful natural areas. It is very close to the tree-covered Blue Ridge mountains.\n\nLynchburg is not far away from big cities, though. Washington, D.C., the nation’s capital, is a half-day drive or train ride from Lynchburg. The Virginia state capitol, Richmond, is also within driving distance.\n\nIf you are interested in outdoor activities, Lynchburg is a great location. Nearby are many national parks. And, our Outdoor Leadership program provides guided hiking, camping, canoeing, and caving trips for students.\n\nCosts for 2024-25\n\nUniversity of Lynchburg’s costs include full-time tuition, housing, and meal plans during the semester.\n\nTuition: $36,750\n\nRoom and board: $13,700\n\nInternational orientation fee: $100\n\nThese are the direct costs you pay to the University.\n\nAs an international student, you will need an I-20 form to receive your visa. The U.S. government will need you to contribute more money for your education to cover things like travel, books, and personal expenses. These are not paid to the University, but students are required to show the ability to cover them. The current amount for these indirect costs is $4,500."
