But what sets them apart? David McDonald, our Director of Development, has the answer: 💼 BA - Business Analyst 💼 When it comes to the BA, or business analyst, it's all about the front-end functionality. They focus on ensuring a seamless user experience, from start to finish. Whether it's SaaS or PaaS solutions, their goal remains the same: deliver excellence in user interaction. 💻 BSA - Business Systems Analyst 💻 On the other hand, the BSA, or business systems analyst, delves into the backend systems and integrations that power the digital ecosystem. Their realm is all about understanding the business processes and how software can best support them. Whether you're a BA or a BSA, understanding these nuances is essential for success in the ever-evolving digital landscape. #BusinessAnalysis #BusinessSystemsAnalyst #DigitalSolutions #BrillianceBusinessSolutions"
