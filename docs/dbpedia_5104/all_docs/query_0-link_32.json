        "text": "arne thormodsen\n\nPost by DumpsterDiver\n\nFrom the photos it looks like it might be using either a UV-201 or a\n\nUV-201A tube. In either case, that's a pretty valuable tube for\n\neveryday use. If it's a \"rainbow\" tube,it's even more valuable.\n\nYou\n\nPost by DumpsterDiver\n\nmight want to switch to a more common version of the 01A tube ...\n\nlikely perform even better too. If it's a UV-201, you'll also get much\n\nmore life from your \"A\" batteries if you swap it for a common 01A.\n\nDD\n\nI haven't done much research, in fact I haven't done anything with\n\ntubes at all for about 25 years. I learned just enough from the\n\ninternet to not burn up the filaments when I first lit up the tubes,\n\nand that the B voltage should be around 45 V. Also that because they\n\nhad brass bottoms and little nipples on top they were pretty old.\n\nThere are some numbers barely visible on the tubes, maybe I can work\n\nthem out.\n\nOne pulls about 0.25A at 5 volts. It's partially metallized inside\n\n(Mg getter?), with a bit of a rainbow effect. Is this what you mean?\n\nThe other tube pulls near 1A at 5 volts. It's pretty much just clear\n\nglass.\n\nBoth tubes work, but the one that pulls 0.25A is considerably more\n\nsensitive. It's the one I pulled in the UT station with.\n\nI'm treating them very nicely, in case you are wondering. They get\n\npacked up in soft material and put back in a metal container when I'm\n\nnot using them. I figured authentic replacements would set me back a\n\npretty penny.\n\nActually I may try to get it to work with a FET if I can. I've seen\n\nsome circuits I might be able to adapt without changing much of the\n\nwiring in the radio.\n\n--arne"
