        "text": "LYNCHBURG, Va. (WDBJ) - In a strategic move to address the evolving needs of the medical cannabis industry, the University of Lynchburg has partnered with Green Flower to launch a new online program.\n\nThe program starts May 6, 2024 with tuition costing $2,950.\n\nGreen Flower is an industry leader in cannabis education.\n\nRoanoke College introduced a cannabis studies major starting this fall, and now The University of Lynchburg will offer a Cannabis Healthcare and Medicine certificate starting in May.\n\nExperts emphasize why it’s crucial to include these studies to meet the demand for a skilled medical cannabis workforce.\n\n“It’s a sign of the times that [The] University of Lynchburg is getting involved in cannabis education. And it should be seen as a loud signal to take this seriously, that the industry is here, and there’s a lot of good to be provided by getting involved,” said Green Flower CEO Max Simon.\n\nThe cannabis healthcare and medicine program is 100% online and takes six months to complete. The program is led by doctors, physicians, and medical cannabis experts with a deep understanding of cannabis as a medicine.\n\nLegalized in 24 states, experts say marijuana’s expansion is only beginning.\n\n“As it becomes legal in more states, we know the industry is growing and we want to make sure practitioners and dispensaries have the right information to share with their parents,” said John Zinn, executive director of the Professional Development Institute at The University of Lynchburg.\n\nThe program is split into eight three-week courses.\n\n“This program really goes into a deep dive about how cannabis can be used as a medicine. That does include the science and the research that includes an understanding of all the different cannabis product types and their mechanisms of action and how they work in the body. That includes talking about contraindications and where people need to be more cautious around using cannabis,” said Simon.\n\nPeople looking to start a business, expand their medical practice, or get a job in the medical cannabis industry could benefit from taking the course, Simon adds.\n\nThis is a non-credit professional development program and not part of the academic program on campus for students. More information about the PDI can be found here.\n\nAs for where the current marijuana legislation stands in the state. Democrats in the House and Senate have agreed on a compromise that would allow sales to start next year. But its future is still uncertain with the possibility of a veto from Governor Glenn Youngkin.\n\nThe PDI also announced four major programs: the Cannabis Healthcare & Medicine Certificate, the Certified End of Life Specialist, along with two business-related programs: Small Hinges Swing Big Doors and 7 Keys to Work Positive Coaching."
