In the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and alongside the scenic James River, Lynchburg provides both an urban oasis and recreational playground.

Lynchburg is the perfect place to fish the James River, its tributaries and Clemmons Lake at Ivy Creek Park, and is less than an hour drive from two state parks and the Blue Ridge Parkway. Add a few extra days stay to experience the sites, flavors and history of the Central Virginia region.

After a fun day fishing, enjoy chef-inspired local cuisine, take part in the vibrant art scene or explore the region’s museums and historic landmarks.

Smallmouth bass are the dominant game species here, but other species are plentiful, such as channel catfish, flathead catfish, muskellunge and various sunfish species. If you’re looking for a fishing spot with added fun, come discover Lynchburg!
