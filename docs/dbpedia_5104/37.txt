Lynchburg, city, administratively independent of, but located in, Campbell and Bedford counties, south-central Virginia, U.S. It is situated on the James River, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The city grew from a ferry landing settled in 1757 by Quakers; it was named for John Lynch, the ferry operator who owned the original town site. During the American Revolution, John’s patriot brother, Charles, set up an irregular court and imposed savage penalties on Tories, giving rise to the expressions “lynch law” and lynching.

The town flourished after the James River and Kanawha Canal (1840) connected it with Richmond, Virginia, 110 miles (177 km) east and after the arrival of the railroad in 1852. During the American Civil War, Lynchburg was a Confederate supply base and the scene of General Jubal A. Early’s victory over General David Hunter’s Union troops (June 1864); the restored Fort Early commemorates the event. Old City Cemetery holds the graves of more than 2,000 Confederate soldiers.

Following the war, Lynchburg developed as a shoe- and iron-manufacturing centre. Its importance as a market for dark tobacco (for chewing and cigars) decreased with the increased use of bright tobacco (for cigarettes). Lynchburg’s modern economy includes manufacturing (textiles, steel products, and pharmaceuticals) and agriculture (tobacco, corn [maize], and other grains).
