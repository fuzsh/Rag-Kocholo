Lynchburg is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia, located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains along the banks of the James River. Lynchburg is known as the "City of Seven Hills" or the "Hill City". Lynchburg was named for its founder, John Lynch. When about 17 years old, he started a ferry service at a ford across the James River to carry traffic to and from New London, where his parents had settled. The "City of Seven Hills" quickly developed along the hills surrounding Lynch's Ferry.
