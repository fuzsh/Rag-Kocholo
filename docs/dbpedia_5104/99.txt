LYNCHBURG, Va. (WSET) -- Lynchburg is one of the fastest growing cities in our part of the state.

According to Census data released this week, the city grew about a half percent last year.

Experts told ABC 13, rises and declines are not usually high numbers year-to-year. You want to look at long term gains or losses.

Since 2010, Lynchburg grew about 3.2 percent Roanoke only 1.8 and Danville fell more than 3.8 percent.

One of the driving factors for people coming or leaving a city is jobs.

Lynchburg college professor of economics Dr. Gerald Prante said, many communities in southside and southwest Virginia are losing people.

He says higher education institutions contribute to keeping Lynchburg on the positive trend.

The growth follows a nationwide trend.

"People are moving back to cities. We saw this flight away from cities for a long time now people are moving back to cities, and Lynchburg is one of those," Dr. Prante said.

He said a growing population means a growing tax base.

This allows for more or possibly higher quality services from local government, and it's vice versa if areas are losing population.

For cities struggling to keep people, the answer is jobs according to Dr. Prante.

People follow where there are openings.
