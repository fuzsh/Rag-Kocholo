        "text": "Wine label win caps fast-paced semester\n\nThe fall semester was already going well for Emer O’Brien, a graphic design student at Finger Lakes Community College.\n\nShe and her volleyball teammates captured the regional championship on Halloween with a win over Fulton Montgomery Community College, earning a trip to the national competition in Minnesota.\n\nA few weeks later, the viticulture and wine technology students selected her proposed design for the next label of the College’s 2021 vintages.\n\n“It’s a huge honor,” she said of knowing 1,700 bottles will be wrapped with her Synthesis No. 10 label. She offered a simple design with the name bisecting a circle on a solid color background, a deep green for the whites and a burgundy for the reds.\n\nContinue reading “Wine label win caps fast-paced semester”\n\nFLCC initiative part of national pilot to improve rural education, training\n\nFinger Lakes Community College has selected Bloomfield Central School and the Yates County Workforce Development Office as sites for a 16-week community-based training course for people who may lack internet and transportation.\n\nThe course is part of a national pilot project to develop best practices for rural education that institutions across the country can adopt.\n\nThe Bloomfield Operations Center Learning Lab at 1 Oakmount Avenue and the Yates County Workforce Development Office at 417 Liberty St. in Penn Yan will begin offering classes Jan. 24 to train local residents as certified production technicians (CPT).\n\nCPT is a credential recognized by manufacturers across the country. Graduates of the program will gain skills in workplace safety, quality and measurement, and modern manufacturing processes.\n\n“The CPT credential offers a lot of desirable skills that will serve the candidates well. We do believe the program will provide candidates an advantage in moving into the advanced manufacturing field,” said Jim VanKouwenberg, training coordinator at Optimax in Wayne County. Optimax, maker of optical lenses and coatings, is hiring seven to eight people per month, and offering health and retirement benefits and profit sharing.\n\nContinue reading “FLCC initiative part of national pilot to improve rural education, training”\n\nBoard welcomes student trustee for 2021-22\n\nThe Finger Lakes Community College Board of Trustees has welcomed a new student trustee, Sophia Parshall, who grew up in Naples and is now studying nursing.\n\nParshall, who was homeschooled, began attending FLCC as a high school junior through the Early College Scholars program. Early College Scholars provides a 50 percent tuition discount to youth who have not yet graduated from high school and want to get ahead on college credits. Parshall took advantage of the program to begin pre-requisite courses for nursing.\n\n“I decided to study nursing because I have a passion for helping people and have wanted to be a nurse since I was 7 years old. My mom is a nurse and graduated from FLCC when I was about 5 or 6,” she said.\n\nParshall is interested in specializing in women’s health. Her current plan is to transfer after graduation in 2023 to the University of Rochester, which has a program enabling registered nurses with an associate degree to get a bachelor’s in 16 months. After that, she may enroll in the nurse midwifery program at Frontier University in Kentucky.\n\n“When I was little, I remember begging my mom to let me do a pretend ultrasound on her belly when she was pregnant with one of my siblings,” she added. “Women’s health has always fascinated me, especially finding ways to make women’s health care more accessible for everyone.”\n\nParshall will serve on the 10-member Board of Trustees through the 2021-22 academic year and have full voting rights as a trustee. She works on campus as a science tutor, admissions tour guide, and staff for the COVID-19 pooled surveillance testing program.\n\n“I have been taking classes at FLCC since I was 15,” she said. “I love this school and it has become sort of like my home as I spend so much time here.”\n\nFLCC grad’s bird sighting is a first for New York\n\nIt’s not a standard job title: piping plover technician.\n\nFor nearly a year, Sarah Forestiere, a 2018 graduate of Finger Lakes Community College, has monitored two nesting pairs of the federally endangered shorebird at Sandy Island Beach State Park on Lake Ontario, for the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Only 60 nesting pairs are known to be scattered throughout the Great Lakes.\n\nShe has kept records of the birds’ activity, taught park visitors about piping plovers, and set up snow fence around their nests to protect their eggs and the chicks, which she describes as “cotton balls that weigh the same as two pennies.”\n\nAll this made Forestiere qualified to recognize that a visitor to Sandy Island on Sept. 13 was a plover, but not a piping plover.\n\nShe checked guides and concluded it was a snowy plover, common to the southern and western U.S. and the Caribbean. She confirmed her find with an amateur birdwatcher, Matt Brown, who encouraged her to post it on the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s eBird app.\n\nIt caused an immediate stir.\n\n“The snowy plover observation was significant for birders and ornithologists as it represented the first record of the species for the state of New York and one of only a few dozen from the northeast and Great Lakes area in general,” said Jay McGowan, multimedia collections specialist at the Cornell Lab.\n\nContinue reading “FLCC grad’s bird sighting is a first for New York”\n\nAlumni Spotlight: The answers within us\n\nDoyle Pruitt ’98 built a career helping people in traumatic circumstances find a way forward.\n\nRight before her senior year in high school, Doyle Pruitt’s family moved to Canandaigua, a tight-knit community where many of the other teens had grown up together.\n\nShe felt like an outsider but only until she started classes at FLCC in fall 1996.\n\n“I felt like here I did fit in,” she said. “The professors saw beyond what clique you belonged to. It allowed me to explore who I was and what I wanted without having to explain myself.”\n\nAt FLCC, Doyle began her deliberate pursuit of a career in clinical social work, starting with her associate degree in human services in 1998, followed by a bachelor’s in social work and psychology from Nazareth, then a master’s in social work at Syracuse University. She earned a Ph.D. from the University at Buffalo in 2013.\n\nNow a licensed clinical social worker with a private practice in Canandaigua, she specializes in the assessment and treatment of trauma and sexually harmful behaviors in children. Her decision to devote her life to such weighty matters began in her teens.\n\n“My whole career has focused on trauma, and it came from in high school, having friends disclose to me they had been sexually abused,” Doyle explained, noting two of those three friends were young men. “I couldn’t do much to help my friends. I didn’t want other kids to go through what they went through.” Continue reading “Alumni Spotlight: The answers within us”\n\nWhat are mycelia and why is FLCC growing them?\n\nThe College is helping a company determine if there is a faster way to grow the nutrient-dense root-like parts of mushrooms.\n\nDemetrice Garcia carefully positions a large flask of orange liquid in an autoclave, an oven-like device, to sterilize it for growing another batch of mushroom fibers.\n\nDemetrice, or “Demi,” and her fellow research assistants, Philip Simmons and Matthew Brooks, are culturing mycelia, the white root-like filaments that, in the wild, extend from mushroom caps into rotting logs.\n\nThey work in the lab at Finger Lakes Community College, trying to answer questions that could lead to a number of commercial products: What conditions promote the fastest growth of mycelia and the bioactive compounds these fibers produce?\n\nTheir work is supported by the National Science Foundation, which funds a variety of programs to promote science education and opportunities for students to pursue careers in science. The exciting part is that this is not a lab exercise. Continue reading “What are mycelia and why is FLCC growing them?”\n\nA graduate’s story: ‘I cannot just give up’\n\nIvan Castillo-Serrano ’20 defied the odds and the doubters to become an FLCC graduate and emergency room nurse.\n\nAfter high school, Ivan Castillo-Serrano planned to pay his way through a veterinarian program. He did not want to burden his dad, who already worked long hours.\n\nSince good jobs were hard to find in his hometown in the Mexican state of Puebla, the solution seemed simple: Go to the U.S., work for a year, and bank some cash.\n\n“My mom was heartbroken,” he said. “My dad said, ‘OK, if you want to go, I support you, but it’s hard, it’s dangerous.’”\n\nA year became two, then four, then six, and instead of going back, he met his wife, Erin, became a U.S. citizen and graduated from FLCC’s registered nursing program. Now an emergency room nurse at Newark-Wayne Community Hospital, he can tell you his plan turned out to be anything but simple.\n\nIvan remembers the day and time, Jan. 7, 2006, 8 p.m., when he arrived in Nogales, Mexico, hiding in a dump truck with nine others, his heart beating so fast he could barely breathe. Someone gave the signal and, “We jumped the wall and we ran,” he said. Ivan rode in cars, lying flat on the floor, until meeting up in Mesa, Ariz., with his uncle, who got him a construction job.

Nye has appointed Adam W. Rathbun as vice president of administration and finance.\n\nAs a member of the college’s senior leadership team, Rathbun is responsible for maintaining the college’s fiscal health and efficient administrative functions. This includes financial and business services, the operating budget, facilities and grounds, campus police, environmental health and safety and enterprise risk management.\n\nRathbun has more than 20 years in government and higher education operations, including roles with the National Security Agency (NSA) and Carnegie Mellon University. He most recently served as director of finance and business for Pennsylvania State University’s Beaver Campus, where he led the development and execution of a campus master plan.\n\nRathbun has a master of business administration (MBA) from the University of Baltimore and a master’s certificate in project management from the University of Pittsburgh. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps and the Maryland Air National Guard.\n\nRathbun is also a New York community college graduate, having earned an associate degree in computer information systems from Orange County Community College in Middletown."
