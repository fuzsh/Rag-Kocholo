        "text": "I see them as hugely influential in transition from the 60's to the 70's. I think what these rock gods saw in them was authenticity and hoping a bit of it would rub off.\n\nThis band helped launched Mad Dog and Englishmen, Little Feat, and Derick and the Dominoes. Three of my favorite all timers. And, as mentioned, Duane Allman played w and loved these guys as well. Pretty highfalutin Rock Icons as fans I'd say.\n\nSidemen deluxe w Rita Coolidge, and Bobbby Keys. And oh yea, that other guy playing rhythm.\n\nClapton and Harrison look sooo serious. And Clapton looks as if he's just laboring over what seems to be some simple riff fills w no epic solos. It looks like he might of whiffed one too many lines and got a bit tight. Harrison doesn't look much better.\n\nNow... Bonnie and Delaney are having a hoot along w the rest of the band and putting out some seriously righteous jamming. Bonnie is so fun to watch and what a perfect blue eyed soul voice she has for this music.\n\nI had missed this thread, sooo--yeah, that first LP, \"Home\" on STAX, is terrific.\n\nI have this theory that \"We Can Love\" was inspired by a lot of the stuff that Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell had been doing . . . call it homage, I guess, because it's too strong a song to be called a \"knockoff.\" Honestly, I have to think IF it had been released as a single and gotten a decent push at radio, it could've been their first real hit (rather than, um, \"Never-ending love\" . . .\n\nI DO NOT know all of the details of their experience, but a lot of the key players were involved, and it's just a really strong album throughout; but, given the circumstances--it came out with that big wave of 28 LP's at once as STAX tried to recover from losing its back catalog and its two most successful acts, Otis and Sam & Dave--my \"hunch\" is that it sort of got lost in the shuffle . . .\n\nHeck, it's no wonder--they weren't easy to categorize--very soulful, but probably viewed as more of a rock act. Given the pressure on STAX to generate hits QUICKLY and the natural inclination of their small but growing promo team, you could see where D&B wouldn't necessarily be the first thing they pulled from the bag when approaching program directors . . .\n\nd\n\nInteresting. A lot of talent during that period to try to shine though.\n\nI'm always interested in who influenced the influencers. What was it that people like Clapton, George and Harrison saw in them. It was more authentic than pop. It was new, fun and exciting. It was a melding of authentic American music: soul, rock, a dash of funk and cosmic Americana. For a short period of time they were the most exciting band on the planet.\n\nI. A G R E E\n\nmy all time favorite Delaney & Bonnie song.\n\nWish mofi did Home"
