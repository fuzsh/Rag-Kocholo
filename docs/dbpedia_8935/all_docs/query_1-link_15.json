Led by lifelong musicians Will Turner and Georgie Fuller, the Brighton, UK-basedband began with a shared ambition of “making records that sound like our favorite records ever,”and soon arrived at a reverb-drenched collision of psychedelia and blues, acid rock andsunshine pop. As revealed on their gloriously hazy debut EP Life and Life Only, The HeavyHeavy breathe an incandescent new energy into sounds from decades ago, transcending eraswith a hypnotic ease.In dreaming up Life and Life Only, The Heavy Heavy tapped into many of the musicaltouchstones that Turner describes as “deeply entrenched in our psyche”: Peter Green-eraFleetwood Mac, the Rolling Stones, British Invasion pop acts like the Hollies, folk-blues duoDelaney & Bonnie, to name just a few. Pushing past the confines of reverential pastiche, theband imbues their output with a strangely charmed quality and heady authenticity undeniablytied to their status as artists on the fringe, both philosophically and geographically. To that end,Turner hails from the remote town of Malvern, an enchanted stretch of the English countrysideonce frequented by the likes of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath and Kate Bush. “It’s famous forthe healing qualities of its water, and there are ancient trees where the Druids used toworship—there’s a sort of magical-hippie aspect to it,” he notes. Fuller, meanwhile, elevatesevery track with her spellbinding vocals and magnetic yet wholly unaffected presence, buildingupon a kaleidoscopic career that’s included performing at Montreux Jazz Festival as a teenageras well as acting in the London theater.Rooted in their effusive harmonies and fuzzed-out guitar work, Life and Life Only contains thefirst track Turner and Fuller ever recorded as The Heavy Heavy, a lilting piece of psych-poptitled “Go Down River.” “I’d had this song a while and couldn’t quite finish it, but then onceGeorgie added her vocals it all came together,” Turner recalls. “The male-female harmoniesgave it this whole new sound; it just felt like lying in the green grass on a hot sunny day.”Self-produced in a London flat, the six-track project also brings that transportive power to songslike “Miles and Miles” (a bright and jangly number whose whirlwind velocity calls to mindlate-’60s/early-’70s road dramas like Easy Rider and Vanishing Point), “Man of the Hills” (agroove-heavy homage to Turner’s otherworldly hometown), and “Sleeping on Grassy Ground” (asweetly languid epic featuring a near-operatic vocal performance from Fuller, a classicallytrained singer).With their full-length debut due out in 2023, The Heavy Heavy recently expanded their lineup tofive members, allowing for an even more vast and bombastic sound now touched with heavenlyfour-part harmonies. A massively prolific outfit who’ve written and recorded hundreds of songsin the last two years alone, the band feels perpetually inspired by the pursuit of making musicthat provides a rarefied pleasure. “The driving force behind all our songwriting is to feel good,and to make other people feel good too,” Fuller points out. And thanks to their uncanny grace assonic alchemists, The Heavy Heavy ultimately perform a certain magic with their music: elicitinga sublime daze that goes far beyond pure escapism.  About Matthew Fowler  Documenting all the joy and wonder and heartbreak and confusion of life in your early 20s, Matthew Fowler’s stunning labeldebut,The Grief We Gave Our Mother, is a profoundly personal work of self-discovery and introspection, but more thanthat, it’s an ode to growing up and chasing dreams. The songs here wrestle with love and loss in the face of ambition andindependence, and the arrangements are captivatingly complex to match, layering dynamic guitars, breathy woodwinds,and lush harmonies into a transcendent soundscape that blurs the lines between traditional roots music and experimentalchamber folk. The result is a record that’s at once bold and timid, hopeful and anxious, world-weary and naïve, an honest,revelatory collection all about forging a life of purpose, passion, and meaning.
