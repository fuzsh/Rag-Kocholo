        "text": "“You have to remember.”\n\nLee Humiston enlisted in the Air Force at 17-years old and joined the Orientation Group where he was surrounded by POWs and the history of their brave service. Today, he collects military memorabilia from across the world and displays it in his own museum and through loans to others to keep history alive for future generations. “The one word that is key to me is ‘remember’ because when you forget, you step into the myths and you step into the abyss of not knowing what history is,” Lee said. “You have to remember.”\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nA Book Filled with Memories\n\nStan Teller returned home from his service with the Navy during World War II and he stored his memories in a book in his attic. Those memories, and the stories of his incredible service, came flooding out when the book was found by his family. “I have a big entourage now and they’re all very interested to hear the stories. I didn’t expect anything like this. I went through it. I know what was there. I know what’s in the book. It’s just pictures. But now it means something because I will give it to my kids,” Stan said.\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nVery Necessary to Remember\n\nSean McClure was a father, a friend and a special forces soldier. Most importantly he was a role model, a hero and a brother. “I wear his bracelet. It says ‘A Brother Above All Brothers’ and I happen to have six brothers and he ranks top of all. If you ask my son, to this day, who his favorite uncle is, he’ll say Sean,” said Shawn McFaden. “Although there’s no blood tie amongst us, we’ve shared blood, sweat and tears. That’s our bond.”\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nForty-Four Years\n\n“My last shift will be bittersweet,” said Jon Rigolo, who spent 44-years serving his community with the fire service. He has learned some valuable lessons which he’s passed on to the next generation of firefighters but he is now looking forward to retirement. “March 27th is going to be my last shift at the firehouse. I think it’s going to be a difficult day.”\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nA Man of History\n\nIn 1975, Tom Glenn was on the last helicopter out of Saigon. His evacuation was part of Operation Frequent Wind in which 7,000 Americans and refugees were evacuated over 18 hours before the North Vietnamese People’s Army of Vietnam took over the city. He had remained late into the operation while he continued to send information to the National Security Agency as the North Vietnamese were approaching Saigon.\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nA Precious Commodity\n\nIn challenging circumstances, always do the right thing. Sometimes the right thing is the hardest thing to do, but always do the right thing,” said Ralph Galati who spent over a year as a POW after his jet was shot down and he was captured by the North Vietnam military. Today, he works to remember and share the lessons he learned during that difficult time. “This is not meant as a joke, I’m happy to be alive. Enjoy your freedom. It is a very, very precious commodity. I’m not sure that we all know how valuable it is and how rare it is.”\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\n“I just was there to help however I could”\n\nGreg Masi spent 40 years serving his community and his fellow hometown heroes in the city of Philadelphia. It was the realization of a childhood dream to become a public servant. “I remember as a young boy chasing fire trucks. When I would see the police cars in the neighborhood, I’d want to know what are they doing,” he said. “I just was there to help however I could. I’m extremely grateful to live my life the way I did as a public servant for the city of Philadelphia.”\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nIt was an honor and a privilege.\n\nFollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Veterans of World War II proudly served throughout Europe and the Pacific to protect the country they love. They captured territory, liberated concentration camps and risked their own lives in service and protection of the United States leaving a legacy of honor and service. “I was proud to serve in World War II. To me, it was an honor and a privilege,” WWII Navy Veteran, Dr. Robert Stromberg.\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nHis Actions Saved Their Lives\n\n“It was going to be Abe’s last mission and it turned into an ambush,” said Constance Howard. Her son, Lance Cpl. Abram Howard, was a US Marine who proudly followed in the footsteps of many of his family members when he joined the Marine Corps. Each year on the anniversary of his death, Constance spends time with the Marines from his unit to remember and honor her son. “Service to country is like signing that blank check. He signed a blank check to your country to do whatever it is to keep it safe.”\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nPrevention through Education\n\nAfter 35-years of responding to 911 calls, Gilbert Monroe has a new found passion within the fire service. In his role with Albemarle County Fire Rescue’s Community Risk & Resilience department he is working within his community to try to prevent those calls. “I absolutely love the position I’m in right now. It is one that I feel honored to be in. My years of service, seeing stuff that’s happened on those calls, gives me the opportunity to hopefully prevent those from happening,” Gilbert said.\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nA Passion For Training\n\n“Almost like a kid some days, if he knew it was a ropes day or he knew it was a water day he would get super excited about that. He enjoyed keeping those skills sharp,” said Celeste Flynn about her husband Nate who passed away while fighting a structure fire. His fire department has made it their mission to use the lessons learned during that night to better train other firefighters so something similar doesn’t happen again. “The ultimate goal of this is how can we keep this from happening to another firefighter and their family most importantly,” said Deputy Chief Gordon Wallace.\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nA Lifetime of Service\n\nLaudis Turney spent three years proudly serving in the Pacific during World War II and returned home to serve his community. Today, at 100-years-old, he is the oldest living member of the Laurel Volunteer Fire Department having served 75-years with the LVFD. “It’s very important. Volunteer fire service is based on that type of service, if you will, length of service. So, Laudis represents what all of us aspire to be, a life member,” said LVFD President, Vic Whipple.\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nA Tradition and a Celebration\n\nFor 111-years, the Scottsville Volunteer Fire Department has planned and executed the town’s Independence Day Parade. “We continue this tradition for the community,” said organizer, Tim Karr. “It’s about the fire department and service to the community. It takes the entire fire department. I’m just one of 54 members and I get tasked with organizing it. These are the guys that come out today and execute the plan that I put together.”\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nThe Strength of Our Nation\n\nWorld War II Veteran John Noto is surrounded by a loving family that honors the time he spent serving this country. “Family is the strength of our nation and don’t forget that. Family. Love your family, your children. I want to love one another and care for one another and to be there when they need help,” he said “I thank them for recognizing, not just me, but my generation. We hope that we left them a better life.”\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nAlways There\n\nBeth Mulloy learned early on in her time as a military spouse about the importance of supporting the whole family. “I learned this a long time ago when our first child was born with a heart condition and passed away. I remember the admiral’s wife, I had never met her before, showed up at our door to pay her condolences. I remember thinking at the time how difficult that was for her to come to our house and she didn’t even know us. I learned a lot from that.” Beth said. She became a leader in her own right by keeping her focus on supporting the whole family of those who serve this country.\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nBrotherhood on the Football Field and the Battlefield\n\n“The night I was wounded, Will willed himself to the CSH, Combat Support Hospital, where I was being operated on. He flew with me all the way from Baghdad to Germany, just talking to me, willing me to live. That’s brotherhood,” said Greg Gadson of his friend, fellow soldier and former Army Football Teammate, Will Huff. The valuable lessons Will learned on the playing field helped him during his military service. Now, he’s using those lessons that helped him on the battlefield to show others to serve their community through coaching on the playing field.\n\nWATCH VIDEO\n\nLetters from Vietnam\n\n“One of the best things I’ve heard about war is that there’s nothing normal about war.
