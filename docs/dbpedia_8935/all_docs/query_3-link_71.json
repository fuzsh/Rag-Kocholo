        "text": "FBI Report Warned of “War” at the Capitol\n\nA day before rioters stormed Congress, an FBI office in Virginia issued an explicit internal warning that extremists were preparing to travel to Washington to commit violence and “war,” according to an internal document reviewed by the Washington Post that contradicts a senior official’s declaration the bureau had no intelligence indicating anyone at last week’s pro-Trump protest planned to do harm.\n\nProsecutors Weigh Sedition and Conspiracy Charges\n\nThe top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., said today that more than 70 people tied to the Capitol riot had been charged with crimes and that he expected that number to rise into the hundreds, with prosecutors looking at charging some rioters with sedition and conspiracy, as the NYT reports.\n\nU.S. Expected to Require Covid-19 Tests for All International Visitors\n\nThe U.S. government is expected to require all international airline passengers to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test before boarding flights to the country, as the WSJ reports.\n\nPompeo Says Iran Gives al Qaeda New “Home Base”\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said today without providing hard evidence that al Qaeda had established a new home base in Iran and that it was time “for America and all free nations to crush the Iran-al-Qaeda axis,” as Reuters reports.\n\nGlobal Forecast 2021\n\n\"The United States might feel it is done with the Middle East, but the reverse isn’t true,\" writes CSIS's Jon B. Alterman in a new analysis of the U.S. role in the Middle East.\n\nGlobal Forecast is an annual collection of essays by CSIS experts focused on the critical issues facing the United States and the world in the year ahead.\n\nCoronavirus Crisis Update\n\nThe Coronavirus Crisis Update podcast brings you the latest updates and analysis from CSIS experts and the leaders directing the global response.

Far-right terrorists committed 67 percent of attacks and plots, far-left terrorists committed 20 percent, and extremists with other motivations (such as supporters of the Boogaloo movement) and Salafi-jihadists each committed 7 percent.\n\nThe Andreas C. Dracopoulos iDeas Lab at CSIS enhances our research with the latest in cutting-edge web technologies, design, and multimedia.\n\nOptics\n\n(Photo credit: Sarah Silbiger/POOL/AFP via Getty Images.)

During their short time performing and recording together, I think Delaney and Bonnie produced some of the very best rock and roll in history.\n\nEric Clapton, who performed with them in one of their Delaney & Bonnie and Friends iterations, is fond of saying that Delaney Bramlett taught him everything he knows about singing.\n\nThere isn’t a great deal of Delaney and Bonnie material out there. And their studio albums never quite measured up to their lighting hot live performances. But what we do have is a treasure.\n\nThis clip features the quintessential Delaney and Bonnie band. Several musicians in addition to Clapton would go on to form Derek and the Dominoes with EC: drummer Jim Gordon, bassist Carl Raddle and keyboardist Bobby Whitlock. The rest of the band was comprised of the great horn section Bobby Keys and Jim Price who did a pretty good job when they went on to perform with the Stones for most of the 70s. Rounding out the band was singer Rita Coolidge, who sang with so many great bands it’s impossible to count, plus won two Grammys for her own solo efforts."
