        "text": "“Alive and Kickin’ \"\n\n(Independent release to benefit The Tipitina’s Foundation)\n\nWe nearly lost Fats Domino last summer.\n\n/s He had decided to try to ride out Katrina, remaining in his lower Ninth Ward home even as floodwaters breached the levees and inundated his neighborhood.\n\nFor the first few hectic days after the hurricane, Domino was missing in action and believed to be a storm victim.\n\nThankfully, the early reports of his death were greatly exaggerated. A Coast Guard helicopter, it turns out, had plucked the 78-year-old Domino from his roof and ferried him to safety.\n\nHis new CD’s title song, a rich, fat-bottomed boogie, seems to speak directly to the near-tragedy:\n\n“All over the country, people wanna know\n\nWhat ever happened to Fats Domino?\n\nAnd I’m alive and kickin’\n\nI’m alive and kickin’\n\nI’m alive and kickin’\n\nAnd I’m where I wanna be …\"\n\nHe lost almost all of his belongings, including much of the treasured memorabilia of 60 years of performing, in the floodwaters. But he’s rebuilding his home, with its big star under the front cornice and the FD emblazoned over the porch.\n\nAnd he’s back on the scene as a live performer as well, scheduled to close down the 2006 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival on Sunday, May 7.\n\nGiven Domino’s narrow escape last summer and his current resurgence, the title of his new CD, “Alive and Kickin’ \", is entirely apropos. The fine music it offers -- the first new Domino recordings on the market in more than 12 years -- makes it even more so.\n\nActually, Domino recorded many of the album’s 13 tracks a decade ago. For some reason, they were shelved and forgotten. It took the destructive hurricane to churn them up to the surface.\n\n“Fats was looking for a meaningful way to give back to his hometown after Hurricane Katrina,\" said Tipitina’s Foundation co-founder Roland von Kurnatowski. Domino donated the unreleased recordings as a fund-raiser for the foundation, which was established to aid New Orleans musicians.\n\nThe foundation turned the tapes into the “Alive and Kickin’ \" CD. It’s available from www./stipitinasfoundation.org\n\nOver the years, the foundation has provided Crescent City music makers with everything from hot meals to legal services to more than $300,000 worth of new instruments. For musicians who lost everything in the storm and who lacked Domino’s resources to help the city recover. It has been a particular Godsend.\n\nBut musically speaking, this is no charity CD. It’s primo Domino. And that’s very, very good indeed.\n\nFats’ rich, Creole au lait voice is a bit softer these days but just as engaging and distinctive as ever, both on rockers like the winking-and-nodding “Give Me Some\" and vintage ballads like “Love You Till the Day I Did,\" which comes complete with Fats’ patented keyboard triplets.\n\nAnd his band, studded with veterans like Herb Hardesty and Fred Kemp on tenor sax and augmented by newer talents like Sonny Landreth on slide guitar, is just Crescent City gravy. Its groove, strut and funk are pure New Orleans.\n\nFats wrote all the songs on the new CD except for Bobby Charles’ “I Spent All My Money Loving You,\" which features a sizzling solo from Landreth; and Floyd Tillman’s country classic “It Makes No Difference Now,\" which gets the “Blueberry Hill\" treatment.\n\nThe only real miscue is a remake of an early Domino hit, “Ain’t That a Shame.\" The new version is OK but there’s no need to repaint the Mona Lisa, if you know what I mean.\n\nOtherwise, there’s a tasty blues, “Every Night About This Time,\" and a finger-popping hunk of funk, “Home USA.\"\n\nAnd tunes like “Four Leaf Clover\" beautifully resurrect the classic sound of Fats of the ’50s.\n\nAs if anyone needed any reassurance, on “I’ll Be All Right,\" Domino sings:\n\nIf anything happen to me\n\nNo matter where I’ll be\n\nI could be here\n\nI could be there\n\nI could be anywhere\n\nDon’t worry ’bout me …\n\nAs they say in New Orleans -- yeah, you right.\n\nThe A-List of Southern Music\n\n1.
