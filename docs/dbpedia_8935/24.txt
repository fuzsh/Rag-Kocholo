Delaney and Bonnie were a musical duo composed of husband-and-wife singer/songwriters Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett. They also fronted a rock/soul ensemble called Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, whose members at different times included Eric Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, Duane Allman, Gregg Allman, George Harrison, Leon Russell, Dave Mason, Rita Coolidge, and King Curtis.

Delaney Bramlett (July 1, 1939, Pontotoc County, Mississippi, United States – December 27, 2008, Los Angeles, California, United States) learned the guitar in his youth, and migrated to Los Angeles in 1959.[1] He became a session musician; his most notable early work was as a member of the Shindogs, the house band for the ABC-TV series Shindig! (1964–66), which also featured guitarist/keyboardist Leon Russell.

Bonnie Bramlett (née Bonnie Lynn O’Farrell, born November 8, 1944, Alton, Illinois, United States) was an accomplished singer at an early age, performing with blues guitarist Albert King at age 14 and in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue at 15[2] – the first-ever white Ikette “for three days in a black wig and Man Tan skin darkener.”[3] She moved to Los Angeles in 1967, and met and married Delaney later that year.
