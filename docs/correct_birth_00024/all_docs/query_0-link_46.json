        "text": "Widely regarded as one of the most innovative guitarists in music history, Johnny Allen Hendrix (later James Marshall “Jimi” Hendrix) was born on November 27, 1942 in Seattle, WA. In the short 27 years of his life, Hendrix redefined the possibilities of the electric guitar as an instrument, while expanding the capacity of an artist to affect social change.\n\nMulticultural in appearance and supernatural in performance, Hendrix burned guitars, dropped acid, oozed sex and rebellion, hated war and conformity, and generally scared the living hell out of straight-laced America. He did all of this while creating a body of music that still stands as completely unique and wildly inventive. Here’s a list of locations related to the life of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nRenton, WA\n\nJimi Hendrix Foundation– The headquarters of the nonprofit group dedicated to promoting the legacy of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nJimi Hendrix Memorial– The final resting place of Jimi Hendrix; location of the Jimi Hendrix Memorial.\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nJimi Hendrix’s birthplace– King County Hospital of Seattle is where Jimi Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942.\n\nLocation of Jimi Hendrix’s former boyhood home– Al Hendrix bought a home at this location in 1950 with a $10 down payment.\n\nHorace Mann Elementary School– Jimi Hendrix’s elementary school in Redmond, WA.\n\nWashington Middle School– Jimi Hendrix’s middle school in Seattle, WA.\n\nGarfield High School– Where Jimi Hendrix went to high school.
