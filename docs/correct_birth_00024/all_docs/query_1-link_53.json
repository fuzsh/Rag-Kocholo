        "text": "(1942–70), U.S. rock musician. One of the most influential performers in the history of rock, Jimi Hendrix earned legendary status with his mastery of the electric guitar. Although Hendrix’ wild, innovative instrumentals were widely imitated by scores of later rock musicians, his talent remained unparalleled.\n\nJohnny Allen Hendrix (he was renamed James Marshall Hendrix by his father at age 4) was born on Nov. 27, 1942, in Seattle, Wash., to Al Hendrix, an African American, and his wife, Lucille, a Cherokee. At age 16 Hendrix purchased his first acoustic guitar. Being left-handed, Hendrix turned the guitar upside down and taught himself to play by imitating blues legends Muddy Waters, B.B. King, and rock legend Chuck Berry. Hendrix played with local bands throughout high school and enlisted in the Army following graduation, only to be discharged several years later after suffering injuries from a parachuting accident.\n\nUsing the pseudonym Jimmy James, Hendrix returned to music. He toured the country, working as a pick-up artist for such acts as Sam Cooke, Little Richard, Curtis Mayfield, and Ike and Tina Turner. In 1964 Hendrix moved to New York and began playing the club circuit with the Isley Brothers. Two years later, he formed his own group, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. During a performance in Greenwich Village he was discovered by former Animals bassist Chas Chandler, who offered to manage him. Chandler convinced Hendrix to accompany him to London, where Hendrix teamed up with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bass player Noel Redding . Hendrix soon changed his name to Jimi, and formed the Jimi Hendrix Experience.\n\nThe trio’s debut single, “Hey Joe,” was an immediate hit, and it was followed by “Stone Free.” He had two more top-ten hits with “Purple Haze” and “The Wind Cries Mary.” The following year, the Experience performed in clubs in England, France, Belgium, and West Germany.\n\nHendrix’ debut album, Are You Experienced? (1967), a mix of psychedelic blues, acid rock, and Hendrix’ raw vocals, was first released in the United Kingdom. In June 1967 the Experience made its United States debut at the Monterey International Pop Festival in California. Hendrix’ fabled performance at that concert included playing his guitar with his teeth and then setting it on fire. Later that year the Experience embarked on a brief American tour with the Monkees, but Hendrix’ outrageous stage antics did not go over well with the Monkees’ teenybopper audience.\n\nHendrix spent the next few years touring Britain and the United States. Audience reception was mixed: the band was alternately cheered and booed. In 1968, at the height of his commercial and critical success, Hendrix released Axis: Bold as Love (1968) and Electric Ladyland (1968). Additional hit singles from this period included “Foxy Lady,” “Purple Haze,” a cover of Bob Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtower,” “Burning of the Midnight Lamp,” and “Voodoo Chile.”\n\nFollowing an incendiary performance at Woodstock in 1969, in which he performed “The Star-Spangled Banner,” simultaneously coaxing from his electric guitar the sounds of bombs falling and machine gun fire, the Jimi Hendrix Experience broke up, due in part to increasing personal, business, and drug problems. Pressured by black leaders to remain part of the music scene, Hendrix formed another group, the Band of Gypsys, which was also short-lived. In January 1970, during a concert before 19,000 fans at New York City’s Madison Square Garden, Hendrix walked out in the middle of his second number.\n\nYears of drug and alcohol abuse, coupled with the pressures of nonstop touring, eventually took its toll. Hendrix died of accidental suffocation in a drug-related incident on Sept. 18, 1970, in his girlfriend’s London apartment. Close to a hundred albums of Hendrix’ music have been released posthumously, a testimony to the public’s unending interest in Hendrix the artist and the rock icon. Jimi Hendrix was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992."
