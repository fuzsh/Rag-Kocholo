        "text": "The Jimi Hendrix Experience Biography\n\nJohnny Allen Hendrix, known as James Marshall “Jimi” Hendrix, an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Despite the fact that his mainstream career lasted only four years, he is considered as one of the most important electric guitarists in popular music history and among the most illustrious artists of the 20th century. He is referred to as “perhaps the finest instrumentalist in the history of rock music” by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was born on November 27, 1942, in Seattle, Washington. Hendrix picked up the guitar when he was 15 years old. He joined the US Army in 1961 but was released the following year. Soon after, he relocated to Clarksville and then Nashville, Tennessee, where he started performing chitlin’ engagements. Through these jobs, he was able to join the Isley Brothers‘ backing band and eventually Little Richard’s band, with whom he worked until the middle of 1965. Later, after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager, he performed with Curtis Knight and the Squires before relocating to England in late 1966. With the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Hendrix achieved three UK top ten successes in a short period of time: “Hey Joe,” “Purple Haze,” and “The Wind Cries Mary.” Following his appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, he rose to stardom in the US, and his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, peaked at number one in the US in 1968.\n\nIn order to perform at the Cheetah Club, one of New York City’s most well-known nightclubs, Hendrix briefly rejoined Curtis Knight and the Squires in May 1966, when he was struggling to make a living as an R&amp;B musician. Linda Keith, the partner of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, caught Hendrix playing live and was “mesmerized” by it. The two grew close after she asked him to join her for a drink.\n\nKeith gave Hendrix his recommendation to Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham and producer Seymour Stein while Hendrix was performing with Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. They rejected Hendrix because they did not recognize his musical ability. Chas Chandler, who was leaving the Animals and was interested in managing and producing artists, was recommended to him by Keith. In a nightclub in Greenwich Village, New York City’s Chandler witnessed Hendrix perform. Chandler believed he could produce a hit single with the right singer since he admired the Billy Roberts song “Hey Joe.” He took Hendrix to London on September 24, 1966, and signed him to a management and production deal with himself and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery after hearing Hendrix’s rendition of the song. Hendrix did an unexpected solo performance that evening at The Scotch of St. James, and they started dating. Their romance lasted for 2.5 years.\n\nAfter Hendrix arrived in London, Chandler started looking for musicians to join the Jimi Hendrix Experience, a band that would showcase his musical prowess. Hendrix first encountered guitarist Noel Redding at a New Animals audition, where Hendrix was pleased by Redding’s understanding of blues progressions and mentioned that he particularly loved Redding’s hairdo. Redding agreed when Chandler asked him if he wanted to join Hendrix’s band as the bass guitarist. After starting his search for a drummer, Chandler got in touch with Mitch Mitchell via a mutual friend not long after. In a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix, Mitchell, who had just been dismissed from Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, discovered they had a common love of rhythm and blues. Later that day, when Chandler called Mitchell to offer him the job, Mitchell accepted without hesitation. Additionally, Chandler persuaded Hendrix to spell his first name Jimi rather than Jimmy in order to make it sound more exotic.The inaugural performance of the Jimi Hendrix Experience took place on October 13, 1966, at the Novelty in Evreux.The band‘s oldest known recording is a 15-minute set they gave on October 18 at Paris’ Olympia theater, which was warmly welcomed.\n\nHey Joe, Purple Haze, and The Wind Cries Mary were three of Hendrix’s top ten UK successes with the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was admitted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, respectively. The band’s three studio albums, Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland, were listed among the top 100 albums of all time by Rolling Stone, who also placed Hendrix as the sixth greatest musician and guitarist of all time.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow Many Albums Did The Jimi Hendrix Experience Release?\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience released three albums during their time together as a band.
