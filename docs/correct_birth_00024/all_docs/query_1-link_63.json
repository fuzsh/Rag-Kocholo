        "text": "On this day in 1942, Johnny Allen Hendrix entered this world in Seattle, Washington. His parents renamed him James Marshall Hendrix to honor of his father, James Alan Hendrix and a late uncle, James Marshall Hendrix. The kid that would be proclaimed \"...the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\" didn't begin playing the guitar until he was 15. His first instrument was a ukulele he fished out of a batch of things that were being thrown away by a woman whose house Jimi and his father had been hired to clear out. Later that year, he bought a $5 acoustic guitar. From that day on, Hendrix either had a guitar in hand or one very close just about every waking hour.\n\nHis first band was named the Velvetones. He got an electric guitar in 1959 and ended up getting dropped by the band after his virtuoso solos started to command all the audience's attention.\n\nHendrix enlisted in the Army to avoid jail time after having been arrested while riding in a couple of cars that acquaintances had stolen. While based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Jimi crossed paths with Billy Cox. The pair formed a trio with a bass player and dubbed the group the Casuals. After Jimi was discharged from the Army, they relocated to Clarkesville, Tennessee and shifted band names to the King Kasuals.\n\nFrequent appearances in clubs put the young guitar wizard of the radar of people who brought him to the attention of well connected others, and before long Hendrix was getting offers to back established artists like Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson, Sam Cooke and others.\n\nAfter moving to New York City, Hendrix landed a spot in the Isley Brothers' touring band. He spent a good part of 1964 touring with them before jumping to Little Richard's backing band. A move to Greenwich Village and regular appearances at the Cafe Wha? helped spread the news about what an exceptional guitarist Jimi was.\n\nAnimals bass player Chas Chandler caught a set and soon after convinced Hendrix to accompany him to London so Jeff Beck, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton could see him play. All were equally impressed. The rest is history. Tragically, Jimi was only lived long enough to experience four years of it himself.\n\nOther Noteworthy events in Classic Rock on November 27 include...\n\n1965 Ken Kesey holds first Acid test.\n\n1967 Beatles release Magical Mystery Tour.\n\n1969 Jimi Hendrix attends opening night of 4 Rolling Stones concerts at Madison Square Garden.\n\n1970 George Harrison releases All Things Must Pass.\n\nGentle Giant releases self titled debut album\n\n1970 Kinks release Lola vs The Powermann & The Money-Go-Round.\n\n1971 Alice Cooper releases Killer.\n\n1972 Frank Zappa releases The Gran Wazoo.\n\n1974 Paul & Linda McCartney sing backing vocals during Rod Stewart London concert.\n\n1976 Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys appears on Saturday Night Live.\n\n1980 Allman Brothers release Reach For The Sky.\n\n1991 Freddie Mercury's private funeral is attended by just 35 invitees, including other Queen members and Elton John. His cremated remains are buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in West London.\n\n1995 John Popper of Blues Traveler appears on Rosanne tv show.\n\n1997 A deranged INXS fan attempts suicide by jumping from a balcony with a noose around his neck during the funeral of Michael Hutchence.\n\n2005 Rod Stewart becomes a father again as Penny Lancaster gives birth to a son."
