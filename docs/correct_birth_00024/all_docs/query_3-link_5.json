        "text": "If the weather seems a little purple hazy today don’t fret. Earlier this year, you voted Jimi Hendrix into our Mount Rushmore of Seattle Music and it’s about time we gave the rock icon even more love.\n\nHendrix came to fame in the 60s San Francisco music scene, but he was born + raised here, learning his electrifying guitar licks as a young kid in the Central District.\n\nHere’s where you can see his image and influence around town.\n\nBroadway + Pine\n\nRight outside a Capitol Hill art supply store you’ll find a bronze statue dedicated to the legendary guitarist striking a classic pose. Local artist Daryl Smith created it based on pics from the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. It was unveiled in 1997.\n\nMoPOP\n\nSeattle’s museum dedicated to pop culture naturally has a whole collection of Hendrix-related artifacts. See the fragments of a Fender Stratocaster the musician smashed in London and a handwritten love poem he wrote to one-time flame Kathy Etchingham.\n\nJimi Hendrix Park\n\nNear Garfield High where Hendrix went to school sits a park named after him. Visitors to the adjacent Northwest African American Museum can stroll the grounds outside to check out the park’s groovy “wave wall” and a chronological timeline of the artist’s life.\n\nSite of Sick’s Stadium\n\nOn July 26, 1970, Hendrix played his final Seattle show at Rainier Valley’s former baseball stadium during a soggy day reminiscent of Woodstock. The site is now a Lowe’s, so you can pick up lumber while reminiscing.\n\nGreenwood Memorial Park"
