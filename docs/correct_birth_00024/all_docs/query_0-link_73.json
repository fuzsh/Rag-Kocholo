        "meta_description": "Jimi Hendrix was of a mixed genealogy that included African American, Irish, and Cherokee ancestors. His paternal great grandmother, Zenora, was a full-blooded Cherokee from Georgia who married an Irishman named Moore. In 1883, they had a daughter whom they named Zenora \"Nora\" Rose Moore, Hendrix' paternal grandmother. The illegitimate son of a black slave woman named Fanny and her white overseer, Jimi's paternal grandfather, Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix (born 1866), was named after his biological father, a grain dealer from Urbana, Ohio, and one of the wealthiest white men in the area at the time. On June 10, 1919, Hendrix and Moore had a son they named James Allen Ross Hendrix (died 2002); people called him Al.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, Al met Lucille Jeter (1925â€“1958) at a dance in Seattle; they married on March 31, 1942. Drafted into the United States Army due to World War II, Al went to war three days after their wedding. Born Johnny Allen",
