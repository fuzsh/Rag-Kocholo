        "text": "The Central District\n\nThis small corner of town is where Jimi lived for over half of his short life. He was essentially raised by the neighborhood and just walking around the CD (as the Central District is known) helped me get a sense of one of the world’s most famous rockstars. Jimi was often seen skipping school with his guitar strapped to his back. He cut his teeth on that guitar on these very streets, visiting the homes of people he knew to play and persuading them to teach him.\n\nJimi’s level of poverty stunned even the poor. Throughout his childhood, he bounced around between cheap hotel rooms and apartments or bunking with various family and friends. Few of the original structures are still standing.\n\nNightlife\n\nJust around the corner, Jackson Street was a hub for legendary jazz clubs in it’s day. Clubs like the Rocking Chair hosted the likes of Ray Charles and Quincy Jones. Jimi’s mom worked at a speakeasy known as the Bucket of Blood — I toured it recently and was fascinated by the newly uncovered prohibition-era murals. Jimi’s parents, Al and Lucille, were fixtures on the scene, often leaving him and brother Leon to fend for themselves. These days on Jackson Street, you would hardly know. There’s a subtle nod to the street’s jazz roots above a Starbucks.\n\nThe Music\n\nJimi left Seattle for the army facing a jail sentence and returned 7 years later as a superstar. He played 4 shows in his hometown, two of them at Seattle Center Coliseum, now Key Arena. The Space Needle and Monorail had both gone up during his time away. His final Seattle show took place at Sick’s Stadium, now a Lowe’s hardware store. He always dedicated local shows to the kids at Garfield High.\n\nWe miss you, Jimi\n\nHaving spent the better part of a week driving around the city in search of Jimi, I found that scant has stood the test of time. It’s frustrating that his most significant childhood home was demolished, that the Spanish Castle Ballroom, immortalized in his song “Spanish Castle Magic,” is now a Walgreen’s, and Birdland, a club where he played early gigs is a Safeway. But whether it be the mural on the side of the Two Big Blondes consignment shop, or paintings adorning the walls of the Capital Grille and the Palladian Hotel, he’s here if you really look for him."
