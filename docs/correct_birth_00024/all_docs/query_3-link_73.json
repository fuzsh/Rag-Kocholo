        "text": "Get to know more about Jimi\n\nA lot of the artists we play on Absolute Radio have been incredibly influential in one way or another - but there are few who did more for rock music than the likes of Jimi Hendrix. We've taken a brief look at his life below and answered some of the Internet's biggest questions on the guitarist.\n\nHere at Absolute Radio, we love to celebrate the artists on our playlist all year round - this October for Black History Month we're shining a special spotlight on the amazing artists you hear on our station.\n\nWhen was Jimi Hendrix born?\n\nJimi Hendrix was born on 27th November 1942 in Seattle. He was originally named Johnny, but his parents changed his name to James in 1946 after his father, who went by 'Al', as his middle name was Allen. Jimi's mother was Lucille Jeter. Many fans wonder how old Jimi Hendrix would be today - and as of September 2020, he would be 78, turning 79 in November.\n\nHe had five siblings, one of whom is Leon Hendrix, an artist who released a biography about Jimi in 2012 entitled Jimi Hendrix: A Brother's Story.\n\nHow did Jimi Hendrix learn guitar?\n\nWhilst in elementary school, a social worker noticed that Jimi would carry a broom around with him, playing air-guitar on it in front of the other children. She requested school funding for underprivileged children, but was refused.\n\nWhen he was 14, Jimi was on a job with his dad and found an old ukelele with one string whilst clearing out an elderly woman's house. She let him have it, and Jimi began to learn how to play by ear, playing just one note on songs like 'Hound Dog' by Elvis Presley.\n\nAt 15, Jimi bought his first acoustic guitar for $5, practising for hours every day. He began jamming with friend Sammy Drain, and a year later met guitarist Billy Davis at a concert, who went on to show him various techniques on the guitar and got him a gig with a band.\n\nShortly after this, Jimi formed his first band - the Velvetones - but couldn't be heard on his acoustic over the other instruments, and convinced his father to buy him an electric guitar... And the rest is history.\n\nWhich guitar did Jimi Hendrix play?\n\nJimi's first electric guitar was a white Supro Ozark, but after it was stolen, his father replaced it with a red Silvertone Danelectro. However, Jimi was most well-known for his Fender Stratocaster, describing it as \"the best all-around guitar for the stuff we're doing.\"\n\nWas Jimi Hendrix left-handed?\n\nJimi was well-known for playing right-handed guitars upside down and restrung for the left hand. Many wonder whether Jimi used a pick, and he can be seen using picks in a lot of pictures.\n\nWho influenced Jimi Hendrix?\n\nJimi was thought to be influenced by the likes of Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Chuck Berry, and he told Guitar Player magazine that Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and B.B. King inspired him at the start of his career.\n\nJimi has also been cited as an influence by Prince, John Frusciante from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as well as Mike McCready and Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam. Other artists who have taken inspiration from Jimi are Ace Frehley of Kiss, Metallica's Kirk Hammett, Brad Whitford of Aerosmith and rock guitarist Joe Satriani.\n\nWas Jimi Hendrix in the army?\n\nJimi was in the US Army, having enlisted in 1961 as a preferable option to prison after being caught riding in stolen cars twice - but was discharged one year later, being granted a general discharge under honorable conditions.\n\nHendrix's platoon sergeant apparently filed a report which read, 'He has no interest whatsoever in the Army ... It is my opinion that Private Hendrix will never come up to the standards required of a soldier. I feel that the military service will benefit if he is discharged as soon as possible.'\n\nWas Jimi Hendrix in a band?\n\nJimi performed as a backing guitarist for the Isley Brothers and Little Richard, and in 1966 started to record with the Jimi Hendrix Experience. He also briefly played in a group called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, as well as Curtis Knight and the Squires and also Kings of Rhythm as a backing guitarist before Ike Turner fired him for his \"elaborate\" guitar solos.\n\nWas Jimi Hendrix married?\n\nJimi was never married, but had a long-term relationship with Kathy Etchingham for three years in the 60s and she was thought to be something of a muse for Jimi. He later had a relationship with German figure skater Monika Danneman, and it was at her flat in Notting Hill Gate, London, that he passed away.\n\nHow did Jimi Hendrix die?\n\nJimi was pronounced dead on Friday 18th September 1970 at the age of just 27-years-old. Just before his death, Jimi had not been well - he was fatigued from work, was suffering from a chronic lack of sleep and some sort of influenza-type illness. The coroner returned an open verdict on his death, but he had taken nine sleeping tablets the night before and sadly died of asphyxia.\n\nJimi Hendrix's grave is at Greenwood Cemetery in Renton near Seattle - the same place is his mother.\n\nIs Jimi Hendrix in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?\n\nJimi was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as part of The Jimi Hendrix Experience. The biography in the Hall of Fame for the band says, \"Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.\n\n\"Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as wah-wah and distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll.\"\n\nIs there a Jimi Hendrix film?\n\nThere sure is - Jimi: All Is by My Side was released in 2013, starring Outkast's Andr√© 3000 as Jimi himself, with Hayley Atwell as Kathy Etchingham.\n\nJimi Hendrix's life in pictures:\n\nBlack History Month is being celebrated throughout October.\n\nListen to Absolute Radio across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen or by asking your smart speaker to \"play Absolute Radio\"."
