        "text": "Owen Elliot-Kugell the daughter of Mama Cass Elliot from Mamas and the Papas stated that her mother 'didn't choke to death on a ham sandwich', adding that one of the most famous musical myths was simply not true. Talking about her mother's cause of death she said \"There was a ham sandwich, but she didn't eat it and she didn't choke on it. So enough with the jokes.\" And there have been a lot of jokes, for almost half a century, including by Mike Myers as Austin Powers. In the 1997 film, the special agent is seen writing a list of friends he knows in London and then scoring them out when he remembers they have died. After naming Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin he mournfully sighs: \"Mama Cass. Deceased. Ham sandwich.\"\n\nAmerican bassist Sweet Charles Sherrell died at his home in The Netherlands age 80. Sherrell began his career playing drums with fellow Nashville residents Jimi Hendrix and Billy Cox. He learned to play the guitar by washing the car (a Jaguar) of Curtis Mayfield in exchange for guitar lessons.
