        "text": "Transcript\n\nWashington is a state in the northwestern United States. It is the only state that is named after a president of the United States.\n\nWashington lies in the Pacific Northwest. The Pacific Ocean forms the state’s western border. Washington is the smallest state on the Pacific Coast, but it is densely populated.\n\nThe Cascade Mountain Range is Washington’s greatest physical feature. The Cascades divide Washington into two sections. The area west of the Cascades, around Puget Sound, is where more than half of the state’s people live. The land east of the Cascades is a plateau.\n\nThe highest peak in the Cascades, and in the state, is Mount Rainier. Another peak is Mount Saint Helens, an active volcano that last erupted in 1981.\n\nWhites make up about 70 percent of Washington’s population. Hispanics make up about 12 percent, and Asian Americans make almost 9. African Americans and others represent much less of the population.\n\nThe largest cities in Washington are Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, and Vancouver.\n\nWashington’s economy depends mostly on manufacturing and services.\n\nTechnology and Internet companies contribute a great deal to Washington’s economy.\n\nWashington is also known for its apple orchards. It produces more apples every year than any other state.\n\nNative Americans lived in the Washington area for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. They included the Chinook, the Coast Salish, the Nez Percé, and the Yakima.\n\nThe first European to visit the Washington area landed there in 1775. In 1792, both Great Britain and the United States claimed the region, which was then part of the larger Oregon country.\n\nEarly white settlers made a living by fur trading. In 1826, logging began.\n\nIn 1846, Britain and the United States agreed on the border between Canada and the Oregon country of the United States. Eventually the Oregon country was broken up into several separate territories. Washington was one of those. It became the 42nd state in 1889.\n\nJimi Hendrix, an African American musician, was born and raised in Seattle. He was a huge influence on rock music in the 1960s and ‘70s.\n\nLinda Buck, a scientist, was born and educated in Washington. She received the 2004 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.\n\nBill Gates was one of the founders of Microsoft, the largest computer software company in the world. He is from Washington, so he chose to base Microsoft’s headquarters in the state.\n\nBonnie Dunbar was an astronaut from Washington. She was a part of five space shuttle missions, including the first one to dock with the Russian Mir space station."
