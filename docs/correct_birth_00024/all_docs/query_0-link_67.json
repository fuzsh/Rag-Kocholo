        "text": "Jimi Hendrix had a tragically short life, but he changed the music industry with his innovative sounds and style. At the time of his death in London in 1970, he had released three albums, all of which did well on the charts in both the United States and England. He was only 28 years old.\n\nThere has long been speculation about whether his death was an accidental drug overdose, suicide or something more sinister, but the official report lists his death as accidental.\n\nEven now, nearly 40 years after his death, Hendrix still has throngs of loyal fans. Each year, 14,000 of those fans make the journey to a suburb of Seattle, Washington to visit the grave and memorial site for Jimi Hendrix.\n\nHendrix was born in Seattle on November 27, 1942. Very early in his life he showed an interest in music. His father, Al Hendrix, fed that interest by supplying him with whatever musical instruments he could afford. First it was an old ukulele with one string that he found. Next it was a second hand guitar and then, a few years later, an electric guitar .\n\nHendrix was involved with a couple of bands before joining the U. S. Army. During his enlistment, he was a paratrooper, but had to be discharged due to an injury sustained during a jump .\n\nAfter leaving the military, he turned again to music. He performed as Jimmy James before releasing his first solo album using the name Jimi Hendrix. The album, titled \"Are You Experienced'', featured what would become some of his biggest hits. These include the songs \"Purple Haze'' and \"Foxy Lady'' .\n\nAfter his death, his father wanted his son to be buried near his birthplace so he secured what would become a Hendrix family plot in the Greenwood Memorial Park. The grave is located in Renton, Washington about 13 miles from Seattle.\n\nAt first, it was a simple grave marker, but in 2002 a larger memorial was erected. The site includes a large dome that houses a life size image of Hendrix. The memorial includes a total of 54 plots that will be the final resting of other members of the Hendrix family .\n\nThe grave is a place for fans to visit and reflect of the short life and musical accomplishments of Jimi Hendrix."
