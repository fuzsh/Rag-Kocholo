        "text": "I love Ringo's piece on historic hotels. I once stayed at the Laurentian in Montreal - is it still around, is it historic? And then there was the Heups in Bismark.\n\nIt is interesting that two of your entries are in CANADA.\n\nBrent, Seattle, WA\n\nIt's no mystery that you are great at what you do.\n\nSandee, Seattle, WA\n\n* * * *\n\nThe Mystery on the Oasis pics are very funny!\n\nRamon, Kansas City, MO\n\n* * * *\n\nHa ha ha ha ha...love your \"schtick\" Ringo!!\n\nDolly, Las Vegas, NV\n\nHello the travelling Boitano's hope you enjoy. Best wishes.\n\nElsa Magdalena Berno-Boitano, Laussane, Switzerland\n\nMy Irish roots understand terrible beauty. So do my human roots. The concept has such a ring of truth to it, doesn't it? Great article, Ringo. I hope to get to Ireland eventually, and thanks for blazing the trail!\n\nSandeee Bleu, Seattle, WA\n\n* * * *\n\nNo wonder I've been hearing all these wonderful stories about Ireland. I used to think that it was just for Irish Americans seeking their ancestral roots but your article seems to call out to the non-Irish like me. Fascinating and intriguing.\n\nPeter Paul, Pasadena, CA\n\nThanks for this great post wow... it's very wonderful.\n\nKey Logger, New York\n\n* * * *\n\nLets not forget that the Marriot Harbor Beach is within walking distance to the world famous Elbo Room - Fort Lauderdale's oldest bar.\n\nJeff, Fort Lauderdale, FL\n\n* * * *\n\nJeff\n\nThanks for taking the time for the message and reminder. Indeed, I had a quick drink at the Elbo Room. My trip to Ft. Lauderdale would not have been complete without a visit to this historic institution.I have been reading about it for years, and was not disappointed. It felt like a real local's hangout.\n\n- Ringo\n\nRingo,\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed your article about Dick and Liz. I remember seeing that article back in the heyday of Life Magazine.\n\nTo remember the \"behind-the-scenes\" stories like that makes you genuine fan of the 60's. The famous couple's turbulent relationship was just a precursor of today's headline-grabbing media stars like Britney Spears and her colleagues. Life was simpler then. The paparazzis still had some sense of decency. You \"coulda\" been a good paparazzi. I say \"coulda\" because you kept this to yourself all these many years.\n\nLooking forward to other media trivia you can remember.\n\nPeter Paul, South Pasadena, CA\n\nHey, Ringo \n\nEnjoyed your article on Antarctica --- cool photos, too. One thing, you mentioned that Ushuaia in Argentina is considered the most southern city in the world. I read that Chile lays claim to that distinction, with Punta Arenas, the southernmost city in the world.\n\nMick, Greenbay, WI\n\n* * * *\n\nMick \n\nNow that football season is over --- Ive often wondered what you Packer fans did in the off season ---- its great that you took the time to visit TravelingBoy. Great question, unlike my older brother, I adore all lamb products, and Patagonian Lamb --- cooked in a restricted area at the restaurant in an opened wood-fueled fire pit --- is amazing. The chef actually uses an ax to carve it. Frankly, I found it superior to Norwegian fjord lamb, Irish Burren lamb and even those much esteemed creatures down in New Zealand. The crab in Ushuaia is the other thing to eat. Wait a sec, you asked about Punta Arenas vs. Ushuaia as the furthermost city in the world. Well, they both have little disclaimers re populations --- you know, whats a city, which one is a town, ect  so better let Chile and Argentina brass it out. They seem to be able to argue about any subject."
