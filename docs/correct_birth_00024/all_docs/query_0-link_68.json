His father, Al, was a 23 year old private in the U.S. Army, stationed at Fort Rucker, Alabama. His father was denied the standard furlough for visiting his new baby and was remanded to the stockade for 2 months. The birth announcement was received by telegram and it would be three long, arduous years before his father would see him for the first time. [3] The day he was born, his Aunt Delores nicknamed him \"Buster\" (supposedly because he looks like the character Buster Brown) but \"... a part of the reason for the nickname was (also) to avoid Lucille's choice of a legal name, \"Johnny Allen Hendrix,\" which Al later worried Lucille had picked after a boyfriend named John.\"[4]\n\nIn fact, the idea that Al had questions of Lucille's fidelity may have had some truth because he legally changed his son's name to James Marshall Hendrix when he left the Army and returned to Seattle in 1945/6. There is speculation whether it was due to the name \"Johnny\" or if it were to pay homage by giving him a name from his father, \"James\" and his brother Leon \"Marshall\" Hendrix. Either way, most people would know him as Buster or Jimmy. ( \"Jimmy changed the spelling of his name to Jimi in 1966 at the suggestion of Brian \"Chas\" Chandler, the bass player for the Animals, who \"discovered\" him at Cafe Wha? in New York.\") [5]\n\nIn 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, earning the paratrooper division's \"Screaming Eagles\" patch in November of 1962. [6] He was discharged the following year after sustaining an injury during a parachute jump. [7]\n\nChildren\n\nTamika Laurence James (Hendrix) - Born 1966 - Mother: Diana Carpenter\n\nJames Daniel Sundquist - Born 1969 - Mother: Eva Sundquist\n\nOn August 19, 1969 Jimi Hendrix and Gypsy Sun & Rainbows played music at the Woodstock festival. [8] He flashed a \"peace sign\" at the start of his performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".\n\nJimi Hendrix at the Woodstock festival 1969\n\nJimi Hendrix died in London, England in 1970 and is buried in Greenwood Memorial Park in Renton, Washington.[9]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Jimi Hendrix on Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia\n\n↑ [1]\n\n↑ [2]\n\n↑ [Cross, C.
