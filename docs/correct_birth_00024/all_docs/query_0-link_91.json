        "text": "When it comes to the best cities for music lovers, Seattle strikes a chord like few others. It gives travelers a taste of its obsession with music the moment they arrive at Sea-Tac airport, which has live performances from up to four different artists every day.\n\nAs the birthplace of legendary rocker Jimi Hendrix and the entire genre of grunge, Seattle is steeped in musical heritage. But its contemporary live music scene is as vibrant as ever. More than 80 clubs and venues in Seattle regularly host performances from major bands and emerging talent.\n\nMusic in Seattle isn’t just limited to shows, though. It’s an immersive experience that lets travelers wander through iconic recording studios, watch DJs work one of the country’s most famous radio stations, sip music-inspired wine, and sleep in a suite themed around Seattle’s most famous record label: Sub Pop.\n\nGet swept up in the sounds of the city on your next visit. Here are some of Seattle’s top musical experiences for travelers.\n\n1. Take the London Bridge Studio Tour\n\nWander through music history on a tour of London Bridge Studio, where acclaimed albums like Pearl Jam’s “TEN,” Alice in Chains’ “Jar of Flies,” and Soundgarden’s “Louder Than Love,” were recorded. The hourlong immersion will give you a behind-the-scenes look at how the studio helps artists achieve their unique sound.\n\nYou’ll get to step inside the vocal booth where Eddie Vedder sang, see the piano used in Dave Matthews Band’s “When I’m Wear,” and sit inside the control room with the crown jewel of the studio: a 1974 analog Neve console.\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting spot is the wall in the lobby. It's collaged from floor-to-ceiling with rare photos, letters, doodles, and memorabilia from the famous musicians who’ve spent time here over the last four decades.\n\n2. Watch DJs in Action at KEXP\n\nFor travelers who love music, one of the coolest places to visit in Seattle is KEXP. The Seattle Center headquarters of one of the world’s most influential listener-supported music radio stations is home to more than just audio and video broadcast studios—it also offers a gathering space that’s open to the public as part of its mission to bring together a community of music lovers.\n\nInside the hub, you can grab a coffee from Caffe Vita, grow your vinyl collection at Light in the Attic Record Shop, check out art installations, and chill out at one of the cozy couches in the industrial-cool space. While it has a lounge feel, KEXP is indeed a working radio station. A window in the space lets visitors watch DJs work live on air.\n\nKEXP regularly hosts live musical performances in its twinkling indoor performance space (you may have seen it before on KEXP’s “Live on KEXP” on YouTube). The free shows get you up close to an intimate performance from top artists, along with a behind-the-scenes look at the station. Check out KEXP’s event page before your visit to see what’s coming up.\n\n3. Kick Off a Night of Music at Life On Mars\n\nWith out-of-this-world vegan fare, a cocktail menu that goes on for days, and a wall of 6,000 vinyl records to peruse and play, Life On Mars is the go-to spot for kick off a night of music in Seattle.\n\nThe cozy-cool bar has a similar vibe to a record store—a nod to the group of musically-minded owners (including KEXP DJ John Richards of “John in the Morning”) who founded the hangout in Capitol Hill. If you visit during happy hour, you can select a record from the wall and hand it to the bartender to add to the rotation.\n\nOnce you’ve filled up on buffalo cauliflower wings, faux chorizo-topped mac ’n’ cheese, and cocktails garnished to the nines, make your way to Neumos for a live show—it’s just a block away.\n\n4. Rock Out With Girls Who indie\n\nExperience the incredible diversity and raw power of Seattle’s independent female and femme musicians at Girls Who Indie. For the annual event at Neumos, pop-punk musician and host Hannah Duckworth brings together musicians from across the spectrum of genres for a night of girl power.\n\nEach line-up is different, but you can expect a mix of everything from alternative garage rock, grunge punk, gothic heavy metal noise, and folk, along with a Warped Tour-worthy performance from Duckworth and her band. Keep an eye on the Girls Who Indie website for the exact date of the next event, slated to take place this spring.\n\nEven if your trip to Seattle doesn’t align with the next Girls Who Indie showcase, you can still find incredible shows at Neumos and the other 80-plus venues around the city. Some of the other best places for music in Seattle include the Tractor Tavern, The Crocodile, Tim’s Tavern, Nectar Lounge, and the Paramount Theatre.\n\n5. Stay in a Sub Pop-Themed Hotel Suite\n\nSleep like a rockstar in Seattle by booking the Sub Pop Suite at the Kimpton Palladian Hotel. The sprawling 792-square-foot suite is decked out with hand-curated memorabilia and artwork from rotating artists signed by the cult-followed Seattle record label, Sub Pop.\n\nAbove the private bar, you’ll find a floral case with a Crosley record player and a selection of vinyl from Sub Pop artists. Pop on your favorite album, grab a drink, and sprawl out on the swanky black leather sofa to relax after seeing a show.\n\nThe Sub Pop Suite is located directly above the Pennyroyal, the hotel’s lively speakeasy-style bar, should you wish to keep the party going. When you’re ready to wind down, there’s a king-size bed topped with Frette linens—and a one-of-a-kind throw pillow with a portrait of Brad Pitt dressed in 19th-century military garb—waiting for you. Pop in the ear plugs from the Kimpton amenity kit and drift off to a great night of sleep.\n\n6. Sip Music-Themed Wine at Sleight of Hand Cellars\n\nAt the Sleight of Hand Cellars tasting room in Seattle's SODO area, music and wine join forces for a celebration of rock culture. When you make a reservation for a tasting of the winery’s “punk rock wines for punk rock minds,” the team will play your favorite album as you sip in the clubhouse space, which is filled with Pearl Jam and Soundgarden posters and crowned by a disco ball.\n\nWith top-notch acoustics, the venue is often used for album launch parties and concerts on its casual indoor stage. But even on quieter days, Sleight of Hand Cellars still feels like a bustling gathering of music lovers—thanks in no small part to the collection of 2,000 albums and always-on turntables.\n\nSleight of Hand Cellars also has incredible wine-meets-music T-shirts that draw inspiration from famous album covers. They make the perfect Seattle music scene souvenir.\n\n7. Enjoy Piano and Fine Dining at El Gaucho\n\nPerhaps you’re looking for a fancier way to experience music on your visit to Seattle. Head to El Gaucho, one of the city’s best steakhouses.\n\nWithin the main dining area of El Gaucho’s 10,000-square-foot space in Belltown’s historic Union Stables, live musicians tickle the ivories and create the perfect soundtrack for fine dining. On the menu, you’ll find high-quality steaks and chops prepared on a charcoal grill, Caesar salads made tableside, “insane truffle soup” that lives up to its name, and side dishes galore. Don’t miss the kimchi creamed spinach—there’s nothing else like it.\n\n8. Find Nirvana at the Museum of Pop Culture\n\nEvery music lover should make a pilgrimage to the Museum of Pop Culture when traveling in Seattle. It has sprawling music-themed exhibits, including the world’s most extensive display of Nirvana memorabilia, a groovy gallery focused on Jimi Hendrix at the height of his fame, and a collection of nearly 20 guitars from legendary musicians.\n\nFeeling inspired? Head to the museum’s Sound Lab, where you can get hands-on with drums, electric guitars, keyboards, and mixing consoles in soundproof rooms. End your pilgrimage at the Sky Church, a spacious venue with a 60-foot-long HD LED screen playing music videos throughout the day."
