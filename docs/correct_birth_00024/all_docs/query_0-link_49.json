Its nickname, Emerald City, comes from the green forests that surround it. It is also known as the Rainy City, The Gateway to Alaska, Queen City and Jet City, in reference to the economic importance of Boeing in the region. Seattle is where Jimi Hendrix and Bill Gates were born and is known as the birthplace of grunge music and its legendary bands, like Nirvana.
