MoPOP’s long-term exhibit Wild Blue Angel: Hendrix Abroad 1966-1970 deep-dives through the key years of Jimi Hendrix’s musical fame, zipping from Swinging London to the Monterey Pop Festival to Woodstock. Before all that, though, came Seattle (woohoo!)—the city where Hendrix was born, raised, and spent the first half of his life before leaving in 1961.

In the few short years while Jimi was away the Space Needle and Monorail went up, I-5 connected Everett to Tacoma, and the Supersonics played their first game. Seattle, like Jimi’s musical genius, was coming into its own.

Seattle’s own meteoric rise began soon after Hendrix left thanks to the 1962 World’s Fair. During his absence the foundations for nearly every iconic Seattle landmark and institution were laid, and when he returned as an international superstar in 1968 the city we know today had begun to take shape.

We hope you’ll come celebrate Jimi’s 81st birthday with us Nov. 18 and check out Wild Blue Angel while you’re here. Until then, we pulled together this side-by-side timeline of fun facts to show just how much Seattle and Jimi Hendrix came into their own over these seven extraordinary years.
