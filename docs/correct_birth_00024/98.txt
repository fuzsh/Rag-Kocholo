Jimi Hendrix was born in Seattle in 1942 and grew up there in a middle class neighborhood. When he was 5 years old his father gave him a guitar which he turned upside down to play (he was left-handed). As a youth he listened to the music of blues artists Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and B.B. King. In 1961 he enlisted in the Army and served about a year in the 101st Airborne before receiving a medical discharge. After leaving the Army he worked backing up a variety of artists including Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Little Richard, and the Supremes, before moving to New York in 1964. There he lead a blues group called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. This group caught the attention of The Animal's Chas Chandler who urged Hendrix to relocate to London. There, Chandler hooked him up with Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell and got him to use his surname again. In 1966 the Jimi Hendrix Experience recorded two singles, Hey Joe and Stone Free. In 1967, they released their first album called Are You Experienced? and it reached #2 in the UK. The group made its U.S. debut at the Monterrey Pop Festival concluding their performance with Hendrix lighting his guitar on fire. Incredibly, the group was booked to tour with The Monkees but left the tour after eight gigs.

Over the next two years Hendrix toured incessantly. After Redding and Mitchell left his band, Hendrix formed another group, Band of Gypsys. In August of 1969 he performed his now famous version of the Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock.

Increasingly alienated and disillusioned, Hendrix died in London in 1970 having choked on his own vomit after taking barbiturates. During his short but meteoric career, Hendrix redefined the electric guitar---no one since has surpassed his creative genius.
