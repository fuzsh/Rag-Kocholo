Without a Trace star, Poppy Montgomery and her husband Adam Kaufman celebrated the upcoming birth of her first baby in style. Huggies sponsored their baby shower, providing them with a diaper castle and tent filled with diapers.

Friends and family, including her WAT co-stars, feasted on sweets like cupcakes, milkshakes, and chocolate crackles, which satisfied some of Poppy’s cravings. “If I had my way I’d eat M&M’s, ice cream, and caramel for every meal but my doctor won’t allow it!” the 32-year-old tells OK!

The couple is expecting a boy next month.
