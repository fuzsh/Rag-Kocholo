Poppy Montgomery and Microsoft executive Shawn Sanford have been married since February 19.

Montgomery broke the news on Friday when she appeared on Live! with Kelly and Michael.

The wedding ceremony took place at Disneyland. The couple’s children were present and Mickey and Minnie Mouse presided.

“My mother was horrified. She was like, ‘How do you turn Disneyland into Vegas? You don’t run away to Disneyland and get married!'”

Montgomery said the kids were more excited about the setting and special guests than the wedding itself:

” … my children were so in awe of Mickey and Minnie that they didn’t really pay any attention to the wedding. And then my stepdaughter said, ‘Why is Minnie dressed better than you?’ Because I wore jeans and Minnie was in a sort-of bridal gown.”

Montgomery and Sanford are parents to daughter Violet Grace, born in April 2013. Montgomery is also mother to six-year-old Jackson, her son with actor Adam Kaufman.

While with Kaufman, Montgomery downplayed the importance of marriage:

“If Jackson, our son, wanted us to [get married], I would for him because sometimes it’s important to kids, [but] marriage was never a priority for me,” she said in 2011. “I feel like the bigger commitment is actually having a child together, that’s really forever. With marriage, you can get a divorce.”

Montgomery has played Detective Carrie Wells on the CBS crime series Unforgettable since it premiered in 2011. Prior to that the Australian-born actress was known for her starring role on the police procedural series Without a Trace which ran on CBS from 2002 to 2009.

Unforgettable made headlines in 2012 when CBS cancelled the series after its first season, then picked it up for a 13-episode second season a little over a month later. In September 2013 it was renewed for a third season, which will air this summer.
