        "text": "‘Unforgettable’s’ Poppy Montgomery Reveals Her Son’s Almost-Unfortunate Name\n\nPoppy Montgomery comes from a family of colorful names – and her son Jackson almost also ended up with a name that would have been a bit unfortunate.\n\nThe “Unforgettable” star stopped by Access Hollywood Live on Monday, where she revealed that her 3-year-old son with actor Adam Kaufman was not initially named Jackson.\n\n“We were going to call him Jack, but his last name is Kaufman, and if you say Jack Kaufman three times fast…” she told Billy Bush and Kit Hoover, with a laugh.\n\n“A week before I gave birth, his grandpa walks in – my baby daddy’s father walks in – and is like, ‘You can’t call that kid Jack Kaufman,’” she recalled. “So then I didn’t have another name, so I was like, ‘Jackson!’ How did I not get that?”\n\nThe 36-year-old actress, who has sisters Rosie Thorn, Daisy Yellow, Lily Belle and Marigold Sun and brother Jethro Tull, said her parents weren’t as free-spirited as one might think.\n\n“My parents were fairly normal actually. My mom like flowers. They were sorta hippie-ish, but they weren’t free love,” the actress, whose full name is Poppy Petal Emma Elizabeth Deveraux Donahue Montgomery, explained.\n\n“The Montgomery is so no one thought I was Phil Donahue’s daughter,” she said, referring to the iconic talk show host.\n\n“Unforgettable” airs Tuesdays at 10 PM on CBS."
