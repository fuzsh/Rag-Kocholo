They used a couple other babies to play Finn; her son Jackson was too big at the time since her actual pregnancy didn't coincide with the time they were filming Sam's pregnancy (they were off by like 6 months).\n\nIf this ain't love then how do we get out?\n\nreply share\n\nLooks just like her and her husband\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nAlso, Poppy Montgomery and Adam Kaufman are not married. She has indicated in interviews she isn't interested in being married.\n\nreply share"
