        "text": "Without a Trace star Poppy Montgomery welcomed her first child on Dec. 23, a son named Jackson Phillip Kaufman. He is the first child for the Aussie and her longtime boyfriend Adam Kaufman.\n\nPoppy, 35, had intended to keep her son's sex a secret, but slipped up on an Australian talk show in June. When OK! was invited to the couple's exclusive in October, the 35-year-old said the couple had narrowed their list down to 10 names and couldn't wait to see their boy."
