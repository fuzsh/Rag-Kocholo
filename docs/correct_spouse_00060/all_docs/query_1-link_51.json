        "text": "Unforgettable! Poppy Montgomery announced in an interview with David Letterman on the Late Show on July 9 she's pregnant and expecting her third child.\n\n\"I'm expecting!\" the Unforgettable star told Letterman. \"I’m far down the road of expecting … I'm six months pregnant,\" the actress, who is married to Microsoft executive Shawn Sanford, told the talk show host, adding she's \"been hiding it until this very moment.\"\n\nSo why was the redhead, who is already proud mom to Jackson, 6, and Violet, 14 months, hiding the exciting news?\n\n\"I’ve been filming my show, I’ve been doing all my stunts and running and leaping, but I haven’t told anybody because I didn’t want them to treat me differently, but I do. I want people to give me their seats. I want them to open doors,\" Montgomery laughed.\n\nThe mom, who recently celebrated her daughter's first birthday on April 22, realizes she has her hands full.\n\n\"We’re still filming right now, so it’s pretty wild,\" she told Letterman. \"[My costars] all going to be really surprised when they watch this show tonight. They’re going to feel bad for making me hang off that roof like I was about to drop.\""
