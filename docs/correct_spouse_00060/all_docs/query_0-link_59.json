        "text": "Poppy Montgomery explains bigger breasts: I'm pregnant!\n\nPoppy Montgomery is six months pregnant with her third child.\n\nAnd that, she said on The View, is why lately she looks so top-heavy.\n\n\"I haven't told anyone yet, so people just think I have enormous boobs,\" she says, as reported by People. \"I was like 'I wonder if they think I went and got a boob job?' \"\n\nThis will be the Australian-born actress' second child with husband Shawn Stanford, joining daughter Violet Grace, 14 months, and son Jackson, 6½, from her previous relationship with actor Adam Kaufman.\n\nShe hinted about her news in a tweet before appearing on David Letterman's show last night.\n\nAt the View taping today (it will air Friday), Montgomery, 39, explained that she gained more than 80 pounds with her first child, so she's working out and fighting cravings for baked goods.\n\n\"This one I'm working out and really trying hard,\" she said. \"Not too many doughnuts and Ding Dongs and Twinkies – all the things I wish I could eat and that as soon as I'm not an actress I will eat for the rest of my life.\"\n\nMontgomery's baby news follows a buzz frenzy today over news that Ryan Gosling and his girlfriend, Eva Mendes, are expecting their first baby, and Mendes, 40, is seven months pregnant."
