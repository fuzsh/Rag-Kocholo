        "text": "Actors Are Putting Their Foot Down, But Won't Step On The Red Carpet\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild says there appears to be unanimous agreement that nominated actors will not cross striking writers' picket lines to attend the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nAfter canvassing nominees over the past several weeks, Screen Actors Guild President Alan Rosenberg said in a statement, \"there appears to be unanimous agreement that these actors will not cross\" picket lines to present or accept an award.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America had refused to grant a waiver to allow its members to work on the Golden Globes, the People's Choice Awards and the prestigious Academy Awards.\n\nIt's A Boy For Poppy Montgomery And Adam Kaufman\n\n2Poppy Montgomery and her boyfriend, Adam Kaufman, welcomed a son, Jackson Phillip Kaufman, on Dec. 23.\n\nThe baby was born in Los Angeles and weighed 7 pounds, 4 ounces, Montgomery's publicist, Jennifer Shoucair, said Friday. He is the couple's first child.\n\nMontgomery, 32, plays FBI agent Samantha Spade on \"Without a Trace.\" Kaufman, 33, has appeared on several episodes of the CBS drama.\n\nJudge In James Brown Case Is Staying Put\n\n3A judge handling James Brown's contested fortune refused Friday to remove himself from the case despite an argument from the late soul singer's former trustees that he forced them to resign.\n\n\"I would never force anyone to do anything, that's not me,\" Circuit Judge Jack Early said.\n\nBuddy Dallas and Alford Bradley, who both spent years handling Brown's financial affairs, resigned in November. A few weeks later, they claimed the judge had pressured them to resign. On Friday, an attorney for the trustees tried to retract the argument that the judge be removed, but Early wouldn't allow it and then ruled he wouldn't step aside.\n\nAdministrators looking into the handling of Brown's estate told the judge in September that another former trustee, David Cannon, may have misappropriated up to $7 million. And the singer's six adult children have been at odds with the trustees, claiming money has been mismanaged.\n\nDallas and Bradley have denied claims they violated Brown's trust.\n\nAttorneys for Brown's adult children and a woman who claims to be his fourth wife argued the judge should stay.\n\nBrown died in Atlanta on Christmas Day 2006, throwing into turmoil the future of his trust, which is said to contain most of his primary assets, including music rights and his 60-acre Beech Island home in South Carolina. The total value is still unclear.\n\nSince he died, several people, including some claiming to be Brown's unacknowledged children, have come forward wanting a piece of his estate.\n\nTomi Rae Hynie, a former backup singer who claims to be Brown's fourth wife and the mother of his child, has said the singer wanted her to have his home in the western part of South Carolina, near the Georgia state line. She is vying for half of Brown's estate.\n\nExtradition Sought In DiCaprio Attack\n\n4Police will seek the extradition of a woman accused of fleeing to Canada after slashing Leonardo DiCaprio with a broken beer bottle at a party in 2005, authorities said.\n\nAretha Wilson, 37, has been in custody for several months in Toronto in connection with an aggravated assault case there and is a suspect in other assault cases, Los Angeles police Detective Steve Ramirez said Thursday.\n\nPhotos: Top Ten Celebrity Do-Gooders\n\nProsecutors are awaiting a formal communication from police before they launch an inquiry into whether the charge against Wilson is an extraditable offense, district attorney's office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said.\n\nDicaprio suffered \"great bodily injury\" when Wilson allegedly attacked him with a broken beer bottle on June 20, 2005, as he was leaving a party in Hollywood Hills, according to an arrest warrant charging her with one count of assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nWilson failed to turn herself in after the arrest warrant was issued, authorities said.\n\nDiCaprio attorney Blair Berk said the 33-year-old actor has been cooperating with local and Canadian authorities.\n\nRocker Stephen Stills Recovering After Surgery\n\nStephen Stills is recovering after surgery for prostate cancer, his wife said Thursday.\n\nIn a statement, Stills' wife, Kristen Stills, said the \"procedure went remarkably well and he couldn't be better. He will be home by noon tomorrow and the pain will be minimal.\"\n\nThe musician is scheduled to attend the Sundance Film Festival in Utah for the Jan. 25 world premiere of \"CSNY/Deja vu,\" the statement said. The feature movie - directed by Neil Young under his cinematic pseudonym, Bernard Shakey - was filmed during the 2006 Freedom of Speech tour by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\nStills is also scheduled for a North American solo tour this spring in support of his recent \"Just Roll Tape\" album.\n\nJan. 3, 2007\n\nGoldie Hawn: Paparazzi Have Ruined Aspen\n\n5Actress Goldie Hawn says she can't go into Aspen from her nearby ranch anymore because of aggressive paparazzi who pursue her car and stake out her home.\n\nHawn and longtime companion Kurt Russell have been part-time Aspen-area residents for 25 years. She says, in the past, she could wander Aspen freely because the town attracted few celebrity photographers, and they were discreet.\n\nBut Hawn tells The Aspen Times it's not \"like the old days anymore.\" She says she's had to resort to running and dodging and jumping in her car because of the paparazzi -- and feels like she can't go into her own town.\n\nHawn says photographers also stalk her daughter, 27-year-old actress Kate Hudson.\n\nHawn says she spoke with Aspen Mayor Mick Ireland about the problem.\n\nIreland told the Times the paparazzi pursuit was \"abusive\" and \"inconsiderate,\" but that there's little the town can do.\n\nPhotos: Sexy Celebrity Grandparents\n\nHasselbeck To Return To \"The View\" Monday\n\nElisabeth Hasselbeck will return to ABC's \"The View\" on Monday, and she'll bring along her infant son, Taylor Thomas.\n\nHasselbeck, 30, has been on maternity leave from the popular New York-based daytime talk show since Oct. 23.\n\nShe gave birth to Taylor Thomas on Nov. 9 at an Arizona hospital. Her husband, Tim Hasselbeck, is a quarterback for the Arizona Cardinals. The couple have a 2-year-old daughter, Grace.\n\nThe conservative co-host's first day back at \"The View\" will include \"a big ticket item giveaway\" for the studio audience and a full hour of \"Hot Topics,\" show spokesman Karl Nilsson said Thursday.\n\n\"I miss my Republican pal,\" said co-host Joy Behar.\n\nCo-hosts of \"The View\" also include Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg and Sherri Shepherd.\n\nHasselbeck is \"never shy about expressing her view, so `Hot Topics' will be getting a whole lot hotter - especially with the upcoming presidential election,\" ABC said.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity Feuds\n\nShatner A Proven Success As Priceline.com Spokesman\n\nThey don't often compete for parts, but William Shatner beat out Bill Cosby for his longest-running role.\n\nTen years ago, online travel company Priceline.com Inc. narrowed its list of potential spokesmen to Shatner and Cosby. The former Captain Kirk won out because he was more \"futuristic,\" and because \"anyone holding a credit card aged 18 to 95 had heard of William Shatner and knew who he was,\" said Brett Keller, the company's chief marketing officer.\n\nIt has been a happy union.\n\nShatner lent his credibility and camp to the company's early TV spots, in which he performed contemporary hits like \"Bust a Move\" in a classic lounge-lizard style.\n\nThe ads, which became a cultural phenomenon and were sent up on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"propelled Priceline from a second- or third-tier brand to a top-tier brand with extremely high brand awareness,\" Keller said.\n\nShatner, too, saw a bump in his fortunes.\n\nAfter some lean years, he began finding work and was eventually cast as lawyer Denny Crane in ABC's \"The Practice,\" then took the role to the spinoff, \"Boston Legal.\" The part earned him an Emmy.\n\n\"It's possible that when I was being amusing in these commercials, (writer) David Kelly saw them and brought me to mind for a part in \"Boston Legal,\" Shatner said on the set of a new Priceline commercial.\n\nShatner, 76, has played the role of Priceline spokesman for far longer than the four years he spent as Captain Kirk on the original \"Star Trek\" series, though he reprised that role over the next several decades.\n\nIn the new spots, Shatner plays \"The Negotiator,\" a superhero summoned when a customer needs help.\n\nPavarotti Is Irreplaceable\n\nThe Three Tenors will never re-form with a new singer replacing the late Luciano Pavarotti, tenor Jose Carreras says.\n\nThe 61-year-old Spanish singer, who is visiting Australia to give concerts at the Sydney Opera House, said in Thursday's editions of The Australian newspaper that re-forming the immensely popular trio would be disrespectful to Pavarotti, who died of pancreatic cancer in September at age 71.\n\n\"For Placido (Domingo) and myself to do something would betray the memory of Luciano; I don't think that would be ethical,\" Carreras told the newspaper.\n\nCarreras was diagnosed with leukemia in 1987 but overcame the disease to take part in the \"Three Tenors\" concerts from 1990.\n\nCarreras told the newspaper he traveled to Pavarotti's home in Modena, Italy, and called him often as he was dying.\n\n\"It was important to show him that someone who suffered from such a severe disease was able to overcome the situation and win the battle. This is the kind of comfort I could give him,\" Carreras said.\n\nMississippi Honors Country Legend Charley Pride\n\nThe Mississippi Arts Commission is giving its lifetime achievement award to country music legend Charley Pride next month.\n\nPride will receive the award at the 2008 Governor's Awards for Excellence in the Arts on February 8th.\n\nPride, born in Sledge, Mississippi, has sold more than 70 million records in his career.\n\nHe is best known for his million-selling crossover single \"Kiss an Angel Good Morning\" recorded in 1971. The song earned Pride the Country Music Association's Top Male Vocalist and the prestigious Entertainer of the Year awards in 1972.\n\nThe only artist to sell more albums at RCA Records is fellow Mississippian Elvis Presley.\n\nPride played baseball for the American Negro League and joins the Texas Rangers for workouts during spring training.\n\nOther 2008 recipients are Natasha Trethewey, of Gulfport, for Literary Excellence; Lallah Miles Perry, of Jackson, for Artistic Excellence; Mississippi Museum of Art in Jackson for Leadership in the Arts; Emma McCain, of Meridian, for Arts Patron.\n\nTila Tequila Will Get A Second \"Shot at Love\"\n\n\"A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila\" is apparently over for Bobby Banhart.\n\nThe 25-year-old male film student selected last month by Tequila on her popular MTV reality dating show is no longer or maybe never was dating the 26-year-old bisexual Internet celebrity.\n\nDuring MTV's live New Year's Eve programming, Tequila said that Banhart had broken up with her because of her hectic work schedule. \"He couldn't handle it,\" she said. \"He broke up with me.\"\n\nHowever, Banhart said in a Dec. 30 message posted on MySpace that \"she never called me after the last show and no one would give me her number.\"\n\nThe network announced Wednesday that a second season of \"A Shot at Love\" will air this spring and will once again feature Tequila looking for love, reality TV style, among a group of men and women.\n\n\"This time I wanna find love for real,\" Tequila said during \"Tila Tequila's New Year's Eve Masquerade 2008.\""
