        "text": "VALERIE MACON / AFP / Getty Images\n\nActress Poppy Montgomery has announced her marriage after exchanging vows. The marriage ceremony was top secret and was held at Disneyland earlier in 2014.\n\nShawn Sanford, her boyfriend, and the ‘Unforgettable’ star eloped to the California Theme park. They brought their children at the end of January and there they tied the knot with Mickey and Minnie Mouse presiding over the nuptials.\n\nShe first revealed the news on U.S. TV show live! With Kelly & Michael, on Friday April 4th, saying, “On Chinese New Year, I ran away with all of the children and I got married at Disneyland. My mother was horrified. She was like, ‘How do you turn Disneyland into Vegas?’”\n\n“Mickey and Minnie came dressed as a bride and groom.”\n\nMontgomery wore jeans.“The children were so in awe of Mickey and Minnie that they didn’t really pay attention to the wedding, and then my stepdaughter said, ‘Why is Minnie dressed better than you? ‘” the actress recalled, laughing at the funny memory.\n\n“My mother was horrified,” she remembers. “She was like, ‘How do you turn Disneyland into Vegas? You don’t run away to Disneyland and get married!’”\n\nThe two began dating back in 2011 and have welcomed their first child in 2013, Violet Grace.\n\nThis is actress’ first marriage and she is also a mother to six-year old son Jackson Phillip Deveraux Montgomery Kaufman from a previous romance with actor Adam Kaufman."
