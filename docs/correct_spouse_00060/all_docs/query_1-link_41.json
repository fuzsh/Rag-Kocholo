        "text": "Hollywood is expecting another celebrity baby this fall. The cute tyke will belong to Poppy Montgomery and her husband, Shawn Sanford.\n\nPeople magazine reported that the Unforgettable actress is six months along in her pregnancy and she’s ready to share the news with the world.\n\nUnforgettable: Poppy Montgomery >>\n\nOn an episode of The View to air on Friday she said, “I’m so happy. I’m hoping to get all of the privileges now of a real pregnant person. I want to be respected and given lots of royal treatment.”\n\nThe other reason to break the happy news was to explain why her body was changing so rapidly.\n\n“I haven’t told anyone yet, so people just think I have enormous boobs,” she joked. “I was like ‘I wonder if they think I went and got a boob job?'”\n\nThis is the couple’s second child together. Montgomery and Sanford already have a daughter, Violet Grace, and the actress has a son, Jackson, 6, from her previous relationship with Adam Kaufman. The CBS star’s husband is a Microsoft executive who has two kids from his first marriage — daughter Haley, 11, and son Braydon, 8.\n\nThe kids don’t seem very excited by the new fall arrival.\n\nMontgomery explained, “With Violet, they were all really, really excited and then they realized that babies don’t do all that much.”\n\nGuy Ritchie welcomes third baby with fiancée >>\n\nThe 39-year-old actress is just getting out of the morning sickness stage and enjoying her favorite meal, Chinese duck noodles. Otherwise, she’s doing her best to stay in shape during the pregnancy.\n\nShe shared, “With Jackson, I gained 83 pounds. This one, I’m working out and really trying hard. Not too many doughnuts and Ding Dongs and Twinkies — all the things I wish I could eat and that as soon as I’m not an actress I will eat for the rest of my life.”\n\nCongratulations, Poppy and Shawn!"
