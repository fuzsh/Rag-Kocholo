        "text": "Adam Kaufman is an American actor who works predominantly in television. He is best known for his role as the grown Charlie Keys on the science-fiction alien abduction miniseries \"Taken.\" Kaufman first studied drama at Lynchburg College, before moving to New York to become a professional actor. While seeking auditions, he trained at New York City's Circle in the Square Theatre School, and at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Theater Institute in Waterford, Connecticut. He landed his first major television role in 1999 on the popular supernatural drama \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\" \"Buffy\" was in its fourth season and Buffy had entered college. Kaufman landed the role of Buffy's first college crush, Parker Abrams, who notoriously beds Buffy and takes off, leaving her emotionally shattered. Kaufman went on to break hearts in a number of teen dramas including: \"Dawson's Creek,\" \"Veronica Mars,\" and the 2009 \"Melrose Place\" re-launch. He's developed a noteworthy career appearing in a number of acclaimed crime dramas like \"Law & Order,\" \"Monk,\" and \"Without a Trace.\" Notably, his role on \"Without a Trace\" began with his character, Brian Donovan, and Poppy Montgomery's character having a one night stand that leaves her pregnant. Kaufman and Montgomery 's real-life romance led to the birth of their first child in 2007. In 2010, Kaufman landed a recurring role on the military procedural \" NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service.\""
