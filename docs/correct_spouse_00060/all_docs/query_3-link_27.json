        "text": "Ah i love her. Congrats to them :D\n\nDamn Parker!\n\nhaha, that's exactly what I thought. I remember seeing that episode the first time and my dad walked in and was like, \"Somebody told that actor he has pretty eyes and now he won't let anyone forget it\" because Parker kept batting his eyes and gazing all wide-eyed at anyone.\n\nThe baby should be good looking.\n\nthey sound genially happy. good for them.\n\nthe kid has clearly hit some sort of a genetic jackpot\n\nher boyfriend is ridiculously hot\n\nALL THE GIRLS IN THE CLUB WANNA GET KNOCKED UP!\n\nGET KNOCKED UP!\n\nGET KNOCKED UP!\n\nYay! Love Poppy! :)\n\nI wonder what will happen to her character?\n\nyay poppy love!\n\nhated her blonde.\n\nThe guy is hot. Don't really like Poppy, first of all wtf kind of name is that? Opium anyone?, but really it's b/c her character had an affair with Jack on Without a Trace. She had Eric Close and that hot guy who is a guest on every TV show after her. I don't even watch Without a Trace regularily...why did I have to see that ONE episode?\n\nwhy is everyone pregnant it seems?\n\ni read that as poopy montgomery :/\n\nAww she's so sweet.\n\nThat child's definately hit the genetic jackpot.\n\nOooooh, I wonder if they're gonna write it into the show. And if so, please don't let it be Jack's.\n\nAnyway, congrats to them. That kid is gonna be ridiculously good looking.\n\nnote to self\n\nnever name kid POPPY\n\nIt weirds me out because when I hear \"Poppy,\" I can't help but hear \"Papi.\" And I would never name my daughter Papi. For obvious reasons.\n\nIt's so crazy. I'm like: Oh my god! I can't believe it\n\nWell when a man and a woman.....................\n\nbastard child\n\nI'm not surprised. She's looked pregnant the last few episodes of Without a Trace. I was just waiting for an official announcement. She's got to be at least 6 months along now.\n\nhe looks like he's been carved out of wax.\n\nthat kid is gonna have some bigass bushy eyebrows.\n\nHate the word \"preggers.\"\n\nOMG he looks SO hot now! He played some Belgian kid who got molested on Law and Order SVU and was so young looking and now he's all sorts of man.\n\nl: seems someone waxed his brows for him\n\no: haha yeah\n\nl: 'cause dem tings was caterpilllaaars\n\no: i could live in those eyebrows"
