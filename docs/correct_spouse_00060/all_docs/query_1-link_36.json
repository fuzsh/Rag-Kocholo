        "text": "Well, why not get married at the happiest place on Earth? Actress Poppy Montgomery secretly wed boyfriend Shawn Sanford at Disneyland months ago, she revealed on Live! With Kelly and Michael on Friday, April 4 â€” and none other than Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse presided!\n\n\"On Chinese New Year, I ran away with all of the children and got married at Disneyland,\" the Unforgettable actress, 38, began. (Montgomery and Sanford are parents to daughter Violet, 12 months; she's also mom to Jackson, 6, with ex-boyfriend Adam Kaufman, and Sanford has a young daughter from a previous relationship.)\n\nAnd while Mickey and Minnie wore formal wedding attire for the vows, Montgomery herself went uber-casual in jeans. \"The children were so in awe of Mickey and Minnie that they didn't really pay attention to the wedding, and then my stepdaughter said, 'Why is Minnie dressed better than you?'\" the Without a Trace alum continued.\n\nMontgomery and Microsoft executive Sanford have been dating since late 2011."
