        "text": "Australian actress Poppy Montgomery may be best known as agent Samantha Spade in the TNT drama Without a Trace, but she's also become something of a serial renovator. Her first home was a charming two-bedroom bungalow in the trendy Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles which, by her own admission, was a little too \"girly\" for boyfriend Adam Kaufman. \"It even had a pink bathroom complete with a chandelier!\" she says. \"You could imagine that Jean Harlow had lived there.\"\n\nSo three years ago, she bought this five-bedroom Spanish Colonial perched in the hills of Pacific Palisades. The 1920s house had been completely renovated, but Poppy turned to her friend, Heather Tom, an actress with an expanding design portfolio, to help her make it feel like home. \"A lot had been done to the house, but in the process it had lost some of its soul,\" says Tom.\n\n\"My favorite resort is Esperanza in Cabo San Lucas, and I wanted this house to have that kind of feel—luxurious and comfortable, like a great hotel, but really homey at the same time,\" says Poppy. To that end, Tom and her boyfriend, James Achor, lightened up the dark, brown house by painting all the rooms variations on warm, creamy white, which helps create an easy flow from room to room. All the furniture in the living room is upholstered in a soft ivory brushed cotton, so the color comes from the pillows, curtains and Oushak rug. An intriguing mix of antiques, like the intricately carved Moroccan bench and Art Deco tables in the living room, a carved English Victorian table in the dining room and period-appropriate Spanish Revival lighting, give the house \"that element of old-world glamour,\" says Tom, \"but you still feel like you can throw pillows on the floor, sit around the big cocktail table and have drinks or play games.\"\n\nIn the master bedroom, accents tend toward Asian, with a Chinese screen hung above the bed. \"We kept the bedroom fairly simple because I wanted that resortlike mood without a lot of clutter,\" says Poppy. \"It opens onto a big balcony with gorgeous mountain views, so we outfitted it with comfy chairs and white cabana curtains.\" The master bath is spalike with exotic Moorish tiles, an embroidered silk pouf and a two-person steam shower.\n\nBut perhaps the most compelling part of this vacation reverie is the backyard, with its lagoon/wading pool and waterfall Jacuzzi, shaded dining terrace, outdoor bar and lush tropical foliage. This is where Poppy and Adam throw parties or relax in total serenity.\n\nWhat's next? Well, the recent arrival of their baby son, Jackson, has Poppy and Adam converting guest rooms to a nursery and playroom, but Poppy—serial renovator that she is—confesses, \"Once a house is done, I want to try something new. Next, I want to do a beachy Nantucket or Cape Cod-style home. I don't know that I would sell this house, but I'd love to get my hands into doing another!\""
