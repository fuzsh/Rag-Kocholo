        "text": "Brian Damage\n\nActress Poppy Montgomery's real-life pregnancy will be written into this next season of Without a Trace. Montgomery, 35, is expecting a son in December with her boyfriend Adam Kaufman. Montgomery told TV Guide that her character, FBI agent Sam Spade, will be pregnant on the show. Her character will be put in several life-and-death situations, which will be so much more dire than usual because she's carrying a child.\n\nThe biggest mystery, however, is who is Sam's baby daddy? I'm a little behind on my Without a Trace, but I know she has had affairs with both her boss and her co-worker, but I thought those were both over. Montgomery is having a hard time keeping that a secret. She says, \"I have to bite my tongue because I'm busting to tell everybody. There are a number of people in the mix. I think it will be quite surprising.\""
