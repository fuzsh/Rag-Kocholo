        "text": "Meet Poppy Montgomery's three kids who all have unique names and find out the reason why the actress and her husband chose the names for the kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDifferent families have different traditions that are passed down from one generation to another. Some of these traditions might seem weird, but to each family, it has a purpose.\n\nWhen giving names to children, various factors might influence the choice of name to be given. Interestingly, some families love giving their kids long names, and Poppy Montgomery is continuing her family's naming tradition with her kids.\n\nPoppy Montgomery attends Walt Disney Television Emmy Party on September 22, 2019 | Photo: Getty Images\n\nPoppy, who comes from a family where they are all named after flowers and have more than two names, decided to follow this trend when naming her children.\n\nWith her full name being Poppy Petal Emma Elizabeth Deveraux Donahue and her siblings: Rosie Thorn, Daisy Yellow, Lily Belle, Marigold Sun, and Jethro Tull, it is no wonder her kids have exciting names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA proud mother of three biological and two step-children, here is a brief detail of Poppy Montogomery's children's name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPOPPY MONTGOMERY'S KIDS\n\nPoppy has three children, one with ex-partner and boyfriend Adam Kaufman and two with her husband, a Microsoft lifestyle executive Shawn Sanford.\n\nHer first son named Jackson Phillip Deveraux Montgomery Kaufman was born on December 23, 2007, to her then partner Adam Kaufman.\n\nAt the time she was pregnant with Jackson, Poppy and Adam were both working on the set of the show, \"Without a Trace,\" and the pregnancy had to be written into the storyline of the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoppy once revealed that Jackson's name was supposed to be Jack, but when his paternal grandfather walked into the hospital room, he advised that they not name him that because saying the name Jack Kaufman repeatedly was not something a kid would want.\n\nHer second child and first daughter Violet Grace Deveraux Sanford, was born on April 22, 2013. As it is with the custom of her family, she decided to name her daughter after a flower to keep the tradition going.\n\nOn November 11, 2014, Poppy gave birth to her second son and third child, Gus Monroe Deveraux Sanford. Gus is the last child of Poppy and her husband, Shawn Sanford.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked the reason for giving her children so many names, the Australian born actress stated that she wanted her kids to have a variety of names to choose from when they grow up in case they do not like what they were being called.\n\nAsides from being a mother to three awesome kids, Poppy is also a stepmother to Shawn's children from a previous marriage.\n\nSpeaking on how her blended family operates, she expressed that the main thing every adult in the family tries to do is be an example to the kids; hence there is peace among all those involved.\n\nPERSONAL LIFE\n\nPoppy's personality can be defined as peppy, fun-loving, and down to earth. Whenever she goes for an interview, she ensures that she leaves the hosts laughing and high spirited.\n\nThis personality has not always worked to her advantage. In fact, Poppy had to be expelled from about six different schools because she was a renowned rebel who never conformed to school standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoppy Montgomery attends 2019 Entertainment Weekly Pre-Emmy Party at Sunset Tower on September 20, 2019 | Photo: Getty Images\n\nHaving gone through various high schools, she decided to drop out and pursue her passion, which included acting and seeing the world. At the age of 16, she left home to travel abroad, and by the time she was 18, she relocated to America.\n\nHer love for spontaneity and fun was the contributing factor to her getting married in Disneyland in the presence of Mickey and Minnie Mouse while their children served as witnesses.\n\nOn how she handles motherhood, Poppy expressed that she ensures she is fun, trusting, and free with her kids. She also stated that she encourages them to be true to themselves and kind to those around them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCAREER\n\nComing to America with little to no money and a book titled \"How to make it in Hollywood,\" Poppy started auditioning for roles while keeping up with the life of her favorite celebrity Marilyn Monroe.\n\nAs a newbie in the industry then, Poppy tried to get roles but was turned down because of her lack of industry experience. However, things soon turned around for her when she got to play Marilyn Monroe in a miniseries called \"Blond.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a stellar performance in the series, Poppy began to get roles and make a name for herself in Hollywood. Following her performance on \"Blond,\" she was offered the role of Samantha Spade in \"Without a Trace,\" and this cemented her skills as an actor.\n\n\"Without a Trace,\" which focused on the missing person unit in the FBI, ran for almost seven episodes before it ended in 2009.\n\nSince then, Poppy, who once expressed that she would have been a criminal if not for her acting career, has gone on play characters on various other series and most recently tried her hands on producing \"Reef Breaks.\""
