        "text": "Poppy Montgomery (born Poppy Petal Emma Elizabeth Deveraux Donahue; June 15,1972) is an Australian actress. She played FBI agent Samantha Spade on the CBS mystery drama Without a Trace from 2002 to 2009 and played Detective Carrie Wells on the CBS/A&E police drama Unforgettable from 2011 to 2016.\n\nEarly life\n\nMontgomery was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, to mother Nicola (née Montgomery), an executive and market researcher, and father Phil Donahue, a restaurateur. She is one of six children. Her parents named all their daughters after flowers – Poppy, Rosie, Daisy, Lily and Marigold – and their son, Jethro Tull, after the rock band Jethro Tull.\n\nMontgomery disliked school, being expelled from six private academies before finally dropping out at the age of 15 to pursue stage acting and to travel around Bali with her then-boyfriend. Montgomery emigrated to the United States at the age of 18, arriving in Florida to meet a boyfriend whom she had met when he was an exchange student. After five days, she realized that \"[she] couldn't stand him\" and took a bus to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.\n\nCareer\n\nWhen Montgomery moved to Los Angeles, she stayed with two of her brother's friends while sending a head shot every day to Julia Roberts's former manager, Bob McGowan, until he signed her. She appeared in several small television roles during the late 1990s, including on NYPD Blue.\n\nMontgomery's big break was winning the role of Marilyn Monroe in the 2001 CBS miniseries Blonde, based on a Joyce Carol Oates novel. The next role she was offered was a starring role as Samantha Spade on the CBS mystery drama Without a Trace. The series revolved around a missing-persons unit of the FBI in New York City. On being offered the part, she later said, \"They (the producers) called me up and said, 'Will you do it?' I said, 'Um' and they said, 'Anthony LaPaglia is in it' and I said, 'sure'. It was that simple.\" Montgomery portrayed Samantha Spade for seven seasons, from when the show began on 26 September 2002 until it ended on 19 May 2009.\n\nIn April 2011, Montgomery completed filming a television biographical film Magic Beyond Words, appearing as Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling.\n\nThe same year, she began starring in the CBS police drama Unforgettable as Carrie Wells. The first season, with 22 episodes, ran from September 2011 until May 2012, and CBS initially cancelled the show on 12 May 2012. Unforgettable was later renewed for a second season, with 13 episodes running from July 2013 to May 2014, and a third season, with 13 episodes running from June 2014 to September 2014. In October 2014, after the third season's conclusion, CBS cancelled the series again. In February 2015, A&E picked up the series for a fourth season of 13 episodes. The season ran on A&E from November 2015 to January 2016, and the series was cancelled in February 2016.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMontgomery met actor Adam Kaufman in 2005 in Mexico while working on the independent film Between, and in 2010, they worked together again in the TV film Lying to be Perfect. In 2007, Kaufman began a recurring role on Without a Trace in the season-five episode \"At Rest\" as Brian Donovan, Samantha's love interest for the rest of the series. In June 2007, Montgomery announced her pregnancy with Kaufman, which was written into season six. On 23 December 2007, she gave birth to their son Jackson Phillip. Montgomery's Without a Trace co-star Anthony LaPaglia became Jackson's godfather. On 10 October 2011 in Life & Style, Montgomery and Kaufman were reported to have separated.\n\nIn late 2011, Montgomery began dating Shawn Sanford, director of lifestyle marketing for Microsoft, whom she met in Puerto Rico. In April 2013, she gave birth to their daughter, Violet Grace. In November 2014, she gave birth to their son Gus Monroe. On the 4 April 2014 episode of Live! with Kelly and Michael, Montgomery revealed that on Chinese New Year, she and Sanford were married at Disneyland in a ceremony with their children present.\n\nMontgomery holds both Australian and American citizenship. She moved from Los Angeles to New York City in 2013 to continue filming Unforgettable.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1994 Tammy and the T-Rex Party Girl No. 1 1995 Devil in a Blue Dress Barbara's Sister 1996 The Cold Equations Marilyn 'Lee' Cross 1998 Dead Man on Campus Rachel 1999 Other Sister, The Caroline Tate 1999 Life Older Mae Rose Abernathy 2000 Men Named Milo, Women Named Greta Barri Noodleman Short film 2004 How to Lose Your Lover Allison 2005 Between Nadine Roberts 2021 Christmas on the Farm Clementine ‘Emmy’ Jones telemovie\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1994 Silk Stalkings Angel 2-part episode: \"Natural Selection\" 1995 Jake Lassiter: Justice on the Bayou Cindy Movie 1996 Cold Equations, The Marilyn 'Lee' Cross Movie 1996 Party of Five Allison Episode: \"Poor Substitutes\" 1996 NYPD Blue Lisa Episode: \"Burnin' Love\" 1996 Relativity Jennifer Lukens 7 episodes 1997 Desert's Edge Mary TV short 1999 Wonder Cabinet, The Dr. Sarah Coleman Pilot 2000 Beat, The Elizabeth Waclawek 3 episodes 2001 Blonde Norma Jean Baker / Marilyn Monroe Miniseries 2001 Going to California Penelope Episode: \"Hurricane Al: A Tale of Key Largo\" 2002 Glory Days Ellie Sparks 9 episodes 2002–2009 Without a Trace Samantha Spade Lead role (160 episodes) 2004 Raising Waylon Julia Bellows Special 2005 Murder in the Hamptons Generosa Rand Movie 2005 Snow Wonder Paula Movie 2010 True Blue Katherine Miller Pilot 2010 Lying to Be Perfect Nola Devlin/Belinda Apple Movie 2011 Magic Beyond Words J.
