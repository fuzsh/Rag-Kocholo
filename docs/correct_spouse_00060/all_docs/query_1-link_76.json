Huggies sponsored their baby shower, providing them with a diaper castle and tent filled with diapers.\n\nFriends and family, including her WAT co-stars, feasted on sweets like cupcakes, milkshakes, and chocolate crackles, which satisfied some of Poppy’s cravings. “If I had my way I’d eat M&M’s, ice cream, and caramel for every meal but my doctor won’t allow it!” the 32-year-old tells OK!\n\nThe couple is expecting a boy next month."
