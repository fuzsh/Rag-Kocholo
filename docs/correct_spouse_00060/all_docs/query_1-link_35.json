        "text": "She grew up in a gospel group from the age of 6 to 17 with relatives & eventually became an actress.\n\nHer boyfriend is actor Johnny Messner ( of Guiding Light, Jane The Virgin, G.I. Joe Renegades & The O.C. fame) & had twin sons at age 44. Johnny has several Cold Case episodes on his resume.\n\nAccording to blind items, she was icy & difficult on the Cold Case set & had problems with the other cast members.\n\nThis working persona along with her twins may have contributed to her work load decline in recent years.\n\nAngelina Jolie was jealous of her and had her fired from the set of Money Ball (I think that's the name of it). A little while later she got pregnant and had twins. She stayed home for a while and she's been on a CBS show called Reverie. It's a Sci-Fi, Drama show. And the father of her children is very hot. Here's his IMDB page. He does a lot of direct to DVD movies, but he works a lot\n\nI don’t believe 99% of the “such and such was a bitch on set”. People have good days and bad days and that’s pretty much true for most people.\n\nThat being said her career is a mystery. She could have been much bigger. I never understood her cosmetic enhancements that became more noticeable through the years. She had a perfect face. It was totally unnecessary.\n\nShe always had that same do. I can think of only one episode where she let her hair down.\n\nI don’t think you can watch the show anywhere. No DVD, no netflix. Zip.\n\nI don’t even think it’s on All Access.\n\nShe could have booked another pilot right after at least, but there was nothing for several years. I'm guessing she didn't want to sign onto another show right after Cold Case, especially if she was considering children. In 2013 she did a pilot that was not picked up, and then had her kids. She was back on tv as a regular this season, but I believe it was cancelled.\n\nNot to hijack but I think of them from the same era - WHET Poppy Montgomery from Without A Trace? I guess most of that cast is off the radar now but is she still working at all? She gave me the impression of being batshit crazy in real life but I liked her. And I wanted to be spit-roasted by Enrique Murciano and Eric Close.\n\nI would like to see her again, too. That was an excellent cast. I wouldn't mind if they started Cold Case again. Not a reboot, per se. Just restart it, as if no time has gone by, with a new case."
