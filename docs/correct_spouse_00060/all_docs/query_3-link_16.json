        "text": "It’s another day of blistering heat in New York City — temperatures are expected to hit the upper 90s — and the stars of CBS’s “Unforgettable” are on 73rd Street and Broadway, filming on the sidewalk in front of a bank. For its second season, the series has traded its backdrop of one-family homes and apartment houses in Queens neighborhoods for easily\n\nidentifiable Manhattan locations. Across Broadway we have the magnificent façade of the Ansonia; across 73rd Street, we have the marquee of the Beacon Theater, where that night’s Alice Cooper concert is sold out.\n\nOut here on Broadway, it sounds like a cop show. Sirens blare, drowning out conversation. The locals are not very cooperative. The elderly denizens totter into the scene with canes and walkers, ignoring the lights, the directors’ chairs, the video village setup, and the middle-aged defiantly stride through the set, dye jobs damp with the humidity, responding to requests from stage managers to cross the street with a curt, “A- – hole, get out of my neighborhood.”\n\nMontgomery, seated in a black director’s chair, her red romance-novel hair flowing past her shoulders, rises above the commotion — and the heat. After all, she wasn’t supposed to be here.\n\nShe wasn’t supposed to do another season of the show, about a former detective, Carrie Wells, whose total recall of crime scenes made her an invaluable NYPD resource. Despite an audience of approximately 12 million viewers, the show was unexpectedly canceled in the spring of 2012. And then, a month later, it was announced that “Unforgettable” would return in the summer of 2013.\n\nMontgomery had already vacated her SoHo apartment and moved back to LA. Offers for other projects started rolling in, but Montgomery, 38, discovered she was pregnant with her second child. She wasn’t exactly ready to squeak into another pair of skinny jeans and look at corpses and banter with Dylan Walsh, who plays Carrie’s ex, Det. Al Burns. So everybody waited until the baby, Violet Grace Deveraux Sanford, was born. She’s now 9 weeks old, and Montgomery, who gained 40 pounds during her pregnancy, is still not wearing skinny jeans.\n\n“I probably have 15 [pounds] more to lose,” says Montgomery, who wears a loose-fitting, thigh-length, sleeveless black dress. “Now I like to call myself voluptuous. My boobs are ginormous. Running down the street, I thought I was going to knock myself out.”\n\nA veteran of CBS’s “Without a Trace,” which ran for seven seasons, Montgomery diplomatically says she harbors no ill will toward the network regarding the about-face on “Unforgettable.”\n\n“I defer to the networks and the studios when it comes to what shows stay and what shows go,” she says. “I honestly think there’s so much talent coming into television from features and all around. I don’t question it because I don’t understand the business of it. You learn to roll with it. I was thrilled when they brought it [back]. I loved the character.”\n\nShe is living downtown in the Meatpacking District with her 5-year-old son, Jackson. Montgomery broke up with his father, actor Adam Kaufman, during the first season of “Unforgettable.” She has a new boyfriend, Shawn Sanford, Microsoft director of lifestyle marketing, and Violet’s father. She attributes the breakup to the price of maintaining a long-distance relationship.\n\n“I moved here for a solid year and my schedule was brutal, and [the relationship] just took that turn. It just drifted,” Montgomery says. “We’re really good friends and we’re co-parenting. So Jackson goes back and forth.”\n\nMontgomery’s co-star, Walsh, also moved back to New York for the show, but he chose Brooklyn, where his two teenage children visit him this summer. While Montgomery misses shooting in the neighborhoods of Queens, Walsh, 49, thinks show’s shift to Manhattan has given the show some juice.\n\n“We’ve been given a chance to tweak the show and make it more accessible. Setting it in Manhattan and making us part of a task force put adrenaline into it,” he says. “So we’re not just showing up with a dead body. By picking up the pace, our characters couldn’t have all these big, dramatic personal conversations. Sometimes they brought the show down a little bit. Now it’s more the banter of ‘Moonlighting.’ And it’s a faster-paced procedural. And I think it’s a better show.”\n\n“Unforgettable” is shooting through October, and there are rumors that CBS will hold eight episodes in reserve in case a show on its fall schedule bombs.\n\n“There are a lot of scenarios around these eight episodes that insiders talk about. I don’t think anybody knows,” Walsh says. “No matter what, we’re here till October, and some of that is driven by the fact that we do so well around the world. That was a lot of the reason they brought the show back. Let’s see what happens. ”\n\nWhile Walsh is sitting in his sidewalk director’s chair, a young African-American man comes up and taps him on the shoulder. “I really liked you in ‘Nip/Tuck,’ ” he says before moving on. That’s the kind of recognition an actor’s not going to get shooting on the empty streets of LA — and only one of the reasons Walsh is stoked to work in New York.\n\n“I love living in New York. I started here. For me, my pride is here,” he says. “LA has always been a place where you try to get up the ladder. I took classes here. I waited tables here.”\n\nWalsh took the “Unforgettable” because the role was such a contrast to the plastic surgeon he played on “Nip/Tuck.”\n\n“Most actors will tell you that they’re looking for the cable show and I had already done that,” he says. “I was looking for something, not necessarily a procedural, but something where’s there’s a cop, a man’s man, a different way of talking.”\n\nAnd on “Unforgettable,” he gets to keep his clothes on. Walsh says the “Nip/Tuck” producers would schedule long lunches so the cast could “go to the gym, shower and come back and get our makeup on. The reason they did that was because we had to stay in shape [for the nude scenes]. Here, I eat.”\n\nUNFORGETTABLE\n\nTonight, 9 p.m., CBS"
