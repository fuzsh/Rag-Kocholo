        "text": "American actor (born 1974)\n\nAdam Kaufman (born May 11, 1974) is an American actor, known for his role in 2002 in the Steven Spielberg science fiction mini-series Taken as Charlie Keys, Ethan Brody in the third season of Dawson's Creek, and as Parker Abrams in the fourth season of The WB supernatural/horror drama Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nKaufman's father is Jewish, and his mother is Catholic.[1] He studied drama at Lynchburg College, the Circle in the Square Theatre School, and at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Theater Institute.\n\nKaufman met Australian-American actress Poppy Montgomery in 2005 in Mexico while working on the independent psychological thriller film Between. In 2010, they worked together again in the TV movie Lying to Be Perfect. At the time, Montgomery starred as FBI agent Samantha Spade in the CBS mystery drama Without a Trace. From 2007 to 2009, Kaufman had a recurring role in the fifth, sixth and seventh seasons as Brian Donovan, Samantha's love interest. In June 2007, Montgomery announced her pregnancy with Kaufman, which was written into the sixth season. On December 23, 2007, Montgomery gave birth to their son Jackson Phillip Deveraux Montgomery Kaufman in Los Angeles.[2] It was reported on October 10, 2011 in Life & Style that Kaufman and Montgomery broke up due to the distance between them when working.\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\nFilm[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2005 Between James Roberts 2005 Come Away with Me Michael 2006 Altered Wyatt 2011 Final Sale Ben Martin\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1997 Law & Order Douglas Burke Episode: \"Past Imperfect\" 1999 Chicken Soup for the Soul Matt Episode: \"Starlight, Star Bright\" 1999 Brookfield Jamie Harper Unsold TV pilot 1999 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Parker Abrams Recurring role, 5 episodes 1999–2000 Dawson's Creek Ethan Recurring role, 5 episodes 2000 Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Michael Goren Episode: \"Wrong Is Right\" 2000 Gideon TV movie 2000 Metropolis Mathew TV movie 2001 Dead Last Dom Episode: \"To Serve, with Love\" 2002 Taken Charlie Keys TV miniseries, 5 episodes 2003 CSI: Miami Ted Episode: \"Spring Break\" 2004 Veronica Mars André Episode: \"The Girl Next Door\" 2004 Beck and Call Gray TV short 2005 E-Ring Jared Vogel Episode: \"Delta Does Detroit\" 2006 Law & Order Attorney Swain Episode: \"Release\" 2006 Hello Sister, Goodbye Life Joe TV movie 2007 Mad Men Bob Shaw Episode: \"Indian Summer\" 2007 CSI: NY Elliot Gano Episode: \"You Only Die Once\" 2007–2009 Without a Trace Brian Donovan Recurring role, 13 episodes 2008 Monk Brother Ted Episode:\"Mr. Monk Joins a Cult\" 2009 Loving Leah Jake Lever TV movie 2009 Cupid Tommy Brown Episode: \"The Tommy Brown Affair\" 2009 Melrose Place Toby 2 episodes 2010 Lying to Be Perfect Alex Stanson Jr. TV movie 2010 NCIS Det.
