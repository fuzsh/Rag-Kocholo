Poppy Montgomery and her husband Shawn Sanford have been sued by former housekeeper Miriam Trejo, who says that she is owed $48,250 by the couple after working for them for eight years at their Pacific Palisades, California home.

Trejo said she worked for the pair from 2014 until this past May 11, TMZ reported citing court docs, and that the Australian-American actress and her spouse have not paid her money they owe her.

The housekeeper told the court that Montgomery, 50, and her husband did not give her mandated breaks during her shifts, totaling to the amount of $48,250 in potential restitution, Radar reported. The sum includes $36,000 in unpaid salary, and $7,000 in overtime fees.

She is also seeking Sanford and the actress, who has been seen on shows such as Without a Trace, Unforgettable and Reef Break, pay punitive fines after violating labor laws in California.

Trejo said she worked for a $25 hourly wage averaging five days a week for eight hours at a time from noon to 8 p.m., the outlet reported, citing court docs.

She said the couple often required she work 13-hour days, and as a non-exempt employee she was allowed overtime and 30-minute meal and rest breaks she never received.

'Further, she was unable to take her rest breaks because she was constantly needed to perform her duties,' Trejo's attorneys said in court docs, according to Radar.

The lawyers said the housekeeper 'has been deprived of her rightfully earned compensation for meal and rest break violations as a direct and proximate result of Defendantsâ€™ failure and refusal to pay said compensation.'

Sanford, who is an executive for Microsoft, and Montgomery have been linked since 2011 and wed in 2014 at Disneyland.

Montgomery is mother to three children, Jackson Phillip Deveraux Kaufman, 14, from her relationship to actor Adam Kaufman; and daughter Violet Grace, nine, and son Gus Monroe, seven, with Sanford.
