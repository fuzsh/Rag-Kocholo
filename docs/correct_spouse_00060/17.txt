Australian actress Poppy Montgomery has revealed she is married after exchanging vows in a top secret ceremony at Disneyland earlier in 2014.

The Unforgettable star and Shawn Sanford eloped to the California themepark with their children at the end of January and tied the knot with Mickey and Minnie Mouse presiding over the nuptials.

Revealing the big news for the first time on US TV show Live! With Kelly & Michael on Friday, she said: "On Chinese New Year, I ran away with all of the children and I got married at Disneyland. My mother was horrified. She was like, 'How do you turn Disneyland into Vegas?'

"Mickey and Minnie came dressed as a bride and groom."

Montgomery and Sanford began dating in 2011 and welcomed their first child together, Violet Grace, in 2013.

This is the first marriage for the actress, who is also a mum to six-year-old son Jackson Phillip Deveraux Montgomery Kaufman from a previous romance with actor Adam Kaufman.
