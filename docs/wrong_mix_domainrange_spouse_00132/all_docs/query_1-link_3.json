Considering the United States has paused Johnson & Johnson vaccine's administration, this paper aimed to analyze the coagulative effects of mRNA vaccinations (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Numerous research studies have explored the association of AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines with thromboembolic and coagulative events post-administration, however, few have studied the complications, or lack thereof, after receiving mRNA vaccines1,2. Objective: Two outcomes of interest explored were D-dimer levels as well as positive serology of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-PF4) antibodies after healthy participants received COVID-19 mRNA vaccination as compared to prior the administration of vaccination.\n\nMethods: A search conducted across multiple databases, shown in the PRISMA diagram, included keywords relating COVID-19 vaccination with measured D-dimer levels or anti-PF4. After extraction, abstracts were de-duplicated and blindly screened according to pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria using Rayyan platform. D-dimer levels were compared with established normal value of less than 0.5 mg/L, while positive serology for anti-PF4 post-vaccination percentage increases were analyzed. Initial database searches yielded 2007 articles which were de-duplicated to 1240. Further abstract screening and full-text analysis narrowed the search to 6 papers which included healthy participants with no predisposing autoimmune diseases or underlying complications, no COVID-19 infection within the past 3 months, as well as collected blood samples prior to COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nResults: Among 471 subjects analyzed for positive anti-PF4 serology, 10 (2.12%) tested positive post-vaccination. These antibodies remained stable post-vaccination with no adverse complications reported in all studies analyzed. Chi-square test revealed a statistically insignificant chi-square of 1.88 with p-value > 0.05. Out of 278 participants tested for D-dimer levels, there was an 8.00% total increase between mean D-dimer levels of pre-vaccination (0.25 mg/L [95% CI 0.238-0.265]) and post-vaccination (0.27 mg/L [95% CI 0.254-0.289]). A paired sample t-test was conducted to analyze means of difference between before and after vaccination, yielding a p-value > 0.05 with an effect size of 0.12. These tests show no significance of association in both frequency of anti-PF4 seroconversion and d-dimer elevation post-vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. There was no significance associated with either one or two doses administered to participants, as well as absence of thromboembolic events within the time periods followed (up to 57 days, median follow-up of 15 days).\n\nConclusions: The results of this systematic review are two-fold. First, there is no large population analyzed for D-dimer levels or anti-PF4 seroconversion post-vaccination, excluding recently infected COVID-19 participants or any underlying condition that may exponentiate these levels. Second, based on the study data included in this review, mRNA vaccines were not found to be associated with significant increases in D-dimer levels relative to 0.5 mg/L. Moreover, there is a minor anti-PF4 seroconversion rate post-vaccination, which remaining stable even after another dose, which resulted in no further complications during the follow-up period. These results support the continued administration of both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to the public for COVID-19 infection preventative measures.\n\n95\n\nImproved Joint Health After Gene Therapy with Dirloctocogene Samoparvovec (SPK-8011) in People with Hemophilia A\n\nBenjamin Samelson-Jones1, Peter Cygan2, Stacy Croteau3, Huyen Tran4, Margaret Ragni5, Jerome Teitel6, John Rasko 7, Spencer Sullivan 8, Jill Moormeier9, Kristina Haley10, Kristen Jaworski11, Amy MacDougall11, Alexander Long 11, Savina Jaeger 11, Tiffany Chang11, Gallia Levy11\n\n1Division of Hematology and the Raymond G.

Dirloctocogene samoparvovec (SPK-8011), an investigational liver-directed adeno-associated viral-based vector gene therapy for HA, demonstrated reductions in annualized bleed rate of 82% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55-93) and 99% (95% CI: 98-100) for participants who had previously received factor (F)VIII prophylaxis or on-demand treatment, respectively, in a Phase I/II trial. Objectives: To report outcomes of joint health measures in the same interim analysis of the Phase I/II trial.\n\nMethods: In this open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial with a long-term extension (NCT03003533/NCT03432520; funded by Spark Therapeutics), males with HA (FVIII activity ≤2%) received dirloctocogene samoparvovec (George, et al. NEJM 2021). Joint health was assessed longitudinally after treatment using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) v2.1. Presence and resolution of target joints (TJs) were recorded using ISTH definitions. Impact on self-perceived function was assessed via the Hemophilia Activities List (HAL) questionnaire.\n\nResults: Participants with baseline and Year (Y)1 data were included; two who lost transgene expression were excluded. Seven participants had 13 TJs at baseline prior to receiving dirloctocogene samoparvovec; in participants with sufficient follow-up time to assess for TJ resolution (n=5), all TJs (n=10) were resolved by Y1. By data cut-off (October 4, 2022), mean total HJHS improved from 20.0 (standard deviation [SD]: 11.7) at baseline (n=11) to 14.4 (SD: 6.5) at Y3 (n=7). Clinically meaningful improvements (a decrease of ≥4) from baseline were persistent at Y2 (−4.1) and Y3 (−6.4); improvements were observed regardless of prior treatment (on-demand or prophylactic FVIII) or the presence of TJs at baseline. Participants' self-perceived function (mean HAL score) improved from baseline to Y3, irrespective of TJ status or prior treatment.\n\nConclusions: In a Phase I/II trial of HA gene therapy, clinically meaningful improvements in joint health, ongoing at Y3, were persistent in participants who received dirloctocogene samoparvovec, suggesting that this treatment has the potential to improve the pain and musculoskeletal impact of HA. Improvement in participants' self-reported function and resolution of TJs supported these results. The small sample size limits interpretation. These observations will be further explored in a planned pivotal trial.\n\n100\n\nCoagulation profile and clot stiffness analysis from COVID-19-positive patients using a novel viscoelasticity testing technology\n\nDimitria Bonizol Camasao1,2+, Jose G.

A personalized patient-oriented treatment is sought given the large diversity of patient cohorts, with the analysis of different biomarkers and coagulation profiles. The viscoelasticity testing of bilayered materials (VeTBiM) technology has been recently introduced as a precise method to measure the real-time viscoelasticity of coagulating blood. In this work, this technology was used to obtain the coagulation profile and the clot stiffness of plasma samples from hospitalized patients in the general COVID-19 ward (non-ICU) and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Eighteen plasma samples from eleven hospitalized patients, collected at various times relative to the first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (Dec 2020 - Jun 2021), were obtained from the McGill University Health Centre COVID-19 Biobank (Montreal, Canada). Activated partial thromboplastin time reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) induced the coagulation of plasma samples. The final solution was immediately tested in the ElastoSensTM Bio (VeTBiM technology, Rheolution, Canada) at 37 °C (figure 1). Shear storage modulus (G' in Pascals [Pa], physical property that represents the stiffness of the forming clot) as a function of time was obtained for each sample. Four descriptors were extracted from the G'-vs-time curves: clotting initiation time (time at which G' reached 15 Pa), clotting time (time at which G' reached 90% of final G'), maximum clotting rate (Pa/s) and final clot stiffness (final G'). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to examine the effects of ICU admission, sampling time, among others, on these descriptors. Results Figure 2 displays the four descriptors extracted from the coagulation profiles. Clotting initiation time did not show a trend over time with values ranging from 20 to 120 s. Clotting time slightly decreased over time, in line with a slight increase in the maximum clotting rate. This tendency implies that clotting occurs more rapidly as time advances from the onset of the disease, however, a larger number of samples especially from each individual should be analyzed to confirm this trend. Clot stiffness underwent a significant decrease over time. For this descriptor only, statistical analysis showed an interaction effect between ICU admission (i.e., non-ICU vs ICU) and blood sampling time (p<0.0001). In the presence of other covariates, the results showed a more rapid decrease in the clot stiffness for the non-ICU patients compared to those in the ICU. Previous studies suggest that clot stiffness is directly related to the occurrence of thromboembolic complications, and therefore the monitoring of this parameter could help in optimizing anticoagulant therapies. Conclusions The VeTBiM technology has demonstrated potential in providing precise information on the coagulation profile and clot stiffness from plasma samples. The clot stiffness decreased with time post COVID-19 infection, and at a slower rate for patients in the ICU when compared to those in the general ward. This type of analysis can be valuable in research for the fundamental study of coagulopathies as well as in clinics to help establish personalized and more effective treatments for this life-threatening complication.\n\n101\n\nUtility of thromboelastography versus routine coagulation tests: cardiac bypass surgery.\n\nISABEL RODRIGUEZ MARTIN\n\nHospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, SEVILLA, Spain\n\nBackground: Viscoelastic tests (rotational thromboelastometry, ROTEM®), together with the implementation of a specific algorithm for coagulation management in cardiac surgery, enable perioperative coagulopathy to be better controlled.\n\nMethods: Retrospective cohort study including 675 patients who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The incidence of allogeneic blood transfusions and clinical postoperative complications were analyzed before and after ROTEM® implementation.\n\nResults: Following viscoelastic testing and the implementation of a specific algorithm for coagulation management, the incidence of any allogeneic blood transfusion decreased (41.4% vs 31.9%, p=0.026) during the perioperative period. In the group monitored with ROTEM®, decreased incidence of transfusion was observed for packed red blood cells (31.3% vs 19.8%, p=0.002), fresh frozen plasma (9.8% vs 3.8%, p=0.008), prothrombin complex concentrate administration (0.9% vs 0.3%, p=0.599) and activated recombinant factor VII (0.3% vs 0.0%, p=0.603). Increased incidence was observed for platelet transfusion (4.8% vs 6.8%, p=0.530) and fibrinogen concentrate (0.9% vs 3.5%, p=0.066), tranexamic acid (0.0% vs 0.6%, p=0.370) and protamine administration (0.6% vs 0.9%, p=0.908). Similar results were observed in the postoperative period, but with a decreased incidence of platelet transfusion (4.8% vs 3.8%, p ¼ .813). In addition, statistically significant reductions were detected in the incidence of postoperative bleeding (9.5% vs 5.3%, p=0.037), surgical reexploration (6.0% vs 2.9%, p=0.035), and length of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay (6.0 days vs 5.3 days, p=0.026).\n\nConclusions: The monitoring of hemostasis by ROTEM® in cardiac surgery, was associated with decreased incidence of allogeneic blood transfusion, clinical hematologic postoperative complications and lengths of ICU stay.\n\n105\n\nDoes unfractionated heparin versus low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis reduce complications near delivery?\n\nSophia A. Cordes , Hani Faysal , Joaquin A. Calderon , Renxi Li , Sonya T. Gelfand , Mina Felfeli , Haeun Kim , Homa K. Ahmadzia\n\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, USA\n\nIntroduction: To analyze whether the conversion of pregnant patients from low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to unfractionated heparin (UFH) prior to delivery results in improved outcomes and harm reduction.\n\nMethods: A retrospective chart review of was conducted using data from 141 pregnant patients who delivered at a single university-affiliated hospital from January 2015 to September 2022 and were on LMWH or UFH during their pregnancy up until delivery. The primary outcome was the prevalence of hemorrhage associated morbidity in patients who were switched from LMWH to UFH prior to delivery. Secondary outcomes included neuraxial (NA) anesthesia complications, specifically related to anticoagulant use.\n\nResults: Out of a total of 141 patients, 38 were converted from LMWH to UFH prior to delivery. The conversion and non-conversion groups had comparable rates of postpartum hemorrhage during delivery (5.3% vs 14.6% respectively, aOR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.09-2.05, p=0.29). Conversion and non-conversion groups have no difference in estimated blood loss (406.7 ± 53.0 vs 562.6 ± 73.1 mL, p=0.98) or quantitative blood loss (655.9 ± 296.6 vs 667.4 ± 62.3 mL, p=0.89). Only two patients in the LMWH group experienced NA anesthesia complications, but these were unrelated to anticoagulant use (headaches). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that there is not a significant difference in postpartum hemorrhage in pregnant patients who were switched from LMWH to UFH prior to delivery compared to those who were not switched. The prevalence of NA anesthesia complications was not high enough to be comparable and unrelated to a bleeding complication.\n\n107\n\nSafety and Efficacy of Long-Term Treatment of Type 1 Plasminogen Deficiency Patients with Intravenous Plasminogen Replacement Therapy\n\nAmy D Shapiro1, Heather McDaniel2, Robert W Decker3, Jeremy Lorber3, Karen Thibaudeau4, Joseph M Parker5\n\n1Indiana Hemophilia & Thrombosis Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA, 2Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA, 3Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA, 4Kedrion, Laval, Canada, 5Kedrion, Fort Lee, NJ, USA\n\nBackground: Type 1 Plasminogen Deficiency (PLGD-1) is an ultrarare autosomal-recessive disorder of the fibrinolytic system, with an estimated prevalence of 1.6 individuals per million people. The primary manifestation of PLGD-1 is the development of abnormal extra-vascular fibrin-rich, ligneous lesions on mucosa throughout the body. The most commonly observed lesions are in the eye (ligneous conjunctivitis) with lesions also noted in other systems including the ears, mouth, central nervous system, skin, and respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Lesions may have life-altering and life-threatening consequences including vision and/or hearing loss, airway obstruction, hydrocephalus, and infertility. Plasminogen, human-tvmh is a plasma derived human Glu-plasminogen concentrate indicated for the treatment of subjects with PLGD-1. It is a lyophilized formulation administered IV at a dose of 6.6mg/kg every 2 to 4 days at home or in the clinic. Plasminogen, human-tvmh was FDA-approved in 2021 in the US based on a phase 2/3 pivotal trial (Shapiro et al, 2023). IV plasminogen replacement therapy is the only approved therapy specific for this disorder. Here are reported the safety and continued efficacy of plasminogen, human-tvmh evaluated in a long-term extended treatment trial for PLGD-1 patients who previously participated in the phase 2/3 or expanded access clinical trials. Objectives: Determine the safety and the efficacy of plasminogen replacement therapy on the recurrence or development of new ligneous lesions during long-term maintenance treatment.\n\nMethods: US patients with PLGD-1 who participated in the phase 2/3 pivotal trial (NCT02690714) or in individual expanded access trials were eligible for participation in this study. Patients continued receiving plasminogen, human-tvmh starting at the same dose and frequency as the qualifying trial. Frequency of dosing was adjusted by the investigator based upon clinical evaluation and drug availability. Safety and efficacy assessments were performed every 26 weeks until trial conclusion including physical examinations and laboratory testing as deemed necessary by the investigator. Blood samples for plasminogen activity trough levels and anti-plasminogen antibodies were collected at study site at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment continued until plasminogen, human-tvmh was commercially available.\n\nResults: This long-term treatment protocol (NCT03642691) enrolled 12 patients, 7 pediatric and 5 adults. Eight (8) patients continued from the phase 2/3 pivotal trial and 4 patients were included from individual expanded access trials. Patients were treated for a mean duration of 159 (range 107 - 183) weeks. There were no new or recurrent ligneous lesions which developed during the observation time period under recommended treatment. However, there were recurrences in 4 subjects which ensued during reduced or missed dosing due to supply issues. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate and did not require patients to interrupt or discontinue dosing. There were 5 reported severe adverse events however none were deemed drug related. Plasminogen activity levels when measured remained appropriate for the dosing interval and there was no development of anti-plasminogen antibodies.\n\nConclusions: Intravenous plasminogen replacement therapy was observed to be well tolerated and effective in this long-term extended treatment trial.\n\n109\n\nReal-World Use of Recombinant Factor IX Fusion Protein in Previously Untreated Patients with Congenital Hemophilia B from the ATHN 8 Study\n\nCourtney D. Thornburg1, Martin Chandler2, Lynn Malec3, Matthew Manuel2, Carrie O'Neill2, Michael Recht4, 5, Elizabeth Taggart2, Hongseok Kim6, Vidhi Desai6, Hiren Shah6, Shannon L. Carpenter7\n\n1Rady Childrenâs Hospital San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA, 2American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network, Rochester, NY, USA, 3Versiti Blood Research Institute, Waukesha, WI, USA, 4Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA, 5National Bleeding Disorders Foundation, New York, NY, USA, 6CSL Behring, King of Prussia, PA, USA, 7Childrenâs Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO, USA\n\nBackground: People with hemophilia are at risk of developing neutralizing inhibitors to factor products. Previously untreated patients (PUPs) are particularly vulnerable, and development of inhibitors is most likely to occur within 20 exposure days (EDs). Recombinant factor IX fusion protein (rIX-FP) was shown to be safe and efficacious in preventing bleeding episodes among 12 PUPs with hemophilia B (NCT02053792); 1 of the 12 participants, an 11-year-old male with deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the FIX gene, developed factor IX (FIX) inhibitors. Large gene deletions are a known risk factor for inhibitor development. While some risk factors for inhibitor development are known, the ability to accurately predict who is at the highest risk for inhibitor development remains a challenge. To address this knowledge gap, a study was conceptualized to understand the variables contributing to inhibitor development. The American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network (ATHN) ATHN 8 study is a US-based longitudinal cohort study of PUPs with moderate or severe hemophilia A or B (ATHN 8; NCT03818529). In the ATHN 8 study, 3 of 39 participants with hemophilia B developed inhibitors within the first 50 EDs. Here we present a subset of PUPs with hemophilia B from the ATHN8 study who received rIX-FP. Objectives: This report evaluates inhibitor development in PUPs with congenital hemophilia B who received rIX-FP in the real-world setting.\n\nMethods: Data were collected for a subset of PUPs from ATHN 8 with hemophilia B who were born between January 2010 and September 2021 and received rIX-FP. Participants were enrolled at ATHN-affiliated sites until 50 clotting factor EDs, development of a confirmed neutralizing inhibitor, or study closure. Results were summarized descriptively.\n\nResults: The study enrolled 10 males with moderate-to-severe hemophilia B who received rIX-FP. Among these 10 participants, none developed an inhibitor during the study. Of these, 60% (6/10) had at least 50 EDs. Mean FIX EDs was 45 days. Eight participants (80%) had severe hemophilia and were less than 1 month old (60%) at the time of their first bleed (Table 1 shows additional baseline demographics).\n\nConclusions: In the subanalysis of participants with hemophilia B who received rIX-FP, none developed inhibitors. This included 7 participants with more than 20 EDs, of whom 6 had more than 50 EDs. This is consistent with what was seen in the clinical trial.\n\n110\n\nThrombosis Rates and Use of Thromboprophylaxis after Discharge from Gynecologic Cancer-Related Surgery\n\nLeticia Campoverde , Alyssa Mercadel , Dan Morgenster , Asaad Trabolsi , Thomas Plate IV , Rachel Kronenfeld , Wei Zhao , Matthew Schlumbrecht , Gerald Soff\n\nUniversity of Miami, Miami, FL, USA\n\nBACKGROUND: Cancer and major abdominopelvic surgeries each pose significant thrombosis risks, making cancer-related surgery highly susceptible to venous thromboembolism (VTE). Without post-operative thromboprophylaxis (TPX), VTE risk can reach 29% in the weeks following major cancer surgeries. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend anticoagulation for up to 4 weeks after such surgeries, primarily using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). As a Quality Assessment/Quality Improvement (QA/QI) project, we assessed the VTE rates linked to various gynecologic cancer-related surgeries and the compliance with TPX in a large cancer-center cohort. Additionally, we sought to further characterize the thrombosis risk as a function of surgical procedure and cancer type. METHODS: Patients (pts) diagnosed with gynecologic cancer between January 1st, 2012, through September 15th, 2022, at our institution were identified through our tumor registry. Using an in-house automated text search tool from our electronic medical record (Epic®), combined with natural language processing review, venous thromboembolism (VTE) events were identified, with secondary adjudication by the study leader (GAS). VTE was defined as either lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed from the day of surgery until 90 days after surgery. Logistic regression was performed on binary outcomes for the presence of VTE and TPX use at discharge. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used for overall survival analysis. RESULTS: 801 pts were identified who underwent gynecologic cancer-related surgery. The overall VTE rate was 1.9% (n=15) but the events were not equally distributed. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), vulvovaginal surgery, and biopsies collectively were associated with VTE rate of 0.57% (n=3), even when considering that only 11.1% of those pts received TPX at discharge. VTE was more commonly diagnosed in patients who underwent open surgery (4.3%, n=12), with 5 pts (1.8%) having VTE events before discharge and 7 (2.5%) after discharge. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, open procedures were associated with a higher risk of thrombosis (RR 7.5, p <0.001). Notably, only 50% (139 of 279) of pts who underwent open surgery received TPX at the time of discharge. Within the open surgery cohort, there was an inverse correlation between the incidence of post-discharge VTE and the utilization of post-discharge TPX. Of the 139 patients who received post-discharge TPX, 1 (0.7%) developed VTE, compared with 6 (4.3%) of the 140 patients who did not receive post-discharge TPX. (RR 0.17, p= 0.12). There was no difference in overall survival in pts who received TPX and those who did not, up to 36 months after open surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a tiered risk of post-operative VTE after gynecologic cancer surgery, with a clinically relevant risk observed only in women undergoing open surgery. In patients who underwent open surgery, TPX at discharge showed a trend towards a protective effect, although this result did not reach statistical significance, probably due to sample size. This supports the need for improved targeted thrombosis prophylaxis.\n\n111\n\nLong-Term Efficacy and Safety With Oral Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Rilzabrutinib in Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenia\n\nDavid J Kuter1, Terry Gernsheimer2, Waleed Ghanima3, Umer Khan4, Brad Ward5, Ahmed Daak5, Nichola Cooper6\n\n1Hematology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA, 2University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA, 3Ãstfold Hospital Foundation, Gralum, Norway, 4Biostatistics, Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ, USA, 5Sanofi, Cambridge, MA, USA, 6Department of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom\n\nBackground: Adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) treated with rilzabrutinib showed rapid and durable platelet responses and acceptable safety profiles in a global phase I/II trial (NCT03395210). Objective: To report updated efficacy and safety of rilzabrutinib in patients receiving 400 mg BID for 2 years in a long-term extension (LTE) study.\n\nMethods: ITP patients with 2 baseline platelet counts <30×109/L who responded to ≥1 prior ITP therapy but were unable to maintain adequate response to prior/concomitant therapies enrolled in the main study. Primary endpoints were safety and platelet responses (≥2 consecutive platelet counts ≥50×109/L and increased ≥20×109/L from baseline without rescue medication). Patients in the main 24-week study were eligible for LTE if platelet count was ≥50×109/L for ≥50% of last 8 weeks of treatment.\n\nResults: As of 21 December 2022, 16 of 60 patients from the main study enrolled in LTE on rilzabrutinib 400 mg BID (n=11 with concomitant CS and/or TPO-RA). At enrollment, patients had median duration of ITP for 4.3 years, received a median of 3 (range, 1-9) unique prior therapies; 3 were splenectomized. The median treatment duration for main+LTE periods was 1032 days (range, 318-1506). Figure 1 shows median platelet counts over time. All LTE patients met the primary endpoint with median platelet count at LTE entry of 87×109/L. After LTE entry, median platelet counts for LTE patients were 92×109/L, 71×109/L, 61×109/L, and 64×109/L at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Table 1 shows platelet counts above various LTE thresholds; 14 (88%) patients achieved platelet counts ≥100×109/L during the LTE. Two patients received rescue medication during the LTE. All treatment-related adverse events were transient, grade 1/2 events with no related bleeding or thrombotic events, serious adverse events, or deaths.\n\nConclusions: With continued treatment through the LTE, rilzabrutinib 400 mg BID demonstrated durable clinical activity and remains well tolerated in patients with ITP.\n\n112\n\nSurgical and procedural outcomes for patients with factor VIII deficiency taking Emicizumab prophylactically: A regional approach to data collection and analysis\n\nJanice Kuhn1, Butler Regina2, Mailie-Howell Lisa2, Druzgal Colleen3, Sennett Margy3\n\n1Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA, 2Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphila, PA, USA, 3University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA\n\nBackground Emicizumab (Emi) is a recombinant, humanized bi-specific antibody directed against activated factor IX and factor X. Emi is used to bypass the need for Factor VIII (FVIII) to prevent bleeding in persons with hemophilia A (PWHA) with and without inhibitors. While Emi improves hemostasis and is effective in preventing bleeding, it does not normalize hemostasis and interferes with standard coagulation tests. Experience to date with surgeries is limited. Objectives Primary objective: To evaluate bleeding and clotting outcomes of patients with Hemophilia A (PWHA), with and without inhibitors on Emi, who underwent major and minor surgery. Secondary objectives: 1) To examine the incidence of excessive bleeding or clotting in PWHA with and without inhibitors undergoing major and minor surgery with and without FVIII prophylaxis and/or bypassing agents. 2) To determine the amount of FVIII and/or bypassing agents' utilization in these patients and to compare the utilization to bleeding or clotting outcomes.\n\nMethods: In 2021, the Mid-Atlantic Region III Hemophilia Treatment Centers (MAR) contracted through its core center with the American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network (ATHN) to develop two data validation forms and data entry guides. The forms use the ATHN dataset (ADS), a de-identified data set derived from clinical data entered in ATHN Clinical Manager (CM) by hemophilia treatment centers, reducing the need for human subject research requirements and data re-entry. All data fields for this project were previously available in CM. The MAR Community of Practice Forum supported site recruitment and project implementation. The data elements from the ADS that were analyzed in the project objectives include: 1) Demographic Data: Year of birth, race, ethnicity, sex, education level, employment status, first 3 numbers of zip code. 2) Clinical Data: Diagnoses, inhibitor status, medication usage, and surgery/procedure details including month and year, type, anatomical location, and outcome. An Emi Surgery Project Committee from MAR received retrospective de-identified monthly data cuts for their review and analysis. Data analysis was descriptive in nature. The type of surgeries was classified into major and minor surgeries according to criteria established by Santagostino (Haemophilia 2015, 21, 24-40).\n\nResults: Sixty-two surgeries/procedures have been analyzed as of December 1, 2023. All sixteen of the major surgeries/procedures used factor prophylactically with an average of 4.47 days of factor (0-15 range). Two cases also used an antifibrinolytic. Two surgeries (prostatectomy and tonsillectomy) had unexpected bleeding, but neither required the administration of blood products. No clotting was reported. Of the 32/46 minor surgeries/procedures, fourteen (10 ENT and 4 scopes) did not use any factor concentrate, and 22/46 used an antifibrinolytic. Of the 18 using factor concentrate, the average days of use was 2.9 days (range 1-7) with a mode of 1 day. No expected bleeding or clotting was reported. Nineteen dental surgeries were reported. Eight did not use factor concentrate. Seventy-five percent of those used an antifibrinolytic (Figure 1). Conclusion The MAR Emi Surgery and Procedure Project provides real world data on the hemostasis management of patients taking Emi. This abstract presents preliminary results in an ongoing project.\n\n113\n\nThe Role of Fibrinogen in Changing the Hemostasis of Patients with Neoplasia and Their Influence on the Microcirculatory Bed of the Lungs and Control by Anticoagulants\n\nVira A. Barilka , Volodymyr L. Matlan , Sofia V. Prymak , Olha O. Shalay , Vasyl L. Novak\n\nSI \"Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine of NAMS of Ukraine\" Lviv Ukraine, Lviv, Ukrenia\n\nIntroduction: Fibrinogen (Fib) is the first coagulation factor with a half-life of 4-5 days in peripheral blood, an important indicator for the assessment of hemostasis and inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF), antiinflammatory transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1), which are secreted by the tumor can stimulate the synthesis of procoagulants and fibrinogen. Elevated Fib are life-threatening in oncohematological patients (pts) due to thrombosis within 1-12 days after surgical removal of tumors without the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The LMWH pharmacokinetics determined by indicators of anti-Xa-factor activity of plasma, which is not always available, and the efficacy of treatment with LMWH is insufficiently studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Fib level in plasma of 81 patients (pts) with uterine, cervical, ovarian, lung cancer and non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) before and after surgical removal/treatment and to select the doses of LMWH to prevent thrombosis.\n\nMethods: The hemostatic parametrs were investigated in tumors outflowing blood, peripheral arterial and venous citrate blood by the hemostatic methods. TNF and TGFβ1 were detected by biological methods. The mediana age 52 (range 40 - 68 years). Pts had no signs of thrombosis at the time of examination. The median Fib before surgery - 6.4 mg / ml (range 5.69 - 13.02 ), after surgery - 8.4 mg / ml (range 4.1 - 14.97). Fib content was determined on the 3rd day before treatment and up to 10 days after surgery/treatment. The use of LMWH was performed according to the level of Fib.\n\nResults: We administered LMWH subcutaneously once a day in 10,000 anti-Xa IU / ml in the preoperative period when Fib was ≥ 5.0 to 7,8 mg/ml. In cases of Fib ≥ 7,8 mg / ml used LMWH 2 times a day in the concentration above. In the postoperative period (Fib ≥ 5.0 to 7.8 mg / ml) we used subcutaneous administration of LMWH once a day at a dose of 10,000 anti-Xa IU / ml for 3 days, followed by pentoxifylline, aspirin for 60 days. If the level of Fib exceeded 8 mg / ml (in 40.5% of pts) in the postoperative period we used LMWH two times a day at a dose 10,000 anti-Xa IU / ml for 3 to 10 days, for the reduction of Fib. A significant decrease in TNF, TGFβ1 in plasma was observed in pts on the 10-th day after treatment with LMWH (pË0, 005; in both cases) . However, the level of TNF, TGFβ1 in pts plasma was significantly higher before and after treatment than in healthy individuals.\n\nConclusions: The determination of Fib and the use of LMWH according to the level of Fib allows to avoid mortality in the postoperative period and after the first line treatments of NHL. The cytokines from the tumors microenvironment determine the high procoagulant activity of the blood flowing from the tumor.\n\n116\n\nTransfusion Trends in the Obstetric Population with Analysis of a Soft Stop Transfusion EMR Alert\n\nMaren Plant1, Sophia Cordes1, Caroline Bereuter1, Jaclyn Phillips1, Xiomara Fernandez2, Homa Ahmadzia1\n\n1Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, George Washington University , Washington, DC, USA, 2Department of Pathology, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA\n\nBackground: Blood product transfusion plays an important role in treating obstetric hemorrhage, which is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Obstetric transfusion practices are varied, and research in this area is limited. The recent advent of EMR soft stop transfusion alerts has the potential to limit unnecessary transfusion in patients. Analysis of overall transfusion trends in the obstetric population and with respect to EMR alerts may inform further research and guidelines. Objective(s): This study aimed to analyze transfusion trends in the obstetric patient population at a large university hospital before and after implementation of a soft stop EMR alert notifying providers before transfusing patients with a hemoglobin greater than 8 g/dL. Study Design: The study included 17,744 patients who delivered at the hospital between February 2015 and December 2022. The EMR soft stop alert was implemented in February 2022. Patients were split into two cohorts-those prior to and those following the date of alert implementation. Records of hematocrit values and transfusion were pulled from the electronic medical record. Transfusion data included packed red blood cells, thawed plasma, and platelets. Means and medians were calculated for hematocrit drawn closest to admission and closest to discharge, and by the number of units received. Using a two-tailed unpaired t-test for samples with unequal variance, a p-value was calculated for number of units transfused in cohorts 1 versus 2.\n\nResults: Of the 17,744 patients included in the study, 208 received postpartum transfusions of pRBCs, FFP, and/or platelets. Average estimated blood loss (EBL) was 1996 ± 1505 mL (range 150-1505). 170 participants were included in cohort 1 from February 2015-January 2022. 38 participants were included in cohort 2 (following alert implementation) from February 2022-December 2022. The average number of units transfused in Cohort 1 vs. Cohort 2 was 2.9 vs. 2.0 units (p=0.039). Cohorts 1 and 2 had an equal average hematocrit closest to discharge. The average hematocrit closest to discharge for the total population was 27.2% ± 5.0. Broken down by blood product units received, the average hematocrit closest to discharge for the total population was 27.1% ± 4.7, 27.2% ± 5.2, and 27.4% ± 5.1 for 1 unit, 2 units, and 3+ units respectively (Table 1). Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in the total number of units transfused after the EMR soft stop was implemented. While many factors influence the decision to transfuse, this alert may correlate with a reduction in the number of transfusions in obstetric patients. Overall, more research is needed to guide transfusion practices, including analysis of intrapartum transfusion with respect to postpartum transfusion.\n\n117\n\nCorrelation Between ABO Blood Types and Disease Severity in Sickle Cell Anemia: Implications for Thrombosis and Hemostasis.\n\nGeorge M Bassey1, Titilope A Adeyemo1,2, Ann A Ogbenna1,2, Abiola B Bolarinwa1, Ademola S Adewoyin2, Emmanuel Iyere1\n\n1Lagos University Teaching Hospital , Lagos, Nigeria, 2College of Medicine University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria\n\nBackground: Hemoglobin S (HbS), arising from a single nucleotide substitution in the gene encoding β-globin, leads to pathological hemolysis and concurrent endothelial dysfunction. This process induces a prothrombotic state characterized by elevated markers such as VCAM and VWF. Hemolysis, along with other mechanisms also contributes to an increased platelet count, exacerbating adhesion molecule expression, thus intensifying the prothrombotic state and worsening the vaso-occlusive complications associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) e.g. pulmonary hypertension, non-hemorrhagic stroke, priapism, and cutaneous leg ulcers. While the scientific relevance of ABO blood types in various diseases, including thrombosis, is well-established in non-SCD populations, this is yet to be examined in SCD population. Aim: Our study seeks to explore the correlation between disease severity, markers of endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, and ABO phenotypes in individuals with sickle cell anemia. Materials and\n\nMethods: We enrolled seventy-three participants with SCD in this investigation. We evaluated their clinical attributes, disease severity, ABO blood phenotypes, markers of hemolysis (Hbfree, lactate dehydrogenase - LDH, total and conjugated bilirubin, corrected reticulocyte count, and reticulocyte production index), as well as markers for endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis (VCAM, von Willebrand Factor - vWF, platelet count, and nitric oxide - NO). Hbfree, VCAM, vWF, and NO levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunoassay techniques. LDH and bilirubin (total, conjugated, and unconjugated) were assessed using a COBAS C311 chemistry auto-analyzer. Full blood count and reticulocyte count were determined through automated procedures. Blood group phenotypes were determined using the tile method. Our analyses involved ANOVA and logistic regression to establish associations between hemolysis markers, blood group phenotypes, and disease severity, with a statistical significance level set at 5%.\n\nResults: Our findings indicated that individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and non-group O blood phenotypes demonstrated elevated levels of VCAM, vWF, platelet count, and reduced levels of nitric oxide compared to SCA individuals with group O blood types (P <0.05 in all cases). Disease severity was notably higher in SCA individuals with non-group O blood types. Conclusion: The combined effects of non-group O blood type and SCA appear to independently contribute to a prothrombotic state, heightening the severity of the disease and increasing the risk of developing severe complications associated with sickle cell disease. These findings have significant implications for understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and hemostasis in individuals with SCD.\n\n118\n\nStructured Education for Newly Diagnosed Persons with von Willebrand Disease: A Hemophilia Treatment Center Quality Improvement Project Abstract\n\nDominique N. Barclay , Sarah E. Gonzales , Marsha Hurn , Amanda Kilgore , Jesla Ryan , Jonathan C. Roberts , Michael D. Tarantino\n\nBleeding and Clotting Disorders Institute, Peoria, IL, USA\n\nBackground: At Comprehensive Care Clinic visits following the new diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD) patients verbalized lack of understanding of their diagnosis, treatment, and the different types of clinics provided at BCDI a federally recognized treatment center for persons with bleeding disorders. BCDI staff noted inconsistencies in patients and families receiving education, documentation of education and the new diagnosis in the electronic medical record (EMR). Without consistent, comprehensive education, patients are unable to self-advocate, receive optimal care or improve their health outcomes. To address this process, BCDI developed a quality improvement project. VWD was the pilot disorder to implement the structured education program. Project Aims: 1) Improve patients' understanding of the diagnosis, treatment options and services offered by BCDI. 2) Develop a standardized method to deliver education to patients and families utilizing BCDI approved educational materials. 3) Improve documentation of diagnosis and education materials provided within the EMR.\n\nMethods: Data was collected by reviewing newly diagnosed patients at BCDI from January 2022 to September 2022. Focusing on new VWD diagnoses, data included diagnosis date and when documented, patient notificaton date, documentation of education materials provided, whether a school in-service was scheduled, type of follow-up visits, personnel who entered diagnosis in problem list. The team developed an education visit plan, reviewed available education materials and ensured they were up-to-date and available for patient use, developed an education visit checklist outlining the visit, and created pre- and post-visit questionnaires to evaluate project effectiveness. Questions utilized a 0-4 scale with 4 being the best rating, other questions were in multiple choice format.\n\nResults: Ten newly diagnosed VWD patients participated in the pilot educational program. A pre-visit questionnaire was completed by each patient and then the education nurse reviewed diagnosis, laboratory results, educational materials, inheritance of VWD, signs & symptoms, and treatment options with each patient. The Medical Social Worker reviewed assistance programs, travel letters, medical jewelry, school in-services, BCDI's patient advisory board and BCDI's website. The Physical Therapist reviewed the Comprehensive Care model and the NHF \"Play It Safe\" booklet. Patients then completed the post-visit questionnaires. Two weeks after the education visit the Education Nurse completed a follow-up phone call to answer any additional questions. Analysis of the pre- and post-visit questionnaires revealed that patient's familiarity with the VWD diagnosis, using 0-4 scale, improved from pre-visit educaton score of 0.8 (0-2) to 3.6. (3-4). Fig 1a. Patient understanding of medications to avoid improved with 9/10 correct answers to multiple choice question, compaired to 2/10. Of fifteen services, patients chose which they believed BCDI provided before and after the education visit. Improvement was seen after education visit. Fig 3a, 3b. Conclusion: Analysis demonstrated marked improvement in the patients understanding of diagnosis, treatment and services provided by BCDI. We plan to use the data from VWD and expand this process for other disorders of hemostasis and thrombosis managed at BCDI.\n\n119\n\nImpact of Anticoagulation in Acquired Hemophilia A\n\nHeather Frazier , Sean Dougherty , Kia Salafian , Hillary Maitland\n\nUniversity of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA\n\nBackground: Acquired Hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune disorder that occurs due to the development of autoantibodies against factor VIII which leads to inhibition of the coagulation cascade and results in a propensity for hemorrhage. The estimated incidence is approximately 1.5 per million per year. It carries an exceptionally high morbidity and mortality rate, with severe or life-threatening hemorrhagic events occurring in 70-90% of cases, with 5-10% of these cases resulting in mortality. Several underlying conditions are associated with AHA, including autoimmune disorders, obstetrical and oncologic disease, and various medications, such as direct oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy, both of whose usage has increased significantly over the past decade. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate whether patients prescribed an antiplatelet (APT) or oral anticoagulant (OAC) at the time of diagnosis of AHA experienced more severe bleeding and worse clinical outcomes compared to those with AHA with no prior exposure. Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study examining 16 individuals with AHA from April 2013 to April 2023. Individuals were categorized by the presence or absence of a prescribed anticoagulant then divided into class of anticoagulant (APT, OAC, or exposure to both). Primary end points included the number of blood product transfusions received, hospital length of stay (LOS), need for intervention or procedure, and degree of hemoglobin drop from baseline. Continuous variables were compared using t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results: In our cohort of 16 individuals, 9 were without prior exposure to anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents before the diagnosis of AHA while 7 were prescribed either an anticoagulant, antiplatelet agent, or both. Of those taking one of these classes of medications, 2 were prescribed OACs, 3 were prescribed APTs, and 2 were prescribed both classes. Please see Table 1 for baseline data and primary end point data in detail. In each group there was only one individual who required procedural intervention. There was a statistically significant increase in intramuscular bleeding with a mean of 1.0 and 5.0 (p value 0.035) in the non-exposed and exposed groups respectively. Conclusions: The increased rates of intramuscular bleeding in patients exposed to prior anticoagulation was statistically significant. Intramuscular hemorrhage is associated with increased morbidity due to the risk for compartment syndrome requiring surgical intervention. Our data demonstrates a trend towards the need for a longer hospitalization and more pRBC transfusions in individuals with prior exposure though notably, there is not an apparent increased trend for an increased rate of platelet transfusions. There is also a trend towards significance for higher factor VIII titer inhibitor levels in patients on anticoagulation at the time of diagnosis. While this study is limited in power by sample size, there are no comparable studies to date examining the impact of anticoagulation on individuals with AHA. With the increasing rates of anticoagulation therapy, further investigation is needed on the impact of therapeutic anticoagulant or antiplatelet use prior to the diagnosis of AHA and subsequent clinical outcomes.\n\n123\n\nOutcomes in North American Participants Who Received Efanesoctocog Alfa Prophylaxis in the XTEND-1 Study\n\nAnnette von Drygalski1, Tung Wynn2, Doris Quon3, Anthony KC Chan4, Angela C Weyand5, Davide Matino6, Jennifer Dumont7, Andrew Wilson7, Umer Khan8, Sriya Gunawardena9\n\n1Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA, 2Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, 3Luskin Orthopaedic Institute for Children, Los Angeles, CA, USA, 4Department of Pediatrics, McMaster Childrenâs Hospital, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, 5Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, 6Division of Hematology & Thromboembolism, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, 7Sanofi, Cambridge, MA, USA, 8Sanofi, San Diego, CA, USA, 9Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ, USA\n\nBackground: Efanesoctocog alfa (formerly BIVV001) is a first-in-class high-sustained factor VIII (FVIII) replacement therapy uniquely designed to overcome the von Willebrand factor-imposed FVIII half-life ceiling. Results from the Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) in adolescents and adults with severe hemophilia A demonstrated that once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa is well tolerated and provides superior bleed protection versus prior standard-of-care prophylaxis. Efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis provides high sustained mean FVIII activity levels within the normal to near-normal range (>40%) for most of the week and 15% at the end of the weekly dosing interval. Objective: To report outcomes on the subset of participants in XTEND-1 from North America.\n\nMethods: Adult and adolescent participants on prior FVIII prophylaxis entered Arm A (52 weeks once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis [50 IU/kg]). A subset had enrolled in a 12-month observational pre-study (242HA201/OBS16221). Outcomes reported here include bleed rates, bleed treatment, joint health, pain, physical health, and safety. Model-based annualized bleed rate (ABR) was estimated using a negative binomial regression model. Mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) for intra-patient comparison of ABR pre-study and during XTEND-1 were calculated using paired t-test.\n\nResults: Twenty-six participants from North America were enrolled in Arm A of XTEND-1. Mean (range) age was 31.1 (12, 72) years and 1 participant was female (4%). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) duration of the efficacy period was 43.6 (12.3) weeks. Median (interquartile range) overall ABR was 0.0 (0.0, 1.1) and model-based mean (95% CI) ABR was 0.64 (0.37, 1.12). Following switch from prior FVIII prophylaxis to efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis, mean ABR reduced from 2.37 to 0.56 in the 9 participants with ≥6 months of follow-up in the observational pre-study and during XTEND-1 (mean difference [95% CI]: -1.80 [-3.72, 0.12], P=0.0621). Sixteen participants (62%) did not experience a bleeding episode during XTEND-1, and 23 (89%) did not experience a spontaneous bleeding episode (Figure). In total there were 14 bleeding episodes during XTEND-1, including 7 joint, 5 muscle, and 2 internal; all resolved with a single injection of efanesoctocog alfa (50 IU/kg). The least squares mean change (95% CI) from baseline to Week 52 in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Intensity 3a T-score was -2.2 (-5.4, 1.0), n=20; Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults Physical Health score was -11.3 (-22.2, -0.5), n=14; and Hemophilia Joint Health Score was -1.9 (-5.2, 1.4), n=18 (Table). Mean (SD) annualized factor consumption was 2806 (312) IU/kg. Twenty-one (81%) participants had ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Three patients (12%) reported treatment-emergent serious adverse events; no TEAEs led to discontinuation. Inhibitor development was not detected and there were no deaths.\n\nConclusions: Outcomes reported in this subset of participants from North America are similar to those observed in the overall population of XTEND-1. Once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis provided improved bleed protection compared with prior standard-of-care prophylaxis, with improvements in physical health, pain, and joint health.

The explorer8 study (NCT04082429) evaluated the safety and efficacy of once-daily subcutaneous prophylactic concizumab in patients with hemophilia A (HA) or B (HB) without inhibitors. Additionally, explorer8 assessed patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and treatment burden. Objectives: This study aimed to compare PROs in patients with HA and HB treated with concizumab prophylaxis with PROs in those receiving no prophylaxis.\n\nMethods: The explorer8 study included male patients aged ≥12 years with HA or HB. Exploratory end points included change from baseline to week 24 in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2), Bodily Pain and Physical Functioning scores, Hemophilia Treatment Experience Measure (Hemo-TEM) total score, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Short Form v1.0 Pain Intensity score and v2.0 Upper Extremity score, and patient global impression of change on physical functioning (PGI-C). Estimated treatment differences (ETDs) were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (Hemo-TEM end points) or a mixed model for repeated measurements (all other end points). ETDs compared changes from baseline in patients on concizumab prophylaxis with those in patients on no prophylaxis.\n\nResults: At week 24, HRQoL was improved in patients receiving concizumab prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis in some, but not all, PROs. Specifically, ETDs were not statistically significant for the SF-36v2 Physical Functioning score (HA: ETD, -0.46 [95% CI, -7.59 to 6.67]; P=0.895; HB: ETD, 1.00 [95% CI, -8.30 to 10.30]; P=0.823) or the PROMIS Upper Extremity score (HA: ETD, 6.69 [95% CI, -4.00 to 17.38]; P=0.191; HB: ETD, 1.45 [95% CI, -9.64 to 12.53]; P=0.782). In the PGI-C questionnaire, patients receiving concizumab prophylaxis reported their change in physical functioning at week 24 as \"very much better\" (HA, 35.5%; HB, 35.0%), \"moderately better\" (HA, 24.2%; HB, 22.5%), \"a little better\" (HA, 16.1%, HB, 30.0%), \"no change\" (HA, 19.4%; HB, 12.5%), \"a little worse\" (HA, 3.2%), or \"very much worse\" (HA, 1.6%) since starting concizumab prophylaxis. Patients receiving no prophylaxis reported \"no change\" (HA, 100%; HB, 75%), \"very much better\" (HB, 12.5%), or \"moderately better\" (HB, 12.5%) physical functioning over the same period. For the SF-36v2 Bodily Pain score, the ETD reached statistical significance in patients with HB (ETD, 14.64 [95% CI, 3.37 to 25.91]; P=0.014) but not in patients with HA (ETD, 4.12 [95% CI, -7.12 to 15.37]; P=0.453). PROMIS Pain Intensity scores were decreased in patients on concizumab prophylaxis; however, the ETD was not significant (HA: ETD, -0.22 [95% CI, -2.73 to 2.28]; P=0.855; HB: ETD, -2.11 [95% CI, -6.05 to 1.82]; P=0.272). Treatment differences on the Hemo-TEM total score were statistically significant in patients with HA (ETD, -25.54 [95% CI, -47.49 to -3.59]; P=0.026) and HB (ETD, -14.52 [95% CI, -26.34 to -2.70]; P=0.021), indicating reduced treatment burden with concizumab prophylaxis.\n\nConclusions: Concizumab prophylaxis is associated with improvements in certain aspects of HRQoL. Concizumab is associated with lower treatment burden compared with no prophylaxis and may enhance treatment adherence.\n\n126\n\nSustained Efficacy and Safety 3 Years Following Infusion with Etranacogene Dezaparvovec in Adults with Severe or Moderately Severe Hemophilia B in the Phase 3 HOPE-B Clinical Trial\n\nSteven W.

Etranacogene dezaparvovec is the first approved gene therapy for adults with hemophilia B in the EU, US and Canada. In the HOPE-B pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03569891), etranacogene dezaparvovec demonstrated superior bleed protection compared to FIX prophylaxis up to Month 24 post-infusion. Ongoing follow-up continued from Year 2. Objectives: To report the efficacy and safety of etranacogene dezaparvovec up to Month 36 post-treatment in the HOPE-B Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\nMethods: In this open-label, single-arm, Phase 3 trial, adult male patients with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B, with or without pre-existing AAV5 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), received a single infusion of etranacogene dezaparvovec (2×1013 gc/kg) following a ≥6-month lead-in period of FIX prophylaxis.\n\nResults: Among 54 patients who received etranacogene dezaparvovec, 52 completed 36 months' follow-up. The two patients (3.7%) who did not complete this follow-up, one with the highest AAV5 NAb titer (1:3212) and one who received a partial dose (~10% of the planned dose), did not express FIX Padua and remained on FIX prophylaxis. Mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for all bleeds during Months 7-36 was reduced by 64% versus lead-in (1.52 and 4.17, respectively; P=0.0004). Mean ± SD endogenous FIX activity was sustained at 41.5±21.7 IU/dL (n=50), 36.7±19.0 IU/dL (n=50), and 38.6±17.8 IU/dL (n=48) at Years 1, 2, and 3 postâtreatment, respectively. By Year 3, 1 patient (1.9%) expressed endogenous FIX activity levels <5 IU/dL, 3 patients (5.6%) between 5-<12 IU/dL, 26 patients (48.1%) between 12-<40 IU/dL, and 18 patients (33.3%) expressed levels ≥40 IU/dL. FIX activity levels were missing/uninterpretable for 4 patients (7.4%) at Year 3; 1 patient died (unrelated to treatment), 1 patient returned to continuous FIX prophylaxis at Month 30 post-treatment following a decline of FIX levels to 2-5% and bleeding phenotype recurrence, 1 patient had a liver transplant, and 1 patient had a non-analyzable sample due to hemolysis. At Year 3 postâtreatment, 51 patients (94%) remained free of continuous FIX prophylaxis; mean annualized FIX consumption decreased by 96% versus lead-in (P<0.0001). All patients experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (AE), with no serious AEs related to treatment (1 case of hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] and 1 death were reported before Year 2). A total of 38/54 (70.4%) patients experienced 93 treatment-related AEs. The most common AE was increased alanine transaminase (ALT). Nine patients (16.7%) received reactive corticosteroids for a mean ± SD of 81.4±28.6 days. No new deaths, HCC, or late treatment-related ALT elevations were reported during Year 3.\n\nConclusions: Etranacogene dezaparvovec provides long-term FIX Padua expression, with the majority of patients expressing FIX activity levels in the mild or normal range at Year 3 postâtreatment, as well as superior bleed protection compared to FIX prophylaxis and a favorable safety profile.\n\n127\n\nA Survey of Clinician Practice Patterns on the Use of Inferior Vena Cava Filters for Venous Thromboembolism\n\nJillian Calandra1, Rahman Ladak2, Massimo Sementilli3, Alejandro Lazo-Langner2,4, Deborah Siegal5,6, Tzu-Fei Wang5,6, Rong Luo7, Andrea Cervi7\n\n1WE-SPARK Health Institute, Windsor, ON, Canada, 2Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, 3Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada, 4Lawson Health Research Institute, London, ON, Canada, 5Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada, 6Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada, 7Windsor Regional Hospital, Windsor, ON, Canada\n\nBackground: While anticoagulation remains the first line of treatment for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), use of inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) has increased in recent decades. IVCFs were designed to trap thrombus originating in lower extremity veins to prevent the development of clinically-significant PE. Data demonstrating the effectiveness of IVCFs in reducing thrombosis-related morbidity are lacking, however. While current guidelines agree that IVCFs should be considered in instances of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) and an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, details surrounding indiciations for their use vary among guideline societies which contributes to the heterogeneity in use of IVCFs in practice. Given that IVCFs may be associated with significant harm and costs, further efforts toward defining clear indications for IVCF use are needed. Objectives: As a first step toward defining best practices, we developed a survey of clinicians to characterize current IVCF use in various VTE scenarios. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate clinician use of IVCFs according to (1) acuity of VTE and absolute contraindication to anticoagulation; (2) isolaed PE without concurrent lower extremity DVT; and (3) anticoagulation failure.\n\nMethods: We conducted an online, cross-sectional survey of clinicians using Qualtrics software. The survey was publicized via emails to international organizations of hematologists, thrombosis specialists and interventional radiologists, including the Anticoagualtion Forum, Thrombosis Canada, Canadian Hematology Society (CHS), International Society on Thrombosis and Hematosis (ISTH), and the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR).\n\nResults: We received 188 survey responses in total. The majority of respondents specialize in interventional radiology (38.7%) and hematology/thrombosis (34.1%), with half practicing in an academic facility (49.6%) versus community setting. Approzimately half (53.4%) of respondents indicated having established protocols for IVCF removal post-insertion. When provided with a case of acute PE with contraindication to anticoagulation but no concurrent leg DVT, 44% responded that they would proceed with a filter as opposed to observation with serial leg ultrasounds. Most (61%) respondents would consider filter placement for a proximal leg DVT diagnosed 2-days before an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, but only 24% would proceed with a filter if the DVT was diagnosed 3-weeks earlier. In the setting of recurrent PE and acute proximal leg DVT despite therapeutic anticoagulation, 44% of clinicians would advocate for IVCF insertion. Across fictional case scenarios, thrombosis specialists/hematologists were less likely to proceed with filter insertion compared to other specialists (p=0.024). There was no impact of practice setting (i.e. academic versus community) on responses (p=0.512).\n\nConclusions: Our survey highlights the heterogeneity in the use of IVCFs in clinical practice, particularly in instances of acute PE without lower extremity DVT and anticoagulation failure. The variability in survey responses is reflective of the discrepancy that exists among current practice guidelines which contradict one another in certain settings relating to filter use, or lack clarity in other indications. Moreover, most clinical guidelines do not provide recommendation on monitoring post-IVCF insertion to optimize filter removal rates and minimize risk of complications. Futher prospective data relating to the use of IVCFs in controversial settings is warranted.\n\n130\n\nPlatelet immunophenotype induced by the Spike (S) protein and the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nAlan Cano-Mendez , Nallely Garcia-Larragoiti , Yesenia Ambriz-Murillo , Patricia Guzman-Cansino , Alejandra Ochoa-Zarzosa , Martha Eva Viveros-Sandoval\n\nUniversidad Michoacana de San NicolÃ¡s de Hidalgo, Morelia, Mexico\n\nBackground: COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected millions of people worldwide. This viral agent uses the Spike (S) protein to infect target cells. An active immunothrombotic state has been described in severe stages of infection. Platelets are cells involved in the inflammatory and thrombotic process and have been positioned as immune system sentinel cells due to their unique characteristics. Aim: To study the platelet immunophenotype induced by the complete Spike protein and the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Methodology: Blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers by venipuncture after signing an informed consent form. 3.2% sodium citrate was used as anticoagulant. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by slow centrifugation (100 g x 10 minutes). PRP was separated and resuspended in Tyrodes. Stimulation of PRP (1X107 cells/ml) with protein S and protein S receptor binding domain (RBD) [2 ug/ml] was performed for different times, 37°C. A panel of inflammatory biomarkers was analyzed by flow cytometry using the LEGENDplex Kit TM Human Thrombosis Panel Standard BioLegend® and the LEGENDplex Kit TM Human Innflammation Panel 1 Standard BioLegend® (San Diego, CA, USA) following the instructions suggested by the supplier.\n\nResults: The complete Spike protein and the RBD domain induce platelet expression of factors that contribute to the inflammatory process. We observed that cells treated with the protein secrete concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, INF- α2, IL-1B and IL-10 when compared to the expression of these factors in untreated PRP or upon stimulation with vehicle (p<0.05) and with procoagulant agonists such as ADP, epinephrine and collagen. Conclusion: Protein S and the RBD domain induce a proinflammatory phenotype in platelets, favoring the perpetuation of the immunothrombotic environment.\n\n133\n\nA Multi-Year Follow-up Study of Fidanacogene Elaparvovec Gene Therapy for Hemophilia B\n\nBenjamin J.

In a phase 1/2a study (NCT02484092), participants safely achieved therapeutic levels of FIX expression with low-dose vector administration. A long-term follow-up (LTFU) study (NCT03307980) was initiated to assess the multi-year safety and efficacy of fidanacogene elaparvovec in these participants. Objective: To report results from participants followed up to 6 years in the LTFU study. Methods: Fifteen participants with moderately severe to severe hemophilia B (FIX activity ≤2%) were treated with 5e11 vg/kg fidanacogene elaparvovec in a phase 1/2a study (1-year duration) and were then eligible to enroll in a LTFU for 5 additional years. Results: All 15 participants completed the phase 1/2a study, and 14 were enrolled in the LTFU. As of August 2023, all 14 participants completed ≥3 years of follow-up post infusion. Seven participants completed 6 years of follow-up, 2 discontinued from the study, 1 was lost to follow-up, and 4 remain ongoing in the trial. Nine serious adverse events (AEs) were reported in 4 participants; none were deemed treatment-related, and each occurred >1 year post infusion. No AE resulted in study discontinuation or death. After the first year post infusion, asymptomatic liver enzyme levels above the normal range were reported in 9 participants; none of these events were treated with corticosteroids. No liver masses or malignancies, thrombotic events, or FIX inhibitors were reported. Geometric mean FIX activity (measured with Actin-FSL one-stage assay) remained in the mild range post infusion (Table 1). Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) were low throughout the duration of follow-up (Table 2). During the LTFU, 10 participants (71%) had no bleeding events. Four participants experienced a total of 24 bleeding events (17 spontaneous, 7 traumatic). Overall, bleeding events occurred when FIX activity levels were less than ~25%. Bleeds into joints tended to be in arthropathic and/or target joints. No participant resumed FIX prophylaxis. Conclusions: Fidanacogene elaparvovec demonstrated long-term efficacy and was well tolerated over 3-6 years, reflecting the longest follow-up of participants with hemophilia B in a gene therapy trial. A phase 3 study is ongoing to further investigate these findings.\n\n134\n\nEfficacy of radiotherapy for hemostasis in tumor-related bleeding\n\nEmma P. DeLoughery , Byron Wilson , Aaron Grossberg\n\nOregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA\n\nIntroduction: Hemorrhage is a common complication of malignancy. Through invasion and angiogenesis, malignancies can produce highly vascular lesions with friable and disorganized vessels that are prone to bleeding. Bleeding symptoms are relatively common among patients with advanced cancer, and this can impact both the quality and quantity of life. Palliative radiotherapy (RT) has been associated with achieving hemostasis in a variety of bleeding malignancies, including gastric, bladder, lung, and gynecologic cancers. The goal of this study was to better determine the efficacy of radiotherapy in reducing transfusion requirements.\n\nMethods: A retrospective chart review of patients was performed after IRB approval. Patients who received palliative radiation for controlling malignancy-associated hemorrhage were included in this study. The outcome measure was change in pRBC transfusion requirements from the month prior to the month following palliative RT. Data was obtained from the institution's electronic medical record. Change in pRBCs was analyzed using Welch's t-test and bleeding recurrence was analyzed using the exact test of goodness-of-fit.\n\nResults: A total of 6002 patients were screened and 30 cases (63.3% female, average age at radiation treatment 62 years) were included in the study with RT treatment dates 2019-2023. Sixteen malignancy types were represented, with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and endometrial adenocarcinoma being the most common (both 4, 13.3%). Median radiation dose was 13 Gy (range 3-30) delivered over a median of 3.5 fractions (range 1-10). Bleeding was not noted to recur in 73.3% of the cases (P = 0.02). For those patients with recurrent bleeding, median time from RT to recurrent bleeding was 58 days (range 11-544). Transfusion requirements decreased from an average of 2.7 pRBC units over one month prior to completion of RT to 1.1 units for the month following completion of RT (P = 0.03). Median survival after completion of RT was 132 days (range 3-698). Conclusion: This study showed that radiation therapy resulted in apparent cessation of hemorrhage in over 70% of cases of hemorrhagic malignancies with a significant decrease in pRBC transfusion requirements over one month. This suggests that RT is effective in stopping hemorrhage in a variety of malignancies as well as reducing transfusion requirements. More work is needed to test this hypothesis on larger populations, as well as investigation on the mechanism by which RT results in hemostasis.\n\n135\n\nRecombinant ADAMTS13 prophylaxis in patients with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: interim analysis from the phase 3b continuation study\n\nPaul Coppo1, Parth Patwari2, BjÃ¶rn MellgÃ¥rd2, Hong Li2, Marie Scully3, Masanori Matsumoto4, Jerzy Windyga5, Thomas L Ortel6, Spero Cataland7, Paul KnÃ¶bl8, Ziqiang Yu9, Ana Antun10, Sami Ibrahimi11, Doug Criger2, Linda T Wang2\n\n1APHP.6ï¿½\"Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies (CNR-MAT), HoÌpital St Antoine, Paris, France, 2Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA, 3University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom, 4Department of Blood Transfusion Medicine, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Nara, Japan, 5Department of Hemostasis Disorders and Internal Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland, 6Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, 7Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA, 8Department of Medicine 1, Division of Hematology and Hemostasis, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, 9National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China, 10Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA, 11Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA\n\nBackground: Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) is a rare, potentially life-threatening disease resulting from severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. Burdensome prophylaxis with plasma infusions can be required to prevent acute TTP and chronic end-organ damage. Long-term prophylaxis with recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13; TAK-755; Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc., Lexington, MA, USA) is being investigated in a phase 3b continuation study. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term rADAMTS13 prophylaxis in patients with cTTP.\n\nMethods: This phase 3b, prospective, open-label, multicenter, continuation study (NCT04683003) enrolled patients with cTTP ages 0 to 70 years. Patients had previously received prophylaxis with rADAMTS13 for 12 months and standard-of-care plasma infusion for 6 months in a randomized, crossover, pivotal trial (NCT03393975; rollover cohort) or had not participated in the pivotal study (non-rollover cohort). Rollover cohort data from a preplanned interim analysis (data cutoff, August 12, 2022) are presented. Patients received intravenous rADAMTS13 40 IU/kg prophylaxis every other week or weekly. The primary outcome was long-term safety and tolerability as assessed by incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) that were considered related to rADAMTS13. Secondary outcomes included incidences of acute and subacute TTP events and nonacute TTP manifestations.\n\nResults: Data from 29 rollover patients were analyzed (mean ± SD age: 40.4 ± 12.1 years; 62% were female). The median (range) duration of rADAMTS13 treatment during the rollover period was 0.7 (0-1.4) years. No acute TTP events occurred during rADAMTS13 prophylaxis, and the incidence rates of subacute TTP events and TTP manifestations were comparable to those with rADAMTS13 prophylaxis in the pivotal study, which was lower than the previous standard of care (Table 1). With approximately 5 months of additional exposure to rADAMTS13 since the interim analysis (February 15, 2023) and data for an additional 7 rollover patients (n=36), there continued to be no related SAEs observed, no treatment interruptions or discontinuation due to AEs (Table 2), and no neutralizing antibodies observed.\n\nConclusions: In the rollover cohort of this continuation study, no adverse drug reactions were identified with rADAMTS13 prophylaxis, and no neutralizing antibodies developed. rADAMTS13 treatment that continued for up to 3.9 years prevented acute TTP events and reduced subacute events and TTP manifestations.\n\n136\n\nClinical Outcomes of Congenital Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura with and without Prophylaxis Therapy: a Multinational Chart Review Study\n\nPaul Coppo1, Marie Scully2, Johanna A Kremer Hovinga3, Maria Jose Aragon4, Parth Patwari5, Linda T Wang5, BjÃ¶rn MellgÃ¥rd5, Ragy Saad5\n\n1APHP.6ï¿½\"Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies (CNR-MAT), HoÌpital St Antoine, Paris, France, 2University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom, 3Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland, 4HCD Economics, Knutsford, United Kingdom, 5Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA\n\nBackground: Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) is an ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease. This results in the formation of platelet-rich microthrombi, leading to platelet consumption and thrombocytopenia. Current treatment strategies focus on replenishing ADAMTS13 through plasma-based therapy. Objectives: The primary study objectives were to describe the characteristics of patients with cTTP, as well as the prevalence and incidence of clinical manifestations of cTTP and its complications. The secondary objectives were to explain the treatment patterns, treatment-related outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization in patients with cTTP. Treatment patterns and treatment-related outcomes are reported here.\n\nMethods: This retrospective chart review was conducted in nine sites across Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Patient-level data were abstracted from medical records from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2020. Patients with cTTP were included if they experienced any of the following events from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2017 (index identification period): cTTP diagnosis, prophylactic or on-demand treatment for cTTP, or another cTTP-related major clinical event. Patients were followed from the date of the first qualifying event (study index date) until loss to follow-up, enrollment in a clinical trial, end of the study period, or death. Results were summarized descriptively and stratified by follow-up time periods with and without prophylaxis exposure; patients may contribute patient-time to both periods, but never concurrently. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained where applicable.\n\nResults: The study included 78 patients, with a mean (SD) follow-up of 8.1 (3.1) years. Most patients were female (78.2%), including 45 with ≥1 reported pregnancy at any time. The mean (SD) age at initial cTTP diagnosis and study index was 26.2 (17.3) years and 29.5 (15.7) years, respectively. Prophylaxis was initiated 65 times in 47 (60.3%) patients. The most common reasons for initiation were clinical symptoms and pregnancy (both n=13/47; 27.7%). The mean (SD) duration of therapy was 3.9 (4.3) years; 41 (63.1%) treatments were stopped or interrupted (Table 1). A total of 92 acute events were reported by 55 (70.5%) patients during the study (0.145 episodes per person-year [PPY]). Fewer acute events occurred during prophylaxis treatment (n=12/92; 0.050 events PPY) than when patients were not receiving prophylaxis (n=80/92; 0.202 events PPY). Most events (11/12; 91.7%) occurring during prophylaxis exposure resolved without complications, and 50% (6/12) resolved in ≤7 days. Proportionally fewer events occurring outside prophylaxis exposure periods resolved without complications (59/80; 73.8%) and resolved in ≤7 days (25/80; 31.3%). Two patients died during an acute event, one each during prophylaxis exposure and non-exposure periods.\n\nConclusions: There were fewer acute events and improved event resolution without complications during prophylaxis exposure periods. While these findings suggest the benefit of and support the use of prophylactic therapies to mitigate the substantial clinical burden of cTTP, persistent disease manifestations, despite plasma-based prophylaxis, suggest that challenges with existing treatments persist (Schraner, 2023, Blood), highlighting the need for novel therapies with demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy.\n\n137\n\nThe anticoagulated trauma patient in the wilderness\n\nEmma DeLoughery , Thomas DeLoughery\n\nOregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA\n\nBackground: Anticoagulants carry the natural risk of bleeding, leading many patients to have questions about activity limitations, particularly recreational or wilderness activities. Although it would seem that such patients would be at higher risk for poor outcome there is little data to support this theory. Therefore, this study used data from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), which provides trauma registry data from a variety of trauma centers around the United States, to analyze outcomes in the anticoagulated patient in the wilderness as compared to both their non-anticoagulated counterpart as well as the anticoagulated patient not in the wilderness.\n\nMethods: Data was obtained from the NTDB. Cohorts were identified by a 'yes' to the comorbidity of anticoagulant therapy with the trauma taking place in a wilderness/recreational setting as defined by ICD-10 codes. Two separate groups were identified - one with controls composed of non-anticoagulated patients injured in a recreational/wilderness setting (A), and one with controls of anticoagulated patients injured in a non-recreational/wilderness setting (B). Both control groups were matched on age, sex, injury severity score (ISS), and several comorbidities. Outcome measures included emergency department (ED) and hospital disposition and length of stay.\n\nResults: A total of 6411 anticoagulated trauma patients in the wilderness were found, along with 3152 in each A group and 3026 in each B group (Table 1). Cohort A had a lower ED mortality (0.1% cohort vs 0.3% control, P = 0.03) (Table 2). There was no difference in length of stay (4.9 vs 4.8 days, P = 0.4). There was no difference in hospital mortality (1.3% vs 1.1%, P = 0.38), discharge home from the hospital among survivors (73.1% vs 75.0%, P = 0.06), or discharge home from the ED (10.3% vs 9.0%, P = 0.09). Control B had increased ED mortality (0.1% vs 0.5%, P = 0.01) and increased hospital mortality (1.8% vs 5.1%, P <0.001). Cohort B had a shorter length of stay (5.0 vs 5.5 days, P <0.001). Cohort B had a higher rate of discharge home from the hospital (67.2% vs 52.6%, P <0.001). There was no difference in discharge home from the ED (10.1% vs 11.4%, P = 0.1).\n\nConclusions: This study showed similar mortality rates among anticoagulated and non-anticoagulated trauma patients in the wilderness, and lower mortality in anticoagulated patients in the wilderness compared with anticoagulated patients in other settings. Despite efforts to match for comorbidities, anticoagulated patients in the wilderness may be healthier than their non-wilderness counterparts. Limitations include use of registry data that may be incomplete, limited data availability, particularly in regards to transfusion and lab data, as well as inability to identify specific anticoagulants and possibility of inclusion of patients on anti-platelets as well as those not on anticoagulants but with bleeding disorders. Additionally, patients taking anticoagulants may avoid situations where injury is likely to occur. This study suggests that persons on anticoagulation are not at higher risk of mortality when engaging in wilderness or recreational activities though further studies are needed in this population to help better inform risk.\n\n138\n\nCHIEF: A retrospective self-control study of Children <12 with severe Hemophilia a without Inhibitors comparing Emicizumab to FVIII\n\nDaniel Mashiach1,2, Patrice Mead1, Kendall Carneiro1, Jemily Malvar1, Guy Young1,3\n\n1Childrenâs Hospital Los Angeles , Los Angeles, CA, USA, 2WesternU College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific, Pomona, CA, USA, 3Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA\n\nBackground: Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in Factor VIII (FVIII). For severe HA (SHA), prophylaxis has become the standard of care, however it imparts a high treatment burden and typically still results in an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 2-6. Emicizumab, a subcutaneously administered FVIII substitute, has become the de facto standard of care prophylaxis for children with SHA. Previous clinical trials have done ABR analyses with emicizumab in patients greater than 12 years old and in children with inhibitors to FVIII who were previously on bypassing agents, but their is limited data on emicizumab in non-inhibitor SHA children. This study aims to examine the ABR in pediatric patients who switched from FVIII to emicizumab prophylaxis. Objectives: To compare ABR, safety, costs, joint health, and physical activity of individuals <12 years old with SHA without inhibitors on FVIII prophylaxis therapy after they switch to emicizumab prophylaxis.\n\nMethods: Using a retrospective electronic medical record chart review, we conducted a self-control analysis of 15 patients less than 12 years of age during equivalent periods of factor versus emicizumab prophylaxis collecting the data stated in the objectives above.\n\nResults: The mean ABR on FVIII and emicizumab was 1.79 and 1.13, respectively, however substantially lower joint (FVIII, 0.94; emicizumab, 0.33) and spontaneous bleeds (FVIII, 0.79; emicizumab, 0.23). On FVIII, there were 74 bleeds in total for all subjects, of which 53% were mild and 47% were moderate bleeds, while on emicizumab there were 51 total bleeds, of which 51% were mild, 45% moderate, and 4% were severe bleeds. Nine administration safety events occurred to five patients while on FVIII, of which eight were due to port complications. No administration safety events were recorded for patients while administering emicizumab. The mean annual cost (based on wholesale acquisition cost) of FVIII prophylaxis was $515,340 (S.D. $199,540), compared to $328,410 (S.D. $137,230) for emicizumab prophylaxis. No notable changes in Hemophilia Joint Health Scores or physical activity were seen in patients during the duration of the study.\n\nConclusions: Emicizumab resulted in an improved ABR, especially for joint and spontaneous bleeds, had fewer administration complications, and was substantially less expensive compared to FVIII prophylaxis.\n\n139\n\nOvercoming Distance and Travel Barriers for Virginia Bleeding Disorders Treatment Centers: A Comprehensive Needs Assessment\n\nErika J Martin , Lauren C Dunn , Katherine L Bains , Janice G Kuhn\n\nVirginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA\n\nBackground: In 2020, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) contracted with Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of Virginia Bleeding Disorders Program (VBDP). VBDP provides services to patients with inherited bleeding disorders through four Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs). Significant changes in health care delivery and financing and advancements in hemophilia therapy led to the need to assess the unmet patient and family (P/F) needs, access to care and needed service adaptations. A key theme of travel and distance barriers emerged from the study findings. Objectives: To identify the unmet P/F needs and to recommend modifications in services to address changes in health care and access to care.\n\nMethods: VBDP core team and VCU's Survey and Evaluation Research Laboratory conducted four focus groups of key stakeholders identified by consumer chapter groups and three separate surveys of P/F, Virginia HTCs, and Non-VA HTCs. Questions assessed unmet P/F needs including services needed to better serve Virginia residents receiving care at HTCs, needs of residents that seek care at HTCs outside of Virginia, impact of changes in healthcare delivery systems, implications of new treatment modalities, distance, and transportation to care, access to telehealth, and outreach to unserved/underserved populations. A systematic analysis of results highlighted key findings.\n\nResults: Distance to the HTC or travel barriers was identified as a major theme. Seventy-three percent of VA HTC survey respondents identified distance to treatment was a barrier for half of their patients. Half of the HTCs provided satellite clinics. About half offered telehealth visits with physicians/nurse practitioners, social workers, and mental health providers. Challenges in telehealth visits included inability to do a complete examination (69%), lack of lab coordination (69%), lack of internet connection (50%), increased barriers for patients for whom English is not their first language (44%) and lack of smart phones (38%). Non-VA HTC respondents identified distance or geographic barriers as the main reason patients received care outside of VA. Although the respondents to the P/F survey did not identify distance to HTC as a barrier, 66% of VBDP's patients lived more than fifty miles from their HTC (Table 1). According to the focus groups, the distance between a patient and an HTC negatively influenced access to care. Participants from all groups identified rural areas in Virginia as regions that had limited or no HTC services. A statewide committee was convened for a year to create strategies to reduce distance or travel barriers. They developed a framework guide for health care providers considering a satellite clinic and collected resources to address availability of mobile devices, WIFI and language services to help patients access telehealth services. The committee presented this information at the 2023 VBDP Annual Stakeholders' meeting attended by all Virginia HTCs, VDH and local chapters. Additionally, resources were shared through the Virginia Hemophilia Foundation's webpage. Conclusion: The VBDP needs assessment identified distance and travel issues as a barrier to care. This finding led to the creation of a committee to develop strategies to reduce distance as a barrier to care.\n\n140\n\nBurden of disease and impact on quality of life in hereditary factor X deficiency patients who were diagnosed at birth: Findings from the Hereditary Factor X Deficiency in America Survey\n\nKim Clark1, Amy Wu2, Denise A. Garner2, Lorie Mody2, Jaymin Patel2, Brian Branchford3\n\n1Kedrion Biopharma, INC., Fort Lee, NJ, USA, 2AESARA, INC., Chapel Hill, NC, USA, 3Versiti Blood Research Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin, and Children's Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA\n\nBackground: Hereditary factor X deficiency (HFXD) is a rare genetic coagulation disorder leading to delayed hemostasis and potentially life-threatening bleeding. Disease burden is variable, possibly related to how early HFXD is diagnosed. Differences in burden and quality of life (QoL) related to diagnosis timing have not been well characterized. Objectives: Examine disease burden and patient-level QoL based on HFXD diagnosis timing.\n\nMethods: A prospective cross-sectional web-based survey of patients with HFXD and their caregivers was conducted. Eligible individuals were identified by Hemophilia Treatment Centers, physicians, specialty pharmacies, social media, and patient advocacy groups. The survey assessed treatment patterns, patient satisfaction with diagnostic process, bleeding events, and QoL. Patient-level disease burden was measured using the Hemophilia Well-being Index (HWBI) and Short-Form Health Survey 12 (SF-12). HWBI has a maximum score of 32 with higher scores indicating better well-being. The SF-12 is an overall QoL measure with scores ranging from 0-100 for each component (physical and mental) with lower scores related to worse QoL. Patients were stratified into groups by time of diagnosis—at birth and not at birth. Diagnosed at birth was identified based on survey response stating diagnosed at birth. Descriptive results are presented.\n\nResults: Thirty total HFXD patients were included: 13 (43.3%) were diagnosed at birth and 17 (56.7%) were diagnosed later (Table 1). Mean age at time of survey of those diagnosed a birth was 20.9 years (46.2% female, 66.7% White, and 25.0% Asian). Of those not diagnosed at birth, mean age at time of survey was 27.6 years (70.6% female, 29.4% White and 29.4% Asian); median age at diagnosis was 4.0 years (range: 4 days to 21 years). A majority of patients in the diagnosed at birth and not diagnosed at birth cohorts were on regular prophylaxis: 75.0% (n=9) and 68.8% (n=11), respectively. Of those diagnosed at birth, 38.5% (n=5) were receiving single-factor replacement (SFR) treatment while 64.7% (n=11) not diagnosed at birth were receiving SFR. However, of those diagnosed at birth and receiving SFR treatment, 80.0% (n=4) were also receiving other treatments while only 27.3% (n=3) of those not diagnosed at birth and receiving SFR treatment were also receiving other treatments. Patients diagnosed at birth (n=10) had similar overall well-being per HWBI (21, SD: 7.3) to patients diagnosed later in life (n=17) (20, SD: 10). Ten patients diagnosed at birth and 17 not diagnosed at birth completed the SF-12. Patients diagnosed at birth recorded lower mean physical and mental component scores (Table 1). Bleeding in the joints, in the muscles, and within the skull or brain were reported at a higher frequency in the diagnosed at birth cohort (Table 2).\n\nConclusions: Burden is high in patients with HFXD. Patients diagnosed at birth tended to have lower overall QoL, higher reported episodes of joint, muscle, and brain bleeding, and were more likely to be currently on multiple therapies including SFR relative to those who were not diagnosed at birth.\n\n145\n\nInvestigating inter-assay variability between DOAC calibrated anti-factor Xa assays: A substudy of the PAUSE trial\n\nRyan Baker1, Rita Selby2,3, Karen A.
