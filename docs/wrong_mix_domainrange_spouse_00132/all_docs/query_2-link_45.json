Furthermore the development of a benign proliferative lesion in the form of an intraductal papilloma from intranodal ectopic breast tissue is an extremely rare phenomenon with only three previous cases reported. This report describes an unusual and rare case of an intraductal papilloma arising in an axillary lymph node of a patient known to have the human immunodeficiency virus. A 40-year-old Black African woman underwent excision of an enlarged palpable axillary lymph node. In the preceding 7 years she had received at least six separate surgical excisions to her ipsilateral breast for papillomatosis. The last surgical intervention was performed 1 year prior to presentation with an enlarged axillary lymph node. Histological examination of her axillary lymph node revealed a papillomatous proliferative epithelial lesion within an apparent encompassing duct, resembling a mammary intraductal papilloma. In the surrounding lymphoid tissue small groups of duct-like structures were additionally noted. Immunostaining with a panel of myoepithelial markers in conjunction with oestrogen receptor produced a mixed heterogeneous staining pattern in both the papillomatous lesion and the peripheral duct-like structures. This confirmed the diagnosis of a benign intraductal papilloma within an axillary lymph node, considered to have arisen from ectopic breast tissue. This case demonstrates that intranodal ectopic breast tissue has the potential to undergo benign proliferative change albeit extremely rarely. Therefore this possibility must be considered to ensure the correct diagnosis is made. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report which has described recurrent intraductal papillomas and the subsequent development of an intraductal papilloma within an ipsilateral axillary lymph node, in\n\nIntraductal fibroadenoma under the nipple in an 11-year-old female.\n\nPubMed\n\nHayano, Fumiko; Yamada, Sohsuke; Nakano, Shigeo; Watanabe, Teruo; Sasaguri, Yasuyuki; Koga, Sunao\n\n2014-02-10\n\nRecently, Chung et al. have reported the detailed clinicopathological features of an extremely rare case sharing similar histopathological characteristics with fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumours, intraductal papillomas or ductal adenomas, given the name of intraductal fibroadenomatosis, as an unusual variant of intracanalicular fibroadenoma. Herein we demonstrated a very unusual case of intraductal fibroadenoma of the breast with admixture of components of intracanalicular type fibroadenoma or benign phyllodes tumour and a smaller amount of intraductal papilloma, occupying the one duct and some adjacent ductules, presenting as a well-demarcated nodule.\n\nIntraductal fibroadenoma under the nipple in an 11-year-old female\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRecently, Chung et al. have reported the detailed clinicopathological features of an extremely rare case sharing similar histopathological characteristics with fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumours, intraductal papillomas or ductal adenomas, given the name of intraductal fibroadenomatosis, as an unusual variant of intracanalicular fibroadenoma.

Concepts in risk stratification, including radiologic-pathologic correlation, are emerging in an effort to curb unnecessary surgeries. To this end, we examined all excised intraductal papillomas diagnosed at our institution from 2010-2015 (N = 336) and found an overall atypia rate of 20%. To investigate further, we stratified all excised papillomas according to total lesion size (range = 1-40 mm) and found that the atypia rate for lesions â¤1.2 cm (16% with atypia) was statistically significantly lower (P = .008) than the atypia rate for lesions >1.2 cm (36% with atypia). To explore to effects of radiologic-pathologic correlation on the ability of the core biopsy to accurately predict nonatypical lesions we assessed thirteen consecutive paired nonatypical core biopsy/follow-up surgical excision specimens for the percent of the total lesion (on imaging) sampled by the core biopsy (measured histologically). None of the thirteen paired specimens showed upgrade on excision (0/13); the percent of total lesion sampled by biopsy in this cohort averaged 59%. We propose that in the absence of discordant clinical/radiological findings, small lesions (â¤1.2 cm) with radiologic-pathologic concordance (>50% sampling of total lesion by core biopsy) may safely forego surgery for close clinical and radiographic follow-up.

Previously they have been classified into three subtypes: inverted ductal papilloma (IDP), sialadenoma papilliferum and intraductal papilloma. The oral inverted ductal papilloma is the least common of these lesions, with 48 cases reported to date in a search of the English-language literature. We describe an interesting case of oral IDP and highlight the pertinent clinical and histopathological features. Importantly, unlike the histologically similar inverted papilloma (IP) of the nose and paranasal sinuses, oral IDP is a completely benign lesion and is not associated with malignant change. Clinical relevance: This case report aims to raise awareness of the lesion, oral inverted ductal papilloma (IDP). We outline the clinical features and unique histopathology of oral IDP so that clinicians may correctly diagnose such a lesion and implement appropriate treatment.\n\nBreast intraductal papillomas without atypia in radiologic-pathologic concordant core-needle biopsies: Rate of upgrade to carcinoma at excision.\n\nPubMed\n\nPareja, Fresia; Corben, Adriana D; Brennan, Sandra B; Murray, Melissa P; Bowser, Zenica L; Jakate, Kiran; Sebastiano, Christopher; Morrow, Monica; Morris, Elizabeth A; Brogi, Edi\n\n2016-09-15\n\nThe surgical management of mammary intraductal papilloma without atypia (IDP) identified at core-needle biopsy (CNB) is controversial. This study assessed the rate of upgrade to carcinoma at surgical excision (EXC). This study identified women with a CNB diagnosis of intraductal papilloma without atypia or carcinoma at a cancer center between 2003 and 2013. Radiologic-pathologic concordance was assessed for all cases, and discordant cases were excluded. The radiologic and clinicopathologic features of patients with a CNB diagnosis of IDP were correlated with an upgrade to carcinoma at EXC. The study population consists of 189 women with 196 IDPs; 166 women (171 IDPs) underwent EXC. The upgrade rate was 2.3% (4 of 171). The upgraded lesions were 2 invasive lobular carcinomas and 2 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). One case of DCIS involved the residual IDP, whereas the other 3 carcinomas wereââ¥â8âmm away. Twenty-four women (25 IDPs) did not undergo EXC and had stable imaging on follow-up (median, 23.5 months). The upgrade rate at EXC for IDPs diagnosed at CNB with radiologic-pathologic concordance was 2.3%. These findings suggest that observation is appropriate for patients with radiologic-pathologic concordant CNB yielding IDP, regardless of its size. Cancer 2016. Â© 2016 American Cancer Society.

We report the case of an 11-year old girl with a complex breast lesion with hybrid features of fibroadenoma and intraductal papilloma with an early recurrence. Microscopically, the lesion was composed of dilated ducts showing intraluminal papillary projections with small to broad fibrovascular stalks. The typical leaf-like appearance of fibroadenoma was determined by the presence at the periphery of ducts compressed and distorted by the prominent stromal component. Despite its florid epithelial hyperplasia and mild cytological atypia (more evident in the relapse), immunohistochemical staining for p63 and smooth muscle actin highlighted a continuum outer myoepithelial layer, confirming the non-invasive appearance of the lesion. Two pathogenetic links have been hypothesized: one is based on the morphological continuum between these two entities, which may represent different evolutive stages in the same lesion; the other is based on epithelial/mesenchymal interactions. The possible malignant transformation of such complex lesion is also discussed, along with its differential diagnoses. The relevance of this case lies in its rarity, as well as in the therapeutic strategies related to its biological potential and to the necessity of a conservative treatment, due to the young age of the patient.

The authors report the occurrence of an intraductal papilloma in a male with more than a ten-year history of phenothiazine therapy (Mellaril and Prolixin). Phenothiazines have been demonstrated to cause elevated serum prolactin levels. The literature regarding the relationship between prolactin and mammary tumors in rodents and in humans remains controversial. The occurrence of this rare male breast tumor in the setting of chronic phenothiazine therapy raises further questions as to the role of prolactin in the development of mammary tumors.\n\nThe Management Strategy of Benign Solitary Intraductal Papilloma on Breast Core Biopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKo, Dayoung; Kang, Eunyoung; Park, So Yeon; Kim, Sun Mi; Jang, Mijung; Yun, Bo La; Chae, Sumin; Jang, Yerang; Kim, Hye Jin; Kim, Sung-Won; Kim, Eun-Kyu\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIntraductal papilloma (IDP) is well-known as one of the common benign breast lesions requiring excision. However, treatment of IDP without atypia is controversial. The aim of our study was to determine the proper management of solitary IDP by core needle biopsy (CNB). We retrospectively reviewed patients with solitary IDP confirmed by CNB from March 2003 to March 2015. We collected data about final pathology after excision, as well as clinical, histologic, and radiologic findings at initial diagnosis. The final pathology was categorized as benign or malignant. We evaluated the rate of upgrade to malignancy and factors associated with malignancy. We identified 405 patients who presented benign solitary IDP by CNB. The mean age was 46.1 years (range, 15-86 years). In total, 135 patients underwent surgical excision, and 211 underwent vacuum-assisted excision. Of 346 patients, malignant lesions were found in 8 patients (2.3%): 7 underwent surgical excision, and 1 underwent vacuum-assisted excision. Only the size of IDP was significantly associated with cancer upgrade (PÂ =Â .003). Our study shows that overall malignancy upgrade rate of benign solitary IDP after excision is very low (2.3%). Even when the size of IDP was less than 1 cm, the upgrade rate to cancer was only 0.9%. Therefore, for patients with small solitary IDP, we recommend close follow-up with ultrasound instead of excision. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study was performed to evaluate the rate of upgrading to malignancy or high-risk lesions after excision and to identify factors associated with upgrading using a large series of benign IDP cases without atypia. Methods We included patients who were diagnosed as having benign IDP without atypia on CNB and underwent surgical or vacuum-assisted excision between 2010 and 2015. We analyzed the clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of IDPs that were upgraded to malignancy or high-risk lesions after excision. Results A total of 511 benign IDPs without atypia diagnosed via CNB were identified, of which 398 cases were treated with excision. After reviewing these cases, four cases of high-risk lesions in adjacent tissue on CNB, two cases which were revealed as papilloma with atypia, and nine cases of malignancy in the same breast were excluded. In the remaining 383 cases, the rate of upgrading to malignancy and high-risk lesions after excision was 0.8% and 4.4%, respectively. The presence of concurrent contralateral breast cancer, the presence of symptoms, and multifocality were factors significantly associated with upgrading to malignancy on subsequent excision. Surgical excision rather than vacuum-assisted excision was significantly associated with upgrading to high-risk lesions or malignancy. Conclusion The rate of upgrading to malignancy for benign IDP without atypia was very low, suggesting that close clinical and radiologic observation may be sufficient for patients with benign IDP without atypia on CNB under proper settings.

A case report and literature review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSala-PÃ©rez, Sergi; EspaÃ±a-Tost, Antoni; Vidal-Bel, August\n\n2013-01-01\n\nInverted ductal papilloma of the oral cavity is an infrequent benign neoplasm of papillary appearance that originates in the secretory duct of a salivary gland. The etiology is unknown, though some authors have related it to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. We present the case of a 40-year-old woman with a tumor of the lower lip mucosa. Histopathological study of the lesion diagnosed inverted ductal papilloma of the oral cavity. Human papillomavirus DNA detection and typing based on tumor lesion DNA amplification and posterior hybridization, revealed no presence of viral DNA. The antecedents of trauma reported by the patient could have played an important role in the development of this tumor.

Although papillomas without frank cancer are benign, their management remains controversial. When a core needle biopsy of a lesion yields a diagnosis of intraductal papilloma with atypia, excision is generally recommended to rule out a concurrent malignant neoplasm. For intraductal papillomas without atypia, however, recommendations for excision versus observation are variable. The aims of this study are to evaluate the rate of concurrent malignancies for intraductal papilloma diagnosed on core needle biopsy and to assess the long-term risk of developing cancer after the diagnosis of a papillary lesion. This single institution retrospective study analyzed 259 patients that were diagnosed with intraductal papilloma (IDP) by core needle biopsy from 1995 to 2010. Patients were grouped by initial diagnosis into three groups (papilloma without atypia, papilloma with atypia, and papilloma with atypical duct hyperplasia or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ADH/ALH) and followed up for long-term outcomes. After a core needle biopsy showing IDP with atypia or IDP + ADH/ALH, surgical excision yielded a diagnosis of concomitant invasive or ductal in situ cancer in greater that 30% of cases. For intraductal papilloma without atypia, the likelihood of cancer was much lower. Moreover, even with excision, the finding of intraductal papilloma with atypia carries a significant risk of developing cancer long-term, and such patients should be followed carefully and perhaps should be considered for chemoprevention.

To compare the success of marker placement and wire localization (WL) with ductogram-guided WL. A retrospective search of radiology records identified all patients referred for ductography between January 2001 and May 2008. Results for 16 patients referred for ductogram-guided WL and 5 patients with grid coordinate marker placement at the time of ductography and subsequent WL were reviewed. Surgical pathology results and clinical follow-up were reviewed for concordance. Nine of 16 patients (56.3%) underwent successful ductogram-guided WL. Eight of nine patients had papillomas, one of which also had atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH). One of nine patients had ectatic ducts with inspisated debris. Seven patients who failed ductogram-guided WL eventually underwent open surgical biopsy. Four of seven patients had papillomas, one of which also had lobular carcinoma in situ. Remaining patients had ADH (1/7) and fibrocystic changes with chronic inflammation (3/7). All five (100%) patients with grid coordinate marker placement underwent successful WL and marker excision. Pathology results included three papillomas, papillary intraductal hyperplasia, and fibrocystic change. Grid coordinate marker placement at the time of abnormal ductogram provided an accurate method of localizing ductal abnormalities that are occult on routine workup, thus facilitating future WL. Marker placement obviated the need for repeat ductogram on the day of surgery and ensured surgical removal of the ductogram abnormality. Copyright Â© 2010 AUR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Methods Four cases of intraductal PanNETs were studied by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry with the analysis of morphologic features and review of relevant literatures. Results Two female patients and two male patients aged 41- 58 years were enrolled in this study. The chief complaint was abdominal pain in two patients,vomiting in one patient,and jaundice in the last patient. Imaging examination showed intraductal neoplasm with diagnosis as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in case 1; space-occupying lesions were found in the head of pancreas in the other three cases with pancreatic ductal ectasia and distal pancreatic atrophy. Grossly the masses were located in pancreatic main duct and invaded into surrounding pancreatic parachyma. Microscopically the tumors arranged with solid pattern,with some trabecular structures in the last two cases. Small duct and ductules were seen in intraductal PanNETs. The immunohistochemical expression showed that SYN and CgA were positive in neoplastic cells and negative in small duct and ductules.Conclusions Intraductal PanNETs are rare conditions. The clinical symptoms and imaging findings are similar to IPMN or pancreatic carcinoma. The tumors are located within pancreatic duct partly and can invade the pancreatic parenchyma. Microscopically the neuroendocrine tumors mix with small duct and forms ductulo-insular structure,which should be differentiated with mixed ductal endocrine carcinoma. The grade and prognosis are similar to those of classical neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nManagement of benign papilloma without atypia diagnosed at ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy: Scoring system for predicting malignancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhn, Soo Kyung; Han, Wonshik; Moon, Hyeong-Gon; Kim, Min Kyoon; Noh, Dong-Young; Jung, Bong-Wha; Kim, Sung-Won; Ko, Eunyoung\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe management of benign intraductal papilloma diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) remains unclear. This study was designed to evaluate factors predicting malignancy in patients diagnosed with benign papilloma without atypia at ultrasound-guided CNB and to develop a scoring system predicting malignancy based on clinical, radiological and pathological factors on further excisional biopsy. The study enrolled patients diagnosed with benign papillomas (including benign and atypical papillary lesions) at CNB. MultivariateÂ analysis was used to identify relevant clinical, radiological and pathological factors that may predict malignancy. A total of 520 CNBs were diagnosed with benign or atypical papilloma. Of these, 452 were benign papilloma without atypia. Of the 250 lesions subsequently excised surgically from 234 women, 17 (6.8%) were diagnosed with malignancy. Multivariate analysis revealed that bloody nipple discharge, size on imaging â¥15Â mm, BI-RADSâ¥4b, peripheral location and palpability were independent predictors of malignancy. A scoring system was developed based on logistic regression models and beta coefficients for each variable. The area under the ROC curve was 0.947 (95% CI: 0.913-0.981, pÂ <Â 0.001) and a negative predictive value was 100%. In a validation set of 62 patients, an area under the ROC curve was 0.926 (95% CI: 0.857-0.995, pÂ <Â 0.001). A scoring system predicting malignancy in patients diagnosed by CNB with benign papilloma without atypia was developed. This system was able to identify a subset of patients with lesions likely to be benign, indicating that imaging follow-up rather than surgical excision may be appropriate.

Cytological samples (for human papilloma virus detection) and laryngeal secretions (for immunoglobulin assessment) were obtained from 31 patients with laryngeal disease, during microscopic laryngeal surgery. On histological examination, 12 patients had squamous cell carcinoma, four had laryngeal papilloma and 15 had other benign laryngeal disease. Cytological samples were tested for human papilloma virus DNA using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay. High risk human papilloma virus DNA was detected in 25 per cent of patients (three of 12) with laryngeal cancer. Low risk human papilloma virus DNA was detected only in three laryngeal papilloma patients. The mean laryngeal secretion concentrations of immunoglobulins M, G and A and secretory immunoglobulin A in human papilloma virus DNA positive patients were more than twice those in human papilloma virus DNA negative patients. A statistically significant difference was observed between the secretory immunoglobulin A concentrations in the two groups. Patients with laryngeal cancer had higher laryngeal secretion concentrations of each immunoglobulin type, compared with patients with benign laryngeal disease. The study assessed the mean laryngeal secretion concentrations of each immunoglobulin type in the 12 laryngeal cancer patients, comparing human papilloma virus DNA positive patients (n = 3) and human papilloma virus DNA negative patients (n = 9); the mean concentrations of immunoglobulins M, G and A and secretory immunoglobulin A tended to be greater in human papilloma virus DNA positive cancer patients, compared with human papilloma virus DNA negative cancer patients. These results suggest that the local laryngeal immune response is activated by infection or carcinogenesis due to human papilloma virus. The findings strongly suggest that secretory IgA has inhibitory activity\n\nSurgical management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with main duct involvement: an international expert survey and case-vignette study.\n\nPubMed\n\nScholten, Lianne; van Huijgevoort, Nadine C M; Bruno, Marco J; Fernandez-Del Castillo, Carlos; Satoi, Sohei; Sauvanet, Alain; Wolfgang, Christopher; Fockens, Paul; Chari, Suresh T; Del Chiaro, Marco; van Hooft, Jeanin E; Besselink, Marc G\n\n2018-05-16\n\nThe risk of invasive cancer in resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with main pancreatic duct involvement is 33%-60%. Most guidelines, therefore, advise resection of main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and mixed type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in surgically fit patients, although advice on the surgical strategy (partial or total pancreatectomy) differs. We performed a survey amongst international experts to guide the design of future studies and help to prepare for a single international set of guidelines. An online survey including case vignettes was sent to 221 international experts who had published on main duct/mixed type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in the previous decade and to all surgeon and gastroenterologist members of the pancreatic cyst guideline committees of the European Study Group and the International Association of Pancreatology. Overall, 97 experts (67 surgeons, 30 gastroenterologists) from 19 countries replied (44% response rate). Most (93%) worked in an academic hospital, with a median of 15 years' experience with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm treatment. In main duct/mixed type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm patients with pancreatic duct dilation (>5 mm) in the entire pancreas, 41% (nâ¯=â¯37) advised nonoperative surveillance every 3-6 months, whereas 59% (nâ¯=â¯54) advised operative intervention. Of those who advised operative intervention, 46% (nâ¯=â¯25) would perform a total pancreatectomy and 31% (nâ¯=â¯17) pancreatoduodenectomy with follow-up. No structural differences in advice were seen between surgeons and gastroenterologists, between continents where the respondents lived, and based on years of experience. This international survey identified a clinically relevant lack of consensus in the treatment strategy in main duct/mixed type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm among experts.

Demographics, operative technique, pathology, complications, recurrence, and postoperative follow-up were evaluated. Average age at presentation was 57 years. Twenty-six patients (53%) had prior attempts at resection elsewhere, and 5 had squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) arising in an inverted papilloma. Six patients (12%) suffered major complications, including skull base osteomyelitis in 2 previously irradiated patients, cerebrospinal fluid leak with pneumocephalus (n = 1), meningitis (n = 1), invasive fungal sinusitis (n = 1), and cerebrovascular accident (n = 1). The mean disease-free interval was 29 months (range, 10-78 months). One patient with SCCA recurred in the nasopharynx (overall 2% recurrence rate). He is disease-free 3 years following endoscopic nasopharyngectomy. Three patients with SCCA had endoscopic resection of the skull base, while 1 subject with inverted papilloma pedicled on the superior orbital roof had an osteoplastic flap in conjunction with a Draf III procedure. All others received endoscopic resection. Removal of the bony pedicle resulted in excellent local control of skull base inverted papillomas. Our experience demonstrates that disease eradication with limited morbidity is attainable with this approach.

Although many investigations have been made into the nature of this disease, its etiology and causes for malignant transformation have yet to be fully elucidated. It is the authors' objective to present a review on management of the disease and evaluate the present relationship between human papilloma virus (HPV) and inverted papilloma. A causal relationship between HPV and the pathogenesis and progression of inverted papilloma has been posited since the 1980s. Although widely varied HPV detection rates have been reported, recent studies have noted a substantial increase in both recurrence and malignant transformation in HPV-infected inverted papillomas. However, exact cellular mechanisms by which infection leads to subsequent recurrence and development of carcinoma have yet to be elucidated. Evidence exists suggesting that HPV infection plays a role in the progression of inverted papilloma and confers an increased risk for recurrence and malignant transformation. PCR is the preferred detection method, and fresh or frozen specimens are the ideal source of tissue for evaluation. Although multiple studies have detected an association between HPV and inverted papilloma (both recurrent and malignant transformation), further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying molecular pathways before an association can be changed to causation.\n\nThe oncocytic subtype is genetically distinct from other pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm subtypes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBasturk, Olca; Tan, Marcus; Bhanot, Umesh; Allen, Peter; Adsay, Volkan; Scott, Sasinya N; Shah, Ronak; Berger, Michael F; Askan, Gokce; Dikoglu, Esra; Jobanputra, Vaidehi; Wrzeszczynski, Kazimierz O; Sigel, Carlie; Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine; Klimstra, David S\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn 2010, the World Health Organization reclassified the entity originally described as intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm as the âoncocytic subtypeâ of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Although several key molecular alterations of other intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm subtypes have been discovered, including common mutations in KRAS, GNAS, and RNF3, those of oncocytic subtype have not been well characterized. We analyzed 11 pancreatic âoncocytic subtypeâ of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Nine pancreatic âoncocytic subtypeâ of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms uniformly exhibited typical entity-defining morphology of arborizing papillae lined by layers of cells with oncocytic cytoplasm, prominent, nucleoli, and intraepithelial lumina. The remaining two were atypical. One lacked the arborizing papilla and had flat oncocytic epithelium only; the other one had focal oncocytic epithelium in a background of predominantly intestinal subtype intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Different components of this case were analyzed separately. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of all cases were microdissected and subjected to high-depth-targeted next-generation sequencing for a panel of 300 key cancer-associated genes in a platform that enabled the identification of sequence mutations, copy number alterations, and select structural rearrangements involving all targeted genes. Fresh frozen specimens of two cases were also subjected to whole-genome sequencing. For the nine typical pancreatic âoncocytic subtypeâ of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, the number of mutations per case, identified by next-generation sequencing, ranged from 1 to 10 (median = 4). None of these cases had KRAS or GNAS mutations and only one had both RNF43 and PIK3R1 mutations. ARHGAP26, ASXL1, EPHA8, and ERBB4 genes were somatically altered in more than one of these typical âoncocytic subtypeâ of intraductal papillary mucinous\n\nIsolated corneal papilloma-like lesion associated with human papilloma virus type 6.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Choul Yong; Kim, Eo-Jin; Choi, Jong Sun; Chuck, Roy S\n\n2011-05-01\n\nTo report a case of a corneal papilloma-like lesion associated with human papilloma virus type 6. A 48-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of ocular discomfort and gradual visual deterioration in her right eye. Ophthalmic examination revealed an elevated, semitranslucent, well-defined vascularized mass approximately 4 Ã 2.5 mm in size localized to the right cornea. The surface of the mass appeared smooth and many small, shallow, and irregular elevations were noted. An excisional biopsy was performed. The underlying cornea was markedly thinned, and fine ramifying vasculature was also noted on the exposed corneal stroma. Typical koilocytic change was observed on the histopathologic examination. Polymerase chain reaction revealed the existence of human papilloma virus type 6 DNA. Here we describe a case of an isolated corneal papilloma-like lesion. Although the corneal extension of the limbal or the conjunctival papillomas has been commonly observed, an isolated corneal papilloma-like lesion with underlying stromal destruction has only rarely been reported.\n\nIntraductal Tubulopapillary Neoplasm of the Pancreas: An Update From a Pathologist's Perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nRooney, Sarah L; Shi, Jiaqi\n\n2016-10-01\n\n-Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) is a rare intraductal epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas recently recognized as a distinct entity by the World Health Organization classification in 2010. It is defined as an intraductal, grossly visible, tubule-forming epithelial neoplasm with high-grade dysplasia and ductal differentiation without overt production of mucin. The diagnosis can be challenging owing to morphologic overlap with other intraductal lesions and its rarity. While recent advances in molecular genetic studies of ITPN have provided new tools to facilitate clinical diagnosis, the limited number of cases has yielded limited follow-up data to guide management. -To provide a clinical, pathologic, and molecular update on ITPN with respect to clinical presentation, imaging findings, histopathologic features, differential diagnosis, biological behavior, molecular characteristics, and treatment options. -Analysis of the pertinent literature (PubMed) and authors' research and clinical practice experience based on institutional and consultation materials. -Clinical presentation, imaging findings, histopathology, immunohistochemistry studies, molecular characteristics, prognosis, and treatment options of ITPN are reviewed. Important differential diagnoses with other intraductal neoplasms of the pancreas-especially intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm-using histopathologic, molecular, and immunohistochemical studies, are discussed. Despite the recent progress, more studies are necessary to assess the biology and genetics of ITPN for a better understanding of the prognostic factors and treatment options.\n\nPapilloma of lip associated with human papilloma viruses-32 infection in a child.\n\nPubMed\n\nSabeena, Sasidharanpillai; Pallade, Sadashiva Rao; Kamath, Nutan; Mathew, Mary; Arunkumar, Govindakarnavar\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSquamous papilloma is the most common benign oral epithelial lesion, and it is well known to be associated with human papilloma virus 6 and 11. Here, we report a case of squamous papilloma associated with human papilloma viruses (HPV)-32 in a 4-year-old boy who presented with a verrucous lesion on the lower lip. HPV-32 is often associated with a rare benign condition focal epithelial hyperplasia (FEH). A limited number of lesions and the absence of characteristic histology ruled out FEH in our patient. To the best of our knowledge, the association of oral squamous papilloma with HPV-32 is hitherto unreported.\n\nPharyngeal squamous cell papilloma in adult Japanese: comparison with laryngeal papilloma in clinical manifestations and HPV infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nHirai, Ryoji; Makiyama, Kiyoshi; Higuti, Yusho; Ikeda, Atsuo; Miura, Masatoshi; Hasegawa, Hisashi; Kinukawa, Noriko; Ikeda, Minoru\n\n2012-10-01\n\nA number of reports have investigated the relationship between laryngeal papilloma and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. On the other hand, it is unclear whether the HPV infection is involved in the occurrence of pharyngeal papilloma. We hypothesized that HPV infection was involved in the occurrence of pharyngeal papilloma similarly to laryngeal papilloma. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the presence of HPV infection. Furthermore, clinical manifestations of pharyngeal papilloma, which had rarely been reported, were discussed. A male-to-female ratio, solitary or multiple occurrences, and koilocytosis were examined in cases with pharyngeal papilloma. HPV DNA was examined with unfixed surgically resected specimens of pharyngeal papilloma. A screening test by the liquid-phase hybridization method was carried out for the HPV high-risk group (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and HPV low-risk group (6, 11, 42, 43, 44). As a control, 15 cases with laryngeal papilloma for which the same screening test was carried out were employed. Pharyngeal papilloma occurred as a solitary lesion more often, whereas laryngeal papilloma occurred as multiple tumors more frequently. The HPV infection rate was 0% in pharyngeal papilloma cases, which was in stark contrast with 66.7% in the HPV low-risk group in laryngeal papilloma cases. Pharyngeal papilloma occurred as a solitary lesion in females more frequently. Contrary to our hypothesis, the involvement of HPV infection was unlikely in the occurrence of pharyngeal papilloma.\n\nEffect of human papilloma virus expression on clinical course of laryngeal papilloma.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Kwang Moon; Cho, Nam Hoon; Choi, Hong Shik; Kim, Young Ho; Byeon, Hyung Kwon; Min, Hyun Jin; Kim, Se-Heon\n\n2008-10-01\n\nOur observations suggest that human papilloma virus (HPV) 6/11 is the main causative agent of laryngeal papilloma and that detection of active HPV DNA expression may be helpful in identifying patients with aggressive recurrent laryngeal papilloma. HPV is assumed to be the main causative agent of this disease. We investigated the expression of the entire genotype of HPV in cases of laryngeal papilloma and correlated their expression with the clinical course of the disease. Seventy cases of laryngeal papilloma were evaluated for the presence of the HPV genome by in situ hybridization (ISH) using wide-spectrum HPV DNA probe. Specific types of HPV infection were determined by DNA ISH using type-specific HPV DNA probes (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33). Separate analyses were conducted comparing viral types, frequency of recurrences and duration of disease-free periods. We detected HPV DNA in 40 of the 70 laryngeal papilloma cases (57%). In particular, HPV DNA was detected in 75% of the juvenile types. There were significant associations between HPV and laryngeal papilloma (p<0.01). Among the HPV-positive cases, major specific types were HPV 6/11 (97%). Significant associations were also noted between viral expression and clinical course.\n\nLOH at 16p13 is a novel chromosomal alteration detected in benign and malignant microdissected papillary neoplasms of the breast.\n\nPubMed\n\nLininger, R A; Park, W S; Man, Y G; Pham, T; MacGrogan, G; Zhuang, Z; Tavassoli, F A\n\n1998-10-01\n\nPapillary carcinoma of the breast is a variant of predominantly intraductal carcinoma characterized by a papillary growth pattern with fibrovascular support. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was evaluated at multiple chromosomal loci (including loci reported to show frequent genetic alterations in breast cancer) to determine the frequency of genetic mutations in these tumors and their precursors. Thirty-three papillary lesions of the breast (6 papillary carcinomas, 12 carcinomas arising in a papilloma, and 15 intraductal papillomas with florid epithelial hyperplasia) were retrieved from the files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). Tumor cells and normal tissue were microdissected in each case and screened for LOH at INT-2 and p53 as well as several loci on chromosome 16p13 in the TSC2/PKD1 gene region (D16S423, D16S663, D16S665). LOH on chromosome 16p13 was present in 10 of 16 (63%) informative cases of either papillary carcinoma or carcinoma arising in a papilloma as well as in 6 of 10 (60%) informative cases of intraductal papilloma with florid epithelial hyperplasia (IDH). One case showed simultaneous LOH in both the florid IDH and carcinoma components of a papilloma. LOH was not observed at either INT-2 or p53 in any of the papillary carcinomas or papillomas with florid IDH. In conclusion, a high frequency of LOH at chromosome 16p13 (the TSC2/PKD1 gene region) is in both papillary carcinomas of the breast as well as in papillomas with florid IDH, including a case with LOH present simultaneously in both components. These findings suggest that chromosome 16p contains a tumor suppressor gene that frequently is mutated early in papillary neoplasia.\n\nHuman Papilloma Virus Identification in Breast Cancer Patients with Previous Cervical Neoplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nLawson, James S; Glenn, Wendy K; Salyakina, Daria; Clay, Rosemary; Delprado, Warick; Cheerala, Bharathi; Tran, Dinh D; Ngan, Christopher C; Miyauchi, Shingo; Karim, Martha; Antonsson, Annika; Whitaker, Noel J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWomen with human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated cervical neoplasia have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than the general female population. The purpose of this study was to (i) identify high-risk HPVs in cervical neoplasia and subsequent HPV positive breast cancers which developed in the same patients and (ii) determine if these HPVs were biologically active. A range of polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical techniques were used to conduct a retrospective cohort study of cervical precancers and subsequent breast cancers in the same patients. The same high-risk HPV types were identified in both the cervical and breast specimens in 13 (46%) of 28 patients. HPV type 18 was the most prevalent. HPVs appeared to be biologically active as demonstrated by the expression of HPV E7 proteins and the presence of HPV-associated koilocytes. The average age of these patients diagnosed with breast cancer following prior cervical precancer was 51âyears, as compared to 60âyears for all women with breast cancer (p for differenceâ=â0.001). These findings indicate that high-risk HPVs can be associated with cervical neoplasia and subsequent young age breast cancer. However, these associations are unusual and are a very small proportion of breast cancers. These outcomes confirm and extend the observations of two similar previous studies and offer one explanation for the increased prevalence of serious invasive breast cancer among young women.\n\nOncocytic Type Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm of the Pancreas with Unusually Low Mucin Production Mimicking Intraductal Tubulopapillary Neoplasm: A Report of a Case Diagnosed by a Preoperative Endoscopic Biopsy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYoshida, Yukinari; Endo, Takao; Tanaka, Eiichi; Kikuchi, Takefumi; Akino, Kimishige; Mita, Hiroaki; Adachi, Yasuyo; Nakamura, Masahiro; Adachi, Yasushi; Ishii, Yoshifumi; Matsumoto, Joe; Hirano, Satoshi; Nitta, Takeo; Mitsuhashi, Tomoko; Kato, Yasuo\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe herein report the case of a 78-year-old woman with an intraductal tumor with scant mucin production in a moderately dilated main pancreatic duct that resembled an intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) on imaging. An endoscopic transpapillary forceps biopsy enabled an accurate preoperative diagnosis of the tumor as an oncocytic type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas microscopically showing papillary growth consisting of oncocytic cells with a typical mucin expression profile, although with few intraepithelial lumina containing mucin. This is the first case of an oncocytic type IPMN mimicking an ITPN that was able to be diagnosed preoperatively.

This review of the literature will consolidate the previous cases of mÃ¼llerian papilloma reported and looks for clues to differentiate the 2 entities. We provide a case report and literature review, with patients from a pediatric adolescent gynecology clinic in a tertiary center. We conducted a search of English-language publications from 1951 (the first case report) until January 2014 by using the search words \"MÃ¼llerian papilloma\" and \"prepubertal bleeding.\" References from previous published reports were also obtained for completeness. Literature review of benign mÃ¼llerian papilloma. Since 1951, 56 cases of mÃ¼llerian papilloma were reported, including 4 cases at our institution. Comorbid conditions were found in 31.5% of cases (with 3 cases associated with mesenchymal tumors). The average length of time from onset of symptoms (primarily vaginal bleeding) to diagnosis was 6.7Â months (range, 1Â day to 3Â years), with only 1 case diagnosed incidentally. Median age of presentation was 5Â years (range, 1Â day to 52Â years). Most cases were localized and resected with ease. Histology reveals complex papillary lesions without cytologic atypia. Benign mÃ¼llerian papilloma is distinguished from the more significant diagnosis of vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma by initial length of vaginal bleeding at presentation, lack of vaginal wall extension, ease of resection, and histopathology. This is compared with vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma which commonly exhibits both localized and distant spread. Copyright Â© 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

The etiology of sinonasal papilloma remains unclear, although human papilloma virus has been proposed as a major risk factor. Other etiological factors, such as anatomical variations of the nasal cavity, may be related to the pathogenesis of sinonasal papilloma, because deviated nasal septum is seen in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. We, therefore, investigated the involvement of deviated nasal septum in the development of sinonasal papilloma. Preoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging findings of 83 patients with sinonasal papilloma were evaluated retrospectively. The side of papilloma and the direction of septal deviation showed a significant correlation. Septum deviated to the intact side in 51 of 83 patients (61.4%) and to the affected side in 18 of 83 patients (21.7%). Straight or S-shaped septum was observed in 14 of 83 patients (16.9%). Even after excluding 27 patients who underwent revision surgery and 15 patients in whom the papilloma touched the concave portion of the nasal septum, the concave side of septal deviation was associated with the development of sinonasal papilloma (p = 0.040). The high incidence of sinonasal papilloma in the concave side may reflect the consequences of the traumatic effects caused by wall shear stress of the high-velocity airflow and the increased chance of inhaling viruses and pollutants. The present study supports the causative role of human papilloma virus and toxic chemicals in the occurrence of sinonasal papilloma.\n\nImmunohistochemical study on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and high-risk human papilloma virus in the malignant progression of papillomas\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Ho-Jin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjectives Papilloma frequently develops as a benign tumor of the head and neck area, but its potential for malignant transformation has yet to be studied. This study aims to provide basic information for papillomas using the immunohistochemical staining of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 and 18. Materials and Methods To evaluate the malignant transformation of papillomas, the selected tissue samples were serially diagnosed with pre-cancerous papilloma (with epithelial dysplasia, pseudo-epitheliomatous hyperplasia) or malignant lesion (squamous cell carcinoma, SCC) after the first diagnosis (squamous papilloma, inverted papilloma). The selected tissues were stained with an antibody to MMP-2 and HPV 16-E7, HPV 18-L1. A statistical analysis was performed according to each transformation step. Results The epithelial layer of papilloma and pre-cancerous papilloma lesions had a similar MMP-2 expression, but that of the malignant lesion had a significantly increased MMP-2 expression. HPV 16 and 18 infection rates were 28.6%, 33.3% and 63.6% in papillomas, pre-cancerous papilloma lesions, and SCC. Conclusions A relatively high MMP-2 expression and HPV 16 or 18 infection of papillomas may be associated with early events in the multistep processes of malignant transformation of papillomas.

A retrospective descriptive study was done. Sinonasalpapilloma data were gathered between 1999 and 2009. There were 63 available patients from the 82 cases. There were nine cases of nasal papilloma (14.3%) and 54 of inverted papilloma (85.7%). The mean age of the inverted papilloma group was higher than the nasal papilloma group (54 +/- 12.97 years vs. 42.4 +/- 24.8 years). The most common symptom was unilateral nasal obstruction. There were three cases of synchronous malignancy in the inverted papilloma and two metachronous (9.3%). Thirty-nine patients (72%) could be followed-up for more than three months. Recurrence was more common in the inverted papilloma group than nasal papilloma (37% vs. 11.1%). The 50% recurrent time of the endoscopic group was 51 weeks and the external group was 14 weeks. The recurrence of the external approach group was 1.59 times the endoscopic group. Ten surgical complications were found in eight inverted papilloma patients (16%) and included three in the endoscopic and five in the external group. Most of them were minor They were hypoesthesia and epiphora. Sinonasal inverted papilloma was common, able to recur and associated with malignancy. Though this was a limited retrospective study, it showed lower recurrence on the endoscopic approach. The life-long follow-up is needed in all cases.\n\nSinonasal inverted papilloma: From diagnosis to treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nLisan, Q; Laccourreye, O; Bonfils, P\n\n2016-11-01\n\nInverted papilloma is a rare sinonasal tumor that mainly occurs in adults during the 5th decade. Three characteristics make this tumor very different from other sinonasal tumors: a relatively strong potential for local destruction, high rate of recurrence, and a risk of carcinomatous evolution. Etiology remains little understood, but an association with human papilloma virus has been reported in up to 40% of cases, raising the suspicions of implication in the pathogenesis of inverted papilloma. Treatment of choice is surgery, by endonasal endoscopic or external approach, depending on extension and tumoral characteristics. Follow-up is critical, to diagnose local relapse, which is often early but may also be late. The seriousness of this pathology lies in its association with carcinoma, which may be diagnosed at the outset or at recurrence during follow-up. It is important to diagnose recurrence to enable early treatment, especially in case of associated carcinoma or malignancy. A comprehensive review of the international literature was performed on PubMed and Embase, using the following search-terms: \"sinonasal\" [All Fields] AND (\"papilloma, inverted\" [MeSH Terms] OR (\"papilloma\" [All Fields] AND \"inverted\" [All Fields]) OR \"inverted papilloma\" [All Fields] OR (\"inverted\" [All Fields] AND \"papilloma\" [All Fields])).

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in these lesions in South of Iran. In this cross sectional retrospective study, a total of 41 patients, 38 SNP and 3 SNP/Squamous cell carcinoma cases, from 2007 to 2014 were studied. Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA detection was performed by nested PCR method and positive cases were analyzed for high risk HPV-16 and HPV-18. HPV was detected in 31.7%; HPV- 16 in 4.9% and HPV 18 was not detected at all. Dysplastic epithelium was detected in 53% that was not associated with HPV. Three cases were accompanied with malignant transformation that HPV genome was detected in only one case and none of them were positive for HPV16 /18 genomic DNA. Current research suggests that HPV may be involved in the development of SNP. But the high risk HPV is not important in malignant transformation. More studies are needed to elucidate the possible etiologic mechanism between HPV, inverted papilloma, and squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n[Papilloma of the lacrimal sac].\n\nPubMed\n\nBurduk, PaweÅ K; Seredyka-Burduk, MaÅgorzata; KaÅºmierczak, Wojciech; Dalke, Krzysztof; MarszaÅek, Andrzej\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe benign lesions of the lacrimal sac are very rare. The most typical epithelial tumor is squamous papilloma. This tumors often present with symptoms of dacryostenosis and dacriocystitis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is known to be causative agent in the development of epithelial tumor. Lacrimal sac tumors could transform to malignant neoplasms, especially if they are developed of coexisting HPV infection. We present a patient with a squamous papilloma of the lacrimal sac and discussed the method of treatment. The patient was suffered from epiphora and recurrent dacriocystitis. An endoscopic surgery with dacriocystorhinostomy and local resection of the tumor could be an effective method of choice. The usage of a shaver for wide removal of the lacrimal sac wall is recommended to prevent local recurrence. The histopathology examination showed squamous papilloma. The patient is free of the disease over 8 months of follow up. Primary lacrimal sac papilloma require long term follow up for recurrence or malignant transformation. HPV infection could be associated with the development of lacrimal sac papillomas. Copyright Â© 2012 Polish Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Society.

It has been proposed that the expansion of pretumoral cell clones is propelled not only by the increased proliferation capacity of mutant cells, but also by active cell selection. Previous studies in Drosophila describe a clonal selection process mediated by the Flower (Fwe) protein, whereby cells that express certain Fwe isoforms are recognized and forced to undergo apoptosis. It was further shown that knock down of fwe expression in Drosophila can prevent the clonal expansion of dMyc-overexpressing pretumoral cells. Here, we study the function of the single predicted mouse homolog of Drosophila Fwe, referred to as mFwe, by clonal overexpression of mFwe isoforms in Drosophila and by analyzing mFwe knock-out mice. We show that clonal overexpression of certain mFwe isoforms in Drosophila also triggers non-autonomous cell death, suggesting that Fwe function is evolutionarily conserved. Although mFwe-deficient mice display a normal phenotype, they develop a significantly lower number of skin papillomas upon exposure to DMBA/TPA two-stage skin carcinogenesis than do treated wild-type and mFwe heterozygous mice. Furthermore, mFwe expression is higher in papillomas and the papilloma-surrounding skin of treated wild-type mice compared with the skin of untreated wild-type mice. Thus, we propose that skin papilloma cells take advantage of mFwe activity to facilitate their clonal expansion.

We wished to determine which types of adult laryngeal papilloma were clinically related to HPV infection. We hypothesized that multiple-site and recurrent papillomas would have a strong relationship to HPV and conducted the present study to test this hypothesis. Thirteen male patients with adult laryngeal papilloma who underwent resection of papilloma between August 2006 and September 2009 were studied. We examined the relationships between whether the tumor was solitary or multiple, presence or absence of recurrence after surgery, and HPV infection. High-risk HPV types (HPV-DNA types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and low-risk HPV types (6, 11, 42, 43, and 44) were tested by a liquid-phase hybridization method. In addition, HPV typing was performed for patients positive for low-risk HPV types. Twenty patients with laryngeal carcinoma or laryngeal leukoplakia were enrolled as the control group. In the laryngeal papilloma group, all patients tested were negative for high-risk HPV and 69.2% were positive for low-risk HPV. Typing performed for seven of the patients who tested positive for low-risk HPV showed that one patient was positive for HPV-11, whereas the remaining six patients were positive for HPV-6. All patients with recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis (RLP) were positive for low-risk HPV. All patients who were positive for low-risk HPV had RLP. Tumor samples from repeat operations were positive for low-risk HPV in all patients tested. HPV was not detected in the control group. The relationship between RLP and low-risk HPV was strong, with all cases that were positive for low-risk HPV showing recurrence. Tumor tissue resected at the time of repeat surgery was positive for low-risk HPV in all cases tested. Copyright Â© 2013 The Voice Foundation. Published by Mosby, Inc.

The most common cause of nipple discharge is benign breast lesions, such as solitary intraductal papilloma and papillomatosis. Nevertheless, in rare cases, a malignant cause of nipple discharge can be found. To study the diagnostic value of ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ductoscopy in patients with pathologic nipple discharge, compare their efficacy, and investigate the importance of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of intraductal pathologies. Diagnostic accuracy study. Fifty patients with pathologic nipple discharge were evaluated by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Of these, 44 ductoscopic investigations were made. The patients were classified according to magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and ductoscopy findings. A total of 25 patients, whose findings were reported as intraductal masses, underwent surgery oincluding endoscopic excision for two endoscopic excision. Findings were compared with the pathology results that were accepted as the gold standard in the description of the aetiology of nipple discharge. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography and ductoscopy findings were analysed comparatively in patients who had no surgery. Intraductal masses were reported in 26 patients, 20 of whom operated and established accurate diagnosis of 18 patients on magnetic resonance imaging. According to the ultrasonography, intraductal masses were identified in 22 patients, 17 of whom underwent surgery. Ultrasonography established accurate diagnoses in 15 patients. Intraductal mass was identified in 22 patients and ductoscopy established accurate diagnoses based on histopathologic results in 16 patients. The sensitivities of methods were 75% in ultrasonography, 90% in magnetic resonance imaging, and 94.6% in ductoscopy.

The utility of this novel imaging modality for inverted papilloma has not been previously described. This study examines the ability of otolaryngologists to differentiate between images of inverted papilloma and normal sinonasal mucosa obtained with a HRME. Inverted papilloma and normal sinonasal mucosa specimens were stained with a contrast agent, proflavine. HRME images were subsequently captured. Histopathological diagnosis was obtained for each sample. Quality-controlled images were used to assemble a training set. After reviewing the training images, 6 otolaryngologists without prior HRME experience reviewed and classified test images. Five samples of inverted papilloma and 2 normal sinonasal mucosa samples were collected. Four representative images from each specimen were used for the 28-image test set. The mean accuracy among all reviewers was 89.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.3% to 94.0%). The sensitivity to correctly identify inverted papilloma was 86.7% (95% CI, 79.2% to 92.2%), and the specificity was 92.9% (95% CI, 89.0% to 100.0%). The Fleiss kappa interrater reliability score was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.89). Inverted papilloma and normal sinonasal mucosa have distinct HRME imaging characteristics. Otolaryngologists can be successfully trained to distinguish between inverted papilloma and normal sinonasal mucosa. HRME is a feasible tool for identification of inverted papilloma. By conducting future in vivo trials, HRME potentially may enable real-time surgical margin determination during surgical excision of inverted papilloma.

Review of the literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuo, Ying-Ju; Weinreb, Ilan; Perez-Ordonez, Bayardo\n\n2013-07-01\n\nLow-grade salivary duct carcinoma (LG-SDC) is a rare neoplasm characterized by predominant intraductal growth, luminal ductal phenotype, bland microscopic features, and favorable clinical behavior with an appearance reminiscent of florid to atypical ductal hyperplasia to low grade intraductal breast carcinoma. LG-SDC is composed of multiple cysts, cribriform architecture with \"Roman Bridges\", \"pseudocribriform\" proliferations with floppy fenestrations or irregular slits, micropapillae with epithelial tufts, fibrovascular cores, and solid areas. Most of the tumor cells are small to medium sized with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, and round to oval nuclei, which may contain finely dispersed or dark condensed chromatin. Foci of intermediate to high grade atypia, and invasive carcinoma or micro-invasion have been reported in up to 23 % of cases. The neoplastic cells have a ductal phenotype with coexpression of keratins and S100 protein and are surrounded by a layer of myoepithelial cells in non-invasive cases. The main differential diagnosis of LG-SDC includes cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, sclerosing polycystic adenosis, salivary duct carcinoma in situ/high-grade intraductal carcinoma, and papillary-cystic variant of acinic cell carcinoma. There is no published data supporting the continuous classification of LG-SDC as a variant of cystadenocarcinoma. Given that most LG-SDC are non-invasive neoplasms; the terms \"cribriform cystadenocarcinoma\" and LG-SDC should be replaced by \"low-grade intraductal carcinoma\" (LG-IDC) of salivary gland or \"low-grade intraductal carcinoma with areas of invasive carcinoma\" in those cases with evidence of invasive carcinoma.\n\nPrevalence of Human Papilloma Virus in Sinonasal Papilloma in Southern Iranian Population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nValibeigi, Behnaz; Ashraf, Mohamad Javad; Kerdegari, Narges; Safai, Akbar; Abedi, Elham; Khademi, Bijan; Azarpira, Negar\n\n2017-01-01\n\nStatement of the Problem: Sinonasal papilloma (SNP) is a rare benign lesion characterized by high recurrence rate and malignant transformation. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in these lesions in South of Iran. Materials and Method: In this cross sectional retrospective study, a total of 41 patients, 38 SNP and 3 SNP/Squamous cell carcinoma cases, from 2007 to 2014 were studied. Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA detection was performed by nested PCR method and positive cases were analyzed for high risk HPV-16 and HPV-18. Results: HPV was detected in 31.7%; HPV- 16 in 4.9% and HPV 18 was not detected at all. Dysplastic epithelium was detected in 53% that was not associated with HPV. Three cases were accompanied with malignant transformation that HPV genome was detected in only one case and none of them were positive for HPV16 /18 genomic DNA. Conclusion: Current research suggests that HPV may be involved in the development of SNP. But the high risk HPV is not important in malignant transformation. More studies are needed to elucidate the possible etiologic mechanism between HPV, inverted papilloma, and squamous cell carcinoma.

Spontaneous reports from the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side effects, World Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration were collected on uveitis associated with human papilloma virus vaccination. A MEDLINE search was performed using keywords \"uveitis,\" \"iritis,\" \"iridocyclitis,\" \"human papilloma virus,\" \"Cervarix\", and \"Gardasil.\" Data garnered from spontaneous reports included the age, gender, adverse drug reaction (ADR), date of administration, concomitant administration of other vaccinations, time until onset of ADR, other systemic reactions, and dechallenge and rechallenge data. A total of 24 case reports of uveitis associated with human papilloma virus vaccination were identified, all cases were female, and the median age was 17. Median time from HPV vaccination to reported ADR was 30 days (range 0-476 days). According to World Health Organization criteria, the relationship between human papilloma virus vaccination and uveitis is \"possible.\" Causality assessments are based on the time relationship of drug administration, uveitis development and re-challenge data. Clinicians should be aware of a possible bilateral uveitis and papillitis following HPV vaccination.\n\nSimultaneous liver mucinous cystic and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the bile duct: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nBudzynska, Agnieszka; Hartleb, Marek; Nowakowska-Dulawa, Ewa; Krol, Robert; Remiszewski, Piotr; Mazurkiewicz, Michal\n\n2014-04-14\n\nCystic hepatic neoplasms are rare tumors, and are classified into two separate entities: mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the bile duct (IPMN-B). We report the case of a 56-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain and jaundice due to the presence of a large hepatic multilocular cystic tumor associated with an intraductal tumor. Partial hepatectomy with resection of extrahepatic bile ducts demonstrated an intrahepatic MCN and an intraductal IPMN-B. This is the first report of the simultaneous occurrence of these two histologically distinct entities in the liver.\n\nHuman papilloma virus prevalence in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nGungor, A; Cincik, H; Baloglu, H; Cekin, E; Dogru, S; Dursun, E\n\n2007-08-01\n\nTo determine the prevalence and type of human papilloma virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in cases of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. We analysed the prevalence of human papilloma virus infection in archived paraffin block specimens taken from 99 cases of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma between 1990 and 2005, using polymerase chain reaction techniques. Biopsy specimens from five proven verrucous skin lesions were used as positive controls, and peripheral blood samples from five healthy volunteers were used as negative controls. Four test samples were found to have inadequate deoxyribonucleic acid purity and were therefore excluded from the study. Human papilloma virus deoxyribonucleic acid was detected in seven of 95 cases of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (7.36 per cent). Human papilloma virus genotyping revealed double human papilloma virus infection in three cases and single human papilloma virus infection in the remaining four cases. The human papilloma virus genotypes detected were 6, 11 and 16 (the latter detected in only one case). In our series, a very low human papilloma virus prevalence was found among laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cases. The human papilloma virus genotypes detected were mostly 6 and/or 11, and 16 in only one case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of human papilloma virus prevalence in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, based on polymerase chain reaction genotyping in a Turkish population.\n\nSchneiderian papillomas: Comparative review of exophytic, oncocytic, and inverted types\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVira, Darshni; Suh, Jeffrey D.; Bhuta, Sunita; Wang, Marilene B.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground: Sinonasal papillomas are benign epithelial neoplasms arising from Schneiderian mucosa. The three subtypes, exophytic, oncocytic, and inverted (inverted papilloma [IP]), should be distinguished from one another histopathologically. This study (1) highlights the histopathological and clinical differences between the Schneiderian papilloma subtypes and (2) identifies clinical features that potentially predict papilloma subtypes. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of patients with Schneiderian papillomas over an 11-year period. Results: Seventy patients with sinonasal papillomas who underwent sinus surgery were identified. There were 50 (71%) male and 20 (29%) female subjects diagnosed at an average age of 53 years (range, 13â80 years). Exophytic (n = 25), oncocytic (n = 9), and IP (n = 37) were identified. IP was associated with transformation into squamous cell carcinoma in three (8%) cases and dysplasia in three (8%) cases. Neither oncocytic nor exophytic subtypes were associated with dysplasia or malignancy. On multivariate analysis of potential predictors of papilloma subtype, history of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and location of papilloma were significantly associated with papilloma subtype. Using classification and regression tree model, papilloma subtypes can be predicted based on presence or absence of CRS and papilloma location with nominal 82.4% accuracy. Conclusion: The inverted and exophytic type are the most common sinonasal papillomas, with the inverted type having an 8% rate of malignant transformation in this study. In contrast, the oncocytic type was not associated with dysplasia or malignancy in our series despite reports in the literature indicating malignant potential. History of CRS and papilloma location can provide clues to the histological subtype, which is important for surgical planning and patient counseling.

The purpose of this report is to describe the prevalence of HPV in nondysplastic, \"early inverted papilloma\" and to summarize HPV detection rates in the general population and in other HPV related neoplasia. This case series report characterizes consecutive inverted papilloma patients from January 2005 to August 2012 with regard to smoking history, dysplasia, and HPV detection rates. Presence or absence of low/high risk HPV was determined by standardized in situ hybridization DNA probes. Medline literature review was performed to determine the prevalence of HPV in inverted papilloma without moderate or severe dysplasia. Thirty-six consecutive patients were identified with an average age of 63.6 (range, 40-84) years; gender: 23 men, 13 women. More than half (55%) were active or former smokers (14% active and 41% former). High/low risk HPV was present in 1 in 36 (2.7%) patients and 1 in 36 (2.7%) had mild dysplasia. In the literature review: (1) HPV was detected in 16.4% of inverted papilloma without dysplasia; (2) oral cavity HPV detection was 4.2% to 11.4% in the normal population; and (3) HPV was normally detected in 85% to 95% of HPV-related neoplasia. Given histological features of inverted papilloma and comparatively low detection rates of HPV in inverted papilloma without dysplasia (2.7%), as well as the summary of the world literature, HPV is not related to the initial pathogenesis of inverted papilloma or inverted papilloma's tendency to persist or recur. It is postulated that since inverted papilloma is more an inflammatory polyp, it is susceptible to secondary HPV infection because of its metaplasia. Tobacco and other causes of respiratory epithelium remodeling are more plausible explanations for the initial tissue transformation to inverted papilloma.

The aim of the present study was to search for the presence of HPV in the esophageal SCP, and to genotype the detected HPV. Data from patients with definite diagnosis of SCP of the esophagus were identified from pathology records for two years period at different Hospitals. Slides from each patient were reviewed and samples with satisfactory papilloma tissues were submitted to molecular analysis. DNA has been isolated. DNA sequencing has been performed for genotyping HPV for all types. Our study group consisted of 21 women and 17 men (a total of 38 patients), mean age was 41 years (range 17-67 years). Most of the papillomas were located at mid-esophagus (68%). Eight out of 38 patients (21%) had associated erosive esophagitis, and fourteen patients (36.8%) had Helicobacter Pylori (H. pylori). Of the 38 SCP analyzed, seven (19%) were positive for HPV DNA. Three of them were of genotype 6, whereas four were of genotype 16, 18, 31, 81 that are known as highly oncogenic. There were no correlations between the presence of HPV and the patient's age, the presence of reflux esophagitis or H. pylori, smoking habit and the location of the papillomas. The presence of high-risk type HPV in esophageal SCP may implicate a role of the virus in the pathogenesis of the esophageal tumor.\n\nAssessment of the incidence of squamous cell papilloma of the esophagus and the presence of high-risk human papilloma virus.\n\nPubMed\n\nPantham, Ganesh; Ganesan, Santhi; Einstadter, Douglas; Jin, Ge; Weinberg, Aaron; Fass, Ronnie\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThere has been a recent increase in the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) associated with high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. We investigated the incidence of esophageal papilloma and the presence of high-risk HPV infection. This is a cross-sectional study conducted at a County teaching hospital. Patients with esophageal papilloma between January 2000 and December 2013 were identified. Patients with sufficient specimens were tested for the HPV virus. Sixty patients with esophageal papilloma lesions were identified from 2000 to 2013. (31 males, age 51âÂ±â13Â years). The incidence was 0.13% in 2000 and increased to 0.57% in 2013 (Pâ<â0.0001). Twenty-nine patients (48.3%) had a papilloma that was more than 5Â mm in size, and 20% had multiple lesions. The papilloma was located in the distal esophagus in 35 (58.3%) patients, mid esophagus in 17 (28.3%) patients, and proximal in 8 (13.3%) patients. Three (5%) patients had associated OPC, and 9 (47.4%) of the 19 patients tested were positive for high-risk HPV serotype 16. The incidence of esophageal papilloma has increased by fourfolds over the past 14Â years. About half of the tested patients demonstrated high risk HPV. This may suggest a potential growing risk for esophageal squamous cell cancer in the future.

Cervical cancer is an important cause of mortality, making up approximately 12% of all cancers in women. Awareness on the part of carriers of human papilloma virus is crucial in preventing transmission of the infection and protecting against cervical cancer. The study was performed as a cross-sectional descriptive study. The study consists of 79 human papilloma virus-positive women who had not been diagnosed with cervical cancer and 150 women who had not been diagnosed with human papilloma virus. Data were collected via questionnaires between November 2007 and April 2008. Percentages and chi-square test were used. A significantly higher percentage of women with positive human papilloma virus knew the definition of human papilloma virus, the fact that it is transmitted via sexual contact and that it can lead to cervical cancer than did women with negative human papilloma virus. It was established that approximately half the women with positive human papilloma virus presented at the hospital with a genital wart. None of the women knew that a Pap smear test was a necessary tool in the prevention of cervical cancer. Women with positive human papilloma virus have insufficient knowledge of human papilloma virus, sexually transmitted diseases, the health risks associated with human papilloma virus and the means of preventing these risks. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the education of health workers, and especially of nurses, on human papilloma virus and its prevention.

We specifically report a retrospective study presenting the results of percutaneous intraductal RF in patients with biliary stent occlusion. A total of 43 cases involving biliary stent obstruction were treated by placing an EndoHPB catheter and percutaneous intraductal RF was performed to clean stents. The stent patency was evaluated by cholangiography and follow-up by contrast enhanced computed tomography or ultrasound after the removal of the drainage catheter. Following the procedures, of the 43 patients, 40 survived and 3 died with a median survival of 80.5 (range: 30-243) d. One patient was lost to follow-up. One patient had the stent patent at the time of last follow-up. Two patients with stent blockage at 35 d and 44 d after procedure underwent percutaneous transhepatic drain insertion only. The levels of bilirubin before and after the procedure were 128 Â± 65 Î¼mol/L and 63 Â± 29 Î¼mol/L, respectively. There were no related complications (haemorrhage, bile duct perforation, bile leak or pancreatitis) and all patients' stent patency was confirmed by cholangiography after the procedure, with a median patency time of 107 (range: 12-180) d.

In this study, the risk of benign papilloma without atypia for subsequent breast carcinoma during follow-up was evaluated. From January 2000 to December 2010, among 39,461 women with breast ultrasonography, 37,847 women with benign papilloma on biopsy or excision, with benign diseases on biopsy, and with only ultrasonography performed were recruited. Women with concurrent or prior high-risk lesions (atypia, phyllodes tumor, or lobular neoplasm) or malignancies, or with a follow-up period of less than 12 months were excluded. The eligible 12,302 women were classified into three groups; papilloma (n = 265, patients with benign papilloma without atypia at excision), benign (n = 3,066, patients with benign results other than high risk results on core needle biopsy), and ultrasonography (n = 8,971, patients who underwent ultrasonography only without biopsy or surgery). The relative risks (RRs) of the papilloma and benign groups were calculated with intervals of 2 years using the Poisson regression analysis with age, family history, follow-up period, and breast parenchymal density being adjusted, and the ultrasonography group was used as a reference. The RR of the papilloma group was 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-9.0), significantly higher than 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.1) of the benign group. In the first 2 years, the RR of the papilloma group was 5.2 (95% CI, 2.2-12.6) but it dropped to 2.2 (95% CI, 0.5-9.2) during the next 2 years. Afterward, the RR increased over time although statistical significance was not achieved. Benign papilloma without atypia increased breast cancer risk fivefold when the ultrasonography group was used as a reference, higher than other benign lesions.

Consecutive patients referred for diagnostic or therapeutic peroral cholangioscopy were evaluated in a prospective cohort study. The patients underwent DPOC using an intraductal anchoring balloon, which was recently introduced to allow consistent access to the biliary tree with an ultraslim upper endoscope. The device was later voluntarily withdrawn from the market by the manufacturer. Fourteen patients underwent DPOC using the anchoring balloon. Biliary access with an ultraslim upper endoscope was accomplished in all 14 patients. In 12 (86%) patients, ductal access required sphincteroplasty with a 10-mm dilating balloon. Intraductal placement of the ultraslim upper endoscope allowed satisfactory visualization of the biliary mucosa to the level of the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts in 13 of 14 patients (93%). Therapeutic interventions by DPOC were successfully completed in all five attempted cases (intraductal biopsy in one and DPOC guided laser lithotripsy in four). Adverse events occurred in a patient on immunosuppressive therapy who developed an intrahepatic biloma at the site of the anchoring balloon. This required hospitalization and antibiotics. Repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 8 wk after the index procedure showed resolution of the biloma. Use of this anchoring balloon allowed consistent access to the biliary tree for performance of diagnostic and therapeutic DPOC distal to the biliary bifurcation.\n\nInverted schneiderian papilloma of the supraglottis: Case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaddawi-Konefka, Robert; Hariri, Nosaibah; Shabaik, Ahmed; Weissbrod, Philip A\n\n2017-12-01\n\nInverted schneiderian papillomas are rare benign tumors, most often arising from the sinonasal mucosa.

Epigenetic changes alter the heritable state of gene expression and chromatin organization without change in DNA sequence. We investigated whether epigenetic events of aberrant promoter hypermethylation in genes known to be involved in squamous head and neck cancer underlie the pathogenesis of sinonasal papillomas. Ten formalin-fixed paraffin DNA samples from three inverted papilloma cases, two exophytic (everted) papilloma cases, and two cases with inverted and exophytic components were studied. DNA was obtained from microdissected areas of normal and papilloma areas and examined using a panel of 41 gene probes, designed to interrogate 35 unique genes for aberrant methylation status (22 genes) using the methylation-specific multiplex-ligation-specific polymerase assay. Methylation-specific PCR was employed to confirm aberrant methylation detected by the methylation-specific multiplex-ligation-specific polymerase assay. All seven cases indicated at least one epigenetic event of aberrant promoter hypermethylation. The CDKN2B gene was a consistent target of aberrant methylation in six of seven cases. Methylation-specific PCR confirmed hypermethylation of CDKN2B. Recurrent biopsies from two inverted papilloma cases had common epigenetic events. Promoter hypermethylation of CDKN2B was a consistent epigenetic event. Common epigenetic alterations in recurrent biopsies underscore a monoclonal origin for these lesions. Epigenetic events contribute to the underlying pathogenesis of benign inverted and exophytic papillomas. As a consistent target of aberrant promoter hypermethylation, CDKN2B may serve as an important epigenetic biomarker for gene reactivation studies.\n\nTherapeutic effect of intraductal irrigation of the salivary gland: A technical report.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Chena; Kim, Jo-Eun; Huh, Kyoung-Hoe; Yi, Won-Jin; Heo, Min-Suk; Lee, Sam-Sun; Choi, Soon-Chul\n\n2017-06-01\n\nObstructive and inflammatory disease often occurs in the major salivary glands, and no predictive treatment has yet been developed for this condition. The aim of this report was to introduce an intraductal irrigation procedure and to illustrate its application to practical patient cases. Two patients complaining of pain and swelling in the parotid gland during meals who underwent sialography were diagnosed as having sialodochitis with sialadenitis. Intraductal irrigation was then performed on the parotid gland on the side of the complaint. The irrigation procedure was conducted in the same manner as the sialography procedure, except that saline was used as the filling solution. Symptom severity was evaluated with a numerical rating scale (NRS) at the initial visit and a month after the irrigation. The initial NRS value of patient 1 was 10. The value decreased to 6 and then to 0 after 2 irrigation procedures. The NRS value of patient 2 regarding the symptoms involving the left parotid gland decreased from 4-5 to 1 after 4 irrigation procedures performed at 1-month intervals. Intraductal irrigation of the salivary gland may be a simple, safe, and effective treatment option for patients with obstructive and inflammatory disease of the salivary gland that is capable of resolving their symptoms.\n\nTherapeutic effect of intraductal irrigation of the salivary gland: A technical report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Chena; Kim, Jo-Eun; Huh, Kyoung-Hoe; Yi, Won-Jin; Lee, Sam-Sun; Choi, Soon-Chul\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose Obstructive and inflammatory disease often occurs in the major salivary glands, and no predictive treatment has yet been developed for this condition.
