Overexpression of the IGF1R gene constitutes a typical feature of most human cancers. Consistent with these biological roles, cells expressing high levels of IGF1R are expected not to die, a quintessential feature of cancer cells. Tumor specific chromosomal translocations that disrupt the architecture of transcription factors are a common theme in carcinogenesis. Increasing evidence gathered over the past fifteen years demonstrate that this type of genomic rearrangements is common not only among pediatric and hematological malignancies, as classically thought, but may also provide a molecular and cytogenetic foundation for an ever-increasing portion of adult epithelial tumors. In this review article we provide evidence that the mechanism of action of oncogenic fusion proteins associated with both pediatric and adult malignancies involves transactivation of the IGF1R gene, with ensuing increases in IGF1R levels and ligand-mediated receptor phosphorylation. Disrupted transcription factors adopt the IGF1R signaling pathway and elicit their oncogenic activities via activation of this critical regulatory network. Combined targeting of oncogenic fusion proteins along with the IGF1R may constitute a promising therapeutic approach.\n\nMulti-dimensional genomic analysis of myoepithelial carcinoma identifies prevalent oncogenic gene fusions.\n\nPubMed\n\nDalin, Martin G; Katabi, Nora; Persson, Marta; Lee, Ken-Wing; Makarov, Vladimir; Desrichard, Alexis; Walsh, Logan A; West, Lyndsay; Nadeem, Zaineb; Ramaswami, Deepa; Havel, Jonathan J; Kuo, Fengshen; Chadalavada, Kalyani; Nanjangud, Gouri J; Ganly, Ian; Riaz, Nadeem; Ho, Alan L; Antonescu, Cristina R; Ghossein, Ronald; Stenman, GÃ¶ran; Chan, Timothy A; Morris, Luc G T\n\n2017-10-30\n\nMyoepithelial carcinoma (MECA) is an aggressive salivary gland cancer with largely unknown genetic features. Here we comprehensively analyze molecular alterations in 40 MECAs using integrated genomic analyses. We identify a low mutational load, and high prevalence (70%) of oncogenic gene fusions. Most fusions involve the PLAG1 oncogene, which is associated with PLAG1 overexpression. We find FGFR1-PLAG1 in seven (18%) cases, and the novel TGFBR3-PLAG1 fusion in six (15%) cases. TGFBR3-PLAG1 promotes a tumorigenic phenotype in vitro, and is absent in 723 other salivary gland tumors. Other novel PLAG1 fusions include ND4-PLAG1; a fusion between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. We also identify higher number of copy number alterations as a risk factor for recurrence, independent of tumor stage at diagnosis. Our findings indicate that MECA is a fusion-driven disease, nominate TGFBR3-PLAG1 as a hallmark of MECA, and provide a framework for future diagnostic and therapeutic research in this lethal cancer.\n\nEngineering and Functional Characterization of Fusion Genes Identifies Novel Oncogenic Drivers of Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Hengyu; Villafane, Nicole; Dogruluk, Turgut; Grzeskowiak, Caitlin L; Kong, Kathleen; Tsang, Yiu Huen; Zagorodna, Oksana; Pantazi, Angeliki; Yang, Lixing; Neill, Nicholas J; Kim, Young Won; Creighton, Chad J; Verhaak, Roel G; Mills, Gordon B; Park, Peter J; Kucherlapati, Raju; Scott, Kenneth L\n\n2017-07-01\n\nOncogenic gene fusions drive many human cancers, but tools to more quickly unravel their functional contributions are needed. Here we describe methodology permitting fusion gene construction for functional evaluation. Using this strategy, we engineered the known fusion oncogenes, BCR-ABL1, EML4-ALK , and ETV6-NTRK3, as well as 20 previously uncharacterized fusion genes identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. In addition to confirming oncogenic activity of the known fusion oncogenes engineered by our construction strategy, we validated five novel fusion genes involving MET, NTRK2 , and BRAF kinases that exhibited potent transforming activity and conferred sensitivity to FDA-approved kinase inhibitors. Our fusion construction strategy also enabled domain-function studies of BRAF fusion genes. Our results confirmed other reports that the transforming activity of BRAF fusions results from truncation-mediated loss of inhibitory domains within the N-terminus of the BRAF protein. BRAF mutations residing within this inhibitory region may provide a means for BRAF activation in cancer, therefore we leveraged the modular design of our fusion gene construction methodology to screen N-terminal domain mutations discovered in tumors that are wild-type at the BRAF mutation hotspot, V600. We identified an oncogenic mutation, F247L, whose expression robustly activated the MAPK pathway and sensitized cells to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. When applied broadly, these tools will facilitate rapid fusion gene construction for subsequent functional characterization and translation into personalized treatment strategies.

The histopathology of 28 consecutive PTCs from the northeast United States was reviewed. None of the patients (ages 6-18 years; 20 females, 8 males) had significant exposure to radiation. Nucleic acid from tumors was tested for genetic abnormalities (n = 27). Negative results were reevaluated by targeted next-generation sequencing. Seven of 27 PTCs (26%) had neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK) fusion oncogenes (NTRK type 3/ets variant 6 [NTRK3/ETV6], n =5; NTRK3/unknown, n = 1; and NTRK type 1/translocated promoter region, nuclear basket protein [NTRK1/TPR], n = 1), including 5 tumors that measured >2 cm and 3 that diffusely involved the entire thyroid or lobe. All 7 tumors had lymphatic invasion, and 5 had vascular invasion. Six of 27 PTCs (22%) had ret proto-oncogene (RET) fusions (RET/PTC1, n = 5; RET/PTC3, n = 1); 2 tumors measured >2 cm and diffusely involved the thyroid, and 5 had lymphatic invasion, with vascular invasion in 2. Thirteen PTCs had the B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) valine-to-glutamic acid mutation at position 600 (BRAF(V) (600E)) (13 of 27 tumors; 48%), 11 measured <2 cm, and 6 had lymphatic invasion (46%), with vascular invasion in 3. Fusion oncogene tumors, compared with BRAF(V) (600E) PTCs, were associated with large size (mean, 2.2 cm vs 1.5 cm, respectively; P = .05), solid and diffuse variants (11 of 13 vs 0 of 13 tumors, respectively; P < .001), and lymphovascular invasion (12 of 13 vs 6 of 13 tumors, respectively; P = .02); BRAF(V) (600E) PTCs were predominantly the classic variant (12 of 13 vs 1 of 13 tumors). Two tumors metastasized to the lung, and both had fusion oncogenes (NTRK1/TPR, n = 1; RET/PTC1, n = 1). Fusion oncogene PTC presents with more extensive disease and aggressive pathology than BRAF(V) (600E) PTC in the pediatric population.

Fusion peptides resulting from such oncogenic chimeric fusions, though unique to specific cancer subtypes, are unexplored as cancer biomarkers. Here we show, using an approach termed fusion peptide multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, the direct identification of different cancer-specific fusion peptides arising from protein chimeras that are generated from the juxtaposition of heterologous genes fused by recurrent chromosomal translocations. Using fusion peptide multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry in a clinically relevant scenario, we demonstrate the specific, sensitive, and unambiguous detection of a specific diagnostic fusion peptide in clinical samples of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, but not in a diverse array of benign lymph nodes or other forms of primary malignant lymphomas and cancer-derived cell lines. Our studies highlight the utility of fusion peptides as cancer biomarkers and carry broad implications for the use of protein biomarkers in cancer detection and monitoring.\n\nROS1 fusions rarely overlap with other oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLin, Jessica J.; Ritterhouse, Lauren L.; Ali, Siraj M.; Bailey, Mark; Schrock, Alexa B.; Gainor, Justin F.; Ferris, Lorin A.; Mino-Kenudson, Mari; Miller, Vincent A.; Iafrate, Anthony J.; Lennerz, Jochen K.; Shaw, Alice T.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIntroduction Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ROS proto-oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ROS1) define a distinct molecular subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitivity to ROS1 inhibitors. Recent reports have suggested a significant overlap between ROS1 fusions and other oncogenic driver alterations, including mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS proto-oncogene (KRAS). Methods We identified patients at our institution with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC who had undergone testing for genetic alterations in additional oncogenes, including EGFR, KRAS, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Clinicopathologic features and genetic testing results were reviewed. We also examined a separate database of ROS1-rearranged NSCLCs identified through a commercial FoundationOne assay. Results Among 62 patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC evaluated at our institution, none harbored concurrent ALK fusions (0%) or EGFR activating mutations (0%). KRAS mutations were detected in two cases (3.2%), one of which harbored a concurrent non-canonical KRAS I24N mutation of unknown biological significance. In a separate ROS1 FISH-positive case, targeted sequencing failed to confirm a ROS1 fusion, but instead identified a KRAS G13D mutation. No concurrent mutations in BRAF, ERBB2, PIK3CA, AKT1, or MAP2K1 were detected. Analysis of an independent dataset of 166 ROS1-rearranged NSCLCs identified by FoundationOne demonstrated rare cases with co-occurring driver mutations in EGFR (1/166) and KRAS (3/166), and no cases with co-occurring ROS1 and ALK rearrangements. Conclusions ROS1 rearrangements rarely overlap with alterations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, or other targetable oncogenes in NSCLC. PMID:28088512\n\nBeyond ALK-RET, ROS1 and other oncogene fusions in lung cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNakaoku, Takashi; Tsuta, Koji; Tsuchihara, Katsuya; Matsumoto, Shingo; Yoh, Kiyotaka; Goto, Koichi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFusions of the RET and ROS1 protein tyrosine kinase oncogenes with several partner genes were recently identified as new targetable genetic aberrations in cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacking activating EGFR, KRAS, ALK, BRAF, or HER2 oncogene aberrations. RET and ROS1 fusion-positive tumors are mainly observed in young, female, and/or never smoking patients. Studies based on in vitro and in vivo (i.e., mouse) models and studies of several fusion-positive patients indicate that inhibiting the kinase activity of the RET and ROS1 fusion proteins is a promising therapeutic strategy. Accordingly, there are several ongoing clinical trials aimed at examining the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against RET and ROS1 proteins in patients with fusion-positive lung cancer. Other gene fusions (NTRK1, NRG1, and FGFR1/2/3) that are targetable by existing TKIs have also been identified in NSCLCs. Options for personalized lung cancer therapy will be increased with the help of multiplex diagnosis systems able to detect multiple druggable gene fusions.

The leukemogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins is critically dependent on their direct interaction with menin, a product of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1) gene. Here we present what are to our knowledge the first small-molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL fusion protein interaction that specifically bind menin with nanomolar affinities. These compounds effectively reverse MLL fusion protein-mediated leukemic transformation by downregulating the expression of target genes required for MLL fusion protein oncogenic activity. They also selectively block proliferation and induce both apoptosis and differentiation of leukemia cells harboring MLL translocations. Identification of these compounds provides a new tool for better understanding MLL-mediated leukemogenesis and represents a new approach for studying the role of menin as an oncogenic cofactor of MLL fusion proteins. Our findings also highlight a new therapeutic strategy for aggressive leukemias with MLL rearrangements.\n\nNSD3-NUT fusion oncoprotein in NUT midline carcinoma: implications for a novel oncogenic mechanism.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrench, Christopher A; Rahman, Shaila; Walsh, Erica M; KÃ¼hnle, Simone; Grayson, Adlai R; Lemieux, Madeleine E; Grunfeld, Noam; Rubin, Brian P; Antonescu, Cristina R; Zhang, Songlin; Venkatramani, Rajkumar; Dal Cin, Paola; Howley, Peter M\n\n2014-08-01\n\nNUT midline carcinoma (NMC) is an aggressive subtype of squamous cell carcinoma that typically harbors BRD4/3-NUT fusion oncoproteins that block differentiation and maintain tumor growth. In 20% of cases, NUT is fused to uncharacterized non-BRD gene(s). We established a new patient-derived NMC cell line (1221) and demonstrated that it harbors a novel NSD3-NUT fusion oncogene. We find that NSD3-NUT is both necessary and sufficient for the blockade of differentiation and maintenance of proliferation in NMC cells. NSD3-NUT binds to BRD4, and BRD bromodomain inhibitors induce differentiation and arrest proliferation of 1221 cells. We find further that NSD3 is required for the blockade of differentiation in BRD4-NUT-expressing NMCs. These findings identify NSD3 as a novel critical oncogenic component and potential therapeutic target in NMC. The existence of a family of fusion oncogenes in squamous cell carcinoma is unprecedented, and should lead to key insights into aberrant differentiation in NMC and possibly other squamous cell carcinomas. The involvement of the NSD3 methyltransferase as a component of the NUT fusion protein oncogenic complex identifies a new potential therapeutic target.

Our current knowledge of oncogenic drivers in this specific subtype of lung cancer is largely limited compared with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). Through exon array analyses, molecular analyses and functional studies, we here identify the TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion as a novel oncogenic driver in lung SCC. We found that this gene fusion occurs exclusively in lung SCC (3.1%, 5/163), but not in lung ADC (0/119). Through mechanistic studies, we further revealed that this TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion promotes lung SCC malignant progression through regulating a SIRT6-ERK1/2-MMP1 signaling axis. We show that inhibition of ERK1/2 activation using selumetinib efficiently inhibits the growth of lung SCC with TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion expression. These findings improve our current knowledge of oncogenic drivers in lung SCC and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for lung SCC patients with TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion.

This gene rearrangement has been found in approximately half of all prostate cancers and ERG overexpression is considered as a novel diagnostic marker for prostate carcinoma. However, little is known about the role of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to test ERG expression in ovarian cancer and its potential as a diagnostic marker for ovarian carcinoma progression. A tissue microarray containing 180 ovarian cancer tissues of various pathological types and grades were examined by immunohistochemical analysis for expression of ERG. We also used 40 prostate carcinoma tissues and 40 normal tissues for comparison in parallel experiments. ERG-positive expression was detected in 40% of the prostate tumor cancer, as well as in internal positive control endothelial cells, confirming over-expression of ERG in prostate cancer at relatively the same rate observed by others. In contrast, all of the ovarian tumor patient tissues of varying histologic types were ERG-negative, despite some positivity in endothelial cells. These results suggest that the oncogenic gene fusion TMPRSS2:ERG does not occur in ovarian cancer relative to prostate cancer. Therefore, development of ERG expression profile would not be a useful diagnostic or prognostic marker for ovarian cancer patient screening.

Mutation and/or translocation of FGFRs lead to aberrant signaling that often results in developmental syndromes or cancer growth. As sequencing of human tumors becomes more frequent, so does the detection of FGFR translocations and fusion proteins. The research conducted in this article examines a frequently identified fusion protein between FGFR3 and transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3), frequently identified in glioblastoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, oral cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and cervical cancer. Using titanium dioxide-based phosphopeptide enrichment (TiO2)-liquid chromatography (LC)-high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), it was demonstrated that the fused coiled-coil TACC3 domain results in constitutive phosphorylation of key activating FGFR3 tyrosine residues. The presence of the TACC coiled-coil domain leads to increased and altered levels of FGFR3 activation, fusion protein phosphorylation, MAPK pathway activation, nuclear localization, cellular transformation, and IL3-independent proliferation. Introduction of K508R FGFR3 kinase-dead mutation abrogates these effects, except for nuclear localization which is due solely to the TACC3 domain. These results demonstrate that FGFR3 kinase activity is essential for the oncogenic effects of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein and could serve as a therapeutic target, but that phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the TACC3-derived portion are not critical for activity.

To investigate the effects of EWS-Fli1 on gene expression, we carried out DNA microarray analysis after specific knockdown of EWS-Fli1 through transfection of synthetic siRNAs. EWS-Fli1 knockdown increased expression of genes such as DKK1 and p57 that are known to be repressed by EWS-Fli1 fusion protein. Among other potential EWS-Fli1 targets identified by our microarray analysis, we have focused on the FOXO1 gene since it encodes a potential tumor suppressor and has not been previously reported in Ewing's cells. To better understand how EWS-Fli1 affects FOXO1 expression, we have established a doxycycline-inducible siRNA system to achieve stable and reversible knockdown of EWS-Fli1 in Ewing's sarcoma cells. Here we show that FOXO1 expression in Ewing's cells has an inverse relationship with EWS-Fli1 protein level, and FOXO1 promoter activity is increased after doxycycline-induced EWS-Fli1 knockdown. In addition, we have found that direct binding of EWS-Fli1 to FOXO1 promoter is attenuated after doxycycline-induced siRNA knockdown of the fusion protein. Together, these results suggest that suppression of FOXO1 function by EWS-Fli1 fusion protein may contribute to cellular transformation in Ewing's family tumors.Â«Â less\n\nAn Oncogenic NTRK Fusion in a Patient with Soft-Tissue Sarcoma with Response to the Tropomyosin-Related Kinase Inhibitor LOXO-101.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoebele, Robert C; Davis, Lara E; Vaishnavi, Aria; Le, Anh T; Estrada-Bernal, Adriana; Keysar, Stephen; Jimeno, Antonio; Varella-Garcia, Marileila; Aisner, Dara L; Li, Yali; Stephens, Philip J; Morosini, Deborah; Tuch, Brian B; Fernandes, Michele; Nanda, Nisha; Low, Jennifer A\n\n2015-10-01\n\nOncogenic TRK fusions induce cancer cell proliferation and engage critical cancer-related downstream signaling pathways. These TRK fusions occur rarely, but in a diverse spectrum of tumor histologies. LOXO-101 is an orally administered inhibitor of the TRK kinase and is highly selective only for the TRK family of receptors. Preclinical models of LOXO-101 using TRK-fusion-bearing human-derived cancer cell lines demonstrate inhibition of the fusion oncoprotein and cellular proliferation in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. The tumor of a 41-year-old woman with soft-tissue sarcoma metastatic to the lung was found to harbor an LMNA-NTRK1 gene fusion encoding a functional LMNA-TRKA fusion oncoprotein as determined by an in situ proximity ligation assay. In a phase I study of LOXO-101 (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT02122913), this patient's tumors underwent rapid and substantial tumor regression, with an accompanying improvement in pulmonary dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and plasma tumor markers. TRK fusions have been deemed putative oncogenic drivers, but their clinical significance remained unclear. A patient with a metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma with an LMNA-NTRK1 fusion had rapid and substantial tumor regression with a novel, highly selective TRK inhibitor, LOXO-101, providing the first clinical evidence of benefit from inhibiting TRK fusions.

On the other hand, various chromosomal rearrangements are more prevalent in childhood and adolescent PTCs. The aim of the present study was to identify novel rearrangements in PTCs from young patients. Among 63 postoperative specimens of childhood and adolescent PTCs, which had been discovered by the thyroid ultrasound screening program in Fukushima, nine samples without prevalent known oncogenes, BRAF V600E , RAS, RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3, and ETV6/NTRK3, were analyzed in the current study by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to screen for novel fusion genes by comparing transcript expression between extracellular and kinase domains of ALK, NTRK1, NTRK3, and RET. Of the above nine samples, five samples were suspected to harbor a fusion, and using subsequent 5' rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE), two already reported fusion oncogenes, STRN/ALK and TPR/NTRK1, and three novel fusions, SQSTM1/NTRK3, AFAP1L2/RET, and PPFIBP2/RET, were identified. Functional analyses of these three chimeric genes were performed, and their transforming abilities were confirmed through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Three novel fusion oncogenes have been identified in young PTC patients in Fukushima, suggesting that rare fusions may be present among the cases negative for known oncogenes in this age group and that such rearrangements can play a significant role in thyroid carcinogenesis.\n\nTargeted Therapies in NSCLC: Emerging oncogene targets following the success of EGFR\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBerge, Eamon M; Doebele, Robert C\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe diagnostic testing, treatment and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has undergone a paradigm shift since the discovery of sensitizing mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in a subset of NSCLC patients.

In tumors harboring the fusion gene, the duration between the onset of symptoms and the first hospital visit was significantly shorter, suggesting more rapid tumor progression. Stable expression of the fusion gene in nontransformed human dermal microvascular endothelial cells elicited a gene-expression pattern mimicking ISO-HAS cells and increased cell proliferation, an effect traced in part to NUP160 truncation. Conversely, RNAi-mediated attenuation of NUP160 in ISO-HAS cells decreased cell number. Confirming the oncogenic effects of the fusion protein, subcutaneous implantation of NUP160-SLC43A3-expressing fibroblasts induced tumors resembling human angiosarcoma. Collectively, our findings advance knowledge concerning the genetic causes of angiosarcoma, with potential implications for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Gary\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAcute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with a poor prognosis. The genetics and pathophysiology of AMKL are not well understood. We generated a knockin mouse model of the one twenty-twoâmegakaryocytic acute leukemia (OTT-MAL) fusion oncogene that results from the t(1;22)(p13;q13) translocation specifically associated with a subtype of pediatric AMKL. We report here that OTT-MAL expression deregulated transcriptional activity of the canonical Notch signaling pathway transcription factor recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin Îº J region (RBPJ) and caused abnormal fetal megakaryopoiesis. Furthermore, cooperation between OTT-MAL and an activating mutation of the thrombopoietin receptor myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) efficiently induced a short-latency AMKL that recapitulated all the features of human AMKL, including megakaryoblast hyperproliferation and maturation block, thrombocytopenia, organomegaly, and extensive fibrosis. Our results establish that concomitant activation of RBPJ (Notch signaling) and MPL (cytokine signaling) transforms cells of the megakaryocytic lineage and suggest that specific targeting of these pathways could be of therapeutic value for human AMKL.

There are growing number of evidences linking oncogenes to the induction of malignancies, especially breast cancer. Modulations of oncogenes lead to gain-of-function signals in the cells and contribute to the tumorigenic phenotype. These signals yield a large number of proteins that cause cell growth and inhibit apoptosis. Transcription factors such as STAT, p53, NF-ÎºB, c-JUN and FOXM1, are proteins that are conserved among species, accumulate in the nucleus, bind to DNA and regulate the specific genes targets. Oncogenic transcription factors resulting from the mutation or overexpression following aberrant gene expression relay the signals in the nucleus and disrupt the transcription pattern. Activation of oncogenic transcription factors is associated with control of cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and cell differentiation. Among different cancer types, breast cancer is one of top ten cancers worldwide. There are different subtypes of breast cancer cell-lines such as non-aggressive MCF-7 and aggressive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, which are identified with distinct molecular profile and different levels of oncogenic transcription factor. For instance, MDA-MB-231 carries mutated and overexpressed p53 with its abnormal, uncontrolled downstream signalling pathway that account for resistance to several anticancer drugs compared to MCF-7 cells with wild-type p53. Appropriate enough, inhibition of oncogenic transcription factors has become a potential target in discovery and development of anti-tumour drugs against breast cancer. Plants produce diverse amount of organic metabolites. Universally, these metabolites with biological activities are known as \"natural products\". The chemical structure and function of natural products have been studied since 1850s.

In general, systems that are most quantitative are also the least relevant in terms of human carcinogenesis and human risk estimation. The development of cell culture systems has made it possible to assess at the cellular level the oncogenic potential of a variety of chemical, physical and viral agents. Cell culture systems afford the opportunity to identify factors and conditions that may prevent or enhance cellular transformation by radiation and chemicals. Permissive and protective factors in radiation-induced transformation include thyroid hormone and the tumor promoter TPA that increase the transformation incidence for a given dose of radiation, and retinoids, selenium, vitamin E, and 5-aminobenzamide that inhibit the expression of transformation. Densely ionizing alpha-particles, similar to those emitted by radon daughters, are highly effective in inducing transformations and appear to interact in a supra-additive fashion with asbestos fibers. The activation of a known dominant oncogene has not yet been demonstrated in radiation-induced oncogenic transformation. The most likely mechanism for radiation activation of an oncogene would be via the production of a chromosomal translocation. Radiation also efficiently induces deletions and may thus lead to the loss of a suppressor gene. Images FIGURE 4.

Most rhabdomyosarcoma falls into one of two biologically distinct subgroups represented by alveolar or embryonal histology. The alveolar subtype harbors a translocation-mediated PAX3:FOXO1A fusion gene and has an extremely poor prognosis. However, tumor cells have heterogeneous expression for the fusion gene. Using a conditional genetic mouse model as well as human tumor cell lines, we show that that Pax3:Foxo1a expression is enriched in G2 and triggers a transcriptional program conducive to checkpoint adaptation under stress conditions such as irradiation in vitro and in vivo. Pax3:Foxo1a also tolerizes tumor cells to clinically-established chemotherapy agents and emerging molecularly-targeted agents. Thus, the surprisingly dynamic regulation of the Pax3:Foxo1a locus is a paradigm that has important implications for the way in which oncogenes are modeled in cancer cells.\n\nCell Penetrating Bispecific Antibodies for Targeting Oncogenic Transcription Factors in Advanced Prostate Cancer\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-12-01\n\nbiochemical and biologic assay systems.

However, mechanisms that differentiate the function of oncogenic ETS factors expressed in prostate tumors from non-oncogenic ETS factors expressed in normal prostate are unknown. Here, we find that four oncogenic ETS (ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5), and no other ETS, interact with the Ewing's sarcoma breakpoint protein, EWS. This EWS interaction was necessary and sufficient for oncogenic ETS functions including gene activation, cell migration, clonogenic survival, and transformation. Significantly, the EWS interacting region of ERG has no homology with that of ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. Therefore, this finding may explain how divergent ETS factors have a common oncogenic function. Strikingly, EWS is fused to various ETS factors by the chromosome translocations that cause Ewing's sarcoma. Therefore, these findings link oncogenic ETS function in both prostate cancer and Ewing's sarcoma. Copyright Â© 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Clinical and laboratory findings in this disorder are similar to those in oncogenic osteomalacia, in which tumors abundantly express FGF-23 messenger RNA, and to those in X-linked hypophosphatemia, which is caused by inactivating mutations in a phosphate-regulating endopeptidase called PHEX. Recombinant FGF-23 induces phosphaturia and hypophosphatemia in vivo, suggesting that it has a role in phosphate regulation. To determine whether FGF-23 circulates in healthy persons and whether it is elevated in those with oncogenic osteomalacia or X-linked hypophosphatemia, an immunometric assay was developed to measure it. Using affinity-purified, polyclonal antibodies against [Tyr223]FGF-23(206-222)amide and [Tyr224]FGF-23(225-244)amide, we developed a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that detects equivalently recombinant human FGF-23, the mutant form in which glutamine is substituted for arginine at position 179 (R179Q), and synthetic human FGF-23(207-244)amide. Plasma or serum samples from 147 healthy adults (mean [+/-SD] age, 48.4+/-19.6 years) and 26 healthy children (mean age, 10.9+/-5.5 years) and from 17 patients with oncogenic osteomalacia (mean age, 43.0+/-13.3 years) and 21 patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia (mean age, 34.9+/-17.2 years) were studied. Mean FGF-23 concentrations in the healthy adults and children were 55+/-50 and 69+/-36 reference units (RU) per milliliter, respectively. Four patients with oncogenic osteomalacia had concentrations ranging from 426 to 7970 RU per milliliter, which normalized after tumor resection. FGF-23 concentrations were 481+/-528 RU per milliliter in those with suspected oncogenic osteomalacia and 353+/-510 RU per milliliter (range, 31 to 2335) in those with X-linked hypophosphatemia. FGF-23 is readily detectable in the plasma or serum of healthy persons and can be markedly elevated in those with oncogenic\n\nProstate-derived Ets factor, an oncogenic driver in breast cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nSood, Ashwani K; Geradts, Joseph; Young, Jessica\n\n2017-05-01\n\nProstate-derived Ets factor (PDEF), a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, differs from other family members in its restricted expression in normal tissues and its unique DNA-binding motif. These interesting attributes coupled with its aberrant expression in cancer have rendered PDEF a focus of increasing interest by tumor biologists. This review provides a current understanding of the characteristics of PDEF expression and its role in breast cancer. The bulk of the evidence is consistent with PDEF overexpression in most breast tumors and an oncogenic role for this transcription factor in breast cancer. In addition, high PDEF expression in estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors showed significant correlation with poor overall survival in several independent cohorts of breast cancer patients. Together, these findings demonstrate PDEF to be an oncogenic driver of breast cancer and a biomarker of poor prognosis in this cancer. Based on this understanding and the limited expression of PDEF in normal human tissues, the development of PDEF-based therapeutics for prevention and treatment of breast cancer is also discussed.\n\nOncogenic KIAA1549-BRAF fusion with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in pediatric oligodendrogliomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumar, Anupam; Pathak, Pankaj; Purkait, Suvendu; Faruq, Mohammed; Jha, Prerana; Mallick, Supriya; Suri, Vaishali; Sharma, Mehar C; Suri, Ashish; Sarkar, Chitra\n\n2015-03-01\n\nPediatric oligodendrogliomas (pODGs) are rare central nervous system tumors, and comparatively little is known about their molecular pathogenesis. Co-deletion of 1p/19q; and IDH1, CIC, and FUBP1 mutations, which are molecular signatures of adult oligodendrogliomas, are extremely rare in pODGs. In this report, two pODGs, one each of grade II and grade III, were evaluated using clinical, radiological, histopathologic, and follow-up methods. IDH1, TP53, CIC, H3F3A, and BRAF-V600 E mutations were analyzed by Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemical methods, and 1p/19q co-deletion was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. PDGFRA amplification, BRAF gain, intragenic duplication of FGFR-TKD, and KIAA1549-BRAF fusion (validated by Sanger sequencing) were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Notably, both cases showed the oncogenic KIAA1549_Ex15-BRAF_Ex9 fusion transcript. Further, immunohistochemical analysis showed activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in both of these cases. However, neither 1p/19q co-deletion; IDH1, TP53, CIC, H3F3A, nor BRAF-V600 E mutation; PDGFRA amplification; BRAF gain; nor duplication of FGFR-TKD was identified. Overall, this study highlights that pODGs can harbor the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion with aberrant MAPK/ERK signaling, and there exists an option of targeting these pathways in such patients. These results indicate that pODGs with the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion may represent a subset of this rare tumor that shares molecular and genetic features of pilocytic astrocytomas. These findings will increase our understanding of pODGs and may have clinical implications. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the current study, an identical reciprocal translocation, t(11;16)(q13;p13) was identified in three chondroid lipomas, a finding consistent with previous isolated reports. A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based positional cloning strategy using a series of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probe combinations designed to narrow the 16p13 breakpoint revealed MKL2 as the candidate gene. Subsequent 5â² RACE studies demonstrated C11orf95 as the MKL2 fusion gene partner. MKL/myocardin-like 2 (MKL2) encodes myocardin-related transcription factor B (MRTF-B) in a megakaryoblastic leukemia gene family, and C11orf95 (chromosome 11 open reading frame 95) is a hypothetical protein. Sequencing analysis of RT-PCR generated transcripts from all three chondroid lipomas defined the fusion as occurring between exons 5 and 9 of C11orf95 and MKL2, respectively. Dual-color breakpoint spanning probe sets custom-designed for recognition of the translocation event in interphase cells confirmed the anticipated rearrangements of the C11orf95 and MKL2 loci in all cases. The FISH and RT-PCR assays developed in this study can serve as diagnostic adjuncts for identification of this novel C11orf95-MKL2 fusion oncogene in chondroid lipoma.

Although RET point mutation has been identified as a driver of tumorigenesis in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), no fusions have been described to date. We evaluated the role of RET fusion as an oncogenic driver in MTC. We describe a patient who died from aggressive sporadic MTC < 10 months after diagnosis. Her tumor was evaluated by means of next-generation sequencing, including an intronic capture strategy. A reciprocal translocation involving RET intron 12 was identified. The fusion was validated using a targeted break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization probe, and RNA sequencing confirmed the existence of an in-frame fusion transcript joining MYH13 exon 35 with RET exon 12. Ectopic expression of fusion product in a murine Ba/F3 cell reporter model established strong oncogenicity. Three tyrosine kinase inhibitors currently used to treat MTC in clinical practice blocked tumorigenic cell growth. This finding represents the report of a novel RET fusion, the first of its kind described in MTC. The finding of this potential novel oncogenic mechanism has clear implications for sporadic MTC, which in the majority of cases has no driver mutation identified. The presence of a RET fusion also provides a plausible target for RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.\n\nUndifferentiated Sarcomas in Children Harbor Clinically Relevant Oncogenic Fusions and Gene Copy-Number Alterations: A Report from the Children's Oncology Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaetsch, Theodore W; Roy, Angshumoy; Xu, Lin; Black, Jennifer O; Coffin, Cheryl M; Chi, Yueh-Yun; Tian, Jing; Spunt, Sheri L; Hawkins, Douglas S; Bridge, Julia A; Parsons, D Williams; Skapek, Stephen X\n\n2018-04-24\n\nPurpose: A comprehensive analysis of the genomics of undifferentiated sarcomas (UDS) is lacking. We analyzed copy-number alterations and fusion status in patients with UDS prospectively treated on Children's Oncology Group protocol ARST0332. Experimental Design: Copy-number alterations were assessed by OncoScan FFPE Express on 32 UDS. Whole-exome and transcriptome libraries from eight tumors with sufficient archived material were sequenced on HiSeq (2 Ã 100 bp). Targeted RNA-sequencing using Archer chemistry was performed on two additional cases. Results: Five-year overall survival for patients with UDS was 83% (95% CI, 69%-97%) with risk-adapted therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy). Both focal and arm-level copy-number alterations were common including gain of 1q (8/32, 25%) and loss of 1p (7/32, 22%), both of which occurred more often in clinically defined high-risk tumors. Tumors with both loss of 1p and gain of 1q carried an especially poor prognosis with a 5-year event-free survival of 20%. GISTIC analysis identified recurrent amplification of FGF1 on 5q31.3 ( q = 0.03) and loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2B on 9p21.3 ( q = 0.07). Known oncogenic fusions were identified in eight of 10 cases analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Conclusions: Pediatric UDS generally has a good outcome with risk-adapted therapy. A high-risk subset of patients whose tumors have copy-number loss of 1p and gain of 1q was identified with only 20% survival. Oncogenic fusions are common in UDS, and next-generation sequencing should be considered for children with UDS to refine the diagnosis and identify potentially targetable drivers.

M.; Urano, Takeshi; Feig, Larry A.; Toksoz, Deniz\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe human lbc oncogene product is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that specifically activates the Rho small GTP binding protein, thus resulting in biologically active, GTP-bound Rho, which in turn mediates actin cytoskeletal reorganization, gene transcription, and entry into the mitotic S phase. In order to elucidate the mechanism of onco-Lbc transformation, here we report that while proto- and onco-lbc cDNAs encode identical N-terminal dbl oncogene homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, proto-Lbc encodes a novel C terminus absent in the oncoprotein that includes a predicted Î±-helical region homologous to cyto-matrix proteins, followed by a proline-rich region. The lbc proto-oncogene maps to chromosome 15, and onco-lbc represents a fusion of the lbc proto-oncogene N terminus with a short, unrelated C-terminal sequence from chromosome 7. Both onco- and proto-Lbc can promote formation of GTP-bound Rho in vivo. Proto-Lbc transforming activity is much reduced compared to that of onco-Lbc, and a significant increase in transforming activity requires truncation of both the Î±-helical and proline-rich regions in the proto-Lbc C terminus. Deletion of the chromosome 7-derived C terminus of onco-Lbc does not destroy transforming activity, demonstrating that it is loss of the proto-Lbc C terminus, rather than gain of an unrelated C-terminus by onco-Lbc, that confers transforming activity. Mutations of onco-Lbc DH and PH domains demonstrate that both domains are necessary for full transforming activity. The proto-Lbc product localizes to the particulate (membrane) fraction, while the majority of the onco-Lbc product is cytosolic, and mutations of the PH domain do not affect this localization. The proto-Lbc C-terminus alone localizes predominantly to the particulate fraction, indicating that the C terminus may play a major role in the correct subcellular localization of proto-Lbc, thus providing a mechanism for regulating Lbc oncogenic potential.

MiRs are frequently misexpressed in cancer, with potent biological consequences. However, relatively little is known about miRs in pediatric cancers, including sarcomas. Moreover, the mechanisms behind aberrant miR expression in cancer are poorly understood. Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric malignancy driven by EWS/Ets fusion oncoproteins, which are gain-of-function transcriptional regulators. We employed stable silencing of EWS/Fli1, the most common of the oncogenic fusions, and global miR profiling to identify EWS/Fli1-regulated miRs with oncogenesis-modifying roles in Ewing sarcoma. In this report, we characterize a group of miRs (100, 125b, 22, 221/222, 27a and 29a) strongly repressed by EWS/Fli1. Strikingly, all of these miRs have predicted targets in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway, a pivotal driver of Ewing sarcoma oncogenesis. We demonstrate that miRs in this group negatively regulate the expression of multiple pro-oncogenic components of the IGF pathway, namely IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor, mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin and ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1. Consistent with tumor-suppressive functions, these miRs manifest growth inhibitory properties in Ewing sarcoma cells. Our studies thus uncover a novel oncogenic mechanism in Ewing sarcoma, involving post-transcriptional derepression of IGF signaling by the EWS/Fli1 fusion oncoprotein via miRs. This novel pathway may be amenable to innovative therapeutic targeting in Ewing sarcoma and other malignancies with activated IGF signaling.

MiRs are frequently misexpressed in cancer, with potent biological consequences. However, relatively little is known about miRs in pediatric cancers, including sarcomas. Moreover, the mechanisms behind aberrant miR expression in cancer are poorly understood.

Madan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Although gene fusions have been recognized as important drivers of cancer for decades, our understanding of the prevalence and function of gene fusions has been revolutionized by the rise of next-generation sequencing, advances in bioinformatics theory and an increasing capacity for large-scale computational biology. The computational work on gene fusions has been vastly diverse, and the present state of the literature is fragmented. It will be fruitful to merge three camps of gene fusion bioinformatics that appear to rarely cross over: (i) data-intensive computational work characterizing the molecular biology of gene fusions; (ii) development research on fusion detection tools, candidate fusion prioritization algorithms and dedicated fusion databases and (iii) clinical research that seeks to either therapeutically target fusion transcripts and proteins or leverages advances in detection tools to perform large-scale surveys of gene fusion landscapes in specific cancer types. In this review, we unify these differentâyet highly complementary and symbioticâapproaches with the view that increased synergy will catalyze advancements in gene fusion identification, characterization and significance evaluation.

A fundamental question in cancer biology is what genetic events are critical for initiation and whether these are also required for cancer progression. In recent work published in The Journal of Pathology, dependency on a fusion protein was addressed using a model of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomasÂ -Â a sarcoma subtype with frequent fusion of PAX3 and FOXO1 genes that is associated with poor outcome. PAX3-FOXO1 encodes a potent transcription factor that together with MYCN alters the transcriptional landscape of cells. Building on previous work, an inducible model in human myoblast cells was used to show that PAX3-FOXO1 and MYCN can initiate rhabdomyosarcoma development but, contrary to current thinking, tumour recurrences occasionally arose independent of the fusion protein. Further work needs to identify the molecular nature of this independence and assess any relevance in human tumours. Such functional approaches are required together with computational modeling of molecular data to unravel spatial and temporal dependencies on specific genetic events. This may support molecular prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. Copyright Â© 2017 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Here, we find that the low fusogenicity of ENTV envelope protein (Env) is not because of receptor binding, but lies in its intrinsic insensitivity to receptor-mediated triggering for fusion at low pH. Distinct from JSRV, shedding of ENTV surface (SU) subunit into culture medium was not enhanced by a soluble form of receptor, Hyal2 (sHyal2), and sHyal2 was unable to effectively inactivate the ENTV pseudovirions. Remarkably, replacing either of the two aminomoreÂ Â» acid residues, N191 or S195, located in the ENTV SU with the corresponding JSRV residues, H191 or G195, markedly increased the Env-mediated membrane fusion activity and infection. Reciprocal amino acid substitutions also partly switched the sensitivities of ENTV and JSRV pseudovirions to sHyal2-mediated SU shedding and inactivation. While N191 is responsible for an extra N-linked glycosylation of ENTV SU relative to that of JSRV, S195 possibly forms a hydrogen bond with a surrounding amino acid residue. Molecular modeling of the pre-fusion structure of JSRV Env predicts that the segment of SU that contains H191 to G195 contacts the fusion peptide and suggests that the H191N and G195S changes seen in ENTV may stabilize its pre-fusion structure against receptor priming and therefore modulate fusion activation by Hyal2. In summary, our study reveals critical determinants in the SU subunits of JSRV and ENTV Env proteins that likely regulate their local structures and thereby differential receptor-mediated fusion activation at low pH, and these findings explain, at least in part, their distinct viral infectivity.Â«Â less\n\nThe tumorigenic FGFR3-TACC3 gene fusion escapes miR-99a regulation in glioblastoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nParker, Brittany C; Annala, Matti J; Cogdell, David E; Granberg, Kirsi J; Sun, Yan; Ji, Ping; Li, Xia; Gumin, Joy; Zheng, Hong; Hu, Limei; Yli-Harja, Olli; Haapasalo, Hannu; Visakorpi, Tapio; Liu, Xiuping; Liu, Chang-Gong; Sawaya, Raymond; Fuller, Gregory N; Chen, Kexin; Lang, Frederick F; Nykter, Matti; Zhang, Wei\n\n2013-02-01\n\nFusion genes are chromosomal aberrations that are found in many cancers and can be used as prognostic markers and drug targets in clinical practice. Fusions can lead to production of oncogenic fusion proteins or to enhanced expression of oncogenes. Several recent studies have reported that some fusion genes can escape microRNA regulation via 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) deletion. We performed whole transcriptome sequencing to identify fusion genes in glioma and discovered FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in 4 of 48 glioblastoma samples from patients both of mixed European and of Asian descent, but not in any of 43 low-grade glioma samples tested. The fusion, caused by tandem duplication on 4p16.3, led to the loss of the 3'-UTR of FGFR3, blocking gene regulation of miR-99a and enhancing expression of the fusion gene. The fusion gene was mutually exclusive with EGFR, PDGFR, or MET amplification. Using cultured glioblastoma cells and a mouse xenograft model, we found that fusion protein expression promoted cell proliferation and tumor progression, while WT FGFR3 protein was not tumorigenic, even under forced overexpression. These results demonstrated that the FGFR3-TACC3 gene fusion is expressed in human cancer and generates an oncogenic protein that promotes tumorigenesis in glioblastoma.\n\nA metabolic function of FGFR3-TACC3 gene fusions in cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrattini, VÃ©ronique; Pagnotta, Stefano M; Tala; Fan, Jerry J; Russo, Marco V; Lee, Sang Bae; Garofano, Luciano; Zhang, Jing; Shi, Peiguo; Lewis, Genevieve; Sanson, Heloise; Frederick, Vanessa; Castano, Angelica M; Cerulo, Luigi; Rolland, Delphine C M; Mall, Raghvendra; Mokhtari, Karima; Elenitoba-Johnson, Kojo S J; Sanson, Marc; Huang, Xi; Ceccarelli, Michele; Lasorella, Anna; Iavarone, Antonio\n\n2018-01-11\n\nChromosomal translocations that generate in-frame oncogenic gene fusions are notable examples of the success of targeted cancer therapies. We have previously described gene fusions of FGFR3-TACC3 (F3-T3) in 3% of human glioblastoma cases. Subsequent studies have reported similar frequencies of F3-T3 in many other cancers, indicating that F3-T3 is a commonly occuring fusion across all tumour types. F3-T3 fusions are potent oncogenes that confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors, but the downstream oncogenic signalling pathways remain unknown. Here we show that human tumours with F3-T3 fusions cluster within transcriptional subgroups that are characterized by the activation of mitochondrial functions. F3-T3 activates oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and induces sensitivity to inhibitors of oxidative metabolism. Phosphorylation of the phosphopeptide PIN4 is an intermediate step in the signalling pathway of the activation of mitochondrial metabolism. The F3-T3-PIN4 axis triggers the biogenesis of peroxisomes and the synthesis of new proteins. The anabolic response converges on the PGC1Î± coactivator through the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which enables mitochondrial respiration and tumour growth. These data illustrate the oncogenic circuit engaged by F3-T3 and show that F3-T3-positive tumours rely on mitochondrial respiration, highlighting this pathway as a therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of tumours with F3-T3 fusions. We also provide insights into the genetic alterations that initiate the chain of metabolic responses that drive mitochondrial metabolism in cancer.\n\nOncogenes and tumor suppressors in the molecular pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nPandolfi, P P\n\n2001-04-01\n\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is associated with reciprocal chromosomal translocations always involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) gene on chromosome 17 and variable partner genes (X genes) on distinct chromosomes. RARalpha fuses to the PML gene in the vast majority of APL cases, and in a few cases to the PLZF, NPM, NuMA and Stat5b genes, respectively, leading to the generation of RARalpha-X: and X:-RARalpha fusion genes. Both fusion proteins can exert oncogenic functions through their ability to interfere with the activities of X and RARalpha proteins. Here, it will be discussed in detail how an extensive biochemical analysis as well as a systematic in vivo genetic approach in the mouse has allowed the definition of the multiple oncogenic activities of PML-RARalpha, and how it has become apparent that this oncoprotein is able to impair RARalpha at the transcription level and the tumor suppressive function of the PML protein.\n\nStrong expression of the neuronal transcription factor FOXP2 is linked to an increased risk of early PSA recurrence in ERG fusion-negative cancers.\n\nPubMed\n\nStumm, Laura; Burkhardt, Lia; Steurer, Stefan; Simon, Ronald; Adam, Meike; Becker, Andreas; Sauter, Guido; Minner, Sarah; Schlomm, Thorsten; Sirma, HÃ¼seyin; Michl, Uwe\n\n2013-07-01\n\nTranscription factors of the forkhead box P (FOXP1-4) family have been implicated in various human cancer types before. The relevance and role of neuronal transcription factor FOXP2 in prostate cancer is unknown. A tissue microarray containing samples from more than 11 000 prostate cancers from radical prostatectomy specimens with clinical follow-up data was analysed for FOXP2 expression by immunohistochemistry. FOXP2 data were also compared with pre-existing ERG fusion (by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry) and cell proliferation (Ki67 labelling index) data. There was a moderate to strong FOXP2 protein expression in basal and secretory cells of normal prostatic glands. As compared with normal cells, FOXP2 expression was lost or reduced in 25% of cancers. Strong FOXP2 expression was linked to advanced tumour stage, high Gleason score, presence of lymph node metastases and early tumour recurrence (p<0.0001; each) in ERG fusion-negative, but not in ERG fusion-positive cancers. High FOXP2 expression was linked to high Ki67 labelling index (p<0.0001) in all cancers irrespective of ERG fusion status. These data demonstrate that similar high FOXP2 protein levels as in normal prostate epithelium exert a 'paradoxical' oncogenic role in 'non fusion-type' prostate cancer. It may be speculated that interaction of FOXP2 with members of pathways that are specifically activated in 'non fusion-type' cancers may be responsible for this phenomenon.\n\nThe tumorigenic FGFR3-TACC3 gene fusion escapes miR-99a regulation in glioblastoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nParker, Brittany C.; Annala, Matti J.; Cogdell, David E.; Granberg, Kirsi J.; Sun, Yan; Ji, Ping; Li, Xia; Gumin, Joy; Zheng, Hong; Hu, Limei; Yli-Harja, Olli; Haapasalo, Hannu; Visakorpi, Tapio; Liu, Xiuping; Liu, Chang-gong; Sawaya, Raymond; Fuller, Gregory N.; Chen, Kexin; Lang, Frederick F.; Nykter, Matti; Zhang, Wei\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFusion genes are chromosomal aberrations that are found in many cancers and can be used as prognostic markers and drug targets in clinical practice.

Alterations of the normal function of these proteins lead to pathological processes such as developmental disorders, neoplastic transformation, and tumor metastasis. We have previously demonstrated that expression of Dbl oncogene in lens epithelial cells modulates genes encoding proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and induces angiogenesis in the lens. Our present study was undertaken to investigate the role of Dbl oncogene in epithelial cells transformation, providing new insights into carcinoma progression.To assess how Dbl oncogene can modulate EMT, cell migration, morphogenesis, and expression of pro-apoptotic and angiogenic factors we utilized bi- and 3-dimensional cultures of MCF-10 A cells. We show that upon Dbl expression MCF-10 A cells undergo EMT. In addition, we found that Dbl overexpression sustains Cdc42 and Rac activation inducing morphological alterations, characterized by the presence of lamellipodia and conferring a high migratory capacity to the cells. Moreover, Dbl expressing MCF-10 A cells form altered 3D structures and can induce angiogenesis by producing proangiogenic factors such as CCL2. These results support a role for Dbl oncogene in epithelial cell differentiation and transformation and suggest the relevance of GEF deregulation in tumor onset and progression.

The MYB-NFIB gene fusion is the main genomic hallmark and a potential therapeutic target. Oncogenic signaling pathways were studied in cultured cells and/or tumors from 15 ACC patients. Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) arrays were used to study the activity of RTKs. Effects of RTK inhibition on cell proliferation were analyzed with AlamarBlue, sphere assays, and two ACC xenograft models (nâ=â4-9 mice per group). The molecular effects of MYB-NFIB knockdown and IGF1R inhibition were studied with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and gene expression microarrays. All statistical tests were two-sided. The MYB-NFIB fusion drives proliferation of ACC cells and is crucial for spherogenesis. Intriguingly, the fusion is regulated through AKT-dependent signaling induced by IGF1R overexpression and is downregulated upon IGF1R-inhibition (% expression of control Â± SDâ=â27.2 Â± 1.3, P < .001). MYB-NFIB regulates genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA replication/repair, and RNA processing. The transcriptional program induced by MYB-NFIB affects critical oncogenic mediators normally controlled by MYC and is reversed by pharmacological inhibition of IGF1R. Co-activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MET promoted proliferation of ACC cells, and combined targeting of IGFR1/EGFR/MET induced differentiation and synergistically inhibited the growth of patient-derived xenografted ACCs (ACCX5M1, % growth of control Â± SDâ=â34.9 Â± 20.3, P = .006; ACCX6, % growth of control Â± SDâ=â24.1 Â± 17.5, P = .04). MYB-NFIB is an oncogenic driver and a key therapeutic target in ACC that is regulated by AKT-dependent IGF1R signaling. Our studies uncover a new strategy to target an oncogenic transcriptional master regulator and provide new important insights into the biology and treatment of ACC.

In this study we have investigated several factors contributing to this phenomenon, including the effects of (i) polymer vesicle concentration, (ii) agitation speed and duration, and iii) variation of the salt and its concentration. It was found that increasing the concentration of the polymer dramatically increases the production of giant vesicles through the increased collisions of polymersomes. Our investigations also found that increasing the frequency of agitation increased the efficiency of fusion, though ultimately limited the sizemoreÂ Â» of vesicle which could be produced due to the high shear involved. Finally it was determined that salt-mediation of the fusion process was not limited to NaCl, but is instead a general effect facilitated by the presence of solvated ionic compounds, albeit with different salts initiating fusion at different concentration.Â«Â less\n\nThe homeodomain transcription factor Cdx1 does not behave as an oncogene in normal mouse intestine.\n\nPubMed\n\nCrissey, Mary Ann S; Guo, Rong-Jun; Fogt, Franz; Li, Hong; Katz, Jonathan P; Silberg, Debra G; Suh, Eun Ran; Lynch, John P\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe Caudal-related homeobox genes Cdx1 and Cdx2 are intestine-specific transcription factors that regulate differentiation of intestinal cell types. Previously, we have shown Cdx1 to be antiproliferative and to promote cell differentiation. However, other studies have suggested that Cdx1 may be an oncogene. To test for oncogenic behavior, we used the murine villin promoter to ectopically express Cdx1 in the small intestinal villi and colonic surface epithelium. No changes in intestinal architecture, cell differentiation, or lineage selection were observed with expression of the transgene. Classic oncogenes enhance proliferation and induce tumors when ectopically expressed. However, the Cdx1 transgene neither altered intestinal proliferation nor induced spontaneous intestinal tumors. In a murine model for colitis-associated cancer, the Cdx1 transgene decreased, rather than increased, the number of adenomas that developed. In the polyps, the expression of the endogenous and the transgenic Cdx1 proteins was largely absent, whereas endogenous Villin expression was retained. This suggests that transgene silencing was specific and not due to a general Villin inactivation. In conclusion, neither the ectopic expression of Cdx1 was associated with changes in intestinal cell proliferation or differentiation nor was there increased intestinal cancer susceptibility. Our results therefore suggest that Cdx1 is not an oncogene in normal intestinal epithelium.\n\nThe Oncogenic Fusion Proteins SET-Nup214 and Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1)-Nup214 Form Dynamic Nuclear Bodies and Differentially Affect Nuclear Protein and Poly(A)+ RNA Export.\n\nPubMed\n\nPort, Sarah A; Mendes, AdÃ©lia; Valkova, Christina; Spillner, Christiane; Fahrenkrog, Birthe; Kaether, Christoph; Kehlenbach, Ralph H\n\n2016-10-28\n\nGenetic rearrangements are a hallmark of several forms of leukemia and can lead to oncogenic fusion proteins. One example of an affected chromosomal region is the gene coding for Nup214, a nucleoporin that localizes to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We investigated two such fusion proteins, SET-Nup214 and SQSTM1 (sequestosome)-Nup214, both containing C-terminal portions of Nup214. SET-Nup214 nuclear bodies containing the nuclear export receptor CRM1 were observed in the leukemia cell lines LOUCY and MEGAL. Overexpression of SET-Nup214 in HeLa cells leads to the formation of similar nuclear bodies that recruit CRM1, export cargo proteins, and certain nucleoporins and concomitantly affect nuclear protein and poly(A) + RNA export. SQSTM1-Nup214, although mostly cytoplasmic, also forms nuclear bodies and inhibits nuclear protein but not poly(A) + RNA export. The interaction of the fusion proteins with CRM1 is RanGTP-dependent, as shown in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and binding assays. Further analysis revealed that the Nup214 parts mediate the inhibition of nuclear export, whereas the SET or SQSTM1 part determines the localization of the fusion protein and therefore the extent of the effect. SET-Nup214 nuclear bodies are highly mobile structures, which are in equilibrium with the nucleoplasm in interphase and disassemble during mitosis or upon treatment of cells with the CRM1-inhibitor leptomycin B. Strikingly, we found that nucleoporins can be released from nuclear bodies and reintegrated into existing NPC.

CML diagnosis is based on detection of Philadelphia chromosome and \"Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog\" (ABL)-\"breakpoint cluster region protein\" fusions (ABL-BCR fusions). In this study, patients with CML morphology were studied according to ABL-BCR fusions and the relationship between the fusions and peripheral blood cell changes was examined. All patients suspected to chronic myeloproliferative disorders in Lorestan Province visiting subspecialist hematology clinics who were confirmed by oncologist were studied over a period of 5 years. After completing basic data questionnaire, blood samples were obtained with informed consent from the patients. Blood cell count and morphology were investigated and RNA was extracted from blood samples. cDNA was synthesized from RNA and ABL-BCR fusions including b3a2 and b2a2 (protein 210 kd or p210), e1a2 (protein 190 kdor p190), and e19a2 (protein 230 kdor p230) were studied by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method. Coexistence of e1a2 and b2a2 (p210/p190) fusions was also studied. The prevalence of mutations and their correlation with the blood parameters were statistically analyzed. Of 58 patients positive for ABL-BCR fusion, 18 (30.5%) had b2a2 fusion, 37 (62.71%) had b3a2 fusion and three (3.08%) had e1a2 fusion. Coexistence of e1a2 and b2a2 (p210/p190) was not observed. There was no significant correlation between ABL-BCR fusions and white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin concentration. The ABL-BCR fusions in Lorestan Province were similar to other studies in Iran, and b3a2 fusion had the highest prevalence in the studied patients studied.\n\n[RXR, a key member of the oncogenic complex in acute promyelocytic leukemia].\n\nPubMed\n\nHalftermeyer, Juliane; Le Bras, Morgane; De ThÃ©, Hugues\n\n2011-11-01\n\nAcute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is induced by fusion proteins always implying the retinoic acid receptor RARa. Although PML-RARa and other fusion oncoproteins are able to bind DNA as homodimers, in vivo they are always found in association with the nuclear receptor RXRa (Retinoid X Receptor). Thus, RXRa is an essential cofactor of the fusion protein for the transformation. Actually, RXRa contributes to several aspects of in vivo -transformation: RARa fusion:RXRa hetero-oligomeric complexes bind DNA with a much greater affinity than RARa fusion homodimers. Besides, PML-RARa:RXRa recognizes an enlarged repertoire of DNA binding sites. Thus the association between fusion proteins and RXRa regulates more genes than the homodimer alone. Titration of RXRa by the fusion protein may also play a role in the transformation process, as well as post-translational modifications of RXRa in the complex. Finally, RXRa is required for rexinoid-induced APL differentiation. Thus, RXRa is a key member of the oncogenic complex.

Mutation of ALK, KRAS, PIK3CA, ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1, and RET genesoccurred in 7%, 4%, 2.5%, 1.5%, 1%, 1%, and 1% of cases, respectively. Thus, 79% of lung adenocarcinomas from never-smoker females harbored well-known oncogenic mutations. Mucinous adenocarcinomas tended to have a lower frequency of known driver gene mutations than other histologic subtypes. EGFR mutation was associated with older age and a predominantly acinar pattern, while ALK rearrangement was associated with younger age and a predominantly solid pattern. Lung cancer in never-smoker Asian females is a distinct entity, with the majority of these cancers developing from oncogenic mutations.

Chromosomal translocations in this cancer produce fusion oncogenes as characteristic molecular signatures of the disease. The most common case is the translocation t (11; 22) (q24;q12) which yields the EWS-Fli1 chimeric transcription factor. Finding a way to directly target EWS-Fli1 remains a central therapeutic approach to eradicate this aggressive cancer. Here we demonstrate that treating Ewing Sarcoma cells with JQ1(+), a BET bromodomain inhibitor, represses directly EWS-Fli1 transcription as well as its transcriptional program. Moreover, the Chromatin Immuno Precipitation experiments demonstrate for the first time that these results are a consequence of the depletion of BRD4, one of the BET bromodomains protein from the EWS-Fli1 promoter. In vitro, JQ1(+) treatment reduces the cell viability, impairs the cell clonogenic and the migratory abilities, and induces a G1-phase blockage as well as a time- and a dose-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, in our in vivo model, we observed a tumor burden delay, an inhibition of the global vascularization and an increase of the mice overall survival. Taken together, our data indicate that inhibiting the BET bromodomains interferes with EWS-FLi1 transcription and could be a promising strategy in the Ewing tumors context.

John; Engelman, Jeffrey A.; Shaw, Alice T.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene represents a molecular target in a small subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). This fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation with potent transforming activity. In a pivotal phase 1 clinical trial, the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib (PF-02341066) demonstrated impressive antitumor activity in the majority of patients with NSCLC harboring ALK fusions. However, despite these remarkable initial responses, cancers eventually develop resistance to crizotinib, usually within 1 y, thereby limiting the potential clinical benefit. To determine how cancers acquire resistance to ALK inhibitors, we established a model of acquired resistance to crizotinib by exposing a highly sensitive EML4-ALKâpositive NSCLC cell line to increasing doses of crizotinib until resistance emerged. We found that cells resistant to intermediate doses of crizotinib developed amplification of the EML4-ALK gene. Cells resistant to higher doses (1 Î¼M) also developed a gatekeeper mutation, L1196M, within the kinase domain, rendering EML4-ALK insensitive to crizotinib. This gatekeeper mutation was readily detected using a unique and highly sensitive allele-specific PCR assay. Although crizotinib was ineffectual against EML4-ALK harboring the gatekeeper mutation, we observed that two structurally different ALK inhibitors, NVP-TAE684 and AP26113, were highly active against the resistant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these resistant cells remained highly sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG. Thus, we have developed a model of acquired resistance to ALK inhibitors and have shown that second-generation ALK TKIs or Hsp90 inhibitors are effective in treating crizotinib-resistant tumors harboring secondary gatekeeper mutations.
