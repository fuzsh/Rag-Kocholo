This article highlights the increasing confusion regarding Barrett's oesophagus with a focus on the all-too-frequently ignored aspect of the columnar lined oesophagus.\n\nCancer risk in Barrett's oesophagus.\n\nPubMed\n\nDias Pereira, AntÃ³nio; Suspiro, Alexandra; Chaves, Paula\n\n2007-11-01\n\n(Table is included in full-text article.)Barrett's oesophagus results from the replacement of the normal squamous lining of the oesophagus by a columnar epithelium. It is the sole known premalignant condition for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The annual cancer incidence of 1% in Barrett's oesophagus, calculated from published series, has been recently considered an overestimation owing to publication bias, and a 0.5% risk was proposed. The prerequisite of the presence of intestinal metaplasia for the diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus, although widely accepted, is questioned by some authors. How adenocarcinoma incidence is influenced by requiring or not intestinal metaplasia for Barrett's oesophagus diagnosis is unknown. Most of the published studies included only (or preferentially) patients with long segments. Data on adenocarcinoma incidence in short segments (<3 cm) are very scarce, but it is believed to be lower than in long segments. The magnitude of cancer risk influences cost effectiveness of surveillance of Barrett's oesophagus. Frequently, therapeutic intervention is performed when high-grade dysplasia is diagnosed, preventing progression to adenocarcinoma. This could lead to an underestimation of cancer risk in Barrett's surveillance studies.\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis of metaplastic non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus shows phenotypic similarities to Barrett's oesophagus: a study in an Asian population.\n\nPubMed\n\nSrivastava, Supriya; Liew, Mei Shan; McKeon, Frank; Xian, Wa; Yeoh, Khay Guan; Ho, Khek Yu; Teh, Ming\n\n2014-02-01\n\nBarrett's oesophagus is a premalignant condition, predisposing to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. However, some adenocarcinoma may arise in columnar lined oesophagus without goblet cells. Our aim was to evaluate the biological properties of non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus only and elucidate its relationship with Barrett's oesophagus and associated neoplasia. Endoscopic biopsies from patients with Barrett's oesophagus (n=30), non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus (n=14), Barrett's oesophagus associated high grade dysplasia (n=6) and adenocarcinoma (n=4) were selected. Immunostaining for villin, claudin 3 and MUC4 was performed. Statistical analysis was performed and a p value <0.05 was considered significant. Villin and MUC4 were positive in 42%, 100% each and 50% in non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus, Barrett's oesophagus, high grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma respectively, while claudin 3 was 100% positive in all the groups. In non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus, six cases that were villin immunopositive, showed positive expression for claudin 3 and/or MUC4 and there was no difference from the high grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma (p>0.05). Our results indicate that a subset of non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus shows an intestinal phenotype representing an early stage of Barrett's oesophagus. This subset probably harbours the potential to change into adenocarcinoma in the long term. Copyright Â© 2013 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Barrett's oesophagus is important clinically because those afflicted are predisposed to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Prevalence surveys suggest that up to 2% of the population may be affected; most will be unaware of their diagnosis. Risk factors include age, male sex, gastro-oesophageal acid reflux, central obesity and smoking. Helicobacter pylori infection confers a reduced risk of Barrett's oesophagus. Risks of cancer progression are lower than originally reported and are now estimated at 1-3 per 1000 patient-years for patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus. Progression rates are higher for patients with long segment (â¥ 3 cm) and dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus. Australian guidelines have been developed to aid practitioners in managing patients with Barrett's oesophagus and early oesophageal adenocarcinoma. While generalised population screening for Barrett's oesophagus is not recommended, endoscopic surveillance of patients with confirmed Barrett's oesophagus is recommended, with surveillance intervals dependent on segment length and presence of dysplasia. New techniques such as endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic radiofrequency ablation are now available to treat patients with dysplasia and early oesophageal adenocarcinoma. New screening and surveillance technologies are currently under investigation; these may prove cost-effective in identifying and managing patients in the community.\n\nGranular cell myoblastoma of the oesophagus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLarsen, Gordon L.; Armstrong, Raymond G.; Stanford, William; Cline, Robert E.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nLarsen, G. L., Armstrong, R. G., Stanford, W., and Cline, R. E. (1973).Thorax, 28, 641-643. Granular cell myoblastoma of the oesophagus. During evaluation of symptoms of oesophageal reflux in a 40-year-old man, a filling defect of the distal oesophagus was seen on the oesophagogram, and this was noted to be a submucosal mass at oesophagoscopy. He also had an oesophageal hiatus hernia. The lesion proved to be a granular cell myoblastoma, a rarity in the oesophagus, only 11 previous cases having been reported. Symptomatology evaluation and management of granular cell myoblastoma of the oesophagus are discussed. As with other submucosal lesions of the oesophagus, preoperative biopsy through an intact mucosa is to be avoided because of danger to the patient from haemorrhage or perforation and subsequent inflammatory reaction making surgical resection and microscopic diagnosis difficult.

There have been tremendous advances in the field of Barrett's oesophagus, not only in diagnostic modalities, but also in therapeutic strategies available to treat this premalignant disease. In this review, we discuss the past, present and future of Barrett's oesophagus. We describe the historical and new evolving diagnostic criteria of Barrett's oesophagus, while also comparing and contrasting the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, American College of Gastroenterology guidelines and International Benign Barrett's and CAncer Taskforce (BOBCAT) for Barrett's oesophagus. Advances in endoscopic modalities such as confocal and volumetric laser endomicroscopy, and a non-endoscopic sampling device, the Cytosponge, are described which could aid in identification of Barrett's oesophagus. With regards to therapy we review the evidence for the utility of endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation when coupled with better characterization of dysplasia. These endoscopic advances have transformed the management of Barrett's oesophagus from a primarily surgical disease into an endoscopically managed condition. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.

Observational study during thoracoscopic esophagectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuesta, Miguel A; Weijs, Teus J; Bleys, Ronald L A W; van Hillegersberg, Richard; van Berge Henegouwen, Mark I; Gisbertz, Suzanne S; Ruurda, Jelle P; Straatman, Jennifer; Osugi, Harushi; van der Peet, Donald L\n\n2015-09-01\n\nDuring thoracoscopic oesophageal surgery, we observed not previously described fascia-like structures. Description of similar structures in rectal cancer surgery was of paramount importance in improving the quality of resection. Therefore, we aimed to describe a new comprehensive concept of the surgical anatomy of the thoracic oesophagus with definition of the meso-oesophagus. We retrospectively evaluated 35 consecutive unedited videos of thoracoscopic oesophageal resections for cancer, to determine the surgical anatomy of the oesophageal fascia's vessels and lymphatic drainage. The resulting concept was validated in a prospective study, including 20 patients at three different centres. Additional confirmation was sought by a histologic study of a cadaver's thorax. A thin layer of connective tissue around the infracarinal oesophagus, involving the lymph nodes at the level of the carina, was observed during thoracoscopic esophagectomy in 32 of the 35 patients included in the retrospective study and in 19 of the 20 patients included in the prospective study. A thick fascia-like structure from the upper thoracic aperture to the lower thoracic aperture was visualized in all patients. This fascia is encountered between the descending aorta and left aspect of the infracarinal oesophagus. Above the carina it expands on both sides of the oesophagus to lateral mediastinal structures. This fascia contains oesophageal vessels, lymph vessels and nodes and nerves. The histologic study confirmed these findings. Here we described the concept of the \"meso-oesophagus\". Applying the description of the meso-oesophagus will create a better understanding of the oesophageal anatomy, leading to more adequate and reproducible surgery.\n\nBarrett's oesophagus: treatment with surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeMeester, Steven R\n\n2015-02-01\n\nBarrett's oesophagus develops as a consequence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and may progress to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Antireflux surgery is an option for patients with reflux disease, but the efficacy and impact on the natural history of disease in patients with Barrett's oesophagus is controversial.

Polyamine content and histological findings were examined in 107 pairs of endoscopic biopsy specimens taken from gastric fundus, fundic and specialised Barrett's oesophagus and Barrett's adenocarcinoma. The content of putrescine (median nmol/mg protein, range) the primary product of ornithine decarboxylase showed a progressive increase from gastric fundus (0.41, 0.15-1.5); fundic (0.45, 0.01-4.08); specialised Barrett's oesophagus (0.54, 0.01-2.0); dysplastic columnar lined oesophagus (0.56, 0.31-3.1) to adenocarcinoma (1.23, 0.29-8.98). Adenocarcinoma putrescine content was significantly greater than gastric fundus (p < 0.018) and fundic (p < 0.03). Mucosal spermine, spermidine, and total polyamine values were greater in gastric fundus than fundic, specialised Barrett's oesophagus, and dysplastic columnar lined oesophagus (all p < 0.001) suggesting failure to further metabolise putrescine to its higher polyamines in the metaplastic epithelium. Although metaplastic columnar lined oesophagus shows significant differences in polyamine metabolic activity from the stomach the important distinction between specialised and dysplastic columnar lined oesophagus cannot be made by measuring the polyamine content.

From March 2015 to September 2015, 3DRA of the LA and the oesophagus was performed in 33 patients before catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Control contrast oesophagography was performed every 30 min. The positions of the oesophagograms and the 3D model of the LA and the oesophagus were repeatedly measured and compared with the spine. The average shift of the oesophagus ranged from 2.7 Â± 2.2 to 5.0 Â± 3.5 mm. The average real-time oesophageal shift ranged from 2.7 Â± 2.2 to 3.8 Â± 3.4 mm. No significant shift was detected until the 90th minute of the procedure. The average shift of the 3D model of the LA and the oesophagus ranged from 1.4 Â± 1.8 to 3.3 Â± 3.0 mm (right-left direction) and from 0.9 Â± 1.2 to 2.2 Â± 1.3 mm (craniocaudal direction). During the 2 h procedure, there were no significant shifts of the model. During catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, there is no significant change in the position of the oesophagus until the 90th minute of the procedure and no significant shift in the 3D model of the LA and the oesophagus. The 3D model of the oesophagus reliably depicts the position of the oesophagus during the entire procedure. Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved.

It may represent inclusion cysts, retention cysts and developmental cysts. We present a case of keratinous inclusion cyst of the lower oesophagus in a 71-year-old Malay woman who presented with dyspepsia and severe epigastric pain. An oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy demonstrated a sliding hiatus hernia with whitish ulcer-like lesion at the lower oesophagus. Biopsy from the lesion revealed a keratinous inclusion cyst. The patient was given pantoprazole and put on regular follow-up for monitoring any other development.

In this operation the stomach is brought to the neck by the subcutaneous route and the fundus anastomosed to the proximal end of the divided cervical oesophagus. The distal cervical oesophagus is closed and the intra-abdominal oesophagus is drained into a Roux-en-Y loop of jejunum. This paper reports the performance of this operation on 15 African patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus invading the tracheobronchial tree. There were no operative deaths and all the patients could eat a normal diet after the operation. Ten patients also received radiation therapy to the tumour. The technique of the operation and the late results of treatment are discussed.

Given the emphasis on endoscopic detection and dysplasia grading, it is easy to forget that the benefits of these screening programs remain unproven. The majority of patients are at low risk of progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and periodic surveillance of these patients is burdensome and costly. Here, we investigate the parallels in the development of Barrett's oesophagus and other scenarios of wound healing in the intestine. There is now increased recognition of the full range of glandular phenotypes that can be found in patients' surveillance biopsies, and emerging evidence suggests parallel pathways to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Greater understanding of the conditions that favour progression to cancer in the distal oesophagus will allow us to focus resources on patients at increased risk.\n\nBarrett's oesophagus: Evidence from the current meta-analyses.\n\nPubMed\n\nGatenby, Piers; Soon, Yuen\n\n2014-08-15\n\nGuidelines have been published regarding the management of Barrett's oesophagus (columnar-lined oesophagus). These have examined the role of surveillance in an effort to detect dysplasia and early cancer. The guidelines have provided criteria for enrolment into surveillance and some risk stratification with regard to surveillance interval. The research basis for the decisions reached with regard to cancer risk is weak and this manuscript has examined the available data published from meta-analyses up to 25(th) April 2013 (much of which has been published since the guidelines and their most recent updates have been written). There were 9 meta-analyses comparing patients with Barrett's oesophagus to control populations. These have demonstrated that Barrett's oesophagus is more common in males than females, in subjects who have ever smoked, in subjects with obesity, in subjects with prolonged symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, in subjects who do not have infection with Helicobacter pylori and in subjects with hiatus hernia. These findings should inform public health measures in reducing the risk of Barrett's oesophagus and subsequent surveillance burden and cancer risk. There were 8 meta-analyses comparing different groups of patients with Barrett's oesophagus with regard to cancer risk. These have demonstrated that there was no statistically significant benefit of antireflux surgery over medical therapy, that endoscopic ablative therapy was effective in reducing cancer risk that there was similar cancer risk in patients with Barrett's oesophagus independent of geographic origin, that the adenocarcinoma incidence in males is twice the rate in females, that the cancer risk in long segment disease showed a trend to be higher than in short segment disease, that there was a trend for higher cancer risk in low-grade dysplasia over non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus, that there is a lower risk in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and that there is a\n\nBarrett's oesophagus: frequency and prediction of dysplasia and cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nFalk, Gary W\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is continuing to increase at an alarming rate in the Western world today. Barrett's oesophagus is a clearly recognized risk factor for the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, but the overwhelming majority of patients with Barrett's oesophagus will never develop oesophageal cancer. A number of endoscopic, histologic and epidemiologic riskÂ factors identify Barrett's oesophagus patients at increased risk for progression to high-grade dysplasia and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic factors include segment length, mucosal abnormalities as seemingly trivial as oesophagitis and the 12 to 6Â o'clock hemisphere of the oesophagus. Both intestinal metaplasia and low grade dysplasia, the latter only if confirmed by a pathologist with expertise in Barrett's oesophagus pathologic interpretation are the histologic risk factors for progression. Epidemiologic risk factors include ageing, male gender, obesity, and smoking. Factors that may protect against the development of adenocarcinoma include a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and the use of proton pump inhibitors, aspirin/NSAIDs and statins.

Barrett's oesophagus occurs when duodenoâgastroâoesophageal reflux causes squamous epithelium (SE) tissue to become columnar epithelium tissue by an unknown mechanism. The bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA) competes for the retinoid X receptor retinoid binding site. Hence, RA pathways may be implicated in Barrett's oesophagus. Methods RA activity in tissues and cell lines treated with allâtrans retinoic acid (ATRA) with or without LCA was assessed using a reporter. Expression of p21 was determined by realâtime PCR in Barrett's oesophagus cell lines with or without LCA. SE and Barrett's oesophagus biopsy specimens were exposed to 100â Î¼M of ATRA or 20â mM of a RA inhibitor, citral, in organ culture for >72â h. Characteristics of treated specimens, compared with untreated controls, were analysed by immunohistochemical analysis (cytokeratins (CKs), vimentin) and RTâPCR (CKs). Confocal microscopy assessed temporal changes in coâlocalisation of CK8/18 and vimentin. Cell proliferation was assessed by bromoâdeoxyuridine incorporation and immunohistochemical analysis for Ki67 and p21. Results RA biosynthesis was increased in Barrett's oesophagus compared with SE (p<0.001). LCA and ATRA caused a synergistic increase in RA signalling as shown by increased p21 (p<0.01). Morphological and molecular analysis of SE exposed to ATRA showed columnar differentiation independent of proliferation. Metaplasia could be induced from the stromal compartment alone and vimentin expression coâlocalised with CK8/18 at 24â h, which separated into CK8/18âpositive glands and vimentinâpositive stroma by 48â h. Citralâtreated Barrett's oesophagus led to phenotypic and immunohistochemical characteristics of SE, which was independent of proliferation. Conclusion RA activity is increased in Barrett's oesophagus and is induced by LCA.

Among oesophageal duplications, cystic duplication is the most common and the tubular variety, the rarest. Herein, we report a rare case of tubular oesophageal duplication, complicated by adenosquamous carcinoma at the lower end of the oesophagus, in a 32-year-old man who presented with progressive dysphagia. Although proton pump inhibitors may relieve dysphagia, oesophagectomy and gastric interpositioning should be the first-line treatment for patients with tubular oesophageal duplication, in order to reduce the risk of malignant transformation at the lower end of the oesophagus.\n\nTerror mit Atomwaffen: reale Gefahr?

To assess the prevalence and characteristics of acid-GERD in Jackhammer oesophagus and the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors. Data and outcomes of patients with Jackhammer oesophagus were assessed. Two groups were compared: (i) GERD, defined by endoscopic oesophagitis or by an increase in acid exposure time or by an acid-hypersensitive oesophagus and (ii) non-GERD defined by normal oesophageal acid exposure without acid-hypersensitive oesophagus. Among the 1994 high-resolution manometries performed, 44 Jackhammer oesophagus (2.2%) were included (sex ratio M/F: 19/25; median age: 66 [61-75] years). Nineteen patients (43.2%) had GERD, 16 (36.4%) had no GERD and 9 patients (20.4%) were undetermined. Dysphagia was the predominant symptom (37/43 (86%)). After a median follow-up of 25.3 months [9.6-31.4], dysphagia was improved in 22/36 (61.1%) patients. Dysphagia improvement as well as other symptoms improvement was not associated with GERD status or proton-pump inhibitors use. The prevalence of GERD is high among patients with Jackhammer oesophagus. The rates of symptom improvement in Jackhammer oesophagus were high regardless of the use of proton-pump inhibitors treatment or of the presence of GERD.

These have demonstrated that there was no statistically significant benefit of antireflux surgery over medical therapy, that endoscopic ablative therapy was effective in reducing cancer risk that there was similar cancer risk in patients with Barrettâs oesophagus independent of geographic origin, that the adenocarcinoma incidence in males is twice the rate in females, that the cancer risk in long segment disease showed a trend to be higher than in short segment disease, that there was a trend for higher cancer risk in low-grade dysplasia over non-dysplastic Barrettâs oesophagus, that there is a lower risk in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and that\n\nAfrican American ethnicity is not associated with development of Barrett's oesophagus after erosive oesophagitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlkaddour, Ahmad; McGaw, Camille; Hritani, Rama; Palacio, Carlos; Nakshabendi, Rahman; Munoz, Juan Carlos; Vega, Kenneth J\n\n2015-10-01\n\nBarrett's oesophagus is the primary risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma; erosive oesophagitis is considered an intermediate step with Barrett's oesophagus development potential upon healing. Barrett's oesophagus occurs in 9-19% following erosive oesophagitis but minimal data exists in African Americans. The study aim was to determine if ethnicity is associated with Barrett's oesophagus formation following erosive oesophagitis. Retrospective review of endoscopies from September 2007 to December 2012 was performed. Inclusion criteria were erosive oesophagitis on index endoscopy, repeat endoscopy â¥6 weeks later and non-Hispanic white or African American ethnicity. Barrett's oesophagus frequency following erosive oesophagitis by ethnicity was compared. A total of 14,303 patients underwent endoscopy during the study period; 1636 had erosive oesophagitis. Repeat endoscopy was performed on 125 non-Hispanic white or African American patients â¥6 weeks from the index procedure. Barrett's oesophagus occurred in 8% of non-Hispanic whites while no African American developed it on repeat endoscopy following erosive oesophagitis (p=0.029). No significant difference was seen between ethnic groups in any clinical parameter assessed. African American ethnicity appears to result in decreased Barrett's oesophagus formation following erosive oesophagitis. Further investigation to demonstrate factors resulting in decreased Barrett's oesophagus formation among African Americans should be performed. Copyright Â© 2015.

The management of Barrett's oesophagus entails treating reflux symptoms with acid-suppressing medication or surgery (fundoplication). However, neither form of anti-reflux therapy produces predictable regression, or prevents cancer development. Patients with Barrett's oesophagus usually undergo endoscopic surveillance, which aims to identify dysplastic changes or cancer at its earliest stage, when treatment outcomes should be better. Alternative endoscopic interventions are now available and are suggested for the treatment of early cancer and prevention of progression of Barrett's oesophagus to cancer. Such treatments could minimize the risks associated with oesophagectomy. The current status of these interventions is reviewed. Various endoscopic interventions have been described, but with long-term outcomes uncertain, they remain somewhat controversial. Radiofrequency ablation of dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus might reduce the risk of cancer progression, although cancer development has been reported after this treatment. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) allows a 1.5-2âcm diameter piece of oesophageal mucosa to be removed. This provides better pathology for diagnosis and staging, and if the lesion is confined to the mucosa and fully excised, EMR can be curative. The combination of EMR and radiofrequency ablation has been used for multifocal lesions, but long-term outcomes are unknown. The new endoscopic interventions for Barrett's oesophagus and early oesophageal cancer have the potential to improve clinical outcomes, although evidence that confirms superiority over oesphagectomy is limited. Longer-term outcome data and data from larger cohorts are required to confirm the appropriateness of these procedures. Â© 2012 The Authors.

To identify the preferred location of non-circumferential Barrett's oesophagus and associated dysplasia within the esophageal circumference. We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained database of patients with non-circumferential lesions. The location of metaplastic lesions and dysplastic lesions within the esophageal circumference was identified as on a clock face, and their distribution in the 4 quadrants was compared. Of overall 443 patients with Barrett's oesophagus, 192 (43%) were eligible for our study. Multiple lesions were diagnosed in 110 (57%) of them, for a total amount of 352 metaplastic areas. Barrett's oesophagus lesions were located significantly more in the posterior wall of the oesophagus (38.4%), rather than in the right wall (28.8%), the anterior wall (22.6%), or the left wall (10.2%) (P<0.0001). Among all metaplastic lesions, 28 were associated with dysplasia (7.9%), and one with adenocarcinoma (0.3%). Dysplastic lesions were significantly more common in the posterior wall (39.3%) than, respectively, in the anterior wall (35.8%), the right wall (21.4%) or the left wall (3.5%) (P=0.03). Our results show that the posterior wall of the oesophagus is the preferential location of both Barrett's oesophagus and associated dysplasia.

Both proton pump inhibitor therapy and antireflux surgery are effective at controlling endoscopic signs and symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with Barrett's oesophagus, but often fail to eliminate pathological oesophageal acid exposure. The current available studies strongly suggest that acid suppressive therapy, both pharmacological as well as surgical acid suppression, can reduce the risk the development and progression in patients with Barrett's oesophagus, but are not capable of complete prevention. No significant differences have been found between pharmacological and surgical therapy. For clinical practice, patients should be prescribed a proton pump inhibitor once daily as maintenance therapy, with the dose guided by symptoms. Antireflux surgery can be a good alternative to proton pump inhibitor therapy, but should be primarily offered to patients with symptomatic reflux, and not to asymptomatic patients with the rationale to protect against cancer.

The recently reported low annual oesophageal adenocarcinoma risk in population studies, the failure to identify most Barrett's patients at risk of disease progression, the poor adherence to surveillance and biopsy protocols, and the significant risk of misclassification of dysplasia all tend to undermine the effectiveness of current management, in particular, endoscopic surveillance programmes, to prevent or improve the outcomes of patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The ongoing increase in incidence of Barrett's oesophagus and consequent growth of the surveillance population, together with the associated discomfort and costs of endoscopic surveillance, demand improved techniques for accurately determining individual risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. More accurate techniques are needed to run efficient surveillance programmes in the coming decades. In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge on the epidemiology of Barrett's oesophagus, and the challenging epidemiological dilemmas that need to be addressed when assessing the current screening and surveillance strategies.\n\nGATA6 expression in Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nPavlov, Kirill; Honing, Judith; Meijer, Coby; Boersma-van Ek, Wytske; Peters, Frans T M; van den Berg, Anke; Karrenbeld, Arend; Plukker, John T M; Kruyt, Frank A E; Kleibeuker, Jan H\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBarrett's oesophagus can progress towards oesophageal adenocarcinoma through a metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The transcription factor GATA6 is known to be involved in columnar differentiation and proliferation, and GATA6 gene amplification was recently linked with poor survival in oesophageal adenocarcinoma. To study the expression of GATA6 during Barrett's oesophagus development and malignant transformation. To determine the prognostic value of GATA6 in oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Two retrospective cohorts were derived from the pathological archive of the University Medical Center Groningen. The first cohort contained 130 tissue samples of normal squamous epithelium, metaplasia, dysplasia and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The second cohort consisted of a tissue microarray containing tissue from 92 oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine GATA6 protein expression and to correlate GATA6 expression in oesophageal adenocarcinoma with overall and disease-free survival. The percentage of GATA6-positive cells was low in squamous epithelium (10%) but increased progressively in Barrett's oesophagus (30%, P < 0.001) and high-grade dysplasia (82%, P = 0.005). GATA6 expression was not associated with overall or disease-free survival in oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients (P = 0.599 and P = 0.700 respectively). GATA6 expression is progressively increased during Barrett's oesophagus development and its malignant transformation. However, no prognostic value of GATA6 expression could be found in oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Copyright Â© 2014 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has risen at an alarming rate over the past four decades in many regions of the Western world and there are indications that the incidence of this disease is on the rise in Asian populations where it has been rare. Much has been learned of host and environmental risk factors that affect the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma and data indicate that patients with Barrettâs oesophagus rarely develop oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that 95% of oesophageal adenocarcinoma arise in individuals without a prior diagnosis of Barrettâs oesophagus, what strategies can be used to reduce late diagnosis of oesophageal adenocarcinoma? PMID:20094044\n\nOesophageal tone and sensation in the transition zone between proximal striated and distal smooth muscle oesophagus.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaramanolis, G; Stevens, W; Vos, R; Tack, J; Clave, P; Sifrim, D\n\n2008-04-01\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the proximal striated muscle oesophagus is less compliant and more sensitive than the distal smooth muscle oesophagus. Conventional and high resolution manometry described a transition zone between striated and smooth muscle oesophagus. We aimed to evaluate oesophageal tone and sensitivity at the transition zone of oesophagus in healthy volunteers. In 18 subjects (seven men, mean age: 28 years) an oesophageal barostat study was performed. Tone and sensitivity were assessed using stepwise isobaric distensions with the balloon located at transition zone and at distal oesophagus in random order. To study the effect induced on transition zone by a previous distension at the distal oesophagus and vice versa, identical protocol was repeated after 7 days with inverted order. Initial distension of a region is referred to as 'naÃ¯f' distension and distension of a region following the distension of the other segment as 'primed' distension. Assessment of three oesophageal symptoms (chest pain, heartburn and 'other') was obtained at the end of every distension step. Compliance was significantly higher in the transition zone than in the distal oesophagus (1.47 +/- 0.14 vs 1.09 +/- 0.09 mL mmHg(-1), P = 0.03) after 'naif' distensions. This difference was not observed during 'primed' distensions. Higher sensitivity at transition zone level was found in 11/18 (61%) subjects compared to 6/18 (33%, P < 0.05) at smooth muscle oesophagus. Chest pain and 'other' symptom were more often induced by distention of the transition zone, whereas heartburn was equally triggered by distension of either region. The transition zone is more complaint and more sensitive than smooth muscle oesophagus.\n\nRisk of Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma and reflux oesophagitis and the use of nitrates and asthma medications.\n\nPubMed\n\nLadanchuk, Todd C; Johnston, Brian T; Murray, Liam J; Anderson, Lesley A\n\n2010-12-01\n\nTo investigate the relationship between use of asthma medication and nitrates and risk of reflux oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Data were collected on use of asthma medication and nitrates at least 1 year before interview from patients with reflux oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Associations between use of asthma medications and nitrates and the risk of reflux oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma were estimated using multiple logistic regression. Nine hundred and forty-one subjects were recruited: 230 reflux oesophagitis, 224 Barrett's oesophagus, 227 oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients and 260 population controls. Barrett's oesophagus patients were more likely than controls to have had a diagnosis of asthma (odds ratio 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.15-4.03) and to have used asthma medications (odds ratio 2.13, 95% confidence interval 1.09-4.16). No significant associations were observed between use of asthma medication or nitrates and reflux oesophagitis or oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms appear to confound the association between asthma medication use and Barrett's oesophagus. However, it is possible that asthma medications may increase the risk of Barrett's oesophagus by other mechanisms.\n\nBarrett's oesophagus: intestinal metaplasia is not essential for cancer risk.\n\nPubMed\n\nKelty, Clive J; Gough, Martin D; Van Wyk, Quintin; Stephenson, Timothy J; Ackroyd, Roger\n\n2007-11-01\n\nBarrett's oesophagus is the main identifiable risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. It has been suggested that only patients with intestinal metaplasia are at risk of cancer, but the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines suggest that glandular mucosa is all that is needed. The aim of this study was to quantify the risk of adenocarcinoma in columnar-lined lower oesophagus, with or without specialized intestinal metaplasia. All patients who had endoscopic biopsies of the lower oesophagus between 1980 and 1994 in a single-centre teaching hospital were included in the study. All histological specimens were re-examined and reported according to whether they contained columnar epithelial-lined lower oesophagus, glandular mucosa, with or without intestinal metaplasia. The primary outcome measure was the development of adenocarcinoma. In total, 712 patients were identified. Of these, 379 (55.1%) were found to have specialized intestinal metaplasia (SIM), and the remaining 309 (44.9%, p = NS) were reported as having glandular mucosa (GM). The median follow-up for patients was 12 years (range 8-20 years). Twenty-eight patients went on to develop adenocarcinoma (4.1%) during the follow-up period - 17 in the SIM group (4.5%) and 11 in the GM group (3.6%, p =NS). The oesophageal malignancy rate was 0.34% per year (SIM 0.37%, GM 0.30%; p =NS). Patients who have glandular mucosa on biopsy without intestinal metaplasia have a similar cancer risk to those with specialized intestinal metaplasia.\n\nAlcohol consumption pattern and risk of Barrett's oesophagus and erosive oesophagitis: an Italian case-control study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFiliberti, Rosa A; Fontana, Vincenzo; De Ceglie, Antonella; Blanchi, Sabrina; Grossi, Enzo; Della Casa, Domenico; Lacchin, Teresa; De Matthaeis, Marina; Ignomirelli, Orazio; Cappiello, Roberta; Rosa, Alessandra; Foti, Monica; Laterza, Francesco; D'Onofrio, Vittorio; Iaquinto, Gaetano; Conio, Massimo\n\n2017-04-01\n\nKnowledge about the association between alcohol and Barrett's oesophagus and reflux oesophagitis is conflicting. In this case-control study we evaluated the role of specific alcoholic beverages (red and white wine, beer and liquors) in 339 Barrett's oesophagus and 462 oesophagitis patients compared with 619 endoscopic controls with other disorders, recruited in twelve Italian endoscopic units. Data on alcohol and other individual characteristics were obtained from structured questionnaires. No clear, monotonic significant dose-response relationship was pointed out for red wine. However, a generalised U-shaped trend of Barrett's oesophagus/oesophagitis risk due to red wine consumption particularly among current drinkers was found. Similar results were also found for white wine. Liquor/spirit consumption seemed to bring about a 1Â·14-2Â·30 risk excess, although statistically non-significant, for current Barrett's oesophagus/oesophagitis drinkers. Statistically significant decreasing dose-response relationships were found in Barrett's oesophagus for frequency and duration of beer consumption. Similar, but less clear downward tendencies were also found for oesophagitis patients. In conclusion, although often not statistically significant, our data suggested a reduced risk of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophagitis with a low/moderate intake of wine and beer consumption. A non-significant increased risk of Barrett's oesophagus/oesophagitis was observed with a higher intake of any type of heavy alcohol consumption, but no conclusion can be drawn owing to the high number of non-spirit drinkers and to the small number of drinkers at higher alcohol intake levels.\n\nNon-achalasic motor disorders of the oesophagus.\n\nPubMed\n\nSifrim, Daniel; Fornari, Fernando\n\n2007-01-01\n\nMotor abnormalities of the oesophagus are characterised by a chronic impairment of the neuromuscular structures that co-ordinate oesophageal function. The best-defined entity is achalasia, which is discussed in a separate chapter. Other motor disorders with clinical relevance include diffuse oesophageal spasm, oesophageal dysmotility associated with scleroderma, and ineffective oesophageal motility. These non-achalasic motor disorders have variable prevalence but they could be associated with invalidating symptoms such as dysphagia, chest pain and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. New oesophageal diagnostic techniques, including high-resolution manometry, high-frequency intraluminal ultrasound and intraluminal impedance, allow (1) better definition of peristalsis and sphincter function, (2) assessment of changes in oesophageal wall thickness, and (3) evaluation of pressure gradients within the oesophagus and across the sphincters that can produce normal or abnormal patterns of bolus transport. This chapter discusses recent advances in physiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of non-achalasic oesophageal motor disorders.\n\nMortality and cardiovascular diseases risk in patients with Barrett's oesophagus: a population-based nationwide cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nErichsen, R; Horvath-Puho, E; Lund, J L; Dellon, E S; Shaheen, N J; Pedersen, L; Davey Smith, G; SÃ¸rensen, H T\n\n2017-04-01\n\nPatients with Barrett's oesophagus may be at increased risk of mortality overall, and cardiovascular disease has been suggested as the main underlying cause of death. To examine cause-specific mortality and risk of cardiovascular events among patients with Barrett's oesophagus. Utilising existing Danish data sources (1997-2011), we identified all patients with histologically verified Barrett's oesophagus (n = 13 435) and 123 526 members of the general population matched by age, sex and individual comorbidities. We calculated cause-specific mortality rates and incidence rates of cardiovascular diseases. We then compared rates between patients with Barrett's oesophagus and the general population comparison cohort, using stratified Cox proportional hazard regression. Patients with Barrett's oesophagus had a 71% increased risk of overall mortality. The cause-specific mortality rate per 1000 person-years for patients with Barrett's oesophagus was 8.5 for cardiovascular diseases, 14.7 for non-oesophageal cancers, and 5.4 for oesophageal cancer. Compared to the general population cohort, corresponding hazard ratios were 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.38), 1.77 (95% CI: 1.65-1.90), and 19.4 (95% CI: 16.1-23.4), respectively. The incidence rates of cardiovascular diseases per 1000 person-years for Barrett's oesophagus patients and for persons from the general population cohort, respectively, varied from 0.4 and 0.2 for subarachnoid bleeding (hazard ratio 1.10, 95% CI: 0.87-1.39) to 8.1 and 5.9 for congestive heart failure (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% CI: 1.21-1.46). Prophylactic measures targeted at cardiovascular diseases and non-oesophageal cancers potentially could be more important than measures against oesophageal cancer, for improving prognosis among patients with Barrett's oesophagus.

One of the main goals of current research is to achieve risk stratification, identifying those at high risk of progression. The recent British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines on surveillance have taken a step in this direction with interval stratification on clinicopathological grounds. The majority of Barrett's oesophagus remains undiagnosed, and this has led to investigation of methods of screening for Barrett's oesophagus, ideally non-endoscopic methods capable of reliably identifying dysplasia. Chemoprevention to prevent progression is currently under investigation, and may become a key component of future treatment. The availability of effective endotherapy means that accurate identification of dysplasia is more important than ever. There is now evidence to support intervention with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for low-grade dysplasia (LGD), but recent data have emphasised the need for consensus pathology for LGD. Ablative treatment has become well established for high-grade dysplasia, and should be employed for flat lesions where there is no visible abnormality. Of the ablative modalities, RFA has the strongest evidence base. Endoscopic resection should be performed for all visible lesions, and is now the treatment of choice for T1a tumours. Targeting those with high-risk disease will, hopefully, lead to efficacious and cost-effective surveillance, and the trend towards earlier intervention to halt progression gives cause for optimism that this will ultimately result in fewer deaths from oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

The aim of this study was to establish if a relationship exists between the pH profile in the oesophagus and stomach and the development of complications in patients with Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus. Twenty four hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring was performed in 26 patients with Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus and combined with 24 hour ambulatory gastric pH monitoring in 16. Ten of the 26 with Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus had complications including stricture (eight), deep ulceration (one), and carcinoma (one). Oesophageal acid exposure (% time < pH 4) was similar in patients with or without complications (19.2% v 19.3% p > 0.05). Oesophageal alkaline exposure (% time > pH 7) was greater in patients with complications (24.2% v 8.4% p > 0.05). Of the 16 patients who underwent gastric pH monitoring there was a clear relationship between gastric and oesophageal alkalinisation in 13. These results support the hypothesis that complications in Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus develop in association with increased exposure of the oesophagus to an alkaline environment which appears to be secondary to duodenogastric reflux. The routine use of 24 hour ambulatory gastric pH monitoring in conjunction with oesophageal pH monitoring can help identify those patients at risk.

The role of Hh signalling in the oesophagus has not been studied in vivo. Here the authors examined the role of Hh signalling in epithelial homeostasis of oesophagus. The authors used transgenic mice in which the Hh receptor Patched1 (Ptch1) could be conditionally inactivated in a body-wide manner and mice in which Gli1 could be induced specifically in the epithelium of the skin and oesophagus. Effects on epithelial homeostasis of the oesophagus were examined using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridisation, transmission electron microscopy and real-time PCR. Hh signalling was examined in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) by quantitative real-time PCR. Sonic Hh is signalled in an autocrine manner in the basal layer of the oesophagus. Activation of Hh signalling resulted in an expansion of the epithelial precursor cell compartment and failure of epithelial maturation and migration. Levels of Hh targets GLI1, HHIP and PTCH1 were increased in SCC compared with normal tissue from the same patients. Here the authors find that Hh signalling positively regulates the precursor cell compartment in the oesophageal epithelium in an autocrine manner. Since Hh signalling targets precursor cells in the oesophageal epithelium and signalling is increased in SCCs, Hh signalling may be involved in oesophageal SCC formation.\n\nA comparative study of functional 5-HT4 receptors in human colon, rat oesophagus and rat ileum.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMcLean, P. G.; Coupar, I. M.; Molenaar, P.\n\n1995-01-01\n\n1. The pharmacological properties of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), the 5-HT4 receptor agonists, DAU 6236 and SC 53116 and the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, GR 1130808, were studied in the rat oesophagus, rat ileum and human colon. 2. 5-HT relaxed the longitudinal muscle of the rat oesophagus and rat ileum and the circular muscle of the human colon. Absolute values of relaxation were measured and showed the order of the maximum responses, rat oesophagus >> human colon > rat ileum with EC50 values of 189 +/- 15 nM, 157 +/- 4 nM, 306 +/- 72 nM, respectively. 5-HT also inhibited the spontaneous contractions of the human colon with an EC50 value of 119 +/- 1 nM. The effect of 5-HT on the human colon was not affected by methysergide (10 microM) or ondansetron (1 microM). 3. The use of the uptake and metabolism inhibitors, cocaine (30 microM) and pargyline (100 microM), did not increase the potency of 5-HT in the rat oesophagus or human colon. In the rat oesophagus, cocaine (30 microM) produced a reduction in carbachol-induced tone of 22.2 +/- 0.6% and reduced the 5-HT maximum effect by 52.0 +/- 0.4%. 4. The compounds, DAU 6236 and SC 53116, showed a different pattern of potencies and efficacies in the rat oesophagus, rat ileum and human colon compared to 5-HT. DAU 6236 relaxed the human colonic circular muscle with an EC50 value of 129 +/- 16 nM but its efficacy was less than that of 5-HT. DAU 6236 (1 microM) also antagonized the 5-HT-induced relaxation of the human colon with a dose-ratio of 9.9. In the rat oesophagus and rat ileum, DAU 6236 was inactive in the majority of tissues. In the minority of oesophagus tissues that did respond the EC50 value was 1.2 +/- 0.7 microM. DAU 6236 also antagonized the effect of 5-HT in the rat oesophagus in a non-surmountable fashion. SC 53116 relaxed the rat oesophagus with an EC50 value of 91 +/- 4 nM, with an efficacy less than that observed to 5-HT; however, at 200 nM it did not antagonize the 5-HT-induced relaxation of the rat\n\nJackhammer oesophagus in a case of linitis plastica.\n\nPubMed\n\nChaudhry, Naueen Akbar; Zahid, Kamran; Coman, Roxana; Zhang, Qing\n\n2016-05-12\n\nA 52-year-old Caucasian woman presented with progressive nausea and vomiting, weight loss, and burning epigastric and chest pain.

This might impact on the inflammatory processes that are associated with progression of Barrett's oesophagus to cancer, and this may be evident in the gene expression profile and microRNA expression pattern in Barrett's oesophagus mucosa. We hypothesised that two miRNAs with inflammatory and oncogenic roles, miR-101 and miR-196a, are differentially expressed in Barrett's oesophagus epithelium in patients with reflux treated medically vs. surgically. Findings Mucosal tissue was obtained at endoscopy from patients with Barrett's oesophagus whose reflux was controlled by proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (n = 20) or by fundoplication (n = 19). RNA was extracted and the expression of miR-101 and miR-196a was measured using real-time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction. There were no significant differences in miR-101 and miR-196a expression in Barrett's oesophagus epithelium in patients treated by PPI vs. fundoplication (p = 0.768 and 0.211 respectively). Secondary analysis showed a correlation between miR-196a expression and Barrett's oesophagus segment length (p = 0.014). Conclusion The method of reflux treatment did not influence the expression of miR-101 and miR-196a in Barrett's oesophagus. This data does not provide support to the hypothesis that surgical treatment of reflux better prevents cancer development in Barrett's oesophagus. The association between miR-196a expression and Barrett's oesophagus length is consistent with a tumour promoting role for miR-196a in Barrett's oesophagus.

The mucosa-submucosa and muscle layers were separated using microsurgery and studied in vitro using a self-developed test machine. Stepwise elongation and inflation plus continuous twist were applied to the samples. A constitutive equation based on a strain energy function was used for the stress-strain analysis. Five material constants were obtained for both layers. The mucosa-submucosa layer was significantly stiffer than the muscle layer in longitudinal, circumferential and circumferential-longitudinal shear direction. The mechanical constants of the oesophagus show that the oesophageal wall was anisotropic, the stiffness in the longitudinal direction was higher than in the circumferential direction in the intact oesophagus (P < 0.001) and in the muscle layer (P < 0.05). Diabetes-induced pronounced increase in the outer perimeter, inner perimeter and lumen area in both the muscle and mucosa-submucosa layer. The growth of the mucosa-submucosa layer (P < 0.001) was more pronounced than the muscle layer (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the circumferential stiffness of the mucosa-submucosa layer increased 28 days after STZ treatment. In conclusion, the oesophagus is a non-homogeneous anisotropic tube. Thus, the mechanical properties differed between layers as well as in different directions. Morphological and biomechanical remodelling is prominent in the diabetic oesophagus.\n\nCost considerations in implementing a screening and surveillance strategy for Barrett's oesophagus.\n\nPubMed\n\nInadomi, John M\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThere is increasing concern over the rising costs of healthcare leading to debate regarding the use of resources to implement preventive strategies. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma and its precursor, Barrett's oesophagus provides an excellent opportunity to highlight this issue since cancer is uncommon even among individuals with documented Barrett's oesophagus. This review provides a brief introduction to economic analysis in healthcare and summarizes published studies of the cost-effectiveness of strategies to reduce mortality from cancer. Current best estimates highlight the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic ablation among patients with Barrett's oesophagus and high-grade dysplasia and the low cost-effectiveness of ablation among patients without dysplasia. The cost-effectiveness of ablation among patients with Barrett's and low-grade dysplasia is poorly defined due to the ambiguity of diagnosing dysplasia, the unknown risk of cancer among patients with low-grade dysplasia, and the uncertain durability of ablation to maintain remission from metaplasia and dysplasia and prevent cancer.

METHODS: After attending a structured training program in Amsterdam on the endoscopic treatment of dysplastic Barrettâs Oesophagus, treatment of these patients was initiated at St Marys Hospital. This is a retrospective case series conducted at a United Kingdom teaching Hospital, of patients referred for endoscopic treatment of Barrettâs oesophagus with high grade dysplasia or early cancer, who were diagnosed between January 2008 and February 2012. Data was collected on treatment provided (radiofrequency ablation and endoscopic resection), and success of treatment both at the end of treatment and at follow up. Rates of immediate and long term complications were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were referred to St Marys with high grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer within a segment of Barrettâs Oesophagus. Twenty-seven met the study inclusion criteria, 16 of these had a visible nodule at initial endoscopy. Treatment was given over a median of 5 mo, and patients received a median of 3 treatment sessions over this time. At the end of treatment dysplasia was successfully eradicated in 96% and intestinal metaplasia in 88%, on per protocol analysis. Patients were followed up for a median of 18 mo. At which time complete eradication of dysplasia was maintained in 86%. Complications were rare: 2 patients suffered from post-procedural bleeding, 4 cases were complicated by oesophageal stenosis. Recurrence of cancer was seen in 1 case. CONCLUSION: With structured training good outcomes can be achieved in low volume centres treating dysplastic Barrettâs Oesophagus.

We aimed to estimate annual cancer transition rates for patients with long-segment (â¥3â cm), short-segment (â¥1 to <3â cm) and ultra-short-segment (<1â cm) Barrett's oesophagus. We used three data sources to estimate the annual cancer transition rates for each Barrett length category: (1) the distribution of long, short and ultra-short Barrett's oesophagus among a large German cohort with newly diagnosed T1 oesophageal adenocarcinoma; (2) population-based German incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma; and (3) published estimates of the population prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus for each Barrett length category. Among 1017 patients with newly diagnosed T1 oesophageal adenocarcinoma, 573 (56%) had long-segment, 240 (24%) short-segment and 204 (20%) ultra-short-segment Barrett's oesophagus. The base-case estimates for the prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus among the general population were 1.5%, 5% and 14%, respectively. The annual cancer transition rates for patients with long, short and ultra-short Barrett's oesophagus were 0.22%, 0.03% and 0.01%, respectively. To detect one cancer, 450 patients with long-segment Barrett's oesophagus would need to undergo annual surveillance endoscopy; in short segment and ultra-short segment, the corresponding numbers of patients would be 3440 and 12,364. Similar results were obtained when applying US incidence data. The large number of patients, who need to undergo endoscopic surveillance to detect one cancer, raises questions about the value of surveillance endoscopy in patients with short segment or ultra-short segment of Barrett's oesophagus.

METHODS: DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks containing tissue from Barrett's oesophagus (12 samples), low grade dysplasia (15 cases), and adenocarcinoma (14 cases). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the p53, p16, and APC genes was determined by comparing the autoradiographic patterns of several microsatellite markers between the normal tissue and the malignant tissue counterpart. SSCP was used to determine the presence of mutations at p53 (exons 5 to 8), p16 (exon 2), and APC. Homozygous deletion of the p16 gene was defined through polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern blot. RESULTS: LOH at the p53, p16, and APC genes was not observed in Barrett's oesophagus without dysplasia, and increased to 90% (p53), 89% (p16), and 60% (APC) in the adenocarcinomas. The p53 gene was mutated in only two adenocarcinomas (codons 175 and 245). In one case a mutation at the APC gene (codon 1297) was found. No patient had mutation at the second exon of p16. However, this gene was homozygously deleted in three of the 12 adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: The tumour suppressor genes p53, p16, and APC are often deleted in adenocarcinomas derived from Barrett's oesophagus. Mutations at these genes are also found in the adenocarcinomas, including the homozygous deletion of the p16 gene. However, the absence of genetic alterations in the Barrett's oesophagus and the low grade dysplastic epithelia suggest that mutations at these genes develop later in the progression from Barrett's oesophagus to adenocarcinoma.

The presence of metaplastic columnar epithelium with goblet cells on oesophageal biopsy is a marker of cancer progression risk, but it is unclear whether clonal expansion and progression in Barrett's oesophagus is exclusive to columnar epithelium with goblet cells. We developed a novel method to trace the clonal ancestry of an oesophageal adenocarcinoma across an entire Barrett's segment. Clonal expansions in Barrett's mucosa were identified using cytochrome c oxidase enzyme histochemistry. Somatic mutations were identified through mitochondrial DNA sequencing and single gland whole exome sequencing. By tracing the clonal origin of an oesophageal adenocarcinoma across an entire Barrett's segment through a combination of histopathological spatial mapping and clonal ordering, we find that this cancer developed from a premalignant clonal expansion in non-dysplastic ('cardia-type') columnar metaplasia without goblet cells. Our data demonstrate the premalignant potential of metaplastic columnar epithelium without goblet cells in the context of Barrett's oesophagus. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

METHODS: This all-Ireland population-based case-control study recruited 224 Barrettâs oesophagus patients, 227 oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients and 260 controls. All participants underwent a structured interview with information obtained about potential lifestyle and environmental risk factors. RESULTS: Gastro-oesophageal reflux was associated with Barrettâs [OR 12.0 (95% CI 7.64-18.7)] and oesophageal adenocarcinoma [OR 3.48 (95% CI 2.25-5.41)]. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients were more likely than controls to be ex- or current smokers [OR 1.72 (95% CI 1.06-2.81) and OR 4.84 (95% CI 2.72-8.61) respectively] and to have a high body mass index [OR 2.69 (95% CI 1.62-4.46)]. No significant associations were observed between these risk factors and Barrett's oesophagus. Fruit but not vegetables were negatively associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma [OR 0.50 (95% CI 0.30-0.86)]. CONCLUSION: A high body mass index, a diet low in fruit and cigarette smoking may be involved in the progression from Barrettâs oesophagus to oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

Risk of cancer increases substantially with dysplasia, particularly high-grade dysplasia. Thus, there is a clinical need to identify and treat patients with early-stage disease (metaplasia and low-grade dysplasia) that are at high risk of cancer. Activated Wnt signalling is critical for normal intestinal development and homeostasis, but less so for oesophageal development. Therefore, we asked whether abnormally increased Wnt signalling contributes to the development of Barrett's oesophagus (intestinal metaplasia) and/or dysplasia. Forty patients with Barrett's metaplasia, dysplasia or adenocarcinoma underwent endoscopy and biopsy. Mice with tamoxifen- and Î²-naphthoflavone-induced expression of activated Î²-catenin were used to up-regulate Wnt signalling in mouse oesophagus. Immunohistochemistry of Î²-catenin, Ki67, a panel of Wnt target genes, and markers of intestinal metaplasia was performed on human and mouse tissues. In human tissues, expression of nuclear activated Î²-catenin was found in dysplasia, particularly high grade. Barrett's metaplasia did not show high levels of activated Î²-catenin. Up-regulation of Ki67 and Wnt target genes was also mostly associated with high-grade dysplasia. Aberrant activation of Wnt signalling in mouse oesophagus caused marked tissue disorganization with features of dysplasia, but only selected molecular indicators of metaplasia. Based on these results in human tissues and a mouse model, we conclude that abnormal activation of Wnt signalling likely plays only a minor role in initiation of Barrett's metaplasia but a more critical role in progression to dysplasia.

Barrett's oesophagus is the main precursor to oesophageal adenocarcinoma, which has a poor prognosis. In view of the vast potential burden of these diseases on patients and health-care resources, there is a real need to define and focus research efforts. This priority setting exercise aimed to produce a list of the top ten uncertainties in the field that reflect the priorities of patients and health-care providers. We adopted the robust and transparent methodologies previously outlined by the James Lind Alliance. This qualitative approach firstly involves an ideas gathering survey that, once distilled, generates a longlist of research uncertainties. These uncertainties are then prioritised via an interim ranking survey and a final workshop to achieve consensus agreement. The initial 629 uncertainties, generated from a survey of 170 individual respondents (47% professional, 53% non-professional) and one workshop, were narrowed down to the final top ten uncertainties of priority for future research. These priorities covered a range of issues, including a need for improved patient risk stratification, alternative diagnostic and surveillance tests, efficacy of a dedicated service for Barrett's oesophagus, cost-effectiveness and appropriateness of current surveillance, advances in development of non-drug treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, safety of long-term drug treatment, and questions regarding the durability and role of different endoscopic therapies for dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus. This is the first patient-centred assessment of priorities for researchers in this chronic disease setting. We hope that recognition and dissemination of these results will shape the future direction of research and translate into meaningful gains for patients. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To prevent metachronous lesions during follow-up, the remaining Barrett's oesophagus can be removed by stepwise radical endoscopic resection (SRER). The aim was to evaluate the combined experience in four tertiary referral centres with SRER to eradicate Barrett's oesophagus with early neoplasia. Retrospective cohort study. Four tertiary referral centres. 169 patients (151 males, age 64 years (IQR 57-71), Barrett's oesophagus 3 cm (IQR 2-5)) with early neoplasia in Barrett's oesophagus < or = 5 cm, without deep submucosal infiltration or lymph node metastases, treated by SRER between January 2000 and September 2006. Endoscopic resection every 4-8 weeks, until complete endoscopic and histological eradication of Barrett's oesophagus and neoplasia. According to intention-to-treat analysis complete eradication of all neoplasia and all intestinal metaplasia by the end of the treatment phase was reached in 97.6% (165/169) and 85.2% (144/169) of patients, respectively. One patient had progression of neoplasia during treatment and died of metastasised adenocarcinoma (0.6%). After median follow-up of 32 months (IQR 19-49), complete eradication of neoplasia and intestinal metaplasia was sustained in 95.3% (161/169) and 80.5% (136/169) of patients, respectively. Acute, severe complications occurred in 1.2% of patients, and 49.7% of patients developed symptomatic stenosis. SRER of Barrett's oesophagus < or = 5 cm containing early neoplasia appears to be an effective treatment modality with a low rate of recurrent lesions during follow-up. The procedure, however, is technically demanding and is associated with oesophageal stenosis in half of the patients.\n\nLithium battery lodged in the oesophagus: A report of three paediatric cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarabino, Arrigo Vittorio; Gandullia, Paolo; Vignola, Silvia; Arrigo, Serena; Zannini, Lucio; Di Pietro, Pasquale\n\n2015-11-01\n\nOver the last years the ingestion of disk batteries has become frequent in children with serious consequences. The severity of injuries is related to the growing use of new lithium batteries that may cause catastrophic damages when lodged in the oesophagus. The notes of three consecutive children with lithium batteries lodged in the oesophagus, admitted to our Institute from 2010 to 2014, were reviewed. Clinical presentation, management, and outcome were considered. The first child, a 22-month-old girl, died of a sudden exsanguination due to an aorto-oesophageal fistula. The second case, a 5-year-old boy, had an exploratory thoracotomy to exclude aortic lesion before battery removal, and a spontaneous oesophageal perforation. The third child, a 18-month-old boy, fully recovered after suffering ulcerative oesophageal burns. Lithium battery lodged in the oesophagus is a paediatric emergency requiring a multidisciplinary approach that can be implemented in a tertiary children's hospital.

The pharmacological properties of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), the 5-HT4 receptor agonists, DAU 6236 and SC 53116 and the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, GR 1130808, were studied in the rat oesophagus, rat ileum and human colon. 2. 5-HT relaxed the longitudinal muscle of the rat oesophagus and rat ileum and the circular muscle of the human colon. Absolute values of relaxation were measured and showed the order of the maximum responses, rat oesophagus > human colon > rat ileum with EC50 values of 189 +/- 15 nM, 157 +/- 4 nM, 306 +/- 72 nM, respectively. 5-HT also inhibited the spontaneous contractions of the human colon with an EC50 value of 119 +/- 1 nM. The effect of 5-HT on the human colon was not affected by methysergide (10 microM) or ondansetron (1 microM). 3. The use of the uptake and metabolism inhibitors, cocaine (30 microM) and pargyline (100 microM), did not increase the potency of 5-HT in the rat oesophagus or human colon. In the rat oesophagus, cocaine (30 microM) produced a reduction in carbachol-induced tone of 22.2 +/- 0.6% and reduced the 5-HT maximum effect by 52.0 +/- 0.4%. 4. The compounds, DAU 6236 and SC 53116, showed a different pattern of potencies and efficacies in the rat oesophagus, rat ileum and human colon compared to 5-HT. DAU 6236 relaxed the human colonic circular muscle with an EC50 value of 129 +/- 16 nM but its efficacy was less than that of 5-HT. DAU 6236 (1 microM) also antagonized the 5-HT-induced relaxation of the human colon with a dose-ratio of 9.9. In the rat oesophagus and rat ileum, DAU 6236 was inactive in the majority of tissues. In the minority of oesophagus tissues that did respond the EC50 value was 1.2 +/- 0.7 microM. DAU 6236 also antagonized the effect of 5-HT in the rat oesophagus in a non-surmountable fashion. SC 53116 relaxed the rat oesophagus with an EC50 value of 91 +/- 4 nM, with an efficacy less than that observed to 5-HT; however, at 200 nM it did not antagonize the 5-HT-induced relaxation of the rat\n\nLong-term proton pump induced hypergastrinaemia does induce lineage-specific restitution but not clonal expansion in benign Barrett's oesophagus in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nObszynska, Jolanta A; Atherfold, Paul A; Nanji, Manoj; Glancy, Deborah; Santander, Sonia; Graham, Trevor A; Otto, William R; West, Kevin; Harrison, Rebecca F; Jankowski, Janusz A Z\n\n2010-02-01\n\nBarrett's oesophagus is a common premalignant lesion caused partly by acid reflux. Although the requisite therapy, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have been implicated in the progression of Barrett's oesophagus in animal models, harmful effects of prolonged PPI therapy in Barrett's oesophagus is both inconclusive and controversial. We therefore aimed to test the role of PPI-induced hypergastrinaemia in vitro and see whether any biological parameters were useful surrogates of long-term therapy in man. We undertook detailed serological and tissue assessment of gastrin and CCK(2) receptors in 90 patients randomised to different doses of PPI therapy during a detailed 2-year follow-up. We also undertook a comprehensive study of cell models to study the consequential biological effects of gastrin on the mucosa. Gastrin and its cognate receptor CCK(2)R were expressed highest in the stomach, then less in Barrett's oesophagus and least in squamous oesophagus (SqE) (n=20 paired t-test, p<0.01). Analysis of the change in Barrett's oesophagus segment length change in 70 patients who were randomised to high or low PPI dose showed no difference over 2 years (n=70 t-test, p=0.8). Prolonged PPI use did, however, increase the serum gastrin, (36 pg/ml+/-57 pg/ml to 103 pg/ml+/-94 pg/ml (paired t test, p<0.05)). In vitro gastrin also induced changes in OE33(E)(cckr) Barrett's oesophagus cells, but not OE21(E)(cckr) squamous cells, transfected with CCK(2)R; migration was induced by 1 ng/ml of gastrin but proliferation only increased with 100 ng/ml (paired t-test, p<0.01) and both were abolished by antagonists. While the short-term effects of gastrin enhance epithelial restitution in Barrett's oesophagus (but not squamous mucosa) there is no clinical evidence that Barrett's oesophagus length expands over time. This study, which is the largest and longest term randomised controlled trial of gastrin biology in Barrett's oesophagus, is further proof of the clinical safety of PPI therapy.\n\nGenome-wide association studies in oesophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's oesophagus: a large-scale meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGharahkhani, Puya; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C; Vaughan, Thomas L; Palles, Claire; Gockel, Ines; Tomlinson, Ian; Buas, Matthew F; May, Andrea; Gerges, Christian; Anders, Mario; Becker, Jessica; Kreuser, Nicole; Noder, Tania; Venerito, Marino; Veits, Lothar; Schmidt, Thomas; Manner, Hendrik; Schmidt, Claudia; Hess, Timo; BÃ¶hmer, Anne C; Izbicki, Jakob R; HÃ¶lscher, Arnulf H; Lang, Hauke; Lorenz, Dietmar; Schumacher, Brigitte; Hackelsberger, Andreas; Mayershofer, Rupert; Pech, Oliver; Vashist, Yogesh; Ott, Katja; Vieth, Michael; WeismÃ¼ller, Josef; NÃ¶then, Markus M; Attwood, Stephen; Barr, Hugh; Chegwidden, Laura; de Caestecker, John; Harrison, Rebecca; Love, Sharon B; MacDonald, David; Moayyedi, Paul; Prenen, Hans; Watson, R G Peter; Iyer, Prasad G; Anderson, Lesley A; Bernstein, Leslie; Chow, Wong-Ho; Hardie, Laura J; Lagergren, Jesper; Liu, Geoffrey; Risch, Harvey A; Wu, Anna H; Ye, Weimin; Bird, Nigel C; Shaheen, Nicholas J; Gammon, Marilie D; Corley, Douglas A; Caldas, Carlos; Moebus, Susanne; Knapp, Michael; Peters, Wilbert H M; Neuhaus, Horst; RÃ¶sch, Thomas; Ell, Christian; MacGregor, Stuart; Pharoah, Paul; Whiteman, David C; Jankowski, Janusz; Schumacher, Johannes\n\n2016-10-01\n\nOesophageal adenocarcinoma represents one of the fastest rising cancers in high-income countries. Barrett's oesophagus is the premalignant precursor of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. However, only a few patients with Barrett's oesophagus develop adenocarcinoma, which complicates clinical management in the absence of valid predictors. Within an international consortium investigating the genetics of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma, we aimed to identify novel genetic risk variants for the development of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. We did a meta-analysis of all genome-wide association studies of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma available in PubMed up to Feb 29, 2016; all patients were of European ancestry and disease was confirmed histopathologically. All participants were from four separate studies within Europe, North America, and Australia and were genotyped on high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Meta-analysis was done with a fixed-effects inverse variance-weighting approach and with a standard genome-wide significance threshold (p<5âÃâ10 -8 ). We also did an association analysis after reweighting of loci with an approach that investigates annotation enrichment among genome-wide significant loci. Furthermore, the entire dataset was analysed with bioinformatics approaches-including functional annotation databases and gene-based and pathway-based methods-to identify pathophysiologically relevant cellular mechanisms. Our sample comprised 6167 patients with Barrett's oesophagus and 4112 individuals with oesophageal adenocarcinoma, in addition to 17â159 representative controls from four genome-wide association studies in Europe, North America, and Australia. We identified eight new risk loci associated with either Barrett's oesophagus or oesophageal adenocarcinoma, within or near the genes CFTR (rs17451754; p=4Â·8âÃâ10 -10 ), MSRA (rs17749155; p=5Â·2âÃâ10 -10 ), LINC00208\n\nTransitional basal cells at the squamous-columnar junction generate Barrett's oesophagus.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Ming; Li, Haiyan; Zhang, Yongchun; Yang, Ying; Lu, Rong; Liu, Kuancan; Lin, Sijie; Lan, Xiaopeng; Wang, Haikun; Wu, Han; Zhu, Jian; Zhou, Zhongren; Xu, Jianming; Lee, Dong-Kee; Zhang, Lanjing; Lee, Yuan-Cho; Yuan, Jingsong; Abrams, Julian A; Wang, Timothy C; Sepulveda, Antonia R; Wu, Qi; Chen, Huaiyong; Sun, Xin; She, Junjun; Chen, Xiaoxin; Que, Jianwen\n\n2017-10-26\n\nIn several organ systems, the transitional zone between different types of epithelium is a hotspot for pre-neoplastic metaplasia and malignancy, but the cells of origin for these metaplastic epithelia and subsequent malignancies remain unknown. In the case of Barrett's oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous epithelium transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely mimics Barrett's oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Here we describe a transitional columnar epithelium with distinct basal progenitor cells (p63 + KRT5 + KRT7 + ) at the squamous-columnar junction of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage tracing strategies to show that this squamous-columnar junction basal cell population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional epithelium. On ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate into intestinal-like epithelium (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce Barrett's metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar epithelium is present at the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human gut. Acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (believed to be a precursor of Barrett's oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the transitional basal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified transitional zone in the epithelium of the upper gastrointestinal tract and provide evidence that the p63 + KRT5 + KRT7 + basal cells in this zone are the cells of origin for multi-layered epithelium and Barrett's oesophagus.\n\nModulation of salivation and heartburn in response to the site of acid infusion in the human oesophagus.\n\nPubMed\n\nDutta, S K; Agrawal, K; Mahmoud, M A\n\n2010-09-01\n\nThe pathogenesis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease includes increased acid reflux, reduced salivation and impaired peristalsis. This may depend upon the height of acid wave and magnitude of oesophageal mucosal exposure. Interestingly, the effect of site of acid infusion upon salivary secretion and heartburn has not been examined in any detail. To examine whether acid infusion in the upper oesophagus may cause increased salivation and heartburn as compared with acid infusion in the lower oesophagus. Twelve healthy male subjects (mean age 30) received infusions of HCl, citric acid and acetic acid at 10 and 20 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) for fixed time periods. Parotid saliva collected periodically and heartburn severity scored using standardized scale. Standard statistical methods (paired t-tests, analysis of variance) were used to determine the significance of results. Acid infusion in the upper oesophagus increased parotid flow rate as compared with that in the lower oesophagus (P < 0.05). Likewise, there was a significantly increased heartburn score at 20 cm as well as 10 cm above LES (P < 0.05) as compared with that in the stomach. These data suggest a significant increase in salivation and heartburn in response to acid infusion in the upper vs. lower part of the oesophagus. 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\n\nEffect of proton pump inhibitors on markers of risk for high-grade dysplasia and oesophageal cancer in Barrett's oesophagus.\n\nPubMed\n\nHillman, L C; Chiragakis, L; Shadbolt, B; Kaye, G L; Clarke, A C\n\n2008-02-15\n\nIt has been shown that the presence on diagnosi"
