        "text": "The value of a registry negative urine pregnancy test for the prediction of a future unintended pregnancy among young women.\n\nPubMed\n\nRottenstreich, Misgav; Grisaru-Granovsky, Sorina; Rottenstreich, Amihai\n\n2018-06-01\n\nPerformance of urine pregnancy test in general adolescents' clinic reflects caregiver or woman's concern that there might be a pregnancy. We aimed to assess whether young-unmarried women in whom a negative urine pregnancy test was registered would be at increased risk of a future unintended pregnancy. The study cohort included consecutive women drafted by the Israeli military between 2013 and 2015. The risk of unintended pregnancy was compared between women with a negative urine pregnancy test (nâ=â2774), the study group, and those in whom urine pregnancy test was not carried out (nâ=â126,659), the control group. During the study period, 2147 (1.7%) women experienced an unintended pregnancy. The risk of unintended pregnancy was significantly higher in patients in whom a past pregnancy test was negative 4.3% (nâ=â118), as compared with the control group 1.6% (nâ=â2028) (odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.23-3.26). In multivariate analysis history of a negative pregnancy test results was an independent predictor for a future unintended pregnancy (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.63-2.52). A history of a negative pregnancy test among young conscripted women is a significant risk indicator for a future unintended pregnancy. Directed efforts should be made in this particular vulnerable group of patients.\n\n\"Hook-like effect\" causes false-negative point-of-care urine pregnancy testing in emergency patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nGriffey, Richard T; Trent, Caleb J; Bavolek, Rebecca A; Keeperman, Jacob B; Sampson, Christopher; Poirier, Robert F\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFailure to detect pregnancy in the emergency department (ED) can have important consequences. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin (uhCG) point-of-care (POC) assays are valued for rapidly detecting early pregnancy with high sensitivity. However, under certain conditions, POC uhCG tests can fail to detect pregnancy. In investigating a series of late first-trimester false-negative pregnancy tests in our ED, a novel and distinct causative phenomenon was recently elucidated in our institution. We discuss uhCG POC tests, review our false-negative rate, and describe mechanisms for false negatives and potential remedies. The false-negative POC uhCG rate is very low, but in the setting of a large volume of tests, the numbers are worth consideration. In positive uhCG POC tests, free and fixed antibodies bind hCG to form a \"sandwich\"; hCG is present in several variant forms that change in their concentrations at different stages of pregnancy. When in excess, intact hCG can saturate the antibodies, preventing sandwich formation (hook effect phenomenon). Some assays may include an antibody that does not recognize certain variants present in later stages of pregnancy. When this variant is in excess, it can bind one antibody avidly and the other not at all, resulting in a false-negative test (hook-like phenomenon). In both situations, dilution is key to an accurate test. Manufacturers should consider that uhCG tests are routinely used at many stages of pregnancy. Characterizing uhCG variants recognized by their tests and eliminating lot-to-lot variability may help improve uhCG test performance. Clinicians need to be aware of and familiarize themselves with the limitations of the specific type of uhCG POC tests used in their practice, recognizing that under certain circumstances, false-negative tests can occur.

She had an abdominal lump suggestive of 26â weeks uterine size but her urine pregnancy test was negative. Her thyroid profile was suggestive of hyperthyroidism. Gynaecological and ultrasonographic findings revealed a hydatidiform mole. She had a low Î²-human chorionic gonadotropin level that surprisingly increased after suction and evacuation. The paradoxical findings that appeared as erroneous laboratory results could be explained by the 'high-dose hook effect' after a review of literature. One week after the evacuation, the patient's thyroid profile and symptoms resolved completely without any treatment for hyperthyroidism. 2014 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n\nFalse Negative Urine Pregnancy Testing with Complete Molar Pregnancy: An Example of the Hook Effect.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnderson, Zachary; Larson, Eric; Khan, Muhammad; Bell, Maria\n\n2016-02-01\n\nGestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) encompasses a group of tumors derived from trophoblasts, which normally form the placenta during pregnancy. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein composed of an alpha subunit identical to that of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Detection of beta-hCG is achievable in both urine and serum samples, proving useful for the detection of normal pregnancy and GTD. However, in the presence of very high levels of beta-hCG, a false negative result may be obtained due to a phenomenon called the \"hook effect\" or \"prozone phenomenon.\" In certain circumstances, trophoblastic tumors can produce very high levels of beta-hCG, causing misleading results on urine pregnancy testing. A 49-year-old Caucasian female with past medical history pertinent for deep vein thrombosis, ovarian cysts, and osteopenia presented to her internist with report of irregular uterine bleeding for the preceding three months, accompanied by complaints of abdominal bloating, night sweats, and constipation. The patient stated she had completed two negative qualitative urine pregnancy tests and had been seen by both gynecology and gastroenterology, with recommendations to start supplemental estrogen for her symptoms and begin additional fiber intake for irritable bowel syndrome, respectively. Despite negative urine beta-hCG, a quantitative serum beta-hCG was obtained and revealed a level greater than 200,000 international units (IU). The patient was referred to gynecologic oncology and an open abdominal hysterectomy with preservation of her ovaries was performed. Histopathologic examination showed a complete hydatiform mole with no evidence of invasion. The case highlights the importance of clinical judgment in modern medicine, where biochemical methods and imaging modalities have become main stays in diagnosis. As mentioned, there are ways to reduce the incidence of the hook effect, but\n\nThe \"hook effect\" causing a negative pregnancy test in a patient with an advanced molar pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nWinder, Abigail D; Mora, Adria Suarez; Berry, Emily; Lurain, John R\n\n2017-08-01\n\nâ¢At high hCG levels in molar pregnancies, a \"hook effect\" can cause an artificially negative value.â¢Delay in diagnosis of a molar pregnancy due to the \"hook effect\" can lead to severe complications.â¢Suspicion of a molar pregnancy should be communicated so a diluted sample is used to quantify hCG.\n\nSignificance of pregnancy test false negative results due to elevated levels of Î²-core fragment hCG.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, Sarah; Eapen, Saji; Smith, Peter; Warren, Graham; Zinaman, Michael\n\n2017-01-01\n\nVery high levels of Î²-core fragment human chorionic gonadotrophin (Î²cf-hCG) are reported to potentially cause false negative results in point-of-care (POC)/over-the-counter (OTC) pregnancy tests. To investigate this further, women's daily early morning urine samples, collected prior to conception and during pregnancy, were analysed for intact, free Î²-, and Î²cf-hCG. The proportion of Î²cf-hCG was found to be related to that of hCG produced and in circulation. Therefore, best practice for accuracy testing of POC/OTC pregnancy tests would be to test devices against clinical samples containing high levels of Î²cf-hCG as well as standards spiked with biologically relevant ratios.\n\nLong-term ongoing pregnancy rate and mode of conception after a positive and negative post-coital test.\n\nPubMed\n\nHessel, Marloes; Brandes, Monique; de Bruin, Jan Peter; Bots, Rob S G M; Kremer, Jan A M; Nelen, Willianne L D M; Hamilton, Carl J C M\n\n2014-09-01\n\nMany fertility clinics have decided to abolish the post-coital test. Yet, it is a significant factor in prognostic models that predict the spontaneous pregnancy rate within one year. The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) the long-term outcome of infertile couples with a positive or a negative post-coital test during their fertility work-up and (2) the contribution of the different modes of conception. Retrospective cohort study. Three fertility clinics in the Netherlands, of which two are secondary care training hospitals and is a one tertiary care academic training hospital. 2476 newly referred infertile couples, where a post-coital test was performed in 1624 couples. After basic fertility work-up, couples were treated according to the national treatment protocols. Spontaneous and overall ongoing pregnancy rate. The spontaneous and overall ongoing pregnancy rates after three years were 37.7 and 77.5% after a positive post-coital test compared with 26.9 and 68.8% after a negative test (pÂ <Â 0.001). Even in couples with severe male factor infertility (total motile sperm count <3) (pÂ =Â 0.005) and mild male factor infertility (total motile sperm count 3-20) (pÂ <Â 0.001), there was a significantly higher spontaneous ongoing pregnancy rate, justifying expectant management. After a follow-up of three years a positive post-coital test is still associated with a higher spontaneous and a higher overall ongoing pregnancy rate, even in couples with severe male factor infertility.

L.; Fee, R. M.; McNeely, C. A.; Sieving, R. E.; Shew, M. L.; Resnick, M. D.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: The authors surveyed adolescent girls about their feelings regarding pregnancy. METHODS: A survey was administered to 117 13- to 18-year-olds who obtained pregnancy tests at nine clinics in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1998. The survey included four measures of pregnancy feelings. The authors used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine the associations of these measures with engagement with school, future expectations, social and environmental characteristics, and perceived partner desire for pregnancy. RESULTS: The four measures of pregnancy feelings were highly correlated (P = 0.0001). Participants reported a range of positive, negative, and ambivalent feelings on all measures. Perceived partner desire for pregnancy, limited future expectations, and lack of school engagement were significantly associated with positive pregnancy feelings for the four measures. CONCLUSIONS: Successful adolescent pregnancy prevention interventions may include the involvement of partners and key adults as well as strategies to enhance the educational or employment aspirations of girls and adolescents.

Clinical scenario is usually a woman in extremes of reproductive age presenting with amenorrhoea,Â pain and vaginal blood loss; signs derived from high Î²hCG levels may be present (hyperthyroidism, hyperemesis). Diagnosis is basedÂ on a positive pregnancy test - usually a qualitative urinary test. The limitation of this test results from its inability to become positiveÂ in presence of markedly high levels of Î²hCG, saturating the antigens used - known as the 'hook effect'. With the widespread useÂ of gynaecological ultrasound cases of molar pregnancy have been diagnosed in timely fashion. We describe a case referred asÂ a degenerating fibroid, with a negative urinary pregnancy test. Transvaginal ultrasound was highly suggestive of molar pregnancy,Â which was confirmed with a quantitative Î²hCG test, allowing for timely treatment. The importance of a high index of suspicion for thisÂ pathology is tremendous to avoid the devastating consequences of a delayed diagnosis.\n\nThe uriscreen test to detect significant asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nTeppa, Roberto J; Roberts, James M\n\n2005-01-01\n\nAsymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) occurs in 2-11% of pregnancies and it is a clear predisposition to the development of acute pyelonephritis, which, in turn, poses risk to mother and fetus. Treatment of bacteriuria during pregnancy reduces the incidence of pyelonephritis. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for ASB at the first prenatal visit. The gold standard for detection of bacteriuria during pregnancy is urine culture, but this test is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. To determine the reliability of an enzymatic urine screening test (Uriscreen; Savyon Diagnostics, Ashdod, Israel) for detecting ASB in pregnancy. Catheterized urine samples were collected from 150 women who had routine prenatal screening for ASB. Patients with urinary symptoms, active vaginal bleeding, or who were previously on antibiotics therapy were excluded from the study. Sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative predictive values for the Uriscreen were estimated using urine culture as the criterion standard. Urine cultures were considered positive if they grew >10(5) colony-forming units of a single uropathogen. Twenty-eight women (18.7%) had urine culture results indicating significant bacteriuria, and 17 of these 28 specimens had positive enzyme activity. Of 122 samples with no growth, 109 had negative enzyme activity. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the Uriscreen test were 60.7% (+/-18.1), 89.3% (+/-5.6), 56.6%, and 90.8%, respectively. The Uriscreen test had inadequate sensitivity for rapid screening of bacteriuria in pregnancy.\n\nGlucose screening tests during pregnancy\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nOral glucose tolerance test - pregnancy; OGTT - pregnancy; Glucose challenge test - pregnancy; Gestational diabetes - glucose screening ... first step, you will have a glucose screening test: You DO NOT need to prepare or change ...\n\nPrior pregnancy and antenatal rubella sero-negativity-evidence of persistent maternal immunologic alteration?\n\nPubMed\n\nLao, Terence T; Hui, Annie S Y; Sahota, Daljit S\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIt is unclear if the immunologic alterations induced by pregnancy could persist. Antenatal rubella sero-negativity was correlated with gravidity, abortions and parity in 112Â 083 gravidae managed during 1997-2015, with further analysis stratified for factors known to influence rubella serology. The 10.2% sero-negative gravidae had different characteristics, and the incidence showed significant difference and positive trend (P<.001 for both) with gravidity, abortions and parity. The pattern remained consistent when analysis was stratified for advanced age, high body mass index and medical history, but was negated by hepatitis B virus infection except for abortions, and by high body mass index for parity. For gravidity 2-4, no difference in rubella sero-negativity was found between gravidae with all previous pregnancies ended in abortion vs delivery. Prior pregnancies diminished rubella immunity in a dose-dependent manner, which may be a reflection of the cumulative effect of pregnancy-associated maternal immunologic alteration.

Background Current strategy of single HIV test during pregnancy in India can miss new HIV infections acquired after the first test or those HIV infections that were missed in the first test due to a false-negative HIV test. Methods Between August 2011 and April 2013, 9097 pregnant HIV uninfected women were offered a second HIV test near term (34â weeks or beyond) or within 4â weeks of postpartum period. A decision analysis model was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness of a second HIV test in pregnant women near term. Primary and secondary outcome Our key outcome measures include programme cost with addition of second HIV test in pregnant women and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Results We detected 4 new HIV infections in the second test. Thus HIV incidence among pregnant women was 0.12 (95% 0.032 to 0.297) per 100 person women years (PWY). Current strategy of a single HIV test is 8.2 times costlier for less QALYs gained as compared to proposed repeat HIV testing of pregnant women who test negative during the first test. Conclusions Our results warrant consideration at the national level for including a second HIV test of all pregnant women in the national programme. However prior to allocation of resources for a second HIV test in pregnancy, appropriate strategies will have to be planned for improving compliance for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and reducing loss-to-follow-up of those women detected with HIV.

In this prospective observational cohort, women with a confirmed first trimester pregnancy (gestational age <12 weeks) provided a urine sample for diagnosing the viability of their gestation. Pregnancy viability and location testing were confirmed by ultrasound and/or laparoscopy. From 815 eligible patients for the study, 12 were excluded for not having a confirmed pregnancy (n = 6) or were lost to follow-up (n = 6). A total of 803 patients underwent testing and completed follow-up. The pretest probability of an abnormal pregnancy was 44% (9% for ectopic pregnancy and 35% for miscarriage). The test had the following parameters to identify an abnormal first-trimester pregnancy (sensitivity, 13%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10-17; specificity, 82%; 95% CI, 78-86; positive predictive value, 36; 95% CI, 28-46; negative predictive value, 54; 95% CI, 50-58; accuracy, 47%; positive likelihood ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53-1.03; negative likelihood ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1-1.12). The reproducibility of the test in our study was high (kappa index between readers, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77-1). In our emergency setting, we were not able to confirm that the commercial test is adequate to detect or exclude an abnormal first-trimester pregnancy. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Design Cohort study. Subjects Mothers (N = 37, 919) and their infants participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Measurements Maternal negative affectivity assessed pre-partum (SCL-5 at week 17 and 30 of pregnancy), introduction of solid foods by month 3, and feeding of sweet drinks by month 6 (by mothersâ reports). Results Mothers with higher negative affectivity were 64% more likely (95% CI 1.5â1.8) to feed sweet drinks by month 6, and 79% more likely (95% CI 1.6â2.0) to introduce solid foods by month 3. These odds decreased to 41% and 30%, respectively, after adjusting for motherâs age, body mass index, and education. Conclusion The maternal trait of negative affectivity is an independent predictor of infant feeding practices that may be related to childhood weight gain, overweight, and obesity.

Several case reports have described complete hydatidiform moles with false-negative urine qualitative hCG tests. These negative pregnancy tests have been attributed to the hook effect. We report an unusual presentation of a partial mole and review an alternative explanation for the negative hCG test. As partial moles are usually not associated with a large proliferation of trophoblastic cells, levels of hCG are commonly < 100,000 mIU/mL. The most common presentation of a hydatidiform mole is vaginal bleeding. Hydatidiform mole is associated with a risk of malignant transformation and disseminated disease. In a pregnant patient, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are common presentations. Molar pregnancy is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding that should be considered. A 47-year-old female presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Urine qualitative hCG was negative and serum quantitative hCG was 1,094,950 mIU/mL. Pelvic ultrasonography showed a uterine cavity containing a soft-tissue mass with multiple cystic lesions and the hydatidiform mole was extracted with suction curettage. Tissue pathology confirmed partial hydatidiform mole. In addition to the hook effect, we present another possible explanation for the false-negative test; namely the inability of some assays to detect hCG-degradation products, which may be higher in clinical samples from patients with hydatidiform mole. This case underscores the importance of knowing the limitations of the commonly used hCG assays. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Our purpose was to investigate the diagnostic value of single and serial measurement of EPF, especially in the differential diagnosis of abortion and extrauterine pregnancy. Women with a history of 6-16 weeks amenorrhoea with/without vaginal bleeding were included in the prospective study. The EPF-test system was carried out by means of the rosette inhibition method. EPF proved to be always positive in normal pregnant women and always negative in nonpregnant controls. In case of threatened abortion the prognosis was good, when the EPF values were positive, and poor when they became negative. Patients suffering from spontaneous and missed abortion mostly showed negative EPF-values. This was also true in ectopic pregnancies. The sensitivity and specificity of EPF-test system were 83%. The positive predictive value was observed to be 54% and the negative predictive value 95%. The EPF as an early embryonic signal may be a suitable parameter for the clinical use detecting pregnancy disturbances very early.\n\nAbnormal vaginal colonization by gram-negative bacteria is significantly higher in pregnancy conceived through infertility treatment compared to natural pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Ji Y; Sung, Ji-Hee; Chang, Kylie Hae-Jin; Choi, Suk-Joo; Oh, Soo-Young; Roh, Cheong-Rae; Kim, Jong-Hwa\n\n2017-03-01\n\nTo compare abnormal vaginal colonization between natural pregnancy and pregnancy by infertility treatment in high-risk parturient women and to examine the association between abnormal vaginal colonization and early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS). The clinical characteristics, vaginal culture result, and delivery outcome of patients who admitted to our high-risk unit between 2005 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed and compared. We investigated the prevalence of EONS according to maternal vaginal colonization and examined the concordance between maternal vaginal bacteria and etiologic microorganism causing EONS. Among 1096 pregnancies, the rate of vaginal colonization by gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli was significantly higher in pregnancies by infertility treatment after adjustment of confounding variables (E. coli, OR [95% CI]: 2.47 [1.33-4.57], pâ=â0.004). The rate of EONS was significantly higher in neonates with maternal abnormal vaginal bacteria colonization (OR [95% CI]: 3.38 [1.44-7.93], pâ=â0.005) after adjusting for confounding variables. Notably, among microorganisms isolated from maternal vagina, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus were consistent with the results from neonatal blood culture in EONS. Our data implicate a possible association between gram-negative bacteria colonization and infertility treatment and suggest that maternal vaginal colonization may be associated with EONS of neonates in high-risk pregnancy.\n\nRh isoimmunization in Sub-Saharan Africa indicates need for universal access to anti-RhD immunoglobulin and effective management of D-negative pregnancies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOsaro, Erhabor; Charles, Adias Teddy\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTransplacental or fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) may occur during pregnancy or at delivery and lead to immunization to the D antigen if the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive. This can result in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) in subsequent D-positive pregnancies. The aim of this study is to highlight the challenges associated with the effective management and prevention of Rh alloimmunization among Rh-negative women in Sub-Saharan Africa. In most Sub-Saharan African countries, there is poor and sometimes no alloimmunization prevention following potentially sensitizing events and during medical termination of pregnancy in Rh-negative women. Information about previous pregnancies and termination are often lacking in patientsâ medical notes due to poor data management. These issues have made the management of Rh-negative pregnancy a huge challenge. Despite the fact that the prevalence of Rh-negative phenotype is significantly lower among Africans than Caucasians, Rh alloimmunization remains a major factor responsible for perinatal morbidity in Sub-Saharan Africa and may result in the compromise of the womanâs obstetric care due to the unaffordability of anti-D immunoglobulin. There is the urgent need for the implementation of universal access to anti-D immunoglobulin for the Rh-negative pregnant population in Africa. Anti-D immunoglobulin should be available in cases of potentially sensitizing events such as amniocentesis, cordocentesis, antepartum hemorrhage, vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, external cephalic version, abdominal trauma, intrauterine death and stillbirth, in utero therapeutic interventions, miscarriage, and therapeutic termination of pregnancy. There is also the need for the availability of FMH measurements following potentially sensitizing events.

All home pregnancy tests are comparable in accuracy: they differ in cost, type of read out and clarity of instructions. The most important tips to follow are to read directions and to wait 10 days after the missed period. It is best to do 2 tests, to visit a physician if the results differ, to continue contraception even if the first test is negative. Be wary of factors that may influence the result, such as drug intake, stress, weight loss and athletic training. Toxic shock syndrome, indicated by fever above 102 degrees Farenheit, brief rash, very low blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and later by peeling skin on hands and feet, is not associated unduly with using sponges. Those who have had toxic shock, or are menstruating, should not use sponges, nor should anyone wear one for more than 30 hours continuously. Spermicides, whether in foams, suppositories, creams, films or jellies, help to kill organisms causing sexually transmitted gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and pelvic infections. Their effectiveness is increased by consistent use such as adhering strictly to time limitations on the label, tabulated in this newsletter.\n\nFamily planning practices and pregnancy intentions among HIV-positive and HIV-negative postpartum women in Swaziland: a cross sectional survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nWarren, Charlotte E; Abuya, Timothy; Askew, Ian\n\n2013-07-15\n\nIn settings where sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV prevalence is high, the postpartum period is a time of increased biological susceptibility to pregnancy related sepsis. Enabling women living with HIV to avoid unintended pregnancies during the postpartum period can reduce vertical transmission and maternal mortality associated with HIV infection. We describe family planning (FP) practices and fertility desires of HIV-positive and HIV-negative postpartum women in Swaziland. Data are drawn from a baseline survey of a four-year multi country prospective cohort study under the Integra Initiative, which is measuring the benefits and costs of providing integrated HIV and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in Kenya and Swaziland. We compare data from 386 HIV-positive women and 483 HIV-negative women recruited in Swaziland between February and August 2010. Data was collected on hand-held personal digital assistants (PDAs) covering fertility desires, mistimed or unwanted pregnancies and contraceptive use prior to their most recent pregnancy. Data were analysed using Stata 10.0. Descriptive statistics were conducted using the chi square test for categorical variables. Measures of effect were assessed using multivariate fixed effects logistic regression model accounting for clustering at facility level and the results are presented as adjusted odds ratios. Majority (69.2%) of postpartum women reported that their most recent pregnancy was unintended with no differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women: OR: 0.96 (95% CI) (0.70, 1.32). Although, there were significant differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women who reported that their previous pregnancy was unwanted, (20.7% vs. 13.5%, pâ=â0.004), when adjusted this was not significant OR: 1.43 (0.92, 1.91). 47.2% of HIV-positive women said it was mistimed compared to 52.5%, OR: 0.79 (0.59, 1.06). 37.9% of all women said they do not want another child.

Pregnancy is a c ondition which requires skill, medical assistance, and occasionally inte rvention or objective counseling. There are 4 arguments against do-it-y ourself testing: 1) it may be inaccurate or inexpertly done, 2) reagents can be hazardous to the health of users or small children, 3) it fails to save money because confirmation by health professionals is usually required, and 4) the individual may not have access to appropriate healt h care resources. California counties have been providing an increasing volume of tests that have served to encourage earlier prenatal care, earlier and safer pregnancy termination, or attendance at family planning clinics. The success of this program warrants implementation by other state governments.\n\nPredicting Changes in Depressive Symptoms from Pregnancy to Postpartum: The Role of Brooding Rumination and Negative Inferential Styles\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBarnum, Sarah E.; Woody, Mary L.; Gibb, Brandon E.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe current study examined the role of cognitive factors in the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms from pregnancy into the postpartum period. One hundred and one women were assessed for levels of rumination (brooding and reflection), negative inferential styles, and depressive symptoms in their third trimester of pregnancy and depressive symptom levels again at four and eight weeks postpartum. We found that, although none of the three cognitive variables predicted womenâs initial depressive reactions following childbirth (from pregnancy to one month postpartum), brooding rumination and negative inferential styles predicted longer-term depressive symptom changes (from pregnancy to two months postpartum). However, the predictive validity of womenâs negative inferential styles was limited to women already exhibiting relatively high depressive symptom levels during pregnancy, suggesting that it was more strongly related to the maintenance of depressive symptoms into the postpartum period rather than increases in depressive symptoms following childbirth. Modifying cognitive risk factors, therefore, may be an important focus of intervention for depression during pregnancy.

Microscopy is the gold standard in malaria diagnosis, but it has limited detection and availability. When used appropriately, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) could be an ideal diagnostic complement to microscopy, due to their ease of use and adequate sensitivity in detecting even sub-microscopic infections. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is even more sensitive, but it is mainly used for research purposes. The accuracy and reliability of RDTs in diagnosing PAM was evaluated using microscopy and PCR. Methods A cohort of pregnant women in north-eastern Tanzania was followed throughout pregnancy for detection of plasmodial infection using venous and placental blood samples evaluated by histidine rich protein 2 (HRP-2) and parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) based RDTs (Parascreenâ¢) or HRP-2 only (Paracheck PfÂ® and ParaHITÂ®f), microscopy and nested Plasmodium species diagnostic PCR. Results From a cohort of 924 pregnant women who completed the follow up, complete RDT and microscopy data was available for 5,555 blood samples and of these 442 samples were analysed by PCR. Of the 5,555 blood samples, 49 ((proportion and 95% confidence interval) 0.9% [0.7 -1.1]) samples were positive by microscopy and 91 (1.6% [1.3-2.0]) by RDT. Forty-six (50.5% [40.5 - 60.6]) and 45 (49.5% [39.4 â 59.5]) of the RDT positive samples were positive and negative by microscopy, respectively, whereas nineteen (42.2% [29.0 - 56.7]) of the microscopy negative, but RDT positive, samples were positive by PCR. Three (0.05% [0.02 - 0.2]) samples were positive by microscopy but negative by RDT. 351 of the 5,461 samples negative by both RDT and microscopy were tested by PCR and found negative. There was no statistically significant difference between the performances of the different RDTs. Conclusions Microscopy underestimated the real burden of malaria\n\nNew methods of pregnancy testing in adolescent girls.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaxena, B B\n\n1981-05-01\n\nThe knowledge and use of newer, more sensitive, and reliable pregnancy tests which are easily accessible and of moderate cost are the 1st steps in the early diagnosis and management of pregnancy, especially in adolescent girls. Accurate diagnosis of pregnancy soon after conception offers the option of abortion by simple, effective, and inexpensive procedures or early initiation of prenatal maternity care. Discussion focuses on the symptoms of pregnancy and the historical development and basis of pregnancy tests as well as the specific types of pregnancy tests. The most familiar sign of pregnancy is the missed period. Other symptoms that provide presumptive evidence of pregnancy include fatigue and lassitude, increased body temperature, and breast fullness or pain. Feelings of nausea, vomiting, and weight gain may appear after 2 weeks. The diagnosis of pregnancy by the detection of the human chorionic gonadotropin was initially described 53 years ago by Selmar Aschheim and Bernhardt Zondek. Improvements in the techniques for the measurement of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) have been directly related to the progress in the purification and isolation of hCG and elucidation of the amino acid sequence of the hormone-nonspecific alpha subunit and hormone-specific beta subunit of hCG. The history, physical examination, and pregnancy tests will generally provide sufficient information for a definite diagnosis of pregnancy. The presence of hCG in the urine or blood is the most accurate of all the indications of pregnancy. During the last century, 4 different techniques for the determination of hCG in blood and/or urine have been developed. These include the following and are reviewed in detail: 1) bioassays in intact laboratory animals; 2) immunologic tube or slide methods with heme- or latex-agglutination inhibition, as well as the more recently developed competitive protein binding method such as 3) radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the use of radioisotope labeled hormone\n\nComparison of a commercial bovine pregnancy-associated glycoprotein ELISA test and a pregnancy-associated glycoprotein radiomimmunoassay test for early pregnancy diagnosis in dairy cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaren, Aly; Sousa, Noelita Melo De; Beckers, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Bajcsy, ÃrpÃ¡d Csaba; Tibold, JÃ¡nos; MÃ¡dl, IstvÃ¡n; Szenci, OttÃ³\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe present study aimed to compare the accuracy of a commercial PAG-ELISA test (Bovine Preg Test 29) and bovine pregnancy-associated glycoprotein radioimmunoassay (PAG-RIA) for diagnosing pregnancy at Day 28 after insemination in dairy cows. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) was performed in 100 Holstein-Friesian cows at Day 28 after artificial insemination (AI; Day 0) to diagnose pregnancy. After TRUS examination, blood sample was collected from the coccygeal vessels of each cow to measure the concentrations of bPAGs by PAG-RIA test and Bovine Preg Test 29. Milk samples were collected at Days 0, 21 and 28 for measurement of progesterone (P4) by ELISA test. The cows were re-examined by TRUS at Day 42 to confirm the pregnancy diagnoses. The actual gold standard was based on TRUS outcomes at Day 28 that agreed with the outcomes of PAG-RIA test or PAG-ELISA test. If the outcomes of TRUS at Day 28 and PAG-RIA test and PAG-ELISA test did not agree, the gold standard was based on the outcome of TRUS at Day 42. Out of 100 inseminated cows, 41 were confirmed pregnant at Day 28 after AI. Based on the actual gold standard, the sensitivity of TRUS, PAG-ELISA and PAG-RIA tests for diagnosing pregnant cows at Day 28 were 92.7%, 90.2% and 100%, while the specificity of the three tests for diagnosing non-pregnant cows were 91.5%, 98.3% and 94.4%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the three tests were 92%, 95% and 97%, respectively. The degree of agreement (KappaÂ±S.E.) between PAG-RIA and PAG-ELISA test was 0.90 Â±0.04. The degrees of agreement between PAG-RIA and PAG-ELISA and TRUS at Day 28 were 0.80Â±0.05 and 0.76Â±0.06, respectively. In conclusion, the commercial PAG-ELISA test is a highly accurate method for diagnosing early pregnancy in dairy cows on Day 28 after AI and may be used as an alternative method to the TRUS and the PAG-RIA test.

It has moved from detection of pregnancy on the day of missed menstrual bleeding, to detection claims 4 days prior. It is moving from all manual tests to digital tests, with a monitor reading the bands and informing women they are pregnant. A thorough study is needed to investigate the validity of claims and evolving usefulness of devices. Studies were proposed to examine the sensitivity and specificity of home tests and their abilities to detect pregnancy. Methods examined the abilities of tests to detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), hyperglycosylated hCG, free Î²-subunit, a mixture of these antigens in 40 individual early pregnancy urines. Using a mixture of hCG, hyperglycosylated hCG and free Î²-subunit typical for early pregnancy, the sensitivity of the First Response manual and digital tests was 5.5 mIU/mL, while the sensitivities of the EPT and ClearBlue brand manual and digital tests was 22 mIU/mL. On further evaluation, the First Response manual and digital tests both detected 97% of 120 pregnancies on the day of missed menstrual bleeding. The EPT manual and digital devices detected 54% and 67% of pregnancies, respectively, and the ClearBlue manual and digital devices detected 64% and 54% of pregnancies, respectively. First Response manual and digital claim >99% detection on the day of missed menses. The results here suggest similar sensitivity for these two tests. The EPT and ClearBlue manual and digital test make similar >99% claims, the data presented here disputes their elevated claim.\n\nHome Pregnancy Test Kits: How Readable Are the Instructions?\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHolcomb, Carol Ann\n\nAt the conclusion of their study on home pregnancy test kits, Valinas and Perlman (1982) suggested that the instructions accompanying the kits be revised to make them easier to read.

To assess the effects of performing biochemical tests of placental function in high-risk, low-risk, or unselected pregnancies. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (10 May 2012). Controlled trials (randomized or 'quasi-randomized') that compare the use of biochemical tests of placental function in pregnancy with non-use. Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted by the review author. A single eligible trial of poor quality was identified. It involved 622 women with high-risk pregnancies who had had plasma (o)estriol estimations. Women were allocated to have their (o)estriol results revealed or concealed on the basis of hospital record number (with attendant risk of selection bias). There were no obvious differences in perinatal mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 2.13) or planned delivery (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.15) between the two groups. The available trial data do not support the use of (o)estriol estimation in high-risk pregnancies. The single small trial available does not have the power to exclude a beneficial effect but this is probably of historical interest since biochemical testing has been superseded by biophysical testing in antepartum fetal assessment.\n\nAntinuclear Antibodies predict a higher number of Pregnancy Loss in Unexplained Recurrent Pregnancy Loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakthiswary, R; Rajalingam, S; Norazman, M R; Hussein, H\n\nThe etiology of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is unknown in a significant proportion of patients. Autoimmune processes have been implicated in the pathogenesis. The role of antinuclear antibody (ANA) in this context is largely undetermined. In an attempt to address the lack of evidence in this area, we explored the clinical significance of antinuclear antibody (ANA) in unexplained RPL. We studied 68 patients with RPL and 60 healthy controls from September 2005 to May 2012. All subjects were tested for ANA by immunofluorescence testing, and a titer of 1: 80 and above was considered positive. We compared the pregnancy outcome between the ANA positive and ANA negative RPL cases. The incidence of ANA positivity among the cases (35.3%) was significantly higher than the controls (13.3%) (p=0.005). ANA positive cases showed significantly higher number of RPL (p=0.006) and lower number of successful pregnancies (p=0.013) compared to the ANA negative cases . The ANA titre had a significant association with the number of RPL (p<0.05, r=0.724) but not with the number of successful pregnancies (p=0.054). ANA positivity predicts a less favorable pregnancy outcome in RPL. Our findings suggest that the ANA titre is a useful positive predictor of the number of RPL. Hence, ANA test is a potential prognostic tool for this condition which merits further research.\n\nInherited Thrombophilia and Pregnancy Complications: Should We Test?\n\nPubMed\n\nArachchillage, Deepa R J; Makris, Mike\n\n2018-06-04\n\nRecurrent miscarriages and pregnancy-related complications cause significant stress to couples looking for successful pregnancy outcome as well as to health care professionals. There is conflicting evidence with respect to the presence and the strength of associations between inherited thrombophilia and these complications. A complete thrombophilia screen is expensive, and no proven effective treatment for women with recurrent miscarriage and inherited thrombophilia is currently available. Based on the concept of microvascular thrombosis of the placenta, women with recurrent miscarriage and placenta-related complications frequently get treated with antithrombotic therapy. In this narrative review, the authors explore the evolving understanding and evidence of inherited thrombophilia in recurrent miscarriages and other pregnancy complications, and whether antithrombotic treatment would modify pregnancy outcome in women with inherited thrombophilia. Finally, they provide some personal recommendations based on available evidence for clinical practice. In summary, inherited thrombophilia testing is not required outside a clinical trial for women with recurrent pregnancy losses or late pregnancy complications. The presence of thrombophilia markers does not generally indicate additional therapy during pregnancy, even if a heritable thrombophilic defect is found in women with recurrent miscarriages or late pregnancy complications.

Our objective was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the dipslide culture technique to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy and to evaluate the accuracy of nitrate and leucocyte esterase dipslides for screening. This was an ancillary study within a trial comparing single-day with 7-day therapy in treating asymptomatic bacteriuria. Clean-catch midstream samples were collected from pregnant women seeking routine care. Positive and negative likelihood ratios and sensitivity and specificity for the culture-based dipslide to detect and chemical dipsticks (nitrites, leukocyte esterase, or both) to screen were estimated using traditional urine culture as the \"gold standard.\" : A total of 3,048 eligible pregnant women were screened. The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was 15%, with Escherichia coli the most prevalent organism. The likelihood ratio for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria with a positive dipslide test was 225 (95% confidence interval [CI] 113-449), increasing the probability of asymptomatic bacteriuria to 98%; the likelihood ratio for a negative dipslide test was 0.02 (95% CI 0.01-0.05), reducing the probability of bacteriuria to less than 1%. The positive likelihood ratio of leukocyte esterase and nitrite dipsticks (when both or either one was positive) was 6.95 (95% CI 5.80-8.33), increasing the probability of bacteriuria to only 54%; the negative likelihood ratio was 0.50 (95% CI 0.45-0.57), reducing the probability to 8%. A pregnant woman with a positive dipslide test is very likely to have a definitive diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria, whereas a negative result effectively rules out the presence of bacteriuria. Dipsticks that measure nitrites and leukocyte esterase have low sensitivity for use in screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during gestation.

Pregnant women with suspected acute toxoplasmosis referred to the Tuscany Reference Center for Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy during the period 1998-2012 were retrospectively enrolled. All women were tested with a panel of serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgG avidity and IgM IFAT. On the basis of anamnestic, clinical, and serological criteria, pregnant women were classified into three groups: recently infected (RI), latently infected (LI), and doubtful latently infected (DLI). Patients classified as DLI were excluded from the analysis. The association between IgM IFAT (positive or negative) and the diagnosis of infection (acute or chronic) was assessed. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the IgM IFAT were calculated. A total of 810 pregnant women were enrolled in the study: 302 in the RI group and 508 in the LI group. Fifty-two women classified as DLI were excluded. IgM IFAT was positive in 172 out of 302 (56.9%) pregnant women in the RI group and in 29 out of 508 (5.7%) in the LI group. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of IgM IFAT in predicting RI was 85.6% and 78.6%, respectively. IgM IFAT has reasonable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing recent infection and, mostly in case of borderline avidity test, could be considered as a further aid for an accurate diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis in pregnancy.

Questionnaires were distributed to 438 women entering a family-planning clinic in the fall of 1987. A total of 153 questionnaires were completed and returned, providing a response rate of 34.9%. Results indicated that nearly 40% of the respondents had used a home pregnancy-test kit at least once. Of those who had used a home pregnancy-test kit, the majority did so because of \"the speed of obtaining results\" or \"convenience.\" Although nearly 87% of the pregnancy-test kits had been purchased in a pharmacy, pharmacists played only a minor role in the decision-making process concerning purchase and use. Some three-fourths of the subjects listed \"information on the side of the package,\" \"price,\" or \"advertisements\" as the most important factor in the selection of a specific brand of test kit. Only about 7% of the subjects selected \"recommendation of the pharmacist\" as the most important factor. The results suggest that pharmacists could be doing more to promote the appropriate use of self-testing products, specifically home pregnancy-test kits.\n\nEvidence for interplay between genes and maternal stress in utero: monoamine oxidase A polymorphism moderates effects of life events during pregnancy on infant negative emotionality at 5âweeks.\n\nPubMed\n\nHill, J; Breen, G; Quinn, J; Tibu, F; Sharp, H; Pickles, A\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) functional promoter polymorphism, MAOA-LPR, in interaction with adverse environments (GâÃâE) is associated with child and adult antisocial behaviour disorders. MAOA is expressed during foetal development so in utero GâÃâE may influence early neurodevelopment. We tested the hypothesis that MAOA GâÃâE during pregnancy predicts infant negative emotionality soon after birth. In an epidemiological longitudinal study starting in pregnancy, using a two stage stratified design, we ascertained MAOA-LPR status (low vs. high activity variants) from the saliva of 209 infants (104 boys and 105 girls), and examined predictions to observed infant negative emotionality at 5âweeks post-partum from life events during pregnancy. In analyses weighted to provide estimates for the general population, and including possible confounders for life events, there was an MAOA status by life events interaction (Pâ=â0.017). There was also an interaction between MAOA status and neighbourhood deprivation (Pâ=â0.028). Both interactions arose from a greater effect of increasing life events on negative emotionality in the MAOA-LPR low activity, compared with MAOA-LPR high activity infants. The study provides the first evidence of moderation by MAOA-LPR of the effect of the social environment in pregnancy on negative emotionality in infancy, an early risk for the development of child and adult antisocial behaviour disorders.

How do pregnant women fare in the aftermath of a major disaster? This paper investigates the effect of pregnancies in disaster situations. The study tests a hypothesis that pregnant women residing in hurricane-prone areas suffer higher health risks. The setting is Louisiana in the Gulf Coast, United States, a state that continually experiences hurricane impacts. The time period for the analysis is three years following the landfall of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. We analysed low birth weight and preterm deliveries before and after landfall, as a whole and by race. Findings support an association between hazards and health of a community and indicate that pregnant women in the affected area, irrespective of race, are more likely to experience preterm deliveries compared to pre-event births. Results suggest there is a negative health legacy impact in Louisiana as a result of hurricane landfall. Â© 2015 The Author(s).

However, there has been limited study of biological mechanisms underlying behavioral predictors of PPD during pregnancy. Considering the shared etiology of chronic stress amongst antenatal behavioral predictors, the primary goal of this pilot study was to examine associations among stress-related physiological factors (including GABA-ergic neurosteroids) and stress-related behavioral indices of anxiety during pregnancy. Fourteen nulliparous women in their second trimester of a singleton pregnancy underwent speech and mental arithmetic stress, following a 2-week subjective and objective recording of sleep-wake behavior. Lower cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of ALLOâ+âpregnanolone throughout the entire stressor protocol (area under the curve, AUC) were associated with greater negative emotional responses to stress, and lower cortisol AUC was associated with worse sleep quality. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone was associated with greater anxious and depressive symptoms. Stress produced paradoxical reductions in cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of allopregnanoloneâ+âpregnanolone, while tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were elevated. These data suggest that cortisol, progesterone, and ALLOâ+âpregnanolone levels in the second trimester of pregnancy are inversely related to negative emotional symptoms, and the negative impact of acute stress challenge appears to exert its effects by reducing these steroids to further promote negative emotional responses.\n\nPregnancy Intentions and Safer Pregnancy Knowledge Among Female Sex Workers in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nRao, Amrita; Baral, Stefan; Phaswana-Mafuya, Nancy; Lambert, Andrew; Kose, Zamakayise; Mcingana, Mfezi; Holland, Claire; Ketende, Sosthenes; Schwartz, Sheree\n\n2016-07-01\n\nTo assess the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pregnancy intentions and safer conception knowledge among female sex workers in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. This cross-sectional study recruited female sex workers in Port Elizabeth using respondent-driven sampling and completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire alongside HIV testing and counseling. In this secondary analysis, robust Poisson regression was used to model prevalence ratios for positive fertility intentions in this cross-sectional study. Knowledge of safer conception methods by HIV status was compared using Fisher exact tests. Overall 391 women were represented in the analyses. More than 50% had a prior HIV diagnosis, and an additional 12% were diagnosed with HIV during the study. Approximately half (n=185) of the women reported future pregnancy intentions. In univariate analysis, a prior HIV diagnosis was negatively associated with pregnancy intentions as compared with HIV-negative women (prevalence ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.85). Only parity remained independently associated with future pregnancy intentions in multivariate regression after controlling for HIV status, age, race, relationship status, and years selling sex. Knowledge of safer conception methods such as timed sex without a condom, preexposure prophylaxis, or self-insemination was low and similar between those with and without future pregnancy plans. Pregnancy intentions did not significantly vary according to HIV status. Fertility intentions were high, however, and knowledge of safer conception methods low, suggesting a need to provide female sex workers with advice around options to conceive safely in the context of high HIV prevalence.\n\nImplementation of repeat HIV testing during pregnancy in Kenya: a qualitative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRogers, Anna Joy; Weke, Elly; Kwena, Zachary; Bukusi, Elizabeth A; Oyaro, Patrick; Cohen, Craig R; Turan, Janet M\n\n2016-07-11\n\nRepeat HIV testing in late pregnancy has the potential to decrease rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV by identifying mothers who seroconvert after having tested negative for HIV in early pregnancy. Despite being national policy in Kenya, the available data suggest that implementation rates are low. We conducted 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers and managers to explore barriers and enablers to implementation of repeat HIV testing guidelines for pregnant women. Participants were from the Nyanza region of Kenya and were purposively selected to provide variation in socio-demographics and job characteristics. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed in Dedoose software using a thematic analysis approach. Four themes were identified a priori using Ferlie and Shortell's Framework for Change and additional themes were allowed to emerge from the data. Participants identified barriers and enablers at the client, provider, facility, and health system levels. Key barriers at the client level from the perspective of providers included late initial presentation to antenatal care and low proportions of women completing the recommended four antenatal visits. Barriers to offering repeat HIV testing for providers included heavy workloads, time limitations, and failing to remember to check for retest eligibility. At the facility level, inconsistent volume of clients and lack of space required for confidential HIV retesting were cited as barriers. Finally, at the health system level, there were challenges relating to the HIV test kit supply chain and the design of nationally standardized antenatal patient registers. Enablers to improving the implementation of repeat HIV testing included client dissemination of the benefits of antenatal care through word-of-mouth, provider cooperation and task shifting, and it was suggested that use of an electronic health record system could provide automatic reminders for retest eligibility.

Paired results were used from pregnancy diagnosis using transrectal ultrasonography and ELISA for PAG in milk carried out approximately 85 and 100 days after the start of the breeding period, respectively, from 879 cows from four herds in Victoria, Australia. A Bayesian latent class model was used to estimate the proportion of cows pregnant, the Se and Sp of each test, and covariances between test results in pregnant and non-pregnant cows. Prior probability estimates were defined using beta distributions for the expected proportion of cows pregnant, Se and Sp for each test, and covariances between tests. Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations identified posterior distributions for each of the unknown variables. Posterior distributions for each parameter were described using medians and 95% probability (i.e. credible) intervals (PrI). The posterior median estimates for Se and Sp for each test were used to estimate positive predictive and negative predictive values across a range of pregnancy proportions. The estimate for proportion pregnant was 0.524 (95% PrIâ=â0.485-0.562). For pregnancy diagnosis using transrectal ultrasonography, Se and Sp were 0.939 (95% PrIâ=â0.890-0.974) and 0.943 (95% PrIâ=â0.885-0.984), respectively; for ELISA, Se and Sp were 0.963 (95% PrIâ=â0.919-0.990) and 0.870 (95% PrIâ=â0.806-0.931), respectively. The estimated covariance between test results was 0.033 (95% PrIâ=â0.008-0.046) and 0.035 (95% PrIâ=â0.018-0.078) for pregnant and non-pregnant cows, respectively. Pregnancy diagnosis results using transrectal ultrasonography had a higher positive predictive value but lower negative predictive value than results from the\n\nExamining the links between perceived impact of pregnancy, depressive symptoms, and quality of life during adolescent pregnancy: the buffering role of social support.\n\nPubMed\n\nPires, Raquel; AraÃºjo-Pedrosa, Anabela; Canavarro, Maria Cristina\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe aims of the current study were to examine the indirect effect of the perceived impact of pregnancy on quality of life (QoL) through the severity of depressive symptoms among a sample of pregnant adolescents, and to explore whether adolescents' satisfaction with support from their mothers (SM) or partners (SP) was a buffer of this effect. Demographic and pregnancy-related data were collected for 395 pregnant adolescents age 12-19 and were controlled for testing the proposed indirect effect. SM and SP were tested as moderators of the links between perceived impact of pregnancy and depressive symptoms and between depressive symptoms and QoL. A computational tool for path analysis-based moderation and mediation analysis as well as their combination was used to test indirect and interaction effects (PROCESS). A significant indirect effect of the perceived impact of pregnancy on QoL through the severity of depressive symptoms was found (0.51, CI = 0.29/0.78). There was no significant direct effect of the perceived impact of pregnancy on QoL after controlling for the severity of depressive symptoms. SM and SP buffered the indirect effect by weakening the association between a negative perception of the impact of pregnancy and higher severity of depressive symptoms. Identifying adolescents with a negative perception of the impact of pregnancy, improving the quality of their relations with their mothers and partners, and promoting satisfactory support from these figures may be extremely important to prevent and treat depressive symptoms and, in so doing, improve adolescents' QoL during pregnancy.\n\nPatch Test Negative Generalized Dermatitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpiker, Alison; Mowad, Christen\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAllergic contact dermatitis is a common condition in dermatology. Patch testing is the criterion standard for diagnosis. However, dermatitis is not always caused by an allergen, and patch testing does not identify a culprit in every patient. Generalized dermatitis, defined as eczematous dermatitis affecting greater than 3 body sites, is often encountered in dermatology practice, especially patch test referral centers. Management for patients with generalized dermatitis who are patch test negative is challenging. The purpose of this article is to outline an approach to this challenging scenario and summarize the paucity of existing literature on patch test negative generalized dermatitis.\n\n[Smoking in pregnancy - negative impacton mother and child Opinions on nicotine substitution].\n\nPubMed\n\nAdamcovÃ¡, K; DuÅ¡kovÃ¡, M; PaÅÃ­zek, A\n\n2015-08-01\n\nCigarette smoking (tobacco abuse) is legal in the Czech Republic and use of this drug is more or less tolerated there. Argumentation about economic benefits of the production and sale of tobacco products in this country is not responsibly given in context with the level of damage to health. The state does not consistently take into action restrictive measures to prevent this negative phenomenon. Even the medical community adopts an indifferent attitude. Although there have been found countless hard evidence about the harmful effects of smoking on the mother and fetus/baby. Even very small amounts of cigarettes has a negative impact on mother, placental perfusion and ultimately the child. The aim of the article is to describe the pathophysiology of tobacco abuse on mother and baby and to simultaneously open a space for discussion about the treatment of smokers during their pregnancy.\n\nSelf-administered multi-level pregnancy tests in simplified follow-up of medical abortion in Tunisia.\n\nPubMed\n\nDabash, Rasha; Shochet, Tara; Hajri, Selma; Chelli, HÃ©la; Hassairi, Anne-Emmanuele; Haleb, Douha; Labassi, Hayet; Sfar, Ezzedine; Temimi, Fatma; Koenig, Leah; Winikoff, Beverly\n\n2016-07-30\n\nThis study was conducted to assess the efficacy and acceptability of using a multi-level pregnancy test (MLPT) combined with telephone follow-up for medical abortion in Tunisia, where the majority of providers are midwives. Four hundred and four women with gestational ageââ¤â70 days' LMP seeking medical abortion at six study sites were enrolled in this open-label trial. Participants administered a baseline MLPT at the clinic prior to mifepristone administration and were asked to take a second MLPT at home and to call in its results before returning the day of their scheduled follow-up visit 10-14 days later. Almost all women with follow-up (97.1 %, nâ=â332/342) had successful abortions without the need for surgical intervention. The MLPT worked extremely well among women â¤63 days' LMP in ruling out ongoing pregnancy (negative predictive value (NPV) =100 % (nâ=â298/298)) and also detecting women with ongoing pregnancies (sensitivityâ=â100 %; 2/2) as needing follow-up due to non-declining hCG. Among women 64-70 days' LMP, the test also worked well in ruling out ongoing pregnancy (NPVâ=â96.9 % (nâ=â31/32) but not as well in terms of sensitivity (50 %), with only one of two ongoing pregnancies detected by MLPT as needing follow-up. Most women (95.1 %) found the MLPT to be very easy or easy to use and would consider using the MLPT again (97.4 %) if needed. Self-administered pre and post MLPT are very easy for women to use and accurate in assessing medical abortion success up to 63 days' LMP. MLPT use for medical abortion follow-up has the potential to facilitate task sharing services and eliminate the burden of routine in-person follow-up visits for the large majority of women. Additional research is warranted to explore the accuracy of the MLPT in identifying ongoing pregnancy among women with gestational agesâ>â63 days. This study was registered on May 13, 2010, on clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01150279 .\n\nIs routine pregnancy test necessary in women of reproductive age admitted to the emergency department?\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¶ksal, Ozlem; Ozdemir, Fatma; ArmaÄan, Erol; Oner, Nuran; Sert, PÄ±nar Ãinar; Sigirli, Deniz\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to determine the necessity of pregnancy test in women of reproductive age admitted to emergency department (ED) in routine practice. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who presented to the ED between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010 and received a pregnancy test. The median age of 1 586 patients enrolled into the study was 27 years. Of these patients, 19.55% had a positive result of pregnancy test. The most common complaint at admission was abdominal pain in 60.15% of the patients, and pregnancy test was prescribed. 15.83% of the patients with abdominal pain had a positive result of pregnancy test. Of the patients, 30.64% had nausea-vomiting at admission, and 11.52% had a positive result of pregnancy test. When other complaints were considered, the most commonly observed complaints were non-specific symptoms such as dizziness, malaise and respiratory problems. Of the patients, 70.93% were not remembering the date of last menstruation, and 9.51% showed a positive result of pregnancy test. Urinary tract infection (UTI) was commonly diagnosed with an incidence of 17.65%, which was followed by non-specific abdominal pain (NSAP) (16.77%) and gastrointestinal disorders such as gastritis and peptic ulcer (6.87%). Of the patients, 88.40% were discharged from ED, and 11.60% were hospitalized. Pregnancy test should be given to women of reproductive age as a routine practice in ED in developing countries like Turkey.\n\nAre women positive for the One Step but negative for the Two Step screening tests for gestational diabetes at higher risk for adverse outcomes?\n\nPubMed\n\nCaissutti, Claudia; Khalifeh, Adeeb; Saccone, Gabriele; Berghella, Vincenzo\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate if women meeting criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by the One Step test as per International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria but not by other less strict criteria have adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with GDM-negative controls. The primary outcome was the incidence of macrosomia, defined as birthweight >Â 4000Â g. Electronic databases were searched from their inception until May 2017. All studies identifying pregnant women negative at the Two Step test, but positive at the One Step test for IADPSG criteria were included. We excluded studies that randomized women to the One Step vs. the Two Step tests; studies that compared different criteria within the same screening method; randomized studies comparing treatments for GDM; and studies comparing incidence of GDM in women doing the One Step test vs. the Two Step test. Eight retrospective cohort studies, including 29Â 983 women, were included. Five study groups and four control groups were identified. The heterogeneity between the studies was high. Gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and large for gestational age, as well as in some analyses cesarean delivery, macrosomia and preterm birth, were significantly more frequent, and small for gestational age in some analyses significantly less frequent, in women GDM-positive by the One Step, but not the Two Step. Women meeting criteria for GDM by IADPSG criteria but not by other less strict criteria have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and large for gestational age, compared with GDM-negative controls. Based on these findings, and evidence from other studies that treatment decreases these adverse outcomes, we suggest screening for GDM using the One Step IADPSG criteria.

In this prospective case-control study, 168 pregnant women with CIN and cervicitis were diagnosed by colposcopic cervical biopsy. All the cases underwent hybrid capture assay version II (HCII) to detect HR-HPV DNA load amounts and the tests were completed in 3-6 months after childbirth. During pregnancy: as the CIN grade increased, the HR-HPV infection rates increased (P = 0.002), but HR-HPV DNA load amounts (in logarithms) did not change obviously (P = 0.719). 3-6 months postpartum: as the CIN grade increased, the natural negative rate of HR-HPV decreased (P = 0.000), while the amount of HR-HPV DNA (in logarithms) increased (P = 0.036); especially the amount of HR-HPV DNA in pregnant women with CINIII was significantly higher than that of other grades. During pregnancy and 3-6 months postpartum : the amount of HR-HPV DNA (in logarithms) during pregnancy was higher than that of 3-6 months postpartum with the same grade of CIN. The findings emphasize the importance of undergoing the HCII test 3-6 months postpartum. It should be noted that HR-HPV may turn negative in pregnancy with CINIII 3-6 months after childbirth. Further treatments of pregnancy with CIN should be considered according to the CIN grade diagnosed by cervical biopsy via colposcopy 3-6 months after birth, but not according to the persistence of HR-HPV during pregnancy.

In February 2016, CDC recommended 1) routine testing for Zika virus infection of asymptomatic pregnant women living in areas with ongoing local Zika virus transmission at the first prenatal care visit, 2) retesting during the second trimester for women who initially test negative, and 3) testing of pregnant women with signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease (e.g., fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis) at any time during pregnancy (2). To collect information about pregnant women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection* and outcomes in their fetuses and infants, CDC established pregnancy and infant registries (3). During January 1, 2016-April 25, 2017, U.S. territories â with local transmission of Zika virus reported 2,549 completed pregnancies Â§ (live births and pregnancy losses at any gestational age) with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection; 5% of fetuses or infants resulting from these pregnancies had birth defects potentially associated with Zika virus infection Â¶ (4,5). Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika infection identified in the first, second, and third trimesters, the percentage of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8%, 5%, and 4%, respectively. Among liveborn infants, 59% had Zika laboratory testing results reported to the pregnancy and infant registries. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy permits timely and appropriate clinical intervention services (6).\n\nIdiopathic liver function test abnormality in pregnancy is associated with assisted reproduction techniques.\n\nPubMed\n\nKopylov, Uri; Avidan, Benjamin; Papageorgiou, Neofytos P; Katz, Lior H; Sivan, Eyal; Zimlichman, Eyal; Hussein, Haya; Maor, Yaakov\n\n2013-02-01\n\nTo examine the prevalence, etiology, risk factors, and outcomes of liver abnormality in pregnancy, in a tertiary medical center, and to study the potential impact of artificial reproduction techniques (ART) on the incidence and the outcome of pregnancy-related liver abnormality.

Development of significant elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT â¥ 100 IU/L). Secondary outcomes included development of maternal and fetal complications. The upper limit of normal of ALT was â¥ 1.5 times and it occurred in 440 (1.6%) pregnancies; of those, 228 (0.8%) had ALT â¥ 100 IU/L. The etiology of significant liver test abnormality was idiopathic in 47% of patients. Compared with spontaneous pregnancies (295/23,793), ART was significantly associated with liver test abnormality (145/4, 520). The presence of ALT â¥ 100 IU/L in the third trimester was associated with higher rates of cesarean sections, prematurity, low birthweight, and fetal complications. A definite etiology was not determined in about half of pregnancy-associated liver test abnormality. The ART was significantly associated with liver test elevation. Significant liver test abnormality in the third trimester may have an impact on maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes. Copyright Â© 2013 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnosis of vaginal infections in pregnant women using clinical, molecular diagnostic and traditional microbiological culture in a pilot study, to determine the prevalence and association with the development of preterm labor. We performed a nested cross-sectional study composed by 54 women in a cohort of pregnant women in Mexico City. Cervicovaginal infections were evaluated by clinical methods, microbiology culture and a commercially available molecular biology test. Prevalence of cervicovaginal infections during pregnancy was estimated between 28% and 50% according to methodologies. Considering the clinical diagnosis of preterm labor as the gold standard, all diagnostic tests were poor as predictors of preterm labor. Traditional approaches to establish the significance of cervicovaginal infection in pregnancy are exhausted, so be sought new ways to understand this complex relationship. Meanwhile it is recommended to continue to use traditional methods to identify infections during pregnancy in both knowledge of new methods aimed at understanding these relationships are sophisticated.\n\nUnconscious dynamics in twin pregnancy emerging from the LÃ¼scher color test.\n\nPubMed\n\nSavio, Francesca; Zanardo, Vincenzo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo investigate unconscious dynamics in women pregnant with twins, using LÃ¼scher's color test to objectively measure subjective color preferences, and compare them with women with singleton pregnancies. The color test was administered to 50 Italian women with twin pregnancies and 100 women with singleton pregnancies. Both the twin and singleton pregnancy groups said that violet was their favorite color (50 versus 49%) and brown was their least favorite color (52 versus 44%), indicating that they idealized being pregnant, but also found it physically stressful. The twin pregnancy group chose yellow as their second favorite (28 versus 17%) and were most likely to combine it with their first choice of violet (44 versus 19%, p=0.0006), indicating that they were worried about their relationships with their new babies and wanted to give birth soon. In addition, both groups preferred form 6, the sine curve on a dark background, but rejected the associated brown color 6, revealing that the women felt the need to look after themselves. Both groups idealized being pregnant, but also found it physically stressful. However, the twin pregnancy group was afraid of building relationships with their babies and wanted to give birth soon.\n\nHCG administration after endogenous LH rise negatively influences pregnancy rate in modified natural cycle for frozen-thawed euploid blastocyst transfer: a pilot study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLitwicka, Katarzyna; Mencacci, Cecilia; Arrivi, Cristiana; Varricchio, Maria Teresa; Caragia, Alina; Minasi, Maria Giulia; Greco, Ermanno\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate whether in a modified natural cycle (modified-NC) for a frozen-thawed single euploid blastocyst transfer, a critical LH value, above which human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration should be avoided, may be defined. One hundred and sixty-seven patients underwent modified natural cycle in order to transfer a single frozen-thawed euploid blastocyst. All embryos were obtained by intracytoplasmic sperm injection and were biopsied at the blastocyst stage and analyzed by means of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Ovulation was induced using 10.000Â IU hCG when the mean follicle diameter was at least of 17Â mm, independently from LH values. The primary end points were the hCG-positive test and clinical pregnancy. The interim analysis showed that LH value â¥â13Â mIU/ml on the day of hCG injection may negatively influence the clinical results, suggesting that in this condition, it should be advisable waiting for spontaneous ovulation. Among patients who received hCG for ovulation induction, the hCG-positive test and clinical pregnancy rates in modified-NC were significantly lower in cycles with LHââ¥â13Â mIU/ml in respect to those with LHâ<â13Â mIU/ml (45.4 vs 73.3 and 36.4 vs 65.9%, in LHââ¥â13 and LHâ<â13 groups, respectively). In patients with LH value â¥â13Â mIU/ml, hCG administration led to significantly lower rates of hCG-positive test (45.4 vs 74.5% in hCG administration and spontaneous ovulation groups, respectively) and clinical pregnancy (36.4 vs 64.7% in hCG administration and spontaneous ovulation groups, respectively). The baseline patient characteristics were comparable in all groups. The findings of this study highlight that LH elevation â¥â13Â mIU/ml prior to hCG administration may negatively affect clinical pregnancy rates in modified-NC for single euploid blastocyst transfer. The LH determination should be routinely performed during follicular monitoring.

We hypothesized, in a sample of MA heterosexual couples (NÂ =Â 30, 15-17 years), that: 1) within-couple level acculturation discrepancies, and pregnancy/parenting, would predict physical violence perpetration, and 2) that this association would have an indirect effect through couple-level negativity during an observed dyadic video-taped discussion of conflict. Using a path model we found that pregnant/parenting adolescents (BÂ =Â .37, SEÂ =Â .16, pÂ =Â .002), and couples with greater acculturation mismatch resulted in greater couple negativity (BÂ =Â .16, SEÂ =Â .06, pÂ =Â .01), which was associated with self-reported physical violence perpetration (BÂ =Â .41, SEÂ =Â .22, pÂ =Â .02; indirect effect, BÂ =Â .15, SEÂ =Â .07, pÂ =Â .03). Within-couple acculturation discrepancies and pregnancy/parenting may be a pathway to dating violence through poor communication skills around conflict for MA youth. Support services that strengthen communication skills, particularly for pregnant/parenting couples, are recommended. Copyright Â© 2016 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

However, there are few validated measures of individual-level perceptions of norms and stigma around pregnancy decisions. Additionally, little is known about variation in the content of norms regarding pregnancy decisions, and in stigma related to violations of these norms, across socio-demographic groups. Methods To create measures of perceived norms and stigma around pregnancy decisions, we developed and pre-tested 97 survey items using a mixed methods approach. The resulting survey was administered to 642 young adult women recruited from health department clinics and a public university campus in Birmingham, Alabama. Principal components factor analyses, reliability analyses, independent t-tests, and correlation analyses were conducted to establish the reliability and validity of scales. Additionally, multiple linear regression was used to identify demographic predictors of higher scale scores. Results Factor analyses revealed four subscales for each pregnancy decision: conditional acceptability, anticipated reactions, stereotypes/misperceptions, and attitudes. The total scales and their subscales demonstrated good internal reliability (alpha coefficients 0.72â0.94). The mean scores for each scale were significantly associated with each other, with related measures, and differed by sociodemographic characteristics. Specifically, in adjusted analyses, women in the university setting and White women expressed more negative attitudes and stigma around parenting. Minority women endorsed more negative norms and stigma around adoption. Finally, women from the health department, White women, and religious women expressed more negative norms and stigma around abortion. Conclusion Findings suggest that our multidimensional measures have good psychometric properties\n\nAssociations of Adolescent Hopelessness and Self-Worth With Pregnancy Attempts and Pregnancy Desire\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFedorowicz, Anna R.; Schreiner, Pamela J.; Bolland, John M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjectives. We examined the associations of pregnancy desire (ambivalence or happiness about a pregnancy in the next year) and recent pregnancy attempts with hopelessness and self-worth among low-income adolescents. Methods. To evaluate independent associations among the study variables, we conducted gender-stratified multivariable logistic regression analyses with data derived from 2285 sexually experienced 9- to 18-year-old participants in the Mobile Youth Survey between 2006 and 2009. Results. Fifty-seven percent of youths reported a desire for pregnancy and 9% reported pregnancy attempts. In multivariable analyses, hopelessness was positively associated and self-worth was negatively associated with pregnancy attempts among both female and male youths. Hopelessness was weakly associated (Pâ=â.05) with pregnancy desire among female youths. Conclusions. The negative association of self-worth and the positive association of hopelessness with pregnancy attempts among young men as well as young women and the association of hopelessness with pregnancy desire among young women raise questions about why pregnancy is apparently valued by youths who rate their social and cognitive competence as low and who live in an environment with few options for material success.

Data regarding assisted reproductive technologies were readily available from seven enrollment sites participating in an external clinical validation trial of nested case/control design. Measurements of circulating cell-free fetal and total DNA, fetal fraction (ratio of fetal to total DNA), chromosome-specific z-scores, and karyotype results were available for analysis. Analyses were restricted to 632 euploid (5.2% assisted reproductive technologies) and 73 Down syndrome (13.7% assisted reproductive technologies), including 16 twin pregnancies. No differences were found for fetal or total circulating cell-free DNA, or for the fetal fraction in euploid (P = 0.70) or Down syndrome (P = 0.58) pregnancies by method of conception. There appeared to be systematic z-score reductions for chromosomes 21, 18, and 13 in assisted reproductive technologies versus natural euploid pregnancies (P = 0.048, 0.0032, and 0.36, respectively). Assisted reproductive technologies and naturally conceived pregnancies contribute similar levels of circulating cell-free DNA into maternal circulation. Small differences in the z-scores of pregnancies achieved by assisted reproductive technologies were observed and do not appear to be test-related artifacts. However, the findings need confirmation before any consideration of changes to testing and reporting protocols.\n\nBringing the pregnancy test home from the hospital.\n\nPubMed\n\nRobinson, Joan H\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThis paper explores the settlement process of one of the most common home diagnostic tools currently in use, the home pregnancy test. The controversial new device appeared to threaten the jurisdiction of both doctors and Food and Drug Administration regulations, while it aligned with the women's health movement's goals. But this study finds a more nuanced narrative: one of boundaries and positions that at once were blurry, late"
