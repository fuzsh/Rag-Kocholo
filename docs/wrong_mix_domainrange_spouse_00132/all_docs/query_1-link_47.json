Ballistic data and practical management].\n\nPubMed\n\nVicq, P; Jourdan, P; Chapuis, O; Baranger, B\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe mortality from abdominal gunshot wounds remains high, either in civilian or military cases. The severity factors of these wounds include bullet calibre and energy transfer of the missile. This paper studies some of the ballistics features of abdominal gunshot wounds. Practical guidelines are inferred concerning diagnosis and treatment of these wounds.\n\nPenetrating abdominal gunshot wounds caused by high-velocity missiles: a review of 51 military injuries managed at a level-3 trauma center.\n\nPubMed\n\nGorgulu, Semih; Gencosmanoglu, Rasim; Akaoglu, Cuneyt\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to present the outcomes of military penetrating abdominal gunshot injuries, to identify factors that predict morbidity, and to compare the present results with those from two civilian trauma centers. Fifty-one consecutive patients who had suffered high-velocity gunshot wounds to the abdomen were assessed retrospectively. Penetrating abdominal trauma index, the number of injured organs, and the presence of colonic injury were significantly associated with high morbidity by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that only the number of organs injured and presence of colonic injury were independent predictors of morbidity. Our results showed that military rifle bullets do not cause greater tissue disruption than that found in wounds created by lower-velocity projectiles. The presence of colonic injury and the number of organs injured (more than three) seem to be important predictors of morbidity in penetrating abdominal gunshot wounds caused by high-velocity missiles.\n\nFacial gunshot wound debridement: debridement of facial soft tissue gunshot wounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nShvyrkov, Michael B\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOver the period 1981-1985 the author treated 1486 patients with facial gunshot wounds sustained in combat in Afghanistan. In the last quarter of 20th century, more powerful and destructive weapons such as M-16 rifles, AK-47 and Kalashnikov submachine guns, became available and a new approach to gunshot wound debridement is required. Modern surgeons have little experience in treatment of such wounds because of rare contact with similar pathology. This article is intended to explore modern wound debridement. The management of 502 isolated soft tissue injuries is presented. Existing principles recommend the sparing of damaged tissues. The author's experience was that tissue sparing lead to a high rate of complications (47.6%). Radical primary surgical debridement (RPSD) of wounds was then adopted with radical excision of necrotic non-viable wound margins containing infection to the point of active capillary bleeding and immediate primary wound closure. After radical debridement wound infection and breakdown decreased by a factor of 10. Plastic operations with local and remote soft tissue were made on 14, 7% of the wounded. Only 0.7% patients required discharge from the army due to facial muscle paralysis and/or facial skin impregnation with particles of gunpowder from mine explosions.

Because of the prevalence of gunshot injuries, it is important that orthopaedic surgeons are knowledgeable about caring for them. The most common injuries seen with gunshot wounds are those of the soft tissues. Nonsurgical management of patients who have gunshot wounds with minimal soft-tissue disruption has been successfully accomplished in emergency departments for several years; this includes extremity wounds without nerve, intra-articular, or vascular injury. Stable, nonarticular fractures of an extremity have also been successfully treated with either minimal surgical or nonsurgical methods in the emergency department. Indications for surgical treatment include unstable fractures, intra-articular injuries, a significant soft-tissue injury (especially with skin loss), vascular injury, and/or a large or expanding hematoma.\n\nManagement of gunshot wounds to the mandible.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeleg, Michael; Sawatari, Yoh\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThe gunshot wound to the mandible is a unique traumatic injury. The resultant injury from the gunshot wound is diverse because of the variability of the projectile, motion, velocity, and tissue characteristics. When a high-velocity projectile strikes the mandible, often times the wound will consist of a severely comminuted mandible surrounded by nonvital soft tissues and the implantation of multiple foreign bodies. This represents a challenge for the treating surgeon. The anatomy and function of the mandible make it such that the care of the gunshot wound requires a combination of trauma and reconstructive surgeries. There are varying techniques advocated for the management of gunshot wound to the face. However, for the comminuted mandible fracture sustained from a gunshot wound, an approach involving the fabrication of an occlusal splint, intermaxillary fixation, aggressive debridement of hard and soft tissues, and immediate reconstruction with a titanium plate is a comprehensive approach that can restore the appropriate function and contour of the patient. At the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Miami, this approach to the comminuted mandible fracture secondary to the gunshot wound has led to the effective management of this specific subset of injury. The complication rate is comparable with the current literature and provides an advantage as a 1-stage management to restore appropriate function and cosmesis to the patient.\n\nMissile pulmonary embolus secondary to abdominal gunshot wound.\n\nPubMed\n\nMctyre, Emory; McGill, Lee; Miller, Nessa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMissile pulmonary emboli are rare sequelae of traumatic entry of projectile missiles-generally bullets or bullet fragments-in which access to the systemic venous circulation is established by the missile, making it possible for the missile to migrate to the pulmonary arteries. In the case introduced here, a 24-year-old male presented to the ER with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. In the early course of his care, it was determined that he had suffered a missile pulmonary embolus secondary to a large fragment of a bullet penetrating the IVC. Despite the large perfusion defect created by this missile embolus, the patient recovered uneventfully without embolectomy.\n\n[Epidemiology of gunshot wounds at Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua General Hospital].\n\nPubMed\n\nMoye-Elizalde, G A; Ruiz-MartÃ­nez, F; Suarez-SantamarÃ­a, J J; Ruiz-RamÃ­rez, M; Reyes-Gallardo, A; DÃ­az-Apodaca, B A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSince 2007, Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua has been considered as one of the most violent cities in the world. The General Hospital in this city is the main facility where patients with gunshot wounds are taken. The increased number of admissions of patients with these injuries to many hospitals in the country deserves special attention, as it has an impact on hospital resources and management protocols. To disseminate the epidemiology of fractures caused by gunshot wounds and the hospital care of these patients. A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted of patients admitted to the Traumatology and Orthopedics Service, Cd. JuÃ¡rez General Hospital, in Chihuahua, Mexico, from January 2008 to December 2010. All of them sustained fractures resulting from gunshot wounds. A total of 1281 patients with a diagnosis of gunshot wounds were admitted to the hospital; 402 of them were included in this study with 559 fractures; 329 were males and 73 females. Of the 559 fractures, 257 involved the upper limb, 294 the lower limb, and 8 the pelvis. Gunshot wounds-related fractures were classified according to the Gustilo classification. Seventy-nine patients had grade I fractures, 302 grade III, and 21 patients had both grades. Conservative treatment was used in 44.3% of fractures and osteosynthesis in 55%. One patient underwent amputation upon admission. The most widely used osteosynthesis methods were external fixator (37%), straight plates (21%) and intramedullary nail (17%). Five patients (1.3%) underwent amputation: two with femur fracture and 3 with humeral fracture. There were 27 deep infections (6%); one of them resulted in late amputation of the pelvic limb. The most common associated injuries included: chest injuries in 20 patients and abdominal injuries in 17. The range of hospital stay was 1-18 days, with a mean stay of 11 days. The overall mortality rate considering the total number of patients admitted (1,281) was 99 patients (7.72%). From 2006 to 2010 the\n\nExtremity gunshot wound and gunshot fracture in civilian practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nHennessy, M J; Banks, H H; Leach, R B; Quigley, T B\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThe civilian gunshot wound is a low velocity injury. Temporary cavitation does not occur in the low velocity wound and damage is confined to the projectile pathway. Extensive debridement is not indicated for this injury. Surgical cleansing is used to convert the open, contaminated wound to a clean, closed wound. Reparative and definitive reconstruction then follow to restore form and function with minimized patient hazard.\n\nThe utility of routine histological examination of gunshot wounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerez, Danielo B; Molina, D Kimberley\n\n2012-09-01\n\nDetermining the range of fire is a crucial part of a forensic examination of gunshot wound victims. Traditionally, this has been accomplished by noting the gross appearance of soot or powder around the wound. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of routine histological examination of gunshot wounds as related to range-of-fire determination. A prospective study was performed, and a total of 69 gunshot wounds were examined both macroscopically and microscopically. Of the 45 entrance wounds examined, there was 100% concordance between macroscopic and microscopic analysis for the close-range wounds and 67% concordance for the distant wounds, with 33% of these wounds showing no evidence of soot or powder grossly but where residue was seen microscopically. In addition, 21% of the exit wounds examined showed microscopic evidence of soot/powder residues when none were visible macroscopically. As described in previous studies, it can be assumed that the bullet itself can deposit small residues along the wound track (bullet wipe) that can be seen microscopically and is unrelated to the range of fire. Therefore, the authors conclude there is no utility in the routine histological examination of gunshot wounds for the determination of range of fire.\n\nExamination of Ricochet Gunshot Wounds From Commonly Encountered Surfaces.\n\nPubMed\n\nHlavaty, Leigh; Avedschmidt, Sarah; Root, Kelly; Amley, Jeffrey; Sung, LokMan\n\n2016-12-01\n\nProper interpretation of gunshot wounds is vital for the forensic pathologist and requires experience and expertise, as well as consultation with a firearms and ballistics expert and careful scene investigation in cases of atypical gunshot wounds. This study is the first large-series examining ricochet gunshot wounds involving different firearm calibers. Typical gunshot wounds created from 4 handgun calibers (22 Long Rifle, 9 Ã 19 mm Parabellum, .40 Smith &Wesson, and .45 Automatic Colt Pistol) and 2 rifle calibers (5.56 and 7.62 mm) were compared with wounds caused by bullets of those same calibers ricocheting off commonly encountered surfaces (concrete, asphalt, aluminum traffic signs, clay brick, and dry wall). Porcine skin, a human skin analog, attached to sheets of cardboard serviced as witness panels for capturing the entrance wounds. Examination of over 150 handgun and rifle entrance wounds established that every caliber and every ricochet surface resulted in atypical features, including irregularity in size or shape, lack of marginal abrasion, or other injuries on the surrounding skin. The most significant factor influencing the variability of the ricochet wounds was the surface the bullet deflected off before striking the body.\n\nInjuring mechanisms of gunshot wounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nWhite, K M\n\n1989-03-01\n\nThe severity of injury in a gunshot wound is dependent on many factors, including the type of firearm; the velocity, mass, and construction of the bullet; and the structural properties of the tissues that are wounded. Knowledge of ballistics and an appreciation of the wounding potential of certain firearms and their ammunition can help clinicians anticipate the severity of a wound and raise the index of suspicion for occult but severe internal trauma.\n\nImproving survival rates after civilian gunshot wounds to the brain.\n\nPubMed\n\nJoseph, Bellal; Aziz, Hassan; Pandit, Viraj; Kulvatunyou, Narong; O'Keeffe, Terence; Wynne, Julie; Tang, Andrew; Friese, Randall S; Rhee, Peter\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGunshot wounds to the brain are the most lethal of all firearm injuries, with reported survival rates of 10% to 15%. The aim of this study was to determine outcomes in patients with gunshot wounds to the brain, presenting to our institution over time. We hypothesized that aggressive management can increase survival and the rate of organ donation in patients with gunshot wounds to the brain. We analyzed all patients with gunshot wounds to the brain presenting to our level 1 trauma center over a 5-year period. Aggressive management was defined as resuscitation with blood products, hyperosmolar therapy, and/or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). The primary outcome was survival and the secondary outcome was organ donation. There were 132 patients with gunshot wounds to the brain, and the survival rates increased incrementally every year, from 10% in 2008 to 46% in 2011, with the adoption of aggressive management. Among survivors, 40% (16 of 40) of the patients had bi-hemispheric injuries. Aggressive management with blood products (p = 0.02) and hyperosmolar therapy (p = 0.01) was independently associated with survival. Of the survivors, 20% had a Glasgow Coma Scale score â¥ 13 at hospital discharge. In patients who died (n = 92), 56% patients were eligible for organ donation, and they donated 60 organs. Aggressive management is associated with significant improvement in survival and organ procurement in patients with gunshot wounds to the brain. The bias of resource use can no longer be used to preclude trauma surgeons from abandoning aggressive attempts to save patients with gunshot wound to the brain.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the reconstruction methods in 12 patients with gunshot wound-related mandibular and maxillofacial bony and soft tissue defects. Twelve patients who were operated on for maxillofacial gunshot wounds at our clinic between 2002 and 2012 were included in the study. Seven patients were wounded in a suicide attempt, and 5 were wounded as a result of an accident or in assaults. Two patients underwent reconstruction using free fibula osteocutaneous flap, 4 patients received the free radial forearm osteocutaneous flap, 2 patients received costal bone graft, and 3 patients received iliac bone grafts. Satisfactory functional and aesthetic outcomes were achieved in cases where staged secondary reconstruction, balloon treatment, and consecutive fat and steroid injections into the depressed scar areas were applied. In conclusion, the basic goal in maxillofacial reconstruction is the functional and aesthetic reconstruction of the contours. Because it is not easy to get perfect results with only 1 clinical approach or 1 method, the proper timing and reconstruction method should be selected.\n\nDifferences in the element contents between gunshot entry wounds with full-jacketed bullet and lead bullet.\n\nPubMed\n\nWunnapuk, Klintean; Durongkadech, Piya; Minami, Takeshi; Ruangyuttikarn, Werawan; Tohno, Setsuko; Vichairat, Karnda; Azuma, Cho; Sribanditmongkol, Pongruk; Tohno, Yoshiyuki\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTo elucidate characteristics of gunshot residues in gunshot entry wounds with full-jacketed and lead bullets, element contents in entry gunshot wounds and control skins were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). It was found that a high content of Fe and Zn was deposited in the gunshot entry wounds with full-jacketed bullet, whereas a high content of Pb was deposited in the gunshot entry wounds with lead (unjacked) bullet. It should be noted that the content of Pb was significantly higher in the gunshot entry wounds with lead bullet than in those with full-jacketed bullet. Regarding the relationships among elements, it was found that there were significant direct correlations between Pb and either Sb or Ba contents in both gunshot entry wounds with full-jacketed and lead bullets. As Pb increased in both gunshot entry wounds, Sb and Ba also increased in the wounds.\n\n[Gangrene of the right colon after blast injury caused by abdominal gunshot wounds].\n\nPubMed\n\nIgnjatoviÄ, Dragan; MisoviÄ, Sidor; JevtiÄ, Miodrag\n\n2005-06-01\n\nTo present a patient with an indirect secondary non-perforating blast injury of the right colon following abdominal gunshot injury, which led to necrosis and the right colon gangrene, and was surgically managed. A 26-year-old male was shot in the abdomen by four projectiles causing the secondary indirect blast injury of the right colon that turned into gangrene after 24 hours. Two days after admission, laparotomy was performed, but the primary anastomosis was not done because of the stomach and pancreatic injury, and the resection of the colon with terminal ileostomy was done instead. Three months later, the reconstruction of the colon was performed using ileocolotransverso-terminolatetral anastomosis. Secondary blast injuries should be anticipated in gunshot injuries, and could be expected to any organs, particularly the air filled ones.\n\nAide memoire for the management of gunshot wounds.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMacFarlane, C.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe hospitals in Johannesburg deal with about 4,000 gunshot wounds a year. Although most are from hand guns, a number are from high velocity, military-type weapons. Extensive experience has been built up and many lessons learned. Attention is directed to the actual damage inflicted rather than on theoretical predictions based on presumed velocity of the bullets involved, as this can often be misleading. Some patients are delayed in their presentation to emergency departments, in other cases several gunshot wound patients arrive at the same time, requiring appropriate triage and urgent management. PMID:12215024\n\nMicro-CT features of intermediate gunshot wounds severely damaged by fire.\n\nPubMed\n\nFais, Paolo; Giraudo, Chiara; Boscolo-Berto, Rafael; Amagliani, Alessandro; Miotto, Diego; Feltrin, Giampietro; Viel, Guido; Ferrara, S Davide; Cecchetto, Giovanni\n\n2013-03-01\n\nIncineration or extensive burning of the body, causing changes in the content and distribution of fluids, fixation and shrinking processes of tissues, can alter the typical macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of firearm wounds, hampering or at least complicating the reconstruction of gunshot fatalities. The present study aims at evaluating the potential role of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) for detecting and quantifying gunshot residue (GSR) particles in experimentally produced intermediate-range gunshot wounds severely damaged by fire. Eighteen experimental shootings were performed on 18 sections of human calves surgically amputated for medical reasons at three different firing distances (5, 15 and 30Â cm). Six stab wounds produced with an ice pick were used as controls. Each calf section underwent a charring cycle, being placed in a wood-burning stove for 4Â min at a temperature of 400Â Â°C. At visual inspection, the charred entrance wounds could not be differentiated from the exit lesions and the stab wounds. On the contrary, micro-CT analysis showed the presence of GSR particles in all burnt entrance gunshot wounds, while GSR was absent in the exit and stab wounds. The GSR deposits of the firearm lesions inflicted at very close distance (5Â cm) were mainly constituted of huge particles (diameter >150Â Î¼m) with an irregular shape and well-delineated edges; at greater distances (15 and 30Â cm), agglomerates of tiny radiopaque particles scattered in the epidermis and dermis layers were evident. Statistical analysis demonstrated that also in charred firearm wounds the amount of GSR roughly correlates with the distance from which the gun was fired. The obtained results suggest that micro-CT analysis can be a valid screening tool for identifying entrance gunshot wounds and for differentiating firearm wounds from sharp-force injuries in bodies severely damaged by fire.\n\nEffects of decomposition on gunshot wound characteristics: under moderate temperatures with insect activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nMacAulay, Lauren E; Barr, Darryl G; Strongman, Doug B\n\n2009-03-01\n\nPrevious studies document characteristics of gunshot wounds shortly after they were inflicted. This study was conducted to determine if the early stages of decomposition obscure or alter the physical surface characteristics of gunshot wounds, thereby affecting the quantity and quality of information retrievable from such evidence. The study was conducted in August and September, 2005 in Nova Scotia, Canada in forested and exposed environments. Recently killed pigs were used as research models and were shot six times each at three different ranges (contact, 2.5 cm, and 1.5 m). Under these test conditions, the gunshot wounds maintained the characteristics unique to each gunshot range and changes that occurred during decomposition were not critical to the interpretation of the evidence. It was concluded that changes due to decomposition under the conditions tested would not affect the collection and interpretation of gunshot wound evidence until the skin was degraded in the late active or advanced decay stage of decomposition.\n\n[Gunshot and stab wounds in Germany--epidemiology and outcome: analysis from the TraumaRegister DGUÂ®].\n\nPubMed\n\nBieler, D; Franke, A F; Hentsch, S; Paffrath, T; Willms, A; Lefering, R; Kollig, E W\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe management of gunshot wounds is a rare challenge for trauma surgeons in Germany and Central Europe as a result of the low incidence of this type of trauma. Penetrating injuries occur with an incidence of 5% in Germany. They are caused by gunshots or more commonly by knives or other objects, for example during accidents. Since even the number of patients who are treated at level 1 trauma centres is limited by the low incidence, the objective of this study was to assess the epidemiology and outcome of gunshot and stab wounds in Germany. Since 2009, the trauma registry of the German Trauma Society (TraumaRegisterÂ DGUÂ®) has been used to assess not only whether a trauma was penetrating but also whether it was caused by a gunshot or a stabbing. On the basis of this registry, we identified relevant cases and defined the observation period. Data were taken from the standard documentation forms that participating German hospitals completed between 2009 and 2011. We did not specify exclusion criteria in order to obtain as comprehensive a picture as possible of the trauma entities investigated in this study. As a result of the high incidence of gunshot wounds to the head and the implications of this type of injury for the entire group, a subgroup of patients without head injuries was analysed. From 2009 to 2011, there were 305 patients with gunshot wounds and 871Â patients with stab wounds. The high proportion of suicide-related gunshot wounds to the head resulted in a cumulative mortality rate of 39.7%. Stab wounds were associated with a lower mortality rate (6.2%). Every fourth patient with a gunshot or stab wound presented with haemorrhagic shock, which was considerably more frequently seen during the prehospital phase than during the inhospital phase of patient management. Of the patients with gunshot wounds, 26.9% required transfusions. This percentage was three times higher than that for patients with blunt trauma. In Germany, gunshot and stab wounds have a low\n\n[Management of suicidal orbital gunshot wounds to the temple].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchargus, M; Kawa, D; Elling, M; Kunkel, M\n\n2014-10-01\n\nOrbital gunshot wounds are rarely found after suicide. A gunshot fired at point blank range into the temple has devastating effects on all intraorbital and neighboring structures. This article reports on two cases of gunshot wounds to the lateral orbit in attempted suicides with different weapons from 2012 and 2013 and treated at the Ruhr University Eye Hospital in Bochum. In both cases treatment was carried out in cooperation with the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, Ruhr University Hospital, Bochum. In the first case a 7.65 mm gun was used. The patient presented with a double penetration of both orbits with total destruction of both globes and a reconstruction was not possible. The second patient presented with multiple shots to the head from a small caliber gun (5.6 mm) where one bullet entered the right orbit behind the globe. The bullet could be localized using computed tomography (CT) and surgically removed with preservation of the globe and with a postoperative visual acuity of 20/60. The preservation of visual function after orbital gunshot wounds depends on both the projectile channel and the characteristics of the gun and bullet. Close collaboration in surgical management between ophthalmologists, maxillofacial surgeons and neurosurgeons in specialized centers is necessary because patients often present with multiple trauma and prompt interdisciplinary treatment is needed.\n\nDiscrimination of bullet types using analysis of lead isotopes deposited in gunshot entry wounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nWunnapuk, Klintean; Minami, Takeshi; Durongkadech, Piya; Tohno, Setsuko; Ruangyuttikarn, Werawan; Moriwake, Yumi; Vichairat, Karnda; Sribanditmongkol, Pongruk; Tohno, Yoshiyuki\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn order to discriminate bullet types used in firearms, of which the victims died, the authors investigated lead isotope ratios in gunshot entry wounds from nine lead (unjacketed) bullets, 15 semi-jacketed bullets, and 14 full-jacketed bullets by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. It was found that the lead isotope ratio of 207/206 in gunshot entry wounds was the highest with lead bullets, and it decreased in order from full-jacketed to semi-jacketed bullets. Lead isotope ratios of 208/206 or 208/207 to 207/206 at the gunshot entry wound were able to discriminate semi-jacketed bullets from lead and full-jacketed ones, but it was difficult to discriminate between lead and full-jacketed bullets. However, a combination of element and lead isotope ratio analyses in gunshot entry wounds enabled discrimination between lead, semi-jacketed, and full-jacketed bullets.\n\nGunshot residue patterns on skin in angled contact and near contact gunshot wounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlattner, T; Kneubuehl, B; Thali, M; Zollinger, U\n\n2003-12-17\n\nThe goal of this study was the reproduction of shape and pattern of gunshot residues in near contact and contact gunshot wounds by a series of experimental gunshots on a skin and soft tissue model. The aim was to investigate the shape and direction of soot deposits with regard to the muzzle according to different muzzle-target angles, firing distances, type of ammunition and weapon and barrel length. Based on a review of the literature and on the results of the experiments the authors could make the following statements of gunshot residues in angled contact and close contact gunshot: (1) gunshot residues on the target surface can be differentiated in a \"inner\" and \"outer powder soot zone\"; (2) the outer powder soot zone is much less visible than the inner powder soot zone and may lack on human skin; (3) with increasing muzzle target distance both inner and outer powder soot halo increase in size and decrease in density; (4) in angled shots the inner powder soot halo shows an eccentric, elliptic shape which points towards the muzzle, regardless of ammunition, calibre and barrel length; (5) the outer powder soot points away from the muzzle in angled contact and close contact shots.\n\nDynamic simulation and preliminary finite element analysis of gunshot wounds to the human mandible.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Zhen; Tu, Wenbing; Zhang, Gang; Chen, Yubin; Lei, Tao; Tan, Yinghui\n\n2012-05-01\n\nDue to the complications arising from gunshot wounds to the maxillofacial region, traditional models of gunshot wounds cannot meet our research needs. In this study, we established a finite element model and conducted preliminary simulation and analysis to determine the injury mechanism and degree of damage for gunshot wounds to the human mandible. Based on a previously developed modelling method that used animal experiments and internal parameters, digital computed tomography data for the human mandible were used to establish a three-dimensional finite element model of the human mandible. The mechanism by which a gunshot injures the mandible was dynamically simulated under different shot conditions. First, the residual velocities of the shootings using different projectiles at varying entry angles and impact velocities were calculated. Second, the energy losses of the projectiles and the rates of energy loss after exiting the mandible were calculated. Finally, the data were compared and analysed. The dynamic processes involved in gunshot wounds to the human mandible were successfully simulated using two projectiles, three impact velocities, and three entry angles. The stress distributions in different parts of mandible after injury were also simulated. Based on the computation and analysis of the modelling data, we found that the injury severity of the mandible and the injury efficiency of the projectiles differ under different injury conditions. The finite element model has many advantages for the analysis of ballistic wounds, and is expected to become an improved model for studying maxillofacial gunshot wounds.

In this study, the real frequency of such a peculiar feature was investigated. The presence of \"chipping\" was assessed on 22 gunshot wounds fired at a near-contact range on bovine ribs with 9-mm bullets. As controls, five samples were shot with a 3 cm range, and five from 40 cm. In 77% of cases shot at near-contact range, a detachment of small fragments of the upper layers of bone was detected, mainly with a circumferential disposition, whereas this feature was lacking in control samples. The study demonstrated the frequency of \"chipping\" and that it may probably be due to a combined ballistic effect of impact of the bullet itself and expansion of gases. It may be thus considered indicative of close-range shots. Â© 2016 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.\n\nGunshot wounds to the thigh. Evaluation of vascular and subclinical vascular injuries.\n\nPubMed\n\nPayne, W K; Gabriel, R A; Massoud, R P\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA retrospective review of 173 patient charts, angiograms, surgical reports, and plain radiographs were performed for all patients admitted with gunshot wounds to the thigh from May 1988 to January 1991 at Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital. A zonal classification of gunshot wounds to the thigh was created and defined to determine if a zonal classification was predictive of a positive angiogram.

We aim to detect the possibility of treatment without surgery and present our experience in selected cases referred from Syria to a hospital at the Turkish-Syrian border. Between February 2012 and June 2014, patients admitted with abdominal gunshot wounds were analyzed. Computed tomography was performed for all patients on admission. Patients who were hemodynamically stable and did not have symptoms of peritonitis at the time of presentation were included in the study. The primary outcome parameters were mortality and morbidity. Successful selective non-operative management (Group 1) and unsuccessful selective non-operative management (Group 2) groups were compared in terms of complications, blood transfusion, injury site, injury severity score (ISS), and hospital stay. Of 158 truncal injury patients, 18 were considered feasible for selective non-operative management. Of these, 14 (78%) patients were treated without surgery. Other Four patients were operated upon progressively increasing abdominal pain and tenderness during follow-up. On diagnostic exploration, all of these cases had intestinal perforations. No mortality was observed in selective non-operative management. There was no statistically significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2, in terms of length of hospital stay (96 and 127 h, respectively). Also, there was no difference between groups in terms of blood transfusion necessity, injury site, complication rate, and injury severity score (p>0.05). Decision making on patient selection for selective non-operative management is critical to ensure favorable outcomes. It is not possible to predict the success of selective non-operative management in advance. Cautious clinical examination and close monitoring of these\n\nEstablishment of swine-penetrating craniocerebral gunshot wound model.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Huchen; Wang, Lian; Zhong, Wuzhao; Qi, Rongfeng; Li, Ning; You, Wanchun; Su, Xingfeng; Zhuang, Zong; Cheng, Huilin; Shi, Jixin\n\n2015-12-01\n\nBullet-induced brain wounds are common among military personnel in war zones and among civilians with gun accidents or crime-related gun injuries. The goal of this study was to develop a nonfatal porcine model of penetrating craniocerebral gunshot wound (PCGW) by firing a projectile in live swine to induce PCGW in such a realistic manner as to reconstruct their physical characteristics. We established a nonfatal porcine model of PCGW based on a custom-designed experimental gun that emulates the shooting of a 5.56-mm NATO standard rifle at 800 m (317 m/s; 200.9 J). Commercial swine (n = 20) were subjected to a ballistic wound to the bilateral frontal lobe, and four swine were used as controls. Surviving swine were used in subsequent first-aid, management, and monitoring experiments for neurosurgeons. Various physiological variables were measured continuously. After computed tomography (CT) scanning and three-dimensional CT reconstructions, all pigs underwent primary lifesaving emergency interventions, including emergency decompressive craniotomies and hemorrhage control. In our nonfatal porcine model of PCGW, injuries were comparable in their morphology to real gunshot wounds, as evidenced by analysis of wound characteristics and CT scan images. The survival rates of the pigs were 100% within 2 h, 95% within 6 h, 85% within 12 h, and 85% within 24 h (P < 0.01). Hemodynamics, hematology, blood routine biochemistry, coagulation, and other physiological parameters also exhibited significant changes in the PCGW pigs. This model makes possible the laboratory reproduction of real ballistic wounds in a live large animal model that is close to humans. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to identify the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of these injuries in a mature trauma system with decreasing prehospital time intervals. Patients admitted to a large urban Level 1 trauma centre between 1/2006 and 12/2010 sustaining a firearm injury to the torso were identified. Transmediastinal gunshot wounds were defined as missile tracts traversing the mediastinum identified on CT images, operative notes or autopsy reports. Overall, 133 patients met study criteria. A total of 116 patients (87.2%) were haemodynamically unstable or had no vital signs on arrival to the Emergency Department. Ninety-seven (83.6%) of these patients required a resuscitative thoracotomy resulting in 8 survivors (6.0%). There were 17 haemodynamically stable patients (12.8%) identified, 14 of whom underwent CT scan evaluation. Six patients subsequently required operative intervention. Only 11 patients (8.3%) in the study population were successfully managed nonoperatively. The overall mortality was 78.9%, and for those who reached the hospital with vital signs, the mortality was 24.3%. Transmediastinal gunshot wounds encountered in a mature trauma centre are highly lethal injuries requiring resuscitative thoracotomy in most instances. Changing perspectives in these injuries may reflect the effects of an evolving prehospital care. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The behavior of all bullets is unpredictable but the specific effect of high velocity projectiles has been a particular source of confusion in the literature. This confusion has resulted in the likely incorrect conclusion that all high velocity wounds require massive dÃ©bridement. We reviewed the entirety of the literature on this subject and concluded that high velocity weapons do not reliably create massive wounds, and judicious dÃ©bridement and staged explorations may be the best treatment method for these patients. A MEDLINE search and retrieval were done of all pertinent references from 1966 to May 2003 concerning the field of wound ballistics. Articles initially missed in this search were obtained from the bibliography of retrieved studies. More than 70 articles and book chapters were reviewed. Five common myths about the tissue effects of gunshot wounds were reviewed as well as the data that dispel these myths. Information on the effects of different bullet types, and the intended and actual effect of military rifle wounds were assessed. For the majority of high velocity gunshot wounds, especially military rifles that generally fire a projectile that is meant to stay intact after impact, wound severity can be limited, even much less than that from a civilian rifle, shotgun or handgun. Judicious use of dÃ©bridement during surgical exploration limits the extent of iatrogenic injury in the surgical care of these patients.\n\nExperimental closure of gunshot wounds by fibrin glue with antibiotics in pigs.\n\nPubMed\n\nDjeniÄ, NebojÅ¡a; ViÅ¡njiÄ, Milan; DragoviÄ, SaÅ¡a; BojaniÄ, Vladmila; BojaniÄ, Zoran; DjurdjeviÄ, Dragan; DjindjiÄ, Boris; Kostov, MiloÅ¡\n\n2015-09-01\n\nGunshot wounds caused by the automatic rifle M70AB2 (AK-47) 7.62 mm, after the primary surgical management, were closed with delayed primary suture during the next four to seven days. This period coincides with the fibroblastic phase of wound healing. Fibrin glue is used as a local hemostatic and as a matrix for the local dosed release of antibiotics. Antibiotics addition to fibrin glue resulted in continuous diffusion into the surrounding next 4 to 7 days. The aim of this study was to create the preconditions for gunshot wounds closing without complications by the application of fibrin glue with antibiotics 24 h after primary surgical treatment. A total of 14 pigs were wounded in the gluteofemoral region by the bullet M67, initial velocity of 720 m/s. All wounded animals were surgically treated according to the principles of the war-surgery doctrine. Seven wounds were closed with primary delayed suture four days after the primary surgical treatment (traditional approach). Fibrin glue with antibiotics was introduced in seven wounds during the primary surgical treatment and primary delayed suture was done after 24 h. The macroscopic appearance and the clinical assessment of the wound were done during the primary surgical treatment and during its revision after 24 h, as well as histopathological findings at the days 4 and 7 after wounding. Gunshot wounds caused by the automatic rifle M70AB2 (AK-47) 7.62 mm, and treated with fibrin glue with antibiotics after primary surgical management, were closed with primary delayed suture after 24 h. In further wound evolution there were no complications. Uncomplicated soft-tissue wounds caused by an automatic M70AB2 rifle may be closed primarily with delayed suture without the risk of developing complications if on revision, 24 h after primary surgery, there were no present necrotic tissues, hematoma, and any signs of infection when fibrin glue with antibiotics (ceftriaxone and clindamycin) was applied. The use of this method\n\nCivilian gunshot wounds to the head with brain stem localization. A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nVerlicchi, A; Facchin, P; Zanotti, B\n\n1998-12-01\n\nThe authors present a case of a patient wounded to the head and back by civilian firearm projectiles. The case peculiarity is that only one bullet reached the brain stem level causing significant neurological deficits. The final clinical picture is comparable to the \"caudal pontine tegmentum syndrome\". The authors describe both the bullet path and the intracranial localization taking into account ballistic details. The problems associated with prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment for gunshot wounds are discussed. In addition, the authors explain the main intracranial lesions and their mechanisms, the role of investigation, and the protocol of medical and surgical treatment. Lastly, a systematic approach for treating these types of gunshot wounds is outlined.\n\nAbdominal Trauma Revisited.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeliciano, David V\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAlthough abdominal trauma has been described since antiquity, formal laparotomies for trauma were not performed until the 1800s. Even with the introduction of general anesthesia in the United States during the years 1842 to 1846, laparotomies for abdominal trauma were not performed during the Civil War. The first laparotomy for an abdominal gunshot wound in the United States was finally performed in New York City in 1884. An aggressive operative approach to all forms of abdominal trauma till the establishment of formal trauma centers (where data were analyzed) resulted in extraordinarily high rates of nontherapeutic laparotomies from the 1880s to the 1960s. More selective operative approaches to patients with abdominal stab wounds (1960s), blunt trauma (1970s), and gunshot wounds (1990s) were then developed. Current adjuncts to the diagnosis of abdominal trauma when serial physical examinations are unreliable include the following: 1) diagnostic peritoneal tap/lavage, 2) surgeon-performed ultrasound examination; 3) contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis; and 4) diagnostic laparoscopy. Operative techniques for injuries to the liver, spleen, duodenum, and pancreas have been refined considerably since World War II. These need to be emphasized repeatedly in an era when fewer patients undergo laparotomy for abdominal trauma. Finally, abdominal trauma damage control is a valuable operative approach in patients with physiologic exhaustion and multiple injuries.\n\nCivilian duodenal gunshot wounds: surgical management made simpler.\n\nPubMed\n\nTalving, Peep; Nicol, Andrew J; Navsaria, Pradeep H\n\n2006-04-01\n\nLow-velocity gunshot wounds cause most civilian duodenal injuries. The objective of this study was to describe a simplified surgical algorithm currently in use in a South African civilian trauma center and to verify its validity by measuring morbidity and mortality. A retrospective chart review of patients with duodenal gunshot injuries during the study period January 1999 to December 2003 was performed. Data points accrued included patient demographics, admission hemodynamic status and resuscitative measures, laparotomy damage control procedures, methods of surgical repair of the duodenal injury, associated injuries, length of intensive care and hospital stays, complications, and mortality. A total of 75 consecutive patients with gunshot injuries to the duodenum were reviewed. Primary repair was performed in 54 patients (87%), resection and reanastomosis in 7 (11%), and pancreatoduodenectomy in 1 (2%) during the initial phases. The overall morbidity and mortality were 58% and 28%, respectively. Duodenum-related complications were recorded in nine (15%) patients: two duodenal fistulas, one duodenal obstruction, and six cases of suture-line dehiscence. Overall and duodenum-related morbidity rates in patients with combined pancreatoduodenal injuries were 83% and 17%, respectively. Duodenum-related mortality occurred in three (4.8%) patients. Most civilian low-velocity duodenal gunshot injuries treated with simple primary repair result in overall morbidity, mortality, and duodenum-related complication rates comparable to those in reports where more complex surgical procedures were employed. Primary repair is also applicable for most combined pancreatic and duodenal gunshot injuries.\n\nEvaluation and management of gunshot wounds of the penis: 20-year experience at an urban trauma center.\n\nPubMed\n\nKunkle, David A; Lebed, Brett D; Mydlo, Jack H; Pontari, Michel A\n\n2008-04-01\n\nAlthough gunshot injuries to the penis occur relatively infrequently in patients with penetrating trauma, they often present dilemmas of subsequent evaluation and management. We review our extensive experience with gunshot wounds to the penis at a high volume urban trauma center. The urologic trauma database was retrospectively reviewed to extract and compile information from the records of 63 patients treated for gunshot wounds to the penis. Data were accumulated for a 20-year period from 1985 to 2004 with regard to findings on physical examination, diagnostic evaluation, associated injuries, management, and outcome. We detail our technique of penile exploration and artificial erection in the management of these injuries. Penile gunshot wounds were associated with additional injuries in 53 of 63 (84%) patients. A total of 48 (76%) patients were taken to the operating room and 44 (70%) penile explorations were performed. Evaluation included retrograde urethrogram in 50 of 63 (79%) patients and was diagnostic for urethral injury in 11 of 12 (92%) cases. Primary urethral repair was performed in 8 of 12 (67%) patients with urethral injury versus 4 of 12 (33%) who underwent urinary diversion by means of suprapubic cystotomy. Evaluation and management of gunshot wounds to the penis may potentially be complex. Retrograde urethrogram should be performed in all cases except the most insignificant and superficial wounds. We describe our technique of penile exploration and artificial erection, noting excellent results in patients for whom follow-up is available. Additional studies are needed to prospectively evaluate techniques for management of gunshot urethral injuries.\n\nShored gunshot wound of exit. A phenomenon with identity crisis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAguilar, J C\n\n1983-09-01\n\nShored gunshot wound of exit is produced when the outstretched skin is impaled, sandwiched, and crushed between the outgoing bullet and the unyielding object over the exit site, thus leaving an abrasion collar on the wound margin. Proper coaptation of the wound margin is impossible because of the loss of skin just like those observed in entrance wounds. In contrast to the entrance wound, the supported exit wound shows a scalloped or punched-out abrasion collar and sharply contoured skin in between the radiating skin lacerations marginating the abrasion (Fig. 1). Should gunpowder be observed around the exit site, it is often unevenly distributed, and is not associated with searing, gunpowder stippled abrasion, tatooing, and deposition of soot.\n\nSimulating backspatter of blood from cranial gunshot wounds using pig models.\n\nPubMed\n\nRadford, G E; Taylor, M C; Kieser, J A; Waddell, J N; Walsh, K A J; Schofield, J C; Das, R; Chakravorty, E\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFew studies have examined the biomechanical basis for backspatter from cranial gunshot wounds. Backspatter is material which travels against the direction of fire following ejection from a gunshot entrance wound. Our paper focuses on the use of animals for reconstructing this phenomenon. Five live pigs and several slaughtered pigs were shot using either 9âÃâ19Â mm, 115 grain, full metal jacketed ammunition or .22 long rifle, 40 grain, lead, round-nose ammunition. A high-speed camera was used to record the entrance wound formation and backspatter. A small amount of backspattered material was produced with all targets, and blood backspatter was seen in a few cases. However, we conclude that our model provides an understanding of the phenomenon of backspatter and the physical mechanisms associated with it. The various components of the mechanism of backspatter formation are complex and overlap. The principle mechanism observed in pig cranial gunshots was the high-speed impact response of the skin overlying the skull bone. This study has also produced evidence supporting the view that backspatter can result from the splashing of superficial blood if it is already present on the skin. Subcutaneous gas effects have been demonstrated for backspatter from contact shots. There has been no clear evidence of the role of the collapse of a temporary cavity within the brain.\n\nFacial Gunshot Wounds: Trends in Management\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKaufman, Yoav; Cole, Patrick; Hollier, Larry H.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFacial gunshot wounds, often comprising significant soft and bone tissue defects, pose a significant challenge for reconstructive surgeons. Whether resulting from assault, accident, or suicide attempt, a thorough assessment of the defects is essential for devising an appropriate tissue repair and replacement with a likely secondary revision. Immediately after injury, management is centered on advanced trauma life support with patient stabilization as the primary goal. Thorough examination along with appropriate imaging is critical for identifying any existing defects. Whereas past surgical management advocated delayed definitive treatment using serial debridement, todayâs management favors use of more immediate reconstruction. Recent advances in microsurgical technique have shifted favor from local tissue advancement to distant free flap transfers, which improve cosmesis and function. This has resulted in a lower number of surgeries required to achieve reconstruction. Because of the diversity of injury and the complexity of facial gunshot injuries, a systematic algorithm is essential to help manage the different stages of healing and to ensure that the best outcome is achieved. PMID:22110801\n\nInpatients with gunshot wounds to the face.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Gordon H; Patil, Yash J; Harmych, Brian M; Hom, David B\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMicrovascular free tissue transfer (FTT) is an increasingly used method of reconstruction for traumatic defects of the head and neck. We describe the immediate management, FTT reconstruction techniques, and outcomes of 6 individuals who sustained maxillofacial gunshot trauma and were treated at a single tertiary-care level I trauma center. All 6 patients were white men with a mean age of 33 years. The mandible, nose, and orbital contents were the most frequently affected critical structures. All patients initially underwent primary wound debridement and tracheostomy, with concurrent maxillomandibular wire fixation and/or midface or mandible plate fixation in 5 patients. The mean time from injury to definitive FTT was 38 days. Five patients underwent fibula osteocutaneous FTT and 1 underwent radial forearm fasciocutaneous FTT. One patient also underwent concurrent local tissue rearrangement and pedicled flap surgery for nasal reconstruction. The mean hospital length of stay after FTT was 6 days. All FTT survived without necrosis. Oral incompetence and poor cosmesis from undesirable scarring patterns were the most common long-term complications. In summary, successful reconstruction of head and neck defects caused by gunshot trauma begins with airway stabilization, wound management, and bony fracture reduction and fixation. Definitive microvascular FTT is a useful method of repairing traumatic head and neck defects, although long-term functional and cosmetic complications may still occur.\n\nTraumatic brain injury due to gunshot wounds: a single institution's experience with 442 consecutive patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSolmaz, Ilker; Kural, Cahit; Temiz, CaÄlar; SeÃ§er, Halil Ibrahim; DÃ¼z, BÃ¼lent; GÃ¶nÃ¼l, Engin; Izci, Yusuf\n\n2009-07-01\n\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by a gunshot wound is a complex injury with a broad spectrum of symptoms and high rates of mortality and morbidity. This study presents an evaluation of TBI caused by gunshot wounds presenting at a single institution and discusses possible predictive factors for the outcome of surgical intervention. The study sample consisted of 442 patients who underwent surgery for TBI over a 16-year period. All injuries were caused by gunshot wounds, such as bullets and shrapnel. All patients underwent surgical intervention. Almost all patients (99.3%) were male, and the mean patient age was 22.3 years. Wounds were caused by shrapnel in 68 percent of patients. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at admission was below 8 in 116 patients (26.2%) and above 8 in 326 patients (73.8%). In total, 47 patients (10.6%) died despite surgical management, with diffuse brain injury the most common cause of death. Low GCS scores, ventricular injuries and bihemispheric injuries are correlated with poor prognosis. Early and less invasive surgery in conjunction with short transportation time to the hospital could decrease mortality rates.\n\nGunshot wounds to the hand. The Martin Luther King, Jr, General Hospital experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nPhillips, P; Hansraj, K K; Cox, E E; Ashley, E M\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThis article is a retrospective review of patients who presented to Martin Luther King, Jr./Drew Medical Center with gunshot wounds and had either isolated or associated injuries to the hand. The following is an account of those injuries noting the location, soft-tissue or bony involvement, and interventional methods that were implemented in the treatment of these patients who resided primarily in South Central Los Angeles. Prompt evaluation and initiation of treatment is essential in the management of both high- and low-velocity gunshot wounds so as to decrease the potential morbidity that often follows. Society must also look at the prevalence of these injuries and address the underlying issues that often are the root of the acts of violence.\n\nCivilian gunshot wounds to the atlantoaxial spine: a report of 10 cases treated using a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nSyre, Peter; Rodriguez-Cruz, Leonardo; Desai, Rajiv; Greene, Karl A; Hurst, Robert; Schuster, James; Malhotra, Neil R; Marcotte, Paul\n\n2013-12-01\n\nGunshot wounds to the atlantoaxial spine are uncommon injuries and rarely require treatment, as a bullet traversing this segment often results in a fatal injury. Additionally, these injuries are typically biomechanically stable. The authors report a series of 10 patients with gunshot wounds involving the lateral mass and/or bodies of the atlantoaxial complex. Their care is discussed and conclusions are drawn from these cases to identify the optimal treatment for these injuries. A retrospective review was conducted of patients presenting to the emergency rooms of 3 institutions with gunshot wounds involving the atlantoaxial spine. Mechanism of injury and neurological status were obtained, as was the extent of the osteoligamentous, vascular, and neurological injuries. Nonoperative and operative treatment, complications, and clinical and radiographic outcome were recorded. The data were then analyzed to determine the neurological and biomechanical prognosis of these injuries, the utility of the various diagnostic modalities in the acute management of the injuries, and the nature and effectiveness of the nonoperative and operative treatment modalities. Ten patients with gunshot wounds involving the lateral mass and/or bodies of the atlantoaxial complex were identified. All but 2 patients sustained a vertebral artery injury. Each patient was evaluated using cervical radiographs, CT scans, and vascular imaging, 8 in the form of digital subtraction angiography and 2 with high-resolution CT angiography. Uncomplicated patients were treated conservatively using cervical collar immobilization, local wound care, and antibiotics. One patient was treated using a halo for instability and 1 underwent posterior fusion following a posterolateral decompression for delayed myelopathy. One patient underwent transoral resection of a bullet fragment.

Wound ballistics is a special case of terminal ballistics. Although wound ballistics is at best sets of approximations, its principles enter usefully into an evaluation of a gunshot wound and its treatment. A special consideration in these cases is their medicolegal aspects. At a minimum, the medical team receiving the patient should exert care not to destroy the clothing and in particular to cut around and not through bullet holes, to turn over to law enforcement officials any metallic foreign body recovered from the patient, and to describe precisely, or even to photograph, any entrance or exit wounds.\n\nEpidemiology, demographics, and outcomes of craniomaxillofacial gunshot wounds in a level I trauma center.\n\nPubMed\n\nTholpady, Sunil S; DeMoss, Patrick; Murage, Kariuki P; Havlik, Robert J; Flores, Roberto L\n\n2014-07-01\n\nGunshot injuries to the craniomaxillofacial region are a challenge to the trauma and reconstructive surgeon. Although management of these injuries has been standardized and early rather than late intervention is advocated, the patient characteristics before, during, and after have been poorly elucidated. A prospectively maintained Level I trauma center database was queried as to gunshot wounds of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton. Over a five-year period (2007-2011), 168 patients were identified with these injuries. Charts were reviewed as to demographics, presentations, and outcomes and these were tested for significant relationships with hospital length of stay, numbers and types of procedures, morbidity, and mortality. Gunshot wounds to the craniofacial skeleton resulted in 71 deaths in this patient population. Those that died were significantly older, presented with a lower GCS, had a shorter LOS, and a higher INR than those that lived. Subgroup analysis of mechanism demonstrated mortality was more likely to occur as a result of self-inflicted injury in whites and due to assault in the African-American population. Data gathered from this study disputes some commonly held beliefs regarding the epidemiology of gunshot injuries and should allow for better characterization of which outcomes are consistent with which presentations.

The aim of the present study was to test micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) for the analysis of firearm wounds experimentally produced on human skin covered by textiles. Firing trials were performed on 60 sections of human calves enveloped by a single layer of fabric (cotton or jeans or leather or nylon) and 15 controls consisting of bare calves. Experimental firings were conducted in a ballistic laboratory at three different muzzle-to-target distances (5, 15, and 30Â cm), using a .32 ACP pistol (Beretta Mod. 81) loaded with full-jacketed bullets coming from the same production lot (7.65âÃâ17Â mm, Browning SR). The visual inspection revealed the classic pattern of GSR distribution on the fabrics and the skin of control samples, while only a dark ring around the entrance lesion was identified on the skin beneath the fabrics. Micro-CT analysis showed the presence of radiopaque material on all entrance wounds, with a statistically significant difference between cases and controls. No differences were found among specimens covered by fabrics, with regard to the firing distance and the type of clothing. No GSR-like deposits were detected in exit wounds. Our results suggest that micro-CT analysis may be a useful screening tool for differentiating entry from exit gunshot wounds when the covering textiles are contaminated, damaged, or missing.\n\nGunshot wounds to the spine in adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nAryan, Henry E; Amar, Arun P; Ozgur, Burak M; Levy, Michael L\n\n2005-10-01\n\nThe incidence of spinal instability after penetrating gunshot wounds to the spine in adolescents is unknown. We describe our experience over a 15-year period. Hospital records were reviewed retrospectively. After injury and emergency care, patients were transferred to a rehabilitation facility. Examinations were completed using the American Spinal Injury Association and Frankel scales on admission, discharge, and 6 and 12 months after injury. Severity of injury was described by: 1) degree of neurological damage, 2) degree of preserved neurological function, and 3) presence of instability. Sixty patients were identified with a mean age 15.6 years (+/- 2.7 yr). Twelve patients had cervical, 31 thoracic, and 17 lumbosacral injuries. No operative treatments were used in their care. Thirty-four patients had complete neurological deficits. Mean acute hospitalization was 21.1 days (+/- 22.8 d), and mean rehabilitation stay was 86.3 days (+/- 48.9 d), for a total hospitalization of 107.4 days (+/- 65.9 d). At 1 year, 19 patients were ambulatory and 53 were autonomous. Despite the presence of bony involvement in all, no evidence of spinal instability was noted on follow-up dynamic imaging. Even in two patients with apparent two-column disruption, no instability was noted. At 1-year follow-up, significant (nonfunctional) improvement was noted in the neurological examination (P < 0.0001). Improvements were most notable in those patients with cervical injuries, followed by thoracic and lumbar injuries. After penetrating gunshot wounds to the spine, patients at 1-year follow-up examinations have evidence of significant, but nonfunctional, improvement. No evidence of spinal instability was noted in this study, and no surgical intervention was required.\n\nA civilian perspective on ballistic trauma and gunshot injuries\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Gun violence is on the rise in some European countries, however most of the literature on gunshot injuries pertains to military weaponry and is difficult to apply to civilians, due to dissimilarities in wound contamination and wounding potential of firearms and ammunition. Gunshot injuries in civilians have more focal injury patterns and should be considered distinct entities. Methods A search of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health MEDLINE database was performed using PubMed. Results Craniocerebral gunshot injuries are often lethal, especially after suicide attempts. The treatment of non space consuming haematomas and the indications for invasive pressure measurement are controversial. Civilian gunshot injuries to the torso mostly intend to kill; however for those patients who do not die at the scene and are hemodynamically stable, insertion of a chest tube is usually the only required procedure for the majority of penetrating chest injuries. In penetrating abdominal injuries there is a trend towards non-operative care, provided that the patient is hemodynamically stable. Spinal gunshots can also often be treated without operation. Gunshot injuries of the extremities are rarely life-threatening but can be associated with severe morbidity. With the exception of craniocerebral, bowel, articular, or severe soft tissue injury, the use of antibiotics is controversial and may depend on the surgeon's preference. Conclusion The treatment strategy for patients with gunshot injuries to the torso mostly depends on the hemodynamic status of the patient. Whereas hemodynamically unstable patients require immediate operative measures like thoracotomy or laparotomy, hemodynamically stable patients might be treated with minor surgical procedures (e.g. chest tube) or even conservatively.

Initial emergency diagnostics revealed numerous shotgun pellets scattered throughout the left-side soft tissue, chest and upper lung lobe with one pellet having migrated into the left ventricle of the heart.Due to the devastating injury pattern, gunshot wounds are interdisciplinarily challenging and should include extended initial diagnostics, such as contrast agent CT. The potential toxicity of elevated lead blood levels have to be taken into further account.\n\nGun-shot injuries in UK military casualties - Features associated with wound severity.\n\nPubMed\n\nPenn-Barwell, Jowan G; Sargeant, Ian D\n\n2016-05-01\n\nSurgical treatment of high-energy gun-shot wounds (GSWs) to the extremities is challenging. Recent surgical doctrine states that wound tracts from high-energy GSWs should be laid open, however the experience from previous conflicts suggests that some of these injuries can be managed more conservatively. The aim of this study is to firstly characterise the GSW injuries sustained by UK forces, and secondly test the hypothesis that the likely severity of GSWs can be predicted by features of the wound. The UK Military trauma registry was searched for cases injured by GSW in the five years between 01 January 2009 and 31 December 2013: only UK personnel were included. Clinical notes and radiographs were then reviewed. Features associated with energy transfer in extremity wounds in survivors were further examined with number of wound debridements used as a surrogate marker of wound severity. There were 450 cases who met the inclusion criteria. 96 (21%) were fatally injured, with 354 (79%) surviving their injuries. Casualties in the fatality group had a median New Injury Severity Score (NISS) of 75 (IQR 75-75), while the median NISS of the survivors was 12 (IQR 4-48) with 10 survivors having a NISS of 75. In survivors the limbs were most commonly injured (56%). 'Through and through' wounds, where the bullet passes intact through the body, were strongly associated with less requirement for debridement (p<0.0001). When a bullet fragmented there was a significant association with a requirement for a greater number of wound debridements (p=0.0002), as there was if a bullet fractured a bone (p=0.0006). More complex wounds, as indicated by the requirement for repeated debridements, are associated with injuries where the bullet does not pass straight through the body, or where a bone is fractured. Gunshot wounds should be assessed according to the likely energy transferred, extremity wounds without features of high energy transfer do not require extensive exploration. Crown\n\nStability of cervical spine fractures after gunshot wounds to the head and neck.\n\nPubMed\n\nMedzon, Ron; Rothenhaus, Todd; Bono, Christopher M; Grindlinger, Gene; Rathlev, Niels K\n\n2005-10-15\n\nRetrospective chart review. To determine the frequency of stable and unstable cervical spine fractures after gunshot wounds to the head or neck; to identify potential risk factor(s) for an unstable versus stable cervical spine fracture. Cervical spine fractures after gunshot wounds to the head and neck are common. Because of the nature of their injuries, patients often present with concomitant airway obstruction and large blood vessel injury that can necessitate emergent procedures. In some cases, acute treatment of these problems can be hindered by the presence of a cervical collar or strict adherence to spinal precautions (i.e., patient laying supine). In such situations, information regarding the probability of a stable versus unstable cervical spine fracture would be useful in emergency treatment decision making. A search for patients with gunshot wounds to the head or neck potentially involving the cervical spine over a 13-year period was performed using a trauma registry. Individuals with cervical spine fractures were identified and their records reviewed in detail. Data collected included information about neurologic deficits, mental status, airway treatment, entrance wounds, fracture level/type, initial/definitive fracture treatment, and final disposition at hospital discharge. A total of 81 patients were identified; 19 had cervical spine fractures. There were 5 patients who were not examinable because of altered mental status (severe head trauma, hemorrhagic shock, or intoxication). All 5 patients had stable cervical spine fractures. There were 11 patients who had an acute spinal cord injury, 3 (30%) of whom underwent surgery for an unstable fracture. Of the 65 awake, alert patients without a neurologic deficit, only 3 (5%) had a fracture, none of which were unstable. Gunshot wounds to the head and neck had a high rate of concomitant cervical spine fracture. Neurologically intact patients have a lower rate of fracture than those presenting with a spinal\n\nCase-study of fatal gunshot wounds from non-lethal projectiles.\n\nPubMed\n\nChowaniec, CzesÅaw; Kobek, Mariusz; JabÅoÅski, Christian; Kabiesz-Neniczka, StanisÅawa; Karczewska, Weronika\n\n2008-07-04\n\nThe authors present a case of the death of a 60-year-old man shot using rubber projectiles that were fired by a police officer from a Mossberg smooth-bore shotgun in an enclosed space from a distance of a few metres. The post-mortem examination revealed that death had been due to gunshot wounds in the chest which had caused heart and lung damage with subsequent massive internal haemorrhaging.\n\nPenetrating Obturator Artery Injury after Gunshot Wounds: A Successful Multidisciplinary Trauma Team Approach to a Potentially Lethal Injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaraqa, Tareq I; Shin, Ji-Sun J; Diallo, Ismael; Sachwani-Daswani, Gul R; Mercer, Leo C\n\n2017-11-17\n\nObturator artery injury (OAI) from pelvic gunshot wounds (GSW)Â is a rarely reported condition. Hemorrhages from pelvic trauma (PT) are mostly venous. Arterial hemorrhages represent about 10-20% of PTs. When arterial hemorrhages from PT occur, they are a severe and deadly complication often causing significant hemodynamic instability and eventual shock. A Â 23-year-old male presented to our emergency service via a private vehicle with multiple gunshot wounds to both thighs and to the lower back, resulted in rectal and obturator artery (OA) injuries. The patient underwent a successful coil-embolization of the right OA. Given the density of structures within the pelvis, patients who sustain gunshot wounds to the pelvic region are at high risk for injury to the small bowel, sigmoid colon, rectum, bladder, and/or vascular structures. While bleeding is the major cause of early mortality in PT, rectal injuries carry the highest mortality due to visceral injuries. A high clinical index of suspicion is needed to diagnose an iliac artery injury or injury to its branches. Prompt computed tomographicÂ angiogram (CTA) and embolization of the OA is the best method to control and stop the bleeding and improve the mortality outcome. Clinicians caring for patients presenting with pelvic gunshot wounds should pay attention to the delayed presentation of internal hemorrhage from the OAs. A multidisciplinary team approach is crucial in the successful management of penetrating injuries to the obturator artery.\n\nManagement of civilian gunshot wounds in a Nigerian general hospital.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOnuba, O\n\n1987-01-01\n\nIn a 3-year period (1981-1984), 52 male patients aged 10-60 years were treated for fresh gunshot wounds. The injuries varied from minor soft tissue injuries to major organ and tissue damage, and were all sustained by low-velocity missiles. Six of the patients (11.5%) died of their injuries or complications while 46 (88.46%) survived and were discharged after 1-15 weeks (a mean hospital time of 3 weeks). Some of the patients were treated before referral and for some there was a delay of more than 48 h before definitive specialist treatment. Mortality was related to the severity of wounding and the delay before treatment. PMID:3620058\n\nIntersecting fractures of the skull and gunshot wounds. Case report and literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nViel, Guido; Gehl, Axel; Sperhake, Jan P\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWhen two fracture lines of a solid surface (ice, glass, eggshell, etc.) intersect, it is always possible to tell which one has been made first. Indeed pre-existing damage of the surface arrests all the fracture lines produced by subsequent impacts. This well-known principle (established by Puppe in 1903) has been largely used in glass fracture analysis, but can be applied also to the examination of skull fractures. It can help sequencing blunt force or gunshot injuries determining the direction of fire and differentiating entrance from exit wounds in the absence of specific distinguishing features (i.e., internal/external beveling of the skull or overlying skin indicators). In this context, we report the case of a 76-year-old man who shot himself in the mouth with a Walther PPK 7.65 handgun and highlight the utility of the application of both Puppe's Rule and Multislice Computed Tomography (MSCT) in the examination of gunshot wounds to the skull.\n\nPenetrating abdominal injuries: management controversies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nButt, Muhammad U; Zacharias, Nikolaos; Velmahos, George C\n\n2009-01-01\n\nPenetrating abdominal injuries have been traditionally managed by routine laparotomy. New understanding of trajectories, potential for organ injury, and correlation with advanced radiographic imaging has allowed a shift towards non-operative management of appropriate cases. Although a selective approach has been established for stab wounds, the management of abdominal gunshot wounds remains a matter of controversy. In this chapter we describe the rationale and methodology of selecting patients for non-operative management. We also discuss additional controversial issues, as related to antibiotic prophylaxis, management of asymptomatic thoracoabdominal injuries, and the use of colostomy vs. primary repair for colon injuries.

Gunshot wounds constitute only a small percentage of that number. The authors of this work have conducted an analysis of autopsy protocols prepared at the Institute in the years 1995-2005. During this period, 48 people were found dead as a result of gunshot wounds. This number constitutes 0.66% of all autopsies conducted within that time-frame. The objective of this study was an attempt at assessing the character of this phenomenon with due consideration given to the following parameters: age, sex, sobriety, circumstances and locality of the event, as well as season of the year, at comparing the results with data found in the literature on the subject.\n\n[The therapeutic effect of nanometer silver impregnated dressing on gunshot wounds after being immersed in brine and tapwater in rabbits].\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Bi; Ding, Guo-bin; Tang, Chao-wu\n\n2004-03-22\n\nTo investigate the therapeutic effect of nanometer silver impregnated dressing on gunshot wounds after being immersed in brine and tapwater in rabbits. Rabbits were randomly divided into two groups after receiving gunshot wounds in both lower limbs. In group 1, the wounded limbs on the experimental side were immersed in brine for 5 h; in group 2, the wounded limbs on experimental side were immersed in tapwater for 5 h. All the wounds were treated with nanometer silver impregnated dressing on the experimental sides, while those of the control sides were treated with vaseline dressing. Biopsy was done after 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 h, respectively. In group 1, the onset of inflammation around the wounds of the experimental sides was delayed, the inflammatory response was less serious, and the wounds were dry with less exudation compared to the controls. The mean healing time of the entry wounds on experimental and control sides was (29.4 +/- 6.6) d and (36.3 +/- 6.0) d (P < 0.01), respectively, and that of the exit wounds on experimental and control sides was (20.1 +/- 6.0) d and (27.3 +/- 5.7) d (P < 0.01), respectively. In group 2, only one of the experimental wounds showed mild inflammation, while all of the control wounds showed serious inflammation with much exudation. The mean healing time of the entry wounds on experimentsides was (13.0 +/- 1.52) d, while that on control sides was (16.0 +/- 3.10) d (P < 0.01). The mean healing time of exit wounds on experimental sides was (11.0 +/- 2.75) d, and those of the control sides was (15.6 +/- 2.85) d (P < 0.01). The nanometer silver impregnated dressing can control infection and accelerate healing in gunshot wounds in rabbits.\n\nLow velocity gunshot wounds result in significant contamination regardless of ballistic characteristics.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeinstein, Joseph; Putney, Emily; Egol, Kenneth\n\n2014-01-01\n\nControversy exists among the orthopedic community regarding the treatment of gunshot injuries. No consistent treatment algorithm exists for treatment of low energy gunshot wound (GSW) trauma. The purpose of this study was to critically examine the wound contamination following low velocity GSW based upon bullet caliber and clothing fiber type found within the injury track. Four types of handguns were fired at ballistic gel from a 10-foot distance. Various clothing materials were applied (denim, cotton, polyester, and wool) circumferentially around the tissue agar in a loose manor. A total of 32 specimens were examined. Each caliber handgun was fired a minimum of 5 times into a gel. Regardless of bullet caliber there was gross contamination of the entire bullet track in 100% of specimens in all scenarios and for all fiber types. Furthermore, as would be expected, the degree of contamination appeared to increase as the size of the bullet increased. Low velocity GSWs result in significant contamination regardless of bullet caliber and jacket type. Based upon our results further investigation of low velocity GSW tracks is warranted. Further clinical investigation should focus on the degree to which debridement should be undertaken.\n\nConcordance Rate for the Identification of Distant Entrance Gunshot Wounds of the Back by Experienced Forensic Pathologists Examining Only Images of Autopsies.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeninger, Michael\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe images of 66 gunshot entrance wounds with a defect on the back, a bullet in the body, hemorrhage along the wound track, and logical certainty that it was an entrance wound were collected from the files of a moderately busy medical examiner's office. Participants numbering 22 board-certified forensic pathologists viewed a single digital archival image of each of the 66 entrance wounds randomly mixed with 74 presumptive exit wounds to determine whether they were entrance or exit wounds. The concordance rate for correctly identifying the 66 logically known entrance wounds was 82.8% with a range from 58% to 97%. This pilot study was conducted to provide an evidence-based approach to the interpretation of the direction of gunshot wounds by reviewing pathologists with access only to archival photographs, and it is not a measure of the accuracy to distinguish entrance from exit wounds when given all of the circumstances.

To perform an analysis on the epidemiological factors associated with gunshot wounds. An analysis was made of multiple variables of all patients diagnosed with gunshot wounds during the period between 2005 and 2015. A total of 605 cases were found, and an additional sub-group of 314 cases was obtained for a deeper analysis. The overall mortality rate was 7.9%. The main anatomical region was the abdomen, with 44%. A total of 324 laparotomies were performed, 124 incisions of the thoracic wall, and 72 vascular examinations. In the sub-group of 314 cases, a 16.9% and 42% of laparotomies and vascular examinations, respectably, were reported without evidence of injury to internal organs. Morbidity and mortality increases when 2 or more wounds are present with multiple organ injuries, in patients with multiple transfusions, or in those transferred to the intensive care unit. The incorporation of a physical evaluation format by all the departments involved is suggested for patients that are attended with gunshot wounds, in order to obtain more epidemiological information of these injuries for further studies.

MethodsâCases were identified through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). During the study period, 1 January 1993 through 31 December 1996, NEISS consisted of a nationally representative sample of 91 hospitals in the United States having at least six beds and providing 24 hour emergency services. ResultsâAn estimated 65 374, or an average of 16 300 per year, non-fatal, non-GSWs were treated in American hospital emergency departments during the four year study period. Fifty seven per cent of all the non-fatal, non-GSWs were violence related, most of which involved being struck by a firearm. The majority of unintentional non-fatal, non-GSWs were self inflicted and occurred during routine gun handling or recreational use of a firearm; 43% of these injuries resulted from gun recoils. ConclusionsâNon-fatal, non-GSWs make a notable contribution to the public health burden of firearm related injuries. Firearm related injury prevention programs should focus on not only the reduction of gunshot wounds but also the reduction of unintentional and violence related non-GSWs.

The retrospective autopsy study was performed for a 10-year period, and it included selected cases of single suicidal gunshot head injury, committed by handguns. We considered only contact or near-contact wounds. The sample included 479 deceased, with average age 47.1 Â± 19.1 years (range, 12-89 years): 432 males and 47 females, with 317 right-handed, 25 left-handed, and 137 subjects with unknown dominant hand. In our observed sample, most cases involved the right temple as the site of entrance gunshot wound (about 67%), followed by the mouth (16%), forehead (7%), left temple (6%), submental (2%), and parietal region (1%). The left temple, right temple, and forehead were the sites of the gunshot entrance wounds, which were the best predictors of the handedness of the deceased (Spearman Ï = 0.149, P = 0.006). Our study showed that the direction of the bullet intracranial path in cases of suicide was even a more potent predictor of the handedness of the deceased (Spearman Ï = 0.263, P = 0.000; Wald = 149.503, P = 0.000).\n\nPediatric intracranial gunshot wounds: the Memphis experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeCuypere, Michael; Muhlbauer, Michael S; Boop, Frederick A; Klimo, Paul\n\n2016-05-01\n\nOBJECTIVE Penetrating brain injury in civilians is much less common than blunt brain injury but is more severe overall. Gunshot wounds (GSWs) cause high morbidity and mortality related to penetrating brain injury; however, there are few reports on the management and outcome of intracranial GSWs in children. The goals of this study were to identify clinical and radiological factors predictive for death in children and to externally validate a recently proposed pediatric prognostic scale. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of penetrating, isolated GSWs sustained in children whose ages ranged from birth to 18 years and who were treated at 2 major metropolitan Level 1 trauma centers from 1996 through 2013. Several standard clinical, laboratory, and radiological factors were analyzed for their ability to predict death in these patients. The authors then applied the St. Louis Scale for Pediatric Gunshot Wounds to the Head, a scoring algorithm that was designed to provide rapid prognostic information for emergency management decisions. The scale's sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictability were determined, with death as the primary outcome. RESULTS Seventy-one children (57 male, 14 female) had a mean age of 14 years (range 19 months to 18 years). Overall mortality among these children was 47.9%, with 81% of survivors attaining a favorable clinical outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score â¥ 4). A number of predictors of mortality were identified (all p < 0.05): 1) bilateral fixed pupils; 2) deep nuclear injury; 3) transventricular projectile trajectory; 4) bihemispheric injury; 5) injury to â¥ 3 lobes; 6) systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg; 7) anemia (hematocrit < 30%); 8) Glasgow Coma Scale score â¤ 5; and 9) a blood base deficit < -5 mEq/L. Patient age, when converted to a categorical variable (0-9 or 10-18 years), was not predictive.

Forensic ballistics data were only available for cases between 2004 and 2008. Males represent 91% of gunshot victims and were struck in the thorax/abdomen with an average of 2.3 bullets. The type of firearms involved were semi-automatic pistols in the predominant caliber 9-mm Luger and assault rifles in caliber 5.56 Ã 45 mm and caliber 7.62 Ã 39 mm Soviet, using full metal jacket bullets. The majority of shootings occurred at ranges of 1 m or greater. The most common bullet path was front to back in 66% of cases. Entry wounds occurred more often on the left side of the thorax, abdomen, and back. The most common critical organs/tissues to sustain bullet trauma in descending order were as follows: heart, lungs, liver, aorta, spleen, kidneys, and vena cava. Ribs were struck by most bullets that entered the thorax.

Our study assessed the epidemiologic characteristics of patients with GSW to the spine treated in New Orleans. A retrospective chart review was performed from January 2007 through November 2011 on all the patients who were seen in the emergency room and diagnosed with a gunshot wound to the spine. Epidemiologic factors, as well as the results of admission toxicology screening, were noted. Outcome analysis was performed on patients undergoing conservative versus operative management for their injuries. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the ASIA classification system. Complications related to initial injury, neurosurgical procedures, and hospital stay were noted. A total of 147 patients were enrolled. Of those diagnosed with a GSW to the spine, 88 (59.8%) received an admission toxicology screen. Seventy-three (83%) patients out of those tested had a positive screen, with the most common substances detected being cannabis, cocaine, and alcohol. In regards to management, 127 (87%) patients were treated conservatively and only one (0.7%) patient improved clinically from ASIA D to E. Of the 20 patients who underwent surgery, one (5%) patient had clinical improvement post-operatively from ASIA C to D. This study evaluates the largest number of patients with GSW to the spine per year treated in a single centre, illustrating the violent nature of New Orleans. In this urban population, there was a clear correlation between drug use and suffering a GSW to the spine. Surgical intervention was seldom indicated in these patients and was predominately used for fixation of unstable fractures and decompression of compressive injuries, particularly below T11. Minimally invasive techniques were used successfully at our institution to minimize the risk of post-operative CSF leak. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In 1948 and 1949, prisoners sentenced to death by firing squad--most of them associated with the post-war anti-communist underground independence movement in Poland--were buried there. The aim of the study was to analyse fatal wounds and the method of execution, and to compare the results to data from archival documents. The results were also compared with studies concerning executions during a later period, i.e. 1949-1954. The research on the method of execution during this period of history carried out during the exhumations in Osobowicki Cemetery was the first conducted on such a scale in Poland. Forensic analysis revealed a wide variety of gunshot wounds inflicted during executions, revealing both gunshots to the head, especially single shots to the back of the head, and cases corresponding to the use of a firing squad, probably equipped with machine guns. The results of the research indicate that capital punishment by shooting was carried out in ways both similar to those the specified in the regulations and completely different.

Some of these myths have been incorporated into the trauma literature as fact and are included in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS). We hypothesized that these erroneous beliefs would be prevalent, even among those providing care for patients with gunshot wounds (GSWs), but could be addressed through education. ATLS course content was reviewed. Several myths involving wound ballistics were identified. Clinically relevant myths were chosen including wounding mechanism, lead poisoning, debridement, and antibiotic use. Subsequently, surgery and emergency medicine services at three different trauma centers were studied. All three sites were busy, urban trauma centers with a significant amount of penetrating trauma. A pre-test was administered prior to a lecture on wound ballistics followed by a post-test. Pre- and post-test scores were compared and correlated with demographic data including ATLS course completion, firearm/ballistics experience, and years of post-graduate medical experience (PGME). One-hundred and fifteen clinicians participated in the study. A mean pre-test score of 34 % improved to 78 % on the post-test with associated improvements in all areas of knowledge (p < 0.001). Years of PGME correlated with higher pre-test score (p = 0.021); however, ATLS status did not (p = 0.774). Erroneous beliefs involving wound ballistics are prevalent even among clinicians who frequently treat victims of GSWs and could lead to inappropriate treatment. Focused education markedly improved knowledge. The ATLS course and manual promulgate some of these myths and should be revised.\n\nWound ballistics: recognizing wound potential.

Trauma nurses could not imagine themselves caring for motor vehicle crash victims without any understanding of speed, vehicle damage, or collision angles. Gunshot wounds are becoming nearly as frequent as motor vehicle crashes, but the mechanism of injury for a gunshot wound is not as widely understood.

After resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization, a CT angiography was performed to analyze the neck size of the PAPA and its position relative to the branches of the parent artery. Covered stent implantation with additional coil embolization was successfully performed. At the 4-year follow-up, the stents remained patent and there was neither pseudoaneurysm recurrence nor treatment-related complication.\n\nDiagnostic and therapeutic aspects in the treatment of gunshot wounds of the viscerocranium.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrÃ¶be, A; Klatt, J; Heiland, M; Schmelzle, R; Pohlenz, P\n\n2011-02-01\n\nGunshot wounds of the viscerocranium are a rare occurrence during times of peace in Europe. The removal of projectiles is recommended; in some cases, however, this is controversial. The material properties of projectiles and destruction of anatomical landmarks make it difficult to determine their precise location. Therefore, navigation systems and cone-beam computed tomography (CT) provide the surgeon with continuous intraoperative orientation in real-time. The aim of this study was to report our experiences for image-guided removal of projectiles, the use of cone-beam computed tomography and the resulting intra- and postoperative complications. We investigated 50 patients with gunshot wounds of the facial skeleton retrospectively, 32 had image-guided surgical removal of projectiles in the oral and maxillofacial region, 18 had surgical removal of projectiles without navigation assistance and in 28 cases we used cone-beam CT in the case of dislocated projectiles and fractured bones. There was a significant correlation (pÂ =Â 0.0136) between the navigated versus not navigated surgery and complication rate (8 vs. 32%, pÂ =Â 0.0132) including major bleeding, soft tissue infections and nerve damage. Furthermore, we could reduce operating time while using a navigation system and cone-beam CT (pÂ =Â 0.038). A high tendency between operating time and navigated surgery (pÂ =Â 0.1103) was found. In conclusion, there is a significant correlation between reduced intra- and postoperative complications including wound infections, nerve damage and major bleeding and the appropriate use of a navigation system.
