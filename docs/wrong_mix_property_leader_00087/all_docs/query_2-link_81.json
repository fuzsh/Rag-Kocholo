Back in 2002, a leather-clad Sergei Stanishev arrived on a motorbike for an event organised by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). A sign attached to his back said: “If you are reading this, Elena must have fallen off on the way.”",

        "text": "Elena is his girlfriend, Elena Yoncheva, a respected television journalist who has reported from Iraq and Chechnya. Although they are not married, they have lived together for many years. The stunt underlines a contrast in style between Stanishev and the man he took over from as prime minister, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the former monarch – also known as Simeon II.\n\nIt was a messy takeover. Stanishev’s party emerged from the June election with most parliamentary seats. But negotiations with Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and others on a coalition dragged on and the government was not formed until August.\n\n“He [Stanishev] is 300 times better in how he deals with the press than the previous prime minister,” notes one Bulgarian reporter after observing Stanishev’s recent visit to Brussels. “He is much more energetic and, though he is 39, he appears much younger than he is. Simeon was a blue-blood aristocrat who thought he was above all of us and too grand to be shaking hands with mere journalists. Stanishev, on the other hand, doesn’t have anything against mingling with ordinary people.”\n\nStanishev is media-savvy. He boasts some experience in journalism, and his contacts with the European social democratic movement have given him some insight into the methods of such canny operators as Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder. As well as being available for any TV show that will have him, he has a good singing voice and does not hesitate to exercise his vocal chords in public.\n\nSince becoming leader of the BSP in December 2001, Stanishev – a fan of both Beethoven and The Beatles – has done much to shake off its ex-communist image. He has broadened the support base of the party beyond its core voter – whose typical profile was someone over fifty, living in a small town or the countryside. He has helped rebrand the party so that it could attract an influx of young voters and meet the criteria for joining the Party of European Socialists, the umbrella group of mainstream centre-left parties.\n\nBut Stanishev himself is no new arrival in the BSP. He has family roots with the party, which he first joined in 1989, months before the Iron Curtain fell. His father Dimiter Stanishev was an ally of the old communist leader Todor Zhivkov. The young Stanishev is a protégé of the former party leader, Georgy Parvanov, now Bulgaria’s president, who had made earlier attempts to shed much of the BSP’s communist baggage.\n\nBorn in Ukraine to a Russian-speaking mother, the young Stanishev studied history at Moscow’s State University. Later in the 1990s, he lived in England as a visiting fellow of the London School of Economics and Political Science. According to acquaintances, his exposure to both Russian and British academia has given some balance to his political perspectives to East and West.\n\nAlthough many of the youthful recruits have been given senior posts in the party, he has had to come to an accommodation with some of the old communist apparatchiks in its secretariat. He has an especially strained relationship with Roumen Ovcharov, who twice faced him in a leadership contest and commands a considerable amount of support from the more traditionalist wing of the party. But Stanishev has appointed Ovcharov – a former operative in the controversial Kozloduy nuclear complex – as economics and energy minister.\n\n“As head of the Socialist Party for the past four years, Stanishev has had a lot of time to do what he wants to do,” says Alexei Lazarov, an editor of Sofia weekly Capital. “Many of my colleagues think he has failed. He has modernised a little but not enough. The resistance of the old communists [to reforms] has been very successful.”\n\nChristian Vigenin, a Socialist member of parliament and confidant of Stanishev, defends the reforms, however. “Maybe more could have been done,” he says. “Maybe he was too cautious. But he has succeeded in keeping the party’s policy on the right track. When small left parties reform, they are usually seen as moving in a populist direction. But that didn’t happen [with the BSP].”\n\nKrassimir Kenev from the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights watchdog, says the main evidence cited by those claiming that Stanishev eschews populist rhetoric is his denunciation of the far-right party Ataka. But, he suggests, this could have more to do with the fact that Ataka is hostile to the BSP than to any desire to muzzle its racist propaganda. “He has never spoken publicly about the most important human rights issues in Bulgaria,” Kenev adds, referring to his failure so far to respond to concerns raised by MEPs about the recent demolition of houses in Sofia, in which Roma gypsies have lived for 80 years. “We don’t know what his views on these issues are. It is not clear even if he knows much about them.”\n\nStanishev’s three-party coalition government aims to press all the right buttons to achieve EU membership. A target date for membership of 1 January 2007, speeding up judicial reforms, maintaining an economic growth rate of 6-8% per annum and undertaking “decisive measures” against corruption and organised crime are all listed as objectives.\n\nStill, Kenev complains that Stanishev and other members of the political elite only appear interested in judicial reform because they realise it is a prerequisite of EU membership, rather than out of any real conviction.\n\nChampagne and red roses were much in evidence when the new government was formed in August. But the celebrations were subdued. Since the election 52 days had elapsed and the country was dealing with the devastating consequences of heavy floods.\n\nAside from the BSP, the other two parties in the coalition are the ethnic-Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms and the National Movement Simeon II of the former prime minister.\n\nThe negotiations on forming the government were fraught. Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who is expected to run for president next year, first insisted that he remained premier and then held out for as many ministerial posts for his followers as possible.\n\nThe lengthy talks have frustrated those who believe Bulgarian politicians have no time to lose in preparing for EU entry.\n\nTo underscore the importance of that task, Stanishev chose Brussels as the destination for his first foreign trip as premier. Speaking after discussions with the European Commission, he said he was “moderately optimistic” that his country would be in the EU in 2007. Under a ‘safeguard clause’, the accession of Bulgaria and neighbouring Romania can be delayed for a further twelve months if their preparations for membership are deemed wanting.\n\nMeglena Kuneva, the country’s Europe minister, who was Bulgaria’s chief negotiator with the EU under Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, has stressed the large volume of work remaining to be done. About 30 new laws – on areas like the environment, intellectual property and food safety – still have to be introduced, as does a new code for procedures in criminal justice.\n\n“If Sergei Stanishev, a historian, wishes to write his way into the history books as the prime minister that led Bulgaria into the EU, hard work completed rapidly seems essential,” journalist Yana Buhrer Tavanier said in a recent article for Transitions Online, a website specialising in Central and Eastern European politics.\n\nSome pundits say it will take a near miracle to keep the coalition together for more than two years. One of the few things the three parties are in full agreement on is that the main reason to avoid a snap election is that it could benefit the extreme right."
