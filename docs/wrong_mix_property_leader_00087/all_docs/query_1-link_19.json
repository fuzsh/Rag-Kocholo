        "text": "Print Email Facebook X LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram\n\nThe former king of Bulgaria Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who lives in his Vrana castle in the outskirts of Sofia and has avoided taking political sides for years, said on Monday that it was “time for change” in Bulgaria.\n\nHe made the comments against the background of popular protests against the prime minister Boyko Borissov continuing for 75 days in a row.\n\n“It’s time for a change. Not so much in term of personalities as of management style and political practices. We cannot and should not turn a blind eye to the many irregularities in the functioning of the administration. We cannot ignore obvious corruption or the need to modernize the judiciary power”, Simeon said.\n\nSimeon, a child king during World War II, returned from exile in the late 90’s and served as Prime Minister from 2001 to 2005. In 2009, after his party won no seats in the elections, he left politics. When he returned to Bulgaria, the current Prime Minister Boyko Borissov provided bodyguard services to him, and when Simeon became Prime Minister, he made Borissov Chief Secretary of the Minister of Interior, which sparked his political career.
