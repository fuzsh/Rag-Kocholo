        "text": "\"I see this gesture of returning King Ferdinand to Bulgaria as something that points to another view and another reading of history,\" Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who is the grandson of Ferdinand I, told the media here on Wednesday.\n\nThe remains of King Ferdinand I were transported from Germany to Bulgaria by a military aircraft on Wednesday in accordance with the decision adopted by the Council of Ministers. The coffin with his remains was placed in Vrana Palace's central lobby.\n\n\"First of all, I am grateful for all this, because this is for our history of Bulgaria. It also shows that we respect our past like other nations and recognise and respect the merits of our rulers,\" he said.\n\nSimeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha explained that the remains are in Bulgaria thanks to the work of many people.\n\n\"The curious thing is that the Germans wanted the red sarcophagus to remain there,\" Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha added. In his words, it would be good to launch the idea to name a boulevard after King Ferdinand I.\n\nFerdinand I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (1861-1948) was a German prince, Bulgarian Prince [Knyaz] (25 June 1887-22 September 1908) and Tsar [King] (22 September 1908-3 October 1918) of Bulgaria. On 25 June 1887, the Third Grand National Assembly elected him Prince of Bulgaria. On 22 September 1908, after the proclamation of the independence of Bulgaria, Ferdinand I was proclaimed Tsar of the Bulgarians. At the conclusion of the Armistice of Salonica (29 September 1918, with which Bulgaria capitulated and exited World War I) the Entente (a military-political bloc between Britain, France and Russia, formed in 1904-1907) set the condition for Ferdinand I to abdicate the throne and leave Bulgaria. On 3 October 1918 he signed a manifesto renouncing the throne in favour of his son Boris III.\n\nAfter abdicating in favour of his son Boris III in October 1918, Ferdinand lived in exile in Germany and died in the Bavarian city of Coburg on September 10, 1948, aged 87. He was laid in a temporary sarcophagus in front of his parents’ tomb in the crypt of Coburg’s St Augustine Church. His last wish was to be buried in Bulgaria. On Monday, with a church service, the residents of Coburg bid farewell to the remains of King Ferdinand I before they were brought to Sofia."
