        "text": "2 The 2001 parliamentary elections in Bulgaria, which brought to power the former Bulgarian king Simeon II in the capacity of prime minister, caused not less than a riot in Western media. “Polish Up That Throne,” 1 “Once a King, Again a King,” 2 “In Simeon’s ‘Court,’ “2 Yankees of Sorts,” 3 “On Top in Bulgaria: New Premier Is the Old King,” 4 are but few of the titles that appeared in Western media. Attention was immediately turned to royal figures across Europe and political analysts were assessing and reassessing the likelihood of replicating Simeon’s political come-back elsewhere. Among the favorite candidates were Romania’s King Michael I, Serbia’s Prince Alexander, and Montenegro’s Prince Nikola. Yet, for the moment, Bulgaria’s case remains unmatched. Despite the clamorous reaction in the media to this unprecedented in modern political life event, the return of Simeon 5 to politics and his party’s sweeping victory in the 2001 elections has remained largely unstudied. Aside from journalistic accounts, there are almost no academic inquiries into the subject. This paper is a first attempt to fill that gap and apply a social science analysis to the subject. Drawing on Weber’s concept of charisma, we argue that Simeon’s electoral victory could be viewed as an example of successful construction of political charisma. We utilize Schweitzer’s elaboration on Weber’s concept, which postulates that charisma is fundamentally synergistic and relies on external conditions as much as on the personal qualities of the leader. 6 Thus, in this paper we examine the political context of the 2001 elections and the 1 “Polish Up That Throne,” The Report, July 9, 2001. 2 “Once a King, Again a King,” Forbes, July 23, 2001. 3 “In Simeon’s ‘Court,’ 2 Yankees of Sorts,” New York Times, July 25, 2001. 4 “On Top in Bulgaria: New Premier Is the Old King,” New York Times, July 31, 2001. 5 Depending on one’s political orientation, ex-king and former prime minister is referred to both as Simeon II and Simeon Saxcoburggotski. In order to avoid any political bias, for the purpose of this paper, we would simply refer to him as Simeon. 6 For Weber’s concept of charisma, see Max WEBER, Economy and Society, Vol. 1, University of California Press, 1978. For Schweitzer’s theory of synergistic charisma, see Arthur SCHWEITZER, The Age of Charisma, Chicago: Nelson-Hall Inc. Publishers, 1984."
