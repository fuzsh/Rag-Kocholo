I know the Bulgarians will be signing their accession treaty in three months and joining the European Union in less than two years, but there is still a whiff of adventure about going down to Sofia and lounging around in the lobby of the Balkan Sheraton.",

        "text": "When I took the bus from Thessaloniki 18 months ago I saw the driver give the border guard two bottles of whisky as a tip for waving us briskly through. This, I thought approvingly, was exactly how the Balkans ought to work.\n\nNext time, I want to go to Bulgaria by river. I am dizzy still from reading “Danube”, by the Italian scholar Claudio Magris, which may well be the best book ever written by anyone on any subject.\n\nAccording to Magris, well into the late 19th century the Balkan reaches of the Danube were worse-charted than the Nile. Map-makers made up their maps, inventing towns and diverting rivers.\n\nCartography, Magris continues, “has without doubt taken some steps forward, but of all the countries of the East, Bulgaria remains the most unknown, a place in which one rarely sets foot, and which comes into the limelight as the scene of improbable and unverifiable intrigues, imaginative trails of sensationalist conspiracies, and accusations (denied) of genocide”.\n\nThis, of course, is no longer true. But I urge the Bulgarian tourist board to circulate occasional bizarre rumours to keep the mystique alive.\n\nA general election might seem a banal reason for going to Bulgaria, but they even do politics there with a twist.\n\nThe prime minister, uniquely in Europe, is an ex-king, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. He was exiled as a child and could return only 50 years later, in 1996.\n\nHis party, the Simeon II National Movement, won election handsomely in 2001, but flopped so badly in local elections two years later that I thought it was finished.\n\nI wrote at the time that Simeon’s return had been a “Balkan fairy tale”, in which “the king has not yet turned into a frog, but his political party has almost croaked”.\n\nI thought this was quite a funny line. Ex-king Simeon did not. He liked even less my view that he had done his country a service “merely by having been there in 2001 to take power and to hold it in a relatively innocuous way”.\n\nMy point was that voters, fed up with the outgoing right-wing government, might otherwise have re-elected the socialists, who would have wrecked the economy as they did four years earlier.\n\nI meant the phrase as a compliment, but it was indeed rather a grudging one.\n\nThe prime minister very properly responded with a sharp and stylish letter to the editor.\n\nHe said that “numerous poison arrows” were directed against him, but none so misdirected as my claim that he held power in a “relatively innocuous” way.\n\nHe had a point. His government has done well on most counts, avoided any disasters and is regaining ground now in the opinion polls. A second term for Simeon is no longer out of the question."
