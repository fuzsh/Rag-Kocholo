The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg has ordered Bulgaria to pay Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha more than BGN 3.27 million (€1,635,875) plus all possible taxes due to the imposed moratorium on disposing with his returned properties in Bulgaria.

Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha is a former prime minister of Bulgaria who reigned as the last tsar of the Kingdom of Bulgaria as Simeon II from 1943 until 1946.

In 2021, the court recognized that Bulgaria had violated Saxe-Coburg's right to property and to a fair trial, and gave both parties 6 months to reach an agreement on compensation for material damages. However, this did not happen and now the Bulgarian state will have to pay the amount determined in Strasbourg within three months.
