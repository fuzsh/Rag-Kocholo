About The Clarks

Early on, The Clarks were once described as a bunch of out of tune country hicks. The band took irreverent offense to the comments, saying they were never country hicks. Eleven studio albums and a couple of guitar tuners later, The Clarks have struck again with Madly In Love At The End Of The World, a lively ride down a rural lane, laced with love, mourning, and questions about where it all goes from here. The band recorded the eleven song album in a converted A-frame church, which helped highlight a series of warm, rock and Alt-Country tunes. The four original members, Scott Blasey (vocals, acoustic guitar), Rob James (6 and 12-string electric guitars, vocals), Greg Joseph (bass, vocals) and David Minarik (drums, vocals) are joined by fellow touring mates Gary Jacob, Skip Sanders and Noah Minarik, tossing out some spanking pedal steel, Hammond organ and tasty guitar. âWeâve never had more fun composing and recording songs,â says bass player Greg Joseph. âWith our storied recording history, itâs really heartening to know that music can still captivate the band as much as it has on this album.â With a highlight reel that includes the Late Show with David Letterman, The Simpsons, and others, The Clarks are enjoying their stage time together now more than ever. âItâs one big extended family,â says guitarist Rob James. âDaveâs son Noah plays on this album, and with us live, so saying that isnât just a metaphor, itâs fact!â Singing and playing the songs of Madly In Love At The End Of The World has rekindled a fire in The Clarksâ sometimes broken, sometimes mended hearts. The Clarks are: Scott Blasey: Lead Vocals, Electric & Acoustic Guitars Robert James: Electric & Acoustic Guitars, Vocals Greg Joseph: Bass Guitar, Vocals Dave Minarik: Drums, Vocals
