        "text": "The Pittsburgh-based independent American rock band, The Clarks, have been together for 36 years, forming back in 1986 at the University of Indiana Pennsylvania. The Clarks consist of Scott Blasey, Rob James, Greg Joseph, and Dave Minarik. Last month, they surprised fans when they released a brand new single, “Sugarcane,” written by bass player and vocalist, Greg Joseph and drummer, Dave Minarik’s son, Noah Minarik (who has played on recent albums and tours with the band).\n\n“Sugarcane” starts off in a familiar territory for anyone in life. You’re down and out, praying that things will get better. You’re hoping that you’ll find that one person who is meant to be your partner through this crazy thing we call life.\n\n“You said some prayers, in the pouring rain\n\nYou were so last year, now she's today\n\nYour dark eyes weep, but you couldn't tell\n\nThe storms you made, are your self-made hell”\n\nEventually, your prayers are answered and you find that person who makes life better with them by your side.\n\n“My sugarcane, my weathervane\n\nMy sugarcane, my summer rain”\n\nIt’s as though “Sugarcane” is being used to compare the idea of finding your person to something sweet like sugarcane. The lyrics “my weathervane” can be interpreted as someone who points you in the right direction and “summer rain” is something we all welcome during those hot, humid months. Watching the music video for “Sugarcane” brings a romantic nostalgic feel to the song, as well.\n\n“Sugarcane” is a classic Clarks song to add to their long list of fan favorites. The Clarks are role models for young musicians trying to make it as independent artists as the band continues to experience success 36 years later."
