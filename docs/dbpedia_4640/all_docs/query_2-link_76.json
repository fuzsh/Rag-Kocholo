        "text": "Online New Student Organization Registration Packets (recognition applications) are accepted on an on-going basis from new student organizations. The online registration process is available here. If you need assistance with this process, please email us at studentengagement@lclark.edu.\n\nOrganizations that received an allocation from the ASB Finance Committee (FIN), must update their contact information by using this form for the academic year before their allocation will be released by the ASB Treasurer and before they can utilize any campus resources.\n\nBelow is a list of all active student organizations, divided by focus. If you have questions, contact us at studentengagement@lclark.edu.\n\nStudent organizations who have not (re)registered, submitted incomplete registration packets, or submitted incomplete contact updates for the current academic year are considered not recognized or in good standing with the College. Once a student organization applies for (re)recognition or submits a completed contact update form, their listing will be moved to the appropriate category on this list, they will be eligible to get funding from the student government, and utilize campus resources.\n\nDidn’t find what you’re looking for?\n\nJust because you didn’t find it listed doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist - don’t forget that student organizations can vary from year to year depending on student interest. Visit this site regularly for the most up-to-date information about student organizations and please contact Student Engagement at studentengagement@lclark.edu.\n\nStudent Organization Recognition\n\nAll student organizations must be recognized with Student Engagement. Student organizations that were previously recognized during the prevision academic year can submit their organization’s new contact information by emailing studentengagement@lclark.edu."
