        "text": "Big Rail Brewing is honored to present The Clarks, live in concert, August 3rd, 2024 at 7pm on our stage in the woods! Get ready for an unforgettable evening with one of Pittsburgh’s most widely renowned rock bands, in a beautiful rustic venue tucked away in the western Pennsylvania forest. With special guest opener The Alyssa Hankey Band.\n\nAbout The Clarks\n\nThe four original Clarks members, Scott Blasey (vocals, acoustic guitar), Rob James (6 and 12-string electric guitars, vocals), Greg Joseph (bass, vocals) and David Minarik (drums, vocals) first met while students at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) in the late ’80s.\n\nWith a highlight reel that includes the Late Show with David Letterman, The Simpsons, and others, The Clarks are enjoying their time together as a band now more than ever. “It’s one big extended family,” says guitarist Rob James. “Dave’s son Noah plays on our albums, and with us live, so saying that isn’t just a metaphor, it’s fact!”\n\nSinging and playing new songs from the band’s 2022 EP Tracks and their 2018 full-length Madly In Love At The End Of The World has rekindled a fire in The Clarks’ sometimes broken, sometimes mended hearts.\n\nVisit The Clarks’ Web Site >>\n\nNeed Lodging?\n\nUpgrade your concert experience by booking a room at our partner hotels to receive FREE shuttle service! Discount rate, free breakfast, and best of all, shuttle to and from the show for a safe and easy night out!\n\nView lodging options here (clicking takes you to the appropriate partner site):\n\nBig Rail Brewing Concert 8/3 – Hampton Inn & Suites >>\n\nBig Rail Brewing Concert 8/3 – Holiday Inn Express >>\n\nAgenda\n\n4:00pm – Big Rail Tap Room Opens / Early Check-in Begins\n\nBecause of the size of this event, **just for today** we’ll be requiring all visiting patrons to have or purchase a ticket to be on-site.
