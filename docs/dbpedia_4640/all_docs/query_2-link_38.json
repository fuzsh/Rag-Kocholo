        "meta_description": "Clark Energy Cooperative is a not-for-profit electric utility headquartered in Winchester, Kentucky. We provide electric services to more than 27,000 accounts (meters) in 11 east central Kentucky counties. As a cooperative, we differ from investor-owned utilities in that we are owned by the members we serve and not by stockholders in another area. Clark Energy is governed by a board of nine directors that are elected from each district of the membership and are responsible for establishing our policies and procedures.",
