Unorganized, terrible layout, far too many people for such a small space. Most disappointing was the fact that I had called ahead to confirm that we could arrive early to have dinner before the concert, only to encounter a locked door. They wouldn't let anyone in early to eat. During the show they did sell a very limited overpriced menu. Bottom line.... I WILL see the Clarks again, but probably not at this venue unless they make some changes.\n\nBeaver, PA@\n\nMario's 410 Grille\n\nMike\n\nJune 23rd 2024\n\nseating arrangements sucked price ridiculous $59 outside then $100 inside said GM and pictured that area of seats as GM clarks were as good as they come\n\nPittsburgh, PA@\n\nStage AE\n\nConnie\n\nMarch 17th 2024\n\nThe Clarks, along with guest Gene the Warewolf were great!! Awesome show. Aces has a nice facility but needs to work on the sound system, tends to get a little muffled at times.\n\nJohnstown, PA@\n\nAce's\n\nben\n\nNovember 12th 2023\n\nBest Clark’s show in a long time. Every song was a banger, and they played some older songs which they don’t normally play.\n\nGreensburg, PA@\n\nThe Palace Theatre\n\nKaren\n\nSeptember 25th 2023\n\nThe Clarks were great. It would have been a better experience if there had been seating near the food trucks. Also parking was an issue.\n\nIrwin, PA@\n\nGig on Main - Irwin, PA\n\nDenise\n\nAugust 7th 2023\n\nThis had to be one of their best concerts yet. The crowd was into it and the guys really had fun up on stage. There is nothing like being at the Fayette County Fair when they sing Cigarette. Loved it. Been a fan since 1989 and still love them.\n\nDunbar, PA@\n\nFayette County Fair\n\nFebruary 26th 2023\n\nThe concert was great as always. Love the Oaks and Oakmont. Dinner before the concert at Hoffstots in Oakmont two thumbs up. At the Oaks, I think the standing area needs to have high top tables so there is a place to set your drink and food. Another bartender would also be huge during concerts. Two attendants at the top of the steps would help the seating area be better filled. We look forward to the next visit!\n\nOakmont, PA@\n\nThe Oaks Theater\n\nTom\n\nJanuary 10th 2023\n\nGlad I got to see them at Sherlock's as it is no longer there! Amazing show as always!! Cant wait to see you guys in the future!!\n\nErie, PA@\n\nSherlock's\n\nBeth\n\nNovember 27th 2022\n\nJergels was a lot of fun. It was awesome seeing Donnie Iris too! The bartenders were great and The Clarks put on a great show!\n\nWarrendale, PA@\n\nJergel's Rhythm Grille\n\nJim\n\nJune 27th 2022\n\nTha Clarks sound just as good live as the recorded version. They give off great vibes and energy! I will be going to listen to them again. It is both good and bad that they never made it “big”. The good is that we can see them locally several times a year at different venues. The bad, others don’t get to hear their live music like we do!! Love their “Edgy” sound. The Sun King Warriors were fun to listen to and loved the end “island” drumming and music!\n\nPittsburgh, PA@\n\nStage AE\n\nNanette\n\nJune 26th 2022\n\nFantastic night of music and fun at Stage AE! The Clarks were in great form, and their performance was amazing. The Let it Go album has so many great songs, and watching all of them performed was such fun. The sound system at the venue is wonderful which really enhanced the performance. The opening band, the Sun King Warriors were also very good. I’d love to see the Clarks at this venue again.\n\nPittsburgh, PA@\n\nStage AE\n\nMichael\n\nJune 26th 2022\n\nFantastic night! The Clarks were amazing per usual, they performed a lot of great songs, and the weather couldn’t have been better. One of my favorite venues, can’t wait to go back 😁\n\nPittsburgh, PA@\n\nStage AE\n\nJohn\n\nOctober 14th 2019\n\nAlways great to see a band that is very receptive to their fan base. Always willing to hang after an event and touch base with old as well as new fans. The Auricle itself is a great venue to see your favorite bands. It is clean with attentive and personable bar tenders.\n\nCanton, OH@\n\nThe Auricle\n\nJay\n\nJuly 7th 2019\n\nThe Clark's show in Charlotte is an event we look forward to every year. We became fans while living in the Pittsburgh area, and seeing them is a sweet reminder of home, not to mention a great night out. Its great to see how well the crowd knows the songs and sings along, and to see new fans get introduced to their music. Visualite Theater is a great venue for music acts as well.\n\nCharlotte, NC@\n\nVisulite Theatre\n\nRobin\n\nApril 24th 2019\n\nHaven't seen them in nearly 5 years since relocating to DC. Been a fan since the beginning. The show was awesome; we had a great time. Going to try and catch a show in North Carolina next!\n\nMorgantown, WV@\n\n123 Pleasant Street\n\nSteve\n\nMay 20th 2018\n\nThese guys are genuinely one of the best bands of all time. Not sure why the rest of the world hasn’t caught on to it.\n\nRaleigh, NC@\n\nLincoln Theatre\n\nAmy\n\nApril 9th 2016\n\nWe've seen The Clark's together four times now, my boyfriend has actually been a fan for over 20 years, and it's always an amazing show! Their songs are lyrically and musically riveting and their live energy just feeds to the sell out crowds they always bring. Can't wait to see them again!\n\nMorgantown, WV@\n\nSchmitt's Saloon\n\nGina\n\nJuly 21st 2014\n\nAwesome show!!! Not a ton of Clark's fans there- most were there for the fair- but they made LOTS of new fans!!!\n\nFairmount City, PA@\n\nClarion County Fair\n\nDecember 29th 2013\n\nit was good. they seemed too commercial though. not like the old days. they need the old clarks once in a while. get back to their roots.\n\nMorgantown, WV@\n\n123 Pleasant St\n\nMichael\n\nNovember 12th 2013\n\nThe Clarks -- Concert 02 of 30 #30at30 #setlist 1-True Believer 2-Caroline 3-Apartment Song 4-Highwire 5-Butterflies and Airplanes 6-Let It Go 7-Train 8-Rise and Fall 9-Shimmy Low 10-On Saturday 11-Inside 12-Born Too Late 13-Hey You 14-Snowman 15-What a Wonderful World (Louis Armstrong Cover) 16-Nothing But You (New Song) 17-These Wishes 18-Kiss (Prince Cover) 19-Part of My Life (New Song) 20-Better Off Without You 21-Trampoline **ENCORE** 22-Irene (New Song) 23-Penny On The Floor 24-The River (Bruce Springsteen Cover) 25-Cigarette\n\nPittsburgh, PA@\n\nThe Rex Theater\n\nView More Fan Reviews\n\nEarly on, The Clarks were once described as a bunch of out of tune country hicks. The band took irreverent offense to the comments, saying they were never country hicks. Eleven studio albums and a couple of guitar tuners later, The Clarks have struck again with Madly In Love At The End Of The World, a lively ride down a rural lane, laced with love, mourning, and questions about where it all goes from here.\n\nThe band recorded the eleven song album in a converted A-frame church, which helped highlight a series of warm, rock and Alt-Country tunes. The four original members, Scott Blasey (vocals, acoustic guitar), Rob James (6 and 12-string electric guitars, vocals), Greg Joseph (bass, vocals) and David Minarik (drums, vocals) are joined by fellow touring mates Gary Jacob, Skip Sanders and Noah Minarik, tossing out some spanking pedal steel, Hammond organ and tasty guitar. “We’ve never had more fun composing and recording songs,” says bass player Greg Joseph. “With our storied recording history, it’s really heartening to know that music can still captivate the band as much as it has on this album.”\n\nWith a highlight reel that includes the Late Show with David Letterman, The Simpsons, and others, The Clarks are enjoying their stage time together now more than ever. “It’s one big extended family,” says guitarist Rob James. “Dave’s son Noah plays on this album, and with us live, so saying that isn’t just a metaphor, it’s fact!” Singing and playing the songs of Madly In Love At The End Of The World has rekindled a fire in The Clarks’ sometimes broken, sometimes mended hearts.\n\nThe Clarks are:\n\nScott Blasey: Lead Vocals, Electric & Acoustic Guitars\n\nRobert James: Electric & Acoustic Guitars, Vocals\n\nGreg Joseph: Bass Guitar, Vocals\n\nDave Minarik: Drums, Vocals\n\nShow More"
