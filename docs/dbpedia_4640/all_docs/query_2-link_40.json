        "text": "Clarks is built on strong community values. And today, we’re a truly global organisation, strengthened by our differences. We are striving to be an inclusive international business, where everyone values alternative perspectives, welcomes diverse opinions, and feels free to be themselves. Where we’re all equally empowered to contribute to our success – because we’re encouraged and supported to achieve our full potential.\n\nBut we don’t just look after our own people. Staying true to our Clark family roots, we support and protect the communities where we live and work, too – investing in their futures, so we can all move forward together.\n\nAs well as looking after our own people, we support and protect the communities where we live and work, too. We began investing in our local community in the 1860s, and it’s a trend we still follow today. Because we recognise the importance of our people by contributing to the communities we all live and work in.\n\nWe focus mainly on enabling young people to learn, be healthy, and realise their potential. So, we’re proud of our global charity partnership with MiracleFeet, who increase access to treatment for children with clubfoot around the world. On top of our global initiatives, our local offices around the world also form strong partnerships with local charities to build on a legacy that continues to move the world forward.\n\nMore about MiracleFeet"
