        "text": "Saturday: 5pm\n\nMitch Clark is a talented singer-songwriter in Nashville, TN, by-way of the picturesque town of Floyd, Virginia, whose soulful voice and heartfelt lyrics have captivated audiences across the country. Known for his unique blend of Americana, folk, and country, and soul influences, Mitch’s music weaves a tapestry of stories and emotions that resonate with listeners of all ages.\n\nWith a childhood dream of being in the golf industry, Mitch had a guitar placed in his hands while in college, for golf! But, the obsession set in and he began teaching himself to sing and play in his dorm room, on campus, and at local coffee shop open mics, and then soon found himself traveling the country playing shows in bars, restaurants, colleges and universities, at private parties, weddings, you name it. Over time, a mixed sound of blues eyed soul and modern country has come to life.\n\nMitch accomplished quite a bit in a short time as a musician. He traveled all around the eastern half of the United States playing at over 80 colleges and universities in his first full year in the college market. After his first year in the collee market, Mitch was named APCA’s 2015 National Male Solo Performer of the Year, APCA’s 2015 National Entertainer of the Year, and Campus Activities Magazine’s 2015 Readers Choice Awards Fastest Rising Star! Year two, he received the accolades of a Tie for first with Natalie Stovall for Campus Activities Magazine’s Best Music Artist, as well as 2nd place for CAM’s Best Small Venue Act.\n\nIn 2017, Mitch moved to Nashville, TN, and dove into the songwriting world, as well as the local music scene. After years of writing songs, and playing shows on the road, he found himself on the first ever audio-only music competition show, Breakthrough, produced by Audible. During this series of songwriting and cover song challenges he prevailed as the WINNER of Season 1 Breakthrough! Mitch is now taking the leap and releasing some of the incredible songs he’s written over the years and just recently, so stay tuned!"
