        "text": "PARKERSBURG — The Clarks are the featured performers in the Artsbridge Summer Music Concert 7 p.m. Thursday at the band shell at City Park.\n\nLawn chairs are recommended for the concert sponsored by Leavitt Funeral Homes and Crematory.\n\nThe Clarks are among the longer-lived family harmony groups in Ohio where the Marvin and Deana Clark family makes its home outside of Beverly.\n\nFor more than 30 years, The Clarks traveled the country singing at fairs, festivals, concert halls and churches. Its brand of music focuses on faith, family, love of country and borders on both the country and bluegrass brand.\n\nMarvin is a songwriter whose songs are an almost brave mix between secular and gospel. The latest album, “Life, Love, and Faith,” is filled with self-penned tunes that present a strong belief in a religious cornerstone, testimonies of life struggles, and the joys of everyday life.\n\nMarvin and Deana are co-owners of the Ohio Valley Opry, a country, bluegrass and gospel music show held at the Twin City Opera House in McConnelsville."
