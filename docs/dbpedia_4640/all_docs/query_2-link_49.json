These meetings encourage general communication and updates for residents. Additionally, the meetings garner feedback and ideas from residents. Active participation is sought from residents and staff to collaborate and improve the functioning of the home. The design of House Milieu Meetings supports a culture of inclusion and planning and teaches residents how to self-advocate, develop a sense of community, and organize house responsibilities among each other. Staff will model positive communication and conflict resolution and celebrate holidays with residents, all while creating a culture of respect, opportunity, and wellness.

External presentations are welcomed as residents agree to such.\n\nTreatment, Individualized Plans, and Programming\n\nExternal providers establish treatment planning for clinical and medical services. These will vary by resident based on the individual’s needs. Staff will assist with the selection of providers. On-site staff will encourage and support each resident to adhere to their treatment plan and activities. Additionally, Clark’s Manor uniquely provides care management services by trained, masters-level staff to help assure each individual achieves his or her established goals.
