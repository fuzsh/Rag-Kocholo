Not thinking anything of it, they went about their day until that night.\n\n\"We came back, and it had 10,000 views,\" Aubree said.\n\nThe number became 20,000 and then 50, then 100,000. Then came the requests – people wanted to hear more.\n\n\"We were receiving all these different comments and feedback from people on Facebook initially just exclusively saying this has really helped us get through the day,\" Aubree said. \"We had nothing to do today. We're stuck at home. This made us so happy. Can you please post again?\"\n\nFour years later, the group now films and uploads a new tune at least once a week. Recently, they began a live living room show, a paid for event for their fans who just can't stop the beat.\n\n\"Live events in our house have been just a good training for the kids to kind of play 10 or 11 songs back-to-back and then have questions from the audience and get a flow from that,\" Colt said.\n\nThe group is getting another big break in person this fall, headlining their own show at Dollywood this October."
