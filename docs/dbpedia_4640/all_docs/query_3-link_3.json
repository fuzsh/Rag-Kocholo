As explained by Greg Joseph\n\n(who wrote the song alongside Noah Minarik): “When a diagnosis of cancer is unexpectedly thrown into your world, what's the reaction Poring over\n\na spectrum of emotions, again and again, looking for answers, looking for solace, becomes a full-time job. The primary antidote is to search for\n\nstrength....strength from within and strength from those around you.” Listen to the song here.\n\nFAN CLUB TICKETS:\n\nIf you are receiving Cig Digs, you are in the fan club already and have access to tickets with a lower surcharge and at a greater convenience.\n\nWe try and secure these tickets for as many shows as possible.\n\n_____________________________\n\nTOUR DATES AND BOOKING INFO\n\nAs always, please check The Tour Page for the most up-to-date Clarks performance schedule.\n\nLooking to book The Clarks?
