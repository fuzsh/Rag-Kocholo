        "text": "Be great or be different if you’re covering Bruce.\n\nThe Clarks’ version of “The River” is both.\n\nThe Pittsburgh-based band recorded their uptempo rock arrangement of Bruce’s classic but subdued reckoning of romance-meets-reality back in 2003. Originally released on the Light of Day Springsteen tribute album, The Clarks’ version of “The River” caught fire on local radio, and deservedly so: they managed to successfully translate it from ballad to full-on rocker without losing an ounce of its emotional power, something Bruce hasn’t ever attempted.\n\nIt works–better than one might imagine was possible. Take a listen.\n\nYou can find “The River” on the Light of Day tribute album, or on The Clark’s 2004 release, Strikes and Gutters 2: Doublewide."
