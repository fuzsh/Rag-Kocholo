        "text": "The Clark welcomes school groups of all ages for free, year-round. All school visits must be scheduled through the Education Department at least two weeks in advance.\n\nEngaging with art enhances learning, offers expanded dimensions for understanding, knowledge, and skill building, and can connect to most subject areas across the grades. Our school group gallery tours can be tailored to support areas of your curriculum and particular learning goals, as well as state and federal standards. For more resources, curricula, and activities for your school visit or to include in your teaching, please see our Teacher Resources page.\n\nPlan a School Visit\n\nWe encourage school groups to visit the museum in person and we provide transportation reimbursement. For groups who cannot make an in-person visit, a digital engagement can be arranged. Check out our list of suggested themes and featured tours below and read the Teacher Guidelines for more information.\n\nTo plan a visit, please fill out our School Group Visit Request form. If you have any questions, please contact our Department Coordinator, Lily McGartland, by phone 413 458 0563 or email."
