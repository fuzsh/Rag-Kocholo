        "text": "The Clarks gaze up and down the family tree on their fine new album, \"Madly in Love at the End of the World,\" arriving June 8.\n\nThe local rockers set it off with \"She's on Fire,\" told from a refreshing point of view too seldom heard in rock 'n' roll, as a father reflects on his little girl growing up and becoming independent.\n\n\"All those rules that your parents had, you brought them back around again/They all made sense\" are the lyrics of bassist Greg Joseph sung by Scott Blasey in a voice laden with wisdom, adding, \"You held her hand and let it go/That's how she learned how to fall.\"\n\nGary Jacob's tastefully twangy pedal steel asserts itself as Blasey's tone gets more bittersweet, but no less proud, with \"All her knickknacks she's pushing back/She gave the dog a bone and said, 'I'll do it my way'/She wears your stubbornness, you know/That ain't gonna change.\"\n\n\"She's on Fire\" is sentimental without getting schmaltzy, and the same goes for \"Dying to Live,\" where a son looks after his ailing father, a World War II veteran and retired mill worker. The people at church keep asking how he's doing.\n\n\"Those are the good ones,\" Blasey sings knowingly.\n\nPittsburgh singer Kayla Schureman, a transplant from San Fernando, Calif., getting 91.3-WYEP airtime, adds backing vocals on \"Dying to Live\" and \"Roses.\"\n\nThe song I keep returning to, \"The Longest One Night Stand,\" is a 2-minute, 43-second blast of barroom rock about a woman ready to end a relationship with \"the boy who stole a lot of years\" from her.\n\nGuitarist Rob James of Beaver gets a good workout on a number of songs, including \"Witness to a Crime\" (a crime of the heart), the slow and rugged \"Keep Your Eyes on the Road\" and the revved-up \"In Blood,\" which sounds like an outtake from 2004's \"Fast Moving Cars.\"\n\nJacob, on 12-string guitar and pedal steel, and Skip Sanders, on keys — both now regular members of the band who climbed aboard in 2008 — bring the album extra texture. Drummer Dave Minarik's son, Noah Minarik, also chips in on guitar.\n\nA number of these new songs could remain in the Clarks' setlist the next two decades (because they're going to be like the Rolling Stones and keep playing into their 70s, right?).\n\n\"It's amazing,\" James said, \"and not in a way where I'm patting ourselves on the back, but just to still feel like we can walk into a room together and share something that people want to hear.\"\n\nExpect a big turnout June 16, when the Clarks play their annual outdoor concert at Stage AE in Pittsburgh, a sort of symbolic album-release show. Technically, the band had a stack of CDs with them to sell at recent shows in Annapolis, Md., and Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C.\n\n\"What we were hearing from people at those shows was, 'We really don't know these new songs. We were expecting to hear your usual show, but you guys obviously are energized by this new album,'\" James said. \"We're sticking to our guns and bucking the trend of only playing a few new ones live. We're doing quite a few, like eight or nine in the set.\"\n\nYou can head to YouTube now to familiarize yourself with the track \"In Blood.\" Spotify users can presave the album to their account so that it lands in their libraries on June 8. See the band's Facebook page for more details.\n\nWith a career that started 31 years ago at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, the Clarks long ago became a western Pennsylvania treasure. The respect they've earned will be evident at that Stage AE show, which launches with Sven, a band composed of members of top '80s and '90s Pittsburgh bands such as the Affordable Floors, A.T.S., 11th Hour and the S.P.U.D.S., performing in its entirety the Clarks' 1988 debut album, \"I'll Tell You What Man ...\"\n\nAt the Clarks' request, the specific singers joining that all-star band won't be revealed before showtime.\n\n\"Suffice to say, we have a veritable who's who of Pittsburgh vocalists from all eras, including a few who weren't born yet when 'I'll Tell You What Man ...\" came out,\" PGH All-Stars bassist Rod Schwartz said.\n\nMaybe after the Stage AE show, we'll get wind of a Clarks concert at their favorite Beaver County haunt, Thursday's in Bridgewater.\n\n\"We always play Beaver County over the summer,\" James said.\n\nChippewa singer's band debuts album\n\nA-Money & the Downtown City cover a lot of ground on their crowd-funded debut EP to be released Friday with a show at Club Cafe in Pittsburgh.\n\nAdam Merulli of Chippewa Township fronts the rock band, which incorporates folk, soul and hip-hop elements.\n\nA-Money & the Downtown City write a good hook, as heard on tracks such as \"Dominoes,\" where hand percussion provides a nice earthy feel to lyrics that are an antidote to cynicism.\n\nMerulli describes \"Dominoes\" as a \"breezy acoustic pop song about the excitement of new possibilities and falling in love.\"\n\nHe thoughtfully breaks down each of the EP's other original songs:\n\n\"Little Red Hearts,\" which was played on 102.5-WDVE, is the \"sarcastic rocker aimed at self-obsession through social media.\"\n\n\"Hands Up (No Justice)\" is \"a protest song against police brutality, supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.\"\n\n\"Lantern\" is \"a folk-rock ballad, which contemplates loss and acceptance.\"\n\n\"Electric Serenade\" is the \"rock/rap/spoken word hybrid about redemption and perseverance.\"\n\nMerulli says, \"We definitely worked hard on the record and wanted to give each song its own vibe and offer a different message in each track.\"\n\nThis is the first band for Merulli, whose earliest gigs were alone on stage at former places such as the Copper Dog in Bridgewater and the Blue Violet Cafe in Rochester.\n\n\"The whole thing just evolved organically,\" he said. \"I started from playing solo acoustic and performing poetry at open mics and in the process met band members, and things took off from there.\"\n\nHe got more focused on writing in the last year or two.\n\n\"I'm proud to have written the songs on the record and can't wait for everyone to have a listen,\" he said.\n\nTickets for Friday's 7 p.m. show are $10, with Clara Kent the support act.\n\nLast thought\n\nI caught the first set from Kiss Me Deadly last Thursday at Wooley Bully's in New Brighton.\n\nThe Cleveland rockers were fun, playing an even mix of originals and covers, and infusing sax and mandolin into their basic bar-band structure. I thought they sounded better on their originals, which were more in the wheelhouse of singer Jen Poland, who has a Chrissie Hynde quality to her voice.\n\nWhat disappointed me was the turnout. I counted 18 spectators when the free, well-advertised show began at 9:15 p.m. and would say that number grew to only 30 an hour later.\n\nI'd still like to see local bars try a 7 or 8 p.m. start time, especially on weeknights, to see if that increases crowd sizes.\n\nThe Portugal. The Man concert at Stage AE on Tuesday began at 7:15 p.m.\n\nScott Tady is entertainment editor at The Times and easy to reach at stady@timesonline.com."
