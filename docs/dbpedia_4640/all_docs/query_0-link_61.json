        "text": "The lights went down and the feedback from the bass guitar rang out across the auditorium, as the crowd cheered in anticipation, wondering what would be their first track. The opening chords of Born Too Late rang out across the crowd, and everyone began cheering and jumping up and down as the alternative rock band launched straight into their famous track. The show was an incredible journey through their musical catalogue, and their nine studio albums gave them an incredibly extensive list to pick their set from.\n\nIt’s evident from the way that the band perform together that they’ve been playing together for many years, and something so small as a nod of the head from Scott Blasey can symbolise for the band to extend or alter a chorus, and seeing that unfold before me live was incredible. When bands improvise as The Clarks did, it’s clear that they’re organic and talented musicians, rather than the fabricated bands that there are so many of in this generation.\n\nWhen they played Feathers and Bones, they had everyone singing along, as it was the most anticipated track of the set as it’s so new. They were dancing around the stage with so much energy, it was contagious, and I have no idea how they maintained their stamina for the whole set.\n\nRead more"
