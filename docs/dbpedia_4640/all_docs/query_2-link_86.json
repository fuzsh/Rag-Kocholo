If you need siding, windows or remodeling, Clark Pool Group can do it all.\n\nWe are the factory, so you can expect a reasonable time for your pool to be installed. No worries about stalled supply lines and waiting a year for other types of pools you might be considering.\n\nWHEN BUILDING ON THE OUTER BANKS OR THE MAINLAND, A CONCRETE POOL IS YOUR BEST OPTION.\n\nThe Outer Banks, Currituck County and Northeast North Carolina have a high water table. If you are on the oceanfront, soundfront or anywhere in a flood zone (AE, VE ), then for peace of mind, the only solution is a concrete pool designed and built by Clark Pool Group."
