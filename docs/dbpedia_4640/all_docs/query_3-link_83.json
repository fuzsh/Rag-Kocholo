        "text": "Grammy-Award winning country artist Brandy Clark will help close out Spoleto Festival USA’s second week at the College of Charleston’s Cistern Yard on June 1.\n\nThe Spoleto Festival website describes Clark as “a perennial critics’ favorite” known for her storytelling abilities.\n\n“[It is] rare to see a rising star so comfortable in her own skin and in full command of her storytelling powers,” the Spoleto Festival USA website says of Clark.\n\nAccording to Lee Zimmerman of “American Songwriter,” Clark “excels in sharing emotional ballads that detail the difficulty of sustaining relationships while allowing feelings to flourish.” Clark’s website bio describes her as “one of her generation’s most esteemed songwriters and musicians.”\n\nSince 2013, Clark has released four studio albums. In a review of her 2023 self-titled album, Brittney McKenna of “NPR Music” praised Clark for her willingness to defy male-centric country music tropes.“Bucking trends and returning to form, ‘Brandy Clark’ is a beautiful reminder of the potential that comes with opening up,” she wrote.\n\nIn February, Clark won Best Americana Performance at the “66th Annual Grammy Awards” for her song “Dear Insecurity,” featuring Brandi Carlile. She has received 16 nominations in other categories including Best New Artist.\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Variety, Clark related the song’s theme of insecurity to her recent success.\n\n“I’ve had a really good run here in the last little bit,” she said. “But I still have things that I don’t like about myself or that feel like shortcomings.”\n\nAside from her solo work, Clark has written songs recorded by high-profile artists like Carlile, Miranda Lambert and The Band Perry. She won Song of the Year at the “2014 Country Music Association Awards” as co-writer of the Kacey Musgraves hit “Follow Your Arrow.”\n\nClark’s talents extend beyond country and pop music. She and co-writer Shane McAnally wrote the music and lyrics for Broadway’s “Shucked.” The pair was nominated at the “76th Tony Awards” for Best Original Score.\n\nClark’s upcoming performance at the Cistern Yard marks her Spoleto Festival debut. She stands among a group of seven high-caliber acts performing in its Front Row series, including Jason Isbell.\n\n“We’re pleased to bring this lineup of popular touring musicians to this historic venue to create a dialogue between past and present, where modern expressions dance with timeworn echoes,” Spoleto Festival USA general director and CEO Mena Mark Hanna said in a press release.\n\nBrandy Clark will perform at the College of Charleston’s Cistern Yard June 1 at 9 p.m. Find tickets here.\n\nEthan Stinson is an arts journalism and communications graduate student at Syracuse University.\n\nRelated\n\nHelp keep the City Paper free.\n\nNo paywalls.\n\nNo subscription cost.\n\nFree delivery at 800 locations.\n\nHelp support independent journalism by donating today."
