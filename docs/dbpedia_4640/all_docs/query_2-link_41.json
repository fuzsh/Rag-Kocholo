The Clark College Concert Band performs a wide spectrum of standard concert band and contemporary wind ensemble literature in a minimum of one concert per quarter. Topics include musical excellence, and skills for teamwork and leadership.\n\nNo auditions are necessary to enroll, but the student must be able to perform on their instrument at a level commensurate with the difficulty level of the music being performed. Before enrolling, students may also be asked to meet with the director and/or provide a recommendation from a prior music director or musical peer of the instructor’s discretion, in order to assess if the student’s goals are appropriate for the overall goals and needs of the Clark Bands.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Doug Harris, Director of Bands\n\nPhone- 360-992-2188\n\nEmail: daharris@clark.edu\n\nJazz Band\n\nCourses: MUSC 195, 196, 197, 295, 296, 297\n\nOpen to students who perform on saxophone, trumpet, trombone, guitar, piano, bass, and drum set. Topics include performance techniques of jazz styles and repertoire and introduction to a wide variety of jazz subjects from improvisation and jazz history to understanding Latin/Afro-Cuban jazz rhythm. Additional topics include musical excellence and skills for teamwork and leadership. Jazz improvisation skills are not required, but strong music reading skills are required and instrumentation in the ensemble is limited.\n\nAcceptance into the ensemble will be assessed at the beginning of the term by audition. Students may also be asked to meet with the director and/or provide a recommendation from a prior music director or musical peer of the instructor’s discretion in order to assess if the student’s goals are appropriate for the overall goals and needs of the Clark Bands.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Doug Harris, Director of Bands\n\nPhone- 360-992-2188\n\nEmail: daharris@clark.edu\n\nTreble Ensemble, Chorale, Concert Choir\n\nCourses: MUSC 137, 138, 139, 237, 238, 239, 153, 154, 155, 253, 254, 255, 183, 184, 185, 283, 284, 285\n\nThere are three choirs at Clark College. Membership in all three choirs occurs either by audition (see attached audition evaluation) or by interview/recommendation. The Choir Director will accept vocalists by requesting prospective choir members to perform a pre-chosen piece indicative of the level of skill necessary, by interview, or by recommendation.\n\nStudents will be contacted by the choir director for an audition/interview to determine acceptance for that term. Vocal balance in each choir is essential to the success of the choir; therefore, the needs of the choirs are fluid. Students interested in singing in a Clark College choir are encouraged to contact the director before the beginning of each term to determine needs of the choir for current or future terms.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Jacob Funk, Director of Choirs\n\nPhone- 360-992-2245\n\nEmail- jfunk@clark.edu\n\nOrchestra\n\nCourses: MUSC 150, 151, 152, 250, 251, 252\n\nThe Clark College Orchestra is a collaborative music organization composed of students, faculty, and community members.
