Now, the question becomes: should Knuth have used a functional language to describe his algorihtms? Should TeX have been written in a functional language?\n\nComputers have a procedural architecture. Do the roots of computation imply anything about the best branches?\n\nThe original AoCP was written in MIX. The updated AoCP used MMIX which was based on more modern architectures.\n\nHowever, the fundamental point still holds. Knuth went from one procedural architecture to another... with apparently no need for functional programming."
