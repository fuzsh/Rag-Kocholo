See the Blackfin projects page for more information and ports of binutils and gdb.\n\nFebruary 06, 2005\n\ngcc.gnu.org suffered hardware failure and had to be restored from backups. We do not believe any data was lost in the CVS repository. We did lose any pending messages in the mail queue as that does not get backed up. At this time, everything should be functional except for htdig. The mailing list archives on the web site are also out of date and will be updated soon. New mail will update the archives correctly, however. If you find any other problems, please email overseers@gcc.gnu.org\n\nJanuary 27, 2005\n\nGCC now has a Wiki.\n\nNovember 4, 2004\n\nGCC 3.4.3 has been released.\n\nSeptember 30, 2004\n\nGCC 3.3.5 has been released.\n\nSeptember 9, 2004\n\nThe next major version of GCC following the current 3.4 release series will be called GCC 4.0.\n\nSeptember 6, 2004\n\nGCC 3.4.2 has been released.\n\nJuly 1, 2004\n\nGCC 3.4.1 has been released.\n\nMay 13, 2004\n\nThe tree-ssa branch has been merged into mainline.\n\nApril 20, 2004\n\nGCC 3.4.0 has been released.\n\nFebruary 25, 2004\n\nThe tree-ssa branch has been frozen to be incorporated into GCC 4.0.0. Tree SSA incorporates two new high-level intermediate languages (GENERIC and GIMPLE), an optimization framework for GIMPLE based on the Static Single Assignment (SSA) representation, several SSA-based optimizers and various other improvements to the internal structure of the compiler that allow new optimization opportunities that were difficult to implement before.\n\nFebruary 24, 2004\n\nGCC 3.3.3 has been released.\n\nFebruary 6, 2004\n\nJosef Zlomek of SUSE Labs and Daniel Berlin of IBM Research have contributed Variable Tracking. It generates more accurate debug info about locations of variables and allows debugging code compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer.\n\nOctober 18, 2003\n\nBernardo Innocenti of Develer S.r.l. has contributed the m68k-uclinux target and improved support for ColdFire cores, based on former work by Paul Dale (SnapGear, Inc.) and Peter Barada (Motorola, Inc.).\n\nOctober 17, 2003\n\nGCC 3.3.2 has been released.\n\nAugust 27, 2003\n\nNicolas Pitre has contributed his hand-coded floating-point support code for ARM. It is both significantly smaller and faster than the existing C-based implementation. The arm-elf configuration uses the new code now, and other ports will follow.\n\nAugust 8, 2003\n\nGCC 3.3.1 has been released.\n\nJune 26, 2003\n\nBen Elliston of Wasabi Systems, Inc. has converted the existing ARM processor pipeline description to the new DFA pipeline description model. It will be part of the GCC 3.4.0 release.\n\nMay 27, 2003\n\nProceedings and photographs of participants are available for the First Annual GCC Developers' Summit, which took place May 25-27, 2003.\n\nMay 14, 2003\n\nGCC 3.3 has been released.\n\nApril 25, 2003\n\nGCC 3.2.3 has been released.\n\nFebruary 05, 2003\n\nGCC 3.2.2 has been released.\n\nJanuary 29, 2003\n\nAndrew Haley of Red Hat completed the work begun by Bo Thorsen of SuSE to port GCJ to the AMD x86-64 architecture. This is the first implementation of the Java programming language to be made available on that platform. It will be part of the GCC 3.3 release.\n\nJanuary 28, 2003\n\nThe ongoing effort to remove warnings from the GCC code base itself, spear-headed by Kaveh Ghazi, has paid off: For our development versions and snapshots, we now enable -Werror during a full bootstrap.\n\nJanuary 22, 2003\n\nThe GCC Steering Committee has named Gabriel Dos Reis as release manager for the upcoming GCC 3.2.2 release, allowing Mark Mitchell to focus his efforts on the GCC 3.3 and 3.4 release series. 3.2.2 is intended to be a bug fix release only.\n\nJanuary 10, 2003\n\nGeoffrey Keating of Apple Computer, Inc., with support from Red Hat, Inc., has contributed a precompiled header implementation that can dramatically speed up compilation of some projects.\n\nDecember 27, 2002\n\nMark Mitchell of CodeSourcery has contributed a new, hand-crafted recursive-descent C++ parser sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The new parser is more standard conforming and fixes many bugs (about 100 in our bug database alone) from the old YACC-derived parser.\n\nDecember 4, 2002\n\nNathan Sidwell of CodeSourcery has contributed an implementation of non-trivial covariant returns for non-varadic virtual functions.\n\nNovember 21, 2002\n\nGCC 3.2.1 has been released. We plan to shortly create the GCC 3.3 release branch (but want to fix a couple of high-priority regressions first).\n\nAugust 14, 2002\n\nGCC 3.2 has been released.\n\nJuly 26, 2002\n\nGCC 3.1.1 has been released.\n\nJuly 19, 2002\n\nMichael Matz of SuSE, Daniel Berlin, and Denis Chertykov have contributed a new register allocator. IBM and Rice University have allowed use of their register allocator software patents for graph coloring and register coalescing.\n\nMay 28, 2002\n\nSupport for all the systems obsoleted in GCC 3.1 has been removed from the development sources. (These targets can still be restored if a maintainer appears.)\n\nMay 15, 2002\n\nGCC 3.1 has been released.\n\nMay 5, 2002\n\nAldy Hernandez, of Red Hat, Inc, has contributed extensions to the PowerPC port supporting the AltiVec programming model (SIMD). The support, though presently useful, is experimental and is expected to stabilize for 3.2. The support is written to conform to Motorola's AltiVec specs.\n\nMay 2, 2002\n\nHP and CodeSourcery announced that HP will sponsor Mark Mitchell's work as GCC Release Manager through April 2003.\n\nApril 30, 2002\n\nVladimir Makarov, of Red Hat, Inc, has contributed a new scheme for describing processor pipelines, commonly referred to as the DFA scheduler.\n\nApril 15, 2002\n\nThe Chill front end (that already was omitted from GCC 3.0) has been removed from the GCC source tree.\n\nFebruary 25, 2002\n\nWe have branched for GCC 3.1 (release criteria, changes) and are concentrating on bugfixes. The 3.1 release is planned for late April.\n\nFebruary 21, 2002\n\nGCC 3.0.4 has been released.\n\nFebruary 9, 2002\n\nAlexandre Oliva, of Red Hat, Inc., has contributed a port to the SuperH SH5 64-bit RISC microprocessor architecture, extending the existing SH port.\n\nJanuary 24, 2002\n\nTensilica has contributed a port to the configurable and extensible Xtensa microprocessor architecture.\n\nJanuary 14, 2002\n\nRichard Stallman has changed the licensing of the Classpath AWT implementation to match the licensing of the rest of Classpath. This means that the only remaining barrier to AWT for libgcj is manpower. Work has already begun to merge the Classpath and libgcj AWT implementations.\n\nJanuary 8, 2002\n\nSuSE Labs developers Jan Hubicka, Bo Thorsen and Andreas Jaeger have contributed a port to the AMD x86-64 architecture. For more information on x86-64 see http://www.x86-64.org.\n\nDecember 20, 2001\n\nGCC 3.0.3 has been released.\n\nNovember 3, 2001\n\nHans-Peter Nilsson has contributed a port to MMIX, the CPU architecture used in new editions of Donald E. Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.\n\nOctober 25, 2001\n\nGCC 3.0.2 has been released.\n\nOctober 11, 2001\n\nAxis Communications has contributed its port to the CRIS CPU architecture, used in the ETRAX system-on-a-chip series. See developer.axis.com for technical information.\n\nOctober 5, 2001\n\nAlexandre Oliva of Red Hat has generalized the tree inlining infrastructure, formerly in the C++ front end, so that it is now used in the C front end too.\n\nOctober 2, 2001\n\nAda Core Technologies, Inc, has contributed its GNAT Ada 95 front end and associated tools. The GNAT compiler fully implements the Ada language as defined by the ISO/IEC 8652 standard.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001\n\nRoman Lechtchinsky, Technische Universit√§t Berlin, has donated support for the Cray T3E platform.\n\nAugust 29, 2001\n\nJan Hubicka, SuSE Labs, together with Richard Henderson, Red Hat, and Andreas Jaeger, SuSE Labs, has contributed infrastructure for profile driven optimizations.\n\nAugust 25, 2001\n\nGeoffrey Keating of Red Hat has donated support for Sanyo's Stormy16 CPU core.\n\nAugust 20, 2001\n\nGCC 3.0.1 has been released.\n\nAugust 16, 2001\n\nThe gcc.gnu.org machine will be moving to a new physical location with significantly improved bandwidth and backup on Saturday, August 18th. The move is expected to take less than two hours; DNS will be adjusted accordingly, the new IP address will be 209.249.29.67.\n\nJuly 17, 2001\n\nThe Steering Committee adopted a new development plan which we will start using for GCC 3.1, scheduled for April 15, 2002.\n\nJuly 9, 2001\n\nDaniel Berlin and Jeff Law have contributed a Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation optimization pass.\n\nJune 18, 2001\n\nGCC 3.0 has been released.\n\nMarch 16, 2001\n\nGCC 2.95.3 has been released.\n\nFebruary 12, 2001\n\nOur CVS tree has branched for the GCC 3.0 release process and Mark Mitchell, our release manager, has provided some guidelines for the GCC 3.0 branch.\n\nFebruary 12, 2001\n\nHans-Peter Nilsson, our search-engine volunteer, tweaked the search-engine to include all mailing lists (including libstdc++ and GCJ).\n\nJanuary 28, 2001\n\nTom Tromey has moved the Java mailing lists and web pages to gcc.gnu.org. Now the GCJ project is fully integrated into GCC.\n\nJanuary 21, 2001\n\nNeil Booth has contributed improvements to the dependency generation machinery of the C preprocessor, adding some new functionality and correcting some undesirable behaviour of the old implementation.\n\nJanuary 15, 2001\n\nThe GCC development tree is in a slush state, with the goal of stabilization for branching for GCC 3.0.\n\nDecember 19, 2000\n\nThe runtime library for the Java front end, libgcj, has been moved into the GCC tree. This means that a separate download will no longer be required for Java support.\n\nDecember 4, 2000\n\nNick Clifton of Red Hat has donated support for the Intel XScale architecture.\n\nNovember 26, 2000\n\nThe C, C++ and Objective C front ends now use the integrated preprocessor exclusively; their independent ability to tokenize an input stream has been removed.\n\nNovember 18, 2000\n\nG++ is now using a new C++ ABI that represents classes more compactly, uses shorter mangled names, and is optimized for higher run-time performance. The implementation of the new ABI was contributed by Mark Mitchell, Nathan Sidwell, and Alexander Samuel of CodeSourcery, LLC.\n\nNovember 18, 2000\n\nGCC now supports ISO C99 declarations in for loops (for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) /* ... */). These are only supported in C99 mode (command line options -std=gnu99 or -std=c99), which will be the default in some future release, but not in GCC 3.0.\n\nNovember 14, 2000\n\nMichael Matz has donated an implementation of the Lengauer and Tarjan algorithm for computing dominators in the CFG. This algorithm can be significantly faster and more space efficient than our older algorithm. For one particularly nasty CFG from complex C++ code (more than 77000 basic blocks) compile time dropped from more than 40 minutes to around 25 minutes. Memory consumption was also dramatically decreased.\n\nNovember 13, 2000\n\nWe have now switched the C++ front end to use libstdc++-v3, a new implementation of the ISO Standard C++ Library which brings significant changes and improvements over our ``old'' library. There still be may some rough edges, but we are addressing problems as soon as we learn about them -- please help testing and improving ``your'' ports!\n\nNovember 13, 2000\n\nGCC now supports two more ISO C99 features:\n\nThe builtin boolean _Bool type and the <stdbool.h> header. (GCC 2.95 had a non-conforming <stdbool.h> header; code that used that header will not be binary compatible with code using the new conforming version.)\n\nMixed declarations and code in compound statements.\n\nNovember 2, 2000\n\nThe C, C++ and Objective C front ends to GCC now use an integrated preprocessor by default. If all goes well, this will also be the default mode for GCC 3.0.\n\nNovember 1, 2000\n\nSupport for C99's _Pragma operator has been added to the preprocessor. This feature effectively makes it possible to have #pragma directives be part of macro expansions, and to have their arguments expanded too if necessary.\n\nOctober 6, 2000\n\nWe would like to point out that GCC 2.96 is not a formal GCC release nor will there ever be such a release. Rather, GCC 2.96 has been the code- name for our development branch that will eventually become GCC 3.0. More...\n\nSep 11, 2000\n\nZack Weinberg of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, has contributed modifications to the C, C++, and Objective C compilers which permit them to use the C preprocessor library (cpplib) directly instead of via a separate executable.\n\nThis is not yet the default mode, but we hope it will be the default in GCC 3.0. When it is used the compiler will be faster because it will not have to do lexical analysis twice, nor save the preprocessed output to a temporary file. In the future, this will permit better error messages, and more detailed debugging information particularly when complex macros are used.\n\nSep 11, 2000\n\nNeil Booth has contributed a new lexer and macro-expander for the C preprocessor. The lexer makes a single pass over the source files, whereas previously it made two. The macro expander operates on lexical tokens instead of text strings.\n\nISO C, C++, and Objective C use the new preprocessor. Traditional (K+R) C, Fortran, and Chill use an older implementation (taken from GCC 1) which obeys the rules for pre-standard C preprocessing. Either version may be used to preprocess assembly language.\n\nMay 2, 2000\n\nStan Cox and Jason Eckhardt of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have contributed a basic block reordering pass. The optimization can reposition basic blocks from across the entire function in an attempt to reduce branch penalties and enhance instruction cache efficiency.\n\nOur thanks go to Michael Hayes, Jan Hubicka, and Graham Stott who noticed or fixed defects or made other useful suggestions.\n\nMay 1, 2000\n\nRichard Earnshaw of ARM Ltd, and Nick Clifton of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have contributed a new backend for the Arm and Thumb processors.\n\nThe new backend combines code generation for the Arm, the Thumb and the StrongArm into one compiler, with the target processor and instruction sets being selectable via command line switches.\n\nApril 30, 2000\n\nMichael Meissner and Nick Clifton of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have contributed a port for the Mitsubishi D30V processor.\n\nMichael Meissner and Richard Henderson of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have contributed a new if-conversion pass. The code runs faster and identifies more optimization opportunities than the old code. In addition, it also has support for conditional (predicated) execution, such as is found in the Intel IA-64 architecture, the ARM processors, and numerous embedded LIW and DSP parts.\n\nMarch 22, 2000\n\nThe Steering Committee has appointed Mark Mitchell, of CodeSourcery, LLC, to manage the GCC 3.0 release and as a new Steering Committee member. CodeSourcery will be providing time from Mark, Alex Samuel, and other personnel, to manage the release. Thanks!\n\nThe Steering Committee and the GCC community owe Jeff Law an immense debt for his work as release manager for the EGCS 1.0.x, 1.1.x, and GCC 2.95.x series of releases. He has done an outstanding job.\n\nMarch 18, 2000\n\nAndy Vaught has started work on GNU Fortran 95, the Fortran front end destined to implement the latest standard. See this page for its current status (previously over here).\n\nMarch 17, 2000\n\nJim Wilson and Richard Henderson of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, and David Mosberger of HP labs have contributed a port for the Intel Itanium (aka IA-64) processor.\n\nJeff Law and Richard Henderson of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have contributed RTL based tail call elimination optimizations. Support currently exists for the Alpha, HPPA, ia32 and MIPS processors. Long term the RTL based tail call optimizations will be replaced with a tree based tail call optimizer.\n\nMarch 14, 2000\n\nCodeSourcery, LLC is now providing nightly snapshots of GCC, distributed as RPMs for GNU/Linux on Intel platforms, plus build logs and testsuite results. In order to allow users to more easily confirm whether the current snapshot of GCC fixes a particular bug, an online compilation web form is provided.\n\nMarch 13, 2000\n\nDenis Chertykov contributed an AVR port. AVR is a family of micro controllers made by Atmel with embedded FLASH program memory and embedded RAM. It is the first GCC port to an 8-bit microprocessor with a 16-bit address bus.\n\nMarch 9, 2000\n\nCodeSourcery, LLC and Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have contributed an implementation of static single assignment (SSA) representation. SSA will facilitate the implementation of powerful code optimizations in GCC.\n\nMarch 2, 2000\n\nJason Molenda, who had a major role in setting up and managing the gcc.gnu.org (originally egcs.cygnus.com) machine and site, is leaving Cygnus. We would like to thank him for his efforts and support behind the scenes and wish Jason all the best in his new job.\n\nFebruary 23, 2000\n\nCygnus, a Red Hat company, contributed an M*Core port.\n\nJanuary 4, 2000\n\nSteve Chamberlain has contributed a picoJava port.\n\nDecember 10, 1999\n\nCodeSourcery, LLC has contributed a new inliner for C++. As a result, the compiler may use dramatically less time and memory to compile programs that make heavy use of templates.\n\nDecember 1, 1999\n\nCygnus has donated support for the Matsushita AM33 processor (a member of the MN10300 processor family). The MN103 family is targeted towards embedded consumer products such as DVD players, HDTV, etc.\n\nOctober 27, 1999\n\nGCC 2.95.2 is released.\n\nOctober 16, 1999\n\nCraig Burley, our lead Fortran developer and the original author of g77, announced that he will stop working on g77 beyond the 2.95 series. On behalf of the entire GCC team, the steering committee would like to thank Craig for his work.\n\nCraig has written a detailed analysis of the current state and possible future of g77, available at his g77 web site.\n\nIf you are interested in helping with g77, please contact us!\n\nOctober 12, 1999\n\nWe are pleased to announce that Richard Earnshaw and Jason Merrill have been given global write permissions throughout the GCC sources.\n\nCygnus has installed various upgrades to improve services for GCC and other open source projects hosted by Cygnus.\n\nOctober 11, 1999\n\nThe gcc steering committee welcomes a new member: Gerald Pfeifer. His insights into political issues and his web improvement work were and will be of great use.\n\nSeptember 21, 1999\n\nNick Clifton of Cygnus Solutions has donated support for the Fujitsu FR30 processor. The FR30 is a low-cost 32bit cpu intended for larger embedded applications. It has a simple load/store architecture, 16 general registers and a variable length instruction set.\n\nSeptember 20, 1999\n\nCygnus Solutions has donated two new global optimizers to GCC. Global Null Pointer Test Elimination and Global Code Hoisting/Unification.\n\nSeptember 3, 1999\n\nLong time GCC contributors Mark Mitchell and Richard Kenner have been given global write permissions. They are authorized to install and approve patches to any part of the compiler. Richard Kenner will initially be working on merging in the remaining changes from the old GCC 2 sources.\n\nSeptember 2, 1999\n\nRichard Henderson has finished merging the ia32 backend rewrite into the mainline GCC sources. The rewrite is designed to improve optimization opportunities for the Pentium II target, but also provides a cleaner way to optimize for the Pentium III, AMD-K7 and other high end ia32 targets as they appear.\n\nAugust 31, 1999\n\nCygnus Solutions has released libgcj version 2.95.1 Java runtime libraries for use with GCC 2.95.1.\n\nAugust 19, 1999\n\nGCC 2.95.1 is released.\n\nAugust 4, 1999\n\nA new snapshot of the new Standard C++ Library V3 has been released. You can find more information from the libstdc++ project's home page.\n\nCygnus Solutions has released libgcj version 2.95 Java runtime libraries for use with GCC 2.95.\n\nAugust 2, 1999\n\nMumit Khan has pre-built gcc-2.95 binary packages for Windows platforms.\n\nJuly 31, 1999\n\nGCC 2.95 is released.\n\nJuly 11, 1999\n\nCygnus Solutions has donated support for a generic i386-elf target. (Note that this will not be included in gcc 2.95.)\n\nJune 29, 1999\n\nCygnus Solutions has donated hpux11 support. (Note that this will not be included in gcc 2.95.)\n\nJune 15, 1999\n\nCygnus Solutions has donated a major rewrite of the Intel IA-32 back end, focusing on better optimization for the Pentium II. (Note that this will not be included in gcc 2.95.)\n\nMay 27, 1999\n\nToon Moene has emailed (and posted) his notes on the GNU Fortran (g77) Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) session at LinuxExpo to the appropriate lists, and Craig Burley has made Toon's notes available (in edited form) at http://world.std.com/~burley/bof.html.\n\nProbably the most important decision reached at the meeting is that Craig Burley will undertake the long-awaited 0.6 rewrite of the g77 front end as his top priority for the gcc 3.0 release, rather than focusing on implementing some of the most wanted features that didn't require the rewrite, such as Cray pointers.\n\nThe BOF provided us with some additional information to guide future development of GNU Fortran. Thanks to all who attended, whether in person or in spirit!\n\nMay 18, 1999\n\nThe sixth snapshot of the ongoing re-written C++ Standard Library has been released. It includes SGI STL 3.2, an automatically generated <limits>, a partially re-written valarray, a working stringbuf and stringstream (for basic types). For more information, please check libstdc++ home page.\n\nApril 23, 1999\n\ng77 now supports optional run-time checking of array subscript expressions via the -fbounds-check compiler option. (The same option applies to whatever bounds-checking applies for other languages, such as Java. The -ffortran-bounds-check option specifies bounds-checking for Fortran code.)\n\nApril 20, 1999\n\nYes, it is not a hoax: The egcs steering committee is appointed official GNU maintainer for GCC; the egcs team will be responsible for rolling out future GCC releases.\n\nThis will require some changes in policy and procedures for the project. We will provide more information on those changes as they are available.\n\nwww.gnu.org has the FSF announcement under the \"GNU flashes\" heading.\n\nApril 15, 1999\n\nMark Mitchell is now a co-maintainer of the C++ front end along with Jason Merrill.\n\nApril 13, 1999\n\nWe have set up a new mailing list gcc-cvs-wwwdocs that tracks checkins to the egcs webpages CVS repository.\n\nApril 7, 1999\n\nCygnus announces the first public release of libgcj, the runtime component of the GNU compiler for Java.\n\nRead the release announcement.\n\nGoto the libgcj homepage.\n\nApril 6, 1999\n\nA new snapshot of the C++ standard library re-write has been released. This release includes SGI STL 3.12, a working valarray, and several (but not all) parts of templatized iostreams--for more information see: libstdc++ home page.\n\nMarch 23, 1999\n\nThrough the efforts of John Wehle and Bernd Schmidt, GCC will now attempt to keep the stack 64bit aligned on the x86 and allocate doubles on 64bit boundaries. This can significantly improve floating point performance on the x86. Work will continue on aligning the stack and floating point values in the stack.\n\nMarch 15, 1999\n\negcs-1.1.2 is released.\n\nMarch 10, 1999\n\nCygnus donates improved global constant propagation and lazy code motion optimizer framework.\n\nMarch 7, 1999\n\nThe egcs project now has additional online documentation.\n\nFebruary 26, 1999\n\nRichard Henderson of Cygnus Solutions has donated a major rewrite of the control flow analysis pass of the compiler.\n\nFebruary 25, 1999\n\nMarc Espie has donated support for OpenBSD on the Alpha, SPARC, x86, and m68k platforms.
