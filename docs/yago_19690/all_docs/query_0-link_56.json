The quality of video data is insufficient for large pictures, so I decided to render each image at the largest size that would retain reasonably sharp details. This limited me to slightly nore than 1 inch in each dimension, so it strongly affected the design of the book. The original pictures shown here in black and white were actually in color when viewed by computer, but color did not add anything important. Indeed, when I edited the pictures later, converting then to black and white, the lack of color made it possible for me to enhance nany details that would have looked strange if I had distorted the colors in a similar fashion.\n\nThis folder contains: Original proofs of captured TV frames; An experinent with TV frames printed in color (fron the paael discussion); 0riginal proofs of the Poster illustration (scanned in parts); Original proofs of inages taken from 35mm slides; First proofs after conversion to black-and-white.\n\nCL15, Chapter 15: On the Translation of Languages from Left to Right\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nCopy of original article; marked galleys; edited version\n\nFG01: The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures P1\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nmarked proofs\n\nFG02: Official Tables of the Potrzebie System 10p\n\nFG10: Representing Numbers Using Only One 4 P18\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nmarked proofs\n\nFG24: The Triel: A New Solution P58\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nmarked proofs\n\nFG26: Move It Or Lose It Q223\n\nScope and Contents note\n\ncopy of original letter to Martin Gardner; marked proofs\n\nFG45: Mathematics and Art: The Dragon Curve in Ceramic Tile P59\n\nScope and Contents note\n\ntests of illustrations; marked proofs\n\nFG51: early copy of many chapters, used to index them\n\nScope and Contents note\n\n(before the final order of chapters was decided, and before many of the chapters were written) [I brought these with me to work on in odd moments, during a long trip East]\n\nFG52: first copy of the entire book, sent to proofreading team\n\nScope and Contents note\n\n(and also used to index several chapters)\n\nCP00: miscellaneous notes and trial pages saved while making the CPbook\n\nCP01: rough transcriptions of the taped luncheon conversations between Dikran Karagueuzian and Don Knuth in 1996 (these became Chapters 7--17)\n\nCP02: first working copy of the entire CPbook as sent to proofreaders\n\nCP03: extensive files of correspondence relating to all nine volumes of the series\n\nScope and Contents note\n\na few of these are from the 1990s, but the vast majority are from the period 2004--2011\n\nOriginal typewritten manuscript of the opening pages of Volume 4\n\nScope and Contents note\n\n[This MS was incidentally typed on a \"historic\" early IBM Selectric Typewriter, which is now in the collection of the Computer History Museum.]\n\nChanges to my working copy of Volume 1 Fascicle 1 (MMIX) Apr 2000- Jun 2002\n\nSection 7.2.1.1, the first hardcopy proofs of all pages, 1-Aug-2001\n\nSection 7.2.1.1, page proofs to make the index of prefascicle 2A, 4-Aug-2001\n\nSection 7.2.1.2, the first complete page proofs 8-Dec-2001\n\nChanges to my working copies of prefascicles 2A&2B summer 2001 - summer 2002\n\nSections 7.2.1.1 and 7.2.1.2, drafts after November 2002\n\nSection 7.2.1.3, proof copy used to make index 11-Jun-2002\n\nSection 7.2.1.3, first copy (with subsequent corrections) 13-Jun-2002\n\nSection 7.2.1.3, version (with subsequent corrections) 29-Aug-2003\n\nSection 7.2.1.4, drafts 2001 Nov-2003 Nov\n\nSections 7.2.1.4 and 7.2.1.5 10-Jan-2004\n\nSections 7.2.1.4 and 7.2.1.5 (now called prefascicle 3B) 12-Jun-2004\n\nSection 7.2.1.6, early drafts Apr 2004 -- Jul 2004\n\nSection 7.2.1.7, my first printed copy 12-Oct-2004\n\nSection 7.2.1.7 as marked by Robin Wilson, given to me early 2005\n\nFirst draft of special copy for the paperback Fascicle 3 13-Jun-2005\n\nSections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2, early drafts May 2005 -- Mar 2006\n\nSection 7.1.3, early drafts Dec 2006-Oct 2008\n\nSection 7 (introduction to whole chapter, early draft) 2007 Apr\n\nRobin Wilson's comments on Section 7 26-Jul-2007\n\nSection 7.1.4, early drafts Oct 2007-Nov 2008\n\nMisc. notes (references, first analysis of algorithm, list of \"complete names\") 1963-1972\n\nLanguage of Material: English.\n\nComputer programs written while preparing the manuscripts (mostly volume 2) undated\n\nLanguage of Material: English.\n\nHooray, We're Going to America!: The Migration of the H.H.
