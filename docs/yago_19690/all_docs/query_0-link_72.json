        "text": "Home * People * Donald Knuth\n\nDonald Ervin Knuth,\n\na renowned computer scientist, mathematician, writer, scholar, and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University, California, United States [2]. He is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming, and been called the \"father\" of the analysis of algorithms - in 1975 he analyzed Alpha-Beta along with Ronald W. Moore, first formulating its Node Types [3]. Beside his fundamental contributions to several branches of computer science and mathematics, Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system.\n\nQuotes\n\nMcCarthy\n\nQuote by John McCarthy from Human-Level AI is harder than it seemed in 1955 on the Dartmouth workshop:\n\nChess programs catch some of the human chess playing abilities but rely on the limited effective branching of the chess move tree. The ideas that work for chess are inadequate for go. Alpha-beta pruning characterizes human play, but it wasn't noticed by early chess programmers - Turing, Shannon, Pasta and Ulam, and Bernstein. We humans are not very good at identifying the heuristics we ourselves use. Approximations to alpha-beta used by Samuel, Newell and Simon, McCarthy. Proved equivalent to minimax by Hart and Levin, independently by Brudno. Knuth gives details.\n\nKnuth\n\nSelected quotes by Donald Knuth [4]\n\nA mathematical formula should never be \"owned\" by anybody! Mathematics belong to God. [5]\n\nBeware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it. [6]\n\nWe should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
