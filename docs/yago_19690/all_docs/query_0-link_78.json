        "text": "Shoot, I meant to link my other post on learning about famous computer scientists, too:\n\nProgrammers as Human Beings\n\nhttp://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000541.html\n\nBoth of those books, by the way, are outstanding.\n\nJust bought myself the 3 volume set as a christmas present to myself (paid about half price by shopping around at the Amazon partner stores but they wouldn’t let me use my gift tokens). Also recommend the Millennium Edition of “programming pearls”, which says that serious programmers should have 2 copies: one for work and one for home.\n\nYou didn’t mention the concrete mathematics book he co-authored that he talks about in the introduction. Suspect I’m gonna need a copy before too long.\n\nCurrently completing a CS degree, I’m disappointed in myself that I only of Knuth in 2007 while doing algorithms/data structures. I still have a very very long way to go!\n\nAfter doing a fair bit of reading on the man I’ve discovered that he is absolutely brilliant! Not brilliant as in Einstein brilliant, but in a totally different way that transcends the gap between scientist and student.\n\nHe offers money (a very small amount… $3.14 or something) for anyone that discovers a spelling mistake in his books. It’s this silly down-to-earth-ness that makes people want to listen to his insanely brilliant ideas.\n\nGreat man. Happy Birthday.\n\nAh, Donald Knuth.\n\nThanks to him, we know have to learn the O( ) notation for all the algorithms! It’s extremely useful, I still think “Mmm, that’s in O(n), can’t I make it faster?”.\n\nAnd of course, having written my thesis in Latex, I’m damn glad he made Tex or I would have had to make it in Word. The horror!\n\nAnd his Art of Computer Programming of course. So far only used it to find all permutations of a string but it came in use\n\nAnd a good sense of humor too, check out http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/arvindn/misc/knuth_song_complexity.pdf\n\n3 cheers to Knuth!\n\nA Conversation with Don Knuth: Part 2 (1982)\n\nA Conversation with Don Knuth: Part 2 on JSTOR\n\nThe main thing that struck me was that the liturature was so spotty. Computer science was a very new field, without an identity of its own, and standards of publication were not terribly high, especially when quantitative aspects of algorithm performance were concerned. A lot of the published articles were just wrong, so you had three possibilities: the wrong answer by the wrong method, the right answer by the wrong method, and the right answer by the right method. You had about a one-third chance on any of these possibilities. The literature on computing was already large but very unreliable…\n\nAny similarity between that, and today’s developers who grow up learning from the internet and Google searches, is I’m sure completely coincidental…\n\n(also, I wish I could get to the rest of that 14 page interview, it looks really interesting.)\n\noff-topic, or perhaps, side-topic, Jeff Shallit was a prof of mine. I remember his lectures well, as I thought he was insane. Well, not insane. More like passionate about weird CS problems,… to the point of insanity. I guess insanity for me, since I was trying to get through a set of courses that term, but every lecture was like a get-into-google-brainteaser.\n\nThe only one I remember was something about the big O of doing a binary search in an infinite list, something like that. I look back thinking ‘good times’, but at the time, I don’t think I thought so, heh"
