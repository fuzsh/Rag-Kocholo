        "text": "This is a call for volunteers in Donald Knuth's MMIX project. If you are a computerist, you should know him. (For those who don't, he is the author of The Art of Computer Programming and a lot of other nice books, and the creator of TeX.)\n\nIn the previous editions of The Art of Computer Programming, he used a machine named MIX to describe his algorithms in the machine language. He wanted the implementations to be as efficient as possible. And their were. Really.\n\nBut the books started in the 60s, and such an old machine, is of no use today. It's a good experience for those who are interested, to learn it and try to program in it, but how many of you currently use machines whose subroutines are not stack-based? How many of you use a 6 bit per byte computer?!\n\nKnuth has recently developed a new machine, called MMIX, which is RISC-based and very very interesting. (Think a little, this machine is designed in 1998.) He now wants volunteers for converting his old programs to this new MMIX system. If you are good at algorithms, and you like assembly programming, you're a good candidate. Please help!"
