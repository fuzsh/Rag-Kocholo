        "text": "Why I run away from Knuth\n\nMay 8, 2008 at 5:54 pm | Posted in History, Programming | 18 Comments\n\nTags: books, Programming, software\n\nNearly every programmer, at some point of his life has got hit by this name or truly I should say got intimidated by his way of presenting algorithms. Many programmers think that he has wrongly titled his book as ‚ÄúThe Art of Computer Programming‚Äù. Most programmers get scared when they look at his book. Heck, when, in 2002, I saw his book for 1st time, I thought, they were Mathematics books. It‚Äôs only later when I started to do programming, in 2005 or 2006, I found out they were basically about algorithms. Still, I don‚Äôt read Knuth because his style is quite academic. His books feel like they are written in a formal way, for schools or universities. Check out these 4 books:\n\n1.) How to Design Programs (HtDP)\n\n2.) K&R2\n\n3.) Practical Common Lisp\n\n4.) Introduction to Algorithms\n\nAll of these books have quite very different styles of presenting and using their concepts. I generally have a hard time with academic style. Knuth explains, explains and explains the algorithms, with 100% Mathematics, in the most detailed manner ever done and leaves the applications of those algorithms up to you [1].\n\nDonald Knuth is a child-prodigy. When he was in 7th grade, he was solving mathematical problems of his seniors in higher-grades [2]. I am not a child-prodigy. On comp.programing, someone said this:\n\nIf you want to know how to take simple things and make them as as obtuse as humanly as possible, read Knuth.\n\nuser923005 at comp.programming said this to me when I said in a post that I don‚Äôt like academic texts:\n\nKnuth uses Mathematics to present his ideas while those very ideas can be presented without much Mathematics. Programming is not just Math, it is a totally different phenomenon. Programming is about analyzing problems, finding solutions and recognizing the patterns before you even start to code. A software design pattern has nothing to do with Math. Take a more practical example:\n\nN - 1 ------------ \\ \\ \\ / / / ------------- i = 0\n\nthat is sigma, a mathematical notation to represent that ‚Äúi‚Äù goes from zero to N. Now look at this:\n\nfor( int i = 0; i != N; ++i );\n\nthis does the same thing, a for loop. That sigma, the Mathematical notation, is a for loop in disguise but nearly all of the books that teach algorithms use sigma instead of for loop. The Sigma belongs to Mathematics and for loop belongs to programming but the main underlying idea is to start i at zero and then increment it till it is less than N. Sigma is used to formally represent that concept. You can‚Äôt use sigma inside C++ code, you can use only for loop üôÇ\n\n[1] Some time ago, he wrote a very specialized algorithm for a quite powerful chess program)\n\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth#Early_life\n\nCopyright ¬© 2008, Arnuld Uttre, #331/type-2/sector-1, Naya Nangal, Distt. ‚Äì Ropar, Punjab (INDIA) ‚Äì 140126\n\nVerbatim copying and distribution of this entire article are permitted worldwide, without royalty, in any medium, provided this notice, and the copyright notice, are preserved."
