        "text": "First Paragraph: I live just off of Bell Road outside of Newburgh, Indiana, a small town of 3,000 people. A mile down the street Bell Road intersects with Telephone Road not as a modern reminder of a technology belonging to bygone days, but as testimony that this technology, now more than a century and a quarter old, is still with us. In an age that prides itself on its digital devices and in which the computer now equals the telephone as a medium of communication, it is easy to forget the debt we owe to an era that industrialized the flow of information, that the light bulb, to pick a singular example, which is useful for upgrading visual information we might otherwise overlook, nonetheless remains the most prevalent of all modern day information technologies. Edison’s light bulb, of course, belongs to a different order of informational devices than the computer, but not so the telephone, not entirely anyway.\n\nTheory, father of the Universal Probability Distribution, creator of the Universal Theory of Inductive Inference, passed away on Monday 30 November 2009, from complications in the wake of a broken aneurism in his head. He is survived by his loving wife, Grace. Ray Solomonoff was the first to describe the fundamental concept of Algorithmic Information or Kolmogorov Complexity, and the first to prove the celebrated Invariance Theorem. In the new millennium his work became the foundation of the first mathematical theory of Optimal Universal Artificial Intelligence. Ray intended to deliver an invited lecture at AGI 2010, the Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (March 5-8, 2010) in Lugano (where he already spent time in 2001 as a visiting professor at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA). The AGI conference series would not even exist without his essential theoretical contributions. With great sadness AGI 2010 was held «In Memoriam Ray Solomonoff». Ray will live on in the many minds shaped ...\n\nLlull has been described, anachronistically, as the first computer scientist. Nevertheless he did make significant contributions to the discipline that is now seen as computer science. Some of these contributions are also relevant to mathematics. The latter has become wellknown, principally because his ideas were taken up by Leibniz (16461716) and his followers. We discuss these contributions. In addition we draw attention to Llull’s use of letters for entities and argue that he was the first to use the idea of substituting a value for a variable.\n\nAlan Turing has a rightful claim to the title of father of modern computing. He laid the theoretical groundwork for a universal machine that models a computer in its most general form before World War II. During the war, Turing was instrumental in developing and influencing actual computing devices that have been said to have shortened the war by up to two years by decoding encrypted enemy messages that were believed by others to be unbreakable. Unlike some theoreticians, he was willing to be involved with practical aspects, and was as happy to wield a soldering iron as he was to wrestle with a mathematical problem, normally from a unique angle compared to others.\n\nThroughout history we encounter some personalities who think ahead of their time and, in many cases, are misunderstood or even wronged. However, they all have one thing in common: they are geniuses who find impressive solutions to complex problems. This article aims to carry out, through bibliographical research using qualitative data analysis methodology, a historical review of one of the important personalities who wrote his name in history and has great relevance in the development of modern computing: Alan Mathison Turing or how it is known: Alan Turing. Considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, he made his great contribution to humanity by developing, in 1936, through an academic article, an automatic machine (\"a-machine\", which was later called the Turing), who could read and write different numbers and symbols. This article covers since his birth, covering his academic trajectory, understanding a little of his mentality and vision around machines and technological equipment, his partnerships and some interesting facts about his life. Thus, it can be understood that, even at that time, it was already possible to visualize the signs of the first computational logics and realize that machines have dynamics beyond human understanding, as they can also learn from humans and other machines and, best of all, Above all, transmit this knowledge with quality. Thus realizing the legacy and historical milestone that this British mathematician, computer scientist, philosopher and biologist left for the modern and contemporary world in which we live today."
