Two dapper gentlemen play a game of chess at an outdoor cafe. As one of the players look away, the other player shifts his king and takes an enemy piece off the chessboard. A fight then ensues following a disputed chess move. From squirting with a seltzer bottle to a fist fight, the players wrestle each other to the floor. They continue the fight out of the camera's view, hidden by the wooden table until the water arrives to haul the chess bums out. The director was English film pioneer Robert W.

The husband invites his friend to a game of chess, and the latter accepts. But as soon as they are engaged at the game the wife signals to the young man that she will wait for him at a table outside. He understands; and soon the husband becomes so engrossed in the game that he does not see that the man has departed, but continues to figure out the board with his eyes glued on the pieces. The other player meanwhile is kissing the wife to mutual satisfaction; and then he sees through the window that the husband has at last made his move. He dashes back to the table and makes the last move, winning the game.
