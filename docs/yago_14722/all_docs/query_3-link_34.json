His aristocratic bearing, his tall, stately appearance, and his talent for languages formed the foundation of his career.\n\nSince he wanted to become a writer, the eighteen-year-old Jürgens took a job as a reporter for the Acht-Uhr Abendblatt. He married actress Lulu Basler after conducting an interview with her. She and her mother, Maria Solani, a former silent film star, encouraged the strikingly handsome young man to become a film actor. To prepare himself, he read film magazines and took private acting lessons. When he applied for a job at the Ufa Studio in Neu-Babelsberg, he was discovered by Willi Forst, who hired him for the role of the young emperor Franz Joseph in Königswalzer (1935). The very next year Jürgens starred in Familienparade (1936), based on Georg Kaiser's Kolportage. In 1937 he was cast opposite Zarah Leander, the Swedish actress who was a celebrated film star in Germany, in Zu neuen Ufern (directed by Detlef Sierck). In this tendentious, anti-British film depicting the attempts of the former British penal colony Australia to achieve independence, Jürgens played a representative of the House of Lords.\n\nIn 1938, shortly before the Anschluss, Jürgens moved to Vienna after marrying Lulu Basler. The marriage did not last long, because their work kept them separated. Jürgens' career continued to advance rapidly, and he was hired at the Volkstheater. Initially the tall, blonde, blue-eyed German was regarded with suspicion; people considered him a Nazi. He lived in the so-called \"skyscraper\" in the center of Vienna, the favorite apartment house of artists and actors. Unknowingly, he not only moved into the former apartment of Hans Jaray, the popular film and stage star who had to emigrate, but he also assumed Jaray's position at the Volkstheater.\n\nIn the winter of 1939, at the age of 23, Jürgens became a member of the prestigious Burgtheater. He was soon welcomed into aristocratic circles, enjoying life at the Heurigen in the Viennese wine villages of Grinzing and Neustift, and for the rest of his life he remained attached to Vienna. His film career also flourished. In Karl Hartl's Mozart film Wen die Götter lieben, Jürgens as Emperor Franz Joseph must appear to play the violin. A genial trick was employed: Willi Boskovsky, the concert master of the Viennese Philharmonic, \"loaned\" him his bow arm.\n\nJürgens' mentor Willi Forst included him in almost all his films: as the composer Millöcker in Operetta, as \"Bandini\" in Frauen sind keine Engel, and as the Austrian ambassador Count Lechenperg in Forst's major production Wiener Mädel. Forst delayed completion of this film to save his crew of thousands from being sent to the front during World War II. During the filming Jürgens was attracted to the leading lady Judith Holzmeister, a fervent anti-Nazi and daughter of the world famous architect Clemens Holzmeister, who built the Salzburg Festival Theater. Shortly before the end of the war, despite Forst's support, Jürgens, classified as politically unreliable, was assigned to a work unit in the provinces.\n\nIn the chaotic postwar period Jürgens kept performing by organizing a theater tour in Bavaria before returning to Austria. To enable him to tour with the Burgtheater in Switzerland, he was granted Austrian citizenship. His wedding to Judith Holzmeister in Vienna with Willi Forst as his best man was treated as a major news event. Clemens Holzmeister built the couple a villa in fashionable Grinzing. In postwar Austria, where film was flourishing, Jürgens co-authored with his friend Kurt Heuser the screenplay Prämien auf den Tod (1949) and directed the film. Jürgens also wrote, directed, and starred in a second film, Gangsterpremiere.\n\nWhile performing with Oskar Werner in the French film Sturm über Alaska—for which the outdoor scenes were filmed in the Tyrol—the studio shots took Jürgens to Paris. At this time his home was the car, the plane, the film studio. One of his great assets as a European film star was his ability to dub his own films in his inimitable whiskey voice in Italian and French. A tour through the United States under the auspices of an exchange program opened a new world for him. The filming of Orient-Express, a German-French-Italian coproduction, took him to Rome for the first time. His tempestuous love affair with Eva Bartok kept his name in the scandal sheets. When he was making the film Das Bekenntnis der Ina Kahr with director G.W. Pabst in Germany, he cancelled his Burgtheater contract; he no longer wished to be a performing government official.\n\nThe now cosmopolitan Jürgens exchanged Berlin and Vienna for the in-places of the beautiful and rich in St. Tropez, London, and Rome. His wealth, fame, love affairs, and parties made more headlines in the illustrated and scandal magazines than his films. Following his divorce from Judith Holzmeister, he had a short-lived marriage with Eva Bartok. He enjoyed a major success in Des Teufels General, based on Carl Zuckmayer's play; Jürgens played the honorable pilot General Harras, who sells his soul to the devil because of his love of flying.\n\nIn 1957 Jürgens successfully made the leap to Hollywood, starring in Bitter Victory with Richard Burton. He now held court from his estate in Cap Ferrat near Monaco. Although he had a reputation for high living, he worked steadily and hard, making one film after the other, always with reliably good performances, although many of them with weak scripts. In another big war film, The Enemy Below (1957), he played an educated and sympathetic German submarine captain engaged in a life and death struggle with an American destroyer commander (Robert Mitchum). Hollywood filmmakers no longer deemed it necessary to present every German as a fanatical Nazi; they needed the German market.\n\nFor his next wife, the Algerian model Simone Bicheron, Jürgens acquired a home in Gstaad for the winter and exchanged his house in Cap Ferrat for a rose farm in Venice for the summers. To enable him to move internationally easily, he kept houses and apartments in New York, Paris, Vienna, Zurich and the Bahamas.\n\nAs an internationally acclaimed star, Jürgens made films with leading actresses like Brigitte Bardot (Et Dieu créa la femme), Ingrid Bergman (The Inn of the Sixth Happiness), and Lilli Palmer (Teufel in Seide). He starred with Danny Kaye in Me and the Colonel, based on Franz Werfel's comedy. Despite his many international movie roles, Jürgens returned occasionally to the theater: he played Jedermann at the Salzburg Festival, Sigmund Freud at the Theatre du Gymnase in Paris, and guest starred at the Vienna Burgtheater in Bertolt Brecht's Galilei Galilei. His continuous travel and indulgent lifestyle with alcohol and drugs resulted in a major heart operation and poor health in his last years. He married a last time, to Margie Schmitz. His flamboyant lifestyle sometimes overshadowed his accomplishments as a beloved actor in 152 films. Six years before his death, the German with the Austrian passport, whom the press liked to call the \"German oak,\" wrote his autobiography, an engaging reflection with literary quality. It was severely criticized at the time because of its candidness. In the memory of his friends Curd Jürgens remains forever the cultivated gentleman with the French manners; in the memory of his many fans he will always personify the true film star.\n\n—Gertraud Steiner Daviau"
