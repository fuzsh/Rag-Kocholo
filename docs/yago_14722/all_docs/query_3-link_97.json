        "text": "The first in producer Ivan Tors’ trilogy of films following the work of the fictitious Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI), Curt Siodmak’s The Magnetic Monster deserves some credit for at least trying to do something a bit different, though it loses a few points for a title that promises something it was never going to deliver, and which tries to have its cake and eat it. It was followed by Riders to the Stars (1953) and Gog (1953) and the OSI would turn up again, at least in name, as the agency that Steve Austin would later work for in The Six Million Dollar Man (1973-1978).\n\nOSI agents Dr Jeffrey Stewart (Richard Carlson) and Dr Dan Forbes (King Donovan) – dubbed A-men, where FBI agents were G-(for government) men – are sent to investigate a strange anomaly that has magnetised metal items in a small town appliance store and caused all the clocks to stop. The duo discovers an office above the store where they find a dead body and high signs of radioactivity but of the anomaly there’s no sign. They eventually track down Dr Howard Denker (Leonard Mudie), who has become ill while trying to fly out of the country and determine that the radiation poisoning him is coming from something he’s carrying in his briefcase. Before dying, he admits to having experimented with an artificial radioactive isotope, serranium, which has caused it take on a life of its own, becoming unstable, absorbing energy from its surroundings, and doubling in size and mass every 11 hours. As it grows, it releases more and more radiation and intense magnetic energy and the OSI team realise that in only a matter of weeks the isotope will become so heavy that it will affect the Earth’s rotation. The race is on to find a way to destroy the isotope before it destroys the world.\n\nThe screenplay, by Siodmak and Tors, tries to be a bit more scientifically rigorous than most 50s science fiction films and at least the technical stuff is written and delivered with some conviction. Without the benefit of at least a grounding in physics, it’s hard to know how accurate any of it is, but it at least sounds good – you’ll believe the science is real and that’s what really matters. In Stewart, we get an early example of the scientific hero that would become a staple in American science fiction films throughout the rest of the decade, learned men who face the many threats posed by giant insects, alien invasions and natural disasters with a degree of calming stoicism as they explain to us what’s going on.\n\nSiodmak doesn’t really offer anything particularly interesting in terms of the visuals, but ne pushes the story along at a brisk pace and makes a pretty good job of integrating the plentiful stock footage, much of it culled from the 1934 German science fiction film Gold directed by Karl Hartl. At times, the original film’s stars Hans Alber and Friedrich Kayßler are visible in long shots and don’t really match the physiques of Carlson and Donovan, but the huge and elaborate sets are nicely integrated during the climax where they stand in for the Deltatron project site in Canada where the isotope has been taken to bombard it with a gigavolt of electricity, and they lend the film a real air of class. The production was also able to make use of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory’s huge MANIAC (Mathematical Analyzer Numerical Integrator and Automatic Computer) and UCLA’s own mechanical computer, the differential analyzer for added scientific verisimilitude.\n\nCommendably, the script sidesteps the usual Communist or Nazi villains and there’s not even any of the red-bashing subtexts so prevalent elsewhere. There’s no villain at all really, except for the isotope and it cares nothing for petty politics – it just wants to feed and feed until it destroys us all. If there’s a “villain” at all, it’s scientific hubris – Denker has undertaken somewhat eccentric research for no apparent reason and without any safety nets, resulting in a deadly and seemingly unstoppable force. It’s an unusual approach that one wishes more films of the period had taken.\n\nThe cast are as brisk and efficient as the plot, Carlson making the first of what would be a string of appearances in 50s science fiction films (The Maze (1953), It Came from Outer Space (1953), Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and Riders to the Stars (which he also directed) though he’s playing a different character there)), and Donovan was en route to encounters with both The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and the alien invaders of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1955). Both make for solid heroes and it’s a shame they didn’t keep them together for the next two films, though poor Jean Byron is lumbered with the usual under-written female lead role as Stewart’s wife. Some have complained that the domestic scenes between the couple are a distraction and unnecessary, but they anchor the film in the “real” world, gives us a break from the relentless scientific theorising (fascinating though it is) and helps to show what the agents of OSI are fighting to protect.\n\nThe Magnetic Monster (that title really does it no favours) is second tier 50s American science fiction, but it’s a cut or several above the rest of its division. The climax is commendably tense stuff and the whole is solid, unpretentious and entertaining, a fast-moving, intelligent and suspenseful addition to that sprawling boom in genre films made during the decade. There’s a dash of film noir among the science fiction concepts, a gripping procedural as the team slowly unravel what the mystery is then put their lives on the line to save the world. The best of the OSI trilogy, The Magnetic Monster is an unassuming film but it’s never a dull one and it’s stood the test of time rather well. Worth watching when you’ve had your fill of invading extra-terrestrials, Commie-bashing parables and mad scientists up to no good."
