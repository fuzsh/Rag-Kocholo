        "text": "By: Alyssa Evans\n\nLava Bear Films\n\nBest sci-fi movie from the year you were born\n\nLooking up at the night sky, it’s easy to understand why science fiction exists. It can be a difficult genre to define, but at its core, each work of science fiction deals with a great unknown. Said unknown can probe the mystery of what resides alongside us in the universe, or it can pose the question of what we, as humans, are capable of with technology.\n\nIt is also one of the best escapes, distractions, or parallels given viewers’ situations and perspectives. During tough times like the current COVID-19 pandemic and resulting isolation for many, we hope this list of great sci-fi films provides at minimum some inspirations, and at most some reprieve.\n\nThe art of speculative fiction was cemented with the publication of Mary Shelley’s novel “Frankenstein” in the early 19th century. Science fiction began cropping up consistently in literature, but it didn’t really reach cinema until what many consider to be the first science fiction film: Georges Méliès’ “A Trip to the Moon,” released in 1902. From there, the genre spent many of its first decades mired in B-grade Hollywood classics as filmmakers struggled to visually depict the intricacies of many science fiction plots. While other genres such as fantasy can rely on absolute suspension of disbelief to produce a good story, science fiction is arguably unique in the demand it places on viewers and filmmakers alike: The viewer will only sacrifice what logic dictates if the world depicted by the filmmakers is somehow entirely believable.\n\nWe start our quest to find the best science fiction film the year you were born in 1920. Stacker created an index that equally weights each film’s IMDb score and Rotten Tomatoes critic rating (when available) to rank all science fiction films in a given year. The film with the highest Stacker Score is what you see here.\n\nA genre that reaches to put humanity in context with the makings of the universe, science fiction has spawned many of the greatest philosophical films the 20th and 21st centuries have to offer. As the popularity of the recent TV series “Black Mirror” suggests, we are more focused on the dark possibilities of technology than ever before. In this day and age, science fiction may be the closest thing we have to a prophetic work.\n\nYou may also like: 50 ways music has changed in the last 50 years\n\nFamous Players-Lasky Corporation\n\n1920: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\n\n- Director: John S. Robertson\n\n- Stacker Score: 81\n\n- Runtime: 49 min\n\nA doctor drove to prove that evil and good exist in everyone accidentally unleashes his evil alter-ego: Mr. Hyde. Starring John Barrymore as both titular characters, “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” is the first of many films inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson’s novel.\n\nMilano Film\n\n1921: The Mechanical Man\n\n- Director: André Deed\n\n- Stacker Score: 61\n\n- Runtime: 80 min\n\nOne of the first science fiction films produced in Italy, “The Mechanical Man” is about a robot that ends up in the wrong hands; to counter his criminal activities, another robot is built. The film has somewhat of a cult following, as much of its footage is presumed to be lost.\n\nCosmopolitan Production\n\n1922: The Young Diana\n\n- Director: Albert Capellani and Robert G. Vignola\n\n- Stacker Score: 61\n\n- Runtime: 90 min\n\nStarring Marion Davis in the titular role and directed by Albert Capellani and Robert G. Vignola, “The Young Diana” is about a young woman whose father pushes her to marry into British nobility, despite her feelings for a sailor. Throughout the story, Diana is also pursued by a scientist consumed with searching for the elixir of life.\n\nFrank Lloyd Productions\n\n1923: Black Oxen\n\n- Director: Albert Capellani\n\n- Stacker Score: 64\n\n- Runtime: 80 min\n\n“Black Oxen” is not considered a science fiction film in the strictest sense, but at the heart of its romantic conflict lies a twist futuristic enough to make it the best sci-fi film of 1923. A philanderer (Conway Teele) falls in love with a beautiful European countess (Corinne Griffith), before realizing that her timeless looks may be a clue to a much larger secret.\n\nFox Film Corporation\n\n1924: The Last Man on Earth\n\n- Director: John G. Blystone\n\n- Stacker Score: 60\n\n- Runtime: 70 min\n\nAs many of the earliest science fiction films did, “The Last Man on Earth” found its inspiration from Mary Shelley’s novel, “The Last Man.” Tapping into a timeless fear, “The Last Man on Earth” is about a plague that wiped out every fertile man on Earth over the age of 14—until an aviator (Grace Cunard) finds a reclusive man in the woods (Earle Foxe). The film spirals into a comedy as women everywhere begin to fight over Foxe.\n\nYou may also like: Longest-running TV series\n\nColonna-Film GmbH\n\n1925: Our Heavenly Bodies\n\n- Director: Hanns Walter Kornblum\n\n- Stacker Score: 68\n\n- Runtime: 92 min\n\nAn experimental piece, “Our Heavenly Bodies” is a German, patchwork science fiction film that attempts the impossible: to explain human knowledge of the world and the universe in just 92 minutes. The film combines documentary clips, historical documents, and underlying fictional elements to ultimately produce a piece unlike any preceding its release.\n\nMezhrabpom-Rus\n\n1926: The Adventures of the Three Reporters\n\n- Directors: Boris Barnet, Fyodor Otsep\n\n- Stacker Score: 70\n\n- Runtime: 250 min\n\nThis Soviet spy film was released nearly a decade after WWI and the Bolshevik Revolution, serving as a compelling piece of political propaganda. The movie, also known as “Miss Mend,” focuses on a trio of reporters trying to defeat an evil Western enemy intent on launching an attack on the USSR.\n\nUniversum Film (UFA)\n\n1927: Metropolis\n\n- Director: Fritz Lang\n\n- Stacker Score: 91\n\n- Runtime: 153 min\n\n“Metropolis” is considered by many to be a pioneering science fiction film, as one of the first feature-length releases of its kind. Firmly in the science fiction realm, “Metropolis” takes place in a dystopian, urban world where the city ruler’s son (Gustav Fröhlich) falls in love with a woman from the industrial working class who was forced to toil beneath the city (Brigitte Helm). “Metropolis” is still obsessed over to this day, and recent attempts have recovered most of the film’s lost footage.\n\nHelmut Schreiber\n\n1928: Alraune (A Daughter of Destiny)\n\n- Director: Henrik Galeen\n\n- Stacker Score: 62\n\n- Runtime: 108 minutes\n\n“Alraune” explores a german professor (Paul Wegener) as he seeks to validate old German folklore that a root buried in the Earth is said to absorb men’s power as they die, and is used in love potions. He attempts to impregnate a prostitute in a strange, twisted experiment.\n\nGaumont British Picture Corporation\n\n1929: High Treason\n\n- Director: Maurice Elvey\n\n- Stacker Score: 62\n\n- Runtime: 95 min\n\nArguably inspired by the notable “Metropolis,” “High Treason” looks at conflict on the scale of a World War: The \"United States of Europe\" (Europe, India, the Middle East, Canada, Africa, and Australasia) come into conflict with the “Empire of the Atlantic States” (the United States and South America). Dr. Seymour (played by Humberston Wright) desperately attempts to ease tensions between the two supernations alongside his daughter, Evelyn (Benita Hume).\n\nYou may also like: 50 of the best albums by LGBTQ+ musicians\n\nRichard-Oswald-Produktion\n\n1930: Alraune\n\n- Director: Richard Oswald\n\n- Stacker Score: 63\n\n- Runtime: 103 min\n\nAnother German science fiction feat, “Alraune” (a remake of the 1928 version by the same name) is based on the same old, German myth. A root buried in the Earth is said to absorb men’s power as they die, and is used in love potions; in “Alraune,” a scientist (Albert Bassermann) artificially inseminates a prostitute who then conceives a beautiful girl (Brigitte Helm) incapable of love.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n1931: Frankenstein\n\n- Director: James Whale\n\n- Stacker Score: 89.5\n\n- Runtime: 70 min\n\nThe first of many film adaptations of Mary Shelley’s novel, “Frankenstein” is part horror, part cautionary tale of what happens when man tries to play God. A scientist (Colin Clive) is consumed by the desire to create human life; with his assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), he digs up a body and attempts to bring it to life. The result? A maybe murderous but certainly monstrous, and ultimately misunderstood, beast.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n1932: Island of Lost Souls\n\n- Director: Erle C. Kenton\n\n- Stacker Score: 85.5\n\n- Runtime: 70 min\n\nGive a mad scientist an island, animals, and some surgical equipment and you’ll have the plot of “Island of Lost Souls.” Edward Parker (Richard Arlen) finds himself on an isolated island after being thrown overboard, where he finds a scientist (Charles Laughton) accompanied only by a gentle girl, Lota (Kathleen Burke). Although the film was based on H.G. Wells’ novel “The Island of Doctor Moreau,” Wells felt the focus on horror in the film detracted from its underlying philosophical quandaries.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n1933: The Invisible Man\n\n- Director: James Whale\n\n- Stacker Score: 88.5\n\n- Runtime: 71 min\n\nBased on the H.G. Wells novel of the same name, “The Invisible Man” is about chemist Dr. Jack Griffin (Claude Rains), who discovers the secret of invisibility through experimentation with a dangerous drug. Struck by power, or perhaps just driven mad by the drug, Griffin begins committing a series of murders, intent on destroying the world.\n\nUniversum Film (UFA)\n\n1934: Gold\n\n- Director: Karl Hartl\n\n- Stacker Score: 69\n\n- Runtime: 120 min\n\nAs many early science fiction films go, “Gold” focuses on a scientist’s misguided quest. Werner Holk, played by Hans Albers, discovers how to turn lead into gold—and faces the consequences as evil powers fight to unlock his secret.\n\nYou may also like: 111 monumental movies from film history and why you need to see them\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n1935: Bride of Frankenstein\n\n- Director: James Whale\n\n- Stacker Score: 89.5\n\n- Runtime: 75 min\n\nThe first of many sequels to “Frankenstein,” “The Bride of Frankenstein” is actually considered a worthy counterpart to its predecessor: Both score a whopping 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film picks up where “Frankenstein” ends, with Dr. Frankenstein (reprised by Colin Clive) being goaded into creating a mate for his original monster—thus is born the Bride of Frankenstein (Elsa Lanchester).\n\nLondon Film Productions\n\n1936: Things to Come\n\n- Director: William Cameron Menzie\n\n- Stacker Score: 79.5\n\n- Runtime: 100 min\n\nAnother H.G. Wells-inspired science fiction film, “Things to Come” was the most expensive film produced in England in 1936, pushing past the million-dollar mark. It is especially noted for its bold cinematic design; perhaps why critics award it 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film stars Raymond Massey, who plays a pilot in a world thrown into madness by war.\n\nMoldavia Film\n\n1937: Skeleton on Horseback\n\n- Director: Hugo Haas\n\n- Stacker Score: 75\n\n- Runtime: 78 min\n\nA Czechoslovak science fiction drama, “Skeleton on Horseback” depicts a deadly plague breaking out in the midst of a war. Dr. Galen, played by Hugo Haas, attempts to find a cure—and some peace for his suffering nation.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n1938: Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars\n\n- Directors: Ford Beebe, Robert F. Hill, Frederick Stephani\n\n- Stacker Score: 74\n\n- Runtime: 299 min\n\n“Flash Gordon’s Trip to Mars” is actually a serial film, with 15 chapters to enjoy. They were screened weekly in U.S. theaters until the series concluded. Inspired by a comic strip, the plot follows Flash Gordon (played by Buster Crabbe) on his adventures to try to save Earth from a mysterious, destructive light beam.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n1939: Son of Frankenstein\n\n- Director: Rowland V. Lee\n\n- Stacker Score: 81.5\n\n- Runtime: 99 min\n\nAnother sequel to “Frankenstein,” “Son of Frankenstein” features Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), the son of Dr. Frankenstein, who travels to his family castle to redeem his father’s mistakes. His first step? Digging up the Monster. “Son of Frankenstein” is only the third installment in the “Frankenstein” film series, but it is the last to feature Boris Karloff as the monster.\n\nYou may also like: Mistakes from the 50 best movies of all time\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n1940: Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe\n\n- Director: Ford Beebe, Ray Taylor\n\n- Stacker Score: 79.5\n\n- Runtime: 220 min\n\nThe third of the “Flash Gordon” serial films, “Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe” brings extraterrestrial problems a little closer to home: A plague, known as Purple Death, ravages the Earth. Flash (played again by Buster Crabbe) takes to the stars to find a cure and figure out where the plague is coming from.\n\nKinostudiya imeni M. Gorkogo\n\n1941: Tainstvennyy ostrov\n\n- Director: Eduard Pentslin\n\n- Stacker Score: 72\n\n- Runtime: 75 min\n\n“Tainstvennyy Ostrov” (also known as “Mysterious Island”) is a USSR-produced film set in the American Civil War. Five prisoners of war escape via hot air balloon and crash-land on an island in the South Pacific, where inexplicable things begin to happen.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n1942: The Ghost of Frankenstein\n\n- Director: Erle C. Kenton\n\n- Stacker Score: 68\n\n- Runtime: 67 min\n\nThe fourth film in the “Frankenstein” series, “The Ghost of Frankenstein” reunites us once again with the Frankenstein family. When Ygor (Bela Lugosi) finds the Monster, he brings the creature to Henry Frankenstein’s other son, Ludwig (Cedric Hardwicke). It is from this film that the Frankenstein Monster stereotype—the blinded creature walking with arms outstretched and bandages wrapped around his head—was born.\n\nRepublic Pictures (I)\n\n1943: The Fighting Devil Dogs\n\n- Director: William Witney, John English\n\n- Stacker Score: 68\n\n- Runtime: 69 min\n\nOriginally released in 1938, the serial film “The Fighting Devil Dogs” came out in 1943 as a feature version. Although not considered to be the greatest serial film ever made, “The Fighting Devil Dogs” is famous for its costumed supervillain, The Lightning (Hugh Sothern). Lieutenants Tom Grayson (Lee Powell) and Frank Corby (Herman Brix) spend the movie fighting the villainous, masked man, whose lightning-based arsenal makes him a worthy opponent.\n\nRepublic Pictures (I)\n\n1944: Captain America\n\n- Director: Elmer Clifton, John English\n\n- Stacker Score: 60\n\n- Runtime: 244 min\n\nThe “Captain America” serial film brought one extremely significant thing to cinema: Marvel superheroes, who wouldn’t be seen again in theaters for another four decades. “Captain America” follows District Attorney Grant Gardner (played by Dick Purcell, who died from congestive heart failure shortly after the film’s completion) as he tries to thwart the insidious plotting of The Scarab (Lionel Atwill). Fans, be warned—“Captain America” differs from the original comic book strip in a number of ways.\n\nYou may also like: Best and worst Leonardo DiCaprio movies\n\nRepublic Pictures (I)\n\n1945: Manhunt of Mystery Island\n\n- Directors: Spencer Gordon Bennet, Yakima Canutt, Wallace Grissell\n\n- Stacker Score: 72\n\n- Runtime: 219 min\n\nAnother serial produced by Republic (who also did “Captain America” and “The Fighting Devil Dogs”), the “Manhunt of Mystery Island” centers around Claire Forrest (Linda Starling) in her quest to find and rescue her father (Forrest Taylor), trapped on a mysterious island, alongside private detective Lance Reardon (Richard Bailey).\n\nStella Productions (II)\n\n1946: L'ennemi sans Visage\n\n- Directors : Robert-Paul Dagan, Maurice Cammage\n\n- Stacker Score: 49\n\n- Runtime: 105 min\n\nA French science fiction film, “L'Ennemi sans visage” (“Eyes without a Face”) stars Louise Carletti, Frank Villard, and Roger Karl.
