Photo: Ufa. <b>Sybille Schmitz</b> and <b>Hans Albers</b> in <i>F.P.1 antwortet nicht/F.P.1 Doesn't Answer</i> (Karl Hartl, 1932).\n\t\n\tThe science fiction film F.P.1 does not answer was made in 1932 for UFA and directed by Karl Hartl. The feature film, shot in black and white, is based on the novel of the same name by Kurt Siodmak, published in 1931. Three versions were shot in different languages. The German-language film version stars Hans Albers, Sybille Schmitz and Paul Hartmann. The first screening in Germany took place on 22 December 1932 at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo in Berlin.\n\t\n\tPlot: Captain Lieutenant Droste (Paul Hartmann) wants to build a flying platform in the middle of the ocean to offer the pilots of the intercontinental flights a stopover facility for refuelling and for repairs to their aircraft. With the help of the pilot Ellissen (Hans Albers), he succeeds in winning over the management of the Lennartz Works to his project. Ellissen, who has taken up with Claire Lennartz (Sybille Schmitz), a sister of the owners, shies away from marriage and seeks a new adventure. Meanwhile, the platform is built under Droste's direction. After two years, a city has emerged on the ocean with an airfield, hangars, hotels and shopping centres. During a storm, the connection to the flight platform breaks down. The last thing heard over the phone was gunshots and screams. The storm continues and it takes the best pilot to approach F.P.1 (short for &quot;Flight Platform 1&quot;). Ellissen, who has realised in the meantime that Claire means much more to him after all, is depressed because Claire has distanced herself from him in the meantime. Nevertheless, he lets her persuade him to fly to the platform with her. The two reach the island and survive a crash landing. The crew of F.P.1 has fallen victim to a saboteur who has stunned them with gas. Before the culprit, chief engineer Damsky (Hermann Speelmans), fled with a boat, he opened the valves so that F.P.1 is in danger of sinking. Claire finds the seriously injured Droste and takes care of him. Ellissen has to realise that he has lost Claire for good. After a short time, however, he pulls himself together and takes off in a plane to get help. When he finally sees a ship, he jumps out of his plane, is taken on board by the ship's crew and is able to radio for help. A fleet of ships and planes sets out to rescue F.P.1.\n\t\n\tJovial, (in his later years) pleasantly plump <b>Hans Albers</b> (1891 – 1960) was a superstar of the German cinema between 1930 and 1945. He was also one of the most popular German singers of the twentieth century. His song <i>Auf der Reeperbahn nachts um halb eins</i> (On the Reeperbahn at half past midnight) is the unofficial anthem of Hamburg’s neighborhood of St. Pauli, famous for its brothels, music and night clubs.\n\t\n\tBeautiful German actress <b>Sybille Schmitz</b> (1909-1955) started her career in the era of silent cinema. With her typical face and her relaxed, slightly mysterious way of playing, she became a prominent Ufa star during the Third Reich. After the war, she was beset by drug abuse and depression and at 45, she committed suicide.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
