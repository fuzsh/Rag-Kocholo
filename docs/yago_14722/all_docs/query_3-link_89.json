        "text": "In the recent past, many 20th century scholars have started rewriting the images, perceptions, and investigations into World War I. The consensus forged in the interwar periods, the alleged role of German atrocities, and the role of Allied propaganda are being reexamined now. Filmmakers are one of the social conduits reflecting and commenting about society and the times. Good films can raise awareness and be a start to addressing local and global issues. They can educate about cultures, and provides a broader political, religious, or social context. They can dispel long-held misconceptions as well as be a catalyst for social change.\n\nThe relation between war and cinema, propaganda and cinema is a most intriguing area, located at the intersection of media studies, history and film aesthetics. A truly tragic moment in human history, the First World War was also the first to be fought before film cameras. And while in the field, airborne reconnaissance became cinematic (Virilio), domestic propaganda occupied the screen of the newly emergent national cinemas, only to see its lucid message challenged and even subverted by the fast-evolving language of cinema. Part one of this paper looks at three non-fiction films, released in 1916: Battle of Somme, With Our Heroes at the Somme (Bei unseren Helden an der Somme) and Battle of Somme (La Bataille de la Somme), as paradigmatic propaganda takes on the eponymous historical battle from British, German and French points of view. Part two analyses two war-time Hollywood melodramas, David Wark Griffith’s Hearts of the World (1918) and Allen Holubar’s The Heart of Humanity (1919), and explains the longevity of the former with the powerful “text effect” of the authentic wartime footage included. Thus, while these WWI propaganda works do validate Virilio’s ideas of the integral connections between technology, war and cinema, and between cinema and propaganda, they also herald the emancipation of post WWI film language.\n\nThe First World War played a significant role in the evolution of film both as a medium for reporting war and as a tool for the propagandist manipulation of public opinion to support the war effort. It affected the perception of cinema as a socially acceptable medium, influenced the development of certain genres of film, and affected patterns of cinema attendance and film distribution around the world."
