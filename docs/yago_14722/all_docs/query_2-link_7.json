The film is a biopic of the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.[1] It was made as a co-production between the giant German studio UFA and Wien-Film which had been set up following the German annexation of Austria. The film was part of a wider attempt by the Nazis to portray Mozart as an authentic German hero. Like many German biopics of the war years, it portrays the composer as a pioneering visionary.\n\nThe title refers to Mozart's middle name Amadeus (Latin for \"love God\") and to the aphorism \"he whom the gods love, dies young\" (Latin: \"quem di diligunt, adolescens moritur\") from Plautus' Bacchides, lines 816–17, and earlier Greek sources, including Homer's mention of Trophonius; Mozart died at the age of 35.\n\nA British film of the same title had been released in 1936.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nHans Holt as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nIrene von Meyendorff as Luisa Weber Langer\n\nWinnie Markus as Konstanze Weber Mozart\n\nPaul Hörbiger as Von Strack\n\nWalter Janssen as Leopold Mozart\n\nRosa Albach-Retty as Frau Mozart\n\nAnnie Rosar as Frau Weber\n\nRené Deltgen as Ludwig van Beethoven\n\nThea Weis as Sophie Weber\n\nSusi Witt [de] as Josepha Weber\n\nCurd Jürgens as Emperor Joseph II\n\nHans Siebert as Duke of Mannheim\n\nRichard Eybner as Baron von Gemmingen\n\nFritz Imhoff as Albrechtsberger\n\nKarl Blühm [de] as Hoeffer\n\nErich Nikowitz [de] as Süssmayr\n\nDoris Hild\n\nGeorg Lorenz [de]\n\nPepi Glöckner-Kramer [de]\n\nFranz Herterich\n\nOtto Schmöle\n\nTheodor Danegger\n\nAlfred Neugebauer\n\nFerdinand Mayerhofer [de]\n\nWilli Hufnagel [de]\n\nHermann Erhardt\n\nLouise Kartousch\n\nErna Berger as Singer\n\nSiegmund Roth as Singer\n\nKarl Schmitt-Walter as Singer\n\nDagmar Söderquist as Singer\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mozart Story (re-edited version for the USA, 1948)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nHake, Sabine.
