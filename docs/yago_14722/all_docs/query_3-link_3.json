The other cast members aren't well known to me, but there's a decent Constanze here, plus her sister Lusia, and Mozart's muse from 'The Magic Flute', Anna.\n\nEven in an old and damaged print, the colours are lovely, the music is sumptuous, and the centre of Vienna is easily recognisable (not sure if it was filmed here or reconstructed, but itâ€¦"
