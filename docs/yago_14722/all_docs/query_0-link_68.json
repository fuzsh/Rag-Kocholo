        "text": "On WERNER: articles—\n\nCurrent Biography 1966 , New York, 1966.\n\nObituary in New York Times , 24 October 1984.\n\n\"Austrian Stage and Screen Actor Oskar Werner Dies in Germany,\" in Variety (New York), 31 October 1984.\n\nObituary in Revue du Cinéma (Paris), January 1985.\n\nHairapetian, M., \"Charmant, besessen, unbestechlich,\" in Filmwaerts , December 1992.\n\nStars (Mariembourg), Autumn 1994.\n\n* * *\n\nOskar Werner once stated that \"I don't like films, I only do it for the money. I'm married to the theater, films are only my mistress,\" so it is not surprising that theater played a considerably larger role in his life than cinema. At 18 he joined the Burgtheater in Vienna, the Austrian equivalent of Britain's Old Vic, and soon made a considerable mark, playing in over 50 productions before being drafted into the army in 1941. After the war he became something of a German stage idol, and also turned his attention to films.\n\nHis first major screen role, in Angel with a Trumpet , brought him to the notice of Anatole Litvak, and he was hired by Twentieth Century-Fox to play in Decision before Dawn as a conscience-stricken, anti-Nazi German prisoner of war who volunteers to spy for the Allies behind enemy lines. But, Hollywood had nothing of interest to offer him after this and he returned to Europe. His Hamlet in Frankfurt in 1953 was regarded as one of the great interpretations of the time, and assured Werner a key position in the postwar German theater pantheon. He was sometimes referred to as the Laurence Olivier of the continent, and in 1959 he founded his own theatrical troupe, the Theater Ensemble Oskar Werner.\n\nIn 1955 he appeared in, among other films, Ophüls' Lola Montès and Pabst's The Last Ten Days , but it was not until 1961 that he made the first of the films for which he is best known. This was Jules et Jim , which introduced Werner's incredibly boyish good looks and characteristic sense of melancholy to burgeoning \"art house\" audiences everywhere. Another sensitive, soulful role followed, this time in a Hollywood context, in Stanley Kramer's Ship of Fools , where he played a romantically world-weary doctor opposite Simone Signoret. Perhaps concerned at being typecast in sensitive, troubled parts he then took on the role of a hard-line East German Communist in The Spy Who Came In from the Cold , in which he was surprisingly convincing. The same year, however, he returned both to Truffaut and to another quietly agonised role as a book-burning fireman who has a change of heart in Fahrenheit 451 . (Curiously, Truffaut and Werner died within two days of each other.)"
