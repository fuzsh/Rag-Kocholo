        "text": "DODGE COUNTY, Ga. (WGXA) -- Parents of students in Dodge County Schools say teachers and staff are taking away from important class time by punishing their children for what they believe to be overly strict dress code violations. With the school system's low test scores, those parents say the focus has shifted to the wrong subject.\n\n\"They've got clothes on their backs,\" said Lori Grammatica.\" \"It's not keeping the teachers from being able to teach your children.\"\n\nGrammatica is the mother of two teenage boys, one in middle school, and one in high school. Her son was reprimanded Thursday by staff who cited his shorts as being 'too short'. Her son is 6'5. She said it's difficult to find shorts to buy that hit below the school system's dress code rule of 'no higher than three inches above the knee.\"\n\n\"These kids are wearing what their parents provided for them to be able to go to school,\" said Grammatica.\n\nParents spoke about their concerns following the Dodge County School Board meeting held on Thursday. They say they're upset their children are being disciplined for what they think should be considered appropriate clothing and hair to wear to class.\n\n\"We had problems last year too, but they've gone a lot further this year,\" she said. \"One of the main problems I have is staff saying they own my children.\"\n\nGrammatica says she's heard on several occasions that school staff are telling students 'they own them'.\n\n\"Apparently, it's a phrase that the administration is using now... that they own our children,\" she said. \"They don't own my children; hey didn't give birth to them, they don't feed them, they don't take care of them...Yes, they are their responsibility.\"\n\nHowever, Grammatica said Dodge County Schools are overreaching their control. This isn't the first time she's had issues with school staff monitoring what her children wear.\n\n\"My son wore blue jeans and one of the teachers made a comment that his pants were too tight and she could see his bulge,\" said Grammatica. \"Why was she looking in his area?\".\n\nLavette Harrell, another mother of a high school student, overheard what Grammatica shared and asked the same question:\n\n\"Number one, why [are] you looking down there? Why [are] you looking below that the baby's waist like that? You don't have any business. We already have a prior history with teachers doing things that they shouldn't be doing.\"\n\nHarrell said when it comes to Dodge County's Dress code, its school system overreach.\n\n\"It's entirely too much and the scores show it,\" she said. \"They're concentrating on the wrong stuff.\"\n\nShe says that focus is reflected in Dodge County's failing student test scores. Now that school has started back it's the students feeling low after being sent home for breaking rules sometimes left up to interpretation.\n\nCarol Love's niece was sent home for having burgundy color intertwined into her braided hair.\n\n\"She was crying upset about it, very upset about it,\" said Love.\n\nHer niece was sent home for having color.\n\n\"Yesterday she was told that it was distracting, that it's not a natural hair color, and that she had to get it out,\" she added.\n\nThe handbook states no unnaturally dyed hair color or any other distracting colors aren't allowed.\n\nDodge County Schools Superintendant, Dr. Susan Long, wouldn't speak with WGXA's Gloria Ruth Finney regarding the student handbook, dress code, or parental concerns. Finney wanted to ask Dr. Long why school staff are permitted to dress in ways that violate the same standards in which students are held; as well as why the rules appear vague and left up for interpretation.\n\nParents said the rules are outdated, and adding violations made by students are more distracting to punish, rather than the violations themselves. However, they said school uniforms aren't the solution when added control is the problem."
