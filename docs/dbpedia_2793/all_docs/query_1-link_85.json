WMAZ-TV reports that all county business is at a standstill after Monday's early morning fire.\n\nOne commissioner says people who have to pay bills may get a grace period. The county clerk says employees still will be paid.\n\nState authorities have said the fire caused about $5.5 million in damage to the Hancock County Courthouse which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The cause of the fire is undetermined and no evidence of foul play was found."
