        "text": "Residents of Telfair and surrounding counties gathered at Oconee Fall Line Technical College’s (OFTC) Open House event at the Little Ocmulgee Instructional Center (LOIC) in McRae-Helena, Thursday, July 7.\n\nThe ‘Family Affair’ themed event aimed to provide local residents with an opportunity to learn more about local career training and educational opportunities available at LOIC.\n\n“We really wanted to be out here today to show the people in Telfair County that we care about their futures,” shared Dr. Saketha Adams, OFTC’s Vice President of Student Affairs. “Whether someone is looking to start college for the first time or wants to go back to school to advance themselves, we have programs that can help them create a bright future for themselves and their families.”\n\nAdams even mentioned short term training opportunities that allow students to earn a credential in as little as one semester or less.\n\n“All of our programs can be completed in 2 years or less, and we even offer certain technical certificates of credit that can be completed in as little as one semester. That’s one semester and then that person is employable with a certain skill,” she said.\n\nAttendees enjoyed free drinks and hotdogs, and even participated in carnival themed games and activities that were created to help participants learn more about various opportunities and resources available at OFTC.\n\n“We wanted to make it fun and exciting,” shared OFTC’s student recruiter, Denisha Brown. “So, coming up with creative ways to talk about financial aid, the admissions process, and the various programs available was important to us. We wanted this to be an event the entire family could enjoy.”\n\nAnd despite the hot weather, families came out and enjoyed the free festivities and some even made plans to enroll and start classes at OFTC in August.\n\nTo learn more about OFTC’s 130+ programs of study or how to enroll, visit the college’s website OFTC.edu."
