        "text": "DODGE COUNTY, Ga. (WGXA) --- South Dodge Elementary School and North Dodge Elementary School will consolidate next year, respectively to become Dodge County Primary School and Dodge County Elementary School. The primary school will include the entirety of the county's public student enrollment in grades pre-kindergarten through second grade students, with all public-school students in grades third through fifth to attend the elementary school.\n\nAn information meeting was held Tuesday at what is currently North Dodge Elementary. School staff and some parents said it’s a big change for Dodge County Schools, having one primary and one elementary instead of two elementary schools, but said they expect any benefits to outweigh any inconvenience.\n\nKaren Rogers is a parent with children in Dodge County Schools. Her children will attend the soon-to-be sole elementary school. She said though it may be a slight hassle for some parents with children attending both schools to get them dropped off and picked up, she said it will probably only add another 10 minutes of commute time. She said she also believed having all of the teachers of the same grade being able to work together and co-collaborate with benefit the students.\n\n“I guess overall it probably helps the students out better,\" said Rogers. “I think it’s good where all the existing students in their same class can kind of work together better\".\n\nAnother positive, North Dodge Elementary School Principal, Dr. Sheila Honeycutt, said to introduce students to each other, and have them learning together at an earlier age, will lessen the some of the struggles some students experience with transition to middle school.\n\n\"When you grew up in two different schools and you come in middle school; middle school is already a difficult age, so if we can decrease that and we become friends at a younger age, that’s going to definitely benefit them instructionally,\" said Dr. Honeycutt.\n\nSchool officials said bus routes will not change.\n\nDodge County Schools will host another informational meeting Mar. 16, at 6 pm. This meeting will be at what is currently South Dodge Elementary School."
