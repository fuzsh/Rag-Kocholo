        "text": "The Choice Bus visits Dodge County Middle School, other Eastman schools\n\nEastman, Georgia (41NBC/WMGT) – Nearly 1,000 students from Dodge County Middle, North Dodge County Elementary, and South Dodge County Elementary schools will board The Choice Bus due to a collaboration between State Farm® and the Mattie C. Stewart Foundation.\n\nThe half-prison cell, half-classroom converted school bus, which visually portrays two different life perspectives, visited students in Dodge County on Tuesday.\n\nStudents received a firsthand look at what education can bring – at least $1 million over a person’s lifetime if they graduate from college.\n\nLead presenter Chet Benock says that speaking to the students at an early age about the consequences of making life choices can help students in the long term.\n\n“Our mission is to increase the graduation rate and decrease the dropout rate. We want students to know that their education is important and after high school, they do have a choice to go to college or to find a skilled job,” Benock said.\n\nThe bus is one of six tools created by The Mattie C. Stewart Foundation devoted to helping reduce the dropout rate in the United States. Since 2008, The Choice Bus visited more than two million students in 25 states."
