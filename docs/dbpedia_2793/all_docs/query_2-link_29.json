        "text": "The Georgia High School High Tech program is partnering with the State Farm Foundation to host teen drivers’ education training for ten Meriwether County High School students. The State Farm Good Neighborhood Citizenship grant award has made it possible for students to participate in a drivers training classes in the first semester of school year 2023-2024 for ten students enrolled in the Meriwether County High School High Tech program.\n\nThrough the grant, students meet weekly to prepare for the written exam they must pass to obtain their learner’s permit. At the conclusion of the training, students will be transported by Meriwether County School System to the Department of Driver’s Services to take the written test. Faye Williams with High School High Tech and Ms. Brandy Perry with Meriwether County School System are coordinating the training sessions with the trainer and Greenville High School. Over 90% of these students pass the drivers training test.\n\nLocal State Farm representative Faye Perdue visited the class to meet the students and present the check. Faye Perdue is also a member of the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency Board of Directors who provide funding for other High School High Tech transition activities. We are thrilled that the Meriwether County HSHT students are benefitting from our partnership with the State Farm Foundation.\n\n​Twenty-six students from the Jackson County High School High Tech Program participated in a manufacturing institute at the Empower College & Career Center, Jefferson, Georgia. Students participated in a 3-day training by certified trainers and were awarded 3 industry recognized certificates that will assist them with getting employment in the field of manufacturing. The certificates that the students earned were OSHA10, Hands Only CPR/AED and Lean Six Sigma White Belt Training.

The educational excursion was one that will not be easily forgotten.\n\nUpon their arrival the students were greeted by two of the zoologists, Jess and Lucy who are employees at the zoo. They conduct research and promote educational advancement for the well­being or the animals in zoos. They explained that their jobs are rewarding because of their love for animals and very exciting because they get to be a part of something new and different every day.\n\nAs the students started the journey through the jungle, they were surprised to learn how many careers it takes to care for just one animal alone. Jess explained that each living species requires different needs to make their life and living habitat conducive and much like what living would be like in the wild. Engineers must study and design living quarters so that the animals will have a sense of home versus confinement. To keep the animals stimulated their surroundings must be altered very often from adding manipulatives to creating games for the animals.\n\nThe tour guide shared that the careers at the zoo are endless. Lucy named jobs like maintenance, dieticians, researchers, biologists, store clerks, ticket masters, and construction engineers and artist. She stressed that if a person enjoys being around animals that the lack of formal training or degrees should not hinder you from a career at a zoo. The job ranges start from entry level to executive positions.\n\nShe encouraged students to use The Atlanta Zoo Website to research the different careers and the job projections. This field trip was an adventure for All!\n\n​Students from Jenkins County High School High Tech program visited the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport.

Vocational Rehabilitation Director of Client Services, Jennifer Howell, joined HSHT in welcoming the students, school staff and vendors to the event. The morning’s guest speaker was Nichole Spencer, Vice President of student Affairs at Augusta Technical College. Ms. Spencer presented information on Augusta Technical College including the new programs and locations in the area.\n\n​\n\nAfter the presentation, students were able to meet with 40 post-secondary and employer vendors to discuss opportunities. They were able to obtain information regarding post-secondary education as well as jobs and careers in the local community. Students were encouraged to visit as many vendors as possible during the allocated time. Those that visited with 20 or more vendors were eligible for prizes during the drawing at the end of the day.\n\nFollowing meeting with vendors, students and all in attendance enjoyed lunch while networking and discussing future plans and opportunities. Many of the students, teachers, and vendors expressed their appreciation of the day and offered much praise for this year’s fair being so well organized and well attended. The Augusta HSHT Program is proud to offer this annual event to its students and hopes to continue doing so for many years to come.\n\n​Fourteen students who are participating in the High School High Tech Program from Banks County High School participated in a 3 day manufacturing institute on January 10th, 11th and 12th, 2023. Colonel Atkinson, instructor for the High School High Tech program, delivered the training in an interactive format and the students were very engaged. There was a hands-on simulation that the students participated in as teams. All of the students who attended this training (100%) received 3 manufacturing accepted certifications: OSHA 10, Lean Six Sigma White Belt and Hands-On CPR. These certifications will assist these students with obtaining employment in the manufacturing industry after their graduation from high school. Opportunities at manufacturing sites in their area were discussed with the students and the importance of adding these certifications to their resume was discussed. This manufacturing institute was made possibly by funding from United Way of NE Georgia. Mark Madison, Director of Community Impact of United Way of NE Georgia, attended the institute one day, met the students, and gave them some words of encouragement."
