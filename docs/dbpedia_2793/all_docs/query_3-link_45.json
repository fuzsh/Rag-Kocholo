        "text": "Here are the questions from the other thread…\n\nGiven that Chapman is outside of LA (but close to Irvine), we are wondering about the availability of quality internships for students?\n\nSo…I have a freshman and a senior in Dodge College, so my answers speak to that. My senior has had some amazing internships–which are vital to succeed in the competitive film industry–it’s about who you know and connections all the way. BUT you have to be willing (for the most part) to do the commute to the LA area. My daughter started off at a summer internship she got through her upper class mentor (shes a creative producing major) after her sophomore year. She worked at Mosaic Entertainment which is a production and management company that reps people like Will Farrell, Christina Hendricks and Judd Apatow. She has gotten bigger internships each semester moving up the ladder to Nina Jacobsen’s company Color Force (The Hunger Games & Crazy Rich Asians) and Ivan Reitman’s company Montecito Picture Company (she was there while they were in pre produciton for the new Ghostbusters movie coming out next year). This semester she was at Amazon in their comedy development department and she was just hired at Sony Drama television for the Spring semester. All her internships after Mosaic were paid. So…yeah, high quality stuff. The internships in Orange county proper are plentiful, but for the film industry, not as career building. One a lot of kids do is working at Children’s Hospital of Orange County which is terrific, but wasn’t a good fit for my daughter.\n\nDo you know anything about the Honors program? Pros and Cons?\n\nI have no direct experience as my kids are not involved–it is very liberal arts/socratic method and the courses sound super interesting, but my kids are more hand-on practical people. My daughter’s sophomore roommate was in it and she loved it. You can look at the courses they offer on the public class search here–\n\nhttps://cs92prod.chapman.edu/psc/CS92PROD/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/COMMUNITY_ACCESS.CLASS_SEARCH.GBL\n\nJust choose Spring 2020 search for Honors in the subject line.\n\nSchool size: Do kids feel like it’s too small over time or do they feel like they have plenty of academic and social options?\n\nMy kids come from a high school of 200 so we aren’t probably the best to answer, but they are perfectly content.\n\nDo your kids find the school academically challeging?\n\nAgain, my kids are practical kids–they like project based hands on learning which is what Dodge Film school gives them…and it requires a LOT of the kids, they work a lot of hours for their class projects and working on film sets of their own or for upper class students on the weekends. So for them it’s very challenging in the field they want to be challenged in…but that isn’t the same as academically challenging I don’t believe. That isn’t something my kids sought out. They wanted to learn boots on the ground style–they now know how to hang lights, build a C Stand and all these other film set things I know nothing about…but it’s almost like a trade school that way. They didn’t want academically challenging. they wanted a BFA in an art that was practical. So I don’t know about other fields and opportunities.\n\nHow is the Greek system? My daughter may be interested in a sorority (I wasn’t in one myself, and candidly, am battling with some negative stereotypes which I’m told are oudated);\n\nI was right where you are and, whether it is this way at other schools, I can agree with the idea that it is outdated at least at Chapman. My daughter did rush and joined a sorority and does more work for philanthrophy than she parties. She had a mentor in her major from her sorority and that is how she got her first internship. She has a good network of graduates from her sorority that she is leveraging into jobs for after graduation as well. The greek life has no houses, so that limits both the competition (they are all one big family really) and the parties.\n\nLastly, not being from CA, what kind of reputation does the school have? I’m a little concerned that Chapman ranks considerably below other “peer” schools like Loyola Marymount and Santa Clara (in USNews rankings). I’m wondering if the local reputation (i.e., with prospective employers) is one of turning out academically strong students ready for the work force.\n\nAgain–my kids are in the film school, and there the reputation Chapman has is second to none (well maybe USC–but only if you are top of the class at USC because not everyone gets the opportunities at USC, only the top students do). LMU students are not as competitive in the film industry–my daughter has worked with interns from there who are struggling to catch up. That said, the reputation Chapman has in CA is that it is the “safety school” for the people applying to Ivies and a local school for good but not great students from Orange County with a lot of money.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nI answered @cuppasbux in an email but will reply here too for others–\n\nYou hit the nail on the head about the hands on practical pre professional focus–with a liberal arts foundation yes, but even more so a global focus…they have GE courses that are focused on service and global understanding…more than even the classic liberal arts. Check it out here–\n\nhttps://www.chapman.edu/academics/undergraduate-education/general-education/chapman-ge-program-how-it-works.aspx\n\nJournalism in general is in a HUGE state of change and flux with print media dying (I bought two subscriptions to magazines for my son and husband for Christmas only to have the magazines literally cancelled–these are decades old magazines and they ceased production on them!) and video/digital media changing forms daily. Dodge is really focused on staying on top of that and has working professionals as adjunct faculty and guest lecturers all the time…they really try to stay current in an ever changing landscape. LMU is a good school…but they are not cutting edge, honestly. If you are studying a subject that is well established in depth and breadth it might be a better fit, honestly, but if you are studying one that is trending and changing–the old “established” schools are not always on top of that. Make sure you visit and take the pulse for that. and check out all the Dodge college minors here – https://www.chapman.edu/dodge/programs/undergraduate/minors.aspx\n\nChapman does say their rep is on the rise–and their yield is evidence of that. They’ve actually had some trouble in the last few years about more people accepting their offer and having a larger freshman class than anticipated. They have also flipped just this year to where more of the students who enroll had Chapman as their first choice school than not (ie it wasn’t a safety or a backup for the majority of kids).\n\nWell my answers will speak specifically to the film school (which based on the schools you list sounds like you might be looking at too). But I will say that with that in mind it is important to look at choosing a film school as choosing a mate–there is no best mate only the best one for you–and I feel like with art schools that is even more the case than with other majors. So here was my kids’ take…\n\nNeither would even apply to USC despite it’s status. They had heard too many people talk about how it is a pressure cooker that fosters competition instead of collaboration, which is not their cup of tea. Not all kids get to make a thesis, they don’t own their films–USC does–and those things were also deal breakers. This letter to the editor that was just posted a couple of weeks ago addresses just that–\n\nhttp://dailytrojan.com/2019/12/04/letter-to-the-editor-the-cost-of-scas-culture-of-competition/?fbclid=IwAR1eUiLdRn5hyyq7ZeSimfZwOvapXE3PfTGSDKqJvH4KWPYjJX3BnqdjQ-A\n\nUCLA was also off the table for both of them. They basically have a two year film program–you do liberal arts the first two years and pick up a camera junior year. That was not the model they wanted. They wanted more of a trade school type of experience.\n\nThey both applied to LMU and it was a close second for one of mine and a more distant third or fourth for my other. It is also a more hands on BFA intensive program. But Chapman won out for a few reasons in both their minds–the facilities were newer, the courses better at staying on top of cutting edge industry trends and more working professionals on the faculty and as guests. One of mine also didn’t like the required religion courses at LMU. That one was only too happy to pull his application when he got into Chapman ED.\n\nNYU and Emerson were his other favorites–same reasons–hands on industry training and courses focused on what he wanted, but not in the middle of the industry (LA) with the current working professionals. Though they each had some interesting specific courses/majors that appealed to him within the film department–Emerson in Comedy and NYU had a new cross discipline one he liked. But he never even finished his applications once he got into Chapman ED.\n\nFor me I liked that it was in California still (we are here though several hours drive) and better with both merit and need aid (for us middle class families who rarely get consideration) than most of the others.\n\nHello,\n\nI see this was posted some time ago, hope you don’t mind me asking a couple more questions - your insider feedback is just what we’ve been looking for!\n\nMy son is choosing between PR&Advertising at Dodge and Communication at Santa Clara. He is more of a creative type, wanting to be in creative advertising rather than analytical or organizational communication role, and he loved the feel of Chapman when visiting. However, from what we’ve read, Santa Clara seems to have such a significant upper hand in terms of alumni connections, internships options, salaries, reputation, and the ranking which although not a deal-breaker is much higher and thought-provoking. He is very conflicted, and I am not sure how to advise him. As he is a transfer, it is more about which college will set him up better career-wise after graduation. The social aspect matters as well, but think both should work in this case.\n\nSo I have two questions really. Firstly, from your experience, is the PR&Ad major as highly respected with well-connected faculty as the rest of the Dodge School programs, or is it an ‘obscure poor relative’? Do the students from this major get the same exposure and opportunities for internships, collaboration on creative projects, career placements?\n\nSecondly, from your school search, do you have any insights about Santa Clara that could help our decision-making? They have been rated in the top 1% for employment and salary prospects for communication majors, but I suspect this may be about Bay Area location factor.\n\nAppreciate anything you’d be willing to share, would help us a lot.\n\nAnd Happy New Year!"
