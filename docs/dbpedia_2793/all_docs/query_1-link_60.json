        "text": "Description\n\nThe Purcell Building, built in 1969, rests on the border of North Georgia Technical College s beautiful main quad in the center of campus among prime real estate for student instruction, learning and gathering. Known for previously housing Machine Tool/CNC for decades, Purcell currently houses the Electrical Systems Technology program and is now needed for program expansion and a future Plumbing and Construction Maintenance and Management program. To accommodate the new program, NGTC intends to renovate Purcell Hall. A redesigned 16,941 sq. ft. floor plan will give additional floor space for labs as well as classrooms, office space, storage space, and ADA compliant restrooms. The exterior will be modified to blend with the current campus facilities and present an aesthetic entrance at both the interior quad entrance and the popular back parking lot entrance adjacent to the main road encircling the campus. Currently, Electrical Systems is at full capacity in an inadequate classroom and lab location, and the program has had an enrollment growth of 48% from 27 students in fall 2016 to 41 students in fall 2021. The proposed Plumbing and Construction Maintenance and Management program is predicted to begin with an enrollment of 25 to 40 students during the first year. Both of these programs are current high demand career fields in the college s eight county service area. The Project construction cost is estimated to be in the range of $2,600,000. The design professional is finalizing construction documents for the Project, which should be complete and available for distribution to eligible firms in January 2024. It is anticipated that construction will begin by April of 2024. The duration to reach material completion of the project is estimated as 305 days from the date specified in the proceed order.
