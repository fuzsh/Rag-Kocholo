        "text": "Dublin mayor responds to Flexsteel closure announcement\n\n\"Our hearts go out to all those families impacted by the plant closure,\" Mayor Joshua Kight wrote in a statement.\n\nDUBLIN, Georgia (41NBC/WMGT) – The Flexsteel plant in Dublin is set to close.\n\nDublin Mayor Joshua Kight issued a statement on Tuesday in response to the closure.\n\n“Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from Flexsteel’s corporate headquarters confirming that they are closing their Dublin plant,” he wrote.\n\nMayor Kight called the closure “on such short notice” “especially frustrating and disappointing.”\n\n“Our hearts go out to all those families impacted by the plant closure,” he wrote. “We’ll work with the Development Authority and Chamber of Commerce to help prepare those laid off for new job opportunities in our community. The prospect for good new jobs is positive because of Dublin’s overall economic growth and low unemployment.”\n\nAccording to Flexsteel Industries’ earnings call transcript on Tuesday, February 6, the company’s goal is to close the plant by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\n“While this decision was very difficult, it enables us to reduce customer lead times and handling damage to improve the overall customer experience, while also decreasing inventory, simplifying logistics execution and improving profitability,” President Derek Schmidt said on the call. “Currently, the Dublin facility supports less than 5% of the company’s sales, and we expect to retain virtually all sales through this transition.”\n\nSchmidt added that once the closure is complete, the company expects annualized savings of at least $4 million.\n\nMayor Kight says City Manager Josh Powell is working with the Development Authority and Chamber of Commerce to aid “our recently unemployed” and to spread announcements of job opportunities in the community.\n\n“We encourage individuals to go to careers.dlcda.com/jobs for a current listing of available jobs in Dublin-Laurens County,” Development Authority President Ryan Waldrep said. “This website is updated daily with new opportunities with healthcare, manufacturing and distribution employers. We are also working with area providers, such as Oconee Fall Line Technical College and Job Training Unlimited, to assist those impacted by the closure, including a job fair. Details, as well as a date and time, will be announced soon.”\n\nRead the full statement from the mayor below:\n\n“Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from Flexsteel’s corporate headquarters confirming that they are closing their Dublin plant. Flexsteel has been an important part of our community for over forty years. Our local workers have helped lead the company to increasing profits and sales, so it’s especially frustrating and disappointing that the company’s board would close the plant on such short notice. Our hearts go out to all those families impacted by the plant closure. We’ll work with the Development Authority and Chamber of Commerce to help prepare those laid off for new job opportunities in our community. The prospect for good new jobs is positive because of Dublin’s overall economic growth and low unemployment.” As this news was announced, Josh Powell, City Manager, initiated contact with our local Development Authority and Chamber of Commerce in preparation to aid our recently unemployed and to spread announcements of job opportunities within the community. Ryan Waldrep, President of the Development Authority said, “We encourage individuals to go to careers.dlcda.com/jobs for a current listing of available jobs in Dublin-Laurens County. This website is update daily with new opportunities with healthcare, manufacturing and distribution employers.” Waldrep further stated, “We are also working with area providers, such as Oconee Fall Line Technical College and Job Training Unlimited, to assist those impacted by the closure, including a job fair. Details, as well as a date and time, will be announced soon.”"
