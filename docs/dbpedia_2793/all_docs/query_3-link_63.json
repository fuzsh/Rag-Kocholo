        "text": "Current, reliable data helps us inform decisions about improving outcomes for the children, families, and communities we serve. As part of the Georgia Family Connection statewide network, we have access to customized information and tools specific to our Collaborative’s and partners’ needs. Data brings into focus for us an accurate picture of our community by pointing out our strengths, our weaknesses, and trends we may not have noticed before.\n\nKIDS COUNT\n\nKIDS COUNT is a state and national effort to track the well-being of children. Funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, KIDS COUNT informs local, state, and national discussions concerning ways to secure a brighter future for all children.\n\nThe KIDS COUNT Data Book paints a picture of the conditions for children and families in Georgia and the rest of the nation. Policymakers, advocates, service providers, civic leaders, and funders use this information to inform their decisions about priorities, services, and resources for children and families.\n\nIndicators of Child Well-Being\n\nGeorgia tracks 51 Indicators of Child Well-Being in five result areas that support our vision for a Georgia where all children are healthy, primed for school, and succeed when they get there; that all families are stable, self-sufficient, and productive; and that every community is vibrant, robust, and thriving."
