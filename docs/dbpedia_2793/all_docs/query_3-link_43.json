        "text": "Charitable Contributions\n\nCostco Wholesale’s primary charitable efforts specifically focus on programs supporting children, education, and health and human services in the communities where we do business. Throughout the year we receive a large number of requests from nonprofit organizations striving to make a positive impact, and we are thankful to be able to provide support to a variety of organizations and causes. While we would like to respond favorably to all requests, understandably, the needs are far greater than our allocated resources and we are unable to accommodate them all.\n\nWarehouse Donations:\n\nWarehouse donations are handled at the warehouse level - please consult your local warehouse for up-to-date information regarding their donations contacts and review process.\n\nGrant Applications\n\nIf the request is under consideration, you may be contacted by staff for any additional information needed. Applications are reviewed within 4-6 weeks, and decisions are made based on several factors, including: type of program; identified community need not otherwise available; indication that evidenced based data will establish measurable results of intended outcomes; community collaboration; broad base of financial support; project budget and operating expenses.\n\nMission\n\nThe DanPaul Foundation will use its resources to help train teachers and parents in early childhood development, protect children from abuse and neglect, stimulate children's personal social responsibilities, and offer them opportunities for enrichment and growth.\n\nThe Foundation will also encourage children to be concerned and informed about the environment and the underprivileged, particularly with regard to clean air and water, and adequate housing and nutrition for all.\n\nBeliefs\n\nThe DanPaul Foundation believes that children should have ample opportunities for enrichment in their lives, and thus strives to provide many different ways to enrich and expand children's minds through direct programs and monetary support to organizations doing similar work.\n\nWe have provided or currently provide grants related to the following program areas:\n\nWorkshops, Conferences, + Seminars: We strive to offer educational workshops, conferences, and seminars for parents and teachers on topics related to early childhood development.\n\nStudent Scholarships: We aim to help students attending post-secondary education institutions by providing need-based and academic scholarships.\n\nScientific Endeavors: We desire to advance scientific endeavors which seek to improve the quality of life for everyone in the world.\n\nClean Air + Water: We hope to pass on knowledge and practical life skills to youth regarding their personal responsibility to the environment, teaching them about issues surrounding clean air and water.\n\nChild Advocacy: We believe in protecting children from abuse and neglect and particularly love to support programs that provide education and assistance to children as well as organizations advocating or caring for vulnerable children.\n\nHomelessness: We want to encourage young people to take a personal interest in seeing that adequate housing and proper nutrition, especially for the underprivileged and homeless, are available.\n\nPoverty + Neglect: We seek to help those in poverty as well as educate youth about their responsibility to consider the underprivileged and take care of those most in need of life's basic essentials like adequate housing and proper nutrition.\n\nRefugee Enrichment: We wish to help refugee youth by supporting programs that provide them enrichment and help them transition to life in a new country.\n\nThe DanPaul Foundation provides grants to 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit organizations as defined by the IRS. The Foundation is interested in providing funding to programs that directly serve the health, education, development, and welfare of the world's youth.\n\nGrants range from a few hundred dollars up to $15,000 per calendar year.\n\nThe Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation seeks to dramatically improve the lives of people and the world around us through innovative strategies, systems changing approaches, and disrupting technologies. Our goal is to find social entrepreneurs with dynamic ideas and nurture them at the early stages with maximum leverage and total commitment.\n\nProspects for our portfolio of social enterprises come from a vast field of compelling ideas and dedicated leaders. We concentrate our selection on the capabilities of the founder/leader, the scalability of the model, and the potential impact of the organization on the world.\n\nWe have an open application process and accept applications year round. Borrowed from our venture capital legacy we find exceptional entrepreneurs, provide them with 3 years of unrestricted capital (totaling $300,000) and provide rigorous on-going support by joining their board of directors for the 3 years and partnering with the leader to help them to build capacity in their organization and scale their impact.\n\nWhat We Fund\n\nDRK’s hope is to support outsized impact through entrepreneurs and enterprises that create a transformational paradigm shift to meaningfully address a pressing societal problem affecting people’s lives.\n\nDRK Funds:\n\nOrganizations addressing a critical social or environmental issue as the focus of their work.\n\nFounders who intend to expand their impact significantly over time.\n\nOrganizations operating in Africa, Europe, India, Latin America, and the United States.\n\nIndependent nonprofit and impact first, mission-driven for-profit entities, including US 501(c)3 and its non-US equivalents, C corporations, B corporations, and hybrid organizations.\n\nFiscally sponsored organizations in select cases where there is a plan to spin out (in our experience, independence creates stronger enabling conditions for growth).\n\nPost-pilot, pre-scale organizations. This typically means:\n\nYour program, product or service is already in the market or in the field.\n\nYou have early indication that your model is having its intended impact.\n\nYour organization is 3-5 years old (this is not a rule, but a guidepost).\n\nOrganizations with one or more founders who are full-time or intend to be.\n\nWe believe that full-time leadership from the organization’s founder(s) is critical to an early stage organization’s growth.\n\nWe recognize that going full-time requires resources that you may still be putting together, and if that is the case we are happy to start a conversation with you in the meantime.\n\nWe value diversity of people proximate to the problem at hand and a commitment to foster justice, equity, inclusion, and belonging practices.\n\nIssues\n\nIssues include:\n\nArts & Culture\n\nCivic Engagement\n\nEconomic Empowerment\n\nEducation\n\nEnergy & Environment\n\nEnvironment & Climate Change\n\nFood & Agriculture\n\nHealth\n\nSocial Justice\n\nSystemic Poverty\n\nDRK Prioritizes:\n\nEvidence of focused alignment, systemic social change, data-based decision making.\n\nLeaders who are continually learning and iterating and welcome a deep working relationship with DRK for 3 years. Leaders who intimately understand the opportunity and the communities they serve. Leaders committed to advancing justice, equity, diversity, inclusion and belonging for all.\n\nOrganizations who are designed to realize their impact at scale.\n\nNOTE: Here are the other priority pages for this funder: Education page, Health page, and Social Service page.\n\nMission\n\nThe mission of the Hearst Foundations is to identify and fund outstanding nonprofits to ensure that people of all backgrounds in the United States can build healthy, productive and satisfying lives. Through its grantmaking, the Hearst Foundations support well-established nonprofit organizations that address significant issues within their major areas of focus—culture, education, health and social service—and that primarily serve large demographic and/or geographic constituencies. In each area of funding, the Foundations seek to identify those organizations achieving truly differentiated results relative to other organizations making similar efforts for similar populations. The Foundations also look for evidence of sustainability beyond their support.\n\nWhether providing a scholarship to a deserving student, supporting a rural health clinic or bringing artists into schools so children can see firsthand the beauty of the arts, the Foundations’ focus is consistent: to help those in need, those underserved and those underrepresented in society. Since the Foundations were formed in the 1940s, the scale and capabilities of the grant making have changed, but the mission has not.\n\nCulture Grant\n\nThe Hearst Foundations fund cultural institutions that offer meaningful programs in the arts and sciences, prioritizing those that enable engagement by young people and create a lasting and measurable impact. The Foundations also fund select programs nurturing and developing artistic talent. Supported organizations include arts schools, ballets, museums, operas, performing arts centers, symphonies and theaters.\n\nFunding Priorities in Culture\n\nIn the recent past, 25% of total funding has been allocated to Culture. Organizations with budgets over $10 million have received 60% of the funding in Culture.\n\nThe Hearst Foundations are only able to fund approximately 25% of all grant requests, of which about 80% is directed to prior grantees and about 20% is targeted toward new grantees.\n\nTypes of Support\n\nProgram, capital and, on a limited basis, general and endowment support\n\nOur Mission\n\nThe Hansen Family Foundation provides opportunities to domestic, international, secular, and non-secular organizations that support the American way of life, which is defined by the principles of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”\n\nCauses\n\nChildren\n\nThe Hansen Family Foundation supports causes dedicated to helping children both home as well as abroad.

Schumann Foundation was established by Mr. Schumann out of his beliefs that the environment is essential to sustain the future of the planet, that education is essential to solve many quality of life issues for society, and that arts and cultural programs offer society hope and the ability to dream. Mr. Schumann was an avid environmentalist and fought for open spaces where birds and other animals could maintain habitats and where people could enjoy nature. He supported efforts to improve the planet through environmental education, as well as artistic and cultural institutions that sought to raise the quality of life for local communities. Robert F. Schumann developed a love of birds early in his life. From a young age, he continued to learn and understand the importance of protecting the environment from over-development and pollution. He purchased acreage in upstate New York where he created a bird sanctuary known as Nuthatch Hollow. There he began a partnership with the local university allowing students, faculty and staff to use the land for environmental studies. Mr. Schumann served on the board of many environmental and educational institutions seeking to encourage the interests of students of all ages to understand and appreciate the importance of protecting and enjoying the environment. Robert F. Schumann died on December 8, 2011. His legacy of support for the environment, education, arts and culture will continue through the work of his foundation for many years to come.\n\nMission\n\nThe Robert F. Schumann Foundation is dedicated to improving the quality of life of both humans and animals by supporting environmental, educational, arts and cultural organizations and agencies.\n\nThere are no program limitations; however, the foundation is interested in primarily supporting environmental sustainability, education, the arts and humanities.\n\nProgram areas\n\nArts, culture, and humanities\n\nEducation\n\nEnvironment, animals\n\nNOTE:\n\nApplication forms must be requested each year online prior to submitting an application. When you submit an LOI, a member of the foundation staff will be contacting you within the next five business days regarding the status of your request.\n\nFull applications are due at the \"full proposal\" deadline above.\n\nThe Dr. Scholl Foundation grant application cycle is between October 1 and March 1 of the following year. The next grant cycle begins October 1st, 2024\n\nThe Foundation is dedicated to providing financial assistance to organizations committed to improving our world. Solutions to the problems of today's world still lie in the values of innovation, practicality, hard work, and compassion.\n\nThe Foundation considers applications for grants in the following areas:\n\nEducation\n\nSocial Service\n\nHealth care\n\nCivic and cultural\n\nEnvironmental\n\nThe categories above are not intended to limit the interest of the Foundation from considering other worthwhile projects. In general, the Foundation guidelines are broad to give us flexibility in providing grants.\n\nThe majority of our grants are made in the U.S. However, like Dr. Scholl, we recognize the need for a global outlook. Non-U.S. grants are given to organizations where directors have knowledge of the grantee.\n\nAbout\n\nWelcome to the Clif Family Foundation, an organization we started in 2006 to support grassroots groups led by people with vision and commitment. We believe that much of our nation's needed innovation will spring from grassroots organizations' daily efforts in local communities. The foundation has been proud to support hundreds of nonprofits that are working tirelessly to transform our food system, revitalize the environment, and enhance community health. Now that we’re grandparents, the urgency to build a healthy, just, and ecologically thriving world is even more personal. We look forward to expanding the reach and impact of the foundation in the years to come. This means working with nonprofits that prioritize people-centered solutions and address urgent gaps and historically underfunded priorities. We believe we can all do more good in the world. Together.\n\nStrategic Priorities\n\nRegenerative and Organic Farming: Accelerate the adoption of regenerative farming practices, including organic, climate-resilient, equitable, and agroecological approaches.\n\nFood Production Workers’ Health and Safety: Amplify efforts to secure healthy, safe, just, and empowering working and living conditions for food production workers.\n\nClimate Justice: Expand community-centered solutions to climate change that build resilience and empower those who have been historically marginalized.\n\nHealthy Food Access: Advance food systems’ changes that make healthy and sustainably produced food accessible, affordable, and culturally appropriate.\n\nInclusive Outdoor Access: Catalyze solutions that expand access to safe places to enable healthy physical activity and improve mental health.\n\nIndoors and Outdoors Safe from Pollution: Promote preventative health approaches by identifying and eliminating toxics from our air, water, soil, and human-made materials.\n\nOpen Call\n\nThese grants support general operating cost or specific projects and applicants must be registered as (or fiscally sponsored by) a 501(c)3 organization. The Foundation reviews applications twice a year; the deadlines are March 1 and August 1. Grant announcements occur approximately four months after the deadline. Typical grants range from $5,000 - $50,000 and last for one year.\n\nEide Bailly Resourcefullness Award\n\nOur nonprofit industry advisory group is thrilled to offer this opportunity for nonprofit organizations who develop outstanding initiatives to support their communities. Our Resourcefullness Award program was established in 2013 and each year we receive an abundance of wonderful applications. It’s hard choosing a winner!\n\nUltimately, we are passionate about helping our clients (and non-clients) thrive and succeed. This award program allows us to showcase nonprofit organizations that stand out and in turn, we are able to offer education around revenue generating trends, ideas and campaign strategies.\n\nEide Bailly’s Resourcefullness Award is our way to support the financial health of the nonprofit sector while recognizing and celebrating nonprofits across the nation for their creative and sustainable revenue-generating initiatives. Through a short application process, three judges from outside of the firm will select one 501(c)(3) organization as the Award winner, receiving a $50,000 prize.\n\nCriteria for Evaluation\n\nOur Resourcefullness Award judges will reference the following criteria when evaluating application submissions:\n\nSustainability\n\nCreativity\n\nFinancial Impact\n\nOverall Impression\n\nImplementation\n\nCharitable Contributions\n\nCostco Wholesale’s primary charitable efforts specifically focus on programs supporting children, education, and health and human services in the communities where we do business.

We believe that much of our nation's needed innovation will spring from grassroots organizations' daily efforts in local communities. The foundation has been proud to support hundreds of nonprofits that are working tirelessly to transform our food system, revitalize the environment, and enhance community health. Now that we’re grandparents, the urgency to build a healthy, just, and ecologically thriving world is even more personal. We look forward to expanding the reach and impact of the foundation in the years to come. This means working with nonprofits that prioritize people-centered solutions and address urgent gaps and historically underfunded priorities. We believe we can all do more good in the world. Together.\n\nStrategic Priorities\n\nRegenerative and Organic Farming: Accelerate the adoption of regenerative farming practices, including organic, climate-resilient, equitable, and agroecological approaches.\n\nFood Production Workers’ Health and Safety: Amplify efforts to secure healthy, safe, just, and empowering working and living conditions for food production workers.\n\nClimate Justice: Expand community-centered solutions to climate change that build resilience and empower those who have been historically marginalized.\n\nHealthy Food Access: Advance food systems’ changes that make healthy and sustainably produced food accessible, affordable, and culturally appropriate.\n\nInclusive Outdoor Access: Catalyze solutions that expand access to safe places to enable healthy physical activity and improve mental health.\n\nIndoors and Outdoors Safe from Pollution: Promote preventative health approaches by identifying and eliminating toxics from our air, water, soil, and human-made materials.\n\nOpen Call\n\nThese grants support general operating cost or specific projects and applicants must be registered as (or fiscally sponsored by) a 501(c)3 organization.
