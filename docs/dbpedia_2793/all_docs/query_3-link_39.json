        "text": "Year of total integration\n\n1970.\n\nPeabody became a junior high in the first year of total desegregation. Dodge County had been put on notice by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1969, which had threatened loss of funds.\n\nShortly before school opened for 1970-71 an unnamed \"special reporter\" in Eastman's Times-Journal asked for cooperation on Aug. 26. \"Opinions regarding the change are varied,\" said the special reporter. \"We are fortunate, however, in that many people are willing to accept it as inevitable, but a few could disrupt the school system by not cooperating.\"\n\nLike other systems, it leaned on the sense of community in urging peace. The same article advised: \"Please be assured that the same teachers and administrators who have taken care of your children in the past are still here. Some fear the quality of the educational program will be impaired. Since the staff will not change to any real extent, this fear seemed unwarranted if parents send their children to school to learn.\"\n\nCopeland Elementary seems to have been abandoned a year or so prior to 1970."
