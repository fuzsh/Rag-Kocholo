        "text": "ESSER I funding was allocated on March 27, 2020 and represented the first round of federal school aid meant to help officials navigate emerging health and safety protocols, reopen schools, and acquire technology and personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary to keep students learning.\n\nESSER II funding was allocated on December 27, 2020 and was aimed at helping schools and districts after prolonged and unexpected closures, while empowering school systems with the resources to begin addressing widespread learning loss, increased student and teacher mental health concerns, and climbing absenteeism.\n\nESSER III funding was allocated on March 21, 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan and represents the largest of the three rounds of federal school recovery funding. Ninety percent (90%) of the funds were distributed directly to schools and districts, with 10% reserved for state education agencies. Federal guidance urged districts to dedicate at least 20% of their funding to address learning loss."
