It serves the communities of Chauncey, Chester, Eastman, Milan, and Rhine.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 1977, Dahl McDermitt was second place in a special election to be the superintendent, with 2,069 votes, while E. M. \"Pete\" McDuffie, previously a member of the Georgia Senate, got 2,176 votes. Another candidate got 1,552 votes. McDuffie dropped out of the race, and in a runoff election in January 1978, McDermitt won, taking 3,209 votes while his opponent, the third place holder from the 1977 special election, had 2,834 votes. More than half of the eligible voters had voted in the runoff.[4]\n\nSchools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Dodge County School District has a pre-K center, two elementary schools, one middle school, one high school, and an alternative school with a credit recovery academy.[5]\n\nElementary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge Pre-K\n\nDodge County Primary School\n\nDodge County Elementary School\n\nMiddle school\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge County Middle School\n\nHigh school\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge County High School\n\nDodge County Achievement Center (Alternative school, serves all grades)\n\nDodge Performance Learning Center\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
