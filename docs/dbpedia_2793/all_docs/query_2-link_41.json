I know he takes pride in the office of coroner and I’ve seen first hand, working on different cases in the past, the compassion he has for people and the office he holds. I’ve been blessed over the years to work in a field most people can’t imagine. I take pride in helping the living that are hurting and grieving, but I care just as much for the voice that has been silenced. I am passionate about finding justice for those that can no longer speak for themselves and helping those grieving to find comfort and closure. If I can help comfort one person dealing with overwhelming grief or find answers for those that are now silent, it’s worth all the work. I always want to be what God would have for me to be doing for someone else and that is what this job is about, helping the grieving and being a voice for those that can no longer speak for themselves. Thank you Joe Smith for having faith in me to work in a position that is truly a calling to help others”.\n\nGilmore joins current deputy coroner of eight years, Jay Coleman.

During the search, numerous items connected to the recent vehicle break-ins were recovered. The search resulted in the arrest of Treyvon Bradley, age 20; Leslie Bradley, age 40; Paul Henley, age 44 and Ivelitza Colon, age 27, all from Eastman, for crimes including entering autos and theft by receiving stolen property. Numerous items were recovered including firearms, electronics and other items.\n\nInvestigators are currently inventorying the suspected stolen items and attempting to identify all potential victims. If you were a theft victim, please ensure you have a report on file regarding the theft with either the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office or Eastman Police Department. Please contact investigator Roy Conley or investigator Glenn Conley at the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office at 478-559-1130 or investigator Gary Widener with the Eastman Police Department at 478-374-7788, if you have any questions or concerns regarding stolen property.\n\nDodge County Sheriff Lynn Sheffield and Eastman Police Chief Becky Sheffield would like to thank the public for their help during this investigation. Both departments invested numerous hours following leads, processing scenes and conducting surveillance, which culminated in these arrests.\n\nBoth the sheriff and chief believe that best outcomes are achieved when the public and law enforcement work together to ensure a safer community for us all.\n\n↧\n\nCommissioners approve Georgia Military College agreement\n\nBy Taelor Rye\n\nCharles Williams, of the development authority, approached the Dodge County Board of Commissioners, stating that the deal with Georgia Military College (GMC) to occupy the building previously used by Mercer University’s Academic Resource Center was “down to [the county] tonight.”\n\nWilliams presented the intergovernmental agreement among the Dodge County Murrell Memorial Public Library, the Dodge County Development Authority, the City of Eastman and the County of Dodge. An update to the agreement allows the library to receive funds such as grants that would require a matched donation from the city or county. A previous draft of the agreement prevented the library for asking for other funds, but the revision allows the library to request a matched amount of money from the city or county or money to replace lost state funds or funds from other sources. The first three of the four involved parties had already approved the changes, and the newly altered agreement was pending county approval; the board approved the agreement.\n\nThe hope for the GMC property is that the board of commissioners and city council at the end of the ten-year lease will elect to donate the property back to the library after receiving the total of their investment back so that the library may continue to use the property as a source of income for upkeep.\n\nBecause the upcoming Eastman campus will be GMC’s 13th campus in Georgia, the grand opening of the school will take place on Friday, May 13, Williams stated.\n\nSharon Cobb Flanagan of the Dodge County Farmer’s Market Development Authority visited the board to update its members.\n\nFlanagan relayed that the authority held its first meeting last week, stating, “It went very well.” The authority also held training for vendors on Monday, March 21, and the list of vendors keeps growing.\n\nContinue reading \"Commissioners approve Georgia Military College agreement\"\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSheriff’s department launches new sex offender/notification website\n\nRecently, Dodge County Sheriff Lynn Sheffield and the Dodge County Sheriff’s Department launched a new sex offender registration and public notification website called OffenderWatch®. Dodge County will now be part of a nationwide network of over 5,000 law enforcement. The new service is a citizen-friendly, easy to use website that enables citizens to search for potentially dangerous sex offenders and predators, which may be in close proximity to their homes, places of work, schools, churches and day care centers. The information is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and is updated in real time by the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office as offender information changes and is reported. As part of this new, innovative service, citizens may enter any address of interest to them, and see a map and listing of all offenders within a user defined radius (of .25 miles out to two miles) of that address. Citizens can then register the address to be continuously monitored by the Sheriff, who will send to them an email alerting them if an offender or predator should register an address within their specified radius of their address. Citizens may confidentially register as many addresses as they like, at no cost to them.\n\nContinue reading \"Sheriff’s department launches new sex offender/notification website\"\n\n↧\n\nDodge summer school dates are set\n\nBy Taelor Rye\n\nDuring the summer of 2016, Dodge County Middle School (DCMS) and Dodge County High School (DCHS) will hold summer school. Both schools will hold a session that begins on June 13 and ends on July 1. DCHS will hold a second session that begins on July 5 and ends on July 28. Although the first session will hold classes Monday through Friday, the second session will only be from Monday to Thursday.\n\nFor DCMS’s session, in-county students will be required to pay $150.00 while out-of-county students will be charged $300.00. Students making up attendance will be charged $10.00 each day.\n\nDCHS’s sessions will charge the same price - $150.00 and $300.00, depending on student address. However, each session only counts as half of a unit for the course – an equivalent to one semester.\n\nDCHS also offers an instructional extension during the regularly scheduled sessions for students whose average in a given class lies between 65 and 69, inclusive. The cost for this program is $5.00 per hour spent.\n\nThe board of education approved the motion to utilize a network specialist to help with technology two days out of every month. Rick Rogers’s letter of request to Dodge County School Superintendent Dr. Melinda Dennis states that the cost is $750.00 per day for a total of $1,500.00 each month.\n\nRogers details that the Dodge County School System has 3,100 devices connected to its network with over 482 users and over 3,000 students. Therefore, the need for another technology specialist is evident.\n\nThe board also approved the motion to remain as a fiscal agent for Family Connection for 2017 as well as to continue providing the Seamless Summer nutrition program.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the intent of this program is to continue “the same meal service rules and claiming procedures used during the regular school year… [through] a streamlined approach to feeding hungry children” in the community.\n\nThe program will be operated from within the Dodge County High School (DCHS) cafeteria, according to Dena Barrows, the school nutrition program director, and will take place “Monday through Friday, June 13, 2016 through July 22, 2016 with the exception of July 4 – July 8.”\n\nThe board approved Middle Georgia State University’s (MGSU) request for a school bus for the Second Annual Heart of Georgia Air Show at the Eastman campus of MGSU on Saturday, November 5, 2016. The gates will be open from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., with the actual show beginning at 12:00 p.m.\n\nContinue reading \"Dodge summer school dates are set\"\n\n↧\n\nSpring is here\n\nEven with the cooler weather on some days, Spring has arrived in Eastman and Dodge County as flowers begin to bloom.

Flanagan stated that more will be available in the future, according to commitments from other vendors.\n\nOther availabilities include eggs, hanging baskets from the Dodge County High School Future Farmers of America and fresh meats.\n\nAfter making these reminders, Flanagan formally requested sponsorship from the city at the amount of $1,000.00.\n\nCity council member Milton Johnson moved instead for a sponsorship of $1,500.00 “to the Dodge County Farmer’s Market Development Authority to assist in establishing a farmer’s market at a county-owned facility, with the council finding that such expenditure is in the interest and of a particular benefit to the City of Eastman and its development.”\n\nIn keeping with development of the city, Flanagan noted that the official logo for the farmer’s market states, “Dodge County Farmer’s Market Downtown,” as Flanagan and her crew foresee increased foot traffic in the downtown area.\n\nDowntown development was also addressed at the meeting in terms of city budgeting, as the line item allotting funds for downtown beautification was slightly altered to read “downtown development,” opening up different avenues for the city and the downtown development authority different access to funds for other programs in the area.\n\nHenry Whitfield of Middle Georgia State University (MGSU) requested from the council sponsorship for its upcoming air show.\n\nThe Second Annual Heart of Georgia Air Show will take place at the Eastman campus of MGSU on Saturday, November 5, 2016. The gates will be open from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., with the actual show beginning at 12:00 p.m.\n\nThe air show celebrates the 20th anniversary of the MGSU School of Aviation as well as the 50th anniversary of the airport.\n\nDue to this milestone, city council member Buddy Pittman moved to fund the air show at an amount of $5,000.00, noting that – although this number is high – the city has “put out a lot for other programs and schools.”\n\nCharles Williams, director of the chamber of commerce, commented, “This airport is the future of this community,” commending the council on its decision.\n\nThe council approved a resolution recognizing the week of Sunday, April 17, to Saturday, April 23, as Georgia Cities Week, with planned programs during the week.\n\nOn Monday, April 18, there will be no city council meeting, as regularly scheduled. Instead, the city will hold a State of the City address at the Magnolia Theater downtown.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 19, the council will hold a business after-hours session to be hold at a downtown location to be determined.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 20, the city will hold a question-and-answer style work session at Dodge County High School to address young citizens’ interests regarding city government.\n\nContinue reading \"Farmer’s market to open this Saturday\"\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDodge County Probate Court disposes of cases\n\nDodge County Probate Judge Al McCranie heard and ruled on the following cases on March 22, 2015.\n\nCharles J.

Frederick Mullis, Jr., visited the Dodge County Board of Commissioners at its April 4 meeting to provide contextual information regarding the use of the Drug Abuse Treatment and Education (DATE) fund for the impending area drug court.\n\nThe DATE Fund, or the drug fund, was discussed at the board’s last meeting, and Mullis sought to clarify the fund’s intention.\n\nMullis stated that the Oconee Judicial Circuit is “on the verge of establishing a drug court,” one of the last circuits in the state to do so; he added that rural circuits have generally been more reluctant.\n\nMullis also said that the local money required to support such a court has been here all along and is not taxpayer money but rather money from the DATE fund, set aside by the governor for local input.\n\nMullis provided board members with information regarding a skeleton budget for the upcoming drug court – “a type of alternative treatment rather than sending someone who’s accused of a drug crime to court. The governor’s interest is to keep people out of prison. Prison’s no place to rehab drug offenders. I know that; everyone knows that.”\n\nThe proposal of this budget contracts with the Community Service Board of Middle Georgia (formerly the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia) in Dublin, who will “provide the testing, the counseling… We want to use a combination of mental health and drug court for drug offenses and those offenses that involve mental health. There’s a good bit of crossover there,” he added.\n\nThe local share required of the county is approximately 10 percent, with the rest funded strictly by grant money. Anticipated costs range between $175,000.00 and $190,000.00. The local share is designated under Georgia Code § 15-21-101, which states, “Moneys collected pursuant to this article and placed in the “County Drug Abuse Treatment and Education Fund” shall be expended by the governing authority of the county for which the fund is established solely and exclusively for drug abuse treatment and education programs relating to controlled substances and marijuana.”\n\nA resolution similar to the one that Mullis presented the board with was also presented to Telfair County, where – Mullis stated – a previous sheriff used drug fund money to “pay for the sheriff’s toys. That was clearly not what was anticipated for the drug fund.” Upon adoption, Telfair’s DATE fund is well into six figures, Mullis relayed.\n\nThe resolution allows the court to have an equal say-so on how the DATE funds are therefore spent. Specifically, the text of the resolution states “that any person or entity who desires that the Dodge County Board of Commissioners expend monies from the Drug Fund must obtain an Order from the Chief Judge of the Dodge Superior Court directing the board of commissioners to make such disbursements.”\n\nCounty attorney John Harrington added that it is better for the county to pay any required fees from the drug fund rather than from general funds, which come from taxpayers rather than “moneys arising from fines and forfeited bonds,” as Georgia Code states.\n\nThe board voted unanimously to approve the resolution.\n\nSharon Cobb Flanagan of the Dodge County Farmer’s Market Development Authority revisited the board to restate the farmer’s market’s purpose, which she stated to be among the following items: to provide fun for family on a recurring basis, to provide local farmers a venue wherein to sell products that they grow, to allow craftsmen and cottage food suppliers to sell their products as well, and to provide regular entertainment, among other reasons. Every objective was proven successful at the inaugural farmer’s market on Saturday, April 2, Flanagan stated.\n\nThe measure of success is graded not only by word of mouth from those who attended and regulated the event but also by the fact that several vendors sold out early and left, Flanagan said. In fact, the Future Farmers of America had to make roughly six trips back to the greenhouse to restock plants that they were selling at the farmer’s market.\n\nAdditionally, Flanagan relayed that craft vendors typically stated that their sales were better at the farmer’s market than at many other venues and that the meat vendor reported sales to be better than expected.\n\nAll in all, over 500 people were estimated to have attended the opening day of the farmer’s market, even with the irregular rain patterns of the day.\n\nLastly, Flanagan formally requested county funding for the farmer’s market. The board moved to provide sponsorship at $1,000.00.\n\nContinue reading \"Oconee Judicial Circuit planning a drug court\"\n\n↧\n\nEastman man shot in leg\n\nOfficers were called to shots fired on Cooper Avenue on Sunday, April 3, 2016 at approximately 10:20 p.m. Upon arrival on Cooper Avenue, officers found evidence there had been shots fired.\n\nAt this time 911 notified the Eastman Police Department that a subject came into the Dodge County Hospital Emergency Room with a gunshot wound to the leg.\n\nAccording to the victim, Thomas Luke Taylor, age 20, of Eastman, he was on Cooper Avenue when he was stopped by a subject in the street.
