RUSSELL\n\nH1NTON\n\nSTATE AUDITOR\n\n(404) 656-2174\n\nDEPARTMENT OF AUDITS AND ACCOUNTS\n\n254 Washington Street. S. W, Suite 214 Atlanta, Georgia 30334-8400\n\nMarch 25, 2002\n\nHonorable Roy E. Barnes, Governor Members of the General Assembly Members of the State Board of Education\n\nand Superintendent and Members of the Dodge County Board of Education\n\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON SCHEDULE OF SALARIES AND TRAVEL\n\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n\nWe have audited the general-purpose financial statements ofthe Dodge County Board ofEducation, as ofand for the year ended June 30, 2001, and have issued our report tht?reon dated March 25, 2002, under separate cover. That report was qualified for various departures from generally accepted accounting principles, as identified in the auditor's report on the general-purpose financial statements. Those financial statements are the responsibility of the Board of Education's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these general-purpose financial statements based on our audit.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General ofthe United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free ofmaterial misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nAs described in the auditor's report on the general-purpose financial statements, the auditor's opinion on the Board ofEducation's financial statements was qualified for the Board ofEducation's failure to record as expenditures certain salaries earned by employees ofthe Board ofEducation as ofJune 30, 2001, but not paid until the subsequent fiscal year. Additionally, similar amounts earned as of June 30, 2000, are recorded as expenditures in the fiscal year2001 financial statements rather than in the prior year as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n2001ARL-50\n\nOur audit was performed for the purpose of forming an opinion on the general-purpose financial statements taken as a whole. The Schedule of Salaries and Travel included in this separately issued document is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the generalpurpose financial statements ofthe Dodge County Board ofEducation. The Schedule ofSalaries and Travel has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the general-purpose financial statements and in our opinion, except for the effects of the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph, such information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the general-purpose financial statements taken as a whole and should be read in conjunction with those statements.\n\nThis report is issued pursuant to the Official Code of Georgia Annotated 50-6-27 and is intended solely for the information and the use of management, members of the Dodge County Board of Education and members of the General Assembly of Georgia and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n':;)~---~W.~\n\n~~11 W.
