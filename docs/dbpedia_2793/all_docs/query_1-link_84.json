        "text": "A Good MFA Program is Hard to Find\n\nA good MFA program is hard to find, but we believe the MFA Program at Georgia College & State University in Milledgeville, Georgia offers unique opportunities for MFA students dedicated to the craft and purpose of creative writing. GCSU’s famous alumna, Flannery O’Connor, lived in Milledgeville on her farm, Andalusia, and of our beautiful, Southern town, she wrote \"When in Rome, do as you done in Milledgeville.\" Our MFA students certainly get a lot done in their three years in Milledgeville.\n\nWhat makes us unique? We take pride in the fact that the MFA Program at Georgia College is a fully-funded, full-residency 3-year MFA program. All students admitted to our MFA program receive a Graduate Assistantship for all 3 years that includes a stipend and tuition remission. Self-funded students are accepted in special circumstances. We offer everything you could find at flagship state universities, but because we are part of a small, public Liberal Arts university, our students are immediately welcomed into a close-knit, creative community. We sponsor a Visiting Writers series, bringing nationally-renowned writers to campus each semester, as well as a graduate student reading series. Our award-winning faculty work closely with students not only as workshop teachers, but as professional mentors.\n\nThe MFA Program offers workshops in fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry, and because we believe in expanding creative possibility and passions for our students, we require students to take cross-genre workshops. Students may write their thesis in fiction, poetry or creative nonfiction. In addition to workshops, students take creative writing seminars in Poetry & Poetics or Prose Forms, pedagogy classes on the teaching of writing, and courses on literature and special topics.\n\nAdditionally, we offer courses in journal design and editing, so students get hand-on publishing and graphic design experience. Students are able to put their practical skills to creative and purposeful good use while serving as members of the editorial staff of Arts & Letters, our national literary journal, and one of the premier journals of the Southeast.\n\nWe are fully-funded: all students receive full tuition remission as well as a Graduate Assistantship. As part of this assistantship, students gain real-world teaching experience, and work at our Writing Center as tutors, teach undergraduate Composition, and teach in our Early College Program which is modeled on the Writers in the Schools Program. This real world teaching experience is essential for those students who hope to continue with teaching careers and/or community service careers. We also participate in the Peace Corps Paul D. Coverdell Fellows Program which offers assistantships to Peace Corps volunteers.\n\nFinally, the Arts & Letters Journal Editing Fellowship is open to applicants with at least one year of experience in journal publishing and/or editing, desktop publishing and design (preferably with InDesign), and/or marketing and promotion (including social media). The Fellowship offers recipients the opportunity to further develop both editorial and managerial skills over their three years in the MFA program, working closely with Arts & Letters’ Editor and Art Director (for more information about this specific fellowship, refer information under Assistantships).\n\nFaculty and graduate students alike all practice what we preach and teach at GCSU!\n\nOur 42-hour program is designed to be a three-year program (although other options may be possible for those students that already have an MA Degree) and most students follow a plan that emphasizes course work in the first year and thesis work in the second and third years.\n\nWe welcome you to learn more about our admission application process and opportunities for graduate assistantships and other financial aid.\n\nCheck out the new design of the Arts & Letterswebsite!\n\nWe now have a dynamic platform that is more efficient and responsive, and we’ve packaged it in a prettier and more user-friendly design. We are also now connected across a number of social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Google+, so that our readers can keep up on Arts & Letters news, reading periods, information on upcoming issues, and prizes.\n\nVisiting Writer Series\n\nAfrican Writers Festival\n\nDEGREE REQUIREMENTS\n\nApplication Process\n\nProspective students for our Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program usually apply late fall/early winter for the following fall semester.

Additionally, before you can register for classes, the required immunization certificate (PDF) must be submitted to the Registrar's office.\n\nWe do NOT require GRE scores.\n\nThe MFA program web pages provide program-specific information; however, you will find other important information at graduate admissions, the university registrar, financial aid and other GC web sites/offices. International students should contact the International Student Center for admission guidance.\n\nEvaluation of Your Application\n\nYour writing portfolio is the primary credential we review in evaluating your application for admission (writing samples are reviewed by a faculty committee who teach in the student’s thesis genre). Your letters of recommendation and statement of purpose are also important, since they will address your skill and accomplishment as a writer. Because our students also take required classes in Poetry & Poetics or Prose Forms, Teaching Creative Writing and non-creative writing courses in literature, criticism, linguistics or other subjects, your transcripts will also help us make our final, holistic evaluation of your application.\n\nWe begin to review applications after Feb.1. In order to maintain small classes and individual, intensive mentorship of thesis work, our admission process is competitive. Our first step is to inform students (usually early to mid-March) whether or not they’ve been admitted to our program. Our second step is to determine MFA assistantship offers and wait lists (see The Graduate School for details about graduate assistantships).\n\nAny Questions?\n\nCall us at 478-445-3509, or send an email. For Graduate Admissions questions, call 478-445-6289.\n\nAssistantships/Financial Aid\n\nAll application materials must be completed and received by Feb.1 if you wish to be considered for an MFA program-sponsored graduate assistantship (or “G.A.”). Please include a résumé with the application materials you send to the MFA program. Provide any information that best describes your skills and experience, including (but not limited to, and not necessarily in this order):\n\nEducation (any specific or special studies, experiences, or projects?)\n\nTutoring, teaching, or mentoring skills, experience\n\nEditing/publishing experience (print journal, newspaper, web, etc.)\n\nCommunication skills (including social media/networking)\n\nTech skills (InDesign, web editing programs, Photoshop, other Adobe software; experience with Microsoft office or Apple iBooks Author?\n\nAny other skills/experiences you’d like to emphasize\n\nList 3 references (those submitting your letters of recommendation)\n\nApplications received by Feb.1, and selected for acceptance to the MFA program, will then be reviewed to determine applicants that will be offered MFA-sponsored assistantships. Faculty committees (in each genre) review these applications holistically, based on the quality of the writing sample, potential for graduate study in an academic setting, and depth of experience (as reflected by the applicant’s statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, transcripts and résumé). The committee then ranks the accepted applications. When rankings are complete, the MFA Coordinator contacts applicants to make assistantship offers or to discuss and clarify a candidate’s placement on an assistantship waiting list. Once offered an MFA G.A., the applicant is encouraged to make a decision as soon as possible, but a final decision will be due no later than April 15.\n\nAssistantships\n\nKinds of assistantships available to our graduate students:\n\nMost MFA-sponsored first year graduate assistants (or “G.A.s”) are assigned hours as “writing consultants” in the university Writing Center. Other MFA G.A.s divide their hours between the Writing Center and the MFA/Arts & Letters office, the Flannery O’Connor Review office, or our teaching writing in the schools Early College project. MFA-sponsored graduate assistantships include a stipend (current stipend is $8,600 per year) and full-tuition remission (but does not include mandatory student fees and, unless eligible to be waived, mandatory student insurance). The GCSU Budget Office posts current tuition and fees; information about student insurance is available at United Healthcare.\n\nTeaching Fellowships require a secondary application process, due to additional credentials required for teaching college-level classes. Students who have been awarded MFA-sponsored G.A.s are eligible to apply for a Teaching Fellowship if a) they already hold an M.A. in English, or b) they have completed 18 hours of graduate credit in English, in addition to meeting other criteria. MFA students who are eligible will apply to the Department of English and Rhetoric (submitting materials through Georgia College & State University careers or some other means, as determined by the Chair). Note: Students are expected to teach during their second and third years of the program; failure to earn enough course credit to teach classes or failure to meet other expected criteria for teaching may result in the forfeiture of the student’s assistantship.\n\nThe Arts & Letters Journal Editing Fellowship at Georgia College encourages graduate studies for students with at least one year of experience in journal publishing and/or editing, desktop publishing and design (preferably with InDesign), and/or marketing and promotion (including social media). Students interested in applying for this Fellowship should also have excellent organizational and proofreading skills.\n\nThe Fellowship offers recipients the opportunity to further develop both editorial and managerial skills over their three years in the MFA program, working closely with Arts & Letters’ Editor and Art Director. In the first year, the A&L Fellow works in the capacity of Assistant Managing Editor, helping the current Managing Editor in the completion of office duties—everything from social media postings to honing InDesign skills to updating the Web Site. In the second and third year, the Fellow takes over as Managing Editor. Managing Editor duties include distributing and monitoring reading (submission) loads, In Desgning the journal and readying it to send to the printer, managing Sendinblue campaigns, and running proofreading sessions. The Managing Editor also is encouraged to represent the journal at the annual AWP Conference, as funding allows. Qualified applicants who wish to pursue the Journal Editing Fellowship should initially contact Dr. Kerry Neville, who coordinates the MFA Program.\n\nThe Journal Editing Fellowship is awarded to an incoming student every other year, and includes a stipend for summer work, much of which can be done remotely. The Fellowship is typically awarded in the spring semester prior to the student’s first (fall) semester. The fellowship will be awarded to a qualified recipient in 2025.\n\nArts & Letters, a nationally known literary journal in continuous biannual print publication since 1999, publishes innovative fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction by emerging and established writers, and offers annual prizes in four genres, as well a prize for ‘unclassifiable’ work. Recent representative authors include Wes Civilz, Marianne Boruch, Keith Wilson, Rodney Jones, James Allen Hall, Lina Ferreira Cabeza-Vanegas, and George Singleton.\n\nIn addition, other university assistantships outside the MFA program may be an option for students accepted to our program (typically, these G.A.s offer a lower stipend but still include a full in-state or out-of-state tuition waiver). The MFA coordinator will discuss this option with applicants accepted to the program but who do not receive an MFA-sponsored G.A.\n\nScholarships and other Financial Aid\n\nSome MFA scholarships (subject to funding availability) are awarded, in addition to the stipend and tuition waiver, to students on MFA-sponsored assistantships. The program coordinator will discuss these awards (if available) with students offered MFA G.A.s. ALL enrolled and returning university students (in good academic standing) can apply for other scholarships (some related to the MFA in Creative Writing program, some not), such as the Flannery O’Connor Alumni Scholarship and the Dorrie Neligan Creative Writing Scholarships.\n\nStudent loans are also available to MFA students through the university Financial Aid Office. Whether or not you’re interested in applying for a student loan, accepted applicants may wish to complete the student loan FAFSA application. Discuss your options with GCSU’s Financial Aid Office.\n\nQuick Info For Assistantships:\n\nIn 2023-2024, all incoming MFA students had assistantships, and 6 had other university assistantships/appointments.\n\nMFA GAs include a stipend and full tuition waiver (in-state OR out-of-state tuition).\n\nApplicants offered MFA GAs are encouraged to make a decision early but final decisions are due by April 15.\n\nMFA GAs are assigned hours in the Writing Center (some GAs split hours with another assignment in our program).\n\nStudents awarded MFA GAs apply to be Teaching Fellows their second year (if eligible) through a separate process via the Department of English.\n\nMFA GAs usually earn 18 hours in ENGL graduate credit their first year (required for Teaching Fellow eligibility).\n\nTeaching Fellows are typically assigned CORE classes (ENGL 1101, 1102) and ENGL 2208: Intro to Creative Writing.\n\nStipends for assistantships are paid in five equal installments each semester (fall/spring).\n\nAssistantships do not cover required student fees or student insurance (may be eligible to waive).\n\nMFA students are eligible for a variety of scholarships, some related, some not related, to Creative Writing, as well as student loans.\n\nGraduate Assistantships in the Writing Center\n\nGraduate Consultant\n\nInterdisciplinary Writing Coordinator\n\nResources Coordinator\n\nPeace Corp Fellows\n\nThe Peace Corps Paul D. Coverdell Fellows Program at Georgia College encourages graduate studies for Returned Peace Corps volunteers (RCPV’s). Fellows who are accepted to participating graduate programs in their field are awarded assistantships that relate to their experience and training in the Peace Corps.\n\nUpon successful completion of their Peace Corps Volunteer assignment, RCPV’s can apply to the Georgia College MFA Program (the application process is the same as for all applicants, but see the Peace Corps website for more information about RCPV eligibility requirements).\n\nPeace Corps Volunteers who wish to pursue these Coverdell Fellowships should initially contact Kerry Neville, who coordinates the Coverdell Fellows Program on behalf of the university.\n\nAssistantships are typically awarded in the spring for positions beginning fall semester. For that reason, potential Coverdell Fellows should make formal application by Feb.1 prior to the fall semester they plan to matriculate. The formal application must include the Peace Corps Description of Service (DOS) Certification of Service document: https://www.peacecorps.gov/returned-volunteers/support-services/certifi… \"\n\nEarly College\n\nTypically, Peace Corps Coverdell Fellows in the MFA program at Georgia College help to organize and mentor our Early College writing-in-the-schools project. Early College is a public school housed at the Georgia College campus, serving students from Baldwin and Putnam counties. Georgia College undergraduate majors, under the supervision of MFA students and faculty, mentor seventh graders in the Early College program and help them to publish a literary journal called The Peacock’s Feather.\n\nGeorgia College Early College was initially supported by funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for which the program remains grateful.\n\nThree Year Plan\n\nMost students complete the MFA program in three years. To meet MFA requirements, students take a minimum of 18 credit hours in the first year and 12 credit hours in the second and third years. Note: for students on MFA assistantships who are eligible to teach, there are additional teaching/pedagogy courses and other requirements designed to support and prepare Teaching Fellows.\n\nA Typical Sample Plan for MFA Coursework:\n\nAll students take 34 hours of coursework: ENGL-MFA 4-semester credit hour courses (28 hours); ENGL 3-semester credit hour courses (6 hours):\n\n12 hours: 5000-level and 6000-level courses in the student's major writing genre (3 courses): ENGL 5021, ENGL 6021 and ENGL 6025 (poetry genre); ENGL 5012, ENGL 6012 and ENGL 6026 (creative nonfiction genre); ENGL 5022, ENGL 6022 and ENGL 6026 (fiction genre).\n\n4 hours: Course in non-thesis genre workshop (1 course); ENGL 5011, 5012, 5021, or 5022. Note that 5000-level workshops in a genre are the prerequisite for 6000-level seminars in a genre (see electives section below).\n\n12 hours: Electives chosen from ENGL 5011, 5012, 5021, 5022, 6012, 6021, 6022, 6024, 6025, 6026 (these courses are repeatable; some have prerequisites; approved ENGL 5950 MFA Special Topics may also be chosen (no more than 8 hours of MFA Special Topics courses may count towards elective requirements).\n\n6 hours: Non-MFA ENGL 5000-6000 level courses (at least one course at the 6000 level).\n\nAll students also complete the MFA Thesis (8 hours). All students must complete a thesis, with the accompanying critical essay, as well as complete a successful thesis defense in order to graduate. The thesis is intended to be a book-length project. A prose thesis must be a minimum of 100 pages, and a poetry thesis must be a minimum of 35 pages. Students have to complete a thesis in the genre of their specialization; we do permit hybrid thesis projects that are written to be a singular combination, but we do not permit hybrid thesis projects that are a compilation of stories, essays, and poems thrown together to create page length. The thesis defense is an oral defense of your thesis, attended by the thesis director, the thesis committee members, and the student, and is scheduled at least 2 weeks before the end of your final term.\n\nEnglish Course Descriptions from graduate Course cAtalog\n\nTotal Credits required: 42\n\nFAQ\n\nIf I write in multiple genres, do I have to choose just one to submit in my application?\n\nYes, choose one for your application. Still our program does encourage study in a second genre -- in fact, we require each student to take at least one workshop out-of-genre.\n\nHow do you choose which genre to apply in? Submit your best work. We accept candidates primarily on the merits of the writing sample. You will be expected to write your thesis in the genre you submitted.\n\nFor my writing sample, can I submit a chapter of a novel-in-progress? What if I don’t have a full 15 pages I’m proud of for my sample?\n\nA chapter is fine, or a completed short story/essay. However, the more complete, the better. Quality over quantity.\n\nDo I need a BA in Writing or English to apply?\n\nNo. We've had students in the past with various undergraduate degrees. If you have a strong sample, apply. However, we do review transcripts to see if students have completed some humanities courses (in English or other fields); and although there is no minimum G.P.A., almost all of our applicants have been successful students, earning 3.0 or higher in their academic studies.\n\nHow many courses do Teaching Fellows teach each semester?\n\nHere’s the standard procedure (per semester) for G.A. Teaching Fellows:\n\n1st year: Graduate Assistants work in the Writing Center as Consultants OR Writing Center + Journal office or Early College; and serve as readers for Arts & Letters Journal.\n\n2nd year: Graduate Assistant Teaching Fellows teach 2 classes; OR Journal or Early College + Teach 1 class; and serve as readers for Arts & Letters Journal.\n\n3rd year: Teach 2 classes; and serve as readers for Arts & Letters Journal.\n\nThe exception is for candidates who already have an MA. They are eligible to begin teaching two classes the first year and continue that for all three years. However, all students on MFA assistantship must undergo a further application/review process before they will be assigned teaching duties.\n\nWhat is the stipend and tuition remission that your students receive if offered an MFA graduate assistantship?\n\nThe current stipend given to those with an MFA assistantship is $8,600 per year. In addition, many MFA assistantships include scholarship funds (amounts vary). MFA assistantships also include full tuition remission for in-state or out-of-state tuition (student fees, however, are not covered).\n\nThere are also other university assistantships available to which MFA students may apply. These assistantships offer smaller stipends, but usually include full tuition remission (again, student fees are not covered).\n\nThere is a student health insurance plan that meets the requirements of the new Affordable Health Care Act that students purchase or they may waived the student insurance if they have another qualified insurance plan.\n\nWhat is the difference between an MFA assistantship and Peace Corp Coverdell Fellows?\n\nUpon successful completion of their Peace Corps Volunteer assignment, RCPV’s can apply to the Georgia College MFA Program (the application process is the same as for all applicants, but see the Peace Corps website for more information about RCPV eligibility requirements).\n\nHow many applications do you typically receive and how many do you accept?\n\nWe typically review over 100 applications each year for the program. We enroll about 7 new students each year, with a balanced number in each of the three thesis genres (fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction). Typically, seven MFA assistantships are assigned to new students accepted in the program; other students might be offered other university assistantships or seek out other funding support. The three-year program enrolls about 25 students total.\n\nWhat constitutes a good recommender?\n\nIt's important to have professional recommenders (i.e., employer supervisors, established writers, college professors). Ideally, these people can speak to your ability to work and handle graduate classes and speak to the quality of your writing. You may choose different sorts of people to speak to your different qualities. These should not be friends or family members.\n\nIf I’m reapplying, what do I need to do?\n\nYou will not need to re-submit everything, and there is no fee for second-time applicants. You will need to contact Graduate Admissions and the MFA program to announce that you are re-applying. We suggest submitting to the MFA program an updated manuscript and your statement of purpose and resume. You do NOT need to re-submit transcripts, unless you've taken a class at another college since you last applied.\n\n* NOTE You will need to submit again a new application to the Graduate Admissions office. You may use your old letters of recommendation, or submit new letters. .\n\nOur Community\n\nOur Current Students\n\nFICTION\n\nAsh Earnhardt, Noah Lorey, Elissa Williams, Serena Kerkstra, Sarah Neilson, Katelyn Moorman, Tulasi Acharya, Jordan Crider, Christian Gurrola, Emily McKinney, Ben Andrews, Michaela Reed, and Nathanael Williams.\n\nPOETRY\n\nKay Hammond, Emma Garcia, Christina Faber, Isabelle Anderson, Michael Sevcik, Cas McKinney, and Kai Beck.\n\nCREATIVE NONFICTON\n\nRichard Lassiter and Dan Johnston\n\nWriters Who Publish\n\nAlthough we don’t expect incoming students to have published their work, since our program began in 2001, our students have been publishing their poems, stories, and essays in many national journals.\n\nGC students have published in such journals as Backwards City Review, Big Muddy, Bloom, Cimarron Review, Colorado Review, Crazyhorse, Cream City Review, Descant, Dos Passos Review, Eclipse, International Poetry Review, McSweeney’s, Meridian, Nimrod, Pebble Lake, Poet Lore, Quick Fiction, Rattle, Redivider, River Teeth, Salt Hill, Santa Clara Review, Spinning Jenny, Thema, Touchstone and many others.\n\nOur Alumni\n\nAlumni Donors Thank You\n\nDanny Bauer\n\nAshlee Crews\n\nJanet Dale\n\nSteve Lavender\n\nShawn Parkinson\n\nDaniel Plunkett\n\nSeth Tomko\n\nWilliam Torgerson\n\nGwendolyn Turnbull\n\nChristopher Varn\n\nOur alumni have been up to many great things, and we are excited to share just a few with you here.
