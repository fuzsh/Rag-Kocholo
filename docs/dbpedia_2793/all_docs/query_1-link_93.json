        "text": "County in Georgia, United States\n\nCounty in Georgia\n\nHabersham County is a county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 46,031.[1] The county seat is Clarkesville.[2] The county was created on December 15, 1818, and named for Colonel Joseph Habersham of the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War.[3]\n\nHabersham County comprises the Cornelia, GA Micropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 279 square miles (720 km2), of which 277 square miles (720 km2) is land and 2.3 square miles (6.0 km2) (0.8%) is water.[4] The county is located within the Blue Ridge Mountains, a segment of the Appalachian Mountains. The county also includes part of the Chattahoochee National Forest.\n\nThe highest point in the county is a 4,400-foot (1,300 m) knob less than 700 feet (210 m) southeast of the top of Tray Mountain, the seventh-highest mountain in Georgia. Habersham shares this portion of Tray Mountain, just 30 vertical feet shy of the peak's 4,430-foot summit, with White County to the west and Towns County to the north. 2.4 miles to the northeast of Tray Mountain is Young Lick (elevation 3,809 feet (1,161 m)). The Appalachian Trail runs along the top of the high ridge between Young Lick and Tray, a part of the Blue Ridge Mountain crest.\n\nHabersham is mostly located in the Upper Chattahoochee River sub-basin of the ACF River Basin (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin), with the northeastern corner of the county located in the Tugaloo River sub-basin in the larger Savannah River basin, and the southeastern portion located in the Broad River sub-basin of the same Savannah River basin.[5]\n\nThe Chattahoochee River rises in what used to be Habersham County, as portrayed in Sidney Lanier's poem \"Song of the Chattahoochee\":\n\nOut of the hills of Habersham,\n\nDown the valleys of Hall,\n\nI hurry amain to reach the plain,\n\nRun the rapid and leap the fall,\n\nSplit at the rock and together again.\n\nThe county, originally comprising much of Northeast Georgia, was cut up dramatically in the latter half of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century; as population increased in the area, new counties were organized from it and borders were changed. In 1857, its most western part was added to Lumpkin County, which had been created in 1832. That same year, the area east of Lumpkin and west of present-day Habersham became White County. In 1859, Banks County was carved from Habersham's southernmost territory. Finally, in 1905, Stephens County was formed from parts of Habersham and Banks.\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nRabun County - north\n\nOconee County, South Carolina - east\n\nStephens County - east\n\nBanks County - south\n\nHall County - southwest\n\nWhite County - west\n\nTowns County - northwest\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nAll of Habersham County is served by the Habersham County School District.[6]\n\nThe Tallulah Falls School is located in Tallulah Falls. Piedmont University and North Georgia Technical College are also located in Habersham county.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18203,145—183010,671239.3%18407,961−25.4%18508,89511.7%18605,966−32.9%18706,3226.0%18808,71837.9%189011,57332.7%190013,60417.5%191010,134−25.5%192010,7305.9%193012,74818.8%194014,77115.9%195016,55312.1%196018,1169.4%197020,69114.2%198025,02020.9%199027,62110.4%200035,90230.0%201043,04119.9%202046,0316.9%2023 (est.)48,757[7]5.9%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nHabersham County, Georgia – Racial and ethnic composition\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic)\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

The prison was named after Lee Arrendale, former Chairman of the Georgia Board of Corrections, after he and his wife were killed in a plane crash.[citation needed] The facility was originally constructed as a tuberculosis (TB) hospital, when treatment consisted primarily of rest in sanatoriums. It operated until the mid-1950s; with antibiotics, TB was better controlled and such hospitals were no longer needed. The facility was transferred to the Georgia Prison system.\n\nOnce acquired by the Georgia Department of Corrections, it was first used to house youthful offenders from ages 18–25. Over a short amount of time, Lee Arrendale prison gained a bad reputation as the second most violent all-male prison in the state. In 2005, however the Department of Corrections decided to make the prison an exclusive general purpose women's prison. As a result of the prison's past troubles and reputation for violence, the state decided to make this change to improve the prison's status in the state. In March 2006, the prison took in 350 women prisoners from Georgia's overflowing jail system to start this process.\n\nLee Arrendale is also home to the United States' first all-female fire department[citation needed] and the state's first inmate fire department,[citation needed], thanks to the Georgia Department of Corrections' (GDC) Fire Services Division. The GDC operates many fire departments throughout the state, staffed solely by inmates, who are supervised by GDC employees. Such inmates are trained as certified officers but as professional firefighters. The inmate firefighter program provides fire protection to the largely rural communities without local or volunteer fire departments near the prisons, as well as to other locations in Georgia during emergencies. Inmates are trained and certified in accordance with Georgia law and the Georgia Firefighter Standards and Training Council, as with any regular fire department. In 2007, inmate fire squads responded to the wildfires in South Georgia near Waycross, Georgia,[citation needed] in addition to the hundreds of other alarms they received statewide.\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nCensus-designated place\n\n[edit]\n\nRaoul\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nBatesville\n\nHabersham Mills\n\nHollywood\n\nTurnerville\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nState of Georgia portal\n\nBlair Line\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Habersham County, Georgia\n\nList of counties in Georgia\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
