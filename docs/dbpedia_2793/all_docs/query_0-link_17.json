        "text": "The Dual Enrollment Program allows qualified high school students to maximize their education and career training by taking courses that earn college and high school course credit at the same time.\n\nWHY DUAL ENROLLMENT\n\nStudies show that students who participate in Dual Enrollment are more likely to earn more college credits, pursue a bachelor’s degree, and are more likely to earn higher first-semester GPAs than their non-participating peers. Dual Enrollment introduces students to college-level coursework and allows for potential career exploration.\n\nWHO IS ELIGIBLE\n\nStudents must be enrolled in a participating Georgia high school or approved home-study program. 11th and 12th graders or returning 10th graders are eligible to take any approved course. New 10th graders may take career courses listed on the Course Directory or have required SAT or ACT scores to take core courses. Eligible 9th graders may participate. However, there is no state funding available for 9th grade students.\n\nFUNDING FOR TUITION\n\nTuition, fees, and books are covered for the first 30 hours for those who meet eligibility requirements. Other funding options may be available beyond the Dual Enrollment funding capped hours. For students who participated prior to Summer 2020, see Resources page for funding eligibility.\n\nAPPROVED COURSES\n\nThe Dual Enrollment Course Directory contains a list of approved Dual Enrollment funded courses at participating TCSG colleges. Approved courses include Academic Core and Career, Technical and Agricultural (CTAE) courses.\n\nDual Enrollment Information & Resources\n\nHow to Apply\n\nStudents must apply for and meet the admission criteria for the TCSG college. College applications may be found on the local college’s website.\n\nThe student must complete the Dual Enrollment Funding Application. Once completed, the parent/guardian must electronically complete the “Parent Participation Agreement” section of the application.\n\nYouTube tutorial video of the application process.\n\nParticipating high school counselors must approve the funding application and courses from the GaFutures Course Directory.\n\nStudents must be accepted by the TCSG college, and the college must approve the Dual Enrollment courses and funding application.\n\nHome Study Dual Enrollment Information and Application.\n\nEligibility\n\nA student must be enrolled in and attending a participating eligible public or private high school in Georgia, or an eligible participating home study program in Georgia.\n\nGrade Level Eligibility\n\nEligible 11th & 12th Graders may enroll in any approved Dual Enrollment courses listed on the Course Directory.\n\nEligible 10th Graders may enroll in approved Career, Technical, and Agricultural Education (CTAE) courses listed on the Course Directory at any participating TCSG college. Eligible 10th graders who have a minimum SAT score of 1200, or minimum ACT composite score of 26 in a single national test administration, may enroll in any approved CTAE and Core Academic courses listed on the Course Directory.\n\nEligible 9th graders may participate in the Dual Enrollment Program. However, there is no available state funding for 9th grade students.\n\nAll postsecondary coursework must be completed prior to high school graduation or home study completion to receive Dual Enrollment credit and funding.\n\nDual Enrollment Funding Cap\n\nEffective Summer term 2020 and beyond, the Dual Enrollment Funding Program is capped at 30 semester credit hours for all first-time Dual Enrollment-funded students. The funding cap does not include dual credit coursework attempted and paid for by other sources.\n\nThe award is available for up to a maximum of 15 semester credit hours per term.\n\nDual Enrollment funding includes funding for tuition, mandatory fees, and books.\n\nDual Enrollment funding is available up to the student’s high school or home study graduation date, or the student reaches the funding cap, whichever occurs first.\n\nPrimary Options for Students who Reach the Funding Cap\n\nA student may self-pay for college courses. TCSG colleges may charge the student tuition, fees, and books, based on credit hours of enrollment not covered by Dual Enrollment funding.\n\nA student may qualify for HOPE and Career Grant Bridge funding if the student is enrolled in an eligible Career Grant certificate or diploma program at a TCSG institution. The HOPE Grant provides tuition assistance. The student may have some tuition, fees, and book expenses. Check with the TCSG college\n\nUpon reaching the Funding Cap, the TCSG college may charge tuition and a prorated portion of the mandatory fees and book costs, based on credit hours not covered by Dual Enrollment funding.\n\nOther Options for Students who Reach the Funding Cap\n\nStudents may self-pay for tuition, fees, and books if:\n\nStudent chooses to enroll in a course not on the Dual Enrollment Course Directory.\n\nStudent is not eligible for the Dual Enrollment Funding Program due to grade level requirements.\n\nStudent is not enrolled in an eligible or participating high school.\n\nPostsecondary Out of Pocket Expenses\n\nBecause Dual Achievement Program students graduate from high school with nine high school credits, students will first need to attend a Technical College in Georgia and complete 30 credit hours of Associate degree level core academic courses, and may then transfer to a four year college or university in Georgia.\n\nResources for Funding and Financial Aid\n\nDual Enrollment Course Directory – a list of the Dual Enrollment Funding Program courses.\n\nFAQs – Dual Enrollment Funding Program – as of May 15, 2020.\n\nHope and Zell Miller Grants – Eligible Dual Enrollment students who have exhausted the 30-credit hour Dual Enrollment Funding Cap may qualify for the HOPE Grant, HOPE Career Grant, or Zell Miller Grant.\n\nFast Facts of Dual Enrollment Funding Model\n\nAccuplacer\n\nVisit Accuplacer for sample questions and explanations.\n\nJoint Enrollment\n\nHigh school students enrolled in a high school not participating in the Dual Enrollment Program or taking courses not approved for Dual Enrollment funding, may enroll in postsecondary courses while continuing to pursue a high school diploma. Under the Joint Enrollment Program, the postsecondary coursework credit is not accepted as credit towards the student’s high school graduation requirements. Joint Enrolled students may qualify for the HOPE Grant Program or may choose to self-pay for tuition, fees, and books.\n\n28 Courses Guaranteed to Transfer to USG Colleges & Universities\n\n28 Courses Guaranteed to Transfer to USG Colleges & Universities\n\nThere are 28 TCSG courses with guaranteed transfer to USG colleges and universities. (link to actual flyer)\n\nTCSG has transfer agreements with many of Georgia’s private colleges as well.\n\nGAtracs Course Transfer Information\n\nDual Enrollment vs. Accelerated Career\n\nAccelerated Career\n\nAccelerated Career Information\n\nAccelerated Career Available Programs\n\nDual Enrollment Contacts\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields"
