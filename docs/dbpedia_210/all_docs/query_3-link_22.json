        "text": "An examination of numerous specimens of the bursid genus Crossata, found in museum and private collections, lead us to conclude that C. californica (Hinds, 1843) and C. ventricosa (Broderip, 1833) are separate species, geographically isolated from one another and are morphologically distinct. This differs from the current widely held view that they represent a single, wide ranging and extremely variable species occurring from southern California to Chile. Crossata californica ranges from southern California to Baja California, with an isolated relic population in the Gulfo de California. Crossata ventricosa which appears to be a species complex, ranges from southern Ecuador through Peru, and rarely into northern Chile, although with further study the latter may be found to represent a new species. A new species Crossata barbarajeanae n. sp. is described from specimens previously assigned to C. ventricosa from the vicinity of Bahia de la Independencia, Peru.\n\nRecent molluscan types currently housed in the Malacology Section of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County are listed herein. Each type lot entry includes original species/subspecies name, original genus, author, original citation, type status, LACM number, number of specimens and preservation, type locality or collection locality, collector [if known], date collected [if known], and current taxonomic status if different from original description. INTRODUCTION This catalog is published in accordance with Recommendation 72F.4 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Ride & others, 2000:79). This listing includes all molluscan type material currently housed at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and supercedes the type listing of Sphon (1971). To date 1922 molluscan type lots (71,000+ specimens) are reported for 1147 species and 99 subspecies, which includes 589 holotypes, 1277 paratype lots, 10 lectotypes, 13 paralectotype lots, 29 syntype lots, 3...\n\nThis paper describes and provides information on the species of the genus Conus (Neogastropoda:Conidae) preserved in the Laboratorio de Biología y Sistemática de Invertebrados Marinos de la Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas (LaBSIM) y el Museo de Historia Natural de la Universidad Nacional de San Marcos (MUSM). The material was collected at the Department of Tumbes (9 locations) and Piura (16 locations). Intesive collect was realized in April 2007 and occasional in posterior years. Of the 16 reported species it is counted with material corresponding to 11 of them: Conus (Conus) gladiator Broderip, 1833; Conus (Asprella) arcuatus Broderip & Sowerby, 1829; Conus (Cylinder) lucidus Wood, 1828; Conus (Leptoconus) poormani Berry, 1968; Conus (L.) recurvus Broderip, 1833; Conus (Pyruconus) fergusoni ;Sowerby, 1873; Conus (P.) patricius Hinds, 1843; Conus (Ximeniconus) mahogani Reeve,1843; Conus (X.) perplexus Sowerby, 1857; Conus (X.) tornatus Sowerby, 1833 and Conus (X.) ximenes Gray, 1839..."
