Iredale's (1936, pl. 22, figs. 21Á23) illustrations of Plastiscala morchi show a shell with aligned ventral varices that are absent from New Zealand specimens, and with much weaker spiral cords (Scala morchi Angas 1871:15, pl. 1, fig. 7; May 1923:63, pl. 29, fig. 13;Cotton 1956:4, fig. 13;Macpherson 1958:33, pl. 29, fig. 13;Weil et al. 1999:140, fig. 433). Australian specimens are also much smaller (H 7Á8 mm for the apparent synonym Plastiscala verconis Cotton [1939:172]; H 9.7, D 2.8 mm for the holotype of P. morchi, BMNH 1871.7.5.10). New Zealand specimens are also ...\n\nContext 2\n\n... all have much fewer, lower, more widely spaced, less sharply defined axial costae, weaker spiral sculpture, and a more prominent peribasal ridge. The regularly pitted surface of Opalia flemingi n. sp. cannot be a preservational artefact, so the new species is not related to such taxa as Acrilla acuminata (G. B. Sowerby II, 1844) ( Wilson 1993, fig. p. 274; Indo-West Pacific to Keppell Bay, Queensland). Another Australian Recent species that resembles O. flemingi n. sp. quite closely is Propescala valida (Verco, 1906) (Verco 1906a:147, pl. 4, fig. 7;Cotton 1956:1, fig. 19), which, however, is much smaller (H 7 mm). A final Australian(?) species resembling the new species is 'Scalaria' ...\n\nContext 3\n\n... Cominella (Eucominia) incisa is al- most as little-known and poorly understood as Mitrellatoma angustata (Hutton, 1886) (see below). However, the taxonomic position of C. incisa is much clearer than that of M. angustata. Suter's (1915, pl. 4, fig. 13) illustra- tion (the only previous one) and examination of the holotype (Fig. 7A, G) make it clear that it is a small Cominella (Eucominia) species in the group typified by C. onokeana (King) (1933:345, pl. 37, fig. 14) and C. otagoensis (Finlay, 1926). Finlay (1926a:240) included all these in his genus Zephos, now regarded as a synonym of Cominella (Eucominia). As the specimen is turned slightly to the left in ...\n\nContext 4\n\n...

However, only the lower plait seems to extend down the whole columella in A. pisanopsis and A. cancellaria. All three also have unusually graceful shapes and narrow, cancellate spiral and axial sculpture, although the sculpture is much weaker on A. speighti than ...\n\nContext 8\n\n... down the whole columella in A. pisanopsis and A. cancellaria. All three also have unusually graceful shapes and narrow, cancellate spiral and axial sculpture, although the sculpture is much weaker on A. speighti than on the others. A. pisanopsis and A. cancellaria also differ from A. speighti in having a shorter and more mammillate protoconch (Fig. 7I, J), although it is equally smooth in all three species. Only the Nukumaruan and pos- sibly Mangapanian species A. pisanopsis, A. cancellaria and possibly A. speighti belong in this genus; the other species previously referred here are transferred tentatively to Macrozafra Finlay, 1926, and this might well be a better position than ...\n\nContext 9\n\n... material examined. Tainui Shellbed strongly sculptured form: GS10963, R22/ f6619A, re-collection of GS4013, Tainui Shellbed (OIS 13) at 'the buttress', Castlecliff coastal section, Wanganui (nine, including TM5523, specimen illustrated by Ponder [1972, fig. 8.7]); GS4013, R22/f6353, Tainui Shellbed at 'the buttress' (35); GS4022 re- collection, R22/f6360, head of 'the pinnacles' gully (one). Recorded also by Fleming (1953:230) from Tainui Shellbed in GS4031, R22/f6369; GS4097 and GS4102, both allo- cated R22/f6516; all from the Castlecliff coastal section.

Ponder also commented that 'A fossil population from the Tainui Shellbed at Castle- cliff, Wanganui, has a stronger shoulder and more distinct secondary axial foliation than most Recent shells ( fig. 8:7). Other Castleclif- fian shells resemble Recent specimens so that the Tainui form is here regarded as merely an aberrant population of aucklandicus. Somewhat similar shells are found in deep water off the Otago coast' (Ponder 1972:495). As this dis- tinctive form is limited to Tainui Shellbed, I examined it to assess its utility in ...\n\nContext 11\n\n... bonneti (Cossmann, 1903) (Fig. 9AÁD, H Cossmann (1903, pl. 3, fig. 7), although the sculptural details have not been appreciated from Cossmann's small figure.

There is no doubt that Cossmann originally had only one specimen, so two others remaining in the ...\n\nContext 12\n\n... pouch and their feeding on the yolks of nurse eggs by B. hanleyi in New South Wales. B. hanleyi produces crawl-away miniatures of the adult, that is, it has direct development, and the protoconch of the initial hatched juvenile (Anderson 1966, fig. 6) consists only of a half- whorl hemispherical 'cap' and an initial half- whorl of teleoconch. fig. 27A,B). However, the latest classification returned B. blosvillei to Bedeva; the 46-mm-high specimen illustrated (Houart in Poppe 2008:198, pl. 394, fig. 10) is similar to B. bartrumi. The Otahuhu specimens are particularly similar to a specimen labelled 'Bedeva vapida Woolacott, 1957' in GNS (WM9323, Yeppoon, Queensland, ex W. J. Paul ...\n\nContext 13\n\n... possibly belong in Kuroshio- turris, such as ' Micantapex' hecatorguia (Verco, 1907) (Cotton 1947, pl. 3, unnumbered fig.) and Epidirona nodulosa Laseron (1954:9, pl. 1, figs. 21Á23). The same is also true of some of the small, narrow New Zealand fossil species traditionally included in Bathytoma, such as B. filaris (Marwick) (1931:134, pl. 15, fig. 279). Some of the smaller, more finely sculptured species referred by Marwick (1931) to Gemmu- la, such as G. peraspera (Marwick 1931:133, pl. 15, figs. 276, 277), are also similar to Kuroshio- turris putere n. sp. in their paucispiral proto- conch, narrowly triangular peripheral keel, and few prominent spiral cords on the base of an ...\n\nContext 14\n\n... Sand specimens are also similar to the form long known as Antimelatoma buchanani maorum (E. A. Smith, 1877). Dell (1963a:176, pl. 2, fig. 7) pointed out that this form had never been illustrated previously, apart from Suter's (1913, pl. 46, fig. 22) featureless little drawing, and supplied a photo- graph of the holotype, in BMNH. Dell's illustration and examination of the holotype (Fig. 14F) show that this form differs from the common NukumaruanÁCastlecliffian form of ...\n\nContext 15\n\n... material examined. The one specimen of Mitrellatoma angustata I am aware of other than the holotype is that illustrated by Powell (1942, pl. 12, fig. 7), from Devils Elbow Mudstone at the top of Devils Elbow hill, Napier-Wairoa Highway (Highway 2) ca 35 km N of Napier, late Nukumaruan (TM8589, GS2220, V20/f8462; Fig. 16H, K). Despite extensive re-collection at this highly diverse locality over 50 yr, I have not collected another ...\n\nContext 16\n\n... might come to light so its status is clarified. Mitrellatoma angustata is one of the rarest and least well understood of Hawke's Bay Nukumar- uan molluscs, being recorded only as the holo- type (as stated by Powell [1942:109], the holotype is a rather poor, severely abraded specimen) and the single specimen illustrated by Powell (1942, pl. 12, fig. 7) (also significantly abraded). Powell (1942:109) stressed its great similarity to a small specimen of a Phenatoma species, and it appears feasible to me that this species is based on a highly aberrant individual of a Phenatoma species, such as the weakly sculptured Nukumar- uan species P. precursor Powell (1942:109, pl. 10, fig. 8).
