I am hoping that when the Everglades National Park will have become a reality, which is soon to be, that some arrangement will be made for a summer course, parallel t6 the Woods Hole seasons, when qualified students under qualified guidance may have an bpporturiity to become acquainted with living marine organisms in their native habitat, and see the many wonderful peculiar, synchronous associations which this region affords. Such an ecologic study on the part of Paleontologists translated into their fossil assemblages, should, I believe, reduce many things assigned different vertical distributional positions on account of the diversity in faunal assemblages to a horizontal field, in which space rather than time constitutes the dominant factor. Once again let me present a cross section of this region, let us say from the center of the Everglades eastward to the Florida Strait. In presenting this picture I shall people my field largely with the creatures that have been my favorite subject for study, the Mollusks; they still play a dominant role in paleontology. Everglades The glades, immense stretches of shallow water with good stands of saw grass that makes wading from point to point a somewhat painful, or at all events, a not altogether delightful enterprise. The uninitiated can picture it by conceiving a partially submerged, luscious meadow, miles upon miles in extent, played upon by the varying breezes and the lights and shades produced by the passing clouds. Here in season we may see in places, Sandhill Cranes, a dozen spe- cies of Herons, Ibises in flocks, the Limpkin, and tilting overhead, or combing the field, Turkey Buzzards, and in spots even now, Everglade and Swallow-tailed Kites. -â¢- ' . : Paleontologically considered, the glades proper with their feet of muck composed of vegetable detritus and such animal remains as can be preserved in such places, should prove of interest to the Paleontologist. Here we find a peculiar molluscan assemblage: ..' i' â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢'' '* Stagnicola cubensis (Pfr.) , .

Cypress Swamps Bordering the glades we may have immense stands of Bald Cypress. These are also wading in the shallow waters with their breathing knees lifted above the surface, shedding pollen, leaf and cone year by year, to form a field for the Paleobotanist. Nor is this all, for here the Crocodilians, the Turtles and Snakes, as well as a host of Batrachians, find a suitable home in which they may enjoy life, little disturbed even by man. Bear, Panthers and Raccoons aplenty, as well as many birds, make this their home, and in passing add their bones to the geologic contri- butions of today, .. V. * .' . 4- â¢ Flying over lower Florida brings plainly into view, how the land graudally slopes southward, how barring the hurricane rampart at the southern edge of the mainland, we see to the northward a continuation of the keys that characterize the \"Bay of Florida,\" but gradually lift- ing above the water. Once clear of water we cease to call them keys; they now become \"hammocks,\" which, botanically considered, must be sepa- rated into several associations. ' : , \" . ' \"l , Palmetto Association This consists of dense stands of Palmettos with small shrubs and grasses as a ground cover. Here some forms of Liguus and Chondropoma dent at urn may be found. Palmetto-Deciduous Association In this the deciduous trees usually predominate, with only a sprink- ling of the former. This will contain the mollusks common to the Decidu- ous Tree Association. The Deciduous Tree Association This frequently forms dense tangles interlaced with vines and - shrubs to form almost impenetrable thickets. The branches of the trees are frequently covered with mats of Orchids, Bromeliads, or Ferns. Here on the trunks of the tall trees we may find some of the members of the 17 named forms of Liguus fasciatus. or of the 9 subspecies of Liguus crenatus, as well as Oxystyla undata (Bruguiere) or Oxystyla floridensis Pilsbry, or Drymaeus multilineaus (Say), Drymaeus dormani (W.G.B.) or Drymaeus domini- cus (Rue.lTWhile occupying a less elevated position, we may see Cepolis\n\nâ¢;*\"â¢ â¢ varians (Menke), Cnoridrorioma dentatum (Say) or Hejlicina orbiculata clappi Pils ... and still lower in the shrubbery Bothriopupa variolosa (GldT) and PJJgigoma dioscoricc'la (AdsÂ»), while on the ground, tucked away among the rocky nooks and crannies, or when-showers have moistened the ground, crawling over the vegetable detritus we may find a whole mollusoan faunula as the following list will proclaim; Chondroppma dentatum (Say) ,.\"..''. .â¢â¢.'..' .'

This is poor pick- ing ground for the mollusk. student, for pines proclaim acid soil, which is not conducive to shell life. Here Cerion incannm Binney may frequent the open spaces. Mangrove Flats . ., To the southeast, the Everglades pass by imperceptible stages into the mangrove flats; here low bushes of scraggly mangroves try in vain to gain a foothold. Bayward they gradually grow more luxuriant and form large clumps, lifting their main trunks above the water by their outreach- ing roots or root stems that anchor them in the ground below the water. Here Littorina angulifera and Ostrea floridensis enjoy an airing with each ebbing tide, or the former may prefer the air for a longer period. The Mainland Hurricane Rampart At the southern end of the peninsula, stretching westward from Flamingo City through East, Middle and West Cape Sable, we have a huge sand dune varying in width from a dozen yards to the length of a city block. This represents the wave combings from the shallow floor of the Bay of Florida piled high and dry by Hurricanes and other winds. It con- sists of ground-mp bits of the Bay's life, embodying the skeletons of about everything that has withstood the wave-grinding process. Lagoons and Swales behind the Hurricane Rampart On the landward side of the hurricane rampart we are sure to find a depressed area filled with brackish water, usually in communication by narrow channels with the Bay. Places like these are usually bordered by trees or shrubs, in which Oxy_stvla and Ljguus hold forth, and in the but- ton bushes at the water's edge, Florida Red-winged Blackbirds and Boat- tailed Grackles makes their nests, while among the decaying leaves in the pools Hamlnoea elegans Gray finds a favorable home, Salt Pans In the northern edge of the Bay of Florida are some keys struggling hard to rise from the sea, or more probably to return to it at present. These frequently are barren rings with a slight central depression. These pans are sufficiently submerged at each high tide to admit a new influx of salt water through narrow channels to the shallow basin. Warm breezes and the sun's rays evaporate a great part of the water during the emergence\n\n- 17 - of the rim with the result that the contents of these pans Become hyper- saline, and not infrequently deposit layers of salt. In such salt pans we find a curious faunal assembly of Brine-^Shrimps. anif. â¢>.:..i;'â¢' .â¢'. . â¢ ;. . (^. Cerithidea scalariformis Say â¢ \"-':'.- .. .

Next we must consider the Bays, for lying off the mainland we have a series of shallow expanses of water kriown as Biscayne Bay, Barnes Sound^ Card Sound and Little Card Sound, which occupy the trough between-the mainland and the string of keys offshore. Later we shall speak of a second trough between these keys and the edge of the outlying reef known as Hawk Channel. ,;. Brackish Water.

Pilings and Docks. ... On. the JJiiteS in the harbor region and the stakes throughout the bays where these have not \"been protected by heavy creosoting, we may find a heavy incrusting with Barnacles,\" Ascidians, Bryozoa and. Modiolus demissus_ (Dillwyn) and Pinctada radiata (Leach),, while the wood where not protected\n\n- 18 - or sufficiently protected, may be riddled with Teredo floridana Bartsch and Bankia gouldi Barsch, or chewed away by Sphaeroma destructor Deep Channels Leading to Sea These now are dredged places as straight as ,the configuration of the bay will permit, but in the days gone- by they were not laid out by rule and compass, but sinuous natural passages winging their way to sea through low flats, usually steep-sided. Here Oysters and Pholads found a desirable habitat. * Ostrea virginica Gmelin Barnea costata Linnaeus Halimeda Association Some of the shallow water flats are covered by an almost pure stand of the calcareous alga Halimeda. which crunches under foot as one walks across, The segments of this form dense patches of considerable thickness. â¢'. â¢ â¢ . *- ' â¢''-â¢' â¢ .*â¢â¢,'â¢* Porites Association Under conditions apparently the same as those under which Halimeda occurs, frequently only separated by a lead of a few feet in width from this, other flats are characterized by a dominance of Porites furcata, the small branched coral easily held in the palm of a hand. \\. . i <:' â¢ KEYS * *',*â¢'â¢ > â¢ : \"' I The 1-Iangrove Fringe of the Keys on the Bay Side, under water Cn the bay side of the keys we usually have a moderately deep channel fringed by mangroves whose sprawling, outreaching roots repel all approach to the key from this side. Cn these roots below low tide we find clusters of Melina alata (Gmel.), while a little higher in the inter-tidal reaches Ostrea floridensis Sby. forms dense masses that com- pletely cover the roots and at low tide, when out of water, furnish plain proof the oysters here grow on trees. Here, too, we can find specimens of the beautiful Cowry, Cypraea exanthema L., under water. The Mangrove Fringe of the Keys. out of water Cn the mangrove roots, sometimes a yard or more above high tide level, Littorina angulifera Lam. is found abundantly, while on the beach among the drifted flotsam and jetsam Melampus coffeur (L.) and Auricula peHueens Mke. may be found in abundance, and Strobilops hubbardi steven- soni Pils. occurs under the bark of dead limbs.\n\n-19 - Interior of Keys Here where avaricious man has not destroyed the native forests we still find heavy stands of Gumbo limbo, Mahogany, Poison Tree, Wild Tama- rind, West Indian Birch, Darling and Coco plums and many others freighted with epiphetic orchids, Ferns and Bromeliads. On their boles and branches a sprinkling of Liguus can be found, and not infrequently their center harbors a little prairie with an abundance of Cerion incanum Binney, and Succineas. Cuts. Ripraps The harbor improvements of Miami have wrought many changes in Biscayne Bay; mud flats have been changed into islands by pumping the dredged material upon them, and in many places where Halimeda or Porites .reefs held forth we now find luxurious homes surrounded by or buried in . a mass of floral glory. Here the landscape architect has had an opportu- .-;;.. nity and he has used it in bringing here things beautiful from everywhere. The shallow cuts which in days of old made you wait for a high tide to slip across the bar, even in a moderate-draft boat, have been widened and deepened to admit shipping of all kinds, and that these chan- nels may not be filled by the ever southward shifting sharp sands of the outer beaches, long ripraps with stone facing have been placed on the north side of the cuts to shunt the sands eastward into deep waters. These jetties or sea walls are not only favorite places for the disciples of Izaak Walton, but have made a paradise for certain mollusks, which in the past found it difficult to locate a suitable place of at- tachment. Here we now find abundantly: â¢ i Tectarius muricatus (L0) Ceratozona rugosa (Sby. ) Siphonaria lineolata (d'Orb.) NerLta peloranta L. Nerita versicolor Gmelin Thais floridana (Gonr.)

This may present long stretches of loose, more or less shifting sand, . - where Cenchrus t ribuloides , the devilish sandspur, makes walking a misery, ';.-. or equal reaches of loose sand held down by the long runners of the Goats- foot Morning Glory, Ipomaea pes-caprae and Ipomaea bona~nox (Lx.). Still\n\n- 20 - other places where the long stolons ..of-the gracefully swaying Bermuda Grass are more or less successful-in checking the wind-blown sand.

' .:.ul.- ..;â¢â¢ _ ,,/_.. Shallow-water Sandy Stretches beyond the Keys When these are-'present they enable the burrowing mollusks to dig in, while the predatory members! of, the phylum hunt them out and devour them.

While small, they are so abundant that they-/furnish an element of commerce. To the knowing one, Coquina broth brings pleasant memories to the palate.

Here the Hog fish and various species of garishly colored Parrot Fish and Slippery Dicks and the burrowing Gnathops and the Stingaree and sometimes Manta birostris find a suitable habitat, and the long-spined Black Sea Urchin, Centrechinus antillarum Phil., whose contact one should avoid, nay live singly or in bunches of several dozens. At home here also are: Dosinia elegans Conrad Anodontia alba Link Oliva sayana Ravenel Polinices duplicata Say Natica canrena L. Sinum perspectivum Say Tonna galea L. Stag-Horn Coral Association : . Even among corals we have associations, as exemplified.by the stag- horn coral, Acropora cervieomis, which in places forms dense stands.cover- ing considerable space. To a somewhat lesser extent this is also true of the Palmate Coral. Acropora palmata. i â¢ Gorgonian Field â¢i â¢â¢ j. . â¢â¢ â¢ â¢ . . â¢ In the flats inside of the other reef we find extensive fields of Gorgonians, forming the so-called \"Sea Gardens,\" composed chiefly of va- rious species of Plexaura, Xiphigorgia. Gorgonia, Muricea. Eunicea and Pterogorgia. Museum specimens give little idea of the real beauty of these so-called \"Sea Garden\" denizens where the half-inch investment of slender zooids that characterizes them in life is shrunken into a thin animal film. Wading among them with a diving helmet, or viewing them through a water glass from above, certainly justifies the novices' name \"Sea Garden\" for they sway and bend to currents, the surge of waves or the pulsation of the sea as do plants on shore which their forms resemble.\n\n.â¢-- 23 - These colonial animals contribute largely to the reef deposits by adding their spicules upon their demise. Among them, on the sea fans our molluscan friends, Simmia uniplicata (Sowerby) and Cyphoma gibbosa. (L.), find their favorite habitat. Grassy Patches âââ¢â¢ââ¢â â¢ â¢ g â¢ â¢ (-â¢ Betwixt the Coral walls and the Gorgonian fields we may have long stretches of grass covered sand bottom, composed of the Sea Grass, Thalassiaj among which the trunklike Cowfish, Pipe Fishes, and the Sea Horses dwell* This, too, is the favorite habitat of the red Giant Star Fish, Oreaster reticulata L., and Tripneustes esculentus Lo, and the Giant Horse Conoh, FascjiQlaria gigantea Kiener, the largest Gastropod of the Atlantic, and Fasciolaria tulipa L., as well as the King and Queen Conchs, Caggig madagascarensis Lam., Cassis tuberosa L., and above all the Pink Conch, Strombus gigas L., whose delicious flesh has gained the name \"Conch\" for those devoted to this fish. Mixed in with these are Holothurians, while among the lesser folk may be listed the soft Sea Hare, Aplysia willcoxl Heilprin, Conus pealii Green and Nassarius ambiguus Monts. The Continental Shelf. 5-100 fms. Passing the reef area we come to a gradually sloping submarine plain of varying width, the so*-called Continental Shelf, which we may say ranges down to 100 fathoms0 This is a rich molluscan field; here among many others the following'species hold forth?

Among mollusks, we may mention the Squids, Spirula, the Pteropods and Heteropods; among the shelled Protozoa, Foraminifera on dying, drop enough skeletons to form an ooze known by this name, while others, like the Peridinae, at times are present in such countless numbers as to smother life in the region invested, requiring a restocking of the fauna of the place. This killing off occasionally is also due to the presence of Pseudomonas, likewise a flagellate protozoan .whose contribution of ammonia to the sea causes enough disbalance to pro- duce sufficient chemically precipitated ooze, suspended in the :water and on the bottom also, to choke all life, . :.,:-â¢ â¢'.':e In this brief account I have purpbsely avoided mentioning the nu- merous minute species of the families Epitoniidae, Melaneliidae, Pyramiâ dellidae, Caecidae, Rissoidae, Tripheridae, Cerithiopsidae, Vitrinellidae and others, since these are not the obvious things of the fauna0 I have selected those mollusks which force their attention upon the observer in each habitat; they, therefore, represent'the striking element of each as- sociation. Inclosing, may I express the hope that this brief account will arouse the interest of students of Ecology in this, the most marvelous field for such studies known to me.
