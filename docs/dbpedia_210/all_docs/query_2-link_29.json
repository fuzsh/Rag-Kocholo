        "text": "Biographical Etymology of Marine Organism Names. E & F\n\nThe polychaete name Nereis eakini Hartman, 1936 may possibly be a tribute to Prof. Dr. Richard Marshall Eakin, (5 May - Florence, Colorado) 1910-1999 (25 Nov. - Danville, Cal.), zoology professor at UC Berkeley (PhD there in 1935), who mainly worked on non marine animals. (more)\n\nDr. Nellie Barbara Eales, 1889-1989 (7 Dec. (a few months after having celebrated her 100:th birthday)), English malacologist at the Univ. College, Reading, specializing in opisthobranchs (also publishing much on the anatomy of the African elephant), who i.a. published \"The littoral fauna of Great Britain : a handbook for collectors\".\n\nDr. Frank Evelyn Eames, (22 Feb. - Forest Hill, London) 1906-1978 (16 Feb. - Guildford, Surrey), English geologist and palaeontologist with an unique expertise in both micro- and molluscan Tertiary palaeontology.\n\nThe British foraminiferologist Arthur Earland, 1866-1958, FRSE from 1942, life-long collaborator of Heron-Allen (q.v.), is honoured in the genera Earlandia Plummer, 1930, Earlandinella Cummings, 1955, Earlandinita Cummings, 1955 and Earlandammina Brönnimann & Whittaker, 1988 and the species Elphidium earlandi Cushman, 1936, Webbinella earlandi Rhumbler, 1935, Spiroplectammina earlandi (Parker, 1952) and Brizalina earlandi (Parr, 1951). The mineral Earlandite (Ca32(C6)2(H5)2(O7)·4(H2O) from deep southern sea bottoms) is also named for him.\n\nThe Hawaian boxer shrimp name Stenopus earlei Goy and Randall, 1984 has a masculine ending, so the honoured person is hardly the marine biologist Dr. Sylvia Earle, (30 Aug. - Gibbstown, New Jersey) 1935-, named \"Her deepness\" because of her many diving records. Evidently another exploratory diver, Mr. John L. Earle, 19??-, of the Bishop Museum (and mainly interested in ichthyology), is the honoured person (2:nd to the left in upper row here). [Luzonichthys earlei Randall, 1981, Cirrhilabrus earlei Randall & Pyle, 2001, Myripristis earlei Randall, Allen & Robertson, 2003]\n\nThe asteroid name Solaster earlli Verrill, 1879. may likely honour Robert Edward Earll, (24 Aug. - Waukegan, Ill.) 1853-1896 (19 Mar. - Chevy Chase, Md.), curator at the Smithsonian Institution between 1888-96, dealing with fisheries. He had been a Deputy Representative there and at the U. S. National Museum during the early 1880s\n\nThe acoel Conaperta earnhardti Hooge & Smith, 2003 from North Carolina, is in memory of \"race-car driver, and North Carolina native Dale 'The Intimidator' Earnhardt\", (29 Apr.) 1951-2001 (18 Feb. - car crash).\n\nLacking information about the collector G. Earnshaw in the fish name Amblycirrhitus earnshawi Lubbock, 1978.\n\nLacking information about East in the bivalve name Spondylus eastae Lamprell, 1992.\n\nThe decapod name Ptychognathus easteranus Rathbun, 1907 must be a tribute to Easter Island, the type locality, where R/V Albatross first found it in 1904, and is thus not an eponym, honouring a person.\n\nThe name Eastward in the copepod name Danielssenia eastwardae Coull, 1971 is not in honour of a person, but the Duke University ship Eastward, from which the species was collected.\n\nThe skate name Bathyraja eatonii (Günther, 1876), is likely not a tribute to the US (New York area) botanist Amos Eaton, (17 May) 1776-1842 (10 May), but much more likely a tribute to a collector in the Antarctic area (Heard Island), from where it was described, the Rev. Alfred Edwin Eaton, (25 Apr. - Little Bridge, Devon) 1844-1929, a dipterologist (but interested in practically all types of natural history), who collected there and published from Kerguelen and Heard Island in 1875 (the English Transit-of-Venus Expedition, including other British and German scientists who had left Cape Town with the ship H.M.S.S. Volage under captain Fairfax 18 Sep. 1874 and then left Kerguelen 27 Feb. 1875). When home again, Eaton took part in a summer expedition in 1875 to Spitsbergen together with the Arctic explorer Benjamin Leigh Smith, (12 Mar. - Whatlington, East Sussex) 1828-1913 (4 Jan. - Hampstead), on the steam yacht Diana.\n\nDr. Albin Ebersbach, 18??-19??, Zoologischen Institut der Universität Leipzig, from Rüsdorf at Glauchau, published on cirrate octopods in 1915 [Chunioteuthis ebersbachii Grimpe, 1916 (a synonym of Stauroteuthis syrtensis Verrill, 1879)].\n\nProf. Dr. Karl Joseph Eberth, (21 Sep. - Würzburg) 1835-1926 (2 Dec. - Berlin), was a physician (anatomist, pathologist & bacteriologist) and published \"Untersuchungen über Nematoden\", Leipzig, 1863. He finished his dissertation in his home town in 1859, became later Assistant (Prosektor) to Kölliker (q.v.) and still later he moved to Zürich [Anticoma eberthi Bastian, 1865, Calyptronema eberthi (de Man, 1876), Prooncholaimus eberthi (Filipjev, 1918)].\n\nProf. Viktor von Ebner-Rofenstein, (4 Feb. - Vorarlberg) 1842-1925 (20 Mar. - Wien), Austrian histology professor in Graz, later Vienna, who published on calcispongiae in 1887 [Ebnerella von Lendenfeld, 1891].\n\nClaudio Ebreo, (2 Apr. - Siracusa) 1928-1996 (10 Sep.), Italian malacologist.\n\nRonald J.

Eckis, (26 June) 1905-1999 (12 Nov.), Chief Geologist of the Richfield Oil Corporation, Los Angeles, is honoured in the foraminiferan name Suggrunda eckisi Natland, 1950.\n\nChristian Frederik (Friederich) Ecklon, (17 Dec. - Aabenraa, Denmark) 1795-1868 (last part of that year - Cape Town). In 1823 he landed as an apothecary's apprentice at the Cape of Good Hope and got interested in botany. In 1828 he returned home with vast amounts of plant collections, which were given to German and Danish botanists. However, he later returned to Africa and died eventually in Cape Town [Ecklonia Hornemann, 1828].\n\nDr. James E. Eckman, 19??-, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography & Office of Naval Research, is honoured in the harpacticoid name Bathycampus eckmani Huys & Thistle, 1989.\n\nEconomou-Amilli : (see Athena).\n\nSmithsonidrilus edgari Erséus, 1993 is named for Dr. Graham J. Edgar, 1955-, who has published on Australian fishes and other marine life (e.g. working as a tanaid taxonomist), University of Melbourne, who provided the type material of this species. Dr. Edgar later moved to Charles Darwin Research Station at Galapagos, where he is head of the marine research [Iphimedia edgari (Moore, 1981)].\n\nEdgar : (see E. A. Smith).\n\nLacking information about Edgard in the gastropod name Trivirostra edgardi Shaw, 1908, but possibly a tribute to Dr. Edgard Hérouard? (q.v.).\n\nHarold Eugene Edgerton, (6 Apr. - Fremont, Nebraska) 1903-1990 (4 Jan. Cambridge, Mass.), US marine scientist and inventor of the stroboscope. The foraminiferan genus Edgertonia Tendal & Hessler, 1977, was however not named for him, but for one of his relatives, Carol Craig Edgerton (in 1977 married to the geology professor James H. Natland, and from 1992 living in Key Biscayne), (Hollywood, California) 1945-2007 (31 July - Miami (cancer)), who sorted the samples in Hessler's laboratory in which the the first specimens of this genus were found and has continued work on foraminifera for long time after that description. Also another such taxon is named for her.\n\nLacking information about Edinger in the gastropod name Attiliosa edingeri Houart, 1998.\n\nThe gastropod name Odostomia edmondi Jordan, 1920 is in honour of Mr. George W. Edmond, 18??-19??, of Santa Monica, \"who first interested the author in the study of mollusca\". Mr. Edmond was a disciple of Amherst College in the early 1870s (so likely born during the 1850s) and in the beginning of the 20th century he had some kind of relationship with Stanford Univ. An exact namesake was assistant in chemistry at Johns Hopkins Univ. in 1922, possibly the same person?\n\nDr. Stanley Joe Edmonds, (13 Feb.) 1909-1995 (16 July), Sipunculid specialist at the South Australian Museum, who published a monograph on this group in 1972 together with Alexander Charles Stephen, (17 Dec. - Garvock Manse, Laurencekirk,. Kincardineshire) 1893-1966 (3 June).\n\nAeolidia edmonsoni Østergaard, 1955 was named for Prof. Dr. Charles Howard Edmondson, 1867-1970, \"for his generous aid in securing specimens\". Edmondson found specimens of this species at Waikiki already in 1922. He was Professor of Zoology at the University of Hawaii, and Director of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu. He studied sea-anemones and crustaceans of Hawaii, and wrote about ecology of coral reefs. In 1906 he had published his main work of his dissertation, \"The Protozoa of Iowa\". [Tegastes edmondsoni Pesta, 1932]. (Dr. D. Damkaer kindly provided this information).\n\nDr. Laurence Edmonston, (9 Feb.) 1795-1879 (7 Mar. - his residence Halligarth near Buness), was a Scottish physician at Balta Sound, Unst. with great naturalal history interests. His son Thomas Edmonston, (20 Sep.) 1825-1846 (24 Jan. - Sua Bay, Peru), was the author of “Flora of Shetland”, became professor of Botany in the Andersonian University, Glasgow at the age of 20, appointed shortly afterwards as naturalist on board H.M.S. Herald on her scientific expedition to the Pacific, but was accidentally killed.\n\nDr. Malcolm Edmunds,193?-, British opisthobranch researcher at the Univ. of Central Lancashire (now Prof. Em.), is honoured in the gastropod name Glossodoris edmundsi Cervera, Garcia-Gomez & Ortea, 1989. (Andrew Vik, Tampa, Florida, kindly provided this information).\n\nHenry M. Edson, 1877?-1912, US Malacologist.\n\nEduard in the amphipod name Stenothoe eduardi Krapp Schickel, 1975 : (see Chevreux).\n\nLacking information about Eduard in the Red Sea gastropod name Conus eduardi Delsaerdt, 1997.\n\n\"That obliging and indefatigable naturalist\", Mr. Edward of Banff, was one of Bate and Westwood's correspondents, sending them many specimens. Thomas Edward, (25 Dec. - Gosport, Portsmouth) 1814-1886 (27 Apr.), \"the Scotch Naturalist,\" was a humble shoemaker who collected marine animals in his \"spare time.\" He sent these to virtually every well-known British biologist of his period, and was rewarded with an A.L.S. (Associate of the Linnean Society) and many, many scientific names of species (and probably genera). He ended as a poorly paid curator of the Banff Museum of Natural History. Actually a biography - Life of a Scotch Naturalist - by Samuel Smiles, 1812-1904, was published already in 1877. (Dr. D. Damkaer kindly provided this information).\n\nF.E. Edwards : (see Bowerbank).\n\nBathydrilus edwardsi Erséus, 1984 is named for Mr. John Edwards, 19??-, \"(now in the UK), former resident of Hong Kong, who assisted most valuably in my field work in the New Territories\".\n\nMilne-Edwards & Milne Edwards : (see Milne-Edwards).\n\nLacking information about Edwards in the amphipod name Monoculodes edwardsi Holmes, 1905. Possibly it may be a tribute to the British entomologist Frederick Wallace Edwards, (28 Nov.) 1888-1940 (15 Nov.), at the British Museum (Nat. Hist.), where he worked on Diptera or a tribute to father or son Milne Edwards (q.v.).\n\nThe tapeworm name Acanthobothrium edwardsi Williams, 1969 from the spiral intestine of Raja fullonica is in honour of Mr. Bill Edwards, 19??-, at the Univ. of Aberdeen (the School of Biological Sciences), who helped Dr. Harford (Haffie) Williams (q.v.) with tapeworms.\n\nDouglas John Eernisse, 1955-, Associate Professor, Dept. of Biological Science, California State University, Fullerton. Working on molecular and morphological evolution of metazoans and as a Polyplacophoran specialist [Loricella eernissei Sirenko, 2008].\n\nThe cephalopod genus name Egea Joubin, 1933, may possibly be a tribute to Dr. Vilhelm Ege, 1887-1962 (8 July), Danish marine ichthyologist: (André Trombeta kindly provided this information).\n\nHans Egede, (31 Jan. - Harstad, Norway) 1686-1758 (5 Nov. - Falster , Denmark), Danish inuit missionary / naturalist, who collected (mainly botany) in Greenland, as made his son Poul Hansen Egede, (9 Sep. - Kabelvåg, Lofoten) 1708-1789 (6 June - Copenhagen), although their collections were unknown to Linnaeus. Hans Egede had been sent by the Danish king to Greenland in 1721, to mission and look for Norse survivors, because no effort had been made for more than 300 years to contact such inhabitants in Greenland. He did not find any Norse survivors, but inuits and started by learning about how the inuits lived and learning their language and established the town Gothaab, later known as Nuuk. Hans Egede returned to Denmark in 1736 with his family, except for his eldest son Poul, who had helped his father in his mission activities. Poul returned to Denmark eight years later. Hans Egede reported from his home trip from Greenland in 1834 that the crew of his ship on July 6 saw a giant \"sea serpent\" and later Hyperhydra egedei (Heuvelmans, 1954) (a cryptozoological name), a primitive extinct? whale was descrabed, honouring his name.\n\nThe German physician and micropalaeontologist Dr. Joseph Georg Egger, (24 Dec. - Kelheim) 1824-1913 (22 Mar. - München), published on foraminiferans between 1857-1909 [Eggerella Cushman, 1933].\n\nHenrik (Heinrich) Franz Alexander, Baron von Eggers, (4 Dec. - Schleswig) 1844-1903 (14 May - Leipzig), from Denmark, was a professional soldier and botanist, who became interested in botany when stationed at Virgin Island and after that collected much botany in e.g. Equador, where he lived between 1891-97 in his hacienda El Recreo. From the beginning his collection went to the botanist Eugen Warming (q.v.) in Denmark, but after a joint trip to the West Indies a brake between them appeared and after this his collections went to Berlin.\n\nDr. Jens Konrad Eggvin, (19 Aug. - Eggum, Lofoten) 1899-1989 (Bergen), Norwegian hydrographer, is honoured in the fish name Eumicrotremus eggvini Koefoed, 1956.\n\nThe marine gastropod name Alvania vanegmondi Hoenselaar & Goud, 1998 is named after Mr. J. van Egmond, 19??-, Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden, for his participation in the CANCAP-expedition for marine biological research in the Canarian-Cape Verdean region of the North Atlantic Ocean (1976-1986).\n\nThe coral names Cladopsammia eguchii (Wells, 1982), Eguchipsammia Cairns, 1994 and the stylasterid name Stylaster eguchii (Boschma, 1966) are likely not honouring Dr. Eisuke Eguchi, 1928-, at the Dep. of Biology, Yokohama,who has published on arthropod receptors, but more likely Prof. Dr. Motoki Eguchi, (21 Apr.) 1905-1978 (4 Mar.), who has published on reef-building corals.\n\nProf. Dr. Ernst Heinrich Ehlers, (11 Nov. - Lüneburg) 1835-1925 (31 Dec.), M.D. in Göttingen in 1861, having earlier studied marine life in Messina and Naples, he developed into a polychaetologist; professor of zoology in Erlangen (where his magnum opus \"Die Borstenwürmer\" arrived in 1864-68), from 1874 in Göttingen (but retireing in 1919), one of the godfathers of the laboratory in Helgoland (he had a summer home on this island) and on the whole very influential regarding the study of invertebrates, in Europe as well as in USA, from where several students were sent to him.

PhD in 1990. Editor of the key book series \"Danmarks Fauna\".\n\nThe diatom name Fragilaria eichhornii Witkowski & Lange-Bertalot in Witkowski, Lange-Bertalot & Witask is likely a tribute to the botanist Eugen Eichhorn, (7 Nov. - Richenburg (Böhmen)) 1878-1963 (30 Sep. - Regensburg).\n\nJohann Karl Eduard Ivanovich von Eichwald, (4 July - Mitau (later called Jelgava), Latvia) 1794-1876 (16 Nov. - St Petersburg), Russian geologist / palaentologist of German origin [Keratella eichwaldi (Levander, 1894)].\n\nThe Mediterranean shelf mysid name Heteromysis eideri Bacescu, 1941 is likely not named for a person, but for a boat: the Monaco Museum's small ship Eider. (Dr. D. Damkaer kindly suggested this connection).\n\nThe diatom name Navicula eidrigiana Carter, 1979 is not named for a person, but was found in Loch Eidrig, Scotland..\n\nThe German-born US Zoology Prof. (at the Indiana Univ.) Dr. Carl Henry Eigenmann, (9 Mar. - Flehingen, Germany) 1863-1927 (24 Apr. - San Diego, California), who was an ichthyologist trained by Jordan (q.v.), PhD in 1889, is honoured in the decapod name Troglocubanus eigenmanni (Hay, 1903).

He described pycnogonids, particularly and was the first naturalist to describe a ten-legged one. He very nearly participated on the U.S. Exploring Expedition. See Hedgpeth, Joel W. 1971. James Eights of the Antarctic (1798-1882). American Association for the Advancement of Science, Research in the Antarctic, p. 3-45 [Yoldia eightsi Couthouy in J. Jay, 1839]. (More). (Dr. D.

He had planned to return to Sweden some years after he had left, but he lost his small fortune a few years after his arrival to USA when an assurance company went bancrupt, so therefore he stayed in order to earn some more money. From the beginning he earned some money as an aquarel painter, but soon became involved in the fruit plantage business and discovered the possibility to grow Smyrna figs in California (and also was involved in the conservation efforts of Sequoia gigantea). During his last decades he lived in New York and was more involved in archaeological research than in biology, i.a. having been a specialist in antique glass.

Coan, California, kindly provided the date).\n\nProf. Dr. Sven Petrus Ekman, (31 May) 1876-1964 (2 Feb. - Upposala), professor of zoology in Uppsala; biogeographer [Siboglinum ekmani Jägersten, 1956, Ekmania Hansen & McKenzie, 1991, Paramphiascopsis ekmani Lang, 1965]. Several other Swedish persons named Ekman has connection with the sea, e.g. Prof. Vagn Walfrid Ekman, (3 May - Stockholm) 1874-1954 (9 Mar. - Gostad, Stockaryd, Sweden), who was professor in mechanics and mathematical physics in Lund and worked with hydrography and theoretical physical oceanography and is connected with the oceanographical terms \"Ekman spiral\" and \"Ekman layer\" (and also constructed hydrographical equipment, e.g. a current meter), Dr. Fredrik Gustaf Ekman, (29 Aug.) 1852-1930 (26 Feb.), who was distantly related to Walfrid (they shared a common ancestor during the 17:th century), industrialist (first technical manager of a sugar factory mainly owned by D Carnegie in Göteborg, later director of SSA in Göteborg), donator and hydrographical researcher (well-known for his friendship with the professor of chemistry in Uppsala / Stockholm Sven Otto Pettersson, (12 Feb.) 1848-1941 (16 Jan.), who is more famous for his hydrographical and oceanographical work than for his chemical and who also (together with C.G.J. Petersen (q.v.)) initiated (via the Swedish king Oscar II) the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which was founded in 1902. Otto was father of the oceanographer Hans Pettersson, (26 Aug. - Kålhuvudet, Marstrand, Sweden) 1888-1966 (25 Jan. - Göteborg), the leader of the Swedish Albatross circumnavigation in 1947-48), Prof. Fredrik Laurentz Ekman, (3 Oct. - Göteborg) 1830-1890 (1 Jan. - Stockholm), the son of a vicar in Foss, Bohuslän, Walfrid's father, chemist and hydrographer and professor at the technical University in Stockholm achieved his Ph.D. on a dissertation on Scandinavian marine algae in Uppsala in 1857 and is honoured by Areschoug in the algae species Dictyosiphon ekmanii Areschoug, 1875. Much about O. Pettersson, G. Ekman, their cooperators and antagonists may be found in Crawford & Svansson 2003. In one letter to Ekman from 1898, Pettersson e.g. is mentioning the relation to his colleagues Cleve (q.v.) and C. Aurivillius (q.v.) as driving two horses, of which the first only would bolt, the other sit down on its hind legs or kick behind. Pettersson was the instigator of the Stockholm conference in June 1899 (helped by e.g. Cleve (q.v.), G. Ekman and Trybom (q.v.)) which resulted in the start of ICES (International Council for Exploration of the Seas) in 1902. Pettersson had only kind things to say about Herwig (q.v.), but had several doubts regarding P.P.C. Hoek (q.v.). \"He is tough. Give him only whiskey in the evening and good food. Tha's all\". According to Petterson, was Garstang (q.v.) a \"good fellow\", maybe partly because Garstang was considered to be an \"enemy\" of Archer and Hoek. In 1907 Pettersson and Nansen (q.v.) quarreled about the reasons why surface water in polar areas became sinking deep water, but after some years they were friends again. The young K.A. Andersson (q.v.), who was inspector of western Swedish Fisheries, had in 1914 succeded Trybom (q.v.) as a member of SHBK (Swedisch Hydrographical and Biological Commission), but not as a member of ICES (where G. Ekman together with O. Pettersson became Swedish members, thus two hydrographers, who continued to serve there until 1930 when Ekman died and also Pettersson resigned, after which one Swedish fisheries biologist (K.A. Andersson) and one hydrographer (O. Pettersson's son Hans) became new members and worked well together). Andersson wished from the beginning to abandon SHBK and instead constitute a Swedish central fisheries authority, under which fisheries research as well as hydrographical research should sort, which Pettersson and G. Ekman did not like. A first step became the establishment of a new sea fisheries laboratory, which bacame a part of SHBK and placed in Lysekil close to Pettersson's Bornö in the Gullmar Fjord, not in Gothenburg as Andersson had wished. This of course was a victory for Pettersson, who had found the place where it was built and was used from 1 July 1929. However, Andersson did not give up, and in 1948 SHBK was abandoned and the the laboratory in Lysekil became subordinated the Fisheries Board of Sweden. After O. Pettrerssons wife Agnes had died in February 1929 and G. Ekman had died in 1930, his sorrow for this and Andersson's opposite opinions was mildred when his son Hans achieved the first professorship in Oceanography in Göteborg.30 May 1930 after having done research on radioactivity during most time of his career. In 1939 a new building for H. Pettersson's institution was finished at Stigbergstorget in Göteborg, which was in use almost to the break of the new millennium. O. Pettersson reached rather high age despite almost constant worry already as relatively young about his throat, expressed e.g. in a letter from Europe to a friend, that he was sorry for not obeying his physicians advice to stay indoors in his home. (His physician in Lysekil, Dr. Carl Adolf Riber Blume (born 1869) was himself a bit peculiar, regularly ordinating most of his patients - irrespective of their suffering - a large spoonful of brandy for strictly medical purposes, while he himself could use several spoons of this medication because beeing their doctor, who needed to be in full health whenever his patients needed him. Thus he had a reputation of beeing a good physician, who not always was completely sober. One (true or false?) story tells about Blume beeing called to a seriously ill old man on an island close to Lysekil. When he arrived during the evening he stumbled in the darkness into the cottage and fell down close to the patient but found a wrist, felt a pulse and soon delivered the diagnosis \"gubben e full\" meaning \"the old man is drunk\", which was completely true, because he had happened to find his own wrist, but it was not the correct patient and Blume came from a long working day, so he had probably needed rather much medicine before this visit).\n\nEkström : (see von Wright).\n\nThe amphipod name Stenopleustes eldingi Gurjanova, 1930 is likely not a tribute to a person's name, but to the Russian ship Elding, which e.g. took samples in the Barents and Kara Sea during 1925 (and also taking samples in 1927).\n\nThe gastropod name Conus eldredi Morrison, 1955, is likely a tribute to his parents, because the author was born Eldred before beeing adopted (see Morrison).\n\nDr. Lucius G.

This can not have much to do with an Indo-Pacific species, but the name Eridan have been used for several ships and boats, so possibly the boat used to catch the coral may have been named so?

Scott, 1906 after him, but right away noted that this name had been used for a spider, so in the same year changed it to Evansula T. Scott, 1906. The polyclad name Notoplana evansii Laidlaw, 1903., however, is likely instead in honour of another namesake, Arthur Humble Evans, (23 Feb. - Seremerston, Northumberland) 1855-1943 (28 Mar. - Crowthorne, Bucks.), who published on birds in the Cambridge Natural History.

He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and was later Professor of Natural History there. For a short time ca. 1887, he was scientific director of the Fishery Board for Scotland. In that time, a copepod, Cyclops ewarti Brady, 1888, was named for him. The specimens were collected in 1887 by Thomas Scott from a decidedly marine part of the Firth of Forth and described by Brady the following year, but the genus is usually limnic and most other findings of this species has been from purely fresh water. (Dr. David Damkaer kindly provided this information).\n\nThe monoplacophoran name Vema ewingi Clarke & Menzies, 1959 is not likely honouring the naturalist Sir James Alfred Ewing, (27 Mar. - Dundee) 1855-1935 (17 Jan.), but much more likely the US geophysicist William Maurice Ewing, (12 May - Lockeney, Texas) 1906-1974 (4 May - Galveston, Texas), who i.a. published together with the authors of the species. He worked on ocean basins and sediments and developed or improved several tools for sampling in the sea. The pilargidae name Synelmis ewingi Wolf, 1986 is likely in honour of R.

Smith, 1959. His official collecting during expeditions seems to have been botanical specimens; he apparently collected the mollusks for himself. He spent over 20 summers in Alaska and Russia (including Kamchatka and Lake Baikal), and other expeditions include: Haiti (1927), the Solomon Islands (1929-1930, with the Whitney South Pacific Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, New York), and Chile (1939, 1957, 1959).

Milne Edwards, 1830 (\"trouvé dans la mer des Indes par M. Fabré\") must refer to the French naval liutenant Théodore Fabré, 1795-1830, commanding the Corvette \"La Chevrette\", which sailed the Bay of Bengal (in order to map the coastlines) in 1827-28 and touched the Sunda Isles and collected much material also thanks to the chief surgeon Dr. Auguste Adolphe Marc Reynaud, (7 May - Toulon) 1804-18??, and other officers.\n\nThe prolecithophoran name Plagiostomum fabrei Fuhrmann, 1898 may likely be a tribute to the French entomologist Dr. Jean-Henri Casimir Fabre, (21 Dec. - Saint-Léons, Aveyron) 1823-1915 (10 Oct. - Harmas de Sérignan), mentioned as \"the insect's Homer\" by Victor Hugo, but he was not only an entomologist, but had e.g. also studied mathemathics and was author of several French School books on different items. While living in Corsica from the end of the 1840s to 1853, he met the botanist Esprit Requien, who idtroduced him to botany and malacology and also introduced him to Moquin-Tandon (q.v.), who became his friend.\n\nProf. Johan(n) Christian Fabricius, (7 Jan. - Tønder, Schleswig) 1745-1808 (3 Mar. - Kiel), the son of a physician by the same name, was a Danish disciple of Linnaeus in Uppsala (1762-69), to whom he had come together with his childhood friend and relative Johan Zoëga (q.v.), and became a close friend of Linnaeus. He was also a distant relative of Otto Fabricius (q.v.) according to the Danish biology historian T. Wolff, but perhaps not very distant, because O. Fabricius' parental grandfather was a blacksmith and took the family name therefore; however, they may have been related in another way than the parental, or, when O. Fabricius' grandfather took his name, several relatives may have taken the same name, but most likely is that their fathers were cousins and in that case they must have been second cousins. Thereafter J.C. Fabricius mainly worked in København (Copenhagen) as professor extraordinarius - but went to London during summers to work on collections of British collectors (Banks, Hunter, Drury). From 1771 he achieved a professorship and educated in Kiel, which during this time belonged to Denmark. Also during his Kiel period he spent summers in London or Paris. In 1778 he traveled in Norway and published the following year his \"Reise nach Norwegen\". He worked on arthropods and was the leading specialist on insects, albeit he also wrote single articles about other animals. The amphipod Cystisoma fabricii Stebbing, 1888 may possibly be named after him, as well as the halacarid Copidognathus fabricii (Lohmann, 1889) and likely the stomatopod Oratosquilla fabricii (Holthuis, 1941) {another picture}.\n\nProf. Dr. h.c. Otto (Otho) Fabricius, (6 Mar. - Rudkjøbing) 1744-1822 (20 May - Christianshavn), Danish Arctic naturalist on West Greenland, eskimo missonary and zoologist. His father was also a priest and the fathers conversations with Hans Egede, (31 Jan. - Harstad, Norway) 1686-1758 (5 Nov. - Falster, Denmark), the \"Greenland apostle\", who in vain had been looking for Viking survivors in Greenland, but instead found inuits for which he started missioning and also founded the Greenland capitol Godthåb or Nuuk and had got Otto's mind into his future mission in Greenland, to walk in Egede's footsteps. Otto's parental grandfather had been a blacksmith, therefore his family nama: Lat. fabricius = smith. His parents were both in their second marriage, when Otto was born and his mother Else Catherine née Ursin, was 20 years younger than her husband Hans. Otto had an older half brother Christen, who also became a priest and had been a missionary at Greenland during 5 years before Otto arrived there (and he may have had 2 older half sisters as well). Otto lived in a primitive eskimo camp during five and a half year from 1768 on. He made his observations helped only by a kayak, a cup and some bivalve shells used as bowls, a few hand hold lenses and Linnaeus's Systema Naturae; later he was appointed professor of theology and titulary bishop; most well-known for his \"Fauna Groenlandica\" from 1780, but he also published a Greenlandic lexicon and a grammar. He corresponded much with his friend O.F. Müller (q.v.) and became on Müller's suggestion member of the Scientific Society in 1780, but after his return from Greenland to Denmark, his main occupations were religious, as a priest in Christianshavn (after having served as a priest in Drangedal and Tørrisdal, Nedre Telemark, Norway between 1775-78); his interests for natural science were however kept strong from his childhood until he died. He had married in 1780, but became a widower in 1785 and remarried in 1786. His second wife survived him for 12 years.

He achieved his PhD on nephridia of polychaetes in 1906, after which he was appointed naturalist to the fisheries service of France at the laboratory of Banyuls-sur-Mer, where he remained for 14 years, working on i.a. gobid taxonomy, maritime spiders, plankton, speleology etc. In 1920 he joined the the staff of the zoology department of the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris and in 1938 he succeded Charles Gravier as professor and director of this department. Together with Chevreux he wrote the amphipod part of \"Faune de France\", published in 1925 and he also worked with e.g. ellobiopsids and some other crustacean associates. Being a widower for 3 years, he eventually died in his daughters home in Dijon [Fagesia Delphy, 1938, Thalassomyces fagei (Boschma, 1948), Cumopsis fagei Bacescu, 1956, Mesonerilla fagei Swedmark, 1959, Loxosomella fagei Bobin & Prenant, 1953, Fageapseudes Bacescu & Gutu, 1971, Coronellina fagei (Gautier, 1962), Heterostigma fagei Monniot & Monniot, 1961].\n\nThe amphipod name Ampelisca fageri Dickinson, 1982 may possibly honour Prof. Edward William Fager, (2 Apr. - Monterey Park, Cal.) 1917-1976 (4 Nov., La Jolla, Cal.), professor of marine ecology at the Univ. of California.\n\nMons. Jacques Sébastien François Léonce Marie Paul Fagot, 1842-1908, of Villafranche-Lauraguais, France, was a malacologist [Fagotia Bourguignat, 1884].\n\nThe copepod name Diarthrodes fahrenbachi Bodin, 1967 must be a tribute to Dr. Wolf Heinrich (Henner) Fahrenbach, (Berlin) 1932-, Department of Anatomy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, later Laboratory of Electron Microscopy, Oregon Regional Primate Research Center, Beaverton, Oregon.\n\nThe decapod name Galathea faiali Nunes-Ruivi, 1961 is likely not named for a person, but for the island Faial in the Azores. (André Trombeta kindly provided this suggestion).\n\nThe gastropod name Pteropurpura fairiana R. Houart, 1979 is likely a tribute to Ruth H. Fair, 1???-1978, who was a specialist in Muricidae and published on such gastropods and others in Honolulu.\n\nLacking information about Fairchild in the polyplacophoran name Leptochiton fairchildi Ch. Hedley & Hull, 1929. Possibly the dipterologist Alexander Graham Bell \"Sandy\" Fairchild, (Washington, D.C.) 1906-1994, (a grandson of the famous inventor Alexander Graham Bell), may be the honoured person? or perhaps his father David Grandison Fairchild, (7 Apr. - Lansing, Michigan) 1869-1954 (6 Aug.), US botanist, who supervised the introduction of many useful plants in his home country and in 1905 had married Marian Bell, daughter of the inventor. A bivale, Cuspidaria fairchildi Suter, 1908 was however collected in Brazil by a certain G.B. Fairchild, who must have been the dipterologist above, and the New Zealand ray Torpedo fairchildi Hutton, 1872 was collected at Napier, in 1868 by Captain John Fairchild, (Prince Edward Island, but son of a Devonshire farmer) 1834-1898 (accidentally killed, at age 64, when a shackle broke aloft and struck him a fatal blow), of the steamer Luna.

Fancher Sawin (q.v.). (David Hollombe, Los Angeles, kindly provided this information).\n\nThe copepod name Pseudanthessius faouzii Steuer, 1940 is likely in honour of Dr. (later Prof.) Hussein Faouzi, (Cairo) 1900-1988 (Cairo), who took part in the Mabahiss expedition in 1933-34 and later together with Dr. Mohamed founded the Department of Oceanography in Egypt.\n\nThe copepod name Mesocletodes farauni Por, 1967 is likely not honouring a person, but is referring to a place, most likely the Egyptian Faraun island (Geziret el-Faraun), Farao's island, close to Eilat in the Red Sea.\n\nProf. Dr. Isabel (Isa) Canet Perez Farfante (married name Canet), (24 July - Havana) 1916-2009 (20 Aig.), Cuban zoologist, who was born at Cuba after her parents having moved from Spain to Cuba (and partly got her education in Spain - but was forced to leave Spain when Franco took power there), who in her early days worked on foraminiferans and molluscs, later turning to crustacean research, where especially peneids became her special interest. She had earned her PhD at Harvard Univ. in 1948. She worked mainly in Cuba until the 1960s (in 1957 University of Havana, Cuba), when she and her family moved to USA, where she worked until her retirement in 1986 [Bartschia canetae (Clench & Aguayo, 1944), Farfantepenaeus Burukovsky, 1972].\n\nThe gastropod names Vermicularia fargoi Olsson, 1951 and Cryoturris fargoi McGinty, 1955 are likely tributes to William Gilbert Fargo, (6 Dec. - Jackson, Michigan) 1867-1957 (2 Feb. - Pass-a-Grille beach, Florida), US hobby malacologist and ornithologist, who was a civil engineer from Michigan, but moved at his early retirement in 1925 to Florida, where he continued to collect in the St. Petersburg area partly together with C.R. Locklin (q.v.), who spent much time in the St. Petersburg area.\n\nManzonia fariai Rolan & Fernandes, 1990 was named for Mr. Carlos Mar de Bettencourt Faria, (13 Feb. - Lisboa) 1924-1976 (4 July (brutally assasinated)), Portuguese amateur astronomer in Angola, who founded the Observatoirio Astronomico de Mulemba in 1956. When he was a teenager, he lived at Madeira with an uncle, who - as an amateur - was much interested in astronomy, radio and marine biology and much influenced his nephew.

Farmer, (13 Oct. - Long Beach, California) 1933-, US Pacific opisthobranch researcher from San Diego, who at least has published since the 1960s. (Dr. Riccardo Giannuzzi-Savelli kindly provided the birth date).\n\nDr. Farran of Dublin, \"a gentleman well known for his love of natural history, and for his fine collection of Irish shells. To him we are indebted for the opportunity of procuring this and two other new species of Irish Nudibranchs dredged during a little excursion to Malahide in August 1843\". The note above regards Eubranchus farrani (Alder & Hancock, 1844). Evidently this person was Dr. Charles Farran, ca 1790-1861 (29 June - Feltrim, Malahide, county Dublin), who was a physician (being son of an attorney, James Farran), who had entered the Trinity College in Dublin, aged 16 in 1806, practised at Stradbally, Kilmacthomas (county Waterford) in 1846 and later in Malahide. He was also a historian in Irish botany and knew William McCalla (q.v.) and also collected plants, including marine algae, Another person with the same family name lived during the same time, but they do not seem to be closely related, namely George Farran, (9 July) 1799-1876 (22 May), who in November 1829 married Elizabeth Caroline Chomley, 18??-1898, both from Dublin. One of their sons was Edmond Chomley Farran, (27 Aug. - Belcamp) 1847-1881 (25 Sep. - Halliford, Middlesex), married to Ann Hume, 1843-1910 and was the only one among 7 siblings, who used the mother's name \"Chomley\" as a middle name. In 1895 an exact namesake published a note about a terrestrial isopod in Ir. Nat. (and in 1907 he published The Game Laws of Ireland, Dublin). Possibly, thus, these works may have been posthumously published and if so, likely communicated by his son. The son of E.C. Farran, George Philip (Ryan) Farran, (21 Nov. - Templeogue, Co. Dublin) 1876-1949 (5 Jan. - Knocklyon, Templeogue, Dublin), became an Irish (Dublin) copepod taxonomist (and working on other pelagical taxa as well). B.A. degree in Dublin University in 1899, worked in the National Museum and in the Royal Dublin Society's Fishery Survey. In 1901 he was appointed Assistant Naturalist in the Fisheries Branch of the Government service. In 1910 he became Inspector and in 1938 Chief Inspector, retiring in 1946 [Mysidetes farrani (Holt & Tattersall, 1905), Laophonte farrani Roe, 1958, Euaugaptilus farrani G.O. Sars, 1920, Amallothrix farrani Rose, 1942, Scopalatum farrani Roe, 1975, Neoscolecithrix farrani Smirnov, 1935]. G.P. Farran had a son named Chomley after G.P. Farran's grandmothers family name. G.P. Farran's mother was Anne Hume Ryan. (Pennie Hammond kindly provided some of this information, but the clue to whom was the Dr. Farran in the Eubranchus farrani name, was kindly given by Dr. E. Charles Nelson, Hon. Editor of Archives of Natural History, who admitted that he named the garden flower Dianthus \"Chomley Farran\" , which must honour G..P. Farran's father,).\n\nDr. Arthur Farre, (6 Mar.) 1811-1887 (17 Dec. - London), British obstetrician, who described the bryozoan species Farrella Ehrenberg, 1838 repens (Farre, 1837) using the genus name Lagenella, which already had been uses for a genus of ciliates [Farrea Bowerbank, 1862]. He was the founder af the Royal Microscopical Society and beside his professional interests and interest in marine science as an amateur, he was a keen photographer and very interested in music.\n\nThe bivalve name Chlamys farreri (Jones & Preston, 1904) of this economically important Far East species, is likely honouring the British plant collector Reginald John Farrer, (Clapham, North Yorkshire) 1880-1920 (17 Oct. - China), who after studies in Oxford in 1902 entered his first expedition to Korea, China and Japan, staying there for 8 months. Several plant species are also named for him.\n\nFasmer : (see Mortensen).\n\nLacking information about Fattah in the Indian Ocean penaeid name Hymenopenaeus fattahi Ramadan, 1938.\n\nJohn Fatu, (28 Feb.) 1943-, US malacologist (Jacksonville Shell Club member) at Tonga, is honoured in the gastropod name Haliotis fatui Geiger, 1999.\n\nDr. Anno Faubel, 1942-, German platyhelminth (Macrostomida, Acoela) researcher, active from the 1970s onwards [Copidognathus faubeli Bartsch, 1986, Gieysztoria faubeli Artois, Willems, De Roeck, Jocque, & Brendonck, 2005].\n\nDr. Kristian Fauchald, 1934-, polychaetologist, born and educated in Norway, but moved during the early 1970s to USA.

Pieter Faure from 1898 to 1906. This ship was a Scottish built steam-trawler purchased by the Government of the Cape Colony in 1897, to assist with the first Marine Biological Survey, possibly named for Sir Pieter Hendrik Faure, (3 Nov.) 1858-1937 (8 Dec.), a cabinet minister in Cecil Rhodes’s government. Also the Genus name Pieterfaurea Verseveldt & Bayer, 1988 (Octocorallia, Nidaliidae) must also be named for this ship, which John D.F. Gilchrist (q.v.) brought out to South Africa in order to conduct research on fishing potential of South African waters. Another possibility for the name of this ship may have been honouring of David Pieter Faure, (11 Nov. - Stellenbosch) 1842-1916 (17 Aug. - Camps Bay, Cape Town), (fell ill and resigned in 1897), South African Unitarian Minister.\n\nLacking information about Fauré in the medusa name Gossea faureae J.

He published several papers dealing with ethnography, archaeology and geology of the Obock area and Kamaran Island (1886-1888). A more general report concerning that expedition appeared in 1888: Rapport sur une Mission dans la Mer Rouge et le Golfe d'Aden (octobre 1885 à mars 1886). Archives de Zoologie Expérimentale et Générale, 2e Série, vol. 6: 117-122. During this mission he collected among others also zoological and botanical specimens, which were deposited in the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, France. For his explorations in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Tadjoura he was awarded the prestigious \"Prix Savigny\" in 1891. He was a life-time member of the \"Société Zoologique de France\" and in 1894 he was president of this society. About 20 taxa, all from the Obock area, were named after him.
