The last thirty-five million years of Earth history are wonderfully, if not always perfectly, chronicled by a succession of fossil assemblages extending from New Jersey to Florida. Having this record available is one thing, but interpreting it is quite another. In order to make sense of the changing geography, the comings and goings of ecosystems and species, and the controls that climate exercises on living things, we need a descriptive framework in which all the fossil-bearing formations and their contents are neatly classified in units of time and space. This is what Petuch provides for the eastern United States in this book. Petuch lays the groundwork for those who want to study evolution and extinction within specific communities. It will now be possible to carry out comparative studies within ecosystems — coral-dominated reefs, lagoon-bottom associations dominated by scallops or by suspension-feeding turritellid gastropods, and communities of mangroves and estuaries, and to evaluate how different community types were affected by changes in geography and climate. In short, the descriptive foundation allows us to view events in the history of life in the specific environmental and biotic contexts in which evolution, invasion, and extinction take place.\n\nThere are no apples and oranges in the fossil record, but the present book will stimulate the kind of research in which metaphorical apples and oranges will no longer be confused. We shall all benefit from the fruits of Petuch’s pioneering effort.\n\nGeerat J. Vermeij, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of California-Davis\n\nPreface\n\nThe coastal waters of Recent eastern North America, from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Florida Keys and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, contain some of the richest marine faunas found anywhere on Earth. As a marine biologist, I was always fascinated by the seemingly endless array of organisms and communities that exists along this area; from the Arctic faunas of the north, to the cool-temperate ecosystems of the mid-Atlantic United States, south to the warm-temperate faunas of the Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern United States and the tropical coral reef environments of southern Florida. While studying these modern faunas as an undergraduate and graduate student, I was impressed by the sharply-defined biogeographical patterns of the coastal communities but was also puzzled by the presence of seemingly anomalous faunal components in many of these ecosystems. A whole new view of this modern marine world was revealed to me during my doctoral and postdoctoral research, when I began to study the Cenozoic fossil record of the eastern North American coast. Slowly and painstakingly, as I collected data in fossil beds from Maryland to Florida, the questions engendered by these anomalous modern faunal components and biogeographical patterns began to be answered. Instead of viewing coastal marine communities in a present-day three-dimensional spatial system, I was now able to see them in a four-dimensional context, with a time component that spanned over 35 million years. The sheer magnificence and beauty of the history of these organisms and their communities immediately converted me to a new academic discipline, coastal paleoceanography. This book is a result of that conversion. Having specialized in marine malacology, I always view modern and ancient oceans in the context of molluscan systematics and ecology. While investigating the Cenozoic fossil beds of the East Coast, I was delighted to find that the vast majority of well-preserved organisms were mollusks; mostly bivalves and gastropods. This overwhelming abundance of mollusks is actually a boon for paleoceanographers and paleoecologists, as both classes have been shown to give great insight into ancient marine physical parameters. Since most marine mollusks are physiologically tightly constrained by water temperature, depth, substrate, and salinities, their presence or absence can be used to reconstruct the physiographic and biogeographic patterns of ancient seas. In this book, I describe the physical and biological oceanography of seven separate eastern North American paleoseas, covering a time frame that extends from the early Oligocene to the Holocene. Depending on sea level fluctuations, the basins of these paleoseas periodically flooded and dried, resulting in the formation of 34 separate subseas. Fascinatingly, each of these subseas contained its own set of endemic organisms and communities, some being among the most bizarre and beautiful that have ever evolved on our planet. As a way of classifying the biotic and ecological patterns of these subseas, I have named and described over 120 separate marine communities. Unlike descriptions of modern marine ecosystems, where the community is named after the dominant primary producer, these paleocommunities are named after the most prominent fossil organism. Since most primary producers do not fossilize, these index paleospecies are used as proxies or indicators of the entire community. As an artifact of the preservation of the fossil record, my catalog of paleocommunities is highly skewed toward the hard-skeletoned mollusca and scleractinia. These community descriptions are meant to be only\n\nbrief, thumbnail sketches that emphasize the largest and most prominent organisms in as many trophic levels as possible. While mapping the distribution of the fossil communities over time, I was able to gain insight into the approximate configurations and sizes of the paleoseas, subseas, and coastlines. To my amazement, many of these lost coastal seas extended far inland and covered large areas of what are now the mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States and sprawling urban centers. Putting things in perspective, it is fascinating to imagine that Richmond, Virginia was once the shoreline of a large, scallop-filled sea, that Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Naples, Florida were once the edge of a giant coral reef complex similar to Kwajalein or Eniwetok Atolls, or that Beluga Whales once swam in Lake Champlain. What is equally fascinating is the constant turnover of marine communities in the seven paleoseas, with well-established faunas being almost instantaneously decimated and quickly replaced by newly-evolved faunas. This flickering spectrum of constantly-changing communities and species is one of the most beautiful images that emerges from the history of these ancient marine worlds. It is also one of the more horrific, as it reflects the environmental catastrophies and sea level fluctuations that occurred on such a regular basis throughout the Cenozoic. I have tried to capture some of these images in this book, primarily to shed light onto cyclical patterns of evolution, extinction, and community replacement in the American seas. Hopefully, this information will be of predictive value, allowing insights into present and future patterns of global warming and cooling. It should be remembered that we too are part of the biotic continuum and that the modern coastal areas of eastern North America will someday be the paleoseas of a future world.\n\nEdward J.

Petuch was born in Bethesda, Maryland in 1949. Being raised in a Navy family, he spent many of his childhood years collecting living and fossil shells in such varied localities as California, Puerto Rico, Chesapeake Bay, and Wisconsin. His early interests in paleontology and marine biology eventually led to B.A. and M.S. degrees in Zoology from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. While in Wisconsin, his thesis work concentrated on the molluscan biogeography of coastal West Africa. There he traveled extensively in Morocco, Western Sahara, Senegal, Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Cameroons. Continuing his education, Petuch studied marine biogeography under Gilbert Voss at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, University of Miami. During that time, his dissertation work involved intensive collecting and working on shrimp boats in Colombia, Venezuela, Barbados, the Grenadines, and Brazil. After receiving his Ph.D. in Oceanography in 1980, Petuch undertook two years of postdoctoral research on paleoecology with Geerat Vermeij at the University of Maryland. There, he also held a research associateship with the Department of Paleobiology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution and conducted intensive field work on the Plio-Pleistocene fossil beds of Florida and the Miocene of Maryland. Petuch has also collected fossil and living mollusks in Australia, Papua-New Guinea, Fijis, French Polynesia, Japan, the Mediterranean coasts of North Africa and Europe, the Bahamas, Mexico, Belize, Nicaragua, and Uruguay. This research has led to the publication of almost 100 papers. His seven previous books, Atlas of Living Olive Shells of the World (with Dennis Sargent), New Caribbean Molluscan Faunas, Neogene History of Tropical American Mollusks, Field Guide to the Ecphoras, Edge of the Fossil Sea, Atlas of Florida Fossil Shells, and Coastal Paleoceanography of Eastern North America are well-known reference texts within the malacological and paleontological communities. Presently, Petuch is a Professor of Geology at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida. He resides in Lake Worth, Florida with his wife Linda and three children, Eric, Brian, and Jennifer. When not collecting or studying mollusks, Petuch leads an active career as a musician and member of the university-affiliated Cuvier Trio, playing the recorders and harpsichord and specializing in Baroque and Renaissance music.\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America Table of Contents Chapter 1.

Paleoseas of Cenozoic Eastern North America\n\nThe Atlantic Coastal Plain and Gulf Coastal Plain regions of the eastern United States have long been known to contain vast, thick Cenozoic marine deposits. Being on the trailing edge of the North American Plate, the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plains have been almost continuously subject to structural downwarping, making them particularly sensitive to sea level fluctuations. This has allowed for the preservation of a virtually complete eustatic history of the area, a feature that is generally lost along leading plate edges. The sediments that accumulated along these downwarped, flooded continental margins also contain some of the richest and best preserved marine fossil beds found anywhere on Earth, enabling unprecedented insights into both the ancient marine ecosystems and the paleoceanography of the regions. Unlike other trailing plate edges elsewhere, several large, open-ended basins formed along the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plains during the late Cenozoic (OligocenePleistocene). These pericontinental basins were separated from each other by wide structural arches that had formed either during the Appalachian Orogeny or during some subsequent local reactivation or faulting event. Although traditionally referred to by geologists as “embayments” (Gibson, 1983; Ward, 1992), these pericontinental systems were far more complex than simple bays and represented true seas in the strict oceanographic sense. Like all seas, they were bodies of salt water, they were structurally bound on at least three sides, they occupied geologically discrete basins, they each contained their own distinct configurations of currents and water masses, and they contained their own distinctive endemic organisms and ecosystems. In this book, these late Cenozoic “embayments” will be accorded full paleosea status. Depending on overall depth, geomorphological configuration, and rate of sedimentary infilling from deltas, each paleosea exhibited its own pattern of eustatic fluctuations and number of marine transgressive intervals. In the time interval from the early Oligocene to the late Pleistocene, some paleoseas had as many as ten large transgressive intervals, while others had as few as four. Some of the longer-lived paleoseas existed throughout this entire time, while others existed for only one or two epochs. In accordance with the standard paleoceanographic nomenclature used for epicontinental seas (Sloss, 1963), I here refer to the unconformity-bound transgressive intervals of marginal paleoseas as “subseas.” These pericontinental subseas differed from epicontinental subseas in that they were influenced primarily by eustatic fluctuations and not by tectonics or orogeny. As presently understood, the eastern North American paleoseas are divided into two distinct basinal groups, encompassing the Gulf basins and the Atlantic basins (Ward, 1985). Sedimentary deposition within these two groups differs greatly, with the Atlantic basins characteristically having thin marine transgressive units that are separated by numerous regressive unconformities and with the Gulf basins having much thicker, faster-growing units that are separated by fewer unconformities. These differences in sedimentary deposition reflect the erosional patterns of the Appalachian Mountains during the Neogene, when the bulk of the sediments was being deposited in the south and when giant deltaic environments existed along Alabama, northern Florida, and Georgia. In this\n\n2\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nbook, each separate marine sedimentary unit is considered to be a sea floor, or series of sea floors, within an individual subsea.\n\nGeochronology and Geography of the Eastern American Paleoseas By the beginning of the Oligocene, the eastern Gulf basinal systems contained only two paleoseas; the northern Choctaw Sea and the southern Okeechobean Sea. The Atlantic basinal systems were more complex and contained four paleoseas; the southern Charleston Sea, the central Albemarle Sea and Salisbury Sea, and the northern Raritan Sea. Included within the scope of this book, but not occupying a true structural basin, is a seventh paleosea, the far northern Champlain Sea. Formed by flooding due to isostatic depression caused by the great Wisconsinan continental ice sheet, the Champlain Sea was the only paleosea that was not eustatically controlled. Detailed overviews of the geomorphology, oceanography, and ecology of these seas and their subseas are given in the following chapters. The geochronology of the five main paleoseas, and their subsea intervals, is shown on Tables 1 and 2.\n\nThe Choctaw Sea Named for the Choctawhatchee (“Choctaw River”) of northern Florida, this northeastern Gulf sea occupied a large area of the present-day Florida Panhandle, including the Choctawhatchee, Apalachicola, and Ochlockonee River deltas, and extended as far west as Okaloosa County and as far east as Taylor County. In its greatest development, the Choctaw Sea also extended inland as far north as Bainbridge, Georgia (Figures 1, 3, and 5). Existing from the Rupelian Oligocene to the latest Piacenzian Pliocene, the Choctaw Sea encompassed six separate subseas. Based upon their marine faunas, these subseas can be further subdivided into two groups; the early subseas (Rupelian Oligocene to Serravallian Miocene; see Chapters 3 and 4) and the late subseas (Tortonian Miocene to Piacenzian Pliocene; see Chapters 5 and 6). Of the early subseas, the oldest, the Bainbridge Subsea (named for the fossil beds at Bainbridge, Georgia), existed during the early part of the Oligocene, from the Rupelian to the earliest Chattian Ages, and spanned the Suwannee Strait between Georgia and Florida (Figure 1). The Choctaw Sea basin dried out for most of the Chattian Age, but reflooded in the latest Chattian as the much smaller Chattahoochee Subsea (named for the Chattahoochee Formation of the Florida Panhandle). During Chattahoochee time, the Suwannee Strait closed off completely and Georgia connected to Florida as a single peninsula. By the early Aquitanian Miocene, this subsea disappeared and the basin remained dry until the beginning of the Burdigalian Miocene. At this time, the Chipola Subsea (named for the Chipola Formation of the Florida Panhandle and previously referred to as the “Chipola Sea” (Petuch, 1997)) flooded the area and persisted until the end of the Langhian Miocene (Figure 3). After a short regressive period during the earliest Serravallian Miocene, the basin was reflooded during the early Serravallian Miocene to produce the first of the late subseas, the Walton Subsea (named for the fossil beds in Walton County, Florida Panhandle). The early Tortonian Age of the Miocene saw another regressive dry time within the Choctaw Sea basin. By the mid-Tortonian, however, a fifth transgressive flooding event produced the Alaqua Subsea (named for the fossil beds along Alaqua Creek, Walton County, Florida Panhandle). This subsea persisted until the mid-Messinian Miocene, when a major regressive period occurred. The basin remained dry throughout the late Messinian and the entire Zanclean Pliocene, only to be flooded in the Piacenzian Pliocene for a sixth and final time. This subsea, the Jackson Subsea (named for the Jackson Bluff Formation of the Florida Panhandle), was previously referred to as the “Jackson Sea” (Petuch, 1997) and existed only until the late Piacenzian Pliocene (Figure 5). For detailed discussions of the individual geo-\n\nChapter one, Paleoseas of Cenozoic Eastern North America\n\nTable 1.

The longest-lived of all the eastern American paleoseas, the Okeechobean Sea existed from the early Oligocene to the late Pleistocene and encompassed eleven separate subseas. Like the Choctaw Sea, the Okeechobean Sea subseas can be subdivided into two groups, based upon their marine faunas; in this case, the early subseas (Rupelian Oligocene to Messinian Miocene; see Chapter 5) and the late subseas (Zanclean Pliocene to Sangamonian Pleistocene; see Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9). The oldest of the early subseas, the Dade Subsea (named for the fossil reefs in Dade County, Florida), represented the incipiency of the Okeechobean Sea and was contemporaneous with the Bainbridge Subsea of the Choctaw Sea (Rupelian-earliest Chattian Oligocene) (Figure 1). The Okeechobean Sea basin was emergent throughout most of the Chattian Age, flooding in the latest Chattian and developing into the Tampa Subsea (named for the fossil beds at Tampa, Florida). Contemporaneous with the Chattahoochee Subsea of the Choctaw Sea, the Tampa Subsea persisted into the early Aquitanian Miocene but dried out after that and remained emergent for the rest of the Aquitanian Age. The beginning of the Burdigalian Miocene saw the reflooding of the Okeechobean Sea basin and the establishment of the Arcadia Subsea (named for the Arcadia Formation of southern Florida). This subsea persisted until the Langhian-Serravallian boundary and was the exact contemporary of the Chipola Subsea. A short emergent interval during the early Serravallian Miocene gave way to a major transgressive flooding that ranged from the early Serravallian to the early Tortonian Miocene and produced the Polk Subsea (named for the fossil beds in Polk County, Florida). This subsea was contemporaneous with the Walton Subsea of the Choctaw Sea. After a short regressive period during the early to mid-Tortonian, the last of the early subseas, the Charlotte Subsea (named for the fossil beds in Charlotte County, Florida) flooded the area. This subsea was contemporaneous with both the Alaqua Subsea of the Choctaw Sea. During the late Messinian Miocene, a major regression took place and the entire Okeechobean Sea basin was emergent. This was followed by a brief transgressional period during the early Zanclean Pliocene, producing the short-lived Murdock Subsea (named for the Murdock Station Formation of southwestern Florida). By late Zanclean time, the Okeechobean Sea basin was again emergent. This was soon reversed by a major transgressive event in the early Piacenzian Pliocene, establishing the large and complex Tamiami Subsea (named for the Tamiami Formation of southern Florida and previously referred to as the “Pinecrest Subsea” (Petuch, 1997)), an exact contemporary of the Jackson Subsea of the Choctaw Sea farther north (Figure 5). A series of rapid eustatic fluctuations took place during the late Piacenzian Age (Campbell, 1993; Petuch, 1997), with the final sea level lowering being the most severe and resulting in a brief emergent time. At the very end of the Piacenzian Age, the Okeechobean Sea basin again reflooded and produced the Caloosahatchee Subsea (named for the Caloosahatchee Formation of southern Florida) (Figure 7). This subsea existed across the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary and throughout the entire Calabrian Pleistocene. During the Nebraskan Glacial Stage of the Pleistocene, and during the accompanying major sea level drop, the entire Okeechobean area was emergent. For the rest of the Pleistocene Epoch, three short-lived subseas developed within the Okeechobean Sea basin; the Loxahatchee Subsea (named for the fossil beds at\n\n6\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nFigure 1.

Paleoseas include: C= Choctaw Sea (Bainbridge Subsea), O= Okeechobean Sea (Dade Subsea), CH= Charleston Sea (Ashley Subsea), and V= Vicksburg Sea (not covered in this book). Prominent geomorphological features include: SS= Suwannee Strait (also referred to as the Gulf Trough) with its complex of coral reefs (speckling on map), OI= Orange Island and its complex of coral reefs (speckling on map), and Y= the Yamacraw Arch and highlands, separating the Charleston Sea from the Choctaw SeaSuwannee Strait. During this time, most of the Okeechobean Sea was covered with deep water (100-200m), with only small reef complexes in the south.\n\nChapter one, Paleoseas of Cenozoic Eastern North America\n\n7\n\nLoxahatchee, Palm Beach County, Florida) (Aftonian Interglacial Stage), the Belle Glade Subsea (named for the fossil beds at Belle Glade, Palm Beach County, Florida) (Yarmouthian Interglacial Stage), and the Lake Worth Subsea (named for the fossil beds at Lake Worth, Palm Beach County, Florida) (Sangamonian Interglacial Stage). These three subseas were separated by regressions during the Kansan and Illinoian Glacial Stages, respectively. For detailed discussions of the individual geomorphologies and ecosystems of the Okeechobean subseas, see Chapters 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nThe Raritan Sea The northernmost of the paleoseas of the Atlantic basinal systems, the Raritan Sea (named for the Raritan River and Raritan Bay of New Jersey), extended from Atlantic County, New Jersey northward to at least Cape Cod, Massachussetts (Figures 2 and 4). The Raritan Sea is also the most poorly known of the Atlantic paleoseas, as most of its sediments are deeply buried beneath Plio-Pleistocene deltas or, in the north, have been removed by Pleistocene glaciation. The paltry Raritan fossil material, collected mostly from deep well cores or from poorly preserved coastal exposures (eg. Sankaty Head, Nantucket, Massachussetts; Shattuck, 1904), shows that the sea existed only from the midBurdigalian Miocene to the end of the Langhian Miocene. This shortest-lived of the coastal paleoseas may also have had subsea intervals during the Rupelian Oligocene (contemporaneous with the Bainbridge Subsea of the Choctaw and Dade Subsea of the Okeechobean Sea) or during the late Chattian Oligocene-early Aquitanian Miocene (contemporaneous with the Chattahoochee Subsea of the Choctaw Sea or the Tampa Subsea of the Okeechobean Sea). Since there is, at present, no paleontological evidence for these earlier subseas, their existence is purely conjectural and they will remain un-named. Some cold water faunal components, probably derived from Raritan Sea ecosystems, are present in early Miocene paleoseas farther south and these are discussed in Chapter 4.\n\nThe Salisbury Sea South of the Raritan Sea and extending from present-day southern New Jersey to the James River of Virginia and inland to Richmond, Virginia and west of Washington, D.C. (at its greatest development), was the largest of the Atlantic coast paleoseas, the Salisbury Sea (named for Salisbury, Maryland on the Delmarva Peninsula). As can be seen in Figures 2 and 4, the Salisbury Sea was separated from the Raritan Sea to the north by the Normandy Arch highlands of present-day southern New Jersey. Ranging from the late Chattian Oligocene to the mid-Tortonian Miocene, the Salisbury Sea encompassed four subseas. The oldest of these, and representing the incipiency of the Salisbury Sea, was the Old Church Subsea (named for the Old Church Formation of the Chesapeake Group) (Figure 2). Existing from the late Chattian Oligocene until the early Aquitanian Miocene, the Old Church Subsea was contemporaneous with the Chattahoochee and Tampa Subseas farther south. As in these southern paleoseas, the basin of the Old Church Subsea dried out during the mid-Aquitanian but remained emergent longer, until the midBurdigalian Miocene. At that time, the basin reflooded to produce the largest and bestdeveloped subsea, the Calvert Subsea (named for the Calvert Formation of the Chesapeake Group (Figure 4). This expansive and complex subsea disappeared at the end of the Langhian Miocene and the area remained emergent until the early Serravallian Miocene. During this regressive interval, large river systems rapidly began to fill the northern end of the basin with sediments, greatly reducing the areas that would be susceptible to flooding by future sea level rises. By the mid-Serravallian Miocene, the paleosea basin again\n\n8\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nFigure 2.

Another brief emergent period occurred during the mid-to-late Serravallian and this was followed by a reflooding during the latest Serravallian to produce the stillsmaller St. Mary’s Subsea (named for the St. Mary’s Formation of the Chesapeake Group). By the mid-Tortonian Miocene, the giant delta systems of the Patuxent and St. Mary’s Subseas had largely infilled the Salisbury Sea basin and the paleosea ceased to exist. For detailed discussions of the individual geomorphologies and ecosystems of the Salisbury subseas, see Chapters 4 and 5.\n\nThe Albemarle Sea To the south of the Salisbury Sea, and separated from it by the Norfolk Arch highlands, was the Albemarle Sea (named for the Albemarle Sound of North Carolina) (Figures 2, 4, 6, and 8). At its greatest development, the Albemarle Sea extended from the presentday Potomac River area in the north, south to southern North Carolina, and inland as far west as near Greenville, North Carolina. The longest-lived of the Atlantic paleoseas, the Albemarle Sea ranged from the Rupelian Oligocene until the end of the Calabrian Pleistocene and encompassed seven subseas. Like the Choctaw and Okeechobean Seas, the subseas of the Albemarle Sea can be broken into two groups, based upon their marine faunas; the early subseas (Rupelian Oligocene to late Langhian Miocene) and the late subseas (late Tortonian Miocene to Calabrian Pleistocene). The oldest of the early subseas, the River Bend Subsea (named for the River Bend Formation of North Carolina), existed during the Rupelian to earliest Chattian Oligocene and was contemporaneous with the Bainbridge and Dade Subseas farther south. The River Bend Subsea and the Albemarle Sea basin were emergent briefly during the late Chattian only to be reflooded during the latest Chattian to produce the Silverdale Subsea (named for Silverdale, Onslow County, North Carolina). Contemporaneous with the Chattahoochee and Tampa Subseas to the south and with the Old Church Subsea to the north, the Silverdale Subsea existed until the early Aquitanian Miocene, when the entire basin was again emergent. By the late Burdigalian Miocene, the last but largest of the early subseas, the Pamlico Subsea (named for the Pamlico River of North Carolina) reflooded the area as far north as the present-day Albemarle Sound (Figure 4). The Pamlico Subsea was contemporaneous with the last part of the deposition of the Chipola and Arcadia Subseas to the south and with the Calvert Subsea and Raritan Sea to the north. The end of the Langhian Miocene saw the beginning of a long period of emergence for most of the Albemarle Sea basin, for the entire Serravallian until the late Tortonian Miocene. At that time, the depocenter of the Albemarle basin moved northward across the Norfolk Arch to incorporate the southernmost part of the now mostly infilled Salisbury Sea. This is the only known example of “basin-capture” seen in the eastern North American paleoseas, and resulted from the erosion and removal of the Norfolk Arch highlands during the late Miocene. The first and largest of the late subseas, the Rappahannock Subsea (named for the Rappahannock River of Virginia), filled the new, enlarged basin until the mid-Messinian Miocene, when the area again became emergent. Only for a short time during the mid-Zanclean Pliocene did the Albemarle Sea area flood again, this time producing the Williamsburg Subsea (named for Williamsburg, Virginia). This short-lived subsea, contemporaneous with the Murdock Subsea farther south, disappeared in the late Zanclean and was followed by another short period of emergence. The beginning of the Piacenzian Pliocene saw a reflooding of the enlarged basin and the formation of the Yorktown Subsea (named for the Yorktown Formation of the Chesapeake Group and previously referred to as the “Yorktown Sea” (Petuch, 1997)) (Figure 6). This large and complex\n\n10\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nFigure 3.

Prominent geomorphological features include: T= Torreya Lagoon System and Y= Yamacraw Arch and highlands. During this time, the Okeechobean Sea was rapidly infilling to become a shallow lagoon and the southern coral reef complexes were expanding to produce full reef tracts.\n\nChapter one, Paleoseas of Cenozoic Eastern North America\n\n11\n\nsubsea was contemporaneous with the Jackson and Tamiami Subseas farther south. After a brief period of emergence in the late Piacenzian, the last of the late subseas, the Croatan Subsea (named for the Croatan National Forest area, Craven County, North Carolina) reflooded the Albemarle basin in the latest Piacenzian (Figure 8). Contemporaneous with the Caloosahatchee Subsea farther south, the Croatan Subsea existed until the end of the Calabrian Pleistocene. By the Nebraskan Stage of the Pleistocene, the Albemarle Sea ceased to exist. For detailed discussions of the individual geomorphologies and ecosystems of the Albemarle subseas, see Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.\n\nThe Charleston Sea The southernmost of the Atlantic paleoseas, the Charleston Sea (named for Charleston, South Carolina), extended, at its maximum development, from present-day southern North Carolina south to northern Georgia and extended inland at least as far as Santee, South Carolina (Figures 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). Separated from the Albemarle Sea to the north by the Cape Fear Arch highlands, the Charleston Sea was the most geomorphologically complex of the eastern North American paleoseas, comprising two separate embayments and a series of lagoon systems in the south. Like the Albemarle Sea, the Charleston Sea existed from the Rupelian Oligocene to the end of the Calabrian Pleistocene, but encompassed only six separate subseas. Also like the Albemarle Sea, the subseas of the Charleston Sea can be broken into two separate groups, based on their marine faunas; the early subseas (Rupelian Oligocene to late Langhian Miocene) and the late subseas (midZanclean Pliocene to late Calabrian Pleistocene). Because of poor fossil preservation, high levels of postdepositional diagenesis, and deep burial by Pleistocene alluvia, the early subseas are still poorly known. As is presently understood, the oldest of the Charleston subseas, the Ashley Subsea (named for the Ashley Formation of the Cooper Group of South Carolina) (Figure 1) existed from the Rupelian to early Chattian Oligocene and was contemporaneous with the Bainbridge and Dade Subseas farther south and with the River Bend Subsea farther north. After an emergent time during the mid-Chattian, the Charleston Sea basin was flooded in the latest Chattian Oligocene to produce the Edisto Subsea (named for the Edisto Formation of South Carolina). Existing into the earliest Aquitanian Miocene, the Edisto Subsea was contemporaneous with the Chattahoochee and Tampa Subseas in the south and the Silverdale and Old Church Subseas in the north. The majority of the basin dried out during the mid-Aquitanian and remained emergent until the late Burdigalian Miocene. At that time, the area was again reflooded by the last of the early subseas, the long-lived Coosawhatchee Subsea (named for the Coosawhatchee Formation of Georgia) (Figure 3), a contemporary of the Pamlico, Calvert, and Patuxent Subseas and Raritan Sea to the north and the latest parts of the Chipola, Arcadia, and Walton Subseas to the south. By the end of the mid-Serravallian Miocene, the Charleston Sea was again emergent. Little is known about the the paleoceanography of the Charleston Sea during the time interval spanning the Serravallian, Tortonian, and Messinian Miocene. During this time, the entire area was under the influence of extensive fluvial, deltaic, and estuarine systems that rapidly buried or removed much of the older sea floors. In the early Zanclean Pliocene, the Charleston Sea basin again reflooded to produce the first of the late subseas, the Santee Subsea (named for the fossil beds at Santee, Orangeburg County, South Carolina). Contemporaneous with the Murdock Subsea to the south and the Williamsburg Subsea to the north, the Santee Subsea existed only until the late Zanclean, when the entire area was again emergent. The beginning of the Piacenzian Pliocene saw a major reflooding of the area, producing the large and complex Duplin Subsea (named for the Duplin\n\n12\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nFigure 4.

Existing until the late Piacenzian, the Duplin Subsea was the exact contemporary of the Jackson and Tamiami Subseas to the south and the Yorktown Subsea to the north. After a brief emergent time, the basin again reflooded in the latest Piacenzian to produce the Waccamaw Subsea (named for the Waccamaw Formation of southern North Carolina and South Carolina) (Figure 8). As in the contemporaneous Caloosahatchee Subsea to the south and the Croatan Subsea to the north, the Waccamaw Subsea existed only until the end of the Calabrian Pleistocene. After that time, the Charleston Sea was essentially infilled and was replaced by an extensive series of coastal lagoons (the Socastee Lagoon System, see Chapter 9). For detailed discussions of the individual geomorphologies and ecosystems of the Charleston subseas, see Chapters 3, 6, and 8.\n\nDeposition within the eastern North American Paleoseas The sedimentary units found within the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal basins are the “windows” to the oceanography of the American paleoseas. The mineralogical composition, size classes, and mode of formation of their component sediments give great insight into the temperature, salinity, and bathymetry of any given area within the individual subseas. Overall, the geological formations of the subseas fall under two broad lithologic and environmental types; those produced in carbonate environments and those produced in siliciclastic environments. The carbonate strata formed in shallow, offshore, tropical environments away from river mouths while siliciclastic strata formed along the sandy shorelines of both tropical and warm temperate environments, often along river deltas. Coastal upwelling systems, with their nutrient-rich water and thick plankton blooms, also produced distinctive reducing environments that led to the formation of phosphorites in warmer water areas and diatomaceous oozes in cooler water areas. In this book, seven main types of tropical depositional environments are recognized in the geological formations that were laid down within the eastern American paleosea basins. Primary among these are the coral reefs of the southern subseas. In some cases, as within the Okeechobean Sea (see Chapter 7), these carbonate systems represented true, zonated coral reefs, with discernable fore-reefs, reef crests, reef platforms, and back reefs. More often, the coralline facies were produced by smaller coral bioherms and “patch reefs” within carbonate lagoons. These same lagoons also housed the second and third types of tropical environments; the open carbonate sand and oolite bottoms and the extensive beds of Turtle Grass (Thalassia sp.) growing on carbonate mud (calcilutite) bottoms. Both of these depositional environments interfingered with the coral bioherms and zonated reefs. A fourth type of tropical environment included estuaries and their accompanying organicrich mud flats, derived from fluvial deposition of clays and mud-sized particles. Typically, large “reefs” of tropical oysters (genera Hyotissa and Gigantostrea) also grew and accumulated within these estuaries and produced the fifth type of tropical depositional environment. In close proximity to the mud flats and oyster reefs, and growing successionally over them, was the sixth type of environment, the mangrove jungles (most probably species of Red Mangroves, Rhizophora, and Black Mangroves, Avicennia) and their accompanying peaty sands. The seventh tropical environmental type, upwelling systems, usually occurred in deeper offshore areas, and can be differentiated from temperate upwelling areas by the greater species-richness and diversity of the associated ecosystems. These environments of deposition and their associated tropical marine communities and ecosystems are discussed in Chapters 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. The warm temperate paleoseas discussed in this book also contained seven main types of depositional environments. Two of the most prevalent types were open, quartz sand bot-\n\nChapter one, Paleoseas of Cenozoic Eastern North America\n\nFigure 6.

Prominent geomorphological features include: CF= Cape Fear Arch and highlands.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\ntoms in shallow water areas behind barrier islands and quartz sand bottoms in deep lagoons and sounds. These often housed immense beds of scallops and turritellid gastropods. In close proximity to the shallow water sand bottom areas was the third type of temperate environment, the Eel Grass (Zostera) beds. These sea grass beds grew extensively on muddy bottoms in quiet, shallow bays and lagoons. Temperate estuaries represented the fourth type of environment, where mud flats and mud banks predominated. As in the tropical estuaries, a fifth type of depositional environment, the oyster reefs, also grew within these estuarine lagoons. Unlike the tropical estuaries, these oyster reefs were dominated by the genera Ostrea, Crassostrea, and Conradostrea. The sixth environmental type, river deltas, typically laid down thick sequences of clays and mud, most often unfossiliferous. The seventh environmental type, upwelling systems, occurred in deeper, offshore waters and differed from the tropical analogues in having a low species-richness in the associated ecosystems. Most often, these temperate upwelling areas produced thick beds of “Fuller’s Earth” diatom frustule sediments. The warm temperate-to-temperate depositional environments and their associated marine communities and ecosystems are discussed in Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. The fourteen main tropical and warm temperate depositional environments, and their numerous variations and combinations, have produced a large number of lithostratigraphic groups, formations, and members within the paleosea basins covered in this book. These are outlined here by paleosea and subsea.

Biogeography of the Eastern American Paleoseas\n\nThe marine biogeography of western Atlantic fossil organisms, encompassing their large-scale distributions along the Caribbean Basin and North and South American coasts, is the single most powerful tool for deciphering paleoceanographic parameters. In the case of the neritic environments covered in the following chapters, these biogeographical patterns reflect the interaction of only three parameters: temperature, salinity, and substrate type. Since most marine organisms are physiologically restricted to relatively narrow temperature ranges, their latitudinal distribution in the fossil record is a precise reflection of paleotemperature gradients and oceanographic climate. Likewise, osmoregulatory ability limits most organisms to narrow salinity ranges, reflecting the physiographic characteristics of ancient water masses. As will be seen in the marine communities discussed in this book, most benthonic organisms are also ecologically and morphologically tied to very specific substrate types and these preferences give insight into past depositional environments. Altogether, these ecological parameters and constraints define discrete geographical units whose latitudinal limits are set by the ranges of endemic index organisms. Marine biogeographical units can be considered to be single, giant biological entities or “superorganisms” evolving above the organismal and community levels. In this book, I have adopted a classification scheme that uses the concept of the province as the primary biogeographical unit. All provinces are based upon the application of the “50% Rule” to a single large taxonomic group, usually a phylum or a class (Valentine, 1973; Briggs, 1974, 1995). Here, I have chosen the gastropod and bivalved mollusks, together, as the defining group because of their good preservation and abundance in the geological record and because of their sharply defined ecological preferences. Within this framework, two adjacent geographical areas can be considered separate molluscan provinces if at least 50% of the species-level taxa are endemic to each area. This mutual exclusivity includes the faunas of all possible analogous biotopes within the two provinces (Petuch, 1988, 1997). Areas within the boundaries of a single province that have at least 30% endemism at the species level are referred to as subprovinces. As in ecotones (Odum, 1971), some subprovinces represent areas of faunal overlap between two provinces. These ecotone analogues are referred to as provinciatones and they characteristically contain their own suites of provinciatonal endemics. Most provinces, and their subprovince and provinciatone subdivisions, contain large numbers of endemic genera and unique communities. As demonstrated by Valentine (1973) and Briggs (1995), the provinces of other marine organisms, such as echinoderms, corals, and fishes, essentially conform to the geographical limits of molluscan faunal provinces. Water temperature is the primary oceanographic parameter that defines the provincial arrangement of the eastern North American seas and subseas. With the exception of the Champlain and Raritan Seas, the five main paleoseas (Choctaw, Okeechobean, Charleston, Albemarle, and Salisbury Seas) can be classified as having had tropical, subtropical, or warm-temperate marine climates. In many cases, the higher latitude provinces were mixed systems, containing both subtropical and warm-temperate subprovinces. The provinces within the tropical seas, where water temperatures do not fall below 20 degrees Celsius, are referred to as eutropical provinces. These are low-latitude and circumequatori-\n\n22\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nal in distribution and their faunas are generally derived from Eocene Tethyan Sea lineages. On the other hand, provinces within subtropical or warm-temperate seas, where water temperatures regularly fall below 20 degrees Celsius but not below 10 degrees Celsius, are referred to as paratropical provinces. These are distributed at higher latitudes and always form a mirror-image pair (north and south) on either side of the eutropical province. Paratropical provinces typically contain mixed faunas, with Tethyan-derived tropical components coexisting with boreal or antiboreal-derived cold water components. Provinciatonal subprovinces form along the boundaries of eutropical and paratropical provinces and contain geographically-restricted taxa that cannot exist at either higher or lower latitudes. Environmentally, eutropical marine provinces and subprovinces are demarcated by the presence of coral reefs and their accompanying carbonate systems, by Turtle Grass (Thalassia) beds in lagoonal situations, and by mangrove forests in estuaries. Each of these main environmental types has its own characteristic associated molluscan fauna, with the same genera and families being found in tropical areas around the world. In the fossil record, eutropical areas can be delineated by the presence of several key gastropod families, subfamilies, and genera. Some of the key families and subfamilies include: Potamididae (all genera, associated with mud flats and estuaries), Strombidae (all genera, associated with lagoons and coral reef areas), Xenophoridae (all genera, associated with carbonate lagoons or deep water areas), Modulidae (all genera, associated with Turtle Grass beds and carbonate lagoons), Melongenidae (all genera, associated with lagoons, mud flats, and some deep water areas), Vasinae (family Turbinellidae, all genera, associated with coral reefs and carbonate lagoons), Volutinae and Lyriinae (both family Volutidae, all genera, associated with coral reefs and carbonate lagoons), and Peristerniinae (family Fasciolariidae, all genera, associated with coral reefs, carbonate lagoons, and some deep water areas). Some of the key eutropical index genera include: Cassis (Cassidae), Turbinella (Turbinellidae), (in the Americas) Muracypraea, Luria (Basilitrona), Pseudozonaria, and Pustularia (all Cypraeidae), Jenneria, Pseudocyphoma, Cyphoma, and Marginocypraea (all Ovulidae), Myurella, Panaterebra, and Myurellina (all Terebridae), Protoconus, Eugeniconus, Virgiconus, Hermes, and Artemidiconus (all Conidae), and Taenioturbo, Marmarostoma, Lithopoma, and Astralium (all Turbinidae). Examples of all of these genera and families are illustrated, in ecological and chronological context, in the following chapters. Paratropical marine provinces and subprovinces typically lack well-developed carbonate environments, and the associated coral reefs, mangrove forests, and Thalassia beds, but contain some cold-tolerant, eurythermal offshoots of eutropical families. In the Recent Americas a classic example of a paratropical province is seen in the Californian Province, which lacks coral reefs, mangroves, and Thalassia beds but where the tropical families Conidae (genus Chelyconus), Cypraeidae (genus Neobernaya), Potamididae (genus Cerithidea), and Bursidae (genus Bursa) each are represented by a single species. These coldtolerant derivatives coexist with classic cold water genera such as Ophiodermella and Megasurcula (Turridae), Euspira (Naticidae), and Ceratostoma (Muricidae). The key eutropical families Strombidae, Modulidae, Vasinae (Turbinellidae), Lyriinae (Volutidae), and Peristerniinae (Fasciolariidae) (all of which have examples living farther south, in the Panamic Province, along southern Baja California) are absent in the Californian Province. As pointed out by Vermeij (1978), the cryophilic offshoots of tropical families are usually generalist feeders with weak shell architecture, demonstrating that their invasion into higher and lower latitudes may be the result of avoidance of competition and predation. Similar paratropical patterns are seen in the Miocene Salisbury Sea, where a few species of tropical groups such as the Conidae (Gradiconus), Olividae (Oliva (Strephona)), and Xenophoridae (Xenophora) coexisted with classic cold water genera such as Euspira\n\nChapter two, Biogeography of the Eastern American Paleoseas\n\n23\n\n(Naticidae), Admete (Cancellariidae), and Oenopota (Turridae). Some old, long-lived paratropical provinces have developed large species radiations of tropically derived groups, producing a distinct tropical appearance in a nontropical area. As can be seen in the Southwestern Australia, Tasmanian, and Southeastern Australian Provinces of Recent Australia and the Southwestern African and Agulhas Provinces of Recent South Africa (Briggs, 1995), species swarms of the Turbinidae, Conidae, Cypraeidae, Vasinae (Turbinellidae), and Lyriinae (Volutidae) have evolved in cold water areas that are devoid of both coral reefs and stenothermal tropical families such as the Strombidae and Modulidae. Recent advances in the accuracy of stratigraphic correlations, geochronologic dating, and paleoenvironmental interpretations (examples discussed, in context, in the following chapters) have allowed for the first high-resolution view of the biogeographic patterns in the eastern American paleoseas. These discoveries have shown that the original “Miocene Caribbean Province” of Woodring (1974) and my Miocene-to-early Pleistocene “Caloosahatchian and Gatunian Provinces” and Miocene “Transmarian Province” (Petuch, 1982, 1988, and 1997) were essentially correct but were too simplistic and chronologically too broad in scope. This was particularly true at the subprovince level, where previous inaccuracies in dating led to chronologically disparate faunas being included together in the same chronosubprovince. When these new data are incorporated into the provinicial schemes proposed by Woodring and myself, a more detailed and complex biogeographical pattern presents itself, both spatially and temporally. In the time period spanning the early Oligocene to the Recent, twelve separate molluscan faunal provinces and at least forty-six subprovinces are now known to have existed within the western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Regions. These are arranged chronologically and discussed in the following sections.\n\nMarine Provinces of Rupelian to earliest Chattian Oligocene Time By the beginning of Oligocene time, three eutropical and paratropical molluscan faunal provinces had formed within the western Atlantic. These included the northern ProtoTransmarian Province, the central Antiguan Province, and the southern Pernambucan Province (Figure 9). At this time, the Isthmus of Panama had not yet formed and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were connected by a wide strait that extended from Honduras south to northern Colombia (the Bolivar Strait). The tropical waters of the North Equatorial Current of the Atlantic Ocean flowed westward through the Bolivar Strait and bifurcated along the western coast of Central and northern South America. From there, one branch of the bifurcated current flowed northward to at least southern California while the other branch flowed southward to northern Peru. Another Atlantic warm water current, the Arawak Current (Petuch, 1997), flowed northward along the West Indian Arc, through the Gulf of Mexico region as a loop current, and northward to at least Recent Cape Fear, North Carolina. The North Equatorial Current also bifurcated and flowed southward along the Brazilian coast to at least Recent Cabo Frio. These currents produced the tropical, subtropical, and warm-temperate marine climates found in all three provinces.\n\nThe Proto-Transmarian Province Named for its ancestry to the Miocene Transmarian Province, this northernmost early Oligocene paratropical province extended from South Carolina northward, conjecturally, to the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Figure 9) and encompassed the Ashley Subsea of the Charleston Sea, the River Bend Subsea of the Albemarle Sea, and the pre-Old Church Salisbury Sea basin. Since no well-preserved fossil beds dating from this time are known\n\n24\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nFigure 9. Approximate configuration of the marine molluscan provinces and subprovinces of the western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific during Rupelian to earliest Chattian Oligocene time, superimposed upon the outline of the Recent Americas. Biogeographical units include: PT= Proto-Transmarian Province, A= Antiguan Province, A1= Hernandoan Subprovince, A2= Vicksburgian Subprovince, A3= Alazanian Subprovince, A4= Guanican Subprovince, A5= Bohioan Subprovince, A6= Mancoran Subprovince, P= Pernambucan Province.\n\nChapter two, Biogeography of the Eastern American Paleoseas\n\n25\n\nfrom most of this area (Ward, 1992), little is known about the basic faunal structure and subprovincial arrangement. The molluscan fauna of the southern parts of the province, in the Charleston and Albemarle Seas (in the Ashley and River Bend Formations; see Rossbach and Carter, 1991), shows some affinity to the Vicksburg Sea fauna, sharing several species such as the personiid Distorsio crassidens and the ficid Ficus mississippiensis. The Proto-Transmarian fauna also contained some important endemic species such as the oldest true Ecphora (sensu stricto) species (E. wheeleri) (Ocenebrinae, Muricidae), the oldest true Scaphella species (S. saintjeani), and an endemic Calvertitella (mortoni complex) species radiation (Turritellidae). The genera Ecphora (s.s.) and Calvertitella were important components of the subsequent Transmarian Province molluscan fauna. The cold water Raritan Current, flowing southward as a countercurrent (Petuch, 1997), most likely created a temperate marine climate in the northern part of the province (the incipient Raritan and Salisbury Seas).\n\nThe Antiguan Province Named for the early Oligocene fossil beds on Antigua Island, Lesser Antilles, which typify the paleoprovince (the Antigua Formation), the Antiguan Province extended from South Carolina, throughout the Vicksburg Sea of the Mississippi Embayment, along Central America, through the Bolivar Strait, north to central Mexico, southwest to northern Peru, and southeast to northern Brazil (Figure 9). The Antiguan provincial limits are defined by a large number of widespread tropical organisms, including the corals Antiguastrea cellulosa (Montastreidae) (Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Antigua, Aruba, and Panama), Acropora saludensis and Actinacis alabamensis (both Acroporidae) (Alabama, Florida, Antigua, and Panama), and Astrocoenia decaturensis (Astrocoeniidae) (Georgia, Cuba, and Antigua), the bivalved mollusks Hyotissa antiguensis (Gryphaeidae) (Cuba, Antigua, and Panama) and Clementia peruviana (Clementiinae-Veneridae) (Panama, Antigua, Colombia, and Peru), and the gastropod mollusks Ampullinopsis spenceri (Ampullospiridae) (Florida, Cuba, Antigua, Panama, Colombia, and Peru), Ficus mississippiensis (Ficidae) (Mississippi, Florida, and Panama), Torcula hubbardi (Turritellidae) (Cuba, Panama, and Peru), and the gastropod genera Orthaulax (Strombidae) (Alabama to Brazil), Falsilyria (Volutinae-Volutidae) (Florida to Brazil), and Hemisinus (Thiaridae) (Cuba to Brazil). Based upon regionally endemic species and species complexes, six subprovinces are now recognized as having existed within the Antiguan Province (Figure 9). These include: the Hernandoan Subprovince (southeastern Georgia, Florida, and southern Alabama), the Vicksburgian Subprovince (the Mississippi Embayment area and eastern Texas), the Alazanian Subprovince (northern Mexico to Honduras), the Guanican Subprovince (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Lesser Antilles), the Bohioan Subprovince (Suriname, Venezuela, northern Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, and northward to the Gulf of California), and the Mancoran Subprovince (southwestern Colombia, Ecuador, and northern Peru). These subprovinces are described in the following sections and illustrations of some of the index fossils are shown in Chapter 3.\n\nThe Hernandoan Subprovince Named for Hernando County, Florida, site of rich fossil beds containing the typical fauna, this subprovince encompassed the areas of the Bainbridge Subsea, the Salt Mountain reef beds of Alabama, and the Suwannee Strait of northern Florida and southern Georgia (see Chapter 3). Being eutropical in marine climate, the Hernandoan Subprovince contained the largest and best-developed coral reef complexes on the Oligocene eastern North American mainland. Because of the varied tropical habitats asso-\n\n26\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nciated with these coral reefs, the Hernandoan area housed a highly endemic molluscan fauna, both at the species and genus level. Some of the endemic genera include: Prismacerithium and Cestumcerithium (Cerithiidae), Pyrazisinus (Potamididae, the oldestknown species), and Suwanneescapha (Cylichnidae). Although sharing many species with the neighboring Vicksburgian Subprovince, such as Torcula mississippiensis (Turritellidae), Distorsio crassidens (Personiidae), Sinum mississippiensis (Naticidae), Ficus mississippiensis (Ficidae), Clavolithes vicksburgensis (Turbinellidae), and Phalium caelatura (Cassidae), the Hernandoan Subprovince contained whole suites of endemic, carbonate-loving species such as Telescopium hernandoense (and at least three other Telescopium species, Potamididae), Cassis flintensis (Cassidae), Orthaulax hernandoensis (Strombidae), Falsilyria mansfieldi and F. kendrewi (both Volutinae-Volutidae), Spinifulgur gemmulatum (Busyconidae), Astralium polkensis (Turbinidae), Cypraeorbis kendrewi (Cypraeidae), Vasum suwanneensis (VasinaeTurbinellidae), Hermes kendrewi (Conidae) and Turbinella suwannensis (TurbinellinaeTurbinellidae) (see Dall, 1915, Mansfield, 1937, and Petuch, 1997). Of special interest on the Hernandoan reefs were the only-known American species of the tridacnid bivalve genus Hippopus (H. hernandoensis) and the last-living American example of the seraphsid gastropod genus Terebellum (T. hernandoensis). In the Recent, both of these genera are restricted to the tropical Indo-Pacific region and their presence on the Hernandoan reefs, along with Telescopium, gives a decidedly South Pacific feel to the area.\n\nThe Vicksburgian Subprovince Named for the Vicksburg Group of Formations of Mississippi, which contain the typical fauna, this northernmost Antiguan subprovince was paratropical in marine climate and lacked extensive carbonate environments and coral reefs. Massive sedimentary infilling of the Mississippi Embayment by river deltas was also taking place at this time, and the absence of key carbonate environment taxa may be more related to substrate and facies differences than to temperature. Although containing most of the classic tropical gastropod families such as the Conidae (Gradiconus sauridens), Lyriinae-Volutidae (Lyria mississippiensis), Xenophoridae (Xenophora humilis), Melongenidae (Myristica crassicornuta), and Cypraeidae (Cypraeorbis cf. ventripotens), the Vicksburgian Subprovince lacked other key tropical families such as the Strombidae (with Orthaulax being strikingly absent), Volutinae-Volutidae (with the wide-ranging Antiguan genus Falsilyria being absent), Turbinidae, Modulidae, and Potamididae (for the best documentation, see MacNeil and Dockery, 1984). On the other hand, the Vicksburgian area housed a large number of characteristic endemic gastropod genera, some of which include Echinofulgur (E. branneri complex, Melongenidae), Reticulacella (Scaphellinae-Volutidae), and Spinifulgur (S. spiniger complex, Busyconidae). Of special interest were several endemic species complexes, especially the Pleurofusia servata complex (Turridae) and the Sulcocypraea lintea complex (Ovulidae).\n\nThe Alazanian Subprovince Named for the Alazan Formation of La Ceiba, Buena Vista River, Veracruz State, Mexico, which contains the typical fauna, this subprovince is still poorly known and unstudied. The type formation, and only extensive collecting site, contains a relatively impoverished fauna but enough evidence is present to demonstrate that this area was distinct from the subprovinces to the north and south (Cooke, 1928). Although sharing several gastropod species with the Vicksburgian and Hernandoan Subprovinces, such as the previously mentioned Torcula mississippiensis, Distorsio crassidens, Phalium caelatura, and Sinum mississippiensis, and the turrid Pleurofusia servata and the naticid Polinices byramensis\n\nChapter two, Biogeography of the Eastern American Paleoseas\n\n27\n\n(Naticidae), the Alazanian Subprovince contained several unusual and distinct endemic gastropod and bivalve species such as Ancilla alazana (Olividae), Amusium alazanum (Pectinidae), the bizarre Thatcheria-like turrid “Pseudotoma” alazana (representing an undescribed endemic genus), and species radiations of the turrid genera Scobinella, Gemmula, Glyptotoma, and Paraborsonia. Of special interest was the presence of the endemic melanellid gastropod genus Protonema (P. bartschi).\n\nThe Guanican Subprovince Named for the Guanica Formation of Puerto Rico, which contains the typical fauna, this subprovince is also poorly known and relatively unstudied. Although encompassing the area of the entire Antilles Arc, preservation of the Guanican Oligocene faunas is generally poor in all formations, usually being leached or present only as molds. Of special interest within the Guanican Subprovince was the strombid gastropod genus Orthaulax, which underwent a large and characteristic endemic species radiation, producing at least six different species. Some of these, such as O. aguadillensis and O. bermudezi are the largest of their genus, being two or three times bigger than their northern Hernandoan congeners. Also of special interest was the presence of the large, Campanile-like endemic potamidid gastropod genus Portoricia (particularly P. laricum), which probably occupied the same ecological niche on mud flats as did the Hernandoan Telescopium species complex (see Maury, 1920). Similarly, the wide-ranging Antiguan thiarid gastropod genus Hemisinus (as the H. atriformis species complex) underwent an endemic species radiation within estuarine areas of the Guanican Subprovince. The Guanican area also contained a distinctive species complex of the turritellid gastropod genus Torcula (centered around T. collazica), and these appear to have dominated deeper lagoonal areas along the shorelines.\n\nThe Bohioan Subprovince Named for the Bohio Formation of Panama, which contains the typical fauna (see Woodring, 1959), this was the only transisthmian subprovince, extending from Suriname to Colombia (Olsson and Richards, 1961), spanning the then-submerged Isthmus of Panama, and ranging along the Pacific coast from northwestern Colombia northward to the Mexican coast. Throughout the entire range, the molluscan fauna was remarkably similar and was characterized by such unusual endemic genera as Glyptostyla (G. panamensis complex, Turbinellidae), Gonysycon (G. epomis complex, Ficidae), and Longiverena (Thiaridae). As a eutropical subprovince, the Bohioan contained all the key gastropod families, particularly the Cypraeidae, with a species swarm of the genus Cypraeorbis (centered around C. venezuelana) and with the oldest-known American Pustularia (P. mejasensis), Turbinellidae (the Turbinella buccina complex, the ancestors of the Miocene T. validus complex), Strombidae (with the genus Orthaulax being found only in the southern part, along Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Venezuela), and Conidae. Of special interest was the presence of the oldest-known member of the ranellid genus Septa (S. ogygium), a species complex of the Neozealandic turrid genus Zemacies, and a radiation of the fasciolariid genus Mancorus (M. grabaui complex). The widespread Antiguan Province gastropod index species Torcula meroensis (Turritellidae) and Ampullinopsis spenceri (Ampullospiridae) were especially common and prominent organisms throughout the entire subprovincial region. The northwestern boundary of the Bohioan Subprovince is still conjectural, as fossiliferous Oligocene formations are largely absent from areas between the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and Oregon. Squires and Demetrion (1992) showed that the central coastline of Baja California Sur, Mexico contained a eutropical marine fauna during the Eocene,\n\n28\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nwith reef complexes of Actinacis, Goniopora, Stylosmilia, Colpophyllia, Montastrea, Stylophora, and Antillia corals. These Eocene Baja California reefs supported a host of eutropical mollusks, including the gastropods Bernaya (Cypraeidae), Paraseraphs (Seraphsidae), Ectinochilus (Strombidae), Xenophora (Xenophoridae), Conasprella (Conidae), Lyria (Lyriinae-Volutidae), Arene (Liotiidae), Architectonica (Architectonicidae), and Olivella (Olividae), and the bivalves Spondylus (Spondylidae) and Lima (Limidae). Many of these genera survived the late Eocene-early Oligocene extinction event (see Chapter 10) and may have existed along the same coastline as they did in the middle Eocene, possibly as far north as southern California. This conjectural northernmost edge of the Bohioan Subprovince may have represented a separate, still un-named, subprovince, and one that contained eutropical faunas that gave rise to the rich coralline environments of the Pliocene Imperial Sea (see p. 52).\n\nThe Mancoran Subprovince Named for the late Eocene-Oligocene Mancora Group of formations of northern Peru, which contains the typical fauna, this paratropical subprovince exhibited a rich and highly endemic fauna, with characteristic species radiations in several key tropical gastropod families. Primary among these were the Harrisianella (H. peruviana complex) and Hannatoma (H. tumbezia complex) of the Cerithiidae and the endemic genus Diplocyma (Potamididae). Other gastropod radiations were seen in the endemic genera Peruluta (P. mancorensis complex, Zidoniidae?-Volutidae) and Peruficus (P. charanalensis complex, Turbinellidae) and in the genera Mancorus (M. burtii complex, Fasciolariidae) and Sulcobuccinum (S. mancorensis complex, Pseudolividae) (both shared with the Bohioan Subprovince). The widespread Antiguan turritellid Torcula meroensis was abundant in this subprovince and formed extensive beds in lagoonal areas. Other key tropical genera were also present and these included Gradiconus (Conidae), Turbinella (T. peruviana, Turbinellidae), and Cancellomorum (C. chiraense, Harpidae). The large number of endemic genera and species complexes found in the Mancoran area suggests that the subprovince may have been a provinciatone between the eutropical Bohioan Subprovince and the temperate Proto-Peruvian Province.\n\nThe Pernambucan Province Named for Pernambuco State, Brazil, site of the fossil beds of the Paleocene-early Eocene Maria Farinha Formation (White, 1887; possibly with species lineages surviving into the Oligocene) which typify the fauna of the paleoprovince, the Pernambucan Province extended from present-day Suriname to at least Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Figure 9). Since Brazilian fossiliferous exposures dating from this time are rare and generally poorly preserved, little is known about the composition of the Pernambucan molluscan fauna. Because of this, any arrangement of subprovinces cannot be established at this time. Enough data exists, however, to show that the area constituted a separate province with tropical affinities and that it contained high levels of endemism at both the genus and species level. Some of the more important Pernambucan gastropod endemics include a species complex of an undescribed genus of Prismacerithium-like cerithiids (centered around “Cerithium” freitasi), an undescribed genus of large, ornate Tympanotonus-like potamidids (centered around “Turritella” acuticarinata), and a species complex of Simnialike ovulids ( centered around “Simnia” gilliana) (White, 1887; Magalhaes and Mezzalira, 1953). Besides the families Cerithiidae, Potamididae, and Ovulidae, other tropical influences included Mazzalina ruginosa (Fasciolariidae), Gradiconus conditorius (Conidae), and Xenophora brasiliensis (Xenophoridae). Of special interest were several cold water compo-\n\nChapter two, Biogeography of the Eastern American Paleoseas\n\nFigure 10.

The presence of these antiboreal taxa demonstrates that the Pernambucan Province was at least partially paratropical.\n\nMarine Provinces of latest Chattian Oligocene to late Tortonian Miocene Time The mid-Chattian Oligocene saw a worldwide cooling event and the accompanying sea level drops, extinctions of many index groups, and disruptions of marine provincial structures (see Chapter 10). By the beginning of late Chattian time, the marine climates had warmed and the provinces of the western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific had reconfigured themselves. New groups of index organisms evolved and their ranges demarcated a new set of provinces and subprovinces. These included the northern Transmarian Province, the central Baitoan Province, and the southern Platensian Province (Figure 10). The paratropical Transmarian and Platensian Provinces and the eutropical Baitoan Province all retained their structures until the late Tortonian Miocene, when they underwent another extinction and reconfiguration period (see Chapter 10). During the existence of these three provinces, the Isthmus of Panama was still open and unformed and the oceanic currents were essentially the same as in the older Oligocene. At this time, the Arawak Current continued to convey warm waters all the way north to the Pamlico Subsea of the Albemarle Sea. The cool water Raritan Current continued southward down the coast as far as the Salisbury Sea, mixing with the warm Arawak waters and producing the Patuxent Gyre within the Old Church, Calvert, Patuxent, and St. Mary’s Subseas (Petuch, 1997). The North Equatorial Current continued to bifurcate after passing through the Bolivar Strait and conveyed warm water all the way north to southern California and south to northern Peru. These provinces, and their subprovincial and provinciatonal subdivisions, are discussed in the following sections and many of their key index organisms are illustrated in Chapters 3, 4, and 5.\n\nThe Transmarian Province Named for the St. Mary’s River, St. Mary’s County, Maryland (Petuch, 1988) (site of the classic St. Mary’s Formation fossil beds which typify the fauna), this province extended from Nova Scotia southward to North Carolina and encompassed the Raritan, Salisbury, and Albemarle Seas (Figure 10). Based upon the ranges and percentages of restricted endemic taxa, the Transmarian Province can be further subdivided into three subprovinces: the northern Sankatian Subprovince (extending from Nova Scotia to the Normandy Peninsula of New Jersey), the Calvertian Subprovince (extending from southern New Jersey south to the Norfolk Peninsula of Virginia), and the Pungoian Subprovince (extending from southern Virginia south to southern North Carolina). The boundaries of the Transmarian Province were sharply demarcated by the ranges of a large number of distinctive endemic gastropod genera, some of which included the naticid Poliniciella, the ocenebrine muricids Trisecphora (Plate 1, A) and Chesathais (Plate 1, C), the trophonine muricids Chesatrophon (Plate 1, I), Scalaspira, Patuxentrophon, and Lirosoma, the fusinine fasciolariids Conradconfusus, Pseudaptyxis, and Mariafusus (Plate 1, B), the turritellids Mariacolpus (Plate 1, H) and Calvertitella (by Burdigalian time extinct south of North Carolina), and the turrids Calverturris (Plate 1, K), Transmariaturris (Plate 1, J), Chesasyrinx (Plate 1, F), Chesaclava (Plate 1, G), Nodisuculina, Hemipleurotoma, Sediliopsis, and Mariaturricula (Plate 1, L), the cancellariids Marianarona (Plate 1, E), Cancellariella, and Mariasveltia, the buccinid Bulliopsis, and the terebrid Laevihastula (Plate 1, D) (Petuch, 1993). Examples of many of these endemic taxa are shown in Chapters 4 and 5. Because of the influence of the cold water Raritan\n\nChapter two, Biogeography of the Eastern American Paleoseas\n\n31\n\nPlate 1. Gastropod index genera of the Transmarian Province.

All specimens are from the Calvert, Choptank, and St. Mary’s Formations of Maryland.\n\n32\n\nCenozoic Seas: The View from Eastern North America\n\nCurrent, no coral reefs or reef-associated carbonate environments were found within the boundaries of the Transmarian Province. The paratropical nature of the Transmarian Province is readily demonstrated by the absence of key tropical gastropod families such as the Turbinidae, Potamididae, Strombidae, Cypraeidae, Ovulidae, Melongenidae, Peristerniinae (Fasciolariidae), Lyriinae and Volutinae (Volutidae), and the Vasinae and Turbinellinae (Turbinellidae). On the other hand, a tropically-derived component did occur within the Transmarian area and this included the bivalve genera Divalinga (Lucinidae), Iphigenia (Donacidae), Strigilla (Tellinidae), and Carditamera (Carditidae) (Martin, 1904; Ward, 1998"
