        "text": "United States of America Shipping\n\nOrders for this Ascend RPM unit which qualify for Free Super-Saver Shipping are shipped at our discretion via the lowest cost method. We use FedEx, UPS, and US Postal Service as shipping carriers. We cannot ship this Ascend RPM within the USA by billing directly to your shipper account number. All shipping charges must be pre-paid at checkout.\n\nInternational / Foreign Shipping\n\nAscend RPM Cascade Communications units which are shipped internationally have a mandatory 4-10 business day security holding period between payment being received and shipment processing. This security policy is to allow funds to fully clear our bank account. International transport costs can be charged directly to your FedEx or UPS account number. We cannot ship internationally using your TNT account number; however you can coordinate with TNT to have them pick up the shipment from our location.\n\nExpedited and Rush Shipping\n\nHardwareJet.com can usually provide expedited (1 or 2 day shipping) for Ascend products; however there is an additional rush fee per unique Ascend RPM Cascade Communications unit in addition to the product cost and expedited carrier shipping charges. If we can offer expedited shipping for an item, expedited shipping costs will be shown at checkout. If we cannot provide expedited shipping for an item, then you will not be presented with these options during the cart checkout process."
