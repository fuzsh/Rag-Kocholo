        "text": "Since its inception, Ray Pasquale has been the driving force behind Unified Office’s robust growth and its ability to forge valuable alliances. With a rich background in serving telecom industry giants like Cascade Communications, Ascend Communications, Lucent Technologies, and Sonus Networks, Ray brought a wealth of expertise and experience to the company.\n\nThe Journey of Unified Office\n\nUnified Office was born out of Ray Pasquale’s vision of making geographic distance irrelevant in an increasingly virtualized business landscape. To achieve this, the company first focused on making Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) work reliably, eliminating the need for expensive legacy techniques like T1 phone circuits. Once this reliability was achieved, Unified Office aimed to leverage VoIP services to benefit small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nIn the early 2000s, many VoIP and Unified Communications (UC) companies disrupted the pricing of the legacy PBX phone market but offered little innovation. They centralized a PBX in the cloud to handle subscribers independent of location through VoIP desk phones. However, the Internet’s limitations for real-time applications like voice communication resulted in issues related to quality and reliability. Unified Office transformed this market by providing a unique architecture based on the team’s collective 150 years of experience in telecommunications and data networking. Their executive team designed protocols, built scalable products, and deployed carrier-grade equipment in large converged networks worldwide.\n\nWhat Sets Unified Office Apart\n\nUnified Office stands out in the market for several reasons:\n\nReliability: Unified Office offers the highest quality and most reliable VoIP service available, eliminating the need for expensive legacy T1 or MPLS circuits.\n\nCustomization: The company provides a range of customized features and vertical market applications, ensuring that businesses never lose opportunities due to missed calls, especially during peak call times.\n\nInnovation: Unified Office’s services are highly customizable and based on open-source systems that continually evolve, preventing obsolescence.\n\nOperational Excellence: They focus on developing pragmatic solutions and products that positively impact their customers’ operations and financial performance.\n\nReal-Time Data Analytics and IoT: Unified Office helps improve operational excellence through real-time data analytics, IoT, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) products and services.\n\nBusiness Continuity: The company is renowned for offering the highest level of business continuity and reliability, minimizing downtime and revenue losses with multiple levels of network resilience, including LTE broadband backup and PSTN failover.\n\nUnified Office’s Offerings\n\nUnified Office’s suite of business communication offerings includes:\n\nTotal Connect NowSM (TCNSM): Business quality VoIP and UC services designed for companies that can’t afford to miss calls.\n\nVisual Performance SuiteTM: Advanced business analytics to help businesses gain insights into their operations.\n\nTCNOPSTM (Total Connect Now Operations Performance SuiteTM): An IoT service layer that monitors and reports on various equipment, such as refrigeration equipment for restaurant customers.\n\nTCNIQTM: An AI solution that detects customer sentiment in recorded calls, saving time compared to manual call listening.\n\nVirtual Communications ConsoleTM: A virtual operator console that integrates with practice management software and other vertical market CRM solutions.\n\nVisual Call Flow BuilderTM: A visual graphical user interface that allows customers and resellers to build, design, and manage their call flows.\n\nTCNOMSTM (Total Connect Now Operations Management SuiteTM): A user-friendly portal that enables customers to manage and configure their services themselves from anywhere.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities\n\nUnified Office has faced challenges typical of rapidly growing companies. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the strengths of their platform, allowing them to help customers transition to remote work environments swiftly. They also developed contactless pickup and delivery services for restaurant customers.\n\nRay Pasquale emphasizes that while digital transformation is important, it must achieve meaningful results for people to matter. Unified Office’s core mission is to help businesses monetize their communication services and solve unique problems. They do this by providing reliable voice communication and developing value-added services and products that enhance business operations.\n\nFostering Creativity and Innovation\n\nUnified Office takes pride in providing a work environment that values open communication, collaboration across teams, and encourages employees to think creatively.

This network platform revolutionizes the transmission of reliable, high-quality, real-time business-class voice communications over broadband networks.\n\nThe company has received numerous awards for innovation from esteemed organizations, including Light Reading, TMCnet, Computer Reseller News, ChannelVision Magazine, NH Business Review, Compass Intelligence, MD Tech Review, Insight Success, Silicon 70, and CEO Views, among others.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nUnified Office is committed to evolving and transforming the communications marketplace, helping businesses adapt to unprecedented market changes. Ray Pasquale stresses that meaningful innovation and customization, coupled with market differentiation, are essential to delivering top and bottom-line results for customers. As the company continues to thrive, it aims to make the most of its position in a world marked by real-time, hyper-connected communication and an ever-increasing pace of change."
