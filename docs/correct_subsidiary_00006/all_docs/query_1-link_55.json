        "text": "Top Notch Experienced Management Team Receives $23 Million in Funding, Taps Top Design Team to Deliver Next Generation IP-Based Central Office Switches.\n\nWESTFORD, Mass., November 23, 1998 – Sonus Networks, developers of the next generation of carrier grade IP Telephony, today announced its formation and entry into the high-end IP Telephony Switch market. Sonus Networks has received $23 million in preliminary capital to fund the development and delivery of products that interconnect the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and carrier IP networks and that meet the stringent requirements of new and traditional carriers.\n\nThe company also disclosed that it has named former Ascend Senior Executive Hassan Ahmed as President and CEO. Ahmed is well-known among service provider organizations for his understanding of carrier technology issues and his ability to drive organizations toward products that meet their particular needs.\n\n\"The telecommunications industry has come to a consensus that the future belongs to the converged network - a single managed IP network that supports both voice and data,\" said Ahmed. \"Previously announced IP Telephony products, while perhaps suitable for small scale deployments, have neither the capabilities nor the performance to meet the much broader requirements of major carriers and ISPs. These organizations must more rapidly define and deliver competitive new user services, substantially scale the size of their networks to improve their support for escalating IP call volumes and new applications such as multi-media, manage the flow of traffic among their existing circuit switched and new IP based traffic paths, and significantly improve the economics of service delivery. Sonus Networks' mission is to enable carriers to substantially improve their central office infrastructure and remain viable in this aggressive new market.\"\n\n\"Sonus has a clear early leadership position in the carrier-grade IP telephony market,\" said Rubin Gruber, Chairman and co-founder. \"The opportunity in this market is reflected in the emergence of several major new IP-based carriers and announced plans by established carriers to migrate voice traffic to IP networks. Sonus is in a unique position to capitalize on the opportunity to provide true carrier-grade IP telephony equipment that meets this important new telecommunications market requirement.\"\n\nSonus Networks has received preliminary funding of $23 million from some of the telecommunications industry's most successful and well-respected venture capital firms, including: Bedrock, Charles River Ventures, Matrix Partners, North Bridge Venture Partners, and Bessemer Venture Partners.\n\nTop Industry Talent Positions Sonus for IP Telephony Success\n\nThe Sonus executive team is comprised of exceptionally experienced professionals, including\n\nRubin Gruber, Chairman and co-founder, previously founder of VideoServer (Nasdaq - VSVR), Davox (Nasdaq - DAVX), and Cambridge Telecommunications, acquired by GTE (NYSE - GTE);\n\nHassan Ahmed, Ph.D., President and CEO, most recently Executive Vice President and General Manager of Ascend Communications' (ASND) Core Systems Division.
