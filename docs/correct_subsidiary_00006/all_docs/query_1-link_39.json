        "text": "Curious if anyone has had recent experience with CentryLink for commercial service.\n\nI have a customer order 100Mb service, and on the order paperwork they clearly specified a floor in a high rise for demarcation. Well CentryLink demarked in the basement and said ‘tough’ Even when confronted with the paperwork, they say \" We only ask to determine the MPOE, we cannot disclose demark location until the work is complete\" REALY ?! you cant tell someone where you will install service until after you do it ? Are you F-ing serious ?\n\nI reviewed the paperwork and I cant find anywhere they even state the demark will be the MPOE\n\nThey also installed as an Ethernet port in the basement of the high rise building. I contend ‘no one in a high rise should be getting a copper port if your demark is on the ground floor’\n\nCentryLink very plainly said ‘not our problem’ they refuse to extend the DEMARC or cancel the contract. I really thought after we present the paperwork with original location instructions , they would at least say \"our bad, sorry, you can walk if you don’t want to get the demark extended… \" but they did not.\n\nI’ve never heard a vendor so stubborn.\n\nAnyone had experience with them ?\n\nWhat we have here is a situation where the sales rep just did not make clear how the LEC installs fiber into a high rise. Unfortunately it is common place for the LEC to install fiber service to the MPOE / Demarc and then customer responsibility to extend. High rises get even more complex due to expensive riser costs. The higher up you go, the more $$$.\n\nIf you did not know that going in, this would be a shock of course. The tough luck part is that it is just part of the contract and it was a misunderstanding.\n\nI know not what you want to hear…\n\nWho did you work with to order service? Was it some sales rep or did you work with a telecom broker/agent/advisor etc?\n\nThis is what we do all day for our clients, but you better believe that we talk about the looming extension costs. In fact, when comparing different pricing and ISP’s in high rise buildings, YOU HAVE to make sure you are looking at the all in price. Many of the Tier 1 Fiber players will include the extensions in the costs.\n\nIf you need some estimates on the extension work, we can help you with some options. But next time call us when reviewing Telecom projects. (voice, data, cloud, colo etc.). You will want someone on your side at the beginning, middle and end. Until you get into these situations, you will never know just how important it is to have an advocate by your side.\n\nNot to mention the better pricing and support etc.\n\nReach out if you ever need help.\n\nThis is what I have experienced with Century Link over the years. I went to setup a new MPLS circuit at a client site last last year and when I met with the tech I asked him what the timeline was for the test and turn up. He told me that he could not send in the paperwork for the test and turn up till the equipment was installed but that the equipment could not be installed till he was given a date for the test and turn up. He ended up installing the equipment anyway because he pointed out to me that yes this way of doing things is bonkers. We made it to the test and turn up and in the end all did work out.\n\nI want to place praise where it is due; The CL tech was very professional and communicated with me even after hours to let me know what was going on during this setup. He even gave me his cell number so I could text him so we could be on the same page for this install.\n\nI had another encounter with CL some years earlier where I was contracted to assist in troubleshooting a 10/10 internet connection. During this all night callout, and I do mean all night I was on a bridge call with my client (a major food franchise) and CL and by the end of the evening it was determined by CL that the issue required a tech to be sent out. CL said they could have a tech out in three weeks. There is a main office here in our town with CL techs but they never did say why it would take three weeks.\n\nIn general I do not recommend Century Link to my customers. I do recommend Spectrum because even though they have many short comings they do try and honor their agreements with their clients even if it means replacing the same cable modem three times in one week.\n\nI have not had any recent interaction from CL with the exception of trying to get data to our new location for the corporate office out in the boonies 4 years ago. The CL sales people were all smiles and sunshine stating that they can get everything we need at the new location. I kept on them regarding status on an almost daily basis until one day, probably 6 weeks before the move and they state that they cannot provide service at the new location…WTF!! I am pissed, I have already signed a contract for services they cannot deliver. Rep state that it would be a $500K buildout to bring fiber to the location…WTF again. I am pretty much in panic mode and get everything cancelled and did find a provider with fiber about 60 yards down the street and they have ZERO to do with reselling CL services like all the other vendors. 2K to trench and terminate and I am a happy boy.\n\nNeedless to say when CL stated they now have service in the area I to do a hard pass. I am happy even though I am paying around 2K a month for 20/20 and it rarely goes down.\n\nI wouldn’t say the rep is working on it.\n\nThe communication I shared came only after Mr. McKnight berated myself and the customer for 38 minutes saying “We only do EXACTLY what you tell us to do”, We are a big company, we do this all the time, We do things differently than other providers because we are bigger than them\"\n\nBut overwhelmingly, the tone was simply \" This is all your fault\"\n\nAfter that call was when the customer found the paperwork. French fired off that email, but even that response came back \" no \"\n\nWhen the customer pointed out specific instructions were given for demarcation placement the reply was :\n\nThe reason that we ask where the demarc is located is so that the designer will design the circuit to the closet MPOE to the customers demark (if there are multiple MPOE’s in the building). The documentation you attached states that it is the Customer’s responsibility to Perform the Inside Wiring:\n\n\" The reason that we ask where the demarc is located is so that the designer will design the circuit to the closet MPOE to the customers demark (if there are multiple MPOE’s in the building). The documentation you attached states that it is the Customer’s responsibility to Perform the Inside Wiring\"\n\nI would agree in that the customer expected ‘inside wiring’ to be from the instructed point of demarcation into the suite. NOT to the basement.\n\nAgain - that screen shot is what CL sent BACK to ‘confirm’ Someone SHOULD have read that highlighted line and said ‘Wait a minute… We cant really be putting a copper Ethernet connection in the basement, These guys are expecting right outside there suite’ They should have contacted the customer at that point, and they didn’t.\n\nIn my not so humble opinion, that is an egregious oversight.\n\nAll things being said, I understand NOW, they simply don’t demark beyond the MPOE ( THEY NEED TO TELL PEOPLE THAT) and while I don’t expect them to eat the extension cost, I DO expect them to be adults, and say ‘Yes, we clearly over looked that. Sorry. If you want to cancel, no penalty’\n\nAs of right now, they are saying \" not our fault at all, full cancelation fees\" ( and that $$ could buy a small car)"
