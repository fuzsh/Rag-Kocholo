Altered CREB Binding to Activity-dependent Genes in Serine Racemase Deficient Mice, a Mouse Model of Schizophrenia\n\nDarrick Balu*, Joseph Coyle\n\nHarvard University, McLean Hospital, Belmont, Massachusetts\n\nBackground: cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor in the brain that regulates neuroplasticity by modulating gene expression. There are numerous signaling pathways by which information is transmitted from the cell membrane to the nucleus that in turn affects CREB binding to DNA. The influx of calcium through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is a well-defined mechanism that leads to the increased expression of CREB-dependent genes, including brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), microRNA-132 (miR132), and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). We have previously demonstrated that serine racemase knockout (SR-/-) mice, which exhibit NMDAR hypofunction, also have reduced mRNA and protein levels of the aforementioned CREB-dependent genes in the hippocampus. In addition, these molecules are reduced in schizophrenia.\n\nMethods: Wild-type (WT; n=5-6) and SR-/- (n=5) mice were killed and their hippocampi were flash frozen on dry ice. Tissue samples were dissociated and then fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde. Chromatin was digested using the SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling Technologies). The chromatin was incubated with a rabbit anti-CREB antibody (1:50; Cell Signaling Technologies) overnight at 4Â°C on a rotisserie. The crosslinks were reversed and the DNA was purified for analysis using qPCR (Sybr Green). To determine the levels of CREB bound at each gene of interest, PCR primers were directed near the CRE sequence of each promoter. All of the primers were validated in previous publications. Melting temperature analysis was performed after every PCR to ensure accuracy.\n\nResults: We first validated the ChIP kit for brain tissue using a positive control antibody and primers to ensure proper chromatin shearing. SR-/- mice have approximately 50% less CREB binding at the miR-132 gene than WT mice. Using BDNF exon-specific primers, SR-/- mice have significantly less CREB binding at the BDNF I promoter, but not at the BDNF IV promoter. Finally, SR-/- mice have 80% less CREB binding to the synaptic activity response element (SARE) region of the Arc gene.\n\nConclusions: These data demonstrate that in vivo, NMDAR hypofunction caused by the selective removal of the NMDAR co-agonist, D-serine, leads to altered CREB binding on known activity-dependent genes. The ChIP results suggest that reduced CREB binding contributes to the lower levels of BDNF, miR-132, and Arc that we previously observed in SR-/- mice. Future studies will determine whether D-serine administration, which reverses these abnormalities at the RNA and protein level, also normalizes the epigenetic perturbations.\n\nKeywords: CREB, Arc, BDNF, miR132.\n\nDisclosure: JTC served as a consultant for EnVivo and Abbvie in the last 2 years. A patent owned by MGH for the use of D-serine as a treatment for serious mental illness could yield royalties for Dr. Coyle.\n\nT2. Wnt Signaling, Neurodevelopmental, and Behavioral Phenotypes in a Dixdc1 Knock-out Mouse Model of Psychiatric Illness\n\nBenjamin Cheyette*, Robert Stanley, Pierre-Marie Martin\n\nUniversity of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California\n\nBackground: DIXDC1 encodes a scaffold protein enriched in neurons that physically interacts with the DISC1 protein implicated in major mental illness, as well as with the Dishevelled protein central to Wnt/beta-catenin intercellular signaling. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is broadly involved in neural development and for this reason has been considered a pontential pathogenic neurodevelopmental pathway in psychiatric illness. Moreover, GSK3, the central kinase in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, is a pharmacological target of lithium at therapeutic doses. Recent human genetic studies have buttressed interest in this pathway by showing that loss-of-function mutations in the CHD8 gene, which up-regulate Wnt/beta-catenin pathway target genes, are a susceptibility factor in the autism spectrum disorders.\n\nMethods: We have generated a Dixdc1 knock-out (KO) mouse line using traditional (homologous recombination) gene-targeting techniques. We have analyzed and compared behavior in littermates homozygous for the wild type Dixdc1 locus, heterozygous, or homozygous for the Dixdc1 KO allele. We have tested the response of behavioral differences in these animals to psychopharmacological agents, including lithium. We have also analyzed neurodevelopmental phenotypes in the brains of these animals and in cultured forebrain (hippocampal) neurons. Separately, we have been probing for SNVs at the DIXDC1 locus in human psychiatric patients (both in our own samples and in publicly-available sequence databases) and are testing these for functional differences in assays of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and in assays based on phenotypic findings in this knock-out mouse model.\n\nResults: Mice homozygous for loss-of-function at the Dixdc1 locus are viable, fertile, and grossly normal in development. In extended (unpublished) behavioral assays we have found that loss-of-function at the Dixdc1 locus leads to a specific dose-sensitive behavioral deficit: reduced motivation (Forced Swim and Tail Suspension tests). This deficit is responsive to correction by acute administration of either lithium or a specific GSK3-inhibitor. We have concurrently found that forebrain pyramidal neurons from Dixdc1 knock-out animals have reduced dendritic spines and glutamatergic synapses - tests of the response of this synapse phenotype to lithium and to pharmacological GSK3 inhibition are ongoing at the time of this abstract. Unlike some other Wnt signal scaffold proteins that we have studied previously, loss of Dixdc1 does not lead to more generally reduced dendrite complexity as quantified by Sholl analysis, nor to changes in inhibitory synaptic markers. Excitatory synapse phenotypes in the mouse KO can be rescued by expression of a wild type human DIXDC1 cDNA.\n\nConclusions: Our data support a role for the Dixdc1 protein in the generation and maintenance of excitatory synapses in the forebrain. Our data further suggest that this occurs downstream of activity in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway within developing neurons. Behavioral consequences of Dixdc1 inactivation in mice are relatively specific for motivation and can be reversed by lithium administration or by pharmacologically-specific GSK3 inhibition. This supports a role for this protein and for its associated pathway in major affective disorders and their pharmacological treatment. Using this animal model, we are testing for differences in the signaling and neurodevelopmental activities of DIXDC1 SNVs found in psychiatric patients. Our studies provide independent support for the contribution of abnormal Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway activation during neural development to psychiatric pathogenesis.\n\nKeywords: Wnt signaling, Excitatory Synapses, Motivation, Lithium.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT3. Toward an Understanding of Eating Disorders: Are PVH PACAP Neurons an Interface Between Stress Response and Feeding Behavior?\n\nRachel Ross*, Michael Krashes, Bhavik Shah, Bradford Lowell\n\nHarvard Medical School/Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts\n\nBackground: Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuromodulator implicated in human anxiety and feeding behavior. Notably, high expression of PACAP is found in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), a region known to be involved metabolism and coordinating sympathetic activation. Furthermore, mouse knock out models of PACAP, and of single minded-1 (sim-1), a protein that is required for development of the PVH, display behaviors that point to a potential role in both anxiety and eating disorders. However, the PACAP-expressing neurons of the PVH have yet to be examined in this regard. We are harnessing genetic tools that focus on PACAP neurocircuitry in the PVH to investigate whether PVH PACAP neurons, and PACAP itself, serve as an interface for the integration of stress and feeding related signals.\n\nMethods: Taking advantage of cre-lox technology we have devised two approaches to investigate the importance of PACAP neurons in the PVH. First, we generated knock-in mice expressing cre-recombinase under the control of the PACAP promotor. The PACAP-cre mice facilitate real time manipulation of PACAP expressing neurons, through neuroanatomically directed viral injections conferring expression of chemogenetic tools. These neurons are then stimulated or inhibited by intraparenchymal injection of the otherwise inert molecule, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). The same animals injected with saline serve as controls, and data is analyzed by paired t-test. In our second approach, we created lox-PACAP mice that possess loxP sites flanking the 2nd exon of the PACAP gene, allowing for deletion of functional PACAP in the presence of cre-recombinase. The PACAP-lox mice were bred with Sim1-cre mice to induce the conditional knock-out of PACAP within the PVH in order to discern the specific effect of PACAP in the circuit. Mice were subjected to assays for energy homeostasis and anxiety, and compared to littermate controls using ANOVA.\n\nResults: Acute chemogenetic stimulation of paraventricular hypothalamic PACAP neurons caused an 2.5x increase in food intake during the light cycle, when animals do not normally eat, and a trend toward increased anxiety like behavior, evidenced by less time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Conditional knock out animals lacking PACAP in Sim1-expressing neurons show a small, but significant, increase in body weight (â¼10%), as well as a trend to decrease anxiety-like behavior.\n\nConclusions: Stimulation of PVH PACAP neurons leads to hyperphagia and increased anxiety, while knock out of PACAP from the same neurons leads to weight gain and decreased anxiety-like behavior. The non-reciprocal difference in behavioral effects of stimulating synaptic transmission versus effects of genetic knock out of PACAP in the same neurons points to the complex role neuromodulators play in neuronal communication. This circuitry may be important in understanding the genesis of eating disorders, as well as phenotypic differences in feeding behavior seen in anxiety and mood disorders.\n\nKeywords: eating disorders, energy homeostasis, PACAP, PVH.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT4. Stem Cell Therapy as a Candidate Treatment Approach for Neural Plasticity Change in Refractory Depression\n\nToshikazu Saito*, Wataru Ukai, Yoshiyasu Kigawa, Takao Ishi, Kengo Furuse, Hanako Tsujino, Masaya Tayama, Eri Hashimoto\n\nSapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan\n\nBackground: Repeated exposure to environmental adversity during development can cause treatment resistant, refractory depression. Although genetic research has revealed that the vulnerability to depression is partially heritable, there is also strong support for the pathogenic role of early environmental adversity in the development and expression of this disorder. Prenatal alcohol exposure has been identified as a potential risk factor for refractory depression and a high rate of comorbid depression has been reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) patients. Stem cell-based regenerative therapy is considered a promising cellular therapeutic approach for some patients with incurable brain diseases. Previously, we found that intravenous neural stem cell (NSC) treatment reversed impaired memory/cognitive function and social interaction behaviors in rats tested using a fetal alcohol exposure-induced psychiatric disorder model.\n\nMethods: In this study, we tested this approach to treat the refractory type of depression model rats caused by the combined stress exposures to prenatal ethanol and adolescent corticosterone treatments.\n\nResults: We showed that aspects of depressive-like behavior resulting from a forced swim test were reversed by the combined treatment of an antidepressant and the intravenous administration of fetal rat brain derived NSCs with atelocollagen which was used for reducing immune rejection and for potentiate effective migration of administrated cells into the brain. In addition, we showed that alterations of PV-containing GABAergic interneurons and synaptic density protein levels resulting from the combined treatment of antidepressant and NSCs in this model.\n\nConclusions: Our results established a new role for PV-containing GABAergic interneurons associated with treatment resistant, refractory depression-like behavior in rats and suggested possible new therapeutic options of stem cell therapies for treating refractory types of psychiatric disorders.\n\nKeywords: depression, neural stem cell, regenerative therapy, fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\nDisclosure: Suntory.\n\nT5. Novel Role of Microtubules in the Dysregulation of Reward Learning By Cocaine\n\nErin Calipari*, Michael Cahil, Diane Damez-Werno, Deena Walker, Joseph Landry, Yasmin Hurd, Eric Nestler\n\nIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York\n\nBackground: Reward learning for natural reinforcers is robust, and cue presentation following periods of abstinence elicits seeking behavior for the previously paired reward. While reward learning for drugs is similar to natural rewards, abstinence results in seeking behavior that increases (âincubatesâ) with withdrawal. Incubation does not occur for natural rewards and highlights how drugs of abuse adapt normal learning mechanisms to exert potent control over motivated behaviors. Reward learning has been attributed to the formation of new synaptic connections on medium spiny neurons, and the mechanism by which this process occurs, and how it is dysregulated in addiction, is not well understood. Recently it was determined that microtubules play an integral role in dendritic spine structure/stability suggesting that they may have an important role in this process; however, their function in vivo as well as their role in learning has not previously been examined. Utilizing self-administration paired with viral approaches, we dissected the specific mechanisms driving microtubule signaling in spines and determined how these pathways converge to drive addictive behaviors.\n\nMethods: Animals were allowed to self-administer cocaine (0.8mg/kg/inj) or saline on a fixed-ratio one schedule of reinforcement for 10 consecutive days. Following a 24hr or 30 day withdrawal period, drug seeking was assessed and tissue was processed for neurochemical analysis. Western blot hybridization on the synaptic fraction was used to determine levels of the dendritic spine/microtubule associated proteins (MAPs): EB3, Î²-tubulin, Src kinase, and the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. Using confocal imagining and dendritic spine analysis, alterations in spine density and morphology in the NAc following cocaine exposure were determined. Further, the role of microtubule polymerization in the rewarding/reinforcing effects of cocaine was confirmed with behavioral analysis, whereby the microtubule inhibitor podophyllotoxin was infused directly into the NAc before daily conditioned place preference (CPP) sessions. Finally, viral-mediated gene transfer in self-administering animals was used to over-express targets (EB3 and Srcin1-a negative regulator of Src kinase) via HSV vectors to determine their effects on the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine.\n\nResults: Here we show that following cocaine self-administration and 24hr withdrawal Src phosphorylation at the active site (Y416) was increased, while microtubules and MAPs were unchanged. The initial increases in Src phosphorylation at 24hrs likely mediate the increased cocaine reinforcement observed at that time point, as overexpressing Srcin1 (which reduces Src activity) reduced the motivation to administer self-administer cocaine. Following longer withdrawal periods, Src phosphorylation returned to control levels, and levels of beta-tubulin and EB3 were elevated. Increases in EB3, a MAP that regulates microtubule polymerization, were positively correlated with cocaine intake during self-administration. Additionally, the increases in MAPs were associated with a cocaine intake-dependent increase in levels of NR2B, a traditional marker of dendritic spine stability. These changes likely regulate cocaine reward and reinforcement, as evidence by the ability of podophyllotoxin to reduce CPP for cocaine.\n\nConclusions: Here we show that following cocaine self-administration and withdrawal microtubule-associated signaling is increased and associated with cocaine intake and drug seeking behavior. We hypothesize that, cocaine self-administration leads to the formation of immature dendritic spines, and that during abstinence/withdrawal microtubule entry into spines enhances EB3-dependent signaling cascades leading to long-term stabilization of spines and enhanced cue-reward associations that incubate and drive addiction-related behaviors. Here we show that inhibiting microtubule polymerization reduces cocaine reward, suggesting that microtubule inhibitors, which are already FDA approved for a number of other conditions, may serve as efficacious pharmacotherapies to reduce drug seeking following prolonged withdrawal periods, and thus prevent relapse.\n\nKeywords: Self-Administration, Medium Spiny Neuron, Dendritic Spine, Cocaine.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT6. Translational Research Supporting the Relevance of PTRPG to the Etiology of Schizophrenia\n\nArnaud Cressant, Dolores Malaspina,* Jing Kong, Jacques Caliber, Jean-Marie Launay, Francoise Lazarini, Moses Chao, Sylvie Granon, Shiela Harroch\n\nNew York University School of Medicine, New York, New York\n\nBackground: PTRPG, a phosphatase of receptor protein tyrosine, is expressed in the CNS throughout vertebrate development and adulthood and plays important roles in adult synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. The gene had previously been linked to affective disorders and this translational study considered its relevance to schizophrenia.\n\nMethods: A de novo loss of function point mutation was discovered in PTRPG for a sporadic schizophrenia case compared to the parents using next generation sequencing in 11 parent-child trios derived from the Jerusalem Perinatal Schizophrenia Study as a nested sample. A leading mouse genetics group examined the phenotype of PTPRg-/- mice were compared to wild type mice.\n\nResults: Significant differences between PTPRg-/- and wild type mice were demonstrated in the mutants persistence in swimming in the forced swim test, longer latency to escape anxiogenic areas in the light/dark test, and decreased time exploring novel objects. These effects are consistent with perseverative behaviors and decreased emotional processing. These mice also demonstrated robustly elevated prefrontal and amygdala levels of 5-HT, DA and NA.\n\nConclusions: Findings that the knock out mice demonstrated reduced responsiveness to external social stimuli, motor deficits, enhanced sensory processing for acoustic stimuli and reduced performance with cued fear conditioning the robust evidence linking the mouse phenotype to the clinical picture of schizophrenia. However this translational collaboration bolsters support for the conclusion that this phosphatase gene is specifically relevant to behavior and that it is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia more comprehensively than either bench-top or bedside approaches could individually accomplish.\n\nKeywords: phosphatase, receptor tyrosine kinase, genetics, schizophrenia.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT7. Epigenetic Dysregulation of MEF2C in Schizophrenia\n\nAmanda Mitchell*, Venu Pothula, Erica Shen, W.E. Bunney Jr., Andree Lessard, Schahram Akbarian\n\nIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York\n\nBackground: Only about 2% of the human genome codes for protein and the remaining 98% harbor the majority of sequence variants and polymorphisms implicated in schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disease. Here, we use next generation sequencing to profile the epigenomic landscape of prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons from 17 subjects with schizophrenia (SCZ) and matched controls, focusing on trimethyl-histone H3-lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a mark sharply regulated at transcription start sites and a subject of enhancers and other additional cis-regulatory elements associated with gene expression.\n\nMethods: Neuronal (NeuN+) nuclei were collected from PFC and processed by ChIP-seq. ChIP-seq data was analyzed using bowtie, MACS, homer, and RSAT motifs. Motif analysis predicted variants of the MADS box transcription enhancer factor 2, polypeptide C, (MEF2C) motif from the differential peaks. MEF2C is an enhancer thought to function as a transcription factor important in cell fate and identify.\n\nResults: Altogether we identified 1331 up- and 637 down peaks in our SCZ cohort with a significant enrichment for sequences that matched variants of the MEF2C transcription factor motif. This included a risk-associated regulatory sequence of the MEF2C gene itself (rs16867576). SCZ subjects with increased H3K4me3 at the MEF2C promoter showed a significant decrease in MEF2C mRNA. Disease-associated H3K4me3 changes were enriched for gene categories related to cell-cell adhesion, synaptic membrane and postsynaptic signaling.\n\nConclusions: These results point to changes in the histone methylation landscape of PFC neurons in SCZ, affecting neuronal signaling and communication. Further work is necessary to explore whether epigenetic dysregulation of MEF2C could play a key role for PFC dysfunction in SCZ.\n\nKeywords: epigenetics, transcription factor, PFC, schizophrenia.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT8. Calsyntenin-3: Molecular Architecture and Interaction with Neurexin 1alpha\n\nZhuoyang Lu, Yun Wang, Fang Chen, Huimin Tong, Sekhar Reddy, Lin Luo, Suchithra Seshadrinathan, Lei Zhang, Luis Marcelo Holthauzen, Ann Marie Craig, Gang Ren, Gabrielle Rudenko*\n\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas\n\nBackground: Calsyntenin 3 (Cstn3 or Clstn3) is a recently identified synaptic organizer that promotes synapse development. Cstn3 localizes to the postsynaptic membrane and triggers presynaptic differentiation of inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Cstn3 knockout mice show decreased inhibitory and excitatory synaptic densities and deficits in synaptic transmission. Importantly, calsyntenin members play a role in memory and learning. Cstn3 was recently shown to interact with neurexin 1alpha in cell-based assays (1). Neurexins are synaptic organizers implicated in diseases such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, and they play an essential role in synapse maturation and synaptic transmission. Alpha-neurexins are tethered predominantly to the presynaptic membrane, and their extracellular domains interact with many partners in the synaptic cleft, including neuroligins, LRRTM family members, alpha-dystroglycan, latrophilin, cerebellins, neurexophilin and the GABAA-receptor. The interaction between Cstn3 and n1alpha is contentious however (2) and it is not clear if these molecules bind directly to form a trans-synaptic complex promoting synaptic differentiation.\n\nMethods: We used a combination of biochemical, biophysical and structural methods to gain insight into the structure and function of Cstn3 and its interaction with n1alpha. We used biochemical and cell-based assays to probe the molecular state of Cstn3. We used a combination of electron microscopy and tomography to reveal the architecture of purified Cstn3 ectodomains. Finally, we tested the direct interaction between Cstn3 and n1alpha using solid phase binding, surface plasmon resonance and cell-based assays.\n\nResults: We show that the Cstn3 ectodomain forms monomers as well as tetramers. While the Cstn3 monomer is flexible, adopting more open or more closed conformations, the Cstn3 tetramer is more fixed and resembles an unopened flower. We show further that the extracellular domains of Cstn3 and n1alpha interact directly and that both Cstn3 monomers and tetramers bind n1alpha with nanomolar affinity. Furthermore, Cstn3 uses a fundamentally different mechanism to bind n1alpha compared to other neurexin partners such as the synaptic organizer neuroligin.\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest how Cstn3 as a synaptic organizer on the postsynaptic membrane, particularly in the tetrameric form, may assemble radially symmetric trans-synaptic bridges with the presynaptic synaptic organizer n1alpha to recruit and spatially organize proteins into networks essential for synaptic function. These trans-synaptic complexes involve proteins that are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and regulate crucial functional neuronal circuits. By studying the molecular interactions between molecules that guide inhibitory and/or excitatory synapse formation we hope in future to identify new therapeutic targets that could be leveraged for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Molecular Mechanisms of Opiate-induced Plasticity\n\nDavid Dietz*, Gabrielle Schroeder, Kevin Braunscheidel, Clarisse Panganiban, Amy Gancarz\n\nState University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York\n\nBackground: Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse causes morphologic changes to neurons within the mesolimbic dopamine circuitry. There is a great deal of evidence demonstrating that chronic psychostimulant exposure increases the number dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens. In contrast, exposure to opioids such as morphine and heroin, which similarly induce behavioral sensitization, leads to a decrease in dendritic spine density. However, there is minimal data regarding the molecular events that regulate this opiate-induced plasticity.\n\nMethods: To examine the molecular mechanisms of dendritic spine plasticity following behavioral sensitization to a morphine regimen (10 mg/kg daily) or heroin self-administration (0.075 mg/kg/infusion), tissue punches from several brain regions were collected and analyzed for mRNA, protein and chromatin regulation.\n\nResults: Following opiate-induced behavioral sensitization and heroin self-administration, there is a decrease in the expression of the actin bundling protein drebrin. This decrease results from an increase in hdac2 expression and a concordant decrease in H3 acetylation at the transcriptional start site of the drebrin promoter.\n\nConclusions: These results implicate epigenetic control of cytoskeletal protein regulation as a mechanism for opiate-induced morphologic changes. Ongoing studies are examining in more depth the critical functional role of hdac2 and drebrin in the regulation of structural, cellular and behavioral plasticity in response to repeated opiate exposure.\n\nKeywords: opiates, self-administration, dendritic spines, sensitization.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT10. A New Roadmap for Brain Development: Regionally Specialized Astrocytes in Neural Circuit Formation and Function\n\nAnna Victoria Molofsky*, Kevin Kelley, Hui Hsin Tsai, Sergio Baranzini, Eric Ullian, David Rowitch\n\nUniversity of California San Francisco, Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute, San Francisco, California\n\nBackground: Neural circuits form over a prolonged period of developmental time, during which the brain expands dramatically in size. How is positional information maintained throughout development, ensuring the accuracy and specificity of neural circuit formation? Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, are implicated in a growing number of neurodevelopmental diseases, including autism-associated syndromes (Rett and Fragile X), depression, and neurodegenerative disease. While astrocytes are known to support neurons by performing housekeeping functions in the mature brain, their normal role during development is unclear. A major obstacle has been understanding whether astrocytes are heterogeneous, and if so, what might distinguish astrocyte subtypes at a molecular or functional level. We discovered that astrocytes in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) are different âfrom birthâ as a result of embryonic patterning. Here we show that developing region-restricted astrocytes are molecularly and functionally specialized. Using the mouse spinal cord sensorimotor circuit as a model, I demonstrate that astrocytes in the 'sensory' and 'motor' portions of the circuits are molecularly distinct, and encode multiple positional cues such as the guidance molecule Semaphorin3a (Sema3a.) Deletion of this gene from astrocytes led to defects in axon guidance and neuronal polarity, followed by neuronal dysfunction, altered excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance, and neuronal death. Thus, this novel form of astrocyte functional heterogeneity is essential for normal neural circuit development. Further investigating this critical function of astrocytes could shed light on aberrant neural circuit development in diseases like autism, schizophrenia, and many others.\n\nMethods: To test whether astrocytes in different regions of the developing mouse CNS are molecularly and/or functionally heterogeneous, I focused on the spinal cord sensorimotor circuit â the simplest monosynaptic circuit in the CNS, which is functionally divided into dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) areas. Using the transgenic mouse line Aldh1l1-eGFP (Gensat), I isolated astrocytes and non-astrocytes from dorsal and ventral spinal cord at postnatal day 7 by flow cytometry. Using affymetrix microarray gene chips (Mouse Gene 1.0) were used for gene expression profiling, we identified differential expression of numerous axon guidance and extracellular matrix molecules, including the guidance cue semaphorin3a (Sema3a), which is expressed in ventral radial glia and ventral astrocytes, but not dorsal astrocytes from mid embryogenesis through early postnatal development (E14.5-P14). Further experiments focused on the role of Sema3a in sensorimotor circuit development. In vivo approaches include conditional deletion of Sema3a from developing astrocytes using Aldh1l1-cre and the human GFAP cre (hGFAPcre) transgenic lines, both of which were astrocyte-specific in the spinal cord. In vitro work utilized astrocyte-neuronal cocultures. Dorsal and ventral spinal cords at P0-P1 were cultured at high density in the presence of serum to generate astrocyte monolayers, which retained differential expression of Sema3a. Sensory neurons from mouse E13.5 dorsal root ganglia, or rat embryonic motorneurons were isolated and cocultured with astrocytes. In some experiments, recombinant Sema3a was added to motor neurons in culture.\n\nResults: Ventral and dorsal astrocytes differentially expressed numerous genes, many of which were extracellular matrix genes or guidance cues, including Epha5 (Eph receptor A5), reelin, and Sema3a. Sema3a was ventral-astrocyte encoded from mid-embryogenesis until at least postnatal day 15. Sema3a deletion in radial glia and immature astrocytes via Aldh1l1-cre led to abnormal ventral extension of DRG sensory axons and perinatal lethality. Loss of astrocyte-encoded Sema3a led to motor neuron misorientation with respect to the ventral root, as evidenced by abnormal positioning of axon initial segments. Sema3a deletion from astrocytes using the hGFAPcre led to a less penetrant phenotype: these mice that survived into adulthood. hGFAPcreSema3a fl/fl mice had motor neuron misorientation and abnormal dendritogenesis. Later in development they had altered excitatory/inhibitory balance, including decreased vglut1 and increased VGAT puncta on ventral motor neurons, which was confirmed electrophysiologically (decreased excitatory post synaptic currents and increased inhibitory postsynaptic currents.) Motor neurons were also hyperexcitable after loss of astrocyte-encoded Sema3a. By adulthood, there was a two-fold loss of large alpha-motor neurons. To confirm that there were direct effects of astrocyte-encoded Sema3a on motor neurons, we performed a series of coculture experiments. Dorsoventral differences in region restricted astrocytes were maintained in culture. Furthermore, Sema3a dependent differences in axon outgrowth were also evident when dorsal or ventral astrocytes were cocultured with DRG neurons. Ventral spinal cord astrocytes also repelled motor neuron axons in a Sema3a dependent manner. Recombinant Sema3a had a dose-dependent effect on motor neuron survival that was correlated with its effects on neuronal polarization.\n\nConclusions: Strikingly, many well-known guidance cues are encoded and maintained by astrocytes well into postnatal life. I identified a panel of genes differentially expressed by dorsal and ventral astrocytes, and tested the functional roles of one of these astrocyte-encoded genes: the guidance molecule Semaphorin 3a. I found that this astrocyte encoded positional cue played key roles in neural circuit refinement, including guiding axons, orienting neurons, promoting dendritogenesis, maintaining excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance, and ultimately promoting neuronal survival. These data demonstrate that developing astrocytes are a positional scaffold that maintains guidance cues during the key developmental period of synaptogenesis and neural circuit refinement. Thus, astrocytes play a key role in normal circuit formation. This suggests that defects in astrocyte positional encoding could potentially contribute to a wide array of neurodevelopmental diseases, including autism and schizophrenia, diseases of synaptogenesis for which neuroanatomical substrates are not well understood.\n\nKeywords: glia, astrocytes, neural circuits, autism.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT11. Role of Hippocampal ÎFosB in Spatial Learning and Cocaine Responses\n\nAndrew Eagle, Paula Gajewski, A.J. Robison*\n\nMichigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan\n\nBackground: The hippocampus is necessary for learned associations between the environmental context and salient stimuli, including drugs of abuse. In addition, stimulation of the hippocampus causes enhanced mesolimbic dopamine function, suggesting that the hippocampus may play a role in both drug acquisition and in drug reward. However, it is unknown how chronic exposure to drugs alters hippocampal gene expression and function, and whether such alterations may underlie the aberrant valuation of drugs and the strong associations of drugs with environmental cues that comprise the addiction phenotype. Although the transcription factor ÎFosB is induced in the hippocampus by chronic drug exposure, and its expression in other brain regions regulates drug reward, the role of ÎFosB in hippocampal function remains unknown. Therefore, we explored the induction and function of ÎFosB in the hippocampus. Using viral-mediated overexpression or inhibition of ÎFosB in the dorsal hippocampus, we sought to determine the role of ÎFosB in general learning, association of cocaine with environment, and hippocampal cell morphology and physiology.\n\nMethods: Male, C57Bl6/J mice from Jackson Labs were used in this study and all experiments were performed in accordance with Michigan State University IACUC-approved protocols. Behavioral assays were performed 21-23 d post-surgery in AAV studies and 1-3 d post-surgery in HSV studies. Novel object recognition was performed over three days (1 hr habituation day 1, 30 min acquisition day 2, 5 min testing day (3) in a square white polyvinylchloride foam box (38 cm x 38 cm x 35 cm). Contextual fear conditioning was performed in an operant chamber (Coulbourn Instruments) using 3 mild electric footshocks (0.8 mA, 1 sec) and the following day freezing behavior was video-scored by a blind, independent observer. Temporally dissociated passive avoidance was assessed over 5 days in a light-dark passive avoidance chamber (Coulbourn Instruments). Footshock (0.8 mA, 2 sec) was delivered 5 min after entry into the dark chamber. Conditioned place preference was performed in custom 3-chambered boxes (San Diego Instruments), with two days of 5 mg/kg cocaine pairing. ÎFosB immunohistochemistry was visualized using DAB staining (SC-48 antibody, Santa Cruz), and ÎFosB Western blotting used the 5G4 antibody (Cell Signaling). Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed from nuclear fractions with micrococcal nuclease digestion using antibodies against various histone marks (AbCam, Millipore). Viral vectors were purchased from the Viral Gene Transfer Core at MIT (HSV) or from the UNC Gene Therapy Center Vector Core (AAV) and injected into the hippocampus by stereotaxic surgery (10Â° angle; -2.2 mm anteroposterior (AP),Â±2.5 mm mediolateral (ML) and 0.6 uL of purified high-titer virus was separately infused (0.3 uL/infusion) over 3 min periods at 2 sites: -2.1 mm dorsoventral (DV) and at -1.9 mm DV). Dendrites were visualized by confocal microscopy and analyzed using Neuron Studio software.\n\nResults: We find that ÎFosB is induced in the hippocampus, but not the nucleus accumbens, by exposure to novel environments and spatial learning, and is induced in both brain regions by chronic cocaine exposure. We also demonstrate that this induction of ÎFosB by spatial learning is specific to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In addition, we find changes in multiple covalent modifications of histones associated with the FosB gene in animals exposed to cocaine or spatial learning, indicating that induction of ÎFosB in the hippocampus may be regulated by epigenetic changes in chromatin structure. We found that inhibition of ÎFosB transcriptional activity using either HSV- or AAV-mediated expression of ÎJunD in the dorsal hippocampus abrogated spatial learning in the novel object recognition, fear conditioning, and temporally displaced passive avoidance tasks. Importantly, we found that ÎJunD expression in the dorsal hippocampus also prevented conditioned place preference to low doses of cocaine. We are currently examining whether overexpression of ÎFosB in the dorsal hippocampus affects spatial learning and cocaine responses using the same behavioral paradigms. We show that overexpression of ÎFosB can control dendritic spine formation in the CA1 but not the CA3 region of the hippocampus, correlating with our expression data. Finally, we examine whether overexpression of ÎFosB affects the synaptic function of hippocampal neurons using a variety of electrophysiological assays.\n\nConclusions: ÎFosB is a unique candidate factor for spatial memory associations because, unlike other immediate early genes, it possesses remarkable stability (weeks in a living brain). Here, we demonstrate that ÎFosB is induced in the mouse hippocampus specifically by spatial learning and by cocaine exposure. Because known gene targets of ÎFosB are key players in hippocampal learning and synaptic function (i.e., CaMKII), we hypothesize that ÎFosB regulates hippocampal synaptic function. Indeed, we find that ÎFosB overexpression increases dendritic spines specifically in the CA1 region, and regulates hippocampal synaptic properties. We suggest that these ÎFosB-mediated changes in hippocampal synapses are responsible for the critical role we demonstrate for hippocampal ÎFosB in spatial learning and cocaine responses. Overall, these studies suggest that hippocampal ÎFosB may be important for the associations of drug and environment that underlie location-induced drug craving and relapse, and thus that hippocampal ÎFosB and its downstream targets may represent novel therapeutic inroads for the treatment or prevention of drug addiction.\n\nKeywords: ÎFosB, hippocampus, cocaine, learning.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT12. The Role of NR2B in CA1 Pyramidal Spine Morphology Following Morphine Conditioned Place Preference\n\nAmanda Fakira*, George Portugal, Ream Al-Hasani, Sam Golden, Scott Russo, Michael Bruchas, Dave Sulzer, Jose Moron-Concepcion\n\nColumbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York\n\nBackground: The hippocampus plays a critical role in the development of opiate preference and cravings triggered by environmental cues. Increasing studies demonstrate that long term memories are maintained by structural and functional plasticity in post-synaptic dendritic spines of which there are three types; thin (65%), mushroom (25%) and stubby (10%). Studies have demonstrated that morphine decreases spine density on hippocampal neurons. However, these studies used Golgi staining and 2D counts manual counts which cannot differentiate spine type. New techniques using high resolution 3D reconstruction of fluorescently labeled dendritic segments and automated spine counting to examine the types of spines have been developed. Dendritic spine morphology, controlled by actin polymerization, is regulated by NR2B-mediated Ca2+influx and activation of the Rho signaling cascade. By determining the types of spines affected by morphine and mechanisms that underlie this structural plasticity we can highlight new therapeutic targets in the treatment of opiate relapse.\n\nMethods: For these studies, a morphine conditioned place preference paradigm in which subcutaneously (s.c.) morphine (5, 8, 10 and 15 mg/kg) is paired with visual cues (horizontal vs vertical stripes) over 4 consecutive days. After preference testing, mice undergo extinction training for 5 days followed by morphine induced reinstatement. Following preference and extinction tests mice are sacrificed for either confocal imaging or western blotting. Subcellular fractionation and western blot analysis of NMDA receptor subunits, NR1 NR2B and NR2B, and Rho family signaling proteins, Rho and Rac1, in hippocampal lysates are performed. For confocal imaging intra-hippocampal injections of AAV-CamKII-eYFP are performed three weeks prior to preference test after which coronal brain sections are used to collect high resolution images of CA1 pyramidal neuron dendritic segments. Raw confocal images are deconvolved using Velocity software and then automatic spine counts are performed using NeuroStudio software. All experimental protocols in animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University.\n\nResults: We observed that following Mor CPP NR2B, NR1 and NR2A NMDA receptor subunits are increased in post-synaptic density fractions of the hippocampus. Additionally, these mice have decreases in the total number of spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons which is driven by a decrease in thin spines since mushroom spines were unaffected. Moreover, initial studies indicate that total Rho (A and B) expression is increased in the hippocampus following Mor CPP and that Rac1 expression is unaffected. Further analysis reveals that only post-synaptic expression of NR2B remains increased following extinction training. Finally, we are able to prevent morphine induced reinstatement by infusing NR2B antagonist, Ifenprodil (2Î¼g/ml), intra-hippocampally, prior to acute morphine challenge.\n\nConclusions: NR2B has been shown to be a critical mediator of structural plasticity. Our studies indicate that NR2B-Rho signaling mechanisms may be mediating opiate induced decreases in thin spines. Our data also demonstrate that elevated NR2B synaptic expression is essential for morphine induced reinstatement. Future studies are designed to reveal if NR2B-mediated Ca2+and Rho signaling is involved in decreases in thin spines and whether this decrease persists following extinction training. Altogether, our data highlight new mechanisms underlying context-dependent drug seeking behavior and may lead to development new therapeutic approaches to preventing relapse.\n\nKeywords: morphine, spines, hippocampus, Rho.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT13. A Neural Circuit Mechanism for Differentiating Positive and Negative Associative Memories\n\nPraneeth Namburi, Anna Beyeler, Suzuko Yorozu, Romy Wichmann, Stephanie Holden, Kim Mertens, Sarah Halbert, Ada Felix-Ortiz, Jesse Gray, Ian Wickersham, Kay Tye*\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nBackground: The ability to differentiate environmental stimuli that predict positive or negative outcomes is critical for survival, and perturbations of emotional processing can be manifested in many psychiatric disease states. Synaptic plasticity in the amygdala has been shown to be critical for the acquisition of associative memories, both positive and negative. While there is evidence that different populations of neurons in the amygdala may encode fearful or rewarding associations, the identifying features of these populations and the circuit and synaptic mechanisms of differentiating positive and negative emotional valence has remained an enigma.\n\nMethods: We trained animals on fear or reward conditioning tasks before evaluating synaptic strength by performing whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons that were labeled with retrogradely-travelling beads injected into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or centromedial amygdala (CeM). We then used rabies viral vectors to retrogradely express ChR2 in specific projections within the BLA. We also filled cells with biocytin during patch-clamp recordings to allow for post-hoc morphological reconstruction. Finally, we dissociated retrogradely labelled BLA neurons projecting to the NAc from those that projected to the CeM and performed RNA-Seq.\n\nResults: Here we show that neurons in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or the centromedial nucleus of the amygdala (CeM) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. We also show that photostimulation of BLA cell bodies projecting to the NAc is positively reinforcing while photostimulation of BLA neurons projecting to the CeM causes aversion. Because we could not detect defining characteristics of these functionally-distinct neuronal populations based on electrophysiological firing properties, nor morphology, we performed RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptome of these populations. RNA-Seq results provided a list of candidate genes that could contribute to differential recruitment of NAc and CeM projectors during fear or reward conditioning. One of the candidate genes differentially expressed in BLA neurons projecting to the NAc and CeM, was the neurotensin-1 receptor. We validated that neurotensin had opposing modulatory effects on glutamatergic inputs to NAc and CeM projectors.\n\nConclusions: Our findings demonstrate opposing functional roles for amygdala neurons depending on projection target. Even more importantly, these results provide a mechanistic explanation, on both a synaptic and circuit level, for how positive and negative associations can be rapidly formed, represented and expressed within the amygdala.\n\nKeywords: amygdala, fear, reward, plasticity.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT14. Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Abnormalities in the Hippocampus of Subjects with Schizophrenia\n\nHarry Pantazopoulos*, Caroline Sawyer, Stephan Heckers, Sabina Berretta, Matej Markota\n\nHarvard Medical School, Belmont, Massachusetts\n\nBackground: Increasing evidence points to the involvement of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in schizophrenia (SZ). CSPGs are involved in processes that shape neural circuits, including migration of neurons, guidance of axons, neuronal and glial cell maturation, and regulation of plasticity and firing properties, all relevant to SZ. During late postnatal stages, coinciding with the age of onset of SZ, CSPGs contribute to the assemblage of perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular matrix aggregates. Once formed, PNNs stabilize neural connections and contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of mature neuronal properties. PNNs envelop fast-firing interneurons, including neurons expressing parvalbumin (PVB). We have previously reported decreases of PNNs in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex and prefrontal cortex of SZ, regions in which numbers of PVB neurons are not altered, indicating that PNN decreases do not reflect loss of these neurons. In addition, we reported marked increases of CSPG expressing glial cells. In order to examine how widespread these abnormalities are, we focused on a region strongly implicated in SZ, the hippocampus (HP).\n\nMethods: We tested the hypothesis that CSPG abnormalities are present in the HP of SZ subjects. Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) lectin, a broad spectrum CSPG histochemical marker commonly used to study PNNs, was used to label CSPGs in the HP of control (n=19), SZ (n=14), and bipolar disorder (BD) (n=14) subjects. Numerical densities (Dn) and total numbers (N) of WFA positive (WFA+) PNNs and glial cells were counted using computer-assisted light microscopy; group differences were tested using stepwise linear regression models. Statistical correlations between PNN measures and previously published PVB measures from the same subjects were used to examine the relationship of PNNs with PVB neurons.\n\nResults: In subjects with SZ, decreases of WFA+PNNs were detected in the whole HP (N, p=0.0002, 51.1% decrease; Dn, p=0.0003, 51.40% decrease), and were significant in all hippocampal subregions with the exception of stratum lacunosum moleculare. N and Dn of WFA+PNNs were significantly correlated with N and Dn of PVB neurons reported previously in these subjects. In comparison, WFA+glial cells were markedly increased in the whole HP of SZ subjects (N, p=0.0001, 1266.9% increase; Dn, p=0.0001, 1205.3% increase). The majority of WFA+glial cells were concentrated in the dentate gyrus, an established site of adult neurogenesis, although increases were present all subregions with the exception of stratum lacunosum moleculare. In addition, numbers of WFA+glia were negatively correlated with age, suggestive of a decrease of adult neurogenesis with age reported in this region. In subjects with BD, N and Dn of WFA+PNNs and glia were normal in all HP regions.\n\nConclusions: WFA+PNN and glial abnormalities in the HP are selective for SZ. In comparison to PVB neuron decreases reported in the HP of these SZ subjects, PNN decreases may reflect failure to form or stabilize PNNs, or loss of PVB neurons. Alternatively, PVB neuron maturation may be disrupted, resulting in impaired PNN formation and decreased PVB. Ongoing investigations are examining these possibilities. PNN decreases in absence of neuronal loss in other regions, and genetic associations of CSPG and matrix metalloproteases, support the idea of a primary PNN abnormality. If so, decreases of PNNs in the HP may result in decreased inhibition, affecting interconnected brain regions, as suggested by rodent work. Lack of WFA+PNN decreases in BD subjects which PVB decreases were reported may reflect loss of PVB neurons that do not have PNNs, possibly from oxidative stress. Evidence that PNNs protect PVB neurons from oxidative stress supports this possibility. Alternatively, decreased PVB may occur in neurons that properly form and maintain PNNs. Increases of WFA+glia in SZ in the dentate gyrus raises the possibility that they are associated with disregulated cell maturation.\n\nKeywords: perineuronal nets, bipolar disorder, parvalbumin, neurodevelopment.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT15. Adolescent Intermittent Ethanol and DNA Methylation Mechanisms in Amygdala: A Role in Anxiety-like and Alcohol-drinking Behaviors\n\nSubhash Pandey*, Amul Sakharkar, David Gavin, Huaibo Zhang, Ying Chen, Dennis Grayson\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois\n\nBackground: Binge alcohol drinking during adolescence causes molecular changes in the developing brain resulting in substance abuse and alcoholism in adulthood. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism that regulates neuronal gene expression during brain development. We investigated the effects of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure on DNA methylation and demethylation mechanisms in the amygdala and its role in anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors in adulthood.\n\nMethods: In order to model a binge pattern of drinking we administered eight intraperitoneal injections of ethanol (2 g/kg) or n-saline to adolescent rats during post-natal days (PND) 28-41 with a 2-day on/off paradigm. We studied the effects of AIE and adolescent intermittent n-saline (AIS) exposure on DNA methylation/demethylation mechanisms and neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the amygdala and the resultant anxiety-like behaviors during adolescence and adulthood (PND 92). We also examined the effects of 5-azacytidine, a DNA methytransferases (DNMT) inhibitor, on anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors in adulthood.\n\nResults: AIE-exposed animals displayed anxiety-like behaviors 24 hrs after the last ethanol injection (ethanol withdrawal), which persisted into adulthood. Concomitantly, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity, DNMT3b mRNA and DNA demethylating factors, i.e. GADD45a, b and g were found to be altered in the amygdala of AIE-exposed rats during adolescence and some of these changes persisted into adulthood. To understand the down-stream molecular mechanisms by which DNA methylation may be regulating the anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors, we examined the DNA methylation specific to the NPY gene promoter and NPY protein levels in the amygdala. NPY protein levels were down-regulated in the central and medial amygdaloid structures of AIE-exposed rats at 24 hrs, with a persistent decrease in adulthood. Reciprocally, DNA methylation at the NPY gene promoter was increased in the amygdala of AIE adult rats, which is consistent with the increase in DNMT3b expression and DNMT activity and decrease in the GADD45g levels. To test if DNMT inhibition could reverse AIE-induced anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors and DNA hypermethylation of the NPY gene, we treated AIS and AIE adult rats with 5â-azacytidine. Treatment with 5â-azacytidine attenuated AIE exposure-induced anxiety-like behaviors and alcohol intake at adulthood and also inhibited the DNA hypermethylation of the NPY gene promoter in the amygdala.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that AIE altered the DNA methylation/demethylation pathways in the amygdala during adolescence with long-lasting up regulation of DNMT activity persistent in adulthood causing anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors most likely via decreased NPY gene expression. These results also raise the possibility of DNMT inhibitors as a promising therapeutic option to treat alcohol-abuse and co-morbid anxiety disorders (supported by NADIA grant from NIH-NIAAA to SCP).\n\nKeywords: DNA methylation, Adolescent binge drinking, Anxiety, Amygdala.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT16. Ketamine Produces Structural Plasticity in Dopaminergic Neurons via Co-Activation of MEK-ERK and Akt-mTOR Pathways: Translation from Mouse Primary Culture to Human Ipsc-Derived Neurons\n\nGinetta Collo, Laura Cavalleri, Federica Bono, Mark Millan, Cristian Chiamulera, Pierfranco Spano, Emilio Merlo Pich*\n\nF. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland\n\nBackground: Addictive drugs produce structural changes in the dopaminergic system, changes that may act as pathological substrate for drug-related chronic symptoms, including craving and relapse. Ketamine, a psychotrope anaesthetic drug with addictive properties, is known to increases dopamine (DA) release, but its capacity to induce structural plasticity is unknown. To explore its occurrence and the key biological mechanisms eventually involved we used two in vitro models: primary cultures of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons obtained from the mouse embryo (Collo et al. 2009) and dopaminergic neurons differentiated from human IPSC (Kricks et al. 2011). In these models neurons organize functionally and morphologically in local networks and intracellular pathways can be effectively studied, offering a paradigm for assessing disease-relevant targets and effects of pharmacologic intervention.\n\nMethods: Primary neuronal cultures of mesencephalon containing dopaminergic neurons and obtained from E17 mouse embryos as described (Collo et al. 2008, 2012, 2013). Both wild-type and D3KO mice were used. We also derived iPSC from human volunteers and differentiated them into dopaminergic neurons following the method of Kricks et al. (2011) with modification. Cells with dopaminergic phenotype were cultured for 80 days and profiled for co-expression of TH and DAT using morphological and biochemical methods. Ketamine was added to the incubation media at various concentrations. Inhibitor of kinase, dopaminergic antagonists and other compounds were used to pharmacologically probe various pathways. Structural changes in neurons in cultures were studied using confocal, fluorescence and transmission microscopy associated with computer assisted morphometry. Western blood, RNA assessment and dopamine HPLC measurements were performed according to published methods. A group of wild-type and D3KO mice was challenge with ketamine and sacrificed at different time points to study the activation of mTORC1 in the ventral mesencephalon in vivo.\n\nResults: In a series of studies we showed that ketamine (0.01-1 uM) dose-dependently increased dendritic arborisation and soma size of dopaminergic neurons obtained from the mouse embryo or differentiated from human iPS cells. Similar effects were observed using the NMDA antagonist Ro 25-6981 (0.01-1 uM). Structural neuroplasticity induced by ketamine did not occur following pre-treatment with the AMPA antagonists NBQX and GYKI 52466 (0.01-10 uM). These data indicate the presence of functional glutamatargic input on dopaminergic neurons. Accordingly, morphological assessments of both the mouse and human cultures identified interconnected DAergic, glutamatergic and GABA neurons, supporting the existence of complex networks in vitro. The involvement of Akt-mTORC pathway was based on the evidence of ketamine-induced increase of p70S6 kinase phosphorylation that was blocked by LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor, and by rapamycin, a mTORC1 inhibitor. The effects of ketamine were also blocked by the DA D3 antagonist SB277011-A and were absent in primary cultures of D3-KO mice, effects confirmed in vivo. Immunoneutralization of BDNF also blocked the effects of ketamine, suggesting the necessity of the co-activation of the TrkB-MEK-ERK and D3-Akt-mTOR pathways to induce structural plasticity in dopaminergic neurons.\n\nConclusions: In dopaminergic neurons Ketamine induced a dose-dependent increase of dendritic arborization and soma size in both mouse primary culture and differentiated human iPSC. Both cells respond similarly to ketamine, showing activation of the mTOR and ERK intracellular prototypical pathways for cell growth and survival. Ketamine effect was blocked by D3 antagonists and was absent in DÂ£-KO mice preparations, an evidence collected also in vivo, suggesting a autocrine role for DA released by ketamine via activation of the D3 autoreceptors. Ketamine effects wee also blocked by AMPA antagonists, indicating a cross-talk between glutamateric and dopaminergic neurons present in the cultures. Since we recently showed that cocaine and nicotine produced structural plasticity both in vitro, in mouse dopaminergic neuron primary cultures, and in vivo, after repeated in utero exposures (Collo et al. 2012, 2013), we conclude that D3 antagonists or partial D3 agonists can offer a potential therapeutic and disease-modifying action for some forms of addiction, in particular those related with early life exposure.\n\nKeywords: dendrites, dopamine D3 receptors, AMPA antagonist, BDNF.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT17. Lymphocytes Adoptively Transferred from Chronically Stressed Mice Confer Rapid Antidepressant Effects to Naive Mice\n\nMiles Herkenham*, Michael L. Lehmann, Rebecca A. Brachman\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland\n\nBackground: Mood and cognition are generally thought of as being controlled almost exclusively by the CNS. However, peripheral systems, i.e., the endocrine and immune systems, influence behavior. Psychological stress and stress hormones alter the status of the immune system, and in turn, immune system perturbations affect CNS function and structure via humoral and cellular pathways conveying signals to the brain. The bidirectional neuroimmune pathways serve to achieve internal homeostasis. Disequilibrium, if sustained or severe, results in disease. Scant attention has been paid to the role played by the adaptive immune system in responding to and affecting mood states. It is known that chronic psychological stress affects lymphocyte numbers and function via sympathetic and steroid hormone effector pathways. However, very little is known about whether stress-modulated lymphocytes in turn influence affective behavior and CNS function. Studies have shown that lymphocyte subsets adoptively transferred into or selectively deleted from mice can affect cognition, mood, and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, there is no information about whether the psychological status of the donor animals plays a role in exerting these effects on the recipient. To address that question, we designed a simple experiment in which lymphocytes from chronically defeat-stressed or non-stressed mice were transferred to healthy, naÃ¯ve Rag2-/- mice, which lack mature lymphocytes. We found that Rag2-/- mice repopulated with cells from socially defeated (SD) mice showed reduced anxious and depressive-like behaviors and increased hippocampal neurogenesis, a correlate of antidepressant efficacy, compared to Rag2-/- mice receiving either no cells or cells from home-cage (HC) control mice. We interpret the data to mean that psychological stress primes the adaptive immune system to confer stress resiliency to its host.\n\nMethods: Animals. Donor and control mice were adult male C57BL/6 mice (Taconic). Recipient mice were adult male Rag2-/- mice on a C57BL/6 background (Taconic). Social Defeat (SD). Repeated SD was used to induce alterations in behavioral affect in the donor mice. An experimental intruder mouse was co-housed for 14 days in the home cage of a dominant aggressor CD-1 male mouse. A partition separated the pair. Each day, the partition was removed for 5 min to allow agonistic encounters between the pair. Home-cage (HC) control mice were kept in group housing conditions. Adoptive transfer. After 14 days of SD or HC, cervical, axillary, inguinal, and mesenteric lymph nodes of donor mice were removed, isolated and injected retro-orbitally at a concentration of 10â20 million cells per host. Recipient Rag2-/- mice received cells from either SD (SD->Rag) or HC (HC->Rag) mice or saline (Naive). Behavioral analysis. Beginning 10 days after the transfer, the host Rag2-/- mice were tested in one behavioral test per day using automated video-based tracking of behavior in the Light/dark (L/D) box, the Open field test (OFT), the Social interaction (SI) test, the Urine scent marking (USM), and the Tail suspension test (TST). Neurogenesis analysis by BrdU immunohistochemistry. One day after behavioral testing, BrdU was administered i.p. at 200 mg/kg. Three h later, mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with paraformaldehyde. Sections cut through the hippocampus were immunostained for BrdU. Stained cells in the dentate gyrus subgranular zone were counted from every 12th slide-mounted section. Protein determinations. Serum was analyzed according to manufacturerâs instructions by MS-Q-Plex Mouse Cytokine screen (Quansys) measuring IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17, MCP-1, IFNÎ³, TNFÎ±, MIP-1Î±, GMCSF, and RANTES.\n\nResults: Two weeks after adoptive transfer to lymphopenic mice, lymphocytes have migrated to the spleen and lymph nodes, proliferated, and reached a plateau. At this stage, the recipient Rag2-/- mice were behaviorally phenotyped. In the L/D box, SD->Rag mice made more transitions and spent more time in the light compartment than either the saline-injected or HC->Rag mice, suggesting an anxiolytic effect of SD cells. In the OFT, the SD->Rag mice relative to naÃ¯ve Rag2-/- mice spent more time in the center. In the SI test, SD->Rag mice showed more interaction with the CD-1 mouse than did the other groups, suggesting a greater sociability in these mice. In the USM test, SD->Rag mice showed enhanced scent marking to female urine, suggesting increased hedonic drive compared to naÃ¯ve and HC->Rag mice. In the TST, where immobility is a measure of depressive-like states, the SD->Rag mice showed more time mobile than the naÃ¯ve Rag mice. Thus in all tests, the SD->Rag group showed reductions in anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors relative to other groups. Hippocampal neurogenesis is decreased by psychological stressors and increased by antidepressant interventions. BrdU+cell counts in the dentate gyrus showed significantly more (about 50%) newborn cells in the SD->Rag group than the HC->Rag group. Cytokine profiles in the blood of donor and recipient mice showed opposite stress-induced and cell-induced changes. Chronic defeat stress affected the blood cytokine levels in the donor mice by increasing TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-17, and IFNÎ³ in the SD relative to HC groups. Interestingly, in the Rag2-/- recipient mice, the levels of TNFÎ±, L-1Î², IL-2, IL-3, and IL-17 were reduced in SD->Rag compared to HC->Rag mice, and thus the direction of the difference was opposite to that of the donor mice. NaÃ¯ve Rag2-/- mice had levels that fell between the HC->Rag and SD>Rag levels for some cytokines.\n\nConclusions: We showed that lymphocytes can be modified in vivo by psychological manipulations to exert antidepressant effects on their host. The view that psychopathology entails a destructive spiral in the immune system and brain overlooks the immune systemâs proactive agendaâto achieve homeostasis in conditions of disequilibrium. The data presented here show that lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system are programmed by psychosocial stress to confer antidepressant effects. They also increased new cell proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A clue to how stress-programmed lymphocytes work to reset homeostasis is provided by the profile of cytokine levels in the blood of the donors and recipients. As expected, chronic stress elevated inflammatory cytokines in the blood of the SD donor mice relative to HC control mice, but that profile was reversed in the blood of SD->Rag relative to HC->Rag recipient mice, consistent with its likely role in mediating the ârestorativeâ effects on behavior and neurogenesis. Future work will explore the cellular and humoral pathways by which the changes access the brain to influence its structure and function.\n\nKeywords: neuroimmune, lymphocytes, antidepressant, neurogenesis.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT18. Effects of Extended Access Cocaine Self-administration on Inhibitory Neurotransmission in the Nucleus Accumbens\n\nAnthony Purgianto*, Julia Miao, Mike Milovanovic, Marina Wolf\n\nThe Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University, North Chicago, Illinois\n\nBackground: Excitatory synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) undergoes time-dependent changes during withdrawal from extended access cocaine self-administration in concert with the incubation of cue-induced cocaine craving. The goal of this project is to determine if incubation of cocaine craving is also accompanied by plasticity of inhibitory transmission in the NAc. While prior studies have found changes in both presynaptic and postsynaptic aspects of inhibitory transmission after different cocaine regimens, very little is known about whether these measures are affected during incubation. Our goal is to investigate whether inhibitory GABAergic transmission is altered in the NAc during incubation.\n\nMethods: Three types of studies are underway to compare rats (male Sprague-Dawley) after prolonged withdrawal (>45 days) from extended access cocaine or saline self-administration (6h/day x 10 days). The first is an immunocytochemical study of parvalbumin expression, which provides an index of the activity of GABAergic parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons. The second study aims to measure GABAA receptor subunit surface expression at several different withdrawal time points (2, 25, and 48 days) using biotinylation and immunoblotting. Our third study uses electrophysiological local field potential (LFP) recordings to obtain a measure of overall inhibitory tone in the NAc. We are currently analyzing LFP in the NAc after stimulation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).\n\nResults: From our immunocytochemical study, we found no differences in the number of PV+cells in the NAc, indicating there was no loss or de novo generation of PV+interneurons. However, we did find an increase in PV immunoreactivity in the NAc of the cocaine group compared to the saline group. When we separated our data into 3 rostral to caudal levels, we found that the increase in PV immunoreactivity was specific to middle- and caudal NAc. Our immunoblotting study indicated a significant decrease in surface expression of the GABAA Î±2 subunit after 48 days of withdrawal from cocaine. No changes were observed for Î±1 on any withdrawal day or for Î±4 on withdrawal day 2. Our electrophysiological study indicated loss of potentiation after 5Hz and 10Hz stimulation in the cocaine group. No alteration in the input/output (I/O) curve was observed.\n\nConclusions: Our first two studies described above suggest potential pre- and post-synaptic alterations in inhibitory neurotransmission. An increase in PV+interneuron activity after prolonged withdrawal is suggested by our immunocytochemical results. This would result in increased GABA tone, which seems to be accompanied by a reduction in GABAA Î±2 receptor expression. Using LFP to analyze the mPFC-NAc circuit, we found no alteration in the I/O curve, indicating no change in the basal network strength. However, our results after train stimulations seem to indicate either an increase of inhibitory tone or a reduction in excitatory tone. To determine whether this is due to changes in inhibitory GABA transmission, we are repeating these studies after intra-NAc injection of picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist. We are also investigating changes in the basolateral amygdala-NAc circuit. Overall, these studies are the first to explore changes in inhibitory neurotransmission in the NAc that may contribute to the withdrawal-dependent incubation of cocaine craving.\n\nKeywords: Cocaine, Self-Administration, Animal Model, Nucleus Accumbens.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT19. The Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder Gene TCF4 Regulates Cortical Structure and Neuronal Physiology\n\nMatthew Rannals, Stephanie Cerceo-Page, Andrew Jaffe, Morganne Campbell, Ryan Gallo, BaDoi Phan, Thomas Hyde, Joel Kleinman, Daniel Weinberger, Brady Maher*\n\nLieber Institute for Brain Development, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nBackground: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of loci associated with increase risk for SZ and several of these risk variants are located within introns of Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4; E2-2, ITF2). In addition, autosomal dominant mutations in TCF4 result in Pitt Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a spectrum of symptoms including hyperventilation, seizures, autistic behaviors, mental retardation, and brain malformations. Currently, the molecular mechanisms and underlying pathophysiology responsible for these two disorders are not understood. Our goal is to determine the function of TCF4 during cortical development and to understand the molecular mechanism of risk that is associated with genetic variants of TCF4. TCF4 is a ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein that binds to E-box DNA sequences (CANNTG) and regulates transcription. It has 41 exons of which 21 are alternative 5â exons and potentially code for 18 N-terminally distinct protein isoforms named TCF4A â TCF4R. TCF4 can form homodimers or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins and appears to be regulated by activity through its interaction with the Ca2+binding protein calmodulin.\n\nMethods: To test the function of TCF4 in the developing neocortex we altered its expression by transfecting layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the rat medial prefrontal cortex by in utero electroporation (IUE). We knockdown TCF4 expression using two shRNA constructs that target independent sequences within the TCF4 transcript and over-expressed human TCF4 with recombinant TCF4 constructs. Functional analysis was performed using whole-cell electrophysiology and confocal imaging in acute brain slices. To identify candidate genes regulated by TCF4 we combined IUE with translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP).\n\nResults: Embryonic knockdown of TCF4 decreased intrinsic excitability and resulted in the ectopic appearance of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA, p<0.002; TCF4 shRNA n=24, Con shRNA n=32). Decreased intrinsic excitability resulted from a significantly increased afterhyperpolarization (AHP) potential following a train of action potentials (p<0.0001; TCF4 shRNA n=29, Con shRNA n=26) and increased slow AHP currents following 100ms voltage-steps (p<0.05; TCF4 shRNA n=13, Con shRNA n=14). To identify candidate genes responsible for these phenotypes we performed TRAP from IUE transfected rat brains. Two candidate ion channel genes, KCNQ1 and SCN10a were significantly up regulated in neurons expressing TCF4 shRNA (KCNQ1 p<0.004; SCN10a p<0.01; TCF4 shRNA n=3, Con shRNA n=3). Remarkably, both KCNQ1 and SCN10a are known to be associated with SFA in a variety neuronal cell types. In addition, over expression of TCF4B dramatically alters cortical development and structure. in vivo terminal differentiation was significantly increased in neuroprogenitor cells expressing TCF4B (p<0.003; TCF4B n=5, GFP control n=6) and neuronal migration was increased such that greater than 30% of the transfected neurons had reached the intermediate zone or cortical plate compared to less than 10% of the cells transfected with GFP alone (p<0.0001; TCF4B n=8, GFP n=8). TCF4B overexpression also resulted in postnatal formation of abnormal cortical columns. Formation of abnormal columns was rescued by co-expressing TCF4B+calmodulin (CaM) and these columns appear to be formed in an activity-dependent manner because a mutant CaM (CaM1,2,3,4) that cannot interact with calcium was ineffective at rescue.\n\nConclusions: Our results suggest the dosage of TCF4 is critical to proper cortical development and neuronal physiology. By combining IUE with TRAP we demonstrate a novel approach to identifying underlying molecular mechanisms associated with genetic manipulations. Using this unique protocol we identify two candidate genes whose expression appears to be regulated by TCF4 and thus may be dysregulated in Schizophrenia and PTHS. In addition, we show that TCF4 in an activity-dependent manner is critical to cortical development by regulating the number and positioning of neurons found in cortical circuits.\n\nKeywords: schizophrenia, autism, electrophysiology, neurodevelopment.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT20. Sonic Hedgehog Signaling Disruption in Ellis-van Creveld Dwarfism Confers Protection Against Bipolar Affective Disorder\n\nEdward Ginns*, Marzena Galdzicka, Robert Elston, Yeunjoo Song, Steven Paul, Janice Egeland\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School, Shrewsbury, Massachusetts\n\nBackground: Decades of longitudinal research on bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) revealed co-segregation of high numbers of Ellis-van Creveld dwarfism (EvC) and Bipolar I (BPI) cases in several large Amish families descending from the same pioneer. Despite more than forty years of research documenting the high prevalence of both disorders in these families, no EvC individual has ever been reported with BPI. Although compelling evidence supports a significant genetic susceptibility to develop BPAD, identification of the genetic variants and an associated underlying molecular mechanism or pathophysiology have remained elusive. To date, most genetic studies of affective disorders have been limited to identifying genetic variants that increase the risk of disease. By contrast, we have previously provided evidence that, in addition to rare susceptibility alleles, there may be rare alleles that reduce the risk of developing BPAD. We previously reported strong evidence for a BPAD locus with protective minor alleles on chromosome 4p at D4S2949 and suggestive evidence for a locus on chromosome 4q at D4S397. The EVC and hedgehog interacting protein (Hhip) genes were subsequently cloned and located within 5 million bases of our chromosome 4p16 and 4q putative loci for BPAD, respectively. The proximity of the EvC gene to our previously reported chromosome 4p16 BPAD locus, coupled with detailed clinical observations and statistical confirmation that EvC and BPI do not occur in the same Amish individuals, led us to postulate that the molecular mechanism underlying EvC is protective against BPI. Since homozygous Amish EVC mutations causing EvC dwarfism do so by disrupting sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, our data implicate Shh signaling in the underlying pathophysiology of BPAD. We now report clinical and statistical evidence that disruption of sonic hedgehog signaling in EvC confers protection from BPI, and perhaps more generally against major affective disorder.\n\nMethods: EvC families were ascertained systematically by Amish church districts. EvC subjects were examined and diagnosed at home or at the Johns Hopkins Moore Clinic. Deceased were certified by death records. A pedigree trace was conducted for every EvC sibship. The resulting progenitor charts tested if all Amish EvC cases descended from a common progenitor. Under written informed consent, genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples, immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines and/or skin fibroblasts. Analysis for the Amish EVC gene intron13 (IVS13+5G>T) mutation was performed using Sanger sequencing and the MassARRAY MALDI-TOF (Sequenom/Agena Biosciences) platforms. Two types of clinical data (psychiatric interviews and medical records) were processed for independent and âblindedâ assessment by a five member Amish Study Psychiatric Board using Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) and Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-III-IV (DSM) to make categorical diagnoses. Only one primary hypothesis was tested, that of association between BPI/no disease status and EvC/no disease status. Two types of association analysis were performed on all 358 individuals in the BPAD Master Pedigree for whom both EvC genotype and BPAD diagnosis were available: a Fisherâs exact test, which ignores all relationships, and large sample tests based on a logistic regression that allowed for the familial dependencies.\n\nResults: The EvC sample comprised 67 EvC families with 156 dwarfs and 33 surviving to adulthood. Among these 33 individuals with EvC were a number in the 40-70 years of age categories (67% over age 40 years; 52% over age 50 years) and past the window of risk for onset of BPI disorder. Progenitor traces on confirmed BPI cases yielded the same pioneer, Koenig, identified previously as the progenitor for EvC and giving early evidence for significant co-segregation of these two illnesses. Although the bipolar pedigree comprises 42 BPI sub-pedigrees, the EvC families were mainly included in four of them. Another relevant co-segregation is the clustering of BPAD Amish male suicides in this same extended family. Apart from the documented co-segregation of EvC and BPI, unbiased case ascertainment over time never revealed subjects with co-morbidity. Analyses performed to test our primary hypothesis, i.e. that of association between absence of BPI and EvC (P=.029, Fisherâs exact test, two-sided, confirmed by permutation test), supported our hypothesis that EvC confers protection (i.e mental health wellness) from BPI, as well as suggesting a more general protection against the spectrum of affective disorders in these families.\n\nConclusions: Our study of the co-segregation of EvC and BPAD in the Old Order Amish implicates Shh signaling in the pathophysiology of BPAD. Elucidating how disrupted Shh signaling protects against BPI could uncover mutations in the Shh pathway that cause or increase risk for this and related mood disorders. Our understanding of the molecular basis of Shh signaling and reactivation occurring in a wide range of cancers has led to identification of Shh signaling antagonists that are already in human clinical studies. Redirection of drugs targeting Shh signaling that are in clinical development for other medical conditions could lead to better treatments for affective disorders in the near future.\n\nKeywords: BPAD, Sonic Hedgehog, Mood Disorders, Ellis-van Creveld.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT21. Involvement of the Ventral Hippocampus (vHipp) Ascending Pathway to the Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) in the Antidepressant-like Effect of Ketamine in Rats\n\nFlavia Carreno*, Amiksha Shah, Alan Frazer, Daniel Lodge\n\nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas\n\nBackground: The mechanisms and brain regions contributing to the antidepressant effects of ketamine are still unclear. Our initial studies demonstrated that the transient inactivation of the vHipp with 2% lidocaine at the time of ketamine administration (10 mg/kg), completely blocked the sustained (1 week), but not the acute (30 min) antidepressant-like response to ketamine, measured by the forced swim test (FST). A significant limbic projection of the vHipp is to the mPFC. We examined in rodents the role of the ascending projections from the vHipp to the mPFC in the response to ketamine using the FST. In addition, the role of the neurotrophin receptor TrkB, which is known to be required for ketamineâs antidepressant-like response, was studied.\n\nMethods: Different approaches were used to test the hypothesis that activation of the vHipp-mPFC pathway is involved in the antidepressant-like response to ketamine. In one, an asymmetric disconnection procedure was utilized whereby 2% lidocaine (0.5ul) was injected via guide cannulas to the vHipp on one side of the brain and into the mPFC on the other. This transiently disconnects these two regions at the time of ketamine administration. Other approaches were to evaluate the effects of either optogenetic stimulation or DREADD activation of the vHipp-mPFC pathway. For the optogentic experiments, AAV2-hsyn-ChR2-EYFP (or control virus) was injected into the vHipp and bilateral fiber optic cannulas implanted into the mPFC. ChR2 was activated by laser light and the behavioral effect in the FST measured. For the DREADD (Gq) approach, vHipp-mPFC activation was achieved by combining a trans-synaptic (WGE)-Cre virus (in the vHipp) with a virus expressing a floxed Gq-protein (DIO-hM3D in the mPFC). The involvement of BDNF/TrkB was studied in two separate cohorts of rats implanted with bilateral cannulas into the vHipp for injection of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, K252a, or a TrkB/Fc chimera, which scavenges BDNF.\n\nResults: The sustained effect of ketamine in the FST was completely blunted following the asymmetric disconnection procedure. Consistent with the effect of ketamine, optogenetic stimulation of vHipp-mPFC pathway significantly increased climbing in the FST; however, in contrast to the effect of ketamine, a decrease in immobility was not observed but there was a significant decrease in swimming behavior. To test if the decrease in swimming was due to a feedback pathway from the mPFC to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), we examined optogenetic stimulation following administration of the GABA-A receptor antagonist, bicuculine, directly into the DRN. Pretreatment with bicuculine abolished the decrease in swimming observed when the mPFC was stimulated and now a significant decrease in immobility was revealed. Activation of specific neurons in the mPFC that receive inputs from the vHipp with the designer drug, clozapine-n-oxide (0.5mg/kg i.p.), recapitulated the antidepressant-like response to ketamine in the FST. We also examined whether a transient increase in TrkB receptor phosphorylation in the vHipp contributed to the sustained antidepressant response to ketamine. Similar to the effects of administration of lidocaine into the v-Hipp, blockade of TrkB receptor phosphorylation with K252a into the vHipp at the time of ketamine administration prevented its antidepressant-like effects measured 1 week following its administration. This result led to the hypothesis that ketamine induces plastic changes in vHipp afferents, e.g., an increase in ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluR1, that underlie its sustained antidepressant response. To test this, we administered a TrkB/Fc chimera, which scavenges BDNF, into the vHipp at the time of ketamine administration and examined the expression of GluR1 in the mPFC 24h later. Ketamine produced an increase in GluR1 in mPFC synaptosomes that was blocked in rats administered the TrkB/Fc chimera. These data show that initial blockade of TrkB signaling by the time of ketamine injection prevented the sustained (1 week) antidepressant response to ketamine as well as a marker of plasticity in the mPFC.\n\nConclusions: In conclusion, these data demonstrate a role for vHipp-mPFC plasticity in the sustained antidepressant-like effects of ketamine.\n\nKeywords: ketamine, hippocampus-mPFC pathway, optogenetics, DREADD.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT22. Oligodendrocyte Morphometry and Expression of Myelin Related mRNA in Ventral Prefrontal White Matter in Major Depressive Disorder\n\nGrazyna Rajkowska*, Gouri Mahajan, Monica Sathyanesan, Abiye Iyo, Mohadetheh Moulana, Patrick Kyle, William Woolverton, Javier Miguel-Hidalgo, Craig Stockmeier, Samuel Sathyanesan\n\nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi\n\nBackground: Involvement of ventral prefrontal (vPFC) white matter in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) has been revealed in several diffusion tensor imaging studies. However, the cellular and molecular pathology underlying prefrontal white matter abnormalities in MDD and the possible influence of antidepressant medications have not been examined. The present study investigated oligodendrocyte morphometry and myelin-related mRNA expression in the vPFC white matter in MDD. Oligodendrocyte morphometric parameters were also studied in the analogous region of the vPFC white matter of male rhesus monkeys treated chronically with the antidepressant fluoxetine.\n\nMethods: Triplicate coronal frozen sections (20 Î¼m) of the vPFC deep or gyral white matter were collected for immunohistochemistry from 21 subjects diagnosed in the last month of life with MDD and 17 age-matched non-psychiatric control subjects. An antidepressant medication was detected in the blood of five of the depressed subjects. There were no significant differences between cohorts in age, gender, postmortem interval (PMI), tissue pH or time in freezer. The density and volume (size) of CNPase-immunoreactive oligodendrocytes was estimated in the deep and gyral white matter using a 3-dimensional cell counting method implemented with StereoInvestigator (Microbrightfield) software. Similar analyses were performed in the analogous region of the 6 male monkeys (Macaca mulatta) treated daily for 9 months with oral fluoxetine (3 mg/kg) and in 6 control monkeys receiving the vehicle. Peak fluoxetine levels in blood, seen at two hours after administration, approximated clinically relevant levels. In 11-13 pairs of MDD and matched control subjects, expression of oligodendrocyte/myelin-related mRNA for CNPase, PLP1, MBP, MOG, MOBP, Olig1 and Olig2 was measured by quantitative real time PCR in homogenates of combined deep and gyral tissue taken from 50 Î¼m sections of vPFC white matter.\n\nResults: There was no significant difference between the two human cohorts for either the density or the size of oligodendrocyte cell bodies in the deep vPFC white matter. In contrast, the size of oligodendrocyte cell bodies was significantly decreased in the gyral vPFC white matter in depression (ANCOVA F(1, 33)=13.283, p=0.001). Death by suicide had no significant effect on these parameters in depressed subjects. Pearson correlation analyses revealed no significant association between smaller sizes in deep or gyral white matter and age, PMI, tissue pH, time in freezer or duration of depression. There were no significant differences between fluoxetine-treated and control monkeys in the density or size of oligodendrocytes in vPFC white matter. There was as a significant 34 percent decrease in the expression of PLP1 mRNA in depressed subjects vs. controls (t=2.049, df=23, p=0.05). In contrast, there was a significant increase in the expression of mRNA for CNPase (109%, t=3.209; df=24, p=0.004), MOG (51%, t=2.452, df=19, p=0.024) and Olig1 (47%, t=2.108, df=22, p=0.047) in depression. There were no significant correlations between the expression of mRNA for PLP1, CNPase, MOG or Olig1 and age, PMI, tissue pH, time in freezer or duration of depression. Death by suicide had no significant effect on these parameters in depressed subjects. There was no significant effect of depression on the expression of mRNA for MBP, MOBP and Olig2.\n\nConclusions: This is the first observation in postmortem tissue from depressed subjects that examined the density and size of oligodendrocytes immunolabeled specifically for this glial cell type. Our results suggest that subtle changes in oligodendrocyte morphology in the gyral vPFC white matter may be related to altered axonal integrity as revealed by imaging studies. The proximity of gyral white matter to the overlying vPFC gray matter suggests a relationship between smaller soma sizes of white matter oligodendrocytes and previously noted reductions in neuronal and glial cell density in vPFC gray matter. Neuroimaging studies specifically targeting gyral vPFC white matter have not been performed in MDD. Our study in monkey tissue suggests that chronic antidepressant treatment does not appear to affect soma size of oligodendrocytes. As noted in animal models of myelin disturbances, changes in gene expression for four myelin proteins (i.e., PLP1, CNPase, MOG and OLIG1) in the vPFC white matter suggest a possible mechanism for the degeneration of cortical axons and dysfunctional maturation of oligodendrocytes in depression.

Altered Astrocyte-Microglia Communication as Potential Immune/Inflammatory Changes in Major Mental Illness\n\nShin-ichi Kano*, Brian Lo, Akira Sawa\n\nJohns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nBackground: Clinical studies have reported that patients with major mental illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have mild inflammation or immune abnormalities. The underlying biological mechanisms, however, are not fully understood. Although microglia and astrocytes have been extensively studied in brain inflammatory changes, less is known about their mutual regulations. Here we have focused on astrocyte-microglia interaction and explored its alterations in immune/inflammatory responses by studying the role of glutathione-S-transferase theta 2 (GSTT2), which has been implicated in major mental illness.\n\nMethods: Mouse models are used to address the role of GSTT2 in immune/inflammatory responses. Primary mouse glial cell culture was employed to address immune/inflammatory responses to defined sets of immune stimuli such as LPS and polyI:C. mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Systemic LPS-induced neuroinflammation was assessed in mice with astrocyte-specific modulation of GSTT2 expression levels.\n\nResults: We found that GSTT2 could facilitate the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î± and IL-6 in primary mouse glial cells against various immune stimuli. Cell type-specific analysis indicated that GSTT2 controlled astrocytic communication with microglia via soluble factors (e.g., CCL2, CXCL10, IL-34) in immune/inflammatory responses. in vivo neuroinflammation models showed that the modification of astrocytic expression of GSTT2 altered microglial activation in the brain. Further studies on the underlying mechanisms and in vivo phenotypes are in progress.\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest that GSTT2 may be involved in altered astrocyte-microglia communication under immune/inflammatory conditions relevant for major mental illness. This study provides further insight into the biological mechanisms underlying immune/inflammatory changes in major mental illness.\n\nKeywords: Astrocytes, Microglia, Immune, GSTT2.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT24. Knockdown of mu-Opioid Receptors in Rat Ventral Tegmental Area Prevents Social Stress-induced Cross-sensitization and BDNF Expression While Altering Intracellular AKT Phosphorylation in GABA neurons\n\nElla Nikulina*, Caitlin Johnston, Amy Lasek, Ronald Hammer, Jr\n\nUniversity of Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona\n\nBackground: We showed previously that exposure to intermittent social defeat stress up-regulates mu-opioid receptor (MOR) expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and induces prolonged cross-sensitization to amphetamine, together with a long-lasting increase of VTA brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. In the VTA, MORs are localized in GABA neurons, and their activation inhibits GABA release to indirectly stimulate VTA dopamine (DA) neurons. Stimulation of MORs activates the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade that is involved in stress- and psychostimulant-induced behaviors. However, the specific intracellular systems by which VTA MORs alter social stress-induced behavior and cellular function are unknown. The purpose of the current study was to determine the effects of lentivirus-mediated knockdown of MOR in the VTA on amphetamine cross-sensitization, VTA BDNF expression and cellular co-localization of AKT with GABA or DA in the VTA.\n\nMethods: We used lentivirus-mediated gene transfer and RNA interference to induce persistent VTA MOR knockdown. Short hairpin MOR or control scrambled virus constructs were infused bilaterally into the VTA of adult Sprague Dawley rats. Intermittent social defeat stress consisted of four brief confrontations between the experimental intruder rat and an aggressive resident rat over the course of 10 days. Control rats were handled according to the same schedule. Amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg, ip) challenge was performed ten days after the last stress or handling procedure. Animals were euthanized and fresh-frozen brains were removed and sectioned for MOR autoradiography using [3H]DAMGO; labeling was quantified using X-ray film co-exposed with radiostandards, and ImageJ. VTA BDNF expression and AKT labeling were examined in different groups of rats treated similarly, and perfused ten days after the last episode of stress or handling during the time period in which cross-sensitization is known to be present in defeated rats. Brains were removed and processed by immunohistochemistry for BDNF or phospho-AKT and either glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD 65/67) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to characterize labeling in GABA or dopamine neurons, respectively.\n\nResults: Knockdown of MORs significantly reduced MOR binding in the VTA, thereby confirming the efficacy of MOR knockdown. VTA MOR knockdown prevented stress-induced cross-sensitization to amphetamine. Following intermittent social defeat stress, significantly more phospho-AKT labeling was found in VTA GABA cells than in DA cells. In rats with intact VTA MORs, intermittent social stress significantly increased AKT phosphorylation in GABA cells by more than three times that seen in handled rats. By contrast, VTA MOR knockdown prevented intermittent social stress-induced AKT phosphorylation in GABA cells. VTA MOR knockdown and a history of social stress produced significantly fewer phospho-AKT-labeled GABAergic VTA cells. In addition, MOR knockdown prevented social stress-induced increase of VTA BDNF labeling.\n\nConclusions: These results provide evidence that intermittent social defeat stress-induced MOR upregulation in VTA GABA cells is necessary for amphetamine cross-sensitization. Subsequent phosphorylation of AKT downstream of VTA MORs may alter VTA GABA transmission in a phospho-AKT-dependent manner, possibly by facilitating the insertion GABA-A receptors into the cell membrane. Such MOR-dependent, phospho-AKT-mediated reduction of local VTA GABA transmission would disinhibit DA neurons, and could explain both amphetamine cross-sensitization and the MOR-dependent stress-induced increases of VTA BDNF. These data reveal that cross-sensitization following social defeat stress is accompanied by increased phospho-AKT in GABA cells and BDNF in DA neurons, all of which are prevented by knockdown of VTA MORs, suggesting that MOR-AKT signaling may serve as a potential target for the intervention of stress-induced drug-sensitization.\n\nKeywords: social stress, cross-sensitization, GABA, mu-opioid receptors.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\n\nT25. Brain-enriched Sorting Nexin Family Proteins Regulate Spine Morphogenesis and Are Associated with Risk for Schizophrenia\n\nTakanobu Nakazawa*, Ryota Hashimoto, Asami Tanimura, Kazutaka Ohi, Hidenaga Yamamori, Yuka Yasuda, Satomi Umeda-Yano, Yuji Kiyama, Kohtarou Konno, Takafumi Inoue, Shusuke Numata, Tohru Ohnuma, Nakao Iwata, Norio Ozaki, Hitoshi Hashimoto, Masahiko Watanabe, Toshiya Manabe, Tadashi Yamamoto, Masatoshi Takeda, Masanobu Kano\n\nOsaka University, Osaka, Japan\n\nBackground: Accumulating evidence suggests that altered function and morphology of synapses in central neurons underlie pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We previously identified novel brain-enriched sorting nexin proteins, ARHGAP32 and ARHGAP33, both of which have Rho GTPase-activating (RhoGAP) activity. These proteins constitute a subfamily in the large RhoGAP family of proteins, because, in addition to the RhoGAP domain, they unusually share their PX domain which is involved in surface protein trafficking. Genetic manipulation of ARHGAP32 and ARHGAP33 resulted in altered spine morphology, suggesting the possible involvement of these genes in schizophrenia.\n\nMethods: We investigated the possible association between schizophrenia and the ARHGAP32 and ARHGAP33 genes using samples from schizophrenia patients. We further examined the molecular roles of these genes in schizophrenia using genetically-engineered mice.\n\nResults: We found single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with risk for schizophrenia at both the ARHGAP32 and ARHGAP33 gene loci. The allele of the ARHGAP32 gene, which was overrepresented in schizophrenia patients, was associated with higher scores of schizotypal personality traits in mentally healthy subjects. Likewise, the affected allele of the ARHGAP33 gene was associated with reduced brain volume in several regions of schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, we found that ARHGAP33 expression was decreas"
