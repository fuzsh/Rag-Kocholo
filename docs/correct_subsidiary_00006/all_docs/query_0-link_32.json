For certain securities that are not rated by any of these three agencies, credit ratings from other agencies may be used. Where the rating agencies rate a security differently, Lord Abbett uses the average rating based on numeric values assigned to each rating. Ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). Bonds rated BBB or above are considered investment grade. Credit ratings BB and below are lower-rated securities (junk bonds). High-yielding, non-investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve higher risks than investment-grade bonds. Adverse conditions may affect the issuer's ability to pay interest and principal on these securities. A portion of the portfolio's securities may not be rated. Breakdown is not an S&P credit rating or an opinion of S&P as to the creditworthiness of such portfolio. Ratings apply to the credit worthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not the fund or its shares. Ratings may be subject to change.\n\nINVESTMENT TEAM\n\nKaren J.

We believe that CCCs offer the best relative value given the recent compression in spreads across high yield ratings tiers as well as the overall strength of the economy. We added to select CCC positions throughout the quarter in sectors such as Healthcare and Basic Industry. While we are still constructive on credit in general given the resilience in the U.S. economy, we do remain vigilant on adding to companies in sectors that may be more susceptible to default risk as interest rates remain higher for longer. We have funded these purchases with higher-rated, call constrained BBs where we view valuations are tight. The Fund is now overweight CCCs relative to the benchmark, while underweight BBs.\n\nThe Fund continued to be primarily overweight Basic Industry and Energy sectors. We remain constructive in the Basic Industry and Energy sectors as a result of improving credit quality, stickier inflation, and positive cyclicality. We also view the potential for ongoing merger & acquisition activity as an added potential tailwind for these sectors. Within Basic Industry, the primary overweights continue to be Metals and Mining and Chemicals, the latter of which have benefited from meaningful destocking of inventories over the last several months. Within Energy, we remain focused on E&P and Oil Field Services subsectors, but with a renewed focus on offshore energy as an attractive opportunity to find relative value. The Fund also continues to be overweight sectors such as Capital Goods and Transportation. Conversely, the portfolio finished the quarter underweight sectors such as Media, Real Estate and Services.\n\nThe Fund maintained modest exposure to off-benchmark sectors. We generally believe that select exposures to non-high yield sectors can offer attractive risk-reward opportunities, potential portfolio diversification benefits, and avenues for liquidity. While the Fund has the flexibility to toggle allocations to off-benchmark asset classes, such as bank loans and convertible bonds, we continue to view traditional high yield corporate bonds as broadly attractive relative value compared to other sectors.\n\nWe view high yield as an opportunity to capture high-quality carry. We remain constructive in high yield credit considering the overall resilience of the U.S. economy. Inflation has been stickier than anticipated and may remain above the Fed's target, which could cause elevated rate, and risk-asset volatility. However, the default outlook for 2024 is expected to be manageable and similar to, if not modestly better than in 2023. Despite the presence of higher policy rates, high yield bond issuers' balance sheets have remained robust, and we believe that the corporate sector will maintain financial discipline, with high yield companies possibly benefitting from strategic mergers and acquisitions by higher-rated companies. Looking ahead, we are focused on maintaining a cyclical approach in the Fund and targeting down-in-quality securities, with emphasis on commodities, consumer cyclicals, and sectors benefiting from the potential for modestly lower financing rates in the year ahead.\n\nPortfolio Details as of 06/28/2024\n\nTotal Net Assets\n\n$3.61 B\n\nAverage Effective Duration\n\n3.59 Years\n\nAverage Maturity\n\n5.2 Years\n\nNumber of Issues\n\n718\n\nAverage Yield to Maturity\n\n8.51%\n\nTo view definitions for the above Portfolio Details, Click here.\n\nYield to maturity (YTM) represents the expected total return on a bond (expressed as an annualized rate) based on the bond’s expected future cash flows, including coupon payments over the life of the bond and the bond’s principal value received at maturity.\n\nAverage Maturity - The length of time until the average security in a portfolio will mature or be redeemed by its issuer in proportion to its dollar value. Indicating a portfolio’s sensitivity to general market interest rate changes, a longer average maturity implies greater relative portfolio volatility.\n\nAverage Effective Duration - The change in the value of a fixed income security that will result from a 1% change in interest rates, taking into account anticipated cash flow fluctuations from mortgage prepayments, puts, adjustable coupons, and potential call dates. Duration is expressed as a number of years, and generally, the larger a duration, the greater the interest-rate risk or reward for a portfolio’s underlying bond prices. Where applicable, certain investments, such as common or preferred stock, convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock, ETFs, ADRs, and CPI swaps and related futures, are excluded from these calculations.\n\nHolding Coupon Maturity Assets\n\nVistra Operations Co LLC 7.750% 10/15/2031 0.6% Frontier Communications Holdings LLC 6.000% 01/15/2030 0.6% Cloud Software Group Inc 9.000%
