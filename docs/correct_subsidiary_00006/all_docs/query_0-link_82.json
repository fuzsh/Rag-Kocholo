        "text": "Text Citations\n\nReferences must be limited to readily accessible published material; i.e., those available from libraries, databases, and other public sources. All references must be numbered and cited in numerical order in the text. The list should be a complete and comprehensive representation of available literature, reflecting the state of the art as it pertains to the scope of the paper. Authors must reference the original source of a work, not a secondary source. Classified or export-restricted references, private communications, personal websites, and websites where there is no commitment to archiving may be mentioned parenthetically in the text or in a footnote but should not be cited in the reference list. A reference that is not reliably available is of no use to readers.\n\nEach numbered reference citation in the text is enclosed in brackets as in the following examples:\n\nIt is shown by Smith [4] that …\n\nThe effect of … should be taken into account [5].\n\nFor example, see Refs. [6, 7].\n\nFurther documentation can be found in [8-10].\n\nOn the rare occasion when a specific page number or page range needs to accompany a citation within the text, include it within the brackets in the following manner:\n\nThis procedure was proposed by Gelb [11, p. 250]\n\nThe solution can be found in Rogers [12, pp.14-18].\n\nWhen multiple author names are cited in the text, list up to two authors, as in “Walsh and Jones,” but use “et al.” with three or more authors, as in “Walsh et al.”\n\nList of References\n\nTo avoid production delays, all references must be complete prior to acceptance of a manuscript. The following list gives examples of commonly lacking information:\n\nAll authors to a reference (do not use “et al.” in the reference list)\n\nFull journal or book titles and publisher names (no abbreviations)\n\nInclusive page numbers for journal articles and page or chapter numbers for books, when appropriate\n\nJournal volume and issue numbers (or months)\n\nLocations of report sponsors (e.g., companies and universities)\n\nComplete publishing information for proceedings (i.e., the same as for other books)\n\nA URL that includes the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) should be incorporated into every reference for which it is available. A DOI is an identifier of intellectual property entities on digital networks. DOIs provide a system for persistent identification and interoperable exchange of managed information, and they are commonly assigned to journal articles, ebooks, research reports, and data sets. A DOI forms a permanent URL that begins https://doi.org/ and is the preferred link; see examples below for how to include a URL in a reference. For more information on DOIs and their value, visit www.doi.org or www.crossref.org.\n\nFor all references: Spell out everything except AIAA, NASA, NACA, AGARD, and NATO; months may be abbreviated.\n\nFollow these examples for format; double-space the reference list in your manuscript:\n\nChapter in a Book\n\n[1] Turner, M.
