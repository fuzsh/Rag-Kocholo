        "text": "Hassan Ahmed is at it again.\n\nThe one-time CEO of Westford’s Sonus Networks Inc. is now at the helm of Affirmed Networks, an Acton-based software company targeting the mobile networking market.\n\nAffirmed, which is based in Nagog Park, announced this week that it raised a $51 million round of venture capital. It’s one of the largest rounds reported this year by a Greater Lowell company.\n\nThe startup had previously raised $52 million in a pair of previous rounds.\n\nAffirmed said in a statement that the funding strongly positions it to “support multiple deployments and numerous trials throughout the world while expanding its carrier-grade virtualization solutions.”\n\nBessemer Venture Partners, which has several locations (including Boston) led the funding with participation by KCK Group. Existing investors Charles River Ventures, Matrix Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Vodafone Ventures and T-Venture (the venture arm of Deutsche Telekom) also contributed, the company reported in a news release.\n\nAhmed left Sonus, one of the pioneering Internet-protocol networking companies, in May 2008 after 10 years. He guided the company through the networking industry’s so-called “nuclear winter” of the early 2000s, keeping it independent as consolidation elsewhere resulted.\n\nEarlier in his carreer, Ahmed was chief technology officer at Westford-based Cascade Communications, where he worked with Sycamore Networks founder and serial entrepreneur Gururaj “Desh” Deshpande. That company was acquired by Ascend Communications for more than $3 billion in 1997.\n\nIn 2009, Ahmed joined Charles River Ventures — one of Affirmed’s investors — as a senior adviser.\n\nAffirmed’s software is designed to give wireless operators the intelligence to simplify networks and lower costs, thus allowing them to be able to offer customers new services at Internet speed.\n\nThe company employs more than 100 people, including about 75 in Acton.\n\nComments\n\ncomments"
