        "text": "Frank Shih-Huang Chen, 67, passed away peacefully and surrounded by family on January 18, 2018 at his home in Andover, MA after a year-long battle with pancreatic cancer. He was the son of the late Mao-Tien Chen and the late Chin-Mien (Hu) Chen.\n\nBorn and raised in Tainan, Taiwan, Frank lived a life characterized by a love of family, a passion for scientific discovery, and above all, his devotion to God. He attended Taiwan’s prestigious National Chiao Tung University, graduating in 1972. After finishing compulsory military service, he married Jennifer Chiu in 1976. During this time, he was also accepted to Indiana University at Bloomington’s graduate program for computer science, and in 1978 set out to pursue a long-held dream of life in the United States. He completed his master’s degree in 1980.\n\nAttracted by the burgeoning high-tech industry in the Greater Boston area, Frank settled in Andover in 1986. Over the next two decades, he dedicated himself to the advancement of data communications technology, serving as Vice President of Engineering for a series of pioneering tech companies, including Cascade Communications, Ascend Communications, Lucent Technologies, and Airvana, Inc. At Cascade, Frank played a critical role in the development of one of the first frame relay and ATM switches in the world and was subsequently awarded a US patent for this innovation. The company went public in 1993. While at Airvana, he went on to develop the first femtocell wireless technology in the world, several years ahead of the market, and was on the executive management team when the company went public in 2007.\n\nLife in the US brought not only professional achievements, but also the privilege of a relationship with God. Together, Frank and Jennifer came to know the Lord as a young couple, and were baptized in 1981. After moving to Massachusetts, they established a spiritual home at the Chinese Bible Church of Greater Boston (CBCGB) in Lexington, MA. He was a devoted member of the CBCGB for more than twenty years, and frequently welcomed members of the church into his home for Bible study, fellowship and holiday gatherings.\n\nFrank began to encounter health challenges in 2005, when he was diagnosed with an uncommon form of kidney disease. As the illness progressed, Frank retired in 2008. In 2009, on the brink of dialysis, he underwent a successful kidney transplantation, with his loving wife as the organ donor. This miraculous gift gave him a new lease on life, allowing him to enjoy his retirement to the fullest. He traveled frequently with friends and family, worked on his golf swing, taught himself the piano and enjoyed photography, poetry and gardening. It was after the transplant that Frank joined the Free Christian Church (FCC) in Andover, a wonderful spiritual community which further grew his faith in God.\n\nFrank’s battle with pancreatic cancer began in January 2017. He bravely endured numerous courses of radiation and chemotherapy, hardships which only served to strengthen his faith in Christ. It inspired him to build new bonds with his Bible study small group as well as the FCC Senior Link community, both of which he quickly grew to love. His final weeks were spent surrounded by prayers from those in his faith community, and adoration from the many who loved him.\n\nMr. Chen is survived by his loving wife of 41 years, Jennifer C. (Chiu) Chen of Andover; daughter, Julie Y. Chen of Brooklyn, NY; and son, Daniel Frankson Chen of Andover. He is also survived by his brother, Alan Chen of Taipei, Taiwan; and sister Pi Tran Chen of Tainan, Taiwan; nieces, Yun-Yun Chen and Jenny Chen of Taipei, Taiwan, and Jihai Shi of Tainan, Taiwan; and nephew Yen-Lin Chen of Brisbane, Australia.\n\nRelatives and friends are respectfully invited to attend a wake and memorial service to celebrate the life of Frank S. Chen. The wake will be held from 3-7pm on Friday, February 2, 2018 at Cataudella Funeral Home, 126 Pleasant Valley St., Methuen. A memorial service will be held the following day, Saturday, February 3rd, at 10:30am at Free Christian Church, 31 Elm St., Andover. Burial will follow immediately at West Parish Garden Cemetery, 129 Reservation Road, Andover.\n\nIn lieu of flowers or gifts, a donation may be made in memory of Frank S. Chen to benefit pancreatic cancer research by visiting http://www.myjimmyfundpage.org/give/frankschen\n\nService Information"
