        "text": "On Monday the hotshot founders of Cascade Communications unveiled their new networking startup, Sycamore Networks, which aims to manufacture software that'll improve efficiency of fiber-optic telecommunications networks.\n\nSycamore Networks executives were sketchy in detailing their company's products. They will work on the problem of converting optical signals to electrical impulses and back again, a process that slows the flow of data through networks.\n\nTheir products are designed to let telecom companies directly connect frame relay and asynchronous-transfer-mode data traffic to the optical network.\n\nCarriers are in a race to provide cheaper bandwidth and new services to customers, said Gururaj \"Desh\" Deshpande, Sycamore’s founder and chairman. Sycamore’s clients will be \"anybody who owns fiber,\" he said. \"This is a brand new market just beginning to happen.\"\n\nThe market for Sycamore's products is about US$8 billion to $10 billion, said Deshpende. For every dollar spent on fiber, $20 to $30 is spent on lighting the electronics to get bandwidth, he said. \"This technology will minimize that cost to more like $5 or $10.\"\n\nDeshpande and Dan Smith, Sycamore's CEO and co-founder, were the former chairman and CEO, respectively, of networking company Cascade Communications. That company made high-end ATM networking devices for telecom carriers. It was bought by Ascend Communications (ASND) in July 1997, and the two took off.\n\nSycamore, which currently employs 50 people, will introduce products in the first half of 1999. The company also said it has raised $12 million in a second round of funding, bringing the total to $20 million. Venture capital partners include Matrix Partners and North Bridge Venture Partners.\n\nThe other two founders of the Tewksbury, Massachusetts, company are Richard Barry and Eric Swanson, two of the architects of the All-Optical Network, or AON, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nHere’s What Happens When You Give People Free Money\n\nOpenResearch released the first results of the most comprehensive study on giving unrestricted cash grants to impoverished Americans. Researchers say it will flame both sides of the debate over welfare.\n\nThe ACLU Fights for Your Constitutional Right to Make Deepfakes\n\nStates across the US are seeking to criminalize certain uses of AI-generated content. Civil rights groups are pushing back, arguing that some of these new laws conflict with the First Amendment.\n\nHow IT Departments Scrambled to Address the CrowdStrike Chaos\n\nSystem administrators and their teams sprang into action last Friday and worked tirelessly to get their companies back online amid one of the worst digital blackouts ever.\n\nToyota Pulls Off a Fast and Furious Demo With Dual Drifting AI-Powered Race Cars\n\nAlgorithms designed to handle a car after it loses traction could potentially intervene on behalf of human drivers.\n\nDonald Trump and Silicon Valley's Billionaire Elegy\n\nVenture capitalists Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen claim the tech industry, California, and the country are doomed if we don’t embrace the former president.\n\nHow to Get Rich From Peeping Inside People’s Fridges\n\nForget the S&P 500. Look at the ice cream. This investor visits homes around the world to see where diets—and economies—will go next."
