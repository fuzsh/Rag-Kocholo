        "text": "Pace\n\nMomentum and Growth for Content-Powered Brands\n\nPace’s 50-year success is based on the power of stories\n\nPace takes an integrated approach to helping clients get their stories out, making it an Agency of the Year Grand Prize winner in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nIn its 50 years of doing business, integrated content marketing agency Pace has found that a well-told story can inspire change, capture imagination and even start movements. By combining storytelling, content and activation (organic/paid), Pace has developed an integrated approach that fuels results across the board.\n\nPace credits its long-term success top four principles:\n\nGrowth and momentum\n\nIn 2022 Pace won more than 60% of the business it pursued, adding category-leading clients like Workday, First Citizen’s Bank, Novo Nordisk, Gerber Life Insurance and Toyota. The agency also renewed major clients like Nucor, USAA and Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, where it expanded its content producer model to serve hyperlocal web content for 126 distinct Four Seasons locations. Pace also grew its financial services and healthcare footprints to incrementally deliver more than $15 million in new content programs year over year for these industries.\n\nAuthentic impact\n\nPace prioritizes direct contributions to underserved communities and businesses, donating 10­-15% of all company profits to philanthropic causes. Via its Pace Impact Project, it also delivers creative and content services to minority-owned small businesses. Last year, these businesses saw more than 52% growth in conversions and a 250% lift in social engagement and awareness through their short-form content.\n\nPace’s discounted rates for nonprofits also make top-tier marketing programs accessible to organizations like Harlem Children’s Zone, Identiversity and Family Services of the Piedmont.\n\nBrand empowerment\n\nPace’s industry-leading practice in business-to-employee (B2E) content proved valuable during the “great resignation” and the adoption of remote work. In addition to managing B2E content programs for Walmart’s 2.5 million employees and PepsiCo’s global recruiting platform, Pace has developed robust B2E programs for numerous other brands, including talent attraction content for 7-Eleven, multiple prongs of educational content for the New York Jobs CEO Council, and a $5 million recruitment content program with the North Carolina Restaurant & Lodging Association.\n\nIndustry innovation\n\nTo help clients navigate rapid changes in the industry, Pace launched the Future of Storymaking initiative in 2022. This content hub delivers in-depth insights on artificial intelligence, user experience, Web3, the metaverse and other areas where human-centric marketing converges with cutting-edge technology — and where marketing professionals are seeking expert guidance.\n\nIn addition to results for its clients, the agency has achieved high-impact results for Pace-owned content across the Future of Storymaking platform and employee content programs, including 310% growth in content subscribers in 2022 alone, a 65% open rate for the Pace-owned email marketing program and more than 82,000 individual marketing professionals accessing Pace thought leadership content each year.\n\nCongratulations to Pace on this award-winning achievement!\n\ne.l.f. Cosmetics\n\neyes.lips.face.sticky.\n\ne.l.f Cosmetics hits the Super Bowl with secret weapon Jennifer Coolidge\n\nThe company teamed up with the popular actress to tout its newest product with a 30-second Super Bowl commercial. It’s a Grand Prize Winner for Campaign of the Year in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nIn January 2023, e.l.f. Cosmetics saw an opportunity to close out its fiscal year with a spot on the world’s biggest stage: the Super Bowl. The spot would create a viral moment for the brand and be a breakthrough moment for the beauty industry, bringing e.l.f.’s TikTok and Gen Z presence to a mass audience and catapulting its Power Grip Primer to No. 1 in mass cosmetics — ultimately surpassing 10 billion earned media impressions.\n\nWith Jennifer Coolidge’s popularity on the rise, e.l.f. saw an opportunity and attached her to the spot, which touted e.l.f.’s Power Grip Primer, a pre-makeup application. Tapping Coolidge let e.l.f. reach beyond its typical Gen Z customer to send the message that e.l.f is for everyone.\n\nStarting just three weeks before Game Day, e.l.f. enlisted communications agency Shadow to script, cast, produce, shoot and edit the brand’s first-ever commercial. The script was co-written by “White Lotus” director/writer Mike White, Coolidge’s trusted collaborator and friend, who helped capture her voice and tap into her unique comedic style.\n\nThe commercial was just one component of a broader campaign. The company planned to amplify its 30 seconds in the spotlight into a cultural moment. It shared assets and information in a steady pulse of news, and ensured every aspect of the campaign (talent, product, platform) had its own PR hook.\n\nAfter the spot ran, e.l.f.’s Power Grip Primer became first-ever primer in mass cosmetics history to earn the No. 1 SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) spot, with one primer sold every four seconds, driving a 68% increase in new users to elfcosmetics.com week over week. The spot and campaign garnered 10 billion earned media impressions in 24 hours and 57 billion globally, with 65 million paid and organic media impressions across TV, TikTok and Instagram over five days.\n\nThe spot generated blanket coverage from the press in industries and channels that don’t typically cover e.l.f, — beauty to entertainment, men’s interest and hype culture, and across broadcast, digital, podcasts, radio and more.\n\nCongratulations to e.l.f. on this award-winning achievement!\n\nBPM-PR Firm\n\nBellabeat Media Campaign\n\nSolid PR overcomes a negative review for the Bellabeat Ivy\n\nBPM-PR Firm took on the assignment of recovering momentum for a women’s wearable health app. It’s a Grand Prize winner for Strategy of the Year in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nThe Bellabeat Ivy is a unique health tracker for women. It is a wearable device that monitors and tracks a woman’s daily routine and her body’s bio-responses and correlates the data with her menstrual cycle, pregnancy and other data points like symptoms or moods.\n\nUnfortunately, a negative TechCrunch review threatened to scare both consumers and investors away for the new product launch, so Bellabeat approached BPM-PR to mitigate the damage in the heart of the 2021 holiday season and ensure a stellar 2022 first-quarter media presence to ensure product and mobile app success.\n\nBPM-PR promptly established a strategic plan to garner strong media while Bellabeat made edits to its mobile app. BPM-PR studied the situation and realized it couldn’t pursue large tech media immediately after the downbeat TechCrunch review. Instead, it would enter through another market and then move slowly into larger technology media.\n\nThe campaign took a strong stance — that the device was a stunning wearable jewelry statement, suitable for the fashion, lifestyle and wellness media market. This approach positioned the Bellabeat Ivy as a device for a woman in every stage of her life, from the onset of her period through fertility planning, pregnancy and menopause. This strategy enabled the team to saturate the news at a faster rate for fashion, beauty and lifestyle segments on top national news.\n\nThe effort included tactics like Olivia Culpo’s endorsement announcement to media for the Bellabeat Ivy to press surrounding Bellabeat’s International Women’s Day campaign and quickly rose to prominence in the news with responsive media initiatives to issues like the overturn of Roe v. Wade and privacy data concerns. BPM-PR also recruited OBGYN, endometriosis, fitness and meditation experts to incorporate into the PR strategy, and enlisted experts for the Bellabeat Podcast, to provide quotes on nutrition, menstrual cycle stages, postpartum depression, sexual health, mental health and wellness.\n\nBPM-PR Firm’s campaign secured top coverage in national and international media, Time, Fox News, “Good Morning America,” Digital Trends and more. One of the highlights of the campaign came when Bellabeat finally began receiving large technology media placements with positive reviews in outlets like the Verge. The campaign ultimately generated more than 195 media placements, not including television, with a total ad value estimate of more than $34 million and a UVM (unique visitors per month) estimate of more than 3 million impressions.\n\nCongratulations to the teams behind this initiative!\n\nCRC Group\n\nCRC Group Marketing Team\n\nCRC Group’s marketing team does it all\n\nThe team works on more than 300 projects a month, from long-form articles to podcasts to events. It’s the Team of the Year in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nAn eight–person marketing team supports CRC Group, one of North America’s leading wholesale specialty insurance distributors with more than 46 brands across three divisions. The team manages more than 300 projects per month, ranging from graphic design work, email marketing and strategy, and more, including multimedia content for its written article series “Tools + Intel” and the “Placing You First Podcast.”\n\nThe team produces 44 original articles per year highlighting important industry topics. These articles garner an average of 50,000 visitors per month on the CRC Group website and are shared across social platforms and in personalized email campaigns. The articles position CRC Group as a thought leader, always ahead of the market. In addition, the team produces monthly external newsletters, recapping and sharing the most talked-about articles and blog posts, also shared across multiple channels.\n\nOther work includes the award-winning “Placing You First Podcast,” an interview-style podcast that dives deeper into our most widely read articles. The podcast has achieved more than 100,000 downloads and 3,000+ YouTube views. Over the last five years, it has won the Gold Winner award for “Podcast of the Year” from the Insurance Marketing and Communication Association (2022), along with a Silver winner for podcast series and a Bronze winner for single podcast.\n\nThe team also creates quarterly analytical indices and multiple yearly industry reports, as well as social media content and campaigns for several accounts; one of them, the CRC Group LinkedIn page, has more than 3 million monthly views and 36,000 followers — a 414% increase over the last five, years due to its high-quality, engaging content.\n\nIn addition to print, media, graphic design and PR, the marketing team supports and plans more than 30 events per year, ranging from small 30-person, multi-day meetings to 100+ person tailgate parties and sporting events and 450+ person incentive trips and conferences. The team plans and executes all aspects of these events including branded elements, signage, social media campaigns, swag, menus, invitations, lodging, logistics and more.\n\nOn top of all this, the team works with thousands of teammates across CRC Group’s corporate brands to fulfill individual project requests and produce marketing materials, website profiles, professional bios, business collateral and presentations for hundreds of distinct product lines and websites, fitting the style and branding of more than 46 individual brands.\n\nCongratulations to CRC Group for this award-studded achievement!\n\nRevmade\n\nThe Compass with Revmade\n\nThe Compass offers a lifeline to travel advisors\n\nThe publication targets top travel advisors with content on serving travelers and growing their businesses. It’s a winner for B2B Campaigns in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, with travel advisors facing a new surge of customer demand, the Compass positioned itself as a trusted source of business tools and guidance. The Compass comes from VAX VacationAccess, a leisure travel marketplace where travel advisors can research, market and sell vacations to their customers. The media entity targets the top 5% of travel advisors (a group that drove more than $1 billion in business in 2022), providing insights on how to manage their small businesses.\n\nWorking with Revmade, the Compass’ 2022 business strategy aimed to guide advisors in managing the increase of business, drive advisors to the VAX platform more frequently and establish The Compass brand with potential advertisers.\n\nThe Compass relied on tried-and-true B2B tactics: producing unique, high-value editorial content; speaking directly to a powerful but underserved subset of the travel advisor profession; and monetizing through non-competitive partnerships. The Compass sells strategic sponsorships that include digital and print inventory (print ads are still valued for their glossy panoramas).\n\nThe effort exceeded VAX’s goals. The Compass Magazine, profitable since its launch in 2020, had a record-breaking year in 2022 in terms of media revenue. With its digital strategy, The Compass has seen a 41% year-over-year increase in users on its site, reaching more than 4 million users — a 168% increase compared to 2020. A survey of Compass readers found that 91% took action based on content about their trade, growing their business or helping clients.\n\nBravo to compass on these impactful results.\n\nPurdue University\n\nWhat Can You Imagine at Purdue?\n\nPurdue ad focuses on the possibilities of students’ futures\n\nThe university wanted to present a full picture of what it offers across a lifetime. It’s a winner for Campaign for Educational Institution in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nPurdue University wanted to show what makes it unique. Instead of picturesque campuses, happy students and national rankings, it wanted to illustrate the possibilities waiting for anyone willing to take small steps and giant leaps toward a challenging and rewarding future.\n\nIts ad, “What can you imagine at Purdue?” centers on a moment between a father and daughter discussing the potential the future offers, displaying how Purdue provides an opportunity at all stages of education and life. The ad also was created to build affinity for the Purdue Global brand among its network of more than 675,000 alumni.\n\nThe idea was to depict the lifelong journey available through Purdue’s entire brand family, from Purdue Polytechnic High Schools to its flagship campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, to Purdue Global for adult learners. The narrative starts with a young girl imagining all the possibilities ahead of her. Throughout her Purdue journey, we see her dreaming big, taking risks, failing, succeeding and then trying again and again.\n\nTo build target audiences, the team responsible for the ad segmented viewership into three categories: viewers ages 18-54, prospective Black students and their families, and anyone with an interest in higher education. They opted to use skippable YouTube ads, focusing on grabbing the audience with Purdue-branded elements within the first ad’s five seconds. This approach used budget dollars more effectively and generated a higher-than-average view duration — 80% compared to the industry standard of 50%.\n\nThe ad also aired on broadcast television during several high-profile moments, including the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Big Ten Championship and the Citrus Bowl.\n\nAs of June 21, 2023, the ad had amassed more than 28 million YouTube views, with 8 million views in its first 25 days. The commercial quickly rose on social media as well, earning 171,242 views and 678,864 impressions since its release. Just 29 days after airing, the ad surpassed a 15-year-old video as the most-viewed video on the Purdue YouTube channel.\n\nCongratulations to Purdue for developing this award-winning work!\n\nCLYDE + Rosslyn BID\n\nMary-Claire Burick soars as a thought leader while strengthening her community engagement\n\nMary-Claire Burick, president of Virginia’s Rosslyn Business Improvement District, used LinkedIn to enhance her name and cachet around her community, making her a winner for Executive Visibility in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nAs president of the Rosslyn Business Improvement District (BID) in Arlington County, Virginia for the past 10 years, Mary-Claire Burick has led efforts to help Rosslyn evolve from a commercial district into a vibrant community for life and work. Over the past year, Burick has worked with communications and public affairs agency the Clyde Group to amplify and strengthen her engagement with the community, its stakeholders and the broader network.\n\nThe Clyde Group curated targeted content in buckets aligned with Burick’s expertise:\n\nOrganizational development, employee engagement, change management and women in business.\n\nBID management, placemaking/place management, the Arlington community, Rosslyn BID news/events and transportation.\n\nReturn to office, workplace culture, hybrid amenities/best practices, talent pipeline and employee development.\n\nBy curating posts to focus on the local community, along with communicating back-to-work themes and trends, Burick used her LinkedIn platform to offer a fresh perspective for individuals and business professionals who are working through similar issues.\n\nBurick posts on LinkedIn at least twice a week. She’s shared updates during the networking events she attended and promoted events in Rosslyn, along with offering thought leadership on navigating the ever-changing workforce environment.\n\nAs a result, Burick’s LinkedIn page has gained nearly 200 new followers, and her average engagement each month ranges between 2.5-3%, well above the LinkedIn industry standard. She has published more than 60 posts in the last year to more than 4,300 followers. Burick has reached other business leaders in the community, with every post of hers since January 2023 onward being most viewed by readers with the titles of “president, founder, CEO” and “managing director.” Her posts have also been featured on LinkedIn News.\n\nIn addition, Burick was featured on The Washington Business Journal’s annual Power 100 list for 2022, highlighting leaders who have made significant strides in strengthening their communities, and the International Downtown Association named her as the newest appointee to its Board of Directors.\n\nCongratulations to Mary-Claire Burick for building this impactful community.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer's The Antigen Podcast - Season 3\n\nPfizer podcast expands its range beyond COVID-19\n\nFor season three, ‘”The Antigen” podcast explored maternal vaccinations in the wake of RSV. It’s a winner for Healthcare Campaign in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nPfizer became well-known during the COVID-19 pandemic for developing one of the first safe and effective vaccines. But Pfizer develops other vaccines. As cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) began to rise across the U.S. in 2021-2022, it became clear there was a need to place a focus on maternal vaccines. Pfizer’s flagship podcast, “The Antigen,” was the perfect vehicle.\n\nInitially launched as an eight-part series, the podcast has produced 18 episodes across three seasons, and has stood in the top 1% of podcasts globally since its debut. For season three, Pfizer produced a three-episode series focusing on maternal immunization, exploring different channels and formats to encourage high engagement across target audiences. The goal: Inspire the public to learn more about the science behind maternal vaccines and their benefits, as well as expand their knowledge of Pfizer’s expertise beyond COVID-19.\n\nThe podcast brought together three experts both inside and outside of Pfizer — people who have made significant contributions to the maternal immunization field. Together with “The Antigen’s” host, these experts discussed the maternal vaccine story from the viewpoints of a pediatric infectious disease specialist, a health policy research scientist and the head of clinical research and development at Pfizer.\n\nThe series was promoted with a multichannel campaign on Pfizer.com, podcast platforms, ads, email newsletters, in-person events, social media, digital banners and more.\n\nSeason three of “The Antigen” reached the top 20 of Apple’s Life Sciences Charts in the U.S. The podcast increased its average downloads from the previous season by 128%, reached more than 14 million people through its variety of promotional tactics.\n\nCongratulations to the team behind this powerful podcast.\n\ne.l.f. Cosmetics\n\nIt’s an e.l.f.ing Glow Storm\n\nFor the holidays, e.l.f. Cosmetics launches a weather-based campaign\n\nThe company partnered with the Weather Channel and a Grammy Award winner to tout its in-demand holiday products. It’s a winner for Influencer Marketing in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\ne.l.f Cosmetics had a hit on its hands — the Halo Glow Liquid Filter, which had accumulated a 75,000-person waitlist. For the 2022 holiday season, e.l.f wanted to seize on its popularity with a campaign marketing its collection of holiday glow products.\n\nResearch suggested that eight out of 10 women change their beauty techniques with the seasons, so e.l.f. partnered with the Weather Channel for the campaign. Working with the agency Shadow, they also partnered with Grammy award-winning singer Meghan Trainor for a push on TikTok. Trainor is a draw for e.l.f.’s Gen-Z target audience, and TikTok presence is innovative and influential. The Weather Channel partnership gave the campaign a cross-generational reach, allowing e.l.f. to capture other audiences.\n\ne.l.f. and Shadow planned and executed the campaign in just two weeks, an effort that included talent casting, creative direction, scripting, content production, motion design, social strategy, PR strategy and two days of a guerilla stunt: Twenty editors and more than 1,000 consumers throughout New York City were treated to surprise product deliveries from an iridescent “Glow Plow and Beauty Doppler Glow Storm” truck from e.l.f.\n\nThe holiday campaign garnered more than 5 billion earned media impressions in business, trade, entertainment, lifestyle and beauty outlets, including stories in AdWeek, AdAge, People Magazine and more. The media coverage was positive, with editors praising the unlikely partnership and the use of talent. Within the first week, the campaign garnered over 10 million video views, with more than 63% revenue growth in the Glowcast product portfolio.\n\nCongratulations to e.l.f. for its award-winning work!\n\nFortisBC Energy Inc.\n\nRenewable Natural Gas Campaign\n\nFortisBC spreads the word on renewable natural gas\n\nFortisBC needed to increase awareness of Renewable Natural Gas as a low-carbon energy solution for British Columbians. It’s a winner for Integrated Content Marketing Campaigns in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nRenewable natural gas (RNG) is vital to achieving a lower-carbon future for British Columbia. FortisBC knew that British Columbians needed to know about renewable energies, including that RNG is available to customers today, and that RNG can help customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nRNG is produced differently than conventional natural gas. It’s a biogas, produced from decomposing organic waste in landfills, agricultural waste and wastewater, then captured and cleaned to create low-carbon biomethane. FortisBC works with local farms, landfills, green energy companies and municipalities to capture and purify the methane, which would otherwise escape into the atmosphere, to create RNG for its customers.\n\nFortisBC aimed to increase awareness and familiarity of RNG amongst key target audiences with a comprehensive marketing program. The campaign had several facets:\n\nWeb strategy. FortisBC enhanced the content on its “So, what is RNG anyway?” web page to include new information, and reviewed RNG pages on fortisbc.com, updating the content for consistency.\n\nSocial media. The company used its organic social media channels for video and new creative content, including X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram posts and stories.\n\nPaid media. A two-tiered plan focused on corporate positioning, as well as RNG education and awareness. The strategy included residential elevator digital ads, digital display ads, news website placements of native ads, paid social media (including a Facebook instant experience), radio spots, podcasts and print.\n\nOwned channels. FortisBC’s channels include “Energy Moment,” a residential e-newsletter; “Energy Brief,” a commercial e-newsletter and “Energy Exchange,” a Linkedin e-newsletter. There’s also a secure customer portal, the FortisBC.com homepage and customer bill inserts.\n\nEarned media. FortisBC produced magazine articles and news releases for the media.\n\nThe strategy generated a 3,364% increase in traffic to the campaign webpage, with a 167% increase in 30-second timed visits. Ratings of FortisBC’s efforts to find new ways of generating renewable energy from natural resources reached peak levels at the end of the advertising run.\n\nCongratulations to FortisBC for igniting this award-winning work!\n\nBCW Global\n\nCircle K Fuel Days\n\nFuel up! Circle K’s Fuel Days provide a break at the pump and a boost to the brand\n\nThe convenience store chain offered substantial discounts on its gas within a tight window — and won media coverage for the event. It’s a winner for Media Relations Campaigns in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nThe idea behind Circle K’s Fuel Days is straightforward: To drive brand recognition around its Circle K brand fuel, the convenience store chain offers an aggressive discount — 30 to 40 cents a gallon — within a three-hour window on Memorial Day and Labor Day, the traditional start and end of summer. In 2022, Circle K successfully held two national and 10 local Fuel Day events and followed up in 2023 with an eye on achieving a greater impact.\n\nFor each event, Circle K’s agency BCW Global first drafted key messages designed to inform press releases, pitches and influencer playbooks. As the messages were finalized, the agency compiled a comprehensive media list.\n\nLeading up to National Fuel Day, the agency conducted outreach to select local and national media with a press release under embargo until the morning before. For local Fuel Days, media was pitched 24 hours in advance without a wire release. On the morning of all Fuel Day events, BCW Global conducted aggressive follow-ups with the media and coordinated with local outlets to schedule interviews.\n\nWorking with a media vendor partner, the agency facilitated a guaranteed market tour (GMT) that strategically placed 60-second news-style segments on either side of affiliate-network newscasts in 14 markets. The GMT ensured broadcast penetration in select markets with a fully branded 60-second informational news package. In addition, an audio news release reached customers in their cars. Both tactics went live within 24 hours of Fuel Days.\n\nAll these efforts led to record fuel sales during the three-hour sale windows, with customers across the country literally lining up for discounted fuel. Media coverage included outlets such as USA Today, Newsweek, MSN, Fox Business and more. Local broadcasts in areas like El Paso and Phoenix hosted live segments during their morning shows before the sale and also during the afternoon sales window. Coverage drove a 1,500% traffic increase to the Circle K brand website, breaking records and making brand history.\n\nCongratulations to Circle K!\n\nBIC & M Booth\n\nA Life Less Clogged with BIC EasyRinse and Ariana Madix\n\nRazor meets reality TV when Bic teams up with ‘Vanderpump Rules’ star\n\nTo tout its new no-clog razor, Bic partnered with reality TV star Ariana Madix in the wake of #Scandoval. It’s a winner for Product Launch in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nBic found the perfect moment to spotlight its new EasyRinse razor, which boasts patented anticlogging technology: #Scandoval. Reality TV stars Ariana Madix and Tom Sandoval from Bravo’s hit show “Vanderpump Rules” split because of a cheating scandal. When the story hit, Bic recognized an opportunity to partner with Madix on a social media play addressing a need to “unclog” her life.\n\nBic had just launched a humorous 360-marketing campaign called “All Shave. No Clog.” The #Scandoval drama clogging up all aspects of Madix’s life seemed to tap into a universal human truth about the messy end of a relationship. Bic wanted to support her as she entered a new “unclogged” era.\n\nTo generate mass awareness, Bic partnered with Madix to write, produce and edit a 30-second video for Instagram Reels and TikTok. In the video, Madix breaks her silence about what’s been clogging up her life lately, noting that she’s ready to talk about something that’s been keeping her from living her best life. The catch? That “something” is revealed as a razor clogged with hair. With Bic EasyRinse, Madix claims she starting a new “unclogged” chapter of her life.\n\nBic boosted Madix’s organic Instagram Reel, targeting women with interests in Bravo and Vanderpump Rules, to drive mass reach across the platform. It also posted the video on connected TV platforms like YouTube.\n\nThe overwhelming response to the video prompted Bic to air the video during three highly anticipated “Vanderpump Rules” reunion episodes. Each week, the brand added a different end-card to the spot, underneath the “All Shave. No Clog” tagline (the first read “For men and women (except what’s-his-name).”\n\nSales of the women’s EasyRinse razor rose by more than 33% in the five weeks following the social post on Madix’s pages. The video had more than 22 million organic views on Instagram Reels and TikTok, the most organic views on any Reel posted by Madix as of June 20, 2023. The 388 media stories garnered more than 9.1 billion impressions, 98% of them outside of beauty and trade verticals.\n\nBravo to these teams for their award-winning work!\n\niQ 360\n\nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids: Addressing the Youth Vaping Epidemic in Hawaii\n\nAfter a defeat, iQ 360 campaign takes aim at flavored e-cigarettes\n\niQ 360 launched a campaign urging legislators to protect the youth of Hawaii. It’s a winner for Public Health Campaigns in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nIn 2019, 30.6% of Hawaii high school students used e-cigarettes (compared to a national average of 19.6%). Hawaii also had the highest reported vaping rate among middle schoolers — 15.7%. A bill to ban flavored tobacco products used in e-cigarettes during Hawaii’s 2022 legislative season looked promising, but it was ultimately amended to the point that the governor vetoed it for having no significant impact.\n\nFor the 2023 session, iQ 360 developed a campaign using both paid advertising and earned media to shape public perception around vaping, work with members of the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK) Hawaii and create widespread support for anti-vaping, anti-flavors bills.\n\niQ 360 and the CTFK team identified elected officials who would be key decision makers throughout the legislative process. The strategy to reach these elected officials included targeting publications and media outlets that are frequently read by legislators and their staffs, as well as geo-targeting the state capitol to ensure ads were delivered directly to the target audience.\n\niQ 360 created ads celebrating elected officials who signed CTFK’s pledge to say “No” to tobacco money and “Yes” to protecting Hawaii’s youth. It also sent postcards to 40,000 households thanking elected officials who signed the pledge. The team also raised awareness with print ads on the local youth vaping epidemic featuring statistics about how Hawaii has some of the highest rates of youth vaping in the nation – especially in the more rural Hawaiian Islands.\n\nFor the upcoming legislative session, the team developed the “Shave Ice” advertising campaign. The campaign featured a shave ice truck appealing to children with playful music and tasty flavors but adding toxic chemicals to each product, much like such flavored tobacco products as strawberry, passionfruit and blue razz. The ”Shave Ice” ad ran in print, digital, TV, radio, YouTube and on outdoor signage.\n\niQ 360 also secured earned media placements for articles in state and regional publications. Three local doctors authored an article explaining how flavors encourage tobacco addiction in young people; Hawaii Island Mayor Mitch Roth contributed an op-ed calling on lawmakers to vote to pass legislation protecting local youth from tobacco and nicotine products; and Moani Yamanoha, a youth council member, contributed two letters speaking on behalf of Hawaii’s youth.\n\nThe effort succeeded. In May 2023, the state legislature passed SB 975, taxing and regulating e-cigarettes like other tobacco products, and Governor Josh Green signed it into law on June 6; the bill will take effect in January 2024.\n\nCongratulations to the minds that brought this impactful and important work to life.\n\nHoffman York\n\nVisit Montana\n\nKeeping Yellowstone on tourists’ map\n\nAfter floods closed the entrance to Yellowstone National Park, a campaign to support tourism in the surrounding communities kept the park relevant. It’s a winner for Purpose-Driven Campaigns in PR Daily’s Content Management Awards.\n\nIn June 2022, catastrophic flooding damaged Yellowstone National Park’s iconic entrance outside of Gardiner, Montana, threatening tourism in the park and its surrounding communities. That called for an emergency marketing and communications plan from Hoffman York, working with Visit Montana, to keep people coming back to Yellowstone.\n\nThe plan was executed in two phases:\n\nPhase one\n\nThe objective was to generate local and national media coverage that would create awareness that Montana was still open for business, educate tourists on activities available outside of Yellowstone and highlight the community’s resilience.\n\nHoffman York issued weekly press releases to communicate updates around the park in real-time, pitching the releases to key markets and trade media. It also worked with in-state experts to answer questions about the flooding and encourage travelers to visit areas surrounding Yellowstone, consulting with community leaders to determine what activities were available.\n\nThirty-two custom Instagram story frames were created to promote travel around the park and provide real-time updates to potential visitors, both in-state and out-of-state. Tourists also received updates and information through the Visit MT Instagram page.\n\nIn addition, Hoffman York partnered with the Paramount network to use actors from the hit TV show “Yellowstone” in a video PSA for the park and the surrounding area to encourage travel; the PSA was shared on Visit Montana and Paramount’s social channels.\n\nPhase two\n\nTo create national buzz, Hoffman York partnered with talk-show host and actor Drew Barrymore, who visited Montana to show viewers firsthand that communities around Yellowstone were open for business. In segment one, Barrymore and co-host Ross Mathews spent the day in Livingston, visiting local small businesses and meeting with the shop owners. For segment two, Barrymore fulfilled one of her bucket list items and went dog sledding in the mountains just outside West Yellowstone.\n\nThe segments were shared on The Drew Barrymore Show’s website and social pages. Additionally, Barrymore provided behind-the-scenes moments on her personal Instagram page of more than 17 million followers.\n\nPhase one achieved more than 860 million potential impressions, including a radio tour with 15 interviews and a media tour that hosted journalists from Thrillist, USA Today and Global Traveler Magazine. The “Yellowstone” PSA had 150,000 plays on the Visit Montana website, along with 9,000 likes, 2,100 shares, 415 saves and 253 comments. Phase two generated 5.3 million Impressions, 1.8 million views and 22,600 engagements.\n\nCongratulations to the teams behind this far-reaching and important work.\n\nMaximus\n\nCybersecurity Marketing\n\nMaximus springboards off acquisition to position itself for growth\n\nThe federal contractor wanted to highlight its capabilities in cybersecurity, machine learning, artificial intelligence and more. It’s a winner for Technology Campaign in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nIn 2021, government contractor Maximus acquired Attain Federal, a technology service provider. This acquisition allowed Maximus to expand its focus on large-scale infrastructure technology and develop more robust capabilities across emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and cybersecurity.\n\nThis called for Maximus to prepare the market for a launch of broader cybersecurity capabilities, ensuring Maximus was positioned to become a premier cybersecurity and solutions provider.\n\nThe marketing team began by developing a new messaging framework for its entire federal business. For cybersecurity, the message focused on Maximus’ role in strategy and implementation, highlighting the company’s impressive cyber leaders. The first steps included designing a new landing page for Maximus’ cyber capabilities, which served as a hub for all marketing content. One of the first pieces of content was a cyber strategy video, which was repurposed on the website, YouTube and across social media platforms.\n\nFor written content, the team focused on e-books, articles and blog posts to drive demand and provide thought leadership. These pieces of content were used to build credibility for the company’s cyber experts, leading to invitations to participate in event panels, media interviews and podcasts.\n\nThought leadership and content were complemented with sponsorships at top industry events and key industry trade publications, resulting in additional speaking opportunities and sponsored content articles that amplified the marketing content’s reach.\n\nAs a result of all this, Maximus’ cybersecurity business has increased since the campaign began. The Maximus marketing team delivered a 33% increase in page views, more than 76,000 impressions on social media, 202,000 impressions through digital advertising and 2.1 million impressions for thought leadership content.\n\nCongratulations to Maximus on this impressive growth!\n\nHelp at Home\n\nComprehensive Strategy Paired with a Compelling Leadership Team Position Leading Home Care Provider Help at Home as Innovator and Trusted National Partner\n\nHelp at Home aims for the top of its industry\n\nThe home care services provider launched a comprehensive campaign to earn a name for brand leadership. It’s a winner for Thought Leadership Campaign in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nAfter two years of rapid growth, Help at Home, a provider of home healthcare services, wanted to amplify the company’s expertise among key B2B audiences including healthcare industry leaders, health plans and state agencies.\n\nWorking with PR and ad agency Doe-Anderson, the company took a multi-pronged approach to thought leadership that focused on strategic messaging through owned and earned B2B channels, using traditional media relations, podcasts, social media, blogs, speaking engagements, award opportunities and more.\n\nThe media relations strategy focused on creating a steady drumbeat of news in industry trade publications, securing executive participation in topics related to the company’s expertise in home healthcare, aimed at increasing Help at Home’s share of voice against competitors and improving keyword pull-through of its core messaging points.\n\nTo complement the earned strategy, the messages were amplified on Help at Home’s LinkedIn channel and the Meaningful Moments podcast. The team also researched industry-related conferences and award opportunities in conjunction with the media relations editorial calendar to highlight and celebrate Help at Home’s leadership team.\n\nAs a result of all this, in 2022 the Help at Home brand received 1,200 brand media mentions for 6 billion impressions, beating out several of its competitors, and winning share of voice for many weeks in a row. Help at Home’s LinkedIn channel gained nearly 30,000 followers, with a monthly growth rate of 11.5%. The company also had an average 5% engagement rate (2% is considered “good”). In first quarter of 2023, Help at Home gained an additional 11,000 followers, with a monthly growth rate of 22%.\n\nCongratulations to Help and Home for its award-winning work!\n\nMartin County Office of Tourism & Marketing\n\nMood for Martin\n\nFloridian tourism campaign puts people in the mood for travel\n\n“Mood for Martin” drew people to Martin County, Florida with mailers, giveaways and a dedicated microsite. It’s a winner for Travel, Hospitality and Tourism Campaigns in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nMartin County, Florida considers itself a hidden gem, and the Martin County Office of Tourism and Marketing wanted to boost awareness of its charms with its “Mood for Martin” campaign, summed up by the tagline: “Whatever your mood, you’re always in the mood for Martin.”\n\nThe target audience included in-state destinations like Orlando, Miami and Tampa, as well as out-of-state markets like Atlanta and Manhattan. A new direct flight route had just been launched from New Haven, Connecticut, to Palm Beach International Airport, just 30 minutes from Martin County, and to target this emerging market, the office created direct mailers sent to more than 38,000 residents in New Haven (and Atlanta). The postcard featured a heat-sensitive element inviting recipients to “Discover Your Destiny in Our Palms.” Rubbing the element revealed a secret “Wish You Were Here” message.\n\nThe office also partnered with Atlanta Magazine on a series of “Summer of Fun” giveaways that included Atlanta Braves tickets, dining packages, museum passes, and more), culminating in a grand prize dream vacation to Martin County. The partnership included a custom giveaway landing page, full-page print ads, digital ads, social media posts and 11 custom email blasts.\n\nThe office also built a custom microsite that featured an interactive component that let visitors specify how they prefer to travel (solo, with family, with colleagues, etc.) and what they’re in the mood for when on vacation (relaxation, romance, arts and culture, unique experiences, etc.). The website then generated a customized itinerary suited for their mood. The site also housed the branded campaign video and custom blog content capturing the personality of the campaign. To encourage visits, a responsive BookDirect tool was embedded to let people review current rates, filter options, contact Martin County properties and begin planning their visit.\n\nThe campaign generated 16.3 million impressions, 525,272 page views and more than 80,000 clicks, along with 4,701 referrals to Martin County properties through the BookDirect tool. Visits to Martin County from Connecticut residents increased 13% in 2022 compared to 2021, and from fiscal year 2022-2023, the office measured a 13% increase in overall tourist development tax collections.\n\nCongratulations to the teams behind this inspiring work.\n\nANDER & Co, Inc.\n\nHot Girl Walk Miami Campaign for Cascade\n\n‘Hot Girl Walk’ leads prospects to a new luxury home\n\nAnder & Co. worked with the TikTok-inspired group to draw awareness to the luxury apartment tower Cascade in Miami. It’s a winner for both Brand Awareness and for Lead Generation in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nThe management company for Cascade, a luxury apartment tower in Miami’s Link at Douglas community, wanted to boost brand awareness and generate leasing leads, with the neighborhood’s walkability as a key selling point. Boutique POR agency Ander & Co. partnered with Hot Girl Walk to create an event focused on attracting prospects aligned with the property’s target demographic.\n\nHot Girl Walk got its start on TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraging women around the country to walk around outside to escape quarantine and feel good in their bodies. Ander wanted to introduce Cascade to an untapped target audience of fitness-minded women by selecting Hot Girl Walk Miami as the event partner. Ander also selected social media influencer Emilie Sobel to do live event content.\n\nThe event featured a walk that began and ended at Cascade, showcasing the area’s walkability. The route led participants around Link at Douglas, through the popular outdoor Shops at Merrick Park Mall and then back to Cascade, where the leasing team welcomed attendees. Local brand partners joined and contributed to the attendee experience with bites from Milam’s Market (Cascade’s ground floor retailer), Eat Me Guilt Free brownies, Odyssey Mushroom Elixir energy drinks and more, gratis, in a bazaar-style setting.\n\nThe event took place on Saturday, Feb. 25, 2023, with 110 Hot Girl Walk attendees. On social media, Cascade’s Instagram saw 64% increase in followers, a 120% increase in profile visits and a 51% increase in profile link clicks; Hot Girl Walk Miami’s recap Instagram Reel received 214 likes, 5,269 plays, 11 comments and 15 shares.\n\nBottom line? Twenty-five percent of attendees engaged in property tours during the event, resulting in multiple signed leases by the walkers!\n\nCongratulations to these teams on a successful partnership and event.\n\nFortisBC Energy Inc.\n\nIt's Been a While\n\nFortisBC’s re-engagement campaign bolsters its e-newsletter’s relevance\n\nThe energy provider crunches the numbers to identify potentially disengaged subscribers and prompt them to opt in. It’s a winner for Customer Engagement in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nEvery month, FortisBC’s e-newsletter, “Energy Moment,” provides valuable news to customers, including rebate programs, renewable energy advancements, energy-saving tips and more. Evidence of its value can be seen in its average click-through rate of 6% and open rate of 55% in 2022, compared to the industry’s rates of 2.91% and 22.71%, respectively.\n\nFor 2023, Fortis was focused on increasing engagement. The negative impact of unengaged recipients is obvious and measurable. When recipients consistently delete the newsletter or mark it as spam without opening it, it signals that the content is unwanted. To address this, FortisBC implemented a strategy to identify disengaged subscribers and offer them the option of staying connected or unsubscribing.\n\nTo start, the team established two basic criteria for identifying disengaged subscribers: not opening the email for three months, and not clicking any links in six months. With this data, the team first identified disengaged subscribers and placed them on a separate list, then filtered that list to identify common themes or groups. Next, they created a segmented re-engagement campaign to send to the selected list and used those numbers to remove disengaged customers from the subscriber’s list. Finally, the team established and automated the creation of a new list to trigger a re-engagement campaign quarterly.\n\nThe team also took the opportunity to give subscribers the option to leave feedback about the newsletter’s content.\n\nThe re-engagement campaign generated substantial results from a list of more than 280,000 subscribers: Below are the numbers from the re-engagement campaign: More than 28,000 (10%) opted in to stay connected, while 12,837 (5%) were identified as invalid emails. Just 3,288 (1%) opted out and unsubscribed, and 1,212 subscribers sent feedback.\n\nCongratulations to the teams behind this impactful campaign!\n\nANDER & Co, Inc.\n\nHot Girl Walk Miami Campaign for Cascade\n\n‘Hot Girl Walk’ leads prospects to a new luxury home\n\nAnder & Co. worked with the TikTok-inspired group to draw awareness to the luxury apartment tower Cascade in Miami.

It’s a winner for Annual Reports in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nFor its 2022 annual report, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center wanted to produce a coffee-table print magazine while using a digital-first content strategy that would propel its brand story online. The idea was to highlight success stories, show why MD Anderson is No. 1 for cancer care, increase traffic to MDAnderson.org and increase social media engagement around the report. A print magazine would inspire donors and provide the donor relations team with a stewardship piece for educating prospective donors.\n\nThe cancer center had reduced its mailing list to almost exclusively donors in 2021, so the report’s design was moved to its team of philanthropy designers who understood which concepts, papers and messages would resonate with donors and could bring a fresh perspective on design concepts that would shape the editorial content, streamlined planning and layout.\n\nThe report’s theme was “Making a Statement,” with three sections: Drive, Elevate and Fuel. “Drive” highlighted the year’s accomplishments, told through the experiences of 14 employees, donors and patients. “Elevate” showed how MD Anderson is working to end cancer by expanding it reach. “Fuel” celebrated the donors and supporters with infographics, quotes and photos.\n\nFrom brainstorming to mail drop, production spanned seven months. The execution took a digital-first approach, publishing and distributing key stories, videos and infographics on the center’s Cancerwise blog, in email newsletters, on social media and on its intranet. A digital landing page pulled together the report’s content as the team finalized the print magazine, which was mailed to 20,000 select donors and stakeholders.\n\nThe print and digital versions shared the same visual look to ensure consistent and compelling storytelling and reinforce MD Anderson’s message.\n\nThe 2022 report generated more than 31,000 visits to the online articles, more than 3,600 landing page visits, 116 social media posts and 95 donations totaling $27,130.\n\nCongratulations to MD Anderson for this impactful work.\n\nWalgreens\n\nCorporate Storytelling Team\n\nThe Walgreens Newsroom brings healthcare news to the people\n\nThe Newsroom draws readers to Walgreens’ healthcare platform with a mix of human-centered stories and related reports. It’s a winner for Brand Journalism/Online Newsrooms in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nIn 2021, Walgreens launched its U.S. healthcare platform, featuring locally delivered care and organically developed clinical programs in partnership with leading industry partners. As it’s grown, the Walgreens Newsroom has supported its success with engaging and captivating stories establishing Walgreens as a healthcare brand dedicated to improving the wellbeing of its customers.\n\nA core team of writers works with agency and internal partners to create content that highlights Walgreens’ strategic investments and initiatives within the healthcare industry, sharing stories about its approach toward making healthcare more equitable and showcasing Walgreens’ commitment to the everyday needs of its patients.\n\nFor example, the Newsroom produced a longform article, “Black representation in clinical trials is better for Black people—and frankly everyone” in February 2023 for Black History Month. The piece recapped an internal event with the African American Leadership business resource group and shared statistical data around inequalities in the clinical trials landscape, serving as a piece of thought leadership to underscore how Walgreens’ expertise in localized care can support equitable research.\n\n“Black representation” drew 6,031 users, with 88% of readers new to the Newsroom; the webpage is ranked No. 40 of all landing pages visited in the time period.\n\nThe Newsroom differentiates its content by presenting human-centered stories that illustrate Walgreens’ impact on individual lives. In 2021, Walgreens took a majority investment stake in VillageMD, an urgent care provider, and has rolled out 200 combination Walgreens pharmacy and VillageMD co-locations. The Newsroom supported the partnership with “A helping hand after the hospital,” a long-form article explaining a pilot program to help patients better manage their prescription regimens. “A helping hand” drew 4,545 users, and 91% of readers were new to the Newsroom, with the webpage ranked No. 71.\n\nIn January 2023, the storytelling team published a Health & Wellness Trends report, supported by internal market research and interviews with category managers, highlighted by custom graphics to engage viewers. The report attracted 5,792 users, with 86% of readers new to the Newsroom.\n\nIn addition to all this (and more), Walgreens partners with LinkedIn on an always-on paid campaign strategy for Newsroom content. Examining data from the campaign — launched in February 2023 — the top-performing ads in terms of engagement have been on stories relating to U.S. healthcare.\n\nCongratulations to these teams for their powerful and important work.\n\nSalesforce and Fortune Brand Studio\n\nTHE ECOPRENEURS\n\nEcopreneurs video series spotlights the efforts of entrepreneurs on the frontlines of climate change\n\n‘The Ecopreneurs,’ from SalesForce and Fortune Brand Studio, went in-depth to show how businesses are working for sustainability across the globe. It’s a winner for Branded Content Series (B2B) in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nSustainability is a core value for customer relationship management company Salesforce; entrepreneurship is top of mind for the audience of Fortune Media. That combination became the basis for their partnership on “The Ecopreneurs,” an 11-episode video series that takes a long-form, character-based storytelling approach to showing how businesses are adapting to and solving some of the greatest challenges of the climate crisis.\n\nWith “The Ecopreneurs,” Salesforce and Fortune Brand Studio (FBS) highlighted sustainability-minded entrepreneurs working on innovative business ideas for pushing back on climate change. Salesforce promoted the monthly episodes across social channels, with an emphasis on LinkedIn. FBS created a branded content hub for each episode featuring clips from the show, Q&As, animated explainers and long-form articles. All content on the hub was distributed through dark posts on Fortune’s social channels as well as through native promotion on Fortune.com.\n\nEpisodes take viewers to the frontlines of the crisis with underwater cameras showcasing newly regenerated seascapes (episode one, “SeaTrees”), drones flying over 15,000-foot Andean peaks (episode three, “Acción Andina) and a global movement to restore one trillion trees to the world (episode nine “Plant-for-the-Planet”), capturing some of the rarest and most remote ecosystems on Earth.\n\nThe campaign met or beat all key performance indicators and objectives. The show was No. 1 in average monthly views among Salesforce’s exclusive shows, and led all Salesforce shows in percentage of video viewed, exceeding company benchmarks in view rate, total watch time and average watch time. “SeaTrees,” released on YouTube, garnered more than 3.3 million views.\n\nIt’s been successful in more tangible ways. SeaTrees’ income grew by 80%, and it received its first $1 million donation. Additionally, six months after his episode premiered, Acción Andina founder Tino Aucca was named a Champion of the Earth by the UN. He also spoke and screened the episode at Davos. In all, the Ecopreneurs’ organizations grew in awareness, social media followers, volunteers, employees and/or monetary investments.\n\nCongratulations to these teams for their award-winning achievements!\n\nThe Balvenie Single Malt Scotch Whisky\n\nQuest for Craft\n\nQuestlove creates top-shelf digital series for luxury Scotch whiskey The Balvenie\n\nThe Balvenie Scotch whiskey partnered with Questlove to create ‘Quest for Craft,’ a series designed to raise awareness of the brand. It’s a winner for Branded Content Series (Consumer) in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nFew consumers seemed to be aware of The Balvenie single-malt Scotch whiskey, so the company launched “Quest for Craft,” a digital series designed to drive the brand’s relevance with consumers, making it a brand for discerning drinkers and one that people would pay a little more for.\n\nThe series was created in partnership with musician and musical producer Questlove to explore across two seasons the never-ending journey of taking something from great to exceptional among discerning spirits drinkers. The trailers and full-length episodes for season one launched in October 2021 on the BalvenieUS YouTube page.\n\nAt the same time, trailers and promotional creative were posted across owned social channels — Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Season two launched on YouTube a year later, supported with owned, earned and paid media based on target media consumption.\n\nTrailer and promotional stills posted on host Questlove’s social media accounts had a combined reach of 6.4 million. The series was covered by top news outlets including Forbes, Cool Hunting, Yahoo Entertainment and more.\n\nAcross all platforms, “Quest for Craft” reached more than 43 million unique consumers, amassing more than 27 million views on YouTube and adding more than 2,100 new subscribers to the BalvenieUS channel. For full episodes (approximately 15­­-20 minutes), the video completion rate (VCR) was 8.5%, vs. a vendor benchmark of 1%, delivering on the campaign’s goal of driving emotional engagement with consumers.\n\nA post-campaign brand lift study from Kantar found that the second season of “Quest for Craft” drove statistically significant lift for both the overall audience seeing it and luxury whisky drinkers.\n\nCongratulations to the brilliant minds behind this series!\n\nPfizer & Real Chemistry\n\nPfizer's Science Will Win Podcast - Season 2\n\n‘Science Will Win’ podcast offers hope to cancer sufferers\n\nThe Pfizer podcast tapped medical experts, patients and others to share the experience of diagnosis and treatment. It’s a winner for Branded Podcasts in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nOne in eight women in the U.S. will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of their lifetime, making it a natural focus for the second season of Pfizer’s “Science Will Win” podcast. The podcast shares the most promising medical innovations and explores therapies shaping the future of healthcare and offering new hope to patients around the world.\n\nThe podcast is hosted by geneticist, author and lecturer Adam Rutherford, and is focused on scientists who develop new cancer treatments — specifically for breast cancer — as well as leading clinical trials and treating patients. Patients and patient advocates are also featured. To ensure a clear understanding of the science, Pfizer brought in patients, oncologists, advocates and clinical trial participants to illuminate the human and emotional experience of being diagnosed with and battling cancer.\n\nThe series was promoted through a multichannel campaign to internal and external audiences including healthcare professionals, cancer advocates, patients, researchers and curious podcast listeners. It was amplified across social, digital, out-of-home (OOH) media and newsletters externally, with Pfizer colleagues receiving notices via Yammer, e-signs, email and newsletters.\n\nThe push started with a teaser post on Pfizer’s social channels during Breast Cancer Awareness Month — ahead of the launch — and moved to media tactics across platforms and an “in case you missed it” social post on Pfizer channels. The strategy was to capture attention in places where the audience tends to congregate, areas where it’s surprising for a pharmaceutical company to show up to generate a wide reach of consumption and downloads.\n\nSeason two of “Science Will Win” debuted in the top 1% of podcasts globally. Downloads increased by 44% over the previous season, and the podcast had a nearly 19% social engagement rate combined across channels, thanks to a combination of paid media, a multichannel amplification approach, and research and insights guiding the promotional strategy.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2022, “Science Will Win” appeared in the top 20 on the Apple Podcasts: United States of America: Life Sciences.\n\nCongratulations to the brilliant minds behind this podcast!\n\nMD Anderson Cancer Center\n\nCancerwise Blog\n\nIn a shift, MD Anderson merges all its publications into a single blog — and sees growth\n\nThe cancer center used SEO research to identify topics that readers would respond to. It’s a winner for Corporate Blogs in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nIn Sept. 2020, the MD Anderson Cancer Center consolidated all its publications — a quarterly print magazine, a digital prevention publication and a blog for healthcare professionals — into a single blog: Cancerwise. Cancerwise became a content hub serving prospective and current patients and caregivers, along with the public, healthcare professionals and donors. This called for its writers to focus on producing timely, helpful content.\n\nFor the first two years, Cancerwise prioritized COVID-19 articles, since cancer patients are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. By the summer of 2022, Cancerwise traffic had dropped alongside a similar decline in public interest in COVID-19. It was time to change course.\n\nThe blog would continue to publish patient stories, new research, cancer topics and issues from the MD Anderson online communities. But now it would choose content based on SEO opportunities. Each month, the SEO lead would recommend 6-8 topics, ranging from “When to worry about blood in your stool” to explainers on cancers for which the blog had little content. The SEO lead had previously made optimization recommendations once stories were assigned, but this was a proactive approach, identifying topics for new articles to move the needle in search results.\n\nOnce these topics were assigned, the two-person writing team quickly tracked down and interviewed experts, then wrote and got articles edited by the SEO lead and the editor.\n\nBy winter 2023, the team began seeing results, as search-based stories published in the summer and fall drove growing traffic each month. From Sept. 1, 2022–June 20, 2023, Cancerwise published 193 blog posts and received more than 8 million visits — up 44% year-over-year. Cancerwise also topped 1 million visits May 2023 and nearly did the same in April, something that’s happened only once in the prior three years during a COVID-19 spike.\n\nCongratulations to the minds that brought this work to life.\n\nRevmade\n\nThe Well by Northwell Health, with Revmade\n\nThe Well takes on misinformation in healthcare\n\nNorthwell Health and Revmade created an online publication to provide trustworthy expertise to a wide audience looking for answers. It’s a winner for Editorial Strategy in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nIn the midst of all the misinformation and manipulative messaging going around these days, Northwell Health’s The Well seeks to deliver trustworthy expertise mixed with empathy addressing moments of truth in people’s lives. Working with Revmade, Northwell built a data-informed operating system that taps into doctors’ knowledge for its audience of “chief medical officers of the home,” offering personalized content during life-altering diagnoses, correcting misinformation and guiding them through challenges and the unknown.\n\nThe team behind The Well studies its audience on an ongoing basis, triangulating inputs from third- and first-party data sources and internal intelligence to create in-demand content. They identify emerging topics, including TikTok trends to debunk (or confirm) and locate new channels (including YouTube, TikTok, vertical newsletters and a podcast) to prioritize as the audience’s consumption habits evolve. Content ranges from first-person video walkthroughs of health procedures, new wellness trends and expert-led advice columns.\n\nContent is launched with a hyper-targeted, per-piece distribution plan, focusing on a mix of owned channels to earn attention. When the team sees positive results, they amplify the organic performance with paid efforts. Feedback and performance are monitored to optimize existing campaigns and inform content planning. The team evaluates inbound channels and conversion rates to other pages on northwell.edu, copying and tweaking the content to improve those rates over time.\n\nAll this generated significant results over the past year, including:\n\nThe Well surpassed 4 million content engagements across properties and channels for the first time.\n\nReferrals from articles on The Well generated 17,000 visits to northwell.edu, making the publication more cost efficient compared to other marketing activities.\n\nThe Well’s average CPC (cost per click) is 19 cents — more than five times better than published benchmarks.\n\nWell articles drove a 48% year-over-year increase in new subscribers to The Well’s newsletters. These subscribers remain very engaged with Well content, with a 55% open rate on Well editorial newsletters as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFinally, In the month following its TikTok launch, videos from The Well received more than 3.7 million views, with the account generating nearly 30,000 followers.\n\nCongratulations to The Well for this important and impactful work.\n\nIEEE Awards\n\nIEEE Vision, Innovations, and Challenge Summit & Honor Ceremony\n\nIEEE’s event is the leading summit of excellence in engineering, technology, science and more\n\nThe organization rolled out all the stops to gain visibility for its prestigious honors ceremony, winning for Events/Live or Virtual in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE) Vision, Innovation and Challenges Summit and Honors Ceremony is probably the largest engineering and technology event most people have never heard of. Although many of the technologies showcased during the event are fixtures of daily life (for example, the internet), people outside of IEEE’s typical business and industry audience are often unfamiliar with the individuals who developed them.\n\nFor 2023, IEEE took a “rolling thunder” approach to publicizing the event with a continuous stream of content to drive event visibility, increase awareness and elevate the IEEE brand among a broader audience.

The video of his story is a winner for Interview or Profile in PR Daily’s Content Marketing Awards.\n\nIn June 2022, 62-year-old triathlete Steve Bruemmer was swimming off California’s Monterey Peninsula when he was attacked by a shark, suffering serious injuries to his legs and body. A brave trio on the beach rescued Bruemmer, who was bleeding heavily, and he was taken to Natividad Medical Center, arriving less than an hour after the shark attack. The trauma team controlled Bruemmer’s bleeding and gave him 28 units of blood. (The average adult body holds 10 units of blood.)\n\nThe story attracted intense media attention, and Natividad’s director of marketing, Hillary Fish, along with the hospital’s public relations firm AMF Media Group, were called upon to help manage the response while protecting Bruemmer’s wellbeing and privacy. The day after the incident, when Bruemmer was stable, the trauma team and Fish met with him and his wife to find out if they wished to respond to media requests or publish a statement.\n\nThe meeting turned into an impromptu interview, which was used to craft a written statement about Bruemmer’s story of survival just 24 hours later. But Bruemmer remained in the hospital for three weeks, and media interest remained steady.\n\nThe day Bruemmer was discharged, Natividad filmed and edited a four-minute interview video telling his story. In the video, Bruemmer thanks the good Samaritans on the beach, the emergency medical technicians, the Natividad Trauma Center and blood donors. “I was in a tough spot,” he says in the video. “And everyone was so caring. I’m going home now. I’m going to recover. I’m going to be OK. Thanks to you all.”\n\nThe video was released to local and national media outlets and also posted to YouTube, generating further coverage. More than 350 local, national and international news outlets covered Bruemmer’s story, with a total readership exceeding 4 billion. Stories appeared on The Today Show and Good Morning America, as well as in the LA Times, the New York Post, and the San Francisco Chronicle.
