Lee,\n\nVolkamer group,\n\nANYL Dissertation Defense\n\n\"Although ozone is a ground-level pollutant, ozone in the stratosphere absorbs solar radiation and therefore reduces the amount of harmful ultraviolet light reaching the Earth’s surface. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin and global environmental hazard which enters the ecosystem following oxidation and subsequent deposition from the atmosphere. While ozone chemistry is relatively well-understood, atmospheric mercury chemistry is highly uncertain.\n\nThe chemistry of atmospheric halogens and their impact on ozone and mercury oxidation are investigated using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements of trace gases in conjunction with other measurements at mountaintop observatories on remote islands in the northern and southern hemisphere tropics (5 years of observations), and over the central continental United States (1.5 years of observations). Total ozone (O3) and stratospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical columns are presented for the entire measurement period at all three sites. Other trace gases, including iodine monoxide (IO), bromine monoxide (BrO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and water vapor (H2O) are presented for case study periods.\n\nThe first ground-based observations of IO radicals in the continental troposphere are presented, alongside co-located measurements of gas-phase elemental and oxidized mercury. The observed levels of tropospheric IO were up to three times higher than predicted by the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model. Furthermore, the observed levels of oxidized mercury were up to ten times higher than predicted by the same model, which considers only bromine and hydroxyl radicals as major mercury oxidants. The role of iodine as a mercury oxidant was evaluated using a chemical box model of gas-phase mercury chemistry which included iodine, bromine, and hydroxyl radicals as mercury oxidants.\n\nObservations of the 2023 Hunga Tonga volcanic plume in the stratosphere over the southern hemisphere site are presented. The eruption injected an enormous amount of water vapor into the stratosphere, increasing the total amount of stratospheric water vapor by 10% and resulting in a 5% reduction of ozone in the tropical stratosphere. A suite of ground-based, balloon-borne, and satellite observations revealed that the stratospheric ozone depletion was likely due to chlorine reservoir species being efficiently converted into reactive chlorine radical species as a result of the water vapor injection. Zenith-sky DOAS measurements of stratospheric NO2 and BrO constrained the role of NOx and BrOx in the observed ozone depletion.\"\n\n22 April 2024\n\nA partial story of an aircraft-based laminar gas sampling inlet\n\nDa Yang,\n\nVolkamer group\n\n\"Aircraft-based measurements allow for large spatial-scale characterization of atmospheric aerosol and gas, but these measurements, under high-speed flow conditions, complicate efforts to maintain sample integrity through the inlet transport process. Of particular concern is the role of turbulence in driving loss of gas-phase species and aerosol particles. While a significant amount of research has gone into understanding aerosol sampling efficiency for aircraft inlets, a similar research investment has not been made for gas sampling. To study the gas sampling loss of aircraft-based measurements, we used computational simulations and wind tunnel experiments to analyze the gas sampling performance of a laminar gas inlet developed and used in the Ti3GER project. We conducted measurements of H2SO4 in a high-speed wind tunnel. The gas transmission efficiency of H2SO4 through different sampling lines was measured using CIMS, and the experimental results are being compared to simulations of flow and mass diffusion modelling in the sampling line. Both experimental data and simulation results show the gas transmission efficiency increases with an increased sampling flow rate, including turbulent flow. In this presentation, I would like to give a short introduction to my work on studying aircraft-based sampling systems and focus on sharing the information I learned from gas-phase H2SO4 measurement results.\"\n\nand\n\nCharacterisation of Br-CIMS response under different humidity level and its application in CLOUD 16\n\nYandong Tong,\n\nVolkamer group\n\n\"Chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS) exhibits high sensitivity and versatility in gaseous species, therefore, it has been widely used in atmospheric chemistry studies, especially in new particle formation and secondary organic aerosol formation studies. Among the different ionisation methods, CIMS using bromide (Br-) as reagent ion has been recently developed, optimised, and characterised, which is suitable to detect various organic and inorganic species, e.g., iodine and its oxidation products. However, Br-CIMS shows humidity dependence in many studies. In this study, we developed a new water regulation system for our CIMS and implemented it in laboratory experiments and in the CLOUD 16 campaign at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. By taking advantage of the water regulation system and CLOUD chamber facility, we explored the Br- CIMS sensitivity to different species in a wide range of humidity levels. For strongly bonded species, e.g., iodine (I2), Br-CIMS sensitivity to these species increases as the humidity level increases, whereas Br-CIMS sensitivity to weakly bonded species, e.g., glyoxal (CHOCHO), exhibits the opposite trend. A decent understanding of Br-CIMS response to different species under various humidity conditions allows us to provide valuable measurements in CLOUD 16, especially helping us understand the role of CHOCHO in nucleation events.\"\n\n15 April 2024\n\nLaboratory and mechanistic studies of complex VOC oxidation systems\n\nDr. Qing Ye,\n\nNCAR Atmospheric Chemistry Observations & Modeling Lab\n\n\"Improving our knowledge of the atmospheric oxidation chemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is crucial to our understanding of how air pollutants form and evolve. One major challenge in the understanding of VOC oxidation arises from the extreme complexity in the oxidation processes which convert the precursor to new oxidized products and exponentially increase the number and diversity of species in the reaction mixture. To study the complex oxidation processes, laboratory chamber experiments and mechanistic simulations are two commonly used tools that have different advantages and limitations. In this seminar, I will compare a chamber dataset on alpha-pinene oxidation with a mechanistic dataset generated by a hyper-explicit mechanism generator, GECKO-A. The measurement dataset was collected by a suite of advanced analytical instruments, with the goal of achieving a near-complete description of the reactive carbon. The measurement-mechanism comparisons on a species-to-species level and an ensemble property level will be discussed. I will then show how targeted adjustments to the mechanisms in GECKO-A affect its overall agreement with chamber observations.\"\n\n5 April 2024\n\nNew observations and models of ozone photochemistry in wildfire and urban plumes\n\nMichael Robinson,\n\nBrown Group,\n\nANYL Dissertation Defense\n\n\"Atmospheric reactions of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds significantly impact the composition of the troposphere in the form of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosol. Despite decades of research and precursor regulation, O3 pollution in the United States continues to be a problem in urban areas. Increasing wildfire occurrence and intensity in the western United States raises the question of wildfires' impact on this air quality issue. Critical questions regarding this topic include: 1) which photochemical regime does O3 production occur in western wildfires, 2) how do O3 photochemical regimes compare across four major cities in North America, 3) does changing O3 photochemical regimes in North America necessitate new approaches to quantifying chemical regimes. In this defense, I address these questions with 1) aircraft observations and modeling of western wildfires to describe and quantify the photochemical regime and 2) an analysis of isoprene peroxy radical fate in four urban areas from aircraft and ground site observations.\"\n\n2 April 2024\n\nOxidation of Monoterpenes in the Atmosphere and Indoor Environments\n\nOlivia Jenks,\n\nde Gouw group,\n\nANYL Dissertation Defense\n\n\"Monoterpenes are emitted into the atmosphere from vegetation and indoor products like personal care items and building materials. Once in the atmosphere, monoterpenes undergo oxidation by ozone (O3), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and nitrate radicals (NO3), forming secondary organic aerosol (SOA). These aerosols play crucial roles in the climate system, in limiting visibility, and impact human health. Aerosols reflect sunlight, contributing to a cooling of climate, and influence cloud properties. However, their small particle size enables them to penetrate deep into the lungs of humans, posing risks to cardiovascular and respiratory health. My first project involved characterizing the gas-phase products of monoterpene oxidation, focusing on Δ-3-carene, α-pinene, β-pinene, ocimene, and limonene. Innovative techniques were developed to identify and quantify these products, including the use of tubing delay experiments with the Vocus mass spectrometer. Field studies in Los Angeles corroborated findings from the lab, highlighting the importance of both daytime and nighttime chemistry. The composition of the monoterpene oxidation products observed in the field were compared to that of the lab studies, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of atmospheric VOC oxidation processes. My second project investigated the impact of germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) irradiation on indoor VOC oxidation. GUV has been widely used for air disinfection, particularly in public settings like hospitals and schools. However, its effect on indoor air quality remains poorly understood. By irradiating air that contains common indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs), like limonene, in a controlled chamber, the impact of GUV light on the monoterpene ozonolysis process was studied. This work contributes to a better understanding of the implications of GUV disinfection on indoor air quality and human health and will inform strategies for improving indoor air quality and reducing health risks associated with VOC exposure in indoor environments.\"\n\n1 April 2024\n\nInvestigating SOA Formation from Volatile Methyl Siloxanes\n\nHanalei Lewine,\n\nANYL 3rd year, Browne group\n\n\"Volatile methyl siloxanes (VMS) are anthropogenic organosilicon molecules that are used in a variety of applications including in personal care products. Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) has been detected at high mixing ratios indoors and outdoors, with 90% of the D5 in cosmetics being released to the atmosphere. VMS have recently been identified as precursors to aerosol in urban areas, however lab studies of D5 oxidation have been unable to fully characterize D5’s SOA yield. The dominant oxidation product, the siloxanol, has been observed in lab and ambient aerosol, however absorptive partitioning alone cannot explain the amounts measured. Previous SOA experiments did not control for seed and wall effects, and did not measure gas phase chemistry leading to SOA. Here, we performed chamber experiments to investigate how the presence of seed aerosols impacts D5 SOA formation, if multigenerational chemistry is required for D5 SOA, and how RO2 fate impacts D5 SOA. We measured the gas phase products of D5 oxidation using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) and measured particle size distribution using SMPS. We find that at lower OH exposures, with only one generation of oxidation chemistry, we still make SOA. Despite challenges in data analysis, it is clear that seed aerosol is important for D5 SOA formation.\"\n\n18 March 2024\n\nComparison of Common Vapor Pressure Estimation Methods through Modeling of the Reactions of Linear and Branched Alkenes with OH/NOx\n\nEmmaline Longnecker,\n\nANYL 3rd year, Ziemann group\n\n\"Modeling atmospheric reactions that lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is an important tool for understanding the current and future impacts of human activity on the environment. Vapor pressure is a key parameter in modeling these reactions, as it largely determines the gas-particle partitioning of atmospheric oxidation products. However, the vapor pressures of many atmospherically relevant molecules are still poorly constrained. To aid modeling efforts, several structure-activity relationships (SARs) based on group contribution methods have been developed for estimating compound vapor pressures. The current study evaluates how four of these SARs: SIMPOL, EVAPORATION, SPARC, and Nannoolal, impact the modeled predictions of SOA yields for reactions of C8-C14 1-alkenes and C9-C15 2-methyl-1-alkenes with OH radicals in the presence of NOx. The models include well-constrained, quantitative reaction mechanisms developed by our research group from several previous environmental chamber studies of product yields, gas-particle and gas-wall partitioning, and secondary reactions with OH radicals. Based on our previous studies, there was no need to account for particle-phase oligomer formation. Comparison of modeled and measured SOA yields provided insight into the major products responsible for SOA formation over the large range of carbon numbers, and the sources of discrepancies between model predictions and measurements. The wide range of agreement exemplifies the impact of vapor pressure in modeling atmospheric reactions and indicates the need for further development of estimation methods.\"\n\n11 March 2024\n\nCareer panel with ANYL alumni:\n\nWe have asked the speakers to present for 12-15 min on their perspective on careers outside academia for PhD chemists, and in particular for graduates of our ANYL PhD program. For example, they may address the following questions: what path took you to where you are? What strengths from the ANYL program helped you in your career? What could have the program done to make that better? What do you wish someone had told you when you were a PhD student? What advice would you give to current PhD students and postdocs? A Q&A session will follow, prioritizing questions from current students and postdocs.\n\nIngrid Ulbrich,\n\nAchieving Academic Success\n\n\"Ingrid Ulbrich (Ph.D., Jimenez Group, 2011) discovered in grad school that teaching was a much greater passion than research. And that she needed the Ph.D. for teaching jobs in higher ed. So she pushed through to complete her research (applying PMF to tropospheric organic aerosol; H-index = 26 as of 2020) and began helping students get better at problem solving. After teaching CU (Gen Chem to grad-level data analysis), she became the General Chemistry Lecture Coordinator at Colorado State University. While teaching first-year courses she saw the true struggles of students – not underdeveloped math skills or challenges dissecting word problems – but lacking a life vision, believing the voice that says they’re not smart enough, and inability to manage major life events while prioritizing academics. After encountering a curriculum that helps students learn 'how' to learn and become self-growers, Ingrid discovered how to empower students to overcome those struggles. Ingrid founded a nonprofit in 2021, Achieving Academic Success, to develop students as master learners who pursue their life visions on a path of continued growth and create the lives they want to live.\"\n\n&\n\nErin McDuffie,\n\nUS EPA\n\n\"Dr. Erin McDuffie is a physical scientist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Erin received her PhD from the Analytical, Environmental, and Atmospheric Chemistry program at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2018. During her PhD, Erin worked with Dr. Steve Brown in NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Laboratory, where she focused on in situ sampling and simple chemical box modeling to better understand the sources and chemical transformations of ozone and fine particulate matter. After graduate school, Erin transitioned to using global atmospheric chemistry transport models to study air pollution impacts on human health as a post-doctoral research fellow at Dalhousie University with Dr. Randall Martin (now at Washington University in St. Louis). Erin completed a 2020-2022 AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellowship at the U.S. EPA in Washington, D.C., and is currently an atmospheric scientist in EPA’s Climate Change Division, working on a wide range of science and policy questions related to better understanding, communicating, and mitigating future risks of climate change. \"\n\n4 March 2024\n\nFrom the air to the sea: Addressing environmental challenges through fundamental chemistry\n\nDr. Ryan Davis,\n\nSandia National Laboratories,\n\nUniversity of New Mexico\n\n\"Environmental systems, such as the hydrosphere and atmosphere, are a complex balance of chemical and physical processes that impact nearly every facet of life. In the atmosphere, aerosol particles – tiny particles of liquid and/or solid floating in the air -- have a strong influence on air quality, climate, and human health. For example, the aerosol effect on climate is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate models. Human respiratory aerosol can also transmit certain diseases. Understanding aerosol particles is a unique challenge because they can exhibit chemical and physical properties that are not observed in bulk solution. In the first part of this talk, I will discuss efforts to understand and characterize the unique properties of aerosol particles using levitation-based techniques to understand aerosol phase state. With this approach we have demonstrated unique supramolecular effects on the phase state of aqueous aerosol particles composed of organic and inorganic compounds. The environmental and public health implications for droplet-based supramolecular chemistry will be discussed. In the second part of the talk, we will turn discussion to the hydrosphere, where anthropogenic activities have contaminated global water sources with environmentally-persistent chemical species. One such class of “forever chemicals” are per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are highly resistant to natural degradation processes. PFAS are used widely in a range of consumer and industrial products and their widespread use has led to a global distribution. Certain PFAS have been linked to a myriad of environmental and human health problems, so there is a need to remove these compounds from water supplies. Here, I will discuss ongoing efforts to destroy, sequester, and detect PFAS. Along the way, I will highlight other areas of my ongoing research at Sandia National Labs, including gas- surface interactions on metal surfaces, machine-learning based climate models, and the development of analytical chemistry capabilities.\"\n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE- NA0003525. This talk describes objective technical results and analysis. Any subjective views or opinions that might be expressed in the talk do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Department of Energy or the United States Government.\n\n28 February 2024\n\nAtmospheric Aerosols: Quantification and Method Development\n\nMelinda Schueneman,\n\nJimenez Group,\n\nCU ANYL Dissertation Defense\n\n\"The composition of atmospheric aerosols is influenced by the source/atmospheric conditions (e.g. rural, polluted, and/or biomass burning) as well as gas (g)↔particle (p) partitioning in an air mass. Several analytical techniques can be used to measure aerosol chemical composition, including Extractive Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometers (EESI, molecular ions of components of aerosols) and Aerosol Mass Spectrometers (AMS, typically bulk aerosol composition). Here, two methods for understanding aerosols generated in laboratory experiments are introduced. The first method focuses on a procedure that allows for calibration of molecular species. The second involves the quantification of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and g↔p partitioning for known Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) precursors.\n\nIn part I, a new calibration technique is designed and tested, which combines High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), aerosolization, SMPS, and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to calibrate the EESI and AMS. Species in complex aerosol mixtures (like SOA) can be separated and calibrated for, in the absence of reference standards.\n\nIn part II, the SOA formation potential from the oxidation by OH of different biomass burning VOC precursors was quantified. An iterative solver within a kinetic model was developed, including the effect of vapor wall loss (VWL) in atmospheric chambers. This allowed constraining g↔w↔p partitioning for the reaction products of each VOC. I compared the volatility of SOA to that of primary OA (POA) in a simulated wildfire and found that POA appears to be less volatile, thus more likely to be retained in the particle phase as wildfire smoke ages.\n\nThe results of this work will help to better understand and model aging biomass burning emissions and provide new methods for online aerosol chemical composition measurements.\"\n\n26 February 2024\n\nEfficiency of Urban Ozone Photochemistry during the 2023 AEROMMA and CUPiDS Airborne Field Campaigns\n\nWyndom Chase,\n\nCU ANYL 3rd year, Brown group\n\n\"The summer 2023 Airborne Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) and Coastal Urban Plume Dynamics (CUPiDS) field campaigns provided extensive in-situ observations of ozone (O­­­­­­3) and its precursors in the largest United States urban areas (New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles). We present the distribution of O­­­­­­3 in these megacities, along with the distribution of its precursor nitrogen oxides (NO­­­x = NO + NO2) and total reactive nitrogen (NO­­­y), as measured from the NASA DC-8 and NOAA Twin Otter aircraft platforms during AEROMMA and CUPiDS, respectively. Several metrics calculated from in-situ trace gas measurements can aid the understanding of the photochemical regimes in which O­­­3 production takes place. The O­­­­­­3 production efficiency (OPE) is a measure of the amount of O­­­3 produced per unit NO­­­­x that is emitted and oxidized and is often taken as the ratio of enhanced O­­­3 or O­­­x (= O­­­3 + NO2) to NO­­­z (= NO­­­z - NOx) within an urban plume transect. The spatial and temporal variability of OPE probes the evolution of O­­­­­­3 sensitivity within a given urban area. Comparison of this metric between urban areas, in this case New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, elucidates differences or similarities across major U.S. urban areas. This analysis establishes a foundation for future work that will incorporate additional O­­­­­­3 sensitivity metrics, as well as chemical box modeling and remote sensing observations, to gain greater insight into the current landscape of U.S. O­­­3 photochemical pollution.\"\n\n19 February 2024\n\nObserving Wildfire Emissions and Improving Air Quality Forecasting Using Remote Sensing Data\n\nLindsey Anderson,\n\nCU ANYL 3rd year, de Gouw group\n\n\"Human-caused climate change and the buildup of fuel from fire suppression practices has led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires in the western United States. Wildfire emissions of particulate matter and reactive gases impact human health, affect local and downwind ozone (O3) formation, and influence the climate. The magnitude and chemical composition of wildfire emissions in operational air quality forecasts depend on the vegetation type and the burned area. However, laboratory and field measurements have shown that the composition of wildfire emissions also depends on whether the wildfire is experiencing mainly flaming combustion or mainly smoldering combustion, which changes throughout its lifetime. Including a parametrization of how the composition of wildfire emissions changes with evolving combustion conditions could improve air quality forecasts, especially for pollutants such as O3. Here, we will show how remote sensing observations of trace gases from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) can be used to observe changes in the composition of wildfire emissions over time, as wildfires transitions from mainly flaming to mainly smoldering combustion. We will also discuss how the Hourly Wildfire Potential (HWP) index, which is derived from NOAA’s High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model predictions of wind speed, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, relates to trace gas composition from TROPOMI and can be used to parametrize how NOx emissions vary with forecasted changes in combustion conditions. Using this technique, we have found improvements in forecasted NOx and O3 during the FIREX-AQ field study. These are the first experimental simulations in which the chemical composition of wildfire emissions varies online in a high-resolution (3km x 3km) convection-allowing air quality forecast. Looking forward, we also plan to use HWP in order to parametrize the vertical distribution of emissions, because this is also dependent on the dominant combustion type.\"\n\n12 February 2024\n\nMaking Air Quality Count: Low-cost Sensors. Public Health and Urban Planning\n\nProf. Priyanka deSouza,\n\nUrban and Regional Planning Department,\n\nCU-Denver\n\n\"Air pollution is responsible for ~ 7 million premature deaths every year. 90% of these deaths occurred in the Global South. How can countries in the Global South improve air quality? This talk takes a multipronged approach to answer this question. First: air pollution data is critical for the development of effective air quality management plans. Few cities in the Global South have extensive regulatory air pollution monitor networks, and when they do, the data are often not publicly available. This talk proposes novel methodologies to leverage data from low-cost sensors and satellite data to fill in the air pollution data gaps. However, air pollution data is only one piece of the puzzle. To convince policy-makers of the urgency of tackling air pollution this talk also evaluates the health impact of air pollution in the Indian and African contexts. Finally, how does data ultimately lead to action? This talk ends by describing what actions air quality measurements have led to in Kenya, and what existing barriers to effective policy actions are.\"\n\nFall 2023\n\n4 December 2023\n\nOzone in wildfire smoke and its influence on regional and global ozone\n\nSteven S. Brown\n\nTropospheric Chemistry and Atmospheric Remote Sensing Program Lead,\n\nNOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory, Boulder, CO\n\nAdjoint Professor of Chemistry,\n\nUniversity of Colorado, Boulder, CO\n\nThe frequency, burned area and emissions from wildfires have been increasing in North America for the last four decades. Biomass burning is a known sources of ozone precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Increasing wildfire emissions have influenced trends in North American urban ozone. The pyrogenic influence on ozone occurs either through ozone production within smoke plumes that is then transported to urban regions, or through the mixing of pyrogenic VOCs with urban NOx to enhance local and regional ozone production. This presentation will use data from recent airborne and ground-based field campaigns to quantify these processes. The 2016-2017 Atmospheric Tomography mission (ATom) assessed the influence of biomass burning at hemispheric and global scales. The 2019 Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) sampled wildfire smoke across the U.S. with multiple research aircraft. The 2022 California Fire Dynamics Experiment (CalFiDE) conducted focused in-situ and remote sensing measurements in California and Oregon. Ground-based measurements in Boulder, Colorado intercepted periods of smoke influence in the Northern Front Range urban area in 2020 and 2021. Finally, the 2023 Atmospheric Emissions and Reactivity Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) campaign on the NASA DC-8 and the Coastal Urban Plume Dynamics Study (CUPiDS) on the NOAA Twin Otter observed long range smoke transported to U.S. urban areas and the associated impacts on ozone.\n\nand\n\nThe Physical and Electrochemical Studies of Perylene Diimide Compounds\n\nJim Hall,\n\nCU 1st Year\n\nSolar photovoltaics are an important part of the worlds climate change mitigation strategies; however, the solar cells being use commercially only perform at 10-15% efficiency. Improving these cells to reduce the energy lost to thermalization can be an important step in increasing the efficiency of these cells. Perylene diimides (PDIs), a class of organic industrial dyes, have shown great promise in their ability to harness this energy loss through a process called singlet fission. This talk looks into the transient absorption measurements of some of these PDI compounds and shows their ability to downconvert this energy to be better used by a solar cell. In addition, we will explore the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of these compounds; despite several rounds of troubleshooting and problem solving, the set up being used did not show any significant oxidation or reduction events within the voltages being scanned. This is likely due to reactions with oxygen during the CV process, despite best efforts to remove it.\n\n27 November 2023\n\nIndoor Air Quality in Western Canada During Wildfire Episodes\n\nRebecca Mesburis,\n\nCU ANYL 1st year\n\nThe increased frequency, duration, and intensity of wildfires has raised public awareness of the impact of wildfire smoke on air quality and human health. The 2023 wildfire season in Canada broke the record for the most area burned in North America’s history at about 18.5 million hectares. The main threat to public health from wildfire smoke is particulate matter, with particulate matter that have a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5) contributing to most of the total particulate mass and travelling significant distances from the source of the fire. Recently, low-cost air quality sensors have been used in air quality studies due to their ability to capture high-resolution spatiotemporal data. We used the publicly available low- cost PurpleAir sensor network to gather indoor and outdoor PM2.5 data in Kamloops, Canada from January to December 2021 with the goal to assess the level of exposure to wildfire PM2.5 relative to other sources of PM2.5. Given that we obtain most of our particulate inhalation exposure when indoors, changes to the indoor environment during wildfire episodes were emphasized. On wildfire-influenced days, wildfire PM2.5 dominated the indoor exposure sources and indoor PM2.5 was almost always less than outdoor PM2.5. On non-wildfire- influenced days, no typical relationship was established between indoor and outdoor PM2.5. The analysis was limited by the number of PurpleAir sensors and knowledge of the indoor environments studied. The findings indicate that remaining indoors during wildfire events is currently an effective but finite strategy to limit PM2.5 exposure in Kamloops.\n\nand\n\nExploring Alcohol Adsorption to Gold Induced by Applied Potential\n\nDrew Blauth,\n\nCU ANYL 1st year\n\nSelf-assembled monolayers (SAMs) play vital roles in battery development, biosensor function, and drug delivery. Extensive research has been directed towards adsorbate and substrate pairs that spontaneously form SAMs, such as thiols and gold, leaving pairs that do not spontaneously form SAMs relatively understudied. This project investigated alcohol adsorption to gold, which has been ignored by researchers due to oxygen - gold bond being relatively weak. By applying potential to gold substrates immersed in alcohol solutions and observing alcohol adsorption to gold using Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), it was determined that alcohol adsorption to gold could be induced and interrupted repeatedly by cycling between positive and negative applied voltages. While it is unclear exactly how the alcohols interact with the gold, these results suggest that applied potential could be used to create alcohol and gold SAMs, greatly broadening the applications SAMs could be used for.\n\n13 November 2023\n\nImpact of Cleaning on Concentrations of Volatile and Semivolatile Organic Compounds in A Normally-Occupied Residence\n\nNathan Sweet,\n\nCU ANYL 1st year\n\nThe use of cleaning products alters the chemical composition of indoor air. Utilizing data from detailed observational monitoring conducted over multiple months, we explore the influence of cleaning activities in a normally occupied single-family house. To study emissions and chemistry, we quantified more than 200 VOCs using a proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer and 52 SVOCs using semivolatile thermal-desorption gas chromatography. During regular professional home cleaning, we observed concentration enhancements in ~60% of observed VOCs and ~80% of reported SVOCs. Most of these concentration enhancements were not clearly linked to either primary emission from cleaning products or secondary formation through reactive chemistry. Instead, shifts in the sorptive properties of indoor surfaces may account for these observations. Individual concentrations of four chlorinated compounds, including dichloramine, increased by up to 0.8 ppb during bleach cleaning. Most cleaning-associated compounds returned to pre-event concentrations within a few hours, with some VOCs and lower volatility SVOCs persisting more than 5 hours, longer than would be expected for removal by ventilation alone. Concentrations of ultrafine particles also increased during professional cleaning, likely from nucleation events associated with bleach cleaning. Use of carpet cleaner was associated with emission of hexanediol, which persisted at elevated concentrations for days after the initial event. We infer that surface sorption dynamics influence the composition of indoor air after cleaning a home. Cleaning events can affect indoor air quality long after the cleaning is completed.\n\nand\n\nUsing Caulobacter crescentus as a Model to Probe the Reactivity of Silver Nanoparticles\n\nMaddie Farber,\n\nCU ANYL 1st year\n\nSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are an increasingly common environmental pollutant with antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. The elucidation of their interaction with cellular membranes and subsequent mechanisms of toxicity are critical areas of research that need to be better understood in order to manage potential adverse environmental effects. This work investigates the interaction of AgNPs with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) as a model membrane system. Similar studies conducted by others in this field have largely been conducted with uncoated AgNPs, ignoring the effect of environmental conditions on the formation of an eco-corona on AgNPs. Thus, in this study, the spent medium (SM) of a relevant environmental bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, was used to form a complex eco-corona. We hypothesized that the eco-corona would mediate the in vivo reactivity of AgNPs, specifically through distinct interactions at the cell membrane. The differential reactivity of AgNPs and SM-AgNPs is shown through an in vivo toxicity study using C. crescentus. Model membranes were analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS), in which AgNP and LUV size and charge are characterized, and fluorescence anisotropy, where changes to LUV membrane fluidity and dynamics are interrogated. Results of the in vivo study are presented in tandem with model membrane studies in order to correlate toxicity effects seen in vivo with potential mechanisms of reactivity at the cell membrane.\n\n6 November 2023\n\nExplorations into the Composition of Brake Wear Particles from Semi-Metallic and Ceramic Brake Pads\n\nMaxwell Lee,\n\nCU ANYL 1st year\n\nVehicle based air pollution has always been a major contributor to air pollution from combustion-based exhaust particulate matter and emissions. As vehicle trends shift away from combustion-based drive trains, other sources of vehicle-based pollutants will become the main source of vehicle air pollution. Particularly, particulate matter is of great concern to study because it is known that brake pad wear can be a source of these hazardous particles. While a general idea of elemental composition is known for brake pad particles, the chemical composition of organic particles emitted from braking events is largely unknown. Additionally, there is no general consensus on whether brake pads marketed as “ceramic” and “semi-metallic” differ in elemental composition. These unknowns create multiple issues when attempting to find the concentration of brake pad pollution in the air near areas of high traffic. We found that the elemental composition of “ceramic” and “semi-metallic” brake pads does differ and are linked by the presence of common elements like Iron, Magnesium, and Barium, making these elements potential ways to track brake pollution. Additionally, we discovered that organic particles from brake pads form from unique tribological processes, and that using H/C and O/C ratios may be a possible method for tracking organic brake pad pollution. These results can be used to inform possible field studies near high traffic areas to determine how concentrated brake pollution is in those areas. Ideally, these tracers can be used to find trends in brake pad pollution in the context of environmental justice and show whether there are trends between brake pad pollution concentrations and the health of low-income communities.\n\nand\n\nComparative Analysis of AVIRIS and WorldView-3 SWIR for Geologic Mapping in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park\n\nJeffrey Price,\n\nCU ANYL 1st year\n\nA geologic map is both a visual depiction of the lithologies and structures occurring at the Earth’s surface and a representation of a conceptual model for the geologic history in a region. The work needed to capture such multifaceted information in an accurate geologic map is time consuming. Remote sensing can complement traditional primary field observations, geochemistry, chronometry, and subsurface geophysical data in providing useful information to assist with the geologic mapping process. Two novel sources of remote sensing data are particularly relevant for geologic mapping applications: decameter-resolution imaging spectroscopy (spectroscopic imaging) and meter-resolution multispectral shortwave infrared (SWIR) imaging. Decameter spectroscopic imagery can capture important mineral absorptions but is frequently unable to spatially resolve important geologic features. Meter-resolution multispectral SWIR images are better able to resolve fine spatial features but offer reduced spectral information. Such disparate but complementary datasets can be challenging to integrate into the geologic mapping process. Here, we conduct a comparative analysis of spatial and spectral scaling for two such datasets: one Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer—Classic (AVIRIS-classic) flightline, and one WorldView-3 (WV3) scene, for a geologically complex landscape in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, California. In this talk, I will discuss the physically based portion of our approach: the spectral mixture residual. The mixture residual uses the wavelength-explicit misfit of a linear spectral mixture model to capture low variance spectral signals. For this study area, the spectral mixture residual revealed greater spectral dimensionality in AVIRIS than WorldView (99% of variance in 39 versus 5 residual dimensions). These results illustrate the potential of recent and planned imaging spectroscopy missions to complement high-resolution multispectral imagery—along with field and lab observations—in planning, collecting, and interpreting the results from geologic field work.\n\n30 October 2023\n\nDrivers of Biogenic Reactive Nitrogen Oxide Emissions in Southern Indiana Deciduous Forests\n\nClara Lietzke,\n\nCU ANYL 1st year\n\nIn the troposphere, reactive nitrogen oxides (NOy = NO, NO2, HONO) are harmful pollutants. Conversion of NO to NO2 propagates the radical reactions that oxidize volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and generate hydroxyl radical (OH). NO2 is directly photolyzed to produce ozone (O3), a harmful air pollutant and main component of smog. Anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide (NOx = NO + NO2) have declined with the enactment of air pollution control policy, increasing the importance of biogenic NOy emissions. Previous work characterizing sources and sinks of NOy has been focused on soil microbial emissions, although emissions of NOx from plant matter have also been directly observed. To determine the short-term impact of leaf senescence on local NOy levels, we conducted the Fall Forest Exchange of Reactive Nitrogen (FFERN) field campaign, where we observed substantial NO emissions from American Sycamore leaf litter, particularly under specific stressors like dew and freezing events. Here, we investigate the mechanism of NOy emissions from American Sycamore and other tree species leaves in addition to their response to different stressors, such as drying, rehydration, freezing, and cutting.\n\nand\n\nBase-mediated depolymerization of amine-cured epoxy resins\n\nKatherine Stevenson,\n\nCU ANYL 1st year\n\nCarbon fiber-reinforced epoxy composites are used in multiple industries, including for aerospace, automotive, and wind energy applications, due to their excellent strength-to-weight ratios and tunable material properties. Fortunately, recycling strategies for carbon fiber-based composites are emerging, with the primary focus on recovery of fibers due to the cost and energy intensity in their production. In addition to fiber recovery, there is an opportunity to recycle the epoxy components, such that ideal recycling strategies would yield both post-consumer fibers and epoxy monomers for reuse. Here, we examine potassium tert-butoxide-mediated cleavage of C–O and C–N bonds in amine-cured epoxy resins. We accomplish this via developing model compounds that reflect both C–O and C–N linkages in amine-cured epoxy composites, before expanding to both model linear thermoplastics and thermosets. We obtain excellent yields of both phenol (up to 97% molar yield) and amine products (up to 99 mol%) from aromatic and/or aliphatic amine-based model compounds. This system enables up to quantitative yield of bisphenol-A and up to 58% molar yield of aniline from model thermoplastic epoxy amines and 71% molar yield of BPA from a reaction with a thermoset substrate. These data correspond to 15% mass recovery of BPA from a commercial epoxy thermoset.\n\n23 October 2023\n\nImpact of Sulfur on Planetary Haze: Implications for Habitability\n\nEleanor Browne\n\nCU ANYL Faculty\n\nAtmospheric composition plays a critical role in creating and maintaining a habitable environment. For instance, the formation of aerosol particles (“hazes”) may affect the surface ultraviolet radiation flux and temperature and may serve as a source of complex organic molecules including nutrients. Although the composition of aerosols in planetary atmospheres is diverse, organic aerosols are of particular interest for our understanding of habitable worlds. Organic aerosol may serve as a potential biosignature for certain anoxic atmospheric compositions, and it may have played an important role in the climate and biogeochemistry of early Earth. Recently, we have explored how the addition of trace H2S (0-10 ppmv) affects organic haze analogs produced from ultraviolet photochemistry of reducing (N2/0.1% CH4) and weakly reducing (N2/0.1% CH4/0-2% CO2) gas mixtures. In these laboratory experiments, we analyze the aerosol products in real time using a suite of analytical instrumentation developed for studying modern Earth’s atmospheric chemistry. Specifically, we measure aerosol chemical composition using a quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer, aerosol size and number with a scanning mobility particle sizer, and aerosol optical properties and water uptake using photoacoustic and cavity ringdown spectroscopies. We find that the inclusion of trace amounts of H2S in the precursor mixture significantly enhances the formation of organic aerosol mass, increases particle effective density, alters aerosol optical properties, and leads to the formation of organosulfur aerosol. Notably, we find no evidence of S8 aerosol – a finding that challenges predictions that H2SO4 and S8 were the primary sulfur reservoirs in Earth's Archean atmosphere. We further explore how the changes in aerosol optical properties could influence the radiative forcing of a planet using a modified gray radiative scheme and we discuss the implications of our water uptake measurements on cloud formation and radiative forcing. Overall, our results suggest that coupled carbon-sulfur atmospheric chemistry significantly impacts organic haze with implications for planetary climate, habitability, biosignature detection, and prebiotic chemistry.\n\nand\n\nThe pollution impacts of disinfection-only air cleaners, and applying frequency combs for aerosol analysis\n\nJose-Luis Jimenez\n\nANYL Faculty\n\nOur group’s research focuses on understanding the sources, properties, transformations, and sinks of aerosols (and of the gases that interact with them), which have major effects on human health and climate. In this talk I will briefly summarize ongoing projects such as the upcoming NASA ASIA-AQ campaign and the ASCENT long-term monitoring site in Denver. However, I will mostly focus on upcoming projects of direct interest to first year PhD students. Airborne disease transmission was successfully labeled as a superstition by American epidemiologist Charles Chapin in 1910, with limited progress until the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has ushered in a paradigm shift in which most respiratory viruses are understood to have important or dominant airborne transmission. For this reason, many types of air cleaners focused only on disinfection have been developed and sold during the pandemic. Over the last year we have investigated the formation of pollutants from many of these air cleaners, including germicidal ultraviolet light (GUV). Multiple types of air cleaners form O3 and PM (SOA) indoors. I will summarize recent experimental and modeling results, showing that multiple types of air cleaners may kill more people from pollution than they save from disinfection. A likely PhD position in our group will expand recent and ongoing GUV experimental work to multiple types of air cleaners, and will quantify the SOA formation potential of indoor air.\n\nDual frequency combs are new light sources with unique properties for analytical spectroscopy. The mid-IR contains important chemical information about organic functional groups, but analysis of aerosols suspended in air in this region with techniques such as FTIR was considered infeasible, due to interferences from narrow absorption lines of abundant gases such as CO2. As part of the collaborative IARPA SAURON project led by CU-Boulder Engineering, a PhD student in our group will collaborate with the SAURON team to use new and emerging DFC mid-IR sources to explore the analysis of aerosols in an environmental chamber (and eventually simple field experiments), exploring the ability to subtract interfering gases and measure the spectrum of aerosols of different composition, concentration, and mixing state.\n\n10 October 2023\n\nParticle Formation and Growth in New Chemical Regimes\n\nEleanor Browne\n\nCU ANYL Faculty\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms through which aerosol particles form and grow is critical for constraining a planet’s energy budget, however, our knowledge of the key processes governing particle formation and growth in diverse environments remains weak. In the coming decades, our knowledge of particle formation and growth will continue to be challenged as changing climate and anthropogenic emissions alter the chemical regimes of modern-day atmospheric chemistry on Earth and measurements from, for instance, the James Webb Space Telescope and NASA’s Dragonfly mission offer increasingly chemically resolved insights into planetary atmospheres much different from our own.\n\nIn this talk I will highlight three of our projects on particle formation and growth in new and/or understudied chemical regimes. In the first part I will discuss our field measurements in an agricultural region, focusing on reactive nitrogen and carbon species that contribute to particle formation and growth. I will briefly touch on how vertical gradients in atmospheric composition and physical properties (e.g., temperature) affect particle formation and growth. Next, I will discuss our laboratory investigations of the atmospheric chemistry of volatile methyl siloxanes. These solely anthropogenic compounds have recently come under scrutiny for their potential toxicity and environmental persistence. Moreover, field measurements suggest that they are present in urban nanoparticles. Our work investigating the kinetics, mechanism, and aerosol yield of volatile methyl siloxane oxidation addresses key gaps in our understanding of their environmental chemistry. Lastly, I will describe our laboratory experiments exploring aerosol formation in anoxic planetary atmospheres. I will primarily focus on how organosulfur formation affects aerosol mass, composition, and optical properties in Archean Eon analog experiments and will discuss the implications for habitability and the understanding of the evolution of Earth’s atmosphere.\n\n9 October 2023\n\nLaboratory studies of the formation of atmospheric aerosol under different chemical regimes\n\nJesse Kroll,\n\nMIT Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n\nMIT Dept. of Chemical Engineering\n\nA large fraction of fine particulate matter (aerosol) in the atmosphere is secondary in nature, formed from the atmospheric oxidation of gas-phase compounds. This oxidation chemistry can govern the amount and properties of aerosol particles, and hence their impacts on climate and health. Much of our understanding of aerosol formation derives from laboratory studies, which to be most useful for atmospheric modeling should cover the range of atmospheric oxidation conditions as well as possible. One particular challenge is matching the chemistry of organic peroxy (RO2) radicals; these key intermediates can react via a number of channels – bimolecular reactions with different radical species (NO, HO2, RO2…) as well as unimolecular (isomerization) reactions – each of which may have its own reaction product distribution and aerosol yields. This talk will describe our group’s efforts to measure aerosol formation in an environmental (“smog”) chamber, across the full range of RO2 conditions found in the atmosphere. For the oxidation of a given aerosol precursor, we vary RO2 chemistry in the chamber by changing concentrations of various reactants, and estimate RO2 fate using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) of gas-phase products as well as mechanistic modeling of the oxidation chemistry. Chemical systems examined include the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3, emitted to the atmosphere by phytoplankton) to form sulfate aerosol, and the oxidation of isoprene and alpha-pinene (C5H8 and C10H16, emitted by plants) to form organic aerosol.\n\n2 October 2023\n\nLong-path atmospheric measurements using dual frequency comb spectroscopy\n\nKevin Cossel\n\nNIST, Boulder, CO\n\nOpen-path measurements of atmospheric gas species over km-scale path lengths are well suited to quantify emissions from sources like oil and gas production, agricultural activities, forest fires, and industry. Our group at NIST has developed open-path dual frequency comb spectroscopy (DCS) as a tool to provide accurate measurements of multiple trace gas species simultaneously across path lengths ranging from 100 m to >10 km.\n\nWe have used these systems for a number of field measurements. In the first campaign, we deployed a prototype system in the mid-infrared spectral region to a new oil and gas well installation in order to measure emissions during the different stages of unconventional well development. In another measurement, we deployed to the Platteville Atmospheric Observatory in north-eastern Colorado or 4 months. This site is located in the Denver-Julesburg oil and gas basin and in an area with a large number of confined animal feeding operations, leading to a complex mixture of trace gas emissions. By using measurements of ethane and NH3, we can attribute the observed CH4 to the oil and gas and agricultural sectors. We also see HCHO plumes that are correlated with C2H6, indicating oil and gas related sources of HCHO (likely from combustion). Finally, we took a system to a beef cattle stocker site to measure emissions of methane and NH3 over several months.\n\nCurrent opportunities in our group include field measurements working to understand urban greenhouse gas emissions and air quality links, testing mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture, and measuring emissions from forests as well as laboratory studies looking at emissions of greenhouse gases and reactive nitrogen from cyanobacteria and combustion.\n\nand\n\nExpanding the Use of 19F NMR Spectroscopy in Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Analysis\n\nAndre Schaum,\n\nANYL 1st year, CU Boulder\n\nAqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) have been used to extinguish liquid-fuel fires since the 1960s and are significant historical sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the environment. Though in the process of being phased out of use in the United States, large stockpiles of AFFFs still exist nationwide, often stored in poorly labeled containers and tanks. For proper assessment and disposal, rapid and inexpensive analytical methods are needed to quantify total fluorine, determine PFAS composition, and identify AFFF type. Current analytical methods that provide quantitative measures of individual PFAS in AFFFs, such as liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), are often complicated, time-consuming, and expensive. Methods for total fluorine analysis, though quantitative, provide relatively little information on the chemical nature of PFAS in AFFFs. Fluorine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (19F NMR) has previously been used to characterize PFAS in environmental matrices, technical mixtures, and analytical standards, though its application to AFFFs has been limited. Here, a 19F NMR method was developed for rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of fluorine content in AFFFs and used to identify the manufacturing method of two AFFFs of unknown origin.\n\n18 September 2023\n\nChemistry of Volatile Organic Compounds in the Atmosphere\n\nJoost de Gouw,\n\nANYL Faculty, CU Boulder\n\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released from many different natural and man-made sources to the atmosphere. VOCs are removed by different oxidants on time scales of minutes to months with oxidized VOCs, ozone and fine particles as a result. These processes affect air quality and climate and are a challenge to understand due to the large number of different VOCs that are released to the atmosphere and the analytical difficulties in measuring all of these compounds as well as their oxidation products.\n\nIn our laboratory, we make measurements of VOCs by proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). PTR-TOF allows measurements of many different VOCs with high time resolution and without the need for pre-separation or sample treatment. GC-MS allows higher chemical detail, but at the cost of time resolution. We also combine these methods to better understand the compounds that are detected by PTR-TOF in different environments.\n\nSeveral different ongoing and future projects will be presented in this seminar. First, we use PTR-TOF for measurements of VOCs in indoor environments to better understand their sources and fate. One particular study involves the impact of the Marshall Fire in Boulder County on indoor air in homes that were near the burnt area. Second, we are working on the emissions and chemistry of VOCs in urban air. One study that will be highlighted involved field measurements in Los Angeles in the Summer of 2022. Third, we are working on the indoor air chemistry induced by air cleaners such as germicidal UV lamps that are effective at inactivating airborne viruses. Finally, we are also using data from satellite remote sensing instruments to measure the pollutants from oil and natural gas production, in urban air and from wildfires.\n\nand\n\nFrom Coastal Megacities to Remote Oceans: Small Molecules in the Anthropocene\n\nRainer Volkamer,\n\nANYL Faculty, CU Boulder\n\nAnthropogenic enhancements of natural processes modify atmospheric chemistry in the urban and remote marine atmosphere. For example, marine iodine emissions have tripled in recent decades due to enhanced deposition of pollution ozone over oceans, affecting particle formation and the ozone layer. Furthermore, increasing emissions from wildfires pose challenges to public health and urban air quality. The Volkamer group develops advanced instrumentation (optical and mass spectrometric) to measure small molecules and condensable vapors relevant to particle formation, public health and climate discussions. We seek to better quantify and understand the interconnections between marine ecosystem, aerosols and their control on atmospheric chemistry. We also study the emissions and oxidative chemistry of coastal Megacities using research aircraft and satellites. Examples from recent field and laboratory experiments are discussed that aim to develop a molecular level understanding to test and advance atmospheric models. Opportunities for graduate research exist in 1) field measurements using research aircraft (i.e., TI3GER-2022, CUPiDS-2023, TI3GER2-2025 projects), 2) laboratory experiments of particle formation and multiphase chemistry (incl. at CLOUD/CERN), and to 3) develop instrumentation by exploiting synergies between optical spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.\n\n11 September 2023\n\nChemistry of Organic Compounds in the Atmosphere and Indoor Air\n\nPaul Ziemann,\n\nANYL faculty, CU Boulder\n\n\"Laboratory studies provide much of the fundamental data on reaction kinetics, products, and mechanisms that are needed to understand atmospheric and indoor air chemistry and to develop models that are used to establish air quality regulations and predict the effects of human activities. Research in my laboratory focuses primarily on environmental chamber studies of the atmospheric chemistry of organic compounds emitted from natural and anthropogenic sources and the physical and chemical processes by which oxidized organic reaction products form aerosol particles. In addition to this we have conducted a number of collaborative studies of indoor air chemistry at CU. In this talk I will provide a brief overview of recent research in my lab for the purpose of informing first-year chemistry graduate students.\"\n\nSummer 2023\n\n21 July 2023\n\nIt’s Okay to be Salty: Salt Deliquescence and Efflorescence Relevant to Mars and Earth\n\nMarium Fernanders,\n\nTolbert group,\n\nANYL PhD thesis\n\n\"The presence of salts in Martian soil gives rise to new mechanisms of liquid water formation through deliquescence and efflorescence of sediment salts. Observations by the Phoenix lander, Curiosity rover, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have detected hydrated salts in the Martian regolith, including chloride, perchlorate, and chlorate compounds. This thesis uses laboratory studies to investigate water uptake and loss by model systems to gain insight into the water cycle on Mars.\n\nWith recent discoveries of chlorine in the Martian soil, past research has focused on the deliquescence and efflorescence of perchlorate and chloride salts. However, less is known about chlorate salts. Chlorate is one of several intermediate oxidation states between perchlorate and chloride, however of the other oxychloride species chlorate is the more stable species and therefore more likely to exist on the Martian surface. Here, sodium chlorate and magnesium chlorate were studied to observe their moisture absorption and release behavior. It was found that sodium chlorate displayed temperature-dependent deliquescence and magnesium chlorate exhibited water uptake regardless of temperature. This could mean that magnesium chlorate can take up water at single digit relative humidities, making it an extremely Mars-relevant salt for study.\n\nUnderstanding the behavior of pure salts is crucial, but it's also important to consider real-world conditions that influence water uptake and release in sediment salts. Additionally, this thesis investigated the behavior of magnesium nitrate hexahydrate under Martian and Atacama Desert conditions. It was found that pure magnesium nitrate is unlikely to undergo aqueous cycling on Mars because the temperature and relative humidity required for nitrate deliquescence happens at relative humidities that is to wet at the same temperature present on Mars. However, in the Atacama Desert, nitrates in the soil can uptake water throughout the year, with peak uptake occurring in the fall season, potentially forming stable or metastable brines. A potentially year-round source of water could be used for microbial life to survive under the hyper-arid conditions present on the desert surface.\n\nFinally, complex sediment samples from Don Juan Pond's slope streaks were investigated as a model for Recurring Slope Lineae present on Mars. It was found that chlorine-bearing salts, such as sodium and calcium chloride, drive water uptake and deliquescence, while insoluble mineral components do not hinder water absorption. Efflorescence and deliquescence occurred at similar relative humidities, preventing supersaturation. Based on laboratory data and environmental conditions in the Lake Vanda region, episodic occurrence of slope streaks throughout the year, with higher prevalence in the southern summer and spring seasons, was predicted.\"\n\n15 May 2023\n\nFormation, Abundance, and Evolution of Molecular Products in α-Pinene and β-Pinene Secondary Organic Aerosol\n\nDr Christopher Kenseth,\n\nDepartment of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington\n\n\"Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) contributes substantially (15–80% by mass) to the global burden of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which exerts large but uncertain effects on climate as well as adverse impacts on air quality and human health. The oxidation of α-pinene and β-pinene (C10H16), emitted in appreciable quantities from forested regions (~85 Tg y-1), represents a dominant source of SOA. Deciphering the molecular composition, and in turn formation and aging mechanisms, of α-pinene and β-pinene SOA is essential to reducing uncertainty in assessment of their environmental and health impacts. However, molecular characterization of α-pinene and β-pinene SOA, which generally consist of hundreds or more compounds of diverse classes, is significantly hindered by their chemical complexity. This seminar will present an overview of research aimed at constraining the formation, abundance, and evolution of molecular products in SOA derived from the ozonolysis and photooxidation of α-pinene and β-pinene using a combination of environmental chamber and flow tube experiments, liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS), and organic synthesis.\"\n\nSpring 2023\n\n1 May 2023\n\nAir-Sea Exchange of Reactive Gases: Chemistry at Interfaces and Partitioning in Aqueous Droplets\n\nRandall Chiu,\n\nVolkamer group,\n\nANYL PhD thesis\n\n\"Many puzzles remain regarding the interaction of halogens with oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC) in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Observations of the OVOC glyoxal (CHOCHO) over the remote Pacific Ocean are difficult to reconcile with its brief (2-4 hour) atmospheric lifetime and high water solubility (Henry’s law constant ~4×105 M/atm). In those same airmasses, concentrations of reactive halogen species, specifically bromine monoxide (BrO) are below detection limits even though models predict up to 1.3 pptv. Presented here is a surface reaction that holds promise for explaining one or both puzzles. In the lab, fatty acids on a simulated sea surface microlayer (SML) undergo photochemical transformation to unsaturated aldehydes (2-alkenals), subsequent ozonolysis of which produces glyoxal. In a follow-up study, 2-alkenals were shown to react with Br to produce HBr in high yield. Depending on the concentration of fatty acids in SML, fatty acid photochemistry holds promise as a candidate for the missing BrO sink.\n\nThe second work presented are aircraft ozone eddy covariance (EC) flux over the Pacific Ocean during the 2023 Technical Innovation Into Iodine and GV Environmental Research (TI3GER) technical campaign. Ozone EC fluxes were measured with three independent ozone sensors of two different designs (NCAR Fast O3, a nitric oxide chemiluminescence instrument, and KIT Fast Airborne O3, a coumarin dry chemiluminescence instrument), which has not been done before. All three instruments were shown to be suitable for EC flux experiments. Particularly interesting case studies are presented in which ozone EC flux exhibits different spatial variability than water vapor EC flux. In addition, the availability of three independent EC flux measurements was used to constrain the uncertainty and limit of detection (LOD) methods in the literature.\"\n\n24 April 2023\n\nThe Role of Organic Heterogeneous Nuclei in Contact Crystallization of Atmospherically Relevant Salts\n\nKyle McMillan,\n\nANYL 3rd year, Tolbert group\n\nThe overall radiative effect of atmospheric aerosols on climate is currently a major source of uncertainty in climate models. Essential in resolving this uncertainty is a complete understanding of the particle phase state in the atmosphere. Often overlooked in current studies on the particle phase is the role of collisions in inducing contact nucleation. Thus, more research that focuses on determining which atmospherically relevant compounds are most likely to be involved in contact nucleation under varying conditions is warranted. Of interest here was evaluating the effectiveness of organic-containing contact nuclei (CN) in inducing contact efflorescence of aqueous salt-containing droplets. To do this, contact efflorescence was probed on freely floating aqueous ammonium sulfate (AS) droplets using a long-working distance optical trap. In this setup, optically levitated droplets were contacted with both glassy (D-(+)-raffinose and citric acid) and surface-active (stearic acid and cis-pinonic acid) organic CN over a range of relative humidity (RH) values above the homogeneous efflorescence RH of AS. The purpose of these experiments was to determine if certain organic-containing CN could induce contact efflorescence of aqueous droplets at an RH significantly above the homogeneous efflorescence RH of AS. Far-field imaging was employed as a way of probing crystallization either in the contact or homogeneous modes, and was supplemented with near-field imaging, which was used to track contact events. Droplet compositions before and after crystal nucleation were characterized using Raman spectrometry to track the liquid water content of the droplet. Promising in these experiments is the effectiveness of surface-active organics—in particular, cis- pinonic acid—in inducing contact efflorescence of AS, which has major implications for the particle phase state of the troposphere. Continued experiments in this area will provide key insight into the interactions that cause contact to be effective at initiating nucleation and will ultimately lay the groundwork for analogous contact ice nucleation studies.\n\n17 April 2023 - special seminar\n\nEnvironmental Analytical Chemistry in an Art Museum\n\nJulia Bakker-Arkema, Ph.D.,\n\nAssociate Research Scientist, Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n(Ziemann Group alum, 2020)\n\nAs a preventive conservation scientist at a museum, my work is centered around improving environmental conditions during the conservation, transportation, storage, and display of cultural heritage objects. I will share some current work using gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify and quantify volatile organic compounds emitted from conservation materials that have the potential to damage the surfaces of art and artifacts, and hopefully I’ll give you a sense of what it means to be an analytical chemist in an art museum. During my Ph.D. research in the Ziemann lab, I investigated the oxidation of volatile organic compounds and the formation of secondary organic aerosol through environmental chamber studies. My experience and interest in environmental analytical chemistry led me down various paths both in and out of the laboratory, including science policy on ozone management in the front range, an indoor air field campaign in Texas, science communication workshops for Women in Science & Engineering, and website design and video production with the Sloan Foundation. I’ll discuss each of these pursuits, and how I applied the skills I learned to launch a career in teaching and research at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This talk is aimed at graduate students, and all questions are welcome!\n\n17 April 2023\n\nDesign and Characterization of the CU-Boulder Environmental Chamber Facility & Long-term and High-time-resolution Measurement for the Characterization of Aerosol Properties in the Denver Metropolitan Area\n\nSeonsik Yun,\n\nANYL 3rd year, Jimenez group\n\n\"Environmental reaction chambers are essential tools for studying atmospheric chemistry and physics based on laboratory experiments. The design of chambers varies concerning the chamber sizes, temperature/humidity controls, light sources, air purification, and operating conditions to simulate atmospheric chemistry reactions and are often used to investigate secondary organic aerosol formation. Here we present a new state-of-the-art CU-Boulder environmental chamber facility and its design and characterizations.\n\nThe Atmospheric Science and Chemistry mEasurement NeTwork (ASCENT) is a new comprehensive, high-time-resolution, long-term measurement network in the U.S. to characterize aerosol chemical composition and physical properties. As one of 12 sites of the ASCENT, La Casa site is located near downtown Denver, Colorado, and will be equipped with a suite of advanced aerosol instrumentation: Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM, non-refractory aerosols), Xact (trace metals), Aethalometer (black/brown carbon), and Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS, aerosol number size distribution and concentration). Additional instrumentation, such as a Vocus Proton Transfer Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (Vocus PTR-TOF, gas phase volatile organic compounds) and a radon detector (RAD7), will also be deployed to address a comprehensive data analysis on Denver urban aerosols. In this talk, I will present the preliminary results from the ASCENT instrumentation and future research opportunities.\"\n\n11 April 2023\n\nMeasurements of Volatile Organic Compounds in Urban Air by Proton-Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry\n\nAndrew Jensen,\n\nde Gouw Group\n\nCU ANYL Dissertation Defense\n\n\"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urban environments are emitted to the atmosphere from many biogenic and anthropogenic sources. VOC oxidation contributes to the formation of secondary products, including ozone and secondary organic aerosol, which negatively impact air quality and human health. As emissions change, VOC measurements are necessary to reassess their role in urban air quality. Here, I present results from measurements of ambient VOCs in three urban environments made by proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) with part-per-trillion by volume detection limits.\n\nI first detail the quantification of VOCs measured in Boulder, CO in spring 2021 with a focus on instrument characterization. I developed a PTR Data Tool to parameterize instrument response which, in turn, informs the quality of the measurements and the quantification of VOCs which cannot be directly calibrated. These findings help streamline and improve future PTR-MS measurements.\n\nVOCs were also measured in Changzhou, an industrial Chinese city, before, during, after the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns which shut down non-essential activities. I quantified strong reductions in industrial and transportation emissions. These estimates help inform emission inventories and chemistry-transport models during this global perturbation of air pollution, as well as possible future scenarios with reduced emissions.\n\nFinally, VOCs were measured in the Los Angeles basin, California during summer 2022. Ambient concentrations of primary VOCs from vehicles have declined over the preceding decade due to emission regulations while concentrations of secondary VOCs were largely unchanged, in part, due to faster oxidation and unregulated emission sources. This study expands the detected subset of urban VOCs and allows for a more detailed understanding of atmospheric sources and fates.\"\n\n10 April 2023\n\nPollution distribution in the Denver metroplex: Chemical, sociological, and historical insights\n\nAlexander Bradley,\n\nANYL 3rd year, de Gouw group\n\n\"Prior studies have shown that people of color in the United States are exposed to higher levels of pollution than non-Hispanic White people. We show that the city of Denver, Colorado displays similar race and ethnicity-based air pollution discrepancies by using a combination of high-resolution satellite data, air pollution modeling, historical demographic information, and areal apportionment techniques. TROPOMI NO2 columns and modeled PM2.5 concentrations from 2019 are higher in communities subject to redlining, a discriminatory mortgage appraisal practice from the 1930s by the federal Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC). We calculated and compared Spearman coefficients for pollutants and race at the census tract level for every city that underwent redlining to contextualize the disparities in Denver. We find inequitable siting of polluting infrastructure leading to higher populations of people of color living near point sources, including 40% higher Hispanic and Latino populations; Traffic analysis and emission inventory data show that people of color are more likely to live near busy highways. Unequal opportunities for people of color has allowed for pollution disparities to persist despite attempts by the city to rectify them . Finally, we identify core causes of the pollution disparities to provide direction for remediation.\"\n\n4 April 2023\n\nOptical Properties of Brown Carbon Found in Earth and Planetary Haze Aerosol\n\nKevin Jansen,\n\nTolbert group\n\nCU ANYL Dissertation Defense\n\n\"Atmospheric aerosol has long been documented to be capable of both scattering and absorbing incoming solar radiation, leading to either a net cooling or warming effect on planetary atmospheres. Despite the optical properties of some forms of aerosol such as inorganic salts being well characterized, the optical properties of organic aerosol are not as well established. While most organic aerosol is only capable of scattering light in the atmosphere, a fraction of organic aerosol does absorb light. Unlike inorganic “black carbon” which absorbs light throughout the visible wavelength range, so-called organic “brown carbon” is capable of absorbing light at in the near ultraviolet tailing off in the visible. Brown carbon aerosol can account for a significant fraction of the total light absorption at lower wavelengths in various atmospheres. For example brown carbon account for up to twenty percent of Earth’s light absorption at wavelengths <400nm, implying brown carbon can have a major effect on a planet’s total radiative forcing.\n\nPart of the uncertainty in the magnitude and direction of brown carbon forcing stems from the fact that atmospheric aerosol contains numerous organic compounds, each with their own optical properties. Depending on the aerosol source, ambient conditions, and any potential atmospheric processing, the optical and chemical properties of brown carbon can vary dramatically over time.\n\nThis thesis examines the effects of both formation conditions and atmospheric processing on two different brown carbon aerosol systems. First, the optical properties of brown carbon formed via aqueous reactions of carbonyls and ammonium found in Earth’s atmosphere were characterized under varying pH conditions. It was found that brown carbon formation is heavily dependent on the pH, with brown carbon formation being favored under basic conditions. At the same time, brown carbon was also formed under acidic, atmospheric conditions in aerosol particles that are incapable of forming in acidic bulk phase solutions, indicating a unique reaction only accessible in aerosol particles. In addition, the ozonolysis of this brown carbon in the atmosphere was simulated in a flow tube to monitor the potential loss of the aerosol’s light absorption. It was found that despite readily reacting with ozone, a recalcitrant fraction of brown carbon retains its ability to absorb light, indicating it can have a persistent warming effect as it remains in Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nBrown carbon is not limited to the Earth's atmosphere, but has been detected in the atmospheres of other planets as well. For instance, organic brown carbon has been found on Titan, Saturn's largest moon and may have been important on the Archean Earth as well. For planetary atmospheres without obvious sources of large organic molecules, brown carbon is likely formed through photochemical reactions of small molecules including methane. Here, light absorbing aerosol was generated by exposing mixtures of CH4/CO2/H2S in N2 to deep UV light to mimic aerosol formation potentially found in planetary hazes. It was found that the light absorption of the haze aerosol decreased as the concentration of CO2 increased. This trend was found to be due to the formation of non-absorbing, sulfate salts. In addition, the aerosol was found to be more hygroscopic as the CO2 concentration increased, implying the aerosol could grow in size and scatter light more efficiently, implying the CO2 could have a significant effect on the optical properties of planetary haze aerosol and subsequently its radiative forcing.\n\nBecause brown carbon has been found in both Earth's atmosphere and in the atmospheres of other planets, these studies of the optical properties of brown carbon could assist in modeling the radiative forcing and climate trends of both Earth and various planetary systems.\"\n\n3 April 2023\n\nChemical and Meteorological Controls on New Particle Formation in the Southern Great Plains\n\nBri Dobson, ANYL 3rd year,\n\nBrowne group\n\n\"New particle formation (NPF) is estimated to account for 40 – 70 % of cloud condensation nuclei and therefore plays a central role in our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions. It is well established that the likelihood of NPF is influenced by both chemical precursors, such as sulfuric acid, ammonia, amines, and organic compounds, as well as physical atmospheric conditions. However, the complexity of the process leads to large uncertainties in the representation of NPF in models. A complete understanding of the conditions that lead to NPF requires observations of both gas-phase chemistry as well as physical and meteorological conditions. Additionally, these measurements must be made in diverse ecosystems as both chemical and physical conditions vary by region.\n\nWe investigated NPF in agricultural regions, which have been understudied compared to urban and forested regions. To do so, we deployed an atmospheric-pressure interface time-of-flight mass spectrometer (APi-TOF) and a chemical ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer with ethanol reagent ion (EtOH-CIMS) to the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in rural Oklahoma in October 2021 and Spring 2022. These mass spectrometry measurements of gas-phase compounds along with the long-term meteorological measurements from the ARM SGP site allow us to further investigate the chemical and physical conditions that contribute to NPF. In this talk, I will present a case study of two of the observed NPF events during our spring observing period. Changes in transported gases and atmospheric conditions cause differences in new particle formation and growth over the course of a few days at the same location.\"\n\n20 March 2023\n\nOzone photochemistry and free radical budgets in the Los Angeles basin: A comparison of ground-based observations in 2021 and 2010\n\nMichael Robinson,\n\nANYL 3rd year, Brown group\n\n\"Radical precursors and termination products are important factors to understanding sensitivities of ozone (O3) production to nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). During the summer of 2021, an extensive set of photochemical measurements were conducted at a ground site on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, CA to evaluate emissions and photochemistry in the Los Angeles (LA) basin. Here we present the calibration and measurement of important radical precursors and compare them to observations from the CalNex 2010 field intensive. Major radical sources include formaldehyde (HCHO) and other aldehydes, nitrous acid (HONO), nitryl chloride (ClNO2), ozonolysis of alkenes, and O(1D) + H2O. In addition to radical precursors, radical termination products were measured, including peroxy acetyl nitrates (PAN), nitric acid (HNO3), organic nitrates and organic peroxides. The comparison of radical precursors and termination products illustrates shifts in photochemical regime resulting from NOx and VOC emissions changes over the past ten years in the LA basin, as well as other influences such as temperature, seasonality and day of week.\"\n\n14 March 2023\n\nThe Effects of Trace H2S in Laboratory Experiments of Planetary Organic Haze Chemistry\n\nNathan William Reed,\n\nTolbert group / Browne group\n\nCU ANYL Dissertation Defense\n\nPlanetary organic hazes from methane (CH4) photochemistry and atmospheric sulfur gases are each common in planetary atmospheres, including the Archean Earth and, likely, exoplanetary atmospheres. A planetary organic haze can affect a planet’s radiative forcing and interpretations of observable spectra, as well as act as a source for prebiotic chemistry and nutrients for life. However, cross reactions between inorganic sulfur and organic molecules to form organosulfur have yet to be explored in haze chemistry. The objective of my thesis is to explore the coupling between hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and organic haze chemistry. Here I present the results of laboratory experiments using aerosol mass spectrometry, differential mobility analysis, and optical measurements to explore how trace H2S influences the compositional, physical, and optical properties of aerosol from organic haze analogs produced by CH4 photochemistry. I investigated the chemistry of aerosol formed in reducing (CH4/H2S gas mixtures in N2, varying trace H2S) and weakly reducing (CO2/CH4/H2S gas mixtures in N2, varying CO2) atmospheric conditions.\n\nWhen I included trace H2S in precursor mixtures, the total organic aerosol mass increased in both conditions, despite H2S not being a carbon source. Moreover, I found evidence for the formation of organic reduced sulfur (ORS) and organic oxidized sulfur (OOS) compounds in the reducing and weakly reducing conditions, respectively. At lower CO2 mixing ratios, I attributed the total sulfate signal to be entirely OOS. Thus, in contrast to previous thought, I show that ORS and OOS are potentially significant atmospheric sulfur reservoirs. Further, I found the compositional changes in the reducing conditions lead to changes in the aerosol optical properties, as the total extinction (absorption plus scattering) of light increased with increasing H2S mixing ratios. I found that trace H2S dramatically influences the organic aerosol composition, mass, and optical properties by the formation of organosulfur (ORS and OOS) compounds and enhancing organic aerosol formation. These results have implications for Archean atmospheric chemistry, prebiotic chemistry, planetary climate, and spectral interpretations for exoplanetary atmospheres.\n\nThus, future work should consider the potential impacts of trace H2S on organic haze chemistry.\n\n13 March 2023\n\nMetal Oxide Particles as Atmospheric Nuclei: Exploring the Role of Metal Speciation in Heterogeneous Efflorescence and Ice Nucleation\n\nZachary Schiffman, ANYL 3rd year,\n\nTolbert group\n\n\"ABSTRACT: Mineral dust can indirectly impact climate by nucleation of atmospheric solids, for example by heterogeneously nucleating ice in mixed-phase clouds or by impacting the phase of aerosols and clouds through contact nucleation. The effectiveness toward nucleation of individual components of mineral dust requires further study. Here, the nucleation behavior of metal oxide nanoparticle components of atmospheric mineral dust is investigated. A long working distance optical trap is used to study contact and immersion nucleation of ammonium sulfate by transition metal oxides, and an environmental chamber is used to probe depositional ice nucleation on metal oxides particles. Previous theory dictates that ice nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation of atmospheric salts can be impacted by several factors including morphology, lattice match, and surface area. Here, we observe a correlation between the cationic oxidation states of the metal oxide heterogeneous nuclei and their effectiveness in causing nucleation in both contact efflorescence mode and depositional freezing mode. In contrast with the activity of contact efflorescence, the same metal oxide particles did not cause a significant increase in efflorescence relative humidity when immersed in the droplet. These experiments suggest that metal speciation, possibly as a result of cationic charge sites, may play a role in the effectiveness of nucleation that is initiated at particle surfaces.\"\n\n6 March 2023\n\nAdvancing Process-based Understanding of How Humans Are Changing the Global Sulfur Cycle\n\nProf. Eve-Lyn Hinckley,\n\nUniv. of Colorado Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\n\n\"Today, the nature of how humans alter the global sulfur (S) cycle is changing. As atmospheric S deposition has declined in response to air quality regulation in the United States and Europe, there has been an increase in S fertilizer applications reported in many large-scale regional crop systems. In addition, intensification of agriculture has driven increased S inputs for other uses: as a pesticide, regulator of soil pH, and soil conditioner. Given that excess S can cause soil acidification and mobilization of heavy metals in ecosystems, it is critical to develop methods to trace the “fingerprint” of agricultural S through complex landscapes, quantify S forms and transformations in soils and surface waters, and determine the consequences of its use. In this talk, I will describe both new trend analyses and process-based studies that provide compelling evidence for how the forms, amounts, flows, and consequences of S have changed from what they were in the 1960s and 1970s when the dominant human manipulation of the S cycle was through mining and fossil fuel emissions. I will highlight studies from my research group that show exciting new methodological developments using radio- and stable isotopes of S adapted from the marine literature to trace S applications through large agricultural regions. I will also discuss the collaborative actions that researchers, land managers, and regulators may take to address the consequences of excess S in the environment. Ultimately, I will make the case for how an element that has been far less investigated than carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, should be a priority for study in the coming years.\"\n\n27 February 2023\n\nInvestigations into the health effects of wildfire smoke\n\nProf. Colleen Reid,\n\nUniv. of Colorado Geography and Institute for Behavioral Science\n\n\"Wildfires have been increasing in frequency and duration in the western U.S. and the wildfire season has been increasing in length such that many regions now claim that there is no wildfire season anymore but that wildfires have become a year-round threat. While there are many causes of the increase in wildfires in the western U.S., it is becoming clear that wildfires not only affect forests and grasslands, but also have impacts on the health of populations downwind. Indeed studies have shown that fine particulate air pollution () is decreasing in most areas of the United States, except for areas most affected by wildfires, where an increasing trend in can be attributed to wildfire smoke. Studies of the health impacts of wildfire smoke are challenging due to lack of sufficient air pollution monitoring across space, the complexity of the components of the smoke that could affect human health, the numerous health outcomes that have been found to be linked to wildfire smoke, and more. In her talk, Dr. Reid will dive into her research that investigates how to better assess population exposure to wildfire smoke, how it impacts human health, and which communities are more affected by wildfire smoke. She will also provide a glimpse into her ongoing work to understand the health tradeoffs of interventions to protect health from wildfire smoke.\"\n\n20 February 2023\n\nAssessment of indoor air quality using substance-specific guide values and TVOC\n\nProf. Tunga Salthammer\n\nDepartment of Material Analysis and Indoor Chemistry, Fraunhofer WKI\n\n\"The primary goal of indoor hygiene studies is to create a pleasant and healthy environment for people. This requires a sufficient supply of fresh air and the setting of climatic parameters that lead to thermal comfort. However, the concentration of air pollutants must also be kept as low as possible. A complete measurement program to study indoor air quality can be both time-consuming and expensive. For this reason, parameters that can be measured easily and quickly are often used for an initial assessment of the situation. One of these parameters is TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds).\n\nThe current situation makes it necessary to subject VVOC, VOC, SVOC and TVOC measurements to a critical analysis due to their widespread use in questions of indoor air quality and to the evaluation of emissions of organic compounds from building and consumer products.\n\nA detailed description of the measurement methods is followed by a critical evaluation of the various TVOC values, their possible applications and guide values for individual compounds. The aim is to provide a deeper understanding of TVOC in order to use this parameter correctly and to be able to better assess published results. The analytical definition of VOCs also suggests total values TVVOC and TSVOC for very volatile and semi volatile organic compounds. However, due to the physical properties of the potential target chemicals, this is associated with a number of drawbacks.\n\nEarly work on TVOC was trend-setting and still influences current indoor guide values, even if many VOCs are no longer representative from today's perspective. The spectrum of indoor VOCs has shifted significantly: away from classic solvents and more towards reactive compounds and indoor chemistry. However, within the framework of surveys TVOC can make contributions to identifying statistical trends and reference values can be extracted from the data collected in this way. The online measured TVOC values are at best suitable for screening IAQ. TVOC does not take into account the toxicological properties of the individual substances for inhalation exposure. This would not even be possible, since different substances usually have different toxicological endpoints that cannot simply be summed up for a reliable risk assessment. Therefore, measurements of individual substances are usually evaluated using substance-specific guide values.\n\nConsequently, TVOC cannot be used in connection with health-related and odor-related issues. Nevertheless, such references are repeatedly made, either intentionally or unintentionally. This happens in an analytical but also in an interpretative sense. Authorities, practitioners and architects use TVOC as an acceptance criterion for buildings, but without specifying the methodology. Overall, there is a great deal of uncertainty about TVOC. This applies in particular to the question of whether and why a TVOC value can be helpful and which statements cannot be made on the basis of the TVOC.\"\n\nReference: Salthammer, T. (2022).

Such ozone depletion events are consistently followed by surface temperature and precipitation anomalies over vast parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Using chemistry-climate models, it can be shown that the loss of stratospheric ozone is an important cause of these surface anomalies, as it leads to persistently cold temperatures in the lower stratosphere and alters stratospheric dynamics. Including chemical processes involving ozone in forecast models could therefore increase predictability on a sub-seasonal to seasonal scale. Similarly, the long-term trend in Arctic ozone caused by the decline of CFCs also has important implications for stratospheric temperature and dynamics. The imminent recovery of the ozone layer will heat the polar stratosphere, and its fingerprint is expected to be seen all the way down to the surface, as model simulations show. Therefore, a realistic representation of ozone in climate models is required to reduce uncertainty in climate projections.”\n\n6 February 2023\n\nFrequency comb spectroscopy: from Nobel prize to practical application\n\nProf. Greg Rieker & Prof. Scott Diddams,\n\nCU Engineering\n\n\"The first frequency comb laser was demonstrated on the CU Boulder campus in 1999 in Jan Hall’s lab at JILA. In the two decades since, the technology has proliferated across a vast array of scientific fields from timekeeping and astronomy, to low-noise frequency synthesis and precision spectroscopy for fundamental physics. In recent years, it made the jump to practical applications at the forefront of climate and energy, for example as the foundation of a sensor network detecting methane leaks across 750 sq. miles of oil and gas infrastructure. Prof Diddams will discuss the evolution of frequency comb lasers, metrology and sensing techniques developed in his laboratory at NIST and now CU, which are pushing the boundaries of sensing from the UV to the THz, and from macro to micro-scale comb systems. Prof. Rieker will discuss the push toward robust, fieldable frequency comb systems and practical applications, ending with recent collaborative work between the laboratories on sensing in high-speed chemically reacting systems.\"\n\n30 January 2023\n\nFormation and dissociation of hydrocarbons under interstellar conditions\n\nProf. Jordy Bouwman,\n\nCHEM & LASP, Univ. of Colorado\n\n\"Hydrocarbons of all sizes and shapes are found throughout the various stages of star and planet formation. Recently, using radio astronomical observations, a variety of cyclic and even polycyclic hydrocarbons have been detected in the very cold (10 K) Taurus molecular cloud, challenging our understanding of the chemical formation pathways under these low-temperature and low-density conditions. In photon dominated regions, on the other hand, very large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) of 50 carbon atoms and larger are commonly detected as a class based on the characteristic mid-infrared emission bands that they emit after being electronically excited by ultraviolet and optical radiation. These large PAHs are exposed to a very strong radiation field that can alter their molecular structure and may even lead to dissociation. In this seminar, I will show how experimental studies using synchrotron and free electron laser radiation – in conjunction with quantum chemical computations – allow us to reveal the formation and dissociation mechanisms of interstellar (aromatic) hydrocarbons at a molecular level of detail.\"\n\n23 January 2023\n\nSecondary Organic Aerosol Mass Yields from NO3 Oxidation of α-Pinene and Δ-Carene: Effect of RO2 Radical Fate\n\nDoug Day,\n\n(ANYL ResSci, Jimenez group)\n\n\"Dark chamber experiments were conducted to study the SOA formed from the oxidation of α-pinene and Δ-carene under different peroxy radical (RO2) fate regimes: RO2 + NO3, RO2 + RO2, and RO2 + HO2. SOA mass yields from α-pinene oxidation were <1 to ∼25% and strongly dependent on available OA mass up to ∼100 μg m–3. The strong yield dependence of α-pinene oxidation is driven by absorptive partitioning to OA and not by available surface area for condensation. Yields from Δ-carene + NO3 were consistently higher, ranging from ∼10–50% with some dependence on OA for <25 μg m–3. Explicit kinetic modeling including vapor wall losses was conducted to enable comparisons across VOC precursors and RO2 fate regimes and to determine atmospherically relevant yields. Furthermore, SOA yields were similar for each monoterpene across the nominal RO2 + NO3, RO2 + RO2, or RO2 + HO2 regimes; thus, the volatility basis sets (VBS) constructed were independent of the chemical regime. Elemental O/C ratios of ∼0.4–0.6 and nitrate/organic mass ratios of ∼0.15 were observed in the particle phase for both monoterpenes in all regimes, using aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements. An empirical relationship for estimating particle density using AMS-derived elemental ratios, previously reported in the literature for non-nitrate containing OA, was successfully adapted to organic nitrate-rich SOA. Observations from an NO3– chemical ionization mass spectrometer (NO3–CIMS) suggest that Δ-carene more readily forms low-volatility gas-phase highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) than α-pinene, which primarily forms volatile and semivolatile species, when reacted with NO3, regardless of RO2 regime. The similar Δ-carene SOA yields across regimes, high O/C ratios, and presence of HOMs, suggest that unimolecular and multistep processes such as alkoxy radical isomerization and decomposition may play a role in the formation of SOA from Δ-carene + NO3. The scarcity of peroxide functional groups (on average, 14% of C10 groups carried a peroxide functional group in one test experiment in the RO2 + RO2 regime) appears to rule out a major role for autoxidation and organic peroxide (ROOH, ROOR) formation.
