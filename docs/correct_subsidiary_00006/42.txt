Ascend Communications is to buy Cascade Communications in a $US3.7 billion effort to gain a stranglehold on the rapidly growing telecommunications access market, it was announced yesterday.

The acquisition of one fairly lowprofile networking company by another is still one of the largest in computing history. It was eclipsed by 3Com's recent $US6.6 billion acquisition of US Robotics but bigger than IBM's $US3.5 billion purchase of Lotus and the $US2.7 billion merger of SynOptics and Wellfleet to form Bay Networks.
