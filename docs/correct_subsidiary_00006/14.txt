Morteza Ejabat

MORTEZA EJABAT is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Zhone

Technologies, Inc., the first company dedicated solely to delivering the

full spectrum of next-generation wireline communications equipment.

Under his leadership, Zhone’s market share and product portfolio has

grown significantly both through organic growth and the 10 acquisitions

Zhone has made in the past four years. In addition, Zhone has recently

become a publicly traded company through a reverse merger with Tellium,

Inc., in November 2003. Before founding Zhone, Mr. Ejabat was President

and CEO of Ascend Communications, Inc., which was sold to Lucent

Technologies in 1999 for $24 billion. Ascend was the leader in wide area

network (WAN) solutions for providers and users of the Public Network.

Mr. Ejabat joined Ascend in 1990 as Vice President of Operations and

assumed increasingly strategic roles within the company over his tenure

with the company. He served as President, COO and Director of Ascend

before its IPO in 1995. Under Mr. Ejabat’s leadership, Ascend’s annual

sales grew from $40 million to nearly $2.3 billion in just over five

years, with an increase in personnel from less than 100 to more than

3,000 full-time employees by the end of 1998. Ascend’s business success

was achieved both through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, the

most notable being the $3.7 billion purchase of Cascade Communications

in 1997 and of Stratus Computer Corporation in 1998. Earlier, Mr. Ejabat

was Vice President for wide area communications products at Micom

Systems, Inc., where he had total P&L responsibility for the WAN product

line. Mr. Ejabat received his BSIE and his MS in Systems Engineering

from California State University at Northridge and he holds an MBA from

Pepperdine University.
