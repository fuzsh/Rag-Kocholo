        "text": "In the 1890s, mining activity developed in the area around Grandview Point, launched by a group of local miners that included Ralph Cameron and Pete Berry. The two men found just the right “color” in rocks on Horseshoe Mesa below the rim, filed claims in 1890 and profitably extracted copper, gold, and silver for over a decade before selling out. To get to their “Last Chance mine,” Berry and Cameron improved a trail down from Grandview Point in 1893, partially following an old Native American route, and used mules and ropes to haul up the ore. A realigned version of Grandview Trail takes hikers to Horseshoe Mesa and on to the Colorado River.\n\nThe Santa Fe Railroad offered to buy the property, but the Berrys refused to sell out to their nemesis and instead sold their homestead and hotel to the California newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst in 1913. Hearst also bought all 200 acres of the Canyon Copper Company properties including the Grandview Hotel. The Berrys became caretakers of the Hearst property until 1919, delighted that a rich and powerful business mogul had snatched opportunity from the railroad company that drove them out of business.\n\nHearst never posed any threat to the Santa Fe Railroad, though. He kept the property primarily as a family retreat, having no need to profit from it. As soon as he purchased the property, he closed the two hotels. But for years afterward continued to dream of developing a tourist resort on the property. This troubled the National Park Service, which took over management of the Grand Canyon in 1919. Park managers worried about controlling haphazard tourist development so early park policy sought to concentrate private tourist facilities in the hands of a single concessionaire that would operate under a strictly regulated franchise. The Fred Harvey Company had evolved into that monopoly concessionaire and Hearst was a fly in the ointment."
