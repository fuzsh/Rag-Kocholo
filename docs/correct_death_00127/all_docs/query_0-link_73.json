        "text": "Sat, 20 Jun 2020 15:14\n\nThuggeeGroup of Thugs around 1894\n\nFoundedUnknown[1]Named afterSanskrit word for concealment[2]Founding locationCentral India and BengalYears activeUnknownTerritoryIndian subcontinentMembershipunknownActivitiesMurder, robberyRivalsBritish RajThuggee (, ) refers to the acts of Thugs, an organised gang of professional robbers and murderers. The English language word thug traces its roots to the Hindi à¤ à¤ (á¹­hag), which means 'swindler' or 'deceiver'. Related words are the verb thugna ('to deceive'), from the Sanskrit à¤¸à¥à¤¥à¤ (sthaga 'cunning, sly, fraudulent') and à¤¸à¥à¤¥à¤à¤¤à¤ (sthagati, 'he conceals').[3] This term, describing the murder and robbery of travellers, was popular in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent and particularly India.\n\nThugs are said to have travelled in groups across the Indian subcontinent.[4] There were numerous traditions about their origin. One recorded by D. F. McLeod traced it to some Muslim tribes formed from those who fled Delhi after murdering a physician. Another traced it to some great Muslim families who fled after murdering a favoured slave of Akbar.[5] These original Muslim Thugs spread Thuggee amongst Rajputs, Hindus, Lodhis and Ahirs.[6] According to other traditions by Thugs, they were Kanjars or descended from those who worked in the Mughal camps.[7][8] Others have blamed the rise of Thugs on the disbanding of armies in employment of Indian rulers after the British conquest.[9]Thugs are said to have operated as gangs of highway robbers, tricking and later strangling their victims.[10]\n\nTo take advantage of their victims, the thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence; this would allow them to surprise and strangle the travellers with a handkerchief or noose. They would then rob and bury their victims. This led to the thugs being called Phansigar (English: \"using a noose\" ), a term more commonly used in southern India.[11] During the 1830s, the thugs were targeted for eradication by the Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck, and his chief captain, William Henry Sleeman.\n\nContemporary scholarship is increasingly skeptical of the thuggee concept, and has questioned the existence of such a phenomenon,[12][13] which has led historians to describe thuggee as the invention of the British colonial regime.[14]\n\nModus operandi [ edit ] The Thuggee units would resemble the physical appearance of travellers. Initially they wore turbans and carried with themselves some kinds of baggage. Their attire as travelers would deceive peasants and royalty alike.\n\nThe methods used by Thuggee were meant to reap maximum loot without being caught. They did not accost travelers unless their own numbers were greater than the victims. They flattered travelers they met, which gave them a chance to assess what wealth their targets might have. Many of them avoided committing thuggee near the areas they lived, making discovering their crimes a difficult task.[15] They often pretended to be either Hindu or Muslim to fool their victims.[16]\n\nThey usually attacked in the evening. A common method used by them was to distract their targets while striking to strangle them from behind. In order to avoid suspicion, they avoided carrying more than a few swords.[17] Sometimes they mutilated corpses of their victims to avoid detection.[18] The corpses were then hidden or buried.[19]\n\nA leader of a gang was called jemadar.[20] Usage of military-style ranks such as jemadar and subedar among Thugs as well as reference to individual members as a \"private\", suggests that the organisation of their gangs had a military link.[21]\n\nThey used a jargon known as Ramasee to disguise their true intentions from their targets.[18] Although strangulation is one of their most-recognised methods of murder, they also used blades and poison.[22]\n\nThe thugs comprised both men who had inherited thuggee as a family vocation, as well as those who were forced to turn to it out of necessity.[23] The leadership of many of the groups tended to be hereditary with family members sometimes serving together in the same band. Such Thugs were known as aseel.[24] Many Thugs insisted, however, that novices were not taught Thuggee by their family but by others who were often more experienced Thugs, sometimes also called a guru.[25] While they usually kept their acts a secret, female thugs also existed and were called baronee in Ramasee, while an important male Thug was called baroo.[26]\n\nThey would often avoid killing children of victims and instead adopted them.[27] They sometimes tended to murder women and children to eliminate witnesses or in case they had substantial loot.[28] Some of the thugs avoided murdering victims they considered proscribed according to their beliefs and let other unscrupulous members commit the murder or were forced to let them by those who did not believe in their customs like the Muslim thugs.[29]\n\nHistory [ edit ] The earliest known reference to the Thugs as a band or fraternity, rather than ordinary thieves, is found in Ziau-d din Barni's History of Firoz Shah (written about 1356).[30] He narrated an incident of the sultan Jalal-ud-din Khalji having 1,000 arrested thugs being sent to Lakhnauti or Gaur:[31]\n\nIn the reign of that sultan [about 1290], some Thugs were taken in Delhi, and a man belonging to that fraternity was the means of about a thousand being captured. But not one of these did the sultan have killed. He gave orders for them to be put into boats and to be conveyed into the lower country, to the neighbourhood of Lakhnauti, where they were to be set free. The Thugs would thus have to dwell about Lakhnauti and would not trouble the neighbourhood of Delhi any more.\n\n'--'Sir HM Elliot, History of India, iii. 141\n\nSurdas, in his allegorical couplet, mentioned robbers called \"thags\" who lured a victim while also killing and looting his property. The Janamsakhis used the term thag to refer to a robber who used to lure pilgrims. Jean de Th(C)venot in his account referred to a band of robbers who used a \"certain Slip with a running noose\" to strangle their victims. John Fryer also mentions a similar method of strangling used by robbers from Surat whom he saw being given capital punishment by the Mughals in 1675. He mentioned that three of them were relatives, which Kim Wagner notices is similar to the Thugs who were thought to have engaged in this as a family profession. A decree issued by Aurangzeb in 1672 refers to a similar method and uses the term \"Phansigar\".[32]\n\nGuru Multhoo Byragee Jogee, a native of Ajmere aged 90, in jail (1840)\n\nMurdan Khan and gang from\n\nLucknow (1840)\n\nWatercolour (1837) by unknown artist of three Thugs strangling a traveller; one holds his feet, another his hands and a third tightens the ligature around his neck. Created in\n\nLucknow, based on descriptions from imprisoned Thug leaders (Dash, 2005)\n\nSketch by the same artist of a group of Thugs stabbing the eyes of murdered travellers before throwing the bodies into a well.\n\nThe garrote is often depicted as a weapon of the Thuggee.[33][34] Other evidences suggest that the Katar (dagger) was their personal status weapon, the Thuggee wore this weapon proudly across their chest. Early references to Thugs reported they committed their strangulation murders with nooses of rope or catgut, but later they adopted the use of a length of cloth that could be used as a sash or scarf, and thus more easily concealed.[35] This cloth is sometimes described as a rumÄl (head covering or kerchief), translated as \"yellow scarf\"; \"yellow\", in this case, may refer to a natural cream or khaki colour rather than bright yellow.\n\nThe Thug preference for strangulation might have originated in a quirk of the law under the Mughal Empire, which ruled most of India from the 1500s.[35] For a murderer to be sentenced to death, he or she must have shed the blood of their victim. Those who murdered but did not shed blood might face imprisonment, hard labor and paying a penalty'--but they would not risk execution.\n\nA poison called datura, derived from a plant in the Nightshade family, was sometimes used by Thugs to induce drowsiness or stupefaction, making strangulation easier.[35]\n\nThe \"River Thugs\" preyed upon people including Hindu pilgrims travelling using the Ganga river and became mostly active during the winter like their compatriots from Murnae, Bundelkhand and Awadh. Their dialect of Ramasee differed from the one used by their compatriots on land and used boats taken on lease from their builders or from a jemadar called Khuruck Baboo. Sleeman states that they tapped three times to give the signal to murder which they always committed during the day. To avoid detection of a corpse, they broke its back and threw it in the river to be eaten by crocodiles and only looted money or jewels.[36]\n\nBritish suppression [ edit ] William Henry Sleeman, superintendent of the Thuggee and Dacoity Department\n\nThe British found out about them in Southern India for the first time in 1807, while in North India they were discovered in 1809 with an effort to suppress them being carried out from 1809''1812.[37]\n\nAfter a dispute developed between the zamindar Tejun and the Thug Ghasee Ram in 1812, the latter took refuge with his family under another landlord called Laljee. Tejun in turn revealed the thugs of Sindouse to Nathaniel Halhed.[38] Thomas Perry, the magistrate of Etawah, assembled some soldiers of the East India Company under the command of Halheld in 1812 to suppress the Thugs.[39] Laljee and his forces including over 100 Thugs were defeated, with the village of Murnae, a headquarter of the Thugs, destroyed and burnt by the Company soldiers.[40] Laljee fled to Rampura and the southern banks of Sindh River but was caught by the Marathas who turned him over to the Company.[41][42]\n\nBritish authorities had occasionally captured and prosecuted Thugs, circulating information about these cases in newsletters or the journal Asiatick Researches of The Asiatic Society. However, Sleeman seems to have been the first to realize that information obtained from one group of stranglers might be used to track and identify other thugs in a different district. His first major breakthrough was the capture of \"Feringhea\" (also known as Syeed Amir Ali, Khuda Buksh, Deahuct Undun and Daviga Persaud[10]), who was persuaded to turn King's evidence. (Feringhea's story was the basis of the successful 1839 novel Confessions of a Thug). Feringhea brought Sleeman to a mass grave with a hundred bodies, told him the circumstances of the murders and named the Thugs who had committed them.[43]\n\nAfter initial investigations confirmed what Feringhea had said, Sleeman began an extensive campaign using profiling and intelligence. Sleeman was made superintendent of the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1835, an organ of the Indian government first established by the East India Company in 1830.[44] (Dacoity was a type of organized banditry, distinguished from Thugs most notably by its open practice and due to the fact that murder was not an intrinsic element of their modus operandi.) Sleeman developed elaborate intelligence techniques that pre-dated similar methods in Europe and the US by decades.[35]\n\nRecords were made in which the accused were given prisoner numbers, against which their names, residences, fellow thugs, and the criminal acts for which they were blamed were also noted.[citation needed ] Many thugs' names were similar; they often lacked surnames since the Thuggee naming convention was to use the names of their tribes, castes and job assignments in the gangs.[citation needed ] Accurate recording was also difficult because the thugs adopted many aliases, with both Muslim and Hindu thugs often posing as members of the other religion.[citation needed ] Per the Thug Ghulam Hussain, though Hindus and Muslims avoided eating together, such was not the case for drinking and smoking.[16][10]\n\nThe campaign relied heavily on captured Thugs who became informants. These informants were offered protection on the condition that they told everything that they knew. According to historian Mike Dash, who carefully examined the relevant documents in the UK archives, suspects were subject to bench trials before English judges. Though the trials were lacking by later standards (e.g., suspects were not allowed legal representation), they were conducted with care to protocols of the time. While most suspects were convicted, Dash notes that the courts genuinely seemed interested in finding the truth and rejected a minority of allegations due to mistaken identity or insufficient evidence. Even by later standards, Dash argues, the evidence of guilt for many Thugs was often overwhelming.[35]\n\nBecause they used boats and disposed of their victims in rivers,[45] the \"River Thugs\" were able to evade the British authorities for some time after their compatriots on land were suppressed.[citation needed ] They were ultimately betrayed to the authorities by one of their compatriots, from Awadh.[citation needed ] Forces under Sleeman's command hunted them down in 1836.[46]\n\nAftermath [ edit ] By the 1870s the Thug cult was essentially extinct, but the history of Thuggee led to the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) of 1871. Although the CTA was repealed at Indian independence, tribes considered criminal still exist in India.[47][48] The Thuggee and Dacoity Department remained in existence until 1904, when it was replaced by the Central Criminal Intelligence Department (CID).\n\nIn Following the Equator, Mark Twain wrote about an 1839 government report by William Henry Sleeman:[43]\n\nThere is one very striking thing which I wish to call attention to. You have surmised from the listed callings followed by the victims of the Thugs that nobody could travel the Indian roads unprotected and live to get through; that the Thugs respected no quality, no vocation, no religion, nobody; that they killed every unarmed man that came in their way. That is wholly true '-- with one reservation. In all the long file of Thug confessions an English traveler is mentioned but once'--and this is what the Thug says of the circumstance:\n\n\"He was on his way from Mhow to Bombay. We studiously avoided him. He proceeded next morning with a number of travellers who had sought his protection, and they took the road to Baroda.\"\n\nWe do not know who he was; he flits across the page of this rusty old book and disappears in the obscurity beyond; but he is an impressive figure, moving through that valley of death serene and unafraid, clothed in the might of the English name.\n\nWe have now followed the big official book through, and we understand what Thuggee was, what a bloody terror it was, what a desolating scourge it was. In 1830 the English found this cancerous organisation embedded in the vitals of the empire, doing its devastating work in secrecy, and assisted, protected, sheltered, and hidden by innumerable confederates'--big and little native chiefs, customs officers, village officials, and native police, all ready to lie for it, and the mass of the people, through fear, persistently pretending to know nothing about its doings; and this condition of things had existed for generations, and was formidable with the sanctions of age and old custom. If ever there was an unpromising task, if ever there was a hopeless task in the world, surely it was offered here'--the task of conquering Thuggee. But that little handful of English officials in India set their sturdy and confident grip upon it, and ripped it out, root and branch! How modest do Captain Vallancey's words sound now, when we read them again, knowing what we know:\n\n\"The day that sees this far-spread evil completely eradicated from India, and known only in name, will greatly tend to immortalise British rule in the East.\"\n\nIt would be hard to word a claim more modestly than that for this most noble work.\n\n'--'Chapter xlvi, conclusion\n\nThug view [ edit ] The Thugs Worshipping Kalee, around 1850\n\n[49]Although Thugs trace their origins back to Kali's fabled battle against Raktabija, their foundation is closer to tantric[disambiguation needed ] cults which depart from Vedic versions and Puranic narrations. Thugs considered themselves to be the children of Kali, having been created from her sweat.[50] However, many of the Thugs who were captured and convicted by the British were Muslims,[51] perhaps up to a third.[35]\n\nAccording to colonial sources, Thugs believed that they played a positive role in saving human lives. Without the Thugs' sacred service, Kali might destroy all mankind:\n\n\"It is God who kills, but Bhowanee has [a] name for it.\"\"God is all in all, for good and evil.\"\"God has appointed blood for [Bhowanee's] food, saying 'khoon tum khao': feed thou upon blood. In my opinion it is very bad, but what can she do, being ordered to subsist upon blood!\"\"Bhowanee is happy and more so in proportion to the blood that is shed.\"[52]The Muslim thugs while retaining their monotheistic faith, had functionalised Bhavani for Thuggee and she was syncretised as a spirit subordinate to Allah. A Muslim thug caught by Sleeman stated \"In my heart, I take the name of God, when I strangle a man '' saying \"thou God and ruler!\" \"Alla, toomee Malik!\" I do not pray to Bhowanee, but I worship her.\" Other Muslim thugs who had agreed to testify for Sleeman, stated they had assimilated Bhavani with Islamic prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatimah who killed Raktabija and started the practice of Thuggee.[53]\n\nAccording to historian Mike Dash, the Thugs had no religious motive to kill. When religious elements were present among Thugs, their beliefs, in principle, were little different from the religious beliefs of many others who lived on the Indian subcontinent and attributed their success or failure to supernatural powers: \"Indeed all of the Thugs's legends which concerned the goddess [Kali] featured exactly the cautionary notes which are typically found in folklore.\"[35]\n\nDonald Friell McLeod who led the campaign against them in the Rajputana Agency, recorded the traditions of their origins. According to them, they were originally Muslims and were taught Thugee by the deity Devi or Bhavani. They then joined the Lodha people and migrated to Delhi where 84 tribes which were a part of all the criminal clans of India also became a part of the Thugs. A physician who belonged to these 84 tribes gained prominence after curing a royal elephant and was murdered by other Thugs. A schism developed and they left Delhi, which in turn led to the origin of seven Muslim tribes. According to McLeod, these tribes were named Bhyns, Bursot, Kachinee, Hutar, Kathur Gugra, Behleem and Ganoo. According to him, the thugs from Delhi were separated into more than 12 \"classes\".[54]\n\nThe earliest recorded traditions about the origins of the Thugs date back to 1760. Based on genealogies which were recounted by some Thugs, historian Mike Dash stated that the origin of the Thuggee can be dated back to the second half of the 17th century. A general consensus among them was that they originated in Delhi. The thug Gholam Hossyn who was caught in early 1800s stated that his accomplices believed that Thugs had existed since the time of Alexander the Great. Another tradition among Thugs who lived in the early 1800s stated that they had lived in Delhi till the time of Akbar and consisted of seven great Muslim clans, though they had Hindu names, during the period. After one of them killed a favoured slave of Akbar, they left Delhi for other regions in order to avoid being targeted by the emperor.[5] A Brahmin thug who was interrogated by Sleeman referred to the Muslim thugs as \"Kunjurs\" or Kanjars though another Thug denied this.[7]\n\nKim Wagner asserts that we can analyse their traditions about events after their flight from Delhi \"to a much greater advantage\". A tradition which was recounted by a captive Thug stated that the Thugs had originally tried to settle in Agra and they later settled in Akoopore in the Doab region. However, they had to flee to Himmutpur and later they fled to Parihara after their kings started demanding a larger share of the loot. In turn the original Muslim Thugs helped spread Thuggee amongst other groups like the Brahmins, Rajputs, Hindus, the Lodhi people and the Ahir people.[55]\n\nOne thug stated that some of the ancestors of the Thugs were forced to disguise themselves as Khunjurs while they were fleeing Delhi but they were high-caste Muslims. He, however, stated that their claimed descent may be wrong and some of them may be partially descended from poor people who worked in the Mughal army's camps. However, their claim that membership in the Thugs' clans was closed to outsiders is contradicted by the fact that people of all backgrounds were allowed to join them by the early 19th century according to available evidence.[8]\n\nThey considered it sinful to kill women, fakirs, bards, musicians and dancers.[56] Like the ancient Hindu texts which distinguished robbery from the murder of Brahmans, women or children as violent crimes, many Thugs considered it taboo to kill people who belonged to such categories.[57] Those who worked in lowly professions, the diseased and disabled were also forbidden as victims based on their folk belief.[58] The thugs who broke these rules of the fraternity were often believed to have been targeted by divine punishment and their manner of death was thought to depend upon the rules they broke.[59]\n\nSects [ edit ] The East India Company officers since the time of Thomas Perry, who was appointed to Etawah in 1811, came to understand that there were many Thug groups and they all viewed themselves to be different than the other groups.[60]\n\nThe Thug sects were mostly identified based on their habitat, but also based on their professions. The sect called Jamuldahee was named so because its members lived along the Yamuna river, they hailed from the Doab and Awadh regions. Another stated origin is that their ancestor was the Thug Jumulud Deen. The Telinganie originated from Telangana, Arcottees from Arcot and Beraries from Berar. The Lodaha sect, mostly concentrated in Bihar, were caravaneers named after the lodha or load they carried and according to a Thug from the Doab, originated from the same ancestors of his clan. The Lodahas were prevalent in the region around Nepal in Bihar and Bengal during the tenure of Perry and originally hailed from Awadh which they left around 1700. A Deccan Thug stated that the \"Hindu Thugs of Talghat\", located around the Krishna River, didn't marry with the Telinganies whom they considered to be descendants of lower classes as a result of their professions.[61][62] The Telinganie sect were also disparagingly called Handeewuls (from handi) due to their eating habits.[63]\n\nThe Pungoo or Bungoo of Bengal derived their name from the region, with the Lodhees or Lodaha also present. The Motheea sect of Rampur-Purnia region was from a caste of weavers and their name derived from the practice of giving \"handful\" (muhti) of the spoils to the head. In the Uttar Pradesh the sects were: the Korkureeas from Kohrur, Agureeas of Agra, Jumaldahees, Lodhees and Tundals. The Multaneea were from Multan. In Madhya Pradesh the sects were: Bangureeas or Banjaras, Balheems or Bulheems, Khokhureeas and Soopurreeas of Sheopur. In modern Rajasthan, the sects were Guguras whose name derives from river Ghaggar and Sooseeas who were part of the Dhanuk clan. The Dhoulanee sect existed in modern-day Maharashtra. The Duckunies of Deccan were from Munirabad and Kurnaketies from Carnatic region. Another sect was Kathurs whose name derives from a bowl called kathota, based on a tradition of a man who held it during celebrations by Thugs. The Qulundera sect's name was derived from the Muslim saints called qalandar. There were also Jogee thugs who were divided into twelve sub-groups.[64]\n\nAccording to Feringheea, the Brahmins of Tehngoor village of Parihar were taught the Thuggee after they accompanied the kings of Meos to Delhi and later helped in spreading it in the region around Murnae. He also states that two of his ancestors who had settled and intermarried with Brahmins of Murnae about seven generations ago, which led to the introduction of Thuggee in the area. A Thug hailing from Shikohabad whilst talking of his clan's origin recounted to Perry a tradition that the Munhars were influenced to take up Thuggee after witnessing the immense plunder acquired by Afghans, Mewatties and the Sheikhs.[65]\n\nSleeman in 1839 identified a band called \"Meypunnaists\" who he stated abducted children to sell them further. Another band called \"Tashmabazes\" who utilised methods introduced by a British soldier deployed at Kanpur in 1802 were also identified by him.[66] The group called \"River Thugs\" were based deep in the South Bengal region.[46]\n\nColonial British view [ edit ] The British view of the Thuggee was merely as a form of ritual murder by Kali-worshippers. Sleeman's view of it as an aberrant faith was based on the contemporary British view of Hinduism as a despicable and immoral faith of idol worship.[67] R. C. Sherwood in Asiatick Resarches published in 1820 traces this phenomenon back to the Muslim conquests of India and suggested links to Hindu mythology.[68] Charles Trevelyan however instead of seeing them as a deviant sect, considered them to be representatives of the \"essence\" of Hinduism which he considered as \"evil\" and \"false\".[69] Sleeman considered some Brahmins acted as intelligence providers to Thugs, claiming that they profited from Thuggee and directed it.[70]\n\nKali's worship by thugs, both Muslims and Hindus, was emphasised by the British. McLeod commented, \"It is a notable fact that not only amongst the Thugs, but in an especial manner among all lawless fraternities, and to a certain extent throughout the uneducated population of Central India, the Mussulmans vie with the Hindus in a devotion of this sanguinary deity (Devi or Bhavani) far exceeding that they pay to any other.\"[71] David Ochterlony blamed the Pindaris for the rise of Thuggee while Sleeman blamed it on Indian rulers dismissing their armies which took away the jobs of many soldiers.[9] Based on Sleeman's writings about the Thugs, Robert Vane Russell claimed that most of them were Kanjars. He viewed the Muslim Kanjars as having recently converted to Islam.[7]\n\nAlexander Cunningham in 1882 had commented on Hiouen-Thsang's remarks about \"people who visited Kahalgaon forgot to leave it\", stating that the actual reason might have been different than what the monk meant and made an analogy of it with Kahalgaon's later reputation as a place frequented by the \"River Thugs\".[31]\n\nDispute and skepticism [ edit ] Contemporary scholars are increasingly skeptical of the \"thuggee\" concept, and have questioned the existence of such a phenomenon.[12][13] The representation of Thuggee by British colonizer thuggee is said by some critics to be full of inconsistencies and exaggerations; however the more radical critics in this camp have themselves been criticized for overly focusing on the British perception of thuggee rather than on the historical accuracy of primary source documents.[72] Numerous historians have described \"thuggee\" as basically the invention of the British colonial regime.[73]\n\nMartine van Woerkens of cole Pratique des Hautes tudes writes that evidence for a Thug cult in the 19th century was the product of \"colonial imaginings\", arising from British fear of the little-known interior of India, as well as limited understanding of the religious and social practices of its inhabitants.[74]\n\nCynthia Ann Humes states that the testimony of most of the thugs captured by Sleeman does not support his view of priests profiting from and directing the Thugs. She adds that the Islamic idea of fate or Iqbal was more commonly invoked during Thuggee acts, while invoking the Hindu Bhavani was rare.[70]\n\nHistorian Kim Wagner views the policies of East India Company in relation to the dismissal of armies of the conquered Indian kingdoms as being responsible for the development of Thuggee. Roaming bands of freelance soldiers had often joined one kingdom or another during the pre-British era, with the main income of many armies coming from plunder. After being dismissed from military service, they turned to robbery as a means of subsistence.[9] He also contested whether the thugs mentioned by Firuz Shah Tughlaq's biography were actually the same Thugs the British authorities fought against.[75]\n\nSagnik Bhattacharya agrees with the skeptics and claims the thug-phenomenon to be nothing but a manifestation of the fear of the Unknown that dawned on the British Raj at the thought of being alone in the wilderness of Central India. Using literary and legal sources, he has connected the 'information panic' of the thug-phenomenon to the limitations of British demographic models that fell short of truly capturing the ethnic diversity of India. He calls the thug panic of the 1830s'--the Raj's angst at realizing its own ignorance of local society.[76]\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ] Sikh Guru Nanak's Janamsakhis describes an encounter with a Thug Sheikh Sajjan[77]The 1839 novel Confessions of a Thug by Philip Meadows Taylor is based on the Thuggee cult, revolving around a fictional Thug who is named Ameer[78] Ali. The novel popularized the word \"thug\" in the English language.Several of Emilio Salgari's Sandokan novels describe a struggle with the Thugs. The first of them '' I misteri della jungla nera (1887) '' was originally published with the title Gli strangolatori del Gange ('The stranglers of the Ganges').The 1931 crime novel The Case of the Frightened Lady by Edgar Wallace makes an indirect reference to the Thuggee murders by featuring \"Indian scarves\" which are used as murder weapons, as do its 1940 and 1963 West German film adaptations.The 1939 film Gunga Din features British soldiers' conflict with a resurgent sect of Thuggee cultists.The Thuggees and their method of killing are made reference to in the 1945 film Hangover Square.Sympathy For The Devil (1968), a song by The Rolling Stones, features the lyrics: \"And I laid traps for the troubadors / Who get killed before they reach Bombay\" possibly referring to the murder of Tibetan musicians by Thuggee cultists.The Stranglers of Bombay (1959), is a film which is centered around a lone British officer who investigates and uncovers the doings of the Thuggee cult.Help! (1965), a film which revolves around The Beatles' encounters with an Eastern Cult, is thought to parody the Thuggee.Sunghursh (1968), an Indian Bollywood film, gives a fictionalized account of a thug who tries not to join his family business which is ThuggeeThe Deceivers (1988) is an adventure film about the murderous Thugs of India which is based on the 1952 John Masters novel with the same name.

For the 2019 song by DaBaby, see\n\nSuge (song).\n\nAmerican music executive and convicted felon\n\nMarion Hugh \"Suge\" Knight Jr. (; born April 19, 1965)[1] is an American former music executive who, as cofounder and CEO of Death Row Records, was a central figure in gangsta rap's catapult to massive commercialization.[2] This feat is attributed to the record label's first two album releases: Dr. Dre's The Chronic in 1992 and Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle in 1993.[2] \"It was Knight's executive muscle that helped Snoop\"'--implicated in a 1993 homicide'--\"avoid jail a few years after its release\".[3]\n\nDuring 1995, Tupac Shakur began a prison sentence of up to four and half years. Knight struck a deal with him that in October, paying his bail, freed him from prison'--pending his conviction's appeal'--while signing him to Deathrow Records. In 1996, the label released 2Pac's greatest commercial success, All Eyez on Me. Yet that September, after departing a Mike Tyson boxing match in Las Vegas, a group that included Knight and Shakur assaulted Orlando Anderson, a Southside Compton Crips gang member. Three hours later someone shot into the car that Knight was driving and fatally wounded Shakur, and Anderson has since become the prime suspect.\n\nIn the fallout from and the aftermath of Shakur's death, both Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg left Deathrow Records. Rapidly, the label declined, and it was soon eclipsed. Meanwhile, allegations mounted that Knight, beyond employing gang members, had often plied intimidation and violence in his business dealings. From the late 1990s into the early 2000s, Knight spent a few years incarcerated for assault convictions and associated violations of probation and parole. In September 2018, upon pleading no contest to voluntary manslaughter in a fatal 2015 hit-and-run, Knight was sentenced to 28 years in prison.[4][5] He is scheduled to become eligible for parole in October 2037.[6]\n\nEarly life [ edit ] Marion Hugh Knight Jr. was born in Compton, California, the son of Maxine (n(C)e Dikemen) and Marion Knight Sr.[7] His name Suge (pronounced Shoog) derives from \"Sugar Bear\", a childhood nickname.[8] He attended Lynwood High School in nearby Lynwood, where he was a football and track star. He graduated in 1983.\n\n[ edit ] College [ edit ] From 1983 to 1985, he attended and played football at El Camino College.[9] In 1985, he transferred to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and played there for two years.[10]\n\nProfessional [ edit ] Knight went undrafted in the 1987 NFL Draft, but was invited to the Los Angeles Rams training camp. He was cut by the Rams during camp, but he became a replacement player during the 1987 NFL Players Strike, and played two games for the Rams.[11]\n\nCareer beginnings [ edit ] After the NFL, Knight found work as a concert promoter and a bodyguard for celebrities including Bobby Brown. In 1989, Knight formed his own music publishing company. His first big profit in the business came when Vanilla Ice (Robert Van Winkle) agreed to sign over royalties from his smash hit \"Ice Ice Baby\", because the song included material allegedly written by Knight's client Mario Johnson. Knight and his bodyguards confronted Van Winkle several times. On one occasion, Knight entered Van Winkle's hotel room and allegedly dangled him by his ankles off the balcony. Van Winkle said only that Knight threatened to throw him off the balcony; the claim was resolved in court.[9]\n\nKnight next formed an artist management company and signed prominent West Coast hip hop artists DJ Quik and The D.O.C. Through the latter, he met several members of the seminal gangsta rap group N.W.A.\n\nDeath Row Records [ edit ] Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. wanted to leave both N.W.A and their label, Ruthless Records, run by Eazy-E, another member of N.W.A. According to N.W.A's manager Jerry Heller, Knight and his henchmen threatened Heller and Eazy-E with lead pipes and baseball bats to make them release Dre, The D.O.C., and Michel'le from their contracts.[12] Ultimately, Dre and D.O.C. co-founded Death Row Records in 1991 with Knight, who vowed to make it \"the Motown of the '90s\".\n\nInitially, Knight fulfilled his ambitions: he secured a distribution deal with Interscope, and Dre's 1992 solo debut album, The Chronic, went on to Triple Platinum status in the United States by the end of 1993.[13] It also made a career for Dre's prot(C)g(C), Snoop Dogg, whose own debut album Doggystyle obtained a Quadruple Platinum certification in the United States in 1994.[14]\n\nMeanwhile, Death Row had begun a public feud with 2 Live Crew's Luther Campbell, and when Knight traveled to Miami for a hip-hop convention in 1993, he was apparently seen openly carrying a stolen gun. The following year, he opened a private, by-appointment-only nightclub in Las Vegas called Club 662, so named because the numbers spelled out MOB on telephone keypads, MOB standing for Member of Bloods. In 1995, he ran afoul of activist C. Delores Tucker, whose criticism of Death Row's glamorization of the \"gangsta\" lifestyle may have helped scuttle a lucrative deal with Time Warner.[15]\n\nTupac Shakur, MC Hammer, Dr. Dre, and the Death Row Label [ edit ] Knight's feud with East Coast entrepreneur Sean Combs (\"Puff Daddy\") progressed when Knight insulted the Bad Boy label founder on air at the Source Awards in August 1995. Openly critical of Combs's tendency of ad-libbing on his artists' songs and dancing in their videos, Knight announced to the audience, \"Anyone out there who wanna be a recording artist and wanna stay a star, and don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the records, dancing, come to Death Row.\"\n\nThe same year, Knight offered to post bail ( US$1.4 million ) for Tupac Shakur if the rapper agreed to sign with Death Row. Shakur agreed, setting the stage for his 1996 double album All Eyez on Me and The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory.\n\nM.C. Hammer's relationship with Suge Knight dates back to 1988. With the success of Hammer's 1994 album, The Funky Headhunter (featuring Tha Dogg Pound), Hammer signed with Death Row Records by 1995, along with Snoop Dogg and his close friend, Tupac.[16] The label did not release the album of Hammer's music (titled Too Tight) while he had a career with them, although he did release versions of some tracks on his next album.[17][18] However, Hammer did record tracks with Shakur and others, most notably the song \"Too Late Playa\" (along with Big Daddy Kane and Danny Boy).[19] After the death of Shakur in 1996, Hammer left the record company.[20] He later explained his concern about this circumstance in an interview on Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) since he was in Las Vegas with Tupac the night of his death.[21] Hammer released 2Pac's \"Unconditional Love\", on his Family Affair album, in 1998. The friendships between Hammer (played by Romany Malco), Tupac (played by Lamont Bentley) and Suge (played by Anthony Norris) were depicted in the television film, Too Legit: The MC Hammer Story (airing on VH1 in 2001).\n\nThe label shrank when Dr. Dre, frustrated with the company's increasingly thuggish reputation and Knight's violent inclinations, decided to leave and form his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. A stream of Dre-dissing records followed.\n\nMurders of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls: Theories accusing Knight [ edit ] Though never charged by any prosecutor for any involvement, Suge Knight has been the subject of theories in popular culture about the murder of two well-known rap artists. Tupac Shakur was shot four times in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 7, 1996, and died six days later on September 13. When Shakur's East Coast rival, The Notorious B.I.G. (AKA Biggie Smalls), was murdered in a similar drive-by shooting in Los Angeles, California on March 9, 1997, speculation arose that Knight was involved and that Biggie's death was a revenge killing.[22] Former Death Row artists, including Snoop Dogg, also later accused Knight of being involved in Tupac's murder.[23]\n\nA theory accusing Suge Knight in the deaths of both Biggie and Tupac was that of ex-detective Russell Poole, who conjectured that Knight had Tupac killed before he could part ways with Knight's label and then conspired to kill Biggie to divert attention from himself in the Tupac case.[24] The Biggie murder theory implicated Suge Knight, a rogue cop, and a mortgage broker named Amir Muhammad (who was never a police suspect) along with the chief of police and the LAPD in a conspiracy to murder and cover up the murder of Biggie. The Biggie theory formed the basis of a US$500 million lawsuit by his family, the Wallaces, against the city of Los Angeles. A key source for Poole's theory was Kevin Hackie. Hackie had implicated Suge Knight and David Mack. Hackie, a former Death Row associate, said that he had knowledge of involvement between Suge Knight and David Mack and other LAPD officers. His information was used by the Wallace family in their suit against the city of L.A. for Biggie's death. But Hackie later told a Los Angeles Times reporter Chuck Philips that the Wallace attorneys had altered his declarations.[25] The suit brought by the Wallace family against the city of L.A. based on the Russell Poole theory was dismissed in 2010.\n\nA 2005 Los Angeles Times article claimed that another source for the theory of Biggie's murder implicating Amir Muhammad, David Mack, Suge Knight and the LAPD was a schizophrenic man known as \"Psycho Mike\" who later confessed to hearsay and memory lapses and falsely identifying Muhammad.[26] John Cook of Brill's Content noted that Philips' article \"demolished\"[27] the Poole-Sullvan theory of Biggie's murder.\n\nAround the same time, Philips wrote an L.A. Times two-part series titled \"Who Killed Tupac Shakur?\" into the murder of Shakur and events surrounding it based on police affidavits, court documents and interviews.[28][29]\n\nThe L.A. Times story indicated that \"the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier. Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom Shakur had attacked, fired the fatal shots. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect after questioning him once briefly. He was later killed in what police said was an unrelated gang shooting.\"[28] The article implicated East Coast music figures, including Christopher \"Biggie Smalls\" Wallace, Shakur's nemesis at the time, alleging that he paid for the gun.[28] Before their own deaths, Smalls, his family and Anderson denied any role in Shakur's murder. Biggie's family[30] produced documents purporting to show that the rapper was in New York and New Jersey at the time. The New York Times called the documents inconclusive stating:\n\nThe pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the afternoon Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session, was In and out/sat around and laid down a ref, shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We would have heard about it, Mr. Alfred said.[31]\n\nSoon after the article was published, The Smoking Gun revealed that Philips' FBI documents were fake.\n\nMark Duvoisin, an editor at the L.A. Times, wrote in an opinion piece in Rolling Stone that Philips' account had withstood attacks to its credibility.[32]\n\nHowever, the L.A. Times printed a full retraction of the two-part series and released Philips shortly thereafter during a wave of layoffs.[33]\n\nIn Tupac Shakur: Before I Wake, a documentary by Tupac Shakur's bodyguard, he and Cathy Scott, author of The Killing of Tupac Shakur and The Murder of Biggie Smalls, said that Knight would not have placed himself in the path of bullets he knew were coming. On her website Archived Letters Scott responds to a reader of her book stating that she felt there was never evidence to link Knight to Tupac's murder. Scott also told CNN, \"That theory doesn't even add up. 'Open fire on my car, but try not to hit me?'\"[34]\n\nA 2006 law-enforcement task force probe into Biggie Smalls' murder, which included then-LAPD Detective Greg Kading, included the murder of Shakur. In his 2011 self-published book, Murder Rap,[35] Kading wrote that Duane \"Keefe D\" Davis, a member of the \"Crips\" street gang, gave a confession years later claiming he rode in the car used in the Las Vegas shooting of Shakur.[22][36] The Crips claimed they had been offered a million dollars by associates of Bad Boy records to kill Shakur. Kading, who named Sean Combs as having been involved in the conspiracy, also wrote that a bounty was offered for Suge Knight's murder.[22]\n\nWhile in Las Vegas, Kading's book claims, Davis and fellow Crips members crossed paths with a BMW carrying Knight and Shakur.[28] The fatal shots were fired by Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, who sat on the side of the car closest to the BMW.\n\nKading alleged that Knight hired Wardel \"Pouchie\" Fouse to kill Sean Combs' most valuable star, Biggie Smalls, a murder done following a party at the Peterson Automotive Museum. Pouchie later survived a murder attempt but died in a drive-by shooting a year after the first attack. Charges were never brought against Fouse or Knight and the task force disbanded for reasons of \"internal affairs.\"[35]\n\nAfter Shakur's death and the release of Tha Doggfather, Snoop Dogg openly criticized Knight for the murder of Shakur and left the label in 1998.[37] He signed with Master P's No Limit Records and then forming his own record label, Doggystyle Records. In 2002, Snoop released the song \"Pimp Slapp'd\", in which he repudiated Knight and Death Row. In 2006, Snoop again attacked Knight verbally.[38] Knight responded, stating that Snoop was a \"police informer\" who \"never goes to jail\".[39]\n\nEnd of Death Row Records [ edit ] On April 4, 2006, Knight filed bankruptcy due to civil litigation against him in which Lydia Harris claimed to have been cheated out of a 50% stake in Death Row Records. Prior to filing, Knight had been ordered to pay US$107 million to Harris.[citation needed ] Under questioning by creditors, he denied having money tucked away in foreign countries or in an African company that deals in diamonds and gold. Bankruptcy documents filed showed Knight had no income from employment or operation of a business. According to financial records, his bank account contained just US$12 , and he owned clothing worth US$1,000 , furniture and appliances valued at US$2,000 , and jewelry worth US$25,000 . He also testified that the last time he had checked the label's financial records was at least 10 years prior. Knight's lawyer said that his client was still \"at the helm\" of Death Row and had been working on securing distribution deals for the label's catalog. Harris told reporters she had received a US$1 million payment but had not agreed to settle the matter. \"I'm telling you, I didn't do a settlement for US$1 million . That's ridiculous. Let's keep it real,\" she said.[40]\n\nOn July 7, 2006, the federal judge, Ellen Carroll, ordered a bankruptcy trustee takeover of Suge Knight's Death Row Records, saying the record label had undergone a gross amount of mismanagement.[41]\n\nHe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,[42] which allows a company to continue business operations while restructuring. Death Row was being operated by Neilson during the bankruptcy proceedings, while Knight oversaw his bankruptcy estate as a debtor in possession.[43]\n\nIn June 2007, he placed his 7 bedroom, 9½ bath home in Malibu, California on the market for US$6.2 million as part of his \"financial makeover\". The mansion was finally sold in December 2008 in bankruptcy court for US$4.56 million .[44]\n\nIn June 2008, Death Row Records was put up for auction in Bankruptcy Court. The winning bid went to New York-based company Global Music Group,[45] which confirmed it had purchased the firm in a statement to the Associated Press news agency. Global Music Group failed to secure funding and the Death Row Records catalog eventually went to Wideawake Entertainment.\n\nOn January 25, 2009, an auction was held for everything found in the Death Row Records office after the company filed for bankruptcy, including some of Knight's personal items. Of note was the Death Row Records electric chair which sold for US$2,500 . Some of Knight's personal items appeared in an auction during the debut episode of A&E's Storage Wars,[46] and a vault full of items (including a coat) was purchased by featured buyer Barry Weiss.[47]\n\nNew Death Row Records [ edit ] After news of his son's \"New\" Death Row Records was released with reports of Tupac still alive, Knight confirmed that new music would be released by the artist soon.[48][49]\n\nPersonal and legal troubles [ edit ] 1995 convictions [ edit ] In a 1995 federal case, Knight pleaded no contest and was sentenced to five years' probation for assaulting two rappers in the summer of 1992 at a Hollywood recording studio.[50]\n\n1996 probation violation leading to incarceration [ edit ] On October 22, 1996, Knight was sent to jail pending a hearing on the probation violation that happened on September 7, 1996 when Suge Knight and his Death Row entourage including Tupac Shakur attacked Orlando Anderson, a crips gang member. Suge Knight was then sentenced to nine years in prison on February 28, 1997 for the probation violation[51] but was granted early release and was let out on August 6, 2001.[52][53]\n\n2003 conviction and incarceration [ edit ] In 2003, Knight was sent to prison again for violating parole when he struck a parking lot attendant.[54] Death Row Records' income rapidly declined during Knight's recurrent incarceration.\n\nIn 2006, Knight was engaged in another dispute with former friend and ex-associate Snoop Dogg after Snoop insulted him in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine.[38][55]\n\n2008 altercation [ edit ] On May 10, 2008, Knight was involved in an altercation involving a monetary dispute outside of a nightclub (\"Shag\") in Hollywood. He was unconscious for three minutes. At the hospital, he did not cooperate with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).[56][57]\n\n2008 bankruptcy [ edit ] As part of an October 30, 2008, bankruptcy claim, Knight also filed a lawsuit against Kanye West and his associates. The lawsuit concerns an August 2005 shooting at West's pre-Video Music Awards party, where Knight was wounded by a gunshot to the upper leg.[58][59]\n\n2009 altercation [ edit ] In February 2009, Knight was taken to Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn to be treated for face injuries he received during an altercation at a private party in the W Scottsdale Hotel, where Knight was reportedly punched.[60]\n\n2012 arrest [ edit ] On February 8, 2012, Knight was arrested in Las Vegas, after police found cannabis in his car and several warrants for prior traffic violations.[53]\n\n2014 shooting [ edit ] On August 24, 2014, Knight was shot at a pre-Video Music Awards party hosted by Chris Brown at a West Hollywood Sunset Strip nightclub (\"1OAK\"). Although shot six times, he was able to walk from the venue to an ambulance. His injuries required surgery.[61] It is reported by investigators that evidence from closed circuit television (CCTV) footage showed that Knight was the intended target of the shooting.[62] Knight was released from the hospital on August 27. Friend Keith Middlebrook told the New York Daily News that Knight returned home with the intentions to \"heal up in a few days and be stronger than ever\".[63]\n\nKnight refused to cooperate with law enforcement on the matter.[64] Jeezy later claimed on the Breakfast Club that he would have been shot had he not been pushed out of the way just prior to the shots.[65]\n\nProsecution on charges of robbery (2014''present) [ edit ] On October 29, 2014, Knight and comedian Katt Williams were both arrested and charged with second-degree robbery in connection with an alleged theft of a camera from a paparazzi photographer the previous month in Beverly Hills, California.[66][67] While in jail, doctors found a blood clot in Knight's lung.[68] Both Knight and Williams pleaded not guilty to robbery. In 2016, the robbery trial was delayed until the resolution of the unrelated murder trial.[66]\n\nProsecution on charges of voluntary manslaughter (2015''2017) [ edit ] On January 29, 2015, Knight crashed his car into two men, killing Terry Carter (his friend and co-founder of Heavyweight Records) and fled the scene in Compton, California.[69][70][71][72] The second victim, filmmaker Cle Sloan, suffered a mangled foot and head injuries.[73][74] Witnesses claimed Knight followed the men to a burger stand parking lot after an argument on the Straight Outta Compton film set, and that the collision looked intentional.[75] Security footage video showed Knight running over both men. Knight claimed he acted in self-defense.[76]\n\nIn March 2015, Knight was hospitalized after he told a judge that he was suffering from blindness and other complications. Knight fired attorneys handling his murder case and said he was receiving inadequate medical treatment while in custody.[77] The same month, a court set bail for his release for US$25 million . Knight collapsed in court shortly after the bail setting was announced.[78] On April 16, 2015, Knight's bail was reduced to US$10 million .[79][80] In July 2015, Knight's lawyer claimed that Knight might have a brain tumor[81] on the same day that Knight's request for lower bail was refused.[82] In January 2016, Knight changed counsel in his murder trial for a fourth time.[83][84] In May 2016, three attorneys replaced the two hired earlier in the year.[85] In July 2016, the judge denied Knight's motion to reveal the identities of several key prosecution witnesses, citing Knight's long history of violence.[86] Knight became emotional after the ruling, stating that because of his health problems, he will die in jail.[87] In March 2017, Knight was hospitalized after suffering from blood clots, a condition that has been affecting him for two years.[88] Knight's hospitalization delayed the trial[89] to September 2018.[90] When September arrived, Knight pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter.[91][92] The judge sentenced Knight to 28 years in prison.[93] As of December 2018, Knight is incarcerated at RJ Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.[94]\n\nProsecution on charges of threatening death (2017) [ edit ] In August 2017, a grand jury indicted Knight on charges of \"threatening death or bodily injury\" for sending threatening text messages to F. Gary Gray, the director of Straight Outta Compton, on August 8, 2017. Knight pleaded not guilty to the charge,[95] and the charge was dropped as part of Knight's plea agreement in the death of Terry Carter.[96]\n\nBiographical portrayals in film [ edit ] Documentary film [ edit ] American Dream/American Knightmare, a documentary by Antoine Fuqua featuring interviews conducted with Knight in 2011 and 2012, was broadcast on Showtime on December 21, 2018.\n\nReferences [ edit ] ^ \"Suge Knight\".
