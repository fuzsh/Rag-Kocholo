        "text": "Born. To Randolph Apperson (“Randy”) Hearst, 23, youngest (with twin brother David Whitmire) of William Randolph Hearst’s five sons, assistant publisher of his father’s Atlanta Georgian, and Catherine Wood Campbell Hearst, 21: their first child, a daughter, Hearst’s fifth grandchild. Weight: 5½ lbs. Name: Catherine Millicent.\n\nMarriage annulled. Irving Lahrheim (Bert Lahr), adenoidal funnyman; and Mercedes Delpino Lahrheim, his former vaudeville partner; after ten years; in White Plains, N. Y. Three doctors testified that Mrs. Lahrheim had been insane for five years.\n\nDied. Dr. Kálmán Darányi de Pusztaszentgyörgy és Tetétlen, 53, onetime (1936-38) Premier of Hungary; after long illness; in Budapest. A pro-Habsburg monarchist, K࣋mán Darányi squelched a Nazi putsch in 1937, lost prestige when he swallowed Naziism after Germany swallowed Austria.\n\nDied. Adolphe Max, 70, Burgomaster for 30 years of Brussels, last of Belgium’s three great heroes of World War I (the others: King Albert, Cardinal Mercier); in Brussels. Great & humane bachelor Burgomaster Max protected his people as best he could when German troops occupied Brussels and this time let no one doubt that his sympathies were still strongly with the Allies.\n\nDied. Opie Read, 86, homespinning Tennessee wit, last of the Mark Twain school, “greatest literary shortstop of his time”; of old age; in Chicago, Ill. Huge, gangling Opie Read wrote 55 books, edited the once famed humorous paper, The Arkansas Traveler. Like Oklahoma Wit Will Rogers, he belittled his own peculiarities by exaggerating those of others. Example: When a relative entered politics, said towering Opie Read: “He was so big that they didn’t put him on a stump. They dug a hole for him to stand in.”\n\nDied. Tolbert Hatfield, 89, justice of the peace, one of the clansmen who survived the famed Hatfield-McCoy feud; in bed, of pneumonia; in Ransom, Ky.\n\nDied. Major John Roy Lynch, 92, pre-Civil War slave, made major of the U. S. Volunteers in the Spanish-American War by President McKinley, onetime Speaker of the House in Mississippi, three times a U. S. Congressman; in Chicago, Ill.\n\nDied. Roswell Keyes Colcord, 100, oldest ex-Governor (Nevada, 1890-94) in the U. S.; in Carson City, Nev. Just before his 100th birthday he remarked: “I have never said or done anything worthy of boasting about.” Of one thing he might have boasted about, his age, he said: “I have lived 20 years longer than any man should.”"
