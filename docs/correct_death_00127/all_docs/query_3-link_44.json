        "text": "When I first visited Hearst Castle sometime in 2013, it was an captivating experience. I was in awe of the architecture of the castle, the rooms and its rich history. The thing that stood out the most was the Neptune Pool. I loved the Roman influences of the columns and statues and the pool itself looked so inviting. However, no one was allowed to get too close, and we certainly weren’t allowed to take a dip. Bummer.\n\nI love pools. As a matter of fact, when I’m looking to book a hotel, if I see that it doesn’t have a nice pool, I will bypass it, even if I’m not planning to swim. I guess I’m a bit of a pool snob. I’d rather call myself a pool aficionado. Some of my favorite pools are in Las Vegas at the Bellagio. They have several and what I love the most is the Roman architecture displayed throughout the grounds. It makes me feel like I’m on vacation in Italy.\n\nOf all the pools I’ve had the pleasure of swimming in, the Neptune Pool at Hearst Castle is hands down the best for more reasons than its stunning Roman architecture. Hearst Castle was the home of American businessman William Randolph Hearst who was known for founding the nation’s largest newspaper chain and media company, Hearst Communications.\n\nIn Hearst Castle’s golden days of the 1920s and 1930s, these lush grounds were frequented by celebrity guests such as Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Joan Crawford, the Marx Brothers and Winston Churchill, to name a few. Being that Charlie Chaplin is my absolute favorite actor of the silent film era, it was such a privilege to be a guest at a Hollywood-themed party in a place that he himself partied. I felt similarly awestruck when I visited Charlie Chaplin’s home in Switzerland in 2017, now known as Chaplin’s World.\n\nThe evening started at the Hearst Castle Visitor Center where all the guests to this party of 50 attendees checked in. It felt so special having my name on such a list, almost like being a guest of the legendary William Randolph Hearst himself.\n\nWe boarded the bus that took us to the top of the hill where Hearst Castle sits overlooking San Simeon and the vast, deep blue Pacific Ocean. The bus dropped us off at the front near the steps that led right to the Neptune Pool. There, we were given a brief orientation by the Foundation at Hearst Castle’s Executive Director, Mitch Massey, and Ranger Mullins of the California State Parks.\n\nAfter the orientation, we were free to go change in the historic dressing rooms or head straight to the pool. I had to change, so I went into one of the dressing rooms. As I walked in, I felt like I had stepped back into time, to the Roaring 20s. Every detail of that time period has been carefully preserved, including the lighting. After changing into my retro swimsuit, I had to snap a picture in the mirror because I certainly looked the part.\n\nI left the dressing room and walked down to the pool. I was given a towel that I was able to keep as a souvenir. Upbeat tunes were playing from the bands of the 1920s and 30s and the mood was very festive. There were various vendors set up and serving cocktails, wine, beer and both savory and sweet culinary delights. I bypassed the food and drinks and went straight for the pool, easing into it initially because I thought the water might be freezing. The water felt great. It was probably 10-15 degrees warmer up on the hill than down in San Simeon and I was grateful for that.\n\nI floated around in a pool donut that one of the lifeguards brought me for a couple of hours. Then I got out to try some of the food and drinks. Everything was outstanding from the presentation to the flavor. I loved the non-alcoholic wine from NON as well as the alcoholic cocktails served by Paso Robles Distillery Trail. I would be remiss to not mention the dreamy gelato offered by Leo Leo Gelato. It reminded me of the gelato I had in Italy. The food catered by Brick and Mortar Catering Company was absolutely delicious.\n\nAs the sun began its final descent on this memorable evening, the outside temperature took a dip. Interestingly, it was warmer in the pool than it was outside it. The chilly air didn’t ruin one of the most spectacular sunsets I had ever seen. The night sky gave way to an impressive light show in the distance due to the approaching tropical storm that was quite a way off from the area and not expected to have much of an impact there. It was like fireworks capping off a most enchanting evening."
