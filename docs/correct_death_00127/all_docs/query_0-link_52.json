August 15th and i6th, 1899. All descendants of John Peden and his wife ^Margaret (Peggy) ]\\IcDill, who can possibly do so, are requested to join the undersigned in a family reunion at Fairview Presby- terian church, in Greenville County, S. C, on August 15th and 1 6th, 1899. From the best information obtainable, the parents of John Peden refugeed from Scotland to the Xortli of Ireland during the time of the religious persecution in the former country. He and his family came to the United States, first landing in I'ennsylvania, settling in Bucks and Chester counties; just how long they remained there we cannot say. About the year 1768 he (John) removed to the Spartan District, South Carolina, settling near Nazareth church, in what is now Spar- tanburg County. They had ten children. Sons — James, Thomas, William, John, Samuel, Alexander and David. Daughters — Hilary, who married James Alexander, Sr.,; Jane, who married Morton, after whose death she married Samuel Mor- row; Elizabeth, who married William Gaston. (The latter left no children.) As stated above, it is our design to have a reunion of as many of their descendants as possibly can attend at the place and time stated. It is our purpose to erect a monument in Fairview cemetery to the memory of these, our venerated ancestors, John and Margaret Peden. Presuming that all of the descendants would consider it a privilege to take part in this good work, they are hereby re- lo THE REUNION. quested to forward any amount (much or little) as they may feel able to give, to Mr. Adam S. Peden, treasurer, at Foun- tain Inn, Greenville County, S. C. The amount should be forwarded at once (this week, not next), as the cost, size and design of the monument will depend upon the amounts con- tributed. As the time will soon arrive for the reunion and much work will have to be done in the meantime, prompt action is absolutely necessary. There will be a receptacle in the monument (in the nature of a corner-stone) in which will be placed a list of the names of all contributors, with amounts given by each. We also request all descendants to bring or send individual or family photographs, with their names, postofhce address, etc., plainly written on same, to be placed in the receptacle- alluded to above. This feature may prove to be of inestimable interest and pleasure to our descendants, say one hundred years from now. Also bring or send any relics to be placed on exhibition. Kinsmen, remember the monument to honor our parents, who left us a good name is going to be erected, and if you wish to join us in the good work you must act immediately in forwarding your contribution. We take pleasure in vouching for the integrity and thorough reliability of our treasurer, Mr. Adam S. Peden, who is an elder of the old mother church (Fairview) that has done so much for the cause of Christianity for more than one hundred years. The treasurer will promptly acknowledge receipt of all amounts sent to him. Most interesting historical sketches and addresses will be heard ; an elaborate program will be arranged for the occa- sion, and copies will be sent to all who express a desire or in- tention to attend the reunion. Quite a number of the Pedens now spell their names P-a-d-e-n; of course, this invitation applies to them also; then there are a number of our kinsmen (Pedens and Padens) in the North and West, and elsewhere, they too, and all de- THE EEUNION. u scendants connected by marriage, are cordially invited to join with us in the reunion ceremonies. You are urgently requested to advise all other Peden, Alex- ander, Morton, and Morrow descendants, of your acquain- tance, of the plans set forth, invite them to attend the reunion anxl kindly ask your local papers to publish notices of this invitation, for the name of Peden is legion, and the bearers of it are widely scattered, and it is our desire that none be overlooked. Those who hear of the reunion and attend it will be just as heartily welcomed as those known to us and to whom these circulars are sent. It is very important that all who expect to attend should send their names as early as possible to Mr. A. S. Peden, Fountain Inn, S. C, so that the Arrangement Committee may provide entertainment for them. RECAPITULATION. 1st. Reunion of Peden descendants. 2nd. Place — Fairview church, Greenville County, S.

We're gathered to-day on the old C4hiirch ground Where our forefathers dwelt ; And with songs of praise we bow before The Throne at which they knelt. Chorus. Many are the years that have past away Since they to Fairview came, And with joyful hearts we join today To sound abroad their fame. Singing to-day, singing to-day, Singing on the old Church ground. 2. That they might serve and worship God As taught within His Word, Our fathers turned from Scotland's shore And fled the tyrant's sword. Chorus. 3. 'Twas God's own hand that led them safe Across the ocean wide, And to this day His blessings free On their offspring abide. Chorus. 4. Here where they worshipped, loved and died, A marble shaft we raise, That generations yet to come May know and sing their praise. Chorus. 5. And now to God whose hand has led Us on in grace and love, Till we join the saints above. Our grateful thanks we'll raise through life, (Chorus after last verse.) There all our loved ones who've passed away We'll meet to part no more. 17 1 8 THE REUNION. And never a cloud shall cast its blight Across that shining shore. Safe in the- hope we're singing today, Singing on the old Church ground. Singing to-day, singing to-day. Singing on the old Church ground. PARTING HYMN. (Tune— \"TWnity.\") 1 . Come brothers ere we part, Come, let us raise our hearts To our great God. We praise Him for His love Which like a heavenly dove Rests on us from above, Holy, adored. 2. We praise Thee for the joy Which now our hearts employ While here we dwell. And as we turn away. Be, Lord, our strength and stay, That we from day to day Thy love may tell. 3. For Thy rich blessings free, OurFather, now to Thee, Our thanks we bring. Give what Thou seest best, Then shall we all be blest, We bow to Thy behest. Thy praise we sing. 4. As on we go through life, 'Mid peace and joy, or strife, Be Thou our guide. Then may th' eternal light, So guide our souls aright. That we, in garments bright, Stand near Thy side. THE REUNION OF JS99. Fairvicw ! what a thrill ; what a crowd of tender memories cluster round thy name, thou cradle of the Peden race on America's soil. Nature seemed in accord with the clan Peden on the dates set for their great gathering in August, 1899. Never shone the sun brighter ; never was the blue dome of heaven clearer ; never the native forests in denser, greener leaf — even the woodland singers seemed inspired with the spirit of the occa- sion, and myriads of throats made the welkin ring. The bustling little town of Fountain Inn was filled with pil- grims, and every train heralded the arrival of some Peden, bound for the shrine of his or her forefathers. A busy com- mittee of reception threaded their way in and out among the crowd, distributing visitors among waiting hosts, or eagerlv scanning strange, new faces for the familiar lineaments that mark the Peden. Long lines of carriages with Pedens, and their belongings were speeding along over the excellent country road towards their Mecca (Fairview). Now and then meeting an empty, returning carriage, driven by some Peden host, who must be delayed for a word of greeting, or a speedy introduction to some strange kinsman. The drive is a little over four miles, then a swift curve brought the white columns of Fairview church into view, up the gently sloping hill, through an avenue of stately oaks and pines, to her wide, open portals, her snowy columns bathed in the mellow radiance of the August sunlight, she seemed like a mother welcoming home her long lost children. Away dov/n the hill slope to the left, under the shadow of the trees, gleamed the white tents of the encampment, edged by a white sanded road, which, like a silver ribbon seperated the camp of the living from the silent bivouac of the dead, within the grey rock-walled church yard, where generations of Pedens were at rest. 20 THE REUNION. Near the center- stood mysterious in its drapery, the shrouded form of the Peden monument. After a brief rest at the temporary home, the writer and party strolled up the hill towards the church, and memory was busy with other days, other times, and other actors gone be- yond ken. Within the house of God busy committees were putting the finishing touches to their labor of love. The Pedens being Scotch-Irish-Americans, the decorations were emblematic of these peoples, and blended under the artist's hands into beautiful harmony. Those of Scotland and Ire- land combined with the stars and stripes of America, were draped from ceiling to floor, along the long galleries in fes- toons and sweeping folds of color. The sacred desk was banked with ferns, palms and potted plants of most luxurious growth and foliage, while rich colors lent their aid to the scene. The stairs and entrances were adorned and guarded by immense sheafs of Scottish thistle, so wo, to the unwary intruder, whose unconsecrated foot sought sacriligious hold, (to the Peden the pulpit is sacred). Above this, and covering the entire wall floated the colors of the three peoples, the purple red and orange of Scotland, the emerald green of Ireland, with the red, white and blue of the United States, formed a back-ground for the golden letters : JOHN AND PEGGY PEDEN, Founders of the House. PEDEN-ALEXANDER-MORTON-MORROW REUNION. 1760. 1899. \"The base and foundation of the church and nation is the family.\" Along the walls, galleries and pillars were life size portraits of the Pedens of past generations, among them their life-long pastor. Rev. Clark B. Stewart, Mrs. Rebecca (Peden) West- moreland, David Martin Peden, John McVey Peden, and others. THE EEUNION. 21 The relic corner, too, was specially attractive. (The writer hopes that some clay a mortuary chapel may be built of iron or bronze within the walls of the church-yard, these relics all be collected and placed therein in perpetuity.) A stack of rifles borne through the Revolutionary war by the seven brothers Peden, their rusty hunting knives, bayonets, swords, spurs, powder horns. All were not there, as some have wandered away to far ofif States, or lost ; some old colonial coins when George the Third was King, one or two dating back and bearing the curled, cruel head of Charles First ; old bits of crockery, pewter spoons and pans, ancient mirrows. or \"shaving glasses,\" old andirons and many articles of femi- nine handicraft, coverlets, quilts, fringes, laces, yellow with age, old pictures ; but missing was Peggy's treasured china with its varied history (it has passed out of the race) ; John's stick and his arm-chair, which David Morton made him, has since been found, but unattainable. Each article has its his- tory, its tradition, which if told would make a small volume. Leaving the relic corner with its hallowed memories, and passing out at the eastern door down the slope towards the camp .under the lengthening shadows, where the evening fires glowed the nostrils were greeted with savory odors of com- ing supper, such as the Peden housewives knew how to pre- pare. In the camp were gathered representatives from the houses of Mary, James, Thomas, John, Alexander and David, while were sadly m'issed any from the houses of Jane, Wil- liam and Samuel. The evening and far into the summer night was spent in that sweet communion and interchange of thought which is known only to those bound by ties of blood. On the morrow the arranged program was rendered as planned. The great church was filled to overflowing. Hon. John R. Harrison made the welcoming address in his usual stately, gracious manner which met the courteous response of Hon. Hooper Alexander. 22 THE REUNION. Mr. Chairman, Kinsmen and Friends : I thank you heartily in behalf of the visiting kin for your words of welcome, but it is just as useless for me to respond as it was for you to put into words the generous welcome that breathes in the very atmosphere about this old church. I never felt more at home in my life than I did from the first moment I drove up to this splendid grove and began to be introduced around to all these magnificent, big-boned, blue- eyed Peden men and all this galaxy of handsome Peden women. Your reference, Mr. Chairman, to Rob Roy is especially in harmony with my feelings ever since I have been on this hill. He was a McGregor of the Campbell clan, but because of the turbulent spirit of the McGregors they had been forbidden to bear the name, and in the lowlands answered by law to the name of Campbell. Going up into the mountain from Glas- gow, a companion addressed him as Campbell, to which he angrily retorted as he crossed the highland border: \"Camp- bell me no Campbells ; my foot is on my native heath and my name is McGregor.\" And so today I feel here that though I never was at Fair- view before, I am at home. And I want all you Pedens to imderstand that I am just as much a Peden as any of you. It is true that I bear another name and a name that I have no desire to drop even for the name of Peden, but all we Stew- arts and Harrisons and Vernons and Celys and Shannons and Salmons and all the rest have just this much advantage of you, that we come down from the good looking Peden girls, the best part of the family, and that's why we go by other names. I never saw so many people of the same name in my life. Down in my country, in Georgia, we have got a big batch of the Pedens, and good folks they are, too, and if you come to Georgia we can make very substantial additions to your lists of kinsfolks with our Casselses and Kings and Shannons and Gordons and Rounsavilles and Pegues and Salmons and lots of others ; but I am obliged to confess that this is the first THE REUNION. 23 time I ever found enough kinsfolks to stock a whole county at one time. I never will get them straight. There is your Tom Peden and your Dick Peden, your long Jim Peden and your short Jim Peden, your Bill Peden and your Hugh Peden, and such another list of Pedens that I don't know how you ever found names enough to go round. . Verily, John Peden of old had the blessing of Abraham, w^hom God called out of the Chaldees and promised to make him father of many nations. Surely you are like the old darkev said about the patriarchs of old — the forgetfullest people on earth — for, said he, \"dey forgot deir own chillun. Abraham forgot Isaac and Isaac forgot Jacob and Jacob forgot a hole lot of his boys.\" Verily the Pedens are a forget- ful race. Mr. Chairman, I thank you again for your cordial words of welcome. SCOTCH-IRISH AND THEIR ACHIEVEME^TTS. Mr. Alexander, having concluded his address in response to the welcome, entered into his speech on \"The Scotch-Irish and their achievements.\" For almost an hour Mr. Alexander held his kinsmen spellbound with his eloquence, and eve^y word that came from his lips during his discoure fell upon attentive ears. In part he said : Every incident in human history is a separte knot in the intricate meshes of eternity's net work, the constituent cords of which reach forward, diverging to an unknown future. Every action of men, whether isolated from thicr fellows or in connection with them, is potent for influence, good or bad, on human civilization. Every separate occasion in the affairs of men bears fruit in its own future and finds the springs of its own occurrence ramifying back through uncounted ages of the past. The benificent Father of us all gave us every good and per- fect gift, whose covenant has stood through the ages to declare that He will show mercy unto thousands of those that 24 THE EEUNIOIN. love Him and keep His commandments, has not seen fit to give us any glimpses of the future that lies before, nor allowed us to look forward and forecast what consequences shall flow from this coming together of men and women to do honoi to the memory of one sturdy man and one virtuous woman. But it is permitted that we look back and trace out the steps that have preceded and made possible this occasion. Let us this day exercise for a while the privilege of retrospection and find what lessons of the past may serve to make us better men and better women and stand as staunch witnesses to the future for virtues of an honorable past. If we seek backward into history for the mainspring of the present occasion, all the threads of research lead indeed to John Peden, Ulsterman, Presbyterian and elder, and to Peggy McDill, faithful helpmate to a worthy man and mother of many generations, proudest of^ce ever given to a woman. But we shall fail to measure up to the full significance of the present occasion if we stop with the frontiersman and go not back to a remoter past, rich as his own life, in every in- spiration for the patriot, the parent and the Christian. Go with me today and I will carry you back along the path- way of a peculiar people, who, whether we find them fighting for their firesides as Carolina Whigs, or staunchly standing amid the Shamrock boys of Ireland for the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, or leagued together in solemn covenant in the shadow of Scot- land's heathered hills, in every condition and under all cir- cumstances have steadfastly stood for the rights of mankind and sturdily maintained their faith toward God and men. From such a people and such stock John Peden drew his lineage. It is true indeed that no virtue and no glory of ancestry can redeem any present from its own unworthiness. It is true indeed that every present must stand or fall by its own record. True is it indeed that no present condition can find atone- ment for its own unworthiness by pointing to an illustrious past. It is always true that honorable ancestry only aggra- THE EEUNION. 25 vates the blame for a degenerate present. But it is also true that it is at all times wise and proper to illuminate and study the virtues of past ages if we purpose in so doing to set them before us as a model to imitate for the future. In such a spirit and with such a purpose let us trace out today the history that drove stalwart John Peden to leave his home in Ireland, and like a patriarch of old, with his children and childrens' children around him, become part of that splendid band of empire builders who carved out of this primeval wilderness the corner-stone and pediment on which is still being upreared the temple of the best civilization of the nations. STORY OF PERSECUTION. The speaker then proceeded to develop the story of the persecution of the Presbyterians in Scotland, the great migra- tion and settlement of Scotch Presbyetrians in the northren province of Ireland at the invitation of King James, and the persecutions to which they were there subjected, the ingrati- tude which was shown by the Engish kings, parliament and church for their splendid services in building up law, order and industry there ; their final disappointment at the con- tinued persecutions and oppression in trade, schools, marri- ages and religion, and their final abandonment of Ireland in swarms for the American colonies. Speaking of their final disappointment in the conduct of the House of Hanover, the speaker read this striking passage from James Anthony Froude, the great English historian : \"And now recommenced the Protestant emigration which robbed Ireland of the bravest defenders of English interests and peopled the American seaboard with fresh flights of Puri- tans. Forty thousand left Ulster on the destruction of the woolen trade. Many more were driven away by the first passing of the test act. The stream had slackened in the hope that the law would be altered.

Long as the story has been, I have had bare time to scantily outline the record of the Scotch in Ireland and their influence on America. Col- umns have been written on each several item of their spirit- stirring epic, and how could I hope with my feeble tongue to do justice to such a theme. Take it with you to your homes when we separate, and take with you the proud consciousness that you spring from honorable lives. Teach the story to your children and your childrens' children, to remostest gen- erations, and let them understand that the splendid heritage they have through John Peden and Peggy McDill entails on them the high duty to be worthy always of its faithful tra- ditions. No man knows what is in store for us yet. The future is big with uncertain issues. The peace that Ulster won under James was followed by the massacre of '41. Derry and Enniskilen and Boyne water gave no immunity against the eighteenth century. The tranquility of a subdued American wilderne£s did not exempt them from the high duties of Ala- mance and Mecklenburg and King's Mountain. The treaty of Paris had to be paid for by the statesmanship of the Constitution builders, and so today, with religious tole- ration established and old Fairview the center of a land of tranquil religious history, no man here may know where next it shall please God to try our souls as the souls of our ances- tors were tried before us. Let every man go to his respective home, resolved that THE EEUNION. 27 when that day comes there shall not be written on our walls the tekel upharsin of an unworthy generation. At 4.30 o'clock in the afternoon the clan again gathered in the church, a vast conclave, for a few brief words, then, at the command of the Chairman, descended the hillside to the sacred enclosure where stood tall, mysterious in its white drapery, the Peden Monument, on the sunrise corner of the old, brick church, in the very heart of the solemen, last home of many Pedens. During the singing of the unveiling hymn the veil was dropped by the four dear little girl cousins selected for the honor. These lovely little ones shall go down into Peden history, in letters of living gold, \"fair as poet's dreaming\" are they ; bonny, rosey, bright-eyed, lassies of the House of Alex- ander: Jane Armstrong, Lucy Allen Peden, Lauribelle Peden, Lulu Templeton. The monument stood revealed; a marble shaft pointing heavenward, rising sixteen feet from the pedestal, being four feet broad at the base, a pedestal of some feet between base and shaft, on which is engraved in large letters the name PEDEN. This on the north side, and above it is the dedication: In Memoriam. \"This monument is placed by their grateful descendants, gathered from far and near, and who are as the sands by the seashore, and stars of heaven for multitude.\" August 17, 1899.

[Said to have been the last audible words of John Peden.] On the southside and overlooking long rows of Peden tombs, are placed the arms of the adopted State — South Car- olina. That grand old commonwealth, whose freedom from tyranny was dearer to John Peden and his seven sons than life itself. All of whom, as well as the three sons-in-law, and numerous grandsons, bore arms in defense during the dark days of the American Revolution. As is fitting, the arms are entwined and surrounded with the thistle of Scotland, the shamrock of Ireland, while in the midst, proud and stately, stands the imperishable palm. While on the western side, facing the broad iron gates, presented by Capt. D. D. Peden, are inscribed the names of the children of John and Margaret Peden. SONS OF PEDEN. James. Thomas. John. William. Samuel. Alexander. David. DAUGHTERS OF PEDEN. Mary (Peden) Alexander. Jane (Peden) Morton-Morrow. Elizabeth (Peden) Gaston.

The second day of the reunion was intended to be strictly historical, but owing to the enforced absence of Rev. R. B. Morrow, the time allotted to his theme was courteously given to Rev. S. R. Preston, D. D., of Chicora College, Greenville, S. C, who spoke fluently for Christian Education. Capt. David D. Peden, acknowledged chief and leader of the clan, in his usual happy, courtly style gave the history of the race. ADDRESS OF CAPT. D. D. PEDEN. My Friends and Kinspeople : Your committee on addresse has assigned to me the task of writing a history of the Peden family. I doubt not this work could have been done in a much more attractive and interesting manner by a number of those who are present here today. However that may be, I will do the best I can and bespeak your kind indulgence. Tradition tells us that the name Peden appears in the annals of the old Culdee church, on the western coast of Scot- land, located on the little island lona, and near to Ayrshire, the home of some of the Pedens to this day. The Culdee church is said to have been one of the purest types of the Protestant religion. In fact, it is claimed to be a continua- tion of the Apostolic church, (See history of \"The Culdee Church\" by Rev. T. V. Moore, D. D., published by our com- mittee at Richmond, Va.) The Peden referred to is said to 30 THE REUNION. have been a shepherd, an honest and honorable calhng. What relationship there is between the Shepherd Peden and our ancestors is, of course, conjecture, though we may reasonably suppose we are his descendants. The first authentic mention of the Peden name, that I have been able to find, after considerable research and correspond- ence, was during the persecution of the Protestant Christ- ians by the Roman Catholics under the Stuarts in Scotland, a period embracing the year 1680, when \"The Declaration and Testimony of the True Presbyterian, Anti-prelatic, Anti- erastian. persecuted party in Scotland,\" and known as the \"Sanquhar Declaration,\" was adopted. (See page 31, Trad. Covenanters.) The Pedens were an Ayeshire family, in the west of Scot- land, (where to this day it is still quite a common name). In the middle of the sixteenth century a number of the Peden families went to the North of Ireland to escape the persecu- tion then raging in Scotland. About the beginning of the seventeenth century some of these famiHes and their descend- ants returned to their native land, some remained in the land of their adoption, while our ancestors sought civil and re- ligious freedom in the wilds of the American forests. I will leave this branch of the subject for the moment, re- turning to the religious persecution of Scotland. Rev. Alex- ander Peden, sometimes called \"Peden the Prophet,\" bore a conspicuous part during the times referred to in 1680, in encouraging the Protestants to be steadfast in adhering to their faith and doctrine, many of whom, in order to do so, had to endure many hardships and deprivations, even martyr- dom. During the reign of the Stuarts the persecution was both cruel and relentless, under the inhumane Claverhouse and his minions. In order to worship God according to the dictates of their consciences, they had to meet oftentimes at night or in the dense forests and on the wild mountain sides. Their ministers, especially, were hunted like wild beast and THE EEUXIOX. 31 had to take refuge in caves, caverns and the moss hags and mountains. The following is taken from his \"Life and Death,\" pub- lished in Belfast, in 1790: ''Alexander Peden, late minister of the gospel at Glenluce, in Galloway, who died the 28th of January, 1686, being about sixty years of age. He was born in the parish of Sorn, in 1626, in the Sb-erififdom of Ayr. After that he passed his courses in college, he was employed for some time to be school master, precentor and session clerk to Mr. John Guth- rie, minister of the gospel at Tarboltown. He had no family and was never married. He was a man of sincere and deep piety ; he was a brave man and possesed the courage of his convictions in a very remarkable degree.\" TEADITIOXS OF THE COVEXAXTERS. I will read some extracts from a little volume, the title of which is \"Traditions of the Covenanters,\" by the Rev. Robert Simpson, Sanquhar, Scotland : \"About the commencement of the persecution in Scotland, nearly three hundred and fifty ministers were ejected from their churches, in the severity of winter, and driven with their families, to seek shelter among the peasants. \"The desolation and distress of many a family, after the standard of the gospel was reared in the field, were unutter- able. The tender hearted wife knew not how it fared with her husband traversing the waste, or lodged in the cold, damp cave ; and many a disconsolate hour did she spend in weeping over her helpless children, who had apparetnly nothing before them but starvation. The affectionate husband, far from his dearly cherished home, was full of the bitter remembrance of his beloved family, and picturing to himself their many wants which he could not now relieve, and their many sorrows which he could not soothe, and the many insults from which he could not defend them. But, notwithstanding all this, they had peace ; for God was with them. And though their hearts sometimes misgave them, yet, through the grace of Him with 32. THE REUNION. whose cause they were identified, their faith recovered its proper tone, and their despondency vanished. \"One of the most renowned of those worthies who per- sisted in preaching the gospel in the wilds of his native land, at the constant hazard of his life, was the venerable Alexan- der Peden, whose history is familiar in almost every cottage in Scotland. Every incident of any importance in the life of this good man has already been collected, so that scarcely anything new can now be added. Still there is to be found a stray anecdote of him here and there in the romote parts of the country, and which, for his sake, may be deemed worthy of record. Few persons possessed a more saintly character than did this man of God. He was full of faith and of the Holy Ghost. Entirely devoted to his Master's service, he counted not his own life dear unto him, that he might main- tain the cause of truth in the face of the abounding iniquity of a degenerate age. His solitary wanderings, his destitutions, his painful perseverance in preaching the gospel, the peril in which he lived, his prayerful spirit, and the homeliness of his manners, greatly endeared liim to the people among whom he sojourned. He had no home, and therefore he spent much of his time in the fields. The caves by the mountain stream, the dense hazel wood in the deep glens, the feathery brackens on the hill, the green corn when it was tall enough to screen him from observation, afforded him by turns, when necessary, a retreat from his pursuers, and a place for communing with his God. \"On one such occasion he had fixed his eye on a cottage far off in the waste in which lived a godly man with whom he had frequent intercourse, and there being nothing within view calculated to excite alarm he resolved to pay his friend a visit. With his staff in his hand he wended his way to the low grounds to gain the track which led to the house. He reached it in safety, was hospitably entertained by the kind landlord, and spent the time with the household in pious conversation and prayer till sunset. Not daring to remain all night, he left them to return to his dreary cave. As he was trudging along THE REUNION. 33 the soft foot path and suspecting no harm, all at once several moss troopers appeared coming over the bent and advancing directly upon him. He fled across the moor, and when about to pass the torrent that issues from Glendyne, he per- ceived a cavity underneath its bank that had been scooped out by the running stream into which he instinctively crept and stretching himself at full length lay hidden beneath the grassy coverlet waiting the result. In a short time the dra- goons came up, and having followed close in his track, reached the brook at the very spot where he was ensconced. As the heavy horses came thundering over the smooth turf, on the edge of the little rivulet, the foot of one of them sank quite through the hollow covering under which the object of their pursuit lay. The hoof of the animal grazed his head, and pressed his bonnet deep into the. soft clay at his pillow, and left him entirely uninjured. His persecutors having no suspicion that the poor fugitive was so near them, crossed the stream with all speed, and bounded away in quest of him whom God had thus hidden as in his pavilion, and in the secret of his tabernacle. A man hke Peden, who read the hand of God in everything, could not fail to see and to ac- knowledge that Divine goodness, which was so eminently displayed in this instance ; and we may easily conceive with what feelings he would return to his retreat in the wood, and with what cordiality he would send up the voice of thanks- giving and praise to the God of his life. A MEMORABLE DELIVERANCE. \"It is recorded in the Scots Worthies that he was favored with a memorable deliverance from the enemy who were pur- suing him and a small company with him somewhere in Gallo- way after he came out of Ireland. When their hope of escape was almost cut ofif, he knelt down among the heather and prayed, Twine them about the hill. Lord, and cast the lap of Thy cloak over old Sandy and these poor things and we will keep it in remembrance and tell it to the commendation of Thy goodness, pity and compassion what Thou didst for us at 34 THE REUNION. such a time.' Thus he prayed, and his suppUcation was re- corded in heaven, for he had no sooner risen from his knees than dense volumes of snow-white mist came rolHng down from the summit of the mountains and shrouded them from the sight of their pursuers who, Hke the men of Sodom when they were smitten with bUndness, could not grope their way after them.\" I quote again from the same book : ''This occasion is related by old Patrick Walker in the fol- lowing words : 'After this, in Auchengrouch muirs in Niths- dale, Capt. John Mathison and others being with him, they were alarmed with a report that the enemy were coming fast upon him, so they designed to put him in some hole, and cover him with heather. But not being able to run hard by reason of age, he desired them to forbear a little until he prayed, when he said: 'Lord, we are ever needing at Thy hand, and if we had not Thy command to call upon Thee in the day of our trouble, and Thy promise of answering us in the day of our distress, we wot not what would become of us ; if Thou hast an}^ more work for us in Thy world, allow us the lap of Thy cloak this day again ;\"and if this be the day of our going olT the stage, let us walk honestly of¥, and comfortably through, and our souls will sing forth Thy praises to eternity for what thou hast done to us, and for us.' When ended he ran alone a little, and came quickly back, saying, 'Lads, the bitterest of this blast is over ; we will be no more troubled with them this day.' Foot and horse came the length of Andrew Clark's, in Auchengrouch, where they were covered with a dark mist. When they saw it they roared like fleshly devils, as they were crying out : 'There's the confounded mist again ! we cannot get these execrable whigs pursued for it.' \" BANISHED TO AMEEICA. I could continue to quote many other interesting incidents, but I must not consume too much of your time, as some of you, at least, are perhaps familiar with them. I will mention THE REUNION. 35 one incident taken from the \"Life and Death of Alexander Peden.\" During the time of the persecution, he and a number of covenanters were captured by the enemy and were sentenced to banishment to the EngUsh plantations in America. \"When brought from the Bass (prison) to Edinburgh and sentence passed on him and sixty others, in December, 1678, to go to America, never to be seen in Scotland again under the pain of death. He several times said : 'The ship was not yet built that would take him or these prisoners to Virginia, or any other of the English plantations in America.' When they were on ship board, in the road of Leith, there was a report that their enemies were to send down Thumbikins to keep them from rebelling. At the report of this they were greatly discouraged; he came above deck and said, 'Why are you so cast down ? You need not fear there will be Thumbikins nor Bootekins come here ; lift up your hearts and heads, for the day of your redemption draweth near ; if we are once in Lon- don we will all be set at liberty.' This remarkable prophecy was literally fulfilled, for when the skipper who was to take them from London to Virginia came to see them, they being represented to him as thieves, robbers and evil doers, he re- fused to take them aboard. When he found they were grave Christian men, banished for Presbyterian principles, he said, 'I will sail the sea with none such.' In this confusion, that one skipper would not receive them and the other would keep them no longer, it being expensive to maintain them, they were all set at liberty. Both skippers, it is said, 'got compli- ments in London for releasing them.' They went to Ireland and then returned to Scotland, in face of the threat that, if he did he would be punished with death, thus evincing courage and devotion to duty that cannot be surpassed. Many other thrilling and even marvelous incidents could be given regard- ing this remarkable man.\" I must forbear, however, and return to our immediate ancestors. You have already been told that some of the Pedens came from Ireland to America to seek religious and 36 THE REUNION. civil liberty. Among that number were our ancestors, John Peclen and wife, Margaret. We are assembled here today to pay homage to their memory. We have representatives here from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans, all the way they have come, from the golden shores of California, on the Pacific, to dear old South Carolina, whose shores are washed by the Atlantic, and which was the home of these aged saints. Their ashes lie buried in her bosom. I suppose there is scarcely a State or Territory in the United States that does not contain descendants of John Peden. SETTLED IN PENNSYLVANIA. Tradition tells us that he settled in Pennsylvania, probably Chester County. Our ancesters, having several sons who had preceded them to this country, and settled in what in now Spartanburg County, S. C, they and other members of their families came and settled in the same place, not far from old Nazereth Presbyterian church, about the year 1768. (See Dr. Howe's \"History of Presbyterianism in South Carolina,\" but more particularly the centennial celebration of old Fairview church, in September, 1886; specially the address of our kins- man. Rev. M. C. Britt, and an historical sketch by Mr. Sav- age.) It is sad to relate, that these venerable people, with their seven sons, three sons-in-law and their families, were not granted the privilege of enjoying the civil liberties they had traveled so far and risked so much to obtain. They had scarcely settled in their new homes before the Revolutionary War was begun. We are told that all of the sons and sons- in-law were Revolutionary soldiers. I have heard also that the venerable John was himself a soldier. I have some doubt on this point as tradition tells us that by reason of the incur- sions of the Indians and Tories, the old people, with the younger members of their families, refugeed to Chester County, near the old \"Catholic Presbyterian Church,\" for safety. At the close of the war in 1783, we are told also, on account of their age, they remained in Chester County after THE EEUNION. 37 the close of the Revokitionary War, where they died and were buried near the old \"Catholic Presbyterian Church.\" The others returned and settled near this church, with the exception of the second son, Thomas, who returned to and settled near the old homestead in Spartanburg. Some years afterwards, one son, probably Samuel, and the second daughter, Jane, with her second husband, Mr. Samuel ^lor- row, moved to Alabama. All of the ten children, except Elizabeth, who married \\Vm. Gaston, raised large families. The descendants of the Pedens, Alexanders, Mortons and Morrows are almost as the sands by the sea shore in numbers. NEAELY ALL WEKE FAEMEKS. For the most part, the descendants are, as were their honored fathers before them, engaged in agricultural pursuits. It is said that when our ancestors (to honor whose memory we have erected the handsome monument in the old cemetery near by where the ashes of so many of our loved ones are buried) left the coast of Ireland to seek their homes in this country that the father of us all set his face steadfastly towrads the west, refusing all entreaties to take a parting look at the Emerald Isle as it faded out of view. On the con- trary, our mother, ]\\Iargaret, who is said to have been a beau- tiful as well as a good woman, shed tears as the isle, which had been her home, sank out of sight behind the eastern horizon. The passage over the broad Atlantic was a long and tiresome one at best in those days, and their voyage was specially disa- greeable on account of severe weather and lasted many days. Our ancestors were cabin passengers on this memorable trip from the Emerald Isle to the then comparatively new world, and they fared of course much better than did the steerage passengers on this long and stormy passage. I exceedingly regret that both time and lack of informa- tion prevent me from giving somewhat in detail, at least, brief sketches of each of the ten children of our venerable and ven- erated ancestors. Their record, however, is a glorious one — one in which we can take a pardonable pride. First, and best 38 THE KEUNION. of all, they were God-fearing men and women ; all strong ad- herents-to the \"true Presbyterian, Anti-Prelatic, Anti-Eras- tian, persecuted party of Scotland,\" of which \"Peden the Prophet\" was such a determined and fearless advocate and to which church, I presume, at least nine-tenths of their descen- dants are still adherents. THE OTHER TENTH. The above remarks, I wish it distinctly understood, means no reflection to the remaining tenth. I know of my personal knowledge of some of our kinspeople who have united with other Protestant churches in the communities to which they had moved. Others, again, married into families of other denominations and in that way became separated from us. Others, perhaps, joined other churches through choice. Just so long as they are Christians and are fighting under the ban- ner of the Cross, we are all brethren, friends, kinsmen, and are all most affectionately and cordially welcome to this love- feast of relatives. If there is a family in this great and glori- ous countfy of ours ( the United States of America) who can honestly and truly feel a glow of pride in the part taken by their Revolutionary sires in the memorable struggle that won our independence from England, that family is the Peden family. \"There are others,\" but we yield the palm to none unless they can successfully prove their claim. Seven sons and three sons-in-law, and a number of grand- sons, and probably the old father, from one family, is a record not easily beaten. Several of the sons and grandsons, and perhaps sons-in-law, held commissions. A REVOLUTIONARY HERO. My grandfather, David Peden, was the youngest of the ten children, and, no doubt, a private soldier. There is not a particle of doubt that he took an active part in the revolution that brought independence to the United States. I have here the positive proof, it being a grant from the State of South Carolian for nine hundred acres of land, signed by Governor THE EEUXIOX. 39 Charles Pinckney, 20th of February, 1792. Rabun Creek, the head-waters of which you cross coming from Fountain Inn here, runs through the property, on which stream one of the first grist and saw mills erected in this part of the country was built by him. He and his two wives are buried in the ceme- tery near the monument erected in honor of his father and mother, John and Margaret Peden. He was the father of thirteen children, my father, Rev. Andrew G. Peden, being next to the youngest. For a more detailed history of the ten children of John and Margaret Peden, and their descendants, we will have to look to our historian, who will take up Peden History, etc. MOEE FEDEXS AND PADEXS. Before concluding I wish to say that there are a number of Pedens and Padens in the United States who are doubtless related to us, but who are not descendants of our ancestors. John and Margaret Peden. There are Pedens and Padens in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Texas and perhaps other States, whose ancestors came direct from Scotland. I have in my possesion a copy of a singular letter written by Dr. Alexander D. Peden, giving a graphic and tragic account of the great flood on the coast of Texas about tewnty-four years ago. AX EXTIEE CITY ENGULFED. Indianola at that time was a prosperous seaport town ; in fact, was a rival of the city of Galveston in point of commerce, trade, etc. The city was literally swept from the face of the earth — ^the waters from the Gulf were driven by the fury of the winds many miles inland. Dr. Peden's family was on his ranch (or farm) some distance from the city. His wife and children were drowned, except three children. One son was assistant keeper of the Hghthouse, one daughter was absent (at school, perhaps), one small son took refuge in a cedar tree which was about to be submerged. Seeing his pet pony swimming by, he called to him. The pony turned and came 40 THE REUNION. immediately under the tree and the boy dropped on his back, and was thus miraculously carried to a place of safety. Dr. Peden was serving on a jury some distance from home, con- sequently was unable to aid his family in making their escape. Speaking of himself, Dr. Peden says he \"sprang from an ancient family of Pedens in Scotia's isle.\" Further says he was \"the son of Alexeander Peden, de- ceased, merchant of Wilmington, N. C. He, in turn, was son of Mingo Peden, merchant, in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland,\" and adds that he had been at the grave of Alexander Peden, \"the prophet in Scotland. A thorn bush grows at his head, as he prophesied.\" Archie Hoye, Chester, S. C, says the grave is at Cumnock, Scotland, and that two thorn bushes grow at the head of his grave, one bearing a white and the other a red bloom. Mr. Hoye's statement is borne out by books from Scotland. I could continue to give various interesting inci- dents, sketches, etc., but time admonishes me that I must give way to those whose addresses will be much more interesting than this historical sketch. A PLEA FOR EDUCATION. Before taking my seat, however, I want to beg, insist and entreat one and all to pay more attention to the education of your children. Out of our vast relationship, running into the thousands, we should and ought to have representatives in all the branches and walks of Hfe. We should aspire to have a president, or, better, presidents of the United States, presi- dents of colleges, universities, governors of States, United States Senators, memebrs of congress and legislatures, men eminent in theology, law and physics, science, arts, mechanics and in other walks of life. The farmer's life is an honorable one, none more so, but we must not be content to be all farmers. Recognize talent in your children and encourage them to develop it ; for heaven's sake, don't suppress it ; don't discourage them by belittling their efforts. I haven't the least doubt but there have been Pedens and descendants by other names, if they THE EEUNION. 41 had been encouraged and educated, could and would have occupied the positions mentioned above. They simply lacked the opportunity, and the lack of a good education barred them from the opportunity. In conclusion, I want to mention a little incident that occurred within a short distance of this spot, quite recently. I was invited to visit one of our kinsmen. The weather was intensely hot ; we were sitting in the yard in the shade of the trees. The father directed his little son to step across the road and see if the peas sown in the corn were coming up. The little fellow promptly obeyed. Returning, he plucked a \"may pop\" about the size of a large hen's egg. He reported \"the peas are coming up all right, sir.\" He then commenced cutting into the \"may pop,\" and in a few moments had fash- ioned it into a perfectly proportioned basket. He held it up by the deUcate handle and looked it over. He then began work on the outer sides of the basket. I was watching him, and the thought occurred to me that, boy-like, he was going to cut it to pieces, but he didn't ; instead he was ornamenting it, by tracing a vine and leaves into the green rind of the \"may pop.\" I then asked to see it. He seemed surprised that I should notice what he regarded so simple a thing. I re- marked to the father : \"There is talent in that boy, you ought to encourage him.\" A YOUNG GENIUS. The father then told the boy to bring and show me the \"scraper\" he had made. He soon returned with the front wheels of his toy wagon, an iron rod, a piece of chain, a piece of discarded steel, that had been used by the convicts in work- ing the roads. With this material he had constructed a mini- ature road machine that does beautiful work. The little fel- low showed me a little sidewalk or roadway he had built at right angels to the road and adjoining the front yard. The work is there to show for itself. In passing the home of Mr. James Peden going from here, look on the far side of the yard, and you will see as perfect a little road bed as Mr. San- 42 THE EEUNION. ders, manager of the convicts, can construct. The lesson is: Encourage and educate the boys and girls. Upon the conclusion of his address Capt. Peden introduced little Lee Peden to the members of the, family, and the little fellow was given an ovation by his kinspeople. The great reunion of 1899 is now of the past. Many have crossed over beyond our ken, in the few years that have inter- vened, some sleep in faraway tombs, some rest under the shade of the trees at Fairview, under the shadow of the monu- ment they helped to rear, while the march \"Homeward\" and Heavenward !\" is steady — there are equally, or more, tiny crafts launched on the turbulent ocean of this life, to fill up the vacant places, and advance with the progressive spirit of the New Century. MINUTES OP THE PEDEN--ALEXAMDER--MORTON-MORROW REUNION. Fairview, S. C, August 15th, 1899. The reunion exercises of Peden, Alexander, Morton, Mor- row was called to order at 10 o'clock a. m., by Hon. Hooper Alexander, of Atlanta, Ga., who nominated Hon. Jno. R. Harrison as chairman. He was unanimously elected and made a capital address of welcome ; so we felt at once so per- fectly at home that \"it was good to be there.\" The meeting began with grand Old Hundred to the long meter doxology ; then a prayer by the pastor of Fairview church. Rev. H. W. Burwell, (who, while not of the Peden race, has been closely identified with its interests). After which the elction of a per- manent chairman was in order, resulting in the unimous elec- tion of Hon. John R. Harrison, of Fairview, South Carolina. Then the following vice-presidents were elected from the different States represented : 1st — Rev. R. B. Morrow, Demopolis, Ala. 2d— J. W. T. Peden, Van Vleet, Miss. 3d — Capt. D. D. Peden, Houston, Tex. 4th— M. S. Paden, Woodstock, Ga. 5th — Louis Salmons, Valley Center, Cal. 6th — Judge J. Wister Stewart, Fairview, S. C. [None of the other States having representatives present, the election of vice-presidents was discontinued.] On motion, W. M. Stenhouse, of Sterling, S. C, was elected Secretary, and Eleanor M. Hewell, of Greenville, S. C, was elected as Assistant Secretary and Historian. After the election of permanent officers Dr. H. B. Stew- art, of Fairview, S. C, presented to the Reunion a beautiful gavel, made from a root of a black walnut tree taken from \"Alexander Peden's place.\" The venerable tree was planted by him, over a century ago, soon after he located on his land. 44 THE REUNION. Dr. Stewart is the present owner and a great-great-grandson- in-law of Alexander Peden. His words were very appropriate in presenting the gavel, finding an echo in all our hearts, while he held the full atten- tion of the large gathering. A well chosen hymn to Autumn followed, after which the Reunion had the pleasure of hearing Hon. Hooper Alexander, of Atlanta, Ga. Subject : \"The Scotch-Irish and their Achievements.\" [Hon. Hooper is a typical Alexander. A man who has given the clan every rea- son to be extremely proud of his achievements in the legal profession.] His address was received with enthusiastic ap- plause, and followed by grand, inspiring old Coronation, \"All hail the power of Jesus name.\" The Rev. R. B. Morrow was unavoidably absent, therefore the Reunion was deprived of the pleasure of seeing and hear- ing this gifted son of the Church. His subject, \"The Pedens and Presbyterianism\" was omitted and the time allotted used otherwise. The closing hymn was sung to Protection. The Chairman then announced that at the afternoon session we would unveil the Monument, and as soon as the unveiling took place the afternoon session would be declared adjourned. Meeting then adjourned with benediction by pastor. (Signed.) W. M. Stenhouse, Secretarv. AFTERNOON SESSION. Meeting called to order by Chairman, Hon. Jno. R. Harri- son. After singing the Chairman announced that the Re- union would repair to the church yard to witness and take part in the unveiling of the Peden Monument. After the unveiling the meeting is adjourned until 9 a. m. tomorrow. (Signed.) W. M. Stenhouse, Secretary. The reunion. 45 SECOND DAY— MORXING SESSION. Fairview, S. C, August i6th, 1899. Chairman Hon. Jno. R. Harrison called the Reunion to order at 9 o'clock a. m. Meeting opened with prayer, after which we sung the old famihar hymn, 117, to the tune Fount. The Chairman then introduced Capt. D. D. Peden, of Houston, Texas, to whom the Reunion is very much in- debted for its success. Capt. Peden was listened to with great interest and pleasure while he traced the Peden familv back to an early century. The choir then rendered very beautifully the hymn com- posed for the occasion by Rev. H. W. Burwell, \"Singing on the Old Church Ground.\" Dr. S. R. Preston, President of Chicora College, Greenville, S. C, then gave a very able talk on Christian Education, filling the space allotted to the venerable Judge John R. Alex- ander, of Thomasville, Ga., who was debarred from coming to the Reunion by the infirmities of age, so his \"Reminisen- ces\" were omitted, to our keen regret. Reports were called for and Adam S. Peden, treasurer, read his, which was quite satisfactory, therefore unanimously adopted by the Reunion. Meeting then adjourned to meet at 3.45 p. m. Benediction pronounced by Rev. S. R. Preston, D. D., of Chicora College, Greenville, S. C. (Signed.) W. M. Stenhouse, Secretary. AFTERNOON SESSION. Meeting called to order by the Chairman, Hon. Jno. R. Harrison, and opened with singing of the grand tune of \"Loving Kindness,\" and it was the pleasure of all to hear ad- dresses by the following: J. Ripley Westmoreland, of Wood- rufif, S. C, and Rev. John C. Bailey, Jr., of Summerton, S. C. [These two gifted young men represent the present genera- 46 THE REUNION. tion, and give bright promise of future usefulness in their professions.] They were followd briefly by Col. J. A. Hoyt (editor of the oldest newspaper in Greenville County, \"The Mountaineer,\" which has been in existence for nearly a cen- tury, under several names. He is also of Sctoch-Irish descent, therefore in strong sympathy with the Peden race). Dr. H. B. Stewart made a feeling response to his call and paid a loving tribute to the memory of one of the best beloved pastors of old Fairview church, who in life and death was a faithful shepherd of the flock, Rev. Clark B. Stewart. Adam S. Peden then read, by request, a letter from the venerable and beloved Mark S. Peden, of Woodstock, Ga., stating that his advanced age only kept him away, and re- quested to be kindly remembered to all present. The closing address, which was a grand burst of oratory, was given by Hon. Hooper Alexanded, after which the part^ ing hvmn, composed by Rev. H. W. Burwell, was sung stand- ing. The Chairman announced the grand Reunion of Peden Alexander, Morton, Morrow, adjourned to meet another day. Rev. H. W. Burwell pronounced the last benediction. (Signed.) W. M. Stenhouse, Secretary. These minutes are inserted as part of the Reunion of 1899. They will be corrected and adopted by the next Reunion of Peden, Alexander, Morton, Morrow. Eleanor M.

Only within the last few years of the present centurv has the new world awakened to the sad fact that the very founders of its history were fast sinking into utter oblivion, leaving not the faintest trace of their achievements. One of the curious and interesting evolutions of the dav is the or- ganization of societies founded upon ancestries connected 'with the earlier history of the country, and happy is that family who can boast of forefathers whose arrival in the new world ante-date the Revolution. These Historic societies are steadily on the increase, a list would be almost intermi- nable, for the fever is spreading yearly until it is becoming an epidemic. The tracing of this ancestry, while laudable in itself, is in- volved in great obscurity ; therefore attended with uncertainty for it cannot always be told what is at the far distant end, or very beginning of the line, consequently many mistakes are made. Yet in the majority of cases those of this day and time who can go back to their ancestors who stood boldly, bravely and loyally for the defense of civil and religious liberty in the Revolution of 1776 have every reason to be fully satis- fied with results ; for no people, no nation, ever had a finer race of progenitors than the Americans of these United States. Their record, compared with the average royal line- age, is as white, compared to very deep brown, if not black of a mournful hue. As Lowell says of them : \"God hath sifted the nations for the wheat of this planting.\" Of these, the Scotch-Irish, the last and heaviest sifting, have produced the strongest growth. Little did James Stuart dream when he so carefully selected and transplanted his staunch, Presbyterian, Ayreshire Pedens and their compeers to his barren Irish wastes, that he was merely the tool in the hand of God for the furtherance of the Divine plan, that he 68 TilE FEDEXS OF AMERICA. was promoting the very cause he was striving to eradicate by simplv garnering antl treasuring the golden grain of civil and religious freedom for the planting of the untried fields of the new land with a sturdy race whose influence is now domi- nant. Practical good comes from the new movement, for it in- creases respectful admiration and appreciation approaching reverence for the lives and labors of glorious ancestors, thereby leading to a deeper study of national history. The point, in its modern application, is that every one who can trace his or her line back to any defender of this grand land stands upon the sanie social level, whether that defender was a simple private or a high ol^cer, whether a farm hand or cavalier, whether a carpenter or an aristocrat. The fact that he fought loyally for his country entitled him to equal dis- tinction Avith the most illustrious of his day. The prospect is amazing standing at the dividing line between two centuries a glance backward shows what has come of the past, and a forward look shows the promise of the glorious future. While it is the duty of the present to treat the heroes of the late war well, while they yet live to give them that sympathy and recognition they so well deserve, admire heroism and sacrifice to principle in the fast vanishing veterans, as well as to worship it a century ago. In the bloody civil war the name Pedcn-Paden was written deep with the life-blood of many a young hero \"in the rank and file\" on both sides. It is in honor of this mighty race, now scattered over this glorious Union and in far lands, that this volume is written ; also to rescue the Scotch-Irish-Ameri- can name of Peden from the oblivion which threatens to engulf it, giving it a place beside its compeers among the Scotch-Irish race in America. Of its antiquity as a race there can be no question. As Col. Hooper Alexander and Capt. D. D. Peden, in their able addresses at the great clan reunion, under the ancestral oaks, at Fairview, S. C, in 1899, l:)rought out the strong character and fervid religious nature of the race in the old world, THE FEDEXS OF A^^ERICA. 69 with a few additional side lights thrown from secular history, the threads will be taken up where they laid them down, im- posing the dutiful task of tracing the Peden in the new world and writing an honored name in a book upon the author; therefore wnth considerable trepidation of heart that mighty weapon, the pen, is taken in her woman's hand with the apology in advance that there will be many unintentional mistakes, many missing links, many broken, tangled threads, left to be rectified by some gifted historian of the future, who will gather and garner the truths as they emerge from the depths of the dust covered folios of long forgotten lore, redolent of dead rose leaves, thyme, lavender and cedar of the past. In following the Peden in America through his many wan- derings it was deemed advis.able to appoint a family historian from each of the nine families representing the race. This however has not proven a success generally, and the author has been thrown almost entirely on her own resources, which involved a voluminous correspondence wherever an address was obtained, so if some are left out they will understand it was not the author's intention, for she has certainly a super- abundance of ancestral pride and race love ; therefore \"I have gathered me a posie of other men's flowers, and nothing but the thread that binds them is mine own.\" CHAPTER II. SIDE LIGHTS FKOM SECULAK HXSTOPvY. \"Gently draw aside the curtain of the Past, and gaze reve- rently adown the dim-litten vistas of Time.\" Far back in the misty realms of tradition, ere Time's foot- prints were lighted by the lantern of written history, the human race became divided into three great families or septs. The cradle of man was the elevated plateau of western Asia ; thence they were dispersed eastward, southward, westward. The last migration to leave the cradleland were the great Aryan division, who swept westward with mighty strides of civilization, crossing in time over into Europe after founding tlie Perso-Phenecian races, thence founding the grand colony of ancient Greece. Legend tells that about the time of the call of Abraham, when the race still dwelt in tents, a number of the Aramites began the westward march over the arid plains toward the setting sun, finally settling in Greece where they dwelt in the \"open country because of their great flocks of sheep and cattle.\" These people were called Pedens, or dwellers of the \"open fields,\" and students of patronymics state that the name Peden in all its various changes signifies \"a field.\" Taking up the line of march northward this tribe or sept finally became merged into the Aryan race, eventually forming the great Germanic nation which proved such invin- cible foes to conquering Rome, forming an impassable bar- rier between that all powerful empire and the coveted shores of the northern sea. The story of Arminus orHer- man gives the indomitable love of liberty, so strong in the Peden race, as a marked characteristic in the days of Ceasar as well as of today. All modern students of history and patronymics are agreed that the Scotch-Irish people, so distinctive now, are not, as have been generally received, of Gallic or Celtic origin but of Germanic. A large number of authorities can be quoted bearing on this subject. Suffice it to say that the earliest THE FEDEXS OF A:S[EEICA. 71 trace of the Germanic in the British Isles is in Ireland which being the more fertile land was more attractive to these tent dwellers of the open field than the rugged rock-bound coast of Scotland ; however, it was not long before the narrow channel was crossed and they found permanent hold in Ayr- shire. The surname was a product of the Norman invasion, and the Scot, like the American Indian, derived his from his sur- roundings, his locality. For example the famous name Douglas, under whose leadership many a Peden fought for Scotland's freedom, signifies \"the blackwater\" — the river Clyde. Holmes means the \"low lands\" or land along the margin of streams. Dunbar is from a stone and a barrier, otherwise stonewall. It was an olden custom to call a man John, of Holmes; James, of Douglas; George, of Dunbar; and as Alexander is so emphatically a Peden name it is sup- posable that Alexander, of Peden, was the founder of the race. The saving \"Back to Alexander\" is thus defined. 't> \"Ouehein Alexander our king was dede, That Scotland led in lane and le Alwayes was sons of ale and brede Of wyne and wax, of gamyn and gle,\" ect. The time of Alexander the Third thus alluded to by the earliest Scottish poet corresponds to the days of the Eng- lish Arthur and his table round, and is almost regarded as mythical ; however, there is far better proof of the existence of Alexander than of Arthur. A mystery envelopes the foun- ders of the English monarchy which does not exist regarding the Scottish. \"Thirty kings\" preceded the Bruce, all of whom sleep on the sacred Isle of lona, Macbeth, the Usurper, being the last Culdee king, for the Bruce rings in the Norman blood, and with it the church of Rome, first established by St. Margaret, wife of one of the Alexander fine, which became extinct in the Alaid of Norway. The name Peden existed in the time of the first Alexander, for a shepherd of that name brought the king \"a lammie wrapt 72 THE PEDENS OF AMERICA. in his plaidie.\" The story runneth thus : \"Alexander the good king being wearied from the chase in Ayr loitered be- hind his band, and was lost ; a storm coming tip the king sought shelter of a shepherd's hut or \"shealing.\" The shepherd, ignorant of the rank of his guest and seeing his forlorn state bade him \"rest a wee,\" and wrapping himself in the shepherd's dry plaidie the king lay down and slept a lone while, but was awakened bv savorv odors in the air. His host seeing him awake presented a part of a freshly roasted lamb with a bannock or oaten cake which the king ate eagerlv. He then inquired the name of his h.ost. \"Alexan- der, of Peden,\" was the reply. Then said the good king, \"What dost thou most desire?\" Peden replied \"The free- hold of the stead whereon I dwell.\" Then the king, on fur- ther questioning, discovered that the desired possession was within his gift said, \"On this condition, that from this time forth thou and thv descendants shall hold the stead of Au- chin-by-the-ford by presenting yearly a young lamb to the king of Scotland.\" This was religiously kept until the king- doms were united under James Seventh. Tradition also states that the third Alexander, and the greatest of the line, expired on the breast of \"one faithful yoeman, Paiden of the hags.\" In the year 600 the king of Northumberland applied to the Culdees for men to come and make his country Christian. Oswald, who had been banished to the land of the Picts, was a Culdee, so when restored to his kingdom prayed the church at lona to send one of their num- ber to his court. A man named Conan was sent but he was soon so disgusted with English manners and morals that he retired to the sacred island and his brethren. Then Aidan or Paidan went and devoted his life to the task which Conan had found so distasteful. He taught and toiled among them with great zeal which Oswald the king rewarded and warmly seconded. He was the founder of the little church of Lindis- farne on the bleak Northumbrian shore. These Culdee priests were often married and fathers of families. It is recorded that Duncan the Good was the son THE FEDEXS OF AMERICA. 73 of the Abbot of Dunkeld, and a daughter of Malcolm the Second. It is also stated that a natural son of Alex- ander the First bore the name of Peden and gave his brother the king much trouble. Considering the rude morality of those dark times he possibly had as good right to be king as his brother David. In 1160 the Peden name occurs on a list of Culdees to whom Donald, ninth Earle of Mar, granted land to build a Culdee church. The title of ]\\Iar is the oldest in the English peerage. . \"On the eve of the battle of Bannockburn 'tis said that from out the Scottish host there stepped 'a tall piper of so marvellous likeness to the king that many wondered greatly thereat, and as he doffed his bonnet their wonder increased for the king embraced him warmly' and thus they held each other for a space as though loath to part asunder. Then Ihey walked together out of ear-shot and without the guard, and some of the nobility cast dark glances at the tall, martial figure in the tartan and bonnet with the eagle feather, but the marvel ceased when it was told that the stranger was Peden, of Cadzow, the favorite piper of the king; that he had come hither at the Bruce's desire, for none else in the king- dom could so well play the \"Logan Water\" which was to in- spire the army on the morrow in the desperate battle for liberty against England's chivalry and power. When the sun rose the king rode bare of bonnet in front of the humble Scottish army on a mean, little horse, the Abbot of Dunkeld walking in front holding aloft the cross, the tall piper stalk- ing at the horse's flank the host of Scotland knelt as they passed. The English cried \"Behold, they kneel !\" Their leaders replied, \"Yes, but not to us.\" The stiring notes of the piper followed the prayer. On came the charge.\" The story of Bannockburn has oft been told and need not be re- iterated. It is of the tall piper we sing. \"When the battle was over the tall piper lay stiff and stark on that gory field of carnage. Then came the king, and in the wild abandonment of grief, threw himself on the sward beside the dead corse 74 THE PEDENiS OF A^SIERICA. with the wild lamenta"
