        "text": "NEW YORK, December 18, 2000 â€” Randolph Apperson Hearst, former chairman of The Hearst Corporation, President of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation and sole surviving son of media pioneer William Randolph Hearst, died today at New York Presbyterian Hospital of a massive stroke. He was 85 years old.\n\n\"Randolph Hearst shared his father's strong vision and his abiding passion for the publishing business,\" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., president and chief executive officer of The Hearst Corporation. \"He played a key role in the life of the company founded in 1887 by his father and was, in addition, devoted to many philanthropic endeavors. Moreover, he was a greatly admired colleague and true friend.\"\n\nMr. Hearst, the son of William Randolph and Millicent Willson Hearst, was born in New York City on December 2, 1915.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1996, Mr. Hearst was chairman of the board of The Hearst Corporation, one of the nation's largest diversified communications companies. He continued as chairman emeritus and director of the corporation and a Trustee of the Trust established under the Will of William Randolph Hearst until his death.\n\nThe Hearst Corporation, which was founded by William Randolph Hearst 113 years ago, today publishes some of the world's best-known magazines, including Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan, Harper's Bazaar and Esquire, both domestically and overseas. It also publishes 12 daily newspapers across the United States, owns and operates 26 television stations through its majority ownership in Hearst-Argyle Television, produces and distributes television programming, and is a partner in the ESPN, A&E, The History Channel and Lifetime cable networks.\n\nMr. Hearst began his career as an assistant to the publisher of The Atlanta Georgian in 1939. Two years later, he moved to the San Francisco area to begin a lengthy career on both the business and news sides of newspaper publishing, initially at the San Francisco Call-Bulletin and Oakland Post-Enquirer. He was named publisher of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin in 1950. In the 1950s and 1960s, he held a variety of positions within Hearst, eventually becoming president, director and chief executive officer of Hearst Publishing Company and Hearst Consolidated Publications, Inc.\n\n\"The loss of Randy to our family and the Company will be deeply felt by everyone,\" said George R. Hearst, Jr., chairman of the board of The Hearst Corporation. \"As patriarch of our family, Randy always advocated goodwill, fellowship, and a strong sense of family. He will be missed in so many ways.\" George R. Hearst, Jr., is the nephew of Randolph A. Hearst.\n\nIn 1965, Randolph Hearst became chairman of the executive committee of The Hearst Corporation. In 1972, he added the duties of president of Hearst's San Francisco Examiner Division. He was at the time of his death president and a director of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation and a director of The Hearst Foundation, Inc., both of which are extensively involved in funding educational, medical and cultural activities across the country.\n\nAs part of his many activities with the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, he was a founder of the United States Senate Youth Program, the only youth program endorsed by the U.S. Senate to provide high school juniors and seniors with extensive exposure to American government. In addition, he helped create the Journalism Awards Program, which supports education and excellence in journalism by awarding scholarships to students for outstanding achievement in print, photo and broadcast journalism.\n\nMr. Hearst inherited his grandmother's interest in education. Phoebe Apperson Hearst developed a nationwide network of preschool education centers and was also the co-founder of the Parent Teacher Association (PTA). Randolph Hearst created approximately 40 programs for the improvement of education including computer development, computer networks, early childhood development, early childhood curriculum development, teacher training, the training of parents to prepare children for school and preschool computer curricula for children. In 1996 Mr. Hearst started another initiative, Baby-Steps, in the County and City of Bakersfield, California, involving prenatal programs at hospitals, preschools and kindergartens to commence the child learning process. His interest in bilingual education and concern for minority students earned him an honorary doctorate from the National Hispanic University in San Jose, California.\n\nAmong his many other civic and charitable efforts, he had served on the Board of Advisors of the National Conference of Christians and Jews and the Board of Directors of Partnership for the Arts. He also was a member of the Chairman's Council of both the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the Harold Brunn Society for Medical Research, and of the HEW Advisory Committee on the Education of Spanish and Mexican-Americans, and was a trustee of People to People International.\n\nA graduate of the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, N.J., Mr. Hearst attended Harvard University. He served from 1942 to 1945 in the U.S. Army Air Force, Air Transport Command, attaining the rank of Captain.\n\nRandolph Hearst was the last survivor of William Randolph Hearst's five sons, who include George, William Randolph, Jr., John and Randolph's twin brother David. Mr. Hearst is survived by his wife, Veronica; five daughters, Catherine M. Hill, Virginia Anne Hearst Randt, Patricia Campbell Hearst Shaw, Anne Randolph Hearst, and Victoria Veronica Hearst; and four grandchildren.\n\nChurch services will be held on Wednesday, December 20, at 2:00 p.m. at Saint Vincent Ferrer Church, 869 Lexington Avenue at 66th Street. A memorial service will be held in New York City at a later date. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to The Family Connection Literacy Program, Bakersfield City School District, 1300 Baker Street, Bakersfield, California 93305-4399 (Attn: Jean Fuller)."
