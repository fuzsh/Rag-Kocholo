Jabour - May 25, 1949 - March 29, 2024\n\nDeparted: 03/29/2024 (Troy)\n\nObituary Preview: Joseph A. Jabour (74), of Green Island, New York, passed away on March 29, 2024, at the Cleveland Clinic after several complications with a complex heart surgery. Joseph, fondly known as Joe, was the youngest child born to Joseph and Helen Jabour on May 25, 1949, in Troy, New York. He was a devoted resident of Troy and the Town of Brunswick until moving across the bridge three years ago to Green Island. Joseph was a proud member of the Catholic Central High School Class of 1967. He earned his Associate’s degree from Hudson Valley Community College, and later his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from California Coast University. Joseph held many titles, from Boilermaker to State and Town Employee, but his favorite role was being a husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, and friend. He loved spending time with his grown children and their children. He was always there for them, whether helping them prepare for a job interview or cheering them on at sporting events. Joe’s close-knit family instilled within him love, compassion, and dedicated work values. He was a storyteller. If he caught your ear, you would most likely hear about the NY Yankees, his friends, the lottery numbers he played, and the pizza he made. Joe fought his battle with heart and lung related issues for the past few years. Despite spending time in and out of the hospital recently, he never lost his will to fight so that he could be present for his family. Throughout his life, he faced many obstacles, but overcame any problem he faced with courage and determination. One of Joe’s best qualities was his willingness to step up and help his family and friends in their time of need. He had a strong ability to make others feel safe through action. His support would come with compassion, honest perspective, and his network within the community. Joe’s competitive drive and spirit will be missed. Joe is survived by his loving wife of almost 50 years, Kathryn, and three children, Jack (Paula), Kelly (Derek), and Billy (Katie). He is also survived by his grandchildren Jack, Owen, Collin, Luis, and Eleanor, and great-grandchildren Taytum and Kylo. His sisters, Marsha (Bill) Ernest, Rose (Bill) Wertman, Helen Dundon, and many adoring nieces and nephews also survived him. Joe was predeceased by his parents, Joseph and Helen (Yamin), who welcomed him into their arms after so many years apart, as well as his siblings Solomon Jabour, Diane Sacala, and Elaine Miakisz. Aside from his love of his family, Joe was passionate about giving back to his hometown. He was on the Town of Brunswick Planning Board and active with local and state politics. He positively impacted our community, and he will be genuinely missed.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nSister Patricia McNally, CSJ - March 28, 1944 - March 29, 2024\n\nDeparted: 03/29/2024 (Troy)\n\nObituary Preview: Sister Patricia McNally (formerly Sister Michael Maureen), 80, died on March 29, 2024, in Utica, N.Y., in the 60th year of her religious life. Born in Syracuse, Sister Patricia was the daughter of Henry and Geraldine (Colomb) McNally. She was a member of St. Lucy’s Parish and graduated from St. Lucy’s Academy. On August 6, 1965, Sister Patricia entered the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet. In preparation for her ministry, she earned a Batchelor’s in elementary education from The College of Saint Rose and a Master’s in religious education from St. Michael’s College. From 1969 through 1988, Sister Patricia taught at schools In the Syracuse and Albany Dioceses and also served as a Director of Religious Education. Beginning in 1988, Sister ministered in the Utica-Rome area, enabling her, as she said when celebrating her 50th Jubilee, “to live among and serve those most in need.” She did this at first as Associate Director of Parish Service at Utica Catholic Charities, and then as Counselor and Outreach Director at Rome Catholic Charities. From 1997 until her retirement in 2015, Sister Patricia served at Thea Bowman Day Care Center, a nurturing place that makes daycare and related support activities available for economically-disadvantaged children and families from Utica’s multicultural communities, including immigrants and refugees. Sister Patricia thus practiced the charism of the Sisters of St. Joseph and her personal call to “serve the neighbor without distinction.” In addition to loving and excelling in her service to the “dear neighbor” Sister Patricia also embraced fully her community life with her Sisters of St. Joseph companions for sixty years. In testimony to this she said, “Living in community has strengthened my love of God and has allowed me to share this love with others.” Likewise, her presence among us, always receiving Sister Patricia’s gracious greeting and smile, strengthened our love of God and neighbor. Sister Patricia was predeceased by her parents and her brother, Michael. She is survived by her brother and sister-in-law, Daniel and Anna and their family. She will be greatly missed by them and the Sisters of St. Joseph, especially the Utica CSJ community and Sister’s housemates, Sister Elizabeth Giarrusso and Sister Lynn Abdelnour.
