        "text": "Leaving Morro Bay, little did we realize that as we were headed north the weather would be turning south. Way south. Up until now, we hadn’t exactly been experiencing ideal weather conditions. Certainly nothing close to what I had been hoping for on our entire coastal drive. This was the winter that pulled California out from under its drought conditions. Yes, we had seen plenty of rainy or just overcast days. “Quite unusual . . . nothing like normal,” locals were telling us. There were some good days interspersed, days that teased us with what we were missing . . . days that we filled to the brim with outdoor activities. Just enough good days to keep us from becoming totally exacerbated. That is, until now. Just as we were heading to what I considered to be the best stretch of this entire incredibly scenic drive. Wouldn’t you know . . . sometimes that’s just how the ball bounces.\n\nContinuing north on Hwy. 1, just twenty miles north of Morro Bay, a little jog off the road took us through a small town I thought we should check out. And I wasn’t mistaken. You’d be hard pressed to find a coastal community much prettier than this one, with its stately trees and panoramic ocean views. Set on pine-draped hills above the sea, Cambria (Latin for “Wales”) was settled by Welsh miners in the 1890s. It was a center for lumbering, dairying, mining and shipping for many decades, until artists and other independent types began settling here in the 1970s. The town now caters to tourists, but you can still see evidence of its Bohemian past in small shops, galleries and homes. There are actually two downtowns—the original East Village, and the newer West Village. Both are lined with art and crafts galleries, antique shops, cafes and coffeehouses, and B&Bs. With our interest piqued, we were determined to return. Cambria was worth a longer look.\n\nBut first, setting up camp was in order. There wasn’t much to choose from as far as a campground selection goes. That is, if you’re hoping to stay in this area. Morro Bay is one option, with a nice assortment to choose from. That’s 20 miles south of here. Another option would be Paso Robles. At 28 miles, it has a good assortment of private camps to choose from. At a pretty penny, I might add. The closest option, only 10 miles north, is a state park campground. Divided into two camping areas, one for tents only and the other allowing generators, there’s a maximum RV length limit of 35’. One of the oldest campgrounds in the state park system, what is lacking in amenities (no hookups, only primitive camping), is made up for in its natural surroundings. If you can fit in and you want to be convenient to this exceptionally scenic area, then Hearst San Simeon State Park is definitely your best bet.\n\nSan Simeon Creek Campground has 134 sites of varying sizes. Having good privacy and nicely-spaced, we chose a back-in paved site.\n\nThe coastal bluffs and promontories of this scenic park offer unobstructed views of the ocean and rocky shore. A campground pathway leads to Moonstone Beach, which is good for tidepooling and whale-watching. It’s all about location here, being close to the historic town of San Simeon and the popular tourist destination of Hearst Castle.\n\nBetter weather conditions would have made this an incredible view. But it never happened.\n\nThe big draws here for us were touring Hearst Castle and driving the southern section of Big Sur. With dismal weather forecasted for the foreseeable future, we set aside the day least likely to see rain for the drive. With most of the Hearst Castle experience being indoors, I guess we could do it in the rain—not that we’d like to.\n\nAnd that’s more or less what we got. With some strong, gusty winds thrown in too.\n\nAlthough storm clouds threatened, the morning began without rain. Driving north on the PCH, the rolling hills to the east are a part of the 250,000 acres Hearst’s ranch holdings.\n\nJust off the road is the Hearst Castle Visitor Center, where tickets are purchased, as well as a small café and the ubiquitous gift store. From there, it’s a 5-mile bus ride up to the Castle, where all tours begin. You’ll soon understand why it’s called “La Cuesta Encantada” (The Enchanted Hill).\n\nIn 1958, the Hearst family gifted the castle and much of its contents to the State of California. Today it is a state historical monument, having about one million visitors each year. With numbers like that, it wouldn’t surprise me to learn that most of you have already visited. If it’s still on your Bucket List (as it surely should be), perhaps my photos in this post will inspire you to come check it out. Having toured other famous mansions around the country (Biltmore House in Asheville being a significant one), Chris and I both agree—Hearst Castle is in a class of its own.\n\nLa Casa Grande is the centerpiece of this Enchanted Hill, but to William Randolph Hearst it was simply “the ranch”.\n\nFollowing his mother’s death in 1919, Hearst inherited $11 million as well as the land at San Simeon. That same year he commissioned San Francisco architect Julia Morgan to build “something a little more comfortable up on the hill” than the family’s camping ranch house used for holiday gatherings. What began as a simple home quickly grew into a Spanish Revival mansion. That same year, construction began with three guest ‘cottages’ and, once completed, attention was turned to building Casa Grande. Being more or less a repository for his acquisitions—Hearst was a prolific art and antique buyer–Morgan was challenged to fit these antiquities into the castle’s design and floorplan, which necessitated blending multiple period styles into one harmonious plan. Although construction was never really completed—Hearst would continue to make design changes on the castle until his final departure in 1947, the Hearst family moved into the mansion for Christmas in 1925. Shortly thereafter, Hearst separated from his wife. Up until 1947, Hearst held court at San Simeon with his mistress, actress Marion Davies, and their guest list was a virtual ‘Who’s Who’ of Hollywood stars. By 1947, when Hearst was compelled to leave San Simeon due to his health, Morgan had created an estate of 165 rooms and 127 aces of gardens, terraces, pools and walkways. It was destined to become one of the world’s greatest showplaces for Hearst’s art collection.\n\nFlanking Casa Grande are three much smaller casas, or guest houses. Ranging from 2,500 to 5,300 sq. ft., the casas add an additional 20 guest bedrooms to the overall estate.\n\nHearst’s European tours, which began at an early age and continued throughout his life, and specifically the Iberian Peninsula, were the inspirations that attracted him to Renaissance and Baroque styles of southern Spain. Suiting his tastes and preferences, those are the common themes carried throughout the mansion. Hearst particularly admired a church in Ronda, Spain and asked Morgan to model the Casa Grande towers after it.\n\nThis blend of Southern Spanish Renaissance, Revival and Mediterranean examples became San Simeon’s defining style. “Something a little different than other people are doing out in California” he once stated.\n\nThe logistics for constructing the compound were staggering. Its remote location and isolation, for one. It required an 8-hour train ride for Morgan to come from her San Francisco office, followed by a 50-mile drive over rough roads. Recruiting and retaining a workforce was problematic. Construction material was transported either by train or by sea to a wharf built for the job below the site. Then a light railway was constructed from the wharf to the castle. A compound of warehouses for storage and accommodations for the workers were built on the hill. Accessing a source of water and transporting it to the worksite was a major project within itself. Brick and tile works were developed on site as brick was used extensively in construction and tile was a major component to the castle’s decoration. The climate was a further challenge, as proximity to the coast brought strong winds off the ocean and the castle’s elevation meant that winter storms were frequent and severe. The exact cost of the entire complex is unknown, in part because Hearst used funds from his many companies for the castle’s expenditures. Estimates put it around $10 million.\n\nSit back now and scroll through the following photos . . . highlighting the rooms that particularly caught our attention. And yes, there was a lot of gasping along the way.\n\nThe Assembly Room was huge—around 2,500 sq.ft—as big as many people’s homes. Here Hearst would meet and greet his current guests before convening to the Refectory for dinner.\n\nThe refectory is a term for a monastery’s dining hall. Its high windows, wooden paneling, bright silk banners and silver candlesticks convey the atmosphere of a church from the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Main Library contains over 4,000 books and Hearst’s collection of 150 Etruscan vases, all more than 2,000 years old.\n\nThe Gothic Study is where Hearst began his day reading morning newspapers and meeting with his advisers and board members. Designed to be a practical place to work, the atmosphere nearly bowled me over. The arched ceiling, which commands your immediate attention, looks like wood but is actually painted concrete.\n\nHearst’s bedroom is relatively small and modest. Perhaps it’s on account of sizing it to accommodate the ceiling, which is “one of the most important ceilings on the property. It’s a 15th-century wood ceiling from a palacio in Tereul, Spain. Hearst was also a known workaholic who got by on 4 hours of sleep a night, so perhaps he never spent much time in here.\n\nActress Marion Davies met Hearst in 1918, 15 years after he had married Millicent Willson, with whom they had five sons. Marion was appearing in a film that the media tycoon was bankrolling, and their relationship quickly grew. Millicent would not grant him a divorce without a settlement that Hearst thought too high. Marion lived with Hearst until his death in 1951. She went on to write a book “The Times We Had”, chronicling her life with Hearst, with emphasis on their time at San Simeon.\n\nMarion Davies’ bedroom was adjacent to Hearst’s and adjoined their private sitting room.\n\nMany important guests were invited to Hearst Castle . . . political figures (including Winston Churchill and Calvin Coolidge), literary figures and journalists, and a whole list of notable Hollywood stars. If you were lucky enough to be invited, you could stay as long as you liked. There was a popular saying in Hollywood back in the day that there were two groups of stars: the ones who had been to Hearst Castle and the ones who said they had been to Hearst Castle.\n\nBedrooms decorated with priceless art and antiques, ‘honored guest’ took on a whole new meaning.\n\nThe Doge’s Suite is positively opulent and guests vied for staying in it. It was said that you knew that you had “made it” when you were invited to stay in the Doge’s Suite.\n\nWhen Hearst asked Morgan to find a way to add more guest rooms, she came up with the idea of splitting rooms in half horizontally, so that the balcony above would be the bedroom, while below was the private sitting room and bath. A narrow spiral stairway connected them.\n\nTwo Celestial Suites are nestled just below the bell towers. Seemingly a very poor choice of locations for a bedroom, the ringing wasn’t as loud as you would expect it to be (or so we were told). But be prepared to be a ‘morning person’ if this room was given to you. The windows are made up of patterns to resemble stained glass panels, allowing sun to stream in from quite a few angles, hence the room’s clever name.\n\nBy the time our tours were ending, it was both blustery and rainy outside. So much for my hopes of touring the grounds and seeing the various formal gardens spread out over the Enchanted Hill. But we fought the elements long enough to see the swimming pools—fortunately for us, one was indoors.\n\nThe Neptune pool, located near the edge of the hilltop, is the perfect example of Hearst’s changeability as it was reconstructed 3 complete times before he was happy. For the final change, in 1934, he had it extended long enough to accommodate the Roman temple which flanked it. A statue of Neptune is incorporated into the temple façade, giving the pool its namesake. The temple is a composite of various Roman structures dating from the 1st—4th centuries. Holding 345,000 gallons of water, the pool is 81’ long and 10’ deep; it was heated by oil-fired burners. There are 17 shower and changing rooms under the temple arcade.\n\nThe Roman pool, constructed under the tennis courts, provided an indoor alternative to the Neptune pool. Hand-cut, hand-set glass tiles (of which there are more than a million) from Murano, Italy cover the walls. It took 5 years to do the tilework. During con-struction, Morgan was not on-site, recovering from surgery at home. After an inspection upon her return, she had the workers tear it all out. It looked too perfect. After stripping the glass tiles off the wall and spreading a new layer of thin-set mortar, she directed the workers to punch the walls with their fists so it looked like an ancient building that had since settled. After relaying the tiles, you can now see the undulations in the wall.\n\nFrom just these few photos maybe you have a feel for how jam-packed this castle is with priceless art and architectural features. To see it all in person on a tour, is nothing less than mind-boggling. No surprise that a warehouse had to be built onsite, in which to house all these valuable artifacts.\n\nIn addition to what Hearst purchased on his European travels, a lot more of it was bought at the firm now known as Sotheby’s.\n\nIn the 1920s, the auction house was known as the American Art Association, and they sold expensive works of great historical value. Many of the pieces had relatively inexpensive price tags. After the two World Wars, many European countries were in dire economic straits and sold many of their national treasures. Today, most countries have laws in place to protect items such as these from leaving the country.\n\nVenus Italica is one of the Castle’s greatest masterpieces. Hearst was able to purchase it when auctioned in 1930 from a renowned English collector.\n\nOriginating from a whole range of different sources, the ceilings alone are absolutely breathtaking.\n\nWet and bedraggled, but still basking in the glow of such overwhelming sights, it was late afternoon before we took the bus back down to the Visitor Center. Realizing that we were ravenous, it was good fortune for us that food service had not yet closed down. We snarfed down a healthy amount of food before it was time to take in the film that is available with each ticket purchased.\n\nThe film is nothing short and puny, but rather a professionally done, 40-minute film projected on a 5-story high screen in a theater that seats over 400 people. “Hearst Castle, Building the Dream” chronicles the project from inception to the height of the Castle’s glory day. It is worthwhile and informative, and really puts the finishing touches on whatever tour(s) you choose to take.\n\nNot quite ready to call it a day, with rain still pouring from the sky, we headed back into the visitor center where we spent the next good hour or so taking in the William Randolph Hearst Exhibition. Having seen his Castle where he put so much of himself into its creation, we couldn’t help but want to learn more about the man–his family, his life, his business. This was the place to come . . . for the written information as well as the vintage photos. We were both totally engrossed. And time got away with us. We ended up literally closing down the Center. Even the employees had departed. Fortunately, we were not locked in.\n\nAs if to prove that every cloud can have a silver lining, as late afternoon came on the rains subsided. As only a moment of good fortune can sometimes bring, the sun broke through the heavy clouds and where else would the shaft of light fall but on that Enchanted Hill?\n\nFor once, I had my camera ready.\n\nAs predicted, the rains returned the following day, with the looks that it would hang on throughout the day . . . in an on-and-off kind of way. No Big Sur Drive for us today, instead we headed back to see more of Cambria. Dropping in to peruse quaint shops and galleries helped to take our thoughts off of what else we’d rather be doing. A great home-cooked meal helped to lift our spirits; we would both highly recommend Linn’s for a top-rated place to eat in Cambria. (The desserts are all incredibly, mouth-watering delicious! And what an excellent selection too!)\n\nWhat I consider to be the highlight of the Cambria area (ruling out a good meal with dessert at Linn’s) has everything to do with its wonderful natural setting. Having said that, perhaps you are better able to realize the pain I was feeling on this day I had such high hopes for.\n\n“The Fiscalini Ranch Preserve in Cambria is a wonderful 430-acre space right on the coast. Little known, it is a gem on the Central Coast. Easy hiking trails afford gorgeous views of unspoiled California coastline.”\n\nJust the words to get my heart pounding. What a coup to come across . . . but unfortunately the weather gods weren’t favoring me. Having views with such potential . . . can you imagine the sunsets from here??? Connecting it all within sight of the water, is the mile-long Bluff Trail. It’s an easy and level coastal walk, where “ocean views are superb, flowers are abundant, and there are even opportunities to observe wildlife.” Aarrrgh! Can you feel my pain?\n\nPart of the trail includes a boardwalk, making for an easier hike without impacting the natural landscape.\n\nYou won’t have to walk very far in the park to realize how fortunate it was that this land was saved. Formerly a dairy, the land was destined to be developed until the people of the area stepped in and bought the property.\n\nAnd so, it was one of those bittersweet moments when we pulled into the Preserve. So much potential! So little light! Still, I found a mystic beauty in the scenery spread out before me. Grabbing my camera, I headed out, to do the best with what I’d been given.\n\nDespite the atmospheric elements, one could say our time here had been . . . impressive. Certainly informative. Definitely interesting. “Don’t fret the small stuff” is a good motto to travel by. And, it surely applies to us now.\n\nTomorrow I might not have such an optimistic outlook . . . if conditions don’t improve. It remains to be seen.\n\nBut for now, memories of yesterday are still fresh in my mind’s eye.\n\n“I love this ranch. It is wonderful. I love the sea and I love the mountains and the hollows in the hills and the shady places in the creeks and the fine old oaks and even the hot brushy hillsides . . . I would rather spend a month here than any place in the world.”\n\n~William Randolph Hearst, in a letter to his mother.\n\nAirstream Travelers, Melinda & Chris\n\nhoping for better weather."
