The card, which has a divided back, was designed and distributed in the USA, and printed in Korea on  recycled paper. The photography was by Dean Hurd.\n\t\n\t<u>Hearst Castle - The Four Images</u>\n\t\n\tThe following has been printed on the divided back of the card:\n\t\n\t'Top Left -- William Randolph Hearst\n\tand architect Julia Morgan review\n\tplans on site - Courtesy Boston\n\tArchives.\n\t\n\tTop Right -- One of many early sketches\n\tby Julia Morgan of Casa Grande -- \n\tCourtesy Special Collections, Cal Poly.\n\t\n\tBottom Left -- Casa Grande and the fourth\n\tfloor Celestial Suite under construction in\n\t1924.\n\t\n\tBottom Right -- Aerial View of Hearst \n\tCastle as it looks today.'\n\t\n\t<u>Hearst Castle</u>\n\t\n\tHearst Castle, known formally as La Cuesta Encantada (&quot;The Enchanted Hill&quot;), is an estate in San Simeon, located on the Central Coast of California. Conceived by William Randolph Hearst, the publishing tycoon, and his architect Julia Morgan, the castle was built between 1919 and 1947. \n\t\n\tGeorge Bernard Shaw described Hearst Castle as:\n\t\n\t&quot;What God would have built\n\tif he had had the money.&quot;\n\t\n\tToday, Hearst Castle is a museum open to the public as a California State Park and registered as a National Historic Landmark and California Historical Landmark.\n\t\n\tGeorge Hearst, William Randolph Hearst's father, had purchased the original 40,000-acre (162 km2) estate in 1865 and Camp Hill, the site for the future Hearst Castle, was used for family camping vacations during Hearst's youth. \n\t\n\tIn 1919 William inherited $11,000,000 (equivalent to $172,000,000 in 2021) and estates, including the land at San Simeon. He used his fortune to further develop his media empire of newspapers, magazines and radio stations, the profits from which supported a lifetime of building and collecting. \n\t\n\tWithin a few months of Phoebe Hearst's death, he had commissioned Morgan to:\n\t\n\t&quot;Build something a little more \n\tcomfortable up on the hill.&quot; \n\t\n\tThis was the genesis of the present castle. Morgan was an architectural pioneer:\n\t\n\t&quot;America's first truly independent \n\tfemale architect.&quot; \n\t\n\tShe was the first woman to study architecture at the School of Beaux-Arts in Paris, the first to have her own architectural practice in California, and the first female winner of the American Institute of Architects' Gold Medal. \n\t\n\tJulia worked in close collaboration with Hearst for over twenty years, and the castle at San Simeon is her best-known creation.\n\t\n\tIn the Roaring Twenties and into the 1930's, Hearst Castle reached its social peak. Originally intended as a family home for Hearst, his wife Millicent and their five sons, by 1925 he and Millicent had effectively separated and he held court at San Simeon with his mistress, the actress Marion Davies. \n\t\n\tTheir guest list comprised most of the Hollywood stars of the period; Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, the Marx Brothers, Greta Garbo, Buster Keaton, Mary Pickford, Jean Harlow and Clark Gable all visited, some on multiple occasions. \n\t\n\tPolitical luminaries encompassed Calvin Coolidge and Winston Churchill, while other notables included Charles Lindbergh, P. G. Wodehouse and George Bernard Shaw. \n\t\n\tVisitors gathered each evening at Casa Grande for drinks in the Assembly Room, dined in the Refectory and watched the latest movie in the theater before retiring to the luxurious accommodation provided by the guest houses of Casa del Mar, Casa del Monte and Casa del Sol. \n\t\n\tDuring the days, they admired the views, rode, played tennis, bowls or golf and swam in &quot;the most sumptuous swimming pool on earth&quot;. \n\t\n\tWhile Hearst entertained, Morgan built; the castle was under almost continual construction from 1920 until 1939, with work resuming after the end of World War II until Hearst's final departure in 1947.\n\t\n\tHearst, his castle and his lifestyle were satirized by Orson Welles in his 1941 film Citizen Kane. In the film, which Hearst sought to suppress, Charles Foster Kane's palace Xanadu is said to contain:\n\t\n\t&quot;Paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones \n\tof many another palace – a collection of \n\teverything so big it can never be cataloged \n\tor appraised; enough for ten museums; the \n\tloot of the world&quot;. \n\t\n\tWelles's was referring to Hearst's mania for collecting; the dealer Joseph Duveen called him the &quot;Great Accumulator&quot;. \n\t\n\tWith a passion for acquisition almost from childhood, he bought architectural elements, art, antiques, statuary, silverware and textiles on an epic scale. Shortly after starting San Simeon, he began to conceive of making the castle:\n\t\n\t&quot;A museum of the best\n\tthings that I can secure&quot;.\n\t\n\tForemost among his purchases were architectural elements from Western Europe, particularly Spain. Over thirty ceilings, doorcases, fireplaces and mantels, entire monasteries, paneling and a medieval tithe barn were purchased, shipped to Hearst's Brooklyn warehouses and transported on to California. \n\t\n\tMuch was then incorporated into the fabric of Hearst Castle. In addition, he built up collections of more conventional art and antiques of high quality; his assemblage of ancient Greek vases was one of the world's largest.\n\t\n\tIn May 1947, Hearst's health compelled him and Marion Davies to leave the castle for the last time. He died in Los Angeles in 1951, and Morgan died in 1957. The following year, the Hearst family gave the castle and much of its contents to the State of California, and the mansion was opened to the public on the 17th. May 17, 1958. \n\t\n\tIt has since operated as the Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument, and attracts about 750,000 visitors annually. \n\t\n\tThe Hearst family retains ownership of the majority of the 82,000 acres (332 km2) wider estate and, under a land conservation agreement reached in 2005, has worked with the California State Parks Department and American Land Conservancy to preserve the undeveloped character of the area. \n\t\n\t<u>Early History to 1864</u>\n\t\n\tThe coastal range of Southern California has been occupied since prehistoric times. The indigenous inhabitants were the Salinans and the Chumash. In the late 18th. century, Spanish missions were established in the area in order to convert the Native American population. \n\t\n\tThe Mission San Miguel Arcángel, one of the largest, opened in what is now San Luis Obispo county in 1797. By the 1840's, the mission had declined and the priests departed. In that decade, the governors of Mexican California distributed the mission lands in a series of grants. \n\t\n\tThree of these were Rancho Piedra Blanca, Rancho Santa Rosa and Rancho San Simeon. The Mexican–American War of 1846–1848 saw the area pass into the control of the United States under the terms of the Mexican Cession. The California Gold Rush of the next decade brought an influx of American settlers, among whom was the 30-year old George Hearst.\n\t\n\t<u>Buying the land: 1865–1919</u>\n\t\n\tBorn in Missouri in 1820, George Hearst made his fortune as a miner of gold and silver, notably at the Comstock Lode and the Homestake Mine. He then undertook a political career, becoming a senator in 1886, and bought The San Francisco Examiner. \n\t\n\tInvesting in land, he bought the Piedra Blanca property in 1865, and subsequently extended his holdings with the acquisition of most of the Santa Rosa estate, and much of the San Simeon lands. \n\t\n\tIn the 1870's George Hearst built a ranch house on his estate, which remains a private property maintained by the Hearst Corporation. The San Simeon area became a site for family camping expeditions, including his young son, William. A particularly favored spot was named Camp Hill, the site of the future Hearst Castle. \n\t\n\tYears later Hearst recalled his early memories of the place:\n\t\n\t&quot;My father brought me to San Simeon \n\tas a boy. I had to come up the slope \n\thanging on to the tail of a pony. \n\tWe lived in a cabin on this spot and I \n\tcould see forever. That's the West – \n\tforever.&quot; \n\t\n\tGeorge Hearst developed the estate somewhat, introducing beef and dairy cattle, planting extensive fruit orchards, and expanding the wharf facilities at San Simeon Bay. He also bred racehorses. \n\t\n\tWhile his father developed the ranch, Hearst and his mother traveled, including an eighteen-month tour of Europe in 1873, where Hearst's life-long obsession with art collecting began.\n\t\n\tWhen George Hearst died in 1891, he left an estate of $18 million to his widow including the California ranch. Phoebe Hearst shared the cultural and artistic interests of her son, collecting art and patronizing architects. \n\t\n\tShe was also a considerable philanthropist, founding schools and libraries, supporting the fledgling University of California, Berkeley, including the funding of the Hearst Mining Building in memory of her husband, and making major donations to a range of women's organizations, including the YWCA. \n\t\n\tDuring the late 1890's, Mrs Hearst encountered Julia Morgan, a young architecture student at Berkeley. On Phoebe Hearst's death in 1919, William Hearst inherited the ranch, which had grown to 250,000 acres and 14 miles (23 km) of coastline, as well as $11 million. \n\t\n\t250,000 acres is a huge area for an estate - to accommodate that area in a square, it would need sides of over 19.8 miles (32 km). \n\t\n\tWithin days of his mother's death, William was at Morgan's San Francisco office.\n\t\n\t<u>Julia Morgan</u>\n\t\n\tJulia Morgan, who was born in 1872, was 47 when Hearst entered her office in 1919. Her biographer Mark A. Wilson has described her subsequent career as that of:\n\t\n\t&quot;America's first independent \n\tfull-time woman architect&quot;. \n\t\n\tAfter studying at Berkeley, where she worked with Bernard Maybeck, and in 1898 she became the first woman to win entry to the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Passing out from the École in 1902, Morgan returned to San Francisco and took up a post at the architectural practice of John Galen Howard. \n\t\n\tHoward recognized Morgan's talents, but also exploited them:\n\t\n\t&quot;The best thing about this person \n\tis, I pay her almost nothing, as it is \n\ta woman.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn 1904, Julia passed the California architects' licensing examination, the first woman to do so, establishing her own office in 1906 at 456 Montgomery Street in San Francisco.\n\t\n\tDuring her time with Howard, Morgan was commissioned by Phoebe Hearst to undertake work at her Hacienda del Pozo de Verona estate at Pleasanton. This led to work at Wyntoon and to a number of commissions from Hearst himself; an unexecuted design for a mansion at Sausalito, north of San Francisco, a cottage at the Grand Canyon, and the Los Angeles Examiner Building.\n\t\n\tIn 1919, when he turned up at Morgan's office, Hearst was fifty-six years old, and the owner of a publishing empire that included twenty-eight newspapers, thirteen magazines, eight radio stations, four film studios, extensive real-estate holdings and thirty-one thousand employees. \n\t\n\tHe was also a significant public figure: although his political endeavors had proved largely unsuccessful, the influence he exerted through his direct control of his media empire attracted fame and opprobrium in equal measure. \n\t\n\tIn 1917, one biographer described him as:\n\t\n\t&quot;The most hated man \n\tin the country&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe actor Ralph Bellamy, a guest at San Simeon in the mid-1930's, recorded Hearst's working methods in a description of a party in the Assembly Room: \n\t\n\t&quot;The party was quite gay. And in the midst of it, \n\tMr Hearst came in. There was a teletype machine\n\tjust inside, and he stopped and he read it. \n\tHe went to a table and picked up a phone. \n\tHe asked for the editor of his San Francisco \n\tnewspaper and he said, 'Put this in a two-column \n\tbox of the front pages of all the newspapers \n\ttomorrow morning.' \n\tAnd without notes he dictated an editorial.&quot;\n\t\n\tMorgan and Hearst's partnership at San Simeon lasted from 1919 until his final departure from the castle in 1947. Their correspondence, preserved in the Julia Morgan archive in the Robert E. Kennedy Library at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, runs to some 3,700 letters and telegrams. \n\t\n\tVictoria Kastner, Hearst Castle's in-house custodian, has described the partnership as &quot;a rare, true collaboration,&quot; and there are many contemporary accounts of the closeness of the relationship. Walter Steilberg, a draughtsman in Morgan's office, once observed them at dinner: \n\t\n\t&quot;The rest of us could have been a \n\thundred miles away; they didn't pay \n\tany attention to anybody ... these \n\ttwo very different people just clicked&quot;. \n\t\n\tThomas Aidala, in his 1984 history of the castle, made a similar observation: \n\t\n\t&quot;Seated opposite each other, they \n\twould discuss and review work, \n\tconsider design changes, pass \n\tdrawings back and forth ... seemingly \n\toblivious of the rest of the guests.&quot;\n\t\n\t<u>Having a Ball: 1925–1938</u>\n\t\n\tHearst and his family occupied Casa Grande for the first time at Christmas, 1925. Thereafter, Hearst's wife, Millicent, went back to New York, and from 1926 until they left for the last time in 1947, Hearst's mistress Marion Davies acted as his chatelaine at the castle. \n\t\n\tThe Hollywood and political elite often visited in the 1920's and 1930's. Among Hearst's guests were Calvin Coolidge, Winston Churchill, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, the Marx Brothers, Charles Lindbergh, and Clark Gable. \n\t\n\tChurchill described his host, and Millicent Hearst and Davies, in a letter to his own wife:\n\t\n\t&quot;A grave simple child – with no doubt a \n\tnasty temper – playing with the most \n\tcostly toys. \n\tTwo magnificent establishments, two \n\tcharming wives, complete indifference \n\tto public opinion, oriental hospitalities.&quot; \n\t\n\tWeekend guests were either brought by private train from Glendale Station north of Los Angeles, and then by car to the castle, or flew into Hearst's airstrip, generally arriving late on Friday evening or on Saturday. Cecil Beaton wrote of his impressions during his first visit for New Year's Eve in 1931: \n\t\n\t&quot;We caught sight of a vast, sparkling white \n\tcastle in Spain. It was out of a fairy story. \n\tThe sun poured down with theatrical \n\tbrilliance on tons of white marble and white \n\tstone. \n\tThere seemed to be a thousand statues, \n\tpedestals, urns. The flowers were unreal in \n\ttheir ordered profusion. \n\tHearst stood smiling at the top of one of \n\tthe many flights of garden steps&quot;.\n\t\n\tGuests were generally left to their own devices during the day. Horseback riding, shooting, swimming, golf, croquet and tennis were all available, while Hearst would lead mounted parties for picnics on the estate. The only absolute deadline was for cocktails in the assembly room at 7.30 on Saturday night. \n\t\n\tAlcohol was rationed; guests were not permitted to have liquor in their rooms, and were limited to one cocktail each before dinner. This was due not to meanness on Hearst's part, but to his concerns over Davies's alcoholism, though the rule was frequently flouted. \n\t\n\tThe actor David Niven later reflected on his supplying illicit alcohol to Davies:\n\t\n\t&quot;It seemed fun at the time to stoke up \n\ther fire of outrageous fun and I got a \n\tkick out of feeling I had outwitted one \n\tof the most powerful and best informed \n\tmen on earth, but what a disloyal and \n\tcrummy betrayal of him, and what a \n\tnasty potential nail to put in her coffin.&quot;\n\t\n\tDinner was served at 9.00 in the refectory. Wine came from Hearst's 7,000-bottle cellar. Charlie Chaplin commented on the fare:\n\t\n\t&quot;Dinners were elaborate -- pheasant, wild \n\tduck, partridge and venison --  but were \n\talso informal: amidst the opulence, we \n\twere served paper napkins, it was only \n\twhen Mrs Hearst was in residence that \n\tthe guests were given linen ones.&quot; \n\t\n\tThe informality extended to the ketchup bottles and condiments in jars which were remarked on by many guests.\n\t\n\tDinner was invariably followed by a movie; initially outside, and then in the theater. The actress Ilka Chase recorded a showing in the early 1930's:\n\t\n\t&quot;The theater was not yet complete – the plaster \n\twas still wet – so an immense pile of fur coats \n\twas heaped at the door, and each guest picked \n\tone up and enveloped himself before entering...\n\tHearst and Marion, close together in the gloom \n\tand bundled in their fur coats, looked for all the \n\tworld like the big and baby bears&quot;. \n\t\n\tMovies were generally films from Hearst's own studio, Cosmopolitan Productions, and often featured Marion Davies. Sherman Eubanks, whose father worked as an electrician at the castle, recorded in an oral history: \n\t\n\t&quot;Mr Hearst would push a button and call up to \n\tthe projectionist and say 'Put on Marion's Peg \n\to' My Heart'. \n\tSo I've seen Peg o' My Heart about fifty times. \n\tThis is not being critical. I'm simply saying that's \n\tthe way it was. This repetition tended to put a \n\tslight strain on the guests' gratitude.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn 1937, Patricia Van Cleeve married at the castle, the grandest social occasion there since the visit of President and Mrs Coolidge in February 1930. Ken Murray records these two events as the only occasions when formal attire was required of guests to the castle. \n\t\n\tVan Cleeve, who married the actor Arthur Lake, was always introduced as Marion Davies' favorite niece. It was frequently rumored that she was in fact Davies and Hearst's daughter, something she herself acknowledged just before her death in 1993. \n\t\n\tIn February 1938, a plane crash at the San Simeon airstrip led to the deaths of Lord and Lady Plunket, who were traveling to the castle as Hearst's guests, and the pilot Tex Phillips. The only other passenger, the bobsledding champion, James Lawrence, survived.\n\t\n\t<u>The Specter at the Feast: Hearst, Welles and Xanadu</u>\n\t\n\tHearst Castle was the inspiration for Xanadu, and Hearst himself the main model for Charles Foster Kane in Orson Welles's 1941 film Citizen Kane. \n\t\n\tHaving made his name with the Mercury Theatre production of The War of the Worlds in 1938, Welles arrived in Hollywood in 1939 to make a film version of Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness for RKO Pictures. \n\t\n\tThe film was not made, and Welles began a collaboration with the screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz on a screenplay originally entitled American. The film tells the stories of Kane, a media magnate and aspiring politician, and of his second wife Susan Alexander, a failed opera singer driven to drink, who inhabit a castle in Florida.  \n\t\n\tFilming began in June 1940, and the movie premiered on the 1st. June 1941. Although at the time Orson Welles and RKO denied that the film was based on Hearst, his long-time friend and collaborator, John Houseman was clear:\n\t\n\t&quot;The truth is simple: for the basic concept \n\tof Charles Foster Kane and for the main \n\tlines and significant events of his public life, \n\tMankiewicz used as his model the figure of \n\tWilliam Randolph Hearst&quot;. \n\t\n\tTold of the film's content before its release – his friends, the gossip columnists Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons having attended early screenings – Hearst made strenuous efforts to stop the premiere. When these failed, he sought to damage the film's circulation by alternately forbidding all mention of it in his media outlets, or by using them to attack both the movie and Welles. \n\t\n\tHearst's assault damaged the film at the box office, and harmed Welles' subsequent career. \n\t\n\tSince its inception in 1952 through to 2012, the Sight and Sound Critics' Poll voted Citizen Kane the greatest film of all time in every decade of polling. On the 9th. March 2012 the film was screened in the movie theater at Hearst Castle for the first time as part of the San Luis Obispo International Film Festival.\n\t\n\t<u>Depression, Death and After: 1939–Present</u>\n\t\n\tBy the late 1930's, the Great Depression and Hearst's profligacy had brought him to the brink of financial ruin. Debts totaled $126 million, and he was compelled to cede financial control of the Hearst Corporation. Newspapers and radio stations were sold, and much of his art collection was dispersed in a series of sales, often for much less than he had paid. \n\t\n\tHearst railed against his losses, and the perceived incompetence of the sales agents, Parish-Watson &amp; Co: \n\t\n\t&quot;They greatly cheapened them and us, \n\the advertises like a bargain basement \n\tsale. I am heartbroken&quot;. \n\t\n\tConstruction at Hearst Castle virtually ceased. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the castle was closed up and Hearst and Davies moved to Wyntoon, which was perceived to be less vulnerable to enemy attack. \n\t\n\tThey returned in 1945, and construction on a limited scale recommenced, finally ending in 1947. In early May of that year, with his health declining, Hearst and Davies left the castle for the last time. The pair settled in at 1007 North Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills. \n\t\n\tWilliam Randolph Hearst died in 1951, his death abruptly severing him from Davies, who was excluded from the funeral by Hearst's family:\n\t\n\t&quot;For thirty-two years I had him, \n\tand they leave me with his \n\tempty room&quot;. \n\t\n\tIn 1950 Julia Morgan closed her San Francisco office after a career of forty-two years. Ill health marred her retirement and she died, a virtual recluse, in early 1957.\n\t\n\tIn 1958 the Hearst Corporation donated Hearst Castle, its gardens, and many of its contents, to the state of California. A plaque at the castle reads: \n\t\n\t&quot;La Cuesta Encantada presented to \n\tthe State of California in 1958 by the \n\tHearst Corporation in memory of \n\tWilliam Randolph Hearst who created \n\tthis Enchanted Hill, and of his mother, \n\tPhoebe Apperson Hearst, who \n\tinspired it&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe castle was opened to the public for the first time in June 1958. Hearst Castle was added to the National Register of Historic Places on the 22nd. June.\n\t\n\tHearst was always keen to protect the mystique of his castle. In 1926, he wrote to Morgan to congratulate her after a successful party was held on the hill: \n\t\n\t&quot;Those wild movie people said it was \n\twonderful and that the most extravagant \n\tdream of a movie picture fell far short of \n\tthis reality. They all wanted to make a \n\tpicture there but they are NOT going to \n\tbe allowed to do this.&quot; \n\t\n\tCommercial filming at the castle is still rarely allowed. Since 1957 only two projects have been granted permission:\n\t\n\t-- Stanley Kubrick's 1960 film Spartacus used the castle to stand in as the villa of Marcus Licinius Crassus, played by Lawrence Olivier.  \n\t\n\t-- In 2014, Lady Gaga's music video for &quot;G.U.Y.&quot; was filmed at the Neptune and Roman Pools.\n\t\n\tOn the 12th. February 1976, the Casa del Sol guesthouse was damaged by a bomb. The device was placed by allies of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), in retaliation for Patty Hearst, Hearst's granddaughter, testifying in court at her trial for armed robbery, following her kidnapping by the SLA in 1974. \n\t\n\tOn the 22nd. December 2003, an earthquake occurred with its epicenter some three miles north of the castle. With a magnitude of 6.5, it was the largest earthquake recorded at San Simeon. The very limited structural damage which resulted was a testament to the quality of the castle's construction. \n\t\n\tSince its opening, the castle has become a major California tourist attraction, attracting over 850,000 visitors in 2018. Recent changes to the tour arrangements now allow visitors time to explore the grounds independently at the conclusion of the conducted tours. \n\t\n\tThe Hearst family maintains a connection with the castle, which was closed for a day in early August 2019 for the wedding of Amanda Hearst, Hearst's great-granddaughter.\n\t\n\tThe castle closed in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After 2 years of closure and repairs to the access road due to rainstorm damage, the castle reopened on the 11th. May 2022.\n\t\n\t<u>Architecture of Hearst Castle</u>\n\t\n\tHearst's original idea was to build a bungalow, according to Walter Steilberg, one of Morgan's draftsmen who recalled Hearst's words from the initial meeting: \n\t\n\t&quot;I would like to build something up on \n\tthe hill at San Simeon. I get tired of \n\tgoing up there and camping in tents. \n\tI'm getting a little too old for that. \n\tI'd like to get something that would \n\tbe a little more comfortable&quot;.\n\t\n\tHowever within a month, Hearst's original ideas for a modest dwelling had greatly expanded. Discussion on the style began with consideration of &quot;Jappo-Swisso&quot; themes. Then the Spanish Colonial Revival style was favored. Morgan had used this style when she worked on Hearst's Los Angeles Herald Examiner headquarters in 1915. \n\t\n\tHearst appreciated the Spanish Revival but was dissatisfied with the crudeness of the colonial structures in California. Mexican colonial architecture had more sophistication, but he objected to its abundance of ornamentation. \n\t\n\tThomas Aidala, in his 1984 study of the castle, notes the Churrigueresque influence on the design of the main block:\n\t\n\t&quot;Flat and unembellished exterior surfaces; \n\tdecorative urges are particularized and \n\tisolated, focused mainly on doorways, \n\twindows and towers&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 in San Diego held the closest approximations in California to the approach Hearst desired. But William's European tours, and specifically the inspiration of the Iberian Peninsula, led him to Renaissance and Baroque examples in southern Spain that more exactly suited his tastes. He particularly admired a church in Ronda, Spain and asked Morgan to model the Casa Grande towers after it. \n\t\n\tIn a letter to Morgan dated 31st. December 1919, Hearst wrote:\n\t\n\t&quot;The San Diego Exposition is the best source \n\tof Spanish in California. The alternative is to \n\tbuild in the Renaissance style of southern Spain. \n\tWe picked out the towers of the church at Ronda... \n\ta Renaissance decoration, particularly that of the \n\tvery southern part of Spain, could harmonize well \n\twith them. \n\tI would very much like to have your views on what \n\tstyle of architecture we should select.&quot; \n\t\n\tThis blend of Southern Spanish Renaissance, Revival and Mediterranean examples became San Simeon's defining style:\n\t\n\t&quot;Something a little different than other \n\tpeople are doing out in California&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe architectural writers Arrol Gellner and Douglas Keister describe Casa Grande as \n\t\n\t&quot;A palatial fusion of Classicism and Mediterranean \n\tarchitecture that transcended the Mission Revival \n\tera and instead belonged to the more archaeological \n\tPeriod Revival styles that gained favor after the \n\tPanama-California Exposition of 1915&quot;.\n\t\n\tHearst Castle has a total of 42 bedrooms, 61 bathrooms, 19 sitting rooms, 127 acres (half a square kilometer) of gardens, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis courts, a movie theater, an airfield and, during Hearst's lifetime, the world's largest private zoo. \n\t\n\tHearst was an inveterate rethinker who would frequently order the redesign of previously agreed, and often built, structures: the Neptune Pool was rebuilt three times before he was satisfied. \n\t\n\tHe was aware of his propensity for changing his mind; in a letter dated the 18th. March 1920, he wrote to Morgan: \n\t\n\t&quot;All little houses stunning. Please complete \n\tbefore I can think up any more changes&quot;. \n\t\n\tAs a consequence of Hearst's persistent design changes, and financial difficulties in the early and later 1930's, the complex was never finished. \n\t\n\tBy the late summer of 1919, Morgan had surveyed the site, analyzed its geology, and drawn initial plans for Casa Grande. Construction began in 1919 and continued through 1947 when Hearst left the estate for the last time. \n\t\n\tDuring the early years of construction, until Hearst's stays at San Simeon became longer and more frequent, his approval for the ongoing design was obtained by Morgan sending him models of planned developments. \n\t\n\tBy the late 1920's the main model, designed by another female architect Julian C. Mesic, had become too large to ship, and Mesic and Morgan would photograph it, hand-color the images, and send these to Hearst.\n\t\n\t<u>Construction of Hearst Castle</u>\n\t\n\tThe castle's location presented major challenges for construction. It was remote; when Morgan began coming to the estate for site visits in 1919, she would leave her San Francisco office on Friday afternoon and take an eight-hour, 200-mile train journey to San Luis Obispo, followed by a fifty-mile drive to San Simeon. \n\t\n\tThe relative isolation made recruiting and retaining a workforce a constant difficulty. In the early years, the estate lacked water, its limited supplies coming from three natural springs on Pine Mountain, a 3,500-foot-high (1,100 m) peak seven miles (11 km) east of Hearst Castle. \n\t\n\tThe issue was addressed by the construction of three reservoirs, and Morgan devised a gravity-based water delivery system that transported water from the nearby mountain springs to the reservoirs, including the main one on Rocky Butte, a 2,000-foot (610 m) knoll less than a mile southeast of Hearst Castle. \n\t\n\tWater was of particular importance; as well as feeding the pools and fountains Hearst desired, it provided electricity, by way of a private hydroelectric plant, until the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation began service to the castle in 1924. \n\t\n\tThe climate presented a further challenge. The proximity to the coast brought strong winds in from the Pacific Ocean, and the site's elevation meant that winter storms were frequent and severe.\n\t\n\tAfter a period of severe storms in February 1927, Hearst wrote a letter:\n\t\n\t&quot;We are all leaving the hill. We are drowned, \n\tblown and frozen out. Before we build anything \n\tmore, let's make what we have practical, \n\tcomfortable and beautiful. \n\tIf we can't do that we might just as well change \n\tthe names of the houses to Pneumonia House, \n\tDiphtheria House and Influenza Bungalow. \n\tThe main house we can call the Clinic.&quot;\n\t\n\tWater was also essential for the production of concrete, the main structural component of the houses and their ancillary buildings. \n\t\n\tMorgan had substantial experience of building in steel-reinforced concrete and, together with the firm of consulting engineers Earl and Wright, experimented in finding suitable stone, eventually settling on that quarried from the mountain top on which the foundation platform for the castle was built.\n\t\n\tCombining this with desalinated sand from San Simeon Bay produced concrete of exceptionally high quality. Later, white sand was brought in from Carmel. Material for construction was transported either by train and truck, or by sea into a wharf built in San Simeon Bay below the site. In time, a light railway was constructed from the wharf to the castle, and Morgan built a compound of warehouses for storage and accommodation for workers by the bay. \n\t\n\tBrick and tile works were also developed on site, as brick was used extensively, and tiling was an important element of the decoration of the castle. Morgan used several tile companies to produce her designs, including Grueby Faience, Batchelder, California Faience and Solon &amp; Schemmel. \n\t\n\tAlbert Solon and Frank Schemmel came to Hearst Castle to undertake tiling work, and Solon's brother, Camille, was responsible for the design of the mosaics of blue-and-gold Venetian glass tile used in the Roman pool and the murals in Hearst's Gothic library.\n\t\n\tMorgan worked with a series of construction managers; Henry Washburn from 1919 to 1922, then Camille Rossi from 1922, until his firing by Hearst in 1932, and finally George Loorz until 1940. From 1920 to 1939, there were between 25 and 150 workmen employed in construction at the castle.\n\t\n\t<u>Costs of Hearst Castle</u>\n\t\n\tThe exact cost of the entire San Simeon complex is unknown. Kastner makes an estimate of expenditure on construction and furnishing the complex between 1919 and 1947 as &quot;under $10,000,000&quot;. \n\t\n\tThomas Aidala suggests a slightly more precise figure for the overall cost at between $7.2 and $8.2 million. Hearst's relaxed approach to using the funds of his companies, and sometimes the companies themselves, to make personal purchases made clear accounting for expenditure almost impossible. \n\t\n\tIn 1927 one of his lawyers wrote:\n\t\n\t&quot;The entire history of your corporation \n\tshows an informal method of withdrawal \n\tof funds&quot;. \n\t\n\tIn 1945, when the Hearst Corporation was closing the Hearst Castle account for the final time, Morgan gave a breakdown of construction costs, which did not include expenditure on antiques and furnishings. \n\t\n\tCasa Grande's build cost is given as $2,987,000, and that for the guest houses, $500,000. Other works, including nearly half a million dollars on the Neptune pool, brought the total to $4,717,000. \n\t\n\tMorgan's fees for twenty-odd years of almost continuous work came to $70,755. Her initial fee was a 6% commission on total costs. This was later increased to 8.5%. Many additional expenses, and challenges in getting prompt payment, led her to receive rather less than this. \n\t\n\tKastner suggests that Morgan made an overall profit of $100,000 on the entire, twenty-year, project. Her modest remuneration was unimportant to her. At the height of Hearst's financial travails in the late 1930's, when his debts stood at over $87 million, Morgan wrote to him, \n\t\n\t&quot;I wish you would use me in any way \n\tthat relieves your mind as to the care \n\tof your belongings. There never has \n\tbeen, nor will there be, any charge in \n\tthis connection, it is an honor and a \n\tpleasure&quot;.\n\t\n\t<u>Casa del Mar</u>\n\t\n\tCasa del Mar, the largest of the three guest houses, provided accommodation for Hearst himself until Casa Grande was ready in 1925. He stayed in the house again in 1947, during his last visit to the estate. \n\t\n\tCasa del Mar contains 5,350 square feet (546 square meters) of floor space. Although luxuriously designed and furnished, none of the guest houses had kitchen facilities, a lack that sometimes irritated Hearst's guests. Adela Rogers St. Johns recounted her first visit: \n\t\n\t&quot;I rang and asked the maid for coffee. \n\tWith a smile, she said I would have to \n\tgo up to the castle for that. \n\tI asked Marion Davies about this. She \n\tsaid W. R. Hearst did not approve of \n\tbreakfast in bed.&quot; \n\t\n\tAdjacent to Casa del Mar is the wellhead from Phoebe Hearst's Hacienda del Pozo de Verona, which Hearst moved to San Simeon when he sold his mother's estate after her death in 1919.\n\t\n\t<u>Casa del Monte</u>\n\t\n\tCasa del Monte was the first of the guest houses, originally entitled simply Houses A (del Mar), B (del Monte) and C (del Sol). It was built by Morgan on the slopes below the site of Casa Grande during 1920–1924. \n\t\n\tHearst had initially wanted to commence work with the construction of the main house, but Morgan persuaded him to begin with the guest cottages because the smaller structures could be completed more quickly. \n\t\n\tEach guest house faces the Esplanade, and appears as a single story at its front entrance. Additional stories descend rearward down the terraced mountain side. Casa del Monte has 2,550 sq ft (237 sq. meters) of living space.\n\t\n\t<u>Casa del Sol</u>\n\t\n\tThe decorative style of the Casa del Sol is Moorish, accentuated by the use of antique Persian tiles. A bronze copy of Donatello's David stands atop a copy of an original Spanish fountain. \n\t\n\tThe inspiration for the fountain came from an illustration in a book, The Minor Ecclesiastical, Domestic and Garden Architecture of Southern Spain, written by Austin Whittlesey and published in 1919. \n\t\n\tHearst sent a copy to Morgan, while retaining another for himself, and it proved a fertile source of ideas. The size of the house is 3,620 square feet (242 sq. meters).\n\t\n\tMorgan's staff were responsible for the cataloguing of those parts of Hearst's art collection which were shipped to California, and an oral record made in the 1980's indicates the methodology used for furnishing the buildings at San Simeon:\n\t\n\t&quot;We would set the object up, and then I would \n\tstand with a yardstick to give it scale. Sam Crow \n\twould take a picture. Then we would give it a \n\tnumber and I would write a description. \n\tThese were made into albums. \n\tWhen Mr Hearst would write and say 'I want a \n\tFlorentine mantel in Cottage C in Room B, and \n\tfour yards of tiles,' then we would look it up in \n\tthe books and find something that would fit.&quot;\n\t\n\t<u>Casa Grande</u>\n\t\n\tConstruction of Casa Grande began in April 1922. Work continued almost until Hearst's final departure on the 2nd. May 1947, and even then the house was unfinished. The size of Casa Grande is 68,500 square feet (5,634 sq. meters).\n\t\n\tThe main western façade is four stories. The entrance front, inspired by a gateway in Seville, is flanked by twin bell towers modeled on the tower of the church of Santa Maria la Mayor.\n\t\n\tThe layout of the main house was originally to a T-plan, with the assembly room to the front, and the refectory at a right angle to its center. The subsequent extensions of the North and South wings modified the original design. \n\t\n\tAs elsewhere, the core construction material is concrete, though the façade is faced in stone. In October 1927 Morgan wrote to Arthur Byne: \n\t\n\t&quot;We finally took the bull by the horns \n\tand are facing the entire main building \n\twith a Manti stone from Utah.&quot; \n\t\n\tMorgan assured Hearst that it would be &quot;the making of the building&quot;. \n\t\n\tA cast-stone balcony fronts the second floor, and another in cast-iron the third. Above this is a large wooden overhang or gable. This was constructed in Siamese teak, originally intended to outfit a ship, which Morgan located in San Francisco. \n\t\n\tThe carving was undertaken by her senior carver Jules Suppo. Sara Holmes Boutelle suggests Morgan may have been inspired by a somewhat similar example at the Mission San Xavier del Bac in Arizona. The façade terminates with the bell towers, comprising the Celestial suites, the carillon towers and two cupolas.\n\t\n\tThe curator Victoria Kastner notes a particular feature of Casa Grande, the absence of any grand staircases. Access to the upper floors is either by elevators or stairwells in the corner turrets of the building. Many of the stairwells are undecorated and the plain, poured concrete contrasts with the richness of the decoration elsewhere. \n\t\n\tThe terrace in front of the entrance, named Central Plaza, has a quatrefoil pond at its center, with a statue of Galatea on a Dolphin. The statue was inherited, having been bought by Phoebe Hearst when her son was temporarily short of money.\n\t\n\tThe doorway from the Central Plaza into Casa Grande illustrates Morgan and Hearst's relaxed approach to combining genuine antiques with modern reproductions to achieve the effects they both desired. A 16th.-century iron gate from Spain is topped by a fanlight grille, constructed in a matching style in the 1920's by Ed Trinkeller, the castle's main ironmonger.\n\t\n\tThe castle made use of the latest technology. Casa Grande was wired with an early sound system, allowing guests to make music selections which were played from a Capehart phonograph located in the basement, and piped into rooms in the house through a system of speakers. Alternatively, six radio stations were available. \n\t\n\tThe entire estate was also equipped with 80 telephones, operated through a PBX switchboard, which was staffed 24 hours a day, and ran under the exclusive exchange 'Hacienda'. \n\t\n\tFortune recorded an example of Hearst's delighting in the ubiquitous access the system provided:\n\t\n\t&quot;A guest) fell to wondering about the result \n\tof a ball game while seated by a campfire \n\twith Mr Hearst, a day's ride from the castle. \n\t'I'll tell you' volunteers Mr Hearst and, \n\tfumbling with the rock against which he was \n\tleaning, pulls from there a telephone, asks \n\tfor New York, and relieves his guest's curiosity&quot;.\n\t\n\t<u>The Assembly Room</u>\n\t\n\tThe assembly room is the main reception room of the castle, described in 1985 by Taylor Coffman as:\n\t\n\t&quot;One of San Simeon's most \n\tmagnificent interiors&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe fireplace, originally from a Burgundian chateau in Jours-lès-Baigneux, is named the Great Barney Mantel, after a previous owner, Charles T. Barney, from whose estate Hearst bought it after Barney's suicide. \n\t\n\t The ceiling is from an Italian palazzo. A concealed door in the paneling next to the fireplace allowed Hearst to surprise his guests by entering unannounced. The door opened off an elevator which connected with his Gothic suite on the third floor. \n\t\n\tThe assembly room, completed in 1926, is nearly 2,500 square feet in extent, and was described by the writer and illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans as:\n\t\n\t&quot;Looking like half of Grand \n\tCentral Station&quot;.\n\t\n\tThe room held some of Hearst's best tapestries. These include four from a set celebrating the Roman general Scipio Africanus, designed by Giulio Romano, and two copied from drawings by Peter Paul Rubens depicting The Triumph of Religion. \n\t\n\tThe need to fit the tapestries above the paneling and below the roof required the installation of the unusually low windows. \n\t\n\tThe room has the only piece of Victorian decorative art in the castle, the Orchid Vase lamp, made by Tiffany for the Exposition Universelle held in Paris in 1889. It was bought by Phoebe Hearst, who had the original vase converted to a lamp. William placed it in the assembly room in tribute to his mother.\n\t\n\t<u>The Refectory</u>\n\t\n\tThe refectory was the only dining room in the castle, and was built between 1926 and 1927. The choir stalls which line the walls are from the La Seu d'Urgell Cathedral in Catalonia, and the silk flags mounted on the walls are Palio banners from Siena. \n\t\n\tHearst originally intended a &quot;vaulted Moorish ceiling&quot; for the room but, finding nothing suitable, he and Morgan settled on the Italian Renaissance example, dating from around 1600, which Hearst purchased from a dealer in Rome in 1924. \n\t\n\tVictoria Kastner considered that the flat roof, with life-size carvings of saints:\n\t\n\t&quot;Strikes a discordant note of \n\thorizontality among the vertical \n\tlines of the room&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe style of the whole is Gothic, in contrast to the Renaissance approach adopted in the preceding assembly room. The refectory is said to have been Morgan's favorite interior within the castle. \n\t\n\tThe design of both the refectory and the assembly room was greatly influenced by the monumental architectural elements, especially the fireplaces and the choir stalls used as wainscoting, and works of art, particularly the tapestries, which Hearst determined would be incorporated into the rooms. \n\t\n\tThe central table provided seating for 22 in its usual arrangement of two tables, which could be extended to three or four, on the occasion of larger gatherings. The tables were sourced from an Italian monastery, and were the setting for some of the best pieces from Hearst's collection of silverware. One of the finest is a wine cooler dating from the early 18th. century and weighing 14.2 kg by the Anglo-French silversmith David Willaume.\n\t\n\t<u>The Library</u>\n\t\n\tThe library is on the second floor, directly above the assembly room. The ceiling is 16th. century Spanish, and a remnant is used in the library's lobby. It comprises three separate ceilings, from different rooms in the same Spanish house, which Morgan combined into one. \n\t\n\tThe fireplace is the largest Italian example in the castle. Carved from limestone, it is attributed to the medieval sculptor and architect Benedetto da Maiano. \n\t\n\tThe library contains a collection of over 5,000 books, with another 3,700 in Hearst's study above. The majority of the library collections, including Hearst's choicest pieces from his sets of, often signed, first editions by Charles Dickens, his favorite author, were sold at sales at Parke-Bernet at 1939 and Gimbels in 1941. The library is also the location for much of Hearst's important holding of antique Greek vases.\n\t\n\t<u>The Cloisters and the Doge's Suite</u>\n\t\n\tThe Cloisters form a grouping of four bedrooms above the refectory and, along with the Doge's Suite above the breakfast room, were completed in 1926. The Doge's Suite was occupied by Millicent Hearst on her rare visits to the castle.\n\t\n\tThe room is lined with blue silk, and has a Dutch painted ceiling, in addition to two more of Spanish origin, which was once the property of architect Stanford White. \n\t\n\tMorgan also incorporated an original Venetian loggia in the suite, refashioned as a balcony. The suite leads on to Morgan's inventive North and South Duplex apartments, with sitting areas and bathrooms at entry level and bedrooms on mezzanine floors above.\n\t\n\t<u>The Gothic Suite</u>\n\t\n\tThe Gothic suite was Hearst's private apartment on the third floor. He moved there in 1927. It comprises the Gothic study or library and Hearst's own South Gothic bedroom and private sitting room. \n\t\n\tThe ceiling of the bedroom is one of the best Hearst bought; Spanish, of the 14th. century, it was discovered by his Iberian agent Arthur Byne who also located the original frieze panels which had been detached and sold some time before. \n\t\n\tThe whole was installed at the castle in 1924. The space originally allocated for the study was too low to create the impression desired by Morgan and Hearst, a difficulty Morgan surmounted by raising the roof and supporting the ceiling with concrete trusses. \n\t\n\tThese, and the walls, were painted with frescoes by Camille Solon. Light was provided by two ranges of clerestory windows. The necessity of raising the roof to incorporate the study occasioned one of the few instances where Hearst hesitated:\n\t\n\t&quot;I telegraphed you my fear of the cost...\n\tI imagine it would be ghastly.&quot;\n\t\n\tNevertheless Morgan urged further changes and expense. The result vindicated Morgan. The study, completed in 1931, is dominated by a portrait of Hearst at age 31, painted by his life-long friend, Orrin Peck.\n\t\n\t<u>The Celestial Suites</u>\n\t\n\tThe Celestial bedrooms, with a connecting, shared, sitting room, were created between 1924 and 1926. The bell towers were raised to improve the proportions of the building, and the suites constructed in the spaces created below. \n\t\n\tThe relatively cramped spaces allowed no room for storage, and en-suite bathrooms were &quot;awkwardly squeezed&quot; into lower landings. Ludwig Bemelmans, a guest in the 1930's, recalled: \n\t\n\t&quot;There was no place to hang your \n\tclothes, so I hung mine on wire \n\tcoat hangers that a former tenant \n\thad left hanging on the arms of \n\ttwo six-armed gold candelabra, \n\tthe rest I put on the floor&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe sitting room contains one of the most important paintings in Hearst's collection, Bonaparte Before the Sphinx (1868) by Jean-Léon Gérôme. The suites are linked externally by a walkway, the Celestial Bridge, which is decorated with elaborate tiling.\n\t\n\t<u>The North and South Wings</u>\n\t\n\tThe North, or Billiard, and the South, or Service, wings complete the castle, and were begun in 1929. \n\t\n\tThe North wing houses the billiard room on the first floor, which was converted from the original breakfast room. It has a Spanish antique ceiling and a French fireplace, and contains the oldest tapestry in the castle, a Millefleur hunting scene woven in Flanders in the 15th. century. \n\t\n\tThe spandrel over the doorcase is decorated with a frieze of 16th. century Persian tiles depicting a battle. The 34 tiles originate from Isfahan and were purchased by Hearst at the Kevorkian sale in New York in 1922. \n\t\n\tThe theater, which leads off the billiard room, was used both for amateur theatricals and the showing of movies from Hearst's Cosmopolitan Studios. The theater accommodated fifty guests and had an electric keyboard that enabled the bells in the carillon towers to be played. The walls are decorated in red damask, which originally hung in the Assembly room, and feature gilded caryatids.\n\t\n\tThe upper stories of the North Wing were the last to be worked upon, and were never completed. Activity recommenced in 1945 and Morgan delegated the work to her assistant, Warren McClure. Many of the rooms are unfinished, but Aidala considers that the bathrooms in the wing represent first-rate examples of streamline design. \n\t\n\tThe Service Wing contains the kitchen. The hotel-scale units and worktops are constructed in Monel Metal, an expensive form of nickel alloy invented in 1901. The wing contains further bedroom suites, a staff dining room, and gives entry to the 9,000 square foot basement which contained a wine cellar, pantries, the boiler plant which heated the main house, and a barber shop, for the use of Hearst's guests.\n\t\n\t<u>Planned but Uncompleted Elements</u>\n\t\n\tHearst and Morgan intended a large ballroom or cloister to connect the North and South wings at the rear of Casa Grande and unify the whole composition, but it was never undertaken.\n\t\n\tIn 1932, Hearst contemplated incorporating the reja (grille) he had acquired from Valladolid Cathedral in 1929 into this room. He described his vision in a letter to Morgan dated that year: \n\t\n\t&quot;A great ballroom and banqueting hall, \n\tthat is the scheme! Isn't it a pippin.&quot; \n\t\n\tThe letter was signed &quot;Sincerely, Your Assistant Architect&quot;. \n\t\n\tOther structures that did not develop beyond drawings and plans included two more guest houses, in English and Chinese architectural styles.\n\t\n\t<u>Collections</u>\n\t\n\tAfter a visit to Ansiglioni's workshop in 1889, William wrote the following in a letter to his mother:\n\t\n\t&quot;Why didn't you buy Ansiglioni's Galatea. It is \n\tsuperb...I have a great notion to buy it myself, \n\tthe one thing that prevents me is a scarcity of \n\tfunds. \n\tThe man wants eight thousand dollars for the \n\tblooming thing. I have the art fever terribly. \n\tQueer, isn't it? \n\tI never miss a gallery and I go and nosey about \n\tthe pictures and statuary and wish they were mine.&quot;\n\t\n\tHearst was a voracious collector of art, with the stated intention of making the castle &quot;a museum of the best things that I can secure.&quot; \n\t\n\tThe dealer Joseph Duveen, from whom Hearst bought despite their mutual dislike, called him the &quot;Great Accumulator.&quot; His robust approach to buying, particularly the purchase and removal of entire historic structures, generated considerable ill-feeling, and sometimes outright opposition.\n\t\n\tWilliam's deconstruction and removal of the 14th. century Bradenstoke Priory in England led the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings to organize a campaign which used language so violent that its posters had to be pasted over for fear of a libel suit. \n\t\n\tHearst sometimes encountered similar opposition elsewhere. In 1919 he was writing to Morgan about:\n\t\n\t&quot;The patio from Bergos (sic) which, by the \n\tway, I own but cannot get out of Spain&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe dismantling of a monastery in Sacramenia, which Hearst bought in its entirety in the 1920's, saw his workmen attacked by enraged villagers. \n\t\n\tHearst's tardiness in paying his bills was another less attractive feature of his purchasing approach; in 1925 Morgan was obliged to write to Arthur Byne:\n\t\n\t&quot;Mr. Hearst accepts your \n\tdictum – cash or nothing&quot;.\n\t\n\tSome of the finest pieces from the collections of books and manuscripts, tapestries, paintings, antiquities and sculpture, amounting to about half of Hearst's total art holdings, were sold in sales in the late 1930's and early 1940's, when Hearst's publishing empire was facing financial collapse, but a great deal remains. \n\t\n\tWilliam's art buying had started when he was young and, in his tested fashion, he established a company, the International Studio Arts Corporation, as a vehicle for purchasing works and as a means of dealing with their export and import. \n\t\n\tIn 1975, the Hearst Corporation donated the archive of Hearst's Brooklyn warehouses, the gathering point for almost all of his European acquisitions before their dispersal to his many homes, to Long Island University. \n\t\n\tAs of 2015, the university has embarked on a digitization project which will ultimately see the 125 albums of records, and sundry other materials, made available online.\n\t\n\t<u>Antiquities</u>\n\t\n\tThe ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities are the oldest works in Hearst's collection. The oldest of all are the stone figures of the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet which stand on the South Esplanade below Casa Grande. They date from the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, approximately 1550 to 1189 BC. \n\t\n\tMorgan designed the pool setting for the pieces, with tiling inspired by ancient Egyptian motifs. In the courtyard of Casa del Monte is one of a total of nine Roman sarcophagi collected by Hearst, dated to 230 AD, and previously held at the Palazzo Barberini, which was acquired at the Charles T. Yerkes sale in 1910. \n\t\n\tThe most important element of the antiquities collection is the holding of Greek vases, on display in the second-floor library. Although 65 vases were purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York after Hearst's death, those which remain at the castle still form one of the world's largest private groups. Hearst began collecting vases in 1901, and his collection was moved from his New York homes to the castle in 1935. \n\t\n\tAt its peak, the collection numbered over 400 pieces. The vases were placed on the tops of the bookshelves in the library, each carefully wired in place to guard against vibrations from earthquakes. At the time of Hearst's collecting, many of the vases were believed to be of Etruscan manufacture, but later scholars ascribe all of them to Greece.\n\t\n\t<u>Sculptures</u>\n\t\n\tHearst often bought multiple lots from sales of major collections; in 1930 he purchased five antique Roman statues from the Lansdowne sale in London. Four are now in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and one in the Metropolitan. \n\t\n\tWilliam collected bronzes as well as marble figures; a cast of a stone original of Apollo and Daphne by Bernini, dating from around 1617, stands in the Doge's suite.\n\t\n\tIn addition to his classical sculptures, Hearst was content to acquire 19th. century versions, or contemporary copies of ancient works:\n\t\n\t&quot;If we cannot find the right thing \n\tin a classic statue, we can find a \n\tmodern one&quot;. \n\t\n\tHe was a particular patron of Charles Cassou, and also favored the early 19th. century Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen whose Venus Victorious remains at the castle.\n\t\n\tBoth this, and the genuinely classical Athena from the collection of Thomas Hope, were displayed in the Assembly room, along with the Venus Italica by Antonio Canova. Other works by Thorvaldsen include the four large marble medallions in the Assembly room depicting society's virtues.\n\t\n\tTwo 19th. century marbles are in the anteroom to the Assembly room, Bacchante, by Frederick William MacMonnies, a copy of his bronze original, and Pygmalion and Galatea by Gérôme. \n\t\n\tA monumental statue of Galatea, attributed to Leopoldo Ansiglioni and dating from around 1882, stands in the center of the pool on the Main terrace in front of Casa Grande.\n\t\n\t<u>Textiles</u>\n\t\n\tTapestries include the Scipio set by Romano in the Assembly room, two from a set telling the Biblical story of Daniel in the Morning room, and the millefleur hunting scene in the Billiard room. The hunting scene is particularly rare, one of only &quot;a handful from this period in the world&quot;. \n\t\n\tHearst also assembled and displayed an important collection of Navajo textiles at San Simeon, including blankets, rugs and serapes. Most were purchased from Herman Schweizer, who ran the Indian Department of the Fred Harvey Company. \n\t\n\tOriginally gathered at Hearst's hacienda at Jolon, they were moved to Wyntoon in 1940 before being brought to San Simeon. They were finally donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1942.\n\t\n\tHearst was always interested in pieces that had historical and cultural connections to the history of California and Central and Latin America. The North Wing contains two Peruvian armorial banners. Dating from the 1580's, they show the shields of Don Luis Jerónimo Fernández Cabrera y Bobadilla, Count of Chinchón and viceroy of Peru. \n\t\n\tNathaniel Burt, the composer and critic evaluated the collections at San Simeon thus:\n\t\n\t&quot;Far from being the mere kitsch that \n\tmost easterners have been led to \n\tbelieve, San Simeon is full of real \n\tbeauties and treasures&quot;.\n\t\n\t<u>Paintings</u>\n\t\n\tThe art collection includes works by Tintoretto, whose portrait of Alvisius Vendramin hangs in the Doge's suite, Franz Xaver Winterhalter who carried out the double portraits of Maximilian I of Mexico and his empress Carlota, located in Casa del Mar, and two portraits of Napoléon by Jean-Léon Gérôme. \n\t\n\tHearst's earliest painting, a Madonna and Child from the school of Duccio di Buoninsegna, dates from the early 14th. century. A gift from his friend, the editor Cissy Patterson, the painting hangs in Hearst's bedroom. \n\t\n\tPortrait of a Woman, by Giulio Campi, hangs in a bedroom in the North Wing. In 1928 Hearst acquired the Madonna and Child with Two Angels, by Adriaen Isenbrandt. \n\t\n\tThe curator Taylor Coffman describes this work, which hangs in the Casa del Mar sitting room, as perhaps &quot;San Simeon's finest painting&quot;. In 2018, a previously unattributed Annunciation in the Assembly room was identified as a work of 1690 by Bartolomé Pérez.\n\t\n\t<u>The Gardens and Grounds of Hearst Castle</u>\n\t\n\tThe Esplanade, a curving, paved walkway, connects the main house with the guest cottages; Hearst described it as:\n\t\n\t&quot;Giving a finished touch to the big \n\thouse, to frame it in, as it were.&quot; \n\t\n\tMorgan designed the pedestrianized pavement with great care, to create a coup de théâtre for guests, desiring:\n\t\n\t&quot;A strikingly noble and saississant effect \n\tbe impressed upon everyone on arrival.&quot; \n\t\n\tHearst concurred:\n\t\n\t&quot;Heartily approve. I certainly want that \n\tsaississant effect. I don't know what it\n\tis, but I think we ought to have at least \n\tone such on the premises&quot;. \n\t\n\tA feature of the gardens are the lampposts topped with alabaster globes; modeled on &quot;janiform hermae&quot;, the concept was Hearst's. The Swan lamps, remodeled with alabaster globe lights to match the hermae, were designed by Morgan's chief draftsman, Thaddeus Joy. \n\t\n\tOthers who influenced Hearst and Morgan in their landscaping include Charles Adams Platt, an artist and gardener who had made a particular study of the layout and planting of Italian villas. Also Nigel Keep, Hearst's orchardman, who worked at San Simeon from 1922 to 1947, and Albert Webb, Hearst's English head gardener who was at the hill from 1922 to 1948.\n\t\n\t<u>The Neptune Pool</u>\n\t\n\tThe Neptune Pool, &quot;the most sumptuous swimming pool on earth&quot;, is located near the edge of the hilltop.  It is enclosed by a retaining wall and underpinned by a framework of concrete struts to allow for movement in the event of earthquakes. \n\t\n\tThe pool is often cited as an example of Hearst's changeability; it was reconstructed three times before he was finally satisfied. Originally begun as an ornamental pond, it was first expanded in 1924 as Millicent Hearst desired a swimming pool. \n\t\n\tIt was enlarged again during 1926–1928 to accommodate Cassou's statuary. Finally, in 1934, it was extended again to act as a setting for a Roman temple, in part original and in part comprising elements from other structures which Hearst transported from Europe and had reconstructed at the site.\n\t\n\tThe pool holds 345,000 gallons of water, and is equipped with seventeen shower and changing rooms. It was heated by oil-fired burners. In early 2014, the pool was drained due to drought conditions and leakage. \n\t\n\tAfter a long-term restoration project to fix the leaking, the pool was refilled in August 2018. The restoration of the pool was recognized with a Preservation Design Award for Craftsmanship from the California Preservation Foundation in 2019. \n\t\n\tThe pool is well-supplied with sculpture, particularly works by Charles Cassou. His centerpiece, opposite the Roman temple, is The Birth of Venus. An even larger sculptural grouping, depicting Neptune in a chariot drawn by four horses, was commissioned to fill the empty basin above the Venus. Although carved, it was never installed.\n\t\n\t<u>Roman Pool</u>\n\t\n\tThe Roman Pool, constructed under the tennis courts, provided an indoor alternative to the Neptune pool. Originally mooted by Hearst in 1927, construction did not begin until 1930, and the pool was not completed until 1935. \n\t\n\tHearst initially wanted the pool to be fed by salt-water, but the design challenges proved to be insuperable. A disastrous attempt to fulfill Hearst's desires by pouring 20 tons of washed rock salt into the pool saw the disintegration of the cast-iron heat exchanger and pump. \n\t\n\tInspiration for the mosaic decoration came from the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna. The tiles are of Murano glass, with gold-leaf, and were designed by Solon and manufactured in San Francisco. \n\t\n\tAlthough a pool of &quot;spectacular beauty&quot;, it was little used as it was located in a less-visited part of the complex.\n\t\n\t<u>The Pergola and Zoo</u>\n\t\n\tTwo other major features of the grounds were the pergola and the zoo. The pergola, an ornamental bridleway, runs to the west of Casa Grande. Comprising concrete columns, covered in espaliered fruit trees, Morgan ensured that it was built to a height sufficient to allow Hearst, &quot;a tall man with a tall hat on a tall horse&quot;, to ride unimpeded down its mile-long length. \n\t\n\tPlans for a zoo, to house Hearst's large collection of wild animals, were drawn up by Morgan, and included an elephant house and separate enclosures for antelopes, camels, zebras and bears. The zoo was never constructed, but a range of shelters and pits were built, sited on Orchard Hill.\n\t\n\t<u>The Estate</u>\n\t\n\tAt the height of Hearst's ownership, the estate totaled more than 250,000 acres. W. C. Fields commented on the extent of the estate while on a visit: \n\t\n\t&quot;Wonderful place to bring up children. \n\tYou can send them out to play. They \n\twon't come back till they're grown.&quot; \n\t\n\t23 miles to the north of the castle, Morgan constructed the Milpitas Hacienda, a ranch-house that acted as a trianon to the main estate, and as a focus for riding expeditions. \n\t\n\t<u>Appraisals of Hearst Castle</u>\n\t\n\tAs with Hearst himself, Hearst Castle and its collections have been the subject of considerable criticism. From the 1940's the view of Hearst and Morgan's most important joint creation as the phantasmagorical Xanadu of Orson Welles's imagination has been commonplace.\n\t\n\tSome literary depictions were gently mocking; P. G. Wodehouse's novel of 1953, The Return of Jeeves has a character describe her stay:\n\t\n\t&quot;I remember visiting San Simeon once, \n\tand there was a whole French Abbey \n\tlying on the grass.&quot; \n\t\n\tJohn Steinbeck's unnamed description was certainly of Hearst: \n\t\n\t&quot;They's a fella, newspaper fella near the \n\tcoast, got a million acres. Fat, sof' fella \n\twith little mean eyes an' a mouth like a \n\tass-hole&quot;.\n\t\n\tThe writer John Dos Passos went further, explicitly referencing Hearst in the third volume of his 1938 U.S.A trilogy:\n\t\n\t&quot;The emperor of newsprint retired to his \n\tfief of San Simeon where he built an \n\tAndalusian palace and there spends his \n\tlast years amid the relaxing adulations \n\tof screen stars, admen, screenwriters, \n\tpublicity-men, columnists. \n\tUntil he dies, a spent Caesar grown old \n\twith spending.&quot;\n\t\n\tThe English architectural writer Clive Aslet was little more complimentary about the castle. Disliking its &quot;unsympathetic texture of poured concrete&quot;, he described it as &quot;best seen from a distance&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe unfinished, and unresolved, rear façade of Casa Grande has been the subject of particular negative comment; Carleton Winslow and Nicola Frye, in their history from 1980, suggest:\n\t\n\t&quot;The flanking North and South wings \n\tcompete rather disastrously with the \n\tcentral doge's suite block.&quot; \n\t\n\tOthers questioned the castle's very existence; the architect Witold Rybczynski asked: \n\t\n\t&quot;What is this Italian villa doing on the \n\tCalifornian Coastal Range? A costly \n\tpiece of theatrical décor that ignores \n\tits context and lacks meaning.&quot;\n\t\n\tHearst's collections were similarly disparaged. The art historian William George Constable echoed Joseph Duveen when he assessed Hearst as:\n\t\n\t&quot;Not a collector but a gigantic \n\tand voracious magpie.&quot;\n\t\n\tLater decades after Hearst's death have seen a more sympathetic and appreciative evaluation of his collections, and the estate he and Morgan created to house them. \n\t\n\tThe director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Thomas Hoving, although listing Hearst only at number 83 in his evaluation of America's top 101 art collectors, wrote:\n\t\n\t&quot;Hearst is being reevaluated. He may \n\thave been much more of a collector \n\tthan was thought at the time of his \n\tdeath.&quot;\n\t\n\tThe curator Mary Levkoff, in her 2008 study, Hearst the Collector, contends that he was indeed a collector, describing the four separate &quot;staggeringly important&quot; collections of antique vases, tapestries, armor and silver which Hearst had brought together.\n\t\n\tShe wrote of the challenge of bringing their artistic merit to light from under the shadow of his own reputation. \n\t\n\tOf Morgan's building, its stock has risen with the re-evaluation of her standing and accomplishments, which saw her inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2008. She became the first woman to receive the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 2014, and to have an obituary in The New York Times as recently as 2019. \n\t\n\tThe writer John Julius Norwich recorded his recantation after a visit to the castle: \n\t\n\t&quot;I went prepared to mock; I remained \n\tto marvel. Hearst Castle is a palace in \n\tevery sense of the word.&quot;",

Conceived by William Randolph Hearst, the publishing tycoon, and his architect Julia Morgan, the castle was built between 1919 and 1947.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw described Hearst Castle as:\n\n\"What God would have built\n\nif he had had the money.\"\n\nToday, Hearst Castle is a museum open to the public as a California State Park and registered as a National Historic Landmark and California Historical Landmark.\n\nGeorge Hearst, William Randolph Hearst's father, had purchased the original 40,000-acre (162 km2) estate in 1865 and Camp Hill, the site for the future Hearst Castle, was used for family camping vacations during Hearst's youth.\n\nIn 1919 William inherited $11,000,000 (equivalent to $172,000,000 in 2021) and estates, including the land at San Simeon. He used his fortune to further develop his media empire of newspapers, magazines and radio stations, the profits from which supported a lifetime of building and collecting.\n\nWithin a few months of Phoebe Hearst's death, he had commissioned Morgan to:\n\n\"Build something a little more\n\ncomfortable up on the hill.\"\n\nThis was the genesis of the present castle. Morgan was an architectural pioneer:\n\n\"America's first truly independent\n\nfemale architect.\"\n\nShe was the first woman to study architecture at the School of Beaux-Arts in Paris, the first to have her own architectural practice in California, and the first female winner of the American Institute of Architects' Gold Medal.\n\nJulia worked in close collaboration with Hearst for over twenty years, and the castle at San Simeon is her best-known creation.\n\nIn the Roaring Twenties and into the 1930's, Hearst Castle reached its social peak. Originally intended as a family home for Hearst, his wife Millicent and their five sons, by 1925 he and Millicent had effectively separated and he held court at San Simeon with his mistress, the actress Marion Davies.\n\nTheir guest list comprised most of the Hollywood stars of the period; Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, the Marx Brothers, Greta Garbo, Buster Keaton, Mary Pickford, Jean Harlow and Clark Gable all visited, some on multiple occasions.\n\nPolitical luminaries encompassed Calvin Coolidge and Winston Churchill, while other notables included Charles Lindbergh, P. G. Wodehouse and George Bernard Shaw.\n\nVisitors gathered each evening at Casa Grande for drinks in the Assembly Room, dined in the Refectory and watched the latest movie in the theater before retiring to the luxurious accommodation provided by the guest houses of Casa del Mar, Casa del Monte and Casa del Sol.\n\nDuring the days, they admired the views, rode, played tennis, bowls or golf and swam in \"the most sumptuous swimming pool on earth\".\n\nWhile Hearst entertained, Morgan built; the castle was under almost continual construction from 1920 until 1939, with work resuming after the end of World War II until Hearst's final departure in 1947.\n\nHearst, his castle and his lifestyle were satirized by Orson Welles in his 1941 film Citizen Kane. In the film, which Hearst sought to suppress, Charles Foster Kane's palace Xanadu is said to contain:\n\n\"Paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones\n\nof many another palace – a collection of\n\neverything so big it can never be cataloged\n\nor appraised; enough for ten museums; the\n\nloot of the world\".\n\nWelles's was referring to Hearst's mania for collecting; the dealer Joseph Duveen called him the \"Great Accumulator\".\n\nWith a passion for acquisition almost from childhood, he bought architectural elements, art, antiques, statuary, silverware and textiles on an epic scale. Shortly after starting San Simeon, he began to conceive of making the castle:\n\n\"A museum of the best\n\nthings that I can secure\".\n\nForemost among his purchases were architectural elements from Western Europe, particularly Spain. Over thirty ceilings, doorcases, fireplaces and mantels, entire monasteries, paneling and a medieval tithe barn were purchased, shipped to Hearst's Brooklyn warehouses and transported on to California.\n\nMuch was then incorporated into the fabric of Hearst Castle. In addition, he built up collections of more conventional art and antiques of high quality; his assemblage of ancient Greek vases was one of the world's largest.\n\nIn May 1947, Hearst's health compelled him and Marion Davies to leave the castle for the last time. He died in Los Angeles in 1951, and Morgan died in 1957. The following year, the Hearst family gave the castle and much of its contents to the State of California, and the mansion was opened to the public on the 17th. May 17, 1958.\n\nIt has since operated as the Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument, and attracts about 750,000 visitors annually.\n\nThe Hearst family retains ownership of the majority of the 82,000 acres (332 km2) wider estate and, under a land conservation agreement reached in 2005, has worked with the California State Parks Department and American Land Conservancy to preserve the undeveloped character of the area.\n\nEarly History to 1864\n\nThe coastal range of Southern California has been occupied since prehistoric times. The indigenous inhabitants were the Salinans and the Chumash. In the late 18th. century, Spanish missions were established in the area in order to convert the Native American population.\n\nThe Mission San Miguel Arcángel, one of the largest, opened in what is now San Luis Obispo county in 1797. By the 1840's, the mission had declined and the priests departed. In that decade, the governors of Mexican California distributed the mission lands in a series of grants.\n\nThree of these were Rancho Piedra Blanca, Rancho Santa Rosa and Rancho San Simeon. The Mexican–American War of 1846–1848 saw the area pass into the control of the United States under the terms of the Mexican Cession. The California Gold Rush of the next decade brought an influx of American settlers, among whom was the 30-year old George Hearst.\n\nBuying the land: 1865–1919\n\nBorn in Missouri in 1820, George Hearst made his fortune as a miner of gold and silver, notably at the Comstock Lode and the Homestake Mine. He then undertook a political career, becoming a senator in 1886, and bought The San Francisco Examiner.\n\nInvesting in land, he bought the Piedra Blanca property in 1865, and subsequently extended his holdings with the acquisition of most of the Santa Rosa estate, and much of the San Simeon lands.\n\nIn the 1870's George Hearst built a ranch house on his estate, which remains a private property maintained by the Hearst Corporation. The San Simeon area became a site for family camping expeditions, including his young son, William. A particularly favored spot was named Camp Hill, the site of the future Hearst Castle.\n\nYears later Hearst recalled his early memories of the place:\n\n\"My father brought me to San Simeon\n\nas a boy. I had to come up the slope\n\nhanging on to the tail of a pony.\n\nWe lived in a cabin on this spot and I\n\ncould see forever. That's the West –\n\nforever.\"\n\nGeorge Hearst developed the estate somewhat, introducing beef and dairy cattle, planting extensive fruit orchards, and expanding the wharf facilities at San Simeon Bay. He also bred racehorses.\n\nWhile his father developed the ranch, Hearst and his mother traveled, including an eighteen-month tour of Europe in 1873, where Hearst's life-long obsession with art collecting began.\n\nWhen George Hearst died in 1891, he left an estate of $18 million to his widow including the California ranch. Phoebe Hearst shared the cultural and artistic interests of her son, collecting art and patronizing architects.\n\nShe was also a considerable philanthropist, founding schools and libraries, supporting the fledgling University of California, Berkeley, including the funding of the Hearst Mining Building in memory of her husband, and making major donations to a range of women's organizations, including the YWCA.\n\nDuring the late 1890's, Mrs Hearst encountered Julia Morgan, a young architecture student at Berkeley. On Phoebe Hearst's death in 1919, William Hearst inherited the ranch, which had grown to 250,000 acres and 14 miles (23 km) of coastline, as well as $11 million.\n\n250,000 acres is a huge area for an estate - to accommodate that area in a square, it would need sides of over 19.8 miles (32 km).\n\nWithin days of his mother's death, William was at Morgan's San Francisco office.\n\nJulia Morgan\n\nJulia Morgan, who was born in 1872, was 47 when Hearst entered her office in 1919. Her biographer Mark A. Wilson has described her subsequent career as that of:\n\n\"America's first independent\n\nfull-time woman architect\".\n\nAfter studying at Berkeley, where she worked with Bernard Maybeck, and in 1898 she became the first woman to win entry to the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Passing out from the École in 1902, Morgan returned to San Francisco and took up a post at the architectural practice of John Galen Howard.\n\nHoward recognized Morgan's talents, but also exploited them:\n\n\"The best thing about this person\n\nis, I pay her almost nothing, as it is\n\na woman.\"\n\nIn 1904, Julia passed the California architects' licensing examination, the first woman to do so, establishing her own office in 1906 at 456 Montgomery Street in San Francisco.\n\nDuring her time with Howard, Morgan was commissioned by Phoebe Hearst to undertake work at her Hacienda del Pozo de Verona estate at Pleasanton. This led to work at Wyntoon and to a number of commissions from Hearst himself; an unexecuted design for a mansion at Sausalito, north of San Francisco, a cottage at the Grand Canyon, and the Los Angeles Examiner Building.\n\nIn 1919, when he turned up at Morgan's office, Hearst was fifty-six years old, and the owner of a publishing empire that included twenty-eight newspapers, thirteen magazines, eight radio stations, four film studios, extensive real-estate holdings and thirty-one thousand employees.\n\nHe was also a significant public figure: although his political endeavors had proved largely unsuccessful, the influence he exerted through his direct control of his media empire attracted fame and opprobrium in equal measure.\n\nIn 1917, one biographer described him as:\n\n\"The most hated man\n\nin the country\".\n\nThe actor Ralph Bellamy, a guest at San Simeon in the mid-1930's, recorded Hearst's working methods in a description of a party in the Assembly Room:\n\n\"The party was quite gay. And in the midst of it,\n\nMr Hearst came in. There was a teletype machine\n\njust inside, and he stopped and he read it.\n\nHe went to a table and picked up a phone.\n\nHe asked for the editor of his San Francisco\n\nnewspaper and he said, 'Put this in a two-column\n\nbox of the front pages of all the newspapers\n\ntomorrow morning.'\n\nAnd without notes he dictated an editorial.\"\n\nMorgan and Hearst's partnership at San Simeon lasted from 1919 until his final departure from the castle in 1947. Their correspondence, preserved in the Julia Morgan archive in the Robert E. Kennedy Library at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, runs to some 3,700 letters and telegrams.\n\nVictoria Kastner, Hearst Castle's in-house custodian, has described the partnership as \"a rare, true collaboration,\" and there are many contemporary accounts of the closeness of the relationship. Walter Steilberg, a draughtsman in Morgan's office, once observed them at dinner:\n\n\"The rest of us could have been a\n\nhundred miles away; they didn't pay\n\nany attention to anybody ... these\n\ntwo very different people just clicked\".\n\nThomas Aidala, in his 1984 history of the castle, made a similar observation:\n\n\"Seated opposite each other, they\n\nwould discuss and review work,\n\nconsider design changes, pass\n\ndrawings back and forth ... seemingly\n\noblivious of the rest of the guests.\"\n\nHaving a Ball: 1925–1938\n\nHearst and his family occupied Casa Grande for the first time at Christmas, 1925. Thereafter, Hearst's wife, Millicent, went back to New York, and from 1926 until they left for the last time in 1947, Hearst's mistress Marion Davies acted as his chatelaine at the castle.\n\nThe Hollywood and political elite often visited in the 1920's and 1930's. Among Hearst's guests were Calvin Coolidge, Winston Churchill, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, the Marx Brothers, Charles Lindbergh, and Clark Gable.\n\nChurchill described his host, and Millicent Hearst and Davies, in a letter to his own wife:\n\n\"A grave simple child – with no doubt a\n\nnasty temper – playing with the most\n\ncostly toys.\n\nTwo magnificent establishments, two\n\ncharming wives, complete indifference\n\nto public opinion, oriental hospitalities.\"\n\nWeekend guests were either brought by private train from Glendale Station north of Los Angeles, and then by car to the castle, or flew into Hearst's airstrip, generally arriving late on Friday evening or on Saturday. Cecil Beaton wrote of his impressions during his first visit for New Year's Eve in 1931:\n\n\"We caught sight of a vast, sparkling white\n\ncastle in Spain. It was out of a fairy story.\n\nThe sun poured down with theatrical\n\nbrilliance on tons of white marble and white\n\nstone.\n\nThere seemed to be a thousand statues,\n\npedestals, urns. The flowers were unreal in\n\ntheir ordered profusion.\n\nHearst stood smiling at the top of one of\n\nthe many flights of garden steps\".\n\nGuests were generally left to their own devices during the day. Horseback riding, shooting, swimming, golf, croquet and tennis were all available, while Hearst would lead mounted parties for picnics on the estate. The only absolute deadline was for cocktails in the assembly room at 7.30 on Saturday night.\n\nAlcohol was rationed; guests were not permitted to have liquor in their rooms, and were limited to one cocktail each before dinner. This was due not to meanness on Hearst's part, but to his concerns over Davies's alcoholism, though the rule was frequently flouted.\n\nThe actor David Niven later reflected on his supplying illicit alcohol to Davies:\n\n\"It seemed fun at the time to stoke up\n\nher fire of outrageous fun and I got a\n\nkick out of feeling I had outwitted one\n\nof the most powerful and best informed\n\nmen on earth, but what a disloyal and\n\ncrummy betrayal of him, and what a\n\nnasty potential nail to put in her coffin.\"\n\nDinner was served at 9.00 in the refectory. Wine came from Hearst's 7,000-bottle cellar. Charlie Chaplin commented on the fare:\n\n\"Dinners were elaborate -- pheasant, wild\n\nduck, partridge and venison -- but were\n\nalso informal: amidst the opulence, we\n\nwere served paper napkins, it was only\n\nwhen Mrs Hearst was in residence that\n\nthe guests were given linen ones.\"\n\nThe informality extended to the ketchup bottles and condiments in jars which were remarked on by many guests.\n\nDinner was invariably followed by a movie; initially outside, and then in the theater. The actress Ilka Chase recorded a showing in the early 1930's:\n\n\"The theater was not yet complete – the plaster\n\nwas still wet – so an immense pile of fur coats\n\nwas heaped at the door, and each guest picked\n\none up and enveloped himself before entering...\n\nHearst and Marion, close together in the gloom\n\nand bundled in their fur coats, looked for all the\n\nworld like the big and baby bears\".\n\nMovies were generally films from Hearst's own studio, Cosmopolitan Productions, and often featured Marion Davies. Sherman Eubanks, whose father worked as an electrician at the castle, recorded in an oral history:\n\n\"Mr Hearst would push a button and call up to\n\nthe projectionist and say 'Put on Marion's Peg\n\no' My Heart'.\n\nSo I've seen Peg o' My Heart about fifty times.\n\nThis is not being critical. I'm simply saying that's\n\nthe way it was. This repetition tended to put a\n\nslight strain on the guests' gratitude.\"\n\nIn 1937, Patricia Van Cleeve married at the castle, the grandest social occasion there since the visit of President and Mrs Coolidge in February 1930. Ken Murray records these two events as the only occasions when formal attire was required of guests to the castle.\n\nVan Cleeve, who married the actor Arthur Lake, was always introduced as Marion Davies' favorite niece. It was frequently rumored that she was in fact Davies and Hearst's daughter, something she herself acknowledged just before her death in 1993.\n\nIn February 1938, a plane crash at the San Simeon airstrip led to the deaths of Lord and Lady Plunket, who were traveling to the castle as Hearst's guests, and the pilot Tex Phillips. The only other passenger, the bobsledding champion, James Lawrence, survived.\n\nThe Specter at the Feast: Hearst, Welles and Xanadu\n\nHearst Castle was the inspiration for Xanadu, and Hearst himself the main model for Charles Foster Kane in Orson Welles's 1941 film Citizen Kane.\n\nHaving made his name with the Mercury Theatre production of The War of the Worlds in 1938, Welles arrived in Hollywood in 1939 to make a film version of Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness for RKO Pictures.\n\nThe film was not made, and Welles began a collaboration with the screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz on a screenplay originally entitled American. The film tells the stories of Kane, a media magnate and aspiring politician, and of his second wife Susan Alexander, a failed opera singer driven to drink, who inhabit a castle in Florida.\n\nFilming began in June 1940, and the movie premiered on the 1st. June 1941. Although at the time Orson Welles and RKO denied that the film was based on Hearst, his long-time friend and collaborator, John Houseman was clear:\n\n\"The truth is simple: for the basic concept\n\nof Charles Foster Kane and for the main\n\nlines and significant events of his public life,\n\nMankiewicz used as his model the figure of\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst\".\n\nTold of the film's content before its release – his friends, the gossip columnists Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons having attended early screenings – Hearst made strenuous efforts to stop the premiere. When these failed, he sought to damage the film's circulation by alternately forbidding all mention of it in his media outlets, or by using them to attack both the movie and Welles.\n\nHearst's assault damaged the film at the box office, and harmed Welles' subsequent career.\n\nSince its inception in 1952 through to 2012, the Sight and Sound Critics' Poll voted Citizen Kane the greatest film of all time in every decade of polling. On the 9th. March 2012 the film was screened in the movie theater at Hearst Castle for the first time as part of the San Luis Obispo International Film Festival.\n\nDepression, Death and After: 1939–Present\n\nBy the late 1930's, the Great Depression and Hearst's profligacy had brought him to the brink of financial ruin. Debts totaled $126 million, and he was compelled to cede financial control of the Hearst Corporation. Newspapers and radio stations were sold, and much of his art collection was dispersed in a series of sales, often for much less than he had paid.\n\nHearst railed against his losses, and the perceived incompetence of the sales agents, Parish-Watson & Co:\n\n\"They greatly cheapened them and us,\n\nhe advertises like a bargain basement\n\nsale. I am heartbroken\".\n\nConstruction at Hearst Castle virtually ceased. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the castle was closed up and Hearst and Davies moved to Wyntoon, which was perceived to be less vulnerable to enemy attack.\n\nThey returned in 1945, and construction on a limited scale recommenced, finally ending in 1947. In early May of that year, with his health declining, Hearst and Davies left the castle for the last time. The pair settled in at 1007 North Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills.\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst died in 1951, his death abruptly severing him from Davies, who was excluded from the funeral by Hearst's family:\n\n\"For thirty-two years I had him,\n\nand they leave me with his\n\nempty room\".\n\nIn 1950 Julia Morgan closed her San Francisco office after a career of forty-two years. Ill health marred her retirement and she died, a virtual recluse, in early 1957.\n\nIn 1958 the Hearst Corporation donated Hearst Castle, its gardens, and many of its contents, to the state of California. A plaque at the castle reads:\n\n\"La Cuesta Encantada presented to\n\nthe State of California in 1958 by the\n\nHearst Corporation in memory of\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst who created\n\nthis Enchanted Hill, and of his mother,\n\nPhoebe Apperson Hearst, who\n\ninspired it\".\n\nThe castle was opened to the public for the first time in June 1958. Hearst Castle was added to the National Register of Historic Places on the 22nd. June.\n\nHearst was always keen to protect the mystique of his castle. In 1926, he wrote to Morgan to congratulate her after a successful party was held on the hill:\n\n\"Those wild movie people said it was\n\nwonderful and that the most extravagant\n\ndream of a movie picture fell far short of\n\nthis reality. They all wanted to make a\n\npicture there but they are NOT going to\n\nbe allowed to do this.\"\n\nCommercial filming at the castle is still rarely allowed. Since 1957 only two projects have been granted permission:\n\n-- Stanley Kubrick's 1960 film Spartacus used the castle to stand in as the villa of Marcus Licinius Crassus, played by Lawrence Olivier.\n\n-- In 2014, Lady Gaga's music video for \"G.U.Y.\" was filmed at the Neptune and Roman Pools.\n\nOn the 12th. February 1976, the Casa del Sol guesthouse was damaged by a bomb. The device was placed by allies of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), in retaliation for Patty Hearst, Hearst's granddaughter, testifying in court at her trial for armed robbery, following her kidnapping by the SLA in 1974.\n\nOn the 22nd. December 2003, an earthquake occurred with its epicenter some three miles north of the castle. With a magnitude of 6.5, it was the largest earthquake recorded at San Simeon. The very limited structural damage which resulted was a testament to the quality of the castle's construction.\n\nSince its opening, the castle has become a major California tourist attraction, attracting over 850,000 visitors in 2018. Recent changes to the tour arrangements now allow visitors time to explore the grounds independently at the conclusion of the conducted tours.\n\nThe Hearst family maintains a connection with the castle, which was closed for a day in early August 2019 for the wedding of Amanda Hearst, Hearst's great-granddaughter.\n\nThe castle closed in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After 2 years of closure and repairs to the access road due to rainstorm damage, the castle reopened on the 11th. May 2022.\n\nArchitecture of Hearst Castle\n\nHearst's original idea was to build a bungalow, according to Walter Steilberg, one of Morgan's draftsmen who recalled Hearst's words from the initial meeting:\n\n\"I would like to build something up on\n\nthe hill at San Simeon. I get tired of\n\ngoing up there and camping in tents.\n\nI'm getting a little too old for that.\n\nI'd like to get something that would\n\nbe a little more comfortable\".\n\nHowever within a month, Hearst's original ideas for a modest dwelling had greatly expanded. Discussion on the style began with consideration of \"Jappo-Swisso\" themes. Then the Spanish Colonial Revival style was favored. Morgan had used this style when she worked on Hearst's Los Angeles Herald Examiner headquarters in 1915.\n\nHearst appreciated the Spanish Revival but was dissatisfied with the crudeness of the colonial structures in California. Mexican colonial architecture had more sophistication, but he objected to its abundance of ornamentation.\n\nThomas Aidala, in his 1984 study of the castle, notes the Churrigueresque influence on the design of the main block:\n\n\"Flat and unembellished exterior surfaces;\n\ndecorative urges are particularized and\n\nisolated, focused mainly on doorways,\n\nwindows and towers\".\n\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 in San Diego held the closest approximations in California to the approach Hearst desired. But William's European tours, and specifically the inspiration of the Iberian Peninsula, led him to Renaissance and Baroque examples in southern Spain that more exactly suited his tastes. He particularly admired a church in Ronda, Spain and asked Morgan to model the Casa Grande towers after it.\n\nIn a letter to Morgan dated 31st. December 1919, Hearst wrote:\n\n\"The San Diego Exposition is the best source\n\nof Spanish in California. The alternative is to\n\nbuild in the Renaissance style of southern Spain.\n\nWe picked out the towers of the church at Ronda...\n\na Renaissance decoration, particularly that of the\n\nvery southern part of Spain, could harmonize well\n\nwith them.\n\nI would very much like to have your views on what\n\nstyle of architecture we should select.\"\n\nThis blend of Southern Spanish Renaissance, Revival and Mediterranean examples became San Simeon's defining style:\n\n\"Something a little different than other\n\npeople are doing out in California\".\n\nThe architectural writers Arrol Gellner and Douglas Keister describe Casa Grande as\n\n\"A palatial fusion of Classicism and Mediterranean\n\narchitecture that transcended the Mission Revival\n\nera and instead belonged to the more archaeological\n\nPeriod Revival styles that gained favor after the\n\nPanama-California Exposition of 1915\".\n\nHearst Castle has a total of 42 bedrooms, 61 bathrooms, 19 sitting rooms, 127 acres (half a square kilometer) of gardens, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis courts, a movie theater, an airfield and, during Hearst's lifetime, the world's largest private zoo.\n\nHearst was an inveterate rethinker who would frequently order the redesign of previously agreed, and often built, structures: the Neptune Pool was rebuilt three times before he was satisfied.\n\nHe was aware of his propensity for changing his mind; in a letter dated the 18th. March 1920, he wrote to Morgan:\n\n\"All little houses stunning. Please complete\n\nbefore I can think up any more changes\".\n\nAs a consequence of Hearst's persistent design changes, and financial difficulties in the early and later 1930's, the complex was never finished.\n\nBy the late summer of 1919, Morgan had surveyed the site, analyzed its geology, and drawn initial plans for Casa Grande. Construction began in 1919 and continued through 1947 when Hearst left the estate for the last time.\n\nDuring the early years of construction, until Hearst's stays at San Simeon became longer and more frequent, his approval for the ongoing design was obtained by Morgan sending him models of planned developments.\n\nBy the late 1920's the main model, designed by another female architect Julian C. Mesic, had become too large to ship, and Mesic and Morgan would photograph it, hand-color the images, and send these to Hearst.\n\nConstruction of Hearst Castle\n\nThe castle's location presented major challenges for construction. It was remote; when Morgan began coming to the estate for site visits in 1919, she would leave her San Francisco office on Friday afternoon and take an eight-hour, 200-mile train journey to San Luis Obispo, followed by a fifty-mile drive to San Simeon.\n\nThe relative isolation made recruiting and retaining a workforce a constant difficulty. In the early years, the estate lacked water, its limited supplies coming from three natural springs on Pine Mountain, a 3,500-foot-high (1,100 m) peak seven miles (11 km) east of Hearst Castle.\n\nThe issue was addressed by the construction of three reservoirs, and Morgan devised a gravity-based water delivery system that transported water from the nearby mountain springs to the reservoirs, including the main one on Rocky Butte, a 2,000-foot (610 m) knoll less than a mile southeast of Hearst Castle.\n\nWater was of particular importance; as well as feeding the pools and fountains Hearst desired, it provided electricity, by way of a private hydroelectric plant, until the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation began service to the castle in 1924.\n\nThe climate presented a further challenge. The proximity to the coast brought strong winds in from the Pacific Ocean, and the site's elevation meant that winter storms were frequent and severe.\n\nAfter a period of severe storms in February 1927, Hearst wrote a letter:\n\n\"We are all leaving the hill. We are drowned,\n\nblown and frozen out. Before we build anything\n\nmore, let's make what we have practical,\n\ncomfortable and beautiful.\n\nIf we can't do that we might just as well change\n\nthe names of the houses to Pneumonia House,\n\nDiphtheria House and Influenza Bungalow.\n\nThe main house we can call the Clinic.\"\n\nWater was also essential for the production of concrete, the main structural component of the houses and their ancillary buildings.\n\nMorgan had substantial experience of building in steel-reinforced concrete and, together with the firm of consulting engineers Earl and Wright, experimented in finding suitable stone, eventually settling on that quarried from the mountain top on which the foundation platform for the castle was built.\n\nCombining this with desalinated sand from San Simeon Bay produced concrete of exceptionally high quality. Later, white sand was brought in from Carmel. Material for construction was transported either by train and truck, or by sea into a wharf built in San Simeon Bay below the site. In time, a light railway was constructed from the wharf to the castle, and Morgan built a compound of warehouses for storage and accommodation for workers by the bay.\n\nBrick and tile works were also developed on site, as brick was used extensively, and tiling was an important element of the decoration of the castle. Morgan used several tile companies to produce her designs, including Grueby Faience, Batchelder, California Faience and Solon & Schemmel.\n\nAlbert Solon and Frank Schemmel came to Hearst Castle to undertake tiling work, and Solon's brother, Camille, was responsible for the design of the mosaics of blue-and-gold Venetian glass tile used in the Roman pool and the murals in Hearst's Gothic library.\n\nMorgan worked with a series of construction managers; Henry Washburn from 1919 to 1922, then Camille Rossi from 1922, until his firing by Hearst in 1932, and finally George Loorz until 1940. From 1920 to 1939, there were between 25 and 150 workmen employed in construction at the castle.\n\nCosts of Hearst Castle\n\nThe exact cost of the entire San Simeon complex is unknown. Kastner makes an estimate of expenditure on construction and furnishing the complex between 1919 and 1947 as \"under $10,000,000\".\n\nThomas Aidala suggests a slightly more precise figure for the overall cost at between $7.2 and $8.2 million. Hearst's relaxed approach to using the funds of his companies, and sometimes the companies themselves, to make personal purchases made clear accounting for expenditure almost impossible.\n\nIn 1927 one of his lawyers wrote:\n\n\"The entire history of your corporation\n\nshows an informal method of withdrawal\n\nof funds\".\n\nIn 1945, when the Hearst Corporation was closing the Hearst Castle account for the final time, Morgan gave a breakdown of construction costs, which did not include expenditure on antiques and furnishings.\n\nCasa Grande's build cost is given as $2,987,000, and that for the guest houses, $500,000. Other works, including nearly half a million dollars on the Neptune pool, brought the total to $4,717,000.\n\nMorgan's fees for twenty-odd years of almost continuous work came to $70,755. Her initial fee was a 6% commission on total costs. This was later increased to 8.5%. Many additional expenses, and challenges in getting prompt payment, led her to receive rather less than this.\n\nKastner suggests that Morgan made an overall profit of $100,000 on the entire, twenty-year, project. Her modest remuneration was unimportant to her. At the height of Hearst's financial travails in the late 1930's, when his debts stood at over $87 million, Morgan wrote to him,\n\n\"I wish you would use me in any way\n\nthat relieves your mind as to the care\n\nof your belongings. There never has\n\nbeen, nor will there be, any charge in\n\nthis connection, it is an honor and a\n\npleasure\".\n\nCasa del Mar\n\nCasa del Mar, the largest of the three guest houses, provided accommodation for Hearst himself until Casa Grande was ready in 1925. He stayed in the house again in 1947, during his last visit to the estate.\n\nCasa del Mar contains 5,350 square feet (546 square meters) of floor space. Although luxuriously designed and furnished, none of the guest houses had kitchen facilities, a lack that sometimes irritated Hearst's guests. Adela Rogers St. Johns recounted her first visit:\n\n\"I rang and asked the maid for coffee.\n\nWith a smile, she said I would have to\n\ngo up to the castle for that.\n\nI asked Marion Davies about this. She\n\nsaid W. R. Hearst did not approve of\n\nbreakfast in bed.\"\n\nAdjacent to Casa del Mar is the wellhead from Phoebe Hearst's Hacienda del Pozo de Verona, which Hearst moved to San Simeon when he sold his mother's estate after her death in 1919.\n\nCasa del Monte\n\nCasa del Monte was the first of the guest houses, originally entitled simply Houses A (del Mar), B (del Monte) and C (del Sol). It was built by Morgan on the slopes below the site of Casa Grande during 1920–1924.\n\nHearst had initially wanted to commence work with the construction of the main house, but Morgan persuaded him to begin with the guest cottages because the smaller structures could be completed more quickly.\n\nEach guest house faces the Esplanade, and appears as a single story at its front entrance. Additional stories descend rearward down the terraced mountain side. Casa del Monte has 2,550 sq ft (237 sq. meters) of living space.\n\nCasa del Sol\n\nThe decorative style of the Casa del Sol is Moorish, accentuated by the use of antique Persian tiles. A bronze copy of Donatello's David stands atop a copy of an original Spanish fountain.\n\nThe inspiration for the fountain came from an illustration in a book, The Minor Ecclesiastical, Domestic and Garden Architecture of Southern Spain, written by Austin Whittlesey and published in 1919.\n\nHearst sent a copy to Morgan, while retaining another for himself, and it proved a fertile source of ideas. The size of the house is 3,620 square feet (242 sq. meters).\n\nMorgan's staff were responsible for the cataloguing of those parts of Hearst's art collection which were shipped to California, and an oral record made in the 1980's indicates the methodology used for furnishing the buildings at San Simeon:\n\n\"We would set the object up, and then I would\n\nstand with a yardstick to give it scale. Sam Crow\n\nwould take a picture. Then we would give it a\n\nnumber and I would write a description.\n\nThese were made into albums.\n\nWhen Mr Hearst would write and say 'I want a\n\nFlorentine mantel in Cottage C in Room B, and\n\nfour yards of tiles,' then we would look it up in\n\nthe books and find something that would fit.\"\n\nCasa Grande\n\nConstruction of Casa Grande began in April 1922. Work continued almost until Hearst's final departure on the 2nd. May 1947, and even then the house was unfinished. The size of Casa Grande is 68,500 square feet (5,634 sq. meters).\n\nThe main western façade is four stories. The entrance front, inspired by a gateway in Seville, is flanked by twin bell towers modeled on the tower of the church of Santa Maria la Mayor.\n\nThe layout of the main house was originally to a T-plan, with the assembly room to the front, and the refectory at a right angle to its center. The subsequent extensions of the North and South wings modified the original design.\n\nAs elsewhere, the core construction material is concrete, though the façade is faced in stone. In October 1927 Morgan wrote to Arthur Byne:\n\n\"We finally took the bull by the horns\n\nand are facing the entire main building\n\nwith a Manti stone from Utah.\"\n\nMorgan assured Hearst that it would be \"the making of the building\".\n\nA cast-stone balcony fronts the second floor, and another in cast-iron the third. Above this is a large wooden overhang or gable. This was constructed in Siamese teak, originally intended to outfit a ship, which Morgan located in San Francisco.\n\nThe carving was undertaken by her senior carver Jules Suppo. Sara Holmes Boutelle suggests Morgan may have been inspired by a somewhat similar example at the Mission San Xavier del Bac in Arizona. The façade terminates with the bell towers, comprising the Celestial suites, the carillon towers and two cupolas.\n\nThe curator Victoria Kastner notes a particular feature of Casa Grande, the absence of any grand staircases. Access to the upper floors is either by elevators or stairwells in the corner turrets of the building. Many of the stairwells are undecorated and the plain, poured concrete contrasts with the richness of the decoration elsewhere.\n\nThe terrace in front of the entrance, named Central Plaza, has a quatrefoil pond at its center, with a statue of Galatea on a Dolphin. The statue was inherited, having been bought by Phoebe Hearst when her son was temporarily short of money.\n\nThe doorway from the Central Plaza into Casa Grande illustrates Morgan and Hearst's relaxed approach to combining genuine antiques with modern reproductions to achieve the effects they both desired. A 16th.-century iron gate from Spain is topped by a fanlight grille, constructed in a matching style in the 1920's by Ed Trinkeller, the castle's main ironmonger.\n\nThe castle made use of the latest technology. Casa Grande was wired with an early sound system, allowing guests to make music selections which were played from a Capehart phonograph located in the basement, and piped into rooms in the house through a system of speakers. Alternatively, six radio stations were available.\n\nThe entire estate was also equipped with 80 telephones, operated through a PBX switchboard, which was staffed 24 hours a day, and ran under the exclusive exchange 'Hacienda'.\n\nFortune recorded an example of Hearst's delighting in the ubiquitous access the system provided:\n\n\"A guest) fell to wondering about the result\n\nof a ball game while seated by a campfire\n\nwith Mr Hearst, a day's ride from the castle.\n\n'I'll tell you' volunteers Mr Hearst and,\n\nfumbling with the rock against which he was\n\nleaning, pulls from there a telephone, asks\n\nfor New York, and relieves his guest's curiosity\".\n\nThe Assembly Room\n\nThe assembly room is the main reception room of the castle, described in 1985 by Taylor Coffman as:\n\n\"One of San Simeon's most\n\nmagnificent interiors\".\n\nThe fireplace, originally from a Burgundian chateau in Jours-lès-Baigneux, is named the Great Barney Mantel, after a previous owner, Charles T. Barney, from whose estate Hearst bought it after Barney's suicide.\n\nThe ceiling is from an Italian palazzo. A concealed door in the paneling next to the fireplace allowed Hearst to surprise his guests by entering unannounced. The door opened off an elevator which connected with his Gothic suite on the third floor.\n\nThe assembly room, completed in 1926, is nearly 2,500 square feet in extent, and was described by the writer and illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans as:\n\n\"Looking like half of Grand\n\nCentral Station\".\n\nThe room held some of Hearst's best tapestries. These include four from a set celebrating the Roman general Scipio Africanus, designed by Giulio Romano, and two copied from drawings by Peter Paul Rubens depicting The Triumph of Religion.\n\nThe need to fit the tapestries above the paneling and below the roof required the installation of the unusually low windows.\n\nThe room has the only piece of Victorian decorative art in the castle, the Orchid Vase lamp, made by Tiffany for the Exposition Universelle held in Paris in 1889. It was bought by Phoebe Hearst, who had the original vase converted to a lamp. William placed it in the assembly room in tribute to his mother.\n\nThe Refectory\n\nThe refectory was the only dining room in the castle, and was built between 1926 and 1927. The choir stalls which line the walls are from the La Seu d'Urgell Cathedral in Catalonia, and the silk flags mounted on the walls are Palio banners from Siena.\n\nHearst originally intended a \"vaulted Moorish ceiling\" for the room but, finding nothing suitable, he and Morgan settled on the Italian Renaissance example, dating from around 1600, which Hearst purchased from a dealer in Rome in 1924.\n\nVictoria Kastner considered that the flat roof, with life-size carvings of saints:\n\n\"Strikes a discordant note of\n\nhorizontality among the vertical\n\nlines of the room\".\n\nThe style of the whole is Gothic, in contrast to the Renaissance approach adopted in the preceding assembly room. The refectory is said to have been Morgan's favorite interior within the castle.\n\nThe design of both the refectory and the assembly room was greatly influenced by the monumental architectural elements, especially the fireplaces and the choir stalls used as wainscoting, and works of art, particularly the tapestries, which Hearst determined would be incorporated into the rooms.\n\nThe central table provided seating for 22 in its usual arrangement of two tables, which could be extended to three or four, on the occasion of larger gatherings. The tables were sourced from an Italian monastery, and were the setting for some of the best pieces from Hearst's collection of silverware. One of the finest is a wine cooler dating from the early 18th. century and weighing 14.2 kg by the Anglo-French silversmith David Willaume.\n\nThe Library\n\nThe library is on the second floor, directly above the assembly room. The ceiling is 16th. century Spanish, and a remnant is used in the library's lobby. It comprises three separate ceilings, from different rooms in the same Spanish house, which Morgan combined into one.\n\nThe fireplace is the largest Italian example in the castle. Carved from limestone, it is attributed to the medieval sculptor and architect Benedetto da Maiano.\n\nThe library contains a collection of over 5,000 books, with another 3,700 in Hearst's study above. The majority of the library collections, including Hearst's choicest pieces from his sets of, often signed, first editions by Charles Dickens, his favorite author, were sold at sales at Parke-Bernet at 1939 and Gimbels in 1941. The library is also the location for much of Hearst's important holding of antique Greek vases.\n\nThe Cloisters and the Doge's Suite\n\nThe Cloisters form a grouping of four bedrooms above the refectory and, along with the Doge's Suite above the breakfast room, were completed in 1926. The Doge's Suite was occupied by Millicent Hearst on her rare visits to the castle.\n\nThe room is lined with blue silk, and has a Dutch painted ceiling, in addition to two more of Spanish origin, which was once the property of architect Stanford White.\n\nMorgan also incorporated an original Venetian loggia in the suite, refashioned as a balcony. The suite leads on to Morgan's inventive North and South Duplex apartments, with sitting areas and bathrooms at entry level and bedrooms on mezzanine floors above.\n\nThe Gothic Suite\n\nThe Gothic suite was Hearst's private apartment on the third floor. He moved there in 1927. It comprises the Gothic study or library and Hearst's own South Gothic bedroom and private sitting room.\n\nThe ceiling of the bedroom is one of the best Hearst bought; Spanish, of the 14th. century, it was discovered by his Iberian agent Arthur Byne who also located the original frieze panels which had been detached and sold some time before.\n\nThe whole was installed at the castle in 1924. The space originally allocated for the study was too low to create the impression desired by Morgan and Hearst, a difficulty Morgan surmounted by raising the roof and supporting the ceiling with concrete trusses.\n\nThese, and the walls, were painted with frescoes by Camille Solon. Light was provided by two ranges of clerestory windows. The necessity of raising the roof to incorporate the study occasioned one of the few instances where Hearst hesitated:\n\n\"I telegraphed you my fear of the cost...\n\nI imagine it would be ghastly.\"\n\nNevertheless Morgan urged further changes and expense. The result vindicated Morgan. The study, completed in 1931, is dominated by a portrait of Hearst at age 31, painted by his life-long friend, Orrin Peck.\n\nThe Celestial Suites\n\nThe Celestial bedrooms, with a connecting, shared, sitting room, were created between 1924 and 1926. The bell towers were raised to improve the proportions of the building, and the suites constructed in the spaces created below.\n\nThe relatively cramped spaces allowed no room for storage, and en-suite bathrooms were \"awkwardly squeezed\" into lower landings. Ludwig Bemelmans, a guest in the 1930's, recalled:\n\n\"There was no place to hang your\n\nclothes, so I hung mine on wire\n\ncoat hangers that a former tenant\n\nhad left hanging on the arms of\n\ntwo six-armed gold candelabra,\n\nthe rest I put on the floor\".\n\nThe sitting room contains one of the most important paintings in Hearst's collection, Bonaparte Before the Sphinx (1868) by Jean-Léon Gérôme. The suites are linked externally by a walkway, the Celestial Bridge, which is decorated with elaborate tiling.\n\nThe North and South Wings\n\nThe North, or Billiard, and the South, or Service, wings complete the castle, and were begun in 1929.\n\nThe North wing houses the billiard room on the first floor, which was converted from the original breakfast room. It has a Spanish antique ceiling and a French fireplace, and contains the oldest tapestry in the castle, a Millefleur hunting scene woven in Flanders in the 15th. century.\n\nThe spandrel over the doorcase is decorated with a frieze of 16th. century Persian tiles depicting a battle. The 34 tiles originate from Isfahan and were purchased by Hearst at the Kevorkian sale in New York in 1922.\n\nThe theater, which leads off the billiard room, was used both for amateur theatricals and the showing of movies from Hearst's Cosmopolitan Studios. The theater accommodated fifty guests and had an electric keyboard that enabled the bells in the carillon towers to be played. The walls are decorated in red damask, which originally hung in the Assembly room, and feature gilded caryatids.\n\nThe upper stories of the North Wing were the last to be worked upon, and were never completed. Activity recommenced in 1945 and Morgan delegated the work to her assistant, Warren McClure. Many of the rooms are unfinished, but Aidala considers that the bathrooms in the wing represent first-rate examples of streamline design.\n\nThe Service Wing contains the kitchen. The hotel-scale units and worktops are constructed in Monel Metal, an expensive form of nickel alloy invented in 1901. The wing contains further bedroom suites, a staff dining room, and gives entry to the 9,000 square foot basement which contained a wine cellar, pantries, the boiler plant which heated the main house, and a barber shop, for the use of Hearst's guests.\n\nPlanned but Uncompleted Elements\n\nHearst and Morgan intended a large ballroom or cloister to connect the North and South wings at the rear of Casa Grande and unify the whole composition, but it was never undertaken.\n\nIn 1932, Hearst contemplated incorporating the reja (grille) he had acquired from Valladolid Cathedral in 1929 into this room. He described his vision in a letter to Morgan dated that year:\n\n\"A great ballroom and banqueting hall,\n\nthat is the scheme! Isn't it a pippin.\"\n\nThe letter was signed \"Sincerely, Your Assistant Architect\".\n\nOther structures that did not develop beyond drawings and plans included two more guest houses, in English and Chinese architectural styles.\n\nCollections\n\nAfter a visit to Ansiglioni's workshop in 1889, William wrote the following in a letter to his mother:\n\n\"Why didn't you buy Ansiglioni's Galatea. It is\n\nsuperb...I have a great notion to buy it myself,\n\nthe one thing that prevents me is a scarcity of\n\nfunds.\n\nThe man wants eight thousand dollars for the\n\nblooming thing. I have the art fever terribly.\n\nQueer, isn't it?\n\nI never miss a gallery and I go and nosey about\n\nthe pictures and statuary and wish they were mine.\"\n\nHearst was a voracious collector of art, with the stated intention of making the castle \"a museum of the best things that I can secure.\"\n\nThe dealer Joseph Duveen, from whom Hearst bought despite their mutual dislike, called him the \"Great Accumulator.\" His robust approach to buying, particularly the purchase and removal of entire historic structures, generated considerable ill-feeling, and sometimes outright opposition.\n\nWilliam's deconstruction and removal of the 14th. century Bradenstoke Priory in England led the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings to organize a campaign which used language so violent that its posters had to be pasted over for fear of a libel suit.\n\nHearst sometimes encountered similar opposition elsewhere. In 1919 he was writing to Morgan about:\n\n\"The patio from Bergos (sic) which, by the\n\nway, I own but cannot get out of Spain\".\n\nThe dismantling of a monastery in Sacramenia, which Hearst bought in its entirety in the 1920's, saw his workmen attacked by enraged villagers.\n\nHearst's tardiness in paying his bills was another less attractive feature of his purchasing approach; in 1925 Morgan was obliged to write to Arthur Byne:\n\n\"Mr. Hearst accepts your\n\ndictum – cash or nothing\".\n\nSome of the finest pieces from the collections of books and manuscripts, tapestries, paintings, antiquities and sculpture, amounting to about half of Hearst's total art holdings, were sold in sales in the late 1930's and early 1940's, when Hearst's publishing empire was facing financial collapse, but a great deal remains.\n\nWilliam's art buying had started when he was young and, in his tested fashion, he established a company, the International Studio Arts Corporation, as a vehicle for purchasing works and as a means of dealing with their export and import.\n\nIn 1975, the Hearst Corporation donated the archive of Hearst's Brooklyn warehouses, the gathering point for almost all of his European acquisitions before their dispersal to his many homes, to Long Island University.\n\nAs of 2015, the university has embarked on a digitization project which will ultimately see the 125 albums of records, and sundry other materials, made available online.\n\nAntiquities\n\nThe ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities are the oldest works in Hearst's collection. The oldest of all are the stone figures of the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet which stand on the South Esplanade below Casa Grande. They date from the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, approximately 1550 to 1189 BC.\n\nMorgan designed the pool setting for the pieces, with tiling inspired by ancient Egyptian motifs. In the courtyard of Casa del Monte is one of a total of nine Roman sarcophagi collected by Hearst, dated to 230 AD, and previously held at the Palazzo Barberini, which was acquired at the Charles T. Yerkes sale in 1910.\n\nThe most important element of the antiquities collection is the holding of Greek vases, on display in the second-floor library. Although 65 vases were purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York after Hearst's death, those which remain at the castle still form one of the world's largest private groups. Hearst began collecting vases in 1901, and his collection was moved from his New York homes to the castle in 1935.\n\nAt its peak, the collection numbered over 400 pieces. The vases were placed on the tops of the bookshelves in the library, each carefully wired in place to guard against vibrations from earthquakes. At the time of Hearst's collecting, many of the vases were believed to be of Etruscan manufacture, but later scholars ascribe all of them to Greece.\n\nSculptures\n\nHearst often bought multiple lots from sales of major collections; in 1930 he purchased five antique Roman statues from the Lansdowne sale in London. Four are now in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and one in the Metropolitan.\n\nWilliam collected bronzes as well as marble figures; a cast of a stone original of Apollo and Daphne by Bernini, dating from around 1617, stands in the Doge's suite.\n\nIn addition to his classical sculptures, Hearst was content to acquire 19th. century versions, or contemporary copies of ancient works:\n\n\"If we cannot find the right thing\n\nin a classic statue, we can find a\n\nmodern one\".\n\nHe was a particular patron of Charles Cassou, and also favored the early 19th. century Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen whose Venus Victorious remains at the castle.\n\nBoth this, and the genuinely classical Athena from the collection of Thomas Hope, were displayed in the Assembly room, along with the Venus Italica by Antonio Canova. Other works by Thorvaldsen include the four large marble medallions in the Assembly room depicting society's virtues.\n\nTwo 19th. century marbles are in the anteroom to the Assembly room, Bacchante, by Frederick William MacMonnies, a copy of his bronze original, and Pygmalion and Galatea by Gérôme.\n\nA monumental statue of Galatea, attributed to Leopoldo Ansiglioni and dating from around 1882, stands in the center of the pool on the Main terrace in front of Casa Grande.\n\nTextiles\n\nTapestries include the Scipio set by Romano in the Assembly room, two from a set telling the Biblical story of Daniel in the Morning room, and the millefleur hunting scene in the Billiard room. The hunting scene is particularly rare, one of only \"a handful from this period in the world\".\n\nHearst also assembled and displayed an important collection of Navajo textiles at San Simeon, including blankets, rugs and serapes. Most were purchased from Herman Schweizer, who ran the Indian Department of the Fred Harvey Company.\n\nOriginally gathered at Hearst's hacienda at Jolon, they were moved to Wyntoon in 1940 before being brought to San Simeon. They were finally donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1942.\n\nHearst was always interested in pieces that had historical and cultural connections to the history of California and Central and Latin America. The North Wing contains two Peruvian armorial banners. Dating from the 1580's, they show the shields of Don Luis Jerónimo Fernández Cabrera y Bobadilla, Count of Chinchón and viceroy of Peru.\n\nNathaniel Burt, the composer and critic evaluated the collections at San Simeon thus:\n\n\"Far from being the mere kitsch that\n\nmost easterners have been led to\n\nbelieve, San Simeon is full of real\n\nbeauties and treasures\".\n\nPaintings\n\nThe art collection includes works by Tintoretto, whose portrait of Alvisius Vendramin hangs in the Doge's suite, Franz Xaver Winterhalter who carried out the double portraits of Maximilian I of Mexico and his empress Carlota, located in Casa del Mar, and two portraits of Napoléon by Jean-Léon Gérôme.\n\nHearst's earliest painting, a Madonna and Child from the school of Duccio di Buoninsegna, dates from the early 14th. century. A gift from his friend, the editor Cissy Patterson, the painting hangs in Hearst's bedroom.\n\nPortrait of a Woman, by Giulio Campi, hangs in a bedroom in the North Wing. In 1928 Hearst acquired the Madonna and Child with Two Angels, by Adriaen Isenbrandt.\n\nThe curator Taylor Coffman describes this work, which hangs in the Casa del Mar sitting room, as perhaps \"San Simeon's finest painting\". In 2018, a previously unattributed Annunciation in the Assembly room was identified as a work of 1690 by Bartolomé Pérez.\n\nThe Gardens and Grounds of Hearst Castle\n\nThe Esplanade, a curving, paved walkway, connects the main house with the guest cottages; Hearst described it as:\n\n\"Giving a finished touch to the big\n\nhouse, to frame it in, as it were.\"\n\nMorgan designed the pedestrianized pavement with great care, to create a coup de théâtre for guests, desiring:\n\n\"A strikingly noble and saississant effect\n\nbe impressed upon everyone on arrival.\"\n\nHearst concurred:\n\n\"Heartily approve. I certainly want that\n\nsaississant effect. I don't know what it\n\nis, but I think we ought to have at least\n\none such on the premises\".\n\nA feature of the gardens are the lampposts topped with alabaster globes; modeled on \"janiform hermae\", the concept was Hearst's. The Swan lamps, remodeled with alabaster globe lights to match the hermae, were designed by Morgan's chief draftsman, Thaddeus Joy.\n\nOthers who influenced Hearst and Morgan in their landscaping include Charles Adams Platt, an artist and gardener who had made a particular study of the layout and planting of Italian villas. Also Nigel Keep, Hearst's orchardman, who worked at San Simeon from 1922 to 1947, and Albert Webb, Hearst's English head gardener who was at the hill from 1922 to 1948.\n\nThe Neptune Pool\n\nThe Neptune Pool, \"the most sumptuous swimming pool on earth\", is located near the edge of the hilltop. It is enclosed by a retaining wall and underpinned by a framework of concrete struts to allow for movement in the event of earthquakes.\n\nThe pool is often cited as an example of Hearst's changeability; it was reconstructed three times before he was finally satisfied. Originally begun as an ornamental pond, it was first expanded in 1924 as Millicent Hearst desired a swimming pool.\n\nIt was enlarged again during 1926–1928 to accommodate Cassou's statuary. Finally, in 1934, it was extended again to act as a setting for a Roman temple, in part original and in part comprising elements from other structures which Hearst transported from Europe and had reconstructed at the site.\n\nThe pool holds 345,000 gallons of water, and is equipped with seventeen shower and changing rooms. It was heated by oil-fired burners. In early 2014, the pool was drained due to drought conditions and leakage.\n\nAfter a long-term restoration project to fix the leaking, the pool was refilled in August 2018. The restoration of the pool was recognized with a Preservation Design Award for Craftsmanship from the California Preservation Foundation in 2019.\n\nThe pool is well-supplied with sculpture, particularly works by Charles Cassou. His centerpiece, opposite the Roman temple, is The Birth of Venus. An even larger sculptural grouping, depicting Neptune in a chariot drawn by four horses, was commissioned to fill the empty basin above the Venus. Although carved, it was never installed.\n\nRoman Pool\n\nThe Roman Pool, constructed under the tennis courts, provided an indoor alternative to the Neptune pool. Originally mooted by Hearst in 1927, construction did not begin until 1930, and the pool was not completed until 1935.\n\nHearst initially wanted the pool to be fed by salt-water, but the design challenges proved to be insuperable. A disastrous attempt to fulfill Hearst's desires by pouring 20 tons of washed rock salt into the pool saw the disintegration of the cast-iron heat exchanger and pump.\n\nInspiration for the mosaic decoration came from the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna. The tiles are of Murano glass, with gold-leaf, and were designed by Solon and manufactured in San Francisco.\n\nAlthough a pool of \"spectacular beauty\", it was little used as it was located in a less-visited part of the complex.\n\nThe Pergola and Zoo\n\nTwo other major features of the grounds were the pergola and the zoo. The pergola, an ornamental bridleway, runs to the west of Casa Grande. Comprising concrete columns, covered in espaliered fruit trees, Morgan ensured that it was built to a height sufficient to allow Hearst, \"a tall man with a tall hat on a tall horse\", to ride unimpeded down its mile-long length.\n\nPlans for a zoo, to house Hearst's large collection of wild animals, were drawn up by Morgan, and included an elephant house and separate enclosures for antelopes, camels, zebras and bears. The zoo was never constructed, but a range of shelters and pits were built, sited on Orchard Hill.\n\nThe Estate\n\nAt the height of Hearst's ownership, the estate totaled more than 250,000 acres. W. C. Fields commented on the extent of the estate while on a visit:\n\n\"Wonderful place to bring up children.\n\nYou can send them out to play. They\n\nwon't come back till they're grown.\"\n\n23 miles to the north of the castle, Morgan constructed the Milpitas Hacienda, a ranch-house that acted as a trianon to the main estate, and as a focus for riding expeditions.\n\nAppraisals of Hearst Castle\n\nAs with Hearst himself, Hearst Castle and its collections have been the subject of considerable criticism. From the 1940's the view of Hearst and Morgan's most important joint creation as the phantasmagorical Xanadu of Orson Welles's imagination has been commonplace.\n\nSome literary depictions were gently mocking; P. G. Wodehouse's novel of 1953, The Return of Jeeves has a character describe her stay:\n\n\"I remember visiting San Simeon once,\n\nand there was a whole French Abbey\n\nlying on the grass.\"\n\nJohn Steinbeck's unnamed description was certainly of Hearst:\n\n\"They's a fella, newspaper fella near the\n\ncoast, got a million acres. Fat, sof' fella\n\nwith little mean eyes an' a mouth like a\n\nass-hole\".\n\nThe writer John Dos Passos went further, explicitly referencing Hearst in the third volume of his 1938 U.S.A trilogy:\n\n\"The emperor of newsprint retired to his\n\nfief of San Simeon where he built an\n\nAndalusian palace and there spends his\n\nlast years amid the relaxing adulations\n\nof screen stars, admen, screenwriters,\n\npublicity-men, columnists.\n\nUntil he dies, a spent Caesar grown old\n\nwith spending.\"\n\nThe English architectural writer Clive Aslet was little more complimentary about the castle. Disliking its \"unsympathetic texture of poured concrete\", he described it as \"best seen from a distance\".\n\nThe unfinished, and unresolved, rear façade of Casa Grande has been the subject of particular negative comment; Carleton Winslow and Nicola Frye, in their history from 1980, suggest:\n\n\"The flanking North and South wings\n\ncompete rather disastrously with the\n\ncentral doge's suite block.\"\n\nOthers questioned the castle's very existence; the architect Witold Rybczynski asked:\n\n\"What is this Italian villa doing on the\n\nCalifornian Coastal Range? A costly\n\npiece of theatrical décor that ignores\n\nits context and lacks meaning.\"\n\nHearst's collections were similarly disparaged. The art historian William George Constable echoed Joseph Duveen when he assessed Hearst as:\n\n\"Not a collector but a gigantic\n\nand voracious magpie.\"\n\nLater decades after Hearst's death have seen a more sympathetic and appreciative evaluation of his collections, and the estate he and Morgan created to house them.\n\nThe director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Thomas Hoving, although listing Hearst only at number 83 in his evaluation of America's top 101 art collectors, wrote:\n\n\"Hearst is being reevaluated. He may\n\nhave been much more of a collector\n\nthan was thought at the time of his\n\ndeath.\"\n\nThe curator Mary Levkoff, in her 2008 study, Hearst the Collector, contends that he was indeed a collector, describing the four separate \"staggeringly important\" collections of antique vases, tapestries, armor and silver which Hearst had brought together.\n\nShe wrote of the challenge of bringing their artistic merit to light from under the shadow of his own reputation.\n\nOf Morgan's building, its stock has risen with the re-evaluation of her standing and accomplishments, which saw her inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2008. She became the first woman to receive the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 2014, and to have an obituary in The New York Times as recently as 2019.\n\nThe writer John Julius Norwich recorded his recantation after a visit to the castle:\n\n\"I went prepared to mock; I remained\n\nto marvel. Hearst Castle is a palace in\n\nevery sense of the word.\""
