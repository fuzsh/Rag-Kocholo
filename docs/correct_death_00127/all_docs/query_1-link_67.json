Makes the audience come back for more, and it means we never have to end the darn thing! ”\n\n–William Randolph Hearst, Goliath\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst is an American businessman and media magnate. He owns papers all over the United States, and finances motion pictures.\n\nHearst seems to have Clanker leanings. Adela Rogers and Philip Francis both work for him and call him \"the chief\". According to Tesla, Hearst is \"a bit odd.\"\n\nIn the series[]\n\nWhen the Leviathan lands in California, Hearst invites Alek, Captain Hobbes, Count Volger and Dr. Barlow to dinner, where he shows them one of his latest films, The Perils of Pauline, a serial that ends in a cliffhanger. Hearst takes several newsreels of Alek, and sends Mr. Francis to take more of Alek in Mexico, where Hearst has a movie deal with Pancho Villa. Much of Hearst's mansion is surrounded by movie sets, so it looks hollow from certain angles, but much larger than the actual mansion.\n\nSee also[]"
