She was long suspected of being the illegitimate daughter of actress Marion Davies and publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst.\n\nThe 1925 New York State census record, however, states clearly that she was the daughter of George Van Cleve and his wife Rosemary Douras Davies, the sister of film star Marion Davies.\n\nAccording to the Magazine Americana, published by The Institute for the Study of American Popular Culture, George Van Cleve kidnapped Patricia in 1924 and went into hiding. Hearst's detectives allegedly located the pair after five years and the child was returned to Rose's custody, only to be returned to Van Cleve's custody after a court decision.\n\nA 1928 ship's passenger list shows Patricia, age 8, returning to the United States aboard the S.S. Hamburg from the port of Boulogne sur Mer, France.\n\nYearbook records indicate that Patricia graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1936 or 1937.\n\nPatricia married to Arthur William Silverlake, aka Arthur Lake, in May 1937.\n\nThe 1940 U.S. Census shows the young couple living at 212 Mabery Road, in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, California.\n\nShe was selected by the Motion Picture Publicists Association to be one of the MPPA 'Baby Stars' of 1940, an award similar to the WAMPAS Baby Stars selections of 1922 through 1934.\n\nThe 1950 U.S. Census shows Patricia living with her family at 1051 San Vincente, Santa Monica, CA, a property listed on the University of California's Calisphere.org website as the Arthur Lake Residence (includes photos).\n\nShow Business Career\n\nWikipedia and Patricia's Find A Grave biography tell us: \"Lake performed in theater during the late 1930s through the mid-1940s. When after 7 years Penny Singleton left the radio sitcom Blondie in the mid-1940s, Mrs. Lake, the former Patricia Van Cleve, replaced her as the voice of Blondie Bumstead for the remaining five years of the show, opposite her real-life husband Arthur Lake, who played Blondie's spouse, Dagwood.\n\n\"In 1954, she also co-starred with her husband in an early television sitcom he created called Meet the Family.\n\n\"After her death in 1993, Lake's family claimed that she was actually the daughter of Davies and Hearst, born during a trip the pair took to France in 1923. The Lake family asserted that the newborn was given to Davies' sister, whose own child had died in infancy, and that the dead child's birth certificate was altered to support the deception. It was reported by CBS News that Hearst is alleged to have acknowledged to Lake on her wedding day that he was her father.\n\nSources\n\nPatricia Lake - Wikipedia\n\nPatricia Lake (1919 - 1993) - IMDb\n\nInternet Archive Results for search on \"Patricia Van Cleve\" (192 results).\n\nFind a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/13387117/patricia-lake : accessed 03 December 2021), memorial page for Patricia Van Cleve Lake (18 Jun 1923–3 Oct 1993), Find a Grave Memorial ID 13387117, citing Hollywood Forever, Hollywood, Los Angeles County, California, USA ; Maintained by Find a Grave.\n\nLos Angeles Times, \"Marion Davies, Former Film Star, Dies at 64,\" Saturday 23 September 1961, p. 1 Col. 5.
