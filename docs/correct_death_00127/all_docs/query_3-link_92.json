outfits.\n\nCary Grant showed up as a trapeze artist.\n\nAs they crossed a special gangway, a burst of air puffed up the ladies' skirts.\n\nA full-sized carousel, imported from the Warner Studios lot, swept the revelers in circles.\n\nPresiding over the festivities, in a ringmaster's gaudy outfit, was the newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst.\n\nHe had thrown the party in April of 1937 to celebrate his 74th birthday at the Santa Monica mansion of his mistress, the film star Marion Davies.\n\nThe theme of the evening was \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\"\n\nIt was a fitting tribute to Hearst, whose career had often resembled a three-ring circus.\n\nBy the strength of his personality and a seemingly endless reservoir of money from his family's fortune, he had become America's most powerful and controversial media tycoon.\n\nDAVID NASAW: We live in a world that's dominated by media.\n\nIt's with us when we wake up in the morning, when we have our lunch, when we go to bed at night.\n\nIt's the air we breathe.\n\n♪ ♪ ANDIE TUCHER: He made journalism really important, whether or not you believed that he was doing good journalism.\n\nHe made the act of publishing news and intelligence and opinion and sensation, he made that act really important.\n\n(typewriters clacking) GREG YOUNG: I think in almost every form of media today, you can see traces of this Hearst ideology: the flamboyance, the fearlessness, the sort of pushing right to the edge in a way to make these direct contacts with the American people.\n\nGARY KAMIYA: He brought narrative, he brought melodrama, he brought variety-- the marketing, the hype, the sensationalism.\n\nBut I think at the same time the lack of concern with objective truth, the out-and-out lies, out-and-out fabrications, out-and-out distortions were pernicious.\n\nAnd we've seen them having effects on journalism even today.\n\n♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (people chattering) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (horse trotting, trolley bells ringing) ♪ ♪ (horses trotting) NARRATOR: William Randolph Hearst, at age 22, was just another rich kid, one of a hundred aspiring tycoons in New York City, all hoping to blaze their name in history.\n\nHe was a senior at Harvard College, and was yet again on the brink of expulsion.\n\nHe'd been sent down by his parents to cram for his looming final exams.\n\nBut when, exactly, was Will Hearst supposed to study?\n\n♪ ♪ (crowd cheering) At night, a newly electrified Broadway called out to him with endless shows and performances.\n\nHe loved the theater, adored chorus girls, and knew all the steps to the Vaudeville shuffle.\n\nThen, in the morning, there were the newspapers.\n\n(people clamoring, horse whinnying) ♪ ♪ There was something for every taste and appetite-- papers that cost only a penny or two, catering to the city's 1.5 million souls.\n\nEvery single edition hand set on rotary presses, dashing off 24,000 copies an hour.\n\n(press churning) This was really an absolute golden age for newspapers.\n\nThe greatest concentration of New York publishers were on one street called Publishers Row or Newspaper Row and it was right across the street from City Hall.\n\nIt would have been one of the busiest places in the city, with the smell of ink, the smell of newsprint, horse cars and newsies coming to pick up their newspapers to go deliver them.\n\nTUCHER: Newspapers would come out throughout the day.\n\nThere would be the 10:00 edition and then something else at noon, then something else at 2:00.\n\nSo the presses were always going.\n\nThe staffs were always working.\n\nSitting atop this industry, this vast effort to present news to the American people, put the publisher in a very powerful position.\n\nYou could shape the opinions and the interests and the desires of your readers.\n\nYou were a name people knew.\n\nKAMIYA: Newspaper publishers and editors are truly kings among men.\n\nThere was no other communicative mass media.\n\nSo editors, in effect, strode the earth like colossi.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: The newspaper game was irresistible to Hearst.\n\nYoung as he was, he already knew he wanted to be a player.\n\nHe'd told his mother that he was searching for something.\n\n\"Something,\" he wrote, \"where I could make a name.\"\n\nIn fact, he was already somewhat notorious.\n\n(bell tolling) In the three years he'd been at Harvard, everyone on campus had definitely heard of Will Hearst.\n\nVICTORIA KASTNER: Will Hearst was a phenomenon.\n\nHe had an alligator that he took on a leash into class with him named \"Champagne Charlie\" because it was a beverage that the alligator liked.\n\nNASAW: He had an entourage that came with him.\n\nHe had a full-time valet at Harvard.\n\nHe had a huge allowance.\n\nHe had not a dorm room, but apartments and enough money to entertain all his undergraduates.\n\nNARRATOR: Hearst was great fun.\n\nThough he stopped drinking in his junior year, he was a spectacular host and any excuse was a good one for a wild party.\n\nClassmates described him as \"a mixture of boyishness and devilishness,\" and elected him to all the most exclusive frats and elite societies.\n\nHe'd once released hundreds of roosters into Harvard Yard.\n\nThen had commissioned several professors' portraits-- on chamber pots.\n\n(distant laughter) Hearst even took to the stage as a member of the Hasty Pudding theater club.\n\nKASTNER: Will Hearst was very bright.\n\nBut he was not particularly interested in showing up regularly to class.\n\nWhat really made him passionate was when he became the business editor of the \"Harvard Lampoon.\"\n\nNARRATOR: The \"Harvard Lampoon\" was the college humor magazine with the reputation of being \"always late and not always funny.\"\n\nKASTNER: The business editor was the job that they always gave to the richest boy on campus because it always bled money.\n\nIt was expected that he would be subsidizing the \"Lampoon\" but actually, he made it a success financially.\n\nHe sold ads and that was the beginning-- you know, his first whiff of newsprint.\n\nNARRATOR: He'd secured the support of Boston's finest tailors, jewelers, and even carriage makers.\n\nIn just two years, he increased circulation by 50 percent, advertising revenue by 300 percent, and soon he had the magazine out of debt and turning a profit.\n\nBy the fall of his senior year, he knew exactly what he wanted to do, and he couldn't wait to get started.\n\n\"I am a man of business now,\" he wrote home.\n\n\"And I am convinced I could run a newspaper successfully.\n\nI want to go to work.\"\n\n\"Stand in like a man and stick to your studies to the end,\" came his father's reply.\n\nAll it took to pass the final exams was a grade of 50 percent, but Hearst never returned to campus and he was expelled for good.\n\n(wind whipping) NARRATOR: Far out on the high western plains, alone on that unending prairie, Butte, Montana, could not have made a starker contrast with New York City.\n\nIn no way at all did this dusty little town fit in with Will's plans.\n\nBut immediately after his expulsion, his father decided it was time for him to join the family business.\n\nWill was the only son of the mining entrepreneur George Hearst, whose empire included a half dozen silver, gold, and copper mines across the American West.\n\n(whistle blares) Will hated it from the start.\n\n\"Pa, this is the damnedest hole I have ever struck,\" he wrote home.\n\n\"And I am sure the four walls of a prison \"could not present any greater or more melancholy monotony than one obtains from this mine.\"\n\nWill minced no words rejecting the world that for decades had been the source of the family's vast fortune and that meant everything to his father.\n\n♪ ♪ KAMIYA: George Hearst is this rough and tumble guy who comes out from Missouri.\n\nHe was an innate geologist.\n\nHe was an untrained, untutored, natural geologist.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: When gold was found in California back in 1849, he'd hurried west to be part of it.\n\nKAMIYA: The gold rush upended everything.\n\nIt was as if somebody had picked up the entire country and tilted it to the west.\n\nPeople flooded in for this incredible bonanza.\n\nNARRATOR: The promise of great riches drew so many from around the country and around the world, that the population of California increased three hundred times over.\n\nMost of these new arrivals never really had a shot.\n\nMany of them were Chinese immigrants.\n\nIf they wanted to try their luck, the state slapped them with an exorbitant monthly tax, and they faced violence in the mining camps.\n\nBut George Hearst thrived in that world.\n\nHe was a white man from a wealthy family who knew the right lawyers and carried a big gun.\n\nFor him, plenty of venture capital was available to start new mines.\n\nAnd he soon struck it rich with a vast silver cache right on the Nevada border.\n\n(whistle blares) He returned to Missouri a millionaire, and met Phoebe Apperson, a brown-haired teacher 22 years his junior.\n\nNASAW: Phoebe was this demure school teacher who went to church, minded her manners, and George comes into town as this semi-literate scoundrel who cultivated the appearance of a rough-hewn western miner.\n\nAs a woman in the 19th century, practically the only way she could get out to California was to marry the right suitor.\n\nGeorge was ambitious to succeed, he was looking for a sophisticated and cultured woman who could give him a son and an heir.\n\nNARRATOR: William Randolph Hearst was born ten months after George and Phoebe married, in San Francisco, April 29, 1863.\n\nGeorge stayed in town only long enough to see the baby born, then he packed up and left for mining country, leaving his young wife to raise their son alone.\n\nThis was a tough time for Phoebe.\n\nEarly on in her marriage, she was disillusioned, frustrated, terribly lonely.\n\nNARRATOR: She started to travel when Will was still a baby, leaving him with a nurse when she ventured, for months at a time, to the Yosemite Valley, to Idaho, and even as far as Hawaii.\n\nWhen she was home, her son would cling to her.\n\nPhoebe wrote to a friend that, \"He seems to be afraid all the time that I will go away and leave him again.\"\n\nWhenever they were together, she indulged her young son.\n\nNASAW: Phoebe is the most important person in his life.\n\nAs a child he can do no wrong.\n\nShe excuses his failures.\n\nAnd he's told from the beginning he can do whatever he wants to do.\n\nNARRATOR: Phoebe liked to say that Will's forte is an irrepressible imagination.\n\nOnce, to keep her from going to a party, her three-year-old son poured castor oil all over her favorite dress.\n\nA few years later, he set off fireworks in his room.\n\n(fireworks exploding) As smoke filled the house, Will screamed \"Fire!\"\n\nthen locked his bedroom door and waited to see what would happen.\n\n(child giggling) His dangerous prank was barely acknowledged.\n\n(\"La Donna è Mobile\" playing) (children laughing) In 1873, Phoebe set off on an 18-month tour of Europe (\"La Donna è Mobile\" playing) and Will was finally invited to come along.\n\nMother and son crisscrossed the continent, from England to Germany to Holland.\n\nThey spent mornings studying languages together; afternoons in each other's company at galleries and churches and museums.\n\nTen-year-old Will was his mother's date to every dinner, and even accompanied her to a meeting with the Pope.\n\nKAMIYA: Phoebe was very, very close to her only son, Willie.\n\nAnd probably projected a lot of emotional intimacy and closeness onto him that perhaps she didn't always have with her husband.\n\nNASAW: Will grew up in this bizarre, unstable environment where he rarely saw his father.\n\nThe most troubling part of that childhood was the unstable finances.\n\nGeorge Hearst spent his money as fast as he could.\n\n(distant cheering) He had racing stables, he kept buying property, he kept investing the money he made in one mine in another mine.\n\nHe had meteoric ups and downs, and the downs at times were pretty low.\n\nI think Will was too young to realize the real sense of, \"Oh my God, the whole thing could collapse.\"\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: By the time Will was in his teens, George's fortunes had stabilized, and the Hearsts had become one of the richest families in the country.\n\nGeorge had grown his empire across the West and central America-- from Utah, Nevada, South Dakota and Montana, to Mexico.\n\nThere was now plenty of excess capital in the Hearst accounts, and some of it George had earmarked for a new interest.\n\nNASAW: George Hearst, like many other mega-millionaires in California, decides that the best way to spend his money is to run for office.\n\nAnd if you're gonna run for office around the 1880s, the only way to get your name before the public is to own your own newspaper.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense for him to buy \"The Examiner\" in San Francisco.\n\nThere would be a story every day about what George Hearst did, thought, and why George Hearst was an upstanding California citizen.\n\nNARRATOR: By the spring of 1886, George had been sworn in as the Democratic senator from California.\n\nMeanwhile, his 23-year-old son-- the college dropout-- was still loafing around the West.\n\nWill had steadfastly refused to show any interest in the family's mining business, but he'd managed to have the family's paper delivered to every dusty mining town he dropped in on.\n\nHis letters to his father were full of advice about how best to remake what he affectionately called \"our miserable little sheet.\"\n\n\"Now if you could make over to me 'the Examiner' \"with enough money to carry out my schemes I'll tell you what I'd do,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I'd make the paper, as far as possible, original.\"\n\nKAMIYA: The dude was a born newspaperman.\n\nOne of the most impressive things about Hearst is how this undisciplined, you know, spoiled brat, kind of rich kid who's been, you know, traipsing around the west, once he discovers his calling, he zones in on it.\n\nSo to some degree, he went into newspapering because I think he realized, \"This is what I'm good at.\"\n\nNARRATOR: In the face of his son's stubborn certainty, George relented.\n\n\"There's one thing sure about my boy,\" he'd once remarked.\n\n\"When he wants cake, he wants cake.\n\nAnd after a while, he gets his cake.\"\n\n♪ ♪ KASTNER: When Will took over the \"San Francisco Examiner,\" in March of 1887, he was all of 24, it was a second-rate money-losing headache of a newspaper, but he christened it \"the Monarch of the Dailies\" and proceeded to start stirring things up.\n\n(cell door shuts) NARRATOR: It took all of 13 days for the young newspaperman to be arrested for libel.\n\nHis paper accused some supposedly crooked lawyer of taking advantage of the good people of San Francisco.\n\nHearst was in prison just long enough to snag a few national headlines.\n\nBoy was it good to finally be part of the game.\n\n(bell rings, horses trotting) Will Hearst's main competition in the city came from the \"Chronicle,\" and from the \"Call\"-- respectable papers with swanky headquarters designed by leading architects.\n\nThe offices of the \"San Francisco Examiner,\" meanwhile, occupied a squat building on Sacramento Street.\n\nIt didn't look much like the launching place for a revolution.\n\nBut Hearst arrived with several writers from the \"Harvard Lampoon\" and then hired on the very best news people he could find, no matter their price.\n\n\"Dear Papa, I have been trying to find a managing editor.\n\n\"We may be able to get Ballard Smith of the 'New York Herald.'\n\n\"The paper requires a head that has ability and experience.\n\n\"Naturally such a man commands a high salary \"and you must reconcile yourself either to paying it or giving up the paper.\"\n\nHearst realized, \"I can actually make this thing a success, especially if I have basically an unlimited spigot of money.\"\n\n(typewriter clacking, people chatting) ♪ ♪ NARRATOR: New hire Winifred Black, a 24-year-old Midwesterner, claimed that, \"Nowhere was there ever a more brilliant \"or more outrageous, incredible, ridiculous, \"glorious set of typical newspaper people than there was in that shabby old office.\"\n\nKASTNER: Hearst believed that life should be fun, and that meant work should be fun.\n\n(people laughing) KAMIYA: He was in many ways a great boss to work with.\n\nThis madcap exuberance of these mostly young men who were just getting paid a lot of money, they were drinking themselves crazy.\n\nYou know one editor would say, \"Can we fire this guy?\n\nHe's completely drunk.\"\n\nAnd Hearst would go, \"Well, as long as he's sober one day in 30, that's good enough for me.\"\n\nSo he had a very latitudinous attitude towards vice.\n\nHe didn't care about that as long as they delivered the goods.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: The young publisher seemed to fill the newsroom with sheer personality.\n\nHe was a big man, over six feet tall, with a high-pitched voice and piercing blue-gray eyes.\n\nNASAW: Hearst rules with a smile.\n\nHe doesn't yell at anybody, he doesn't fire anybody, but he wants things done his way.\n\n\"This is my newspaper.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Will liked to say, \"I am making a newspaper to suit me.\"\n\n(writing utensil scratching) He wrote many of the headlines himself and reviewed all the copy.\n\nHis name might only appear on the masthead, but his hand was there on every single page.\n\nYOUNG: I think in a way, Hearst was ahead of his time.\n\nPreviously, newspapers were dull as dishwater.\n\nThere were almost no illustrations and there were certainly no photographs back then.\n\nIt was just lines of text and for the most part every newspaper looks like the one from the day before.\n\nJEET HEER: Hearst totally changed the nature of the newspaper.\n\nThe news had to have personality, it had to have character, it could not be dry or simply factual.\n\nFor Hearst, journalism was like boxing.\n\n(bell rings) (punching sounds) The rambunctiousness, the vibrancy, it's bloody.\n\n(punching sounds) It might do damage to your brain, but still you make people root for you and you change how they think.\n\n(crowd clamoring, bell rings) KAMIYA: It had to be punchy, hyperbolic rhetoric, really lurid adjectives.\n\nIt's almost hard to describe it because these techniques have become so engrained in media.\n\nNARRATOR: Soon, \"The Examiner\" had a new slogan that reflected Hearst's obsession: \"There is no substitute for circulation.\"\n\nSTEVE HEARST: He was always thinking about what he could do to attract eyeballs.\n\nHis business was about eyeballs, and \"how many people I can communicate with in a day.\"\n\nHe went after the last grizzly bear in California.\n\nHis editors had chased this bear for weeks and weeks and there were updates in the daily paper, and the Sunday paper would have a larger update, so you'd have to read Monday through Saturday and then he'd capsulize it in a major story on Sunday to build readership.\n\n(crowd clamoring, bear growls) NARRATOR: Finally caught in late October 1889, 20,000 people a day came to gawk at Hearst's big new creature, which he named Monarch, after his paper.\n\nKAMIYA: He was always doing these kinds of stunts.\n\nIt was just naked self-promotion.\n\nAnd in fact the nakedness of it was almost part of its appeal, it was so blatant, it was so ridiculous.\n\nThere was no attempt to be tasteful.\n\nNo, taste was, like, for losers.\n\nNARRATOR: On his 27th birthday, after three years at the helm, he had grown his circulation from a measly 5,000 to well over 55,000, and the young publisher watched those numbers more closely than anyone.\n\nHe had an intuitive understanding of the kind of reporting that sold his papers-- it was all about tapping into his readers' emotions-- all the better if their passions lined up with his politics.\n\nLike his father, Will was a staunch Democrat, at a time when white supremacy was one of the party's core principles.\n\nIn college, he'd performed in blackface with his white friends.\n\nIn every way, \"The Examiner\" was Will Hearst's platform, and his openly racist sentiments would find a place of prominence in its pages.\n\nLOOMIS: He is supportive of a white man's America.\n\nAnd anyone threatening that, be they Black, be they Asian, be they Native, be they Mexican, is somebody who has to be either eliminated or suppressed.\n\n(crowd clamoring) NARRATOR: Now, in 1890, eight years after the passage of a federal ban on immigration called the Chinese Exclusion Act, Hearst aggressively took up against Asian people in California.\n\nNASAW: When Will Hearst takes over \"The Examiner,\" San Francisco is the center of an anti-Chinese, anti-Asian racism that is frightening.\n\nWhite people were convinced that the Chinese are taking away jobs.\n\nKAMIYA: There was definitely rioting, there were acts of violence.\n\nHearst and \"The Examiner\" fanned the flames of racial discontent really expertly.\n\nIt's visceral.\n\nIt appeals to people's fears, to their baser emotions.\n\nAnd he also, I'm sure, sincerely believed it.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: In a signed editorial, Hearst would write, \"I am strongly in favor of exclusion, \"to prevent these Orientals \"swarming the country and absolutely overwhelming it.\n\n\"We want our country not merely for the white race, \"but for our own standards of wages, standards of living.\n\n\"This is not race prejudice.\n\nIt is race preservation.\"\n\nThese sentiments would go on to become one of the mainstays of his entire journalistic career, deployed whenever it suited him, to galvanize his readers' fears.\n\nThe way Will Hearst saw it, more readers, meant more followers, meant more power.\n\n(seagulls squawking) NARRATOR: As Hearst's readership and influence grew, so too did his appetites.\n\nHe had commissioned the building of a boat, the \"Vamoose,\" designed to be the fastest steamship in the world, and every morning the young publisher could be seen racing across the bay to San Francisco, from his new home in the village of Sausalito.\n\n(birds chirping) TUCHER: He wanted above all to be noticed, to be important, to be on top.\n\nHe wanted people to pay attention.\n\nHe was hyper-competitive-- he wanted to be the richest one around as well as the most powerful one around.\n\nNASAW: Hearst wants to get all the attention.\n\nHe wears the loudest plaid suits with yellow ties.\n\nAnd he takes great joy in thumbing his nose at respectable society.\n\nKAMIYA: He could have lived where his parents had been living, the big tony San Francisco neighborhood Van Ness, but instead he moved to Sausalito.\n\nUp on the cliffs, it's a magnificent house that he bought overlooking the bay.\n\nIt's a little off-beat thing for this very hedonistic self... willful, self-willed man who kind of did what he wanted to do.\n\nHe was definitely a maverick in that way.\n\n(cork pops) NARRATOR: Hearst's sprawling bachelor pad had plenty of room for lavish parties full of firecrackers, games, and beautiful women.\n\nKASTNER: He wanted entertainment.\n\nHe wanted to be around people who were fun and who were talented.\n\nAnd he especially loved show girls, that was for sure.\n\nNARRATOR: Once, he'd seen the British actress Adelaide Neilson onstage, and even though she was 15 years his senior, he'd been completely smitten.\n\nThen there'd been Lillian Russell, at the time the highest-paid actress in the country.\n\nHe said his feelings for her had been so \"tense, dramatic, and ecstatic,\" that he'd wanted to propose.\n\nSoprano Sybil Sanderson he had proposed to-- but Phoebe had quickly intervened.\n\nAnd who could forget Eleanor Calhoun, yet another Will Hearst fiancée?\n\nTo Phoebe, the young actress was a gold-digger and a \"devil fish\" and was soon gotten rid of as well.\n\nWill now lived openly with a waitress from his Harvard days named Tessie Powers.\n\nThey were together for ten years and he took her everywhere.\n\nThey traveled together, they went to the opera together.\n\nHe was extremely proud to be with her and she loved him.\n\nNARRATION: But she had the same problem as all his other girlfriends.\n\nTessie definitely did not have the kind of social background that Will's mother, Phoebe, wanted her to have.\n\nPhoebe didn't think that it was inappropriate for her to break up his romances and she didn't think it was inappropriate for her to regulate his expenditures.\n\nNARRATOR: For Phoebe, it was all connected to preserving the family's wealth and reputation.\n\nShe wrote to George: \"You must convince Will to change his manner of living.\n\n\"How is it possible for him to devote his time and attention to a prostitute and utterly ignore his mother?\"\n\nNASAW:

wouldn't say he was particularly involved.\n\nHe let W.R., you know, run the presses and do kind of whatever he wanted.\n\nHe was more a parent from a distance.\n\nNARRATOR: Despite Phoebe's many attempts to rein in her son, Will was stubborn.\n\n\"You have often asked me what I could do with my money \"and that I must squander it on the girl.\n\nBut a fellow does like to live a little.\"\n\nWill had already spent the equivalent of $3.7 million of today's dollars on the \"Examiner--\" as well as almost a million more on himself.\n\nAnd he still wasn't satisfied.\n\nIn four years, he had topped the San Francisco market without much of a fight.\n\nNow, he was getting bored, and longed to test himself and his bold brand of journalism against much bigger foes.\n\nAll he needed was for his father to support this new venture.\n\nBut things were different this year.\n\nAs his son well knew, George was very ill.

bit.\n\nWhen George Hearst died, he left a will that the \"New York Times\" estimated at between $15 and $20 million dollars, and that is in 1891.\n\nNARRATOR: Today, George's fortune would be equivalent to half a billion dollars, and as the only son, Will was expected to inherit it all.\n\nBut the inheritance, when it was announced, held a nasty surprise for the young publisher.\n\nHis mother, Phoebe, had gotten everything.\n\nKASTNER: In the will, George said that Phoebe should be sure to provide for their son.\n\nBut Will was 28 at the time and certainly crushed that his father didn't make him a part of the inheritance in a more specific way.\n\nNARRATOR: Now a grieving widow, Phoebe Hearst-- long Will's closest confidant-- had just become something else entirely to her son.\n\n\"You have always been most kind and generous to me and given me extra money whenever I asked for it,\" he wrote, \"but don't you think it would be better for me \"if I didn't ask for it so often, if I were put now on a more independent and manly footing?\"\n\nKASTNER: It put him in this very awkward position.\n\nHe had to go to her, you know, palm extended, hat in hand, and ask for funds, which was a very difficult thing for him to do, and I think it was hard on their relationship as well.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Will had no property or income of his own.\n\nHe desperately wanted to move to New York and buy another paper, but he could only do so with a huge loan from his mother.\n\nHe knew that she'd never agree if he was still with Tessie.\n\nNICKLISS: Once she received control of the entire Hearst estate, she became one of the wealthiest women in the United States.\n\nAnd she grew into a very demanding, imperious individual.\n\nShe expected people to do what she

much wealth in it, there's so much happening in New York.\n\nKAMIYA: New York was the big tamale, the big enchilada.\n\nIt was the biggest population, it was where the big newspapers were.\n\nThere

impenetrable social upper crusts.\n\nYou're talking very old families who have acquired a lot of wealth and a lot of social privilege.\n\nOn the other hand, Hearst doesn't like to follow rules.\n\nHe's also a little bit of a disruptor.\n\nKAMIYA: Hearst liked that sense of flaunting propriety, but at the same time he always wanted to be at the top of the social heap.\n\nIt's classic Hearst.\n\nThere's this quality of, you know, \"I may be a wild man from the West, but I have a lot more money than you.\"\n\nNASAW: If he had put all his effort into it, he could have become a respected gentleman, but he doesn't want to, he's got better things to do.\n\nNARRATOR: The publishing industry had changed since Hearst had last been in New York in his student days.\n\nPapers were being churned out faster than ever before, a revolution fueled by the linotype printing press, a steam-powered monster so loud that many printers were now hired from among the city's deaf

peering into every corner of the market.\n\nNiche publications, like the \"Wall Street Journal,\" specialized in business news and catered to the street's brokers and financiers.\n\nThe erudite \"New

\"Woman's Era\" were created for, and by, the Black community.\n\nNo fewer than 20 papers appeared in languages other than English.\n\n\"The New York Times\" became known as the \"Gray Lady,\" because of its staid layout and establishment politics.\n\nIts circulation paled in comparison to the \"Sun,\" which had as many as 100,000 subscribers, and to the \"Herald,\" which drew 200,000 a day.\n\nBut at the top of the pack was the \"World,\" printing a quarter million copies weekday mornings and over 500,000 on Sundays.\n\nOwned and operated by Joseph Pulitzer, the \"World\" was the single most popular newspaper of the age, and Hearst wanted nothing more than to take it down.\n\nKAMIYA: So the dragon is Joseph Pulitzer.\n\nThis is who Hearst wants to beat if he is going to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the journalistic world.\n\nHe's got to knock out Joe Pulitzer.\n\nNARRATOR: Pulitzer-- at 48 years of age to Hearst's 32-- had everything the younger man wanted.\n\nHe had risen from nothing to become the 24th richest man in the country.\n\nHe'd employed the biggest news staff on the planet and shaped the opinions of millions.\n\nA Democrat, like

kind of the big shot.\n\nHe really changed the nature of journalism.\n\nHearst actually modeled his own newspaper out in San Francisco on what Pulitzer was doing.\n\nTUCHER: The \"New York World\" was so visible, it was such a presence in the city.\n\nIt was hard to avoid reading Pulitzer's paper.\n\nThis was a newspaper that was really focused on the needs and the interests of the enormous

money for newspapers.\n\nThere's the \"New York Times\" model, where you don't get the most readers, but you get upscale readers, and you have a genteel, respectable newspaper that appeals to them and you get advertising.\n\nAnd there's the Pulitzer model where you get the most readers that you possibly can, including, you know, like, poor, the immigrants, the working class.\n\nLike, trying to reach the masses.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: As Hearst saw it, the working people of New York City were the prize, and Pulitzer was standing in his way.\n\nAfter weeks of shopping around, Hearst finally settled on the vehicle for his plans-- a little two-cent paper called the \"Morning Journal.\"\n\nHe tapped the equivalent of $4.7 million dollars from Phoebe's estate for a paper with only 70,000 readers.\n\nThe \"Journal,\" when Hearst got hold of it, was not at all important.\n\nIt was not at all interesting-- nobody cared, nobody bought it.\n\nIt was a good thing to get if you wanted a cheap way to enter the New York market, but other than that, it was not gonna bring any loyal readers with him.\n\nEverybody thought, \"Well, you know, this young kid, \"he may have made it in San Francisco \"but he's certainly not going to succeed in New York and he's certainly not going to succeed by buying the 'Journal.'\"\n\nNARRATOR: A cartoonist working over at the \"World\" remembered that, \"Hearst was both pitied and jeered \"when it leaked out that he had bought the 'Journal.'\n\n\"He was ridiculed for his youth and assurance, and sneered at as a rich man's son.\"\n\nNASAW:

cat.\n\n(cat meows) The rivalry rippled across every section of their papers.\n\nHearst soon debuted the \"American Humorist,\" an enormous Sunday comic supplement as tall as a large toddler.\n\n♪ ♪ ERIK LOOMIS: In the late 19th century, comics are tremendously successful, enormously powerful.\n\nIt gives a 12-year-old a reason to buy the paper.\n\nTUCHER: Comics expressed things dramatically often because readers were perhaps recent immigrants, working class people, people for whom English was not a strong language.\n\nYOUNG: Over at \"The World,\" Pulitzer had an illustrator named Richard Outcault.\n\nAnd Outcault created a little character that was called \"The Yellow Kid\"-- a sickly little boy in like a yellow robe.\n\nThe Yellow Kid was a slum kid.\n\nWhy is he bald?\n\nBecause kids who have lice, they get their heads shaved-- especially, you know, poor kids.\n\nNARRATOR: Outcault explained that, \"The Yellow Kid was not an individual, but a type.\n\n\"When I used to go about the slums on newspaper assignments, \"I would encounter him often, wandering out of doorways \"or sitting down on dirty doorsteps.\n\n\"I always loved the Kid.\n\n\"He had a sweet character and a sunny disposition, and was generous to a fault.\"\n\n♪ ♪ YOUNG: Hearst, of course, steals Outcault away from Pulitzer.\n\nHowever, Pulitzer then just hires another illustrator to make a Yellow Kid.\n\nHEER: So there are two rival Yellow Kids.\n\nThere's a Pulitzer Yellow Kid and a Hearst Yellow Kid.\n\nPeople want papers that convey the reality of slum life, convey the reality of living in a tenement, of poverty, of hunger.\n\nThat bald kid really resonated with the public.\n\nAnd Hearst being Hearst, he found that was also very profitable.\n\nNARRATOR: Now that Hearst had the cartoonists, the writers, and all the editors he'd wanted, he set in motion his most devious plan yet.\n\nHe went ahead and dropped the price of the \"Journal\" from two cents to one.\n\nNewspapers that sold for a penny, Hearst claimed, were the \"true\" tribunes of the people.\n\nCHILES: He sells his newspaper for half the price of Pulitzer's newspaper, and Hearst can do that because he has a lot of money and he can afford to lose money for a while.\n\nNARRATOR: In just three months, the \"Journal's\" circulation more than doubled, jumping from 70,000 to 150,000.\n\nNo longer able to ignore the \"Journal's\" success, Pulitzer dropped his price as well.\n\nThe editorial in the paper announcing the price change was succinct: \"We prefer power to profits.\"\n\nPrivately, Pulitzer told his editors, \"We must smash the interloper.\"\n\nAt a penny apiece, both papers got the eyeballs they wanted, but now lost money on every copy.\n\nA great game of high-stakes chicken had

call for reform.\n\nThe end of the 19th century was a heartless, monopolistic, capitalistic gilded age.\n\nHEER: You had the first billionaires and the first giant corporations that owned everything.\n\nThey had vast monopoly power.\n\nNARRATOR: These corrupt, sprawling monopolies were known as \"the trusts,\" and everyday necessities like coal, sugar, and coffee, all fell under their purview.\n\nCharles \"the Ice King\" Morse, for example, controlled all 285 million tons of ice the city used every year-- ice for homes, restaurants, and even morgues.\n\nThere were few incentives to set fair prices, or to treat workers well.\n\nNASAW: When Hearst gets to New York, I think he's outraged at the corruption.\n\nThe working people of New York, largely immigrants, are being ripped off right and left.\n\nThat corruption is rampant, that the Democratic Party, while pretending to represent the immigrant working class, is making it more expensive for them to get clean water, to get sewers, to get gas, public schools, milk, and everything else.\n\nAnd he knows that this is a way to win circulation and to, you know, gain power for himself.\n\nNARRATOR: Back in San Francisco,

what he'd learned in San Francisco, and mobilized his staff at the \"Journal\" to wage war against all New York City trusts.\n\nLOOMIS: The \"Journal\" was able to channel stories about the struggles of workers in ways that gains them political sympathy and that promotes the idea that maybe the state should fix some of these problems.\n\nAnd that is critical, right?\n\nThat for the first time, a major paper is saying, \"The state needs to fix some problems.\"\n\n(whistling) NARRATOR: When the Gas Trust wanted to tear up vast reaches of the city's streets to lay unnecessary new gas mains, Hearst had his best lawyers argue against it, taking their case all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThen, when the American Ice Company more than doubled its prices-- putting ice out of reach for most New Yorkers-- the \"Journal\" took down the Ice King, smashed the trust, and in the process exposed a sprawling corruption scheme that ended the mayor's political career.\n\nHearst's readers

his ownership of the \"Journal,\" Hearst's rivalry with Pulitzer was pushing past all usual boundaries of decorum.\n\nThe \"Journal's\" circulation climbed so steadily that Pulitzer became convinced that Hearst must have a spy in his newsroom, and even put in place a system of code names to confuse the competition.\n\nHearst, meanwhile, seemed equally willing to publish tasteless exposés on his front page, to print titillating drawings in his theater reviews, and to degrade and dehumanize in his comics.\n\nAnything to sell his paper.\n\nKAMIYA: There's no question that Hearst was an expert at appealing to fear, and to lust, to voyeurism, to sensationalism.\n\nAnd probably the most obvious aspect of this is crime.\n\nHe was a master at creating heroes and villains, so that whoever the murderer is, is a demonic, satanic figure, threatening everything that we hold dear, and the victim is like the damsel on the white horse.\n\nHe increased the ratio of crime stories to an extraordinary degree-- 20% or 30% of the stories were crime stories.\n\nAnd he was pretty shameless about it.\n\n(woman shrieking, crowd clamoring) NARRATOR: In the summer of 1897, when a headless

well-aware that this was the biggest story of his career, and he intended to push it as far as he could.\n\n\"The Spaniards were not men but beasts,\" he claimed, and proceeded to spread outright lies about their troops savaging women, poisoning children, and feeding prisoners of war to sharks.\n\nPulitzer had recently jumped on the bandwagon as well, and the \"World\" was soon trafficking in reporting almost as sensational as Hearst's.\n\nNow, both Hearst and Pulitzer were demanding that the president declare war at once.\n\nWilliam McKinley, a moderate Republican who'd won the White House on a business-friendly ticket two years earlier, remained cautious.\n\n\"War should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed,\" the president maintained.\n\nBut with every

more than what newspapers had been doing over the last hundred years to promote a whole different way of thinking about the world.\n\nAnd one that promotes Hearst himself as, potentially, the person who can have the solution to these problems that's facing America.\n\nOn the one hand, he's already been in politics for a long time as a publisher, and as a particularly partisan publisher at that.\n\nHe has a clear set of beliefs that he has articulated.\n\nHe has an agenda that's clearly resonating with a large segment of society.\n\nAnd he has something else, which is a clear lust for

landslide.\n\nNo sooner was Hearst the representative for the 11th district of New York than he was running again-- this time for the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nHe campaigned energetically across the country, chartering a special train, and using the Hearst papers to boost his chances everywhere he went.\n\nKAMIYA: Hearst as a political candidate realized that if you want to pick up votes, delegates, influence in the Midwest, you have to have a Chicago newspaper.\n\nNARRATOR: He bought two: the \"Chicago American\" in 1900 and then the \"Chicago Examiner\" two years later.\n\nBut even his expanding stable couldn't secure the nomination.\n\nNow, he'd split with the Democratic Party and was running for mayor on his own third-party ticket, at the head of the Municipal Ownership League.\n\nTo make himself presentable to voters, Hearst had had to remake himself.\n\nHe retired his loud plaid suits, and now routinely sported a sedate new uniform-- a black hat and a long black coat-- that made him look more like an undertaker than the bad boy of U.S. journalism.\n\nEverywhere the candidate went, Millicent was by his side.\n\nBut the young woman was no mere

Phoebe reluctantly admitted, and there certainly was no denying that her son seemed especially pleased with himself.\n\nNASAW: Everybody thinks that Hearst marries Millicent because he needs to be more respectable, and it's true.\n\nHe decides that Millicent can be perfectly respectable-looking and any wife is better than no wife.\n\nNARRATOR: Ring on his finger and somber wardrobe notwithstanding, Hearst the candidate in fact remained the same man as ever.\n\nInstead of moving his new wife into a townhouse on Fifth Avenue, he chose a brand-new apartment building called the Clarendon on the Upper West Side-- a location that just two decades earlier had been grazing land for the city's livestock, and remained about as far as could be from the usual haunts of the old New York elite.\n\nBut the Hearsts were no less comfortable here, and now occupied the penthouse-- a 7,000-square-foot affair, over three floors, with sweeping views of the Hudson River and the entire city.\n\nFrom this high perch, Hearst launched his run for mayor.\n\nHis campaign took up the same causes that had made the \"Journal\" the leading paper in the city.\n\n♪ ♪ KAMIYA: He was arguing for income taxes on the rich, an eight-hour working day, the destruction of trusts.\n\nAll of these positions were fairly radical at the time.\n\nNASAW: He was a good progressive.\n\nHe wanted the city to own the streetcars, to own the gasworks, to own the sewers, to own the waterworks, so that there would be less corruption, less graft.\n\nThat, of course, would take all the money away from Tammany Hall.\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Tammany was the most notorious Democratic political organization in New York.\n\nKnown simply as \"the Machine,\" for decades it controlled the city's politics through a powerful mix of corruption, intimidation, and outright violence.\n\nThey ran everything-- businesses both legal and illegal, construction, sanitation, firefighting, and, of course, state and local elections.\n\nThe Machine relied on thugs, like the members of the notorious Eastman Gang, to keep people in line.\n\nAs a party boss once said, \"The way to have power is to take it.\"\n\nThe key to the machine's success, the key to their domination of the city for many decades, was the desperation of the immigrants and working-class voters.\n\nTammany Hall has young men who are aspiring to move up in New York City life and they know the problems of everyone in their building, everyone on their block.\n\nAnd they report back to the ward boss, and they say, \"This family can't make ends meet because Dad got injured on the job.\"\n\nWell, Tammany shows up, and they give them a turkey.\n\nThe widow upstairs, they make sure she has a bucket of coal, she's not going to go cold this

tirelessly to show that their candidate was in nobody's pocket, and wasn't afraid of anybody.\n\nAs election day neared, even rival papers could not ignore the enthusiasm that Hearst was finding among the people.\n\n\"William Randolph Hearst drove through the Lower East Side last night in a procession of triumph,\" the \"World\" reported, \"the like of which has not been seen in New York in many years.\"\n\nAfter hosting one more elaborate rally at Madison Square Garden, all Hearst could do now was wait.\n\nAs he cast his vote on East 29th Street, there were rumors of violence in locations across the city, but he remained undaunted, predicting a landslide.\n\n\"I am confident,\" he said in a statement that verged on a victory speech, \"and I shall always feel deeply grateful \"for the great kindness that has been shown me by my fellow citizens in this campaign.\"\n\n♪ ♪ NASAW: How could he lose?\n\nBecause Tammany knows they're in trouble, and from the very beginning, they send their tough guys into the voting precincts where Hearst is gonna win.\n\nIt is an outrage of gargantuan proportions.\n\nNARRATOR: Just as they'd done so many times before, Tammany resorted to every underhanded trick in their extensive repertoire.\n\nThey had attacked Hearst's polls watchers.\n\nOne man had a finger chewed off, and his face slashed.\n\nTammany then flooded the race with fraudulent votes, tipping the election in favor of their own candidate, George McClellan, Jr., who would go on to serve for another four terms.\n\n\"We have won the election,\" a furious Hearst told the \"Times.\"\n\n\"Illegal voting and dishonest count have not been able to overcome a great popular majority.\"\n\nHe demanded an investigation.\n\nBut it would be to no avail.\n\nThere would be no recount.\n\nAs Tammany celebrated its latest victory, ballot boxes filled with the votes that would have put Hearst in the mayor's office drifted slowly down the East River, and on out of sight.\n\nNASAW: Hearst never expects to lose anything.\n\nAnd when he does lose, he's shattered, but not for long.\n\n(chuckles) Because his confidence in himself is such-- and his confidence that he knows America and he knows the voters, and he knows the newspaper readers, is such that he bounces back.\n\nAnd, eventually, he will vanquish his enemies, he will defeat his opponents, and the people of America will understand that this is the man they need because he's for them.\n\nNARRATOR: By the spring of 1906, Hearst was hailed as the foremost figure in American journalism.\n\nThe fact that he should have been sitting in the mayor's office in no way blunted his political ambition.\n\nHe confided to his editor and friend Arthur Brisbane that the loss was a \"tragedy for the people,\" but added, \"Our next effort will be the most important thus far.\"\n\n\"We will,\" he informed Brisbane, \"run for governor as planned.\"\n\nWhatever it was that pushed him on was incredibly deep.\n\nThe fact that he was so irrepressible, there's something you have to at least like, you know, respect about the guy's sheer strength.\n\nHe has this kind of Teflon ambition.\n\nHe thinks that he can do no wrong and at one point, it's just going to click, and at one point he's going to be able to get the power that he needs, the power that he wants.\n\nNARRATOR: Now, however, his critics and political enemies had found a new strategy, taking a page right out of Hearst's own playbook.\n\nNo sooner had he begun his gubernatorial campaign, than they launched a series of vitriolic attacks against him.\n\nAnd one story in particular seemed to follow the candidate everywhere he went.\n\nIn 1900, Hearst had printed his usual brand of attacks against then President William McKinley.\n\nHe had published a doggerel verse, a really stupid poem, that seemed to suggest that McKinley-- who his opponents used to say had the backbone of an éclair-- that the world would be better off if he were assassinated.\n\nNARRATOR: Then, in 1901, he'd run an editorial arguing that, \"If bad institutions and bad men can be got rid of only by killing, then killing must be done.\"\n\nThat had been the year of the World's Fair in Buffalo, New York.\n\n(crowd applauds) On September 6, McKinley himself had visited.\n\nWhile the president stood greeting members of the public, a young man approached.\n\nHe shot the president twice at point blank range.\n\n(gun firing twice, crowd clamoring) When McKinley died from his wounds, Hearst's many rivals were more than happy to blame the publisher, even though the assassin, Leon Czolgosz, was an anarchist from Michigan who'd never seen a Hearst paper.\n\nHearst certainly was merciless in his attacks on McKinley and used all the tricks in his trade, but that was standard journalistic warfare.\n\nThere wasn't anything that any objective person could look at and say, \"Oh, William Randolph Hearst \"is responsible for the assassination of William McKinley.\"\n\n♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Now, in October 1906, when Hearst pulled ahead of Republican candidate Charles Evans Hughes and took one step closer to the governor's mansion in Albany, even
