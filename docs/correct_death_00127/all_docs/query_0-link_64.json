Anderson, began her journey of life on December 1, 1930 in Locust Grove, MD. She received her education through the public school system in New Castle County DE. She worked as an aide for Stubbs Elementary School and also worked at the City County building. Beatrice enjoyed music, watching TD Jakes and her favorite football team, the Pittsburg Steelers. She faithfully read the newspaper to keep abreast of all current affairs and was an excellent cook. We will definitely miss her white potato pie, cod fish and pancakes. She was one of the neighborhood moms and will be missed by those that knew her as Miss Bea. Beatrice loved her Family dearly. She leaves to cherish her memory her children: Henry (Poncho) Anderson, Gerald Anderson(Bridget), Pamela Anderson and Tye Anderson(Evenlyn) (preceded in death) Brenda, Andre, Larry, Marsha, Leslie and Valerie Anderson. Also, left to cherish her memory is her dear sister Anna Washington of Dover DE, her many grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. The scripture Beatrice cherished most was Psalm 23: The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want. He restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Amen\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nEthel B Brown - February 15, 1955 - July 19, 2023\n\nDeparted: 07/19/2023 (Wilmington)\n\nObituary Preview: Ethel Bernice Brown, daughter of Ethel Lean Wayne & Clarence Edward Austin, was born February 15, 1955 in Charlottesville, VA.

When home, she spent her time tending to her roses, shopping, and her most favorite past time of all -- spoiling her five grandchildren. At an early age, she gave her life to the Lord and became a lifelong member of Warminster Baptist Church in Buckingham, VA. However, during her illness, she would often be found on Sunday mornings attending multiple church services virtually. She was preceded in death by her parents, Clarence and Ethel Austin, her older brother, “Butch”, and her younger sister, Linda. She leaves to cherish her memory: her loving husband, Ronald; her children, Lisa Phillips (Andrew) and Ronnie Brown (Ashley); her grandchildren, Nathan, Olivia, Joy, Trinity and Sydney; her sister, Delphine Najeeullah (Ronald); and her nephew, Anthony Austin; along with many friends and family. A Tribute by her Husband You Walked This Journey by Ronald Brown You walked this journey with me through wind, through rain On cloudy days you made the sun In the Sun you were the shade Sometimes the hills too steep Sometimes the valley way too low Yet you walked with me On long dusty roads Through the mud after the storm we rest by road cooled under rustling leaves on lonely trees You made Sweet wine from life's bitter fruit Thank you for walking this journey with me\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nCeles Lynch - October 14, 1945 - July 02, 2023\n\nDeparted: 07/02/2023 (Wilmington)\n\nObituary Preview: Celes Lynch Celes Lynch, 77, was born in St. Ann Parish in Jamaica on October 14, 1945 to William David and Beatrice Johnson. She earned her Heavenly Wings on July 2, 2023, after watching Pastor Stanley Hearst, II preach about justice and hope, two characteristics that epitomize her life. She is the 3rd eldest of seven children who were taught to love, respect and care for one another. She was born with a “Green Thumb,” for she could bring any plant back to life. This would serve as a metaphor for her God-ordained mission and purpose. Upon moving to the United States from Jamaica, she lived in Pennsylvania for a short period of time, before making Delaware her home. In Wilmington, Delaware, Celes would find joy in caring for others at Governor Bacon, where she worked for the State of Delaware for 30 years. In 1971, she married Herman Lynch and from this union they birthed a son, Patrick L. Lynch. She attended Haven United Methodist Church and sang on the Gospel Choir. One could see her in the front singing with the Sopranos belting out “Hallelujah, Salvation and Glory,” with her son Patrick and the man with whom she would share her life until his untimely demise, Clarence W. Dorsey, Jr. “Uncle Bubby.” Celes was a Mother, Grandmother, Sister, Auntie, Friend and Caregiver. Celes loved traveling to England to see family or cruising the Atlantic Ocean. She enjoyed living everyday to the fullest. She, Alice, Gwen, Mae and her dear friend, June Pettie, would travel the world together and bring back such uplifting pictures of their journeys. Celes loved gardening and in 2004 she won the Wilmington City Garden Contest. Her home on West 2nd Street was recognizable because the front was filled with beautiful flowers, uniquely placed to bring tranquility to anyone who came near her property. As well, her backyard was the best-looking garden in the city and she was proud of that. Celes was actively engaged in the West Side community. She faithfully attended the 7th District Civic Association and 7th District Neighborhood Planning Council meetings making great contributions to the city she loved. She instilled these values in her family too. She also worked at the Rosehill Plantery in New Castle. Visiting her there, would bring immediate joy to anyone present. Moreover, throughout her life, she rendered care to Ms. Hilda Mowatt, Ms. Ella James, Ms. Constance Johnson and Bubby. She enjoyed being a Grandmother. She would assist with getting Patrick, Jr, Megan and Morgan from school and she helped with their care, when they were small. She was the Grandmother who never charged for her services. One of the most precious moments to witness was Celes reading and coloring with her Grandchildren. For her last birthday, each grandchild wrote special messages to her about how much she means to them. Also, a scripture she quoted often is “ My God will supply your every need according to His riches and glory.” She was correct, for in her time of need, she could rely upon her Son, Patrick and her Niece, Rep Sherry Dorsey Walker, to provide care for her. She often shared how grateful she was to have them in her life. They expressed the same sentiment regarding her. Additionally, she enjoyed her lunches, conversations and cups of tea with her sister, Betty J. Dorsey. They would “get the basement together” and take breaks, while also planting flowers in the backyard. One of the most entertaining moments with them involved watching “Family Feud,” sharing their thoughts about the answers, while rejoicing for the winners. Celes had an infectious smile and a hearty laugh that could transform a room. Her mission was to leave a place better than she found it. This is exactly what she did with her life. Celes’ spirit will forever dwell in her family. Having her in the world made a difference in the lives of others. She leaves to cherish her memory, Son/Caregiver, Patrick, Grandchildren, Patrick, Jr. Megan and Morgan, Siblings Alice Johnson, Gwen Johnson, Abraham “Stanley” Johnson, Jephart “Jeff” Johnson, James Johnson, Laurel “Mae” Johnson and Betty J. Dorsey, her Niece/Caregiver Rep Sherry Dorsey Walker and a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, family and friends. Loving Submitted by the Family\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nPatricia A.

Florence received her early education in Pittsburgh public schools and graduated from Schenley High School. After graduating from high school, she attended Clarion State Teachers College (now University), in Clarion, PA, where she was the first African American female to live on the campus. While at Clarion, Florence was active in the House Council, Women’s Athletic Association and the Student Christian Association and received a Bachelor of Science in Library Science with a minor in English in 1955. In 2021, Florence returned to Clarion University, and served as the grand-marshal of the homecoming parade, honored for her impact on Clarion’s history. Florence knew that she did not want to stay in Clarion upon graduating and through Bryant Teachers Agency, found employment with Wilmington Public Schools as librarian at Howard High School, replacing the retiring Pauline A. Young. In Pittsburgh, Mrs. Gaines always attended integrated schools. Therefore, it was quite an eye opener for her to be on the staff of an all-African American school. It was an experience that she would never forget. The student body was bright, intelligent, and friendly. The staff was supportive and willing to help everyone in any way possible. Very early she became active at Howard, serving on various committees, Class sponsor, coaching girls’ basketball, sponsor of Library Club and year-book sponsor. Florence worked at Howard High School until the end of the 1975 school year, at that time, Florence weeded-out, sorted and packed all the books in the library for the move to the New Howard Career Center which opened in 1976.

He departed this life on September 19, 2022 in Salem, New Jersey. “Candy Man” as he was affectionately known, lived in the Cedar Heights area of Wilmington throughout his life. He attended Absalom Jones in his early years and graduated from Brown Vocational School. He was a community staple; every one knew The Candy Man! He had a dynamic personality that showed up waaaay before you’d see him. He was the OG “there goes that man”! His early morning walks were a daily routine; he’d often stop by a neighbor’s house, sit on the porch and shoot the breeze. One of his prized accomplishments was his yard and the cul de sac, affectionately known as “the circle”. He and his wife, Martha made every effort to keep up the beautification by planting trees and flowers and even building a wooden fence! Strangers would ride by and compliment them on its beauty. Candy loved hosting cookouts in his back yard; you could hear the R&B soul boogying out of 333 Clyde Street! If you found yourself wandering down by “the circle”, you’d have an invite to the festivities. A real showman, he would grill and dance at the same time and he made sure your belly was full. He loved football, basketball, horse racing- all sports! In true sports fanatic fashion; he was closely involved in Man and Cheryl’s games throughout their schooling. Oftentimes, he was THE go-to videographer for the various high school teams; he wouldn’t miss a thing. He was so present, we all thought he may suit up, dash out on the field and run plays! Candy Man had various gifts and talents; he was a mentor, motivator, professional horse enthusiast, barber, coach, small business owner and life-long entrepreneur. Candy was a Master barber and his skills were passed down through three generations of his family; from his son, Man, who taught Alvin Wiggins, Jr., who taught Teddy Patton. What a legacy! He loved his family and showed his love by visiting, cooking, and bringing his lively energy into the room. He had a never-ending positive psychology and imparted his “can-do”philosophy on the younger generation. Being present was important to him. Candy did it his way. There will never be another who did it like him. He was preceded in death by his wife, Martha B. Edwards. Candy Man is survived by his daughter, Cheryl Graham, son-in-love Kirk Graham, his son Ty Livingston, grandson Tyrell Livingston, sister, Apostle Marian Rudd, brother Alvin Wiggins, and a host of nephews, nieces, cousins, and friends.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nMarion Spencer - January 22, 1963 - September 19, 2022\n\nDeparted: 09/19/2022 (Wilmington)\n\nObituary Preview: Marion F.

Chaka was a loving son, husband, father, brother, uncle, and friend. His mom called him a “man among men” and always told him that he was the “epitome” of a son. Many can testify to his love and character and all that he has meant to them. Chaka’s parents moved to the sister island of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands when Chaka was one year old. During his early childhood years in St. Croix, Chaka attended Good Hope Elementary School and St. Patrick Middle School. Upon promotion, he attended St. Joseph High School where he graduated in 1989. During his elementary and high school years, Chaka was a star athlete. He played Little League baseball for the St. Patrick Shamrocks and softball with his father for the Make Softball Fun (MSF) Softball League, hitting the run that brought his father home to win one of the games in St. Thomas. In high school, Chaka also played for the St. Joseph Saints Basketball team. He won the championship game for his team when he sank the three-point shot from half-court at the buzzer. To this day, his high school coaches and teammates still talk about that game! In 1989, Chaka left his Caribbean home to attend college at the University of Delaware. His sister Kisha was inconsolable because her friend and “lymin buddy” was leaving her. The resulting scene was quite dramatic. Chaka majored in accounting and earned his Bachelor of Science in Accounting degree in 1993. Chaka was always interested in computers and Information Technology and worked in the computer lab at UD for many of his college years. He began his career in Information Technology in 1993 and spent the last 7 years as Vice President/IT Project Manager at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Even through his illness, Chaka continued to excel as he recently studied for and gained his certification in AWS. In the Fall of 1990, Chaka became a member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. Through this organization, Chaka built lifelong friendships and embodied the values of brotherhood, scholarship, and service. Chaka served as chapter President for two terms in 2011 and 2012. He was also instrumental in launching his chapter’s annual scholarship golf tournament and in establishing his chapter’s Sigma Beta mentorship program. Chaka was presented with the Leadership Award in 2013 in recognition of his years of service in this capacity. Chaka met his wife-to-be, Devon Hargis, on the campus of the University of Delaware in 1991. As they were both accounting majors, they shared many of the same classes and spent countless hours together studying and preparing for exams. What initially started as a friendship grew over the years, and on July 31, 1999, the two were married. God hand-picked them for each other and their bond and union is evident until this day. Out of this beautiful union came two amazing children: Jordan Rashaad and Mekhi Alexander born in 2000 and 2003, respectively. Chaka cherished his roles as both husband and father. He was an active and hands-on father. Weekends, when the kids were young, were spent at the local zoo, aquarium, hiking trail, park, or fishing pond. Once the kids began playing sports, Chaka was there for every practice and every game, eventually taking on the role of Team Dad for multiple years. He was also an exceptional uncle-father to his niece, Sanaà, whom he referred to as “Niecy Pooh” and shared a special bond. Chaka was a life-long learner and was constantly exploring various interests and hobbies. From drone-flying, baking, and video gaming to deejaying, golfing, photography and grilling, he was constantly active and excited about a new pursuit. As a friend or family member of Chaka’s, you always knew what he was currently excited about. If he had just bought a new drone, he was going to call you, bring his drone over, and encourage you to get one too. Chaka was also a die-hard Eagles fan and celebrated their Super Bowl win at the parade in Philadelphia. He made sure his children knew the Eagles' fight song and had them singing it, with enthusiasm, as toddlers. Chaka will be dearly missed by all who had the opportunity to know him. He was preceded in death by: Maternal Grandmother: Evelyn Petersen- Knowles (deceased) and Maternal Grandfather: Lois Jackson (deceased) Paternal Grandmother: Hyacinth Williams(deceased) and Paternal Grandfather: George Alexander Williams(deceased) Uncles: Glenn Williams (deceased), Jerome Jackson (deceased). He leaves to cherish his memory: Wife: Devon Williams Children: Jordan Williams and Mekhi Williams Mother: Cecelia Ernestine Knowles Father: Gerald Alexander Williams Mother-in-Law: Carolyn Hargis Father-in-Law: Wayne Adams Sisters: Kisha A Williams, Jayme Colbert-Williams, Jesse Colbert-Williams Niece: Sanaà A Burke Aunts: Geraldine Benjamin, Eleanor Berg, Maureen Williams Uncles: Antonio Petersen, Octave Williams, Oscar Williams, Leo Petersen Special Cousins: Debora, Dale and Michael Benjamin, Kyra Travis, Basil Rodriguez, Franklin McFarlande, Khadijah and Khalid Matthew, Senator Kenneth Gittens Special Friends: Dave Griffith, Sheldon Rennie, Mark Hamilton Godparents: Mabel Melchoir, Adel Petersen, David Davis, Vernon Richards The Petersen, Jackson, and Hargis families and other close family members and life-long friends too numerous to mention.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\n1234\n\nFuneral Services Offered by Congo Funeral Home\n\nCongo Funeral Home offers a wide range of funeral services designed to meet the unique needs of each family.
