        "text": "(1863–1951). Through dishonest and exaggerated reporting, William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers whipped up public sentiment against Spain, actually helping to cause the Spanish-American War. Hearst was quite willing to take credit for this, as his New York City newspaper testified in an 1898 headline: “How Do You Like the Journal’s War?” His controversial life became the subject of the motion picture Citizen Kane (1941).\n\nHearst was born in San Francisco on April 29, 1863. His father, George Hearst, was a gold-mine owner as well as United States senator (1886–91). Hearst attended Harvard University for two years before taking control of the failing San Francisco Examiner in 1887. His father had bought the paper in 1880. He turned the newspaper into a paying venture before entering the New York City market to compete with publisher Joseph Pulitzer.\n\nHearst bought the New York Morning Journal in 1895. The paper soon attained an unprecedented circulation through its one-cent price, use of illustrations, color magazine sections, comic strips, and its glaring and sensational headlines. The term yellow journalism was coined to define the type of sensationalism and, often, irresponsibility exhibited by Hearst and Pulitzer. In 1896 Hearst introduced the New York Evening Journal. In 1897–98 he relentlessly promoted the need to fight a war with Spain over Cuba.\n\nHis publishing empire grew as he acquired the Chicago American, the Chicago Examiner, and the Boston American. By 1925 he owned newspapers in every section of the United States. He also bought a number of magazines, including Cosmopolitan, the World Today, and Harper’s Bazaar. He published books, chiefly fiction, and produced a number of motion pictures. The films were primarily vehicles for Marion Davies, his mistress for more than 30 years. He built himself a grandiose castle, named San Simeon, in California.\n\nHearst’s political ambitions won him two terms in the United States House of Representatives (1903–07), and he was nearly elected mayor of New York City in 1905. During the Great Depression of the 1930s his publishing empire began to disintegrate, and many publications were sold. World War II restored his fortunes, however, and the newspapers and magazines prospered again. Hearst died in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Aug. 14, 1951. His son Randolph A. Hearst succeeded him in business."
