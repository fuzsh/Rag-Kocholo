Continuing an aggressive expansion in a tough market, Bank of America Securities has stolen software investment banking chief Paul Phillips from Goldman Sachs, The Post has learned.

Phillips, who had been with Goldman Sachs for about 10 years, will head Bank of America’s technology banking group. He has handed in his resignation at Goldman and will start in about three months at Bank of America.

Spokeswomen from Bank of America and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

During Phillips’ tenure at Goldman, the bank was among the top four in global software merger and acquisition deals, landing the coveted top spot in 1998 and 2002.

Goldman advised AOL on its almost $10 billion acquisition of Netscape in 1999 and Lucent on its $24 billion acquisition of Ascend Communications the same year.

Bank of America has been on a hiring spree, upgrading its talent in banking and research to take advantage of its leading position in lending. It is the third-largest bank by assets and has made clear it intends to translate its position lending to blue-chip clients into more lucrative banking by hiring top-tier talent from the Street.

Its share of investment banking fees has soared from 12th place with 1.5 percent of investment banking fees in 1999 to eighth place with 5 percent in 2002, according to Thomson Financial.

This year the bank plans to hire 50 investment bankers. Recently the Charlotte, N.C.-based banking behemoth has hired bankers from Morgan Stanley, Salomon Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston.

In early April, Simon Western, a six-year Goldman veteran, joined Bank of America’s FIG group in asset management. Other additions include Jim McVeigh, a managing director from CSFB who covers cable, and Dirk Stuurop, Merrill Lynch’s former financial institutions practice chair from 1998 to 1999 who joined as a senior executive director in May.
