        "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm looking at the possibilities current technology can bring to soaring instruments. By soaring instrument, I mean one single piece of hardware that will meet all the needs of the soaring pilot (sailplane, hang glider, paraglider), with the possible exception of RF communication. That includes, normal flying, competition, logging and display. Ideally, I'd like to see just how much can be put in one box, and learn how much of it belongs there. The box should be as small as possible, but not so small that the user interface (display + buttons) becomes a hassle to use. The unit will be designed with full FAA and FAI certification as a goal.\n\nBeing a paraglider pilot myself, I'm not familiar with the specific needs of the sailplane community (though I have surveyed the sailplane instrument market). I need your input in any and all areas you feel are important. What features do your current instruments lack? What instruments have the best implementations of features you like?\n\nTo lay some groundwork, here's my current list of instrument \"components\". Any specifications or additions you can provide for anything in any area would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPHYSICAL SENSORS: (Pardon the English units here - Metric is also mandatory!)\n\nSensor Use Comments\n\n--------------------- ----------- ------------------------------\n\nAbsolute Pressure Altitude -300 to 27,000 feet\n\nDifferential Pressure Airspeed 0 to 200 mph (pitot tube)\n\nTemperature Air Temp -50 to +150 degF (Mounted in pitot tube?)\n\nHumidity Humidity 0 to 100% RH (Mounted in pitot tube?)\n\nMagnetic Heading Possibly 3-D, with declination correction\n\nGPS Heading Internal GPS planned\n\nLocation DGPS?\n\nAltitude Less accurate than pressure altitude\n\nGround Speed\n\nAttitude Via multi-antenna GPS (hard, but sexy)\n\nAccelerometer Attitude Roll, pitch, yaw, artificial horizon,\n\ntotal energy (gyro not needed?)\n\nAcceleration\n\nBASIC CALCULATED VALUES:\n\nValue Comments\n\n---------- ----------------------------\n\nAltitude Primarily from absolute pressure sensor, with input from GPS (for\n\ngross error detection), temperature and humidity sensors (for\n\ndeviation from standard atmospheric model). Offset calibration\n\n(at launch) via manual setting and/or recall of known position\n\n(stored waypoint or launch site description). The sensor will be\n\nselected for exceptional linearity.\n\nAirspeed Primarily from differential pressure sensor, no user calibration\n\nneeded if pitot tube is intact and properly mounted.\n\nAir temp Used mainly to correct for deviations from the standard atmosphere\n\nmodel (along with humidity).\n\nHeading Primarily from GPS, verified from compass. If GPS is available,\n\ndeclination correction for compass will be derived from\n\nappropriate global magnetic model. This is mainly for pilots who\n\nprefer to fly inverted (and thus loose GPS lock).\n\nGround speed Primarily from GPS, though 3-D magnetic sensor may also be useful,\n\nif sensitive enough.\n\nLocation Primarily from GPS, though dead reckoning with magnetic sensor and\n\nairspeed (with manual wind vector input) may be possible.\n\nAttitude Accelerometer + 3-d magnetic sensor (theoretically). If dual GPS\n\nis used, then it will be the most accurate reference.\n\nClimb Rate First derivative of altitude, with accelerometer and airspeed\n\ninput for TE corrections.\n\nGlide Ratio The user may set the amount of averaging, and the instrument will\n\nbe able to reset the calculation whenever the pilot is no longer\n\non a steady glide.\n\nSOFTWARE FEATURES:\n\nPolar Acquisition\n\n-----------------\n\nWhile manual data entry will be available, constructing a polar from flight data will also be supported. For sailplanes, a feature to help find the optimal flap setting for each speed can be added, even if that feature is little more than keeping track of which settings have already been tried. A flap position sensor is being considered, but I have no idea how it would be implemented.\n\nStall Alarm\n\n-----------\n\nThis is mainly from the polar data and airspeed, with help from the accelerometer. Similarly, a VNE or G alarm could be added. More?\n\nNavigation\n\n----------\n\nStandard waypoints will be used, and distance from current position to any waypoint will be calculated as separate vertical and horizontal (great circle) distances. An internal map display is not planned, though output to a PC will be supported.\n\nSpeed To Fly (S2F)\n\n------------------\n\nWith a good polar, and good navigation and aerometry data, this is easy to calculate.\n\nBarograph and Flight Log\n\n------------------------\n\nTons of storage, with selectable sampling rate. Sealed and FAI certified.\n\nUSER INTERFACE:\n\nHere's where I'm having the most trouble, and need the most input. With so many items to display, it is clear they can't all be on one screen, no matter how large that screen is. Whenever possible, the instrument must be smart enough to switch displays so a busy pilot doesn't have to do it manually. Initially, a high-resolution high-contrast 3\"x4\" monochrome LCD display is being considered, though it is expected color will eventually be an option.\n\nThe instrument should use audible indicators to the greatest extent possible, so the pilot won't have to look at the instrument for routine information. The sound style and volume will be adjustable, as will the list of things to have audible clues associated with them. For rare events (battery low) and important alarms (stall), a voice annunciator is being considered. This would also be useful for calling out values the pilot is interested in, such as glide ratio or airspeed, during times the pilot is too busy to glance at the instrument. Also, voice feedback of button presses will allow the pilot to operate the instrument without looking at it. And any or all of the sound and voice features can be turned off.\n\nThe primary mode for configuring the instrument will be via a companion program for a PC. This will also allow all settings to be saved off the instrument, which will be useful if the instrument is damaged. However, all settings that can be done via the PC can also be done from the instrument front panel. While a small number of pushbuttons (6 or less) will be included for use during flight, the configuration interface will be by a touch screen and menus.\n\nUsing an Operating System for a PDA, such as PalmOS or WinCE, has been considered. But it is doubtful this will be done for the simple reason that it vastly complicates the development process (which demands true real-time performance and FAA certification).\n\nNow, how many screens do you think are needed, and what should be displayed on each screen? At least two items demand graphical representation: Rate of Climb and Attitude (artificial horizon). A simple navigation display of waypoints and past track (with live update) would be useful, possibly in 3-D. There are numerous numeric values, and countless status and mode values that can also be displayed. But which are most important to sailplane pilots?\n\nThanks for reading this far. Let the feedback begin!\n\n- Bob Cunningham\n\nBrad Cantrell wrote:\n\n> I strongly support michaels idea for a HUD(heads up\n\n> display).In jet fighters all the basic flight instruments\n\n> are read out on the HUD keeping there attention on outside\n\n> visual.In a sailplanes this is much more nessesary to keep\n\n> our orientation with all the turning we do and the general\n\n> sensativity of our flight handling characteristics.\n\nFirst, I'm looking for things to go WITHIN the instrument! I'd really like to try to minimize the number of external components and connections, but also provide for a third-party peripheral market. I also don't want to force a pilot to have to trash his cockpit to install this instrument. The only external accessory I'm envisioning is the pitot probe (with embedded temp and humidity sensors).\n\nSecond, are you ever looking straight ahead (where the HUD would be) when you are banked in a turn? Somehow, I think you are looking into the turn, and a HUD would not be practical in this situation. In level, straight ahead flight, taking a quick look at the instruments should be trivial. The only real use I can see for a HUD would be while doing loops...\n\nNow maybe a goggle-mounted see-through display would be more practical, but the good ones still cost $5k to $10K. I suppose a video output can easily be added for those desiring to experiment with alternative display technologies.\n\n> As far as navigation,with all the advances of GPS,we should\n\n> be VFR equipped.This will give us a safty margin when\n\n> weather turns suddenly bad(as often happens in mountain\n\n> flying),also our twilight flying will be less of a white\n\n> knuckle experience knowing we can make it back at dark.And\n\n> there we be a lot less airspace restrictions(no more begging\n\n> ground control to go hi-alt wave flying).\n\nWhat does it take for a sailplane to be \"VFR equipped\"? How close to a full autopilot do you want to get? This instrument may be within striking distance of that, with a suitable interface to the controls.\n\nSpeaking of autopilot, I was daydreaming about how the instrument may be able to help the pilot center up in a thermal, especially if small temperature sensors are placed in each wing tip. Optimizing turn radius via estimating the desired bank angle and tail slip is beyond me right now, but not beyond possibility.\n\n> As far as\n\n> instrament manipulation.I think this should all be\n\n> integrated into a control set comfortably under our\n\n> non-flying hand.Something like a rigid handle with buttons\n\n> on it,so we dont lose proper placement during turbulent\n\n> flying.\n\nHow much instrument manipulation do you presently do, and when and why? I suspect a suitably well designed instrument will not demand that the pilot make display changes during turbulent flying. I'd rather first look into automated intelligent display changes and informative voice cues before adding external control hardware (which is always the first thing to break). Remember, the unit will have an accelerometer, and will know when it is bumpy. But it should also be simple to add a PC joystick port, then any PC-compatible game controller would work. And there are many extremely good ones out there, some with force feedback (there's something to think about...).\n\nThanks!\n\n-BobC\n\n\"Robert W.

If I could get it for free, so to speak,\n\nI might enjoy a system that would keep wings level. But it hardly\n\nseems that an autopilot is a good use of mass, energy, and complexity.\n\n>\n\n> Speaking of autopilot, I was daydreaming about how the instrument may be able to help the pilot center up in a thermal, especially if small temperature sensors are placed in each wing tip. Optimizing turn radius via estimating the desired bank angle and tail slip is beyond me right now, but not beyond possibility.\n\nFirst, the idea that the thermal is at a significantly different\n\ntemperature\n\nthan the surrounding air is not supported. As is pointed out in\n\nnumerous\n\nreferences (see http://www.ssa.org/Johnson/84-1997-02.pdf, section 1 D &\n\nE,\n\nfor example), the rising air in a thermal may have an increased\n\nwater content and could in fact be of lower temperature than the\n\nsurrounding\n\nair. In any event, the temperature difference will be small. Besides,\n\nby measuring temperature difference you are measuring an indirect\n\nvariable\n\n(which is not always bad, of course, and sometimes necessary) rather\n\nthan\n\nthe direct variable of \"going up\" (ok, ok, that's inferred from pressure\n\nchanges). But the point is that if in some thermals the temperature is\n\nlower\n\nthan surrounding air, will you then inadvertenly direct the pilot to fly\n\naway\n\nfrom the thermal?\n\nWhat's really interesting to me is that most cross country pilots that I\n\ntalk to never seem to ask for another instrument to use when centering\n\nthermals. The audio variometer + seat of the pants works very well; it\n\nshould\n\nonly take a reasonably competent pilot a few turns to center a thermal\n\nwith definite structure (other thermals may be a bit more challenging).\n\nOf the pilots that I have known who talk about automated thermal\n\ndirectors\n\nand such, all of them are relatively low time and few have worked up the\n\nnerve to get out of range of the field (of course, these are only the\n\npilots that *I* know ... others may have different experience.) This\n\nmakes me wonder if the value of such a device would extend beyond the\n\nbeginner stage, or if indeed such a new instrument would inhibit the\n\ndevelopment of thermal centering skills. Any new instrument would have\n\nto be substantially better than a skilled pilot with a good variometer\n\nin order to be of use (i.e. this would have to be an effective\n\nreplacement\n\nfor the variometer).\n\nDetection of thermals at great distance, of course, is a different\n\nmatter.\n\n... snip ...\n\nThere are two areas that I think could be addressed rapidly that would\n\nmake a big difference in our sport. The first, which has been regularly\n\nrevisited here in the group, is collision avoidance: we really could\n\nuse a low power, reliable, light weight system that alerted gliders\n\nto each other and to other aircraft in the area. Experience has shown\n\nthat\n\nyou can't always count on the other guy to watch where he's going (of\n\ncourse, none of us suffer from this deficiency).\n\nThe other area is VOICE! Voice output from our instruments, and voice\n\ninput to our instruments. I should be able to say into my boom\n\nmicrophone\n\n\"set MacCready four point five\" and hear \"MacCready setting four point\n\nfive\"\n\nfrom my STF variometer. I should be able to say \"set turnpoint\n\nHillsboro\" or\n\n\"nav goto Waco\" and hear a voice acknowledgement. I should even\n\nbe able to say \"say distance to next turnpoint,\" or \"say average thermal\n\nstrength\" and get the appropriate responses. Most of our sophisticated\n\ninstruments could be easily controlled with voice inputs, and this\n\ncombined with voice outputs would reduce cockpit workload and stress,\n\nand\n\nkeep our heads out of the cockpit where they belong.\n\nIf you really want to make an instrument that \"does it all,\" take the\n\nfunctions that we have now and integrate them into a single package\n\nwith a voice interface. I'll buy that!\n\nGreg\n\n--\n\nGregory H. Aicklen SGS 1-35C - \"PM\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\ngreg.a...@NOSPAMaud.alcatel.com you know what to do with the\n\nNOSPAM!\n\nJames, here are two thoughts, one about near field thermal detection and\n\nanother about far field detection.\n\nThere are only two things that can make a parcel of air bouyant compared to\n\nthe air at the same level, excess temperature and/or excess moisture. (Of\n\ncourse, a parcel of air may be ascending ballisticly, solely due to inertia,\n\nnear the top of a thermal.)\n\nIt is possible to detect both the temperature and moisture, near field, by\n\nthe use of a single \"wet bulb\" sensor. This \"wet bulb\" sensor would need to\n\nhave a very fast response time. It wouldn't matter whether temperature or\n\nmoisture was the main cause of the bouyancy, the sensor would effectively\n\nsum the two.\n\nA single \"wet bulb\" sensor in the nose could measure the rate-of-change of\n\nbouyancy to show if the glider was traveling into, or away from, bouyant\n\nair. Two sensors on the wingtips could measure the lateral gradient. A\n\nsmall computer could use all of this data to generate a display the local\n\nbouancy gradient vector. A pilot turning in the direction of this local\n\nbouyancy gradient vector should have a better chance of finding the core of\n\na thermal.\n\nFar field detection is a very chalenging problem, but two technologies seem\n\nto me to have the best promise. IR and Doppler RADAR/LIDAR. (It needs to\n\nbe noted at the very start when discussing far field thermal detection that\n\nknowing the current location of a distant thermal may be useless since it\n\nmay be gone by the time you could get there. We should really be talking\n\nabout medium-distance detection.)\n\nIt seems likely that all thermals have at least a small excess of water\n\nvapor. (this is why cumulus sometimes form at the top) Water vapor is\n\nalmost opaque to IR at some wavelengths and therefore thermals should show\n\nobservable contrast at these wavelengths when viewed against a diffuse IR\n\nbackground such as the earth. I suspect this has been done with very\n\nexpensive equipment. A problem is that not all water vapor in the sky is in\n\nthermals.\n\nIt is also likely that all thermals transport aerosols (dust, insects\n\netc...) up into the sky. These aerosols are detectable by millimeter\n\nwavelength RADARS and LIDARS. (Fine aerosols also absorb and radiate IR\n\neffectively.)

Observing the Doppler shift could detect rising aerosols that\n\nmark a thermal. Range gating, or looking at a restricted volume of space,\n\nwould be neccessary to remove background clutter.\n\nIty might be that none of these technologies, by themselves, are workable.\n\nHowever, data fusion or the intelligent conbination of them all might\n\nprovide useful information.\n\nI'll leave it to others to decide if the use of technology to find thermals\n\nis appropriate for the sporting aspects of soaring. I'm only discussing\n\nwhat might be possible.\n\nBill Daniels\n\n\n\nTodd Pattist wrote:\n\n> Does the Ball unit have magnetic heading sensing?\n\nNot yet. Magnetic heading sensors have only recently seen improvements in sensitivity, power consumption and cost that makes incorporating one into any high-end instrument almost a no-brainer.\n\nThings have improved to the point that a couple other applications for such a sensor become worth thinking about.\n\nFirst, at \"sufficient\" altitude the local magnetic field looses many of the higher frequency bumps and wiggles common at ground level, and the field becomes locally uniform for a mile or so at a time. A stable field and a 3-axis sensor allow both instrument 3-D orientation and/or 6-axis velocity (first time derivative of position) and/or acceleration (second derivative) to be determined.\n\nWhile it is not possible to extract all this information simultaneously (due to a lack of known reference), when combined with other instruments (mainly GPS) and an extraordinarily good field model (if such a thing exists - I haven't checked), it may serve as a \"true\" reference that can provide enough information to separate the acceleration due to gravity from all other accelerated motion of the aircraft, something no onboard accelerometer can do (it takes a true inertial nav system for that). The response speed would be quite fast, but so would the noise, so I'm guessing a small amount of averaging will be needed, something on the order of 100-500ms.\n\nAt the very best, in conjunction with other instruments (accelerometer and GPS) it may be able to provide a usable artificial horizon (and \"wings level\" sensor). Might be useful if you suddenly find yourself inside a cloud you told the FAA you'd never ever enter...\n\nWhile interesting to think about, such a sensor may prove to be unnecessary. In particular, when two or more GPS antennae with corresponding RF front ends have their signals correlated, data streams will be produced that will produce differential vectors that can determine relative position to well within 1 cm. Such sensors were used on the MIT entry in a flying autonomous robot contest, in conjunction with DGPS for positional accuracy. Way too cool.\n\nThat's the ultimate goal. With GPS antennae in each wing tip and the tail, the orientation (but not position) of the aircraft relative to the GPS constellation can be known to within 1 cm. To obtain precise position, DGPS will be needed. If it weren't for the relatively slow cycle time of the GPS signal (1 second), this configuration could replace all other instruments. But not yet.\n\n-BobC\n\n\"Gregory H. Aicklen\" wrote:\n\n> \"Robert W.

Nor do I know of anybody who can. Especially not a HUD that will fit and work in all canopies and cockpits of all sailplanes. But I can make a panel instrument that will fit everywhere, and I can provide outputs for those wanting to create their own HUDs, or for any third-party manufacturer to adapt their HUD to.\n\nThere are so many things a HUD can be used for, that it doesn't seem to make sense for it to be part of just one instrument. It should integrate the data from multiple instruments, and should thus be thought of as its own instrument. Conventional instrument displays are like individual TVs that can be tuned to only a single station. If you want more information, you have to add more displays. A HUD integrates a tuner, and maybe PIP, so that a single display can do the work of many. That's way beyond where this instrument will go.\n\nSecond, I want to build to where the customer experience is. I am aware of absolutely no customer experience with HUDs in any gliding aircraft, and I am aware of absolutely no evidence that they will even be useful. I suspect HUDs may be like that new Christmas toy that is discarded by New Year's Day: Everybody thinks they want it until they actually have it.\n\nOr, to put it differently, I'm hoping to evolve the state of the art in integrated glider instrumentation. I'm not looking to reinvent it, especially not in the area of displays.\n\n> > Speaking of autopilot, I was daydreaming about how the instrument may be able to help the pilot center up in a thermal, especially if small temperature sensors are placed in each wing tip. Optimizing turn radius via estimating the desired bank angle and tail slip is beyond me right now, but not beyond possibility.\n\n>\n\n> First, the idea that the thermal is at a significantly different temperature\n\n> than the surrounding air is not supported.

I have. In the testing I did, it WORKS. But yes, that was only at low altitude.\n\nSecondly, the addition of a humidity sensor allows a true air density and thermal energy content to be determined. It may be necessary to place a humidity sensor in each wing tip as well. That guarantees the issue of thermal detection, so long as the humidity sensor responds fast enough.\n\nDo sailplanes have wing tip lights? I think I've found a way to avoid adding wires in the wing by modulating a signal onto the DC lines to the lights (if there are any). If I can integrate the temperature and pressure sensors with the modulator into a tiny package, then mounting and using such a sensor becomes trivial. And easy to remove and return for full credit!\n\n> What's really interesting to me is that most cross country pilots that I\n\n> talk to never seem to ask for another instrument to use when centering\n\n> thermals.

The profile of each core can be remembered and plotted by the instrument, and \"best guess\" thermaling hints can be produced. The more you try to thermal, the better the \"image\" of the thermal will be, and the better the advice will be. But it would be a shame if the advice only became usable after the thermal tops out!\n\n> Detection of thermals at great distance, of course, is a different matter.\n\nAs I said in another post, \"It Ain't Gonna Happen\". There are just too many atoms in the field of view with too few atoms representing the core of the thermal. Additionally, multispectral sensing may be needed to measure water content as well, so that total energy may properly be determined. My guess is that \"stereo\" sensors cannot possibly do the task, and that the only faint possibility would be true long-baseline IR interferometry (and possibly 3-D image reconstruction). And the small amount of information being extracted would require an exceptional S/N ratio, which in turn means sensors cooled to near absolute zero.\n\nBut that's using IR methods. There is Another Hope: Doppler Radar. Moderate success in detecting wind shear via radar has been demonstrated, but not using an airborne instrument. The airborne radars look for water droplets, and not gas transport interfaces (thermal edges). So until gliders can carry semi trailers aloft, this one will have to wait as well. But at the rate things are being miniaturized and integrated, a suitable Doppler radar the size of a cell phone should be introduced next year...\n\n> There are two areas that I think could be addressed rapidly that would\n\n> make a big difference in our sport.

A full 2.4 GHz spread-spectrum digital network can be carried aloft in an object the size and weight of a deck of cards (excluding battery and antenna). Even full satellite communications (via Motorola's Iridium system) is easily portable. Just as this instrument will have nearly unlimited room for waypoints, the ability to transmit and accept position data can also be added so that each glider is viewed as a \"dynamic\" waypoint. You can get distance, bearing and closing velocity to any aircraft for which you have data, and collision avoidance algorithms can be run every time new data is received or a course change is made.\n\nWhile I do not expect to actually get into the RF aspect of things, the networking is a different matter. There are other uses of a network interface on a smart instrument (beyond upload and download to a PC), and a distributed airborne RF network is just one.\n\nOther important features of the airborne network are \"visibility\" and \"safety\". For a competition, the positions of all participants can be tracked from a central location in real time. If a signal is lost, the last position is known, and the pilot can be raised on VHF immediately.\n\nThere are just too many good reasons for this to happen, but getting RF and protocols standardized will take time. I suspect the ham packet radio network will be the natural starting place.\n\n> The other area is VOICE! Voice output from our instruments, and voice\n\n> input to our instruments.

While there are chips that do limited vocabulary recognition (20 words) in a speaker-independent manner, there is no general recognition system suitable for compact battery operated systems (way too much CPU horsepower is needed), and the results are fairly bad in ideal conditions, not to mention in a cockpit.\n\nTake your laptop aloft with Dragon Dictate and just talk. See what you get when you land. I am interested in the results of any and all experiments of this type, since providing a command input from a laptop running voice recognition software would be quite easy.\n\n-BobC\n\nMaybe the answer to your questions is\n\n\"Robert W.

Campbell Rd.\n\ngreg.a...@NOSPAMaud.alcatel.com Richardson, TX 75081\n\nUSA\n\nI've recently retired after some 35 years trying ,and sometimes\n\nsucceeeding ,in making HUDs work in paraffin burners such as F16,\n\nA7and the like.\n\nThe fundamental truth about a HUD is that it enables you to\n\ncombine the information which you can't readily determine from\n\nlooking at the outside world such as speed , vario reading, heading\n\nwith the outside world information which is difficult to replicate on\n\ninstruments--how about position of other aircraft in your thermal\n\n,cloud texture and position,etc.\n\nThe basic HUD was designed to enable pilots of high speed low flying\n\n(200ft) aircraft to use this combination of real world and instrument\n\ninformation without having to peer into the cockpit to scan the head\n\ndown instruments. It works great in that environment and i wish I had\n\nbeen able to have one in my first Olympia which was even longer ago\n\nthan my first HUD.\n\nHowever as others have pointed out image collimation somewhere\n\napproximating to nominal infinity is essential and its omission was the\n\ncause of the failure of the HUDIS. In turn collomation means optics\n\nwhich means tailoring to different cockpits and also expense.\n\nHowever since we aren't in the business of achieving miliradian type\n\noverlay accuracies on the outside world for weapon aiming or I/F\n\npurposes we can afford to be a lot less demanding in the optical\n\ndesign\n\nThe other area which we can save on is I believe \"field of view\".\n\nFighter pilots and Transport pilots like the largest FOV possible\n\nbecause they want to encompass as large a view of the outside world\n\nas possible and are using most of the information displayed on the\n\nHUD to fly the aircraft accurately in combat manouevring, weapon\n\ndelivery, I/F procedures,etc. Glider pilots do not IMHO have such a\n\ncompelling reason for a large FOV nice (and EXPENSIVE) though it\n\nwould be .\n\nInstead I suggest that glider pilots desparately need a display which\n\nenables them to avoid having to scan their head down instruments\n\nand to concentrate their attention on the outside world so reducing\n\nthe ever increasing risk of air to air collisions. A HUD or similar device\n\nwhich enabled them to remain eye focussed at \"infinity\"and which\n\ncould form part of their wide scan of the outside world could make a\n\ndeal of difference.\n\nWe don't NEED a great deal of information at the times when we are\n\ngrappling with thermals, gaggles, source searches and the like. I\n\nwould suggest ASI, integrated vario/air mass,Heading,waypoint\n\nbearing steering error,plus altimeter or glide slope error in feet would\n\nbe more than enough. That amounts to Four digit groups and One\n\nanalogue deviation index. Furthermore this could be de-cluttered to\n\nASI , vario integrator and altimeter or glide slope error when circling.\n\nThe resultant display could be readily incorporated in a sensible\n\nergonomic manner on a combiner glass some 2\" square in the head\n\nout field of scan,most probably on the centreline(spelt re). Be assured\n\nthat long years of argument and much mental scar tissue has\n\nrepeatedly shown me that you should always try to display the\n\nMINIMUM amount of information that the pilot needs to perform the\n\ntask accurately rather than the Maximum which the instrument is\n\ncapable of.Some of the over cluttered symbology of modern jet\n\ncockpits bears witness .\n\nWhich leads me to the end of this little diatribe. In the UK we are\n\nincreasingly concerned about the rise in air to air collisions\n\nsomething that is also being repeated in France. There is some\n\nevidence that this is coming from too much head down time spent\n\ninterrogating or otherwise using the new generation of data rich\n\nelectronic displays. We badly need to find a way of retaining the\n\nusefulness of these new integrated data source instruments whilst\n\nremoving as far as possible the safety problem they pose. The HUD\n\nMAY be one solution but there could be others .The BGA is going to\n\nconsider seed corning a design feasibilty competition to look at\n\npotential solutions.

My thoughts follow...\n\nPeter A Hearne wrote:\n\n\n\nThere is another means to convey information without looking down at an instrument: Audio. The low prices for processor power and memory make the addition of spoken and tone audio output fairly simple. Sliding tone vario indication is common, and spoken output can be used in at least two ways: 1) Announce when an alarm setpoint has been reached or cleared. 2) Announce the value of a reading, either on demand or periodically.\n\nAudio may be able to meet the basic needs of the pilot when on thermal and glide, and the pilot can look at and/or interact with the instrument for less basic needs.\n\nThere is also an alternative to the HUD for look-thru display, namely the visor or monocle transflective display. For such a display to be stable, the pilot would need to wear a helmet (probably not a bad idea in a small cockpit, especially during turbulence). With such a device, and unlike a HUD, the pilot wouldn't even have to look straight ahead to see the information. It would also be compatible with all canopies (though there might be some helmet compatibility issues), also unlike a HUD.\n\nThe disadvantages are cabling and handling, since anything on a helmet would need to be connected to the instrument, and if the helmet is dropped, so is the display. This seems to have worked well enough for the Army in the Apache helicopter FLIR and chin gun targeting and control system, so I would guess the ruggedness issues have been solved (at least once).\n\nI have no idea what commercial versions of these displays cost, but the MIT wearable computer group has built simple ones for full video overlay using the viewfinder display from camcorders (with eyepiece optics) and a simple piece of glass as the transflector. As I recall, they found the monochrome displays were sharper, higher contrast, and easier to look through. The color displays were described as being terrible for look-thru use (\"an Acid trip,\" one user said), but fine for Virtual Reality use.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I like the idea of providing a simple form of video output from the instrument, and let the user community decide which look-thru display system works best (if any). Such an output would also support experimentation, something no present instrument provides to any significant measure, and would not affect FAA and IGC certification in any way. It would also allow a simple upgrade to a color display (maybe a 4\" LCD monitor) without modifying the display built into the instrument. To save power, the video circuitry would only be turned on when a video cable is connected.\n\nHmmm. This could work. And with little impact to the overall instrument design. I just need to see how good the video is from the single-chip video systems (controller + memory + RF).\n\n-BobC\n\nI'm just off to Gap Tallard for 6 weeks of soaring in God's play pen\n\nso I wanted to have one last crack at these problems before I drop out.\n\nThis topic has the title What's in a perfect soaring instrument.\n\nUnfortunately most of us have been identifying particular bits of\n\ntechnology rather than trying to present a Top Down approach and\n\nrationale of the problems and solutions\n\nAs someone has said most of the technologies already exist But he\n\nshould have added \"mostly in a form suitable for aircraft which are\n\nnot subject to critical limitations on power, cost and installation\n\nspace\". We still have to do some very clever engineering to get the\n\npower consumption of radiating devices down to acceptable levels\n\nand this includes everything from transponders through to bright\n\nillumination sources for some of the fancy displays we have been\n\ntalking about.I suspect the 100 year battery will not help us solve this\n\nparticular problem.Hopefully some of the clever Japanese sensors etc\n\nfor the more elaborate R/C models and the DoD developments in\n\nmicro min flying machines will give us a new technology bank to draw\n\nfrom.\n\nThe basic approach MUST be to examine solutions which might\n\nsolve the the glider pilot's problems within the power, cost and\n\nsize/weight constaints of a 15 metre class sailplane.It must be\n\nemphasised that these constraints are the fundamental framework in\n\nwhich the technology solutions must emerge.\n\nFor starters ,in trying to develop solutions to problems rather than\n\nfitting problems to existing solutions ,there definitely seems to be a\n\npilot interface problem (how I hate that phrase) associated with the\n\nemergence of large amounts of data outputs from the range of\n\nintegrated data sources and data procesing which is finding its way\n\ninto sailplanes. We need to develop this interface in a manner which\n\nallows us to reduce the increased accident rate arising from too much\n\nhead down time involved in controlling these new systems and\n\ninterpreting their outputs. These new interface devices could include\n\nHUDs ,\"spectacle/visor\" displays ,voice audio and I suggest also\n\nsimple voice recognition for system mode control which has already\n\nhit the PC market\n\nThe second problem which is rapidly going to hit us in Europe is\n\n\"How do we identify ourselves automatically to the ATC system within\n\nthe constraints ,particularly power,set out above.We should be\n\nlooking very closely at alternatives to transponders, such as ADS-B\n\n(automatic reporting of gps position by data link) or other passive\n\nmethods of identifying a reflector enhanced skin paint return as a\n\n\"glider\". This is an area where the technology is emergent rather than\n\nexisting.\n\nThirdly we need to set some top down targets for areas where the\n\ntechnology doesn't really exist in a useable form outside of the\n\nlaboratory bench. This would definitely include Thermal Detection\n\nsomething that I tried for years to persuade one of my labs at Marconi\n\nto tackle \"in their spare time\". One of the major points dogging us\n\nhere as has been pointed out is that we don't really know what is the\n\noptimum physical parameter to measure to detect the likely presence\n\nof rising air. Different parameters seem better at different times. My\n\nown feeling is that a direct remote measurement of air density (not\n\ntemperature) if that could be done would most likely give you the\n\ncorrect indication of buoyant air.\n\nThe area where the technology currently does seem to be more or\n\nless adequate is in the integrated sensor and systems group and in\n\nflight recording. However I would make a pitch for avoiding excessive\n\ncentralisation of sensors etc in a single indivisible interdependent\n\nassemblage. Dissimilar redundancy is much better for ones health\n\nand peace of mind\n\nOverall I would repeat my plea to develop only equipment and\n\nsystems for which there is a real and perceived need which has been\n\nproperly derived from a Top Down study.(NO! I didn't work at Rand but\n\nthey do do a good job) We don't want to get into the boat drivers' habit\n\nof buying fashionable junk which obsoletes after 2 or 3 years .\n\nThat completes my end of term address except for one item. How\n\nmany other pilots are there like me who have difficulty in both\n\nremembering or identifying what FLAP angle they have got\n\nselected.Some type of coaming level display would save me a lot of\n\ndangerous head down time peering to see at what flap setting I am\n\nflying and better still also warn me when it was the wrong one or\n\nwhen I had forgotten to change. It is not difficult to do and it has been\n\ndone in one or two one off installations.
