        "text": "Call it controlled consolidation mayhem.\n\nWorldwide mergers and acquisitions have been on a rampage to the $1.59 trillion level in 1999, nearly 13 percent higher than last year's record pace. They're affecting every industry, companies of all sizes, and millions of stockholders and employees.When I wrote the book \"Global Investing 1999: A Guide to the 50 Best Stocks in the World\" (Warner Books: 1999), there was minor reshuffling among the companies included before publication. But as the \"Global Investing 2000\" edition, due out the beginning of next year, has taken shape, changes have accelerated.\n\nFor example, Argentina's YPF oil company was taken over and, as a result, cut from the book's global list of 50. List member Allied-Signal acquired Honeywell to become Honeywell International (there goes the alphabetization), while British environmental control firm Siebe became Invensys after it merged with the company BTR.\n\nIn addition, Italian retailer Gucci Group was the target of an unsolicited bid and deleted from the book's preliminary list earlier this year, but fought off the unwanted suitor and was put back on. Two companies on the list, rival French oil companies TotalFina and Elf Aquitaine, are playing the mating game. TotalFina made an unsolicited bid for Elf, which countered with a so-called \"Pac Man\" bid to buy TotalFina.\n\nGot all that? It all sounds like a convoluted soap opera, but the main plot line is that M&A activity will be a market driver throughout this year. As an investor, keep up on all your stocks, and if you're adventurous, consider buying some potential takeover stocks.\n\nThe hottest groups are communications; broadcasting; computer software; banking and finance; and electric, gas, water and sanitary services. The top deals have included Vodafone Group's $62.7 billion purchase of AirTouch Communications; AT&T's $55.8 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group; Qwest Communications International's $34.7 billion purchase of US WEST; BP Amoco Plc.'s $27 billion acquisition of Atlantic Richfield; and Lucent Technologies' $24 billion purchase of Ascend Communications.\n\nBig deals draw attention but may not be the best for investors.\n\n\"Since news tends to leak out before big-profile deals, stock prices tend to rise substantially well before the announcement of the deal, and there isn't too much of a pop when the takeover is actually announced,\" observed Charles LaLoggia, editor of the monthly Special Situation Investor newsletter, 7811 Montrose Road, Potomac, MD 20854-3394 (1-800-301-8974), which costs $395 annually.\n\nThere usually isn't as big a premium in a takeover involving a large-cap as with a small-cap, LaLoggia said, for the large-cap may have already been fully priced or overvalued. LaLoggia knows what he's talking about. Thirty-six of his recommended stocks received takeover offers in the past 37 months. The most recent, Sugan Inc. and Aquarion Water, received bids with premiums of 200 percent and 50 percent, respectively, above his original recommended price.\n\nAmong potential takeovers whose stock is worth buying, LaLoggia recommends drugstore chains Drug Emporium and Longs Drug Stores. Another group undergoing rapid consolidation is water services, with takeover potential in E'Town, American States Water and Connecticut Water Service. Within the burglar alarm/security industry, Pittston Brink's is a logical possibility, he believes.\n\nTwo food chains with takeover potential are Great Atlantic & Pacific and Smart & Final, while in the gaming industry he likes Boyd Gaming and slot-machine maker WMS Industries. His energy services pick is Dawson Geophysical.\n\nMost experts say individual investors should sell quickly whenever a company whose stock they own is being acquired.\n\n\"If you're lucky enough to own a stock that's been announced as a takeout, my advice is to sell at that moment,\" urged Judy Radler Cohen, editor of the New York-based Mergers & Acquisitions Report newsletter. \"Don't hang around, for at that point it becomes a different animal with questions such as antitrust and financing involved, and the money managers and institutional investors take over.\"\n\nArbitrageurs typically sell the acquiring company's stock while buying the target company, putting the acquirer's stock under pressure. If you own the acquirer's stock, she reasons, you should probably be patient and hold on for the longer term.\n\nBe cautious when considering a potential takeover stock.\n\n\"Individual investors must be careful not to get sucked into rumors and buy stocks simply because they think they'll be taken over,\" warned Tom Burnett, president of the New York-based Merger Insight Inc. institutional research service. \"Buy primarily because the company has good management, is well-organized and has products and services the market wants. If somebody does make a bid, it's icing on the cake.\"\n\nMost rumors do not become reality, said Burnett. If you own a stock and a takeover offer is made, sell if you have doubts about antitrust or regulatory issues, he added.\n\n\"In today's world, there's no reason that any organization can't be acquired or merged,\" asserted Scott Adelson, managing editor of the Los Angeles-based Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin mergers and acquisitions research firm.\n\nAndrew Leckey, a financial news anchor on the CNBC cable television network, answers questions only through the column.
