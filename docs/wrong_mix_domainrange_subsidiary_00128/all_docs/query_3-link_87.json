        "text": "Major film studios are production and distribution companies that release a substantial number of films annually and consistently command a significant share of box office revenue in a given market. In the American and international markets, the major film studios, often known simply as the majors or the Big Six studios, are commonly regarded as the six diversified media conglomerates whose various film production and distribution subsidiaries collectively command approximately 80 to 85% of U.S. box office revenue. The term may also be applied more specifically to the primary motion picture business subsidiary of each respective conglomerate.\n\nSince the dawn of filmmaking, the U.S. major film studios have dominated both American cinema and the global film industry. U.S. studios have benefited from a strong first-mover advantage in that they were the first to industrialize filmmaking and master the art of mass-producing and distributing high-quality films with broad cross-cultural appeal. Today, the Big Six majors – Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox – routinely distribute hundreds of films every year into all significant international markets (that is, where discretionary income is high enough for consumers to afford to watch films). It is \"nearly impossible\" for a film to reach a broad international theatrical audience without being first picked up by one of the majors for distribution. Today, all the Big Six major studios are also members of the Motion Picture Association (MPA) and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).\n\nOverview[]\n\nThe current \"Big Six\" majors (Universal, Paramount, WB, Disney, Sony Pictures and Fox) all originate with film studios that were active during Hollywood's \"Golden Age\". Three of these were among that original era's \"Big Eight\" major film studios.\n\nIn addition to being members of today’s \"Big Five\", Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. were also part of the original \"Big Five\", along with RKO Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nUniversal Pictures was, during that early era, considered one of \"Little Three\", along with United Artists and Columbia Pictures, but became quickly a part of the Big Five. Meanwhile, United Artists began as a distribution company for several independent producers and later began producing its own films, and was eventually acquired by MGM in 1981. Columbia Pictures eventually merged in 1987 with Tri-Star Pictures to form Columbia Pictures Entertainment.\n\nDuring the Golden Age, Walt Disney Productions and Dora Wilson Productions were independent production companies and not considered a \"major studio\" until the mid-1950s and mid-1980s respectively. Walt Disney joined 20th Century Fox and nine others (DW-Go Fish, Columbia, Paramount, Universal, MGM, RKO, Republic, Allied Artists and Warner Bros.) to comprise the \"Big Eleven\" In 1989, Sony acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which became Sony Pictures Entertainment in 1991.\n\nWhile the Big Six's studio lots are located within 15 miles (24 km) of each other, Paramount is the only member of the Big Six still based in Hollywood and located entirely within the official city limits of the City of Los Angeles. Warner Bros. and Disney are both located in Burbank while Universal is in the nearby unincorporated area of Universal City, Columbia in Culver City and Fox in Century City.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony Pictures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tokyo-based Sony Group Corporation, and is the only US film studio owned by a foreign conglomerate, while Disney is owned by Cupertino-based Apple (via The Walt Disney Company) alongside Warner Bros. is owned by Dallas-based AT&T (via Warner Bros. Global) and the other two report to corporations headquartered in New York City — Verzion (via Viacom) and News Corporation. Most of today's Big Five also control subsidiaries with their own distribution networks that concentrate on arthouse pictures (e.g. Universal's Focus Features) or genre films (e.g. Sony's Screen Gems).\n\nOutside of the Big Six, there are several smaller U.S. production and distribution companies, known as independents or \"indies\". The leading independent producer/distributors such as StudioCanal are sometimes referred to as \"mini-majors\".\n\nToday, the Big Six major studios are primarily financial backers and distributors of films whose actual production is largely handled by independent companies – either long-running entities or ones created for and dedicated to the making of a specific film. For example, Disney and Columbia TriStar distribute their films through affiliated divisions (Buena Vista Pictures Distribution and Sony Pictures Releasing, respectively) while the others function as both production and distribution companies. The specialty divisions (such as Fox Searchlight Pictures and Focus Features) often acquire distribution rights to films in which the studio has had no prior involvement. While the majors still do a modicum of true production, their activities are focused more in the areas of development, financing, marketing, and merchandising. Those business functions are still usually performed in or near Los Angeles, even though the runaway production phenomenon means that most films are now mostly or completely shot on location at places outside Los Angeles.\n\nThe Big Six major studios are also members of the Motion Picture Association (MPA) and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).\n\nMajors[]\n\nCurrent[]\n\nCurrent major film studios Studio parent\n\n(Conglomerate) Major film studio unit\n\nSecondary studio unit\n\nDate founded Arthouse/indie Genre movie/B movie Animation Other divisions and brands NBCUniversal\n\n(Comcast) Universal Pictures\n\nRKO Pictures\n\nApril 30. 1912\n\nJanuary 25, 1929\n\nGramercy Pictures\n\nFocus Features\n\nGo Fish Pictures DreamWorks Pictures\n\nWorking Title Films\n\nRogue Pictures\n\nUSA Films\n\nAmblin Entertainment\n\nImagine Entertainment\n\nValiant Studios\n\nNintendo Studios\n\nMattel Studios Universal Animation Studios\n\nRKO Animation\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nUniversal Television Animation\n\nRKO Television Animation\n\nDreamWorks Television Animation\n\nIllumination Entertainment\n\nPacific Data Images\n\nAmblimation\n\nUniversaltoon Studios Spyglass Entertainment\n\nLegendary Pictures\n\nPolyGram Filmed Entertainment\n\nITC Entertainment Viacom\n\n(Verizon) Paramount Pictures\n\nRepublic Pictures\n\nMay 8, 1912\n\n1935\n\nMiramax Films\n\nParamount Classics Lionsgate Films\n\nDimension Films\n\nSummit Entertainment\n\nParamount Players\n\nSkydance Media\n\nDark Horse Studios\n\nSega Studios\n\nHasbro Studios Paramount Animation\n\nRepublic Animation\n\nMiramax Animation\n\nLionsgate Animation\n\nCBS Paramount Television Animation\n\nIlion Animation Studios\n\nMTV Animation\n\nNickelodeon Animation Studio Insurge Pictures\n\nRoadside Attractions\n\nLakeshore Entertainment Warner Bros.

This led to the creation of the Motion Picture Patents Company, widely known as the Trust. Comprising the nine largest U.S. film companies, it was \"designed to eliminate not only independent film producers but also the country's 10,000 independent [distribution] exchanges and exhibitors.\" Though its many members did not consolidate their filmmaking operations, the New York–based Trust was arguably the first major North American movie conglomerate. The independents' fight against the Trust was led by Carl Laemmle, whose Chicago-based Laemmle Film Service, serving the Midwest and Canada, was the largest distribution exchange in North America. Laemmle's efforts were rewarded in 1912 when the U.S. government ruled that the Trust was a \"corrupt and unlawful association\" and must be dissolved. On June 8, 1912, Laemmle organized the merger of his production division, IMP (Independent Motion Picture Company), with several other filmmaking companies, creating the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in New York City. By the end of the year, Universal was making movies at two Los Angeles facilities: the former Nestor Film studio in Hollywood, and another studio in Edendale. The first Hollywood major studio was in business.\n\nIn 1918, four brothers—Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner—founded the first Warner Bros. Studio on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. On April 4, 1923, the Warner Bros. incorporated their fledgling movie company as \"Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc.\". Though their first film was My Four Years in Germany, Warner Bros. released their full fledged movie The Jazz Singer in 1927. Warner Bros. were the pioneers of the sound film era as they established Vitaphone. Because of The Jazz Singer's success (along with Lights of New York, The Singing Fool and The Terror), Warner Bros. was able to acquire a much larger studio in Burbank. This studio is used by Warner Bros. from 1928. It has the signature watertower. Warner Bros. eventually expanded its studio operations to Leavesden in London. Warner Bros. Studio Leavesden is the main studio in production of hit movies like the Harry Potter film series, The Dark Knight and the recent ones like The Batman and Ready Player One.\n\nIn 1916, a second powerful Hollywood studio was established when Adolph Zukor merged his Famous Players Film Company movie production house with the Jesse L. Lasky Company to form Famous Players–Lasky. The combined studio acquired Paramount Pictures as a distribution arm and eventually adopted its name. That same year, William Fox relocated his Fox Film Corporation from Fort Lee, New Jersey to Hollywood and began expanding.\n\nIn 1923, Walt Disney had founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio and The Disney Brothers Features Company with his brother Roy and animator Ub Iwerks. Renamed as Walt Disney Productions, Disney became a powerful independent over the next three decades focusing on animation with its shorts and films being distributed over the years by various majors; primarily Leslie B. Mace, Winkler Pictures, Universal Pictures, Celebrity Productions, Cinephone, Columbia Pictures, United Artists, United Artists Pictures and finally RKO. In its first year in 1928, Celebrity Productions and Cinephone had released its first blockbuster Steamboat Willie. Though over the next decades Disney and its associated distributors share of the box-office did hit similar marks, its relatively small output and exclusive focus on G-rated films meant that it was not generally considered a major.\n\nThe Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America and the Independent Producers' Association declared war in 1925 on what they termed a common enemy — the \"film trust\" of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount, and First National, which they claimed dominated the industry by not only producing and distributing motion pictures, but by entering into exhibition as well. On October 6, 1927, Warner Bros. released The Jazz Singer, starring Al Jolson, and a whole new era began, with \"pictures that talked\", bringing the studio to the forefront of the film industry. The Jazz Singer played to standing-room-only crowds throughout the country and earned a special Academy Award for Technical Achievement. Fox, in the forefront of sound film along with Warner Bros., was also acquiring a sizable circuit of movie theaters to exhibit its product.\n\nThe majors during the Golden Age[]\n\nBetween late 1928, when RCA's David Sarnoff engineered the creation of the RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) studio, and the end of 1949, when Paramount divested its theater chain—roughly the period considered Hollywood's Golden Age—there were eight Hollywood studios commonly regarded as the \"majors\". Of these eight, the so-called Big Five were integrated conglomerates, combining ownership of a production studio, distribution division, and substantial theater chain, and contracting with performers and filmmaking personnel: Loew's/MGM, Paramount, Fox (which became 20th Century-Fox after a 1935 merger), Warner Bros., and RKO. The remaining majors were sometimes referred to as the \"Little Three\" or \"major minor\" studios. Two—Universal and Columbia (founded in 1924)—were organized similarly to the Big Five, except for the fact that they never owned more than small theater circuits (a consistently reliable source of profits). The third of the lesser majors, United Artists (founded in 1919), owned a few theaters and had access to production facilities owned by its principals, but it functioned primarily as a backer-distributor, loaning money to independent producers and releasing their films. During the 1930s, the eight majors averaged a total of 358 feature film releases a year; in the 1940s, the four largest companies shifted more of their resources toward high-budget productions and away from B movies, bringing the yearly average down to 288 for the decade.\n\nAmong the significant characteristics of the Golden Age was the stability of the Hollywood majors, their hierarchy, and their near-complete domination of the box office. At the midpoint of the Golden Age, 1939, the Big Five had market shares ranging from 22% (MGM) to 9% (RKO); each of the Little Three had around a 7% share. In sum, the eight majors controlled 95% of the market. Ten years later, the picture was largely the same: the Big Five had market shares ranging from 22% (MGM) to 9% (RKO); the Little Three had shares ranging from 8% (Columbia) to 4% (United Artists). In sum, the eight majors controlled 96% of the market.\n\nThe majors after the Golden Age[]\n\n1950s–1960s[]\n\nThe end of the Golden Age had been signaled by the majors' loss of a federal antitrust case that led to the divestiture of the Big Five's theater chains. Though this had virtually no immediate effect on the eight majors' box-office domination, it somewhat leveled the playing field between the Big Five and the Little Three. In November 1951, Decca Records purchased 28% of Universal; early the following year, the studio became the first of the classic Hollywood majors to be taken over by an outside corporation, as Decca acquired majority ownership. In 1953, Disney established its own distribution division, Buena Vista Film Distribution, to handle its own product which had been largely distributed by RKO. In contrast, there was United Artists, which had long operated under the financing-distribution model the other majors were now progressively shifting toward. Under Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin, who began managing the company in 1951, UA became consistently profitable. By 1956—when it released one of the biggest blockbusters of the decade, Around the World in 80 Days—it commanded a 10% market share. By the middle of the next decade, it had reached 16% and was the second-most profitable studio in Hollywood.\n\nFollowing MCA Inc.’s acquisition of Decca Records and the aforementioned Universal under Lew Wasserman in 1962, the later half of the 1960s were marked by four others — Paramount, United Artists, Warner Bros., and MGM — involved in a spate of corporate takeovers that left Columbia, Fox, and Disney under original ownership. Gulf+Western took over Paramount and Taft Broadcasting purchased MGM in 1966; and the Transamerica Corporation purchased United Artists in 1967. Warner Bros. underwent large-scale reorganization twice in two years: a 1967 merger with the Seven Arts company preceded a 1969 purchase by Kinney National, under Stephen J. Ross. MGM, in the process of a slow decline, changed ownership twice in the same span as well, winding up in the hands of financier Kirk Kerkorian also in 1969. The majors almost entirely abandoned low-budget production during this era, bringing the annual average of features released down to 160. The decade also saw Disney/Buena Vista commanding a prominent position in the market. Buoyed by the success of Mary Poppins, Disney achieved a 9% market share in 1964, more than Warner and its eventual subsidiary Fox. Though over the next two decades Disney/Buena Vista's share of the box-office would continue to reach this level, the studio was still not considered a major as it did not release many films, and those it did release were exclusively G-rated.\n\n1970s–1980s[]\n\nThe early 1970s were difficult years for all the classic majors. Time Inc. bought Allied Artists in 1970. Movie attendance, which had been declining steadily since the end of the Golden Age, hit an all-time low by 1971. Disney by contrast began to ascend towards major status through a resurgence in its animated movies, beginning with The Rescuers (1977), and the studio began to enter the adult market with The Black Hole (1979), its first non-G rated film.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the industry had rebounded and a significant philosophical shift was in progress. As the majors focused increasingly on the development of the next hoped-for blockbuster and began routinely opening each new movie in many hundreds of theaters (an approach called \"saturation booking\"), their collective yearly release average fell to 81 films during 1975–84. The classic set of majors was shaken further in late 1980, when the disastrously expensive flop of Heaven's Gate effectively ruined United Artists. The studio was sold the following year to Taft, who merged it with MGM.\n\nMeanwhile, a new member was finally admitted to the club of major studios and two significant contenders emerged. With the combined output of Walt Disney Pictures, the establishment of the Touchstone Pictures brand in 1984, and increasing attention to the adult live-action market during the early 1980s, Disney/Buena Vista secured acknowledgment as a full-fledged major. Film historian Joel Finler identifies 1986 as the breakthrough year, when Disney rose to third place in market share and remained consistently competitive for a leading position thereafter.\n\nThe two emerging contenders were both newly formed companies. In 1978, Krim, Benjamin, and three other studio executives departed UA to found Orion Pictures as a joint venture with Warner Bros. It was announced optimistically as the \"first major new film company in 50 years\". Tri-Star Pictures was created in 1982 as a joint venture of future corporate sibling Columbia Pictures (at that time acquired by the Coca-Cola Company), HBO (then owned by WarnerMedia’s predecessor Time Inc.), and CBS. In 1985, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation acquired 20th Century-Fox (thus dropping that name’s hyphen), the last of both the classic Hollywood majors to be taken over by an outside corporation and five relatively healthy Golden Age majors to remain independent throughout that era.\n\nBy 1986, the combined share of the ten classic majors — Paramount, MGM/UA, Fox, Warner Bros., Allied Artists, Republic, Columbia, RKO, DreamWorks and Universal — fell to 64%, the lowest since the beginning of the Golden Age. Disney was in third place, behind only Paramount and Warner. Even including Disney/Buena Vista as a seventh major, the majors' control of the North American market was at a historic ebb. Smaller independents garnered 13%—more than any studio aside from Paramount. In 1964, by comparison, all of the companies outside of the then-seven majors and Disney had combined for a grand total of 1%. In the first edition of Finler's The Hollywood Story (1988), he wrote, \"It will be interesting to see whether the old-established studios will be able to bounce back in the future, as they have done so many times before, or whether the newest developments really do reflect a fundamental change in the US movie industry for the first times since the 20s.\"\n\n1990s–2000s[]\n\nThe aforementioned purchase of 20th Century Fox by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation left Disney under original ownership and presaged a new round of corporate acquisitions not long afterward. As part of that series, Columbia, Paramount and Warner Bros. received new owners once and for all while Universal changed corporate hands until the mid-2000s. Paramount's parent company Gulf+Western was renamed Paramount Communications and Coca-Cola sold Columbia to Japanese electronics firm Sony in 1989, creating Sony Pictures. The following year, Warner Communications merged with Time Inc. to birth Time Warner and Universal's parent company MCA was purchased by fellow Japanese electronics conglomerate Matsushita. At this time, both Tri-Star and Orion were essentially out of business: the former merged with Sony and Columbia. The most important contenders to emerge during the 1990s with Viacom’s purchase of Paramount Communications in 1994 — New Line Cinema, Miramax, and DreamWorks SKG — were likewise sooner or later brought into the majors' fold. Shortly after, Matsushita sold MCA (and Universal) to Seagram in 1996, then Vivendi in 2000, and later NBC’s parent company General Electric in 2004 to become NBCUniversal, Apple Computer, Inc. bought The Walt Disney Company in 1997.\n\nThe development of in-house pseudo-indie subsidiaries by the conglomerates—sparked by the 1992 establishment of Sony Pictures Classics and the success of Pulp Fiction (1994) on home video, significantly undermined the position of the true independents. The majors' release schedule rebounded: the six primary studio subsidiaries alone put out a total of 124 films during 2006; the three largest secondary subsidiaries (New Line, Fox Searchlight, and Focus Features) accounted for another 30. Box-office domination was fully restored: in 2006, the six major movie conglomerates combined for 89.8% of the North American market; Lionsgate and Miramax were almost exactly half as successful as their 1986 mini-major counterparts, sharing 6.1%; MGM came in at 1.8%; and all of the remaining independent companies split a pool totaling 2.3%.\n\nMore developments took place among the majors' subsidiaries. The very successful animation production house Pixar, whose films were distributed by Buena Vista, was acquired by Disney also in 2006.\n\n2010–present[]\n\nIn January 29, 2011, Comcast fully acquired NBCUniversal from General Electric and Vivendi.\n\nFrom June 14, 2018 to present, Warner Bros. was owned by AT&T, which completed its acquisition of Time Warner, renaming it \"WarnerMedia\", which contained all assets owned by Warner Bros. and its subsidiaries. It was again renamed \"Warner Bros. Global\" on April 8, 2022.\n\nHistorical organizational lineage[]\n\nThe nine Golden Age majors[]\n\nThe nine major film studios of the Golden Age have gone through significant ownership changes (\"independent\" meaning customarily identified as the primary commercial entity in its corporate structure; \"purchased\" meaning acquired anything from majority to total ownership). For instance, this does include Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group and DreamWorks Pictures, which despite being primarily not an independent animation studio during the Golden Age, is the only current existing major studio to remain under continuous autonomous ownership since its founding.\n\nUniversal Pictures[]\n\nFurther information: Universal Pictures\n\nIndependent, 1906–1936 (Carl Laemmle, a German-born American film producer, founded Universal Studios.)\n\nStandard Capital, 1936-1946 (Laemmle retired from the movie industry and sold a controlling interest of Universal to an American businessman Lewis Rosenstiel through Standard Capital.)\n\nUniversal-International, 1946–1952 (Lewis Rosenstiel, an American businessman, acquired a controlling interest in Universal Studios and merged it with International Pictures.)\n\nDecca, 1951–1962 (Decca records bought Universal-International)\n\nMCA Inc., 1962–1998 (MCA purchased Decca, then a subsidiary of that company, in which Universal and MCA officially merged.)\n\nMatsushita Electric, 1990–1995 (Japanese conglomerate Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
