        "text": "Tech stocks got smacked around some more Wednesday as investors continued shifting money away from silicon and back toward steel. A report from the US Commerce Department that factory orders for durable goods were up in March helped rekindle affection for the heavy-industry set.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was the market's pace-setter, briefly topping 10900 for the first time ever, but lost the wind from its sails as a late-afternoon sell-off chilled investor enthusiasm. The blue-chip index, swinging in and out of positive territory, ultimately gained 13.74 points to close at a record 10845.45.\n\nOn the tech side of the fence, the blood-letting worsened as the day wore on, with investors increasingly wary of those mammoth price-earnings ratios. The Wired Index fell 19.05 to 657.83, and the Nasdaq Composite Index was 52.14 lower at 2550.27. The S&P 500 was down 11.89 at 1350.91.\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Alexander Paris Sr., an analyst with Barrington Research. \"They're shifting into big stocks for safety.\"\n\nBy \"big,\" he means the old-fashioned industrial concerns that still populate the Dow, guys like Alcoa and Boeing and Caterpillar, which have P/E multiples ranging from about 18 to 24 -- nice, sensible numbers. He doesn't mean big-cap stocks with multiples in the range of, say, 700 -- like America Online (AOL).\n\nAOL shed US$8 to $145 despite topping estimates with quarterly profit of 11 cents a share (not including its multibillion-dollar purchase of Netscape Communications and other charges). Although AOL's revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, traders had been \"unofficially\" looking for even better results, and made their displeasure known when the company failed to deliver.\n\nSo if an old pal like AOL gets its booty kicked for turning a buck, is it any surprise that the Street is even harsher on a smaller, less-well-established online service? MindSpring Enterprises (MSPG) dropped 12 percent to $102.69 despite blowing by estimates with pro-forma quarterly income of 16 cents a share, or twice what it earned a year earlier.\n\nTalk about raising the bar. No wonder, then, that Amazon.com (AMZN) was down $13 at $192.88 before reporting its own earnings after the closing bell. A widening loss of 29 cents a share was anticipated, or about twice what the company lost in the previous quarter, and four times the setback seen a year ago. On the other hand, Amazon's revenue was expected to more than triple from a year before to $264 million, which clearly shows that the company is doing something right, if not making any money.\n\nSpeaking of which, iVillage (IVIL), the online women's network, fell 11 percent to $85 after reporting a pro-forma quarterly loss of 96 cents a share, or about twice what it lost a year ago. This was a bit better than expected, and how peeved can shareholders be considering that the company went public last month at an initial price of $24 per share?\n\nGoldman Sachs' resident guru, Abby Joseph Cohen, tried to kick-start a buying spree around midday by commenting at an investment conference that she believes stocks are now trading \"roughly at fair value.\" This time, though, investors were unimpressed by Cohen's appraisal, and the market pretty much ignored what she had to say.\n\nBarrington's Paris believes that it's in fact a sign of the market's long-term health that non-tech concerns are catching up a bit with their circuit-laden cousins, and that the techs are coming down a bit in price. \"If the market doesn't broaden out, forget it, it's not going anywhere,\" he said. \"This is a very positive trend.\"\n\nWe'll just have to see about that.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) was back in the news, announcing its purchase of software developer Amteva Technologies for $170 million. While this may bolster the company's services, investors frowned on the resulting fourth-quarter charge of as much as 7 cents a share, and pushed Cisco's stock down $3.31 to $111.75.\n\nRival network-systems specialist Ascend Communications (ASND) advanced 13 cents to $97.88 after meeting estimates with first-quarter earnings of 36 cents a diluted share. The company said its nearly $23 billion acquisition by Lucent Technologies remains on track. For its part, Lucent (LU) was down $1.13 at $60 even as it unveiled a new initiative for upgrading traditional phone networks.\n\nBMC Software (BMCS) is managing to shake of the Y2K blues. The company breezed by estimates with quarterly income of 47 cents a share, and reassured investors by saying its revenue increased 37 percent from a year earlier. This was unexpected seeing as how most other software makers are seeing sales plummet as corporate clients await the millennial reckoning. BMC's shares rose $1.50 to $43.25.\n\nAcross the Pacific, Sony (SNE) spilled $2.94 to $94.56 after posting a 19 percent decrease in group net profit for the fiscal year ended 31 March. Worse, the electronics and entertainment giant expects the current year to be even gloomier, and is forecasting a further 39 percent drop in income. \"For the time being, we just have to grin and bear it,\" said Sony's senior vice president, Masayoshi Morimoto. Investors may think otherwise.\n\nDaimlerChrysler (DCX) skidded $2.19 to $99.13 even as it reported a 23 percent hike in quarterly earnings to 1.64 euros a share, which is something like $1.75 (Market Cap is still a little funny about the euro). The company said it remains on course to surpass its full-year estimates, but traders are keeping a watchful eye on slumping car sales in Asia and Latin America.\n\nDog of the day honors go to drug wholesaler McKesson HBOC (MCK), which tumbled 47 percent to $34.63 as it revised its fourth-quarter and full-year results after coming across an accounting glitch. Oops. No fewer than five leading brokerages promptly downgraded the company's stock, and a class-action suit was filed seeking to recover shareholders' losses.\n\nRemember when lawyers used to chase ambulances, not investors?\n\nLastly, Eastman Kodak's (EK) chief exec, George Fisher, indulged in a little spleen-venting by griping that his company's stock isn't getting enough respect from investors. \"We clearly believe we're severely undervalued in the marketplace,\" he said.\n\nUh-huh, the marketplace replied, knocking Kodak's share price down another $1.94 to $75.69. Whatever you say, George."
