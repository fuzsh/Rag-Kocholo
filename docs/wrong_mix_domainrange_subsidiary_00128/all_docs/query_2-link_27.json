        "text": "NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The bulk of earnings season may be over, but the market will still have quarterly financial reports in its sights from some big industrial and Internet names next week.\n\nInternet stocks always seem to weigh heavily on investors' minds and next week one of the most recognizable names, America Online (AOL), is expected Tuesday to report a profit of about 9 cents a share, according to analyst estimates compiled by First Call.\n\n\"AOL is one of the big three in Internet shares,\" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany.\n\n\"We have such speculation in Internet stocks already that it's earnings will be keenly watched and could stir up more speculation or spur a decline, depending on their results.\"\n\nAlmost every segment of technology stocks will be represented in the earnings picture as well, from Internet service provider Mindspring (MSPG), estimated to earn 14 cents per share, to service firm Electronic Data Systems (EDS), which is expected to post a profit of 36 cents per share. Networking company Ascend Communications is expected to report a profit of 36 cents per share.\n\nOnline bookseller Amazon.com (AMZN) is expected to show a loss of 29 cents per share.\n\nDow component IBM (IBM) stunned investors earlier in the week, soundly beating estimates and creating a generally ebullient mood for tech investors.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed Friday up 29.07 to 2590.68 while the Dow lost 37.51 to 10689.67.\n\nWall Street will also be looking to get a bearing on large-cap industrials as several Dow Jones industrial average components are set to give their quarterly earnings in the coming week.\n\nEntertainment company Walt Disney (DIS) will unveil its earnings picture on Thursday, and the Street has it penciled in for earnings of 34 cents per share. Additionally, chemical giant DuPont (DD) is predicted for earnings of 59 cents per share.\n\nBlue chip AT&T (T) will remain in the news next week. The company surprised the telecom community with a $58 billion bid for MediaOne this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, the phone giant will release its quarterly earnings report, estimated to be 57 cents per share. Long distance competitor MCI Worldcom (WCOM) will show up Thursday with its earnings, predicted at 34 cents per share.\n\nPeter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments, said telecoms will be closely watched in the coming weeks.\n\n\"Investors are thinking there are going to be other telecom deal announcements in the future,\" he said.\n\nCardillo sees a shift in focus in the technology sector in the near future. He said that ironically some of the big names in the field have lagged behind during technology's recent run-up.\n\nStalwarts such as Dell Computer (DELL), Intel (INTC) and even Microsoft (MSFT) are probably due for increased interest, he said.\n\nFirst Albany's Johnson said outside of the techs, investor attention may move from large caps -- and their high price to earnings ratios -- to smaller capitalization stocks.\n\n\"They are going to be looking back on the last two weeks and noticing the small caps have come back to life,\" said Johnson.\n\nBonds narrow-minded\n\nThe bond market will be looking for direction next week after finishing up an essentially meek week in which the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond traded in a narrow range.\n\nBond traders are looking forward and seeing little catalyst for change, according to Kathleen Gaffney, fixed income portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Co.\n\n\"While earnings are strong and commodity prices are firming, I think if you look at the big picture, there is a tremendous amount of excess capacity overseas and so the pressures are really in the long run for lower rates,\" said Gaffney.\n\nAn important economic figure for the bond market will be issued at the tail end of next week. The U.S. Commerce Department will release its first quarter Gross Domestic Product figure on Friday.\n\nAnalysts are expecting the Commerce Department to report the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.3 percent in the first quarter.\n\nInvestors will also keep an eye on the GDP's price deflator, a closely watched inflation indicator. However, with inflation seemingly tame, there is probably little trepidation about the figure.\n\n\"As long as there is no inflation, any strong numbers will have only a one-day effect,\" said Westfalia.\n\nIn addition to the GDP, other economic figures scheduled for release include existing home sales (March), consumer confidence (April) and durable goods orders (March.).\n\nG7 meeting in the background\n\nFinancial markets are likely to take note of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations meeting in Washington next week.\n\n\"It will be a sounding board for a lot of officials to make speeches but I'm not convinced that we're going to see a lot of direction for the market from those meetings,\" said CIBC World Markets economist David Coleman.\n\nHe said the U.S. will probably repeat its plea for Japan and Europe to do more to stimulate world growth.\n\n-- by staff writer Randall J.
