        "text": "Android’s sync settings allow you to control how often, if at all, your email and contact applications pull down data from the Internet. This can have cost benefits, especially if you are on a contract with a tight data allowance, as it reduces the amount of data consumed by your device. Fully un-syncing an account allows you to keep that account configured but only have its data pushed to the phone when you manually request it. This arrangement can be useful when using a work phone to run a personal account -- such as an AOL address -- that you only want to check outside of office hours.\n\n1.\n\nNavigate to the Home screen and then tap the “Settings” icon to open up the phone's configuration menu.\n\n2.\n\nSelect “Accounts” from the list, and then select your AOL account. Tap your account name on the following screen to open the account's sync options panel. This panel lists all the available services you can sync with your AOL account, such as mail, contacts and calendars.\n\n3.\n\nUncheck all the services listed in the panel to fully disable syncing for your AOL account.\n\nReferences\n\nTips\n\nTo remove your AOL account from your phone altogether, select the account from the “Accounts” list and then tap “Delete Account” on the following screen.\n\nWarnings\n\nInformation in this article applies to devices running Android Jelly Bean. It may vary slightly or significantly with other versions or products.\n\nWriter Bio\n\nAndy Walton has been a technology writer since 2009, specializing in networking and mobile communications. He was previously an IT technician and product manager. Walton is based in Leicester, England, and holds a bachelor's degree in information systems from the University of Leeds."
