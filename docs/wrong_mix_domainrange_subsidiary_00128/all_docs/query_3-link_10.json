        "text": "ZHONE TECHNOLOGIES IS NOT YOUR typical startup. In a year when the average first-round financing was $7 million, this five month-old firm raised $500 million right off the bat in October.\n\nZhone immediately bought publicly listed telecom gearmaker Premisys Communications for $240 million. A few weeks ago it began work on a 300,000-square-foot headquarters for 1,500 workers in Oakland, Calif. Mayor Jerry Brown swapped land in a deal that got the city 100,000 Zhone warrants. Brown declared the groundbreaking an auspicious excuse to drink in the morning.\n\nAuspicious indeed. The masterminds behind Zhone are Mory Ejabat, 49, and Jeanette Symons, 37, the duo who built Ascend Communications from scratch to $1.4 billion in sales in nine years, selling to Lucent for $24 billion last year. They claim to have a magic box, a variation of a telecommunications switch that can eliminate the bottleneck known as the Last Mile, that final stretch of cable, fiber or copper into homes.\n\nZhone's war chest is an unusual confluence of blue-blood capital: $55 million from venture stalwart New Enterprise Associates, $150 million each from buyout firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Texas Pacific Group, $50 million from others such as the California Public Employees' Retirement System. The rest came from Zhone's founders and board members such as MCI Worldcom Vice Chairman John Sidgmore and Dan Stanzione, former chief operating officer of Lucent.\n\nZhone's nanospeed bounty offers a glimpse of things to come. Not so long ago entrepreneurs would kowtow to venture capitalists for enough money to get a product launched and then beg for more to keep going. Now the question is, Why ask for $3 million when you can get $500 million? \"The hardest part of getting started was telling some investors they couldn't buy the whole company,\" says Ejabat, Zhone's chief executive.\n\nZhone is what KKR partner James Greene calls a \"build-up\": assemble the pieces, create value, sell it off. Adds Richard Kramlich, a New Enterprise Associates founder: \"The deal was structured so Zhone wouldn't spend its time fundraising but could fast carve out a market.\"\n\nEjabat figures he has enough cash for another big buy like Premisys and some smaller ones to fill in technologies that he lacks. If money gets tight (you never know), Ejabat can always go public.\n\nEjabat and Symons, his chief technical officer, are old hands at telecom equipment. Acting in the same roles at Ascend, they supplied Internet access-devices to data carriers such as PSINet and Uunet, now part of MCI Worldcom, before most people had heard of the Web. In 1997 they pounced on Cascade Communications, maker of telecom switches, at a beaten-down price of $3.7 billion.\n\nWhen Lucent bought Ascend, Ejabat walked away with close to $TKK million in company stock, most of which he has since sold. Symons got several hundred million dollars worth. She bought a nine-seater Citation Ultra, the fastest single-pilot jet on the market, which she pilots to ferry Zhonies around the U.S.\n\nThe technology premise: Carriers have spent billions of dollars installing mega-bandwidth optical networks to carry information long distances. Butthat short leg from the long-distance network to homes and offices is a contorted mish-mash of copper phone lines, TV cables, fiber and wireless systems. Zhone claims that its equipment, due in the next year, will be the first to handle voice, video and data on a single last-mile network, whatever its physical makeup. Such technology could reorder the telecom world in short order. At slight extra cost, Internet service providers could offer movies, upstart phone firms could sell Internet access and teleconferences and AT&T and AOL might face a new horde of rivals.\n\n\"The carriers who will end up on top aren't necessarily the most obvious ones,\" says Jeanette Symons. If Zhone helps make the winners, its backers will be richly rewarded. And the VCs will be out looking for the next $1 billion elephant."
