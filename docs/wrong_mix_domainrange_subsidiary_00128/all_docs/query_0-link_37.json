Specialties (2009) Online Advertising Internet Web WWW Websites Web Portal Homepages Blogs Streaming Content Provider SEO SEM ISP Narrowband\n\n7. Overview Background Management History Rise, Fall and Redemption Conclusion\n\n8. Before AOL Control Video Corporation (CVC) (1980s) Founded by Bill von Meister Gameline for the Atari 2600 video game console Subscribers bought a modem for $49.95 and paid a one-time $15 setup fee. Temporarily download games for $1 per game.\n\n9. Before AOL Quantum Computer Services (1983) CVC was near bankruptcy - Von Meister left the company. Jim Kimsey (a manufacturing consultant) became CEO Commodore 64 & 128 Quantum Link software was based on software licensed from PlayNet, Inc. In May 1988, Quantum and Apple launched AppleLink Personal Edition for Apple II and Macintosh computers.\n\n10. --> America Online America Online (1989) CEO Jim Kimsey until 1991: Steve Case AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with computers, in particular contrast to CompuServe, which had long served the technical community Special Features: Chat Room, Music, Mail, Community, Search, News\n\n11. Unique Features\n\n12. Overview Background Management History Rise, Fall and Redemption Conclusion\n\n13. AOL Subscribers [U.S. 2001-2009]\n\n14. Timeline 1991 AOL for DOS launched 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 1993 AOL for Windows launched 1996 AOL 3.0 for Windows 95 released 2001 AOL 6.0 for XP launched 2000 AOL and Time Warner plan to merge 2009 AOL and Time Warner plan to split 2004 AOL 9.0 for Vista Launched 2005 AOL (w/ Telepictures) launches TMZ.com\n\n15. Timeline 1991 AOL for DOS launched 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 1993 AOL for Windows launched 1996 AOL 3.0 for Windows 95 released 2001 AOL 6.0 for XP launched 2000 AOL and Time Warner plan to merge 2009 AOL and Time Warner plan to split 2004 AOL 9.0 for Vista Launched 2005 AOL (w/ Telepictures) launches TMZ.com\n\n16. Updated Versions Ever since the original AOL was released, there was a consistent release of newer versions The updates would create few changes - mainly in design - and not the user experience. AOL was relatively late in providing access to the open Internet. AOL has fallen from its peak of 30 million users to 10.1 million subscribers as of November 2007\n\n17. Timeline 1991 AOL for DOS launched 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 1993 AOL for Windows launched 1996 AOL 3.0 for Windows 95 released 2001 AOL 6.0 for XP launched 2000 AOL and Time Warner plan to merge 2009 AOL and Time Warner plan to split 2004 AOL 9.0 for Vista Launched 2005 AOL (w/ Telepictures) launches TMZ.com\n\n18. AOL-Time Warner Merger CEO: Gerald Levin, former CEO of Time Warner Chairman: Steve Case Followed by: Barry Schuler, Jonathan F. Miller (2002-2006), Randy Falco (2006-2009), Tim Armstrong (March 2009-present) Since its merger, the value of AOL has dropped significantly from its $240 billion high. Its subscriber base has seen no quarterly growth since 2002. The company failed to provide fast service while cutting costs and limiting access. Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL into a separate public company by the end of 2009.\n\n19. Controversial Practices The Company grew too fast and couldn’t provide appropriate services. Did not provide open internet access. Did not adapt to broadband Costs did not change to the new market Call center - Discourage customers from ending service; delaying the end of service [Bonuses] To cut costs, they outsourced their call centers\n\n20. Timeline 1991 AOL for DOS launched 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 1993 AOL for Windows launched 1996 AOL 3.0 for Windows 95 released 2001 AOL 6.0 for XP launched 2000 AOL and Time Warner plan to merge 2009 AOL and Time Warner plan to split 2004 AOL 9.0 for Vista Launched 2005 AOL (w/ Telepictures) launches TMZ.com\n\n21. Current Business Model AOL has since attempted to reposition itself as a content provider similar to companies such as Yahoo! as opposed to an Internet service provider. AOL, with Telepictures Productions, launched TMZ.com, one of the leading celebrity news and gossip sources on the web. TMZ.com has become known for its quickness to break celebrity news, often accompanied by exclusive videos and photos. AOL also prides itself on being an online advertiser and publisher resource to drive site revenue. AOL has planned to separate it’s content and internet provider divisions, possibly selling the internet side\n\n22. Overview Background Management History Rise, Fall and Redemption Conclusion"
