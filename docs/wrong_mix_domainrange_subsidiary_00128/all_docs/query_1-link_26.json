But these deals can be tricky to pull off — and failure can be catastrophic. In this piece, the author offers three tips to help business leaders avoid some of the most common pitfalls that can spoil an otherwise well-conceived merger or acquisition: First, make sure you’re buying the core underlying technology (and the full rights to it), not just the company licensing the technology. Second, communicate with all shareholders, not just those with a large stake. Finally, don’t underestimate the value of chemistry and culture. A successful M&A deal is no easy feat — but these three tips can keep you from making some of the most common errors.",
