At least statistically they do, with twice as many women joining the profession as men, according to the 1998 Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey. Given these figures, one would expect that women would hold the majority of senior management positions.\n\nWomen dominate men in PR. At least statistically they do, with\n\ntwice as many women joining the profession as men, according to the 1998\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey. Given these\n\nfigures, one would expect that women would hold the majority of senior\n\nmanagement positions.\n\nA quick look at the top US agencies by 1998 fee income tells a different\n\nstory. There are no female CEOs in the top 10 PR agencies. Admittedly\n\nthere are more in the next 10: Andy Cunningham of Cunningham\n\nCommunications; Melissa Waggener Zorkin of Waggener Edstrom, Marijean\n\nLauzier of The Weber Group. You’ll also find CEOs of practice groups:\n\nDiane Perlmutter of Cohn & Wolfe/New York and Rose Ann Anschuetz of Cohn\n\n& Wolf/Chicago.\n\nThe Os don’t have it\n\nBut generally, in the ’O’ class (CEOs, COOs and CFOs) women are woefully\n\nunder represented. Take a look at the structure of the top agencies. At\n\nFleishman-Hillard, men fill the top four slots. After that come the\n\nregional presidents. Two out of eight of these are female: Elizabeth\n\nSolberg in the Midwest and Janise Murph in the Southwest.\n\nKetchum has seven partners in its management team, two of whom are\n\nwomen: Lorraine Thelian, senior partner/US and Lori Kafafian,\n\npartner/global HR.\n\nAt Hill & Knowlton, women fare a little better. The chairman and CEO are\n\nmale, but two of the practice leaders are female - Shellie Winkler,\n\ndirector, global healthcare and pharmaceutical practice, and Jonelle\n\nBirney, president/CEO Blanc & Otus and head, H&K global technology\n\npractice. Maureen Blanc and Simone Otus serve as her co-directors.\n\nAdditionally, two of H&K’s five core service leaders are women: Julie\n\nJohnson, senior managing director/ director of the US media services\n\npractice and Pamela Fields, US director of marketing communications.\n\nBut of the agency’s nine general managers, only two are female: Sarah\n\nPeterson in Houston and the previously mentioned Birney at B&O.\n\nAt Burson-Marsteller, there are only two women on the worldwide\n\nleadership team: Celia Berk, managing director/HR and Barbara Smith,\n\nchief creative officer. Three out of nine of the US leadership team are\n\nwomen: Cynthia Hudson, practice chair/public affairs in Washington;\n\nBarbara Engel, managing director of HR/US and Leslie Gaines Ross, chief\n\nknowledge officer/US.\n\nWomen hold approximately half of BSMG’s senior management positions,\n\naccording to BSMG Worldwide president Jack Leslie, but only three have a\n\nvoice on the eight-person board: Barbara Molotsky, president of the\n\nagency’s Chicago office, managing partner Ranny Cooper and Sheri\n\nBenjamin, president of Benjamin BSMG.\n\nWomen make a reasonably good showing at Porter Novelli - although there\n\nis still nobody in the elusive ’O’ class - with five female EVPs:\n\nMerrill Rose, account practice and development; Helen Ostrowski, GM New\n\nYork; Katherine Bremner, GM Atlanta; Victoria Goldstein, GM Boca Raton\n\nand Barbara Parksky, GM Los Angeles. In fact, the female GMs outnumber\n\nthe male - men head only the DC, Chicago and San Francisco offices.\n\nSo why are there so many more men than women in top PR positions? ’It’s\n\nnot because opportunities don’t exist,’ says Chris Komisarjevsky,\n\nBurson’s (male) worldwide CEO. ’It’s 60 women to 40 men at the entry\n\nlevel. As you move higher into the organization, women decide there are\n\nother things they want to do and the proportions change. There are women\n\nstarting agencies, having families, deciding to make lifestyle\n\nchanges.’\n\nAndy Cunningham believes the absence of female leadership at\n\nlong-established agencies is due to the fact that men filled senior\n\npositions years ago.\n\nNewer agencies have been able to hire women from the start.\n\n’I don’t think there’s any intent or spirit not to include women,’ says\n\nCunningham. ’If you have a guy who’s been a successful leader for 10\n\nyears, and the guy after him has been in line for 10 years, too, the\n\nsuccession of leadership takes a long time.’\n\nIn addition, many agencies have lost their top women to\n\ncorporations.\n\nAt H&K, former New York general manager Mary Ann Keating was snatched up\n\nby Barnes & Noble. Donna Peterman, who headed its corporate practice,\n\nwent to Paine Webber. Kathryn Bushkin, head of the media practice, moved\n\non to AOL. The same thing has happened at GCI, where the former head of\n\nthe New York office, Valerie Di Maria, was lured away by GE Capital.\n\n’There are still people who don’t think a woman can do the job as well\n\nas a man, no question,’ says Di Maria, VP of corporate public relations\n\nand advertising at GE Capital. ’Women just have to go in and steamroll\n\nover them.’\n\nMarina Maher, president of Marina Maher Communications in New York,\n\nagrees.\n\n’I think there is a glass ceiling, but it’s cracked. In three to five\n\nyears, it will shatter.’\n\nEarly stumbling blocks\n\nMost of the women in PRWeek’s survey say they haven’t felt discriminated\n\nagainst. But these are women who have succeeded. They hold major\n\npositions at agencies and corporations. They have served as press\n\nsecretaries to key political figures. They have started their own\n\nsuccessful agencies, overseen crisis communications operations and led\n\ncompanies through M&As and IPOs. However, a few have stories about\n\nstumbling blocks they faced early in their careers.\n\n’The market for women has changed significantly from the 1960s,’ says\n\nSheila Tate, president, Powell Tate. ’I was the first female AE in\n\nBurson’s Pittsburgh office in 1966. They were nervous about hiring me,\n\nand they had to clear it with the client.’\n\nH&K’s Birney admits she spent the first three years of her career trying\n\nto break out of being a secretary.\n\nMany women cite Carly Fiorina’s recent appointment as president and CEO\n\nof Hewlett-Packard as an indication that the tide is turning,\n\nparticularly since she was once president of corporate relations at\n\nAT&T.\n\nAnd while women may not be in the top slots at the big agencies right\n\nnow, Weber Group president and CEO Marijean Lauzier says that will\n\nchange.\n\n’In the top 20, there’s a second tier of senior management who have\n\ngrown up in the past decade to become terrific crafts people, strong\n\nbusiness leaders and deeply experienced managers in key leadership\n\nroles,’ she says.\n\nThis is true of agencies such as Fleishman-Hillard, which has several\n\nfemale regional presidents waiting in the wings, including Elizabeth\n\nSolberg and Janise Murphy. Ogilvy PR also has Marcia Silverman as\n\npresident of the agency’s DC office and Nancy Rueth as managing director\n\nof the New York office.\n\nDemand outweighs supply\n\nAccording to Rueth, there are now more opportunities for women to get\n\nahead in PR, as the demand for talented professionals outweighs the pool\n\nof people qualified to fill those slots.\n\n’In another 10 years you’ll see more and more women, and Burson and Hill\n\n& Knowlton will be headed by women,’ predicts Tate. ’Washington is a\n\ngood example of the enormous progress being made. A lot of public\n\naffairs offices are headed by women, and strong positions on the Hill\n\nare headed by women.’\n\nOn the agency side, many women who achieved senior management levels\n\nhave founded their own firms. Alongside Tate, Cunningham and Maher,\n\nother examples are Melissa Waggener Zorkin of Waggener Edstrom, Maura\n\nFitzGerald of FitzGerald Communications, Lois Paul of Lois Paul &\n\nPartners and Carol Cone of Cone.\n\nMany female PR entrepreneurs have become leaders at larger firms due to\n\nM&As. The list includes Susan Thomas of Ketchum Thomas, Lauzier of Neva\n\nGroup (now part of The Weber Group), Pam Alexander of Alexander Ogilvy,\n\nSheri Benjamin of Benjamin BSMG and Blanc & Otus partners Maureen Blanc\n\nand Simone Otus, whose agency is now part of Hill & Knowlton.\n\n’What a lot of large agencies look for is a demonstrated ability to\n\nbuild an organization in a fast-paced, high-growth environment,’ says\n\nThomas, president of Silicon Valley firm Ketchum Thomas. When Thomas\n\nAssociates was acquired by Ketchum two years ago, she retained her title\n\nas president and also became a partner and director of Ketchum’s global\n\ntechnology practice.\n\nWomen have been particularly successful in the hi-tech sector. Our top\n\n50 includes representatives from consumer marketing, cause-related\n\nmarketing and other sectors. But the list is dominated by hi-tech,\n\ntaking up more than 20% of the slots. Several well-known names,\n\nincluding Maureen Blanc and Simone Otus, Helen Vollmer, Susan Butenhoff\n\nand Paula Mae Schwartz, narrowly missed the cut, partly for reasons of\n\nbalance. Nevertheless, sectors like healthcare and crisis communications\n\nremain disappointingly underrepresented in our top 50.\n\nHi-tech success\n\nAndy Cunningham attributes the prominence of women in hi-tech to the\n\nopen-mindedness of Silicon Valley, where she opened her office in\n\n1985.\n\n’It’s one place where there wasn’t a glass ceiling, which I think is\n\nvery reflective of the whole attitude of Silicon Valley,’ says\n\nCunningham. ’Race and age has never mattered here - you could be gay,\n\nstraight, male, female, barefoot. It’s a place where women could grow\n\nand become something.’\n\nYet, despite the abundance of technology corporations which seem to\n\nfavor women - and the increasing importance placed on PR as a strategic\n\nfunction - there is still an absence of women leaders on the corporate\n\nside. Only 16 (32%) of our top 50 are from corporations.\n\nSusan Thomas believes this is partly a function of the way corporations\n\nare structured. ’I think the more male-dominated corporations lag behind\n\nagencies in giving women the top spot,’ she says. ’And a number of\n\ntechnology companies are slow to create VP level positions in\n\ncommunications.’\n\nWomen who work inside corporate communications departments disagree that\n\nthey are out-ranked by men, however. ’Females are over-represented,’\n\nsays Roberta Bowman, VP of public affairs/chief communications officer\n\nfor Duke Energy in Charlotte, NC, where women comprise two-thirds of the\n\n20-person in-house team. ’Public relations is an area where corporations\n\ncan add balance in diversity.’\n\nHowever, Andy Cunningham cautions against corporations filling positions\n\nwith women just to diversify the workplace. ’One of the worst things is\n\nhaving a woman in a spot she can’t handle - it sets the women’s movement\n\nback. I hope that when people put women in management ranks, as they\n\nshould do, there will be the same bar for men and women.’\n\nRebecca Madeira, SVP of public affairs for PepsiCo in Purchase, NY,\n\nholds the most senior PR position within the company and says she has\n\nnever experienced discrimination. She says that being female is\n\nsometimes an advantage.\n\nGE Capital’s Di Maria agrees. ’Sometimes men who have a reputation for\n\nbeing very tough to work for are nicer to you if you are a woman,’ says\n\nDi Maria. ’It’s probably chauvinistic, but it works in our favor.’\n\nWhile women within agencies have a much better shot at becoming a CEO\n\nthan women on the corporate side, Duke Energy’s Bowman says it can\n\nhappen.\n\n’We have been a very successful feeder organization for Duke Energy, and\n\nin the past one or two years people have been able to enter more\n\ndirectly the lines of business,’ she says. ’The challenge is\n\ntransferring the soft skills of PR into the hard skills of\n\nbusiness.’\n\nLauzier believes the status of female PR people in corporations depends\n\non the importance placed on PR as a function.\n\n’In a client organization that values PR, those individuals are seen as\n\nmore of the inner circle,’ says Lauzier. ’Mich Mathews of Microsoft is\n\nclearly a strategic part of the leadership team. In other organizations\n\nthat value PR in a less strategic function, it’s clearly more difficult\n\nfor women or men to be seen as leaders.’\n\nEven in areas that have traditionally been dominated by men, women are\n\nmaking inroads. ’There is absolutely no stigma here about gender,’ says\n\nKate Rohrbach, SVP of corporate communications for Charles Schwab, which\n\nshe says is unique in the financial services industry.\n\nWomen are also succeeding in creative fields such as the film\n\nindustry.\n\n’For whatever reason, publicists tend to be predominantly female,’ says\n\nMarcy Granata, president of publicity and corporate communications for\n\nMiramax Films in New York. She says the industry is more open to giving\n\nyounger employees responsibility. She credits powerful women such as PMK\n\nfounder Pat Kingsley as having paved the way for female publicists.\n\nOf course there are a number of other reasons why the glass ceiling may\n\nstill exist. Of the women PRWeek spoke with, roughly half are combining\n\ncareers with families and children.\n\n’Corporate America, until very recently, hasn’t been sensitive to the\n\nneeds of women, who retain the bulk of home responsibilities,’ says\n\nThomas, who has a child.\n\nAndy Cunningham didn’t even take maternity leave after giving birth to\n\nher two children. ’When you own your own company, you can’t do it,’ she\n\nsays.\n\nLooking for latitude\n\nAnother issue may be that when focusing on the chemistry between agency\n\nand client, gender biases in corporations may be mirrored by\n\nagencies.\n\nOne PR pro says agencies often present clients with the gender they\n\nthink will work best. And with more men than women involved in issues\n\nmanagement, public affairs and investor relations, larger assignments in\n\nthose fields often go to men, helping them move up the ladder.\n\nSo how can a woman rise to the top? Those who have succeeded recommend\n\npaying less attention to job title and more to finding a job that\n\nprovides latitude and freedom. Select employers who recognize the\n\ncontributions of women and don’t let others define your boundaries.\n\n’Be patient,’ advises PepsiCo’s Madeira. ’Today, there’s so much talent\n\nand so many industries, it’s important to get multiple experiences early\n\non. Get to know the business, the issues and the people in it. Be a good\n\nsounding board when needed and a good barometer of public opinion when\n\ncalled for.’\n\nTate adds: ’The only way to get ahead is to earn it, and it clears the\n\nway for the next generation to earn it. You can sit and whine about it\n\nor you can just do it.’\n\n- Additional research by Fal Mehta. The PRWeek Top 50 Most Powerful\n\nWomen in PR was chosen by a panel which included representatives from\n\nthe agency and corporate side, from two industry trade associations, a\n\nleading recruitment consultant and PRWeek.
