        "text": "Screenings at the Cinémathèque française on Saturdays an Sunday in July.\n\nSaturdays with French intertitles, Sundays with English subtitles.\n\n> Détails, schedules and tickets\n\n---\n\nAfter 16 years in the making, presentation of the first part (3h40) of Abel Gance's Napoleonic epic (from Brienne to the siege of Toulon).\n\nNapoleon by Abel Gance has never been shown to the public in its original version, known as the “Grande Version”, since 1927!\n\nSeveral technical and aesthetic innovations, such as horse-mounted cameras and the famous triptych ending (polyvision), on three screens simultaneously, foreshadowing today's immersive cinemas, make Napoléon by Abel Gance a revolutionary and avant-garde film. With its grandiose cast and thousands of extras, the film shocked audiences and critics alike when it premiered at the Paris Opera on April 7, 1927, in the presence of French President Gaston Doumergue and Marshals Foch and Joffre. This marked the start of his career in France and around the world.\n\nDespite this triumphant reception, success was short-lived, largely due to the rise of talking pictures. Forgotten for years, the reels of this unique and prolific work were scattered across the globe, some lost or destroyed. The film has been reedited and mutilated many times over: to date, over 22 different versions have been recorded.\n\nThe epic story of Napoleon, its production, exploitation, preservation, restoration and reconstruction is one of the most complex in the history of cinema, transforming this work into a veritable “legend”.\n\nVarious sources were used to reconstruct the film. Reels were found at la Cinémathèque française, the CNC, la Cinémathèque de Toulouse and la Cinémathèque de Corse, as well as in Denmark, Serbia, Italy, Luxembourg and New York... Abel Gance's editing notes and exchanges with his editor, found at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the real “Pierre de Rosette” of the project, have enabled the film to be reassembled in its “Grande Version”.\n\nUnder the direction of director and researcher Georges Mourier for la Cinémathèque Française, Napoléon was researched, appraised, reconstructed and restored worldwide. Over 100 kilometers of film were appraised. Nearly half a million images were finally selected and processed one by one, according to an operating procedure specially developed for the “Napoleon case”. To preserve the “soul and substance of the film”, the restoration involved specific chemical and digital processes, as well as very high-definition scans using the world's only Nitroscan from the ÉCLAIR Classics laboratory.\n\nThe longest soundtrack in the history of cinema, recorded by the musical ensembles of Radio France.\n\nAlthough a silent film, Gance's Napoléon remains a musical. Swiss composer Arthur Honegger created an original score for the first performance at the Paris Opéra. It was based, on the one hand, on an assembly of pieces from the great classical repertoire (notably Haydn, Mozart, Berlioz and Beethoven) and, on the other, on the creation of an original score by Honegger lasting around 30 minutes. But neither the composer nor the filmmaker were satisfied with the final result. Honegger's music was not used for the presentation at the Apollo Theatre, and thereafter there was no longer a single reference score to accompany Napoleon, but a succession of more or less successful attempts.\n\nIt was therefore necessary to envisage a new musical accompaniment for this restoration, in the spirit of Gance/Honegger, based mainly on the editing of pre-existing music from the repertoire. It was therefore necessary to call on a contemporary composer to create this montage and write the “links” that would unify the pieces into a continuous musical flow.\n\nSimon Cloquet-Lafollye, an experienced composer of music for the screen (cinema and television), was chosen to compose this new score. This 1500-page score, one of the longest and most complex soundtracks in the history of cinema, was brought to life by Radio France, thanks to the talent and complementarity of its musical ensembles and the sound recording expertise of its technicians.\n\nUnder the direction of conductor Fabien Gabel, the prologue and first part of the film were recorded by the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France and the Choeur de Radio France. The second part was recorded by the Orchestre National de France.\n\nBetween summer 2022 and early 2024, 250 musicians, 25 days of recording at the Maison de la Radio et de la Musique and over 1,000 hours of editing and mixing were required to set this masterpiece to music.\n\nA colossal reconstruction\n\nSince 2008, la Cinémathèque française, with the initial and unfailing support of the Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée (CNC), has been carrying out this long-term reconstruction of Napoléon by Abel Gance."
