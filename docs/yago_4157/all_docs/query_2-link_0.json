        "text": "American Science Fiction film directed by John Hayes\n\nEnd of the WorldDirected byJohn HayesWritten byFrank Ray PerilliProduced byCharles Band\n\nRichard BandStarringChristopher Lee\n\nSue LyonCinematographyJohn HuneckEdited byJohn HayesMusic byAndrew BellingDistributed byCharles Band Productions\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n88 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglish\n\nEnd of the World is a 1977 American science fiction film directed by John Hayes.[1]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nNASA Professor Andrew Boran is a research scientist who discovers strange radio signals in outer space that appear to originate from Earth. The signals seem to predict natural disasters that are occurring around the globe.\n\nWhen he and his wife Sylvia decide to investigate the source of the signals, they end up being held captive in a convent that has been infiltrated by aliens. These invaders, from the planet Utopia, plan to destroy the world with the natural disasters. They have replicated the original inhabitants of the convent and now pose as the Father and the nuns.\n\nWhile posing as the human Father Pergado, the alien leader Zindar explains Earth is a hotbed of disease that cannot be permitted to continue polluting the galaxy.\n\nBoran and Sylvia decide in the end not to stop the destruction of Earth and instead return to Utopia with Zindar. To make the return safely, Zindar holds Sylvia hostage and demands that Boran steal a Variance Crystal from the lab so that they can escape the destruction of Earth.[2] Earth then explodes.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nChristopher Lee as Father Pergado / Zindar\n\nSue Lyon as Sylvia Boran\n\nKirk Scott as Professor Andrew Boran\n\nDean Jagger as Ray Collins\n\nLew Ayres as Commander Joseph Beckerman\n\nMacdonald Carey as John Davis\n\nLiz Ross as Sister Patrizia\n\nJon van Ness as Mr. Sanchez\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCreature Feature found it to be cheap and plodding, giving it 1.5 out of 5 stars.[3] TV Guide gave the movie 1 of 5 stars. Moria found the movie dull and legendarily bad, only worth viewing to see the early work of Charles Band,[4] and gave the movie 1/2 of a star. It further said Lee gave a very good performance, much better than the movie deserved.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe movie was produced by Z movie impresario Charles Band.[4] Lee claimed subsequently that the producers misled him about the cast in order to secure his participation:\n\nI was told quite categorically by the producer that they had Arthur Kennedy, Richard Basehart, José Ferrer, John Carradine--I was told categorically that these people were signed to do this film. All fine actors. That was totally untrue.\n\n— Christopher Lee, The films of Christopher Lee, [5]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nReleased on DVD in 2005.[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
