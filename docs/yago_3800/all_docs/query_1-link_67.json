        "text": "On Friday 17 July, Princess Beatrice and property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi were married at All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park, surrounded by loved ones.\n\nThe Queen was in attendance at the secret ceremony, in addition to the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Beatrice’s parents Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York, all of whom adhered to strict social distancing guidelines, the Palace said.\n\nThe couple were originally supposed to wed in May, but the wedding reception was cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMr Mapelli Mozzi proposed to Beatrice in September when the couple travelled to Italy for a weekend break.\n\nFollowing the news of their engagement, the couple released a statement through Buckingham Palace, which read: “We are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement.\n\n“We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can’t wait to be married.\n\n“We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness.”\n\nBut, who is exactly is the royal’s new husband? Here’s everything you need to know.\n\nEdoardo Mapelli Mozzi is a 34-year-old an Italian businessman.\n\nMozzi was educated at Radley in Oxfordshire before studying for a Master’s in politics at Edinburgh.\n\nWhile the entrepreneur has now been officially welcomed into the royal family, it seems he already has Italian blue blood.\n\nHis father is Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi, who descends from Italian artistocracy and represented Britain as a skier at the 1972 Winter Olympics.\n\nHis mother, Nicola “Nikki” Shale, is from Oxfordshire and later remarried the late Christopher Shale, a conservative MP who died of natural causes at the Glastonbury Music Festival in 2011.\n\nNikki received a prestigious MBE award (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) in 2016.\n\nMozzi is multi-millionare who has made his money in property development.\n\nThe 34-year-old is the founder and CEO of a property development agency and interior design company called Banda, specialising in finding and creating exceptional homes.\n\nThe company was founded in 2007 and the Banda’s website describes Mozzi as “one of the most sought after developers in London”.\n\nMozzi also is the founder of a charity called Cricket Builds Hope, teaches the sport in Rwanda.\n\nIt aims to promote reconciliation and tackle gender inequality, and has created partnerships with other groups focused around female empowerment.\n\nMozzi has a child from a previous relationship – a two-year-old son called Wolfie.\n\nThe couple reportedly met in September 2018, about a month before Beatrice’s sister, Princess Eugenie, got married to Jack Brooksbank on 12 October.\n\nHowever, they have kept their relationship relatively low-key, making their first public appearance as a couple at the Portrait Gala New York in March 2019.\n\nThe pair also attended Lady Gabriella Windsor’s wedding together in May.\n\nEdoardo does have an Instagram and goes by the handle @edomapellimozzi, calling himself ‘”Edo”.\n\nWhile Mozzi doesn’t post many photographs of himself and Princess Beatrice together on his account, he did mark their engagement with a black-and-white image of the pair embracing alongside the caption: “You will never be alone my love, my heart is your home. Hand in hand, today, tomorrow and forever.”"
