        "text": "On 25 August 1942, Prince George, Duke of Kent, son of King George V and Queen Mary, died in a military air crash at the age of 39. It brought a tragically early end to the life of a beloved son, brother, father and husband.\n\nPrince George, Duke of Kent married Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent, formerly Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, in 1934. The princess would appear on the cover of The Tatler – as it was then known – in her white and silver brocade designed by Captain Edward Molyneux. Now, all these years later, her descendant through marriage, Lady Frederick Windsor adorns the cover of the February 2023 issue, in much the same way.\n\nOn 20 December, in 1902, George was born at York Cottage, Sandringham, the fourth son of the then Prince and Princess of Wales. His father George was the only surviving son of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra; his mother Mary was daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck. King George V and Queen Mary had six children together including Prince John, who died at just 13 years old.\n\nAt the time of his birth, Prince George was fifth in line to the throne behind his father and three older brothers: Edward (the future King Edward VIII and Duke of Kent), Albert (King George VI, father of Queen Elizabeth II) and Henry, Duke of Gloucester. George was baptised at Windsor Castle in January 1903 and his godparents reflect the close bonds between the British royals and their European cousins: Prince Valdemar of Denmark, Prince Louis of Battenberg, Empress Dowager Maria Feodorovna and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nPrince George attended a prep school in Broadstairs, Kent, before following in the footsteps of his brothers Edward and Albert and enrolling at naval college at Osborne then Dartmouth. George was only eight years old when his father was crowned King George V. Following training, Prince George served in the Royal Navy until March 1929 then held positions at the Foreign Office and Home Office, becoming the first member of the Royal Family to work as a civil servant.\n\nAhead of his wedding to his second cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, in November 1934, Prince George was created Duke of Kent, Earl of St Andrews, and Baron Downpatrick. These titles continue to be used by his descendants today. George and Marina were married at Westminster Abbey on 29 November, with a second Greek Orthodox ceremony later held at the private chapel at Buckingham Palace. The couple had three children: Prince Edward, later Duke of Kent (husband of the popular Duchess of Kent), Princess Alexandra, the Hon Lady Ogilvy, and Prince Michael of Kent. The Duke of Kent and Princess Alexandra, the Hon Lady Ogilvy, remain working royals during the reign of King Charles III.\n\nThere were rumours of infidelity, including an affair with Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll and the socialite Alice ‘Kiki’ Preston, a cousin of American heiress Gloria Vanderbilt. In 1936, George was appointed a personal aide-de-camp to his eldest brother, the new King Edward VIII. When Edward abdicated less than a year later, George was made a personal naval aide-de-camp to their brother King George VI.\n\nHis great passion was aviation. He earned his pilot’s licence in 1929 and in 1937 was granted a commission in the Royal Air Force as a group captain. In 1939, at the start of the Second World War, George returned to active service in the Royal Navy but transferred to the RAF the following year.\n\nOn 25 August 1942, Prince George, Duke of Kent and 14 others crashed near Caithness, Scotland, while flying from Invergordon to Iceland on non-operational duties. Only one person survived the crash. It marked the first time in more than 450 years that a member of the Royal Family had died on active service.\n\nThe February 2024 issue of Tatler, starring Lady Frederick Windsor on the cover, is on sale Thursday 4 January"
