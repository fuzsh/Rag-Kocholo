        "text": "Princess Beatrice, Mrs Mapelli Mozzi (Beatrice Elizabeth Mary; born August 8, 1988) is a member of the British royal family. She is the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Sarah, Duchess of York. She is 9th in Line to the British throne.\n\nShe has an younger sister Princess Eugenie (b.1990)\n\nIn 2020, she married Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi was made Mrs Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. They have a daughter Sienna Mapelli Mozzi (b.2021).\n\nUpon the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the accession of King Charles III, Princess Beatrice became a Counsellor of State, a senior position within the royal family limited to the first four in the line of succession over the age of 21 and the sovereign's consort.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nPrincess Beatrice was born on August 8, 1988 at the Portland Hospital, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York. She was baptised in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace on 20 December 1988, her godparents being Viscount Linley (her father's cousin, now the 2nd Earl of Snowdon); the Duchess of Roxburghe (now Lady Jane Dawnay); Peter Palumbo; Gabrielle Greenall; and Carolyn Cotterell. Her name, an unexpected choice, was not announced until almost two weeks after her birth.\n\nBeatrice's parents divorced amicably when she was seven years old. The Duke and Duchess of York had agreed to joint custody of their two children. After the divorce, the Queen provided her parents with Â£1.4 million to set up a trust fund for her and Eugenie. Beatrice and her sister frequently travelled abroad with one or both of their parents\n\nEducation[]\n\nBeatrice began her early education at the independent Upton House School in Windsor, in 1991. From there, she and her sister both attended the independent Coworth Park School (now Coworth Flexlands School) from 1995. Beatrice continued her education at the independent St George's School in Ascot, where she was a pupil from 2000 to 2007.\n\nShe was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of seven and went public with the diagnosis in 2005. She delayed sitting her GCSE exams for one year. She remained at St George's to take her A-Levels, earning an 'A' in drama, a 'B' in history, and a 'B' in film studies. She was elected Head Girl in her final year, and was a member of the school choir. Beatrice celebrated her 18th birthday with a masked ball at Windsor Castle in July 2006. Nikolai von Bismarck took her official birthday portrait.\n\nIn September 2008, Beatrice started a three-year course studying for a BA in history and history of ideas at Goldsmiths, University of London. She graduated in 2011 with a 2:1 degree\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nMarriage[]\n\nIn March 2019, Beatrice attended a fundraising event at the National Portrait Gallery, London, accompanied by property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the son of Alex Mapelli-Mozzi, a former British Olympian and descendant of the Italian nobility; the BBC describes Edoardo as \"also a count\", like his father; however, that title is not officially recognised in Italy or the UK. The couple are believed to have begun dating in September 2018. Together, they attended the wedding of Lady Gabriella Windsor, Beatrice's second cousin once removed.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Mozzi became engaged in Italy in September 2019, with their engagement formally announced by the Duke of York's Office on 26 September.\n\nThe wedding was scheduled to take place on 29 May 2020 at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace, followed by a private reception in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, but first the reception and then the wedding itself were postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The wedding was eventually held in private on 17 July 2020, at the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Royal Lodge, Windsor, and was not publicly announced in advance. Beatrice's father walked her down the aisle. Her wedding dress was a remodelled Norman Hartnell dress that was lent by the Queen, and she wore the Queen Mary Fringe Tiara that was also worn by the Queen at her own wedding.\n\nChildren[]\n\nPrincess Beatrice has a stepson, Christopher Woolf (born 2016), her husband's child from a relationship with architect Dara Huang. She gave birth to a daughter, Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi, on 18 September 2021 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Chelsea, London. With the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022, the child became tenth in line to the throne.\n\nTitles and succession[]\n\nAugust 8, 1988 - July 17, 2020: Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York\n\nJuly 17, 2020 - present: Princess Beatrice, Mrs. Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\n\nAs a male-line grandchild of the sovereign, Beatrice was known as \"Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York\", at birth, with the territorial designation coming from her father's title, Duke of York.
