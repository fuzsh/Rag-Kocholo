        "text": "When it comes to royal weddings, most of the time the lavish affairs often dominate headlines as part of a public spectacle enjoyed around the world. Yet one couple that flouted that tradition when they tied the knot back in 2020, are Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, as the pair had a comparatively low key affair compared to their royal cousins.\n\nSo much so, that despite stunning wedding photos having emerged at the time, now, even four years later, several key details about the wedding still remain a mystery, and doting husband Edorado recently lifted the lid on one particular detail, to mark the couple’s fourth anniversary.\n\nPosting on July 17, the 40 year old property developer took to social media to wish his wife a happy anniversary and in the process shared a never before seen photograph from the big day, which showed the couple holding hands and kissing beneath a canopy of trees.\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Beatrice's wedding tiara caused serious panic for late Queen after disaster\n\nIn the snap, Beatrice dazzled in one of Queen Elizabeth’s own vintage gowns, an ivory Peau de Soie taffeta dress by Norman Hartnell, which she teamed with the very same glittering tiara worn by her grandmother on her own big day. Yet crucially the new photo also showed for the first time, which veil the Princess had elected to wear.\n\nAs seen on Instagram, the blushing bride accessorised her gown with a plain white waltz-length veil with fingertip-length layers, and finally showed the full bridal outfit to royal fashion fans, who were delighted by the behind-the-scenes news.\n\nThe surprising development added further detail to Beatrice’s wedding outfit, which previously went on display at Windsor Castle in the Autumn of 2020. Yet while her dress, bouquet and shoes had been part of the exhibition, up until now her veil had been a complete mystery.\n\nThe unexpected omission came as quite the surprise at the time, as both Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle’s own wedding dresses had previously gone on display at the royal palace, complete with their veils.\n\nBeatrice’s sister Princess Eugenie meanwhile opted to forgo the traditional garment altogether when she tied the knot with Jack Brooksbank in 2018, instead opting to go with an open back design that proudly showed off her scoliosis scar in a bid to “help smash taboos.”\n\nIn addition to the photo showing off Princess Beatrice’s veil, Edo also shared a second snap of the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge in Windsor, the very same location the pair had officially said “I do” .\n\nAlongside the post, the smitten businessman sweetly wrote: \"Happy 4th wedding anniversary my love. Every day is so special with you. I love you so much. \""
