        "text": "Princess Beatrice is married! After an extended engagement due to the coronavirus outbreak, Princess Beatrice of York wed Edoardo \"Edo\" Mapelli Mozzi in an intimate ceremony with 20 of their closest family and friends, including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip. Buckingham Palace released a statement to confirm the news:\n\n\"The private wedding ceremony of Princess Beatrice and Mr. Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi took place at 11 a.m. on Friday 17th July at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor. The small ceremony was attended by The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh and close family. The wedding took place in accordance with all relevant Government Guidelines.\"\n\nThe couple, who announced their engagement in September of last year, originally planned to tie the knot on May 29 in a \"low-key affair\" at St. James's Palace in London with a reception to follow at the Queen's gardens at Buckingham Palace. The ongoing health crisis, however, halted their event plans, ultimately leading them to announce in mid-April that they were postponing their wedding.\n\nBecause they have kept their relationship fairly private over the years, Edoardo still remains a mystery to many. So, here's everything you need to know about the new addition to the royal family:\n\nHe comes from British blue blood himself.\n\nHis father, Count Alessandro \"Alex\" Mapelli Mozzi, allegedly descended from Italian aristocracy, according to some peerage blogs. But Alex repped the Union Jack when he competed in the 1972 Olympics for Britain as an alpine skier. His mother, Nicola \"Nikki\" Shale, is from Oxfordshire and later remarried the late Christopher Shale, a high-ranking Tory who died of natural causes at the Glastonbury music festival in 2011. Nikki received a prestigious MBE award (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) in 2016.\n\nHe's known Princess Beatrice and the royal family for a long time.\n\nEdoardo's stepfather counted former Prime Minister David Cameron among his close friends, as well as Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Therefore it's likely Beatrice previously met Edoardo many years ago, as she attended Christopher Shale's funeral with her family.\n\nThe pair reportedly reconnected in the fall of 2018 and started their romantic relationship. (The princess split from her boyfriend of 10 years, Dave Clark, in 2016.)\n\nHe has a 4-year-old son.\n\nChristopher \"Wolfie\" Woolf is the child of Edoardo and his former fiancée, architect Dara Huang, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nHis net worth is estimated to be in the multi-million range.\n\nEdoardo founded the luxury real estate development company Banda in 2007 and remains its CEO. According to its website, the company's \"bespoke search and development service is meticulously tailored to the individual needs of our clients.\""
