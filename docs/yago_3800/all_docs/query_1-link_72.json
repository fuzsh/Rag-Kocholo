        "text": "Princess Beatrice and her boyfriend, businessman Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, tied the knot today in a secret ceremony in front of the Queen and Prince Andrew, according to reports. Prince Andrew and Prince Philip also attended the service, along with about 20 other guests after Coronavirus wedding restrictions dampened dreams of a big ceremony.\n\nThe pair, who got engaged in September 2109, were due to be married on May 29th but the pandemic put a stop to their nuptials.\n\nPrincess Beatrice's wedding was due to take place at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace and her father, Prince Andrew, was due to give her away, the Royal Family confirmed at the time.\n\nThe Royal Family's statement, released on Instagram, read: \"The wedding of HRH Princess Beatrice of York and Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi will take place on Friday 29th May 2020. The couple became engaged in Italy in September 2019.\n\n\"Her Majesty The Queen has kindly given permission for the ceremony to take place at The Chapel Royal, St James‚Äôs Palace.\n\n\"The ceremony will be followed by a private reception, given by The Queen, in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.\"\n\nIt was due to be the first wedding to take place in the venue since Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge's marriage in 2011.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAt the time of their engagement, Beatrice's younger sister, Eugenie, took to Instagram to share a snap of the couple (which she took herself!) congratulating them. She wrote: \"Beabea - wow! I'm so happy for you my dearest big sissy and dear Edo. It's been a long time coming and you two are meant to be. üì∑ by me!! ‚ÄúWe are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement. We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can‚Äôt wait to actually be married. We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness.‚Äù\n\nBea's mother, Sarah Ferguson, also took to Twitter to share the happy news, writing: \"Eugenie took the colour photographs as my girls are so close. The black and white photographs were taken by Misan Harriman at Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park.\"\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWhilst we don't know too much about Bea's boyfriend, Edoardo and Beatrice made their first public appearance at the National Portrait Gallery's 2019 Gala and then were seen holding hands in New York before joining Bea's mother, Sarah Ferguson, at the Bahrain Grand Prix. Then, the duo arrived together to Ella Windsor's wedding to Thomas Kingston at St. George's Chapel in Windsor.\n\nSo who is the newest member of the royal family? Edoardo's stepfather was Christopher Shale, who was a British political operative and close friend of former PM, David Cameron. Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson were both close friends of Christopher and attended his funeral alongside Bea.\n\nEdoardo also has strong humanitarian roots and founded Cricket Builds Hope (CBH), an organisation teaching Rwandans to play cricket, which seemingly makes him the perfect match for Bea, who is passionate about a plethora of charitable causes.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with more details as and when we hear them. Congrats, Bea and Edoardo!"
