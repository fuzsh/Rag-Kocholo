        "text": "by Susan Flantzer © Unofficial Royalty 2019\n\nPrincess Beatrice of the United Kingdom and Prince Henry of Battenberg were married on July 23, 1885, at Saint Mildred’s Church in Whippingham, Isle of Wight, England.\n\nBeatrice’s Early Life\n\nPrincess Beatrice was born on April 14, 1857, at Buckingham Palace in London, England. She was the youngest of the nine children of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. On December 14, 1861, Prince Albert died at the age of 42. Beatrice was only four and a half and had lost one of her principal role models. Queen Victoria was grief-stricken. The night Prince Albert died, Queen Victoria went into the nursery and carried the sleeping Beatrice to her own bed, where she lay unable to sleep, hugging Beatrice while wrapped in the bedclothes of her deceased husband. Because of her mother’s prolonged grief and mourning, Beatrice’s life would forever be shaped by her father’s death. She became a great solace to her mother, and as the years progressed Queen Victoria hoped that Beatrice would always be her constant companion.\n\nDespite her father’s death, Beatrice’s education proceeded according to the plan Prince Albert had devised for all his children. She received lessons in French and German and received a hands-on history education by visiting historical sites. Unlike her mother, Beatrice eventually had clear and legible handwriting and was an accurate speller. By the age of fifteen, Beatrice was writing letters on behalf of Queen Victoria and she was developing into the quiet, attentive, and devoted helper the Queen wanted. When the last of her sisters married and left home, Beatrice took on the job of being her mother’s full-time personal assistant.\n\nTo learn more about Beatrice, see Unofficial Royalty: Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom, Princess Henry of Battenberg\n\nHenry’s Early Life\n\nPrince Henry (Heinrich) of Battenberg was born on October 5, 1858 in Milan, Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, now in Italy. Henry (nicknamed Liko) was the fourth of the five children and the third of the four sons of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Countess Julia Hauke. As his parents’ marriage was morganatic, Henry and his siblings took their titles from their mother, who had been created Countess of Battenberg and was later elevated to Princess of Battenberg in 1858.\n\nHenry received a military education and was commissioned a lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of the Rhenish Hussars of the Prussian Army. He also served in the Gardes du Corps, the personal bodyguard of the King of Prussia and, after 1871, of the German Emperor.\n\nTo learn more about Henry, see Unofficial Royalty: Prince Henry of Battenberg\n\nThe Engagement\n\nIn 1884, Henry’s brother Prince Louis of Battenberg married Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, the eldest child of Queen Victoria’s third child Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine. Of course, Henry attended the wedding in Darmstadt and so did the bride’s aunt, Princess Beatrice. Queen Victoria had expectations that Beatrice would never marry and would remain her personal assistant and secretary. However, during the wedding celebrations, Henry and Beatrice fell in love. When Beatrice told her mother of her desire to marry Henry, Queen Victoria did not speak to Beatrice for seven months. Eventually, the Queen realized that Beatrice would not back down and with some persuasion from the Prince of Wales, Alice’s widower Ludwig IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, and Henry’s brother Prince Louis of Battenberg, Queen Victoria decided to allow the marriage with several conditions: Henry must renounce his military career, his nationality, and his home and agree to live with Beatrice and the Queen.\n\nWedding Site\n\nSaint Mildred’s Church in Whippingham, Isle of Wight, England was where Queen Victoria and her family worshipped when in residence at Osborne House, the beloved home Queen Victoria and Prince Albert built on the Isle of Wight. The original church was redesigned by architect Albert Jenkins Humbert with Prince Albert’s input. The chancel of the church was built in 1854 – 1855 and the remainder of the church was constructed in 1861 – 1862. A side chapel, originally used by members of the household at Osborne House when worshipping at Whippingham, was later made into a shrine, the Battenberg Chapel, upon the early death of Prince Henry of Battenberg. Several family members are buried there including Prince Henry and his wife Princess Beatrice.\n\nWedding Guests\n\nSince Saint Mildred’s Church was a small, parish church, the guest list had to be limited. Also, because there were limited places for royal relations and guests from abroad to stay on the Isle of Wight, the royal yachts served as floating hotels.\n\nRoyal Guests\n\nQueen Victoria, mother of the bride\n\nThe Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, brother of the bride\n\nThe Princess of Wales, later Queen Alexandra, sister-in-law of the bride\n\nPrince Albert Victor of Wales, nephew of the bride\n\nPrince George of Wales, later King George V, nephew of the bride\n\nPrincess Louise of Wales, niece of the bride\n\nPrincess Victoria of Wales, niece of the bride\n\nPrincess Maud of Wales, niece of the bride\n\nPrince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, brother of the bride\n\nThe Duchess of Edinburgh, born Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, sister-in-law of the bride\n\nPrince Alfred of Edinburgh, nephew of the bride\n\nPrincess Marie of Edinburgh, niece of the bride\n\nPrincess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh, niece of the bride\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Edinburgh, niece of the bride\n\nPrince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, brother of the bride\n\nThe Duchess of Connaught, born Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia, sister-in-law of the bride\n\nPrincess Margaret of Connaught, niece of the bride\n\nPrincess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, Princess Helena, sister of the bride\n\nPrince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, brother-in-law of the bride\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, niece of the bride\n\nPrincess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein, niece of the bride\n\nPrincess Louise, Marchioness of Lome, sister of the bride\n\nJohn Campbell, Marquis of Lome, brother-in-law of the bride\n\nPrince George, 2nd Duke of Cambridge, first cousin once removed of the bride\n\nPrince Edward of Saxe-Weimar\n\nErnst, 4th Prince of Leiningen, first cousin of the bride\n\nPrincess of Leiningen wife of Ernst, born Princess Marie of Baden\n\nPrince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine, father of the groom\n\nPrincess of Battenberg, born Countess Julie Hauke, mother of the groom\n\nPrince Louis of Battenberg, brother of the groom\n\nPrincess Louis of Battenberg, born Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, niece of the bride and first cousin once removed of the groom\n\nAlexander (of Battenberg), Prince of Bulgaria, brother of the groom\n\nPrince Franz Joseph of Battenberg, brother of the groom\n\nCount Gustav Ernst of Erbach-Schoenberg, brother-in-law of the groom\n\nCountess of Erbach-Schoenberg, born Princess Marie of Battenberg, sister of the groom\n\nLudwig IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, brother-in-law of the bride and first cousin of the groom\n\nErnst Ludwig, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse of Hesse and by Rhine, nephew of the bride and first cousin once removed of the groom\n\nPrincess Irene of Hesse of Hesse and by Rhine, niece of the bride and first cousin once removed of the groom\n\nPrincess Alix of Hesse of Hesse and by Rhine, niece of the bride and first cousin once removed of the groom\n\nPrince Philip of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, second cousin of the bride\n\nInvited Guests\n\nWilliam FitzRoy, 6th Duke of Grafton\n\nFrancis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford and Elizabeth Russell, Duchess of Bedford\n\nSusanna Innes-Kerr, Dowager Duchess of Roxburghe\n\nJames Butler, 3rd Marquess of Ormonde and Elizabeth Butler, Marchioness of Ormonde\n\nSpencer Cavendish, Marquis of Hartington\n\nJohn Poyntz Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer\n\nLouisa McDonnell, Countess of Antrim\n\nValentine Browne, 4th Earl of Kenmare\n\nGranville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville\n\nJohn Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney\n\nStandish Vereker, 4th Viscount Gort, Caroline Vereker, Viscountess Gort and The Honorable Miss Vereker\n\nAdmiral Lord Frederick Kerr\n\nGeneral Lord Alfred Paget and The Honorable Evelyn Paget\n\nLieutenant-General Dudley FitzGerald-de Ros, 23rd Baron de Ros\n\nIsmania FitzRoy, Baroness Southampton and The Honorable Frederica Fitzroy\n\nThomas Hovell-Thurlow-Cumming-Bruce, 5th Baron Thurlow\n\nEmily Cavendish, Lady Waterpark\n\nFrederick Methuen, 2nd Baron Methuen\n\nGeneral Lord Wolseley\n\nPrince Lichnowsky\n\nCount Alexander Münster\n\nCount Vitzthum\n\nColonel The Honorable C.

The train traveled to Portsmouth, England where the royal yacht Alberta was waiting to take them across The Solent to the Isle of Wight.

As the bride and groom and their attendants proceeded up the aisle Felix Mendelssohn’s “Wedding March” (from The Suite of Incidental Music to Shakespeare’s play A Midsummer Night’s Dream) was played.\n\nAfter the Wedding\n\nGuests at the wedding of Princess Beatrice to Prince Henry of Battenberg at Osborne House, Isle of Wight, Original Publication: Illustrated London News – pub. 1885\n\nUpon returning to Osborne House, the bride and groom signed the marriage registry attested by Queen Victoria, the royal family, royal guests, and distinguished persons.
