        "text": "Princess Beatrice is officially married! The 31-year-old royal tied the knot with property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in an intimate, picturesque wedding on July 17. And just like with most royal weddings, Beatrice received a fancy new title when she said \"I do.\"\n\nBecause Edoardo descends from Italian aristocracy (technically, he is Count Edoardo Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi), the princess is now also an Italian \"contessa\" and \"nobile donna\" (noble woman). Edoardo's dad is Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi, and given that Edoardo is his eldest son, he is set to inherit the family's ancestral seat, which is the 18th-century Villa Mapelli Mozzi palace in northern Italy.\n\nBeatrice's full British title was previously Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York, but now that she is married, her title will drop the reference to York and she'll now likely be known as Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice, Mrs. Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. Congrats again to Beatrice and Edoardo on their nuptials!"
