        "text": "There’s another royal baby en route. Princess Beatrice will welcome her first child with husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi this autumn, Buckingham Palace has confirmed. The Queen and both families are “delighted” at the news.\n\nPrincess Beatrice married businessman Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in an intimate ceremony at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor on July 17, 2020, wearing a vintage Norman Hartnell couture gown borrowed from her grandmother, the Queen. The couple initially intended to wed at St James’s Palace on May 29, 2020, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic the ceremony was postponed.\n\nThe couple’s engagement was formally announced in September 2019 after a year of dating, with photographs taken by Beatrice’s younger sister, Princess Eugenie. Mapelli Mozzi had proposed on a holiday in Italy. “I’m so happy for you my dearest big sissy and dear Edo,” Eugenie wrote on Instagram at the time. “It’s been a long time coming and you two are meant to be.” Earlier this year, Princess Eugenie welcomed her first child, August, with her husband Jack Brooksbank.\n\nPrincess Eugenie will undoubtedly be ecstatic for her sister as they’re famously close. “We’re each other’s rocks,” Eugenie previously confided in an interview with British Vogue. “We always look after each other. We’ve always been told, we’re the only person in each other’s lives that can know exactly what the other one is going through.”\n\nCome autumn, Beatrice and Edoardo will have plenty more to celebrate."
