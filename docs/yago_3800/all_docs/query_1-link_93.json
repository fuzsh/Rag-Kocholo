        "text": "The couple announced their engagement in September 2019, but Buckingham Palace took its time releasing the details of the ceremony following a slew of royal crises. In November, Beatrice’s father Prince Andrew resigned from public life following months of public outrage and a disastrous interview with the BBC over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Epstein’s death. In January, Beatrice’s cousin Prince Harry and Meghan Markle spurred yet another crisis when they announced their intention to “step back” from their roles as senior royals and become financially independent.\n\nAlthough it is not immediately clear whether these events directly impacted Beatrice and Edoardo’s nuptials, British broadcasters have yet to pick up the rights to televise their wedding. The wedding of Beatrice’s sister Princess Eugenie was aired by ITV in 2018.\n\nPrincess Beatrice is a granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth and currently ninth in line to the throne, according to the BBC.\n\nRepresentatives of the royal family did not respond to Business Insider’s request for comment on Mozzi’s personal life, career, or relationship with Princess Beatrice in September.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about the property tycoon who will soon be the newest royal spouse.\n\nEdoardo ‘Edo’ Mapelli Mozzi comes from a family of Italian aristocrats\n\nMozzi’s father, Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi, is a former Olympic Alpine skier, the BBC reported. The Italian count competed for Britain in the 1972 Winter Olympics. Mozzi and Beatrice will inherit his title, making the pair a “count” and “contessa,” Insider reported.\n\nMozzi’s parents are divorced and his mother, Nikki Williams-Ellis (formerly Nikki Shale), subsequently married the late Conservative parliamentarian Christopher Shale, according to the BBC.\n\nMozzi does not have a close relationship with his biological father and has called the late Shale “the only father I have ever known”, according to Tatler. The count has not even met Princess Beatrice.\n\nMozzi was a friend of the royal family long before he began dating Beatrice\n\nThe Daily Mail reports Mozzi’s stepfather once employed Beatrice’s mother, Sarah “Fergie” Ferguson, as a secretary at his public relations firm long before she married Beatrice’s father, Prince Andrew. Beatrice and her parents attended Shale’s funeral in 2011, according to People.\n\n“Our family has known Beatrice for most of her life,” Mozzi’s parents said in a statement after the engagement announcement. “Edo and Beatrice are made for each other, and their happiness and love for each other is there for all to see. They share an incredibly strong and united bond, their marriage will only strengthen what is already a wonderful relationship.”\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Mozzi founded London-based property development firm Banda in 2007, when he was just 23\n\n“I don’t think I am the average developer,” he told The New York Times in an interview earlier this month. “I think what Banda does is unique. There is certainly no one else of my age doing things like this in London. I actually don’t think anyone in London is doing a project that is as high a quality as this and at such a good price.”\n\nThe New York Times reporter Peter Wilson characterised Mozzi’s business model as “creating carefully designed homes for wealthy clients in areas slightly outside the most prestigious and expensive parts of London and selling them to people who intend to live in them, rather than to investors.”\n\nMozzi also serves as the firm’s CEO, according to his LinkedIn profile\n\nThe company has developed more than 400,000 sq ft of London real estate with a total gross development value of almost £700 million (about US$865 million), according to LinkedIn.\n\nThe firm “offers the comprehensive and completely bespoke services of property search, development, project management and interior design,” according to its website.\n\nWhile his personal net worth is not known, several publications (including Town and Country and People Magazine) note Mozzi is reportedly a multimillionaire in his own right.\n\nHe co-founded a non-profit organisation\n\nIn October 2011, Mozzi also co-founded a non-profit with his brother Alby Shale that teaches cricket to people in Rwanda called Cricket Builds Hope.\n\nCricket Builds Hope “uses cricket as a tool for positive social change in Rwanda,” according to Mozzi’s LinkedIn profile. The non-profit funded the construction of a cricket stadium in Rwanda and runs athletic programmes for local children.\n\nMozzi served as the chairman of the organisation’s board from 2011 to 2015, according to LinkedIn.\n\nMozzi has a son named Wolfie from a previous engagement\n\nWolfie’s mother is American architect Dara Huang, according to USA Today. The two split four months before Mozzi and Beatrice started dating, Insider previously reported.\n\nIn his free time, the businessman enjoys both skiing and being by the ocean\n\n“Oh! I do like to be beside the seaside,” Mozzi wrote on Instagram in August 2017.\n\nMozzi and Princess Beatrice have been romantically involved for about two years, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond estimates\n\nThe couple’s relationship “moved pretty quickly”, according to Dymond. The pair made their first public appearance as a couple in March 2019. They attended a gala together at the National Portrait Gallery in London. The couple got engaged during a weekend trip to Italy in September 2019, the Duke of York announced.\n\n“We are thrilled that Beatrice and Edoardo have got engaged, having watched their relationship develop with pride,” the Duke and Duchess of York said in a statement September 26. “We are the lucky parents of a wonderful daughter who has found her love and companion in a completely devoted friend and loyal young man. We send them every good wish for a wonderful family future.”\n\nBeatrice’s younger sister, Princess Eugenie, took their engagement photos in Italy. The Duke of York also said that the wedding is scheduled for 2020.\n\nMozzi designed Princess Beatrice’s engagement ring himself\n\nHe did, however, have some help from British jewellery designer Shaun Leane, The Duke of York noted in the engagement statement.\n\nThe ring is estimated to have cost US$100,000, Insider’s Mikhaila Friel previously reported.\n\n“I am so honoured Edoardo chose to work with me to design the engagement ring for Princess Beatrice and to have been involved in this special moment in their lives,” Leane wrote on Instagram. “The bespoke experience was a beautiful journey; from imagining the design with Edoardo to the crafting of the finished rings. Being able to incorporate both Edoardo and Princess Beatrice’s characters into the design has resulted in a unique ring that represents their love and lives entwining.”\n\nWant more stories like this?
