        "text": "In July 2020, Princess Beatrice married her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, in a small pandemic-appropriate Windsor ceremony. In honor of the couple’s third anniversary, the bride’s mother, Sarah Ferguson, shared a photograph from the day on her Instagram account, along with a message where she praises their skills as parents to 1-year-old daughter Sienna and 7-year-old stepson Wolfie.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n“Happy anniversary to my magical daughter and wonderful son-in-law,” she said. “You are the most amazing parents to my beautiful grandchildren. Your love knows no bounds. As your mother, Beatrice, it warms my heart and gives me peace knowing you got your fairytale.”\n\nThe couple’s July wedding took place soon after the UK ended its first coronavirus lockdown, and counted Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip among its 20 attendees. Though Ferguson and her ex-husband Prince Andrew were both present at the wedding, they were not featured in any of the photographs released by Buckingham Palace. After the ceremony, which took place at All Saints Chapel in Windsor, Andrew and Sarah hosted an outdoor reception at their nearby home, Royal Lodge.\n\nOn Sunday, Edoardo also took to Instagram to honor his wife. “Happy wedding anniversary to the most beautiful wife in the world,” he wrote. “I am so grateful for every moment we have shared, every challenge we have overcome, and every dream we have pursued together. I love you more than words can say, and I can't wait to celebrate many more anniversaries with you.”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe couple lives in a four-room apartment at St. James Palace in London, and The Sun reports that they also own a property in the Cotswolds. Their daughter Sienna was born in September 2021, but the couple hasn’t publicly shared photos of her. However, the palace released a photo of the late queen and eight of her great-grandchildren to honor her birthday in April, and in one picture frame to the side, Beatrice can be seen holding Sienna as she wears what looks to be the family’s hand-me-down coronation gown.\n\nIn late June, Ferguson underwent surgery after a breast cancer diagnosis, and afterward, a friend told the Daily Mail that Beatrice was a frequent visitor at Royal Lodge during her recovery.\n\nListen to Vanity Fair’s DYNASTY podcast now.\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry Says a “Central Piece” of Royal Family Rift Is His Feud With the British Media\n\nThe royal recounted his decision to take on the UK tabloids in Tabloids on Trial, a new documentary airing Thursday.\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry’s Calls to King Charles “Go Unanswered”\n\nThe monarch is reportedly no longer speaking to his younger son over Harry’s ongoing battle to secure enhanced security when he visits the UK.\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry Says Meghan Markle Isn’t Safe in the UK: “All It Takes Is One Lone Actor”\n\nIn a recent interview about his ongoing legal battles against a handful of British tabloids, the prince said the danger is that it only takes “one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read.”\n\nRoyals\n\nQueen Camilla: Everything to Know About the Queen of the UK\n\nCamilla Parker Bowles’s life—from her scandalous relationship with Charles to becoming queen—has long intrigued the public."
