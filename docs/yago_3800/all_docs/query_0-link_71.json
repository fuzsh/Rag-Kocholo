        "text": "Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore was born on April 14, 1857 at Buckingham Palace in London, as the youngest daughter of the British Queen Victoria.\n\nYouth\n\nFrom her birth, Beatrice was the favorite child of both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. She kind of filled the hole that her oldest sister Vicky left behind when she married. She was called Baby by everyone.\n\nEven though Queen Victoria was known for her dislike for newborns, she found Beatrice a very beautiful and attractive child. Beatrice showed intelligence, this reinforced the bond with the prince consort.\n\nPrince Albert wrote to Baron Stockmar that Beatrice was “the most fun baby we have had.”\n\nHer mother’s confidant\n\nAs I mentioned in my earlier blogs, Victoria, after Albert’s death in 1861, used all her daughters as support in her daily tasks. Beatrice played this role especially after all her sisters were married. She would keep doing this throughout her life.\n\nMarriage candidates\n\nAlthough Victoria did not really think that her Baby would ever get married, she gave Beatrice her permission to find a husband. However, on one condition: the couple had to move in with the queen. A number of possible candidates were put forward, including the French Prince impérial Napoleon Eugène, the only child of the ex-emperor Napoleon III and ex-Empress Eugénie, living in exile. Unfortunately, he died during the Zulu War. Queen Victoria wrote the following in her diary:\n\n“Dear Beatrice, crying very much as I did too, gave me the telegram… It was dawning and little sleep did I get… Beatrice is so distressed; everyone quite stunned.”\n\nAfter the death of the French Prince impérial, her eldest brother, Albert Edward, made a remarkable suggestion. He proposed that Beatrice should marry Grand Duke Louis IV of Hesse-Darmstadt. Louis IV was the husband of the late Princess Alice, who had died of diphtheria on December 14, 1878. A new law needed to be created, but it failed. I personally believe that Victoria wasn’t really sorry about this …\n\nDuring the wedding of Louis Alexander with Beatrice’s niece Victoria (daughter of Princess Alice), Beatrice fell in love with the groom’s younger brother, Prince Henry of Battenberg. He was also having some affection for Beatrice.\n\nThe wedding\n\nBeatrice told her mother that she and Henry wanted to get married. Queen Victoria responded with a frightening silence. Even though they worked side by side, the queen did not speak to her for seven months. Victoria only communicated with Beatrice through letters. Thanks to the Princess of Wales and the Crown Princess of Prussia, the Queen began to talk to Beatrice again. Victoria agreed to the marriage, provided that Henry, despite his life in Germany, would permanently live in England with Beatrice and the Queen.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Henry married, on July 23, 1885, in the St. Mildred’s Church at Whippingham, on the Isle of Wight. During the wedding, Beatrice wore the dress that her mother had worn during her wedding day. She was led to the altar by her mother and her eldest brother, the Prince of Wales. Since that day Beatrice wore the title Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Battenberg.\n\nMarriage\n\nDespite the marriage, Beatrice remained true to her promise and remained the confidant and private secretary of Her Majesty. The queen developed a strong affection for Henry.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Prince Henry had four children:\n\nAlexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke (1886-1960)\n\nVictoria Eugenie, Queen of Spain (1887-1969\n\nLord Leopold Mountbatten (1889-1922)\n\nPrince Maurice of Battenberg (1891-1914)\n\nQueen Victoria’s diaries\n\nIn 1896, Prince Henry, who had been appointed Governor of the Isle of Wight by the Queen, died of high fever. Princess Beatrice became a widow at the age of 38. When Queen Victoria also died in 1901, the princess moved to Osborne Cottage and fulfilled her duties as governor of the Isle of Wight, the function her husband’s old job. In 1914 she moved again, this time to Carisbrooke Castle.\n\nQueen Victoria had asked her youngest daughter to publish her diaries after her death, so Princess Beatrice began to read the diaries after the death of her mother and edited many parts. It was not until 1931 that she finished the 111 books, which are now in the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle.\n\nIn 1917 the British royal family, at the request of King George V, renounced all its German titles. Beatrice renounced her title ‘Princess of Battenberg’ and became Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice again. Her two remaining sons took the surname Mountbatten and her eldest son Prince Alexander was given the title ‘Marquis of Carisbrooke’. Only Victoria Eugénie, Queen of Spain, kept the surname ‘van Battenberg’.\n\nDeath\n\nPrincess Beatrice died in October 1944 during the Second World War in her home in Balcombe, Sussex. She was the last living child of Queen Victoria. Her funeral was in the St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on November 3 1944. She was afterwards deposed in the royal tomb. On August 23, 1945, her body was transferred to the Battenberg tomb in St. Mildred’s Church on the Isle of Wight.\n\nDo you want to see more pictures of Beatrice? Have a look at my Pinterest board:"
