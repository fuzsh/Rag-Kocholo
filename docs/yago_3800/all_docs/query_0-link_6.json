        "text": "One surprising development, after the Hessian wedding farce, was that Princess Beatrice, Baby, decided that she did not want to spend the rest of her days as the celibate companion of a widowed, ageing Queen. The lucky man was Prince Heinrich von Battenberg, as he continued to print his name on his visiting card... “The young people fell in love at Darmstadt... An inflammatory atmosphere it seems.” Queen Victoria was enraged by what she considered to be Baby’s selfishness. For seven months, though the two women lives side by side, she addressed no word to her youngest daughter. Communication was by note, pushed across the table, with eyes averted. In December, however, the mother relented, provided the young people accepted her terms. ‘Liko,’ as Prince Heinrich - from now on to be known as Prince Henry of Battenberg - must give up his career in the German Army and come to live in England. Baby must continue to be in constant attendance on the Queen. These terms were accepted. The couple had no choice, since Beatrice’s mother held the purse strings. “And now [the Queen] seems very happy about the thing. They are to live entirely with her...”\n\nTennyson was commissioned to pen a nuptial ode for the pair, who were married at Whippingham Parish Church in July 1885. The Queen explained that “Dear Beatrice will live with me as heretofore, without which I never could have allowed the marriage.” Tennyson incorporated this unusual theme into the ode:\n\nThe Mother weeps At that white funeral of the single life... but Thou, True daughter, whose all-faithful filial eyes Have seen the loneliness of earthly thrones, Wilt neither quit the widow’d Crown, nor let This later light of Love have risen in vain...\n\nAs she began her married life, Princess Beatrice must have regretted the demise of Brown. The marriage would appear to have been a success and her mother showed none of the snobbery felt about the Battenbergs by the German Emperor and his family...\n\nThe pair were to produce four children - Drino, or Alexander, Marquess of Carisbrooke, who lived until 1960; Queen Ena of Spain, the grandmother of King Juan Carlos, who lived until 1969; Leopold, who volunteered for service in the King’s Royal Rifle Corps and died in 1922; and Maurice, who gallantly joined the King’s Royal Fusiliers and died at Ypres in 1914. The latter two brothers were both hemophiliacs, Beatrice being a carrier, as was her daughter Queen Ena, who passed on the condition to two of her sons, Alfonso and Gonzalo.\n\n“Victoria: A Life,” A. N. Wilson"
