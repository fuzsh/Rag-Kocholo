        "text": "Surprise! Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, joined Prince William and Kate Middleton in Amman to represent the British royal family at the royal wedding of Crown Prince Hussein and Rajwa Al Saif.\n\nFor the ceremony at Zahran Palace, Princess Beatrice wore a Needle and Thread pale blue gown. She accessorized with a black bow in her hair, and a black belt around the dress.\n\nThe Jordanian and British royal families have long been close. Last month, the Jordanian royals were at King Charles and Queen Camilla's coronation, when King Abdullah II and Queen Rania were at Westminster Abbey for the historic occasion.\n\n\"The ceremony was beautiful and unforgettable,\" Queen Rania reflected on the coronation. \"It struck the perfect balance of solemnity, spectacle, and spirituality. The many different traditions and rituals we saw were a reminder of Britain's deep respect for its history, and the link between King Charles III and British sovereigns of centuries past. It is admirable to see how the British monarchy has evolved through the years and remained a steadying presence for the country and its people.\"\n\nIn September 2022, too, Abdullah and Rania were among the many royals who traveled to London for Queen Elizabeth's funeral. And, for King Charles and Queen Camilla's first overseas trip since the pandemic the then-Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, they chose to go to Jordan in November 2021."
