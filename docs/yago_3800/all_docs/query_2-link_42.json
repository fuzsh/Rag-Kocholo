        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis page presents original documents relating to styles and titles of the British royal family (see the general discussion).\n\nThe first part of this page contains official grants and decisions on styles and titles issued by the sovereign in any form (letters patent, warrants, etc). First, general grants are presented (that is, grants that apply to classes of people); then, individual grants (that is, grants that apply to one or more named individual and possibly their issue). Finally, some documents are presented concerning relatives of the Royal family who were not necessarily considered part of the Royal family but received special treatment: the Tecks, Battenbergs, and Gleichens.\n\nThe second part presents evidence of official usage (usage in official documents, particularly documents emanating from or signed by the sovereign) for certain individuals: the descendants of the duke of Cumberland (royal family of Hanover from 1837), and the successive princes of Wales (from 1716 to the present prince).\n\nThe third part collects warrants relating to the heraldry of members of the British royal family.\n\nIn almost every instance, the text I reproduce is the actual warrant or letters patent. The full text of these documents is rarely published, and I have reproduced either the original document or certified copies found in the National Archives or in the records of the College of Arms (reproduced with kind permission of the College). Usually, a grant or decision is gazetted in the London Gazette, and some report will also appear in the Times. Although the texts sent to the Gazette were drafted and reviewed in the Home Office, the announcement is an abridgement of the original document, usually omitting the preamble and sometimes differing in the exact wording of the dispositive part. Occasionally, however, the Gazette announcement conveys additional information that is not in the letters patent (for example, in 1957, the Queen's wishes as to the manner in which her husband should be designated). Therefore, I have also reproduced the Gazette or Times announcements, indented to the right.\n\nIt should be noted that the by-line date under which the document is gazetted is not necessarily the same as the date of the document itself. Sometimes, the announcement specifies the date of the document (e.g., 'by Letters Patent dated ...\"), but oftentimes it doesn't.\n\n1.
