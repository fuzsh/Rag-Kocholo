        "text": "This came on the heels of an even more enamoured post in August 2022: “You are the world’s best wife,” Mapelli Mozzi gushed. “Along with this, you are the best mother in the world.”\n\nSo who are Princess Beatrice’s and Mapelli Mozzi’s children? And do they spend any time with their grandparents, including the disgraced Prince Andrew? Here’s everything we know.\n\nPrincess Beatrice is married to an Italian count\n\nEdoardo is a member of the Italian nobility; his father is Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi. As previously reported, Edoardo founded London-based property development firm Banda in 2007 at age 23, and he continues to hold the role of its CEO, per his LinkedIn.\n\nThey share a daughter, Sienna Elizabeth\n\nPrincess Beatrice also has a stepson, Christopher Woolf\n\nTwo-year-old Sienna has an older half-brother in Christopher Woolf, Mapelli Mozzi’s son with his ex, Dara Huang.\n\nChristopher Woolf – better known as Wolfie – is seven years old and, according to People, Beatrice has been very involved with him since he was a toddler.\n\n“Beatrice has embraced the child as part of her life from the outset,” a friend of the princess reportedly told the magazine in 2019. When it came time for Beatrice and her count to marry, Wolfie was the couple’s page boy and was even his father’s best man, per the publication.\n\nWho is Wolfie’s biological mum, Dara Huang?\n\nGlamorous, Harvard-educated Huang is an architect and interior designer. People reported that Wolfie’s mum previously split her time between London and Hong Kong; however, these days her Instagram suggests that she spends most of her time between London and Miami.\n\nShe has appeared as an expert and judge respectively on the reality television shows Britain’s Most Expensive Houses and The Big Interiors Battle.\n\nDo Sienna and Wolfie hang out with other royals?\n\nBut do the children ever see their controversial grandfather, Prince Andrew?\n\nAccording to British media, despite the furore surrounding their father, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie are still close to him – as is his ex-wife and their mother, who still stays with the disgraced prince at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park.\n\nGiven that Ferguson often talks publicly about how much time she spends with her grandchildren at the Royal Lodge – including telling Hello! that she has to rearrange the furniture each time they visit – it seems clear that the kids must get to spend time with their grandad too."
