        "text": "Queen Victoria remarked on her journal that it was a “hot” but “splendid” summer day. She “slept soundly, but awoke early, & could hardly realise the event that was going to take place.” After spending breakfast with Beatrice, she gave her a “ruby half hoop ring.” The piece was itself a wedding present given to The Queen by her uncle, the Duke of Sussex.\n\nThe Queen gave her youngest daughter and child a privilege not bestowed to any of her other daughters: she permitted Beatrice to wear her “dear wedding veil,” which Victoria had worn previously “at all my Children's christenings.” The last time The Queen wore it was at the wedding of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, to Princess Helen of Waldeck-Pyrmont, in 1882. The bride, “who was busy answering telegrams up to the last” “wore besides, the diamond circlet with diamond stars.”\n\nQueen Victoria described her daughter’s wedding dress as “quite simple, in ivory white satin, very long, trimmed with my wedding lace, & some small garlands & sprays of orange blossoms, myrtle & white heather. Her jewels were diamonds.” She “did look sweet” on this special day. Her bouquet was made of flowers from the royal gardens at Frogmore. The Queen, meanwhile, donned her usual black dress and wore her small crown.\n\nThe six-mile drive from Osborne House to St. Mildred’s church was slow. Mother and daughter shared the carriage together, with two equerries, Sir John McNeill and Sir Henry Ewart riding on either side. The road from Osborne to the church was packed by “crowds of people, who cheered loudly” and greeted well-wishes to the princess. A “fine” guard of honour of the 93rd Highlanders welcomed the wedding party and guests while playing \"Highland Laddie\". Waiting at the entrance of the church was the Queen’s eldest son and heir, Bertie, the Prince of Wales, in his field marshal uniform, joined by the “sweet young bridesmaids,” who were all Beatrice’s nieces: Princesses Louise of Wales, Irène of Heese, Victoria of Wales, Helena Victoria of Schleswig Holstein, Maud of Wales, Alix of Hesse, Marie Louise of Schleswig Holstein, Marie of Edinburgh, Victoria Melita of Edinburgh and Alexandra of Edinburgh. They were all “dressed in white, with bunches of red & white carnations on the front of the dress.”\n\nTo accommodate the number of royal relations and dignitaries who flocked to the Isle of White for the wedding, canopies were installed on the church grounds to protect the people lining each side of the way from the heat. The path was “carpeted with red” with “the roof & columns draped in red & white,” which according to The Queen, revealed “a most brilliant festive effect & was imposing, though simple.” The female guests who arrived in the previous day were enjoined to wear demi-toilettes, while those who arrived from London only that morning were allowed to wear bonnets.\n\nThe Queen and the Prince of Wales walked with Beatrice on either side proceeding to the chapel. Inside the church, the groom waited for her bride at the chancel, together with Alix, the Princess of Wales (who looked glorious in her white eau de nil), the groom’s parents, and brothers Princes Alexander and Francis of Battenberg. Henry looked dashing “in his fine white uniform with the ribbon of the Garter, & the collar of the Hessian order.”\n\nDuring the ceremony Wagner's “Brant Chor” was played on the organ by Mr Parratt. The service was presided by the Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the Bishop of Winchester, the Dean of Windsor, and the Vicar of Whippingham.\n\nThe Queen was emotional but she was overcome with joy. She later wrote:\n\nIt was very touching. I stood very close to my dear child, who looked very sweet, pure, & calm. Though I stood for the 9th time near a child & for the 5th time near a daughter, at the altar, I think I never felt more deeply than I did on this occasion, though full of confidence.\n\nAfter the couple received the blessing, Queen Victoria “tenderly embraced my darling Baby\". A wedding luncheon was hosted by the Queen at Osborne House, during which she “proposed the health of the Bride & Bridegroom, wishing them every possible happiness.”\n\nFor their wedding cake, news of the day reported:\n\nThree cakes, one above the other, and a plateau upon which it rests, and surrounding the lower cake, is a wreath of lilies, white, interspersed with ivy, emblematic of purity, sweetness, and friendship. Surrounding the lowest cake are large skeleton shields, bearing on enclosed shields the coat of arms of the Princess Beatrice and Prince Henry of Battenberg, interspersed with passion flowers. Surrounding the second cake are jessamine, and round the second and third cakes are passion flowers, ivy, and roses. On the top are cupids and a large vase containing an immense bouquet, composed of a variety of emblematic flowers. The cake weighs about 4-cwt., and the floral decorations are all modelled entirely of sugar. It stood on a massive gold stand, which was designed and made for the happy occasion. It was made to the order of the Kentish ladies by Messrs. Buzzare, of Oxford Street.\n\nAt about 4 in the afternoon, the couple left for their honeymoon in Ryde, just a few miles from Osborne. “The moment had come to take leave of my darling ‘Baby,’” Queen Victoria wrote, “whom it cost me much to part with, even for such a short while.” She “felt utterly miserable when they left my room, & had not the heart to go down & see them drive away.”\n\nThat evening, The Queen hosted a “very large, “ wedding dinner for her family and guests. She remarked that “The Tent had been better ventilated [that evening], & it was not near so hot” as compared to earlier that day. A fireworks display highlighted the gathering, The Queen commenting that the illuminations that night was “even more brilliant” than the ones staged on the eve of the wedding. The yachts in Osborne Bay were well lit and “sent off rockets” in honour of this special occasion. After spending the “beautiful” night, she tired queen “felt so low,” and “escaped quietly to my room.”"
