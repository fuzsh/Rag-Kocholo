Source: Hello Magazine/Instagram.\n\nFriday saw the surprise private wedding of Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York and Mr. Mapelli Mozzi at All Saints Chapel in the grounds of Royal Lodge, Windsor, the Yorks' family home. The wedding had already been postponed due to the Corona virus and the service went ahead with restrictions; only 20 guests attended. The bride not only borrowed a tiara from The Queen, she also borrowed her wedding dress from her grandmother, which was previously worn to the film premiere of 'Lawrence of Arabia' in 1962 and to the State Opening of Parliament in 1966."
