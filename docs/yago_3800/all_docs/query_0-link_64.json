        "text": "More: Carl Backofen (1845â€“1926)\n\nCarl Bacofen was the son of the painter, photographer and musician Franz Bernhard Ludwig Bacofen (1806-1881) and his wife Caroline Margarete Louise Lindt (1815-1873). Carl Bakofen was trained as a photographer by his father. Together they opened the photographic studio C. Backofen at Riedeselstrasse 37 in Darmstadt in 1875. The studio operated under this name until around 1904. Since Carl Backofen was last listed in the Darmstadt address books in 1887, the photographers continued to run the studio as proprietors: 1887 August Schicktanz, 1888-1889 Gustav Brandsef, 1892-1893 Gustav Backofen, 1896-1898 Johann Stefan Schroeder Kgl. Saxon. Court Photographer, 1899-1900 Josef Giesinger and Konrad Ruf and 1901-1904 Alfred Ruf and Konrad Ruf. At some unknown time, Karl Bekofen became court photographer at the Darmstadt court of Ludwig IV (Hesse-Darmstadt). The addresses printed on the back of his cabinet cards show that Carl Bekofen had a studio not only in Darmstadt but also in Bensheim."
