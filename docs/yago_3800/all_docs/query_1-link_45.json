        "text": "Princess Beatrice enjoyed a night out in London on Tuesday with her husband of nearly four years Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The two supported author Gabriela Peacock and the success of her second book, “2 Weeks to A Younger You,” at the Broadwick Soho Hotel in London.\n\nFor the low-key event, opted to repurpose a dress she wore last summer. The British royal family member fashioned a watercolor floral-print short swing dress by Me and Em. The flowing minidress featured a dainty design of vibrant florals in cream, red, pink and purple, ideal for the spring and summer seasons. She completed the look with a pair of burgundy Jimmy Choo velvet pumps.\n\nThe dress featured light fabric, which gathered around the waist, creating a flowing, feminine silhouette. The playful frock also featured a sharp collar, giving the piece an elegant twist. Princess Beatrice previously wore this dress in July 2023 while out in London with her husband to celebrate their wedding anniversary after a trip to the Wimbledon tennis tournament.\n\nFlorals and vibrant colors are a favorite of Princess Beatrice during the spring and summer seasons. While attending Royal Ascot in June 2023 alongside her husband, Princess Beatrice fashioned a floral midi dress with puff sleeves and a ruffled collar. The ’80s-inspired Beulah London dress featured a pink rose print. She completed the look with nude Chanel slingback heels.\n\nPrincess Beatrice, the daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York and granddaughter of the late Queen Elizabeth II, often fashions pieces that feature a feminine silhouette and vibrant patterns and colors. The royal has previously worn such hues as bright pink at the coronation of her uncle King Charles III, and enjoys intricate details like florals, puffy sleeves and more.\n\nWhile the royal enjoys such feminine flare in her approach to her fashion, she regularly wears classic and traditional silhouettes and repurposes items from her wardrobe, much like the frock she wore to last night’s London event."
