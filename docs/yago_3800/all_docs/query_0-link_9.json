        "text": "Princess Beatrice (1857-1944) was the last of the nine children of Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert. It is known that Victoria was not particularly fond of children, so much so that she compared them to frogs, but she found her last child to be a ‘a pretty, plump and flourishing child … with fine large blue eyes‘.\n\nBeatrice was affectionately called ‘Baby‘, a nickname that remained with her into adulthood. Albert wrote to Baron Stockmar that Beatrice was ‘the most amusing baby we have had’. In a way, Beatrice had a more relaxed childhood than her siblings, thanks to the privileged relationship she had with her parents.\n\nWhen she was only four years old, however, her carefree childhood was interrupted by the untimely death of her father, Prince Albert, in 1861, which left Victoria distraught with grief. The Queen isolated herself from her family, in particular the Prince of Wales (whom she blamed for her husband’s death), with the exception of Alice and Beatrice. Queen Victoria would often take Beatrice from her cot, rush to her bed and ‘lay there sleepless, clasping to her child, wrapped in the nightclothes of a man who would wear them no more‘.\n\nThe demands on Beatrice during her mother’s reign were undoubtedly high. Despite suffering from rheumatism, Beatrice was forced to endure her mother’s love of the cold. Beatrice’s piano playing suffered as her rheumatism worsened, removing a pleasure at which she excelled; however, this did not change her willingness to meet her mother’s demands and her efforts did not go unnoticed by the British public.\n\nAs the years went by, it became increasingly clear that Beatrice’s role was that of her mother’s companion and assistant, and marriage seemed unlikely for her, so that when in 1884 the 27-year-old Beatrice fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg, announcing to her mother her desire to marry him, Victoria reacted coldly, determined to keep her daughter by her side. In the end, however, she agreed to the marriage, on the condition that Prince Henry renounced his assignment in the Prussian army and that the couple settled with her.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Prince Henry were married in St Mildred’s Church, Whippingham, near Osborne, on 23 July 1885 and made Osborne their home.\n\nThe Times newspaper, shortly before Beatrice’s wedding, wrote: ‘The devotion of your Royal Highness to our beloved Sovereign has won our warmest admiration and our deepest gratitude. May those blessings which it has hitherto been your constant aim to confer on others now be returned in full measure to yourself.’\n\nThe new couple were very much in love, Prince Henry became a welcome addition to the family and with his presence the court was brighter than it had been before the death of the Prince Consort. The two had four children, born between 1886 and 1891.\n\nBeatrice, however, kept her promise to her mother by continuing to be her secretary and constant companion.\n\nIn 1889, Queen Victoria appointed Prince Henry governor of the Isle of Wight, but the prince felt restless at Osborne. On one occasion he went away on a trip to Corsica and the Queen sent a warship to bring him back. At the end of 1895, he convinced the queen to let him go to West Africa to fight in the Ashanti war. During his stay in Africa, however, he fell ill with malaria and died on the return journey in January 1896.\n\nAfter his death, Beatrice succeeded her husband as Governor of the Isle of Wight, but remained the Queen’s unofficial companion and secretary, living on the Osborne Estate.\n\nThe death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901 left Beatrice distraught. In a letter she wrote: ‘… you may imagine what the grief is. I, who had hardly ever been separated from my dear mother, can hardly realise what life will be like without her, who was the centre of everything.’\n\nBeatrice sold the Osborne Cottage property in 1913, when Carisbrooke Castle, home of the Governor of the Isle of Wight, became vacant. She then moved into the castle while keeping a flat at Kensington Palace, London.\n\nHer presence at court diminished further as she grew older. Devastated by the death of her favourite son, Maurice, during the First World War in 1914, she began to withdraw from public life.\n\nAfter Queen Victoria’s death, Beatrice began the huge task of transcribing and editing her mother’s journals, which the queen had kept since 1831. The journals contained the Queen’s personal views on the daily affairs of her life and included personal and family matters as well as matters of state. Queen Victoria had entrusted Beatrice with the task of compiling the journals for publication, which meant deleting private material and passages that, if published, could have been damaging to living people. Beatrice removed so much material that the edited journals are only a third as long as the originals!\n\nTwo of Beatrice’s sons, Leopold and Maurice, inherited the haemophilia gene from their mother. Maurice was killed while on active service during the First World War while Leopold lived to the age of 32, dying during a hip operation in 1922.\n\nHer daughter Victoria Eugenie married King Alfonso XIII of Spain at the Royal Monastery of San Jerónimo in Madrid on 31 May 1906 and converted to Catholicism. Although the marriage was not particularly happy and Alfonso had many mistresses, the couple had six children, four boys and two girls. Two of their children, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, heir of Spain, and Infante Gonzalo of Spain, suffered from haemophilia. It is said that Alfonso never forgave his wife for passing the disease on to the Spanish royal lineage. Both children were dressed in padded suits to prevent them from suffering shocks that could have caused life-threatening haemorrhage.\n\nPrincess Beatrice, little Baby, died at the age of 87 at her final resting place, Brantridge Park, Sussex, in 1944, and was buried next to her husband at Whippingham, on the Isle of Wight so familiar to her.\n\nShe was the last surviving child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\n\nFor further reading\n\nMatthew Dennison, The Last Princess: The Devoted Life of Queen Victoria’s Youngest Daughter, 2021"
