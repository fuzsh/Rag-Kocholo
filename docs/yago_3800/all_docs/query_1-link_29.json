        "text": "Update 7/17/20, 8:32 a.m: The palace confirmed Princess Beatrice's wedding in a statement.\n\n“The private wedding ceremony of Princess Beatrice and Mr. Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi took place at 11am on Friday 17th July at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor,” the statement read. \"The small ceremony was attended by The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, and close family. The wedding took place in accordance with all relevant Government Guidelines.”\n\nRoyal reporter Omid Scobie tweeted that a photo of the bride and groom will likely be released on July 18.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOriginal story: Surprise! Princess Beatrice is married. Multiple British outlets are reporting that Beatrice married her fiancé, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, this morning (July 17) in a secret wedding at Windsor Castle this morning. (Buckingham Palace has yet to confirm the ceremony.)\n\nQueen Elizabeth's granddaughter, whose parents are Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, previously had to postpone her big royal wedding earlier this spring due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDetails are just beginning to roll in, but Daily Mail royals reporter Rebecca English says the queen and Prince Philip were spotted being driven on the Windsor estate this morning and are believed to have been in attendance at the wedding. “Beatrice and Edo had planned to get married at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace but instead exchanged vows at All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park in an intimate ceremony, with strict social distancing measures in place,” she also tweeted.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBy March, they had to call off the big day due to COVID-19. \"Beatrice and Mr. Mapelli Mozzi are very much looking forward to getting married but are equally aware of the need to avoid undertaking any unnecessary risks in the current circumstances,\" a palace spokesperson said in a statement. \"In line with government advice for the U.K. and beyond, the couple are reviewing their arrangements. They are particularly conscious of government advice in relation to both the well-being of older family members and large gatherings of people. Therefore, the planned reception in the Buckingham Palace Gardens will not take place.\"\n\n\"The couple will carefully consider government advice before deciding whether a private marriage might take place amongst a small group of family and friends,\" the statement continued.\n\nNow it looks like they've found a way to get married safely and with at least some of their family around.\n\nCongrats, you two!\n\nThis post may be updated as new details emerge."
