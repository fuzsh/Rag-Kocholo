        "text": "Al-Idrisi; The Book of Roger The description of Al Andalos\n\nView Diagrams Download Paper Download Images\n\nAl-Idrisi quotes basic distance measures as follows; from Cape Creuz to Cape St Vincent, 1100 miles and then from Santiago de Compostella to Almeria, 600 miles. Al-Idrisi comments that these are actual road route mileages and not geographical calculations. Thus they can be tested against excellent route mileages given by the Romans.\n\nCAPE CREUZ TO CAPE ST VINCENT DISTANCES;\n\ncgId2D12\n\ncgId2D13\n\ncgId2D14\n\nIn the Roman world c100BCE to 100CE route mileages were plotted and recorded and that record is now known as the ‘Antonine Itinerary’. It is a list of mileages from and within most provinces of the Roman Empire. There are also the ‘Vicarello Beakers’ which have cast on their outer shell a similar listing for one major route, Gades to Rome. Thus we have the Roman mileage from place to place along known routes. We must also include the Tabula Peutingeriana, the Roman Route map which is basically an illustration of the Antonine Itineraries, but must add at this point that the first section of that route map containing both Spain and Britannia is now missing. For our purposes the route from Gades to Rome which is via the Col des Pannisars in the Pyrenees is perfect. The Roman Way station atop the Pyrenees is the junction of the Via Domitia from Gaul and the Via Augusta in Spain and was marked by the so called ‘Pompeius Trophy’, a monumental Arch. The Roman Road in Spain from Gades to the Arch was organised during the reign of Augustus on the prehistoric pathway known as Via Heraclea used by Hannibal in earlier times.\n\nBy using the Roman distance measures we can in fact show that the 1100 miles quoted by Al-Idrisi is quite correct whether the travel is by road or sea. The minor deviations of each are equal in distance.\n\nThe width, given as 600 miles from Santiago de Compostella to Almeria ‘by known roads’, is equally precise as is discussed later.\n\nThus we can state quite categorically that Al-Idrisi could not have meant that the Peninsula of Spain, Al-Andalos was actually triangular. It was a metaphor, a poor metaphor in the circumstances, but nevertheless it has had profound effect upon cartography.\n\nHaving dealt with the overall measures we can now turn to Al-Idrisi’s sub-text, the internal distances and his description of Spain.\n\nTHE COASTLINE OF THE PENINSULA\n\ncgId2D15\n\ncgId2D16\n\nReturning to the very first sentences of the 4th Climate, 1st section, Al-Idrisi states that there is an interval of 5 days, i.e. a journey of 5 days from the junction of the Mediterranean Sea and the Ocean. That is, commencing at the Detroit and extending to Cape St Vincent. This is obviously a no-man’s-land apropos the two bodies of water although it is referred to as the entrance to the Syrian Sea.\n\nCuriously the map of this area in the ‘ARABE 2221’ text held by BnF has been altered, amended after it was drawn to illustrate just this point as diagram cgId2D15 illustrates. The southern coastline of Spain has been curtailed by an over colouring as sea to provide for a 5 day journey time of land/sea between the Pillars of Hercules and Cape St Vincent, the extremity of Spain and the start of the Ocean Ténèbreux.\n\nThat alteration indicates that the text has been read and found to indicate a different geographical situation to that originally portrayed on the section map. That fact is illustrated by the matching diagrams from the Pococke 375 text of Al-Idrisi, as cgId2D16 illustrates. However, the person who noticed this discrepancy and endeavoured to correct the map did not take into account the displacement of the African coastline across the Detroit that such an alteration would make.\n\nThus it is possible to state at this juncture that even the overall map produced by Dr Konrad Miller must be re-considered, re-assessed in the light of the text of Al-Idrisi and not accepted as representing the original text but reproducing the diagrams accompanying later transcriptions only. This is fully discussed in the text cgId3, to follow.\n\nTEXT DETAILS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nCommencing at the beginning of the 4th Climate, Section 1; I translate it as follows;\n\n“This first section commences at the part in the extreme west bathed by the Ocean Ténèbreux, the Sea of darkness from which issues the Sea of Syria (Mediterranean) which in turn trends towards the east. It is there that is situated the land of Andalous which the Christians name Spain or the Peninsula of Andalous, on account of that its form is triangular and itself narrows from the east side to the point of not leaving between the Mediterranean Sea and the Ocean, who surround it, but an interval of 5 days. The greatest width of Spain is about 17 days journey, starting from a promontory in the extreme west where ends the inhabited portion of the land surrounded by the Ocean. No one knows what exists beyond this sea; no one has been able to learn anything for certain because of the difficulty of crossing it, its profound darkness, the height of the waves, the frequency of its storms, the prevalence of its animals and the violence of its winds. There is however in this Ocean a large number of islands, inhabited or desert, but no ship’s captain ventures to cross it or to travel under full sail. They are limited to coasting, without losing sight of land. The waves of this sea are as high as mountains and although they are in violent commotion remain none the less whole, not breaking in pieces. If it were otherwise, to cross then would be possible.”\n\nThere is the curiosity within this text of a single mention of the ‘largest width of the peninsula being approximately 17 days’ journey’ and it being from a cape in the extreme west. This has previously been taken as being Cape St Vincent where the Ocean can be said to flow around and encircle the cape.\n\nHowever, we have already seen that the width was given as 600 miles from NW to SE Spain. Thus the 17 days’ journey actually commences at Cape Finisterre or Cape Ortegal (a point mentioned by Al-Idrisi). But even if we accept the triangular description for one moment the width still cannot be measured from the south-west extremity. Thus the 600 miles and the 17 days’ journey are probably one and the same and possibly a slightly more direct route from Santiago de Compostella to Almeria than the one via Toledo which we are informed is 18 days’ journey. Al-Idrisi indicates in his text that he has assumed 30 miles for a days’ travel following the foothills of the Pyrenees between Biarritz and Cape Creuz as an acceptable figure. That is therefore that the given 9 days is thus an accurate 270 miles. Thus 17 days equals 510 miles and the mathematics makes reasonable sense with 600 miles being a slightly indirect route. It must be noted that Al-Idrisi varies the travel distance per day throughout his text from 20 to 30 miles at random.\n\nThus the extreme west of the peninsula is the north-west corner, and it is appropriate therefore in his text to follow with a description of the Ocean Ténèbreux as we are here at the most violent part of the Ocean.\n\nIt is now necessary to combine the data contained within Climates 4 and 5, Sections 1, to obtain an overall picture of the coastal distances and the internal road distances.\n\nEach however is problematic; Al-Idrisi changes from Days’ Journey to Mileage between places even in the same sentence, and as staed we cannot know precisely which mileage per day is utilised.\n\nTHE NORTH COAST\n\nThe north coast of Spain and the Pyrenees are described in the 5th Climate where Al-Idrisi commences at the north-west corner, Cape Ortegal and Santiago de Compostella.\n\n“Leaving the church of St Iago the dark sea turns like an elbow which continues from the west to the east but trending a little towards the south and it continues until the town of Bayonne.”\n\nAfter this description Al-Idrisi states ”the travellers take 23 days more or less to cover this distance”. The total mileage given within the text is 317 miles, but, Cape Ortegal to Bayonne is actually 550Km or 350 miles. But, the actual text would appear to be faulty, probably a miscopy, as the north coast is ill defined to Bayonne. However, 317 miles in 23 days is only 13.78 mpd, and must have included many more stops.\n\nWithin this section the most important description given is that of the Pyrenees, their length and width and the crossing points between Spain and France. There is however a serious error within the French translation with the terms ‘longueur’ and’ largeur’ being exchanged. This has been rectified by a direct translation from the original Arabic text.\n\nThe French text by Jaubert is as follows;\n\n“Les voyageurs parcourent cette distance en 23 jours, plus ou moins. Bayonne est située a l’extrémité de ce cap. A partir de là (le rivage de) la mer reprend sa direction et fait face à l’occident. C’est au fort d’Alfar ou Alghar, don’t nous venons de parler, que commence la chaîne des montagnes de Chibah (Ceva de Pyreneo) qui longent les bords de la mer jusqu’à Bayonne, tantôt s’en rapprochement à la distance de 15 milles. Ces montagnes s’étendent sans interruption jusqu’à Bayonne; là elles atteignent les montagnes du temple de Vénus (de Port-Vendres), et leur longueur est de 9 journées, en évaluant la journée à 30 milles. Les montagnes du temple de Vénus, situées a l’extrémité de la presqu’île d’Andalousie, s’étendent en largeur et ferment l’espace compris entre la merTénébreuse ou la mer des Anglais et la Méditerranée, c’est-à-dire entre Bayonne et le pays de Barcelone. Ces montagnes sont très-hautes et portent le nom d’al-Bortat (les Pyrénées). Elles séparent l’Andalousie du pays des Francs. La longueur de ces montagnes, du nord au sud et par des lignes (plus ou moins) courbes, est de 7 journées. Il y a quatre portes à l’entrée de défilés tellement étroits qu’il ne peut y passer qu’un cavalier après un autre. Ces portes sont larges et spacieuses, mais les chemins y sont affreux. L’une d’entre elles, située du côté de Barcelone, s’appelle la Porte de Djaca: une autre, voisine de la précédente, s’appelle Achmora; la troisième est celle qu’on nomme la Porte de César, et elle s’étend en longueur à travers la montagne sur un espace de 35 milles; la quatrième est la Porte de Bayonne. Non loin de chacune de ces portes, et des deux côtés (des montagnes), on trouve des villes; ainsi, du côté de la Porte de César, on remarque Pampelune, et, du côté de la Porte de Djaca la ville de ce nom (Jaca).”\n\nThe translation is as follows;\n\n“The voyagers travel this distance in more or less 23 days. Bayonne is situated at the extremity of this cape. To leave from there (the shore of) the sea takes up the direction and faces west. It is the Fort of Alfar, of which we come to speak that commences the chain of mountains that runs along the edge of the sea until Bayonne, sometimes moving away from the sea to a distance of a days’ journey and sometimes they come as close as 15 miles. These mountains stretch out without interruption until Bayonne and there they meet the mountains of the Temple of Venus, and their length is 9 days’ journey which we evaluate at 30 miles per day. The mountains of the Temple of Venus are situated at the extremity of the Peninsula of Andalous and they stretch out transversely and close off the space lying between the Dark Sea, or the English Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, that is to say between Bayonne and the lands around Barcelona. These mountains are very high and are called the Pyrenees. They separate Spain and France. The length of these mountains from north to south and by the contours (i.e. the height at which it is possible to walk through them) is 7 days. There are 4 Passes, at the entrance of the defiles which are very narrow there is only space for horses to follow in single file. The actual Passes are large and spacious, but the roads there are dreadful. The one they enter situated on the side of Barcelona is called the Pass of Jaca, another, a neighbour of the first is called Achmora and the third is that called the Pass of Caesar, and it stretches out in length to traverse the mountains for a length of 35 miles. The fourth is the Pass of Bayonne. Not far from them, these passes, and the two sides of the mountains we find the towns in this way. At the side of the Pass of Caesar we note Pamplona and at the side of the Pass of Jaca the town of the same name.”\n\nThus there is no mention of the Pyrenees being a north/south range, but on the contrary Al-Idrisi clearly states the length as 9 days, that they stretch out transversely and their length north/south is 7 days, but, that that is dependent upon the height at which you traverse the mountains.\n\nHowever, Al-Idrisi has confused the crossing points, but in name only. There are 4 main passes across the Pyrenees from north to south and they are as follows; on the east going north from Barcelona the pass which would have been in use is the Col des Panissars near Le Perthus which is as already described the junction of the French Via Domitia and the Spanish Via Augusta. The next is the pass north of Jaca which leads to Oloron and Pau in France. The Pamplona route, which Al-Idrisi states is” via the Porte de Cesar” can be either via the Pass of Roncevalles or the coastal route to Bayonne. Al-Idrisi also states “from Pamplona to Bayonne we follow the coastline for two days journey” and goes onto state “the access from one to the other of these two towns is via the Porte de Bayonne which we remark as the highest pass”.\n\nA remark which follows aids our research, “the distances of Leon and Burgos to Toledo are 7 days” and he reiterates that Santiago de Compostella, ‘by the normal route’ is 9 days.\n\nHaving described various other distances, Lerida/Tortosa/Tarragona/Barcelona Al-Idrisi states, “Barcelona possesses a suburb and is defended by strong walls. The access to this town in Spain is via a defile situated in the mountains called the Temple of Venus or in the language of the Christians ‘de Bortoniour’ or Port Vendres (in France)”. This is at variance to the previous statement, but obviously refers to the Roman Road passes at Le Perthus or the smaller coastal route via Cape Creuz from Port Vendres south into Spain crossing near Cerbere. There is also the possibility of a cross Pyrenees route direct from Banyuls towards Le Perthus which would be easier than the coastal path from Cerbere via Cape Creuz to Barcelona.\n\nAl-Idrisi completes his 5th Climate 1st section with a short description of France from Narbonne, Carcassone and Toulouse north to Angouleme and Cahors and across to the west coast at Bordeaux.\n\nTHE SOUTH COAST\n\nThe 4th Climate 1st Section covers the Mediterranean coast of the peninsula southwards from Valencia via Cartagena, Almeria, Malaga, Algeciras (Pillars of Hercules) and thence into the Ocean Ténèbreux with Cadiz, Huelva and Cape St Vincent.\n\nThe west coast is detailed from Cape St Vincent via Lisbon, Coimbra and Oporto to Cape Finisterre. Having described the provinces of Spain distances around the Detroit are described, particularly from Algeciras, which Al-Idrisi appears to utilize as the Spanish Pillar Of Hercules. Following this, Cape St Vincent and the Church of the Raven are bypassed to describe Lisbon and the west coast of Spain (Portugal).\n\nBut at this point Al-Idrisi inserts a story regarding a voyage of exploration undertaken from Lisbon. Paul Lunde in his text, “Pillars of Hercules; Sea of Darkness”, comments as follows; “even more interesting is Al-Idrisi’s account of an actual voyage of exploration into the western Atlantic, undertaken by 80 brave men from Lisbon who he calls the Maghrourin, best rendered as intrepid explorers. The expedition must have taken place before 1147AD, the date Lisbon fell to the Christians- but it is impossible to be more precise. The Maghrourin were so famous for their exploit that a street in Lisbon was named after them”. (I have appended access to the complete story given by him in translation).\n\nBut the fascinating point is that a voyage from Spain prior to 1147 is incorporated in a text by Al-Idrisi dated to 1153 and perhaps indicates it was either a monumental achievement well known to the Arab world or the data passed very quickly across the Mediterranean Sea. It also belies his description of the Mer Ténèbreux as being impossible to sail on which he has stated on several occasions in his text and could indicate a late addition and give greater weight to a date just prior to 1147.\n\nDETAILED COASTAL DESCRIPTION; MATCHING LAND ROUTES\n\ncgId2D17\n\nThe 5th Climate 1st Section commences with a description of the whole northern section and then begins the detailed description of the landscape with the west coast of the Peninsula, Portugal, from Lisbon and Coimbra (inland) to Santiago de Compostella. That is followed by the Cape Finisterre/Cape Ortegal to Bayonne section, the North Coastline already described.\n\nSANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELLA\n\ncgId2D18\n\nBut, why should Santiago De Compostella figure so greatly in this geographical text. Al-Idrisi knew that the Normans were Christians and served the Pope in Rome. In the 9th century the shrine at Santiago became a focus for pilgrims and in the 10th century it was a major pilgrimage site second only to Rome and Jerusalem. The obvious fact being for Europeans it was far easier to walk to. The routes used by these pilgrims were naturally the easiest paths, particularly from France across the Pyrenees. However the Spanish consider the Pyrenees to be a starting point and along the French border there are towns which link to the passes. From Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port the route leads to the pass of Roncevalles and onto Pamplona. The distance from Roncevalles to Santiago de Compostella via Leon (Legio VII Gemina) is c800KM/500miles. The route from Pau via Oloron Ste-Marie leads over the Col du Somport and south to Jaca before turning west to Pamplona as diagram cgId2D18 indicates.\n\nThe text then changes to a description of the interior of the Peninsula with distances from town to town and a second listing of distances from Toledo as follows; Leon/Toledo, 7 days; Burgos/Toledo, 7 days; Sant-Iago/Toledo by the ordinary route, 9 days; Salamanca/Abila 50 milles and onto Segovia another 50 milles.\n\nThe coastal description commences at Tarragona, and from there to Barcelona is given as 50 milles.\n\nThen, Barcelona to Carcassonne in France is given as 4 days, and the distances within France to Bordeaux, Cahors and north to the River Loire and La Rochelle are given.\n\nIn effect the north-east coast of the Peninsula from Tarragona to Cape Creuz is ignored. This is not surprising as the 5th Climate, 1st Section only comprises 13 pages in French translation, whilst the 4th Climate 1st Section comprises 68 pages.\n\nIn the 4th Climate, 1st Section we read; “De Tortose à Tarracona, 50 milles. Tarragone est une ville juive batie sur les bords de la mer. Ses murs sont marbre, ses édificies beaux et ses tours trés-forte. De Tarragone à Barcelone, en se dirigeant vers l’orient, 60 milles.”\n\nBut, in the 5th Climate, 1st Section we read, “De Tortose à Tarragone des juifs, 45 milles. Tarragone est située sur les bords de la mer et ciente d’une muraills qui se compose de blocs de marbre blanc et noir d’une rare beauté. Cette ville, aujord’hui florissante, était autre fois dépeuplée à cause de sa situation limitrophe entre les musulmans et les chrétiens. Elle est jolie, mais on y recontre beaucoup de serpents don’t la morsure est dangereuse. Il y a un bon port et de l’eau douce. De là à Barcelone on compte 50 milles.”\n\nThus in the 4th Climate we now proceed south-westerly along the coast, passing the River Ebro, Valencia, Denia, Alicante, Cartegena, Almeria and onto Malaga where we are informed Almeria to Malaga by Land is 7 days, but by sea it is 180 milles. Then we have, Malaga to Green Island or Algeciras is 100 milles and Marbella on the route to Algeciras is 40 milles.\n\nHereafter the coastal description ends and the interior lands around Cordoba and Seville and as far as Cadiz are described.\n\nTo continue the description of the coast in a logical manner we must return to the commencement of the 4th Climate 1st Section text where after describing the provinces of southern Spain al-Idrisi has commenced his coastal description at the Green Island of Algeciras and then the Detroit and what we would consider the southern coastline of Spain/Portugal, his 5 Day section of coast.\n\nTHE DETROIT, CADIZ AND THE SACRED CAPE\n\ncgId2D19\n\ncgId2D20\n\nThe Detroit is described as being 18 miles across and there is then the original statement, “D’Algéziras à Malaga, 5 journées faibles, c’est-a-dire 100 milles.” We then read the following;\n\n“D’Algéziras à Seville il y a deux routes, l’une par eau, l’autre par terre. Voici la premiere;\n\nD’Algéziras à el-Rommal (Les Sables), à l’embouchure de la riviere de Berbat dans la mer ,28 milles: de là à l’embouchure de la riviere de Beka, 6 milles: de là en Detroit de San-Bitar (San Pedro), 12 milles: de là à el-Canatir (les ponts), vis-à-vis la presqu’île de Gades (Cadiz), 12 milles, (la distance entre ces deux points est 6 milles): D’el-Canatir à Rabeta Rota, 8 milles: de là à el-Mesadjid (San Lucar), 6 milles.\n\nEnsuite on remonte le fleuve en passant par Tarbichana (Trebuxêna), el-O’touf (les détours), Cabtour, Cabtal, (Cabtour et Cabtal sont deux villages situés au milieu du fleuve), Djeziret Ienchtalat, Hissn el-Zahar: puis on arrive à Seville. De cette ville à la mer on compte 60 milles.”\n\nFrom this point the text details the coast from Heulva to Cape St Vincent and finishes as follows; “De là à Chakrach village sur le bord de la mer, 18 milles; de là au cap des Arabes, qui s’avance dans l’Océan, 12 milles; de là à l’eglise du Corbeau, 7 milles. Cette eglise est située sur un promontoire qui s’avance dans la mer.”\n\nThis area, these capes, are indicated by Claudius Ptolemy as a ‘Cuneus’, a triangular spit of land protruding into the Ocean Ténébreux, and Paulus Orosius actually uses the term to describe them. It is thus evident that Al-Idrisi was not convinced of this protrusion, which is not so very evident on the World Map by Ptolemy and probably that of Marinus the Tyrian. However, it is a geographical fact as diagram cgId2D20 illustrated, and as is shown on the map of Iberia drawn to Ptolemaic co-ordinates as cgId2D08. It also illustrates that he did not have an individual map of Spain and did not plot the coastline from the Ptolemaic co-ordinates which were no doubt within his copy of the text.\n\nThat is perhaps the most perplexing point of all. If Al-Idrisi had a full copy of the 8 books by Claudius Ptolemy, why did he not make full use of the data contained therein?\n\nCONCLUSION\n\ncgId2D21\n\nThe text of Al-Idrisi is a tour-de-force in geographical exploration and deserves the highest praise not only for his work but that of Roger 2nd of Sicily in collecting an enormous amount of geographical information to enable the “Book of Roger” to be written.\n\nThat Al-Idrisi knew ‘Al-Andalos’ is evident from his writings, although that evidence also points to a good knowledge of the southern half as opposed to an equal knowledge of the northern half; that is Climate 4 and Climate 5 respectively.\n\nAl-Idrisi also had a propensity for using descriptive nouns to illustrate his textual shape of a given country, and this is where he sadly creates unnecessary problems for future researchers. That he described ‘Al-Andalos’ as a triangle when he evidently knew it was only a metaphor, a very poor metaphor in the circumstances, has been simply illustrated by his own text. It is in fact nearly a square in geographical form.\n\nThat he correctly identified the Mediterranean Coastline length as 1100 miles and the northwest to southeast diagonal length as 600 miles, is a tribute to the careful measurements by the Roman Geometres and their meticulous recording of the town inter-distances. It also indicates the knowledge extant in 1100CE, which although we still have portions of it, we know not what is lost.\n\nWhy he did not choose to use a single method of distance measure is also problematic when the individual routes he describes can be shown to vary considerably in mileage day by day. But in general terms it is obvious the route mileage for the whole of ‘Al-Andalos’ was well known and recorded.\n\nWe must also bear in mind that the Christian world was on the cusp of the first crusade and this could not have been a more awkward time for Al-Idrisi, an Arab, and probably accounts for his effusive descriptions of the Christian towns, particularly those of the Normans.\n\nHowever, the text adds to the sum total of our geographical knowledge of Al-Andalos and is by far the most expansive description available. If only we knew the actual map shape he originally drew?\n\nAPPENDIX 1\n\ncgId2D22\n\ncgId2D23\n\ncgId2D24\n\ncgId2D25\n\nDr Konrad Miller in his text Mappae Arabicae reconstructed the 70 tableaux of Al-Idrisi as a single map, although he used 6 sheets because the overall size id considerable as is discussed in the following text cgId4. Appended here are four pages from the text by Dr Miller, pages 103 to 106 from the second section. He compares the maps of Al-Idrisi and a geographical map but also presents a “perfect” view of his own ideas. The comparison with this text, particularly as Dr Miller appends lines of latitude, which are not possible on the original Tableaux of Al-Idrisi, must be made with this in mind.\n\nAPPENDIX 2\n\ncgId2D26\n\ncgId2D27\n\ncgId2D28\n\nAt the Segon Congres Catala de Geografia, 29-31 de maig de 2008, the following paper appeared.\n\nLA PENINSULA IBERICA EN el gran ATLAS DE al-Idrisi, by Juan Piqueras y Ghaleb Fansa of the Departement de Geografia, Universitat de Valencia.\n\nThe text is in Spanish and includes diagrams which will aid researchers of the text of Al-Idrisi. The place names of Al-Idrisi are translated where possible and cross referenced to the text of Dr K Miller. The diagrams are here-in appended to aid an understanding of the Iberian Peninsula as Al-Idrisi saw it.\n\nThe complete text and diagrams are available on line.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nGEOGRAPHIE D’EDRISI, TRADUIRE PAR PIERRE AMEDEE JAUBERT.
