        "text": "Journal Entry:\n\nI studied abroad in Salamanca, Spain before my junior year of college. I had a wonderful Spanish teacher named Imelda, who was incredibly kind and caring. My classmates and I were sad to leave her, and as a farewell during our last class, she went around to each of us and we kissed each other's cheeks. It felt strange, as I would never hug - let alone kiss - any of my professors in the U.S. However, it was completely normal for Imelda, and having such a warm, friendly relationship with a professor was a nice change.\n\nWhen I arrived in Spain this past September, I stayed in an Airbnb for a couple of days with a woman named Alicia. I had never met her before. At the door of her apartment, I greeted her with an outstretched hand out of habit, while she went in to kiss me on both cheeks. It was a little awkward, to say the least! During my orientation program a few days later, we talked about how this greeting was something that we needed to expect. Kissing someone on both cheeks isn't something that you just do with family members, friends or a kind teacher - it's something that you do with everyone.\n\nLater that evening, I met my boss Brendan for the first time. We greeted each other with a kiss on each cheek.\n\nPages"
