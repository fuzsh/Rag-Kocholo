As a foundation for systematic and paleoecological work, we describe 51 angiosperm leaf morphotypes from three distinct, precisely dated early to late Danian time intervals, using collections from the Salamanca and Peñas Coloradas formations in the San Jorge Basin, Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina. These rich floras were previously analyzed but with minimal descriptions. The assemblages comprise the first stratigraphically controlled and quantitatively collected floras for the early Paleocene of the Southern Hemisphere. Botanical affinities of the angiosperm morphotypes are not formally assigned here, but we informally associate some of them with families including Arecaceae, Fabaceae, Cunoniaceae, Lauraceae, Nothofagaceae, Rhamnaceae, and Rosaceae; in addition, leaves of Menispermaceae and other Rhamnaceae were formally described in previous work. Other families potentially present in these assemblages include Akaniaceae, Anacardiaceae, Apiaceae, Araceae, Bixaceae, Juglandaceae, Malvaceae, Sapindaceae, and Urticaceae. Remarkably, there is little floral turnover or change in dominance through the Danian floral sequence spanned by the studied localities, even among estuarine vs. continental depositional environments. This finding indicates a homogeneous, generalist, long-lived floral association following the K-Pg extinction, similar in these respects to many North American Danian floras. However, the richness of the Danian Patagonian floras, from paleolatitudes >50 degrees South, along with other lines of evidence from the region, suggests differences in the response of terrestrial ecosystems in southern South America to the terminal Cretaceous event from those of the Northern Hemisphere. The flora appears to be largely paleo-endemic in nature and shows several compositional links to the Eocene floras of Patagonia, emphasizing the importance of diversification within Patagonia after the end-Cretaceous event as a factor leading to the hyperdiverse Eocene regional floras.\n\nAri Iglesias.

This paucity of information has impaired our understanding of floral recovery over a vast area of the planet following the globally disruptive end-Cretaceous extinction event.\n\nThe presence of Paleocene macrofloras in the Salamanca Formation of southern Chubut Province, Argentina, has long been known (Berry, 1937a), but for many decades they were the focus of few studies, and their precise ages remained uncertain (see Clyde et al., 2014). Most paleobotanical work from the Salamanca Formation had focused on the abundantly preserved, permineralized fossil wood and occasional fruits that so far represent relatively few, though significant, taxa of conifers and angiosperms (Petriella, 1972; Petriella and Archangelsky, 1975; Romero, 1968; Ragonese, 1980; Brea et al., 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011; Futey et al., 2012; Ruiz et al., 2017, 2020). More recently, several macrofloral compression assemblages from the Salamanca and overlying Peñas Coloradas formations were intensively collected in the vicinity of Sarmiento, southern Chubut, and found to be outstandingly preserved and diverse (Brea and Zucol, 2006; Iglesias, 2007; Iglesias et al., 2007; Raigemborn et al., 2009). These floras, dominated by fossil angiosperm leaves, are also now well-dated to the early and late Danian based on numerous new chronostratigraphic constraints (Table 1), and they have been paleoenvironmentally interpreted based on high-resolution stratigraphic and facies analyses (Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015; Table 1).\n\nThe exquisitely preserved Salamanca and Peñas Coloradas compression floras have been the focus of several recent systematic and paleoecological studies, significantly increasing the understanding of early Paleocene floral composition and ecosystems in Patagonia. Among gymnosperms, the Salamanca Formation produced associated leafy branches, pollen cones, ovuliferous complexes, and seeds of the oldest known Agathis Salisbury, 1807 (Araucariaceae; Escapa et al., 2018); leafy branches with in situ cuticles of the oldest taxon attributable to the scale-leaved clade of Podocarpaceae (Andruchow-Colombo et al., 2018); and the oldest record of the podocarp genus Dacrycarpus (Endlicher) de Laubenfels, 1969 (Quiroga et al., 2016). Angiosperm taxa described from the Salamanca Formation include wood and an associated leaflet of Fabaceae Lindley, 1836 (Brea et al., 2008); associated flowers and leaves of the first fossil Rhamnaceae Jussieu, 1789, known from the Southern Hemisphere (Jud et al., 2017); flowers with in situ pollen of Tribe Schizomerieae Bradford and Barnes, 2001 (Cunoniaceae Brown, 1814 nom. cons., Jud et al., 2018a); and the oldest Menispermaceae Jussieu, 1789 nom. cons. endocarp, associated with a diagnostic leaf of the family (Jud et al., 2018b). In addition fertile sporophytes of the aquatic fern Azolla Lamarck, 1783 were recently reported (Hermsen et al., 2019). Insect-feeding damage on the fossil angiosperm and conifer leaves supported the first analyses of the effects of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction on plant-insect food webs in the Southern Hemisphere (Donovan et al., 2016, 2018, 2020). The leaf floras of Iglesias et al. (2007) have also been used in several other paleoecological and paleoclimatic studies (Labandeira et al., 2007; Wing et al., 2009; Feild et al., 2011; Peppe et al., 2011, Hinojosa et al., 2011), including a related paper that is the first quantitative analysis of K-Pg macrofloral turnover in Patagonia (Stiles et al., 2020).\n\nAlthough the Danian Patagonian leaf floras have supported many advances in our understanding of early Paleocene floral diversity and composition in the region, the extensive angiosperm leaf collections have so far only been described in preliminary form and only from one site (Palacio de los Loros; Iglesias et al., 2007). These collections have since expanded in number of specimens and localities, and they now represent the most abundant and diverse Danian compression floras for the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nHere, we take a critical step toward elevating our understanding of the informative Danian floras of Patagonia and their broader systematic, evolutionary, and biogeographic research potential by establishing a descriptive framework and inventory for the diverse morphotypes of angiosperm leaf compressions of the Salamanca and Peñas Coloradas formations. The descriptions presented here document the angiosperm leaf morphotypes and establish them as recognizable, vouchered entities across the large Danian collections from different sites and formations. This morphotype approach has already proven beneficial for associated angiosperm leaves and reproductive organs of Menispermaceae and Rhamnaceae from the floras studied here (e.g., Jud et al., 2017, 2018b) and, in general, in many other deposits around the world (e.g., Johnson et al., 1989). We briefly interpret the leaf morphotypes with regard to recovery from the end-Cretaceous extinction and floral turnover through the Danian of Patagonia; however, this issue is explored in subtantially more detail in a related paper (Stiles et al., 2020).\n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTING\n\nThe fossil floras studied here come from the westernmost exposures of Paleocene strata in the north-central San Jorge Basin, southern Chubut Province, Argentina (Figure 1) at a paleolatitude of ca. 51⁰S as detailed in several recent papers (Iglesias et al., 2007; Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015) and summarized here. The fossil sites (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4; Table 1) are located in natural outcrops of two formations: the estuarine, early Danian Salamanca Formation; and the overlying, fluvio-volcanic, late Danian Peñas Coloradas Formation of the Río Chico Group. The chronostratigraphic framework for these formations in the study area is based on U-Pb and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology; paleomagnetic stratigraphy; and biostratigraphy of foraminifera, dinocysts, calcareous nanoplankton, and palynomorphs (Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015; Krause et al., 2017). This information, coupled with detailed facies analyses of the depositional environments of the fossil plant localities (Comer et al., 2015), provides robust geological constraints on all the fossil quarries discussed in this paper (Table 1).\n\nThe bulk of the Salamanca Formation in the study area lies below an unconformity (interpreted as a sequence boundary) and is correlated to geomagnetic polarity Chron C29n (early Danian, 65.58-64.86 Ma per Gradstein et al., 2012; Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015). The sediments above the sequence boundary are constrained to Chron C28n (early Danian, 64.67-63.49 Ma). The entire Salamanca package represents sedimentation from a paleo-Atlantic estuarine system transitioning in its upper section to fluvially influenced mudstones from landward tidal channels and eventually coastal swamps (Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015). Some of the most landward fossiliferous strata derived from tidal channels contain quarry PL2 (Figure 2; Iglesias et al., 2007), preserving the most prolific and well-preserved fossil assemblage studied here. All Salamanca Formation leaf floras conspicuously preserve the trace fossil Cochlichnus Hitchcock, 1858, representing underwater burrows parallel to substrate. The capping unit of the Salamanca Formation is the Banco Negro Inferior (BNI, Figure 2A, Figure 3A), a widespread coastal swamp deposit that is well known for preserving significant mammal and reptile occurrences in its eastern exposures at Punta Peligro along the modern coast (Figure 1; Bonaparte et al., 1993; Pascual et al., 2002; Sterli and de la Fuente, 2012). The BNI may be a time-transgressive unit, becoming younger toward the east where the fossil vertebrates are preserved (Krause et al., 2017). In our study area, the late Danian Peñas Coloradas Formation sits uncomformably above the BNI. The fossil flora studied here from the base of the Peñas Coloradas Formation at the Las Flores fossil-plant locality (LF, Figure 1, Figure 4) is assigned to Chron C27n (62.52-62.22 Ma; Clyde et al., 2014). Thus, the assemblages discussed here fall into three Danian time intervals, namely Chrons C29n (lower Salamanca floras), C28n (upper Salamanca floras), and C27n (Las Flores flora; Table 1).\n\nFossil floras of the Salamanca Formation discussed here come from the Palacio de los Loros (PL) and Ormachea Petrified Forest Park (OR; also known as the Bosque Petrificado José Ormachea or the Monumento Provincial Bosque Petrificado Sarmiento) localities, as described previously (Iglesias 2007; Iglesias et al., 2007; Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015; Table 1; Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Compressed fossil plants from Palacio de los Loros were first collected by A. Piatnitzky in the 1930s (see Feruglio 1949 page 316) and described by Berry (1937a; “Cerro Funes” flora), who published 11 species (Table 2) from a single site that we could not precisely relocate. The PL1 and PL2 macrofossil localities (quarries) from Palacio de los Loros were discovered and first studied by Iglesias et al. (2007), whereas the PL3, PL4, and PL5 quarries were both discovered and collected later (Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015, Figure 4C). Among these more recent collections, the PL4 flora is the best preserved and was quantitatively collected (i.e., all identifiable material was collected; Table 1). Quarry PL2 is very fine-grained and also preserves many delicate flowers (Jud et al., 2018a), other plant reproductive material (Escapa et al., 2018; Jud et al., 2018b), leafy branches (Andruchow-Colombo et al., 2018), feathers (Tambussi and Degrange, 2013), and unpublished insect wings and bivalves. We note that the Rancho Grande flora, from a very different inner-shelf depositional environment of the Salamanca Formation assigned to Chron C29n (early Danian, 65.58-64.86 Ma, Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015), is under separate study (e.g., Jud et al., 2017) and not covered here.\n\nFossil floras from OR were found at several quarries in the Salamanca Formation (Table 1): Ormachea-1 (OR1), Ormachea-2 (OR2, including the subsite Cerro de las Palmeras CP), Cerro Solitario (CS), and Dromedary Hill (DR) (Iglesias, 2007; Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015). Quarry OR2 is the best preserved local assemblage, found in heterolithic cross-bedded sandstones correlated to Chron C29n along with the CS quarry (early Danian, 65.58-64.86 Ma, Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015, Figure 3A); quarry CP, located in the lower Salamanca Formation, appears to be of similar age. Fossil quarries OR1 and DR are all composed of heterolithic cross-bedded sandstones from Chron C28n (early Danian, 64.67-63.49 Ma, Clyde et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015, Figure 3B-C).\n\nThe late Danian (Chron C27n, 62.52-62.22 Ma) flora was collected and field-censused at the Las Flores oil field quarry (LF) paleobotanical locality, at the La Campanita Ranch (Figure 1), corresponding to the base of the Peñas Coloradas Formation (Figure 4A-B). This site is geographically close to—but contains strata much older than—the overlying Eocene to Neogene sequence of fossil vertebrate localities along the Gran Barranca from the Las Flores and Sarmiento formations (e.g., Ameghino, 1906; Dunn et al., 2013; Woodburne et al., 2014; Krause et al., 2017). The LF flora occurs in fine-to-coarse sand channel-fill facies of a mixed-load ﬂuvial system, containing a high proportion of volcanic clasts (Iglesias, 2007; Legarreta and Uliana, 1994; Raigemborn, 2005, 2006; Raigemborn et al., 2014; Comer et al., 2015). At the LF plant locality, Clyde et al. (2014) recorded terrestrial palynomorphs and a small number of dynocysts, indicating minor marine influence with low salinity. The only previously studied fossil plants from the Peñas Coloradas Formation include a few specimens of cunoniaceous flowers (Jud et al. 2018a), a single species of petrified wood assigned to Cordioxylon Awasthi, 1984 (Boraginaceae Adanson, 1763), and dispersed phytoliths from sites to the east, along the modern coast (Brea and Zucol, 2006; Raigemborn et al., 2009).\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe small type collection of 11 species from Palacio de los Loros (Berry, 1937a; Table 2), housed at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington, DC (acronym USNM), was examined at USNM and in the Penn State Paleobotany Laboratory.\n\nWe made the collections studied here over several field seasons (2003-2012) from bench quarries, using standard field reconnaissance to find the sites, hand tools, and occasionally a portable pneumatic hammer. The fossiliferous localities (Table 1) were collected selectively at first, but those that showed abundant and well-preserved material were also quantitatively censused (all identifiable material collected and brought to the museum for tallying) and field-labeled with unique field numbers (Iglesias et al., 2007). Census samples included 1,093 angiosperm leaves (or leaflets for compound leaves) for quarry PL1; 1,189 for PL2; 380 for PL4; 168 for OR2; and 597 for LF, for a total of 3,522 leaf-fossil specimens (Table 1) collected and accessioned at Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio (MEF, Trelew, Argentina, repository acronym MPEF-Pb). In addition to the unique field number labeled for each specimen, many received a formal MPEF-Pb catalog number as well (Appendix 1).\n\nFossils were prepared with needles and air tools at the Museo de Ciencias Naturales de La Plata (MLP, La Plata, Argentina) and MEF; MEF is the repository for all collections described here, other than the Berry (1937a) types at USNM. Specimens were observed using a Wild M5 stereoscope at MLP and a Nikon SMZ-1000 stereoscope at MEF, both with camera lucida attachments for drawings. All photography was done using a Nikon Coolpix 8800 digital camera, connected to a stereoscope when higher magnification was required.\n\nWe used standard terminology for leaf architectural descriptions (Hickey, 1973, 1979; Hickey and Wolfe, 1975; Ash et al., 1999; Ellis et al., 2009). Foliar rank is indicated if lower than 3r, to emphasize the visual distinctiveness of the morphotypes with relatively poor vein organization (Hickey, 1971; Green et al., 2014; Little et al., 2014). Sinus-bracing veins are used in the sense of Upchurch and Dilcher (1990) for lobed leaf forms. The term “leaf texture” (per Hickey, 1973) is used here, not to infer features of the once-living leaf, but to indicate directly observed variation in leaf preservation, resulting from some combination of original leaf properties and taphonomic processes, that we found useful in identification. When preservation permitted, vein density was measured based on standard techniques and is given as previously reported for most of these species in Feild et al. (2011).\n\nThe leaves were divided into morphotypes based on shared leaf architectural characters, following the procedures of Johnson et al. (1989) and Ash et al. (1999) and a conservative, “lumping” approach. Morphotyping is a well-established parataxonomic method that is widely used as an organizational step for investigating large, diverse, and newly collected fossil leaf floras for which much taxonomic work remains to be done, as is the case here. In practice, morphotypes may or may not correspond to preliminary approximations of biological species, but here we view each one as a likely species equivalent. Illustrating the value of the method, two Salamanca Formation angiosperm leaf morphotypes have already advanced to formally described botanical entities (Jud et al., 2017, 2018b), as well as several fern and conifer morphotypes (see Introduction). Each morphotype is designated with the two-letter prefix “SA”, plus a unique three-digit number, and is assigned a single exemplar and one or more accessory exemplar specimens to provide a reference set and potential future type specimens. The informal exemplars are chosen entirely from our field collections for comparative purposes, and in some instances they are listed in addition to previous formal type specimens of the same entity (Berry, 1937a).\n\nMorphotypes are simply presented as assigned in numerical, not systematic order, first for non-monocot (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15, Figure 16, Figure 17, Figure 18, Figure 19, Figure 20, Figure 21, Figure 22, Figure 23, Figure 24, Figure 25, Figure 26, Figure 27, Figure 28, Figure 29, Figure 30, Figure 31, Figure 32, Figure 33, Figure 34, Figure 35, Figure 36, Figure 37, Figure 38, Figure 39, Figure 40) and then for monocot angiosperms (Figure 40-Figure 41). We note that there are several “missing” morphotype numbers that variously pertain to combined or to non-angiosperm morphotypes, some of these now published formally (e.g., SA018 as Agathis immortalis Escapa, Iglesias, Wilf, Catalano, Carballo-Ortiz and Cúneo, 2018; SA062 as Dacrycarpus sp. in Quiroga et al., 2016, figure 1a-1c; and SA071 as Kirketapel salamanquensis Andruchow-Colombo, Escapa, Carpenter, Iglesias, Arbazua and Wilf, 2018), and several not yet published, including ferns (see Iglesias, 2007). To avoid disrupting the museum catalog and to maintain consistency with prior and ongoing work (e.g., Iglesias et al., 2007; Donovan et al., 2016, 2018; Stiles et al., 2020), we have left the numbering gaps and not changed any morphotype numbers. A complete inventory of referred specimens for all morphotypes is provided in Appendix 1 and an identification key to the morphotypes in Appendix 2. We note in the descriptions below all morphotypes that appear to represent the same entities as the Berry (1937a) types (see also Table 2).\n\nAll material that is cited and figured here (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15, Figure 16, Figure 17, Figure 18, Figure 19, Figure 20, Figure 21, Figure 22, Figure 23, Figure 24, Figure 25, Figure 26, Figure 27, Figure 28, Figure 29, Figure 30, Figure 31, Figure 32, Figure 33, Figure 34, Figure 35, Figure 36, Figure 37, Figure 38, Figure 39, Figure 40, Figure 41) is assigned repository numbers (acronyms USNM and MPEF-Pb), whereas material from the large general collection is mostly listed by field number (Appendix 1). Table 1 summarizes fossil quarries by time interval (geomagnetic polarity chron based on Clyde et al., 2014 and Comer et al., 2015) and lists morphotype occurrences and relative abundances by locality. Possible botanical affinities for some of the morphotypes are indicated for general interest and briefly discussed, but we stress that the suggested affinities are still preliminary pending further investigation, and the focus here is on establishing descriptive categories and a large set of voucher specimens as a robust foundation for improved understanding of the Danian fossil floras of Patagonia, including formal systematic work. Preliminary taxonomic discussions of many of the angiosperm leaf morphotypes appeared in the lead author’s Ph.D. thesis (Iglesias, 2007), and systematic studies of individual leaf species are the topics of separate investigations (Jud et al., 2017, 2018a, 2018b).\n\nNON-MONOCOT LEAF MORPHOTYPES\n\nMorphotype SA001\n\nAffinity. Akaniaceae? Stapf, 1912 nom. cons.\n\nExemplar. MPEF-PB-2020 from quarry PL2 (Figure 5B, H)\n\nFigure 5\n\nDescription. Blade symmetric, size microphyll, mean length 7.1 (5.7-8.5) cm, mean width 2.4 (1.5-3.8) cm. Length:width ratio 3.7:1 (3.6-3.8:1). Margin dentate. Petiole/petiolule insertion marginal, length > 1.6 cm, disposed at an angle to the main blade axis (Figure 5B, G-H). Blade shape ovate. Texture chartaceous. Base shape decurrent, angle acute (Figure 5B). Apex shape straight, angle acute (Figure 5C-D). Primary venation pinnate, primary stout, straight in course, tapering apically (Figure 5D). Basal veins three. Agrophic veins absent. Secondary venation semicraspedodromous, thin, course slightly curved, joining supradjacent secondaries via successive loops and near-perpendicular junctions. Spacing between secondaries uniform and subopposite. Secondaries decurrent on midvein (Figure 5A). Perimarginal venation a thick fimbrial vein, to 0.2 mm in width, thickening the margin and presumably stiffening the teeth (Figure 5J). Intersecondary veins thin, perpendicular to midvein, less than half of the subjacent secondary in length, becoming perpendicular to subjacent secondary in distal course, frequency one to less than one per secondary (Figure 5G). Intercostal tertiary venation random reticulate to weakly percurrent, course convex or straight, obtuse to midvein (Figure 5F). Epimedial tertiary venation mixed percurrent, course obtuse to midvein and approximately perpendicular to secondaries (Figure 5G). Fourth order veins nearly as thick in gauge as tertiaries, regular polygonal reticulate. Fifth order veins regular polygonal reticulate, tending to opposite percurrent (Figure 5F). Areoles polygonal, size medium (0.3-1 mm width), poorly developed, randomly oriented. Idioblasts (preserved as dark dots) common (Figure 5E). Teeth large, variable in size, simple, spinose, some recurved towards apex, length to 2 mm, width to 2 mm, absent near leaf base and best developed in medial to distal portions of the blade. Tooth shape concave/convex, concave/concave, concave/flexuous, or straight/convex; sinuses rounded (Figure 5F). Tooth spacing uniform, up to two-three teeth per secondary vein and up to four teeth per centimeter, absent at leaf base (Figure 5A-B, D). Tooth venation originates from an exterior tertiary branch derived from a secondary loop. Principal vein basally deflected or running near the tooth basal flank, course slightly curved (Figure 5F).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA001 has a consistently angled petiole/petiolule that may indicate derivation from a compound leaf. Similarities to Akania Hooker, 1862 [in Bentham and Hooker, 1862] (Akaniaceae) include non-glandular, spinose teeth, secondaries that join at right angles, intersecondaries reaching brochidodromous arches, tooth and sinus venation with a principal vein running along the tooth basal flank and originating from a tertiary branch that bifurcates at the tooth base at an acute angle, and an intramarginal vein supplying accessory tooth venation. The living A. bidwillii (Hogg) Mabberley, 1989 (east Australia), differs from morphotype SA001 in having oblong, elongated leaflets, poorly developed secondary vein loops, and teeth that are more and irregularly spaced. The family is represented in the fossil record of Patagonia by two Eocene leaf species: Akania americana Romero and Hickey, 1976, and A. patagonica Gandolfo, Dibbern, and Romero, 1988, both from the early Eocene Laguna del Hunco flora (Romero and Hickey, 1976; Gandolfo et al., 1988; Wilf et al., 2005), and a Miocene wood (Brea et al., 2018). The two fossil leaf species share with morphotype SA001 the length:width ratio, acute base, toothed margin except at the base, angled petiole (petiolule), tooth characters and venation, fimbrial vein, and secondary venation. Morphotype SA001 is similar to the Eocene species but with a more ovate shape and a cuneate/decurrent base. Characters that in combination easily differentiate this morphotype from all others (see key in supplementary Appendix 2) include: blade ovate; secondary veins semicraspedodromous; teeth simple, recurved, spinose; basal portion of blade untoothed; and fimbrial vein present.\n\nMorphotype SA002\n\nAffinity.

Freely ending veinlets (FEVs) one- or two-branched (Figure 6H). Marginal ultimate venation looped. Teeth simple, occasionally spinose, length to 0.5 mm, width to 0.3 mm (Figure 6I, K-L, N). Tooth shape concave/convex, concave/straight, straight/convex, or flexuous/straight; sinuses rounded, sometimes angular (Figure 6I, N). Tooth spacing uniform, two-three per centimeter or secondary vein (Figure 6M). Tooth venation supplied by one of the branches of the forked secondary vein entering the tooth medially, or by a secondary branch that forks at the tooth base, generating an apical branch to the supradjacent sinus (Figure 6I, K-L, N). Medial vein slightly curved toward the tooth apex, occasionally projected out of the margin as a spine.\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA002 occurs at low abundance and is known from quarries PL1 and PL2 (Salamanca Formation, Table 1). Its distinguishing characters include: blade elliptic to weakly ovate, secondary veins basally and apically crowded, tertiary veins somewhat chevroned near the primary vein, fimbrial vein well developed, and teeth regularly spaced (see key in supplementary Appendix 2).\n\nMorphotype SA004\n\nEquivalent. “Dryophyllum” australis Berry, 1937 in part, syntype USNM-208523 (Berry, 1937a, plate VI, figure 5; here Figure 7B) only (Table 2); syntype USNM-208522 excluded (see morphotype SA042).\n\nAffinity.

Blade symmetric or weakly asymmetric; size notophyll to mesophyll, generally microphyll; mean length 7.6 (3.5-11) cm, mean width 4.4 (2.2-8) cm, length:width ratio 1.8:1 (1.5-2:1). Margin serrate, often not well preserved (Figure 7F, K). Petiole insertion marginal, base sometimes swollen, length to 1 cm, width to 1.5 mm. Texture membranaceous. Shape ovate (Figure 7C, G). Apex shape convex or weakly concave, angle acute. Base shape convex, rarely rounded; angle obtuse. Primary venation pinnate, primary vein thinner near middle of blade and dichotomizing at the apex, course sinuous, occasionally deflected at secondary junctions (Figure 7B, F, K). Agrophic veins present, simple or compound (Figure 7H, 7L-M). Secondary venation craspedodromous; veins in 10-12 pairs; width moderate; opposite or subopposite to midvein; angle acute and uniform or slightly increasing toward the base (Figure 7H), often asymmetric on either side of primary (Figure 7C); secondary vein course straight, then curving smoothly towards the margin and generating two or three curving basal branches that enter minor teeth or their supradjacent sinuses (Figure 7E, H). Perimarginal and intersecondary veins absent. Intercostal tertiary venation weak, mixed opposite-alternate percurrent; densely spaced; course very straight; angle uniform, sometimes increasing basally. Epimedial tertiary venation opposite percurrent, course curved, perpendicular or obtuse to midvein (Figure 7J). Fourth order and fifth order veins regular polygonal reticulate (Figure 7E). Areolation moderately developed. Freely ending veinlets not observed. Vein density range 7.59-11.69 mm/mm2. Marginal ultimate venation looped, loops sometimes incomplete (Figure 7E). Teeth simple or compound (Figure 7E, I), length to 5 mm, may be simple or appear in two orders; tooth apex simple or shortly mucronate. Tooth shape convex/convex for simple teeth, convex/convex or flexuous/flexuous for compound teeth, which have two-three minor teeth on the basal flank and one-two on the apical flank. Sinuses angular (Figure 7E). Tooth spacing uniform, at approximately four per centimeter (Figure 7D). Tooth venation with a medial principal vein, course straight or slightly curved; medial vein emits branches to the minor teeth and generates loops toward tooth margins; one basal accessory vein often arises from the subjacent sinus (Figure 7E, I).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA004 is present through all three Paleocene time intervals in this study (Table 1). It is referrable to one (USNM-208523, Figure 7B) of the two type specimens of “Dryophyllum” australis Berry, 1937 from Palacio de los Loros (Berry, 1937a; Iglesias et al., 2007). The numerous (192; Table 1) new specimens reported here are more completely preserved than Berry’s fragmentary types, showing higher order venation and better details of the margin and teeth. The other syntype (USNM-208522, Figure 7A) differs from USNM-208523 and the new specimens presented here. USNM-208522 is equivalent to Fagophyllum dusenii Berry, 1937a (morphotype SA042 here), leaving USNM-208523 as the sole type specimen that matches Berry’s written description of “Dryophyllum” australis.\n\nJones et al. (1988) re-described type specimens of Dryophyllum Debey ex Saporta, 1862 from the Paleocene of France, emended the generic diagnosis, and concluded that the type material has juglandaceous affinities. However, the emended diagnosis of Jones et al. (1988) does not match the characters observed in “D.” australis (and our morphotype SA004), and thus we use quotations for the generic name here until the present taxon is formally revised. Morphotype SA004 has leaf architecture that better matches Nothofagaceae Kuprianova, 1962 and Betulaceae Gray, 1822 nom. cons., such as ovate leaf shape, compound teeth with medial principal veins, stout primary veins that are deflected at secondary junctions, agrophic veins, and strongly percurrent tertiaries. The accessory vein of the teeth arises from the sinus, as in extant Nothofagus alessandri Espinosa, 1926 of South America.\n\nMorphotype SA004 is similar to many fossils assigned to Nothofagus Blume, 1851 nom. cons. from the Cretaceous and Paleogene of Chile, Argentina, and Antarctica, including N. magellanica (Engelhardt) Dusén, 1908; N. elongata Dusén, 1908; N. variabilis Dusén, 1908; and N. subferruginea (Dusén) Tanai, 1986 (Engelhardt, 1891; Dusén 1907, Romero and Dibbern 1985, Tanai 1986). Among these fossil species, the large-leaved N. zastawniakiae Dutra (in Dutra and Batten, 2000) from Antarctica has the closest morphology to morphotype SA004.\n\nMorphotype SA005\n\nAffinity. Cunoniaceae? Brown, 1814 nom. cons.\n\nExemplar. MPEF-PB-2023 from quarry PL2 (Figure 8C-E).\n\nFigure 8\n\nDescription. Blade medially symmetrical, base slightly asymmetrical; size microphyll to notophyll, generally microphyll, mean length 6.3 (2.5-8) cm, mean width 2.0 (0.5-2.7) cm. Length:width ratio 4:1 (3.7-4.2). Margin dentate. Petiole insertion marginal, angled to the main leaf axis (Figure 8B, L). Shape ovate-lanceolate (Figure 8B, D, F). Apex shape straight; angle narrow-acute (Figure 8B, D, F). Base shape decurrent, angle acute (Figure 8B, D, L). Primary venation pinnate, primary vein stout, course slightly curved. Basal veins three, the medial vein and one pair of acute basal secondaries (Figure 8D). Agrophic veins absent. Secondary venation semicraspedodromous to weakly brochidodromous toward the apex, loops thin close to blade margin, with 13-15 moderately curved vein pairs, subopposite to midvein, spacing increasing towards base (Figure 8D, F). Secondaries at acute angles to midvein, smoothly decreasing towards the base. Secondaries decurrent on midvein. Perimarginal venation a fimbrial vein well-developed at base (Figure 8B, D), tapering apically. Intersecondary veins thin, proximally parallel to major secondaries, course irregular (Figure 8D, F), length less than half of subjacent secondary, frequency one or more per secondary. Intercostal tertiary venation random reticulate to opposite percurrent (Figure 8C, F, L). Epimedial tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, course straight or convex with high divergence angle from midvein, angle increasing basally (Figure 8F). Fourth and fifth order veins regular polygonal reticulate (Figure 8H). Areolation moderately developed, shape pentagonal. Marginal ultimate venation looped (Figure 8H). Teeth small, not present at base of blade, very reduced in smaller leaves (Figure 6B). Apex always with a darkened gland (Figure 8G-H, J). Tooth shape convex/convex or straight/convex, sinuses angular. Tooth spacing uniform, three to five per centimeter (Figure 8J, M). Tooth venation supplied by a medial principal vein arising from a secondary branch that departs from secondary vein loops near the tooth base; accessory venation looped (Figure 8G, H, K).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA005 is present in all three time intervals studied here (Table 1). SA005 compares most closely with SA001 but differs in having a thick fimbrial vein along the full margin, more organized secondaries, and overall smaller tooth size. The asymmetrical base and blade of morphotype SA005 indicate a probable origin from a compound leaf, which along with the cunonioid teeth (Hickey and Wolfe, 1975) and minor order venation indicate a probable affinity with Cunoniaceae nom. cons. The presence of Cunoniaceae in the Paleogene of Patagonia is well established from Schizomerieae flowers from several of the same localities in the Salamanca and Peñas Coloradas formations (Jud et al., 2018a; see Introduction) and fruits assigned to Ceratopetalum Smith, 1793 from the early Eocene Laguna del Hunco site (Gandolfo and Hermsen, 2017).\n\nMorphotype SA008\n\nAffinity. Rosaceae Jussieu, 1789.\n\nExemplar. MPEF-PB-2024 from quarry PL1 (Figure 9A).\n\nFigure 9\n\nDescription. Blade symmetrical; size nanophyll to mesophyll, generally microphyll; mean length 5.0 (2.0-10.0) cm, mean width 3.0 (0.8-5.9) cm, length:width ratio (1:1-2.6:1). Margin dentate. Petiole insertion marginal; petiole stout, base swollen, long, up to half of blade length (Figure 9I-J). Shape ovate. Apex shape straight or convex, angle acute (Figure 9A, C, F). Base shape concave, angle obtuse (Figure 9B-C). Primary venation pinnate. Primary vein moderate in thickness, course straight to leaf apex (Figure 9A-D). Basal veins one or three (when the first pair of basal secondaries arises basally, Figure 9C, E-F). Agrophic veins compound, irrigating basal teeth (Figure 9E, J). Secondary venation craspedodromous, veins in seven to nine opposite to subopposit vein pairs, spacing smoothly increasing toward base; angle acute and regular (Figure 9A-G, J). Secondaries bifurcate close to the margin: one branch irrigates a tooth medially, and the other branch reaches the supradjacent sinus (Figure 9B-C, K). Secondaries decurrent on midvein (Figure 9B-C, N). Perimarginal venation absent. Intersecondary veins generally absent, sometimes weakly expressed. Intercostal tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, becoming random reticulate toward margin (Figure 9H-K). Epimedial tertiary venation chevroned at base (Figure 9J), weakly opposite percurrent; course straight to convex with perpendicular departure from midvein. Departure angle increasing exmedially (Figure 9J-K). Fourth order veins regular polygonal reticulate. Marginal ultimate venation looped. Teeth compound, with up to three orders (Figure 9E-F). Tooth shape wide triangular; convex/convex, convex/straight, convex/flexuous, or flexuous/flexuous; sinuses angular (Figure 9L). Tooth spacing uniform, one per centimeter. Tooth venation supplied by a medial principal vein corresponding to a branch of a secondary vein; lateral branches of the medial vein run to the supradjacent sinus with a curved course and fork, innerviating both sinus flanks; minor venation of the tooth is in several orders (Figure 9L-M).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA008 is present through all three Paleocene time intervals in this study (Table 1). The distinctive characteristics of morphoytpe SA008 are the craspedodromous secondaries that irrigate the teeth and send apical branches to the sinus or to minor teeth, the deeply incised compound teeth, and the compound agrophic veins, giving an overall morphology indistinguishable from living Rosaceae Jussieu, 1789 such as Crataegus Linnaeus, 1753 nom. cons. The leaves demonstrate a wide but continuous range of size and architecture, also similar to Crataegus. Larger leaves are markedly ovate, with dissected margins (Figure 9J). Fossils similar to SA008 have been described from the latest Cretaceous of Patagonia, including an identical morphotype from the Lefipán Formation (Stiles et al., 2020) and “Cissus” guidoensis Hünicken, 1995 from the Cerro Cazador Formation (Hünicken, 1995).\n\nMorphotype SA009\n\nEquivalent. “Cissites” patagonica Berry, 1937 in part: syntypes USNM-201955 (Berry, 1937a, plate VII, figure 1; here Figure 10N), USNM-201956 (Berry, 1937a, plate VII, figure 2; here Figure 10.O-P), and USNM-201957 (Berry, 1937a, plate VII, figure 3; here Figure 10Q) only (Table 2); syntype USNM-201959 excluded (see morphotype SA073).\n\nAffinities.

Blade symmetric or medially asymmetric, highly variable in size and shape; size nanophyll to macrophyll, generally mesophyll; mean length 7.7 (2.0-16.0) cm, mean width 5.7 (1.5-11.2) cm; length:width ratio (1:1-1.5:1). Margin finely serrate. Petiole base swollen, insertion marginal, length to 5 cm, width to 2 mm (Figure 10A, D, I, Figure 11K, M). Shape varies from ovate unlobed to palmately 3-lobed. Apex shape convex to straight, occasionally concave if not well extended; angle acute. Base shape convex in narrow leaves (Figure 10J-M), rounded in wide leaves (Figure 10A, C-D, N); angle obtuse. Primary venation pinnate, midvein course straight. Basal veins five (Figure 10A-I). Agrophic veins may be simple in lobed leaves (Figure 10A-B, G-H, Figure 11A) or compound in unlobed leaves (Figure 10E, J-M, Figure 11B, D, L), and developed as semicraspedodromous. Secondary venation craspedodromous, with five to nine pairs of opposite to subopposite excurrent veins, the two basal pairs slightly thicker than other veins (Figure 10A-I). Secondary course slightly curved, unbranched; vein spacing uniform, angle acute and smoothly decreasing toward base in unlobed forms (Figure 10C), and more uniform in lobed forms (Figure 10A, Figure 11A). Perimarginal venation a very thin fimbrial vein, thickening the leaf margin slightly (Figure 10P, Figure 11C, I). Intersecondary veins very thin or absent (Figure 10M, Figure 11D). Interior secondaries present. Intercostal tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, sometimes random reticulate, arising at perpendicular angles to secondaries (Figure 11A-D, F-G, K). Epimedial tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, obtuse to primary, angle uniform (Figure 11A). Fourth order veins regular polygonal reticulate (Figure 11A, K). Areoles four-five sided, width to 0.9 mm. Marginal ultimate venation looped (Figure 11E, G-J). Teeth small, asymmetrical, simple or compound with two orders (Figure 10P, Figure 11G-H). Tooth shape convex/convex, convex/flexuous, straight/flexuous, or flexuous/flexuous; the apical flanks shorter than the basal flanks. First order teeth arise at secondary vein terminations; the additional tooth orders arise between the primary teeth (Figure 10F, P, Figure 11E). Tooth apex glandular or with a small spherulate callosity fused to the apex (Figure 10F, Figure 11E, G-J). Sinuses rounded. Tooth spacing uniform, about six per centimeter (Figure 10P, Figure 11E). Tooth venation supplied by a thick, straight or deflected medial principal vein; accessory veins looped (Figure 11I-J).\n\nObservations. Distinguishing characters of this morphotype include: blade trilobate or ovate; primary vein pinnate; secondary veins craspedodromous, not ramified; agrophic veins present; petiole long; and teeth numerous and small (salicoid), in two orders with glandular apices (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Morphotype SA009 is referrable to “Cissites” patagonica Berry, 1937, originally described from Palacio de los Loros (Cerro Funes). However, among Berry’s (1937a) four syntypes (Table 2), specimen USNM-201959 (Figure 36C) does not show the same characters listed in Berry’s description and as seen in the other syntypes. Instead, USNM-201959 has an untoothed margin and correlates to our morphotype SA073 (Table 2) below. Morphotype SA009 is present through all three Danian time intervals considered here and is usually very abundant (Table 1). Berry’s (1937a) original assignment to Vitaceae Jussieu, 1789 nom. cons. is dubious because lobed forms in that family characteristically have cordate or lobate bases.\n\nMorphotype SA010\n\nEquivalent.

Blade simple, symmetrical; size nanophyll to macrophyll, generally notophyll. Mean length 8.1 (2.5-14.0) cm, mean width 3.7 (1.3-8.4) cm; length:width ratio variable (0.7-1:1-2-3:1). Margin entire, sometimes wavy (Figure 12E, K-L). Petiole thick, insertion marginal, length to 1 cm, width to 3 mm (Figure 12F, L, Figure 13D, G). Shape elliptic, tending to ovate (Figure 12E, M, Figure 13E, H) or narrow elliptic (Figure 12F-G, Figure 13A-B). Apex shape acuminate, variably extended to form a drip tip (Figure 12N, Figure 13A, C, G), angle acute. Base shape decurrent, angle generally acute but may be obtuse (Figure 13H). Primary venation pinnate with a thick primary vein deflected by secondaries (Figure 12M, Figure 13A). Basal veins three, one primary and two fimbrial veins (Figure 12M). Agrophic veins variably present, usually absent in smaller leaves, simple (Figure 12F, Figure 13G-H), sometimes compound (Figure 12E, K, M, Figure 13F) with uniformly curved branches forming loops. Secondary venation brochidodromous, with opposite to alternate disposition, joining the supradjacent secondary by a series of loops parallel to the margin (Figure 12E, Figure 13C, H). Vein course straight or curved, markedly thinner towards apex. Spacing smoothly increasing toward base (Figure 12G, Figure 13G); angle may decrease abruptly in the basal pair (Figure 13E) or remain uniform toward base. In some specimens (e.g., Figure 12G, Figure 13C, E, H), the angle of the basal secondaries is especially acute, and secondary veins may extend along over a third of the blade length. Secondaries decurrent on midvein (Figure 12F, M, Figure 13A-B). Perimarginal venation a pronounced fimbrial vein, running along the full margin (Figure 12M). Intersecondary veins simple (Figure 13D, H) or composite (Figure 13D), proximally parallel to major secondaries, length less than half of subjacent secondary, frequency less than one per secondary. Intercostal tertiary venation opposite percurrent, perpendicular to secondaries (Figure 13E, I). Epimedial tertiary venation commonly opposite percurrent, may be mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, course straight, generally perpendicular to midvein (Figure 13E). Fourth order venation regular polygonal (Figure 12J, Figure 13F) to random reticulate (Figure 12I, Figure 13H). Fifth order venation regular polygonal reticulate (Figure 12J, I). Areolation well developed, areoles four-five sided, width 0.3-1.0 mm. Freely ending veinlets arise orthogonally, two or more branched, ending in small idioblasts (preserved as dark dots; Figure 12J). Vein density range 10.98-13.10 mm/mm2. Marginal ultimate venation looped (Figure 13C, F, H).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA010 differs from other entire-margined, pinnate-veined leaf morphotypes studied here (i.e., morphotypes SA046, SA056, SA063, SA073, SA077, and SA078) in that it has a symmetrical blade, thick petiole, a drip tip, three basal veins including basal secondaries that may extend over a third of the blade length, intersecondary veins present, pronounced fimbrial vein, and presence of large and abundant idioblasts (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Morphotype SA010 matches in architecture two species described from the historic Cerro Funes locality (Berry, 1937a): Laurophyllum piatnitzkyi Berry, 1937 and Cryptocaryoides maria-santisimensis Berry, 1937. Berry’s type specimens are fragmentary (Figure 12A and 12B, respectively), but the new collection presented here has abundant specimens that are more completely preserved, including several with Lauraceae-type cuticle under separate study. The L. piatnitzkyi syntypes have several characters that match the more elliptical examples of morphotype SA010, whereas the C. maria-santisimensis syntypes correspond to our larger, wider, tending-to-ovate specimens. The new collection presented here shows these morphologies as end members along with the full range of intermediates (Figure 12, Figure 13). This morphotype is present at each sampling level and is often the most common leaf form (Table 1). The significant variation suggests that it could represent several biological species, a hypothesis that could be tested using the preserved cuticle.\n\nMorphotype SA014\n\nEquivalent. “Sterculia” acuminataloba Berry, 1937 in part: syntypes USNM-208524 (Berry, 1937a, plate VIII, figure 1; here Figure 14A), USNM-208526 (Berry, 1937a, plate VIII, figure 3; here Figure 14B), USNM-208527 (Berry, 1937a, plate VIII, figure 4) only (Table 2); syntypes USNM-208525 and USNM-208528 excluded (see morphotypes SA058 and SA019).\n\nAffinity.

Primary venation actinodromous (Figure 14E, Figure 15B) to rarely palinactinodromous (Figure 14B-C, L), origin variably basal or suprabasal (Figure 14H, K-L). Primary vein course regular, slightly curved, unbranched except by palinactinodromy. Basal veins five primaries. Agrophic veins absent. Secondary venation either terminating in intramarginal vein and joining it at right angles (Figure 14M, Figure 15B), weakly brochidodromous close to margin (Figure 14A, E-F, K, Figure 15A), or interior near the base (Figure 15A). Sinus-bracing veins arise from both medial and lateral primaries, reaching the margin perpendicularly, forking near the sinus, and joining the intramarginal vein (Figure 14F, Figure 15A-B). Spacing irregular, usually one or two secondaries per centimeter. Angle irregular, opposite to alternate. Secondaries decurrent on midvein (Figure 14E-F, Figure 15B).

Marginal ultimate venation looped (Figure 14J, Figure 15A-B).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA014 can be distinguished from other palmately lobed morphotypes (morphotypes SA019 and SA058) by a number of features including: blade palmately 3-5 lobed; lobes simple, large, with straight apex; primary veins actinodromous (rarely palinactinodromous), not branched; secondary veins thin, brochidodromous; and a conspicuous intramarginal vein (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Morphotype SA014 corresponds to the type specimens of “Sterculia” acuminataloba Berry, 1937a from Palacio de los Loros indicated above. The excluded syntypes USNM-208525 and USNM-208528 (Figure 32I and Figure 17I, respectively) do not show the same morphology as Berry’s written description for the species and the other type material, instead corresponding to our morphotypes SA058 and SA019, respectively. Morphotype SA014 has been found at most localities discussed here and is abundant in most of them (Table 1). There are a large number of fossil leaf species from the Cretaceous and Paleogene of southern South America that are assigned to Sterculia Linnaeus 1753 (Berry, 1928; Berry, 1937b; Menéndez, 1959; Arguijo and Romero, 1981; Hünicken, 1995). None of them is clearly assignable to the living genus, nor do they appear to correspond to morphotype SA014, which is present through all three Paleocene paleomagnetic chrons sampled here (Table 1).\n\nMorphotype SA016\n\nPossible Affinity.

Secondary venation brochidodromous, with 9-11 pairs of opposite to alternate secondaries (Figure 16A, E, Figure 19F-H). Course approximately straight, then reticulating (Figure 19G-H) and weakly looping toward margin (Figure 19F, 19I). Spacing and angles irregular; angles acute. Secondaries decurrent on midvein. Perimarginal venation an irregular intramarginal vein, formed from exterior secondary loops when consolidated (Figure 16B, 16D, Figure 19F-G). Intersecondary veins thin, proximally parallel to subjacent secondary, more than half of the subjacent secondary length, distally reticulating or ramifying, one or two per secondary (Figure 16B, Figure 19G-H). Intercostal tertiary venation random reticulate (Figure 16B, Figure 19G). Epimedial tertiary venation reticulate. Fourth order veins thin, forming irregular polygons (Figure 16B).

Distinguishing characters of morphotype SA016 include: blade narrow elliptic; primary veins pinnate; secondary veins densely spaced, weak brochidodromous or festooned brochidodromous; intramarginal vein irregular; and leaf rank 2r (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Morphotype SA016 is present through all Danian time intervals considered in this study (Table 1).\n\nMorphotype SA019\n\nEquivalent to. “Sterculia acuminataloba” Berry, 1937 in part: syntypes USNM-208528 (Berry, 1937a, plate VIII, figure 5; here Figure 17I) only (Table 2); syntypes USNM-208524-208527 excluded (see morphotypes SA014 and SA058).\n\nAffinity.

Mean length 7.8 (3.5-19) cm, mean width 8.1 (2.6-20.0) cm, length:width ratio (0.8-1.2:1). Margin technically entire but with reduced lobes resembling irregular teeth often present (Figure 17A, L). Petiole insertion marginal (Figure 17E, J), long (Figure 17G), width up to 1.9 mm. Shape ovate, palmately odd lobed with up to six lobes (Figure 15G-H, Figure 17L), the lobes compound, occasionally simple (Figure 17H), lobe sinuses rounded (Figure 17C); lobe apex shape straight (Figure 17C) or convex (Figure 15I, Figure 17G-H), angle obtuse. Base shape cordate (Figure 17A, F, H, L) or rounded (Figure 17J-K), angle obtuse, generally > 180º. Primary venation basally actinodromous (Figure 17G-L), rarely palinactinodromous (Figure 17A, F). Primary vein course straight (Figure 17H) or slightly sinuous, midvein characteristically deflected by thick secondaries (Figure 15G, Figure 17A-B, I). Basal veins seven (Figure 17K) to eight (Figure 17E, L), five or six basal primaries plus two lateral intramarginal veins (Figure 17E). Agrophic veins absent. Secondary venation irregular, variably craspedodromous (when entering lobes and lobules directly or through branching), eucamptodromous (usually in simple lobes, Figure 17H), weakly brochidodromous (Figure 15I, Figure 17F-G), or terminating in the intramarginal vein (Figure 15H, Figure 17K). Sinus-bracing veins arise as a single thick secondary vein, course straight, then forking far from the margin and joining the intramarginal vein (Figure 15E, G, Figure 17C). Intersecondary veins thin, simple, and short (Figure 15E). Perimarginal venation an irregular intramarginal vein. Intersecondary veins thin, proximally and distally parallel to subjacent secondary, shorter than half the length of the subjacent secondary, frequency one per secondary (Figure 15E).

Vein density 10.12 mm/mm2 (one leaf measured). Marginal ultimate venation a thin intramarginal vein, running very close to the margin (Figure 15H-I).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA019 can be distinguished from other palmately lobed leaf morphotypes using a number of features including: lobes compound; base cordate; primary veins actinodromous, characteristically deflected by thick secondaries at the base of each lobe; secondary veins thick; and tertiary veins percurrent, chevroned towards base (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Whereas the original description of “Sterculia” acuminataloba Berry, 1937 from Cerro Funes (Palacio de los Loros) matches morphotype SA014 as discussed above, syntype USNM-208528 (Figure 17I) does not show the same leaf morphology as the original description, instead corresponding to our morphotype SA019. As for SA014, there are many fossil leaf species from Patagonia that have been referred to Sterculia Linnaeus, 1753 that superficially resemble morphotype SA019, but none shows the same suite of morphological characters. Morphotype SA019 is present through all three Paleocene time intervals in this study (Table 1).\n\nMorphotype SA020\n\nEquivalent to. “Myrica premira” Berry, 1937 in part: syntype USNM-201962 (Berry, 1937a, plate V, figure 3; here Figure 29C) only (see Table 2), USNM-201963 syntype excluded (see morphotype SA049).\n\nAffinity.

MPEF-PB-3020 from quarry PL2 (Figure 18G, K, Figure 19E).\n\nFigure 18, Figure 19A-E\n\nDescription. Leaf odd pinnately compound with almost four pairs of alternate leaflets (Figure 18M). Leaflets petiolulate, medially asymmetric with asymmetric insertion; size nanophyll to mesophyll, generally microphyll. Mean length 7.6 (5.5-11.5) cm, mean width 2.0 (0.9-3.8) cm. Length:width ratio 5:1. Margin serrate. Petiolule insertion marginal (Figure 18L-M, Figure 19B), semiterete in cross section. Texture chartaceous. Shape narrow ovate (Figure 18C-E, J-L). Apex shape extended acuminate (Figure 18A), angle acute. Base shape concave, angle acute, decurrent on the petiolule (Figure 18B-D). Primary venation pinnate. Midvein thick (Figure 18G), course smoothly curved. Basal veins one (Figure 19B-C). Agrophic veins absent. Secondary venation craspedodromous, becoming semicraspedodromous apically (Figure 18K-L, Figure 19E) and brochidodromous basally (Figure 18J-L, Figure 19D). Secondary veins bifurcate near margin (Figure 19A-B, D) and sometimes join adjacent secondaries, forming loops (Figure 19E). Veins opposite to subopposite, course smoothly curved, regularly spaced, angle to midvein regular, departure from midvein excurrent. Perimarginal venation a thick, well-developed fimbrial vein (Figure 18F-G). Intersecondary veins simple, proximally and distally parallel to subjacent secondary, longer than half the length of subjacent secondary, angle to midvein broader than that of main secondary veins; less than one per secondary (Figure 19B, E). Intercostal tertiary venation alternate percurrent, develops in 4-5 rows of vein fields per intercostal area (Figure 18F-G, Figure 19A, E). Epimedial tertiary venation mixed reticulate and percurrent, perpendicular to primary, course straight to sinuous, uniform angles (Figure 19A). Fourth order veins alternate percurrent (Figure 19E). Fifth order veins regular polygonal reticulate. Freely ending veinlets dichotomous branching (Figure 18G). Vein density range 6.78-14.36 mm/mm2 (one leaf measured). Areolation well developed. Marginal ultimate venation join perimarginal vein. Teeth simple, triangular, well developed, and regular except at the leaf base, apex simple (Figure 18F-G). Tooth shape convex/convex, flexuous/convex, or flexuous/flexuous; sinuses rounded (Figure 18F). Tooth spacing uniform, one tooth per centimeter. Tooth venation supplied by a secondary vein running near the apical flank and reaching the tooth apex; and an apical short-curved branch running along the basal flank of the supradjacent tooth; accessory tooth venation looped and fimbrial (Figure 18F-G).\n\nObservations. All specimens of this morphotype have an asymmetric base and a smoothly curved primary vein, suggesting that they are isolated leaflets derived from compound leaves, and two specimens, MPEF-Pb-9154 (Figure 18M) and MPEF-Pb-9155, were found with organically attached leaflets. Morphotype SA020 is found through all Danian time intervals considered here and is abundant from quarry PL2 (Table 1).\n\nMorphotype SA020 matches the syntype USNM-201962 of “Myrica premira” (Berry, 1937a, plate V, figure 3; here Figure 29C), although it does not show the same characters listed in Berry’s description and the other syntypes for that species (see morphotype SA049). USNM-201962 has an extended acuminate apex, craspedodromous secondary venation, a thick fimbrial vein, and regularly shaped teeth that correlate to our morphotype SA020 (Table 2).\n\nThe robust fimbrial vein, asymmetric base, craspedodromous secondary venation, and the tooth venation with an asymmetric midvein and a small apical branch (cunonioid tooth sensu Hickey and Wolfe, 1975) are consistent with Cunoniaceae. As mentioned earlier, Jud et al. (2018a) recently described cunoniaceous flowers (Tribe Schizomerieae) from the same localities of the Salamanca and Peñas Coloradas formations. Characters that distinguish this morphotype from similar cunonioid leaflets (i.e., SA005, SA042, SA043, SA44, SA049, SA054; Table 1) include: blade ovate; secondary veins forking far from margin to vascularize two teeth; intersecondaries weak, intramarginal vein thick, teeth triangular, and the tooth principal vein formed by a small branch that reaches the basal flank of the supradjacent tooth (see key in supplementary Appendix 2).\n\nMorphotype SA035\n\nAffinity.

Apex shape convex (Figure 20G, I), lobe-apex angle wide-obtuse. Base wide; shape concavo-convex (Figure 20A), cordate (Figure 20B, F, I), or straight (Figure 20G); angle obtuse. Primary venation basal actinodromous with one primary vein per lobe, up to three thick primaries with straight courses and two thin laterals, for both the lobed and unlobed forms. In unlobed forms, lateral primaries taper apically, reaching the same strength as secondaries. Basal veins five, three primary veins and and two thinner lateral primaries (Figure 19K, Figure 20B). Agrophic veins compound (Figure 20A, E, H). Secondary venation craspedodromous (may be semicraspedodromous at base, Figure 20F); veins robust, opposite to subopposite, course curved abruptly near the margin and branching to innervate teeth. Secondary spacing uniform, angle slightly decreasing toward base (Figure 20B, G-H). Sinus-bracing veins well-developed (Figure 20B, G). Perimarginal venation a thin fimbrial vein (Figure 19J, Figure 20C). Intersecondary and interior secondary veins absent. Intercostal tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent (Figure 19K). Epimedial tertiary venation alternate percurrent with perpendicular divergence from midvein, more or less uniform in gauge and course. Fourth and fifth order venation regular polygonal reticulate (Figure 19J). Vein density 10.59 mm/mm2 (one leaf measured). Areolation moderately developed. Marginal ultimate venation looped (Figure 19J). Teeth compound in two orders, triangular, generally with a simple (Figure 20C, Figure 19J) or spinose apex, sometimes with an opaque callosity fused to the apex (Figure 20F). Tooth shape concave/concave, concave/flexuous, straight/flexuous, straight/straight, or flexuous/flexuous; sinuses angular (Figure 20C, Figure 19J). Tooth spacing slightly irregular, one to two teeth per centimeter. Tooth venation supplied by a robust medial vein arising from a secondary or a secondary branch, emitting a minor branch that innervates the supradjacent sinus; accessory veins looped and merging with the fimbrial vein (Figure 19J).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA035 is present at low abundances through all three Danian time intervals considered here (Table 1). It differs from morphotype SA009 (in part = “Cissites” patagonica Berry, 1937a) in base shape, tooth type, interior secondaries, and second- and higher-order venation (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). The teeth of morphotype SA035 can be assigned to the violoid type following Hickey and Wolfe (1975). Morphotype SA035 shares several features with extant Cochlospermum Kunth, 1822 nom. cons. (Bixaceae), such as symmetrical, palmately veined leaves with craspedodromous secondary venation and no intersecondaries, tertiary veins perpendicular to primary vein, presence of simple and compound teeth with angular sinuses, and looped marginal ultimate venation. Cochlospermum previtifolium Berry, 1935aleaves and fruits are known from the Eocene Laguna del Hunco and Río Pichileufú floras (Berry, 1935a; González, 2008), and that taxon shares the characters noted here for the extant species. C. previtifolium differs from morphotype SA035 in having a straight/convex tooth shape, percurrent tertiary venation, and a thick fimbrial vein.\n\nMorphotype SA038\n\nAffinity. Unknown.\n\nExemplar.

Blade simple, symmetrical; size notophyll to mesophyll, most frequently mesophyll. Maximum length to 15 cm, maximum width to 18 cm. Length:width ratio ~0.8:1 (one leaf measured). Margin entire. Petiole insertion marginal or subpeltate (Figure 22G-H), disposed nearly perpendicular to the plane of the blade. Shape ovate, palmately 5-lobed; lobes wide and shallow (Figure 22G-H), lobe sinuses rounded (Figure 21B); lobe apex convex (Figure 22E) or acuminate (Figure 22B), apex angle obtuse. Base shape lobate, basal sinus prominent, base reflex (Figure 22A-E, G-H). Apex shape convex (Figure 22B, G), lobe-apex angle obtuse. Primary venation basal actinodromous; primary veins moderate in thickness, course deflected, occasionally forked near the margin (Figure 21A). Basal veins seven to nine, with five to seven primaries and two thinner basal secondaries (Figure 21A-B, Figure 22D). Agrophic veins simple or compound, festooned brochidodromous (Figure 21B). Secondary venation festooned brochidodromous; secondaries thick, subopposite, course straight or abruptly curved; departure from midvein excurrent, deflecting the midvein. Secondary spacing increasing toward base; angle smoothly decreasing toward base. Sinus-bracing veins poorly marked, forking far from the sinus (Figure 21B). Perimarginal and intersecondary veins absent. Intercostal tertiary venation alternate percurrent, thickness moderate (Figure 21A-B, Figure 22F). Epimedial tertiary venation opposite percurrent, course straight, opposite toward base of blade, otherwise alternate, perpendicular to primary, tertiary angle increasing exmedially, forming a concentric ‘spider web’ pattern (Figure 21A, Figure 22D). Fourth and fifth order venation regular polygonal reticulate (Figure 21A). Vein density 9.74 mm/mm2 (one leaf measured). Areolation well developed, areoles four-sided. Freely ending veinlets unbranched. Marginal ultimate venation looped (Figure 21B).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA039 has characters identical to those of the type specimen of “Paranymphaea” aristolochiaformis Berry, 1937 collected at the Palacio de los Loros locality (Berry, 1937a). More and better-preserved material here allows more complete description of this species, which Berry (1937a) described as palmate, even though most of the leaf margin, shape, and apex were not preserved in Berry’s material (Figure 22A). The new material shows that the leaf is lobate rather than palmate. Paranymphaea Berry, 1935 is a fossil genus proposed by Berry (1935b) for specimens from the Paleocene of the Northern Hemisphere, originally assigned to the Nymphaeaceae Salisbury, 1805. Morphotype SA039 has actinodromous primary venation and festooned brochidodromous secondary venation, characters that can be observed within Nymphaeaceae. However, in the family leaves with festooned brochidodromous venation also have several orders of loops progressing toward the margin. In addition, the new specimens of morphotype SA039 have a palmately 5-lobed, lobate base (not cordate or sagittate), robust secondary veins arising at acute angles, and dense agrophic veins, none of which occurs in living Nymphaeaceae. Morphotype SA039 was found at quarries PL1 and PL4 (Salamanca Formation) and at quarry LF (Peñas Coloradas Formation), at relatively low abundance (Table 1). It differs markedly from other lobate morphotypes (e.g., morphotype SA038) in its actinodromous primary venation, lobate base shape, and larger number of basal veins.\n\nMorphotype SA040\n\nAffinity.

Base shape slightly cordate, base angle reflex (Figure 21D, Figure 22J-K). Primary venation basal actinodromous, course deflected by secondaries, forking prominently toward the margin (Figure 22J). Lateral primaries disposed at >180° (Figure 21D). Basal veins six to seven, five primaries and one or two basal secondaries. Agrophic veins simple, generating brochidodromous loops (Figure 21D). Secondary venation brochidodromous. Secondary veins alternate to subopposite, thin, deflecting the primaries, spacing irregular, angle acute and irregular (Figure 21D). Perimarginal and sinus-bracing veins absent. Intercostal tertiary venation opposite percurrent, departing from secondaries at acute angles. Epimedial tertiary venation thin, opposite percurrent, course straight, tertiary angle to primary perpendicular at departure, then obtuse, at the base arranged in chevrons, tertiary vein angle increasing exmedially (Figure 21D). Fourth order veins regular polygonal reticulate, very thin. Marginal ultimate venation looped.\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA040 differs from other palmately-lobed, entire margined leaves studied here (i.e., SA014, SA019, SA038, SA039, SA041, SA055, and SA58) in having wide and shallow lobes, petiole insertion peltate eccentric, and seven basal veins (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Morphotype SA040 occurs at low abundance at the Palacio de los Loros locality (PL1 and PL2 quarries, Table 1).\n\nMorphotype SA041\n\nAffinity. Rhamnaceae Jussieu, 1789.\n\nExemplar. MPEF-Pb-2034 from quarry PL2 (Figure 19L, Figure 23A,I).\n\nFigure 19L-M, Figure 23A-I\n\nDescription. Blade symmetric, size microphyll to mesophyll, generally notophyll. Mean length 8.8 (5.0-11.4) cm, mean width 3.7 (2.0-6.6) cm. Length:width ratio 2.5:1 (one leaf measured). Margin wavy (undulate, Figure 23G-H), irregularly crenate near secondary loops. Small teeth rarely present on some specimens (Figure 19M, Figure 23G). Texture typically membranaceous. Petiole insertion marginal (Figure 23A, D). Shape ovate or elliptic. Apex shape acuminate, generally extending into a drip tip (Figure 23C, E), angle acute. Base shape convex (Figure 23A-E), angle acute. Primary venation pinnate, primary vein course straight or slightly sinuous (Figure 23D-E). Basal veins one. Secondary venation eucamptodromous (Figure 19L, Figure 23H); secondaries opposite to alternate on the midvein in 10-12 pairs, course regularly curved; spacing uniform, angle acute and uniform (Figure 23A); departure from midvein decurrent for proximal secondaries, otherwise excurrent (Figure 23B-E). Perimarginal, agrophic and intersecondary veins absent. Intercostal tertiary venation markedly opposite percurrent (Figure 19L, Figure 23F), departure from secondaries perpendicular. Epimedial tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent (Figure 23I), course sinuous, disposed densely (more than 25 per intercostal area), very thin, departure from primary perpendicular, then obtuse at a uniform angle (Figure 19L-M, Figure 23F). Fourth order veins regular pentagonal reticulate. Fifth order veins dichotomizing (Figure 23I). Vein density range 8.27-8.68 mm/mm2. Areolation poorly developed. Freely ending veinlets one-branched. Marginal ultimate venation looped. Teeth irregularly spaced and scattered (Figure 19M, Figure 23G). Tooth venation from secondary loops (Figure 19M).\n\nObservations. Based on the wavy margin, pinnate primary venation, eucamptodromous secondary venation, and dense tertiaries that are disposed perpendicular to the primary and at homogeneous angles, morphotype SA041 could be assigned to Rhamnaceae Jussieu, 1789 (e.g., Hickey and Wolfe, 1975). Morphotype SA041 was found at quarries PL1, PL2 and PL4 (Salamanca Formation), with relatively high abundance at quarry PL2 (Table 1). Jud et al. (2017) described fossil flowers and leaves related to the ziziphoid/ampelozizyphoid clades of Rhamnaceae Jussieu, 1789 from the Rancho Grande (RG) locality (Chron C29n, Salamanca Formation, Figure 1); however, those leaves are quite different from morphotype SA041, which is more similar to other groups of Rhamnaceae such as Sageretia Brongniart 1826, from the rhamnoid clade (Richardson et al., 2000). Distinguishing characters of this morphotype include: margin wavy, irregularly crenate near secondary loops; a drip tip; and 10-12 pairs of regular, eucamptodromous secondary veins (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Rhamnidium preglabrum Berry, 1925a (Rhamnaceae) from the Eocene Río Pichileufú and Laguna del Hunco (Berry, 1925a, 1938; Traverso, 1951) floras is probably the most similar Patagonian fossil leaf species to morphotype SA041. However, the Eocene material differs from morphotype SA041 in having a thicker and more prominent midvein and 8-11 pairs of secondary veins that are more thick and regular.\n\nMorphotype SA042\n\nEquivalent to. Fagophyllum duseni Berry, 1937 syntypes USNM-201960 (Berry, 1937a, plate V, figure 1; here Figure 16L), USNM-201961 (Berry, 1937a, plate V, figure 2; here Figure 16M); and “Dryophyllum australis” Berry, 1937 syntype USNM-208522 (Berry, 1937a, plate VI, figure 5; here Figure 7A) only (see Table 2); USNM-208523 syntype excluded (see morphotype SA004).\n\nAffinity. Cunoniaceae Brown, 1814 nom. cons.\n\nExemplar. MPEF-Pb-2035 (Figure 16F).\n\nFigure 16F-M, Figure 25A-D\n\nDescription. Leaf organization even-pinnately compound (Figure 16G), with at least three pairs of opposite leaflets. Rachis robust. Leaflet blade and base asymmetrical (Figure 16F-G, J-L), size microphyll to notophyll, generally microphyll. Mean length 6.2 (3.0-9.5) cm, mean width 2.2 (1.1-4.0) cm. Length:width ratio (2.1:1-4.1:1). Margin serrate. Petiolule short, insertion marginal, base slightly swollen (Figure 16G, L). Shape elliptic or ovate. Apex shape convex, angle acute (Figure 16J-M, Figure 25A). Base shape straight, angle acute (Figure 16G, I-L). Primary venation pinnate, midvein thick, course straight or slightly curved. Basal veins one. Agrophic veins absent. Secondary venation craspedodromous. Secondary veins in seven to nine pairs, uniformly curved and regularly spaced; angle slightly irregular, increasing toward base, entering the teeth medially or apically. Secondaries generally not branching; if branched (Figure 25B-C) the apical branch runs toward the supradjacent basal tooth flank. Perimarginal venation a thin fimbrial vein originating from the base, thickenening the margin (Figure 16F). Intersecondary vein present, less than one per secondary (Figure 25B, D). Intercostal tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, departure from secondaries obtuse. Epimedial tertiary venation thin, percurrent or reticulate, course convex. Tertiary angle to midvein obtuse, uniform (Figure 25B). Fourth and fifth order veins regular polygonal reticulate. Areolation moderately developed. Marginal ultimate venation looped. Teeth simple asymmetric, non-glandular, large (length 1.6 cm, width 0.6 cm) and increasing in size toward the base of the blade (Figure 16F, I-L, Figure 25A). Tooth shape convex/convex or straight/convex; sinuses angular (Figure 16H). Tooth spacing uniform, one per centimeter (Figure 16F), absent in the base of blade (Figure 16I-L). Tooth venation supplied by a secondary vein that enters asymmetrically into the tooth, plus an apical deflected vein running near the supradjacent tooth basal flank and reaching the tooth apex (Figure 16H, Figure 25A-D).\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA042 is present through all three Danian time intervals considered here (Table 1). It is equivalent to Fagophyllum duseni, which was described from two specimens from Palacio de los Loros (Figure 16L-M). Berry (1937a) assigned this material to the genus Fagophyllum Nathorst, 1888 because he found similarities with the genera Fagus Linnaeus, 1753 and Nothofagus Blume, 1851 nom. cons. (then considered part of Fagaceae). In addition, one of Berry’s (1937a) syntypes of “Dryophyllum” australis Berry, 1937 (USNM-208522, Figure 7A) shows different leaf architecture from Berry´s original description (see morphotype SA004) and is here considered equivalent to morphotype SA042 (Table 2).\n\nThe slightly asymmetric base and slightly curved primary vein of morphotype SA042 suggest that it corresponds to leaflets from compound leaves, confirmed by one specimen (MPEF-Pb-9156, Figure 16F) found with organically attached leaflets. The compound leaf, asymmetric leaflet base, craspedodromous secondary venation, and the tooth venation with an asymmetric principal vein and a small apical branch (cunonioid tooth per Hickey and Wolfe, 1975) could place morphotype SA020 in the Cunoniaceae, also known from reproductive material from the same sites (Jud et al., 2018a; see Introduction).\n\nMorphotype SA043\n\nAffinity.

MPEF-Pb-3023 from quarry PL2 (Figure 24B), and MPEF-Pb-9110 from quarry PL2 (Figure 24C).\n\nFigure 24A-G, Figure 25E-F\n\nDescription. Leaf organization odd once-pinnately compound with at least three opposite, sessile to petiolulate leaflets (Figure 24C, G). Leaflets symmetric, size nanophyll to notophyll, generally microphyll. Mean length 4.2 (2.8-5.7) cm, mean width 2.5 (1.3-3.7) cm. Mean length:width ratio 2.4:1 (1.3:1-3.5:1); leaflet shape ovate or elliptic (Figure 24C, G). Texture chartaceous to membranaceous, characteristically preserved in a whitish yellow color (Figure 24A-E). Margin dentate. Petiolule sessile to ~2.5 cm (on a terminal leaflet) in length, with an abscission zone at the base; insertion marginal (Figure 24C). Shape elliptic. Apex shape straight or concave (acuminate), angle acute (Figure 24B, E, G). Base asymmetric, shape cuneate, angle acute (Figure 24G). Primary venation pinnate; midvein thin (0.7 mm.), course straight. Basal veins one. Secondary venation craspedodromous; secondary vein course straight, spacing smoothly increasing toward base. Secondaries opposite on the midvein, arise at regular acute angles. Secondary veins fork once or twice near the margin, entering teeth medially (Figure 24F, Figure 25E). Perimarginal and intersecondary veins absent. Intercostal tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, departure angle from secondaries obtuse (Figure 25F). Epimedial tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, course convex, departure angle from primary perpendicular and uniform (Figure 25E). Fourth order veins thick, regular polygonal reticulate. Fifth order veins regular polygonal reticulate, tending to opposite percurrent, forming large four-five sided areoles of 1.2 mm width (Figure 25E-F). Sixth order veins regular polygonal reticulate. Freely ending veinlets one-branched. Vein density 6.70 mm/mm2 (one leaf measured). Areolation well developed (Figure 24F). Marginal ultimate venation looped. Teeth well developed around whole blade, simple, in two orders (Figure 25F). Teeth large (length 2.7 mm, width 3.0 mm), apex glandular to spherulate (Figure 24F, Figure 25F). Tooth shape concave/flexuous, straight/flexuous, straight/concave, or flexuous/flexuous; sinuses angular. Tooth spacing uniform, two teeth per centimeter (Figure 25E). Tooth venation supplied from secondary veins entering the first-order teeth medially and reaching the apex, minor secondary branches entering the subjacent second-order teeth, and apical secondary branches entering the superjacent sinuses (Figure 24F, Figure 25F).\n\nObservations. Distinguishing characters of morphotype SA043 include: blade elliptic; secondary veins forking; perimarginal and intersecondary veins absent; and teeth prominent and in two orders (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Morphotype SA043 is present through all three Danian time intervals considered here (Table 1). It is a compound leaf, as demonstrated by several attached specimens (e.g., Figure 24C, G) and resembles some genera in Cunoniaceae (e.g., Acrophyllum Bentham in Maund, 1840; Callicoma Andrews, 1809; and Vesselowskya Pampanini, 1905). In Cretaceous-Paleogene floras from southern South America, many fossil leaflets similar to morphotype SA043 have been placed in the genus Cupania Linnaeus, 1753 (Sapindaceae) (Engelhardt, 1891; Berry, 1925a, 1938; Traverso, 1951; Hünicken, 1967, 1995; Troncoso, 1992; Troncoso et al., 2002); however, the presence of that genus has never been confirmed with modern methods, and no extant species of Cupania resembles morphotype SA043.\n\nMorphotype SA044\n\nAffinity.

Size microphyll to notophyll, generally microphyll. Mean length 8.0 (5.0-10.5) cm, mean width 2.0 (1.1-4.0) cm. Mean length:width ratio 2.9:1 (2.2:1-5.6:1). Margin crenate or dentate (Figure 23O, Figure 25G-H). Petiole insertion marginal. Shape variable, generally wide elliptic or narrow elliptic. Apex shape straight, angle acute. Base shape decurrent (Figure 23N) or convex (Figure 23L), angle acute. Primary venation pinnate; primary vein thick, course slightly curved (Figure 23K). Basal veins one. Secondary venation craspedodromous, secondary veins numerous, opposite to alternate, thickness moderate, course regularly curved (Figure 23K-M), generally not branching but may fork near the blade base, running to the sinuses (Figure 25G). Isolated brochidodromous looping can develop in the largest leaves (Figure 23M). Secondary vein spacing increasing toward middle of blade (Figure 23M); vein angle smoothly increasing toward base (Figure 23L-M). Departure from midvein excurrent. Agrophic and intersecondary veins absent. Perimarginal venation a thin, irregular intramarginal vein (Figure 23O). Intercostal tertiary venation thin, mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, departure from secondaries perpendicular (Figure 23O, Figure 25G-H). Epimedial tertiary venation opposite percurrent, thin, course sinuous, departure angle from primary perpendicular with uniform spacing. Fourth, fifth and sixth order venation regular polygonal reticulate (Figure 23O). Freely ending veinlets not observed. Vein density 12.72 mm/mm2(one leaf measured). Areolation moderately developed. Marginal ultimate venation looped, forming a thin, irregular intramarginal vein (Figure 23O, Figure 25G). Teeth simple and very small (length 1.0-0.5 mm), markedly asymmetrical; apex glandular (Figure 25G), sometimes with a triangular capsule associated with the principal vein (Figure 23O, Figure 25H). Tooth shape concave/flexuous, straight/convex, straight/flexuous, or straight/concave; sinuses angular or rounded with extended concavity between teeth (Figure 25G). Tooth spacing uniform, two or three teeth per centimeter. Tooth venation supplied from a secondary running to the sinus, branching far from the tooth base and emitting a branch that innervates the tooth medially and another that runs near the basal flank of the supradjacent tooth (Figure 25G-H); tooth accessory venation looped, runing near the basal flank (Figure 25H).\n\nObservations. Distinguishing characters of this morphotype include: secondary veins numerous; teeth small, asymmetrical, and glandular; and principal tooth venation running to the sinus (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Morphotype SA044 is present through all three Danian time intervals considered here and is abundant at the PL1 site (Table 1). The asymmetric base and the substantial variation in leaf architecture among leaves of different sizes suggests that morphotype SA044 may represent leaflets of a compound leaf. The teeth correspond to cunonioid teeth sensu Hickey and Wolfe (1975). The compound leaf, cunonioid teeth, and general leaf architecture resemble Australasian taxa in Cunoniaceae (e.g., Schizomeria spp., Pullea stutzeri [Mueller] Gibbs 1917, Aistopetalum viticoides Schlechter, 1915), and abundant Schizomerieae flowers occur at the same fossil localities (Jud et al., 2018a; see Introduction).\n\nMorphotype SA045\n\nAffinity.

Blade symmetrical or weakly asymmetrical at the base, size microphyll. Length to 4.5 cm, width to 2.0 cm. Length:width ratio ~2:1 (one leaf measured). Margin entire. Petiolule (presumed) short, pulvinulate with horizontal striations, insertion marginal (Figure 24K, Figure 25J). Shape slightly ovate. Apex shape convex or retuse (Figure 24H, L, Figure 25J), angle acute. Base shape rounded (Figure 24K), angle acute. Basal veins three, two of them very thin and running near the margin (Figure 25J). Primary venation pinnate; midvein thick with course slightly curved, reaching the apical margin with strength (Figure 24H, L). Secondary venation brochidodromous; in seven 11 pairs of thin veins, course uniformly curved; spacing smoothly decreasing toward the base, angle increasing toward base. Secondaries decurrent on midvein (Figure 25J). Perimarginal venation absent. Intercostal tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, departing perpendicularly from secondaries. Epimedial tertiary venation mixed opposite-alternate percurrent, course straight; angle decreasing toward base (Figure 25J). Freely ending veinlets not observed. Marginal ultimate venation looped.\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA045 can be placed in the Fabaceae Lindley, 1836 based on its pulvinulate, horizontally striated petiolule, weak-brochidodromous secondary venation with thin secondaries running parallel to the margin for some distance, and retuse apex. This leaflet type was previously described along with co-occurring, permineralized Fabaceae wood (mimosoid clade) from the same unit (Brea et al., 2008, figure 6) as the oldest reliable record of legumes from the Southern Hemisphere. This occurrence is approximately coeval with the Danian fossil legumes recently reported from Corral Bluffs in Colorado (Lyson et al., 2019). Morphotype SA045 is only known from five total specimens at quarries OR2 and PL1 (Salamanca Formation, Table 1).\n\nMorphotype SA046\n\nEquivalent to.

Blade symmetrical, size microphyll to notophyll, generally microphyll. Mean length 6.1 (3.7-9.5) cm, mean width (2.9-4.4) cm. Mean length:width ratio 3.9:1 (2.5:1-6.7:1). Margin entire. Petiole robust, base swollen, insertion marginal. Shape elliptic (Figure 26A, E) or obovate (Figure 26C). Apex shape straight extended (Figure 26C-F), angle acute. Base shape decurrent on the petiole (Figure 25I), angle acute. Primary venation pinnate. Midvein thick, course straight or somewhat curved. Basal veins one. Agrophic veins absent. Secondary venation reticulodromous (Figure 25I, Figure 26A) or slightly brochidodromous (Figure 26C). Secondary vein course irregular, branching (Figure 26B) a thin pair of acute basal secondaries present (Figure 25I), otherwise spacing and angle uniform. Perimarginal venation a thin fimbrial vein (Figure 26B). Intersecondary veins proximally parallel to subjacent secondary (Figure 26C); length less than half that of subjacent secondary; distally reticulating or ramifying; one or fewer per secondary. Intercostal tertiary venation random reticulate to irregular percurrent (Figure 26B). Epimedial tertiary venation mixed opposite percurrent and reticulate, angle variable with respect to primary, obtuse toward base, decreasing exmedially. Fourth and fifth order veins random reticulate. Freely ending veinlets not observed. Vein density 9.12 mm/mm2 (one leaf measured). Areolation well developed (Figure 26B). Marginal ultimate venation joining the fimbrial vein. Leaf rank 2r.\n\nObservations. Morphotype SA046 can be placed in the family Lauraceae Jussieu, 1789 based on its entire margin, fimbrial vein, thick cuticle (that conforms to Lauraceae; under separate study), pinnate primary venation with a thick midvein, acute basal secondary veins, thin secondary venation, and well-developed third to fifth orders of venation. Morphotype SA046 differs from other entire-margined, pinnate-veined leaf morphotypes studied here (i.e., morphotypes SA010, SA056, SA063, SA073, SA077, and SA078) in that it has secondaries with lower angles, lacks agrophic veins, and has a conspicuous fimbrial vein and a lower foliar rank (see key in supplementary Appendix 2). Morphotype SA046 is equivalent to one syntype specimen of Laurophyllum chubutensis Berry, 1937a (USNM-208530 only, Figure 26F) described from the Palacio de los Loros locality (Table 2). Even though Berry’s original description lacks detail, the type material shares all leaf characters with morphotype SA046. This morphotype occurs at most quarries from the Salamanca Formation (Table 1).\n\nMorphotype SA047\n\nAffinity. Unknown.\n\nExemplar.
