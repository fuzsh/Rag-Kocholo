Here, we combine carbon isotopic records from 18 Atlantic sediment cores with numerical simulations and decompose the carbon isotopic change across a cold-to-warm transition into remineralization and circulation components. Our results show that the replacement of southern-sourced by northern-sourced water plays a dominant role below ~ 3000 m depth.\n\nRegional seesaw between the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas during the last glacial abrupt climate events\n\nMÃ©lanie Wary, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Eynaud, Didier Swingedouw, ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte, Jens Matthiessen, Catherine Kissel, Jena Zumaque, Linda Rossignol, and Jean Jouzel\n\nClim.

Here we provide direct evidence of a regional paradoxical see-saw pattern: cold Greenland and North Atlantic phases coincide with warmer sea-surface conditions and shorter seasonal sea-ice cover durations in the Norwegian Sea as compared to warm phases.\n\nChanges in Holocene meridional circulation and poleward Atlantic flow: the Bay of Biscay as a nodal point\n\nYannick Mary, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Eynaud, Christophe Colin, Linda Rossignol, Sandra Brocheray, Meryem Mojtahid, Jennifer Garcia, Marion Peral, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Howa, SÃ©bastien Zaragosi, and Michel Cremer\n\nClim.

Here we document the last 10 kyr evolution of sea-surface temperatures over the North Atlantic with a focus on new data obtained from an exceptional sedimentary archive retrieved the southern Bay of Biscay, enabling the study of Holocene archives at (infra)centennial scales.\n\nPalaeohydrological changes over the last 50â¯ky in the central Gulf of Cadiz: complex forcing mechanisms mixing multi-scale processes\n\nAurÃ©lie Penaud, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Eynaud, Antje Helga Luise Voelker, and Jean-Louis Turon\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 5357–5377, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5357-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5357-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents new analyses conducted at high resolution in the Gulf of Cadiz over the last 50 ky. Palaeohydrological changes in these subtropical latitudes are discussed through dinoflagellate cyst assemblages but also dinocyst transfer function results, implying sea surface temperature and salinity as well as annual productivity reconstructions. This study is thus important for our understanding of past and future productivity regimes, also implying consequences on the biological pump.\n\nClimate change and ecosystems dynamics over the last 6000 years in the Middle Atlas, Morocco\n\nMajda Nourelbait, Ali Rhoujjati, Abdelfattah Benkaddour, Matthieu CarrÃ©, Frederique Eynaud, Philippe Martinez, and Rachid Cheddadi\n\nClim.

We used the reconstruction of three climate variables and geo-chemical elements to evaluate the relationships between all the environmental variables. In summary, this present study confirms the overall climate stability over the last 6 ky and highlights the presence of a short and abrupt climate event at about 5.2 ka cal BP.\n\nExtreme sea events during the last millennium in the northeast of Morocco\n\nO.

However, human activities that reshape ecosystems also alter sedimentary and biological processes that control the formation of the geological archives recording those impacts. Thus, humans have been transforming the marine fossil record in ways that affect our ability to reconstruct past ecological and climate dynamics.\n\nOrigin and role of non-skeletal carbonate in coralligenous build-ups: new geobiological perspectives in biomineralization processes\n\nMara Cipriani, Carmine Apollaro, Daniela Basso, Pietro Bazzicalupo, Marco Bertolino, Valentina Alice Bracchi, Fabio Bruno, Gabriele Costa, Rocco Dominici, Alessandro Gallo, Maurizio Muzzupappa, Antonietta Rosso, Rossana Sanfilippo, Francesco Sciuto, Giovanni Vespasiano, and Adriano Guido\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 49–72, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-49-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-49-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWho constructs the build-ups of the Mediterranean Sea?

In this research, for the first time, the coralligenous of the Mediterranean shelf is studied from a geobiological point of view with an interdisciplinary biological and geological approach, highlighting important biotic relationships that can be used in interpreting the fossil build-up systems.\n\nSerpulid microbialitic bioherms from the upper Sarmatian (Middle Miocene) of the central Paratethys Sea (NW Hungary) â witnesses of a microbial sea\n\nMathias Harzhauser, Oleg Mandic, and Werner E. Piller\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4775–4794, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4775-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4775-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBowl-shaped spirorbid microbialite bioherms formed during the late Middle Miocene (Sarmatian) in the central Paratethys Sea under a warm, arid climate. The microbialites and the surrounding sediment document a predominance of microbial activity in the shallow marine environments of the sea at that time. Modern microbialites are not analogues for these unique structures, which reflect a series of growth stages with an initial “start-up stage”, massive “keep-up stage” and termination of growth.\n\nMassive corals record deforestation in Malaysian Borneo through sediments in river discharge\n\nWalid Naciri, Arnoud Boom, Matthew Payne, Nicola Browne, Noreen J. Evans, Philip Holdship, Kai Rankenburg, Ramasamy Nagarajan, Bradley J. McDonald, Jennifer McIlwain, and Jens Zinke\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1587–1604, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1587-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1587-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we tested the ability of massive boulder-like corals to act as archives of land use in Malaysian Borneo to palliate the lack of accurate instrumental data on deforestation before the 1980s. We used mass spectrometry to measure trace element ratios in coral cores to use as a proxy for sediment in river discharge. Results showed an extremely similar increase between our proxy and the river discharge instrumental record, demonstrating the use of these corals as reliable archives.\n\nCalcification response of planktic foraminifera to environmental change in the western Mediterranean Sea during the industrial era\n\nThibauld M. BÃ©jard, AndrÃ©s S. Rigual-HernÃ¡ndez, JosÃ© A. Flores, Javier P. Tarruella, Xavier Durrieu de Madron, Isabel Cacho, Neghar Haghipour, Aidan Hunter, and Francisco J. Sierro\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1505–1528, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1505-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1505-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea is undergoing a rapid and unprecedented environmental change. Planktic foraminifera calcification is affected on different timescales. On seasonal and interannual scales, calcification trends differ according to the species and are linked mainly to sea surface temperatures and carbonate system parameters, while comparison with pre/post-industrial assemblages shows that all three species have reduced their calcification between 10 % to 35 % according to the species.\n\nNature and origin of variations in pelagic carbonate production in the tropical ocean since the mid-Miocene (ODP Site 927)\n\nPauline Cornuault, Thomas Westerhold, Heiko PÃ¤like, Torsten Bickert, Karl-Heinz Baumann, and Michal Kucera\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 597–618, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-597-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-597-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe generated high-resolution records of carbonate accumulation rate from the Miocene to the Quaternary in the tropical Atlantic Ocean to characterize the variability in pelagic carbonate production during warm climates. It follows orbital cycles, responding to local changes in tropical conditions, as well as to long-term shifts in climate and ocean chemistry. These changes were sufficiently large to play a role in the carbon cycle and global climate evolution.\n\nVariation in calcification of Reticulofenestra coccoliths over the OligoceneâEarly Miocene\n\nJosÃ© GuitiÃ¡n, Miguel Ãngel Fuertes, JosÃ©-Abel Flores, IvÃ¡n HernÃ¡ndez-Almeida, and Heather Stoll\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5007–5019, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5007-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5007-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effect of environmental conditions on the degree of calcification of marine phytoplankton remains unclear. This study implements a new microscopic approach to quantify the calcification of ancient coccolithophores, using North Atlantic sediments. Results show significant differences in the thickness and shape factor of coccoliths for samples with minimum dissolution, providing the first evaluation of phytoplankton physiology adaptation to million-year-scale variable environmental conditions.\n\nThe influence of near-surface sediment hydrothermalism on the TEX86 tetraether-lipid-based proxy and a new correction for ocean bottom lipid overprinting\n\nJeremy N. Bentley, Gregory T. Ventura, Clifford C. Walters, Stefan M. Sievert, and Jeffrey S. Seewald\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4459–4477, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4459-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4459-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe demonstrate the TEX86 (TetraEther indeX of 86 carbon atoms) paleoclimate proxy can become heavily impacted by the ocean floor archaeal community. The impact results from source inputs, their diagenetic and catagenetic alteration, and further overprint by the additions of lipids from the ocean floor sedimentary archaeal community. We then present a method to correct the overprints by using IPLs (intact polar lipids) extracted from both water column and subsurface archaeal communities.\n\nTesting the effect of bioturbation and species abundance upon discrete-depth individual foraminifera analysis\n\nBryan C. Lougheed and Brett Metcalfe\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 1195–1209, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1195-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1195-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurements on sea-dwelling shelled organisms called foraminifera retrieved from deep-sea sediment cores have been used to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) variation. To evaluate the method, we use a computer model to simulate millions of single foraminifera and how they become mixed in the sediment after being deposited on the seafloor. We compare the SST inferred from the single foraminifera in the sediment core to the true SST in the water, thus quantifying method uncertainties.\n\nTest-size evolution of the planktonic foraminifer Globorotalia menardii in the eastern tropical Atlantic since the Late Miocene\n\nThore Friesenhagen\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 777–805, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-777-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-777-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSize measurements of the planktonic foraminifer Globorotalia menardii and related forms are used to investigate the shell-size evolution for the last 8 million years in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. Long-term changes in the shell size coincide with major climatic, palaeogeographic and palaeoceanographic changes and suggest the occurrence of a new G. menardii type in the Atlantic Ocean ca. 2 million years ago.\n\nDistribution of coccoliths in surface sediments across the Drake Passage and calcification of Emiliania huxleyi morphotypes\n\nNele Manon Vollmar, Karl-Heinz Baumann, Mariem Saavedra-Pellitero, and IvÃ¡n HernÃ¡ndez-Almeida\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 585–612, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-585-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-585-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied recent (sub-)fossil remains of a type of algae (coccolithophores) off southernmost Chile and across the Drake Passage, adding to the scarce knowledge that exists in the Southern Ocean, a rapidly changing environment. We found that those can be used to reconstruct the surface ocean conditions in the north but not in the south. We also found variations in shape in the dominant species Emiliania huxleyi depending on the location, indicating subtle adaptations to environmental conditions.\n\nVertical distribution of planktic foraminifera through an oxygen minimum zone: how assemblages and test morphology reflect oxygen concentrations\n\nCatherine V. Davis, Karen Wishner, Willem Renema, and Pincelli M. Hull\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 977–992, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-977-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-977-2021, 2021\n\nReconstructing past variations in environmental conditions and paleoproductivity over the last ââ¼â8000 years off north-central Chile (30Â° S)\n\nPrÃ¡xedes MuÃ±oz, Lorena Rebolledo, Laurent Dezileau, Antonio Maldonado, Christoph Mayr, Paola CÃ¡rdenas, Carina B. Lange, Katherine Lalangui, Gloria Sanchez, Marco Salamanca, Karen Araya, Ignacio Jara, Gabriel Easton, and Marcel Ramos\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 5763–5785, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5763-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5763-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyze marine sedimentary records to study temporal changes in oxygen and productivity in marine waters of central Chile. We observed increasing oxygenation and decreasing productivity from 6000 kyr ago to the modern era that seem to respond to El NiÃ±o–Southern Oscillation activity. In the past centuries, deoxygenation and higher productivity are re-established, mainly in the northern zones of Chile and Peru. Meanwhile, in north-central Chile the deoxygenation trend is maintained.\n\nA 15-million-year-long record of phenotypic evolution in the heavily calcified coccolithophore Helicosphaera and its biogeochemical implications\n\nLuka Å upraha and Jorijntje Henderiks\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2955–2969, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2955-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2955-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe cell size, degree of calcification and growth rates of coccolithophores impact their role in the carbon cycle and may also influence their adaptation to environmental change. Combining insights from culture experiments and the fossil record, we show that the selection for smaller cells over the past 15 Myr has been a common adaptive trait among different lineages. However, heavily calcified species maintained a more stable biogeochemical output than the ancestral lineage of E. huxleyi.\n\nShell chemistry of the boreal Campanian bivalve Rastellum diluvianum (Linnaeus, 1767) reveals temperature seasonality, growth rates and life cycle of an extinct Cretaceous oyster\n\nNiels J. de Winter, Clemens V. Ullmann, Anne M. SÃ¸rensen, Nicolas Thibault, Steven Goderis, Stijn J. M. Van Malderen, Christophe Snoeck, Stijn Goolaerts, Frank Vanhaecke, and Philippe Claeys\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2897–2922, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2897-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2897-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we present a detailed investigation of the chemical composition of 12 specimens of very well preserved, 78-million-year-old oyster shells from southern Sweden. The chemical data show how the oysters grew, the environment in which they lived and how old they became and also provide valuable information about which chemical measurements we can use to learn more about ancient climate and environment from such shells. In turn, this can help improve climate reconstructions and models.\n\nSouthern California margin benthic foraminiferal assemblages record recent centennial-scale changes in oxygen minimum zone\n\nHannah M. Palmer, Tessa M. Hill, Peter D. Roopnarine, Sarah E. Myhre, Katherine R. Reyes, and Jonas T. Donnenfield\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2923–2937, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2923-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2923-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModern climate change is causing expansions of low-oxygen zones, with detrimental impacts to marine life. To better predict future ocean oxygen change, we study past expansions and contractions of low-oxygen zones using microfossils of seafloor organisms. We find that, along the San Diego margin, the low-oxygen zone expanded into more shallow water in the last 400 years, but the conditions within and below the low-oxygen zone did not change significantly in the last 1500 years.\n\nBaseline for ostracod-based northwestern Pacific and Indo-Pacific shallow-marine paleoenvironmental reconstructions: ecological modeling of species distributions\n\nYuanyuan Hong, Moriaki Yasuhara, Hokuto Iwatani, and Briony Mamo\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 585–604, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-585-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-585-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study analyzed microfaunal assemblages in surface sediments from 52 sites in Hong Kong marine waters. We selected 18 species for linear regression modeling to statistically reveal the relationship between species distribution and environmental factors. These results show environmental preferences of commonly distributed species on Asian coasts, providing a robust baseline for past environmental reconstruction of the broad Asian region using microfossils in sediment cores.\n\nNeogene Caribbean elasmobranchs: diversity, paleoecology and paleoenvironmental significance of the Cocinetas Basin assemblage (Guajira Peninsula, Colombia)\n\nJorge Domingo Carrillo-BriceÃ±o, Zoneibe Luz, Austin Hendy, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Kocsis, Orangel Aguilera, and Torsten Vennemann\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 33–56, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-33-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-33-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy combining taxonomy and geochemistry, we corroborated the described paleoenvironments from a Neogene fossiliferous deposit of South America. Shark teeth specimens were used for taxonomic identification and as proxies for geochemical analyses. With a multidisciplinary approach we refined the understanding about the paleoenvironmental setting and the paleoecological characteristics of the studied groups, in our case, for the bull shark and its incursions into brackish waters.\n\nCoastal primary productivity changes over the last millennium: a case study from the Skagerrak (North Sea)\n\nAnna Binczewska, BjÃ¸rg Risebrobakken, Irina Polovodova Asteman, Matthias Moros, Amandine Tisserand, Eystein Jansen, and Andrzej Witkowski\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5909–5928, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-5909-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-5909-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrimary productivity is an important factor in the functioning and structuring of the coastal ecosystem. Thus, two sediment cores from the Skagerrak (North Sea) were investigated in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of primary productivity changes during the last millennium and identify associated forcing factors (e.g. anthropogenic, climate). The cores were dated and analysed for palaeoproductivity proxies and palaeothermometers.\n\nA 1500-year multiproxy record of coastal hypoxia from the northern Baltic Sea indicates unprecedented deoxygenation over the 20th century\n\nSami A. Jokinen, Joonas J. Virtasalo, Tom Jilbert, JÃ©rÃ´me Kaiser, Olaf Dellwig, Helge W. Arz, Jari HÃ¤nninen, Laura Arppe, Miia Collander, and Timo Saarinen\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 3975–4001, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-3975-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-3975-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOxygen deficiency is a major environmental problem deteriorating seafloor habitats especially in the coastal ocean with large human impact. Here we apply a wide set of chemical and physical analyses to a 1500-year long sediment record and show that, although long-term climate variability has modulated seafloor oxygenation in the coastal northern Baltic Sea, the oxygen loss over the 20th century is unprecedentedly severe, emphasizing the need to reduce anthropogenic nutrient input in the future.\n\nTechnical note: An empirical method for absolute calibration of coccolith thickness\n\nSaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez-Lemos, JosÃ© GuitiÃ¡n, Miguel-Ãngel Fuertes, JosÃ©-Abel Flores, and Heather M. Stoll\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 1079–1091, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1079-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1079-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in atmospheric carbon dioxide affect ocean chemistry and the ability of marine organisms to manufacture shells from calcium carbonate. We describe a technique to obtain more reproducible measurements of the thickness of calcium carbonate shells made by microscopic marine algae called coccolithophores, which will allow researchers to compare how the shell thickness responds to variations in ocean chemistry in the past and present.\n\nReconstructing Holocene temperature and salinity variations in theÂ western Baltic Sea region: a multi-proxy comparison from theÂ LittleÂ Belt (IODP ExpeditionÂ 347, SiteÂ M0059)\n\nUlrich Kotthoff, Jeroen Groeneveld, Jeanine L.

Passey, Ole RÃ¸nÃ¸ Clausen, Ole Bennike, Elinor AndrÃ©n, Wojciech Granoszewski, Thomas AndrÃ©n, Helena L. Filipsson, Marit-Solveig Seidenkrantz, Caroline P. Slomp, and Thorsten Bauersachs\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 5607–5632, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-5607-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-5607-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present reconstructions of paleotemperature, paleosalinity, and paleoecology from the Little Belt (Site M0059) over the past ~ 8000 years and evaluate the applicability of numerous proxies. Conditions were lacustrine until ~ 7400 cal yr BP. A transition to brackish–marine conditions then occurred within ~ 200 years. Salinity proxies rarely allowed quantitative estimates but revealed congruent results, while quantitative temperature reconstructions differed depending on the proxies used.\n\nThe oxic degradation of sedimentary organic matter 1400 Ma constrains atmospheric oxygen levels\n\nShuichang Zhang, Xiaomei Wang, Huajian Wang, Emma U. Hammarlund, Jin Su, Yu Wang, and Donald E. Canfield\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 2133–2149, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2133-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2133-2017, 2017\n\nGeochemical and microstructural characterisation of two species of cool-water bivalves (Fulvia tenuicostata and Soletellina biradiata) from Western Australia\n\nLiza M. Roger, Annette D. George, Jeremy Shaw, Robert D. Hart, Malcolm Roberts, Thomas Becker, Bradley J. McDonald, and Noreen J. Evans\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 1721–1737, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-1721-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-1721-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe shell compositions of bivalve species from south Western Australia are described here to better understand the factors involved in their formation. The shell composition can be used to reconstruct past environmental conditions, but certain species manifest an offset compared to the environmental parameters measured. As shown here, shells that experience the same conditions can present different compositions in relation to structure, organic composition and environmental conditions.\n\nEcological response to collapse of the biological pump following the mass extinction at the CretaceousâPaleogene boundary\n\nJohan Vellekoop, Lineke Woelders, Sanem AÃ§ikalin, Jan Smit, Bas van de Schootbrugge, Ismail Ã. Yilmaz, Henk Brinkhuis, and Robert P. Speijer\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 885–900, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-885-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-885-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, ~ 66 Ma, is characterized by a mass extinction. We studied groups of both surface-dwelling and bottom-dwelling organisms to unravel the oceanographic consequences of these extinctions. Our integrated records indicate that a reduction of the transport of organic matter to the sea floor resulted in enhanced recycling of nutrients in the upper water column and decreased food supply at the sea floor in the first tens of thousands of years after the extinctions.\n\nQuantifying the Cenozoic marine diatom deposition history: links to the C and Si cycles\n\nJohan Renaudie\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 6003–6014, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-6003-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-6003-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMarine planktonic diatoms are today both the main silica and carbon exporter to the deep sea. However, 50 million years ago, radiolarians were the main silica exporter and diatoms were a rare, geographically restricted group. Quantification of their rise to dominance suggest that diatom abundance is primarily controlled by the continental weathering and has a negative feedback, observable on a geological timescale, on the carbon cycle.\n\nAnthropogenically induced environmental changes in the northeastern Adriatic Sea in the last 500Â years (Panzano Bay, Gulf of Trieste)\n\nJelena VidoviÄ, RafaÅ Nawrot, Ivo Gallmetzer, Alexandra Haselmair, Adam TomaÅ¡ovÃ½ch, Michael Stachowitsch, Vlasta ÄosoviÄ, and Martin Zuschin\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 5965–5981, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5965-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5965-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied the ecological history of the Gulf of Trieste. Before the 20th century, the only activity here was ore mining, releasing high amounts of mercury into its northern part, Panzano Bay. Mercury did not cause changes to microorganisms, as it is not bioavailable. In the 20th century, agriculture caused nutrient enrichment in the bay and increased diversity of microorganisms. Industrial activities increased the concentrations of pollutants, causing only minor changes to microorganisms.\n\nPalaeohydrological changes over the last 50â¯ky in the central Gulf of Cadiz: complex forcing mechanisms mixing multi-scale processes\n\nAurÃ©lie Penaud, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Eynaud, Antje Helga Luise Voelker, and Jean-Louis Turon\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 5357–5377, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5357-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5357-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents new analyses conducted at high resolution in the Gulf of Cadiz over the last 50 ky. Palaeohydrological changes in these subtropical latitudes are discussed through dinoflagellate cyst assemblages but also dinocyst transfer function results, implying sea surface temperature and salinity as well as annual productivity reconstructions. This study is thus important for our understanding of past and future productivity regimes, also implying consequences on the biological pump.\n\nDinocyst assemblage constraints on oceanographic and atmospheric processes in the eastern equatorial Atlantic over the last 44â¯kyr\n\nWilliam Hardy, AurÃ©lie Penaud, Fabienne Marret, Germain Bayon, Tania Marsset, and Laurence Droz\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 4823–4841, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4823-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4823-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur approach is based on a multi-proxy study from a core collected off the Congo River and discusses surface oceanic conditions (upwelling cells, river-induced upwelling), land–sea interactions and terrestrial erosion and in particular enables us to spatially constrain the migration of atmospheric systems. This paper thus presents new data highlighting, with the highest resolution ever reached in this region, the great correlation between phytoplanktonic organisms and monsoonal mechanisms.\n\nSedimentary response to sea ice and atmospheric variability over the instrumental period off AdÃ©lie Land, East Antarctica\n\nPhilippine Campagne, Xavier Crosta, Sabine Schmidt, Marie NoÃ«lle Houssais, Olivier Ther, and Guillaume MassÃ©\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 4205–4218, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4205-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4205-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDiatoms and biomarkers have been recently used for palaeoclimate reconstructions in the Southern Ocean. Few sediment-based ecological studies have investigated their relationships with environmental conditions. Here, we compare high-resolution sedimentary records with meteorological data to study relationships between our proxies and recent atmospheric and sea surface changes. Our results indicate that coupled wind pattern and sea surface variability act as the proximal forcing at that scale.\n\nEquatorward phytoplankton migration during a cold spell within the Late Cretaceous super-greenhouse\n\nNiels A. G. M. van Helmond, Appy Sluijs, Nina M. Papadomanolaki, A. Guy Plint, Darren R. GrÃ¶cke, Martin A. Pearce, James S. Eldrett, JoÃ£o Trabucho-Alexandre, Ireneusz Walaszczyk, Bas van de Schootbrugge, and Henk Brinkhuis\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 2859–2872, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-2859-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-2859-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOver the past decades large changes have been observed in the biogeographical dispersion of marine life resulting from climate change. To better understand present and future trends it is important to document and fully understand the biogeographical response of marine life during episodes of environmental change in the geological past. Here we investigate the response of phytoplankton, the base of the marine food web, to a rapid cold spell, interrupting greenhouse conditions during the Cretaceous.\n\nUpwellings mitigated Plio-Pleistocene heat stress for reef corals on the Florida platform (USA)\n\nThomas C. Brachert, Markus Reuter, Stefan KrÃ¼ger, Julia Kirkerowicz, and James S. Klaus\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 1469–1489, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-1469-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-1469-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present stable isotope proxy data and calcification records from fossil reef corals. The corals investigated derive from the Florida carbonate platform and are of middle Pliocene to early Pleistocene age. From the data we infer an environment subject to intermittent upwelling on annual to decadal timescales. Calcification rates were enhanced during periods of upwelling. This is likely an effect of dampened SSTs during the upwelling.\n\nMillennial changes in North Atlantic oxygen concentrations\n\nB. A. A. Hoogakker, D. J. R. Thornalley, and S. Barker\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 211–221, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-211-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-211-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModels predict a decrease in future ocean O2, driven by surface water warming and freshening in the polar regions, causing a reduction in ocean circulation. Here we assess this effect in the past, focussing on the response of deep and intermediate waters from the North Atlantic during large-scale ice rafting and millennial-scale cooling events of the last glacial. Our assessment agrees with the models but also highlights the importance of biological processes driving ocean O2 change.\n\nVanishing coccolith vital effects with alleviated carbon limitation\n\nM. Hermoso, I. Z. X. Chan, H. L. O. McClelland, A. M. C. Heureux, and R. E. M. Rickaby\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 301–312, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-301-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-301-2016, 2016\n\nLate Pleistocene glacialâinterglacial shell-sizeâisotope variability in planktonic foraminifera as a function of local hydrography\n\nB. Metcalfe, W. Feldmeijer, M. de Vringer-Picon, G.-J. A. Brummer, F. J. C. Peeters, and G. M. Ganssen\n\nBiogeosciences, 12, 4781–4807, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-4781-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-4781-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIron biogeochemical budgets during the natural ocean fertilisation experiment KEOPS-2 showed that complex circulation and transport pathways were responsible for differences in the mode and strength of iron supply, with vertical supply dominant on the plateau and lateral supply dominant in the plume. The exchange of iron between dissolved, biogenic and lithogenic pools was highly dynamic, resulting in a decoupling of iron supply and carbon export and controlling the efficiency of fertilisation.\n\nCoral records of reef-water pH across the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia: assessing the influence of river runoff on inshore reefs\n\nJ. P. D'Olivo, M. T. McCulloch, S. M. Eggins, and J. Trotter\n\nBiogeosciences, 12, 1223–1236, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-1223-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-1223-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe boron isotope composition in the skeleton of massive Porites corals from the central Great Barrier Reef is used to reconstruct the seawater pH over the 1940-2009 period. The long-term decline in the coral-reconstructed seawater pH is in close agreement with estimates based on the CO2 uptake by surface waters due to rising atmospheric levels. We also observed a significant relationship between terrestrial runoff data and the inshore coral boron isotopes records.\n\nRecords of past mid-depth ventilation: Cretaceous ocean anoxic event 2 vs. Recent oxygen minimum zones\n\nJ. SchÃ¶nfeld, W. Kuhnt, Z. Erdem, S. FlÃ¶gel, N. Glock, M. Aquit, M. Frank, and A. Holbourn\n\nBiogeosciences, 12, 1169–1189, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-1169-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-1169-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTodayâs oceans show distinct mid-depth oxygen minima while whole oceanic basins became transiently anoxic in the Mesozoic. To constrain past bottom-water oxygenation, we compared sediments from the Peruvian OMZ with the Cenomanian OAE 2 from Morocco. Corg accumulation rates in laminated OAE 2 sections match Holocene rates off Peru. Laminated deposits are found at oxygen levels of < 7Âµmol kg-1; crab burrows appear at 10Âµmol kg-1 today, both defining threshold values for palaeoreconstructions.\n\nOrganomineral nanocomposite carbon burial during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2\n\nS.
