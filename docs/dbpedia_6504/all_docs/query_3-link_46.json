        "text": "One award is available to pursue a full-time Master's degree in Global and International Studies (MGIS) at the Universidad de Salamanca (USAL), one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in Spain. USAL has a multilingual and multicultural student body with more than 10,000 international students who go to Salamanca every year. The city is a fundamentally university-focused city in which more than 40,000 students live as part of a population of 170,000 inhabitants.\n\nAs detailed on the USAL website, the program includes diverse but complementary components.\n\nAcademic offerings: multiple cutting-edge Master's programs with international faculty members, including several prestigious American professors and practitioners, together with their Spanish and other European colleagues.\n\nAn ambitious internship program that provides professional opportunities both in Europe and Washington, D.C.\n\nThis award is co-sponsored by the USAL.\n\nAdditional Information: Classes will be taught in English, and the students must complete all written and oral assignments in English.\n\nSome proficiency in Spanish is recommended for daily life. English is not widely spoken in Salamanca, especially among middle-aged and older people. The Global and International Studies Program is partnered with the Office of International Studies, one of the best Spanish-language training programs in Spain, and is available to students who wish to develop their language skills in Spanish.\n\nTo be considered for this Award, two separate applications are required:\n\nApplicants must apply for the Fulbright Award through the Fulbright online application system\n\nApplicants must also apply for admission to the MGIS program directly at the Universidad de Salamanca. More information on the admissions process can be found at: https://globalandinternationalstudies.com\n\nApplicants are not required to have a letter of admission/affiliation at the time of the Fulbright application, but awards are made conditional upon admission at the Universidad de Salamanca no later than February 15, 2025. Applicants are encouraged to apply to the MGIS at the Universidad de Salamanca as soon as possible.\n\nThe Universidad de Salamanca will notify Fulbright directly of all semi finalists who have been accepted to the MGIS program by the February 15th deadline.\n\nStipend amounts vary depending on the cost of living in the placement region, and are calculated based on factors such as rent prices, transportation, and food costs. The stipend is calculated to cover these basic expenses and to allow grantees to live comfortably on a budget.\n\nGrants are disbursed to grant recipients’ Spanish bank accounts in two-month installments. Grant recipients have the option to request their round-trip travel stipend to their US bank account or receive it upon their arrival in Spain.\n\nGrant recipients will be in contact with the member of the Commission that manages their program or region. Grant recipients will receive access to comprehensive information in the summer prior to their grant, including, but not limited to: instructions for applying for a visa; information on the housing search; guidance on first steps in the host country; and developing one’s health plan in concert with provided health coverage in-country.\n\nGrant recipients will also receive access to an Online Guide, a comprehensive resource with specific information ranging from finance and budgeting, cultural adjustment, health care, and documentation. The Online Guide is updated every year with the most current information about specific regions, cultural events, and volunteer opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, for programs already established in the host region, grantees will have access to the support of a mentor. Mentors are second-year grantees that are renewing in the same region and host institution, and offer support for grantees in their transition to their host region or program.\n\nThe Mid-Year Seminar is an annual gathering of all Fulbright U.S. Student grantees in Spain in which grantees come together to share information about their grants and reflect on their Fulbright experiences at the midway point of their grant period.\n\nCost of Living also varies greatly from region to region and between rural and urban areas in Spain. All stipends are set in accordance with local estimated cost of living and cover the cost of living for a modest lifestyle in the Host Region or Country: renting a room in a shared flat, purchasing meals and groceries, as well as commuting using public transportation. The grant stipend is not intended to cover costs associated with living alone, frequent travel within or outside of the Host Region, or covering expenses like dry cleaning, media subscriptions, or accrued student loan debts. Grantees from varied socioeconomic backgrounds have found the stipend sufficient with the deferment of student loans and sensible budgeting for personal expenses outside the standard costs of living.\n\nThis website provides helpful information related to the cost of living in Spain:\n\nhttps://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/"
