        "text": "Census Data for Salamanca\n\nPopulation ...\n\nThe most recent Census Estimate<1> was for 2019 and it gave Salamanca a population of 5,414 people.\n\nThe last Decennial Census<2> was in 2010, which gave Salamanca a population of 5,815 people.\n\nThe city of Salamanca is located in Cattaraugus County. The 2010 Census gave Cattaraugus County; a population of 80,317 people. This means that Salamanca had 7.24% of the county's total population, making it Cattaraugus' 3rd most populous community.\n\nAt the same time, New York had a population of 19,378,102 people, meaning that Salamanca had 0.03% of the total population of New York - making it the state's 419th most populous community.\n\nArea ...\n\nThe 2010 Census shows that the sampling area for Salamanca has a total area of 6.24 square miles [16.2 km²]. Of this total, 5.99 square miles [15.5 km²] is land, with the balance (3.88%) being water (0.24 square miles [0.6 km²]).\n\nCattaraugus County has a land area of 1,308 square miles [3,388.6 km²]. At 5.99 square miles [15.5 km²], Salamanca has 0.46% of the county's total land area.\n\nContinue Reading ...\n\nWhen the Census Bureau conducts a census for a city like Salamanca, they draw a boundary around the area in which they are going to conduct their count - this defines the sampling area (usually a polygon). The shape of the sampling area can be quite complex and it's important to keep in mind that the boundaries of the sampling area may or may not match the recognized boundaries of the city.\n\nThings like population, area and housing for Salamanca reflect the sampling area. Since the shape of the sampling area and the actual boundaries of Salamanca might be different, it's best to check with the U.S. Census Bureau to resolve any difference between the two.\n\nNot only does the sampling area define boundaries, it also has a GPS location (latitude & longitude) that indicates a point within the sampling area (usually the center of the polygon, known as the centroid). At the time of the 2010 Census, the sampling area was located at:\n\nLat: 42° 9' 53\" (or 42.16°)\n\nLon: -78° 44' 28\" (or -78.74°)\n\nMore information on this topic and the changes between the 2000 Census and the 2010 Census can be found in the section for our Census-to-Census Observations ... (see below).\n\nHousing Units ...\n\nAt the time of the 2010 Census, Salamanca had 2,842 Housing Units<3> and with its population of 5,815 people, this averages 2.05 people per Housing Unit.\n\nContinue Reading ...\n\nThe 2010 Census shows Salamanca had a land area of 5.99 square miles [15.5 km²]. This translates to 455.7 Housing Units per square mile [176 housing units/km²].\n\nFrom the Census of 2000: Salamanca had 2,749 Housing Units, a population of 6,097 people and a land area of 6 square miles [15.5 km²]. This gives a density of 2.22 people per Housing Unit and 440.9 Housing Units per square mile [170.2 housing units/km²].\n\nNote: Repeating the caution above (under Population Density), be aware that when comparing Housing Units between the 2010 Census and the 2000 Census, there were changes in the sampling area for Salamanca and you need to be careful when comparing between the censuses. More information about the changes can be found in the section called Census-to-Census Observations ... (see below).\n\nCattaraugus County ...\n\nThe community of Salamanca is located in Cattaraugus County<4>.\n\nThe county had a population of 80,317 people at the 2010 Census. With it's population of 5,815 people, Salamanca represented 7.24% of the county's total.\n\nIn addition, where the city of Salamanca has a population density of 932 people per square mile [360 people/km²], Cattaraugus County averages 61.4 people per square mile [23.7 people/km²].\n\nFor more information, please visit our Census Page for Cattaraugus County.\n\nCensus-to-Census Observations ...\n\nIntroduction ...\n\nWhen the Census Bureau takes a census count (or enumeration) for Salamanca, they start by specifying the boundaries of the area to be counted. This area (or sampling area) is a polygon and its shape can be quite complex - it may or may not match the geographical boundaries of Salamanca. It's important to note that from one Census to the next, the shape and location of the polygon can change.\n\nContinue Reading ...\n\nAlthough we don't have specific information about the shape of the polygon for Salamanca or how it changed has over time, there is some information that can give us some hints. For example, since the shape of the sampling area is directly related to the shape of the polygon, any change to area probably indicates a new shape for the polygon.\n\nIf you need precision or details about the methodology of the Census, you should visit the U.S. Census Bureau for a definitive answer.\n\nLocation ...\n\nWhile generally coinciding with the GPS location (latitude/longitude) of Salamanca, the latitude and longitude given by the Census Bureau actually indicates the GPS location of the polygon for Salamanca.\n\nContinue Reading ...\n\nFor the 2010 Census, the location was given as:\n\nLat: 42.164734° (or 42°9'53\" N)\n\nLon: -78.741263° (or -78°44'28\" W)\n\nFor the 2000 Census, the location given was:\n\nLat: 42.158742° (or 42°9'31\" N)\n\nLon: -78.715886° (or -78°42'57\" W)\n\nThe difference indicates that the U.S. Census Bureau moved the location of the polygon for the 2010 Census 7,197 feet to the west<5> of the location that was used in the 2000 Census.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) have assigned a unique GNIS identifier (#979450) to Salamanca. This identifier also marks a GPS point on the map, and that point lies within the boundaries of Salamanca. The GNIS point has been mapped to the latitude/longitude:\n\nLat: 42.164230° (or 42°9'51\" N)\n\nLon: -78.722531° (or -78°43'21\" W)\n\nThe GPS location given for the 2010 Census lies 5,065 feet to the west<6> of the point given by the GNIS for Salamanca. For more information about this and the relationship of the various Federal Codes, please visit our Misc Page for Salamanca.\n\nMiscellaneous Information for Salamanca ...\n\nThe Federal government has assigned various identifying codes to each community, county and state. At one time or another, the US Census Bureau has used one (or more) of the following identifiers when referring to either Cattaraugus County or the city of Salamanca:\n\nThe GNIS Codes ...\n\nThe current system of identification is called the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The following GNIS codes relate to Salamanca:\n\nGNIS ID for Salamanca: 979450\n\nGNIS ID for Cattaraugus County: 974103\n\nGNIS ID for State of New York: 1779796\n\nThe FIPS Codes ...\n\nAn earlier (and largely obsolete) identification method was called the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS):\n\nState Code: 36 (New York)\n\nCounty Code: 009 (Cattaraugus County)\n\nPlace Code: 64749 (Salamanca)\n\nState & County Code: 36/009 (New York / Cattaraugus County)\n\nState & Place Code: 36/64749 (New York / Salamanca)\n\nMisc. Census Codes ...\n\nSalamanca is located in Census Region #1 (the Northeast Region) and Division #2 (the Middle Atlantic Division).\n\nThe US Postal Service ZIP Code ...\n\nWhile some people have used a ZIP code to identify a community, the purpose of the ZIP code was to make mail delivery more efficient by grouping addresses together. Although the ZIP Code doesn't specifically identify a city like Salamanca, it does identify addresses that are in (or near) Salamanca. It's important to remember that the boundaries of a ZIP Code can be changed, re-assigned or overlapped with other ZIP Codes.\n\nThe ZIP code for Salamanca:14779<7>\n\nCensus ZCTA Codes ...\n\nThe US Census Bureau created statistical entities that they call ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and these ZCTAs are frequently confused with the ZIP codes that come from the US Postal Service (USPS).\n\nZCTAs were first created for the 2000 Census and at that time, they were based upon the USPS ZIP codes. While largely covering the same areas, the boundaries of a ZCTA do not necessarily match the boundaries of a postal ZIP code with the same number. For example, while a postal ZIP code can cross a county or state line, a Census ZCTA can not. They should be treated as separate entities with no correlation between them.\n\nFor more information about the various Federal identification codes, please visit our Misc Page for Salamanca.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know of a website for Salamanca. If you can help, please contact us through our Feedback Page.\n\nThe official website for Cattaraugus County: www.co.cattaraugus.ny.us/\n\nThe official website for State of New York: https://www.ny.gov/\n\nThe official website of the U.S. Census Bureau\n\nThe official website of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN)\n\nThe official website of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)\n\nFootnotes ...\n\n<1>Every year, the US Census Bureau creates a population estimate for the preceeding year. Keep in mind that this value is an estimate and not an actual count. The most recent Census estimate is for the year 2019. <2>Every 10 years (eg- 1990, 2000, 2010), the US Census Bureau conducts a Constitutionally-mandated count (or enumeration) of people living within the United States. This count is called a Decennial Census. The last Decennial Census was the 2010 Census, with the next one planned for 2020. <3>A Housing Unit is a broad term for those places where people live (whether occupied or temporarily vacant), such as a house, an apartment, a mobile home, or an area that is considered as a separate living quarter. Separate living quarters (consisting of one or more rooms) are considered to be those places where people live, sleep and eat separately from others and that have access to the outside (either directly or by a shared hallway). <4>If you're interested in how the shape of New York's counties, including Cattaraugus, have changed over time, we recommend the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries. <5>The calculated bearing (or angle) to the 2010 Census location is 72 degrees and a distance of 7,197 feet. <6>The calculated bearing (or angle) to the GNIS point is 87 degrees and a distance of 5,065 feet. <7>When looking for a ZIP Code, whether Salamanca or elsewhere, it's always best to check the website of the United States Postal Service (USPS)."
