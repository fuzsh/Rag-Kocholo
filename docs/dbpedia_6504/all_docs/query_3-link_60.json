We compared Pediatric Emergency Department visits, bronchiolitis admissions, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases in 2020 with those documented for the preceding four years.\n\nMethods\n\nThis was a retrospective multicentric national survey study, driven by the Pediatric Spanish Society, and gathering monthly data from Spanish hospitals between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2020. An Interrupted Time Series Analysis and Poisson regression models were performed for each index.\n\nResults\n\nThirty-eight hospitals representing most of the different regions of Spain participated. Compared to the preceding four years, in 2020, Pediatric emergency department visits significantly decreased immediately after initiation of the national lockdown. The median number of visits averted per month was 39,754 (IQR 26,539–50,065). RSV diagnoses during the 2020 winter season nearly disappeared with only 21 cases being documented among participating hospitals. The expected seasonal peak of bronchiolitis hospitalizations never occurred. The median number of admissions in 2020 averted per month was 100 (IQR 37–185) compared to 2016–2019. Only 3 hospitalized cases were RSV-confirmed. Reopening of schools and kindergarten was not associated with a remarkable increase in RSV cases or bronchiolitis hospitalizations.\n\nConclusion\n\nA dramatic reduction of bronchiolitis admissions and near disappearance of RSV cases was observed in Spanish hospitals coinciding with the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nKeywords: Bronchiolitis, viral; Respiratory syncytial viruses; COVID-19; Infection; Respiratory Tract\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAEP\n\nPediatric Spanish Society.\n\nPED\n\nPediatric Emergency Department.\n\nPICU\n\nPediatric Intensive Care Unit.\n\nITSA\n\nInterrupted time series analysis.\n\nIQR\n\nInterquartile range.\n\nNPIs\n\nNon-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nRSV\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAcute bronchiolitis is the leading cause of admission in children under 1 year of age. More than 70% of cases are produced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), usually with a seasonal epidemic pattern between October and March in the Northern Hemisphere [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the epidemiological situation of acute respiratory infections globally and has triggered a generalized implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce transmission. These facts have impacted viral circulation and respiratory tract infections incidence worldwide [2], [3], [4], [5].\n\nThe objectives of this study were (1) to describe monthly visits to Pediatric Emergency Department (PED), RSV-confirmed infections, and acute bronchiolitis admissions in Spanish hospitals from January 2016 to December 2020 and, (2) to analyze and compare bronchiolitis and RSV epidemics during COVID-19 pandemic with the corresponding previous seasons for a better understating of their causes and future implications on healthcare management.\n\n2. Patients and methods\n\nThis was a retrospective multicentric national study using data obtained from Spanish hospitals. We included patients under two years of age diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2020. Data were collected following a pre-established research protocol and through a survey sent to collaborating hospitals in Pediatric Spanish Society (AEP) within the National Project RSV/COVID-AEP. Cases were monthly identified from hospitalization and PED diagnostic codes, and microbiology charts.\n\nAn interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) was carried out and Poisson regression models were estimated. Variance was considered to be proportional to the mean to account for over dispersion [6]. Due to the nature of these data, seasonality was controlled using Fourier terms (pairs of sine and cosine functions) [6,7]. The significance level was set at 0.05. The analysis was carried out using Stata® [8]. The study received the approval of the local ethics committee (HULP: PI-4573).\n\n3. Results\n\nA total of 38 hospitals from different regions in Spain participated in this study ( ), gathering monthly data from January 2016 to December 2020. Monthly median of cases observed for each index are outlined in .\n\nTable 1\n\nYearEmergency department visitsTotal RSV diagnosesBronchiolitis admissionsRSV-confirmed admissionsPICU bronchiolitis admissionsPICU RSV-confirmed admissions201683,785.5 [72,064.5 – 91,259.5]547.5 [50.0 – 1362.0]169.0 [92.5 – 559.0]43.5 [10.0 – 383.0]9.0 [6.0 – 52.5]4.0 [0.0 – 43.0]201783,380.0 [74,310.5 – 88,431.5]932.5 [132.0 – 1659.0]192.0 [88.0 – 677.0]57.5 [15.0 – 475.0]15.0 [6.5 – 67.5]5.0 [2.0 – 51.0]201879,936.0 [71,632.5 – 85,201.5]626.0 [237.0 – 1527.5]223.0 [91.5 – 518.5]59.0 [16.0 – 371.5]23.0 [7.5 – 75.0]6.0 [1.0 – 48.0]201982,577.0 [71,249.5 – 89,908.0]645.5 [114.0 – 1507.5]192.5 [67.5 – 512.5]45.5 [5.5 – 371.5]17.0 [5.0 – 68.0]4.5 [1.0 – 41.5]202042,923.5 [35,118.0 – 50,274.0]5.5 [1.0 – 76.5]51.5 [17.5 – 144.5]0.5 [0.0 – 32.5]5.0 [1.0 – 19.5]0.0 [0.0 – 6.0]\n\n3.1. Pediatric emergency department visits\n\nIn 2020, there were 579,393 visits to the PED, a 40% reduction of the annual visits compared to those occurring in the period 2016–2019. These were significantly lower than those expected according to our model ( A). This trend was observed for every month since March 2020, when general lockdown was established in Spain. The minimum number of visits was in April 2020 (18,366).\n\n3.2. RSV diagnoses\n\nIn 2020, there were 3912 RSV diagnoses, a 65.9% reduction compared to 2016–2019. However, nearly all RSV cases in 2020 were detected from January to March, at the tail end of the 2019–2020 winter RSV season. From May 2020, RSV cases disappeared and only a few cases were reported even during the expected seasonal epidemic: six cases in September, three in October, seven in November, and five in December ( B).\n\n3.3. Bronchiolitis admissions\n\nIn 2020, there were 1962 hospitalizations, a 62.1% reduction compared to 2016–2019. However, most of these admissions occurred in the first months of 2020. If we focus on the 2020 winter season, only 279 patients (14.1% of the total 1962) were admitted with bronchiolitis. Of these, only 3 cases were due to RSV-confirmed infection. The expected seasonal peak of bronchiolitis and RSV hospitalizations in our model did not appear during the 2020 winter season compared to the preceding 5 years ( C and D). Similarly, bronchiolitis admissions to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) decreased dramatically. During the 2020 winter season, 27 patients required PICU admission (compared to 492–674 cases from 2016 to 2019), and only one of them was due to RSV-confirmed disease.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis study revealed a dramatic reduction of bronchiolitis admissions and near disappearance of RSV cases in 2020 winter season compared to the same period in the preceding four years in Spanish hospitals. This reduction of cases represents a significant decrease in the burden of disease by any cause, and particularly by bronchiolitis and RSV-associated infections. However, yearly numbers underestimate the real reduction of cases, as the period January-March 2020 presents the anticipated number of subjects corresponding to the previous season. The general lockdown in Spain was established on 14th March 2020, notably reducing PED visits henceforth. Lockdown measures were progressively relaxed in May and schools reopened in September 2020, when bronchiolitis and RSV cases were expected to re-appear. Despite reopening of schools, PED visits just mildly increased, and bronchiolitis cases remained at a minimum. Even more surprisingly, RSV diagnoses were nearly zero at least until the end of 2020. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have displaced other respiratory viruses with a disproportionate effect on RSV, probably replacing their ecological niche, among other factors.\n\nThe first reports came from the Southern Hemisphere, where RSV season typically occurs from April to June. Compared to the preceding years, RSV diagnoses decreased between 68 and 98% [3,9], and PED attendance and bronchiolitis admissions were 70% and 85% lower, respectively [2]. Afterwards, reports from the Northern Hemisphere showed more than 80–95% reduction in RSV detections and bronchiolitis hospitalizations during September-December 2020 [4,[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. In a study performed in the East of Spain (ECEALHBA project), a 94% decrease in bronchiolitis admissions was observed [15]. Similarly to RSV, Influenza virus has also experienced a 94–99.4% worldwide case reduction during 2020 [3,4,12,13,16,17].\n\nMeasures to prevent transmission in schools were implemented during the reopening of schools in Spain, but outside school there remained opportunities for viral transmission from other children or family. Though at lower levels, other viruses (rhinovirus, adenovirus or bocavirus) seemed less affected and continued circulating all over the year [12]. As a consequence, NPIs cannot fully explain the uneven interruption of RSV transmission we have observed. Other mechanisms, such as virologic features among other factors, may contribute to explain these differences.\n\nAfter relaxation of NPIs, some countries have experienced a delayed RSV epidemic peak 2–6 months later than expected, with variable severity [18]. In Spain we observed a 7-months delayed transmission wave, starting in early May 2021 and peaking in the first week of July [19]. Schools in Spain have been opened from September 2020 until June 2021, suggesting that reopening schools with adequate security measures may not have a crucial impact in SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory virus transmission. However, current surveillance systems appear insufficient. An active effort in epidemiological surveillance throughout the year, irrespective of the expected peaks, is mandatory to anticipate and adapt healthcare systems to the uncertain viral environment.\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, clinical or other laboratory information were not collected, so we could not study other viruses that cause bronchiolitis apart from RSV or individual clinical follow-up. Second, we cannot exclude that changes in health-seeking behavior related to COVID-19 may have impacted viral detections. Nevertheless, a strength of this study is the great number of participating hospitals from different regions in Spain, that gives a national perspective of the epidemiological situation.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nA dramatic reduction of bronchiolitis admissions and near disappearance of RSV cases were observed in Spanish hospitals in the usual winter epidemic period, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The reappearance of RSV transmission with a delay of seven months, and most importantly, outside of the typical seasonal cycle, warrants the maintenance of strong surveillance mechanisms to further understand, predict, and manage future transmission of RSV and other causes of acute respiratory infections in children.\n\nFinancial disclosure\n\nNone declared.\n\nAuthor contribution\n\n#COVID-19-RSV Spanish hospitals-AEP study group: Santiago Lapeña Lopez de Armentia (Pediatrics Department, Complejo Asistencial Universitario de León), Mercedes Herranz Aguirre and Javier Nogueira Lopez (Pediatrics Department, Complejo Hospitalario de Navarro) Carlos Marcilla Vázquez and Marta Pareja León (Pediatrics Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete), José Tomás Ramos Amador and Marta Illán Ramos (Pediatrics Department, Hospital Universitario Clínico San Carlos), Francisco José Sanz-Santaeufemia and Raquel Jiménez García (Pediatrics Department, Hospital Infantil Universitario Niño Jesús), Javier Gonzalez de Dios (Pediatrics Department, Hospital General Universitario de Alicante), Irene Centelles Sales and Jesús Lucas García (Pediatrics Department, Hospital General Universitario Castellón), Rosa Rodriguez-Fernandez (Pediatrics Department, Hospital Infantil Gregorio Marañon), Júlia Morata Alba and Natividad Pons Fernandez (Pediatrics Department, Hospital Lluis Alcanyís de Xàtiva), Mercedes García Reymundo (Pediatrics Department, Hospital De Mérida), Juan José García and Ricard Casadevall (Pediatrics Department, Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Universitat de Barcelona), Jesús Ruiz Contreras (Pediatrics Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre; Universidad Complutense de Madrid), Juan Ignacio Sánchez Díaz (Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre; Universidad Complutense de Madrid), Sheila Martín Pino (AGC Pediatría, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias) and Juan Mayordomo Colunga (AGC Pediatría, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias; Centro de Investigación Biomédica En Red-Enfermedades Respiratorias.
