        "text": "The Eyes as Big as Plates duo is excited to be reporting from Tassie! We packed suitcases full of wire, film rolls and gaiters in the beginning of February and headed to nipaluna, aka Hobart on the Southern Sea. After two weeks of intense production mode, there are now eight brand new works in the series and the preparations are well underway for the launch of the most comprehensive Eyes as Big as Plates exhibition to date! For the Ten Days on the Island Festival, we have collaborated with eight locals around Tasmania as well as bull kelp, man ferns, seashells, tussocks, gum trees, leeches, white sands, buzzies and wallabies.\n\nReporting will continue from this promised land of eucalyptus until the end of March. If you’re in the neighbourhood, come and say hello and see the sculptures, videos and some never-before-seen photographs at the Long Gallery, Salamanca Arts Centre, 77 Salamanca Place in Hobart. We can’t wait to see you at the opening this Friday the 8th of March at 6pm!\n\nOpening hours are 10am – 4pm everyday until the 24th of March. We’ll be touring and talking about our Tasmanian adventures in Bruny Island on the 9th at the Nayri Niara Festival, in Burnie on the north coast on the 12th and in Kingston on the 20th of March. On the 23rd you can join us at the Long Gallery in Hobart for an artist talk from 4-5pm.\n\nBig thanks to thank all our brave senior collaborators, the stellar team at Salamanca Arts Centre, ARCHIVALink’s boundless generosity, One Care, City of Hobart, Australia Council for the Arts, Australian Government’s Regional Arts Fund and Ten Days on the Island for inviting this tornado of a production to your backyard!"
