Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Salamanca is essentially constant during the spring, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 10, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Spring in Salamanca\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Spring in SalamancaMarAprMay0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%WinterSummerMar 10%Mar 10%May 310%May 310%Apr 10%Apr 10%May 10%May 10%comfortablecomfortabledrydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Salamanca is gradually decreasing during the spring, decreasing from 9.4 miles per hour to 8.5 miles per hour over the course of the season.\n\nFor reference, on April 6, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 10.2 miles per hour, while on August 26, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.9 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during the spring is 10.2 miles per hour on April 7.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Spring in Salamanca\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Spring in SalamancaMarAprMay0 mph0 mph5 mph5 mph10 mph10 mph15 mph15 mphWinterSummerApr 710.2 mphApr 710.2 mphMar 19.4 mphMar 19.4 mphMay 318.5 mphMay 318.5 mphMay 19.3 mphMay 19.3 mph\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Salamanca throughout the spring is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 42% on May 31.\n\nWind Direction in the Spring in Salamanca\n\nWind Direction in the Spring in SalamancaMarAprMay0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%WinterSummerwestsoutheastnorth\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Salamanca typically lasts for 6.5 months (199 days), from around April 14 to around October 30, rarely starting before March 23 or after May 4, and rarely ending before October 8 or after November 20.\n\nDuring the spring in Salamanca, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is very rapidly increasing rising from 0% to 100% over the course of the season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Spring in Salamanca\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Spring in Salamancagrowing seasonMarAprMay0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%WinterSummerMar 10%Mar 10%100%May 31100%May 31Apr 123%Apr 123%87%May 187%May 1freezingvery coldcoldcoolcomfortablewarmhot\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Salamanca are increasing during the spring, increasing by 445Â°F, from 30Â°F to 475Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Spring in Salamanca\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Salamanca is very rapidly increasing during the spring, rising by 3.6 kWh, from 4.0 kWh to 7.5 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Spring in Salamanca\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Spring in SalamancaMarAprMay0 kWh0 kWh1 kWh1 kWh2 kWh2 kWh3 kWh3 kWh4 kWh4 kWh5 kWh5 kWh6 kWh6 kWh7 kWh7 kWh8 kWh8 kWh9 kWh9 kWhWinterSummerMar 14.0 kWhMar 14.0 kWhMay 317.5 kWhMay 317.5 kWhApr 15.3 kWhApr 15.3 kWhMay 16.5 kWhMay 16.5 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Salamanca are 40.969 deg latitude, -5.664 deg longitude, and 2,674 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Salamanca contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 331 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 2,648 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (764 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (6,893 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Salamanca is covered by artificial surfaces (61%) and cropland (34%), within 10 miles by cropland (80%), and within 50 miles by cropland (60%) and trees (16%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Salamanca, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Salamanca.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Salamanca according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Salamanca is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Salamanca and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSalamanca Airport (LESA, 97%, 9 mi, east, -79 ft elevation change)\n\nBraganca (LPBG, 3.3%, 82 mi, northwest, -410 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Salamanca and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
