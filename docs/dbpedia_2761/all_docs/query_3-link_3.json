        "text": "The beautiful small community Vilhelmina is located by Lake Volgsjön in southern Lapland. Here culture, nature and exciting outdoor activities meet. With a large selection of culture, arts and crafts along with a wilderness around the corner, it is a place worth staying in a little longer.\n\nChurch towns are mainly a northern phenomenon. Church towns used to be a necessity here because the parishes could be huge on the surface. The church town in Vilhelmina is from the end of the 18th century. In the picturesque neighborhoods with their small alleys, there is also a local history museum, craft house ans a art gallery.\n\nYou stay in the charming old cottages, most of them with fireplaces and the so-called Vilhelmina wallpaper on the walls. Each cottage has its own special character, and is carefully renovated in older style.\n\nVilhelmina also offers a strong food and craft culture and fantastic nature experiences all around. Walk along Volgsjön and stop at Gubbseleforsen. Or take a walk and experience the Blaikfjället nature reserve. Here you will find easy-to-walk paths with nice stairs and beams. The fishing is world class with flowing water and lakes.\n\nPlease note that the reception is located at the Tourist Office, Tingsgatan 1 (Tingshuset). For check-in on weekends and after 5 pm, make sure to contact with the reception well in advance on telephone 0940-39887.\n\nEnjoy your stay here. Welcome to the beautiful community Vilhelmina!"
