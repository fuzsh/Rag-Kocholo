It is bordered to the north by the North Sea, Denmark, and the Baltic Sea; to the east by Poland and the Czech Republic; to the south by Austria and Switzerland; and to the west by France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The territory of Germany covers 357,021 square kilometers (137,847 sq mi) and is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. With 81.8 million inhabitants in January 2010, it has the largest population among member states of the European Union, and it is also home to the third-largest number of international migrants worldwide.\n\nA region named Germania, inhabited by several Germanic peoples, has been known and documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire, which lasted until 1806. During the 16th century, northern Germany became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. As a modern nation-state, the country was first unified amidst the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. In 1949, after World War II, Germany was divided into two separate states—East Germany and West Germany—along the lines of Allied occupation. Germany was reunified in 1990. West Germany was a founding member of the European Community (EC) in 1957, which became the European Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen zone and adopted the European currency, the euro, in 1999.\n\nGermany is a federal parliamentary republic of sixteen states (Länder). The capital and largest city is Berlin. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, G8, G20, OECD, and the WTO. It is a major power with the world's fourth largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth largest in purchasing power parity. It is the second largest exporter and second largest importer of goods. In absolute terms, Germany allocates the second biggest annual budget of development aid in the world, while its military expenditure ranked sixth. The country has developed a high standard of living and established a comprehensive system of social security. It holds a key position in European affairs and maintains a multitude of close partnerships on a global level. Germany is recognised as a scientific and technological leader in several fields.\n\nHistory\n\nThe English word \"Germany\" derives from the Latin word Germania. The name \"Germania\" came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it from a Gallic term for the peoples east of the Rhine that probably meant \"neighbour\"\n\nThe ethnogenesis of the Germanic tribes is assumed to have occurred during the Nordic Bronze Age, or at the latest, during the Pre-Roman Iron Age. From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, the tribes began expanding south, east and west in the 1st century BC, coming into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes in Eastern Europe. Little is known about early Germanic history, except through their recorded interactions with the Roman Empire, etymological research and archaeological finds.\n\nUnder Augustus, the Roman General Publius Quinctilius Varus began to invade Germania (a term used by the Romans to define a territory running roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains), and it was in this period that the Germanic tribes became familiar with Roman tactics of warfare while maintaining their tribal identity. In AD 9, three Roman legions led by Varus were defeated by the Cheruscan leader Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Modern Germany, as far as the Rhine and the Danube, thus remained outside the Roman Empire. By AD 100, the time of Tacitus' Germania, Germanic tribes settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus) , occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, southern Bavaria and the western Rhineland, however, were Roman provinces. The 3rd century saw the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes: Alamanni, Franks, Chatti, Saxons, Frisians, Sicambri, and Thuringii. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke through the Limes and the Danube frontier into Roman-controlled lands.\n\nHoly Roman Empire (962–1806)\n\nOn 25 December 800, Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire, which was divided in 843. The medieval empire resulted from the eastern portion of this division and existed in varying forms from 962 until 1806. Its territory stretched from the Eider River in the north to the Mediterranean coast in the south. Often referred to as the Holy Roman Empire (or the Old Empire), it was officially called the Sacrum Romanum Imperium Nationis Germanicæ (Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation) starting in 1448, to adjust the title to its then reduced territory.\n\nUnder the reign of the Ottonian emperors (919–1024), the duchies of Lorraine, Saxony, Franconia, Swabia, Thuringia, and Bavaria were consolidated, and the German king was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of these regions in 962. Under the reign of the Salian emperors (1024–1125), the Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy, although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy. Under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), the German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by Slavs, preceding German settlement in these areas and further east (Ostsiedlung). Northern German towns grew prosperous as members of the Hanseatic League. Starting with the Great Famine in 1315, then the Black Death of 1348–50, the population of Germany plummeted.\n\nThe edict of the Golden Bull in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire that lasted until its dissolution. It codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics. Beginning in the 15th century, the emperors were elected nearly exclusively from the Habsburg dynasty of Austria.\n\nThe monk Martin Luther publicised his 95 Theses in 1517, challenging practices of the Roman Catholic Church, initiating the Protestant Reformation. A separate Lutheran church became the official religion in many German states after 1530. Religious conflict led to the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), which devastated German lands. The population of the German states was reduced by about 30%. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) ended religious warfare among the German states, but the empire was de facto divided into numerous independent principalities. From 1740 onwards, the dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1806, the Imperium was overrun and dissolved as a result of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nRestoration and revolution (1814–1871)\n\nFollowing the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Congress of Vienna convened in 1814 and founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of 39 sovereign states. Disagreement with restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, demanding unity and freedom. These, however, were followed by new measures of repression on the part of the Austrian statesman Metternich. The Zollverein, a tariff union, profoundly furthered economic unity in the German states. During this era many Germans had been stirred by the ideals of the French Revolution, and nationalism became a more significant force, especially among young intellectuals. For the first time, the colours of black, red and gold were chosen to represent the movement, which later became the national colours.\n\nIn light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which successfully established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. The monarchs initially yielded to the revolutionaries' liberal demands. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement. Conflict between King William I of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed Otto von Bismarck the new Prime Minister of Prussia. Bismarck successfully waged war on Denmark in 1864. Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Federation (Norddeutscher Bund) and to exclude Austria, formerly the leading German state, from the affairs of the remaining German states.\n\nGerman Empire (1871–1918)\n\nThe state known as Germany was unified as a modern nation-state in 1871, when the German Empire was forged, with the Kingdom of Prussia as its largest constituent. After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the German Empire was proclaimed in Versailles on 18 January 1871. The Hohenzollern dynasty of Prussia ruled the new empire, whose capital was Berlin. The empire was a unification of all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria (Kleindeutschland, or \"Lesser Germany\"). But internally the official political unification came rather sequentially: Germany had no national flag until 1892 and no national hymn until after WW I. Beginning in 1884, Germany began establishing several colonies outside of Europe.\n\nIn the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Emperor William I's foreign policy secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating France by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under William II, however, Germany, like other European powers, took an imperialistic course leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had been previously involved were not renewed, and new alliances excluded the country. Specifically, France established new relationships by signing the Entente Cordiale with the United Kingdom and securing ties with the Russian Empire. Aside from its contacts with Austria-Hungary, Germany became increasingly isolated.\n\nGermany's imperialism reached outside of its own country and joined many other powers in Europe in claiming their share of Africa. The Berlin Conference divided Africa between the European powers. Germany owned several pieces of land in Africa including German East Africa, South-West Africa, Togo, and Cameroon. The Scramble for Africa caused tension between the great powers that may have contributed to the conditions that led to World War I.\n\nThe assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 triggered World War I. Germany, as part of the unsuccessful Central Powers, suffered defeat against the Allied Powers in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time. An estimated two million German soldiers died in World War I. The German Revolution broke out in November 1918, and Emperor William II and all German ruling princes abdicated. An armistice putting an end to the war was signed on 11 November and Germany was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. Its negotiation, contrary to traditional post-war diplomacy, excluded the defeated Central Powers. The treaty was perceived in Germany as a humiliating continuation of the war by other means and its harshness is often cited as having facilitated the later rise of Nazism in the country.\n\nWeimar Republic (1919–1933)\n\nAt the beginning of the German Revolution, Germany was declared a republic and the monarchy collapsed. However, the struggle for power continued, with radical-left communists seizing power in Bavaria, but failing to take control of all of Germany. The revolution came to an end in August 1919, when the Weimar Republic was formally established. The Weimar Constitution came into effect with its signing by President Friedrich Ebert on 11 August 1919.\n\nSuffering from the Great Depression, the harsh peace conditions dictated by the Treaty of Versailles, and a long succession of more or less unstable governments, the people of Germany increasingly lacked identification with their political system and the \"Establishment Parties\" in their parliamentary democracy. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing (monarchist, völkisch, and Nazi) Dolchstoßlegende, which promoted the view that Germany had lost World War I because of the efforts and influence of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The top brass of the Weimar government was accused of betraying the German Nation by signing the Versailles Treaty, while the radical left-wing communists, such as the Spartacist League, had wanted a revolution to abolish \"capitalist rule\" in favour of a Räterepublik, and were also targeted.\n\nNevertheless, discontentment with the new Weimar government helped fuel the growth of the German Communist Party. Many conservatives were drawn towards the reactionary/revolutionary right, particularly the National Socialist German Workers Party—the Nazi Party. By 1932, these two parties controlled the majority of parliament (296 total parliamentary seats by July 1932). After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, President Paul von Hindenburg made a crucial decision: on 30 January 1933, seeing little alternative and pushed by right-wing advisors, von Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany, honoring Hitler's request.\n\nThird Reich (1933–1945)\n\nOn 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building went up in flames, and a consequent emergency decree abrogated basic citizen rights. An Enabling Act passed in parliament gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power. Only the Social Democratic Party voted against it, while Communist MPs had already been imprisoned. Using his powers to crush any actual or potential resistance, Hitler established a centralised totalitarian state within months. Industry was revitalised with a focus on military rearmament.[24] In 1935, Germany reacquired control of the Saar and in 1936 military control of the Rhineland, both of which had been lost by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nLeading to World War II and roughly in parallel with military rearmament, German foreign policy became more aggressive and expansionistic. In 1938 and 1939, Austria and Czechoslovakia were brought under control and the invasion of Poland prepared (Hitler-Stalin pact, Operation Himmler). On 1 September 1939, the German Wehrmacht launched a blitzkrieg on Poland, which was swiftly occupied by Germany and by the Soviet Red Army. The UK and France declared war on Germany marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. As the war progressed, Germany and its allies quickly gained control of much of continental Europe.\n\nOn 22 June 1941, Germany broke the Hitler-Stalin pact and invaded the Soviet Union. The same year, Japan attacked the American base at Pearl Harbor, and Germany declared war on the United States as a consequence of its alliance with Japan. Although the German army advanced into the Soviet Union quite rapidly, the Battle of Stalingrad marked a major turning point in the war. Subsequently, the German army started to retreat on the Eastern front. In September 1943, Germany's ally Italy surrendered, and German forces were forced to defend an additional front in Italy. D-Day marked another major turning point in the war, opening up a Western front; the Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy and made advances towards German territory. Germany's defeat soon followed. On 8 May 1945, the German armed forces surrendered after the Red Army occupied Berlin. Approximately seven million German soldiers and civilians—including ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe—died during World War II.\n\nIn what later became known as The Holocaust, the Third Reich regime enacted governmental policies directly subjugating many dissidents and minorities. About seventeen million people were murdered during the Holocaust, including six million Jews and sizable number of Gypsies, Poles and other Slavs, including Soviet POWs, the mentally ill, homosexuals, and members of the political opposition. World War II and the Nazi genocide were responsible for more than 40 million dead in Europe. The Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals were held after World War II.\n\nDivision and reunification (1945–1990)\n\nThe remaining national territory and Berlin were partitioned by the Allies into four military occupation zones.\n\nThe western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949, to form the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik, or DDR). They were, mainly outside Germany, informally known as \"West Germany\" and \"East Germany\" (in West Germany, East Germany referred to the areas east of the GDR, while the GDR was often referred to as Middle Germany), and the two parts of Berlin as \"West Berlin\" and \"East Berlin\". East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn. However, West Germany declared the status of its capital Bonn as provisional, in order to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial status quo that was to be overcome one day.\n\nWest Germany, established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\", was allied with the United States, the UK and France. The country came to enjoy prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s (Wirtschaftswunder). West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957. On 1 January 1957, Saarland gave in its adhesion to West Germany by virtue of article 23 Grundgesetz.\n\nEast Germany was an Eastern bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via the latter's occupation forces and the Warsaw Treaty. While claiming to be a democracy, political power was solely executed by leading members (Politburo) of the communist-controlled SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany). Their power was ensured by the Stasi, a secret service of immense size, and a variety of SED suborganizations controlling every aspect of society. In return, the basic needs of the population were satisfied at low cost by the state. A Soviet-style command economy was set up; later, the GDR became a Comecon state. While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programs and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.[30] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961 to stop East Germans from escaping to West Germany, became a symbol of the Cold War.\n\nTensions between East and West Germany were somewhat reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik, which included the de facto acceptance of Germany's territorial losses in World War II.\n\nIn the summer of 1989, Hungary decided (May 2) to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open the borders (August 23), causing an exodus of thousands of East Germans (September 11) going to West Germany via Hungary. The effects of the Hungarian events had devastating effects on the GDR, with mass demonstrations. The East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions in November, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West. Originally intended as a pressure valve to retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process in East Germany, which finally concluded with the Two Plus Four Treaty a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender, and Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states in the former GDR (New states or \"neue Länder\").\n\nGeography\n\nThe territory of Germany covers 357,021 km2 (137,847 sq mi), consisting of 349,223 km2 (134,836 sq mi) of land and 7,798 km2 (3,011 sq mi) of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the 63rd largest in the world. Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,962 metres / 9,718 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the north-west and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the north-east. Between lie the forested uplands of central Germany and the low-lying lands of northern Germany (lowest point: Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres / 11.6 feet below sea level), traversed by some of Europe's major rivers such as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe.\n\nGermany shares borders with more European countries than any other country on the continent. Its neighbours are Denmark in the north, Poland and the Czech Republic in the east, Austria and Switzerland in the south, France and Luxembourg in the south-west and Belgium and the Netherlands in the north-west.\n\nOther info\n\nOficial name:\n\nBundesrepublik Deutschland\n\nFormation: 843\n\n- Eastern Francia 843\n\n- Holy Roman Empire 962\n\n- German Confederation 8 June 1815\n\n- German Empire 18 January 1871\n\n- Federal Republic 23 May 1949\n\n- Reunification 3 October 1990\n\nArea:\n\n357.021 km2\n\nInhabitants:\n\n84.000.000\n\nLanguage:\n\nAlemannisch [gsw] Southwestern, southern Baden-Wuerttemberg.

In the Latin the Germans were also known as Teutones.\n\nVācija (Latvian), Vokietija (Lithuanian):\n\nDescription Flag:\n\nThe colours of black, red and gold have played an important role in the history of Germany and have had various meanings over time (see History section below). Today the colours are associated with the republican-democracy formed after World War II and represent German unity and freedom: not only the freedom of Germany, but also the personal freedom of the German people.\n\nCoat of arms:\n\nThe coat of arms of Germany is a symbol of Germany; the coat of arms feature an eagle. The colors of the coat of arms are similar to those of the flag of Germany (black, red and gold). It is the one of the oldest extant state symbols of Europe and is one of the oldest insignia in the world. Moreover, its history as an emblem began even earlier. To the Germanic tribes, the eagle was the bird of the god Odin[citation needed]. The Romans reserved aquiline imagery for only the most revered beings; namely, the supreme god and the emperor; and it served as a metaphor of invincibility. Later, through its rei rock eagle (adler), referred to in German as the Reichsadler, on German soil probably date back to the time of Charlemagne (742-814). Around the year 1200 the black eagle icon on a gold field was generally recognised as the imperial coat of arms. In 1433 the double-headed eagle was adopted for the first time by the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. Since then the double-headed eagle came to be used as the symbol of the Roman-German emperor, and hence as the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. From the middle of the 15th century onwards, the respective emperors put the emblem of their dynasty on the eagle's chest. After the end of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in 1806, a German state and a unified state emblem ceased to exist. In 1815, a German Confederation (Bund) of 39 loosely-united German states was founded on the territory of the former German empire. Until 1848, the confederation did not have a coat of arms of its own. The Federal Diet (Bundestag) meeting at Frankfurt am Main used a seal which carried the emblem of the Austrian Empire, since Austria had taken over the union's leadership. It showed a black, double-headed eagle, which Austria had adopted just before the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.\n\nDuring the 1848 revolution, a new Reich coat of arms was adopted by the German National Assembly that convened in St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt. The black double-headed eagle was retained, but without the four symbols of the emperor: the sword, the imperial orb, the sceptre and the crown. The eagle rested on a golden shield; above was a five-pointed golden star. On both sides the shield was flanked by two flags with the colours black-red-gold. The emblem, however, never gained general acceptance.\n\nIn 1867, the North German Confederation was established without Austria and the southern German states, and under the leadership of the Kingdom of Prussia (see coat of arms of Prussia). A new coat of arms was adopted, which consisted of a shield with the colours black-white-red, flanked by two wild men holding cudgels and standing on a pedestal.\n\nThe eagle was retained during the German Empire (1871-1918) and the Weimar Republic (1918-1933), albeit with variations in symbolic meaning and design.\n\nWhen Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, the Weimar eagle was retained until 1935, when it was replaced by the emblem of the Nazi Party. It showed a black eagle above a highly stylised oak wreath, with a swastika at its centre.\n\nAfter the defeat of Germany in World War II, the German Reich continued to exist under Allied occupation until the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949. In 1950, the Federal Republic incorporated the Weimar eagle, which thenceforward was called the \"federal eagle\", into its coat of arms. The design by Tobias Schwab dates from 1926. Since the accession of the German Democratic Republic in 1990, the Federal Eagle has been the state symbol of the reunified Germany.\n\nMotto:\n\n\"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\"\n\n\"Unity and justice and freedom\"\n\nNational Anthem: Das Deutschlandlied\n\n1\n\nEinigkeit und Recht und Freiheit,\n\nÜber alles in der Welt,\n\nwenn es stets zu Schutz und Trutze\n\nbrüderlich zusammenhält.\n\nvon der Maas bis an die Memel,\n\nvon der Etsch bis an den Belt,\n\n|: Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit,\n\nÜber alles in der Welt! :|\n\n2\n\nDeutsche Frauen, deutsche Treue,\n\ndeutscher Wein und deutscher Sang\n\nsollen in der Welt behalten\n\nihren alten schönen Klang,\n\nuns zu edler Tat begeistern\n\nunser ganzes Leben lang.\n\n|: Deutsche Frauen, deutsche Treue,\n\nDeutscher Wein und deutscher Sang! :|\n\n3\n\nEinigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\n\nfür das deutsche Vaterland!\n\nDanach laßt uns alle streben\n\nbrüderlich mit Herz und Hand!\n\nEinigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\n\nsind des Glückes Unterpfand;\n\n|: Blüh im Glanze dieses Glückes,\n\nblühe, deutsches Vaterland. :|\n\nEnglish\n\n1\n\nGermany, Germany above all,\n\nabove all in the world,\n\nWhen it always, for protection and defence,\n\nBrotherly stands together.\n\nFrom the Meuse to the Neman,\n\nFrom the Adige to the Belt,\n\n|: Germany, Germany above all,\n\nAbove anything in the world. :|\n\n2\n\nGerman women, German loyalty,\n\nGerman wine and German song\n\nShall retain in the world\n\nTheir old beautiful ring\n\nAnd inspire us to noble deeds\n\nDuring all of our life.\n\n|: German women, German loyalty,\n\nGerman wine and German song! :|\n\n3\n\nThe National anthem Song\n\nUnity and justice and freedom\n\nFor the German fatherland;\n\nFor these let us all strive,\n\nBrotherly with heart and hand.\n\nUnity and justice and freedom\n\nAre the pledge of happiness.\n\n|: flourish in this fortune's blessing,\n\nflourish, German fatherland. :|\n\nInternet Page: www.deutschland.de\n\nwww.germany-tourism.de\n\nwww.germany.info\n\nwww.germanplaces.com\n\nwww.cometogermany.com\n\nGermany in diferent languages\n\neng: Germany\n\nina | ita | lat | lld | roh-enb | roh-eno | roh-gri | ron: Germania\n\nast | glg | grn | tet: Alemaña\n\ndan | nor | swe: Tyskland\n\neus | pap | spa: Alemania\n\nnso | sot | tsn: Jeremane\n\nafr | nld: Duitsland\n\nfij | ibo: Jamani\n\ngag | kaa: Germaniya / Германия\n\nind | msa: Jerman / جرمن\n\nkin | run: Ubudagi\n\nnbl | tso: Jarimani\n\noci | por: Alemanha\n\nsmo | tvl: Siamani\n\ntur | zza: Almanya\n\narg: Alemaña;

Sweden has land borders with Norway to the west and Finland to the northeast, and it is connected to Denmark by the Öresund Bridge in the south.\n\nAt 450,295 km², Sweden is the third largest country in the European Union in terms of area, with a total population of about 9.2 million. Sweden has a low population density of 21 inhabitants per square kilometre (54 /sq mi) but a considerably higher density in the southern half of the country. About 85% of the population live in urban areas, and it is expected that these numbers will gradually rise as a part of the ongoing urbanization. Sweden's capital is Stockholm, which is also the largest city in the country (population of 1.3 million in the urban area and with 2 million in the metropolitan area).\n\nSweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the Middle Ages. In the 17th century the country expanded its territories to form the Swedish Empire. Most of the conquered territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost during the 18th and 19th centuries. The eastern half of Sweden, present-day Finland, was lost to Russia in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a personal union which lasted until 1905. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, adopting a non-aligned foreign policy in peacetime and neutrality in wartime.\n\nToday, Sweden is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government and a highly developed economy. It ranks first in the world in The Economist's Democracy Index and seventh in the United Nations' Human Development Index. Sweden has been a member of the European Union since 1 January 1995 and is a member of the OECD.\n\nHistory\n\nPlease go to\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Sweden\n\nGeography\n\nPlease go to\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Sweden\n\nOther info\n\nOficial name:\n\nKonungariket Sverige\n\n+ fin: Ruotsin kuningaskunta\n\nrmy: Ťagaripen Svedo / थागारिपेन स्वेदो\n\nsma: Sveerjen gånkarijhke\n\nsme: Ruoŧa gonagasriika\n\nsmj: Svieriga gånågisrijkka\n\nyid: קיניגרײַך שװעדן (Kinigrayḫ Švedn)\n\nUnification:\n\nBetween 900 and 1200\n\nArea:\n\n449.964 km2\n\nInhabitants:\n\n9.900.000\n\nLanguages:\n\nDalecarlian [dlc] 1,500 (1996 Oesten Dahl).

Not intelligible with Finnish Sign Language. Classification: Deaf sign language\n\nCapital city:\n\nStockholm\n\nMeaning country name:\n\nAn old English plural form of Swede. The exact development of the ethnonym remains uncertain, but it certainly derives from the Old English Sweoðeod, in Old Norse: Sviþjoð. The etymology of the first element, Svi, links to the PIE *suos (one's own, of one's own kin). The last element, þjoð, means \"people\", cognate with deut in Deutsch and teut in Teutons.\n\nSverige (native name): derives from the phrase Svia Rike, meaning \"the realm of the Swedes\" (possibly through Danish, even though a similar linguistic evolution happened within Swedish: mik->mig).\n\nAn tSualainn (Irish name): means (literally) Swedeland and is formed from an ethnonym Sua, evidently derived from Svia (see above) and -lann, a common suffix denoting abstract nouns in Irish. The inclusion of an, the singular definite article, as well as the elipsis t is necessary for grammatical purposes.\n\nRuotsi (Finnish), Rootsi (Estonian), Rūotšmō (Livonian), Ruoŧŧa (Sami): probably from a Varangian people called the Rus', originating from Roslagen in Svealand. Scholars debate the meaning of rus, but it probably originates from the element roþs- (\"relating to rowing\") which has the same origin as row.\n\nDescription Flag:\n\nThe flag of Sweden (Swedish: Sveriges flagga) is blue with a yellow Scandinavian cross that extends to the edges of the flag. The design and colors of the Swedish flag are believed to have been inspired by the present Coat of arms of Sweden of 1442, which is blue divided quarterly by a cross pattée of gold, and modeled on the Danish flag. Blue and yellow have been used as Swedish colors at least since king Magnus Birgersson's royal coat of arms of 1275.\n\nAccording to the mythology, the Swedish 12th century king Eric the Holy saw a yellow cross in the sky as he landed in Finland during the First Swedish Crusade in 1157. Seeing this as a sign from God he adopted the yellow cross against a blue background as his banner.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the Swedish flag might have been a resistance flag against the Danish flag, which is red with a white cross, and which has been known since 1219. According to this theory, the Swedish flag was created during the reign of King Charles Knutsson, who also introduced the Coat of arms of Sweden in 1442. The national coat of arms is a combination of King Albert of Mecklenburg's coat of arms of 1364 and King Magnus Birgersson's coat of arms of 1275, and is blue divided quarterly by a golden cross pattée.\n\nOther historians claim that the Swedish flag was blue with a white cross before 1420, and became blue with a golden cross only during the early reign of King Gustaf Vasa, who successfully liberated Sweden from the temporary tyranny of the Danish King Christian II in 1521\n\nCoat of arms:\n\nThe greater national coat of arms (stora riksvapnet) and the lesser national coat of arms (lilla riksvapnet) are the official coats of arms of Sweden.\n\nThe shield has four elements: The first and fourth fields, top left and bottom right, show the three Royal Crowns of Sweden. They have been a national symbol since the time of King Albert of Mecklenburg. The second and third field, top right and bottom left, are the traditional Lions of the Folkunga Dynasty.\n\nThe escutcheon is supported by two lions with forked tails (queue fourchée), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. The lion has for centuries been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms.\n\nMotto:\n\n\"För Sverige - I tiden\"\n\nNational Anthem: Du gamla, du fria\n\nOriginal verses by Richard Dybeck:\n\n1\n\nDu gamla, Du fria, Du fjällhöga nord\n\nDu tysta, Du glädjerika sköna!\n\nJag hälsar Dig, vänaste land uppå jord,\n\n/: Din sol, Din himmel, Dina ängder gröna.:/\n\n2\n\nDu tronar på minnen från fornstora dar,\n\ndå ärat Ditt namn flög över jorden.\n\nJag vet att Du är och Du bliver vad du var.\n\n/: Ja, jag vill leva jag vill dö i Norden.:/\n\nLouise Ahlén's addition from 1910 (usually not seen as part of the national anthem, and not sung)\n\n3\n\nJag städs vill dig tjäna mitt älskade land,\n\ndin trohet till döden vill jag svära.\n\nDin rätt, skall jag värna, med håg och med hand,\n\n/:din fana, högt den bragderika bära.:/\n\n4\n\nMed Gud skall jag kämpa, för hem och för härd,\n\nför Sverige, den kära fosterjorden.\n\nJag byter Dig ej, mot allt i en värld\n\n/: Nej, jag vill leva jag vill dö i Norden.:/\n\nLiteral translation\n\nOriginal verses by Richard Dybeck:\n\n1\n\nThou ancient, thou free, thou mountainous North\n\nThou quiet, thou joyful beauty!\n\nI greet Thee, most beautiful land upon earth,\n\n/:Thy sun, Thy sky, Thine meadows green.:/\n\n2\n\nThou throne upon memories of great olden days,\n\nWhen honoured thy name flew over the world,\n\nI know that thou art and wilt be as thou wert,\n\n/: Yes, I want to live I want to die in the Nordic :/\n\nLouise Ahlén's addition from 1910 (usually not seen as part of the national anthem, and not sung)\n\n3\n\nI forever will serve my beloved country,\n\nyour faith until death will I swear,\n\nYour right will I protect with mind and with hand,\n\n/:your banner, great the feats it carries.:/\n\n4\n\nWith God shall I struggle (fight), for home and for hearth,\n\nfor Sweden, the dear motherland.\n\nI trade You not, for anything in the world\n\n/: No, I want to live I want to die in the Nordic.:/\n\nRoyal Anthem: Kungssången\n\n1.

Almost all of the Danube Delta is located within its territory. Romania shares a border with Hungary and Serbia to the west, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova to the northeast, and Bulgaria to the south.\n\nRomania emerged as a personal union of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia under prince Alexander John Cuza in 1859 and as the Kingdom of Romania under the Hohenzollern monarchy, it gained recognition of independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. In 1918, at the end of the World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the Kingdom of Romania. At the end of World War II, parts of its territories (roughly the present day Republic of Moldova) were occupied by the USSR and Romania became a socialist republic, member of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nWith the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, Romania started a series of political and economic reforms. After a decade of post-revolution economic problems, Romania made economic reforms such as low flat tax rates in 2005 and joined the European Union on January 1, 2007. While Romania's income level remains one of the lowest in the European Union, reforms have increased the growth speed. Romania is now an upper-middle income country economy with high human development.\n\nRomania has the 9th largest territory and the 7th largest population (with 21.5 million people) among the European Union member states. Its capital and largest city is Bucharest (Roma"
