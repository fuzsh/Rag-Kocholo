The relative humidity is calculated to The wind is blowing at a speed of from the direction: . The wind gusts reach a maximum speed of .\n\nThe METAR weather station data reports an observation of the following weather events: NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER EVENTS OBSERVED.\n\nThe following information was reported on cloudiness: NO DATA RECEIVED.\n\nAirport weather forecast TAF\n\nAerodrome forecasts for international airports and regional aerodromes are issued in the TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) code format. For flight preparation, TAFs serve as the internationally standardised aeronautical meteorological forecast needed to decide on the meteorological usability of an aerodrome as destination or alternate aerodrome during a certain time period. TAFs are quality-controlled, monitored forecasts that are created based on con- tinuous weather observation. They are only produced if a sufficient number of observation data of satisfying quality is available.\n\nVISIBILITY\n\nVisibility is a measure of the horizontal opacity of the atmosphere at the point of observation and is expressed in terms of the horizontal distance at which a person should be able to see and identify: in the daytime, a prominent dark object against the sky at the horizon; at night, a known, preferably unfocused, moderately intense light source.\n\nSurface Visibility is the greatest visibility, taken at the surface, equaled or exceeded throughout at least half the horizon circle.\n\nWind direction\n\nThe true direction from which the wind is blowing at a given location (i.e., wind blowing from the north to the south is a north wind). It is normally measured in tens of degrees from 10 degrees clockwise through 360 degrees. North is 360 degrees. A wind direction of 0 degrees is only used when wind is calm.\n\nWind roses typically use 16 cardinal directions, such as north (N), NNE, NE, etc., although they may be subdivided into as many as 32 directions. In terms of angle measurement in degrees, North corresponds to 0°/360°, East to 90°, South to 180° and West to 270°.\n\nDIRECTIONDEGREES NNorth 0 ° NNENorth-Northeast 22,5 ° NENortheast 45 ° ENEEast-Northeast 67,5 ° EEast 90 ° ESEEast Southeast 112,5 ° SESoutheast 135 ° SSESouth Southeast 157,5 ° SSouth 180 ° SSWSouth Southwest 202,5 ° SWSouthwest 225 ° WSWWest Southwest 247,5 ° WWest 270 ° WNWWest Northwest 292,5 ° NWNorthwest 315 ° NNWNorth Northwest 337,5 ° NNorth 360 = 0 °\n\nCloud cover\n\nThe unit of measure for cloud cover is the Okta. Cloud cover is measured on an eight point scale, 0 Oktas being clear sky , one Octa being 1/8 of the sky covered in cloud, and so on up to 8 Oktas - completely overcast.\n\nICONNAMECOVER FEW (few)1/8 - 2/8 SCT (scattered)3/8 - 4/8 BKN (broken)5/8 - 7/8 OVC (overcast)8/8\n\nCAVOK: CAVOK is an abbreviation for Ceiling And Visibility OK\n\nConditions:\n\nPrevailing visibility of at least 10 km and no minimum visibility\n\nNo clouds observed or detected below 5000 ft or below the highest minimum sector height\n\nNo CB/TCU\n\nNo weather phenomenon\n\nMETAR & TAF Definitions of meteorological terms: Aviation Weather Center (NOAA) & DWD"
