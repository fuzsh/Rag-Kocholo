        "text": "Structural analysis of the Lower Allochthon in the north-central Scandinavian Caledonides has allowed the construction of restorable cross-sections consistent with the development of a foreland-propagating linked thrust system. The internal geometry of an antiformal stack, the Njakafjäll duplex, within the Lower Allochthon demonstrates tectonic shortening of c. 50% and suggests an overall predeformational width for the Lower Allochthon in this area of at least c. 130 km, and possibly considerably greater if the buried trailing edge of the Lower Allochthon lies in a comparable position to that farther south in Tröndelag. These results, combined with a stratigraphic analysis of the imbricates within the Lower Allochthon and of the adjoining Autochthon and Middle Allochthon, indicate the development, from Proterozoic through Cambrian times, of two sedimentary basins on the c. 200 km wide continental margin of Baltica bordering the Iapetus Ocean. The basins were separated by a region of...\n\nT he condensed tectonostratigraphic section from the Central Norway basement window, across the Devonian Kollstraumen detachment zone, and in to the Helgeland Nappe Complex provides an excellent opportunity to assess the timing and kinematics of polyphase Caledonian deformation in central Norway. T he Helgeland Nappe Complex, at present preserved in the hanging-wall of the Kollstraumen detachment zone (in the southwest) and the Nesna shear zone (north and east), provides evidence of Ordovician, Taconic deformation succeeded by emplacement of voluminous calc­ alkaline plutons. These events pre-date the eastward thrusting of the Helgeland Nappe Complex across subjacent rock units during Scandian con­ tractional deformation. Structurally below the Kollstraumen detachment zone, Palaeoproterozoic orthogneisses and overlying supracrustal rocks of the Skjøtingen Nappe form the northern Central Norway Basement Window. During the Scandian event, these rocks were metamorphosed at medium to hi..."
