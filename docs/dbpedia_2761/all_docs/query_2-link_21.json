        "text": "Maxillary and mandibular anterior crown width/height ratio and its relation to various arch perimeters, arch length, and arch width groups\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShahid, Fazal; Alam, Mohammad Khursheed; Khamis, Mohd Fadhli\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective: To investigate the maxillary and mandibular anterior crown width/height ratio and its relation to various arch perimeters, arch length, and arch width (intercanine, interpremolar, and intermolar) groups. Materials and Methods: The calculated sample size was 128 subjects. The crown width/height, arch length, arch perimeter, and arch width of the maxilla and mandible were obtained via digital calliper (Mitutoyo, Japan). A total of 4325 variables were measured. The sex differences in the crown width and height were evaluated. Analysis of variance was applied to evaluate the differences between arch length, arch perimeter, and arch width groups. Results: Males had significantly larger mean values for crown width and height than females (P â¤ 0.05) for maxillary and mandibular arches, both. There were no significant differences observed for the crown width/height ratio in various arch length, arch perimeter, and arch width (intercanine, interpremolar, and intermolar) groups (P â¤ 0.05) in maxilla and mandible, both. Conclusions: Our results indicate sexual disparities in the crown width and height. Crown width and height has no significant relation to various arch length, arch perimeter, and arch width groups of maxilla and mandible. Thus, it may be helpful for orthodontic and prosthodontic case investigations and comprehensive management.

For example, shape and size can dictate how the organism ranges for food and escapes predation. Due to lack of data and analysis, the evolution of shell size in marine gastropods (snails) remains poorly known. In this study, I attempt to find the relationship between height to width ratio and mean volume. I collected height and width measurements from primary literature sources and calculated volume from these measurements. My results indicate that there was no correlation between height to width ratio and mean volume between 500 to 200 Ma, but there was a correlation between 200 Ma to present where there is a steady increase in both height to width ratio and mean volume. This means that shell shape was not an important factor at the beginning of gastropod evolution but after 200 Ma body size evolution was increasingly driven by the height to width ratio.\n\nThe golden ratio of nasal width to nasal bone length.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoynumer, G; Yayla, M; Durukan, B; Wetherilt, L\n\n2011-01-01\n\nTo calculate the ratio of fetal nasal width over nasal bone length at 14-39 weeks' gestation in Caucasian women. Fetal nasal bone length and nasal width at 14-39 weeks' gestation were measured in 532 normal fetuses. The mean and standard deviations of fetal nasal bone length, nasal width and their ratio to one another were calculated in normal fetuses according to the gestational age to establish normal values. A positive and linear correlation was detected between the nasal bone length and the gestational week, as between the nasal width and the gestational week. No linear growth pattern was found between the gestational week and the ratio of nasal width to nasal bone length, nearly equal to phi, throughout gestation. The ratio of nasal width to nasal bone length, approximately equal to phi, can be calculated at 14-38 weeks' gestation. This might be useful in evaluating fetal abnormalities.\n\n23 CFR 658.16 - Exclusions from length and width determinations.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-04-01\n\n...

In this study 3D cephalometric landmarks were identified and measurements from 43 randomly selected cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of dry skulls from the Weisbach collection of Vienna Natural History Museum were analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficients of facial height measurements and mandibular plane angle and the correlation coefficients of height-width and height-depth were calculated, respectively. The mandibular plane angle (MP-SN) significantly correlated with ramus height (Co-Go) and posterior facial height (PFH) but not with anterior lower face height (ALFH) or anterior total face height (ATFH). The ALFH and ATFH showed significant correlation with anterior cranial base length (S-N), whereas PFH showed significant correlation with the mandible (S-B) and maxilla (S-A) anteroposterior position. High or low mandibular plane angle might not necessarily be accompanied by long or short anterior face height, respectively. The PFH rather than AFH is assumed to play a key role in the vertical facial type whereas AFH seems to undergo relatively intrinsic growth.\n\nComparison of Standardized Clinical Evaluation of Wounds Using Ruler Length by Width and Scout Length by Width Measure and Scout Perimeter Trace\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLangemo, Diane; Spahn, James; Spahn, Thomas; Pinnamaneni, V. Chowdry\n\n2015-01-01\n\nABSTRACT The study objective was to examine precision in wound measurement using a recently Food and Drug Administration-approved Scout (WoundVision, LLC, Indianapolis, Indiana) device to measure wound length (L) and width (W). Wound perimeter and a ruler measurement of L and W were also made. Images of 40 actual patient wounds were measured using the Scout device. All 3 techniques (length, width, perimeter) demonstrated acceptable within and between reader precision; however, the best precision was in wound perimeter measurement.

Sixty-six adult (35 right and 31 left) dry femurs from Caucasians were used in this study. Computed tomography (CT) imaging was applied to obtain measurement values of the femur. Femur height (413.29Â Â±Â 28.40Â mm) and width (29.86Â Â±Â 2.72Â mm) were all checked one by one to determine the correlation with the parameters obtained. Both values exposed high rates of correlation with height (26Â Â±Â 2.34Â mm) and width (20.85Â Â±Â 2.76Â mm) of femur notch; also, measures of epicondylar, bicondylar and condylar diameters of femur were obtained. Measures were checked if there was a correlation with femur height and width. Differences displayed in distal morphometry of femur according to race and sex are due to other morphometric measures of femur rather than race and sex. We believe that displaying the high rates of correlation of distal morphometry of femur with femur height and width will be the factor which determines the selection and production of prosthesis among the long or short individuals of folks.\n\nEffect of extending grating length and width on human visually evoked potentials.\n\nPubMed\n\nMihaylova, Milena S; Hristov, Ivan; Racheva, Kalina; Totev, Tsvetalin; Mitov, Dimitar\n\n2015-01-01\n\nVisually evoked potentials (VEPs) were elicited by Gabor gratings with different lengths and widths at three spatial frequencies (SFs): low, 1.45 c/deg, medium, 2.9 c/deg and high, 5.8 c/deg and at a contrast 3 times above the detection threshold at each SF. An increase of grating length enhanced N1 amplitude at occipital and parietal positions stronger than the increase of grating width at aspect ratios (length : width) above 4:1. The stronger effect of stimulus length than width was reflected also in the amplitude of the later P1 component at central and parietal positions. The larger effect of stimulus length than width on the VEP amplitude was SF specific: it was stronger at 5.8 c/deg, smaller at 2.9 c/deg and vanished at 1.45 c/deg. The results obtained suggest anisotropy in the physiological mechanisms that underlie grating perception and involve bottom- up processes initiated in the occipital cortex.\n\nModeling wildland fire containment with uncertain flame length and fireline width\n\nTreesearch\n\nRomain Mees; David Strauss; Richard Chase\n\n1993-01-01\n\nWe describe a mathematical model for the probability that a fireline succeeds in containing a fire. The probability increases as the fireline width increases, and also as the fire's flame length decreases. More interestingly, uncertainties in width and flame length affect the computed containment probabilities, and can thus indirectly affect the optimum allocation...\n\nIn Situ Height and Width Estimation of Sorghum Plants from 2.5d Infrared Images\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBaharav, Tavor; Bariya, Mohini; Zakhor, Avideh\n\nPlant phenotyping, or the measurement of plant traits such as stem width and plant height, is a critical step in the development and evaluation of higher yield biofuel crops. Phenotyping allows biologists to quantitatively estimate the biomass of plant varieties and therefore their potential for biofuel production. Manual phenotyping is costly, time-consuming, and errorprone, requiring a person to walk through the fields measuring individual plants with a tape measure and notebook. In this work we describe an alternative system consisting of an autonomous robot equipped with two infrared cameras that travels through fields, collecting 2.5D image data of sorghum plants.moreÂ Â» We develop novel image processing based algorithms to estimate plant height and stem width from the image data. Our proposed method has the advantage of working in situ using images of plants from only one side. This allows phenotypic data to be collected nondestructively throughout the growing cycle, providing biologists with valuable information on crop growth patterns. Our approach first estimates plant heights and stem widths from individual frames. It then uses tracking algorithms to refine these estimates across frames and avoid double counting the same plant in multiple frames. The result is a histogram of stem widths and plant heights for each plot of a particular genetically engineered sorghum variety. In-field testing and comparison with human collected ground truth data demonstrates that our system achieves 13% average absolute error for stem width estimation and 15% average absolute error for plant height estimation.Â«Â less\n\nIn Situ Height and Width Estimation of Sorghum Plants from 2.5d Infrared Images\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBaharav, Tavor; Bariya, Mohini; Zakhor, Avideh\n\n2017-01-29\n\nPlant phenotyping, or the measurement of plant traits such as stem width and plant height, is a critical step in the development and evaluation of higher yield biofuel crops.

Here, we report a major quantitative trait locus qSS7 on the long arm of chromosome 7 for seed length, seed width and the ratio of seed length to width, identified using a segregating population derived from a cross between an indica variety Zhenshan97 and a chromosomal segment substitution line of a japonica variety Cypress within the genetic background of Zhenshan97. The Cypress allele at qSS7 contributes to an increase in seed length and the ratio of length to width, but a decrease in seed width, without significantly changing seed weight, plant height, heading date or number of spikelets per panicle. Using a large F(2) population generated from a substitution line that carries only a heterozygous single segment surrounding qSS7, we delimited the QTL to a 23-kb region containing two annotated genes. Progeny testing of the informative recombinants suggested that this qSS7 region is a composite QTL in which at least two genes contribute to seed length and width. Sequence comparison and expression analysis of two probable candidate genes revealed differences between the parental lines. These results will facilitate cloning of the gene(s) underlying qSS7 as well as marker-assisted transfer of desirable genes for seed shape in rice improvement.\n\nModelling foot height and foot shape-related dimensions.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiong, Shuping; Goonetilleke, Ravindra S; Witana, Channa P; Lee Au, Emily Yim\n\n2008-08-01\n\nThe application of foot anthropometry to design good-fitting footwear has been difficult due to the lack of generalised models. This study seeks to model foot dimensions so that the characteristic shapes of feet, especially in the midfoot region, can be understood. Fifty Hong Kong Chinese adults (26 males and 24 females) participated in this study. Their foot lengths, foot widths, ball girths and foot heights were measured and then evaluated using mathematical models. The results showed that there were no significant allometry (p > 0.05) effects of foot length on ball girth and foot width. Foot height showed no direct relationship with foot length. However, a normalisation with respect to foot length and foot height resulted in a significant relationship for both males and females with R(2) greater than 0.97. Due to the lack of a direct relationship between foot height and foot length, the current practice of grading shoes with a constant increase in height or proportionate scaling in response to foot length is less than ideal. The results when validated with other populations can be a significant way forward in the design of footwear that has an improved fit in the height dimension.\n\nInfluence of crank length and crank width on maximal hand cycling power and cadence.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrÃ¤mer, Christian; Hilker, Lutz; BÃ¶hm, Harald\n\n2009-07-01\n\nThe effect of different crank lengths and crank widths on maximal hand cycling power, cadence and handle speed were determined. Crank lengths and crank widths were adapted to anthropometric data of the participants as the ratio to forward reach (FR) and shoulder breadth (SB), respectively. 25 able-bodied subjects performed maximal inertial load hand cycle ergometry using crank lengths of 19, 22.5 and 26% of FR and 72, 85 and 98% of SB. Maximum power ranged from 754 (246) W for the crank geometry short wide (crank length x crank width) to 873 (293) W for the combination long middle. Every crank length differed significantly (P < 0.05) from each other, whereas no significant effect of crank width to maximum power output was revealed. Optimal cadence decreased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing crank length from 124.8 (0.9) rpm for the short to 107.5 (1.6) rpm for the long cranks, whereas optimal handle speed increased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing crank length from 1.81 (0.01) m/s for the short to 2.13 (0.03) m/s for the long cranks. Crank width did neither influence optimal cadence nor optimal handle speed significantly. From the results of this study, for maximum hand cycling power, a crank length to FR ratio of 26% for a crank width to SB ratio of 85% is recommended.\n\nChronobiological Hypothesis about the Association Between Height Growth Seasonality and Geographical Differences in Body Height According to Effective Day Length\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHiguchi, Yukito\n\n2016-01-01\n\nStudies on growth hormone therapy in children have shown that height velocity is greater in summer than in winter and that this difference increases with latitude. It is hypothesized that summer daylight is a causative factor and that geographical distribution of body height will approximate the distribution of summer day length over time. This is an ecological analysis of prefecture-level data on the height of Japanese youth. Mesh climatic data of effective day length were collated. While height velocity was greatest during the summer, the height of Japanese youth was strongly and negatively correlated with the distribution of winter effective day length. Therefore, it is anticipated that summer height velocity is greater according to winter day length (dark period). This may be due to epigenetic modifications, involving reversible DNA methylation and thyroid hormone regulation found in the reproductive system of seasonal breeding vertebrates. If the function is applicable to humans, summer height growth may quantitatively increase with winter day length, and height growth seasonality can be explained by thyroid hormone activities that-induced by DNA methylation-change depending on the seasonal difference in day length. Moreover, geographical differences in body height may be caused by geographical differences in effective day length, which could influence melatonin secretion among subjects who spend a significant time indoors.\n\nAn experimental investigation on the requirement of roof height and sill width for car ingress and egress.\n\nPubMed\n\nCausse, Julien; Wang, Xuguang; Denninger, Lisa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study aimed at experimentally investigating the influence of roof height and sill width on car ingress/egress movements. The first uncomfortable (Ht1) and the lowest acceptable (Ht2) roof heights were obtained from 26 participants of three different stature groups thanks to a multi-adjustable vehicle mock-up. Both Ht1 and Ht2 were affected neither by stature nor by vehicle type. Only a difference of 45 mm between Ht1 and Ht2 was observed. Tall volunteers more flexed the trunk and neck than short persons thanks to a larger space available around the seat when the head passing under the roof. The vehicle type had almost no effect on upper body posture. The roof height only affected neck flexion. The sill width mainly imposed a lateral translation. Results demonstrated that an appropriate roof height should be determined carefully. A small change of 45 mm in roof height may lead to an unacceptable situation. The present study experimentally investigated the effects of roof height and sill width on car ingress and egress movements. Short females required almost the same roof height as tall males due to smaller space around the seat. The results would help to optimise car dimensions for improving car accessibility.\n\nBest Stent Length Predicted by Simple CT Measurement Rather than Patient Height.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarrett, Keith; Foell, Kirsten; Lantz, Andrea; Ordon, Michael; Lee, Jason Y; Pace, Kenneth T; Honey, R John D'A\n\n2016-09-01\n\nUreteral stent length is important, as stents that are too long might worsen symptoms and too short are at higher risk of migration. The purpose of this study was to determine if patient or radiologic parameters correlate with directly measured ureteral length and if directly measured ureteral length predicts proper stent positioning. During stent placement, ureteral length (ureteropelvic junction to ureterovesical junction distance) was directly measured by endoscopically viewing a ureteral catheter (with 1-cm marking) emanating from the ureteral orifice. A 22, 24, or 26âcm stent was chosen to be closest to the measured ureteral length. For ureters >26âcm, a 26âcm stent was chosen. Ends of an \"ideally positioned\" stent were fully curled in the renal pelvis and bladder, without crossing the bladder midline. Rates of ideal stent position were compared between patients with matching stent and ureteral lengths and those with stent lengths differing by â¥1âcm (mismatched). The measured ureteral length was correlated with patient height, L1-L5 height, and length measured on CT. Fifty-nine ureters from 57 patients were included. Height was reasonably correlated with L1-L5 height (Spearman correlation coefficient [rho]â=â0.79), although both were poorly correlated with directly measured ureteral length (rhoâ=â0.18 for height and 0.32 for lumbar height). Ureteral lengths measured on CT correlated well with direct measurement (rhoâ=â0.63 for axial cuts and rhoâ=â0.64 for coronal cuts). Matched stent length was associated with higher rates of ideal stent position than mismatched (100% vs 70.9%, pâ=â0.006). CT measurements, rather than height, correlate well with measured length and could be used to choose the appropriate stent length. Stents matching directly measured ureteral lengths are associated with high rates of ideal stent position.\n\nPulse width and height modulation for multi-level resistance in bi-layer TaOx based RRAM\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlamgir, Zahiruddin; Beckmann, Karsten; Holt, Joshua; Cady, Nathaniel C.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nMutli-level switching in resistive memory devices enables a wide range of computational paradigms, including neuromorphic and cognitive computing. To this end, we have developed a bi-layer tantalum oxide based resistive random access memory device using Hf as the oxygen exchange layer. Multiple, discrete resistance levels were achieved by modulating the RESET pulse width and height, ranging from 2 kÎ© to several MÎ©. For a fixed pulse height, OFF state resistance was found to increase gradually with the increase in the pulse width, whereas for a fixed pulse width, the increase in the pulse height resulted in drastic changes in resistance. Resistive switching in these devices transitioned from Schottky emission in the OFF state to tunneling based conduction in the ON state, based on I-V curve fitting and temperature dependent current measurements. These devices also demonstrated endurance of more than 108 cycles with a satisfactory Roff/Ron ratio and retention greater than 104 s.\n\nNano-scaled graphene platelets with a high length-to-width aspect ratio\n\nDOEpatents\n\nZhamu, Aruna; Guo, Jiusheng; Jang, Bor Z.\n\n2010-09-07\n\nThis invention provides a nano-scaled graphene platelet (NGP) having a thickness no greater than 100 nm and a length-to-width ratio no less than 3 (preferably greater than 10). The NGP with a high length-to-width ratio can be prepared by using a method comprising (a) intercalating a carbon fiber or graphite fiber with an intercalate to form an intercalated fiber; (b) exfoliating the intercalated fiber to obtain an exfoliated fiber comprising graphene sheets or flakes; and (c) separating the graphene sheets or flakes to obtain nano-scaled graphene platelets. The invention also provides a nanocomposite material comprising an NGP with a high length-to-width ratio. Such a nanocomposite can become electrically conductive with a small weight fraction of NGPs. Conductive composites are particularly useful for shielding of sensitive electronic equipment against electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI), and for electrostatic charge dissipation.\n\n16 CFR 500.12 - Measurement of commodities by length and width, how expressed.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-01-01\n\n... square foot (929 cm2) be expressed in terms of length and width in linear measure.

Materials and Methods: Standardized videographic recording of 79 subjects during posed smile was captured. Each video was then cut into 30 photos using the free studio software. The widest commissure-to-commissure posed smile frame (posed smile width [SW]) was selected as one of 10 or more frames showing an identical smile. Lower third of the face is measured from subnasale to soft tissue menton using a digital vernier caliper. Two values were then compared. Ratio between lower facial height and posed SW was calculated. Results: The co-relation between smiling width and lower facial height was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.01). The ratio of lower facial height and smiling width was calculated as 1.0016 with a standard deviation (SD) = 0.04 in males and 1.0301 with an SD = 0.07 in females. The difference between the mean lower facial height in males and females was statistically significant with a t = 10.231 and P = 0.000. The difference between the mean smiling width in males and females was also statistically significant with a t = 5.653 and P = 0.000. Conclusion: In class I subjects with pleasing appearance, normal facial proportions, normal overjet and overbite, and average Frankfort mandibular angle, the lower facial height (subnasale to soft tissue menton) is equal to posed SW.

T.; Pavelsky, T.; Pentecost, J.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite will provide measurements of river width and water surface elevation and slope along continuous swaths of world rivers. Understanding water surface slope and width dynamics in river reaches is important for both developing and validating discharge algorithms to be used on future SWOT data. We collected water surface elevation and river width data along a 6.5km stretch of the Olentangy River in Columbus, Ohio from October to December 2014. Continuous measurements of water surface height were supplemented with periodical river width measurements at twenty sites along the study reach. The water surface slope of the entire reach ranged from during 41.58 cm/km at baseflow to 45.31 cm/km after a storm event. The study reach was also broken into sub-reaches roughly 1km in length to study smaller scale slope dynamics. The furthest upstream sub-reaches are characterized by free-flowing riffle-pool sequences, while the furthest downstream sub-reaches were directly affected by two low-head dams. In the sub-reaches immediately upstream of each dam, baseflow slope is as low as 2 cm/km, while the furthest upstream free-flowing sub-reach has a baseflow slope of 100 cm/km. During high flow events the backwater effect of the dams was observed to propagate upstream: sub-reaches impounded by the dams had increased water surface slopes, while free flowing sub-reaches had decreased water surface slopes. During the largest observed flow event, a stage change of 0.40 m affected sub-reach slopes by as much as 30 cm/km. Further analysis will examine height-width relationships within the study reach and relate cross-sectional flow area to river stage. These relationships can be used in conjunction with slope data to estimate discharge using a modified Manning's equation, and are a core component of discharge algorithms being developed for the SWOT mission.\n\nFailure Characteristics of Granite Influenced by Sample Height-to-Width Ratios and Intermediate Principal Stress Under True-Triaxial Unloading Conditions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Xibing; Feng, Fan; Li, Diyuan; Du, Kun; Ranjith, P. G.; Rostami, Jamal\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe failure modes and peak unloading strength of a typical hard rock, Miluo granite, with particular attention to the sample height-to-width ratio (between 2 and 0.5), and the intermediate principal stress was investigated using a true-triaxial test system. The experimental results indicate that both sample height-to-width ratios and intermediate principal stress have an impact on the failure modes, peak strength and severity of rockburst in hard rock under true-triaxial unloading conditions. For longer rectangular specimens, the transition of failure mode from shear to slabbing requires higher intermediate principal stress. With the decrease in sample height-to-width ratios, slabbing failure is more likely to occur under the condition of lower intermediate principal stress. For same intermediate principal stress, the peak unloading strength monotonically increases with the decrease in sample height-to-width. However, the peak unloading strength as functions of intermediate principal stress for different types of rock samples (with sample height-to-width ratio of 2, 1 and 0.5) all present the pattern of initial increase, followed by a subsequent decrease. The curves fitted to octahedral shear stress as a function of mean effective stress also validate the applicability of the Mogi-Coulomb failure criterion for all considered rock sizes under true-triaxial unloading conditions, and the corresponding cohesion C and internal friction angle Ï are calculated. The severity of strainburst of granite depends on the sample height-to-width ratios and intermediate principal stress. Therefore, different supporting strategies are recommended in deep tunneling projects and mining activities. Moreover, the comparison of test results of different Ï 2/ Ï 3 also reveals the little influence of minimum principal stress on failure characteristics of granite during the true-triaxial unloading process.\n\nBAM: Bayesian AMHG-Manning Inference of Discharge Using Remotely Sensed Stream Width, Slope, and Height\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHagemann, M. W.; Gleason, C. J.; Durand, M. T.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) NASA satellite mission will measure water surface width, height, and slope of major rivers worldwide. The resulting data could provide an unprecedented account of river discharge at continental scales, but reliable methods need to be identified prior to launch. Here we present a novel algorithm for discharge estimation from only remotely sensed stream width, slope, and height at multiple locations along a mass-conserved river segment. The algorithm, termed the Bayesian AMHG-Manning (BAM) algorithm, implements a Bayesian formulation of streamflow uncertainty using a combination of Manning's equation and at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG). Bayesian methods provide a statistically defensible approach to generating discharge estimates in a physically underconstrained system but rely on prior distributions that quantify the a priori uncertainty of unknown quantities including discharge and hydraulic equation parameters. These were obtained from literature-reported values and from a USGS data set of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements at USGS stream gauges. A data set of simulated widths, slopes, and heights from 19 rivers was used to evaluate the algorithms using a set of performance metrics. Results across the 19 rivers indicate an improvement in performance of BAM over previously tested methods and highlight a path forward in solving discharge estimation using solely satellite remote sensing.\n\nHow components of facial width to height ratio differently contribute to the perception of social traits\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLio, Guillaume; Gomez, Alice; Sirigu, Angela\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFacial width to height ratio (fWHR) is a morphological cue that correlates with sexual dimorphism and social traits. Currently, it is unclear how vertical and horizontal components of fWHR, distinctly capture facesâ social information. Using a new methodology, we orthogonally manipulated the upper facial height and the bizygomatic width to test their selective effect in the formation of impressions. Subjects (n = 90) saw pair of faces and had to select the face expressing better different social traits (trustworthiness, aggressiveness and femininity). We further investigated how sex and fWHR components interact in the formation of these judgements. Across experiments, changes along the vertical component better predicted participants' ratings rather than the horizontal component. Faces with smaller height were perceived as less trustworthy, less feminine and more aggressive. By dissociating fWHR and testing the contribution of its components independently, we obtained a powerful and discriminative measure of how facial morphology guides social judgements.

In addition we aimed to study whether cardiovascular risk factors could explain possible associations. Methods Parents who participated in the Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag Health Study (HUNT 2; 1995â1997) were linked to offspring data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (1997â2005). The main analyses included 3497 women who had delivered 5010 children, and 2005 men who had fathered 2798 pregnancies. All births took place after parental participation in HUNT 2. Linear regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted differences in pregnancy length according to parental heights. Logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted associations of parental heights with the risk of pre- and post-term births. Results We found a gradual increase in pregnancy length by increasing maternal height, and the association was essentially unchanged after adjustment for maternal cardiovascular risk factors, parental age, offspring sex, parity, and socioeconomic measures. When estimated date of delivery was based on ultrasound, the difference between mothers in the lower height quintile (<163Â cmÂ cm) and mothers in the upper height quintile (â¥ 173Â cm) was 4.3Â days, and when estimated date of delivery was based on last menstrual period (LMP), the difference was 2.8Â days. Shorter women (< 163Â cm) had lower risk of post-term births, and when estimated date of delivery was based on ultrasound they also had higher risk of pre-term births. Paternal height was not associated with pregnancy length, or with the risks of pre- and post-term births. Conclusions Women with shorter stature had shorter pregnancy length and lower risk of post-term births than taller women, and when EDD was based on ultrasound, they also had higher risk of preterm births. The effect of maternal height was generally stronger when\n\nOn the relationship between gingival biotypes and supracrestal gingival height, crown form and papilla height.\n\nPubMed\n\nFischer, Kai R; Grill, Eva; Jockel-Schneider, Yvonne; Bechtold, Markus; Schlagenhauf, Ulrich; Fickl, Stefan\n\n2014-08-01\n\nTo determine the association between gingival biotypes and supracrestal gingival height (primary aim) and its relation to crown shape and papilla height (secondary aim). Eighty adult subjects were evaluated in this study. Based on the transparency of a periodontal probe through the buccal gingival margin, 38 subjects comprised the thin biotype group and 42 subjects comprised the thick biotype group, respectively. Three different parameters were clinically assessed: supracrestal gingival height (SGH) by bone sounding, crown width/crown length ratio and papilla height. No statistical difference (P > 0.05) was detected neither for the correlation between different biotypes (thick/thin) and SGH nor for the association of biotypes and crown width/crown length ratio. Papilla height was only significantly increased (P â¤ 0.05) in the area of teeth no. 21/22 for the thin periodontal biotype. Intra-examiner deviation was found to be very low for all clinical parameters (percentile agreement > 95%). Within the limits of this study, we found that in young Caucasians (i) soft tissue dimensions seem to be similar between biotypes (ii) and the traditional hypothesis that a thick gingiva merges with broad-short crown shape and flat papillae and a thin gingiva with a narrow-long crown shape and high scalloping, may be questionable.

Comparative Study of Esthetic Preferences among Professionals and Laypersons.\n\nPubMed\n\nÃlvarez-Ãlvarez, Lorena; Orozco-Varo, Ana; Arroyo-Cruz, Gema; JimÃ©nez-Castellanos, Emilio\n\n2017-05-17\n\nMany studies have examined the esthetic preferences of professionals in the maxillary anterior region; however, only a few have taken into account the ratios that are more frequent within the population or other ratios suggested in the literature as ideal. Previous studies also failed to compare them with the esthetic preferences of the lay population with regards to the smile. The purpose of this study is to highlight the differences when perceiving the esthetics of smiles between general dentists and laypersons, and linking them with the width/length of the maxillary anterior teeth. Photographs of the full face of a female subject were modified with Photoshop CS regarding the length/width relationships of the 6 maxillary anterior teeth. The three modifications made were: (a) 80% length/width, (b) 85%, length/width, and (c) 85% length/width in central incisors, 80% length/width in lateral incisors and canines. Three sequences of photograph pairs were created with different ratios and presented in PowerPoint to a sample of 100 general dentists and 100 laypersons. The ratio considered as the most esthetic by the majority of the judges was 85% for central incisors and 80% for lateral incisors and canines, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the esthetic preferences of the studied populations either due to gender or professional experience of the dentists (p > 0.01). According to the results obtained in this study, professionals and laypersons considered a width/length ratio of 85% for maxillary central incisors and 80% for lateral incisors and canines as the most esthetic for maxillary anterior teeth. These results do not support findings from other studies previously published with similar ratios in central incisors, lateral incisors, and canines. Today clinicians practice in a treatment environment where not only function and utility but also esthetics is demanded in almost every procedure\n\nEffect of course length and corridor width on the 2-minute walk test performance in geriatric patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nLindemann, Ulrich; Beck, Luisa; Becker, Clemens\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTo evaluate the effect of course length and corridor width on 2-minute walk test results in older adults. Cross-sectional and experimental study with different test conditions. Geriatric rehabilitation clinic. A total of 21 patients (median age 81âyears). Patients walked two minutes on a 20âm and 40âm course with a 2âm or 1âm corridor width and on a continuous course without any turning in a corridor of 2âm width, five walks in total. The distance traveled within the 2âminutes was recorded. Compared with the 20âm course length, median walking distances measured by the 2-minute walk test in a walk way 2âm broad were better on the continuous corridor without any turn (136.9âm vs. 129.3âm, pâ=â0.002) and on the 40âm course (131.8âm vs. 129.3âm, pâ=â0.003). Walking distance on a 20âm course length was longer in a corridor of 2âm width compared with the 1âm corridor width (129.3âm vs. 119.2âm, pâ=â0.005). The walking distance was not affected by corridor width on the 40âm course length. Performance of elderly patients on the 2-minute walk test is influenced by the width of the corridor and the length of the course used.\n\nThe effect of exercise and time on the height and width of the medial longitudinal arch following the modified reverse-6 and the modified augmented low-dye taping procedures.\n\nPubMed\n\nCornwall, Mark W; McPoil, Thomas G; Fair, Austin\n\n2014-10-01\n\nNo evidence exits regarding the magnitude of the change in foot posture following the \"modified reverse-6\" (MR6) taping procedure, either alone or in combination with the \"low-dye\" (LD) taping technique. The purpose of this study was to investigate the change in the height and width of the midfoot after application of the MR6 and the MR6 plus the LD (MR6+LD) taping technique and determine how long those changes last. Eleven individuals (2 female and 9 male) were recruited for this study and were tested under each of two experimental conditions, the MR6 and the MR6+LD taping technique. The order of testing for the two conditions was randomly determined. For each condition, the height and width of the midfoot at 50% of each subject's foot length was initially measured and then again immediately following the application of the tape. These measurements were repeated four hours later immediately prior to running two miles on a treadmill, again immediately after running, and finally after another four hours. The dorsal arch height increased significantly with both the MR6 and MR6+LD taping, but only the MR6+LD remained statistically greater after four hours, a bout of exercise and again at the end of the day. The mean width of the midfoot significantly decreased with both taping procedures. The change in the width of the midfoot remained significantly decreased in both taping conditions after exercise and throughout the day. Both taping procedures are able to significantly change the height and width of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot, but the change lasted longer when the two taping procedures were combined. Level 3, Prospective Cohort Study.\n\nBiometric analysis of the clinical crown and the width/length ratio in the maxillary anterior region.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrozco-Varo, Ana; Arroyo-Cruz, Gema; MartÃ­nez-de-Fuentes, Rafael; JimÃ©nez-Castellanos, Emilio\n\n2015-06-01\n\nRestorative dentistry often involves correcting tooth size discrepancies. Therefore, dental biometrics should play an important role in the planning of an esthetic restoration. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical crown width, length, and width/length ratio of maxillary central incisors, lateral incisors, and canines in an adult population. The study also aimed to determine whether a correlation exists between natural tooth dimensions and the optimal tooth dimension guidelines suggested for planning esthetic restorations. Stone casts were poured from irreversible hydrocolloid impressions of 412 healthy adult participants. These casts were used to measure the maximum mesiodistal width and maximum crown-root length of the maxillary central incisors, lateral incisors, and canines with a digital precision caliper (0.01 mm). The width/length ratio was calculated for each tooth, and 40 casts were selected to test the reliability of the measuring method. The mean age of the participants in the sample was 33.94 years; 60.7% were women and 39.3% were men. The mean width value was 8.71 mm for central incisors, 6.75 mm for lateral incisors, and 7.81 mm for canines. The mean length was 10.23 mm for central incisors, 8.59 mm for lateral incisors, and 9.93 mm for canines. The average width/length ratio was 85% for central incisors and 79% for lateral incisors and canines. The data obtained from the population studied are similar to those from previous research studies with similar methodology. However, great discrepancies in the absolute values were found when compared with other studies of ideal tooth dimension guidelines on the personal preferences and the esthetic perception of dentists. The perception of what is considered natural seems to differ from what is considered esthetically perfect. Copyright Â© 2015 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.

We report leg length, sitting height, and body proportion curves for achondroplasia. Seven centile format of sitting height, leg length, sitting height/leg length ratio, sitting height/height ratio, and head circumference/height ratio were estimated by the LMS method. The Q-test was applied to assess the goodness of fit. For comparison, centiles of sitting height and leg length were graphed using Argentine national growth references for achondroplasia and non-achondroplasia populations. The sample consisted of 342 children with achondroplasia (171 males, 171 females) aged 0-18 years. The median (interquartile range) number of measurements per child was 6 (3, 12) for sitting height and 8 (3, 13) for head circumference. Median leg length increased from 14âcm at age 1 week to 44 and 40âcm (males and females, respectively) in achondroplasia adolescents which is 3.5âcm shorter than non-achondroplasia children at age 1 week and, 38âcm shorter at adolescence. Median sitting height increased from 34âcm at birth to 86 and 81 in adolescents' boys and girls respectively, only 5âcm shorter than non-achondroplasia children. Sitting height/leg length decreased from 2.61 at birth to approximately 1.90 at adolescent. Median head circumference/height ratio decreased from 0.79 at birth to 0.46 at 18 years in both sexes. Growth of lower limbs is affected early in life and becomes more noticeable throughout childhood. The disharmonic growth between the less affected trunk and the severely affected limbs determine body disproportion in achondroplasia.

However, it has never been studied in elderly COPD patients. To evaluate the accuracy of substituting arm span length for current standing height in the evaluation of pulmonary function parameters and severity classification in elderly Thai COPD patients. Current standing height and arm span length were measured in COPD patients aged >60 years. Postbronchodilator spirometric parameters, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1), and ratio of FEV1/FVC (FEV1%), were used to classify disease severity according to global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease criteria. Predicted values for each parameter were also calculated separately utilizing current standing height or arm span length measurements. Student's t-tests and chi-squared tests were used to compare differences between the groups. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. A total of 106 COPD patients with a mean age of 72.1Â±7.8 years, mean body mass index of 20.6Â±3.8 kg/m(2), and mean standing height of 156.4Â±8.3 cm were enrolled. The mean arm span length exceeded mean standing height by 7.7Â±4.6 cm (164.0Â±9.0 vs 156.4Â±8.3 cm, P<0.001), at a ratio of 1.05Â±0.03. Percentages of both predicted FVC and FEV1 values based on arm span length were significantly lower than those using current standing height (76.6Â±25.4 vs 61.6Â±16.8, P<0.001 and 50.8Â±25.4 vs 41.1Â±15.3, P<0.001). Disease severity increased in 39.6% (42/106) of subjects using arm span length over current standing height for predicted lung function. Direct substitution of arm span length for current standing height in elderly Thai COPD patients should not be recommended in cases where arm span length exceeds standing height by more than 4 cm.\n\nGroup Facial Width-to-Height Ratio Predicts Intergroup Negotiation Outcomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYang, Yu; Tang, Chen; Qu, Xiaofei; Wang, Chao; Denson, Thomas F.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPast studies have found that the facial width-to-height ratio (FWHR) is associated with a range of traits and behaviors that are possibly important to dyadic negotiations. However, it is unknown whether the FWHR would have an impact on intergroup negotiations, which happen frequently and often have higher stakes in the real world. To examine this question, in the current study, we randomly assigned 1,337 Chinese business executives into 288 groups and they completed a multi-issue negotiation exercise against each other. Results showed that groups with larger maximum individual FWHRs achieved objectively better negotiation outcomes. We conclude that groups containing individuals with relatively large FWHRs can claim more value in negotiations between groups.

S.; Jones, Alex L.; Ward, Robert\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFacial width-to-height ratio has received a great deal of attention in recent research. Evidence from human skulls suggests that males have a larger relative facial width than females, and that this sexual dimorphism is an honest signal of masculinity, aggression, and related traits. However, evidence that this measure is sexually dimorphic in faces, rather than skulls, is surprisingly weak. We therefore investigated facial width-to-height ratio in three White European samples using three different methods of measurement: 2D photographs, 3D scans, and anthropometry. By measuring the same individuals with multiple methods, we demonstrated high agreement across all measures. However, we found no evidence of sexual dimorphism in the face. In our third study, we also found a link between facial width-to-height ratio and body mass index for both males and females, although this relationship did not account for the lack of dimorphism in our sample. While we showed sufficient power to detect differences between male and female width-to-height ratio, our results failed to support the general hypothesis of sexual dimorphism in the face.

Other research, however, has failed to replicate the fWHR-aggression relationship and has questioned whether previous findings are robust. In the current paper, we synthesize existing work by conducting a meta-analysis to estimate whether and how fWHR predicts aggression. Our results indicate a small, but significant, positive relationship between menâs fWHR and aggression.

In the article, there is a data error in the Results section of Study 1c. The fourth sentence of the fourth paragraph should read as follows: High fWHR targets (M= 74.39, SD=18.25) were rated as equivalently evolved as their low fWHR counterparts (M=79.39, SD=15.91).] The ascription of mind to others is central to social cognition. Most research on the ascription of mind has focused on motivated, top-down processes. The current work provides novel evidence that facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) serves as a bottom-up perceptual signal of humanness. Using a range of well-validated operational definitions of humanness, we provide evidence across 5 studies that target faces with relatively greater fWHR are seen as less than fully human compared with their relatively lower fWHR counterparts. We then present 2 ancillary studies exploring whether the fWHR-to-humanness link is mediated by previously established fWHR-trait links in the literature. Finally, 3 additional studies extend this fWHR-humanness link beyond measurements of humanness, demonstrating that the fWHR-humanness link has consequences for downstream social judgments including the sorts of crimes people are perceived to be guilty of and the social tasks for which they seem helpful. In short, we provide evidence for the hypothesis that individuals with relatively greater facial width-to-height ratio are routinely denied sophisticated, humanlike minds.

In this study, a genetic linkage map was constructed using sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers based on an F1 population containing 148 individuals generated from a cross between T. 'Zhongshanshan 302' and T. mucronatum. The map has a total length of 976.5Â cM, with a mean distance of 7.0Â cM between markers, and contains 34 linkage groups with 179 markers (171 SRAPs and 8 SSRs). Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting growth traits, such as seedling height, basal diameter and crown width, were detected based on the constructed linkage map. Four significant QTLs were identified, three of which, namely qtSH-1 for seedling height, qtBD-1 for basal diameter and qtCW-1 for crown width, were located at 2.659Â cM of LG7 with logarithm odds values of 3.72, 3.49 and 3.93, respectively, and explained 24.9, 27.0 and 21.7Â % of the total variation of the three grown traits, respectively. Another QTL for crown width (qtCW-2) was detected at 1.0Â cM on LG13, with a logarithm of odds value of 3.15, and explained 31.7Â % of the total variation of crown width. This is the first report on the construction of a genetic linkage map and QTL analysis in Taxodium, laying the groundwork for the construction of a high-density genetic map and QTL mapping in the genus Taxodium.\n\nEffect of using truncated versus total foot length to calculate the arch height ratio.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcPoil, Thomas G; Cornwall, Mark W; Vicenzino, Bill; Teyhen, Deydre S; Molloy, Joseph M; Christie, Douglas S; Collins, Natalie\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the arch height ratio in a large cohort of subjects as well as to assess the reliability and validity of the foot measurements utilized in the study. Eight hundred and fifty subjects, 393 women and 457 men, consented to participate in the study. The dorsal arch height, total foot length, and the truncated foot length were used to calculate two variations of the arch height ratio. In addition to determining within- and between-rater measurement reliability, radiographs were used to establish validity. The truncated arch height ratio can be estimated using the total foot length, unless toe deformities are present in the individual being assessed. All foot measurements had high levels of intra- and inter-rater reliability and the validity of measuring the dorsal arch height while standing with equal weight on both feet was established. This investigation provides normative values from a large cohort of healthy female and male subjects for two variations of the arch height ratio. The arch height ratio is a reliable and valid measurement that may prove useful to clinicians and researchers for the classification of foot posture.\n\nThe relation between height, foot length, pelvic adequacy and mode of delivery.\n\nPubMed\n\nVan Bogaert, L J\n\n1999-02-01\n\nTo investigate the value of maternal height and foot length as predictors of pelvic adequacy and to evaluate the influence of body components' proportions on the mode of delivery. Retrospective study of the anthropometry of women having normal vertex deliveries (NVD), caesarean sections (CS) and vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC). NVD patients were taller, had a longer vertebral column, longer lower limbs and longer feet than CS and than VBAC patients. The anthropometric measurements of VBAC patients yielded values intermediate between CS and NVD patients. The ratios of height to any of the other measured variables (vertebral column, lower limb and foot length) were similar in the three groups indicating that the body proportions were the same. Maternal height and foot length are of limited value as predictors of pelvic (in-)adequacy. The anthropometric features of women delivered by CS only are similar to those of women having a vaginal birth after Caesarean.\n\nReal-Time Measurement of Width and Height of Weld Beads in GMAW Processes.\n\nPubMed\n\nPinto-Lopera, JesÃºs Emilio; S T Motta, JosÃ© Mauricio; Absi Alfaro, Sadek Crisostomo\n\n2016-09-15\n\nAssociated to the weld quality, the weld bead geometry is one of the most important parameters in welding processes. It is a significant requirement in a welding project, especially in automatic welding systems where a specific width, height, or penetration of weld bead is needed. This paper presents a novel technique for real-time measuring of the width and height of weld beads in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) using a single high-speed camera and a long-pass optical filter in a passive vision system. The measuring method is based on digital image processing techniques and the image calibration process is based on projective transformations. The measurement process takes less than 3 milliseconds per image, which allows a transfer rate of more than 300 frames per second. The proposed methodology can be used in any metal transfer mode of a gas metal arc welding process and does not have occlusion problems. The responses of the measurement system, presented here, are in a good agreement with off-line data collected by a common laser-based 3D scanner. Each measurement is compare using a statistical Welch's t-test of the null hypothesis, which, in any case, does not exceed the threshold of significance level Î± = 0.01, validating the results and the performance of the proposed vision system.\n\nReal-Time Measurement of Width and Height of Weld Beads in GMAW Processes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPinto-Lopera, JesÃºs Emilio; S.

This paper presents a novel technique for real-time measuring of the width and height of weld beads in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) using a single high-speed camera and a long-pass optical filter in a passive vision system. The measuring method is based on digital image processing techniques and the image calibration process is based on projective transformations. The measurement process takes less than 3 milliseconds per image, which allows a transfer rate of more than 300 frames per second. The proposed methodology can be used in any metal transfer mode of a gas metal arc welding process and does not have occlusion problems. The responses of the measurement system, presented here, are in a good agreement with off-line data collected by a common laser-based 3D scanner. Each measurement is compare using a statistical Welchâs t-test of the null hypothesis, which, in any case, does not exceed the threshold of significance level Î± = 0.01, validating the results and the performance of the proposed vision system.

Arm span has been used as a surrogate but is not feasible in children with shoulder or arm contractures. Ulnar length is not usually impaired by joint deformities, yet its utility as a surrogate has not been adequately studied. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to examine the accuracy and reliability of ulnar length measured by different tools as a surrogate measure of recumbent length and height. Anthropometrics [recumbent length, height, arm span, and ulnar length by caliper (ULC), ruler (ULR), and grid (ULG)] were measured in 1479 healthy infants and children aged <6 y across 8 study centers in the United States. Multivariate mixed-effects linear regression models for recumbent length and height were developed by using ulnar length and arm span as surrogate measures. The agreement between the measured length or height and the predicted values by ULC, ULR, ULG, and arm span were examined by Bland-Altman plots. All 3 measures of ulnar length and arm span were highly correlated with length and height. The degree of precision of prediction equations for length by ULC, ULR, and ULG (R(2) = 0.95, 0.95, and 0.92, respectively) was comparable with that by arm span (R(2) = 0.97) using age, sex, and ethnicity as covariates; however, height prediction by ULC (R(2) = 0.87), ULR (R(2) = 0.85), and ULG (R(2) = 0.88) was less comparable with arm span (R(2) = 0.94). Our study demonstrates that arm span and ULC, ULR, or ULG can serve as accurate and reliable surrogate measures of recumbent length and height in healthy children; however, ULC, ULR, and ULG tend to slightly overestimate length and height in young infants and children. Further testing of ulnar length as a surrogate is warranted in physically impaired or nonambulatory children.

Participants detected the drop-offs significantly more reliably with the standard-length cane (79.5% Â± 6.5% of the time) than with the extended-length cane (67.6% Â± 9.1%), p <.001. The drop-off detection threshold of the standard-length cane (4.1 Â± 1.1 cm) was also significantly smaller than that of the extended-length cane (6.5Â±1.8cm), p <.001. In addition, participants detected drop-offs at a significantly higher percentage when they swung the cane approximately 3 cm beyond the widest part of the body (78.6% Â± 7.6%) than when they swung it substantially wider (30 cm; 68.5% Â± 8.3%), p <.001. In contrast, neither cane length (p =.074) nor cane swing arc width (p =.185) had a significant effect on obstacle detection performance. The findings of the study may help orientation and mobility specialists recommend appropriate cane length and cane swing arc width to visually impaired cane users.

Axial eye lengths were determined by an ultrasonic eye biometry (A scan). Axial length of both eyes increases with age, height, and weight but shows a closer correlation to height and weight than to age. Boys have a significantly longer axial eye length than girls (P < 0.01). Boys or girls of similar or nearing body height and body weight and with emmetropic eyes have close linear measures of anatomic eye structures within their sex, regardless their age. Body height demonstrates the closest correlation to the growth and development of the emmetropic eye.

The CT measured size has a close correlation to the estimated prognosis for spontaneous passage of a ureteral calculus. Size estimations of urinary calculi in CT images are still based on two-dimensional (2D) reformats. To develop and validate a calculus oriented three-dimensional (3D) method for measuring the length and width of urinary calculi and to compare the calculus oriented measurements of the length and width with corresponding 2D measurements obtained in axial and coronal reformats. Fifty unenhanced CT examinations demonstrating urinary calculi were included. A 3D symmetric segmentation algorithm was validated against reader size estimations. The calculus oriented size from the segmentation was then compared to the estimated size in axial and coronal 2D reformats. The validation showed 0.1âÂ±â0.7âmm agreement against reference measure. There was a 0.4âmm median bias for 3D estimated calculus length compared to 2D (Pâ<â0.001), but no significant bias for 3D width compared to 2D. The length of a calculus in axial and coronal reformats becomes underestimated compared to 3D if its orientation is not aligned to the image planes. Future studies aiming to correlate calculus size with patient outcome should use a calculus oriented size estimation.

In Experiment 1, three Japanese words, each consisting of four Hiragana characters, sequentially scrolled on a display screen from right to left. Participants, all Japanese native speakers, were instructed to read the words aloud as accurately as possible, irrespective of their order within the sequence. To quantitatively measure their reading performance, we used rapid serial visual presentation paradigm, where the scrolling rate was increased until the participants began to make mistakes. Thus, the highest scrolling rate at which the participantsâ performance exceeded 88.9% correct rate was calculated for each character size (0.3Â°, 0.6Â°, 1.0Â°, and 3.0Â°) and scroll window size (5 or 10 character spaces). Results showed that the reading performance was highest in the range of 0.6Â° to 1.0Â°, irrespective of the scroll window size. Experiment 2 investigated whether the optimal character size observed in Experiment 1 was applicable for any word width and word length (i.e., the number of characters in a word). Results showed that reading speeds were slower for longer than shorter words and the word width of 3.6Â° was optimal among the word lengths tested (three, four, and six character words). Considering that character size varied depending on word width and word length in the present study, this means that the optimal character size can be changed by word width and word length in scrolling Japanese words.

The age at which these begin to affect growth is unclear. We modelled the effect of these SNPs on birth length and childhood growth. A total of 7768 participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children had data available. Individual growth trajectories from 0 to 10 years were estimated using mixed-effects linear spline models and differences in trajectories by individual SNPs and allelic score were determined. The allelic score was associated with birth length (0.026 cm increase per 'tall' allele, SE = 0.003, P = 1 Ã 10(-15), equivalent to 0.017 SD). There was little evidence of association between the allelic score and early infancy growth (0-3 months), but there was evidence of association between the allelic score and later growth. This association became stronger with each consecutive growth period, per 'tall' allele per month effects were 0.015 SD (3 months-1 year, SE = 0.004), 0.023 SD (1-3 years, SE = 0.003) and 0.028 SD (3-10 years, SE = 0.003). By age 10, the mean height difference between individuals with â¤170 versus â¥191 'tall' alleles (the top and bottom 10%) was 4.7 cm (0.8 SD), explaining â¼5% of the variance. There was evidence of associations with specific growth periods for some SNPs (rs3791675, EFEMP1 and rs6569648, L3MBTL3) and supportive evidence for previously reported age-dependent effects of HHIP and SOCS2 SNPs. SNPs associated with adult height influence birth length and have an increasing effect on growth from late infancy through to late childhood. By age 10, they explain half the height variance (â¼5%) of that explained in adults (â¼10%).\n\nDesign and experimental study on Fresnel lens of the combination of equal-width and equal-height of grooves\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuo, Limin; Liu, Youqiang; Huang, Rui; Wang, Zhiyong\n\n2017-06-01\n\nHigh concentrating PV systems rely on large Fresnel lens that must be precisely oriented in the direction of the Sun to maintain high concentration ratio. We propose a new Fresnel lens design method combining equal-width and equal-height of grooves in this paper based on the principle of focused spot maximum energy. In the ring band near the center of Fresnel lens, the design with equal-width grooves is applied, and when the given condition is reached, the design with equal-height grooves is introduced near the edges of the Fresnel lens, which ensures all the lens grooves are planar. In this paper, we establish a Fresnel lens design example model by Solidworks, and simulate it with the software ZEMAX. An experimental test platform is built to test, and the simulation correctness is proved by experiments. Experimental result shows the concentrating efficiency of this example is 69.3%, slightly lower than the simulation result 75.1%.\n\nGeographical Distribution of Adolescent Body Height with Respect to Effective Day Length in Japan: An Ecological Analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYokoya, Masana; Shimizu, Hideyasu; Higuchi, Yukito\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe height of Japanese youth raised in the northern region tends to be greater than that of youth raised in the southern region; therefore, a geographical gradient in youth body height exists. Although this gradient has existed for about 100 years, the reasons for it remain unclear. Consideration of the nutritional improvement, economic growth, and intense migration that has occurred in this period indicates that it is probably the result of environmental rather than nutritional or genetic factors. To identify possible environmental factors, ecological analysis of prefecture-level data on the body size of 8- to 17-year-old youth averaged over a 13-year period (1996 to 2008) and Japanese mesh climatic data on the climatic variables of temperature, solar radiation, and effective day length (duration of photoperiod exceeding the threshold of light intensity) was performed. The geographical distribution of the standardized height of Japanese adolescents was found to be inversely correlated to a great extent with the distribution of effective day length at a light intensity greater than 4000 lx. The results of multiple regression analysis of effective day length, temperature, and weight (as an index of food intake) indicated that a combination of effective day length and weight was statistically significant as predictors of height in early adolescence; however, only effective day length was statistically significant as a predictor of height in late adolescence. Day length may affect height by affecting the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that inhibits sexual and skeletal maturation, which in turn induces increases in height. By affecting melatonin production, regional differences in the duration of the photoperiod may lead to regional differences in height. Exposure to light intensity greater than 4000 lx appears to be the threshold at which light intensity begins to affect the melatonin secretion of humans who spend much of their time indoors.

Deska, E. Paige Lloyd and Kurt Hugenberg ( Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , Advanced Online Publication, Aug 28, 2017, np). In the article, there is a data error in the Results section of Study 1c. The fourth sentence of the fourth paragraph should read as follows: High fWHR targets (M= 74.39, SD=18.25) were rated as equivalently evolved as their low fWHR counterparts (M=79.39, SD=15.91). (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-36694-001.) The ascription of mind to others is central to social cognition. Most research on the ascription of mind has focused on motivated, top-down processes. The current work provides novel evidence that facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) serves as a bottom-up perceptual signal of humanness. Using a range of well-validated operational definitions of humanness, we provide evidence across 5 studies that target faces with relatively greater fWHR are seen as less than fully human compared with their relatively lower fWHR counterparts. We then present 2 ancillary studies exploring whether the fWHR-to-humanness link is mediated by previously established fWHR-trait links in the literature. Finally, 3 additional studies extend this fWHR-humanness link beyond measurements of humanness, demonstrating that the fWHR-humanness link has consequences for downstream social judgments including the sorts of crimes people are perceived to be guilty of and the social tasks for which they seem helpful. In short, we provide evidence for the hypothesis that individuals with relatively greater facial width-to-height ratio are routinely denied sophisticated, humanlike minds.

Although judgments of emotion are primarily determined by musculature, static face structure can also impact emotion judgments. The current work investigates how facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR), a stable feature of all faces, influences perceivers' judgments of expressive displays of anger and fear (Studies 1a, 1b, & 2), and anger and happiness (Study 3). Across 4 studies, we provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that perceivers more readily see anger on faces with high fWHR compared with those with low fWHR, which instead facilitates the recognition of fear and happiness. This bias emerges when participants are led to believe that targets displaying otherwise neutral faces are attempting to mask an emotion (Studies 1a & 1b), and is evident when faces display an emotion (Studies 2 & 3). Together, these studies suggest that target facial width-to-height ratio biases ascriptions of emotion with consequences for emotion recognition speed and accuracy.

A study of 3,647 children.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheng, J C; Leung, S S; Chiu, B S; Tse, P W; Lee, C W; Chan, A K; Xia, G; Leung, A K; Xu, Y Y\n\n1998-01-01\n\nIt is well known that significant differences exist in the anthropometric data of different races and ethnic groups. This is a cross-sectional study on segmental bone length based on 3,647 Chinese children of equal sex distribution aged 3-18 years. The measurements included standing height, weight, arm span, foot length, and segmental bone length of the humerus, radius, ulna, and tibia. A normality growth chart of all the measured parameters was constructed. Statistical analysis of the results showed a very high linear correlation of height with arm span, foot length, and segmental bone lengths with a correlation coefficient of 0.96-0.99 for both sexes. No differences were found between the right and left side of all the segmental bone lengths. These Chinese children were found to have a proportional limb segmental length relative to the trunk.\n\nTwo-phase flow regimes in a horizontal microchannel with the height of 50 Î¼m and width of 10 mm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFina, V. P.; Ronshin, F. V.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTwo-phase flows of distilled deionized nanofiltered water and nitrogen gas in a microchannel with a height of 50 Î¼m and a width of 10 mm have been investigated experimentally. The schlieren method has been used to determine main features of the two-phase flow in the microchannel. This method allows detecting the liquid film on the lower and upper walls of the microchannel as well as droplets of various shapes and sizes or vertical liquid bridges. Two-phase flow regimes have been observed, and their boundaries precisely determined using post-processing of the recordings. The following flow regimes have been distinguished: bubble, churn, jet, stratified and annular. Comparison of regime maps for channels of different widths has been carried out, and this parameter showed to have a significant impact on the boundaries between the regimes in microchannels of a height of less than 100 Î¼m.\n\nFacial Width-to-Height Ratio Does Not Predict Self-Reported Behavioral Tendencies.\n\nPubMed\n\nKosinski, Michal\n\n2017-11-01\n\nA growing number of studies have linked facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) with various antisocial or violent behavioral tendencies. However, those studies have predominantly been laboratory based and low powered. This work reexamined the links between fWHR and behavioral tendencies in a large sample of 137,163 participants. Behavioral tendencies were measured using 55 well-established psychometric scales, including self-report scales measuring intelligence, domains and facets of the five-factor model of personality, impulsiveness, sense of fairness, sensational interests, self-monitoring, impression management, and satisfaction with life. The findings revealed that fWHR is not substantially linked with any of these self-reported measures of behavioral tendencies, calling into question whether the links between fWHR and behavior generalize beyond the small samples and specific experimental settings that have been used in past fWHR research.\n\nEffect of fiber post length and abutment height on fracture resistance of endodontically treated premolars prepared for zirconia crowns.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Jie; Matinlinna, Jukka Pekka; Shinya, Akikazu; Botelho, Michael George; Zheng, Zhiqiang\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the fracture resistance, mode of fracture, and stress distribution of endodontically treated teeth prepared with three different fiber post lengths and two different abutment heights, using both experimental and finite element (FE) approaches. Forty-eight human maxillary premolars with two roots were selected and endodontically treated. The teeth were randomly distributed into six equally sized groups (nÂ =Â 8) with different combinations of post lengths (7.5, 11, and 15Â mm) and abutment heights (3 and 5Â mm). All the teeth restored with glass fiber post (Rely X Fiber Post, 3M ESPE, USA) and a full zirconia crown. All the specimens were thermocycled and then loaded to failure at an oblique angle of 135Â°. Statistical analysis was performed for the effects of post length and abutment height on failure loads using ANOVA and Tukey's honestly significant difference test. In addition, corresponding FE models of a premolar restored with a glass fiber post were developed to examine mechanical responses. The factor of post length (PÂ <Â 0.01) had a significant effect on failure load. The abutment height (PÂ >Â 0.05) did not have a significant effect on failure load. The highest mean fracture resistance was recorded for the 15Â mm post length and 5Â mm abutment height test group, which was significantly more resistant to fracture than the 7.5Â mm post and 5Â mm abutment height group (PÂ <Â 0.05). The FE analysis showed the peak compression and tension stress values of 7.5Â mm post length were higher than that of 11 and 15Â mm post length. The stress value of remaining tooth decreased as the post length was increased. Within the limitations of this experimental and FE analysis study, increasing the post length inside the root of endodontically treated premolar teeth restored with glass-fiber posts increase the fracture resistance to non-axial forces. Failure mode is more favorable with reduced abutment heights.\n\nMaternal height and length of gestation: does this impact on preterm labour in Asian women?\n\nPubMed\n\nChan, Ben Chong-Pun; Lao, Terence Tzu-Hsi\n\n2009-08-01\n\nBoth maternal height and ethnicity may influence the gestation length, but their independent effect is unclear. This study was performed to examine the relationship between maternal height and gestational length in women with singleton pregnancies in a Chinese and southeast Asian population. A retrospective cohort study was performed on women carrying singleton pregnancies with spontaneous labour in a 48-month period managed under our department to determine the relationship between maternal height, expressed in quartiles, with the mean gestational age and incidence of preterm labour. Of the 16 384 women who delivered within this period, the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values of maternal height were 153 cm, 156 cm and 160 cm respectively. Excluded from analysis were 6597 women because of multifetal pregnancy, teenage pregnancy (maternal age < or = 19 years old), induction of labour or elective caesarean section, or incomplete data due to no antenatal booking in our hospital. Significant differences were found in the maternal weight and body mass index, incidences of multiparity and smokers, gestational age and birthweight among the four quartiles. There was significantly increased incidence of preterm birth between 32 and 37 weeks gestation in women with shorter stature. In our population, maternal height has an influence on gestational length, and the lower three quartiles was associated with increased odds of labour at > 32 to < 37 weeks. This effect should be taken into consideration in the adoption of international recommendations in obstetric management and intervention.\n\nAn anthropometric analysis of facial height, arch length, and palatal rugae in the Indian and Nepalese population.\n\nPubMed\n\nKallianpur, Shreenivas; Desai, Ami; Kasetty, Sowmya; Sudheendra, Us; Joshi, Prathamesh\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA country such as India abounds with diverse population groups with distinct anthropometric characteristics. Among these, numerous Nepalese population groups are present in different states of India comprising one of the most common immigrant races. The aim of the study is to compare two distinct races, Indians and Nepalese on the basis of facial height proportions, arch length and palatal rugae patterns and assess their significance in racial identification. A total of 120 subjects comprising of 60 Indians and 60 Nepalese were selected, with each group including 30 males and 30 females. Facial heights were measured using sliding digital calipers, arch lengths with the help of a brass wire and rugae patterns were traced on dental casts obtained with alginate impressions. Facial height measurements did not give significant results for racial or gender identification of given races. Differences between arch length parameters were found to be significant between the two population groups. Secondary and fragmentary palatal rugae forms were found to be more common in Nepalese than Indians. The Indian and Nepalese have similar anthropometric characteristics with regard to facial height. However, arch length and palatal rugae characteristics vary between the two races.\n\nQuantifying the forcing effect of channel width variations on free bars: Morphodynamic modeling based on characteristic dissipative Galerkin scheme\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, Fu-Chun; Shao, Yun-Chuan; Chen, Yu-Chen\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThe forcing effect of channel width variations on free bars is investigated in this study using a two-dimensional depth-averaged morphodynamic model. The novel feature of the model is the incorporation of a characteristic dissipative Galerkin (CDG) upwinding scheme in the bed evolution module. A correction for the secondary flows induced by streamline curvature is also included, allowing for simulations of bar growth and migration in channels with width variations beyond the small-amplitude regimes. The model is tested against a variety of experimental data ranging from purely forced and free bars to coexisting bed forms in the variable-width channel. The CDG scheme effectively dissipates local bed oscillations, thus sustains numerical stabilities. The results show that the global effect of width variations on bar height is invariably suppressive. Such effect increases with the dimensionless amplitude AC and wave number Î»C of width variations. For small AC, Î»C has little effects on bar height; for AC beyond small amplitudes, however, the suppressing effect depends on both AC and Î»C. The suppressing effect on bar length increases also with both AC and Î»C, but is much weaker than that on bar height. The global effect of width variations on bar celerity can be suppressive or enhancive, depending on the combination of AC and Î»C. For smaller Î»C, the effect on bar celerity is enhancive; for larger Î»C, bar celerity tends to increase at small AC but decreases for AC beyond small amplitudes. We present herein an unprecedented data set verifying the theoretical prediction on celerity enhancement. Full suppression of bar growth above the theoretically predicted threshold AC was not observed, regardless of the adopted amplitude of initial bed perturbation A. The global effects of width variations on free bars can be quantified using a forcing factor FC that integrates the effects of AC and Î»C. The suppressing effects on bar height and length are both proportional to FC\n\nShared genetic determinants of axial length and height in children: the Guangzhou twin eye study.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Jian; Hur, Yoon-Mi; Huang, Wenyong; Ding, Xiaohu; Feng, Ke; He, Mingguang\n\n2011-01-01\n\nTo describe the association between axial length (AL) and height and to estimate the extent to which shared genetic or environmental factors influence this covariance. Study participants were recruited from the Guangzhou Twin Registry. Axial length was measured using partial coherence laser interferometry. Height was measured with the participants standing without shoes. We computed twin pairwise correlations and cross-twin cross-trait correlations between AL and height for monozygotic and dizygotic twins and performed model-fitting analyses using a multivariate Cholesky model. The right eye was arbitrarily selected to represent AL of participants. Five hundred sixty-five twin pairs (359 monozygotic and 206 dizygotic) aged 7 to 15 years were available for analysis. Phenotypic correlation between AL and height was 0.46 but decreased to 0.19 after adjusting for age, sex, and age Ã sex interaction. Bivariate Cholesky model-fitting analyses revealed that 89% of phenotypic correlation was due to shared genetic factors and 11% was due to shared random environmental factors, which includes measurement error. Covariance of AL and height is largely attributable to shared genes. Given that AL is a key determinant of myopia, further work is needed to confirm gene sharing between myopia and stature.\n\nHeight and relative leg length as indicators of the quality of the environment among Mozambican juveniles and adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nPadez, Cristina; Varela-Silva, Maria InÃªs; Bogin, Barry\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe growth status of Mozambique adolescents was assessed to test the hypothesis that relative leg length is a more sensitive indicator of the quality of the environment than the total height. The sample comprised 690 boys and 727 girls, aged between 9 and 17 years, from Maputo. It is divided between those living in the Centre of Maputo and those living in the slums on the periphery of the city. Height, weight, and sitting height were measured and the sitting height ratio was calculated. The hypothesis that relative leg length is more sensitive than total stature as an indicator of environmental quality is not uniformly confirmed. Overall, mean stature is greater for the centre group than the slum group, but relative leg length as measured by the sitting height ratio does not differ. Compared with African-American references (NHANES II), all centre girls, 9- to 14-year-old slum girls, all slum boys, and the oldest centre boys show relatively shorter legs. These findings show that within the Mozambique sample, relative leg length is not sensitive enough to distinguish the quality of the living environment. Mozambique was a colony of Portugal until 1975. Civil unrest and warfare characterized the late Colonial period and the postindependence period until a peace settlement was concluded in 1992. It is possible that all socioeconomic status groups within the cou"
