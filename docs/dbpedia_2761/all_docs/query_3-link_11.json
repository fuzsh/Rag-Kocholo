        "text": "Sweden’s scenic Wilderness Road – also known as Vildmarksvägen in Swedish – is the country’s highest paved road, reaching 867 metres above sea level at its highest point. The 500-kilometre circular route runs from Strömsund in northern Jämtland via Gäddede to Vilhelmina in southern Lapland, joining up with the E45 through Dorotea. The most iconic part of the drive crosses Stekenjokk Plateau, a protected Sámi heritage landscape where reindeer graze and rare bird species thrive. Good to know: This particular section of the road is only open from 6 June to 15 October each year, owing to the vast amounts of snow that fall in winter.\n\nWhat to do and where to stop along the Wilderness Road\n\nWith so many things to see and do along the Wilderness Road, it’s worth giving yourself a few days to explore. There are dozens of natural beauty spots and opportunities for hiking, biking, paddling and wild swimming, not to mention fishing and wildlife watching.\n\nHere are just a few of the unmissable sights and stops along the Wilderness Road.\n\nWaterfalls, lakes and underwater caves\n\nThe Wilderness Road boasts a plethora of lakes, waterways and easily accessible waterfalls. Take Hällingsåfallet, one of Sweden’s tallest waterfalls, about an hour and a half from Strömsund. Plunging over 40 metres into Hällingsån canyon, Sweden’s longest water-filled canyon, with an accessible footpath from the parking area, as well as a five-kilometre-long hiking trail.\n\nAnother waterfall highlight is Trappstegsforsen, by Lake Kultsjön – the tumbling cascades are popular with fishing enthusiasts and photographers alike. Also of note – there’s a little café here in summertime.\n\nStora Blåsjön – approaching the road to Stekenjokk\n\nAbout 45 kilometres north of Gäddede lies the lake and hamlet Stora Blåsjön. Literally meaning the Big Blue Lake, Stora Blåsjön boasts 40 square kilometres of serene, mirror-glass reflection, with stunning views of the mountains, as well as excellent trout fishing. Stora Blåsjön is also a central hub for outdoor activities like hiking, kayaking or riding. If you’re planning to bed down for the night, then Camp Stora Blåsjön has a selection of cabins as well as parking spots for camper vans. The best bit – you can park lakeside and enjoy a dip first thing in the morning.\n\nThere’s a huge variety of places to stay along the Wilderness Road – from hotels and self-catering cabins to youth hostels, campsites and in-the-wild accommodation. What could be better than a night under the stars in the great outdoors?\n\nThe Coral Cave – Sweden’s longest underwater cave\n\nDrive further along from Stora Blåsjön and you’ll come across one of Sweden’s natural wonders, the Coral Cave (Korallgrottan). At six kilometres long, the Coral Cave is Sweden’s longest underwater cave, boasting 26 square kilometres of narrow passages as well as great cavernous halls – there’s even a waterfall at the entrance. The cave is only accessible with guided tours during the summer months.\n\nStekenjokk – the legendary Sámi mountain plateau\n\nUndoubtedly, the most famous stretch on Sweden’s Wilderness Road is the 20-kilometre-long drive through Stekenjokk Plateau (only open from 6 June ­– 15 October­). This unique and austerely beautiful landscape is subject to special regulations as it is both a bird protection area and a Sámi cultural heritage landscape. A place where the Sámi people herd and tend to their reindeer, as they have done for thousands of years. In fact, the Sámi name for Stekenjokk is ‘Stihken’, meaning “the place where reindeer stay”. Here, reindeers graze undisturbed, so visitors must take care not to approach them, especially during the calving season in spring and early summer.\n\nSámi church towns along the Wilderness Road\n\nThe Wilderness Road region is home to culturally important Sámi landmarks like Ankarede church town (Ankarede kyrkstad) – visit the traditional Sámi ‘goahti’ huts here and a chapel dating back to the 1800s. Towards Vilhelmina, enjoy a stopover at Lake Kultsjön and walk over the footbridge to Fatmomakke church town (Faepmi in Sámi). Dating back to the 1700s, Fatmomakke is considered to be the most prominent Sámi church town in Sweden.\n\nVilhelmina church town and Nordic delicacies\n\nAnother must-visit on the Wilderness route is Vilhelmina church town (kyrkstad in Swedish) and museum – open a few short weeks in summer, you can also pick up Sámi handicraft in the museum shop. You can even bed down in one of the picturesque cabins from the 1800s, run by Vilhelmina kyrkstad’s STF youth hostel.\n\nBefore you hit the road again, drop by the well-known farm shop and restaurant Bergmans Fisk & Vilt. Famous for their award-winning, hand-smoked fish, Bergmans also offers a selection of artisan foods including wood-smoked elk and reindeer specialties. Enjoy lunch in the timber lodge or pack a picnic for your next stopover on the Wilderness Road.\n\nWherever you decide to stop next, touring the Wilderness Road is a rare opportunity to explore some of Sweden’s most remote landscapes on four wheels. So, tap into your wanderlust and enjoy the drive of your life in northern Sweden!"
