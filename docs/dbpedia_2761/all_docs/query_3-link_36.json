        "text": "Building relationships between diverse stakeholders is an important element in reducing potential land and resource use conflicts. Recently, researchers from Sweden and Canada undertook a social network analysis of stakeholder interaction and relationships amongst selected renewable resource uses both within and adjacent to a Model Forest. Their research outlines the impact and benefits of a Model Forest approach where stakeholders have been engaged in a voluntary social network.\n\nTwo neighbouring Swedish municipalities were chosen to investigate levels of cooperation among the multi-use sectors – Vilhelmina and Storuman. The area of Vilhelmina municipality is also the area of the Vilhelmina Model Forest which joined the International Model Forest Network in 2004. Storuman does not have such a specific formal cooperation structure in place, beyond what is common in a rural forest municipality in the area.\n\nWhile the quality of the many interactions between and among sectors was largely described as neutral or positive in both municipalities, the researchers discovered that membership in the Model Forest could provide Vilhelmina a larger network.\n\nTheir study found that “the Vilhelmina Model Forest plays a specific role in that it aims to provide a forum for discussion and local engagement on forest use, and in that to interact with and support cooperation among various forest users. The Model Forest thus interacts with several sectors: forestry, authorities, nature conservation, and others.”"
