details\n\nUlrika Lindholm (1886-1977) was one of Swedenâs great traditional singers. When she was “discovered” by Swedish Radio in the 1950âs she had a repertoire of more than 350 songs, most of them learned in her early years at the end of the 19th century in the small mountain village of RaukasjÃ¶ in the district of Frostviken in northern JÃ¤mtland. It is remarkable that there was so much song and music in such a remote area, but visitors were frequent, since the village was on a main road between Norway and Sweden. The farms of RaukasjÃ¶ were natural meeting-places for pedlars and other travellers, as well as neighbouring Sami. Ulrika learned all kinds of songs there—humorous ditties, childrenâs songs, musical games, drinking songs, a few bawdy ones, broadside ballads and religious songs. After many moves that took her all the way from RaukasjÃ¶ to Enskede, south of Stockholm, she still kept alive her songs and her knowledge of old JÃ¤mtland culture and traditions. She continued to sing often, though to some extent she now put her songs to new use. She sent contributions to Swedish Radioâs great folk song competition, and in June 1952 Matts Arnberg did the first recording of a selection of her songs. There were to be many more recording sessions in the studio. Most of them took place from 1958 onwards. By that time Ulrika was 70 years old, but her voice was still powerful and vigorous. These recordings have been an inspiration ever since, but this is the first time a whole production has been devoted to Ulrika Lindholm, featuring songs she learned during her childhood in JÃ¤mtland. It seems perfectly fitting that the task is being undertaken by her JÃ¤mtland successors Triakel. Iâm sure it would have pleased Ulrika Lindholm to hear the result.\n\nChristina Mattsson, Director of Nordiska museet\n\nRecorded, mixed and produced by Gustav Hylen at Home Studio Revsund, 2010;\n\nMastered at CRP Recording;\n\nPhoto by Karin Alfredsson;\n\nDesign by Pelle Rumert, Syre ReklambyrÃ¥\n\nMusicians\n\nEmma HÃ¤rdelin: vocals, fiddle;\n\nJanne StrÃ¶mstedt: harmonium;\n\nKjell-Erik Eriksson: fiddle\n\nwith\n\nLars Ericsson: bass [2];\n\nMattias Warg: vocals [5];\n\nBodÃ¶oktetten: vocals [13];\n\nUlrika Lindholm: vocals [15]\n\nTracks\n\nUti Friska GrÃ¤set GrÃ¶na (2.13)\n\nSara (2.32)\n\nDryckesvisa (1.49)\n\nBrÃ¤nnvinet (3.42)\n\nKrÃ¥kvisa (2.24)\n\nKarna (2.53)\n\nStina (3.01)\n\nVisa frÃ¥n RaukasjÃ¶ (3.51)\n\nPolska efter Fredrik Andersson, RaukasjÃ¶ (2.09)\n\nNaktergalen (2.51)\n\nDe Unga JÃ¤ntorna (2.15)\n\nKallt VÃ¤der (4.35)\n\nFilligutten (2.48)\n\nVÃ¤ckelsevisa (3.06)\n\nUlrika Lindholm: Just pÃ¥ timman 24 (1960) (1.56)\n\nTracks 1-14 trad.;\n\nTrack 15 Zacharias Topelius\n\n> Folk Music > Records > Triakel: Thyra\n\nTriakel: Thyra\n\nThyra\n\nTriakel\n\nWestpark Music 87268 (CD, Germany, 31 March 2014)\n\nalbum details â¼ show all details â² hide all details\n\nThyra Karlsson (1912-2001) from AlanÃ¤s is one of the major figures in traditional singing in JÃ¤mtland and Sweden. Her dream was to make a record, so that the songs she sang could be passed on to future generations. It didnât come true till many years later. Thyraâs daughter has put out a CD of recordings from the archives [Thyra Karlsson: SÃ¥ngarportrÃ¤tt], and now Triakel present their favourite songs in their album Thyra. Itâs a personal selection out of the hundreds of traditional songs collected from her singing by the Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research in Stockholm. They include Lantflickans klagan (A Country Girlâs Lament), Var blommar fridens stÃ¤ngel (The Stem of Serenity), and Tusen Tankar (A Thousand Thoughts)—a miscellany of songs of love, longing and sorrow—all performed in the unmistakeable spirit that Triakel has created in the course of eighteen years of work with the combined forces of harmonium, fiddle and song. Quiet, passionate music.\n\nThyraâs songs have been Triakelâs constant companions over the years, and her sorrowful version of Tusen Tankar has become a kind of signature tune for the band. Triakelâs recording has spread this song to the repertoire of a great many other artists, including one of the greatest string quartets in the world, the Kronos Quartet.\n\nOn their previous record Triakel devoted themselves to the older tradition of Ulrika Lindholm. Thyra Karlssonâs songs have a more modern feel to them, and are often marked by the dark passion and deep sadness that have become Triakelâs trademark.\n\nProduced by Gustav HylÃ©n;\n\nRecorded and mixed at Home Studio Revsund;\n\nMastered by Sofia Von Hage, Stockholm Mastering;\n\nPhoto by Karin Alfredsson;\n\nDesign by Pelle Rumert, Syre ReklambyrÃ¥\n\nMusicians\n\nEmma HÃ¤rdelin: vocals, fiddle;\n\nJanne StrÃ¶mstedt: harmonium;\n\nKjell-Erik Eriksson: fiddle\n\nwith\n\nThyra Karlsson: vocals [15]\n\nTracks\n\nLillade Anna (3.11)\n\nKom blicka in pÃ¥ en kyrkogÃ¥rd (3.00)\n\nSparvens visa (3.09)\n\nGubben och gumman (3.23)\n\nOm jag en gÃ¥ng skall ha en man (2.01)\n\nTusen tankar (4.03)\n\nSkolsÃ¥ng (2.49)\n\nMed tÃ¥rar (3.33)\n\nAmerikaresan (2.56)\n\nLantflickans klagan (4.42)\n\nHerr Peder (2.38)\n\nVar blommar fridens stÃ¤ngel (3.08)\n\nSkomakarvisa (2.44)\n\nStjÃ¤rnorna blinka (4.39)\n\nThyra Karlsson—HjÃ¤ltevisa vid fem Ã¥r (2.40)\n\nTracks 1-14 trad.;\n\nTrack 15 Zacharias Topelius\n\n> Folk Music > Records > Triakel: HÃ¤ndelser i Nord\n\nTriakel: HÃ¤ndelser i Nord\n\nHÃ¤ndelser i Nord\n\nTriakel\n\nWestpark Music 87382 (CD, Germany, 26 April 2019)\n\nalbum details â¼ show all details â² hide all details\n\nThis album is a story about disasters, crime and death in Norrland.
