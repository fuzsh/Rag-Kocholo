        "text": "Parties in the case are Vilhelmina Södra Sami village versus the County Administrative Board of Västerbotten County and Vilhelmina Mineral AB. The case concerns an appeal of the County Board of Västerbotten County's decision 2022-06-02, dnr 521-7466-2020, for mining operations within the Natura 2000 area Vardo-, Laster- and Fjällfjällen, Vilhelmina municipality. The appeal from Vilhelmina Södra Sami village was received by the court on July 8, 2022. Since then, Vilhelmina Södra Sami village has been granted additional time to supplement appeal on three occasions, the latest of which with deadline October 20, 2022.\n\nThe Land and Environmental Court has today announced that Vilhelmina Södra Sami village has chosen to withdraw the appeal. The Company assesses that the court will soon dismiss the case from further processing. Such a decision, however, becomes legally binding only after three weeks from the decision, after which processing of the case would be completed.\n\n____________\n\nStockholm, October 2022\n\nBluelake Mineral AB (publ)\n\nThe Board of Directors\n\nPublication of information\n\nThis information is inside information which Bluelake Mineral AB (pull) is required to publish in accordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation. The information was submitted, for publication on October 10, 2022, at 15.45 CET, by the contact person below.\n\nGeneral information about the Company\n\nBluelake Mineral AB (public) is an independent Swedish company active in exploration and mine development of copper, zinc, nickel and gold resources.\n\nThe Company owns approximately 99% of the subsidiary Vilhelmina Mineral AB, which is focusing on development of copper and zinc deposits in the Nordic region. In Sweden, the Company owns Stekenjokk-Levi project, where a total of approximately 7 million tonnes of ore were mined between 1976 and 1988 with an average grade 1.5% Cu and 3.5% Zn. Stekenjokk-Levi is, according to a recent Mineral Resource Estimate by SRK Consulting, containing inferred mineral resources of approximately 6.7 million tonnes with 0.9 % Cu, 2.7 % Zn, 0.6 % Pb, 55 Ag g/t and 0.2 g/t Au for Stekenjokk and inferred mineral resources of 5.1 million tonnes with 1.0 % Cu, 1.5 % Zn, 0.1 % Pb, 22 Ag g/t and 0.2 g/t Au for Levi (at a NSR cut-off of 60 USD/t). In Norway, the Company is owner of Joma Gruver AS which holds exploitation rights for the Joma field, where approximately 11.5 million tonnes of ore were processed between 1972 and 1998 with an average grade of 1.5% Cu and 1.5% Zn. The Joma field (excluding Gjersvik) is, according to a recent mineral estimate by SRK Consulting, containing indicated mineral resources of approximately 6 million tonnes with grades amounting to 1.00 % Cu and 1.66 % Zn and inferred resources of 1.2 million tonnes with grades 1.2 % Cu and 0.7 % Zn (at cut-off of 50 USD/t).\n\nIn addition, the Company holds exploitation concessions for the nickel project Rönnbäcken (which is Europe's largest known undeveloped nickel resource) and an exploration permit for Orrbäcken, both which are located in Sweden. According to a recently updated mineral resource update in by the mining consulting company SRK, the Rönnbäcken project contains a mineral resource of 600 million tonnes with an average grade of 0.18% Ni, 0.003% Co and 5.7% Fe (\"measured and indicated\"). The updated preliminary economic assessment that SRK completed predicts a production of 23,000 tonnes of nickel, 660 tonnes of cobalt and 1.5 million tonnes of iron per year for 20 years, which would be a significant share of Sweden's total annual use of nickel which thereby has a strategic value. Orrbäcken is considered to have potential as a nickel deposit.\n\nFurther, the Company holds an exploration permit for Kattisavan which is considered to have potential as a gold resource and is located within the so-called gold line, close to projects such as Svartliden, Fäboliden and Barsele."
