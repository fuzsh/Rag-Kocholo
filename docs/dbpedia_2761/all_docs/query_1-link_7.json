        "text": "In a nutshell\n\nDuring the past few decades, there has been intense discussion as to which forestry practices should be used in the western parts of Vilhelmina Municipality. Conflict over how to manage the Blaikfjället and Njakafjäll areas specifically received substantial public interest during the 1980s and 1990s. The main land-owner, Vilhelmina Municipality, had planned harvesting operations in the old-growth forests of Njakafjäll, but these operations were strongly opposed by environmental organizations. In the end, both areas became nature reserves.\n\nDominating discussions today are issues related to environmental sustainability and land access rights for indigenous migrant reindeer herders vis-à-vis forest practices. Environmental adaptation of hydro power production in the catchment area of the river Ångermanälven is the main focus of practical work in the Model Forest landscape.\n\nLandscape\n\nThe land-base in Vilhelmina is in the transition area from boreal to alpine zones. The area is a typical coniferous-dominated landscape of inland northern Sweden. It is variable in its topography, from about 340 meters above sea level up to 1000 meters. There is a great variety of natural habitats and degree of disturbance by forestry. Some 350,000 hectares are productive forestland, dominated by mature forests (80 years or more). The amount of old forests increases going westward, as does the proportion of forests with high natural values. The most common tree species are spruce, pine and birch.\n\nAbout half of the people who live in Vilhelmina municipality own some forest property. Around 100 Sami people are organized in indigenous reindeer herding communities.\n\nForestry is an important component of Vilhelmina’s economy. More than 100 people are employed as truck drivers or have other forestry-related occupations. For the informal economy and cultural heritage of the community, as well as for the well-being of the citizens, the forest is of vital importance for supporting hunting, berry picking, fishing and recreational activities.\n\nPartnership\n\nVilhelmina municipality is the head organization of the Model Forest.\n\nMembers of the Model Forest steering committee include:\n\nNational government (State Forest Agency);\n\nIndigenous peoples (Sami nation);\n\nMunicipality of Vilhelmina;\n\nAcademia and research institutions;\n\nPrivate forest owners;\n\nPrivate forest companies;\n\nSchools;\n\nTourism organizations;\n\nLocal entrepreneurs;\n\nRepresentatives from organizations engaged in water related issues.\n\nSustainability\n\nStrategic goals:\n\nTo increase knowledge and improve decision making for the use of the different values of the landscape through cooperation and practical efforts;\n\nTo support research for the concrete development of sustainable use of the landscape and its different values;\n\nTo work to secure local support and local exchange of all current activities within and linked to Vilhelmina Model Forest;\n\nTo increase exchanges with other Model Forests and similar initiatives, both nationally and internationally.\n\nKey actions in place to reach these goals:\n\nCreation of thematic groups working on water and climate issues, alternative forestry methods and social values of the forest;\n\nBuilding of stakeholder capacity through the development and participation in networking activities;\n\nRiver restoration activities;\n\nEstablishment and development of demonstration sites;\n\nResearch activities within and about the Model Forest landscape;\n\nStrengthen partnerships and participate in exchanges between the Model Forests in Sweden and the seven participating sites in the Baltic Sea Region;\n\nRelease of a periodic newsletter to share knowledge, lessons learned and information about ongoing work.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2017 Vilhelmina Model Forest took part in a number of projects, e.g.:\n\nBaltic Landscape;\n\nPLURAL;\n\nIntegral;\n\nArange.\n\nWithin the projects, collaborations were developed on different topics and between different actors such as researchers, Vilhelmina municipality, NGO’s and citizens.\n\nKey impacts:\n\nUse of the demonstration sites at excursions and thematic programs;\n\nContinued theoretical and practical work with the river Ångermanälven;\n\nThe formation of a nature reserve highlighting social values of the forest;\n\nCo-operation between the municipality and researchers in the development of municipal comprehensive planning through an extended landscape perspective and an improved participation process.\n\nLearn more about Vilhelmina Model Forest\n\nArticle: Participatory GIS to mitigate conflicts between reindeer husbandry and forestry in Vilhelmina Model Forest, Sweden\n\nArticle: Sustainable Landscape Management in the Vilhelmina Model Forest, Sweden\n\nIMFN News: An Interview with Anna-Maria Fjellström, president, Vilhelmina Model Forest, Sweden\n\nIMFN News: Research shows Model Forest effectively connects stakeholders\n\nAward: Vilhelmina Model Forest received the Governor General´s Medallion.\n\nVideo: Vilhelmina Model Forest (2013) (in Swedish)\n\nVideo: Baltic Landscape in change – Vilhelmina Model Forest"
