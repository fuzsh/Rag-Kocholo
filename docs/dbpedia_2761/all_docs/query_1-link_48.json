        "text": "Just down the hill from the church is a collection of old buildings known as a kyrkstad – church town. These were used to house visitors who had travelled long distances in order to take part in religious festivals, visit markets etc. Vilhelmina has two of these “towns”, the other is located in Fatmomakke. Today the now-renovated buildings house Sami handcrafts, small shops, a handicraft workshop and a gallery. By visiting the local heritage museum you can discover what it was like to live in one of these towns.\n\nOther available activities include: cycling, hiking and fishing trips on ATVs (All Terrain Vehicles) and if you come during the second week, you can take your pick from the packed programme of concerts and cultural events and the historical market which go to make up the Nybyggarvecka (Pioneer Week) celebration.\n\nActivities\n\nThe Sagavägen road runs alongside the Vilhemina Municipality’s two main rivers, Ångermanälven and Vojmån. Follow this road and journey you take you past Meselefors, Rönnäs, Stalon and Gränssjöarna, each with its own particular history and character. Dikanäs is the little village with a big summer programme. Try your hand at baking traditional flat bread, carve your own wooden cup, hike along one of the many trails and pathways or visit the Motorcyle Museum which has a fascinating collection of veteran bikes. In Henriksfjäll is another museum which is home to a collection of recordings describing what life was like here in the not too distant past. One of the sites that you must not miss is the Sami kyrkstad (church town) of Fatmomakke, which dates from the 1600s and contains over 80 Sami huts and 20 pioneer cabins.\n\nUnbelievably tasty!\n\nKlimpfjäll in Vilhelmina is Sweden’s tastiest centre – official. Millions watched in 2013 as, mentored by a professional renowned chef, three amateurs from Klimpfjäll cooked their way to victory against others similarly mentored from towns across the country in a national television show. Locals, however, are not surprised at their success as they’re proud of the fact that it already has many award-winning producers who use local ingredients to create mouth-watering food. Helens Gårdsbutik, Pralineriet, EG:s Vilt and Samiska apoteket are just a few who lead the way. If you are visiting, you must not miss the opportunity to call in at Martin Bergman’s Vilhelmina Gårdsbutik where you should try the SM-tallriken, a dish containing the 5 award winning creations. Delicious!"
