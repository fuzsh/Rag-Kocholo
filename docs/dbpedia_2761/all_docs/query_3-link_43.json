        "text": "Type of fishing\n\nThere are excellent fishing waters here for perch and pike. You can also fish for trout, grayling, whitefish, burbot and roach. During the high season from June to September, almost no fishing trip goes without a rich catch. It is not uncommon to catch a perch larger than 40 centimeters or a pike larger than 100 centimeters!\n\nUpper Ångermanälven KFO\n\nThe “Övere Ångermanälven” fishing area stretches for 65 kilometers from the Volgsjöfors dam to the center of Åsele. A 20-minute drive along the river, and you will find a fantastic place to fish for large trout. The place is called “Stenkulla” and is located below the Stenkulla-power station. Stenkulla offers a good stock of grayling, trout, perch and pike.\n\nNOTE: special rules at Stenkulla!\n\nFly fishing\n\nThere are also great opportunities for fly fishing in the area. Vojmån flows into the lake in Vilhelmina. Just a few kilometers further north, are some excellent areas for fly fishing.\n\nMore information\n\nWe offer fishing permits, boat rentals and guided tours.\n\nFor more detailed information on rules, restrictions, restricted routes and more, please contact the campsite or visit the websites linked below.\n\nGood luck fishing!"
