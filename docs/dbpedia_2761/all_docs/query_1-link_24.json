        "text": "The World's Quietest Airport?\n\nOnce you've landed with us and the airplane engine has stopped, the silence is total. The mountain rises nearby. Perhaps you hear a bird or the wind. Many are captivated by the wild, beautiful surroundings. South Lapland (the municipalities of Vilhelmina, Dorotea, Åsele, and Strömsund) is as large as Belgium in area but with only 25,000 inhabitants. Here are deep primeval forests, 10,000 lakes, and 150 peaks that rise more than 1000 meters above sea level. The area encompasses four mountain regions with lifts, a rich culture, and 400 miles of snowmobile trails. There are discoveries for all temperaments."
