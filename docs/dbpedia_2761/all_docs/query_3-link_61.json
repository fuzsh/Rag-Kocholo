        "meta_description": "So yesterday it was time for us to take EMMAS to Vilhelmina, and all said and done we steered towards our partners at @wilhelmina_fritidsgard  Once there, 7 expectant and lovely children were waiting. But for anyone who has ever created something truly brilliant, knows that it doesn't happen on an empty stomach so the first thing we did was get some food before the big mission.  Satisfied and recharged, we went to a well-selected location and there began an intense and concentrated teamwork that resulted in a fantastic three-dimensional creation - the children's own works of art!",

        "text": "Thank you to everyone who visited us this summer, from near and far!\n\nFrom now on, it is fine to book guided tours or viewings in the museum Mondays to Thursdays during our regular working hours. See more on the website!\n\nWe wish requests for bookings at least 24 hours before to our email; info.ricklundgarden@gmail.com\n\nHold on to summer for a little while longer before we go in and embrace autumn.\n\nHave a nice week!\n\nTogether with 19 cultural schools in Västerbotten and Norrbotten, we have received over SEK 14 million to develop new forms of collaboration over a three-year period.\n\nThe project goals are about developing working methods, structures and models for inter-municipal employment and inter-regional solutions, regardless of geographical distance, as well as testing the necessary technology for this.\n\nThe overall aim of the project is to obtain increased and more equal competence among the regions’ cultural schools, regardless of municipality size and demographics, as well as to develop and test different organizational structures to make available a wider labor market for cultural school staff in rural and sparsely populated areas.\n\nIn an extension, this may also have significance for other forms of collaboration and cooperation between the municipalities in northern Sweden.\n\nEmma Ricklund’s foundation, which was the initiator and project seeker for our first big project that was financed by the Postal Code Foundation between 2022 and the end of February this year, could never have dreamed of what big rings on the water it would become.\n\nWe BELIEVED in our idea, we dared to bet but if someone had told us that two years later we would be working in yet another new project financed by the Heritage Fund (KRAM) and that we would also be one of the active activities in this large cross-regional EU project from the ESF Council and the regions, we would probably have fallen off the chair.\n\nWe are happy for everyone who wants to rejoice with us and rejoice for the cultural development that is now taking place in the mountain world, inland and throughout northern Sweden\n\nThe museum’s opening hours and information on how to book a guided tour this summer, as well as where to contact staff on site, can be found on our website;\n\nwww.ricklundgarden.com\n\nDuring the summer we can only be reached via email, the phone also has some time off.\n\nBetween 17-20 June, you as a visitor can book a guided tour between 09.00-15.00. This should then be done no later than 24 hours before:\n\ninfo.ricklundgarden@gmail.com\n\nFrom week 26, our summer opening hours apply, which you can find on our website:\n\nwww.ricklundgarden.com\n\nATTENTION!! From week 26-34, we refer EVERYONE who has questions about the museum to our special “museum email”:\n\nvisning.ricklundgarden@gmail.com\n\nThis is to reduce the risk of something ending up with someone who is on holiday or in some junk mail.\n\nNew for this summer is that on Tuesday 9 & 16 July there will be a waffle café at EMMAS between 10.00-14.00.\n\nEMMAS is located in the middle of Saxnäs, on the other side of the road opposite the store. Feel free to stop by and you’re welcome!\n\nWith that, we wish everyone a really nice summer!\n\nBig hug from Tina, Malin, Christer & Kristoffer"
