        "text": "Safe & Sound\n\nFor Your Safety Before You Book\n\nAs part of our continuous effort to protect the security and privacy of our guests, Hard Rock Hotels presents its Safe & Sound program, to prevent you or your loved ones from being victims of fraudulent practices. We would like to remind you that Hard Rock Hotels only accept card payments when making a reservation through our call center or website. We will never request a deposit or a direct transfer to a bank account, and you will never be contacted by us via SMS or WhatsApp. Please take precautions at the time of booking, and ensure all transactions are made through our official channels in order to keep your personal information secure.\n\nWhat is required upon check-in at the resort?\n\nYou will need the official ID of the person who made the reservation and a valid credit card.\n\nAt what time can I check in?\n\nThe check in time is 15:00 (3:00 PM), the checkout time is 12:00 (12:00 PM).\n\nDo you have early check in (before 3 pm)?\n\nYes, however, it is subject to availability. If you arrive early, you can go to the front desk and you will be provided with a wristband that gives you access to hotel grounds and restaurants. Our staff will safeguard your luggage so you can go ahead and enjoy. We will notify you when your room is ready.\n\nIs a passport or visa required to travel to your resort?\n\nYes. If you are an International traveler, you will need your passport to travel and check-in at the hotel.\n\nIf I arrive in the early morning, is there anyone to assist me?\n\nYes, our staff is available and ready to assist you 24 hours, seven days a week.\n\nWhy is there a mandatory $100 USD hold per night on my credit card for the reservation?\n\nWe require a mandatory hold of $100 USD per night per reservation on a credit card for incidental expenses and any potential additional charges that may occur during your stay. This hold is a standard procedure and is used to ensure that any incidentals, such as room service, dining, or damages, can be covered conveniently without the need for immediate payment at check-out.\n\nWill this hold affect my credit card limit?\n\nWhile the hold is placed on your credit card, the funds are not actually charged. Instead, the amount is temporarily reserved, which might affect your available credit limit until the hold is released after check-out. The release process varies by bank, and typically, the hold is lifted within a few business days after your departure.\n\nCan I use a different payment method for the hold?\n\nThe mandatory hold is specifically processed on a credit card provided at the time of reservation. We do not currently accept alternative payment methods for this hold.\n\nWhat if I don’t have a credit card?\n\nWe regret to inform you that a credit card is mandatory for the hold. If you don’t have a credit card in your name, we recommend contacting our reservations team to discuss alternative arrangements.\n\nWe hope this information clarifies the purpose of the mandatory credit card hold. If you have further questions or need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact us: customercare@hrhloscabos.com"
