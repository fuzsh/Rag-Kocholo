        "text": "2.1 Heterogeneous Preferences\n\nConsumers do, however, have heterogeneous preferences. This can be caused by, for example, consumer inertia (see, e.g. Coscelli 2000; Dubé, Hitsch, and Rossi 2010) or by that many consumers prefer to get exactly the product written on the prescription (Granlund and Rudholm 2012).\n\nLet us assume that the share of consumers buying the parallel imported product (m=1−qls) depends on the effort (e) employed by the pharmacy, measured in monetary terms, to convince consumers to buy the locally sourced product and assume that m′(e)<0 and that m′′(e)>0. Normalize the unit cost for e to unity and let Cls(1 – m(e)) and Cpi(m(e)) be functions describing how pharmacies’ total purchase cost for locally sourced and parallel imported products depend on m. Since both total demand and the retail prices equal 1, the pharmacy’s revenue equals 1 and its profit function can be written as\n\n[3]Ω=1−Cls1−me−Cpime−e.\n\nThe pharmacy will choose e≥0 to maximize profits. Considering that the marginal prices offered by the producer and the parallel importer are ps and ps+r, the Kuhn–Tucker conditions become\n\n[4]∂Ω∂e=−r∂m∂e−1≤0;\n\n[5]er∂m∂e+1=0.\n\nThus, the pharmacy will choose e so that m′(e) = –1/r or choose e = 0 if m′(e) ≥ –1/r (i.e. |m′(e)| ≤ 1/r) already when e = 0. If the solution is interior, it implies that the locally sourced product will not only be sold to those who without persuasion preferred that product or was indifferent between the two products, but that it will also be sold to some of the consumers that preferred the parallel imported product before coming to the pharmacy. Since m′′(e)>0, the Kuhn–Tucker conditions also reveal that, for interior solutions, the effort and hence the market share of locally sourced products is increasing in r. That is, the larger the cost advantage of the locally sourced product, and hence the larger the difference in marginal prices offered to the pharmacy, the smaller will be the market share for the parallel imported products.\n\nIt is quite reasonable that some consumers are easily persuaded by the pharmacy personnel to buy a certain product. On the other hand, some consumers have strong preference for a given product. In the data used in this paper, 11% of the consumers paying extra to get the product they preferred paid more than SEK 50 extra (approximately 6 Euros). Thus, it might seem reasonable to assume that m′(e) is initially negative enough so that the optimal e is positive, and that m′′(e) is sufficiently positive so that the market share for the parallel imported product does not become zero. Pharmacies might, however, have other instruments at its disposal that are less costly than persuasion. One obvious candidate is raising the generalized price for the parallel imported product.\n\n5.1 The Market Share for Parallel Imports\n\nThe theoretical model predicts that pharmacies after the reform will have lower marginal purchase prices for locally sourced products, and therefore have higher marginal margins on locally sourced products, since these are not sold at lower prices than parallel imported products. Before July 2009, the pharmacies’ margins were nearly the same for locally sourced and parallel imports. Therefore, in accordance with the theoretical model, the main hypothesis is that the market share for parallel imports has been reduced by the reform.\n\nThis hypothesis is tested by estimating how the reform has affected the probability that a consumer buys a parallel imported product. The reform can have affected the probability that a pharmacy has a parallel imported product in stock and/or the probability that a consumer chooses to by that product if it is in stock. The mechanisms are analyzed later, but to test the main hypothesis, the total reform effect, irrespective of its mechanism, is first estimated.\n\nThe baseline specification (specification 1) used to test the main hypothesis is\n\n[6]PrPIi=1=Fβ1Reformi+∑c=210γcChainci+β2Euroi+β3Timei+β4PI_presci+β5NotMDi+β6lnNmpi_drugi+β7Nmpi_drug_tri+β8lnNmpi_subsi+β9Nmpi_subs_tri+β10Childi+β11Agei+β12Agei2+β13Womeni+∑r=215ρrMunri+∑m=212θmCMonthmi+∑d=2218αdDrugdi+εi,\n\nwhere Munr indicates the municipality of residence of the consumer. In all specifications, observations are weighted using the average of the product prices as weight. Unless otherwise noted, prescriptions dispensed during the reform period, July 1, 2009, to February 28, 2010, were excluded and the estimations were conducted using a maximum-likelihood logit estimator where the error terms (εi) were allowed to be heteroskedastic and correlated within months.\n\nThe reform indicator captures the reform effect for the pharmacies that Apoteket AB continued to own. The indicators for the other pharmacy categories (Chainc) are included to study differences between the private pharmacies and the government-owned Apoteket AB. Note that Chainc is identical with interaction terms between Chainc and the reform indicator since Apoteket AB was the only pharmacy chain before the reform. Therefore, the effects of other pharmacy categories are considered to be part of the total reform effect.\n\nI control for the Euro exchange rate since many parallel importers have a large part of their transportation and repacking costs in Euros and since possible margins of wholesalers in source countries in most cases are in Euros. When Euro takes a high value (i.e. the Swedish currency is weak), parallel traders’ expenses measured in Swedish Kronas will increase. Therefore, they will find it less profitable to import to Sweden and, according to the theoretical model, charge a higher marginal price if they import. Because of both these mechanisms, a negative effect of Euro is expected.\n\nTime controls for a linear time trend in the probability that a parallel imported product is dispensed. I control for if a parallel imported product is prescribed (PI_presc) since some consumers prefer to get exactly what is prescribed. NotMD is included since the consumers’ attitude toward substitution might depend on perceptions about the prescriber’s ability to evaluate different pharmaceutical treatments.\n\nThe variables lnNmpi_drug, Nmpi_drug_tr, lnNmpi_subs and Nmpi_subs_tr are included since the results of Mott and Cline (2002) and Ching (2010) indicate that the time a product has been available has a positive effect on the probability that it is bought. Note that since the natural logarithm of 1 is 0, none of these variables changes value the first time a parallel import is bought, which means that there is no risk of within-observation endogeneity.\n\nThe variables describing the consumer’s age, gender and municipality of residence are included to control for differences in consumer mix across pharmacy categories. I control for the calendar month the prescription was dispensed because the first 6 calendar months are overrepresented before the reform (because the rules were changed in July and not in January). The drug-specific fixed effects control for time-invariant differences between the drugs. This includes difference in the severity of the conditions the drug is prescribed against, which might affect that probability that consumers accept a parallel import. The drug-specific effects also partly control for the variation in quantities sold and price differences for locally sourced products between Sweden and other countries in the European Economic Area, which affects the probability that products are parallel imported.\n\nI do not control directly for the relative consumer prices of locally sourced and parallel imported alternatives, since when a locally sourced product is dispensed one cannot know which parallel imported alternatives were available at the pharmacy and the prices of these. Another reason is that the relative prices are affected by the reform and, therefore, cannot be included as an exogenous explanatory variable. The relative prices that are available do not indicate any important changes over time apart from what can be controlled for by the linear time trend and that caused by the reform, which suggests that not controlling for relative prices does not bias the estimators.\n\nThe results of specification 1 and three alternative specifications are presented in Table 3. In specification 2, prescriptions dispensed between July 2009 and March 2010 are included, as well as the indicator variable March2010. In specifications 3 and 4, the populations are restricted to prescriptions of only locally sourced and only parallel imported products, respectively. Key results from other specifications used for robustness analyses are presented and discussed in Appendix C.\n\nTable 3:\n\n1. Baseline2. No window3. LS is presc.4.

For specification 1, estimates for calendar month and municipalities are reported in Table 5 in Appendix A. Corresponding estimates for other specifications as well as parameter estimates for the drug-specific fixed effects are available from the author upon request.\n\nThe estimation results for Reform (top of Table 3) show the reform effect for the government-owned Apoteket AB, while the estimates for the nine pharmacy categories (Apoteksgruppen-Others) show how the reform effects for these nine categories differ from that of Apoteket AB. Total reform effect (bottom of the table) is the weighted average of the reform effects over all pharmacy categories, using their market shares after March 2010 as weights (see Table 2).\n\nThe results for specification 1 show that the reform reduced the market shares for parallel imports at pharmacies owed by Apoteket AB by 11.3 percentage points. The reform effect is about 2 percentage points larger in absolute size for Kronans Droghandel, while it is 5–6 percentage points smaller for Apoteket Hjärtat. The point estimates for the total reform effect over all pharmacy chains is –10.5 percentage points. As shown in Appendix C, these results are quite robust; for example, the estimated total reform effects presented in Table 7 are all between –13 and –8 percentage points. Thus, the results support the main hypothesis that the reform has reduced the market share for parallel imports. The reduction is quite large considering that the predicted market share for parallel imports if the reform had not taken place was 42% according to specification 1.\n\nThe estimates for the nine pharmacy categories reveal that there are significant differences across pharmacies. Except the private pharmacy in Norsjö, all pharmacy categories are, according to the point estimates, less likely to sell parallel imports than Apoteket AB would have been without the reform, but the differences are not significant for Apoteksgruppen, DocMorris and Malå private. The estimate for Apoteket Farmaci AB is likely affected by selection, since this company only operates hospital pharmacies; the large negative estimate for this group can reflect that consumers who buy drugs in connection to hospital visits are less inclined to buy parallel imported products. For the other pharmacy categories, the drug-specific fixed effects and the demographic variables, including the municipality dummies, likely control for most of the selection of consumers.\n\nSpecification 2 reveals that the full effect of the reform did not come in July 2009. Instead, the results of specification 2 suggest that about half the estimated reform effect came around July 2009, while the rest came later. Results presented in Table 8 in Appendix C indicate that pharmacies might also have started to adjust to the new rules before July 2009.\n\nThe results of specifications 3 and 4 show that the reform effects are of similar absolute size irrespective of whether the prescription is for a locally sourced or a parallel imported product. On the other hand, in relative terms, the reform effect is much larger for prescription of locally sourced products since the predicted market share for parallel imports in this subpopulation if the reform had not taken place is 29%, while it is 83% for prescriptions for parallel imports.\n\nLooking on the results for the control variables, we see, as expected, that the market share for parallel imports is significantly reduced by a depreciation of the Swedish Krona against the Euro. There is, however, no significant time trend. Consumers are far more likely to buy a parallel import if a parallel imported product is prescribed, which is consistent with the result of Granlund and Rudholm (2012), showing that what the physician has written on the prescription has a significant effect on consumers’ choices between medically equivalent pharmaceuticals.\n\nIf the prescriber is not a medical doctor, this reduces the likeliness that a parallel import is bought. Specifications 2 and 3 suggest that this is primarily caused by the effect NotMD has when parallel imports are prescribed. The estimates for the four variables controlling for the number of months parallel imported products have been available are consistent with the results of Mott and Cline (2002) and Ching (2010), which showed that the time a product of a drug has been available has a positive effect on the probability that it is bought. The only exception is the negative estimate for lnNmpi_subs in specification 4.\n\nThe coefficient estimates (not reported) for Age and Age2 from specification 1 reveal that age, up to an age of 62, has a positive influence on the probability that a parallel import is bought. For higher ages, the effect is reversed. The estimates for Child show that children are even less likely to get a parallel imported product than what is predicted by their young age according to the estimates for Age and Age2. Women are, ceteris paribus, less likely to buy a parallel imported product, and specifications 3 and 4 suggest that this is explained by that women are less inclined to switch product when a locally sourced product is prescribed.\n\nThe descriptive statistics in Figure 1 show that the market share for parallel imported products has increased considerably after the reform: from 25% in June 2009 (the last month before the reform) to 46% in December 2011 (the last month in the study period). That the estimated total reform effect still is significantly negative is mainly explained by the depreciation of the Euro against the Swedish Krona: Euro was reduced from nearly 11 in June 2009 to 9 in December 2011. Simulations based on specification 1 suggest that this should have increased the market share for parallel imports by 13 percentage points. Similarly, the increases in the variables lnNmpi_drug, Nmpi_drug_tr, lnNmpi_subs and Nmpi_subs_tr are predicted to have increased the market share by 10 percentage points, of which the increase in lnNmpi_drug accounts for 8 percentage points. Other important control variables explaining the increase in the market share for parallel imports between June 2009 and December 2012 is the calendar month dummies (5 percentage points) and PI_presc (3 percentage points).\n\n5.2 The Probability That Consumers Can Choose a Cheaper Parallel Imported Product and the Probability That They Still Choose a Locally Sourced Product\n\nA second hypothesis is that the pharmacy reform has reduced the probability that pharmacies offer consumers to buy cheaper parallel imported products instead of locally sourced ones. This hypothesis is based on the theoretical prediction that pharmacies, because of the reform, will want to have higher generalized prices on parallel imports than on locally sourced products. Higher generalized prices can be accomplished by making parallel traders increase their list prices and by not keeping parallel imports in stock.\n\nThe second hypothesis is tested by estimating the probability of Choice as a function of the same explanatory variables as in specification 1, and the results are presented in Table 4. The hypothesis is tested separately depending on whether the prescriptions are for a locally sourced product (specification 5) or for parallel imported products (specification 6).\n\nTable 4:\n\n5 Choice6 Choice7 Demand LS8 Demand LSLS is presc.PI is presc.LS is presc.PI is presc.Reform−10.10***−3.580.813.84***(3.46)(4.40)(1.87)(1.35)A.

This is tested by estimating the probability of Demand LS as a function of the same explanatory variables as in specification 1 but only for observation where consumers had a choice. Also this is tested separately depending on whether the prescriptions are for a locally sourced product (specification 7) or for parallel imported products (specification 8).\n\nAs predicted by the theoretical model, the results in Table 4 show that the reform has reduced the probability that a consumer who was prescribed a locally sourced product was offered a cheaper parallel imported substitute. On the other hand, for consumers who were prescribed parallel imported products, the reform’s negative effect on the probability that they are able to buy parallel imported products that are cheaper than the locally sourced products is not statistically significant. A possible explanation is that the reform mostly has affected the probability that pharmacies keep parallel imported products that are seldom prescribed in stock, since it can create bad will among consumers not to have the product they are prescribed in stock.\n\nLooking at the estimate for Total reform effect from specification 7, we see that consumers across all pharmacies did not become more likely to reject to substitute a prescribed locally sourced product for a cheaper parallel imported alternative. That is, we see no evidence for that the increase in market share for locally sourced product when such products are prescribed is explained by that pharmacies because of the reform are more likely to persuade consumers to buy locally sourced products.\n\nThe results from specification 8 show that the reform has increased the probability that consumers who are prescribed parallel imported products pay extra to instead get a locally sourced product. One interpretation is that pharmacy personnel because of the reform have become more likely to tell consumers that they have the right to buy other substitutes than the prescribed product or the cheapest available substitute.\n\nTo summarize, the results of specifications 5–8 indicate that pharmacies primarily have reduced the market share for parallel imports by less often offer consumers to buy cheaper parallel imported products. The mechanism suggested by Brekke, Holmås, and Straume (2013) for off-patent drugs in Norway – that pharmacies persuade consumers to buy products that pharmacies have higher margins on, are less important on this market. Table 9 in Appendix C shows that the main results from specifications 5–8 are not sensitive toward excluding all observations where a parallel imported product with unknown relative price is dispensed.\n\nWe see that the estimated reform effects from specifications 6 and 8 together only can explain a part of the estimated reform effect from specification 4 (i.e. for prescriptions of parallel imported products). The same is true for prescriptions of locally sourced products: the estimated reform effects from specifications 5 and 7 do not explain the entire reform effect according to specification 3, even though the result from specification 5 explains a large part. The main reason is that the reform also has affected the probability that consumers buy a parallel imported product that is not cheaper than the locally sourced product. The data do not reveal if consumers who bought a locally sourced product had the opportunity to buy an equally expensive parallel imported product, which means that it is not possible to analyze the mechanism through which the reform reduced the probability that consumers buy parallel imported products that are not cheaper than their locally sourced alternatives.\n\nThe results above are consistent with the theoretical prediction that when pharmacies can negotiate purchase prices, the marginal purchase prices become lower for locally sourced products than for parallel imports. In other words, the producers give larger marginal discounts than given by parallel traders. Another question is if parallel traders at all give discounts. According to the theoretical model, this is expected if the pharmacies’ maximum purchase price for parallel imports exceeds ps+r. Results presented and discussed in Appendix D indicate that the reform has significantly increased the probability that pharmacies only sell product from one parallel trader for each drug. These results are obtained after controlling for the quantity of parallel imports sold and are consistent with that pharmacies negotiate prices also with parallel traders and, for each drug, only sell the product from the parallel trader who offered them the best deal."
