        "text": "Comparison of self-reported height and weight with controlled height and weight in women and men.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchlichting, P; HÃ¸ilund-Carlsen, P F; Quaade, F\n\n1981-01-01\n\nSelf-reported height and weight were compared with directly-measured controlled height and weight in 158 women with a median age of 34 years (16-62 years) and in 594 men with a median age of 37 (16-66 years). A model of two one-dimensional linear regressions with two independent variables was used in order to describe the combined influence of both controlled height and controlled weight on self-reported height and on self-reported weight. For both sexes there was a systematic tendency for tall and heavy persons to underestimate their height and weight and conversely for small and thin persons to overestimate these measurements. The influence of controlled weight on self-reported height was statistically significant (women: P less than 0.05; men: P approximately 0.05,) and so was the influence of controlled height on self-reported weight (women: P less than 0.002; men: P less than 0.001). The reported heights and weights of women and men converged towards a pair of desired measures for each sex, ie the values of height and weight for which the reported and the controlled values were identical. For women the desired measures were 159.6 cm and 45.2 kg, for men 176.7 cm and 68.9 kg. The demonstrated differences between self-reported and controlled body measures may invalidate data and conclusions of insurance studies and population surveys based on self-reported measures.\n\nSelf-reported versus measured height and weight in Hispanic and non-Hispanic menopausal women.\n\nPubMed\n\nGriebeler, Marcio L; Levis, Silvina; Beringer, Laura MuÃ±oz; Chacra, Walid; GÃ³mez-MarÃ­n, Orlando\n\n2011-04-01\n\nHeight and weight information is commonly used in clinical trials and in making therapeutic decisions in medical practice. In both settings, the data are often obtained by self-report. If erroneous, this practice could lead to inaccuracies in estimating renal function and medication doses or to inaccurate outcomes of research studies. Previous publications have reported lack of reliability of self-reported weight and height in the general population but have not addressed age-specific and ethnicity-specific subgroups in the U.S. population. The inaccuracy of self-reported weight and height could be particularly significant in times of considerable changes in body weight, such as at menopause, which is often associated with weight gain. We assessed the validity of self-reported height and weight in 428 women within the first 5 years of menopause, 70.6% of whom were Hispanic. Participants overestimated their height by 2.2Â±3.5âcm (meanÂ±standard deviation [SD]) and underestimated their weight by 1.5Â±2.9âkg. As a group, based on self-reported measures, 33.3% were misclassified with respect to body mass index (BMI) category, and the difference between measured BMI and self-reported BMI was similar between Hispanic white and non-Hispanic white women, positively related to measured weight, and inversely related to measured height, years from menopause, and multiple parity. From the public health perspective, inaccurate self-report could lead to a considerable underestimation of the current obesity prevalence rates. In our study population, the prevalence of obesity (BMI â¥30âkg/m(2)) was 6.3% based on self-reported values and 18% based on measured height and weight, representing a 3-fold underestimation.\n\nSelf-Reported Versus Measured Height and Weight in Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Menopausal Women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGriebeler, Marcio L.; Beringer, Laura MuÃ±oz; Chacra, Walid; GÃ³mez-MarÃ­n, Orlando\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAbstract Background Height and weight information is commonly used in clinical trials and in making therapeutic decisions in medical practice.

Participants (N = 1,686) were 77% white, 62% female, aged 18-24 years (mean Â± SD, 19.1 Â± 1.1 years), and enrolled at 8 US universities. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for self-report (via online survey); trained researchers measured height and weight and categorized them as normal (18.5 to < 25), overweight (25 to < 30), obese (30 to < 35), and morbidly obese (â¥ 35). Concordance of self-report vs objectively measured BMI groups using chi-square revealed that 93% were accurate, 4% were underestimated, and 2.7% were overestimated. Pearson correlations and adjusted linear regression revealed significant associations between self-report and measured BMI (r = .97; P < .001) and BMI adjusted for age, gender, and race/ethnicity (RÂ² = .94). Concordance was also high between BMI categories (kappa = 0.77; P < .001). Findings provide support for the utility of self-report height and weight for survey research in college students.

Therefore, it is important to know to what extent these parental reports are valid and whether it makes a difference if the parents measured their children's weight and height at home or whether they simply estimated these values. The aim of this study is to compare the validity of parent-reported height, weight and BMI values of preschool children (3-7 y-old), when measured at home or estimated by parents without actual measurement. Methods The subjects were 297 Belgian preschool children (52.9% male). Participation rate was 73%. A questionnaire including questions about height and weight of the children was completed by the parents. Nurses measured height and weight following standardised procedures. International age- and sex-specific BMI cut-off values were employed to determine categories of weight status and obesity. Results On the group level, no important differences in accuracy of reported height, weight and BMI were identified between parent-measured or estimated values. However, for all 3 parameters, the correlations between parental reports and nurse measurements were higher in the group of children whose body dimensions were measured by the parents. Sensitivity for underweight and overweight/obesity were respectively 73% and 47% when parents measured their child's height and weight, and 55% and 47% when parents estimated values without measurement. Specificity for underweight and overweight/obesity were respectively 82% and 97% when parents measured the children, and 75% and 93% with parent estimations. Conclusions Diagnostic measures were more accurate when parents measured their child's weight and height at home than when those dimensions were based on parental judgements. When parent-reported data on an individual level is used, the accuracy could be improved by encouraging the parents to measure weight and height of their children at home\n\nMeasuring the accuracy of self-reported height and weight in a community-based sample of young people\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Self-reported anthropometric data are commonly used to estimate prevalence of obesity in population and community-based studies. We aim to: 1) Determine whether survey participants are able and willing to self-report height and weight; 2) Assess the accuracy of self-reported compared to measured anthropometric data in a community-based sample of young people. Methods Participants (16â29 years) of a behaviour survey, recruited at a Melbourne music festival (January 2011), were asked to self-report height and weight; researchers independently weighed and measured a sub-sample. Body Mass Index was calculated and overweight/obesity classified as â¥25kg/m2. Differences between measured and self-reported values were assessed using paired t-test/Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Accurate report of height and weight were defined as <2cm and <2kg difference between self-report and measured values, respectively. Agreement between classification of overweight/obesity by self-report and measured values was assessed using McNemarâs test. Results Of 1405 survey participants, 82% of males and 72% of females self-reported their height and weight. Among 67 participants who were also independently measured, self-reported height and weight were significantly less than measured height (p=0.01) and weight (p<0.01) among females, but no differences were detected among males. Overall, 52% accurately self-reported height, 30% under-reported, and 18% over-reported; 34% accurately self-reported weight, 52% under-reported and 13% over-reported. More females (70%) than males (35%) under-reported weight (p=0.01). Prevalence of overweight/obesity was 33% based on self-report data and 39% based on measured data (p=0.16). Conclusions Self-reported measurements may underestimate weight but accurately identified overweight/obesity in the majority of this sample of young people.

T.; Roque, Alexandre\n\n2018-01-01\n\nHeight and weight are measurements explored to tracking nutritional diseases, energy expenditure, clinical conditions, drug dosages, and infusion rates. Many patients are not ambulant or may be unable to communicate, and a sequence of these factors may not allow accurate estimation or measurements; in those cases, it can be estimated approximately by anthropometric means. Different groups have proposed different linear or non-linear equations which coefficients are obtained by using single or multiple linear regressions. In this paper, we present a complete study of the application of different learning models to estimate height and weight from anthropometric measurements: support vector regression, Gaussian process, and artificial neural networks. The predicted values are significantly more accurate than that obtained with conventional linear regressions. In all the cases, the predictions are non-sensitive to ethnicity, and to gender, if more than two anthropometric parameters are analyzed. The learning model analysis creates new opportunities for anthropometric applications in industry, textile technology, security, and health care.

This study examined the accuracy of measuring body height in bed in the supine position. Two measurements were performed on 108 ambulatory inpatients: (1) standing height using a standard height-weight scale, and (2) bed height using a flexible tape. Patients were divided into four groups based on which of two researchers performed each of the two measurements. Each patient was also weighed and self-reported height, weight, sex, and age were recorded. Bed height was significantly longer than standing height by 3.68 cm, but the two measurements were equally precise. It was believed, however, that this 2% difference was probably not clinically significant in most circumstances. Bed height correlated highly with standing height (r = 0.95), and the regression equation was standing height = 13.82 +/- 0.09 bed height. Patients overestimated their heights. Heights recorded by nurses were more accurate when patients were measured than when asked about their heights, but the patients were more often asked than measured.\n\nHeight and weight errors in aeromedical certification data.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1973-06-01\n\nThe Framingham Relative Weight Index (FRWI) of obesity was described in previous reports as a screening aid for detecting susceptibility to coronary heart disease (CHD).

Height, weight, 33 anthropometric measurements and 12 skinfolds were measured. The data were classified into five height-weight mean and SD-classes applying the Estonian reference values for this age and sex (GrÃ¼nberg et al. 1998). There were 3 classes with conformity between height and weight class: 1--small (small height and small weight), 2--medium (medium height and medium weight), 3--large (large height and large weight), 4--weight class dominating (pyknomorphic) and 5--height class dominating (leptomorphic). It was found, that in classes 1, 2 and 3 the height and weight increase was in accordance with the increase in all heights, breadths and depths, circumferences, skinfolds, body fat, muscle and bone mass. In class 4 circumferences, skinfolds, body fat and muscle mass were bigger. In class 5 all heights and the relative bone mass were bigger. The present investigation confirms the assumption that the five height-weight mean and SD five-class system applying the Estonian reference values for classifying the anthropometric variables is suitable for seventeen-year-old conscripts. As well the border values of 5%, 50% and 95% for every anthropometrical variable in the five-classes were calculated, which may be helpful for practical classifying.\n\nSelf-reported versus measured body height and weight in Polish adult men: the risk of underestimating obesity rates.\n\nPubMed\n\nÅopuszaÅska, Monika; Lipowicz, Anna; KoÅodziej, Halina; Szklarska, Alicja; Bielicki, Tadeusz\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn some epidemiological studies, self-reported height and weight are often used to save time and money. Self-reported height and weight are commonly used to assess the prevalence of obesity. The aim of this study was to assess the differences between self-reported and measured height and weight in adult men, and to determine how the accuracy of self-reported data depended on age and education. The prevalence of obesity was also calculated based both on self-reported and measured data. Data were collected during two population studies carried out in Wroclaw in 2010. One study included 1,194 19-year-old males who reported for the health examination mandated by the National Conscription Board (younger group). The other group included 355 men between 35 and 80 years old who reported for a ten-year follow-up (older group). Data were analyzed separately for both age groups. Both younger and older subjects overestimated their height by 1.4 cm and 1.0 cm (1.4 cm, 95 % CI: 1.26, 1.51, and 1.0 cm, 95 % CI: 0.85, 1.26, respectively). On average, younger subjects overestimated their weight by 0.7 kilograms (95 % CI: 0.55, 0.92), whereas older subjects underestimated their weight by 0.9 kilograms (95 % CI: -1.15, -0.48). The lower the level of education, the more the subjects overestimated their height. Adult men systematically overestimate their height and underestimate their weight. The magnitude of the inaccuracy depends on level of education. When self-reported data are used, the prevalence of obesity is generally underestimated. Using self-reported data to calculate BMI can lead to a substantial underestimation of the proportion of underweight and obese individuals in a population. Finally, using self-reported values for height in studies on social inequality may lead to false conclusions. Background: In some epidemiological studies, self-reported height and weight are often used to save time and money. Self-reported height and weight are commonly used to assess the\n\nHeight and Weight of Children: United States.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHamill, Peter V. V.; And Others\n\nThis report contains national estimates based on findings from the Health Examination Survey in 1963-65 on height and weight measurements of children 6- to 11-years-old. A nationwide probability sample of 7,119 children was selected to represent the noninstitutionalized children (about 24 million) in this age group.

Analysis of self-reported and measured height and weight data from participants in the Oxford cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Oxford). Four thousand eight hundred and eight British men and women aged 35-76 years. Spearman rank correlations between self-reported and measured height, weight and BMI were high (r > 0.9, P < 0.0001). Height was overestimated by a mean of 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.34) cm in men and 0.60 (0.51-0.70) cm in women; the extent of overestimation was greater in older men and women, shorter men and heavier women. Weight was underestimated by a mean of 1.85 (1.72-1.99) kg in men and 1.40 (1.31-1.49) kg in women; the extent of underestimation was greater in heavier men and women, but did not vary with age or height. Using standard categories of BMI, 22.4% of men and 18.0% of women were classified incorrectly based on self-reported height and weight. After correcting the self-reported values using predictive equations derived from a 10% sample of subjects, misclassification decreased to 15.2% in men and 13.8% in women. Self-reported height and weight data are valid for identifying relationships in epidemiological studies. In analyses where anthropometric factors are the primary variables of interest, measurements in a representative sample of the study population can be used to improve the accuracy of estimates of height, weight and BMI.\n\nThe validity of self-reported vs. measured body weight and height and the effect of self-perception.\n\nPubMed\n\nGokler, Mehmet Enes; Bugrul, Necati; SarÄ±, Ahu Ozturk; Metintas, Selma\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe objective was to assess the validity of self-reported body weight and height and the possible influence of self-perception of body mass index (BMI) status on the actual BMI during the adolescent period. This cross sectional study was conducted on 3918 high school students. Accurate BMI perception occurred when the student's self-perception of their BMI status did not differ from their actual BMI based on measured height and weight. Agreement between the measured and self-reported body height and weight and BMI values was determined using the Bland-Altman metod. To determine the effects of \"a good level of agreement\", hierarchical logistic regression models were used. Among male students who reported their BMI in the normal region, 2.8% were measured as overweight while 0.6% of them were measured as obese. For females in the same group, these percentages were 1.3% and 0.4% respectively. Among male students who perceived their BMI in the normal region, 8.5% were measured as overweight while 0.4% of them were measured as obese. For females these percentages were 25.6% and 1.8% respectively. According to logistic regression analysis, residence and accurate BMI perception were significantly associated with \"good agreement\" ( p â¤ 0.001). The results of this study demonstrated that in determining obesity and overweight statuses, non-accurate weight perception is a potential risk for students.\n\nValidity of self-reported weight and height: a cross-sectional study among Malaysian adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nKee, C C; Lim, K H; Sumarni, M G; Teh, C H; Chan, Y Y; Nuur Hafizah, M I; Cheah, Y K; Tee, E O; Ahmad Faudzi, Y; Amal Nasir, M\n\n2017-06-02\n\nSelf-reported weight and height are commonly used in lieu of direct measurements of weight and height in large epidemiological surveys due to inevitable constraints such as budget and human resource. However, the validity of self-reported weight and height, particularly among adolescents, needs to be verified as misreporting could lead to misclassification of body mass index and therefore overestimation or underestimation of the burden of BMI-related diseases. The objective of this study was to determine the validity of self-reported weight and height among Malaysian secondary school children. Both self-reported and directly measured weight and height of a subgroup of 663 apparently healthy schoolchildren from the Malaysian Adolescent Health Risk Behaviour (MyAHRB) survey 2013/2014 were analysed. Respondents were required to report their current body weight and height via a self-administrative questionnaire before they were measured by investigators. The validity of self-reported against directly measured weight and height was examined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the Bland-Altman plot and weighted Kappa statistics. There was very good intraclass correlation between self-reported and directly measured weight [rÂ =Â 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93, 0.97] and height (rÂ =Â 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.96). In addition the Bland-Altman plots indicated that the mean difference between self-reported and direct measurement was relatively small. The mean difference (self-reported minus direct measurements) was, for boys: weight, -2.1Â kg; height, -1.6Â cm; BMI, -0.44Â kg/m 2 and girls: weight, -1.2Â kg; height, -0.9Â cm; BMI, -0.3Â kg/m 2 . However, 95% limits of agreement were wide which indicated substantial discrepancies between self-reported and direct measurements method at the individual level. Nonetheless, the weighted Kappa statistics demonstrated a substantial agreement between BMI status categorised based on self-reported weight and height\n\nFive-class height-weight model for systematization of seventeen-year-old recruits' anthropometric data.\n\nPubMed\n\nLintsi, Mart; Kaarma, Helje\n\n2003-12-01\n\nAn anthropometric study of 552 Tartu city and Tartu county recruits aged 17 years was carried out. Height and weight, 33 anthropometric measurements and 12 skinfolds were measured. Body fat percentage was assessed by Omron BF 300 hand-held segmental body fat analyzer. From anthropometric measurements bone mass was derived by the Drink-water et al. (1986) equation, and total skeletal muscle mass by the Lee et al. (2000) equation. The data were systematized into five height-weight SD-classes. There were 3 classes with harmony between height and weight class: 1--small (small height and small weight), 2--medium (medium height and medium weight), 3--large (large height and large weight), 4--weight class dominating (pyknomorphic) and 5--height class dominating (leptomorphic). It was revealed that in classes 1, 2 and 3 the height and weight increase corresponded to the increase in all heights, breadths and depths, circumferences, skinfolds, body fat, muscle and bone mass. In class 4 circumferences, skinfolds, body fat and muscle mass were bigger. In class 5 all heights and the relative bone mass were bigger. The present investigation confirms the hypothesis that the five height-weight class system is applicable to seventeen-year-old recruits.\n\nUse of self-reported measures of height, weight and body mass index in a rural population of Northeast Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartins, Poliana Cardoso; de Carvalho, Maria Bernadete; Machado, Carla Jorge\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo assess the validity of using self-reported anthropometric data for diagnosis of nutritional status of adults in a rural population of northeast Brazil. A population-based survey was conducted on a sample of 797 individuals aged 18 years or more. The proportion of individuals who knew their anthropometric measures was calculated. For agreement analysis between those who reported their measures the following indicators were obtained: differences between averages (weight, height, body mass index), intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), Kappa statistic, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (VPN). Bland-Altman graphics were also obtained. More than half of the respondents (58.5%) did not know their weight or height. Weight was the most known measure among all. The magnitude of the mean difference for weight, height and body mass index (BMI) (0.43 kg, 0.31 cm, 0.32 kg/m2, respectively) was small, indicating good agreement, with a trend toward overestimation. ICC for weight, height and BMI were 0.96; 0.60; and 0.53, respectively. Kappa statistic indicated good agreement in all strata. General measures of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 84.2; 82; 90.7 and 71.3%, respectively. Elderly, those with low schooling and those who do not often weigh were less accurate on their measures. The use of self-reported measures should be done with caution in epidemiological studies in rural populations.\n\nA chart to link child centiles of body mass index, weight and height.\n\nPubMed\n\nCole, T J\n\n2002-12-01\n\nWeight for height in children is often assessed by comparing the child's weight-for-age centile with their height-for-age centile. However, this assessment has not been validated statistically, and it differs from the body mass index (BMI) centile. To study indices of weight-for-height based on weight centile-for-age adjusted for height centile-for-age, and to see how they relate to the BMI centile-for-age. Cross-sectional survey of data for 40 536 boys and girls aged 0-18 y from the 1980 Nationwide Dutch Growth Survey, using the British 1990 and US CDC 2000 growth references. Two measures of weight for height: (a) the difference between weight centile and height centile, and (b) BMI centile, with the centiles analysed as SD scores (SDS). BMI centile is correlated strongly with weight centile (r=0.77) but weakly with height centile (r=0.1). By contrast the difference between weight centile and height centile is correlated only weakly with weight centile (r=0.3) and strongly negatively with height centile (r=-0.5). BMI centile is predicted to high accuracy by the multiple regression on weight centile and height centile (93-97% of variance explained, s.e.e. 0.2 units). A child's BMI centile can be calculated to high accuracy from their weight and height centiles as read off the weight and height charts. This avoids the need to calculate BMI or to plot it on the BMI chart. A chart is provided to simplify this calculation, which works throughout the spectrum of nutritional status. It can also be used to monitor individuals' weight, height and BMI centiles simultaneously as they change over time. However the simpler procedure of comparing weight and height centiles (eg a difference of two or three channel widths) is a poor measure of weight-for-height and should not be used.\n\nReliability of self-reported weight and height among state bank employees.\n\nPubMed\n\nChor, D; Coutinho, E da S; Laurenti, R\n\n1999-02-01\n\nSelf-reported weight and height were compared with direct measurements in order to evaluate the agreement between the two sources. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional study on health status from a probabilistic sample of 1,183 employees of a bank, in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Direct measurements were made of 322 employees. Differences between the two sources were evaluated using mean differences, limits of agreement and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Men and women tended to underestimate their weight while differences between self-reported and measured height were insignificant. Body mass index (BMI) mean differences were smaller than those observed for weight. ICC was over 0.98 for weight and 0.95 for BMI, expressing close agreement. Combining a graphical method with ICC may be useful in pilot studies to detect populational groups capable of providing reliable information on weight and height, thus minimizing resources needed for field work.\n\nValidation of predictive equations for weight and height using a metric tape.\n\nPubMed\n\nRabito, E I; Mialich, M S; MartÃ­nez, E Z; GarcÃ­a, R W D; Jordao, A A; Marchini, J S\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWeight and height measurements are important data for the evaluation of nutritional status but some situations prevent the execution of these measurements in the standard manner, using special equipment or an estimate by predictive equations. Predictive equations of height and weight requiring only a metric tape as an instrument have been recently developed. To validate three predictive equations for weight and two for height by Rabito and evaluating their agreement with the equations proposed by Chumlea. The following data were collected: sex, age and anthropometric measurements, ie, weight (kg), height (m), subscapular skinfold (mm), calf (cm), arm (cm) and abdominal (cm) circumferences, arm length (cm), and half span (cm). Data were analyzed statistically using the Lin coefficient to test the agreement between the equations and the St. Laurent coefficient to compare the estimated weight and height values with real values. 100 adults (age 48 +/- 18 years) admitted to the University Hospital (HCFMRP/USP) were evaluated. Equations I: W(kg) = 0.5030 (AC) + 0.5634 (AbC) + 1.3180 (CC) +0.0339 (SSSF) - 43.1560 and II: W (kg) = 0.4808 (AC) + 0.5646 (AbC) +1.3160 (CC) - 42.2450 showed the highest coefficients of agreement for weight and equations IV and V showed the highest coefficients of agreement for height. The St. Laurent coefficient indicated that equations III and V were valid for weight and height, respectively. Among the validated equations, the number III W (kg) = 0.5759 (AC) + 0.5263 (AbC) +1.2452 (CC) - 4.8689 (S) - 32.9241 and VH (m) = 63,525 -3,237(S) - 0,06904 (A) + 1,293 (HS) are recommended for height or weight because of their easy use for hospitalized patients and the equations be validated in other situations.\n\nThe association between weight, height, and head circumference reconsidered.\n\nPubMed\n\nScheffler, Christiane; Greil, Holle; Hermanussen, Michael\n\n2017-05-01\n\nUnder normal nutritional and health conditions, body height, weight and head circumference are significantly related. We hypothesize that the apparent general association between weight, height, and head circumference of the growing child might be misleading. We reanalyzed data of 7,444 boys and 7,375 girls measured in East-Germany between 1986 and 1990, aged from 0 to 7 y with measurements of body length/height, leg length, sitting height, biacromial shoulder breadth, thoracic breadth, thoracic depth, thoracic circumference, body weight, head volume, percentage of body fat, and hip skinfold vertical, using principal component analysis. Strong associations exist between skeletal growth, fat accumulation, and head volume increments. Yet in spite of this general proportionality, skeletal growth, fat acquisition, and head growth exhibit different patterns. Three components explain between almost 60% and more than 75% of cumulative variance between birth and age 7 y. Parameters of skeletal growth predominantly load on the first component and clearly separate from indicators of fat deposition. After age of 2 y, head volume loads on a separate third component in both sexes indicating independence of head growth. Under appropriate nutritional and health circumstances, nutritional status, body size, and head circumference are not related.\n\nAccuracy and usefulness of BMI measures based on self-reported weight and height: findings from the NHANES & NHIS 2001-2006.\n\nPubMed\n\nStommel, Manfred; Schoenborn, Charlotte A\n\n2009-11-19\n\nThe Body Mass Index (BMI) based on self-reported height and weight (\"self-reported BMI\") in epidemiologic studies is subject to measurement error. However, because of the ease and efficiency in gathering height and weight information through interviews, it remains important to assess the extent of error present in self-reported BMI measures and to explore possible adjustment factors as well as valid uses of such self-reported measures. Using the combined 2001-2006 data from the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, discrepancies between BMI measures based on self-reported and physical height and weight measures are estimated and socio-demographic predictors of such discrepancies are identified. Employing adjustments derived from the socio-demographic predictors, the self-reported measures of height and weight in the 2001-2006 National Health Interview Survey are used for population estimates of overweight & obesity as well as the prediction of health risks associated with large BMI values. The analysis relies on two-way frequency tables as well as linear and logistic regression models. All point and variance estimates take into account the complex survey design of the studies involved. Self-reported BMI values tend to overestimate measured BMI values at the low end of the BMI scale (< 22) and underestimate BMI values at the high end, particularly at values > 28. The discrepancies also vary systematically with age (younger and older respondents underestimate their BMI more than respondents aged 42-55), gender and the ethnic/racial background of the respondents. BMI scores, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, tend to narrow, but do not eliminate misclassification of obese people as merely overweight, but health risk estimates associated with variations in BMI values are virtually the same, whether based on self-report or measured BMI values. BMI values based on self-reported height and weight, if corrected for\n\nIs School-Based Height and Weight Screening of Elementary Students Private and Reliable?\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nStoddard, Sarah A.; Kubik, Martha Y.; Skay, Carol\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends school-based body mass index (BMI) screening as an obesity prevention strategy.

Design Analysis of self-reported and measured weight and height from participants in the Sister Study (2003â2009), a nationwide cohort of 50,884 women aged 35â74 in the United States with a sister with breast cancer. Setting Weight and height were reported via computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) and self-administered questionnaires, and measured by examiners. Subjects Early enrollees in the Sister Study. There were 18,639 women available for the accuracy analyses and 13,316 for the reliability analyses. Results Using weighted kappa statistics, comparisons were made between CATI responses and examiner measures to assess accuracy and CATI and questionnaire responses to assess reliability. Polytomous logistic regression evaluated factors associated with over- or under-reporting. Compared to measured values, agreement was 96% for reported height (Â±1 inch; weighted kappa 0.84) and 67% for weight (Â±3 pounds; weighted kappa 0.92). Obese women [body mass index (BMI) â¥30 kg/m2)] were more likely than normal weight women to under-report weight by â¥5% and underweight women (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) were more likely to over-report. Among normal and overweight women (18.5 kgm2â¤ BMI <30 kgm2), weight cycling and lifetime weight difference â¥50 pounds were associated with over-reporting. Conclusions U.S. women in the Sister Study were reasonably reliable and accurate in reporting weight and height. Women with normal-range BMI reported most accurately. Overweight and obese women and those with weight fluctuations were less accurate, but even among obese women, few under-reported their weight by >10%.

The bias, precision, and accuracy of adolescent self-reported height and weight across subpopulations were examined using a large, diverse and representative sample of adolescents. A second objective was to develop correction equations for self-reported height and weight to provide more accurate estimates of body mass index (BMI) and weight status. A total of 24,221 students from 8th and 11th grade in Texas participated in the School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) surveillance system in years 2000-2002 and 2004-2005. To assess bias, the differences between the self-reported and objective measures, for height and weight were estimated. To assess precision and accuracy, the Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was used. BMI was estimated for self-reported and objective measures. The prevalence of students' weight status was estimated using self-reported and objective measures; absolute (bias) and relative error (relative bias) were assessed subsequently. Correction equations for sex and race/ethnicity subpopulations were developed to estimate objective measures of height, weight and BMI from self-reported measures using weighted linear regression. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of weight status classification using self-reported measures and correction equations are assessed by sex and grade. Students in 8th- and 11th-grade overestimated their height from 0.68cm (White girls) to 2.02 cm (African-American boys), and underestimated their weight from 0.4 kg (Hispanic girls) to 0.98 kg (African-American girls). The differences in self-reported versus objectively-measured height and weight resulted in underestimation of BMI ranging from -0.23 kg/m2 (White boys) to -0.7 kg/m2 (African-American girls). The sensitivity of self-reported measures to classify weight status as obese was 70.8% and 81\n\nClinical longitudinal standards for height, weight, height velocity, weight velocity, and stages of puberty.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTanner, J M; Whitehouse, R H\n\n1976-01-01\n\nNew charts for height, weight, height velocity, and weight velocity are presented for clinical (as opposed to population survey) use. They are based on longitudinal-type growth curves, using the same data as in the British 1965 growth standards. In the velocity standards centiles are given for children who are early- and late-maturing as well as for those who mature at the average age (thus extending the use of the previous charts). Limits of normality for the age of occurrence of the adolescent growth spurt are given and also for the successive stages of penis, testes, and pubic hair development in boys, and for stages of breast and pubic hair development in girls.

Body weight, height, half span, calf, arm and abdominal circumferences were determinated. Weight and height were estimated with de predictive equations published by Rabito et al. Bland-Altman analysis and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient were used to assess the levels of agreement between the estimated and the measured values. The level of statistical significance was p < 0.05. the age mean was 78.7 Â± 8.7 and 55.7% were females. The weight mean was 61.9 Â± 14.1 kg, height mean was 155.4 Â± 9.5 cm and Body Mass Index (BMI) mean corresponded to 25.5 Â± 5.1 kg/m. The Bland-Altman plots indicated that the 95% confidence interval (95% IC) limits for the difference between real and estimated weight ranged from -14.3 kg to 8.1 kg, the mean of the difference or systematic error (SE) was -3.1 kg, we observed an statistically significant coefficient of 0.12 (p < 0.03). The 95% IC limits for the difference between real and estimated height ranged from -11.1 to 15.9 cm, the diffe rence mean or SE of 2.4 cm, we observed a coefficient of -0.04 (p = 0.67) . Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.72 (p < 0.00) and 0.88 (p < 0.00) were obtained for weight and height, respectively. the equations developed by Rabito showed a good agreement when compared with the actual weight and height of elderly people.

Cadets.\n\nPubMed\n\nMitchell, Katherine M; Pritchett, Robert C; Gee, David L; Pritchett, Kelly L\n\n2017-09-01\n\nMitchell, KM, Pritchett, RC, Gee, DL, and Pritchett, KL. Comparison of circumference measures and height-weight tables with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry assessment of body composition in R.O.T.C. cadets. J Strength Cond Res 31(9): 2552-2556, 2017-Height-weight tables and circumference measures are used by the U.S. Army to predict body composition because they require little equipment or expertise. However, agreement between the Army's new 2002 circumference equation and an established laboratory technique has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to quantify agreement in body fat percentages between the Army's circumference measures (taping) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); second to determine categorical agreement between height-weight tables and DXA. Male Reserve Officer Training Corps (R.O.T.C.) cadets (N = 23; 20.6 Â± 1.6 years, 179.1 Â± 6.6 cm; 81.4 Â± 10.3 kg) were taped according to Army protocol to predict body fat. The % body fat prediction was compared with DXA through a Bland-Altman Plot with Â±2-4% body fat established as a zone of agreement (ZOA). Thirteen out of 23 cadets fell outside the ZOA. No cadet was over the compliance threshold (20-22% fat) using the tape method, however, with DXA, 7 out of 23 cadets were noncompliant. Height-weight tables provided a moderate level of categorical agreement with DXA. The results depict poor agreement between taping and DXA, as taping generally underestimated % body fat. Compared with taping, height-weight tables were better able to identify excess fat weight.\n\nThe accuracy of parent-reported height and weight for 6-12Â year old U.S. children.\n\nPubMed\n\nWright, Davene R; Glanz, Karen; Colburn, Trina; Robson, Shannon M; Saelens, Brian E\n\n2018-02-12\n\nPrevious studies have examined correlations between BMI calculated using parent-reported and directly-measured child height and weight. The objective of this study was to validate correction factors for parent-reported child measurements. Concordance between parent-reported and investigator measured child height, weight, and BMI (kg/m 2 ) among participants in the Neighborhood Impact on Kids Study (nâ=â616) was examined using the Lin coefficient, where a value of Â±1.0 indicates perfect concordance and a value of zero denotes non-concordance. A correction model for parent-reported height, weight, and BMI based on commonly collected demographic information was developed using 75% of the sample. This model was used to estimate corrected measures for the remaining 25% of the sample and measured concordance between correct parent-reported and investigator-measured values. Accuracy of corrected values in classifying children as overweight/obese was assessed by sensitivity and specificity. Concordance between parent-reported and measured height, weight and BMI was low (0.007, -â0.039, and -â0.005 respectively). Concordance in the corrected test samples improved to 0.752 for height, 0.616 for weight, and 0.227 for BMI. Sensitivity of corrected parent-reported measures for predicting overweight and obesity among children in the test sample decreased from 42.8 to 25.6% while specificity improved from 79.5 to 88.6%. Correction factors improved concordance for height and weight but did not improve the sensitivity of parent-reported measures for measuring child overweight and obesity. Future research should be conducted using larger and more nationally-representative samples that allow researchers to fully explore demographic variance in correction coefficients.\n\nWhat's the Right Weight for My Height?

However, stature is difficult or impossible to measure in elderly because they are often unable to maintain the standing position. A alternative is the use of estimated height from measurements of knee height measure. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the formula proposed by Chumlea et al. (1985) based on the knee of a Caucasian population to estimate the height and its application in calculation of body mass index in community- dwelling older people residents in ViÃ§osa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The sample included 621 elderly aged 60 years old and older, living in the community. Measures of weight, height and knee height (KH) were taken and Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated with the measured weight and estimated. The Student`s t-test was used for comparison of measurements of height between the genders. For the comparison of estimated and measured values it was used paired t-test and also the methodology proposed by Bland and Altman to compare the difference between measurements. To evaluate the agreement between the classifications for BMI was used Cohen's Kappa. The average values obtained from KH were higher than those measured in the whole sample and women. There underestimation of BMI in females and also in the whole. The present results suggest that the equation Chumlea was not adequate to estimate the height of the sample in question, especially for women. Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

The design was cross sectional. Height and weight of adult patients suffering from SCD were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), vitreous chamber depth (VCD) and axial length (AL) were measured using A-scan ultrasonography. Corneal radius of curvature (CR) was measured using a keratometer. Non-cycloplegic refractive error was determined subjectively. Subjects with SC genotype were significantly taller than those with SS genotype. In the unadjusted data, height was correlated with VCD [p = 0.02, 0.44 mm deeper per 10 cm increase in height, 95% CI (0.65, 8.25)] and AL [p = 0.03, 0.42 mm longer for every 10 cm increase in height, 95%CI (0.49, 7.99)]. The relationship between height, VCD and AL was absent after adjustment for age, gender, genotype and weight. BMI (kg m(-2)) was correlated with AL/CR ratio in both unadjusted (p = 0.04, -0.10 decrease per 1 kg m(-2), 95% CI (-0.018, -0.001) and adjusted data (p = 0.05, -0.10 decrease per 10 kg m(-2), 95% CI (-0.0189, 0.0001). Refractive error was not related to height, weight or BMI. Physical size does not affect refractive error or optical components in adult patients with SCD.\n\n[Weight and height local growth charts of Algerian children and adolescents (6-18 years of age)].\n\nPubMed\n\nBahchachi, N; Dahel-Mekhancha, C C; Rolland-Cachera, M F; Badis, N; Roelants, M; Hauspie, R; Nezzal, L\n\n2016-04-01\n\nMeasurements of height and weight provide important information on growth and development, puberty, and nutritional status in children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to develop contemporary reference growth centiles for Algerian children and adolescents (6-18 years of age). A cross-sectional growth survey was conducted in government schools on 7772 healthy schoolchildren (45.1% boys and 54.9% girls) aged 6-18 years in Constantine (eastern Algeria) in 2008. Height and weight were measured with portable stadiometers and calibrated scales, respectively. Smooth reference curves of height and weight were estimated with the LMS method. These height and weight curves are presented together with local data from Arab countries and with the growth references of France, Belgium (Flanders), and the World Health Organization (WHO) 2007. In girls, median height and weight increased until 16 and 17 years of age, respectively, whereas in boys, they increased through age 18 years. Between ages 11 and 13 years (puberty), girls were taller and heavier than boys. After puberty, boys became taller than girls, by up to 13 cm by the age of 18 years. Median height and weight of Algerian boys and girls were generally intermediate between those observed in other Arab countries. They were higher than the French reference values up to the age of 13 years and lower than Belgian and WHO reference values at all ages. The present study provides Algerian height- and weight-for-age growth charts, which should be recommended as a national reference for monitoring growth and development in children and adolescents.

We assessed the secular trends in height and weight in children of the Seychelles, a rapidly developing island state in the Indian Ocean (African region). Height and weight were measured in all students of all schools in four selected school grades (kindergarten, 4th, 7th and 10th grades) for the periods 1998-9 (6391 children) and 2005-6 (8582 children). Data for 1956-7 was extracted from a previously published report. At age 15.5 years, boys/girls were on average 10/13 cm taller and 15/9 kg heavier in 2005-6 than in 1956-7. Height increased in boys/girls by 1.62/0.93 cm/decade between 1956-7 and 1998-9 and by 1.14/1.82 cm/decade between 1998-9 and 2005-6. For weight, the linear increase in boys/girls was 1.38/1.10 kg/decade between 1956-7 and 1998-9 and 2.21/2.50 kg/decade between 1998-9 and 2005-6. Overall, the relative increase in weight between 1956-7 and 2005-6 was 5-fold higher than the relative increase in height. Height and weight increased markedly over time in children aged <16 years in the Seychelles, consistent with large changes in socio-economic and nutritional indicators in the considered 50-year interval. The markedly steeper increase in weight than height over time is consistent with an epidemic of overweight and obesity.\n\nInfluence of height, weight, and body mass index on optic disc parameters.\n\nPubMed\n\nZheng, Yingfeng; Cheung, Carol Y L; Wong, Tien Y; Mitchell, Paul; Aung, Tin\n\n2010-06-01\n\nTo examine the influence of body height, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) on optic disc parameters in a population-based study. The Singapore Malay Eye Study examined 3280 persons of Malay ethnicity, aged 40 to 80 years, of whom 2329 (71.0%) had reliable retinal scanning confocal laser tomography images for analyses. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was ascertained by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Body height and weight were measured with standardized protocols; BMI was calculated as weight (kilograms)/height squared (meters). Sociodemographic information was collected in an interviewer-administered questionnaire. In univariate analyses, body height, weight, and BMI were significantly associated with optic cup area, rim area, and cup-to-disc area ratio (all with P < 0.05) but none of the anthropometric parameters was significantly associated with optic disc area (all with P > 0.05). In multiple regression analyses after adjustment for age, sex, optic disc size, axial length, education, family income, and IOP, each SD increase in body height was associated with a 0.042-mm(2) decrease in optic rim area and a 0.020 increase in optic cup-to-disc area ratio; each SD decrease in body weight was associated with a 0.013-mm(2) decrease in optic rim area and a 0.010 increase in optic cup-to-disc ratio; and each SD decrease in BMI was associated with a 0.021-mm(2) decrease in optic rim area and a 0.010 increase in optic cup-to-disc ratio. Persons who are taller or have lower BMI have a smaller neuroretinal rim area and a larger optic cup-to-disc area ratio.\n\nOptimal scaling of weight and waist circumference to height for maximal association with DXA-measured total body fat mass by sex, age and race/ethnicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeo, M; Kabat, G C; Gallagher, D; Heymsfield, S B; Rohan, T E\n\n2013-08-01\n\nBody mass index (BMI; weight (Wt)/height (Ht) (in kgâm(-2)) and waist circumference (WC) are widely used as proxy anthropometric measures for total adiposity. Little is known about what scaling power of 'x' in both Wt(kg)/Ht(m)(x) and WC(m)/Ht(m)(x) is maximally associated with measured total body fat mass (TBFM). Establishing values for x would provide the information needed to create optimum anthropometric surrogate measures of adiposity. To estimate the value of 'x' that renders Wt/Ht(x) and WC/Ht(x) maximally associated with DXA-measured TBFM. Participants of the NHANES 1999-2004 surveys, stratified by sex (men, women), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican-Americans), and age(18-29, 30-49, 50-84 years). We apply a grid search by increasing x from 0.0-3.0 by increments of 0.1 to the simple regression models, TBFM=b0+b1*(Wt/Ht(x)) and TBFM=b0+b1*(WC/Ht(x)) to obtain an estimate of x that results in the greatest R(2), taking into account complex survey design features and multiply imputed data. R(2)'s for BMI are 0.86 for men (N=6544) and 0.92 for women (N=6362). The optimal powers x for weight are 1.0 (R(2)=0.90) for men and 0.8 (R(2)=0.96) for women. The optimal power x for WC is 0, that is, no scaling of WC to height, for men (R(2)=0.90) or women (R(2)=0.82). The optimal powers for weight across nine combinations of race/ethnicity and age groups for each sex vary slightly (x=0.8-1.3) whereas the optimal scaling powers for WC are all 0 for both sexes except for non-Hispanic black men aged 18-29y (x=0.1). Although the weight-for-height indices with optimal powers are not independent of height, they yield more accurate TBFM estimates than BMI. In reference to TBFM, Wt/Ht and Wt/Ht(0.8) are the optimal weight-for-height indices for men and women, respectively, whereas WC alone, without Ht adjustment, is the optimal WC-for-height index for both sexes. Thus, BMI, an index independent of height, may be less useful when predicting TBFM.\n\nRelationship between axial length of the emmetropic eye and the age, body height, and body weight of schoolchildren.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeloviÄ, Alen; Juresa, Vesna; Ivankovic, Davor; Malcic, Davor; SeloviÄ Bobonj, Gordana\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis report assesses the relationship of axial length of emmetropic (without refractive error) eyes to age, height, and weight in 1,600 Croatian schoolchildren. Axial eye lengths were determined by an ultrasonic eye biometry (A scan). Axial length of both eyes increases with age, height, and weight but shows a closer correlation to height and weight than to age. Boys have a significantly longer axial eye length than girls (P < 0.01). Boys or girls of similar or nearing body height and body weight and with emmetropic eyes have close linear measures of anatomic eye structures within their sex, regardless their age. Body height demonstrates the closest correlation to the growth and development of the emmetropic eye.

Brandon; Kantor, Micheal E.; Eichelberger, Hillary; Garden, Adam S.; Rosenthal, David I.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives We undertook a challenge to determine if one or more height-weight formula(e) can be clinically used as a surrogate for direct CT-based imaging assessment of body composition before and after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, who are at risk for cancer- and therapy-associated cachexia/sarcopenia. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-institution study included 215 HNC patients, treated with curative radiotherapy between 2003 and 2013. Height/weight measures were tabulated. Skeletal muscle mass was contoured on pre- and post-treatment CT at the L3 vertebral level. Three common lean body mass (LBM) formulae (Hume, Boer, and James) were calculated, and compared to CT assessment at each time point. Results 156 patients (73%) had tumors arising in the oropharynx and 130 (61%) received concurrent chemotherapy. Mean pretreatment body mass index (BMI) was 28.5 Â± 4.9 kg/m2 in men and 27.8 Â± 8 kg/m2 in women. Mean post-treatment BMI were 26.2 Â± 4.4 kg/m2 in men, 26 Â± 7.5 kg/m2 in women. Mean CT-derived LBM decreased from 55.2Â±11.8 kg pre-therapy to 49.27Â±9.84 kg post-radiation. Methods comparison revealed 95% limit of agreement of Â±12.5â13.2 kg between CT and height-weight formulae. Post-treatment LBM with the three formulae was significantly different from CT (p<0.0001). In all instances, no height-weight formula was practically equivalent to CT within Â±5 kg. Conclusion Formulae cannot accurately substitute for direct quantitative imaging LBM measurements. We therefore recommend CT-based LBM assessment as a routine practice of head and neck cancer patient body composition.

This study used the diagnostic standard of metabolic syndrome to assess the accuracy of individual's self-reported height, weight and waist circumference in a Japanese sample. Study participants included 7,443 Japanese men and women aged 35-79Â years. They participated in a cohort study's baseline survey between 2007 and 2011. Participants' height, weight and waist circumference were measured, and their body mass index was calculated. Self-reported values were collected through a questionnaire before the examination. Strong correlations between measured and self-reported values for height, weight and body mass index were detected. The correlation was lowest for waist circumference (men, 0.87; women, 0.73). Men significantly overestimated their waist circumference (mean difference, 0.8Â cm), whereas women significantly underestimated theirs (mean difference, 5.1Â cm). The sensitivity of self-reported waist circumference using the cut-off value of metabolic syndrome was 0.83 for men and 0.57 for women. Due to systematic and random errors, the accuracy of self-reported waist circumference was low. Therefore, waist circumference should be measured without relying on self-reported values, particularly in the case of women.\n\nVariation of growth in height and weight of children. II. After infancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSorva, R; Lankinen, S; Tolppanen, E M; Perheentupa, J\n\n1990-05-01\n\nTo provide for early detection of abnormal changes in growth, we propose the monitoring of all children for changes in relative height and relative weight as indirect indicators of growth velocity. To this end we analyzed the growth of 2,156 children, as recorded by the child health surveillance services at ages 2 to 19 years. From their data we constructed growth standards on charts of a novel type, which allow direct reading of relative height (SD score, SDS) and relative weight (percentage deviation of weight from median weight for height and sex, %DW). Variation in height explained most (mean 60%) of the variation in weight, and age did not contribute significantly. Hence, our weight charts are height-based. Next, we defined the variations of changes in (delta) SDS and %DW during the different periods of growth. The group means of changes in each period were zero. Variation in delta SDS is widest at the earliest ages, then decreases until year 9-10 (girls) and 10-11 (boys), and again increases. For delta %DW the picture is similar. We present these variations as diagrams for use in growth screening.\n\nHeight and Weight of Southeast Asian Preschool Children in Northern California.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDewey, Kathryn G.; And Others\n\n1986-01-01\n\nAnthropometric data were obtained from 526 Southeast Asian preschool children during 1980-84. Mean weights and heights were substantially below the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 50th percentile, but rates of weight and height gain were similar to reference values, indicating adequate growth after arrival in the United States.â¦\n\nWeight-for-height values and limb anthropometric composition of tube-fed children with quadriplegic cerebral palsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKong, Chi-Keung; Wong, Heung-Sang Stephen\n\n2005-12-01\n\nResearch has shown that growth retardation among children with quadriplegic cerebral palsy (CP) is often attributed to feeding dysfunction and malnutrition. The study compared weight-for-height values and limb anthropometric composition of nasogastric and gastrostomy tube-fed children with quadriplegic CP with those of orally fed children with quadriplegic CP and normal children, to examine the plausible effects of tube feeding on weight-for-height, fat, and muscle values for children with quadriplegic CP. Triceps, anterior mid-thigh, and medial calf skinfold thicknesses and the corresponding circumferences of the right or less affected side were measured. The subjects consisted of 119 normal children and 62 orally fed and 48 tube-fed children with quadriplegic CP. Body weight and height were recorded. For children with CP whose height could not be measured, height was estimated from the ulna length. Weight-for-height z scores, limb skinfold thicknesses, fat areas, skinfold-corrected muscle girths, and muscle areas of the children were compared. Tube-fed children with CP had normal mean weight-for-height z scores. Weight-for-height z scores of the orally fed children with CP were significantly below those of normal children and tube-fed children with CP. For children with CP, whereas triceps skinfold thickness seemed to predict the mid-upper arm fat area correctly, leg skinfold thicknesses seemed to overestimate the corresponding fat areas. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that triceps skinfold thicknesses had good correlation (r = 0.86) and the presence of CP had nonsignificant correlation with mid-upper arm fat areas. Multiple regression analysis of fat areas with skinfold thicknesses and the presence of CP, however, showed that CP was correlated negatively (partial correlation of CP: thigh, -0.45; calf, -0.53) with thigh and calf fat areas. Although skinfold-corrected mid-upper arm muscle girths of children with CP were quite similar to those of\n\nComparative evaluation of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters during mechanical ventilation with two tidal volumes calculated by demi-span based height and measured height in normal lungs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeresht, L. Mousavi; Golparvar, Mohammad; Yaraghi, Ahmad\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Appropriate determination of tidal volume (VT) is important for preventing ventilation induced lung injury. We compared hemodynamic and respiratory parameters in two conditions of receiving VTs calculated by using body weight (BW), which was estimated by measured height (HBW) or demi-span based body weight (DBW). Materials and Methods: This controlled-trial was conducted in St. Alzahra Hospital in 2009 on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II, 18-65-years-old patients. Standing height and weight were measured and then height was calculated using demi-span method. BW and VT were calculated with acute respiratory distress syndrome-net formula. Patients were randomized and then crossed to receive ventilation with both calculated VTs for 20 min. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were analyzed with SPSS version 20.0 using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Forty nine patients were studied. Demi-span based body weight and thus VT (DTV) were lower than Height based body weight and VT (HTV) (P = 0.028), in male patients (P = 0.005). Difference was observed in peak airway pressure (PAP) and airway resistance (AR) changes with higher PAP and AR at 20 min after receiving HTV compared with DTV. Conclusions: Estimated VT based on measured height is higher than that based on demi-span and this difference exists only in females, and this higher VT results higher airway pressures during mechanical ventilation.

The goals of the present study were two-fold: First, we aimed to compare the total phenotypic, genetic and environmental variances of height, weight and BMI between Caucasians and East Asians using twins. Secondly, we intended to estimate the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to differences in variability of height, weight and BMI between Caucasians and East Asians. Height and weight data from 3735 Caucasian and 1584 East Asian twin pairs (age: 13-15 years) from Australia, China, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States were used for analyses. Maximum likelihood twin correlations and variance components model-fitting analyses were conducted to fulfill the goals of the present study. The absolute genetic variances for height, weight and BMI were consistently greater in Caucasians than in East Asians with corresponding differences in total variances for all three body measures. In all 80 to 100% of the differences in total variances of height, weight and BMI between the two population groups were associated with genetic differences. Height, weight and BMI were more variable in Caucasian than in East Asian adolescents. Genetic variances for these three body measures were also larger in Caucasians than in East Asians. Variance components model-fitting analyses indicated that genetic factors contributed to the difference in variability of height, weight and BMI between the two population groups. Association studies for these body measures should take account of our findings of differences in genetic variances between the two population groups.\n\nGenetic influences on the difference in variability of height, weight and body mass index between Caucasian and East Asian adolescent twins\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHur, Y-M; Kaprio, J; Iacono, WG; Boomsma, DI; McGue, M; Silventoinen, K; Martin, NG; Luciano, M; Visscher, PM; Rose, RJ; He, M; Ando, J; Ooki, S; Nonaka, K; Lin, CCH; Lajunen, HR; Cornes, BK; Bartels, M; van Beijsterveldt, CEM; Cherny, SS; Mitchell, K\n\n2008-01-01\n\nObjective Twin studies are useful for investigating the causes of trait variation between as well as within a population.

Two sets of MCC tablets were used in the study: Set A (training set) consisted of 13 tablets with nominally constant height but varying porosities, whereas Set B (test set) comprised of 21 tablets with nominally constant porosity but different heights. A linear correlation between the estimated absolute weight based on the terahertz measurement and the measured weight of both sets of MCC tablets was found. In addition, it was possible to estimate the height of the tablets by utilizing the estimated absolute weight and calculating the relative change of height of each tablet with respect to an ideal tablet. A good agreement between the experimental and the calculated results was found highlighting the potential of this technique for in-line sensing of the weight, porosity and the relative change in height of the tablets compared to a reference/ideal tablet. In this context, we propose a quantitative quality control method to assess the deviations in porosity of tablets immediately after compaction. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Weight and height were used to calculate W/H relations. The percentage body fat was estimated from skinfold thicknesses and the correlations of adiposity with the various W/H relations were evaluated. The significant increase in percentage body fat (%BF) with increasing age resulted in the development of age group specific regression equations relating %BF to the indices of W/H1.5 and W/H2 (body mass index or Quetelet index). Little difference regarding the qualities of these two indices were detected in terms of poor correlation with height and strong correlation with weight. Thus either may be used with similar levels of confidence. Comparison with other studies, however, would be more easily accomplished if W/H2 were used. In the absence of skinfold thickness measurements the W/H2 could readily be implemented during a routine medical and applied for the estimation of %BF in the offshore population provided that the appropriate regression equation were used and that the limitations of the technique are recognised. Percentage values for W, H, W/H relations, and %BF by age group are provided for comparison with other population studies.

The aim of this study was to construct reference growth curves for height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and head circumference of Colombian children in a format that is useful for following the growth of the individual child and as a tool for public health. Prospective measurements from 27 209 Colombian children from middle and upper socio-economic level families were processed using the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). Descriptive statistics for length and height, weight, BMI and head circumference for age are given as raw and smoothed values. Final height was 172.3 cm for boys and 159.4 cm for girls. Weight at 18 years of age was 64.0 kg for boys and 54 kg for girls. Growth curves are presented in a Â± 3 SD format using logarithmic axes. The constructed reference growth curves are a start for following secular trends in Colombia and are also in the presented layout an optimal clinical tool for health care.

The main aim of the research was to determine the average body height and weight for the current adult population of men 19 to 94 years old and women 19 to 86 years old in the Czech Republic, and to compare the average values ââof body height and weight of the monitored group with the reference values ââfor the adult population observed in our country from 1895 to 2001.Body height and weight were measured with standard anthropometry in 973 men aged 19-94 years and 2,606 women aged 19-86 years. The research was carried out from 2013 to 2015. Statistical tests: t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The average body weight and height of the current adult male is 178.58 cm and 80.86 kg, and of adult female 165.99 cm and 65.67 kg. When compared to men, women show significantly lower average height by 12.59 cm and lower weight by 15.19 kg. The results show that men today are about 10.61 cm higher and weigh 9.01 kilograms more than men in 1895. Todays women are about 9.43 centimeters taller, but weigh 0,58 kg less than women of the same age in 1895.Comparison of results from 1895 to 2015 shows that at present there is likely stagnation or decline in the positive secular trend in body height among men and women. The weight of men is increasing while there is stagnation in the body weight of women.\n\nClimate and the weight/height relationship in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nHiernaux, J; Rudan, P; Brambati, A\n\n1975-01-01\n\n25 populations of the rain forest and 44 of the open country, all descended from the West-Central African stock which lived in the latter biome, are compared for body weight and height. On a log weight/height diagram, the 69 populations cluster along a straight line which intersects the lines of equal body weight/surface ratio: the shorter the body size, the lower the ratio tends to be. The rain forest populations are concentrated in the lower part of the bivariate distribution. The shortest one, the Mbuti Pygmies, has a very low ratio despite a relatively heavy weight. The shorter stature of the rain forest populations seems to be largely genetic in origin; it probably results from selective pressure exerted by the thermal stres in this hot and wet biome where sweating is of low thermolytic efficiency. The amount of reduction of adult stature depends for a large part on the number of generations spent in the forest by the population. Line A (in figure 1) is similar to a growth trend. The 69 populations differ genetically by the target that growth has to reach on a common log weight/height trend line. They achieve this differentiation through different speeds of growth.\n\nSource of parental reports of child height and weight during phone interviews and influence on obesity prevalence estimates among children aged 3-17 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nSkinner, Asheley Cockrell; Miles, Donna; Perrin, Eliana M; Coyne-Beasley, Tamera; Ford, Carol\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe compared parental reports of children's height and weight when the values were estimated vs. parent-measured to determine how these reports influence the estimated prevalence of childhood obesity. In the 2007 and 2008 North Carolina Child Health Assessment and Monitoring Program surveys, parents reported height and weight for children aged 3-17 years. When parents reported the values were not measured (by doctor, school, or home), they were asked to measure their child and were later called back. We categorized body mass index status using standard CDC definitions, and we used Chi-square tests and the Stuart-Maxwell test of marginal homogeneity to examine reporting differences. About 80% (n=509) of the 638 parents who reported an unmeasured height and/or weight participated in a callback and provided updated measures. Children originally classified as obese were subsequently classified as obese (67%), overweight (13%), and healthy weight (19%). An estimated 28% of younger children (<10 years of age) vs. 6% of older children (aged â¥10 years) were reclassified on callback. Having parents who guessed the height and weight of their children and then reported updated values did not significantly change the overall population estimates of obesity. Our findings demonstrate that using parent-reported height and weight values may be sufficient to provide reasonable estimates of obesity prevalence. Systematically asking the source of height and weight information may help improve how it is applied to research of the prevalence of childhood obesity when gold-standard measurements are not available.\n\nCorrection Equations to Adjust Self-Reported Height and Weight for Obesity Estimates among College Students\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMozumdar, Arupendra; Liguori, Gary\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purposes of this study were to generate correction equations for self-reported height and weight quartiles and to test the accuracy of the body mass index (BMI) classification based on corrected self-reported height and weight among 739 male and 434 female college students.

We compared self-reported height and weight with physical measurements from data from a nationally representative sample (n = 1634). Self-reported values were strongly correlated with measured values (Pearson's r: 0.92 and 0.89 for men and women, respectively, for height; 0.96 for both sexes for weight; 0.93 and 0.91 for men and women, respectively, for BMI). The differences in mean values were small. On average, height was overreported by 0.93 cm (SD = 2.48) for men and 1.23 cm (SD = 2.84) for women. Weight was underreported by 1.08 kg (SD = 2.55) for men and 0.88 kg (SD = 2.45) for women. BMI was underestimated by 0.68 kg/m(2) (SD = 1.16) for men and 0.79 kg/m(2) (SD = 1.49) for women. As age increases, height overreporting increased, particularly among women, but weight underreporting decreased for women. BMI underestimation increased for both sexes. Weighted kappa values showed a reasonably high concordance at 0.715 and 0.670 for men and women, respectively (P < 0.0001). Overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9) and obesity (BMI â¥ 30) prevalence rates were underestimated, with better specificity (range: 94.4-100%) than sensitivity (range: 59.3-65.1%). The accuracy of self-reported height and weight is reasonably high among elderly Japanese, suggesting that the information can be used in epidemiological surveys. However, caution should be exercised for the oldest age group (age 85+), as the accuracy declined.

This study was designed as a nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design. The experimental group infants (aged 2-6 months) participated in one of the infant massage programs at the health district center for 4 weeks. The control group (N=26) was paired with the experimental group (N=26) by matching the infant's age and sex. Infant weight, height, and mother-infant interaction were measured two times and recordings of the mother-infant interaction were done using the video equipment in a room at the health center for 10 minutes. After 4 weeks of massage, there were no significant differences weight gain and height increase between the two groups. Comparison of the total scores for the mother-infant interaction between the two groups showed a significant difference (t=5.21, p=.000). There were also significant differences on maternal response (t=3.78, p=000), infant response (t=5.71, p=000) and dyadic response (t=4.05, p=000) in the mother-infant interaction between the two groups. Overall, the results of this study reassure that infant massage facilitates the mother-infant interaction for infants and mothers who give massage to their baby.\n\nRelative importance of expertise, lifting height and weight lifted on posture and lumbar external loading during a transfer task in manual material handling.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlamondon, AndrÃ©; LariviÃ¨re, Christian; Delisle, Alain; Denis, Denys; Gagnon, Denis\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to measure the effect size of three important factors in manual material handling, namely expertise, lifting height and weight lifted. The effect of expertise was evaluated by contrasting 15 expert and 15 novice handlers, the effect of the weight lifted with a 15-kg box and a 23-kg box and the effect of lifting height with two different box heights: ground level and a 32 cm height. The task consisted of transferring a series of boxes from a conveyor to a hand trolley. Lifting height and weight lifted had more effect size than expertise on external back loading variables (moments) while expertise had low impact. On the other hand, expertise showed a significant effect of posture variables on the lumbar spine and knees. All three factors are important, but for a reduction of external back loading, the focus should be on the lifting height and weight lifted. The objective was to measure the effect size of three important factors in a transfer of boxes from a conveyor to a hand trolley. Lifting height and weight lifted had more effect size than expertise on external back loading variables but expertise was a major determinant in back posture.\n\nWeight-to-height ratio and aerobic capacity in 15-year-old male taekwondo martial artists.\n\nPubMed\n\nPoliszczuk, Tatiana; Jankowska, Ewa; Poliszczuk, Dmytro\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMartial arts are growing in popularity throughout the whole world. Their beneficial influence on physical development and fitness is noteworthy. Martial arts are an attractive form of physical recreation, constitute a perfect means for combating stress, and have a positive effect on general health, including during rehabilitation. The aim of this study is to assess physical development and aerobic capacity in boys who practice taekwondo and to determine the relationships between results of a fitness test and particular parameters of physical development. Study participants comparised 51 boys aged 15 years who practiced taekwondo (with training experience ranging from 1 to 6 years). VolkovÂ´s modification of the Harvard Step Test was used to assess body height and body mass. BMI was also calculated. Centile charts were used to assess weight-to-height ratio and the level of measured parameters. BMI was analyzed according to the Cole classification system. Dispersion was calculated using a coefficient of variation. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between selected parameters was also calculated. Most study participants had normal BMI, but 30% showed overweight and 13% showed underweight or emaciation. Weight-to-height ratio differed significantly from the norm in 33% of the boys when compared to centile charts. All participants had average aerobic capacity. However, when weight-to-height ratio was compared to the results of the Harvard Step Test, boys with normal body proportions performed much better in the test than boys with abnormal body mass (p<0.05). Study participants showed abnormal weight-to-height ratio mainly in terms of overweight. The boys had greater body height and body mass compared to the general Polish population. Aerobic capacity differed considerably between participants.\n\n[General growth patterns and simple mathematic models of height and weight of Chinese children].\n\nPubMed\n\nZong, Xin-nan; Li, Hui\n\n2009-05-01\n\nTo explore the growth patterns and simple mathematic models of height and weight of Chinese children. The original data had been obtained from two national representative cross-sectional surveys which were 2005 National Survey of Physical Development of Children (under 7 years of age) and 2005 Chinese National Survey on Students Constitution and Health (6 - 18 years). Reference curves of height and weight of children under 7 years of age was constructed by LMS method, and data of children from 6 to 18 years of age were smoothed by cubic spline function and transformed by modified LMS procedure. Growth velocity was calculated by smoothed values of height and weight. Simple linear model was fitted for children 1 to 10 years of age, for which smoothed height and weight values were used. (1) Birth length of Chinese children was about 50 cm, average length 61 cm, 67 cm, 76 cm and 88 cm at the 3rd, 6th, 12th and 24th month. Height gain was stable from 2 to 10 years of age, average 6 - 7 cm each year. Birth length doubles by 3.5 years, and triples by 12 years. The formula estimating average height of normal children aged 2 - 10 years was, height (cm) = age (yr) x 6.5 + 76 (cm). (2) Birth weight was about 3.3 kg. Growth velocity was at peak about 1.0 - 1.1 kg/mon in the first 3 months, decreased by half and was about 0.5 - 0.6 kg/mon in the second 3 months, and was reduced by a quarter, which was about 0.25 - 0.30 kg/mon, in the last 6 months of the first year. Body mass was up to doubles, triples and quadruple of birth weight at about the 3rd, 12th and 24th month. Average annual gain was about 2 kg and 3 kg from 1 - 6 years and 7 - 10 years, respectively. The estimated formula for children 1 to 6 years of age was weight (kg) = age (yr) x 2 + 8 (kg), but for those 7 - 10 years old, weight (kg) = age (yr) x 3 + 2 (kg). Growth patterns of height and weight at the different age stages were summarized for Chinese children, and simple reference data of height and weight\n\nAccuracy of Self-reported Height and Weight in a Community-Based Sample of Older African Americans and Whites\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKuchibhatla, Maragatha N.; Whitson, Heather E.; Batch, Bryan C.; Svetkey, Laura P.; Pieper, Carl F.; Kraus, William E.; Cohen, Harvey J.; Blazer, Dan G.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground. To ascertain accuracy of self-reported height, weight (and hence body mass index) in African American and white women and men older than 70 years of age. Method. The sample consisted of cognitively intact participants at the third in-person wave (1992â1993) of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (age 71 and older, N = 1761; residents of five adjacent counties, one urban, four rural). During in-person, in-home interviews using trained interviewers, height and weight were self-reported (and measured later in the same visit using a standardized protocol), and information were obtained on race, sex, and age. Results. Accuracy of self-reported height and weight was high (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.85 and 0.97, respectively) but differed as a function of race and age. On average, all groups overestimated their height; whereas (non-Hispanic) white men and women underestimated their weight, African Americans overestimated their weight. Overestimation of height and weight was more marked in persons 85 years and older. Specificity for overweight (body mass index [kg/m2] â¥ 25) and obesity (body mass index â¥ 30) ranged from 0.90 to 0.99 for African Americans and whites, but sensitivity was better for African Americans (overweight: 0.81, obesity: 0.89), than for whites (0.66 and 0.57, respectively). Conclusions. Height and weight self-reported by African Americans and whites over the age of 70 can be used in epidemiological studies, with greater caution needed for self-reports of whites, and of persons 85 years of age or older.

The study assessed the consistency of recorded weight and height on the Food Intake and Physical Activity of School Children (Web-CAAFE) between repeated measures and against directly measured data. Students from the 2nd to the 5th grade (n = 390) had their weight and height directly measured and then filled out the Web-CAAFE. A subsample (n = 92) filled out the Web-CAAFE twice, three hours apart. The analysis included hierarchical linear regression, mixed linear regression model, to evaluate the bias, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), to assess consistency. Univariate linear regression assessed the effect of gender, reading/writing performance, and computer/internet use and possession on residuals of fixed and random effects. The Web-CAAFE showed high values of ICC between repeated measures (body weight = 0.996, height = 0.937, body mass index - BMI = 0.972), and regarding the checked measures (body weight = 0.962, height = 0.882, BMI = 0.828). The difference between means of body weight, height, and BMI directly measured and recorded was 208 g, -2 mm, and 0.238 kg/mÂ², respectively, indicating slight BMI underestimation due to underestimation of weight and overestimation of height. This trend was related to body weight and age. Height and weight data entered in the Web-CAAFE by children were highly correlated with direct measurements and with the repeated entry. The bias found was similar to validation studies of self-reported weight and height in comparison to direct measurements.\n\nRelation between birth weight and weight and height at the age of 2 in children born preterm.\n\nPubMed\n\nOlson, Gayle; Weiner, Steven J; "
