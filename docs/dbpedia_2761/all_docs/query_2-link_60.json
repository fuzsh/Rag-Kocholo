        "text": "As interesting as I find getting a good look at migrating monarch butterflies making their way throughout Northern Illinois on their way South for the winter, I've gotta tell you that learning the reason why they're called \"butterflies\" in the first place is even more intriguing.\n\nThat's what we call a \"tease\" here in the blogging game. Read on to find out if the reason butterflies are called butterflies is actually interesting, or if I'm just trying to get more clicks out of you.\n\nIt might be both.\n\nIt Turns Out That Butterflies Are Named After...Wait For It...Poop (I had another word, but our editors nixed it)\n\nI just learned a few months ago that these letters, TIL, mean \"Today I Learned.\" So, I'll use it here in my explanation of butterflies being named after poop.\n\nAccording to CBC.ca, and backed up by multiple other websites that I visited, TIL:\n\nDutch scientists were studying butterflies, and they took a look at their poop — which is officially called frass.\n\nThey noticed that the droppings looked an awful lot like butter. So they gave the insect the name butterfly.\n\nNot enough proof for you? Here's what TheFactSource.com says about that (keep in mind that their name is the fact source, so it's got to be true):\n\n... the most probable origin of the word butterfly is a biological one. Most butterflies have yellow colored excrements, similar to butter. Dutch language word for butterfly is “boterschijte”, which literally means “butter-pooper” or...(Dutch vulgarity for excrement).\n\nI think we're done here.\n\nWe Only Get About A Week To Catch The Monarch Migration Here In Northern Illinois, And It's Already Started\n\nThere have already been some news stories about swarms of monarchs heading south through Michigan, meaning that those same swarms are making their way to and through our area, on to the Mississippi Valley, through Texas, until finally hitting their winter home in Mexico."
