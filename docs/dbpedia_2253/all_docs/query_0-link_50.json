        "text": "Somebody just got her wings!\n\nVictoria’s Secret announced on Tuesday, April 28, that 10 sexy ladies have been promoted to official Supermodel Angel status—and Us Weekly has an exclusive interview with one! Meet Lais Ribeiro, Brazilian beauty and swimsuit model extraordinaire.\n\n“Anything I’ll say will completely downplay how incredibly excited and honored I am to be representing this iconic brand,” the model, 26, told Us. “It truly is a dream come true!”\n\nBut to Ribeiro, it’s more than just a glamorous job—it’s an opportunity to learn about an empire. “VS has supported me from the beginning. They have instilled confidence, hope, and a strong business sense,” she explained. “When you work this closely with a brand you get a chance to understand a completely different side of the business; it’s inspired me to look at my opportunity differently.”\n\nThanks to Victoria’s Secret’s impressive roster of leading ladies through the years, Ribeiro’s been able to learn from the best—some of whom hail from her home country. “Adriana Lima and Gisele Bundchen [are my favorite Angels]. They are both Brazilians who have accomplished so much in their careers, and it all started with Victoria’s Secret,” she said. “They are determined businesswomen, role models, and icons.”\n\nAs for maintaining the Angels’ trademark—a bombshell physique—Ribeiro confessed that she has a little secret. “I am constantly changing my exercise routines. It can be anything from boxing to yoga,” Ribeiro shared. “But I also have a 7-year-old son [Alexander], and keeping up with him is a workout!”"
