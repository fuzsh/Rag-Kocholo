        "text": "The new store opens its doors in Buchanan Street tomorrow.\n\nLais, 27, has been part of the fashion brand's angels since 2015 and here is what she had to say about the experience.\n\nWhat is Victoria's Secret?\n\nI get that question a lot. I’m actually not sure – who knows if we’ll ever know!\n\nWhat do you love about being an angel?\n\nVictoria’s Secret completely changed my career. Being an angel, I’ve become so close with the whole team and the other girls. I’ve also had the opportunity to travel the world with the brand – it’s been a dream.\n\nWhat are your top glamour tips for wannabe angels?\n\nMy biggest glamour tip would be to find your personal style. Everyone is different – whether you’re a jeans and t-shirt girl or a cocktail dress and heels girls – wear what makes you feel good.\n\nHow do you know if you're wearing the right fitting bra?\n\nThere are a few signs that you’re wearing the right fitting bra, but ultimately your bra should be comfortable. If it is too tight or too loose in areas, you likely need a different fit. That’s why it’s so important to get refit at Victoria’s Secret!\n\nWhat's your go-to style?\n\nIt depends – I like to mix it up. Sometimes I love a cute jumpsuit or dress, and sometimes I love a pair of boyfriend jeans and cool sneakers.\n\nWhat’s you're best tip for finding the perfect push up bra?\n\nMy best tip would be to make sure to try out different styles and colors. Victoria’s Secret has such an amazing selection, it’s almost impossible to not find the perfect push up bra for you.\n\nHow many underwear sets do you own?\n\nToo many to count! Victoria’s Secret spoils me\n\nHow often do you go for a bra fitting?\n\nEvery six months – women’s bodies are always changing so it’s important to do regularly\n\nHave you visited Scotland before?\n\nNo, but I’d love to go!"
