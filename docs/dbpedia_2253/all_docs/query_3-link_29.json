        "text": "In her second Victoria's Secret Fashion Show since earning her Angel wings in 2015, Lais Ribeiro looked beyond incredible.\n\nThe 26-year-old Brazilian model, who shared Instagram snippets of her time in Paris leading up to the show, stunned in pieces that flattered her slender figure on the runway, including one seriously colorful number and a black tree-inspired look, leaving us breathless.\n\nPOPSUGAR caught up with Lais at the Fifth Avenue VS store a few days before the show's Dec. 5 air date, where she opened up about her emotions on the runway. \"I saw [my family] on the way, and I was like 'OK, just focus, you're not going to cry on the way there.' But on the way back, I think you're allowed to do it,\" she told us. \"I tried to control myself, but I cried on the runway!\"\n\nAnd just because she's an Angel, don't think she's immune to feeling starstruck. Lais, like us, was living for Lady Gaga's appearance. \"I always liked her, but when she walked on the runway with that red dress — she's such an amazing performer. Her voice is insane,\" she gushed, detailing the mini meet-and-greet Gaga had with the models backstage. \"She came up to us, she gave us flowers, she gave us sweets. We had a whole table set up of sweets and it was her idea. She gave me a flower — she gave me a flower — and was, like, hugging me. She was really nice.\"\n\nKeep scrolling to zoom in on Lais's outfits, then admire her fellow Brazilian Alessandra Ambrosio's jaw-dropping moments."
