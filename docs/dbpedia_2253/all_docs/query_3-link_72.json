        "text": "Brazilian fashion is making a push for representation, per a new runway quota led by São Paulo Fashion Week and the organisation Blacks in Fashion. Models of African, Indigenous and/or Asian descent must make up at least 50 per cent of São Paulo Fashion Week runways going forward, starting with last week’s event, from a prior 10 per cent target.\n\nThe decision, announced on 30 October, seeks to establish more racial diversity during fashion events and reinforce a commitment to inclusivity for the industry. Should brands not meet the requirements, they may be suspended from the event, now in its 25th year, which ran from 4 to 8 November.\n\nAbout 57 per cent of Brazilians identify as non-white, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Some 9.3 per cent of the population calls itself Black, while 46.5 per cent identify as pardo, or mixed Indigenous or Black with any other race. But non-white models in Brazil say representation in the country has lagged, and that they more easily find work abroad than at home.\n\n“We are behind the times,” says Michelle Ferreira, head booker at agency Mega Model Brasil. “It’s a deep issue. It’s structural racism. This is a super important act, changing the look of fashion. And it’s not just about fashion, it’s about society as a whole.”\n\nRepresentation on runways has been a global effort for fashion, including in the major fashion capitals of Paris, Milan, London and New York. The Fashion Spot’s Diversity Report found that 41.5 per cent of the models on runways in major cities for the Autumn/Winter 2020 season were non-white, a 1 per cent decline from Spring/Summer 2020. Between 2015 and 2020, representation of models of colour had increased year over year. Critics have said that while representation matters, racial diversity on runways is mostly symbolic, and doesn’t represent significant systemic change for the fashion industry.\n\nModel Elen Santiago, who has been in the business for eight years, says she has struggled to book jobs, claiming there are limited opportunities for Black models, particularly those with darker skin. “The lighter the skin, and the finer the traces of the face, the easier it is to get hired. For years we’ve been crying out for change, not just in fashion, but across society,” Santiago says in a phone interview. “We are more than half of the population and we don’t see ourselves represented.”\n\nHer hope is that the need for quotas will be brief, and that the move will lead to longer lasting change in representation.\n\nAt São Paulo Fashion Week, Black models were much more visible than in years past, when generally only 10 per cent of models were non-white, as per a quota from over 10 years ago. Santiago attributes the shift to the external mandate. Designers who showed runway collections had to comply with the quota, including Amir Slama, Lilly Sarti, Angela Brito and Gloria Coelho. Defenders of racial quotas argue that race-conscious remedies are needed to significantly reduce Brazil’s racial inequality, according to Edward Telles, a sociology professor at UCLA.\n\nAgencies say they’ve been doing their part in finding models of various races, and there is no shortage of talent. But as models’ careers advance, they often leave Brazil, says Rafael Neves, who manages public relations for Mega Model Brasil, adding that demand abroad is greater than domestic demand.\n\n“What will change now is that we will have more opportunities for the market to absorb these models, who often wouldn’t let themselves dream of this career because they didn’t believe there would be the space for them,” Anderson Baumgartner, chief executive officer at agency WAY Model Management, wrote in an email. “Now they are a part of it.”\n\nMega’s Ferreira knows intimately the importance of being represented in the mainstream. She is Black, and grew up without seeing anyone who looked like her on television. “Why do you think you’re pretty, where is your self-esteem going to be, if you don’t see yourself?” Ferreira says.\n\nBlack Brazilians are now represented more on TV, in movies and in magazines, but the country still grapples with institutional racism. Television and advertising portray Brazilian society as one that is almost entirely white, but it’s only the middle class that is largely Caucasian, meaning lower-income non-whites are disproportionately excluded, Telles says.\n\n“If we don’t change this, society will continue in the same way,” Ferreira says.\n\nWith the fashion week quotas, “we can pressure the market and influence clients to use talents that are racially representative, and that should have their places guaranteed”, says Liliana Gomes, who owns Joy Model Management, in an email. “After all, there are so many beautiful people, waiting just for an opportunity to work and be noticed for their differences.”\n\nTo receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.\n\nComments, questions or feedback?
