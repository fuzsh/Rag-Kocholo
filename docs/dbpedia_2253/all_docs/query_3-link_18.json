        "text": "LAIS RIBEIRO(pronounced Lie-ees) may not be Victoria's Secret's most famous Brazilian (she has some competition on that front from veterans including Alessandra Ambrosio and Adriana Lima), but she's certainly a contender for having the most diverse CV of shows under her belt. As well as stepping onto the catwalk for almost every major brand so far in her career, she also holds the dubious accolade of being the only Victoria's Secret model to be named for the show and then fail to appear. It was later revealed that she sprained her ankle backstage ahead of the 2012 show, but was back for 2013. Ahead of this year's event - which she will appear in as long as there are no mishaps - look back at her catwalk career so far."
