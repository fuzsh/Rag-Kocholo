        "text": "KNOWN for being one of the world’s most booked catwalk stars, she’s a natural choice to grace the Victoria’s Secret catwalk.\n\nLais Ribeiro has been working towards her impressive modelling career since she was 18-years-old, a year after giving birth to her first child.\n\nWho is Lais Ribeiro? How long has she been modelling for Victoria’s Secret?\n\nLais has featured on campaigns for the luxury lingerie brand since 2010.\n\nNot only did she star in the 2011 Christmas advert, she also promoted the 2012 Valentine’s Day collection with supermodels Candice Swanepoel and Adriana Lima.\n\nAfter spraining her ankle during the rehearsals for the 2012 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, Lais had no option but to step down from the role.\n\nTo make up for her injury, the iconic lingerie company cast her in the Birds of Paradise segment the following year.\n\nFollowing her extensive contribution to the brand, she was finally made a Victoria’s Secret Angel in 2015.\n\nIs Lais Ribeiro wearing the Victoria's Secret fantasy bra?\n\nThis year the stunning model has been gifted with the honour of wearing the £1.5million Victoria's Secret fantasy bra and she isn't taking it lightly.\n\nMaking the most of the privilege, the Brazilian beauty posed with the coveted lingerie ahead of her moment on the runway for the brand's annual fashion show.\n\nThis year's design, called the \"Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra\", is made of diamonds, yellow sapphires and blue topaz.\n\nAccording to People, the lingerie weighs in at over 600 carats and took around 350 hours to make.\n\nRecalling the moment she was asked to wear the bra, Lais told the magazine: \"I never cried so much in my entire life - and I have a baby!\n\nHow did Lais Ribeiro become a Victoria’s Secret model?\n\nJust like her fellow Angel Alessandra Ambrosio, Lais came from humble beginnings.\n\nThe runway regular, who was born in Teresina, a remote rural town in Brazil, never considered becoming a model until she was 18-years-old.\n\nAfter she gave birth her son Alexandre eight years ago, one of Lais’ friends asked her if she’d ever considered working in the fashion industry.\n\nRemarkably, the model was rejected by a number of different agencies who had her handing out flyers because she wasn’t deemed curvy enough.\n\nIt wasn’t until Lais won a modelling competition in Brazil that her career finally took off.\n\nShe showed-off major design labels designs on the runway in 2010, including Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Versace.\n\nAt Fashion Week in Brazil, the 5’11’’ Victoria’s Secret stunner impressed casting agents so much that she was booked for over FIFTY shows.\n\nShe starred in a record-breaking 27 shows in Sao Paulo and 26 in Rio.\n\nWhere else could you have spotted Lais Ribeiro?\n\nIt’s not just catwalk modelling that the Victoria's Secret Angel specialises in, as she has also graced the front cover of a number of popular magazines.\n\nHer print repertoire includes international editions of Vogue, Elle and Harper’s Bazaar.\n\nPhotos of Lais have also been splashed across campaigns of renowned retail giants.\n\nShe has worked with high-end brands, including Ralph Lauren and Tom Ford, and high-street stores Gap and American Eagle."
