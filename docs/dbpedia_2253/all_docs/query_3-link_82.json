        "text": "What's sexier than a Victoria's Secret Angel? A Victoria's Secret Angel making out with her new fiancé and crowing about it on Instagram for the rest of the world to hear! Since I am, as you know, deeply passionate about sexiness, let's go ahead and celebrate this wicked awesome engagement (I'm allowed to say wicked, I'm from Rhode Island). Who is Joakim Noah? He's the NBA star who proposed to legendary VS Angel, Lais Ribeiro! Check out how he popped the question and what he has planned for the wedding.\n\n1. Congrats You Two!\n\nBreak out the celebratory bridal bikini options and dust off those massive wings because there's a Victoria's Secret Angel who is about to start her plans to walk down the aisle! On social media, Angel Lais Ribeiro and her boyfriend NBA player Joakim Noah are finally engaged! The couple who has been an item for a few years now got engaged to each other while they were attending this year's Burning Man, a festival that is near and dear to Lais' heart. The model, who is 28-years-old, announced that she and Noah made the dang thing official when he proposed to her during their festival getaway. She finally shared the news on (where else) Instagram and the well wishes started pouring in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Lais Shares The News\n\nYou can practically hear her squeals through the screen when you read the caption she composed to share the big news. “I’m a bit late for Burning Man pics and of course I didn’t touch my phone for 5 days and I don’t have a single pic but thanks to my Bff @jeromeduran he captured one of the best moments in my life! [Noah] surprised me at my fav place in the world and proposed,” she said. “And I couldn’t be happier! We are getting married guys,\" shared the ecstatic Lais. In addition to working full-time as a model, Lais also has another super important job. She's the mom to an 11-year-old son named Alexandre, and now it looks like thanks to Noah, her family will be getting even bigger.\n\n3. That Magic Moment\n\nIn the photo that Lais shared that goes with the caption sharing her announcement, you can tell that Lais has just said yes to Noah. You can also tell that the couple was definitely at Burning Man because she is clad mostly in mesh and neon colors and wearing pasties as a shirt: this is the Burning Man way. Noah himself replied to her announcement with his own joy and made sure that all her fans know that as long as he's around she'll always have someone in her corner. \"Seeing you smiling on the playa like that...I will never forget. I got your back always picanha. C toi ma femme [You are my wife] and I knew that from the minute we started dating. Jtaime tellement [I love you so much],\" he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. How Noah Saw It\n\nWhile Noah might be a professional basketball player, that doesn't mean he doesn't understand romance (I mean, hello, a proposal at Burning Man in a private playa is just about as romantic as it gets if you're into that kind of thing). He was over the moon with how well his proposal to Lais went and it wasn't too long before he too was sharing his own sweet notes about the woman he plans to make his wife along with a few touching photos from the festival itself. \"Proposing to you was the easiest decision of my life,” he wrote in a note that was for all to see. As public as it was, it still felt shockingly intimate. It's clear that these two are totally crazy about each other.\n\n5. Getting Ready To Wed\n\nThe sweet photos that Noah shares of he and Lais are almost so sugar-rich they'll give you diabetes. In one, they couple shares a tender smooch and in another they pose simply together, smiling while they take a selfie. \"I got your back picanha!!! I know you know because I tell you everyday. I love u.” In addition to being eager to share his love for Lais with the world, there's something else about to go down that Noah seems incredibly excited to get planning: their totally epic wedding. \"On another note,\" he added to the same post on Instagram, \"This wedding is about to be lit.\" Fingers crossed that this enthusiasm doesn't actually mean that Noah will become a groomzilla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Noah's Wordly Streak\n\nJoakim may not be a Victoria's Secret Angel, but that doesn't mean he's physically any slouch! The guy, remember, is a professional basketball player. While he is not currently playing for any team, he made a serious impact when he last played for the Memphis Grizzlies. He's a powerful player and an asset to any team, and that's not the only thing that makes him worthy of a partner like Lais. See, unlike a lot of guys, Noah is cultured as heck and it all started at birth. While Noah himself was actually born in New York City (about as red white and blue as they come) his father is French and his mother is Swedish. That means that he has citizenship in America, Sweden, and France!\n\nRebecca Jane Stokes is a writer living in Brooklyn, New York with her cats, Batman and Margot.
