        "text": "Swimsuit supermodel Lais Ribeiro is no stranger to the Victoria’s Secret runway, having appeared in the 2010, 2011 and 2013 VS Fashion Shows. However, up until now the Piauí native had not signed an official Angel contract with the brand. This year, however, Ribeiro joined the exclusive list of models who have been awarded Supermodel Angel status. It’s easy to view this as just another contract, but being awarded their wings has been the jumpstart to some of the worlds most famous supermodels careers, including Gisele, Adriana Lima, Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks and Miranda Kerr.\n\nThis isn’t to say that Ribeiro’s career hasn’t been filled with success up to this point. The 24 year old has appeared in American, Brazilian, German, and Italian Vogue, and featured in ad campaigns for Ralph Lauren, Dior, and Tom Ford. She’s walked in shows for many exclusive brands including Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Gucci, and Marc Jacobs. On top of these already impressive facts, Ribeiro was the most booked model in the Brazilian fashion weeks of 2011, appearing a total of 53 shows.\n\nHowever even with such a successful career, becoming an Angel is a huge accomplishment for any model. When Ribeiro spoke to Us Weekly about her new contract, she spoke of her Brazilian peers and their success with Victoria’s Secret. “Adriana Lima and Gisele Bundchen (are my favorite Angels). They are both Brazilians who have accomplished so much in their careers, and it all started with Victoria’s Secret. They are determined businesswomen, role models, and icons.”\n\nWe expect Lais Ribeiro to have every success in this new career move, for which we at Amazuna wish her the best of luck!"
