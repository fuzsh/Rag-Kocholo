        "text": "\\n\n\nWhat makes you feel sexy and confident?\n\nI'm a huge fan of Victoria's Secret, even before I became a model! I love Body by Victoria in lace, and I guess everyone else does too. It's always sold out. My boyfriend loves it when I buy new bras. When I feel confident on the inside, it shows on the outside.\n\nWhat is your exercise routine?\n\nI go to the gym everyday. I do my own exercises like aerobics and yoga, which work your whole body.\n\nWhat do you like most about being Latina and what does it mean to you?\n\nI love the music of Brazil. In my city we dance forró, its like merengue or salsa. I also love the fashion and emotion of being in my city.\n\nWhat is your favorite childhood memory from Brazil?\n\nMy home, I have a baby and every time I'm there I am happy and with my family. That is the best place and the best memories always with my family, my city, my old friends.\n\nIs there any advice you would offer to aspiring models?\n\nI look at Adriana Lima and Candice Swanepoel and they are my inspiration. Youhave to be strong, it is hard to do so many things at the same time, it is a lot of work.\n\nIs there anything you wish you could tell your teenage self?\n\nLearn something new everyday from all of the different people you meet; experience life you have to be open to learning more."
