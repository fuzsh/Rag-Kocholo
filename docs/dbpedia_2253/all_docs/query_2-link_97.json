        "text": "It's November and that means two things are around the corner -- the holiday season, and the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\n\nLais Ribeiro, a Victoria's Secret Angel since 2015, is one of those timeless beauties that you know will be in the spotlight for years to come -- and when we got to see behind-the-scenes of her fitting for this year's show in Paris, we understood why the brand loves her so much.\n\nWearing a look from the first segment of show, \"The Road Ahead,\" Lais positively glowed in the colorful, cultural ensemble. Featuring a \"deconstructed shrug\" of vibrant embroidered fabrics, everyone in the room ooh-ed and aah-ed when she stepped out in the colorful look.\n\nThe artisans behind the look are calling the elements of the shrug \"strips of culture,\" and the panels are truly worldly -- inspired by the likes of Peruvian, Mexican, and Chinese design.\n\nWhen we asked Lais how this look makes her feel, she couldn't stop gushing about how fun it is. \"This one is very playful, very colorful... it's beautiful. It's about different cultures and thats why it has so many colors involved -- it's a little bit of everything.\"\n\nAnd can we talk about those red boots? Amazing.\n\nSee more photos from her fitting:\n\nAs you may have heard, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is taking place in Paris this year -- and everyone is so. excited. about. it. (Including us).\n\n\"Paris is the capital of fashion! It's a very sexy city, very elegant, so I'm very excited,\" Lais told us. And while she never has too much free time in Paris, often being there for work, she still loves the city and the ability to explore.\n\n\"I love the Eiffel Tower,\" she said, \"It's so beautiful during the night when the lights come up, it's very romantic.\"\n\nWe wondered what people might not know about the Brazilian beauty, and she joked that her fans pretty much know everything about her. \"We're very public people!\"\n\nBut the one thing you might not know? She has an eight-year-old son. \"I think a lot of people maybe don't know that I'm a mom, because I'm young.\" She had her son, Alexandre, just before becoming a model in her home country of Brazil.\n\nThe models walking in this year's show include fellow Angels Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Lily Aldridge, Elsa Hosk, Jasmine Tookes (wearing the $3 million Bright Night Fantasy Bra), Josephine Skriver, Martha Hunt, Romee Strijd, Sara Sampaio, Stella Maxwell and Taylor Hill, as well as 37 other world-renowned models, including Karlie Kloss, Bella and Gigi Hadid. It truly is the most famous fashion show in the world -- it will be watched by millions of people in over 190 countries.\n\nWhile we're seeing snippets and getting insights into the show in these weeks leading up to the broadcast, it's been in the works for months, with artisans building wings and meticulously designing their sparkling creations. And that's one thing Lais thinks the world needs to understand -- just how much work goes into everything you'll see on December 5th.\n\n\"People think it's so easy, that it's 'just a model, walking in the show for like 2 seconds,' but it's the most important seconds of our lives.\"\n\nAnd that moment on the runway isn't something she takes for granted, either.\n\n\"I always get very emotional, because we compete with so many good models ... so being there is very important. It's very special.\"\n\nMore about this year's show:\n\nLady Gaga, Bruno Mars and The Weeknd set to perform at 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show\n\nBella Hadid to make her VS Fashion Show debut\n\nVS Angel Jasmine Tookes will wear the 2016 Fantasy Bra -- valued at $3 million\n\nVictoria's Secret heads to Paris for 2016 Fashion Show\n\nAlso, see the best photos from last year's show in New York City:\n\nPhotos: Kelsey Driscoll for AOL"
