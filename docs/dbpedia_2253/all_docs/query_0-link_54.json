        "text": "Whether you’re looking to add some volume and vitality back to your hair or you’ve been suffering from hair loss, it’s likely you’ve considered the best vitamins for hair growth. According to Dr. Hardik Doshi, lead surgeon in hair restoration at Ample, it’s important to first understand that hair loss can stem from many factors, including nutrition. The initial approach should involve addressing any deficiencies through a well-rounded diet packed with essential vitamins and minerals to support hair growth and prevent excessive shedding. “If considering supplements, consulting a healthcare professional is advisable to assess requirements, potential risks, and how they may interact with existing health conditions or medications,” he says. However, if all checks out and you’re looking for a new vitamin to add to your medicine cabinet, keep reading for some of our expert-approved recommendations.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nBest Overall: Nutrafol Hair Growth Supplements, $79\n\nBest Gummy: Vegamour Gro Biotin Gummies, $34\n\nBest for Digestion: Wellbel Clean Supplement for Hair, Skin, and Nails, $65\n\nBest With Biotin: Grande Cosmetics Vegan Collagen Hair Vitamin Gummies, $30\n\nBest With Probiotics: Love Wellness Healthy Hair Probiotics, $17\n\nBest for Stress-Related Hair Loss: Divi Hair Vitamins, $61\n\nBest for Hair Restoration: Viviscal Hair Growth Supplements, $32\n\nIn This Story\n\nWhat are hair growth vitamins/do they actually work?\n\nWhat vitamins/ingredients are good for thinning hair?\n\nWho should take these supplements & what is the best way to consume?\n\nWhich vitamin deficiency may cause hair loss\n\nAre there any side effects to be aware of?\n\nMeet the Experts\n\nBest Overall: Nutrafol Hair Growth Vitamins\n\nHair Growth Supplements\n\nWhy we like it: When discussing hair growth, Nutrafol almost always comes up in conversation as the brand is recommended by many of the leading dermatologists. “Nutrafol is plant-based and science-backed. It gives you the building blocks for hair growth but also affects other systems that affect hair growth and well-being,” says board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Jennifer Gordon. There are multiple formulations tailored for men, women, different age groups, and life experiences, like post-partum. The women's formula, here, is clinically tested to deliver the necessary vitamins, minerals, and natural ingredients women age 18 to 44 keen to address hair thinning.\n\nHow to Use It: Take four capsules once daily.\n\nWhen to Expect Results: Visible results in three to six months\n\nKey Ingredients: Saw palmetto, ashwagandha, organic maca root\n\nBest Gummy: Vegamour Biotin Supplement\n\nVegamour Gro\n\nBiotin Gummies\n\nWhy we like it: Vegamour’s shampoos, conditioners, and styling products aren’t just our favorites for promoting healthy hair; they also offer supplements in both gummy and powder forms. According to Dr. Gordon, these biotin gummies are “natural, vegan, and contain MCT oil, which is excellent for stress relief and antioxidant properties. They are easy to take (just once daily) and are designed to be clean.” Plus, they’re strawberry flavored for those who prefer a delicious gummy versus a pill or capsule.\n\nHow to Use It: Take one gummy daily.\n\nWhen to Expect Results: Visible results in three to four months\n\nKey Ingredients: Biotin, folic acid, vitamins A, B-5, C, E , 6 and 12\n\nBest for Digestion: Wellbel Vegan Hair Growth Supplement\n\nWellbel\n\nClean Supplement for Hair, Skin, and Nails\n\nWhy we like it: According to functional nutrition and women’s hormone expert Alisa Vitti, Wellbel’s herbal blend incorporates herbs such as saw palmetto, which are particularly beneficial for women dealing with androgenic-related hair loss issues. However, she explains that what sets it apart is the inclusion of Betaine HCL, supporting protein absorption in individuals with low stomach acid. This condition, more common than many realize, serves as a root cause for various symptoms, including peeling nails, poor hair growth, anxiety, difficulty digesting meals containing animal protein, belching and bloating after meals, and an expanding list of food sensitivities. “If you suspect you have low stomach acid, Wellbel would be a good choice,” she says.\n\nHow to Use It: Take three capsules once daily.\n\nWhen to Expect Results: Visible results within 90 days\n\nKey Ingredients: Saw palmetto fruit extract, Stinging nettle leaf, PABA Betaine HCI\n\nBest With Biotin: Grande Cosmetics Vegan Collagen Gummies\n\nWhy we like it: Not only are these vegan collagen gummies adorable pink hearts, but you’ll enjoy taking them because they’re simply delicious. They primarily consist of biotin (vitamin B7) and collagen, which, according to Dr. Doshi, “could enhance skin and hair health.” However, he doesn’t recommend taking more than the allotted amount per day. “While biotin contributes to the health of hair and nails, excessive intake may not provide advantages beyond meeting requirements.”\n\nHow to Use It: Take two gummies daily, with or without food.\n\nWhen to Expect Results: 45 days\n\nKey Ingredients: Biotin, Folic Acid, Vitamin C, Zinc\n\nBest Probiotic: Love Wellness Healthy Hair Probiotics\n\nHealthy Hair Probiotics\n\nWhy we like it: This supplement isn’t just packed with probiotics; it also includes Vitamins B12, B6, and the favorite of many: biotin. While further research is needed to fully understand the role of probiotics in combating hair loss, this probiotic formula contains AnaGain Nu, a clinically-tested protein meant to target underlying causes of hair loss, including hormones, environmental factors, stress-related hair loss, et etc.\n\nHow to Use It: Take one capsule daily with or without food.\n\nWhen to Expect Results: 4-8 weeks of daily use.\n\nKey Ingredients: Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6, Biotin.\n\nBest for Stress-Related Hair Loss: Divi Hair Vitamins\n\nWhy we like it: Sometimes, it takes more than collagen powder and prayers to enhance the strength and health of your hair. Enter these vitamins from Divi, which feature a blend of KSM-66 ashwagandha root extract and a complex of arginine silicate and magnesium biotinate to boost your hair health. And if you’re particular about what you put in your body (fair enough!), these are free from dairy, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, sesame, wheat, and gluten.\n\nHow to Use It: Take four capsules daily with food.\n\nWhen to Expect Results: After 90 days of consistent use.\n\nKey Ingredients: KSM-66 Ashwagandha Root Extract,Arginine Silicate, Magnesium Biotinate\n\nBest for Hair Restoration: Viviscal Hair Growth Supplements\n\nWhy we like it: Viviscal Hair Growth Supplements are renowned for their potent blend of minerals, vitamins, and nutrients purported to bolster hair growth. Dr. Doshi elaborates, “Ingredients such as biotin, iron, zinc, vitamin C, and a marine protein complex present in Viviscal are thought to promote hair health.” Additionally, clinical studies have been conducted to support claims of thicker, fuller hair.\n\nHow to Use It: Take two pills daily.\n\nWhen to Expect Results: After 90 days of consistent use.\n\nKey Ingredients: Zinc, vitamin C, iron, and niacin\n\nWhat are hair growth vitamins and do they actually work?\n\nHair growth is very complicated, dependent on each individual’s situation, and often requires a multimodal approach. According to Dr. Gordon, “[The best vitamins for hair growth] are definitely helpful, and if you are deficient in any of the amino acids, omega acids, or other vitamins, then they are necessary to provide you with the building blocks to grow hair.” She continues, many hair growth gummies and capsules also contain plant extracts and other natural ingredients that can mimic some pharmaceutical hair growth medications as well as provide novel mechanisms for hair growth. Some can also help with hormonal changes, stress, and other ailments.\n\nHowever, as Vitti explains, taking more micronutrients doesn’t always lead to more hair growth for two main reasons: first, the body gets rid of what it can’t use, and second, people with gut issues might have trouble absorbing nutrients properly. Plus, results can take a long time—think three to six months to notice any real change. It’s also so difficult to be stuck in the cycle of stress and hair loss (which causes more stress), so make sure you look at your overall wellness and health if you choose to add these vitamins into your diet.\n\nWhat vitamins and ingredients are good for thinning hair?\n\nAccording to Dr. Gordon, iron and vitamin D are among the most common deficiencies observed in hair loss, along with vitamin Bs and amino acids (protein). Some ingredients she recommends include:"
