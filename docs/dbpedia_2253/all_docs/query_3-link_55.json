        "text": "Lais Ribeiro says getting her Victoria’s Secret wings is a “dream come true” and is “incredibly excited” to have been given the brand’s highest honour.\n\nThe 26-year-old model – who was announced as one of the lingerie giant’s new Angels earlier this week after walking in their catwalk show last year – admitted she was “incredibly excited” to have been given the brand’s highest honour.\n\nShe said: “Anything I’ll say will completely downplay how incredibly excited and honoured I am to be representing this iconic brand.\n\n“It truly is a dream come true!\n\n“VS has supported me from the beginning. They have instilled confidence, hope, and a strong business sense. When you work this closely with a brand you get a chance to understand a completely different side of the business; it’s inspired me to look at my opportunity differently.”\n\nThe brunette beauty – who hails from Brazil – is hoping to follow in the footsteps of fellow Brazilian Angels Adriana Lima and Gisele Bundchen and counts them as her favourite VS models of all time.\n\nShe said: “Adriana Lima and Gisele Bundchen [are my favourite Angels]. They are both Brazilians who have accomplished so much in their careers, and it all started with Victoria’s Secret. They are determined businesswomen, role models, and icons.”\n\nLais also shared the secret behind her enviable figure and credits constantly changing her exercise regime and running around after her seven-year-old son, Alexander, for helping her to stay slim.\n\nShe told Us Weekly: “I am constantly changing my exercise routines. It can be anything from boxing to yoga. But I also have a 7-year-old son and keeping up with him is a workout!”\n\nOther models to have been promoted to the rank of Angel include Elsa Hosk, Sara Sampaio, Stella Maxwell, Kate Grigorieva, Taylor Hill, Martha Hunt, Jac Jagaciak, Romee Strijd and Jasmine Tookes.\n\nWant more breaking celebrity news?
