They included social media celebrities like Kendall Jenner, GiGi and Bella Hadid and Adriana Lima, who took her final walk after 18 years with the show.\n\nAccording to Vogue, last year about a billion people worldwide watched the show.\n\nVictoria's Secret CMO Ed Razek says the show is promoting a fantasy. But critics say it markets unreasonable body images and a lack of diversity to young girls, women and men.\n\nWhat does Victoria's Secret — and the lingerie industry at large — tell us about femininity and gender? And how does the #MeToo movement play into all this?"
