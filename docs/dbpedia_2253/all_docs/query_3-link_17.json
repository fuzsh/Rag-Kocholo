        "text": "In large part due to the Olympic Games in Rio, all things Brazilian are on our minds right now. The beautiful South American country is no stranger to the beauty and fashion industries, as some of the world’s top designers and models call it home. Lais Ribeiro is one such supermodel—hailing from Teresina, the capital of Piauí.\n\nIt’s been a hectic couple of years for Ribeiro: She received wings as a Victoria’s Secret Angel and become the face of accessories brand Bottletop. But personal accomplishments aside, Ribeiro couldn’t be prouder of her country’s involvement in the Olympic games. “It’s definitely an exciting time for Brazil and Brazilians, and such an honor after hosting the World Cup!”\n\nWe spoke with Ribeiro between her busy schedule to gather details on her skin-care routine and her favorite haunts in the country just in time for the Olympics.\n\nRELATED: Here's Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Brazilian Waxes\n\nRibeiro’s Skin-Care Routine:Ribeiro starts by washing her face with Burt’s Bees Orange Essence Facial Cleanser. “That’s followed by L’Oréal Paris HydraFresh Toner and then either L’Oréal Paris’s Youth Code Skin Recharger moisturizer or Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream.” She loves them both for balancing her skin tone and hydration. “Also, Babassu oil from the Babassu palm is great for moisturizing the skin and keeping it hydrated.”\n\nRibeiro’s Must-Try Brazilian Beauty Tips:\n\nAlways stay moisturized and hydrated.Ribeiro stays hydrated with plenty of water—and when she’s in Brazil, she drowns herself in fresh coconut water and moisturizer. \"I have oily skin, and you would think that I would stay away from moisturizing when I’m in Brazil, but I found that by not doing so, my skin would become oilier,” said Ribeiro. “It turns out that my skin produces less oil when it’s properly hydrated and moisturized.”\n\nPigmented lipsticks are the keys to summery pops of color.For an effortless pop of seasonal color, Ribeiro relies on pigmented lipsticks. “It’s a pretty easy look and won’t wear off.” Tom Ford has an array of shades that fit the bill.\n\nNever leave home without sunscreen.“I swear by any product with SPF,” adds Ribeiro. “Being naturally tanned, the chances of [me] getting burned are rarer than my fair-skinned friends, but the sun is brutal on the skin—regardless of your pigment—so I always use products with coverage.” Lip moisturizers with SPF are among her absolute must-haves. “I think most of us forget that our lips can get burned and dry out too.”\n\nUse powder minimally.Brazilians aren’t crazy about powder because it can easily cake up in the country’s very warm and humid climate. “We accept our ‘summer glow’ and rock it,” explains Ribeiro. “However, I will dust minimal powder on my forehead, around my nose and on my chin if necessary.” We like Iman Perfect Response Oil Blotting Pressed Powder.\n\nHave blotting papers handy at all times.“Blotting papers are truly our secret weapon,” reveals Ribeiro. “I like to use blotting papers or even tissue wrapped around a small puff to blot sweat and oil from my skin.”\n\nBest Places to Visit in Brazil:\n\nD.O.M\n\nR. Barão de Capanema, 549 - Jardins, São Paulo - SP, 01411-011, Brazil\n\n“This restaurant specializes in Brazilian fusion, which is super delicious.”\n\nBolinha\n\nAv. Cidade Jardim, 53 - Jardins, São Paulo - SP, 01453-000, Brazil\n\n“You’ll get typical Brazilian dishes here that all taste homemade.” Bar Numero\n\nR. da Consolação, 3585 - Jardins, São Paulo - SP, 01416-001, Brazil\n\n“This is one of my favorite bars. Their drink specialty is gin and tonic.”"
