        "text": "Less than a month until the Angels jet off to Shanghai for the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, we finally know who will be wearing the legendary Fantasy Bra. Drumroll, please…. It's Lais Ribeiro!\n\nThe 27-year-old Brazilian model, who officially became an Angel in 2015 but has been working with the brand since 2010, was selected to wear the 2017 \"Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra.\" The news was revealed via a pretty hilarious Vogue video: In it, Ribeiro excitedly awaits her big announcement shoot, only to have it keep getting delayed; she passes the time by helping out and taking care of errands on set. (Yes, apparently you can go about your everyday, mundane tasks while wearing an embellished, multimillion-dollar bra.)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe \"Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra,\" which is valued at $2 million, is gold with diamonds, yellow sapphires, and blue topaz, featuring a caged-front effect thanks to a decorative necklace. Ribeiro wore it with a nude panty featuring a matching gold-leaf-patterned waistband.\n\nApparently, Ribeiro didn't know she got the Fantasy Bra until she went into the Fashion Show fittings: “I had no idea that [the fitting] was for the bra—I came in and when I tried it, I cried; it was unbelievable,\" she tells Vogue.\n\nEvery year Victoria's Secret selects one of its Angels—i.e., the models who are on contract with the brand to appear in campaigns, commercials, and e-commerce imagery throughout the year—to wear the bejeweled Fantasy Bra, which usually bears a price tag in the multiple millions. Past recipients of this honor include Claudia Schiffer (who wore the inaugural Fantasy Bra back in 1996), Heidi Klum (twice!), Gisele Bündchen (also twice!), and Miranda Kerr. At the 2016 show in Paris, Jasmine Tookes donned the Eddie Borgo–designed, Aziz & Walid Mouzannar–jewel-embellished number dubbed the \"Bright Night Fantasy Bra.\"\n\nAside from the Fantasy Bra, there's plenty to look forward to in this year's program: a new location, a collaboration with Balmain, a potential Taylor Swift–Harry Styles reunion on the glitter-coated runway. There's never a dull moment when the pink jet comes to town.\n\nThe 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will air on November 28 on CBS.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nWe Spent 5 Days With Victoria’s Secret Angels, and Their Lives Are Exactly As You’d Imagine\n\nThe 29 Best Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Looks Ever\n\nThe 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Was the Most Expensive Show in History"
