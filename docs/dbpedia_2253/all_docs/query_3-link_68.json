        "text": "There's no rest for the exceptionally lovely: the day after Victoria's Secret models returned from Paris to film the brand's 2016 fashion show, they were puckering up for the cameras again. Angels Josephine Skriver, Romee Strijd, and Lais Ribeiro hit the new Victoria's Secret 5th Avenue store to chat holiday gifts and the new Paris Eau de Parfum.\n\nIf there was any jetlag amongst the wavy-haired crew, it was undetectable. After all, all the girls confessed to an enduring adrenaline rush from the big show. \"It was such an incredible location,\" Lais told The Lookbook. \"The outside of Grand Palais was all pink, and inside was just so beautiful. It was incredible.\" Leading up to the show, Lais and all the models trained hard—but none of them missed pizza too much. \"We pretty much have to be in shape the whole year,\" Lais said. \"As a lingerie model, you have to be ready. Before the show, we have to work out more. But I eat everything I want, and try to go to the gym as much as I can,\" she said. Josephine echoed Lais's sentiment—\"I have a pretty healthy lifestyle\"—but she did admit to cutting back on the cocktails in the weeks before the show.\n\nJosephine Skriver\n\nEven though they stay lingerie-ready 365 days a year, the girls indulged in plenty of crepes—and, yes, pizza—at the after-party. But for Josephine, no Nutella crepe could beat kicking off her heels. \"At that point, my feet were so happy to be in flats,\" she told us.\n\nLais Ribeiro\n\nEven though the models let loose till the wee hours, Lais made sure to get plenty of rest afterwards. Her number one beauty tip? \"Sleeping! I have this thing: I can sleep anywhere,\" she said. \"It's kind of like my power.\"\n\nJosephine grew up in Denmark, where she learned early that \"less is more\" when it comes to beauty. \"We hardly wear makeup, and don't do a lot with the hair,\" she said. \"[In Denmark] it's all about enhancing the beauty you have and keeping it minimal.\" Now that wearing makeup is in her job description, Josephine has has been bitten by the beauty bug. But, her #goals can be boiled down to: \"great skin and great brows.\" As for Romee, it's all about hydration. \"On the plane back, I was sitting there with a hydrating mask on my skin,\" she shared.\n\nRomee Strijd\n\nNow, onto the tough question: which celebrity would make the perfect Victoria's Secret Angel? \"Sometimes, when Taylor Swift is on camera, she looks like an Angel,\" Lais said. \"Her body looks great, and her voice [is great.] I think she pretty much is an Angel.\" Romee's nomination for celebrity Angel? \"Beyoncé,\" she said. \"She's super sexy.\" Josephine, however, gave hope to us all: \"With the team we have, anyone can be an Angel,\" she said. \"It's all about the right outfit.\" How judicious! (But, we're not giving up our day job just yet.)\n\nWe also asked about celebrity crushes. Yes, we're nosy. \"Channing Tatum,\" Lais said after a giggle. \"I love Magic Mike.\" Josephine 'fessed up to a bit of a girl crush on Sofia Vergara. \"She's so fun, so sexy, and so confident,\" she gushed. \"I met her one time, and I got so starstruck, I couldn't even remember my own name.\" For her part, Romee's got a thing for Angelina Jolie. \"She does so much amazing work for charities,\" Romee said. \"She's pretty, and sexy, but she's also a really nice person.\" -Reporting by Jocelyn Vena"
