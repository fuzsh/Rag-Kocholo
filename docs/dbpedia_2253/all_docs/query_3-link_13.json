        "text": "Even an angel is not perfect.\n\nBrazilian supermodel Lais Ribeiro graced this year’s Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show catwalk in China wearing the coveted Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra. But it wasn’t the $2 million jeweled bra that her fans are admiring. It’s the model’s stretch marks that have the internet singing her praises.\n\nThe 27-year-old has stretch marks and people online are happy to be reminded, more and more, that even the most beautiful women in the world have flaws.\n\nA fan site for the Victoria’s Secret Angels shared a photo of Ribeiro in which her stretch marks are visible. They captioned the photo, “She is a human, like you and me. She has stretch marks like all the girls! and that’s not ugly. Stretch marks are beautiful. Love your body! It’s the only you will have.”\n\n“Nobody is perfect but still gorgeous, beautiful and sexy,” wrote a commenter. “She is beautiful,” wrote another commenter.\n\nThe supermom has a 10-year-old boy. Ribeiro has walked for fashion powerhouses like Ralph Lauren, Christian Dior, and Tom Ford, and has been appearing in the Victoria’s Secret catwalk since 2011.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nWhy the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show might be bad for body image, according to scientists\n\nAt Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, people are worried Chinese government is spying on them\n\nThe anti-Victoria’s Secret runway show proves all women can be angels"
