And every so often, we like to shout out those Instagrammers we particularly like. Lais Ribeiro is one of the newest Victoria’s Secret angels, but we’re crowning her the unofficial angel of Instagram too. You’ll see why soon enough.** Follow her here.**\n\nHow are you feeling today?\n\nToday I feel great! The sun is out, my dream of becoming a VS angel came true, and I have my friends and family to celebrate with me.\n\nWhat are you wearing?\n\nJeans, a sweater, and a pair of booties.\n\nWhat’s the one thing you most want to do before you die?\n\nI want to live long enough to see my son grown and happy and fulfilling his dreams.\n\nWhat’s the most ridiculous selfie you ever took?\n\nIf I ever took a ridiculous selfie, I would never share it!\n\nYour social media pet peeve?\n\nPeople that write negative comments for no reason.\n\nWhat’s the last song you listened to?\n\n\"See You Again\" by Wiz Khalifa.\n\nWhat’s your most prized possession?\n\nMy family!\n\n**What is your mantra? (If you don’t have one, make one up. We’ll wait.) **\n\nYou attract good things when you stay on the positive side of life.\n\n**Where have you never been but want to go? **\n\nJamaica baby!\n\nHave a favorite YouTube video?\n\nWho was your favorite Batman?\n\nMichael Keaton."
