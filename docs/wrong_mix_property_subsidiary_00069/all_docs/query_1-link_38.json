You can review the TestStand reports in IBM Rational Quality Manager without manually configuring TestStand to submit HTML reports to IBM Rational Quality Manager.\n\nYou can navigate to a file in the Root Resource Folder list of the Find Input Parameters Data File dialog box by filtering. After you enter text in the textbox above Root Resource Folder, the dialog box lists only the folders and files whose names contain the text.\n\nKnown Issues\n\nYou can access the software and documentation known issues list online. Refer to the National Instruments website for an up-to-date list of known issues in the Test Integration Adapter.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nThe following items are the IDs and titles of a subset of issues fixed in the Test Integration Adapter. This is not an exhaustive list of issues fixed in the current version of the Test Integration Adapter. If you have a CAR ID, you can search this list to validate that the issue has been fixed.\n\nID Fixed Issue 410941 seqedit.exe is the only supported operator interface 414283 Test result folder for result file upload is always expected to be adjacent to the sequence file 417788 The Test Integration Adapter is unable to connect unless the debug logging path is set on the last tab 417790 The 'x' button on the Test Integration Adapter window is grayed out 419243 The Test Integration Adapter does not support client or server authentication 422621 When a test is stopped through RQM, results are not uploaded 442129 Running a sequence file which doesn't have Single Pass or Test UUTs entry point from RQM results in a TestStand error at runtime 444878 Cannot read Root Resource Folder on a mapped network drive\n\nAccessing the Help\n\nRefer to the NI Test Integration Adapter for IBM Rational Quality Manager Help, accessible by selecting Help»Test Integration Adapter Help from the Test Integration Adapter, for information about the Test Integration Adapter.\n\nAutomating the Installation of NI Products\n\nYou can automate the installation of most NI products using command-line arguments to suppress some or all of the installer user interface and dialog boxes. However, starting with the August 2012 releases (products using NI Installers version 3.1 or later), you may need to perform additional steps before or during a silent installation of NI software.\n\nIf the NI product you are installing uses Microsoft .NET 4.0, the .NET installer may run before any NI software installs and may require a reboot before the installation of NI software begins. To avoid a .NET reboot, install .NET 4.0 separately before you install NI software.\n\nFor more information about automating the installation of NI products, refer to the following KnowledgeBase articles:\n\nFor more information about silent installations of individual NI products, refer to KB 4CJDP38M, Automating the Installation of a Single Installer.\n\nFor more information about silent installations of NI products in a suite, such as NI Developer Suite, refer to KB 4GGGDQH0, Automating the Installation of a Suited Installer.\n\nTo determine what version of NI Installers your product contains, refer to KB 4CJDR18M, How Can I Determine the Type and Version of My National Instruments Installer?.\n\nHow to Use NI Software with Microsoft Windows 8.x\n\nWhen you install National Instruments software on Microsoft Windows 8.x, you will notice a few additional tiles in the Apps view, including shortcuts to NI application software products such as NI LabVIEW, Measurement & Automation Explorer (NI MAX), and NI Launcher.\n\nUsing NI Launcher\n\nNI Launcher helps you find and launch installed NI products. It provides you with a method of finding NI products similar to the Start menu in previous versions of Microsoft Windows. To use NI Launcher, click the NI Launcher tile in the Apps view. NI Launcher launches the desktop and opens a menu containing a list of NI products. Click any NI product to launch it.\n\nNote NI MAX does not appear as a desktop shortcut when installed on Microsoft Windows 8.x. You can launch NI MAX either from the Apps view or from within NI Launcher.\n\nPinning Frequently Used Applications\n\nFor convenience, you can pin your most-used NI applications, such as MAX, to either the Start screen or the Taskbar on the desktop, as necessary:\n\nCurrent ApplicationIcon LocationPin to Action Windows 8.x DesktopDesktop TaskbarRight-click application and select Pin to Taskbar Windows 8.x Desktop Start screenRight-click application and select Pin to Start Windows 8.x Start screenDesktop TaskbarRight-click application and select Pin to taskbar from the menu bar on the bottom of the screen\n\nFinding All Programs\n\nIf you want to find a particular application or related files, such as documentation files, from the Start screen, you can access all installed files from the Apps view. To get to the Apps view, right-click anywhere on the Start screen and select All apps (Windows 8) or click the down arrow on the bottom left of the screen (Windows 8.1).\n\nFor more information about NI support for Windows 8.x, visit ni.com/windows8.\n\nNI Test Integration Adapter for IBM Rational Quality Manager Drops Support for Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 in 2016\n\nNational Instruments Test Integration Adapter for IBM Rational Quality Manager will drop support for Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 as of July 1, 2016. Versions of the Test Integration Adapter that ship after July 1, 2016 will not install or run on Windows Vista, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003.
