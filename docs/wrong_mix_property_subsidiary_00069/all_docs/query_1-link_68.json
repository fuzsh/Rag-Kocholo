        "text": "If you are considering starting to use IBM® Rational® DOORS® Next Generation or already use it, it's important to know all of its important aspects. One of them is the existence, management and creation of templates. In this article we will provide you with a quick but thorough introduction into their various types, how you can manage them or even create your own.\n\nA template is in simple terms a blueprint used to make work more efficient and less convoluted. It helps automate some of the steps necessary for finishing a project, which significantly increases productivity thanks to time saved. Knowing how to make templates work to your advantage can be the difference between a project not being able to meet deadlines and a project being completed ahead of them.\n\nRequirements project templates are the bread and butter of effective requirements management as they provide an outline of the requirements needed to execute a project, including purpose, scope, features, tasks, deliverables, and milestones. Utilizing them can also lead to an increased trust from the stakeholders, as there is less of a chance of a mistake happening when requirements are outlined and clear to the people working on the project.\n\nIf you find yourself wanting to change or create templates to fit your specific needs, you can. It is actually a very intuitive process and you will most likely find this to be the most effective way to work with templates as you get more acquainted with them.\n\nTo gain access to them, you have to pick Manage Project Properties from the Administration menu after selecting a project, then select Templates. From there, you can pick between different types.\n\nIf you wish to create one, select New Template and then define everything you want included in the template (and of course its description and name too). There also exist dependencies between some of the components.\n\nManaging Artifact Templates is simple as it only involves the options to Delete or Edit them. While editing you can either change their name, description or content.\n\nTo create one, when in Create Template, focus on the Create Template based on function and look for then select the artifact you wish to be the basis for the template.\n\nWhen it comes to Module Templates, you can make them out of already existing modules. You can either make duplicates from the source module (artifacts, headings) or reuse them.\n\nOverall, templates are an essential tool in retaining quality, improving productivity and saving time, if you use them right. In this article we laid out the detailed basics for the different types of templates available to you. Learning to utilize them to their full extent will go a long way in improving the work on your projects.\n\nBlog Articles:\n\nBasics of Links and Link Types in IBM DOORS Next Generation - learn the basics about the linking and link types in IBM DOORS Next.\n\nLinking Techniques in IBM DOORS Next - article explaining basic concepts and showing multiple ways of creation of links between artifacts.\n\nLink By Attribute Feature in IBM DOORS Next - the article explains how to use the \"Link by attribute\" function to automatically create, update, or delete one or more links between artifacts based on values in the attributes of the artifact.\n\nSoftacus Widgets:\n\nLink Switcher - widget developed by Softacus, that converts the context of artifacts links in a very short time.\n\nModule Link Statistics - extension that provides users with a quick overview of the amount of the links in specific link types in a module.\n\nLink Type Change- extension developed by Softacus designed to enhance the functionality of DOORS Next Generation by allowing users to manipulate the direction of a link or convert it to another type of link.\n\nLinks Builder- extension that allows the users to create a link between two artifacts in DOORS Next Generation according to the certain rules.\n\nLink by Foreign Attribute - this extension allows users to create links between artifacts in the selected module(s), based on the attributes values.\n\nShow Attributes of Linked Artifacts - this extension shows the attributes and links of the artifact that is currently selected."
