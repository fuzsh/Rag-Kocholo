        "text": "Introduction:\n\nThe IBM Rational Connector for SAP Solution Manager is a web application providing a communication layer between Rational tools and SAP’s Solution Manager product. It employs protocols jointly developed by IBM and SAP. Once an administrator has linked one or more Solution Manager and Rational tools projects, end users can begin by exporting SAP Solution Manager blueprints to create IBM Rational Quality Manager test plans and test cases as well as IBM Rational Requirements Composer requirements. Resulting requirements and test collections reside in a folder structure that mirrors the blueprint hierarchy found in SAP. Requirements link back to the blueprint requirements documents, providing a live view of the details of the blueprint business requirements. After testing is performed, results can be imported back into SAP Solution Manager for reporting and analysis.\n\nPicture Credits: ibm.com/developerworks\n\nWhy Rational Connector is required?\n\nPicture Credits: ibm.com/developerworks\n\nInstallation:\n\nThe installation guide is available at the help section of IBM portal in below link;\n\nhttp://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rcsaphlp/v4r0/index.jsp\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nThe latest version of connector is 4.0, anounced on July 2012. More information is available in the below links;\n\nhttps://jazz.net/downloads/sap-connector/releases/4.0.0.1\n\nhttps://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2012/07/03/announcing-the-rational-connector-for-sap-solution-manage...\n\nConfiguration:\n\nConnector Project needs to be created in order to establish the dataflow between Solution Manager and IBM tools. This project is the integration point b/w all the content in SAP world and the IBM world.\n\nStep 1: Access the Connector URL inside the server wher the connector and Rational tools are installed\n\nhttp://<hostname>:9081/SAPConnector/\n\nStep 2: Create a New connector Project. This involves following 6 steps\n\ni. Project Summary: Name a new connector project here. For Example: \"Solman to IBM Connector Project\". This is the project that is used in SOLAR_PROJECT_ADMIN txn code while you are establishing the connection b/w solman Project and RQM Project as seen below;\n\nii. Rational Quality Manager Server: In this step provide the RQM Server details which should be synced with Solution Manager system.\n\niii. Rational Requirment Server: Provide the details of Rational Requirment Composer here (Hint: This can be same as the above entry)\n\niv. Rational Change Management Server : Provide the details of Rational Requirment Composer here (Hint: This can be same as the above entry)\n\nv.Blueprint mapping: This is very important step wher you define how the data in the Solution Manager Project is represented in the Rational Quality Manager Project. You can define here whether to represent a Test Object in Solution Manager to be Test Case in RQM and Business Scenario to be Test Requirment in RQM. So it is a mix and match case. So it is adviced to consult the Testing team to have a understanding on how they plan to work with RQM.\n\nvi. Solution Manager User information: Maintain the SAP user here who has all the authorization to 'Push' the data from Solution Manager to IBM tools.\n\nThis completes the setup of Rational Connector for SAP Solution Manager configuration.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/integrate-rational-alm-applications-sap/\n\nhttps://jazz.net/downloads/sap-connector/releases/4.0.0.1\n\nhttps://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2012/07/03/announcing-the-rational-connector-for-sap-solution-manage..."
