        "text": "IBM Rational DOORS is a requirements management application for optimizing requirements communication, collaboration and verification throughout your organization and supply chain. This requirements management tool allows you to create relationships, trace dependencies, empower multiple teams to collaborate in near real-time and handle versioning and change management. IBM Engineering DOORS is a scalable solution that can help you meet business goals by managing project scope and cost. It has helped IBM clients reduce development costs by 57 percent, accelerate the time to market by 20 percent and reduce cost of quality by 69 percent.\n\nDXL (DOORS eXtension Language) is a scripting language specially developed for Rational DOORS. DXL is used in many parts of Rational DOORS to provide key features, such as file format importers and exporters, impact and traceability analysis and inter-module linking tools. This capability of extending Rational DOORS with DXL is available to users who choose to develop their own DXL scripts. DXL can also be used to develop larger add-on packages such as CASE tool interfaces and project management tools. To the end user, DXL developed applications appear as seamless extensions to the graphical user interface. Extending Rational DOORS with DXL is for the more technical user, who sets up programs for the end-user to apply.\n\nDXL takes many of its fundamental features from C and C++. Anyone who has written programs in these or similar programming languages should be able to use DXL."
