We are not.\n\nExecutive Perspective Rational Continuous Delivery adoption Consume and Drive Processes and Culture External Deliverables Measure and Optimize Value Drive adoption DevOps Transformation Project\n\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 Collaborative Development Continuous Testing • Some test automation • Use quality management tools • Continuous integration testing w/service virtualization • Static code analysis • Security testing • Coverage analysis • Risk-based testing • Fully automatic acceptance tests Continuous Release and Deployment • Automatic crash reporting • Ad-hoc build scripts • Siloed developers • Bare-bone SCM (e.g. non-atomic commits) • Ad-hoc deployment scripts • Reactive performance resolution (e.g. outage alerts) • Business objectives documented in silo • Performance instrumentation and monitoring • User session recording and reporting • In-app customer feedback • Log analysis • Self-service deploy to test environments • Mostly standardized deployments • Nightly builds • Usage of methodologies (Agile, Scrum…) • Basic SCM (basic tagging, merging) • Business objectives linked to development work items • Self-service deployment to test and production environments • Fully standardardized deployments • Build on commit • Publish to asset repository • Real-time work item planning • Ability to objectively trade off requirements • Visibility to development status • Real-time performance dashboards • Measuring customer experience KPIs • A/B, Split and Multivariate testing • Real-time dashboard of business value attainment • Integration of business and customer metrics • Build verification tests on production-like environments • Advanced SCM (efficient personal branch/merge) • Lifecycle traceability • Advanced business impact analysis • Big-data analysis • Automated performance tests as part of quality gates • Quality-gated automatic promotions • Deployment of all application artifacts (e.g. database updates) • Coordinated SOA/multi-tier deployments • Continuous deployment to production • Development intelligence • Continuous process improvement • Continuous performance optimization • Full implementation of lean principles • Real-time integration entire lifecycle spanning from business objectives to customer sentiments • Voice of the customer investigation • Self-evolving application based on A/B testing Continuous Monitoring Continuous Customer Feedback and Optimization Continuous Delivery Example Maturity Model Industry norm Continuous Business Planning Target attainment Will be updated!!!!! 8\n\nBack to the future: WAS Adoption of WCA Background Background and Challenges Shorten time delivery time via Agile Processes Provide meaningful dev & test environments Increase Hardware Utilization Decrease system admin costs WCA Solution Construct Private Cloud leveraging WCA Seed Cloud with 6% of Infrastructure Adopt and scale to 50% over 4 years Realized Results Realized Benefits Deployment reduced from 3+ hours to 20 minutes Hardware Utilization increased from 6% to 60% User Deployment failures down from 50% to 5% Complete Performance Environment as Patterns Increased system admin efficiency 16 fold Realized Results 1Q 2009 – 2Q2010 355 K in Labor efficiency gains 160 K in Infrastructure savings Enabled Results due to Process Changes 2.1 million Labor efficiency gains 780 K / year downstream regression test savings Projected Results Projected CloudBurst Adoption Rate : 2010 = 6%,2011=20%,2012=40%,2013/14=50% Benefit Summary: Setup = 24K Training = 36K 5 year return on investment = 10.4 Million\n\nBack to the future Interact WebSphere deploys private cloud driving Agile Adoption and gain efficiencies throughout delivery Client Pains • Enable rapid access to complete testing topologies to improve quality and decrease costs • Drive down costs and increase utilization of infrastructure Real Results • 1,700 Kin direct savings, 2.1 Million/year in enabled efficiency. • Reduced topology install time from 3 Hours to 20 Minutes.

Frankly, while our development teams may have been agile that did not really translate as we had hoped into faster application delivery. We really struggled with how to engage our operations team and to meet the speed requirements for social and mobile applications. There was always this tension between the development of those next generation applications and how that related to our traditional systems. Once you introduce public and private cloud technologies into the equation we were lost and were looking for a model based on real results. I was sick of hearing the words Agile, DevOps and Cloud, help me know how to realize some results. The Rational DevOps Transformation project helped us make sense of this mess and I loved the transparency. Think of it as a DevOps Reference Architecture, Adoption Path, Business Value Assessment and Deployable solution that not only tells the story of IBMs transformation but provided a blueprint for ours. It was first brought to our attention by our Executives who pretty much wanted to duplicate the results. We were skeptical but their transition story was transparent and helped us understand a set of best practices and lessons. One of the key takeaways was that we needed to invest in this transition. Ultimately there was of course exciting new technologies to adopt but also changes in our organization and lines of business were necessary. The business value assessments created a model that helped us with these adoption challenges. From a technology standpoint we were able to pilot DevOps solution very quickly because we were able to take what IBM used internally and deploy it quickly in order to demonstrate the value we were looking for. From there it was a matter of integrating the functioning solution with out existing systems and creating a strategy for realizing value in our Systems of Record as well as our emerging applications.

No Whining\n\nDiscussion Point: Smart Pipes • Problem: static test pipe of increasing complexity/value is too slow for continuous integration • Constantly quantify the value of a test case in terms of it's reliability, it's history of finding defects, the variety of systems that it finds defects in, and whether or not it is related to change sets. For various build/integration purposes have a defined regression window. Within that window dynamically organize the pipeline in the most optimal way to ensure the driver is stable, to find regressions as quickly as possible and to begin expensive or time consuming tests cases such as long runs earlier enough to matter. • Said another way run the best tests to ensure stability, don't run stuff that never matters, run the most relevant tests, run stuff concurrently not linearly, start valuable long running tests as soon as stability is determined. Do all of this within a relevant execution window and provide data and an assurance metric throughout the process. • A smarter pipeline would become an important part of a best of breed Application Release System that is necessary to differentiate IBM from open source ALM and emerging devOps solutions. • Question: With what | Who | When Consume and Drive Processes and Culture External Deliverables Measure and Optimize Value Drive adoption DevOps Transformation Project\n\nDiscussion Point: Applying service • How should upgrades and service be applied in JazzHub and Jazz.net environments? • Swim-lanes / Hold Cold • Patch • Rolling upgrades • How are the same mechanisms used within the our delivery pipeline • Do all new project requests get placed on latest available (JazzHub) • How many topology deployments at a time (JazzHub) Consume and Drive Processes and Culture External Deliverables Measure and Optimize Value Drive adoption DevOps Transformation Project\n\nNext Steps • June – July (Learning, evaluation and communicating a perspective) • Form mini projects with dedicated resources • Create some initial horizontal teams • Merge various efforts and understand what is not going to be done • Establish baseline business value assessments"
