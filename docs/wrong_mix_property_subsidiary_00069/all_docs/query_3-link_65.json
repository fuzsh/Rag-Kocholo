Ask your seach engine for \"TN5250\" for free or commercial products, or give the following products a try:\n\nTN5250 at sourceforge (freeware)\n\nTN5250J java based (freeware)\n\nMochasoft TN5250 (commercial but worth the money)\n\nYou can also try IBM i Access Client Solutions if you have access to IBM ESS software at:\n\nIBM web site (sorry we may not publish a direct download link) Advanced programmers may use the free eclipse based package to be found here, but for all features you might heed the IBM Rational developer for i which is some costy but offers a lot of modern features for programmers.\n\nYou might want to use pure eclipse with these (or other) plugins:\n\nSourceforge - iserieslegacy\n\nWe also highly recommend MIWorkplace by Mihael Schmidt"
