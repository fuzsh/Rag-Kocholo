I have been using this edition for most of this year.\n\nToday, I was looking for the Linux version to install for a demo, and I noticed that the Mac version was more recent than the one I had installed so I downloaded both.\n\nWhen I installed this latest release, I could no longer open the project which I have been working with for at least 6 months. The error said that the project was not compatible with the starter edition.\n\nThis makes no sense as I had literally opened the same project earlier in the day and worked with it for a presentation.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this problem?"
