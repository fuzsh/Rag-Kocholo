The Test Integration Adapter uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to communicate with IBM Rational Quality Manager and TestStand to control test systems.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nThe Test Integration Adapter has the following system requirements for the test computer.\n\nSystem Requirements Recommended Required Operating System\n\n—\n\nWindows 8.1/7 (32-bit and 64-bit) Processor Pentium 4-M or equivalent Pentium III, 1 GHz, or equivalent Memory 2 GB 512 MB Hard Disk Space\n\n—\n\n1 GB\n\nApplication Software Support\n\nThe following table lists the application software versions, including service packs, supported by the Test Integration Adapter.\n\nApplication SoftwareVersions Supported by the Test Integration Adapter TestStand 2012 SP1 or laterIBM Rational Quality Manager4.0.x or later\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\nTo use the Test Integration Adapter, you must install this software on both the test computer where TestStand runs and the server computer where you install IBM Rational Quality Manager. Complete the following instructions to install the Test Integration Adapter:\n\nTo install the Test Integration Adapter on the test computer, insert the NI Test Integration Adapter for IBM Rational Quality Manager installation media and follow the instructions that appear on the screen. If you do not have the installation media, visit ni.com/info and enter the Info Code TESTADAPTER_DOWNLOAD to download the Test Integration Adapter.\n\nTo install the Test Integration Adapter on the server computer, visit ni.com/info and enter the Info Code ex7qna for detailed installation instructions.\n\nVisit ni.com/security to view and subscribe to receive security notifications about NI products. Visit ni.com/critical-updates for information about critical updates from NI.\n\nNew Features\n\nThe main window of the Test Integration Adapter includes the Console tab.

Refer to the NI website for an up-to-date list of known issues in the Test Integration Adapter.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nThe following item is the ID and title of a subset of issues fixed in the Test Integration Adapter. This is not an exhaustive list of issues fixed in the current version of the Test Integration Adapter. If you have a CAR ID, you can search this list to validate that the issue has been fixed.\n\nID Fixed Issue 552807 Disabled TestStand popup windows that were halting automated runs of the Test Integration Adapter\n\nRefer to the NI website for a subset of issues fixed in the NI Test Integration Adapter for IBM Rational Quality Manager 3.0.\n\nAccessing the Help\n\nRefer to the NI Test Integration Adapter for IBM Rational Quality Manager Help, accessible by selecting Help»Test Integration Adapter Help from the Test Integration Adapter, for information about the Test Integration Adapter.\n\nAutomating the Installation of NI Products\n\nYou can automate the installation of most NI products using command-line arguments to suppress some or all of the installer user interface and dialog boxes. However, starting with the August 2012 releases (products using NI Installers version 3.1 or later), you may need to perform additional steps before or during a silent installation of NI software.\n\nIf the NI product you are installing uses Microsoft .NET 4.0, the .NET installer may run before any NI software installs and may require a reboot before the installation of NI software begins. To avoid a .NET reboot, install .NET 4.0 separately before you install NI software.\n\nFor more information about automating the installation of NI products, refer to the following KnowledgeBase articles:\n\nFor more information about silent installations of individual NI products, refer to KB 4CJDP38M, Automating the Installation of a Single Installer.\n\nFor more information about silent installations of NI products in a suite, such as NI Developer Suite, refer to KB 4GGGDQH0, How Do I Automate the Installation of a Suited Installer?.\n\nTo determine what version of NI Installers your product contains, refer to KB 4CJDR18M, How Can I Determine the Type and Version of My NI Installer?.\n\nUsing NI Software with Microsoft Windows 8.1\n\nWhen you install NI software on Microsoft Windows 8.1, you will notice a few additional tiles in the Apps view, including shortcuts to NI application software products such as NI LabVIEW, Measurement & Automation Explorer (NI MAX), and NI Launcher.\n\nUsing NI Launcher\n\nNI Launcher helps you find and launch installed NI products. It provides you with a method of finding NI products similar to the Start menu in previous versions of Microsoft Windows. To use NI Launcher, click the NI Launcher tile in the Apps view. NI Launcher launches the desktop and opens a menu containing a list of NI products. Click any NI product to launch it.\n\nNote NI MAX does not appear as a desktop shortcut when installed on Microsoft Windows 8.1. You can launch NI MAX either from the Apps view or from within NI Launcher.\n\nPinning Frequently Used Applications\n\nFor convenience, you can pin your most-used NI applications, such as MAX, to either the Start screen or the Taskbar on the desktop, as necessary:\n\nCurrent ApplicationIcon LocationPin to Action Windows 8.1 DesktopDesktop TaskbarRight-click application and select Pin to Taskbar Windows 8.1 Desktop Start screenRight-click application and select Pin to Start Windows 8.1 Start screenDesktop TaskbarRight-click application and select Pin to taskbar from the menu bar on the bottom of the screen\n\nFinding All Programs\n\nIf you want to find a particular application or related files, such as documentation files, from the Start screen, you can access all installed files from the Apps view. To get to the Apps view, click the down arrow on the bottom left of the screen.\n\nFor more information about NI support for Windows 8.1, visit ni.com/windows8.\n\nLegal Information\n\nCopyright\n\n© 2013–2015 National Instruments.
