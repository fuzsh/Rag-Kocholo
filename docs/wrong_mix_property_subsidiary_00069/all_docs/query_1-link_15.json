From my understanding it seems to be a \"branding\" or a \"marketing name\" rather than a software per say. I can't find a part number to purchase it.\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/1/897/ENUS206-311/index.html&lang=en-ZZ\n\nWhats is confusing me is that FNMS classify this as \"Commercial\" and this link indicates that it's a package\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/docs/en/radfws/9.6.1?topic=software-installing-rational-application-developer-websphere\n\nAny thoughts appreciated!\n\nKind Regards."
