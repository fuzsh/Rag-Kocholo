        "text": "Rational Requirements Composer helps teams define and use requirements effectively across the project lifecycle.\n\nThe whole team creates and uses requirements, though a business analyst may lead the effort. Better, faster requirements lead to less project rework, faster time to market, and better business outcomes.\n\nEngage a wide range of customers and other stakeholders in the requirements process. Use intuitive storyboards, process diagrams, use cases, and other visual and textual techniques to uncover customer needs and define good requirements\n\nGain fast stakeholder consensus through effective team collaboration and deep visibility into team activity\n\nFoster agility and predictability with light-weight requirements practices, centralized repository, common dashboards, and team-wide conversations\n\nAnalyze, organize and manage requirements and their changes efficiently using attributes, collections, tags, filters, views, and out-of-the-box report templates (including UI specification, audit history, traceability report)\n\nAlign development and test teams with business priorities using collaborative application lifecycle management (CALM) integrations, relating requirements, work items in IBM Rational Team Concert, and tests in IBM Rational Quality Manager\n\nWhere teams are capturing and organizing requirements in a work item backlog, elaborate these work items with visual and textual notations to accelerate communication with and commitment from the customer or product owner\n\nWhere teams are managing requirements with Rational RequisitePro or Rational DOORS, provide requirements definition accelerators as described above\n\nRational Requirements Composer 2.0 adds a web client, review and approval workflow, collections and snapshots, shared filters and views, customizable dashboard with viewlets shared with Team Concert and Quality Manager, and much more\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows\n\nFeatures and Benefits\n\nFeatures and benefits of IBM Rational Quality Manager Standard Edition\n\nCollaborative application lifecycle management (CALM) integrations\n\nAlign development and test activities with your business priorities and requirements. Link requirements with work items in Rational Team Concert and tests in Rational Quality Manager. The Jazz platform takes integration to a whole new level with information transparency across integrated tools.\n\nOpen and flexible platform optimized for requirements collaboration\n\nBetter stakeholder involvement leads to better requirements and better project outcomes. IBM Rational Requirements Composer fosters business and technology team collaboration in an online requirements community involving a wide set of stakeholders including customers, analysts, developers, testers, and operations/production. Make requirements and related business context visible to the extended team — including those who join the team later. Break down the information islands that exist among the various tools and data format used to express requirements information. Establish relationships among related information using hyperlinks, collections, attributes and tags. Have group conversations in threaded comments; see what others are creating, changing and commenting on. Include in this web of requirements information files created by the tools you use today: office documents, recording of conference calls, and informal documentation (for example, snapshots of white boards).\n\nWeb-based review and approval workflow\n\nWeb-based review and approval workflow enables your teams to achieve consensus and validate requirements faster by shortening the review and approval cycles. The customizable user dashboards and viewlets provide collective information about project membership, recent activity, recent requirements, collaboration, and reviews. Commenting capabilities now include direct comments to multiple users.\n\nRich text authoring\n\nConsolidate unstructured information (rich text, images, tables and link internal and external documents) with easy document creation. Embed artifacts (diagrams, sketches) to create concise and clear vision and specification documents. Using this editor, users capture the annotated information to support any project, business goal or requirement.\n\nOrganize and find requirements\n\nIBM Rational Requirements Composer supports collections, shared filters, tags, attributes, hyperlinks and advanced searches to help you find and organize requirements and related information. These features help improve productivity and increase reuse.\n\nBusiness Process Diagrams\n\nMany IT projects are undertaken to enhance business process, and developing a good understand of the as-is and to-be processes is an important goal of the requirements definition process. Using a select subset of business process modelling notation and a simple native editor, users create, share and validate current and future state business processes, including roles, rules, tasks, and decision points. Link business process diagram elements, tasks, and decision points to use cases, UI sketches, and requirements. Allow stakeholders to conceptualize how various inputs, outputs, and roles can work together to execute processes that create value for the business. Then relate other requirements artifacts to this business process to create a web of requirements information.\n\nUser Interface Sketching\n\nExpress user interfaces (UIs) with wire frame mock-ups through a simple UI Sketching editor. Create mock-ups and workflow examples for web-based interactions that link any UI component to rich document descriptions and requirements. Visualize system transactions and interactions as the user would, identify user experience issues prior to costly web-development.\n\nUser Interface Storyboards\n\nStoryboards are a common, proven technique in movie-making: a fast, inexpensive way of communicating ideas; finding points of consensus, disagreement, and ambiguity; then making decisions. Requirements definition and solution design are highly iterative and likewise benefits from this kind of visual expression of user scenarios. Both non-technical and technically-minded stakeholders can readily grasp the relevance of the storyboarded scenarios, and this can raise the quality of the requirements elicitation and validation conversations beyond what typically happens during textual document reviews. Quickly assemble UI storyboards in Requirements Composer from sketches using reusable components and templates. Make fast, consistent changes, which are propagated automatically. Link any UI part to other documents and requirements. UI storyboards can be represented in low visual fidelity when communicating general ideas, or in more life-like, higher fidelity, when communicating notions of visual design.\n\nUse Case Models\n\nCreate use case diagrams that capture system behavior. Elaborate use cases with rich document descriptions. Link use cases diagrams with use case specifications, user interfaces sketches, storyboards, process flows and requirements.\n\nDynamic Glossaries\n\nUnify teams and remove ambiguity that leads to errors by using common, integrated glossaries. Support multiple glossaries to capture enterprise and project-level terms. Includes support for: search, synonyms, and related terms. Link to glossary terms from anywhere there is text using built-in content assistance tools.\n\nArtifact Collections and Project Snapshots\n\nDefine scope and manage change using collections and snapshots. Establish baselines and compare them to understand what has changed. Rational Requirements Composer allows you to return to specific revisions of artifacts and the links and comments that existed at the time a snapshot was created.\n\nParallel requirements development\n\nUsing collections and snapshots your development team can use one version of an artifact in one project iteration while someone is further elaborating it for the next iteration.\n\nReports and document generation\n\nAutomate tasks for generating and publishing hand-offs, contracts, reports, traditional reviews, use case survey documents and requirements specifications using out-of-the-box reporting based on Rational Publishing Engine technology. Out-of-the-box report templates include UI Specification, Use Case Specification, Traceability Report, Review/Approval Summary, and Audit History. A reporting wizard guides you in creating these reports in common file formats, including Microsoft Word, PDF, HTML, and XSL formatting objects (XSL-FO).\n\nDashboards\n\nLet the important information find you. Requirements Composer includes user and project dashboards. Web dashboards include customizable viewlets, which can pull information from multiple tools (Requirements Composer, Team Concert, Quality Manager). See the latest comments for you or for the whole team; see new and recent changes in the project artifacts.\n\nIntegrates with Rational RequisitePro\n\nIntegrates with RequisitePro to enhance requirements analysis and traceability across lifecycle assets in Rational Software Architect, Rational Software Modeler, Rational ClearQuest®, Rational Application Developer, Rational Data Architect, Rational Systems Developer, WebSphere Business Modeler, WebSphere Integration Developer, Rational SoDA®, Rational Unified Process and Rational TestManager ®.\n\nIntegrates with DOORS\n\nUse Requirements Composer and DOORS together to optimize team productivity in fast-changing and carefully controlled projects or project phases respectively."
