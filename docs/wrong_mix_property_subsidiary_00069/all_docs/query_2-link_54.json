Install Rational Application Developer Version 8.5.5.3 or any later 8.5.5.x instead. For more information, see Installing Rational Application Developer 8.5.5.\n\nBefore you begin\n\nEnsure that you are logged on as a user with Administrator privileges.\n\nTo review the levels of Rational Application Developer that are supported by WebSphere Commerce Developer, see WebSphere Commerce Developer Version 7 software requirements. To determine the level of Rational Application Developer install, see Recommended fixes and settings for WebSphere Commerce Version 7.\n\nImportant:\n\nThere are 2 paths created during the installation: the Shared Resources Directory and the Installation Directory. Do not accept the default installation paths. Specify short directory names such as C:\\RAD75\\SDP for Installation Directory and C:\\RAD75\\SDPShared for Shared Resources Directory.\n\nThe default installation path is too long for configuration with the WebSphere Commerce toolkit.\n\nAlso, avoid using periods (\".\"), spaces, or dollar signs (\"$\") in the directory names.\n\nSelect both IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software and IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 Test Environment\n\nSelect the following features on the Install Packaging panel:\n\nUnder Web Development Tools, select Web Development Tools, Struts Tools, and SDO - Domino and JDBC Mediators\n\nJava EE Developer Productivity Enhancements\n\nJava EE Assembly and Deploy\n\nTools for WebSphere Application Server, version 7.0 (under WebSphere Application Server development)\n\nData tools\n\nJava client application edition (VE)\n\nVisualization\n\nLine level code coverage\n\nTest and Performance Tools\n\nBusiness Intelligence and Reporting Tools\n\nJET Transformation Authoring and Runtime\n\nPlug-in Development Environment (PDE)\n\nIf you are working with WebSphere Portal Server, select Portlet and Portal Tools.\n\nProduct Features Rational Application Developer Version 7.5.5.1, or a higher Version 7.5 fix pack\n\nUnder Web Development Tools, select Web Development Tools, Struts Tools, and SDO - Domino and JDBC Mediators\n\nJava EE Developer Productivity Enhancements\n\nJava EE Assembly and Deploy\n\nTools for WebSphere Application Server, version 7.0 (under WebSphere Application Server development)\n\nData tools\n\nJava client application edition (VE)\n\nVisualization\n\nLine level code coverage\n\nTest and Performance Tools\n\nBusiness Intelligence and Reporting Tools\n\nJET Transformation Authoring and Runtime\n\nPlug-in Development Environment (PDE)\n\nIf you are working with WebSphere Portal Server, select Portlet and Portal Tools.\n\nFor example, the features being selected in Rational Application Developer Version 7.5.5.1, or a higher Version 7.5 fix pack installation would look similar to the following example:\n\nRational Software Architect Version 7.5.5.1, or a higher Version 7.5 fix pack\n\nBusiness Intelligence and Reporting Tools\n\nData tools\n\nJava EE Developer Productivity Enhancements\n\nJava EE Assembly and Deploy\n\nLine level code coverage\n\nPlug-in Development Environment (PDE)\n\ncom.ibm.rsa4ws.product\n\nTest and Performance Tools\n\nTransformation Authoring\n\nTools for WebSphere Application Server, version 7.0 (under WebSphere Application Server development)\n\nUnder Web Development Tools, select Web Development Tools, Struts Tools, and SDO - Domino and JDBC Mediators\n\nIf you are working with WebSphere Portal Server, select Portlet and Portal Tools.\n\nFor example, the features being selected in Rational Software Architect Version 7.5.5.1, or a higher Version 7.5 fix pack installation would look similar to the following example:\n\nDo not select Create a profile on the Configuration for IBM WebSphere Application Server panel.\n\nProcedure\n\nInstall Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect, following the appropriate product documentation:"
