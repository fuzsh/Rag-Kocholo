        "text": "On certain Windows XP Professional PCs, LMGRD 10.8.0.1 and/or 10.8.0.6 fails to start as a service at boot time. Using LMTOOLS, you configure and save a service normally. If you do not check the “Use Services” box, you can go to the Start/Stop/Reread tab and start and stop the server reliably. Once you check the Use Services box and save the service, however, LMGRD fails to start.\n\nAt boot time, there are two errors in the PCs event log:\n\n1. “Timeout (30000 milliseconds) waiting for the flexlm service to connect.”\n\n2. “The flexlm service failed to start due to the following error:\n\nThe service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.”\n\nAttempting to start the service from the services manager (services.msc), the error is:\n\n“Could not start the FLEXLM service on Local Computer Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.”\n\nIndeed, it does not start. If I change the \"Log on as\" attribute in the properties for the service to be either \"me\" or \"administrator\" instead of system, it says it fails, but lmgrd really does start at boot time.\n\nClues:\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the license file, host id or daemons. LMGRD runs fine in a DOS shell. At one time, LMGRD used to start as a service on this PC. I have checked the permissions on the daemons, which didn't really change and they are accessible by all three accounts. It does not seem like a timing or dependency problem, since it cannot be started manually either. The normal entry defining the service gets properly created in the registry under:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\FLEXlm License Manager\n\nI can start the daemon every time using the following DOS shell script example: “start_lmgrd.bat”\n\nLooks for running lmgrd, kills it and restarts lmgrd and vendor daemon is separate DOS shells. Note “taskkill” is a standard part of windows XP.\n\necho off\n\ntaskkill /F /T /IM lmgrd.exe\n\necho Wait 5 seconds then press any key...\n\npause >null\n\ncd c:\\flexlm\n\nlmgrd -c license.dat"
