        "text": "My son was born in 2010. He was born six months into a new Conservative government under David Cameron. His whole life has so far been lived under Tory rule. He knows nothing else.\n\nWhen I was pregnant with him I had a good job in the NHS. I’d worked my way up from office temp into hospital management. NHS budgets were tight and I’d often bring stationery in from home, our priority was patient care, getting people seen and sorted as quickly as we could. The hospital was clean, well maintained and the staff and patients were largely very happy with how things were.\n\nIn 2013, I left the NHS due to a spinal injury and became self employed. By the time I left, the cracks were starting to show, former colleagues were leaving, waiting lists for clinics were growing, and the brilliant clinicians and nurses I worked with were starting to struggle to manage with ever tighter budgets and fewer resources.\n\nWhen my son was a baby, we were encouraged to attend our local and newly built Sure Start Centre. It was a place where Health Visitors would hold weighing clinics, you could go to stay and play, get breastfeeding support and find other local mums to make friends with. By the time my son was 3, the centre had been handed over to a local charity and was no longer the parental support lifeline it once was.\n\nAs part of the round of toddler activities we went to each week, we were regulars at the library, joining in with toddler story time, reading books in the children’s section and enjoying meeting other parents and small children there. In Manchester where we live, library services have been slashed since 2010, and our local library, though still open and thriving, had to cut back on what it could offer, including toddler story times. That was a sad day.\n\nAged 4 my son started school, joining the nursery and subsequently got a place in Reception. It was a small church school, again run on a small budget and parents and staff did their best to raise funds for all the little extras. It was a good school, a great school, but in order to survive it joined an Academy Trust, which is what many schools have been forced into since 2010.\n\nAt school it became clear that my son had some learning disabilities, and so the school did its best for him, arranging for various assessments to be carried out and putting additional support in place for him. The SEN team did their best, but CAMHS is chronically underfunded and massively stretched, and it took 7 years to get an appointment and ultimately a diagnosis for him, which enabled him to get the appropriate support he needed. During this time the school had to find the money for his support within their own budget as without an ECHP the local authority won’t pay for any costs.\n\nFrom when he was born I’ve taken my son to all the local parks, visited playgrounds, explored the wooded areas where nature thrives, chased each other through woodlands and gone pond dipping. Since 2010 local authority spending on the upkeep of our local parks has been cut to the bone. Areas have been fenced off from the public, playgrounds not maintained and then closed, tennis courts locked and left to rot. Litter piles up, anti social behaviour is rife, I can’t relax if my son, now 13 goes to the park by himself as every week a teenager gets assaulted there and one day it could be him.\n\nLike libraries, local leisure facilities have been cut. We’ve lost swimming pools and running tracks, and sports fields have been sold to developers. Each year the sporting, leisure and learning opportunities for my son become fewer and fewer.\n\nAnd I now work in Adult Social Care, and I can’t begin to tell you how being chronically underfunded, understaffed and undermined by this government is doing incredible harm to the most vulnerable adults in society. That’s an essay for another time, perhaps.\n\nIn his 13, nearly 14 years on this planet, my boy has seen an NHS brought to its knees, he’s suffered due to a 7 year wait for his learning disabilities to be diagnosed, which ultimately impacts his education. He’s watched local services, which were set up to support him and children like him be decimated. His local parks and leisure facilities have been closed or neglected and that’s before we even start to think about the impact of covid on his generation.\n\nWhen he wakes up on 5th July, I hope he’s waking up to a brighter future, and a new dawn. I vividly remember the May 1997 General Election, and how energised and exciting the whole country felt. I hope he gets to experience that buzz too. As they said way back then, things can only get better, and I really hope they do.\n\nMy son’s love for trains has been something he’s enjoyed and that we have nurtured since he was a toddler. He loved Chuggington, he loved Thomas the Tank Engine, he loved going to the local garden centre and having a ride on their little steam trains, he loved visiting heritage railways. He loved it all.\n\nThese days, he’s 13, with access to the internet and all the YouTube videos and train timetables he can get his hands on. He’s autistic and very big on detail, so trains, trams, timetables and network maps are the things in life he enjoys the most.\n\nAside from his weekly visits to our local train station to watch the weekend action there, he likes us to take him on train journeys and to visit big stations where he can see a more exciting variety of trains. Weekends can often involve a local train journey, and he likes to plan longer, more complex journeys in the hope that we will take him somewhere exciting.\n\nThis week, I was all set to take him to a blogging event an hour or so away in Penkridge near Stafford. It got cancelled just after I’d booked us train tickets, which was unfortunate, but I figured we could still do the train bit and make the most of a day on the rails!\n\nI jokingly, well, maybe half jokingly posted these instructions for a grand day out on Facebook, but the more I read them, the more I realised that this is pretty much the secret to a teenage train enthusiast’s joy. So I’m sharing it here for you too.\n\nHow to entertain a teen who is obsessed with trains\n\nIt’s been on my mind to buy a Friends & Family Railcard card a while now. Even short journeys with him were starting to add up, but for £30 a year, as long as we travel together, we get 1/3 off our train fares. Using the railcard to book our return tickets to Stafford saved us around £15, so it’s already starting to pay for itself!\n\nNow that I have the railcard, I feel longer, previously too expensive journeys are more within our reach. A whole new railway world has opened up to us, and honestly, it’s a grand day out, just travelling somewhere and back again, though I may be more inclined to book a hotel and make more of a trip out of things now.\n\nWe had a really fun day out to Penkridge. I did have high hopes of exploring the town, finding somewhere nice for lunch, and stretching the day out a bit more. Alas, when we got there, it was raining pretty heavily and lots of things seemed to be closed, so we bought some sweets and headed back to Stafford station.\n\nStafford station is actually a pretty good spot for train spotting. The covered bridge over the station has a seating area where you can sit and watch the comings and goings. It’s also got a nice coffee shop as well as a Starbucks, and I once saw Su Pollard there, so there’s lots to commend it.\n\nMy son managed to tick off two kinds of trains he’d never been on before, and he had a really brilliant day watching, absorbing, enjoying, and enthusing. Trains might not excite me in quite the same way as they do him, but there’s something really lovely about supporting a teenager’s hobby and watching their love for it grow.\n\nThere’s also a lot to be said about being welcomed into his teen world and being able to spend quality time with him. Especially at a time when he’s starting to strike out on his own and he needs me less and less each passing week.\n\nIf you can tempt your train obsessed teen to go on a train journey with you, then I’d recommend it, not least because it’s a small way you can connect with them, and that’s a very lovely thing indeed. Safe journey!\n\nWe quite often visit Wilmslow in Cheshire and go out for a meal or look around the shops, but one of my most favourite things to do when I’m in Wilmslow is to take a walk around Lindow Common.\n\nLindow Common is on the outer fringes of Wilmslow, off Racecourse Road, and it’s a site of special scientific interest. It’s also home to Black Lake, which is probably the main attraction for me. Come rain or shine, if we are in the area, we will take a turn around the lake, sometimes if it’s cold, wet and miserable, it’s a very speedy walk. Sometimes, like over the weekend when the sun was shining, it was very much worth a lingering visit.\n\nThis pocket-sized nature reserve is popular with dog walkers and nature lovers alike. Hundreds of years ago it was the village common, where locals would graze their animals, but the trees have rather taken over these days. The common is classed as lowland heath, so there’s a management programme in place where they’re selectively removing some of the birch trees to allow the native heathers to grow.\n\nIf you’re driving, there’s a small free car park opposite Hickory’s where you can park if you need to. It’s about a ten minute walk from the town centre, so it feels pretty accessible to me.\n\nThere are information displays throughout Lindow Common, highlighting some of the rare or interesting plants, amphibians, birds and insects you might encounter on your visit. There are any number of things to spy on your walk around this man-made lake, but keep your eyes peeled for water voles, dragonflies, damselflies and a number of aquatic species. Beyond the water, the habitats provide cover for early migrating bird species including the chiffchaff, willow warbler and blackcap.\n\nWe don’t always walk through the heath areas, but over the weekend we took a short path through the wooded pathways. We walked through the heather filled heath and back to the familiar territory of Black Lake. The footpaths around the lake are generally well maintained and easy to walk on, and probably fine for wheelchairs and buggies, though parts can get a bit churned up after a prolonged period of wet weather.\n\nIn all the years we’ve been visiting Lindow Common, I’m pretty sure the weather this weekend was about the most perfect it’s been. There was not a cloud in the sky and the water shimmered and sparkled in the light. We spotted a number of birds including a rather handsome heron, some baby coots, moorhens, regular ducks and we heard that someone spotted a grebe on the other side of the lake. There was clearly a lot going on.\n\nFor those who like to linger, there are plenty of benches around the common where you can stop and enjoy the surroundings and possibly fuss a passing dog. It’s quite a small nature reserve, so there are no refreshment stalls or cafes within the reserve. If you want a drink or snack, you’ll need to bring your own, or pop across to a local café or restaurant. There are bins available, but you’re encouraged to take your litter back home with you if you can.\n\nBlack Lake has a sturdy wire fence around it, presumably to protect the wildlife from excitable dogs wanting a swim, so it would be a disappointing visit if I took my water loving spaniel. The lack of swimming opportunities for dogs does mean that the lake is very peaceful and a real haven for birds and wildlife.\n\nGrowing up in South Manchester in the 1980s, we heard all about the discovery of The Lindow Man, in 1984. Pete Marsh, as he was known as was discovered in a peat marsh close to Lindow Common. It is thought he could date back to the Iron Age or though to Roman Britain. Pete Marsh is now being cared for by the British Museum, though I did see him once many years ago when he was exhibited at The Manchester Museum. He may yet return north in the future, and if he does it’s worth visiting this fascinating chap, wherever he ends up.\n\nVisiting info:\n\nLindow Common SSSI, Racecourse Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5NQ\n\nWe were sent a Simba Hybrid Mattress Topper for review purposes. All images and opinions are our own.\n\nI’ve lately been looking at my bedroom and feeling like it needed a spring clean and a refresh. Though my bed was comfy, it wasn’t necessarily as cosy as could be and I just wanted to change up some of my furnishings, get new bedding and just make it feel like a space for myself.\n\nA little over ten years ago I had a few back surgeries, so my bed not only needs to be comfy and cosy, but it also needs to be supportive, and not too hard or too soft. I’m like Goldilocks when it comes to what I can sleep on, anything not quite perfect for me can increase my pain levels, worsen the numbness in my legs, or it can affect my mobility. I’d heard good things about the Simba Hybrid Mattress Topper, so I was excited to give it a try.\n\nI bought my current mattress a couple of years ago, and it was holding up well against my nightly tossings and turnings, as well as occasionally being used as a trampoline by the smallest member of the household, but a mattress topper can not only make your mattress more comfortable, but it can also extend its life. Buying a mattress can be a significant financial investment, so prolonging its life with a mattress topper seems like a worthwhile investment.\n\nMattress makers Simba have a range of products apart from mattresses to help you sleep easier at night, including temperature regulating pillows and duvets, and this next generation memory foam topper, which is breathable and doesn’t make you overheat in the same way that traditional memory foam mattresses and toppers can do.\n\nThe Simba Hybrid Mattress Topper uses Simbatex® memory foam to keep you cooler and more cushioned, as well as up to 2,500 Aerocoil® springs. It also includes a removable, washable cover. Nevertheless, I did cover it in a mattress protector, because you can never be too careful.\n\nPutting the Simba Hybrid Mattress Topper to the test\n\nThe mattress topper arrives in a large box, and I’m not going to lie, it’s heavy. Reassuringly heavy. The box has some cut out handles on the side, which makes it easier to carry up the stairs. If like me you’ve got a bad back, please don’t attempt this, please do recruit someone else to do the carrying. My 13 year old brought it upstairs for me and we unpacked it together.\n\nThe mattress comes rolled up and vacuum sealed in a plastic bag. Once you cut open the bag it starts to puff up to the shape you want. It’s best to pull it into position on your bed while it inflates, for want of a better word.\n\nEach corner of the topper has an elastic strap which you hook under your mattress to secure it in position. Once it’s in place, then it’s ready to use. As you can see, we got to testing it straight away.\n\nThe topper probably adds around two inches of height to my bed, so that’s worth noting and it does take a little getting used to that change in height. It is incredibly comfortable, it’s soft but still firm enough for me. It doesn’t make my hips ache, which a lot of not quite right beds do for me, so that’s an excellent sign. I have felt like I was having a better quality of sleep, and my Fitbit app is telling me that I’m waking up less in the night since we made up the bed a week ago.\n\nIt comes with a 200 night trial and a 10 year guarantee, but within three nights I had very much made my mind up that this was a keeper and my son was also asking for one for his bed.\n\nMy double Simba Hybrid Mattress Topper currently costs £289 with free delivery on the Simba website. I’m already seeing the benefits in terms of sleep quality and comfort, and I think now I’ve tried it, I don’t think my bed, my back and I will ever be without it.\n\nGrowing up in South Manchester, I spent a lot of time in Stockport. I suppose it was easier for my family to drive and park there to go shopping and such like. I’ve always felt at home there. It’s a small town, with a compact shopping centre and the more I visit and explore in my adulthood, the more I love it.\n\nIn more recent years, I’ve been excited by the food and drink scene, spending time up near the famous Victorian market, enjoying the hospitality of many of the bars and restaurants in the area. I could cheerfully list a whole heap of places where I’ve wined and dined well in recent years, but with half term approaching, I thought I’d put together a list of fine things to do in Stockport. As ever, if I’ve missed something important, please do comment below and I’ll add it in.\n\nIf you’re new to Stockport and fancy a bit of family fun on a dry day, one thing we did a couple of years ago was download a Treasure Trail map, which is a really excellent way of getting to know somewhere. We did it with a couple of other families, and despite visiting Stockport regularly for over 40 years, I discovered so much I’ve never seen before. So that’s well worth looking at.\n\nAdditionally, Stockport has its own heritage trail, which if you’re a fan of historical buildings and such like, it’s also worth looking at.

All images and opinions are our own.\n\nI’m a really big fan of the power of positive thinking in helping you on your way towards a happier outcome in life. Back in 2012, I had a bad accident and ended up needing two emergency surgeries on my back. At risk of permanent damage and paralysis, I spent nearly a year in excruciating pain and unable to function. The experience left me in permanent pain, with nerve damage and numbness throughout my lower body.\n\nWith a whole raft of physical problems to deal with, my mental health really suffered and I found myself in a very dark place. I was sent to rehab to help get me walking again, and slowly I began to recover myself physically and mentally. I would never be the person I once was, but I made a decision to not let my pain define me. I decided to focus not on the things I’d lost, such as being a more physically active mum, I lost my career and it damaged a number of important relationships. I chose instead to look at the good things which had come out of it all. Like being able to spend more time with my son, being able to be there every single day after school and during the holidays, plus it gave me my blog which took me to all kinds of places and it introduced me to so many new and amazing friends.\n\nPositive thinking really helped get me out of that hole, so when I find myself in a tight spot, or a dark place, I try and think of the lessons that situation is teaching me, or the people it is showing me who are there for me. I’m by no means Little Miss Sunshine, but being able to see the stars from the gutter is a gift I really appreciate.\n\nWhich, long story short, brings me to the 100 Days Of Menopause Affirmations jar from Little Daisy Self Care. I’m 47 now and like most of my mid-40s friendship group, I’m experiencing some menopause symptoms. I’m not quite knee-deep in night sweats and HRT, but there are changes happening which need managing.\n\nAs I said previously, I try and tackle all the bumps in my road with a positive, let’s try and see the bright side attitude, so that’s what I’m trying to do with my very impending menopause. I am reassured, just like Fleabag, that the menopause is usually pretty bloody awful, but once you get to the other side, life begins again and all kinds of good stuff is waiting for us. And that’s very good to know, but easy to forget when you’re in the thick of it.\n\nLittle Daisy Self Care has an Etsy shop which stocks, amongst other things, little jars full of affirmations for various times in our lives. There are journal prompts and mindfulness prompts, and many more. I’ve done daily affirmations for various things before, and whilst not every affirmation will be useful, I generally find it’s a good exercise to engage in, especially if you’re trying to be more reflective and positive in your approach to things.\n\nThe Little Daisy Self Care jars have been created by Alison, an experienced councillor. She’s helped many ladies work through their menopause and through that work she was inspired to create the 100 days of menopause affirmations.\n\nThere are 100 affirmations printed on little colourful pieces of card in each jar. Each card has a different affirmation related to menopause symptoms and positive thinking. The jar also comes with a QR code, so you can access a breathing technique demonstrated by Alison to help you with your self care.\n\nSome examples of the menopause affirmations include:\n\nI will take the time and space I need to adapt\n\nI love myself exactly as I am\n\nSome days can be difficult and that’s okay\n\nI listen to my body and give it what it needs\n\nI am just hot stuff!\n\nI have been enjoying dipping in and out of this jar. I’ve popped it on my desk at work, so when my mood drops, I can pick a card of positivity out of the jar and reflect on it for a few minutes. If a card doesn’t hit the spot for me at that moment, I’ll pick another one and put it back, because in a few weeks or months time, it might just be what I need at that point.\n\nWhilst we will all approach the menopause differently; a good vitamin regime, HRT or other medical or alternative therapies will form the main thrust of your approach to dealing with the menopause. I do believe in the power of positive thinking, and if these little daily affirmations can help you over a bump in the road, or help you see a glimmer of sunshine through the clouds, then that can only be a good thing.\n\nI really love the branding too, and that’s it’s presented neatly in a jar. Each little colourful card is a scrap of potential joy. It’s just nicely put together and I like that you can scan a QR code for some extra self care if you need it.\n\nEach jar costs £12 and would be a useful gift for someone experiencing the menopause, or a small treat for yourself, especially if you’re looking to approach menopause positivity.\n\nLittle Daisy Self Care jars are available from Etsy.\n\nI’ve talked a little about my work before, I work for a charity who supports adults with learning disabilities, but the culture within the charity encourages a lot of self reflection and personal growth. At times that can be challenging, but within that challenge, good things can grow.\n\nI was having one of my regular supervisions with my new boss a couple of weeks ago, and he asked me what my work intentions were for 2024 and I was stumped. It’s been a while since I had a job which asked that of me, and it occurred to me that I hadn’t set any professional goals for myself possibly ever, and in my personal life, apart from some vague New Year Resolutions, I had no goals either. So, with 2023 coming to a close, I’ve decided to set some intentions for 2024.\n\nWhat does it mean to set intentions?\n\nIntentions are lived each day, and are about your relationship with yourself and others. They are not hard targets to aim for, KPIs or external achievements, they’re about bringing you more of the good things in life, the things which spark joy, or help make you a better person.\n\nThese things may sound daft if you’re used to a corporate world or hard targets, goals and KPIs, but they are, to my mind at least, vitally important for creating personal happiness, job satisfaction, a good balance between work and life, and striving to be a better parent and a better human.\n\nMy Five Work Intentions –\n\nSay yes to opportunities to develop myself\n\nLook at working towards a coaching or mentoring qualification\n\nStreamline my work processes and bring our systems up to scratch\n\nLearn to say no and to delegate where I can\n\nMake reflection a daily practice\n\nMy Five Personal Intentions –\n\nMove house and create a warm and loving home for my family\n\nFocus on quality time with my son\n\nGo on holidays with the people I love\n\nContinue my gentle health kick and get fitter and healthier\n\nSpend more time with friends and less of my own time working\n\nThere are other things I want to achieve and do. But if I can surround myself with the people who love and care for me, and make time to see them instead of working so much, then my heart will be fuller and my work/life balance will feel more comfortable.\n\nSo today I set these intentions and I commit to working towards achieving them. These are not resolutions, but achievable things which could change how my life feels. I know with the support of colleagues, friends and loved ones, I can take the steps towards making my work and my life balanced and fulfilling. They will also hopefully help to make me a more rounded person, a better mum, partner and friend.\n\nWhat are your intentions for 2024?\n\nShortbread is one of my favourite things to make. I love plain shortbread, but I also love slightly fancier shortbread, like my Cranachan shortbread. This month, after seeing some in a shop, I decided to try my hand at making a batch of Black Forest shortbread. Chocolate and cherries are a classic combination at any time of the year and I had a feeling they’d turn out pretty well.\n\nShortbread is a fairly simple thing to make, best made by hand rather than in a food mixer, and it’s softer and crumblier the less you handle it, so it’s great if you are short on time.\n\nBlack Forest Shortbread Biscuits\n\nIngredients:\n\n225g butter\n\n130g caster sugar\n\n300g plain flour\n\n25g cocoa powder\n\nHalf a teaspoon of vanilla extract\n\n100g chopped glacé or cocktail cherries\n\n100g milk chocolate chips or chunks\n\nTo decorate:\n\n100g milk chocolate\n\nSprinkles, I used decorative shimmer sugar crystals\n\nHow to make Black Forest Shortbread Biscuits:\n\nPre-heat your oven to 180°. You’ll need to have a couple of baking trays covered with greaseproof paper ready.\n\nIn a mixing bowl, thoroughly beat the butter and sugar together. Once fluffy, add the vanilla extract and your chopped cherries and chocolate chunks. Then, little by little add the plain flour and the cocoa powder. Mix with a wooden spoon as best you can. Try not to overwork it too much or the dough will go gluey.\n\nI find the following method tidier and it stops you manhandling the dough too much. Once the shortbread dough is almost mixed, tip it out onto a large sheet of greaseproof paper; bring the dough together with your hands and then fold the paper in half with the mixture sandwiched in between.\n\nWith a rolling-pin, roll it out so it’s about 5mm thick and cut into rounds. I used a glass for this and carefully lifted each shortbread biscuit onto the baking tray. You should get around 18 shortbread biscuits out of the dough.\n\nBake in the pre-heated oven for 12-15 minutes. Keep an eye on the shortbread, with the cocoa powder it’s harder to see when they’re done. If you can, lift one gently and check it’s cooked underneath. Once they’re baked, remove from the oven and leave to cool on a rack.\n\nWhilst the shortbread biscuits are cooling, melt the chocolate. I usually ping it in the microwave in short bursts, stirring every 30 seconds until it’s the right consistency, it takes less than two minutes, but go carefully! Once melted, dip each shortbread into the chocolate and half coat it, put your biscuit back on the greaseproof paper and sprinkle with your chosen sprinkles. I had some shimmer sugar crystals, so I used them. Try to resist eating your shortbread until the chocolate has set. Pop them in the fridge to set if you’re in a hurry.\n\nThese are a really delicious treat. They’re lovely even before they’re dipped in chocolate, but that really does take it to the next level.\n\nIf you enjoyed this, you might also like –\n\nCinnamon and raisin shortbread\n\nChocolate cheesecake with cherries\n\nChocolate and cherry brownies\n\nChocolate cherry Porter cake\n\nDanish Butter Biscuits\n\nIn 2024, Chinese New Year falls on Saturday 10th February. Chinese New Year is a glorious, colourful celebration of the New Year, just when I feel the year is at its darkest and gloomiest. This year is the Chinese Year of the Dragon, which is excellent news for me, as I was born in the Year of the Dragon.\n\nIn Manchester the Chinese New Year celebrations are legendary. There is usually a big parade, Chinese crafts exhibition, a big celebration in Albert Square and a fantastic street food market.\n\n2024 is the Chinese Year of the Dragon. The Dragon is the fifth of the 12-year cycle of animals which make up the Chinese zodiac in the Chinese calendar. People born in the years 1928, 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000 and 2012 will celebrate their Chinese Zodiac year in 2024. People born in the Year of the Dragon are said to be lively, intelligent, enthusiastic, and excitable. They are often leaders who strive for perfection and they’re not easily discouraged.\n\nDownload this free Year of the Dragon printable colouring sheet here.\n\nTo celebrate Chinese New Year and the Year of the Dragon, I’ve created two different colouring sheets for children, or indeed adults. It’s a simple sheet which you can print out on A4 paper. All you need are some felt tips or colouring pencils and it should keep the kids entertained for a little while. If you want to extend the fun, you could also try making an egg-box dragon, a Chinese drum, or some traditional red envelopes for Chinese New Year.\n\nDownload this free Year of the Dragon printable colouring sheet here.\n\nThey’re pretty cute aren’t they? They’re both A4 sized, so just print off however many you need. Give the kids a million coloured pencils or felt tips and let them go wild with them. Adults who enjoy colouring in might also like to get in on the action too.\n\nI’d love to know what you’ll be doing to celebrate Chinese New Year. Let me know in the comment box below.
