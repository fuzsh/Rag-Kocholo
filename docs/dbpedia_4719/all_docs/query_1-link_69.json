        "text": "Excerpt from Cinderella\n\nThe child is not a pretty child. She is brown-skinned like her father, and has her mother's wide mouth!\n\nThis was the dictum spoken authoritatively by Hester's aunt as, suddenly grown shy and awkward, that trembling mite stood clutching a corner of her clean pinafore with one hand, while the forefinger of the other went up rustically to the maligned mouth, as if to accentuate its width.\n\nThen as Hester stood a moment, her heart beating wildly within her, her eyes gypsy-dark and gleaming, the tall majestic lady took up the burden of her prophecy, Mother, you spoil the girl indeed you do. I said so to Sylvanus, my husband, only this morning. Where is Sylvanus? Oh, he has been detained by an important case. He will follow immediately!\n\nAbout the Publisher\n\nForgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

He was born at Duchrae, Balmaghie, Kirkcudbrightshire, the illegitimate son of dairymaid Annie Crocket. He was raised on his grandfather's Galloway farm, won a bursary to Edinburgh University in 1876, and graduated from there during 1879.\n\nAfter some years of travel, he became in 1886 the Free Kirk minister of Penicuik. During that year he produced his first publication, Dulce Cor (Latin: Sweet Heart), a collection of verse under the pseudonym Ford Brereton. He eventually abandoned the Free Church ministry for full-time novel-writing in 1895.\n\nThe success of J. M. Barrie and the Kailyard school of sentimental, homey writing had already created a demand for stories in Lowland Scots when Crockett published his successful story of The Stickit Minister in 1893. It was followed by a rapidly produced series of popular novels frequently featuring the history of Scotland or his native Galloway. Crockett made considerable sums of money from his writing and was a friend and correspondent of R. L. Stevenson, but his later work has been criticised as being over-prolific and feebly sentimental.\n\nCrockett was well travelled in Europe and beyond, spending time in most European countries and he wrote several novels of European history including The Red Axe (1898), A Tatter of Scarlet (1913), and the non-fiction The Adventurer in Spain (1903) which holds its own against Robert Louis Stevenson's travel writing.\n\nHe died in France on 16 April 1914."
