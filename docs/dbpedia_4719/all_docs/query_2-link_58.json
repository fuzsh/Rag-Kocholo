        "text": "Emissions from UK peatland could cancel out all carbon emissions reduction achieved through new and existing forests, unless the government takes action on restoring and rewetting our peatlands, according to new analysis from CPRE, the countryside charity.\n\nThe government’s plans to capture carbon emissions through tree planting will be severely undermined unless radical action on peatland emissions is taken, according to new analysis of land use figures from CPRE, the countryside charity. CPRE is therefore calling on the government to view nature-based solutions in the round and maintain current ambitions on tree planting but do much more to invest in peatland restoration and supporting the farming industry to shift to sustainable practices where farming on drained peatlands.\n\nLess than one-tenth of peatlands’ contribution to the climate emergency is currently accounted for in overall UK greenhouse gas emissions reporting. But at least 18.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, mostly carbon dioxide, are emitted from peatlands every year in the UK. England, with a quarter of the peatland area, is responsible for 55% of these emissions. Based on current government tree planting ambitions (30,000 hectares per year by 2025), an estimated 18.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions would be captured through new and existing forests annually, but not before 2050 to 2055. That’s why action to stop emissions from degraded peatland must go hand in hand with other natural solutions like tree planting.\n\nPeatlands can store vast amounts of carbon in a stable form for millennia if not degraded forming some of the greatest carbon sinks on the planet. But the government’s current commitment to restore 35,000 hectares of peatland by 2025 does not go far enough. CPRE is calling for the government to commit to urgent and sustained action on peat and peatlands in its forthcoming England Peat Strategy by:\n\nBringing to an end further degradation of peat by 2030 in line with existing commitments to sustainably manage all soils by 2030\n\nCommitting to ambitious national targets for rewetting and restoration of upland and lowland peatlands in England to secure their carbon stores by 2030\n\nSupporting a managed transition away from the destructive use of lowland peat soils over the next decade as part of green recovery by investing in wet farming research, applied projects and developing new markets for wet farming products.\n\nTom Fyans, director of campaigns and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said:\n\n‘It’s no wonder that peatlands are often referred to as the UK’s rainforests. Properly managed peatland stores huge amounts of carbon and water and provides a haven for plant- and wildlife. But continuing to neglect these natural carbon stores could backfire. The government has paid too little attention to emissions from peatland – as things stand, they aren’t even properly included in current emissions monitoring. This seriously threatens the effectiveness of other nature-based solutions, like tree planting, in tackling the climate emergency.\n\n‘We need to harness the power of all of our natural allies in the fight against runaway climate change. With the right investment, peat could play a pivotal role in tackling the climate and nature emergencies. For this we not only need much greater levels of investment from government in restoring or rewetting peatlands, we need a strategy for a fair and managed transition to move businesses away from dependency on destructive use of peatlands. Incentivising alternatives to harmful exploitation could be the difference in ending the UK’s farming and land use contribution to the climate emergency.’\n\nIt’s estimated that there are over three billion tonnes of carbon stored in the peatlands in the UK – equivalent to all carbon stored in the forests of the UK, Germany and France put together. Only 22% of the UK’s peatlands are estimated to remain in a ‘near-natural’ state and so not contributing to global heating. Peatlands’ capacity to store carbon, floodwaters and provide a haven for wildlife is immense. So much so, the ONS reports that restoring 55% of peatlands to near-natural condition is estimated to have a present net benefit value of around £50 billion.\n\nRichard Lindsay, head of environmental and conservation research at the University of East London’s Sustainability Research Institute, said:\n\n‘Peatlands have long been the Cinderella habitat, hidden in the shadow of forests when it comes to carbon, water and biodiversity, yet they represent the UK’s most extensive terrestrial semi-natural habitat, peat-dominated catchments provide as much as 70% of all drinking water, they contain an unrivalled record of our distant past and uniquely allow us to come face-to-face with our ancestors, and thin peat just 30 cm deep can contain as much carbon within a hectare as all the carbon contained in a hectare of tropical rainforest.\n\n‘It would be the ultimate irony if we were to destroy our carbon-equivalent of rainforest by planting trees on such peat in order to capture carbon. Equally, it makes no sense to be burning these ancient landscapes regularly for sport4, when just restoring a living layer can add 60 tonnes of carbon per hectare to these iconic landscapes.\n\nPlease call our Head of External Affairs, Sarah McMonagle, on 07554 422 900 for further information.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nAbout the analysis:"
