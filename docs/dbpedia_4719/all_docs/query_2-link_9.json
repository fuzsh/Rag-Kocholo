        "text": "The British Silent Film Festival is great, but it only happens once a year, when we are lucky. So the annual British Silent Film Festival Symposium, taking place each spring at King’s College London, is a very Good Thing indeed. It’s a meeting of the clan, really, a gathering together of everyone who cares about British silent cinema in this town, and hopefully beyond. At the symposium, these likeminded souls can gather to watch films, debate them, listen to papers and eat biscuits.\n\nThis year’s event takes place over two days (6-7 April 2017) and builds on the format of previous years by incorporating screenings in between the papers. And biscuits. These screenings are of little-seen films, and the papers cover a wide range of topics all within the field of British cinema and cinemagoing during the silent era.\n\nHere is what the organisers have to say:\n\nBook your place now, to avoid disappointment. The symposium costs £20 for a single-day pass, or £30 for both days. Which is an absolute bargain, surely. Here’s the place where you can book.\n\nAnd should you need further persuasion, here is the full line-up of speakers and papers and films. No, you’re not seeing things. That is my name on the schedule, on Friday afternoon. Gulp. I hope you enjoy my paper on Pandora’s Box, but by that point it will be very nearly pub o’clock anyway. You’ll see some more familiar faces on that list too –including Silent London contributors and friends.\n\nTHURSDAY 6th April\n\n09.00-11.00 – SESSION ONE: NEW TECHNOLOGIES\n\nWelcome & Housekeeping (10 mins)\n\n09.10: Tony Fletcher – Screening and Talk: The Transition to Sound 1925-7 (60 mins)\n\n10.10: Rebecca Harrison – Class and the Train’s Effect: Reinvestigating the ‘Panicking Audience’\n\n10.30: Bryony Dixon & Steve Foxon – Trainspotting Too: Reporting from the BFI’s Victorian Project\n\n10.50: Questions\n\n11.00-11.30 TEA BREAK\n\n11.30-1.00 – SESSION TWO: EARLY EXCITEMENTS\n\n11.30: Stephen Morgan – Seismic Sturnutations: That Fatal Sneeze (1907) as Earthquake Film\n\n11.50: Andrew Shail – The Series Character on UK Screens before the First World War\n\n12.10: Stephen Bottomore – Caravans and Kinematographs: the origins of the public health film\n\n12.30: SCREENING – The Fly Pest (1909) 35mm 6 mins\n\n12.40: Questions\n\n13.00-14.00 LUNCH BREAK\n\n14.00-14.30 – SESSION THREE: OLD AND NEW FRIENDS\n\n14.00: Gerry Turvey – ‘A New Palace of Pleasure’: The Bohemia Cinema Pleasure Garden at Finchley, North London, 1912-18\n\n14.20: Lucie Dutton MA – Maurice Elvey and Hindle Wakes: “It’s really about something – it’s about people”\n\n14.40: Jo Botting – Adrian Brunel and the ‘missing’ film A Light Woman\n\n15.00: SCREENING – A Light Woman (1928) DVD 25 mins [9.5mm cut-down version]\n\n15.30-16.00 TEA BREAK\n\n16.00-18.00 – SESSION FOUR: SCOTLAND ON THE SOUTH COAST\n\n18.00: Ellen Cheshire – Making progress in re-assessing Progress Films\n\n18.20: SCREENING – A Lowland Cinderella (1921) 35mm\n\n***************************\n\nFRIDAY 7th April\n\n09.20 – 10.30 – SESSION FIVE: SOUND AND MUSIC, SCOTLAND AND INDIA\n\n09.20: Jude Cowan Montague – The many voices of Gracie Fields: Sally in Our Alley (1931)\n\n09.40: *John Ritchie – Silent Hollywood Scotland: Seeing Ourselves As Others See Us\n\n10.00: *Sarah Neely – Tantalizing fragments: Scots language, dialect and song in the early talkies\n\n10.20: Questions\n\n10.30-11.00 TEA BREAK\n\n11.00 – 12.30 – SESSION SIX: SCOTLAND AND EMPIRE\n\n11.00: Caroline Merz – Scotland and Empire: The Seven Seas Screen Productions\n\n11.20: SCREENING – The Unsleeping Eye (MacDonald, 1928) 35mm 68 mins\n\n12.30-14.00 LUNCH BREAK\n\n14.00-15.30 – SESSION SEVEN: SOUND AND THE BRITISH EXHIBITOR\n\n14.00: *Nyasha Sibanda – “Almost, If Not Quite, As Good as the W.E.”: On Sound Apparatus 1929-1930\n\n14.20: *Geoff Brown – How To Lose Money In British Films: A SHAREHOLDER’S GUIDE\n\n14.40: *Laraine Porter – ‘Avoiding a disaster attaching to a stampede’; the CEA and the reluctance of British cinemas to wire for sound\n\n15.00: *John Izod – The Empowering of British Cinema Operators, 1927-33\n\n15.20: Questions\n\n15.30-16.00 TEA BREAK\n\n16.00-18.00 – SESSION EIGHT: TALES FROM THE THE 1920s\n\n16.00: Christina Hink – Machine Aesthetics in The Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands (1927)\n\n16.20: Pamela Hutchinson – Pandora’s Box (1929): Lulu’s ‘misadventures’ in London\n\n16.40: Chris O’ Rourke: ‘The Worst Kind of American Sensationalism’: Selling Stardom in the 1922 Daily Sketch Contest\n\n17.00: Bryony Dixon, Laraine Porter – plenary and final discussion\n\n*indicates that speakers are part of the ‘British Silent Cinema and the Transition to Sound 1927-1932’ research project co-ordinated at De Montfort University, Leicester and the University of Stirling, and funded by the Arts & Humanities Research Council."
