        "text": "I have read other stories that contain speaking animals and critters such as silkies (mermaids, or female seals that are human-like), fairies (large and small), leprechauns, etc, but not in this story. Ireland is the only culture that had silkies, or human like feminine seals I know of. Many animals don't speak, though they are endowed with human-like qualities.\n\nThis is a legend that predates (obviously) the Cinderella myth, as there are many similarities. The \"god-mother\" is the \"henwife\" of the myth, who can arrange to have the cinder Ellen show up not at a ball, but in the village church decked out in the finest attire and on various steeds for three Sabbath's in a row. Her \"evil step-sisters\" and \"step mother\" are very much the same as in the Cinderella myth, but are going to church without the cinder girl, Trembling, because she has too many chores heaped on her by the two sisters. Remember in old Ireland that the village church was one of the sole social functions where a \"good girl\" or boy met their future mate. The \"prince\" is actually a prince of \"Omanya,\" a dialect contorted (by today's standards) name of one of the counties of old Ireland, and searches for her high and low much as the prince in the European myth. There are actually several versions of this very story.\n\nI strongly suspect these are euphemisms that are culture based and have largely lost their currency over time. They real meaning of the \"henwife\" and \"honey-bird\" and \"honey-finger\" may be lost on us today because our references have changed. Kind of like a \"washboard\" road. This is not the only story I have come across a \"henwife,\" usually, but not always, a powerful and charming woman albeit a peasant. I have even come across the reference to \"honey bird\" and \"honey finger\" before, too, but the meaning always escapes me.\n\nI am reading ancient Irish mythology and legend, specifically in \"Fair, Brown and Trembling\" a precursor to the Cinderella story, wherein a \"henwife\" advises the heroine, Trembling, that, \"When Trembling was dressed and ready, the henwife said, 'I have a honey-bird here to sit on your right shoulder, and a honey-finger to put on your left. At the door stands a milk-white mare, with a golden saddle for you to sit on, and a golden bridle to hold in your hand.' \"\n\nThe question I have is this: What, precisely, is a honey-bird and a honey-finger? Are they outdated euphemisms that have entirely lost their meaning today? Like 'henwife?' What was a hen-wife in old Ireland?\n\nI'm not sure that you should be reading Irish folk-tales if you expect all birds which appear in them to be known to ornithologists.\n\nA henwife is a woman who is responsible for keeping domestic fowl, and hence associated with domesticity in general, and with poor, simple, living.\n\nFor me the honey-bird is some sort of magical bird - henwives know about chickens, of course - and a honey-finger some sort of magical finger. This would accord with the way folk-tales in general refuse to observe the laws of physics, and of the material world in general.\n\nThe henwife is giving these magical presents to Trembling, together with the dress, so that she could go to church as instructed. The point of the honey-bird and the honey-finger is that they identify Trembling's robes, and the inability of people to find a robe with those features means that they cannot find the girl who wore it.\n\nHENWIFE\n\nWictionary and YourDictionary.com define an henwife as a \"woman who is in charge of domestic fowls, sometimes used contemptuously about men.\" I am not sure what the last half of that statement means. Merriam-Webster define henwife as a woman who raises poultry. I can get that far, but the term was used as an euphemism and archetype at various times in European culture, and had an additional and deeper connotation, much like 'auto salesman' or 'postal worker' or 'politician' does in modern American English. It is this connotation I cannot readily place, as it appears to have lost all currency after many hundreds of years. She is presented as a noble and wise domestic plebeian female in most (but not all) European (and especially Irish and Scottish) faiytales. I actually found a discussion on the henwife in the \"Myth & Moore\" blog at http://www.terriwindling.com/blog/2015/02/lolly-willows.html by Terri Windling. She writes,\n\n\"The Hen Wife, related to the witch, the seer, and the herbalist, but different from them too: a distinct and potent archetype of her own, an enchanted figure beneath a humble white apron. We find her dispensing wisdom and magic in the folk tales of the British Isles and far beyond (all the way to Russia and China): a woman who is part of the community, not separate from it like the classic \"witch in the woods\"; a woman who is married, domesticated like her animal familiars, and yet conversant with women's mysteries, sexuality, and magic.\"\n\nI think the henwife was a term used largely to define a wise and noble domestic plebeian woman that interfered in the lives of the hero in many European tales. She is a powerful and potent symbol and archetype, especially in old Ireland.\n\nThe suffix -wife was used of any woman who were employed in a trade (Compare fishwife), or had other responsibility of something: hence housewife - the woman in charge of the household.\n\nYou need not bother with the \"contemptuously about men\" use: the simple basis behind it is that if you call a man a woman, it was an insult as women were seen as being unable to do anything properly.\n\nAs far as \"Honey-bird\" is concerned, I found a reference at https://archive.org/stream/folklore05britgoog/folklore05britgoog_djvu.txt The text, which seems to have been a comparative table of variants on the Cinderella story, is badly formatted. You will find the honey-bird reference via a search of the page for honey-bird.\n\nAt this point, you will see that, in the text,\n\n(+ starlings on links to shoulders).\n\nand (honey-bird » finger links to and stud).\n\nIt seems as if the original tale has been enhanced with the conversion of starling to \"honey-bird\" and a stud to \"honey-finger\"\n\n\"Stud\" as in piece of wood or sensual male?\n\nNeither*. A stud will be a badge, button, or something similar (compare \"collar stud\") - we can assume that it is \"magical\" or similar, probably by virtue of a design upon it.\n\nOED again:\n\nHoney (adj.) 5. Now chiefly colloq.\n\na. As a term of endearment or affectionate form of address: sweetheart, darling. Formerly freq. Irish English, Sc., and Eng. regional (north.). In northern English use (in form hinny) used to address a man by members of either sex (now rare). In later use chiefly N. Amer., esp. as a colloquial form of address (sometimes without affectionate connotations).\n\ne.g. “Honey, I’ve shrunk the kids!”\n\nBut the b, definition is probably more what we want:\n\nb. A person who is beloved of another; a lover,\n\n1713 J. Smith Poems upon Several Occasions 295 Resolving to solace with Crony, She took the Shepherd for her Honey.\n\nIn this sense, it has the nuance of being capable of attracting the object of the girl’s affections.\n\n* and I've got £100 that says there are no sexual connotations to this story.\n\nThank you, PaulQ. Your point on the suffix -wife is well taken. I went to the reference you kindly provided and couldn't make much more sense of it. Seems as if you are correct. Interesting that \"starling\" should be changed to \"honey-bird,\" and that honey-finger is related to \"stud\" in these notes. \"Stud\" as in piece of wood or sensual male? (I suspect the author meant \"piece of wood.\") Still begs the question of what the original meaning was ... no? But there are more clues, it is just that I am too dense to understand them! I note both the 'honey-bird' and 'honey-finger' are placed on her bilateral shoulders. Another clue.\n\nI find that highly unlikely, that someone would replace easily comprehensible words with incomprehensible ones. 'Honey-bird' and 'honey-finger' don't sound like any terms I've ever heard before, not even in Scottish lowland folk stories. I would guess they are literal translations of Gaelic terms, perhaps there is an original version of this story in the Irish language.\n\nEDIT: sorry, I mean to reply to PaulQ's post above rather than directly to your reply.\n\nI find that highly unlikely, that someone would replace easily comprehensible words with incomprehensible ones.\n\nI don't know whether you tried to make sense of the book at the link, but this is exactly what seems to have been done. It's a fair bet that the author did not simply pull the words out of a hat, and in his idiolect the combination had the desired nuance (Consider \"a honey trap.\"). It may well be that the \"honey\" comes from the Irish and is a poor translation. But looking to the context, the idea is that Trembling tries to attract a man on the instructions of the henwife. The henwife plays the role that the fairy-godmother plays in Cinderella. The fairy godmother and the henwife provide magical objects that will attract the man.\n\nGiven that honey has the romantic nuance, I think we are safe ground in taking them to be love-charms of some sort.\n\nI don't know whether you tried to make sense of the book at the link, but this is exactly what seems to have been done.

He doesn't seem to have spoken any Irish at all so I'm guessing he got hold of the story in its English form, although that was almost certainly translated from Irish by someone before him. Anyhow, from the information in his Wikipedia page, we can safely assume that he had not the slightest idea what what 'honey-bird' and 'honey-finger' meant himself, which suggests that the only people who can tell us for sure are 19th Century Irish people, or Gaelic speakers with access to the original Gaelic version, if such a thing still exists.\n\nI agree with you however that they are magic charms intended to help her attract her Prince Charming. In the Scottish version of the story there are native Scottish magic charms used (namely 'cantrips' and starlings, which are associated with love in Celtic culture apparently).\n\nMy! A wonder-world of clues now! Thank you again, PaulQ, for you most excellent research on the subject. You make most excellent points on the use of \"stud\" as well as \"honey.\"\n\n(Copperknickers) Thanks for the reference to the book, \"English Fairy Tales: And More, English Fairy Tales.\" I have studied some of the references Google has put on the web, and there are a good many clues. I wonder why the author changed \"starlings\" to \"honey-bird?\" Or what it is about starling that have them associated with physical love in the Celtic culture? I may as well ask what the salmon has to do with knowledge ... I have, somewhere, an old Irish to English translation guide, so I will find it and consult it on the Irish for 'honey.' Since so much old Irish seems to be completely lost, I am not sure it will not help much. I suspect you and PaulQ are on to the jist of the meaning. Honey is, and has always been an attracting substance, and it is probably in this light that the connotations for 'honey bird' and 'honey finger' are used.\n\n(PaulQ) You are definitely on to the meaning of them (the honey-objects) being man-trap love charms of some sort. And I think your analysis of \"honey\" is spot on.\n\n(Packard) Thank you for your reference to an earlier take on the subject, which I had read but the question didn't seem to be resolved satisfactorily. I note that although the real \"honeybird\" was not discovered and named until 1850, perhaps the reason for the naming of the bird is still a clue. I think you see my point when I consider today's connotation of \"honey finger\" that it does not seem to fit the connotation of the phrase in the story. Though it does seem at least connected to the idea of an attraction (romantic) of some sort or another!\n\nThank you all, again. BTW, PaulQ, I fear you may loose your 100 pounds ... there are sexual connotations to everything.\n\n(Copperknickers) Thanks for the reference to the book, \"English Fairy Tales: And More, English Fairy Tales.\" I have studied some of the references Google has put on the web, and there are a good many clues. I wonder why the author changed \"starlings\" to \"honey-bird?\"\n\nRemember that these stories would have been transmitted orally. Often they originated in a foreign country and were adapted to give them a local flavour, as well as naturally changing over time and being mixed with other stories, or having elements of other stories inserted into them. Plus this kind of adjectival expression is a staple of oral literature because it helps you remember the narrative structure of the story better. They also just sound more poetic.\n\nOr what it is about starling that have them associated with physical love in the Celtic culture?\n\nStarlings are associated with Branwen, a Celtic love goddess, because there was a legend about her having trained a starling to speak in the Mabinogion. The reason for this is obvious to anyone who is ornithologically inclined, namely starlings are the parrots of Europe, they can mimic the human voice. It's highly probable that the 'honey-bird' is just a poetic description (perhaps an established nickname in Ireland) for a bird such as a starling, intended to give Trembling the ability to speak or sing gracefully, with 'honeyed words'.\n\nStarlings are associated with Branwen, a Celtic love goddess, because there was a legend about her having trained a starling to speak in the Mabinogion.

I think I have the jist of the meaning behind the terms now. Though I don't have it specifically, I think the story is conveying much of what you and PaulQ and others have written regarding the connotations behind the identity of the objects 'honey-finger,' 'honey bird' and the 'henwife.'\n\nYou sound like you appreciate 'fairy' tales, too, Coppernickers. I find that generally they are rich in wisdom, and the understanding of what our ancestors were thinking, feeling, fearing. Before there was video and DVDs people told stories. We are very much a story-telling people, even through the ages. I guess the reason I wanted to understand what these terms meant in the story was due to my desire to understand the everyday lives of my ancestors. Their \"points of reference\" so to speak."
