        "text": "The Magic Kingdom:\n\nThe first of Walt Disney World's four theme parks is the Magic Kingdom. Magic Kingdom is the original Walt Disney park in Orlando Florida, having been dedicated on October 25th 1971, and is divided into six worlds, arranged like a wheel, with the magnificent Cinderella's Castle as the centerpiece at the hub of the wheel. For most people, it's also probably the most magical and memorable of the four parks, so it's well worth budgeting time so that spending at least one full day in the Magic Kingdom is possible.\n\nMagic Kingdom is the undisputed king of all theme parks, drawing in more yearly visitors than any other. It has stayed true to Walt Disney's vision of a clean and safe place for families to enjoy spending their time together. No trip to Walt Disney World is complete without a visit to the Magic Kingdom.\n\nThe Magic Kingdom is divided into five unique areas: Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, Frontierland, Liberty Square and Adventureland. Prepare yourself to experience true Walt Disney magic when visiting each of these uniquely themed environments. Throughout all the lands, you will find over 48 attractions, each with different characters and exciting things to see and experience. At the Magic Kingdom, you will find everything from: live shows based on classic Walt Disney stories, Disney characters, rides, shops, and restaurants. The Magic Kingdom is also known for its spectacular parades and awesome nighttime firework displays.\n\nMost of the famous Walt Disney characters including Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, the Queen of Hearts, Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee, Pluto, Goofy, Minnie Mouse, and the rest of the gang can be found scattered at various places throughout Disney's Magic Kingdom, posing for family photographs and autographs.\n\nThe Magic Kingdom begins with Main Street USA, this is the place for you and your family to visit interesting shops and one of the best places to buy Walt Disney memorabilia, gifts and souvenirs. As you walk down Main Street USA, you will find yourself approaching Magic Kingdom's Cinderella's Castle. \"Don't forget to take a picture with you and your family in front of this world famous structure\".\n\nThe Magic Kingdom is filled with many must see rides and attractions. Splash Mountain, one of the Magic Kingdom's most popular rides, it is based on the 1946 Walt Disney film \"Song of the South\". Be prepared for a wet and wild ride down its 52 foot plunge. Other favorites include Pirates of the Caribbean, the Jungle Cruise, and the Haunted Mansion. These are great attractions that are popular with a wide range of visitors. Don't forget Space Mountain where you will be rocketed into another galaxy aboard this high-speed roller coaster. It is one of the best attractions the Magic Kingdom has to offer.\n\nAt the Magic Kingdom, you can enjoy thrilling rides and attractions, as well as afternoon parades, interact with Walt Disney characters and get their autographs, eat at great restaurants, and witness spectacular nighttime fireworks displays. There is so much to see and do it may take you more than one day to experience everything on your wish list. One thing is for sure, the Magic Kingdom is something that you will remember for a lifetime.\n\nDisney World's Epcot Center:\n\nIn the early 1960s, Walt Disney was a massive success in the entertainment industry. He was also blessed with a loving family and many grandchildren. In watching his grandchildren grow up, Walt Disney began to worry about the world in the future in which they would inhabit. He began to notice that the modern cities were hectic, disorganized, dirty, and riddled with crime. This was a far cry from Disney's super-clean and controlled Disneyland Park in California.\n\nAt the same time, Walt Disney had given the East Coast a glimpse of his style of entertainment with the four pavilions he developed for the 1964-1965 New York World's Fair. Walt determined, based on how well-received the fair exhibitions were, that the public was ready for an \"East Coast Disneyland\".\n\nEpcot Center was to be Walt Disney's dream of the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. In some ways, the forward thinking of Epcot Center's Future World and the diversity of cultures at World Showcase kept a part of Walt's dream alive. Disney, in this case, turned the idea of Epcot Center into a fantastic theme park.\n\nWalt began to realize that all that he and his imagineers had learned about buildings and space in relation to people in the development of Disneyland could be put to use in planning communities and even whole cities. This got Walt thinking, and he began to engross himself in books about city planning. This was all that was needed to pull something of such magnitude off.\n\nEpcot Center, the second oldest of Disney World's Floridian Theme Parks, was opened in 1982. Visitors will probably need two full days to see and do everything within the park.\n\nEpcot Center, or the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow was Walt Disney's visionary idea comprising a huge transparent dome containing an entire city of harmony and progress. With Walt's death in 1966, many of the original ideas for Disney's Epcot Center were lost. The resulting Epcot Center built by the Disney imagineers is a compromise between the parts of the dream laid out by Walt and what could be achieved in practice. It is subdivided into two main sections.\n\nEpcot Center's \"Future World\"\n\nEpcot Center's Future World, which opens and closes) earlier than the World Showcase, covers almost the entire area between the main entrance to Epcot Center and the large lagoon. It is themed into distinct pavilions and is dominated by Spaceship Earth, a large 180 ft. geodesic sphere made from white aluminum. As well as providing a focus for the park, Spaceship Earth contains a slow ride which winds its way along a track through the dome itself, tracing the history of human communication from cave drawings through satellite and television.\n\nBehind Spaceship Earth is the Showcase Plaza with the Epcot Center fountain, and is flanked on either side by a curved \"Innoventions\" building containing examples of \"technology from tomorrow\", though in reality almost everything on display has been with us for a few years in one form or another.\n\nBuckle up and take the ride of your life up bumpy terrain, through hair-pin turns, into freezing cold chambers and on to 50-degree banked curves at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. It's all the hair-raising challenges of an automotive proving ground, except this time you're the test driver.\n\nThe Wonders of Life contains \"Body Wars\", a turbulent simulation ride through the human body. Other attractions include the Wondercycles, a ride where passengers cycle through the Epcot Center which is presented in front of you on a television display, along with distance traveled and energy expended. The recently refurbished Universe of Energy features \"Ellen's Energy Adventure\", presented by Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nIn the Living Seas you can explore a large man-made coral reef, swarming with tropical fish, or even view sharks and manatees up close.\n\nThe Land features the Circle of Life, an environmental fable with the characters from the Lion King. Living with the Land is a sedate boat ride and walk with an agricultural theme, demonstrating examples of soil-free gardening, plant biotechnology, fish farming, and pest management. The Journey Into Imagination Pavilion houses the 'Honey I Shrunk the Audience' 3-D theatre presentation.\n\nEpcot Center's \"The World Showcase\"\n\nThe World Showcase covers the area around the lagoon at Epcot Center, and provides a view of the cultural heritage of eleven varied nations including Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, Italy, United States, Japan, Morocco, France, the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nEach individual pavilion houses various attractions, including restaurants, rides, cinema presentations, live shows, and shops selling articles from the country concerned. The Rose & Crown Pub in the United Kingdom, for example, sells a range of typical British Beers (Bass, Guinness, Harp) in a traditional British Pub environment. In The American Adventure, an audio-animatronics show depicting America's \"incredible struggles and triumphs\" can be seen.\n\nOverall, there is much less of a focus on the classic Walt Disney characters within Epcot Center, with character appearances very rare, although character dining with Mickey Mouse and other characters is available at the Garden Grill Restaurant in the Land Pavilion.\n\nHollywood Studios\n\nDisney World's Hollywood Studios, which opened in 1989, has been transformed into the Gateway to the 100 Years of Disney Magic Celebration, the centerpiece of which is a huge 120-foot Sorcerer Mickey hat, built at the very end of the entry plaza, outside The Great Movie Ride attraction.\n\nDisney's Hollywood Studios evokes the Golden Age of Hollywood. It is a must see during your Walt Disney World Vacation. Disney's Hollywood Studios is the home to world-famous attractions and entertaining shows for your whole family. At Hollywood Studios the magic of show business and Walt Disney animation come to life right before your eyes.
