        "text": "Production\n\nMÃ©liÃ¨s modeled the film's visual style on the engravings of Gustave DorÃ©, who had illustrated the story for an edition of Perrault's fairy tales. (DorÃ© was stylistically influential across MÃ©liÃ¨s's career, especially in this film and in his film adaptations of four other works DorÃ© had illustrated: Red Riding Hood, Blue Beard, The Wandering Jew, and Baron Munchausen's Dream.)[7] The direct inspiration for the film of Cinderella was probably a stage adaptation premiered in 1896 by the ThÃ©Ã¢tre de la Galerie-Vivienne and played by the Troupe Raymond at MÃ©liÃ¨s's own theatre of illusions, the ThÃ©atre Robert-Houdin, at Christmastime of 1897.[8] MÃ©liÃ¨s may also have been inspired by the ThÃ©Ã¢tre du ChÃ¢telet's lavish 1895 stage production of the story.[9]\n\nCinderella was MÃ©liÃ¨s's first film with multiple scenes (tableaux), using six distinct sets and five changes of scene within the film. (His catalogue, by dividing the action into smaller beats, lists twenty tableaux within the film, a generous numbering probably devised for publicity reasons.)[1] So many extras were used in Cinderella that MÃ©liÃ¨s designated a Chief Extra to lead them.[4] The film's special effects were created with multiple exposures, dissolves, and substitution splices.[10]\n\nReception\n\nCinderella was MÃ©liÃ¨s's first major cinematic success.[11] It did well both in French fairground cinemas and at European and American music-halls, and inspired MÃ©liÃ¨s to create other lavishly designed storytelling films with multiple scenes.[8] His next film with multiple scenes, Joan of Arc (1900), was his first to surpass 200 meters of film in length, and was also a marked success.[11] According to the film historian Lewis Jacobs, Cinderella's use of spectacle on screen also influenced the films of Cecil B. DeMille.[8]\n\nMÃ©liÃ¨s made another adaptation of the story, Cinderella or the Glass Slipper, in 1912 under the supervision of PathÃ© FrÃ¨res. This version was not a success, partially because of directorial conflict between MÃ©liÃ¨s, Ferdinand Zecca, and Charles PathÃ©, and partially because MÃ©liÃ¨s's theatrical style had fallen out of fashion by 1912.[8]"
