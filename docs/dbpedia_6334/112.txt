A Harlem man faces multiple charges after leaving the scene of a serious accident in Columbia County earlier this week.

The sheriff’s office says 22 year old Hunter Harpstrite and 19 year old Faden Carter Christ, also of Harlem, were racing their motorcycles Sunday afternoon on Freeman Harriss Road …off Wrightsboro Road. Harpstrite lost control while rounding a curve and landed in a ditch. Christ also lost control and hit a culvert. He was ejected from the bike and landed near some trees.

Authorities say Harpstrite hid his motorcycle down a private road before calling for help. He’s been charged with serious injury by vehicle, hit and run, racing on highways or streets, and reckless driving.
