        "text": "Austin’s Daily Commentary – September 21, 2023\n\nAustin talks about citizens making decisions about who runs the government.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin: Just how ignorant are the citizens who are making decisions about the way that we run our government? It’s incredible. Ladies and gentlemen, when you ponder the ignorance as to the rules of the road in America when it comes to voting. The Annenberg Public Policy Survey of the University of Pennsylvania has their poll suggesting that a troubling number of Americans are incredibly uninformed when it comes to their own constitutional rights.\n\nThe survey, which is done every year on Constitution Day, shows that a significant number of Americans can’t name the three branches of government. Two thirds, 66% can name the three branches. Well, okay, got that going for us. 10% can list only two. 7% can list only one. And an astounding 17% cannot name a single branch of government.\n\nMeanwhile, when respondents were asked to name all the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution, most 77% could only name one freedom of speech. The level of ignorance involving Americans constitutional rights and the very rules that govern our entire governmental process and very complex system. It’s astounding to me. And yet these people show up to vote regularly every cut and pick in election season.\n\nBy the way, in this part of the country, those who tend to be the most uneducated about the rules of the land don’t vote for the party that elected the most controversial president that we’ve had in our lifetimes. That’s right. Ladies and gentlemen, the least informed voters do not support President Trump, at least not in the South. Hmm.\n\nWhat is it that we are missing here? Ladies and gentlemen, I’m not going to attempt to change the rules of voting in instituting a test on on Election Day, some kind of poll test. Having said that, when we trust uneducated folks to make important decisions that govern the rest of our lives, don’t be surprised when that airplane flies into the mountain. On more than one occasion. Ignorance results in catastrophe. And that’s the comment, I’m Austin Rhodes, AM 580/95.1 FM News Talk WGAC.\n\nFor more from The Austin Rhodes Show, click here.\n\n“Cody” Blaine Jackson is one half of the Kicks Wake Up Krew on Kicks 99, and also serves as the Digital Program Director for Beasley Media Group in Augusta.
