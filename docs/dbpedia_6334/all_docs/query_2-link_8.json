        "text": "Law Enforcement Announcement in Augusta – Austin’s Daily Commentary\n\nAustin talks about a major law enforcement announcement in Augusta-Richmond County.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin Rhodes: A major law enforcement announcement today in Augusta, Richmond County are Attorney General Chris Carr, along with the sheriff Richard Roundtree will be hosting, let’s see, officials from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, maybe some folks from the FBI, all about a major, major arrest, a major investigation that’s been completed. And I got to tell you, it’s people are being arrested. I’ve been told, even as we speak this morning. So no numbers are finalized yet.\n\nBut let’s just say a major, major announcement concerning, well, the streets of Augusta being cleaned up. And by the way, one of the major players involved in this effort is a young lady by the name of McKenzie Gray. McKenzie is a superstar prosecutor hired by the state attorney general himself to be in charge of gang prosecutions in this area.\n\nBy the way, Mckenzie Gray, a former assistant of Natalee Payne, a great assistant district attorney who was let go, run out of the office by our current district attorney, Jared Williams, because he did not like her and he wanted more minority participation in prosecutions in this area. Mackenzie is a white female. He wanted no part of her.\n\nToday, as the announcement is being read, understand the arrests that are being made could not be possible without the great work of Mckenzie Gray and everyone else in law enforcement, but particularly the superstar prosecutor Mckenzie. Oh my goodness gracious who was put out by Jared Williams.\n\nJared is a cancer. He needs to be removed. And you people in Richmond County need to get off your duff and do it at the ballot box as soon as possible. Good news today, but let’s keep everything in perspective. Could not be possible without the superstar prosecutor brought in by the Attorney General himself, Mckenzie Gray. Stay tuned. And that’s the comment, I’m Austin Rhodes, AM 580/95.1 FM News Talk WGAC.\n\nFor more from The Austin Rhodes Show, click here."
