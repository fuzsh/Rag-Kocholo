        "text": "Austin’s Daily Commentary – November 17, 2023\n\nAustin talks about the Major League Baseball All-Star Game for 2025 in Atlanta.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin Rhodes: Oh, I love the smell of vindication in the morning. Major League Baseball announcing that the 2025 All-Star Game is coming to Atlanta. Governor Brian Kemp and other Republicans, again, a whoop, whoop, a holler, holler. We were right. They were wrong. And don’t you know that? Absolutely.\n\nGeorgia’s voting laws haven’t changed, Kemp said yesterday. But it’s good to see Major League Baseball’s misguided understanding of them has. Oh, yes. The league pulled the all star game shortly after the state of Georgia overhauled election laws. Much needed overhauling, by the way, amid pressure from players and politicians, supposedly.\n\nAnd you know, Stacey Abrams, for good or for ill, had her fingerprints all over this thing. Some say that they believe that she didn’t have anything to do with it. And I’m not one of those.\n\nBottom line, though, Major League Baseball has figured out they screwed up. They’re coming to Georgia. We were right. They were wrong. La-te-da, I’m used to saying that a lot lately. And that’s the comment, I’m Austin Rhodes, AM 580/95.1 FM News Talk WGAC."
