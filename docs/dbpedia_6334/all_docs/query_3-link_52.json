When someone else’s carelessness or negligent actions cause you injury or damage, you deserve to be compensated for your losses.\n\nOur network of experienced lawyers has a track record of success when it comes to ensuring that their clients receive maximum compensation for their losses. They put in the time and effort necessary to make sure all of their clients are satisfied with the outcome their case receives.\n\nIf your insurance company tries to offer you a low settlement, your car crash lawyer will always be prepared to take your case to trial.\n\n3 Ways A Car Accident Law Firm in Harlem Can Help You\n\nProtecting The Rights of Accident Victims - Insurance companies often try to trick you into agreeing to a low settlement as fast as possible. When you hire an attorney, they handle all communication with the insurance company, so you do not need to worry about being taken advantage of.\n\nNo Upfront Legal Costs - Most car accident lawyers work on a contingency fee basis, which means you only pay when your case is won. There are not any up-front fees for legal services. Once your award is granted, a percentage of that will be used for legal fees.\n\nMaximize Your Injury Settlement - The insurance company will try to minimize or deny your claim for compensation in any way they can. Their goal is to pay you the least amount possible, but you deserve maximum compensation for your losses. With the help of a car accident lawyer, you will receive the settlement amount that you deserve.\n\n6 Steps To Take Immediately After Motor Vehicle Accident In Harlem\n\nCall The Police - Anytime you’re involved in a car accident, it’s crucial to call the police before leaving the accident scene. This will ensure that the accident is documented properly and the at-fault party is cited for the accident.\n\nTake Detailed Pictures of the Accident Scene - If you have the opportunity, try to take photos of the accident scene. Take pictures of the damages to your vehicle, the road conditions, and any visible injuries that you may have sustained. These pictures can help significantly when preparing your case.\n\nGet Skilled Medical Care - You should always get examined by an experienced local auto accident chiropractor after being involved in a car accident. Chiropractors are experts at diagnosing and treating many different types of accident injuries. Make sure you get examined as soon as possible; putting off treatment can drastically affect the outcome of your case.\n\nFollow Your Treatment Plan - Make sure you follow the treatment plan you are given. Do not miss appointments or forego recommended treatments. If you do not follow your treatment plan, the insurance company will minimize your claim or try to deny it altogether.\n\nGet A Copy Of The Police Report - You should request a copy of the police report as soon as possible. Your attorney will need this documentation as well as your medical provider if you want to make sure you’re not paying out-of-pocket for any of your treatment.\n\nHire A Top-Rated Harlem Auto Accident Law Firm - Do not wait to hire a car accident lawyer to help with your case. The sooner you get in touch with an attorney, the sooner you can rest easy knowing your claim is being handled with the utmost care.\n\nWhat Is The Average Car Accident Settlement In Harlem?\n\nEvery car accident is different, which means every accident victim will be eligible for a different amount of compensation based on the circumstances of their accident.\n\nCar Accident Lawyers help accident victims obtain compensation for both economic and non-economic losses.\n\nEconomic damages are intended to compensate the victim for monetary losses.\n\nGenerally speaking, these types of damages are easier to prove since documentation can be provided with evidence of loss.\n\nFor example:\n\nPast and Future Medical Expenses:Proven with medical records, diagnoses, treatment plans, and bills.\n\nLost Wages and Future Lost Wages:Proven by pay stubs, doctors’ notes stating time missed at work, and a letter from the employer.\n\nProperty Damage:Proven by receipts and invoices.\n\nOut-of-Pocket Expenses:Proven by receipts and may include any expenses accumulated as a direct result of the accident.\n\nNon-economic damages can be a bit trickier to prove. These damages include non-monetary losses. For example:\n\nPain and Suffering\n\nPhysical Disfigurement or Impairment\n\nLoss of Enjoyment of Life\n\nMental Anguish\n\nThese are the losses that can be very difficult to prove without the help of an experienced lawyer.\n\nTrying to obtain compensation for these losses on your own is nearly impossible. Your attorney will know what needs to be said and given to the insurance company to prove that you deserve to be compensated for these losses.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost To Hire An Auto Accident Attorney?\n\nA lawyer that handles car accident injuries is called a Personal Injury Lawyer.\n\nPersonal Injury Lawyers understand that getting in an accident is a difficult time and that victims should be able to focus on healing from their injuries.\n\nThis is why PI Lawyers work on a contingency fee basis.\n\nA contingency fee basis means that you do not pay anything upfront.\n\nYou only pay if the attorney can get you compensation. When the award is given, the attorney will take a percentage for legal fees.\n\nWhat Are Common Causes Of Car Accidents?\n\nOur experienced car accident injury lawyers represent nearly every type of motor vehicle accident. Here is a list of the most common causes of car accidents that our referred car accident attorneys represent:\n\nDistracted Driving\n\nDistracted driving is one of the top reasons car accidents occur on a daily basis.\n\nMany people have become accustomed to answering their phones, responding to text messages, programming their GPS devices, changing the radio station, putting on makeup, or even eating or drinking.\n\nUnfortunately, when the driver’s attention is taken from the road for any reason, a car accident is much more likely to occur. Even if the eyes are only averted for a second, that’s all it takes for an accident to happen.\n\nSpeeding\n\nSpeeding is such a common problem; there’s always someone in a hurry to be somewhere!\n\nThe biggest problem with speeding is the ability to stop suddenly is much more difficult if you’re going too fast. Stopping suddenly at high speeds is also extremely dangerous if the weather conditions are less than favorable that day. So many accidents could be avoided if everyone followed the rules of the road.\n\nDriving Under the Influence\n\nDriving under the influence of drugs or alcohol is another top reason when accidents occur.\n\nAnytime you’re impaired, your ability to react while driving is greatly diminished. Even with the accessibility of Uber and Lyft, these types of accidents still occur all too frequently.\n\nWeather\n\nUnfortunatley, the weather often plays a huge role when it comes to auto accidents.\n\nExcessive rain, snow, or sleet can easily cause a driver to lose control and cause an accident. Driving with extreme caution during bad weather is the best way to avoid causing an accident.\n\nWhat If I Don't Feel Pain After The Accident?\n\nIf you were involved in a car accident, you should be examined for injuries. Some injuries, such as whiplash, do not present themselves immediately.\n\nIf you have injuries that are not treated, they could lead to more complications in the future.\n\nIf you do have injuries that present themselves later but were not documented by a doctor, they may be excluded from your injury case, and you will not be compensated for medical expenses.\n\nHow Long Do I Have To File A Car Accident Claim in Harlem?\n\nWhen it comes to filing a car accident claim, you will have to file the claim within two years of the date of the accident. However, we strongly recommend that you file your claim as soon as possible.\n\nUnfortunatley, the longer you wait to file your claim, the harder it can be to receive maximum compensation for your losses.\n\nWe always suggest that you contact a lawyer within 24-48 hours of the accident. If you are unsure how an attorney can help you, it never hurts to call and schedule a free consultation to find out if you have a case.\n\nAn experienced lawyer will be able to tell you what steps you need to take to protect yourself and your rights.\n\nIf you don’t know which attorney to call, that’s okay! Arrowhead Clinic has you covered. When you contact our accident injury clinic, we put you in contact with one of the best car accident lawyers near you.\n\nYour initial consultation with the lawyer will always be free, and you will have the opportunity to find out how a car accident lawyer can benefit you.\n\nWill I Have To Go To Trial For My Car Wreck Case?\n\nIf you hire a car accident lawyer, you most likely will not have to go to trial.\n\nMost motor vehicle accident cases can be settled outside of court.\n\nYour attorney will discuss the options with you, and if it means going to trial to get the best outcome, they are prepared to fight for you.\n\nHire a Car Accident Attorney in Harlem, GA Today\n\nDon't Delay...Protect Your Compensation\n\nIf you were involved in a car accident, getting treatment and an attorney is essential for your health and finances.\n\nBy calling Arrowhead Clinic we can help you get the treatment you need for your injuries and refer you to the best car accident law firms.\n\nYou should focus on healing from your injuries, while your lawyer focuses on getting you compensation.\n\nWith our network of lawyers, you will receive a free consultation, so there is no risk!
