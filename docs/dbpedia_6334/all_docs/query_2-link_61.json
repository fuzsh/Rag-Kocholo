Radio emerged as a new mass medium in the 1920s, capturing the imagination of Americans and becoming a national craze. By the mid-1920s over 500 radio stations had sprung up across the country. \n\n2. Radio brought a sense of immediacy to events, allowing listeners to experience them live rather than reading about them later. Major events like presidential addresses and Lindbergh's return to the US after his historic flight were broadcast nationwide.\n\n3.

Popular radio programs engaged millions of listeners nationwide and helped create a shared national culture during hard times.",
