        "text": "You know what I love about Golf Week? It’s the Masters specialty drinks and food menus. Local restaurants pull out some awesome tricks and treats for the locals and travelers to try.\n\nWhen it comes to crafting a special menu for Masters week, it’s not just happening here in the CSRA, it’s happening all over the nation!\n\nIn Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, about five hours away from Augusta, Drunken Jack’s Restaurant and Lounge will honor the Masters with two special drinks! One is called Tee Time and the other is the Sweet and Spicy Watermelon Margarita. They will create the drinks with Elijah Craig Bourbon and Maestro Dobel Tequila.\n\nEven further from Augusta is Rockfish in Edgartown, Massechesuts. They also have two special cocktails dedicated to this special week.\n\nAzalea Cocktail: Empress Rose Gin, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and a splash of grenadine garnished with baby’s breath\n\nThe Azalea is actually the signature cocktail of the Masters golf tournament. Many places will be serving their version of this drink around the nation.\n\nAnother specialty drink that will be on the menu is the John Daly, named after an American professional golfer.\n\nJohn Daly: Tito’s Vodka, house-made lemonade, iced tea garnished with fresh mint\n\nAll over the nation this week restaurants, lounges, and more will be finding ways to incorporate and bring the Masters into their establishments. Wether that is by having a watch party or creating special menus such as these.\n\nEnough about those out-of-town spots, we’ve got the Masters right here at home, let’s see how some of the local spots are getting down with their specialty drinks for this week.\n\nMost of these perfectly crafted menus have already gone into full effect around the city of Augusta.\n\nBelow are just a few places in Augusta that will be serving up specialty cocktails that you can only get during Masters week:"
