A&E places the show on indefinite hiatus because of Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson's comments in a GQ magazine article. A&E claims that it will drop Robertson from the show. This creates quite a roar amongst Duck Dynasty fans. A petition that calls for A&E to bring Robertson back to the series grabs 250,000 signatures in about a week. In a statement on Friday, December 27th A&E changes its mind. Phil Robertson will return to his role in Duck Dynasty. This is a reminder of a William Shakespeare quote: Much ado about nothing.\n\nSANTANA REUNITES WITH HOMELESS FORMER BAND MEMBER Just in time for Christmas, Rock guitarist Carlos Santana reunites with former original Santana Blues Band member who lives in a camper on the streets of East Oakland, CA.

Bill was one of the greats. He hired me from 1230 KNUZ when he became ND of 1070 KENR, tagging me to anchor afternoon drive news. He had a great sense of humor and was a fantastic guy! Some of my best memories of him include: He, myself, and the entire news crew from KENR covering the launch of the very first space shuttle (STS-1) at JSC. My little desk adjoined a reporter from Dutch World Radio. Bill and I later served on the board of Texas AP Broadcasters. That year, KENR (under his direction) won the AP's \"Best Major Market Newscast\" category. I have great memories of Bill, including some very funny stories. He will be missed. On a sidebar, I also hope all readers, as well as you and Lacy Girl had a very Merry Christmas and that everyone will have a blessed 2014. Ben Harold\n\nWHERE DO YOU READ JRRR?

I have not yet started on the airwaves but I am working on getting all of the music together for what will be my mid-day program.

Its like I have new brothers :) Much thanks! Guyanne McCall Dannheim\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER: In 1940, Paul Galvin develops first handheld two-way radio, the Handie-Talkie, for the U. S. Army. Many communications technologies that we take for granted today are born in Motorola labs following World War II. In 1947 Motorola kicks off first television on sale for under $200. In 1956 Motorola introduces the world's first pager. In 1969 Motorola stocks radio and television equipment to televise Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon. In 1973 Motorola invents world's first handheld cellular phone. Today Motorola is one of the largest cell phone manufacturers in the world. It all begins with the car radio.\n\nJOHN E. ELLIS (Austin, TX) Subject: Please subscribe me to Jim Rose Remembers Radio. Jim, I heard about you from Herb Skoog.

It is the #1 series in cable TV history. Duck Dynasty is produced near the Robertson familys home in Ouachita Parish, LA. A recent GQ interview with family patriarch Phil Robertson creates a stir in the A&E corral. When A&E suspends Phil from the show indefinitely it awakens a sleeping giant. Jay Dardenne Louisianas lieutenant governor says the Duck Dynasty reality TV show is important to state tourism and can help the Robertson family connect with new producers if they do not reach agreement with A&E. A&E has nine of next seasons 10 episodes in the can. It doesn't need Robertson in front of a camera before March 2014. Stay tuned to this Bat channel.\n\nIF YOU THINK THIS ISSUE OF JRRR IS WORTH READING...Please forward this entire issue to five of your friends and associates!

Gamblings morning show on WOR-710 on Friday, December 20, 2013 brings to a close the continuous 88-year Gambling family radio dynasty. Bill OReilly, who is one of the guests who phones into Gamblings morning show mentions that over the years radio changes to become more like 'pitched warfare'. OReilly asks John if that is good or bad. Gambling responds: I think that its, ultimately, a bad thing. In thinking about that question and having been told that one of the reasons that people have listened to me and listened to all of the Gamblings is the civility. Other guests on Gamblings final program include Donald Trump, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani. The WOR crew presents the retiring John R. Gambling a brand new golf bag.\n\nZUCKER HAS BIG PLANS FOR THE NEW CNN After CNN scores its lowest ratings in more than a year with an average of just 385,000 viewers and only 95,000 in the key 25-54 demographic, CNN's new honcho Jeff Zucker says the 24-hour news network will involve less news and more attitude. In January 2013, Zucker, who is the former President and CEO of NBC Universal, takes over at CNN with a goal to broaden the definition of news. In November 2012, Zucker tells reporters: I think our competition today is anybody that competes for eyeballs and attention and produces non-fiction programming. News is about more than politics and war. I think ESPN owns sports, I think the Weather Channel owns weather, and I want CNN to own news and information.\n\nFCC CONSIDERS NO MORE NFL TV BLACKOUTS Do you remember decades ago when the NFL decides to televise its football games? They wonder if there will be enough viewers to support it. NFL games on TV become extremely popular. Nearly 40 years ago, NFL team owners talk the FCC into blacking out home games that are not sell outs at the stadium. They forget that we tax payers help pay for their elaborate new stadiums. Plus, TV networks pay the NFL millions of dollars to carry their games. On Wednesday, December 18, 2013 the FCC takes one step toward repealing its blackout rule when its five-member commission votes unanimously to repeal the TV blackout rule. A few more steps remain. We hope for a final ruling in the first half of 2014.\n\nTRIVIA QUESTION: Is Norman Lear one of the writers for TV's 1950s variety program Your Show of Shows?

The exquisitely smooth as silk 1940s actress Joan Fontaine who scores an Oscar for her role in Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion also is well-known for her lifelong feud with her famous older sister actress, Olivia de Havilland who wins an Oscar for her role in 1939's movie classic Gone With the Wind. Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland is born on October 22, 1917 in Tokyo. Her mother is actress Lillian Ruse.

Some unlikely suitors already pursue Jay for other opportunities. Does NBC TV make another serious mistake like the one when they replace Leno with Conan the barbarian? The only person who thinks that Jimmy Fallon is funny is Jimmy Fallon himself. This is a reminder of the terrible mistakes the GOP makes with their last two candidates for President. Among those who pursue Jay is CNN President Jeff Zucker who seeks Leno for a late-night or primetime show on his network. Others include Tribune, American Idol producer Core Media Group and former NBC chief Jeff Gaspin.\n\nBIONDI'S ANNUAL TOY DRIVE IN FULL SWING Beginning on December 14, 2013 Chicago, IL's legendary radio personality, National Radio Hall of Fame member and WLS FM nighttime DJ Dick Biondi hosts his annual toy drive to collect gifts for underprivileged local area children.

In case you've wondered where I've been last couple of months...here's the scoop. About week before Thanksgiving I was admitted to Hospital completely anemic and lethargic. I was unable to walk or even get up from a chair. My heart rate was rather low (around 42). It was decided I needed a pacemaker to up my heart rate, but I said no !!!!. After a week in hospital with blood transfusions I was well enough to come home. I missed Thanksgiving with my family but came home shortly thereafter. That lasted only a few days, and I began to slip again. This time the doc's INSISTED I get a pacemaker...so I was back in the hospital for pre-op, and then the pacemaker surgery. After a week's stay after the surgery, I was sent to Hospital Re-hab for three (3) weeks, and just got home yesterday (Tuesday, Dec, 17th). It's been hell, but hope this is the fix I've needed for long while. Merry Christmas to everyone of you..my friends. Hope to hear from you when time allows.

That is if the radio stations get smart and start playing them. I attended many of Ray's shows and never once do I remember him screaming and jumping all over the stage.

In September 1951, CBS TV's Douglas Edwards and the News is the first network news to broadcast all across America from shore to shore. When CBS TV first reaches the west coast, Douglas Edwards greeting is Good evening everyone, coast to coast. In 1962, when Walter Cronkite replaces Edwards, CBS TV renames Douglas Edwards and the News to The CBS Evening News. Until he retires on April 1, 1988 Douglas remains with CBS News in various daytime television newscasts plus radio news broadcasts.\n\nCHARLES GEORGE (Dallas, TX) Subject: Jim Hall.

During the 1950s Ray's tunes are mostly twin fiddle two-step dance songs. But in 1967 with Danny Boy he ushers in new Pop style ballads with lush violins. So sorry to report that one of our all time favorite singers Ray Price has pancreatic cancer. Ray's wife of 45 years, Janie, says that her 87-year-old husband enters what she calls his final days.

I never had a day I couldn't wait to get to work. I loved every minute of it. I really miss the people I worked as much as the business itself. I worked with some great talents through the years and learned a lot from each and everyone of them. In 1988 I left my last radio job at KNUZ and became self employed in a small video production business. I'm sure I wouldn't recognize the inside of a control room any more.

Radio thinkers of our times need to find more worthwhile things to do. The name game radio gimmick of calling a radio station Bob or another guy's name is as silly as the words in our first school book reading primer. When I hear the word Bob I think of a fishing cork that bobs when a fish nibbles at the bait. In June 2010, WILV FM rebrands itself as Chicago's Rewind 100.3 with Feel good favorites from the 80's and more. Let's play follow the leader. This comes after sister-station WREW FM in Cincinnati, OH does a similar rebrand in 2009. In October 2013, WREW FM comes to its senses and drops its Rewind logo. On December 1, 2013 WILV FM wakes up and drops Rewind for just plain old Chicago's 100.3. Perhaps 2014 brings another new radio name.\n\nRADIO RAISES MONEY FOR SLAIN POLICE OFFICER On Sunday afternoon, November 3, 2013 Oregon City Reserve Officer Robert Libke (41) responds to a 911 call of an armed man outside a burning house.

Two older superstitions: consider thirteen is an unlucky number and Friday is an unlucky day. Put them together and we might experience mayhem. In 1907, author Thomas W. Lawson's popular novel Friday, the Thirteenth, a crooked and crafty entrepreneur takes advantage of the superstition when he creates a Wall Street panic on a Friday the 13th. The date Friday the 13th is also a series of twelve horror slasher movies, plus TV show, novels and comic books. The movie series features fictional character Jason Voorhees, who as a boy drowns at Camp Crystal Lake because of camp staff negligence.

Jim, In 1960, right after graduating from high school, I went to Sulphur Springs and KSST to apply for a job. Mr. Bradford gave me some copy to read and then left me alone. After reading the copy, he came back in, listened to the tape, and pointed out a few mistakes, like \"library\" is not pronounced \"lie-berry.\" I left KSST feeling rather hopeless that I would ever have a career in radio. But then, two months later, he called and offered me a job. I couldn't believe it, but I had to turn him down because by then I had paid me fees to go to Baylor. But that call from him meant more to me because it meant that I could work in radio. I could do it. A few years later, I started at KGVL in Greenville, went to Houston to KXYZ, KODA and then into television at KPRC. After a thirty year career in radio and television, I have never forgotten Bill Bradford.\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER: Douglas Edwards begins as CBS Television News anchor on May 3, 1948.

I still prefer well presented news by a person that has the voice of a journalist. Bob Schieffer sounds like a hick when compared to so many, even local people. As I said, I guess he has something that got him where he is, but he is not what I like to listen to. When it comes to news, I never cared for the way I sounded.

Fox cable TV sells out its upcoming Super Bowl with ads that reach as high as $4.5M each. In comparison, CBS TV averages just under $4M per spot for the 2013 Super Bowl. According to executives, most Fox 30-second ads go for about $4 million, but prices climb to as high as $4.5 million for the last few remaining spots. Fox wants even more revenue because it pushes other opportunities during live streaming and on cable to advertisers interested in being part of the big game. But when Daniel Defense wants to run its classy ads during the Super Bowl the NFL says No! because Daniel Defense manufactures firearms and firearm accessories. According to the NFL: Firearms, ammunition or other weapons are prohibited. Along with football games the NFL now has a political agenda, too.\n\nFEMALE JOURNALISTS PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE A recent study of 875 women from all over the world by the International News Safety Institute and the International Womens Media Foundation claim that 64% of females face intimidation, threats or abuse while at work.

Jim: Bill Bradford is the owner/GM of KSST in Sulphur Springs. He is a pioneer in small town radio and has always been pretty much high on my list of people due to the fact that he got me started in radio as a lad and hired me full time when I was ready. He is now 93 and his health has taken some hits recently. This is from his daughter, Kelly: \"As a broadcaster, my dad has never been really been a man of few words -- but a stroke 2+ weeks ago changed that. Even with the efforts of many caring medical professionals, it looks like he won't regain what the stroke took. The Lord is blessing us with some beautiful moments we will treasure forever.\" Brad was very important in the development of the EBS system to the point that the NAB honchos were meeting and asked him what he thought they should say so people wouldn't get alarmed. He advised them to say \"This is only a test\". And they did. He is on the wall of honor, whatever that is, in the TRHOF. If there is anybody that should be on center stage there it is Bill Bradford.

Martin Bashir resigns from MSNBC after he makes scathing on-air comments about Sarah Palin in November 2013. Bashir apologizes and flees for two weeks on a so-called vacation. When MSNBC takes no disciplinary action against him, criticism mounts. You may remember that MSNBC recently boots Alec Baldwin because of his alleged anti-gay slur hurled at a photographer. MSNBC sits still and allows public pressure to build to the point where the only way to control the damage was to sever its relationship with British journalist, Martin Bashir.\n\nJ.B.

Do you remember the \"Don't Drink The Water\" sign in the Men's Room? While the old Studio/Transmitter location is now in the heart of Grand Prairie, Texas; we didn't even have \"running water\" in those days. We had a well and a pump out back; but the water was only safe for flushing. And what about the coat hanger loop with the flashlight bulb attached? The RF from the transmitter out back would cause the filament to glow. You always knew that transmitter was ON; but there was not a speaker to let you know if your record had run out. I almost got fired when Bo Powell's herd of goats got loose. I had forgotten to shut the gate when I arrived for work. I remember too when Irene Runnells (of KBOX fame) took over and changed the call letters to KKDA. She called a Staff Meeting and went around the room, pointing to everyone and shouting \"YOU'RE FIRED\"!

He would write Carousel Club on the big blackboard we had in the control room and ask us to plug his club. Gordon McLendon apparently didnt mind so wed do it as a favor to Jack. That address book is in the Kennedy collection at the national Museum in Washington, DC. It is with the material that is cataloged and stored in the Museum basement that requires you to sign a register to see. Now you know most of the rest of the story.

Audrey Meadows is the only cast member who receives residual payments for the show during her entire life. Her shrewd manager who becomes her husband, Joe Hecht, predicts the possibilities of reruns. Her contract stipulates that if the show ever airs in future time slots, she will be paid royalties. This is history in the making because royalties are now standard that directors, actors, writers, and voice actors get paid for each reshowing of a TV episode.\n\nMICHELLE DEAN PLUNK [late Jim Travis' daughter] (Marble Falls, TX) Hi Jim, Thank you Jim Rose for your wonderful input on your Jim Rose Remembers radio!!! ;) I enjoy reading!

Exactly what are his badges of honor? Well, Alexander Rae Baldwin III is an American actor who appears on film, stage and TV sets. Alec's performance in the 2003 movie The Cooler grants him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination. From 2006 to 2013, as Jack Donaghy on NBC sitcom 30 Rock he wins two Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards and seven Screen Actors Guild Awards. But some might label him as smart Alec because of his hot-headed actions. After his homophobic outburst at a paparazzo outside his New York City apartment, NBC cancels Alec Baldwin's low-rated MSNBC news program Up Late. Baldwins last part in Up Late has a 41% drop from its October 11, 2013 debut.\n\nMILLER'S TIME SLOT ADVANCES With the onslaught of big changes after Westwood One merges with Cumulus Media it creates a Conservative Talk syndication shuffle.

But today we face yet another breech of our security. No one has any hint of security anymore. Our government now spies on every word that we type in our email plus our personal Web sites and places them inside a vast storage vault for possible future use against us. It takes Edward Snowden to alert Americans and the world that NSA spies on all of us. Edward is the modern day Paul Revere but he has to flee to Russia for his life. NSA's surveillance opens the doors for storage companies like Spider-Oak who has a clever way to avoid handing over customer information through government subpoenas, or otherwise.\n\nTRIVIA QUESTION: When does Edward R. Murrow's first See It Now documentary news program air on CBS TV? The answer appears below.\n\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY!

However, one of those Thanksgivings is happily stuck in my memory. It happened at KXOL 1360-AM during the top-40 days. I, sadly, can't recall the jock's name I was doing news for, but we were tagged with working the midday/afternoon shift that day. A woman listener called in to say that she was bringing us some food, since we had to work on the holiday. I guess we figured it was going to be a turkey sandwich or something. When we answered the door, she hauled in a HUGE Thanksgiving spread, including a whole turkey, with ALL the trimmings. WOW! What an outstanding memory...AND...it happened at KXOL! best regards, old friend, and please pet lacy girl for me! ben\n\nWHERE DO YOU READ JRRR?

Jim; My birthday is a couple of weeks after yours so...Happy birthday my friend youre still a young man from my perspective. I noted all the memories of the day Kennedy was shot in Dallas and my memory is about the same as most of those. My bigger memory is after the shooting of Kennedy and the way I came to be mentioned in the Warren commissions report. I was home watching TV when Jack Ruby was telecast, live on Dallas TV, shooting Lee Harvey Oswald. Jack was a frequent visitor to KLIF (1190) and most of the Jocks knew him well. I immediately recognized Jack, as the shooter. Ken Dowe dropped by the house moments later and I told Ken that I just witnessed Ruby shoot Oswald. Ken was called before the commission and told them the story. Thats how my name got into in the commission report. Chuck\n\nBREAKING NEWS! JRRR IS NOW IN THE ALL NEW RECORD WORLD MAGAZINE!

And your great articles always make my day; Thanks so much! The note from \"The Big R\" Randy Ryder of KPCN, brought back a flood of fond memories! \"Command Ranch Radio\" (as Shooting Newton\" would say) was my first job in Radio. I was working at the all new KTVT (TV) Dallas studios during week days and pulling weekends at KPCN. When KTVT started building that Studio, I would stop by every day; because I lived nearby. I soon learned what time the \"Big Wigs from Ft. Worth\" would make their daily inspection; and I was always there to beg for a job! WOW, that was 42 years ago! *** YESTERDAY USA *** 24/7 OLD TIME RADIO SHOWS LIVE SHOWS AT 10:30 PM EST. *** 31 years of 24/7 Service *** (www.yesterdayusa.com)\n\nJIM GOUGH ['Mr. Texas'-movie actor-voice actor] (Austin-Liberty Hill, TX) Subject: Jim Rose Remembers Radio (#1253) November 22, 2013 [Friday] I was working as an art director for a Dallas Agency the day JFK was killed.

Murrow televises his first See It Now documentary news program on CBS TV with a larger staff and better facilities than Douglas Edwards' news program. From 1952-1955, the 30 minutes See It Now runs sometimes in regular timeslots. But until 1958 it occasionally airs in other time slots as special programming. See It Now plays off the success of Edward R. Murrows radio show, Hear It Now, on Fridays at 9 pm from December 15, 1950-June 15, 1951.\n\nMICHELLE DEAN PLUNK [late Jim Travis' daughter] (Marble Falls, TX) Hi Jim, Thank you Jim Rose for your wonderful input on your Jim Rose Remembers radio!!! ;) I enjoy reading!

However, in the 9th grade Wyatt's grocery store offers 50c an hour as a sacker/package out boy. Each year my pay increases: 50c, 75c, 90c and by the time that I'm a senior at the brand new Kimball high school my pay leaps to $1 an hour. Wyatt's grocery store's address is in the 2000 block of South Beckley Avenue in Oak Cliff the home of KLIF-1190. In November 1963 the accused assassin of President JFK rents a room for $8 a week at 1026 North Beckley Avenue which is maybe 10 blocks away from that Wyatt's grocery store. Superior insurance company offer $220 a month as a full time bookkeeper which is located on President JFK's parade route.\n\nIF YOU THINK THIS ISSUE OF JRRR IS WORTH READING...Please forward this entire issue to five of your friends and associates!

Tippitt spots a guy walking on the sidewalk who matches the description of the accused assassin of President JFK. As the officer exits his squad car to question the mysterious man, his suspect whips out a revolver and shoots officer Tippitt to death. Police trace the shooting suspect to the Texas Theater on Jefferson Avenue. Over the years, many times we visit the Texas Theater to watch movies. Cops capture Lee Harvey Oswald inside the Texas Theater. Ironically, officer Tippitt along with his wife and two sons live in a new brick home not too far away from where I grow up. So, even though he is not a true Dallasite JFK's assassin has tremendous ties to the huge Oak Cliff section of Dallas, TX.\n\nKATIE IS A YAHOO YO-YO Katie Couric reminds us of a yo-yo that bounces back and forth on a string. The Washington Post reports on Saturday, November 22, 2013: After transitioning from the \"Today\" show to CBS News, and finally to ABC News, Couric is now planning a major switch to an online Yahoo show. According to another report: While Katie is renewable at its current ratings level, the cost of producing it - including Courics annual $20 million salary makes renewing it challenging. Broadcasting & Cable files this report on Saturday, November 22, 2013: Katie Couric is negotiating her exit from ABC News, where she serves as a special correspondent, and is headed to Yahoo.\n\nLATEST ANDY KAUFMAN STUNT IS HOAX Cult comedy star Andy Kaufman dies at 35 of lung cancer at Cedars"
