        "text": "ADOPTED! Mufasa Is At The Aiken County Animal Shelter\n\nMufasa has been adopted from the Aiken County Animal Shelter.\n\nMufasa is a big boy, and he needs your help.\n\nMufasa is just a year old. He’s also 115lbs. and he might get a little bit bigger.\n\nBig Dogs Have A Hard Time At The Aiken County Animal Shelter\n\nLarge dogs have a really hard time getting adopted, so he really needs a champion.\n\nMufasa is phenomenal with people and other dogs. It’s like he realizes how big he is and he’s just very gentle and chilled. He doesn’t even react when another dog barks at him.\n\nHe’s very affectionate and loves to be scratched behind his ears. He walks beautifully on a leash.\n\nHe is the definition of a “gentle giant”.\n\nMufasa may be part Anatolian Shepherd or Great Pyrenees. He is neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. He is heartworm negative.\n\nA meeting with existing pets is required before adoption.\n\nHis adoption fee is $35.\n\nThe Aiken County Animal Shelter is located at 333 Wire Rd., Aiken, SC.\n\nE-mail, [email protected] to meet Mufasa.\n\nWalk-Ins are welcomed from 11am-4pm Monday through Saturday.\n\nThe shelter is full, as it always is. If you can’t provide a loving home for Mufasa, he needs you to pass this along so he can find one.\n\nAgain, large dogs have a hard time being adopted. If you can take in a dog of his size, please consider."
