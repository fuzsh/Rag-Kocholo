A crash involving a commercial vehicle almost always results in severe injury or even death.\n\nThe sheer size and weight of a truck can completely demolish a passenger vehicle, causing parts to dislodge and jagged bits of metal to come apart.\n\nEven if the collision occurred at a slow speed, being hit by a semi-truck can still cause very serious injuries.\n\nSteps To Take After a Truck Accident in Harlem\n\nThere are several important steps to take after being involved in a commercial truck accident. If you want to protect your legal rights, make sure you do the following:\n\nCall the Police: Never leave the accident scene without contacting the police. Police will provide proper documentation of the details. It makes a huge difference when filing a compensation claim against the negligent party.\n\nTake Pictures: If you are physically able, try to take picture evidence of the accident scene. This may include vehicle damage, road conditions, and visible injuries sustained. Photos can be beneficial to your attorney when you go to file a truck accident claim.\n\nGet a Copy of the Police Report: Request a copy of the police report as soon as possible. Your auto insurance company and the medical provider will need this documentation for your insurance claim, and your attorney will need a copy of the report to make sure you do not pay any up-front fees for your treatment.\n\nGet Emergency Medical Care: Always seek immediate emergency medical treatment after being involved in a crash. Having your injuries examined and diagnosed quickly will make a huge difference when obtaining fair compensation from the auto insurance company.\n\nFollow Your Treatment Plan: If your doctor provides you with a specific treatment plan, it's crucial to follow it. If you miss too many appointments or end treatment early, the insurance adjuster will try to minimize your claim or deny it altogether.\n\nIntegrate a licensed chiropractor from Arrowhead Clinic into your plan of treatment. Chiropractic treatment can prevent potential long-term problems after sustaining a minor or severe injury in a truck accident. After receiving medical attention at the hospital, chiropractic is extremely beneficial for rehabilitation.\n\nHire an Experienced Truck Accident Attorney in Harlem: Hire a lawyer as soon as possible after being involved in a crash, so you are not stuck with a pile of medical bills. The sooner you hire an attorney for legal help, the sooner your lawyer will settle your case, medical bills, and insurance claim.\n\nCommon Causes of Truck Crashes\n\nMany factors contribute to a commercial vehicle accident. Harlem Truck drivers are obligated to follow specific safety regulations when operating the vehicle. If these rules are not followed, there is a higher chance of a wreck occurring.\n\nSome of the Most Common Reasons for Truck Accidents Include:\n\nFatigued Driver: Truck drivers are often required to keep a very strict schedule, which leads them to drive for extended periods with minimal sleep. If truck drivers do not take proper breaks, it's easy to become fatigued and make mistakes.\n\nDefective Equipment: Commercial drivers are obligated to inspect the tires, steering, brakes, and other vehicle components to ensure that the truck can be operated safely. Trucks are complex machines, and the operators need to pay very close attention to detail. If they fail to complete these inspections and there's a problem with the vehicle, it can lead to an accident. The trucking companies can also be at fault if they knowingly provided defective equipment.\n\nWeather Conditions: Bad weather often plays a role when it comes to truck accidents. It's already challenging for large vehicles to stop suddenly or make fast turns in clear weather, so if weather conditions are bad, a truck driver has a higher chance of losing control of the vehicle.\n\nDistracted Driving: Truck drivers often drive for long periods, providing an opportunity for the driver to become distracted by looking at their phone, changing the radio station, eating, drinking, or programming a GPS. Anytime a driver's attention is taken away from the road, a wreck is more probable.\n\nImproperly Secured Loads: The truck's load must be appropriately secured and evenly distributed to avoid crashes.\n\nEven if a commercial truck driver has an outstanding track record, there are always mishaps that can occur. It is best to be prepared by hiring legal professionals.\n\nHow a Harlem Truck Accident Attorney Can Help\n\nTruck Accident Attorneys are committed to helping victims receive maximum compensation for losses in Harlem, Georgia. When someone else's negligent actions cause you to suffer, you deserve full compensation for your losses.\n\nIt's essential to hire an attorney who will put in the time and effort that your case deserves. Always hire a lawyer who is prepared to take your case to trial if the insurance company tries to offer you a low settlement amount.\n\nWe Refer You To an Experienced Truck Accident Lawyer Who Will...\n\nProtect Your Legal Rights - Insurance companies will often try to trick you into agreeing to a low settlement. They do not want you to hire a personal injury lawyer for help. An experienced lawyer will handle all communication, so you do not need to worry about being taken advantage of. They will take the evidence and the reports you gathered at the scene to use towards your case.\n\nWork On Contingency - Hire a dedicated truck accident lawyer in Harlem who works on a contingency fee basis, which means you only pay when your case is won. You will not be charged any up-front fees for legal services.\n\nMaximize Your Compensation For Damages - The insurance company will try to minimize or deny your compensation claim because their goal is to pay out the smallest amount allowed. Hire a personal injury lawyer to help get maximum benefits for your losses. With the help of an experienced truck accident lawyer, you will receive the settlement amount that you deserve.\n\nTruck Accident Damage Compensation\n\nNo two accidents are the same, which means the circumstances of your accident will be a determining factor in the amount of compensation you are eligible for.\n\nTruck accident attorneys help victims obtain compensation for both economic and non-economic types of damages.\n\nEconomic Damages\n\nEconomic losses are any monetary losses sustained during the accident. These types of losses are often simpler for an attorney to prove because the evidence and documentation are easy to obtain.\n\nTypes of Economic Losses\n\nPast and Future Medical Expenses: Proven with medical records, diagnoses, treatment plans, and bills\n\nLost Wages and Future Lost Wages: Proven with pay stubs, doctors' notes stating time missed from work, and a letter from your employer\n\nProperty Damage: Proven with receipts and invoices\n\nOut-of-Pocket Expenses: Proven with receipts from any expenses that occurred as a direct result of the accident\n\nNon-Economic Damages\n\nNon-economic losses, on the other hand, can be a little trickier to prove. These damages include non-monetary damages. These losses are often more difficult to prove as they require more evidence to reflect the numbers.\n\nTypes of Non-Economic Losses\n\nAn important part of determining negligence is finding the at-fault driver, but you must first examine the cause of the accident. Common causes of trucking accidents in Georgia include:\n\nImproperly maintained vehicles\n\nA tired or fatigued driver\n\nIntoxication or addiction to prescription medications\n\nViolate safety laws such as speeding, cutting off drivers, and making incorrect turns\n\nUnrealistic schedules\n\nImproperly loaded or overloaded trucks\n\nUnqualified truck drivers or lack of driver training\n\nDangerous weather conditions\n\nAccording to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the most commonly cited cause of truck accidents is due to truck driver error. Drivers of large trucks are ten times more likely to be the cause of trucking accidents than other factors, such as weather, road conditions, and vehicle performance. The FMCSA study also examined factors that cause truck drivers to make errors, such as the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, speeding, fatigue, inattention, distractions, work environment, and unfamiliarity of the road.\n\nThe trucking company can also be at fault for negligence if they failed to inspect and maintain the vehicle properly. There are rules and regulations the trucking company must follow with the FMCSA rules. Truckers are not always 100% at fault.\n\nWhat Are Truck Blind Spots?\n\nIt is important always to be aware when driving next to large commercial trucks. Many motor vehicle accidents involving passenger cars and commercial vehicles are because of blind spots, also known as \"no-zones.\"\n\nWhen driving behind a large truck, it is crucial to distance your car at least 30 feet. Blind spots on the driver and passenger sides of the truck can extend as far as the width of two lanes of traffic. In fact, the term \"blind spot\" is very misleading since these \"spots\" are extremely large areas where an entire car, or multiple cars, are not visible to the trucker.\n\nIf you are involved in a lawsuit because you were hit while in a truck's blind spot, there is still a possibility that you could be deemed negligent. When in doubt, if you cannot see the truck's side mirrors, they most likely cannot see you.\n\nWhat Are Common Injuries for Victims of Truck Accidents?\n\nSevere or catastrophic injuries can occur if involved in a crash with a semi-truck. Common injuries include:\n\nNeck Injuries\n\nBack Injuries\n\nSpinal Cord Injuries\n\nInternal Injuries\n\nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n\nWhiplash\n\nBroken Bones\n\nParalysis\n\nLoss of Limbs\n\nThese types of severe injuries can cause long-term physical and psychological trauma to the injured person.\n\nHow Much Does a Truck Accident Attorney Cost in Harlem?\n\nIf you were involved in a commercial vehicle accident in Harlem, Georgia, caused by someone else's negligence, the type of attorney you should hire to represent you is called a Personal Injury Attorney. This type of attorney specializes in helping the non-fault injured party get financial compensation.\n\nThankfully, these experienced attorneys work on what is called a Contingency Fee Basis. Working on contingency means there is no upfront cost, and the attorney only collects their fee in the form of a small percentage after the final settlement.\n\nDo Truck Drivers Have to Follow Different Laws When Driving?\n\nYes.\n\nThe trucking company and its' drivers have stricter guidelines that they must follow when operating large vehicles. These guidelines are written out in both federal and state-level mandates. If a driver or company is in violation of any of these guidelines, they can be fined or lose their license.\n\nDifferent concepts covered in these guidelines include:\n\nHours of service\n\nSecuring loads\n\nWeight limit\n\nTruck maintenance records\n\nDrug testing\n\nDriver physical exams\n\nIf it is determined that a company or driver violated any of these laws, it can mean a larger payout when it comes to your accident injury settlement.\n\nWhat if My Big-Rig Accident Was Months Ago?\n\nAlthough the sooner you act, the better, if you have made the mistake of waiting too long to hire a law firm after an accident, not all is lost.\n\nStates have a statute of limitations that provides a timeframe for which a legal claim must be filed after an accident. In Georgia, the statute of limitations is two years from the date of the accident. Even though you are given a large window to file a claim, cases are always stronger and have larger awarded settlements the sooner they are filed.\n\nIf you have any questions about your commercial truck accident, contact us today to connect you with a licensed truck accident law firm in Harlem, Georgia. We have connections with the best lawyers around to get you the highest compensation possible.\n\nWould My Attorney Handle My Insurance Claim For Me?\n\nYes.\n\nYour Harlem personal injury lawyer will manage all contact with the insurance companies. Since the insurance adjuster is always looking for ways to save the company money, it is safer to have your truck wreck lawyer do the negotiating for you. Experienced attorneys know everything to take into account when dealing with a personal injury claim. If an insurance company contacts you after your accident, do not say anything to them until you have spoken with a truck accident attorney.\n\nTypically, insurance agents will drag their feet, hoping that you're desperate enough to accept their lower settlement offer. Your lawyer will take the time to go through your insurance policy and the at-fault driver's insurance policy with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nLet Our Harlem Chiropractors Find You an Experienced Personal Injury Law Firm\n\nWhen you're involved in a commercial truck accident lawsuit where you were not at fault, you deserve total financial compensation for any sustained losses.\n\nFinding the right lawyer can be difficult, which is why at Arrowhead Clinic, we refer you to the best truck accident lawyers in Harlem, Georgia.
