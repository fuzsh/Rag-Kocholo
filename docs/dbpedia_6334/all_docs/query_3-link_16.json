        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by kayrob\n\nI don't know when you were in New York but I moved out of that market area two years ago. Outside of the few hip hop stations they have 107.5 WBLS and 98.7 Kiss FM with the latter being the station I gravitated to. And both of their formats were classic or old school R&B mixed with some of today's R&B. And I know for a fact that they played a variety. WBLS played a bit of hip-hop and Kiss played none really.\n\nI should have clarified. By \"urban\" I was referring to the hip hop and R &B stations 105.1 and Hot 97.\n\nI listed to 107.5 regularly and am very familiar with it. 107.5 is actually an example of my overall point. Which is that larger markets have more corporate control and less local flavor, and comparing Atlanta to these \"large\" markets, Atlanta is not as bad as some may believe. NY's 107.5 had corporate-owned nationally syndicated programs for virtually all of its shows (Steve Harvey in the morning, Wendy Williams in the afternoon drive, and Brian McKnight late night) so their music and programming were all things I could hear in other major cities. There was much less local flavor on 107.5.\n\nEven though Atlanta is a much smaller market, they have just as many if not more \"black\" stations than New York City. Compared to NYC's four stations for black music, Atlanta has 5 focused on hip-hop, old-school music, and R&B (technically 4 since one station is on two frequencies) V-103, Hot 107.9, 107.5/97.5, and 104.1. The 102.5 frequency keeps changing so I'm not sure if it's still a R&B format, but that was another station we had for awhile. You could also count 95.5 the Beat, even though they started off as Top 40.\n\nAll in all, Atlanta is doing pretty well compared to the metros I mentioned, and I personally have found it to offer more diversity and more prone to feature local talent and programming."
