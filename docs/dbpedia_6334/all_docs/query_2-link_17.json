        "text": "Austin’s Daily Commentary – October 9, 2023\n\nAustin talks about the Richmond County Sheriff’s race.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin: Two new names have emerged as potential challengers for Richard Roundtree in the upcoming election for Richmond County sheriff. Bo Johnson joins “Gino Rock” Brantly as deputy marshal, who’s going to be challenging the incumbent sheriff.\n\nBut there’s another name even more intriguing that actually brings three announced challengers into the mix, and that’s Richard Dixon, who is for many years was the head instructor for post training certification for law enforcement officers. That’s a police officer, standards and training office. If you can get all that straight.\n\nHe has been probably responsible, personally responsible for the training of more law enforcement officers in the area than any other individual that I know. He also has in the past been a friend and a somewhat of an ally to Richard Roundtree.\n\nI can’t tell you this really surprises me. There have been so many recent revelations about terrible conditions with the sheriff’s department and now we know the jail as well, that it seems like the vultures are circling the carcass, so to speak, of Roundtree. But do not underestimate the support of Roundtree, particularly in the minority community. And this is going to be a very, very interesting race, to say the least.\n\nBy the way, Bo Johnson is the grandson of Jesse Carroll, former Richmond County commissioner, very popular man in South Augusta, and Hephzibah. Gino Rock Brantly, the deputy marshal that announced previously, is an African-American who will be challenging Roundtree as a Democrat.\n\nDixon is apparently going to be running as an independent, which means he’s going to have to get signatures to put himself on the ballot as an independent. He is a White West Augusta, well, I say West Augusta. I guess he’s a white officer with connections in West Augusta and South Augusta as well.\n\nSo it’s going to be a very, very interesting race. It looks like Roundtree is going to have opposition in the Democratic primary and then finally in the general election. At the very least, if he makes it that far from the independent Dixon.\n\nStay tuned. Lots of blood in the water as far as the leadership of the sheriff’s department goes. Let’s see what happens. It’s going to be interesting. And that’s the comment I’m Austin Rhodes, AM 580/95.1 FM, News Talk WGAC.\n\nFor more from The Austin Rhodes Show, click here.\n\n“Cody” Blaine Jackson is one half of the Kicks Wake Up Krew on Kicks 99, and also serves as the Digital Program Director for Beasley Media Group in Augusta.
