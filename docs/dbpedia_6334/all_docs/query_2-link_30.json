This level of sales, if realized, would be the highest ever, eclipsing the old record of $59.8 billion set in fiscal year 1996.\n\n\"Exports to China continue to be a reaLbright spot for U.S. agriculture,\" said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ann M. Veneman. \"U.S. agricultural exports to China will have more than tripled since their accession to the World Trade Organization, rising from $1.8 billion in 2001, to $3.5 billion in 2003, and they are forecast wreach a record $5.9 billion in fiscal year 2004. China was our fIfth largest agricultural customer last year, and our number-one market for soybeans, cotton and hides/skins.\"\n\nWheat and com exports are likely to account for 50 percent of the annual increase in agricultural exports. U.S.\n\nwheat is in high demand and ii benefiting\n\nfrom reduced competition due to poor harvests in the European Union, Russia and Ukraine.. Com is experiencing strong sales growth to Egypt, Colombia, Israel arid Korea.\n\nOther commodities benefiting from large sales increases this year include cotton and horticultural products. Cotton sales are forecast to rise $1.5 billion over / last year to $4.2 billion. Cotton farmers are benefiting from strong prices and high global demand. Horticultural sales are. forecast to set a record of $13.5 billion, with tree nuts and a broad array of processed foods accounting for twothirds of the overall gain. Horticultural exports to Canad';l and Mexico remain .strong, sales to Europe of selected products are brisk, and exports to several Asian countries are rising sharply.\n\nThe 2004 forecast of livestock and livestock products of $7 billion is $1 billion higher than the February level. This increase is due to high beef, pork and poultry prices and also the Department's efforts to reopen some key beef and poultry markets that were closed following findings of Bovine Spongiform\n\nEncephalopathy and Avian Influenza. Livestock exports in fiscal year 2003 totaled $9 billion.\n\nImports, forecast at $51.5 billion for 2004, are $5.8 billion higher than last year resulting in an agricultural trade surplus of $10 billion.\n\nAs they have for the past three decades, horticultural imports continue to rise, accounting for about half of the overall import gain. Off-season demand for fresh products and competitive prices are driving the long-term\" growth in imported fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research. Service, the Foreign Agricultural Service and the World Agricultural Outlook Board release agriculturaI trade .forecasts quarterly. The summary and full report of USDA's Outlook for U.S. Agricultural Exports may be accessed from the ERS Web site at http://www.ers.usda:gov or the FAS Web site at http://www.fas.usda.gov.

Once harvested, store potat()es in a cool, dark location and store onions in a dry, airy place.\n\nRegularly harvesting vegetables, such as beans, cucumbers, peas, okra and squash, 'will allow you to prolong production and enjoy the vegetables at the peak of theirfreshness. , You can improve your peach crop by thinning the trees about 70 days after full bloom; waiting longer \\\\Till result in poorer fruit quality. Failure to thin the fruit could cause some of thetree limbs to break under the weight of the fruit.. After .the trees have finished dropping fruit' naturally, thin them and leave the biggest and best-shaped peaches about four to six inches apart.\n\nIfyou applied fertilizer to your garden in early spring, most of it likely has leached from the soil by now. Give your annual and perennial flowers a feeding of about one-half cup of fertilizer (5-10-10 or similar analysis) per square yard of bed. If you have vegetables, side-dress them with approximately one-fourth cup fertilizer per. three .feet of row. If the vegetables are growing in wide beds, broadcaSt the fertilizer over the bed at the rate of one-haIf cup per square yard. Be sure to wash the fertilizer particles off the foliage to prevent burning.\n\nTall flowers, such as dahlias, lilies, garden phlox and h()llyhocks, will need staking before they are' completely grown. Try using small twigs pruned from shrubs as your stakes. As the plants grow, they will lean against the twigs and eventually hide them.\n\nSooty mold is a fungus that affects crepe myrtles, as well as azaleas and gardenias. It appears as a black coating on the foliage. Sooty mold grows on the sugary substance (called honeydew) that is secreted by aphids and whiteflies. This fungus is unattractive and blocks sunlight to the leaves. The way to control sooty mold islo control aphids and whiteflies by spraying with an insecticide that is recommended for controlling these pests.\n\nDallas Market\n\nSeeks Growers\n\nThe. Dallas Farmers' Market, located in historical' downtown Dallas (Paulding County) is seeking local growers of . produce, farm fresh products and vendors of homemade food items. The Market needs vendors of fresh. produce, eggs, honey, nuts, cut flowers, herbs, etc. Vendors need to be aware of local and state sales and use regulations and licensing laws.\n\nOpening day is scheduled for midJune and will run through September.
