        "text": "A Harlem man faces multiple charges after leaving the scene of a serious accident in Columbia County earlier this week.\n\nThe sheriff’s office says 22 year old Hunter Harpstrite and 19 year old Faden Carter Christ, also of Harlem, were racing their motorcycles Sunday afternoon on Freeman Harriss Road …off Wrightsboro Road. Harpstrite lost control while rounding a curve and landed in a ditch. Christ also lost control and hit a culvert. He was ejected from the bike and landed near some trees.\n\nAuthorities say Harpstrite hid his motorcycle down a private road before calling for help. He’s been charged with serious injury by vehicle, hit and run, racing on highways or streets, and reckless driving.\n\nStory courtesy of Mary Liz Nolan with WGAC.\n\n“Cody” Blaine Jackson is one half of the Kicks Wake Up Krew on Kicks 99, and also serves as the Digital Program Director for Beasley Media Group in Augusta. She’s a Georgia native but currently resides just across the river in South Carolina. She started in the radio industry as a part-time board operator, and moved up through various roles, including on-air positions and program director for multiple stations. Her passions include fitness and anything to do with animals, as she has two fur babies, her dogs Harley and Waylon. Cody likes to write about pets, fitness and Augusta local events."
