        "text": "Letter of Apology From Harlem Teacher\n\nIt is a story that has resonated with parents and educators, students and administrators, and most definitely fans and former students of the teacher in question. I can attest that our social media pages have exploded IN SUPPORT of Harlem High School teacher Jennifer Skrobisz.\n\nThe veteran biology teacher said she was wrong in the way she handled her frustration, but that she accepts the administrative actions of her BOE supervisors. What follows is her sincere letter of apology, and her plan to take a little time to recover from all the fallout of her well meaning, but controversial outburst.\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\nDear Parents and Students,\n\nFirst and foremost I want to apologize for my unprofessional conduct in the classroom on February 22nd. It was completely unacceptable behavior and as an adult, it is my responsibility to create a safe learning environment for your student. I have adequate support from faculty and staff at Harlem and did not take advantage of my resources to properly address behavior issues and I allowed my temper to get in the way of learning.\n\nAs with any situation like this, I have received a consequence from the county and I agree with their decision. It is my hope that you will accept my apology for my behavior and trust that going forward, it will not happen again and that I will utilize the necessary tools to maintain a safe learning environment for everyone.\n\nHowever, there are many pressing personal concerns in my life including the untimely death of my fiance in December, that, compounded with this recent event, have made it clear to my physician and me that I need some time to address my health. At this time, it is my hope to return to the classroom in April after a prescribed medical leave of absence.\n\nPlease know that I have made the choice to step away for a brief time to heal from my loss, to be present for my own children, and to be a healthier person so I can be at my best in the classroom.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMs Jennifer Skrobisz\n\nSign me up for the WGAC email newsletter!\n\nBecome a member of the WGAC VIP club to stay up-to-date on upcoming events, contests, and more.\n\nFirst Name *\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail *\n\nBy clicking \"Subscribe\" I agree to the website's terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
