        "text": "Cupkin Double-Walled Stainless Steel Children’s Cups sold on Amazon are being recalled due to lead levels that exceed the federal content ban.\n\nSoojimus is recalling 8-ounce and 12-ounce models of the cups sold in various colors from 2018 through earlier this year. The Cupkin cups were purchased on the company’s website as well as on Amazon.\n\nA statement from the company said, “When we initially developed these cups, our manufacturing partner confirmed multiple times that absolutely no lead was used in any part of our production process. Learning that our manufacturing partner and not one, but two CPSC-accredited labs let us down is a heavy set back both financially and emotionally.”\n\nAccording to a statement from Cupkin officials, liquid in the recalled cups is not exposed to lead due to the double-walled construction. The exposure to lead can occur, however, if the bottom of the cup is damaged.\n\nCupkin and Amazon officials say all known purchasers of the cups being recalled will be contacted and a refund will be issued.\n\nTo receive a refund, customers can send photographs of the cups that were purchased showing their destruction and fill out a form on Cupkin’s website, www.cupkin.com.\n\nMary Liz is the News Director and Co-Host of Augusta’s Morning News on WGAC.
