        "text": "Pollution and environmental neglect have become fundamental problems and threats in today's society and sustainable development is very important in all aspects of life. Nature has left a lot of useful resources in heritage to previous and current generations, but people exploit these resources, because of their greed and desire for the highest possible profit ignoring and not thinking of the future generations. But as it always happens in life, the reckless desire to maximize profits has backfired, and it was and numerous social and economic problems have occured. More than ever before there are climate changes, and there has never been so much disparity between rich and poor. Throughout history there were always three classes: lower, middle and higher and today the middle class is getting smaller and smaller because the unequal distribution of natural resources has led to the situation where today we distinguish only between rich and poor, and the difference between them is enormous.\n\nSustainopreneurship is an emerging issue as society is looking for solutions leading to sustainable development. For sustainable development, environmental issues related to degradation and depletion, public health care issues related to availability and distribution of medicine for public welfare along with economic issues related to unemployment and dearness offer opportunity for entrepreneurs. Sustainopreneurship can help to resolve these issues. The present study is focused on various aspects of sustainable development. The paper explores how sustainopreneurship can lead to a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable society.\n\nDespite economic growth across the world, there is a rise in societal, economic, and environmental threats. The adverse penalties of environmental depletion include reduction of natural resources, lack of clean water, draught, and loss of biodiversity , (Greco, & de Jong, 2017). There is income divide is increasing, there is unequal access to openings and resources, gender inequalities are persisting, more people living in poverty and are dying of hunger (Ploum, et al., 2018). These issues clearly bring out the need for sustainable entrepreneurship. This study has illustrated a conceptual model which can be adopted by enterprises so that they not merely contribute in economic growth but also participate in the preservation of the ecology and growth and development of the society. The finding of the current paper shall give new insights to the existing entrepreneurs, potential entrepreneurs, policy makers, academicians and researchers to promote the cause of sustainability in all dimensions of business and research.\n\nThis article explains how entrepreneurship can help resolve the environmental problems of global socioeconomic systems. Environmental economics concludes that environmental degradation results from the failure of markets, whereas the entrepreneurship literature argues that opportunities are inherent in market failure. A synthesis of these literatures suggests that environmentally relevant market failures represent opportunities for achieving profitability while simultaneously reducing environmentally degrading economic behaviors. It also implies conceptualizations of sustainable and environmental entrepreneurship which detail how entrepreneurs seize the opportunities that are inherent in environmentally relevant market failures. Finally, the article examines the ability of the proposed theoretical framework to transcend its environmental context and provide insight into expanding the domain of the study of entrepreneurship.\n\nIn the last decades, sustainable development has become an important topic of discussion for scholars and practitioners concerned with environmental issues. Since the publication of the Brundtland Report, which represents a milestone in triggering awareness for sustainability issues, sustainable development has steadily gained popularity to become one of the most important environmental discourses today. Together with innovation, the United Nations identified entrepreneurship as a key element for addressing sustainable development challenges. Due to its growing recognition as a driver of sustainable development, entrepreneurship is subject to research across many scientific disciplines. To systemize the current state of knowledge, the purpose of this paper is to systematically review recent literature and to outline how sustainable development influences entrepreneurial activities and vice versa. In addition, it investigates whether and under what circumstances entrepreneurship can ..."
