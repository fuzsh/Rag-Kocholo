        "text": "Augusta National Needs To Address Stolen Merchandise – Austin’s Daily Commentary\n\nAustin talks about the Augusta National addressing the stolen merchandise.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin: It doesn’t happen very often, but I think our friends at Augusta National need a little bit of advice on how to deal with the unwanted attention that has come their way because of the, well, the fact that they have been the victim of a very serious multimillion-dollar crime.\n\nYou’ve been hearing the aftermath discussed this morning. John and Mary Liz have done a good job of it. You should see the court documents involved, which we’ll be going over today on the Austin Rhodes Show. But, folks, the bottom line is the folks at the National can probably do themselves a great deal of good PR work if they just get out in front of this thing. They need to have someone from the club come forward and answer all the questions that many folks in the press have about how this happened, how it was discovered, why it was prosecuted out of Chicago.\n\nThere are a ton of unanswered questions here in the Augusta National as usual policy of we discuss only club business one day out of the year. And that is that is ridiculous. This is a special situation, just like the ice storm that hit a few years ago. There have been other things that have come up through the years that required the Augusta National getting out in front of this story, and this is one of them.\n\nFolks, this is like the Smithsonian Institution being robbed, at least the Augusta version of the Smithsonian. We need answers. The public’s not going to stop until the answers are forthcoming. And, you know, nature abhors a vacuum. If the Augusta National does not come forward and supply the answers to these questions, the rumor mill is going to take over.\n\nJust get it out of the way. It was a terrible crime. It needed to be punished. It looks like it has been punished. And let’s discuss how this happened and how we’re making sure it never happens again. Pretty simple right? Just get out in front of it and do it now. Now rather than later. And if you don’t tell the story, others will tell it for you every time. And that’s the comment, I’m Austin Rhodes, 95.1 FM News Talk WGAC."
