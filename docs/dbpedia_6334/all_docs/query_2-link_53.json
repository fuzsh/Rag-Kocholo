Because of my age the manager had to contact the wage and hour board to verify I could work 60 hours a week for minimum wage. I remember that as if it were yesterday as I had to pay for room and board etc. I was all alone with no car in Big Spring and on a strict budget of which $8 a week went for a shared room and one meal. Fortunately I could walk to and from the studios. My take home pay left no room to wiggle and I had to have those 60 hours each week to make it. Some weeks I got fewer than 60 hours. It was tough, but a good lesson learned on survival. Chuck\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER: Jimmy Dee is born in May 1944. By 1956, he is a San Antonio, TX club attraction.

One of my all time favorites is his It's Just A Matter Of Time in 1959. In 1970, Benton records Rainy Night in Georgia written by Tony Joe White in 1962. Tony Joe says when he gets out of high school he becomes a truck driver for the highway department in Marietta, GA. When it rains you do not have to go to work. You can stay home and play your guitar. So when he moves to Texas about three months later, those thoughts cause him to write Rainy Night in Georgia. One of the finest versions of Rainy Night in Georgia is a You Tube duet between Conway Twitty and Sam Moore. It will make your toes tingle.\n\nCHET MAXWELL [ex GM at KBOX-1480, KILT-610, KENS-680] (San Antonio, TX) Hi Jim, Do you have any suggestions for finding these two beautiful, 6 mos. old Akita pups a good home.

As your readers well know, he not only directed KILT during its last fifteen years as a rock station, he practically invented the concert promotion industry. The only time I actually talked to him was on the telephone in 1966. I was mere high school student promoting a mock radio show that I played over a phone line. Forty years later, I got to know him much better when he contributed numerous remarks and recordings to my radio aircheck pages. If I had not been encouraged by Bill and a few other prominent broadcasters, I probably would have just put up a few recordings and let it go at that. Most of my Bill Young airchecks and commentary are on my 60's, 70's and 80's pages: http://vasthead.com/Radio/80s.html / http://vasthead.com/Radio/70s.html / http://vasthead.com/Radio/60s.html\n\nNEWS BREAKS!

L. Callihan, Chilton Book Company. I suppose it is an artifact considering most of the information can be found on the Internet. Currently The Dallas Art Museum has an exhibit of Marc Chagall. I hope your readers in DFW area take the time to go see it. I also enjoy the Thursday Night Concerts in the Atrium at the Museum.

Strait dazzles an audience of nearly 105,000 screaming fans with duet after duet with some of the biggest names in Country music. On Saturday night, June 7, 2014 Country music legend George Strait strolls across the floor of the Dallas Cowboys' lavish stadium onto the custom-built stage in a blue plaid shirt, Wrangler jeans, a silver belt buckle and a black cowboy hat to face the largest crowd for an indoor concert in North American history (which exceeds the stadium's official capacity by 5,000).\n\nBORDER CITY TV ANCHOR BIDS FAREWELL TO EL PASO On September 1, 1956 KVIA TV first signs on the air as KILT TV on VHF CH 13 owned by television and radio personality Gordon McLendon.

One of my fondest memories is the 15 mins. I spent alone with Louis Armstrong during intermission in a Jazz Concert that I promoted in High School to pay to move the Senior Prom from the smelly, old school gym to the Hotel Jamestown Ballroom. I believe that was the one and only Prom to take place in that venue due to other activities that took place in the hotel's bars and guest rooms later that night. The hotel also contained the studios of WJTN radio, the first place I ever spoke into a live microphone. My mentor there, Jim Roselle, is in his 40th year on the station. Today the hotel is a retirement home somehow that seems appropriate.\n\nNEWS BREAKS! Now get JRRR in RadioDX. Click Radio Blog News at http://radionx.com/radio-blog-news/.

A good antenna will work better than more power. Also I find the newbies are often better at operating than those who have been around with higher classes of licenses. The newcomers still have it fresh in their minds about what makes for good operating practice. I hear so many talking about Rights but they don't mention responsibility or accountability unless when talking about others. Like a person running for a Public Office should not be operating a station, they should put the operation in a trust, until after the election they are part of. Also I don't think money should come from outside of the area that the candidate is running in. 73, Charles George, KC5RAI\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER: In 1960, Ben E. King and The Drifters have a wonderful tune, Save The Last Dance For Me, that reaches #1. The lyrics describe a man who tells his date that she is free to mingle during the evening, but to make sure to save the last dance of the night for him. Legendary songwriter Doc Pomus pens the tune on the day of his wedding. You see, Doc Pomus has polio and needs crutches to get around, but his wife is a Broadway actress and dancer. The wheelchair-bound groom, Doc Pomus, watches his bride who dances with their guests but she must not forget that she goes home with him. Save The Last Dance For Me lands on Billboard on September 9, 1960 and remains #1 for three weeks. Elvis Presley has several hit records with Doc Pomus tunes: (Marie's The Name) His Latest Flame, Girl Happy, Little Sister, A Mess Of Blues, She's Not You, Suspicion, Surrender and Viva Las Vegas.\n\nCC MCCARTNEY [ex KRBE FM-voice talent] (Nashville-Hendersonville, TN) Subject: Jim Rose Remembers Radio June 09, 2014 [Monday] Issue #1310 You have my vote for the TRHOF this year, you deserve it old friend!~ CC (www.ccmccartney.com)\n\nHARRY S.

In 1938 it took only ONE performance of a song, on just ONE radio show, to make that song an instant nationwide hit that would go on to be a popular standard even to this day. Just ONE \"spin\" by the right person on the right show, that's all it took.

Moving the AM band to below the current FM band will not make AM Radio better. What will make AM Radio better is to offer quality programming not available on FM, the internet, or other sources. Also there are many services that use those frequencies beneath the FM band. As an amateur radio operator there are times when it makes good sense to go along with others, even if you are in the right, I live in an apartment complex so I usually only run 5 watts using a J-pole on my balcony. There are not that many who understand what amateur radio is or its uses, so why stir up trouble when not needed? 73, Charles George, KC5RAI\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER: Hoyt Axton writes Three Dog Night's Joy To The World (#1-1971) and Never Been To Spain (#5-1972), Ringo Starr's The No No Song (#3-1975) and The Kingston Trio's Greenback Dollar (#21-1963). In late 1955, Hoyt's mom 41-year-old high school English teacher, Mae Boren Axton, takes a part-time position as a public relations secretary for Elvis Presleys manger, Colonel Tom Parker.

KCAA-1050 San Bernardino, CA owner Fred Lundgren mentions in the Huffington Post that AM radio faces a dismal future and pleads for the FCC to get involved. ...the FCC does nothing with dozens of FM frequencies below 87.5 FM that should provide AM stations with a new home.

All of us in the radio, Video and production business owe this man a massive debt of gratitude for the inspiration he gave all of us who knew him. I feel very lucky to have worked with him at the Big 610 for five years. He was a consummate professional, convinced me I should do voice work and helped me get some of my early gigs with advertisers.

Of the Top 40 programmers, Bill Young was one of the most dedicated and honest in the business.

Bill was always kind and fair to me, and a great gentleman.\n\nCHUCK MCCANN (Austin, TX) There's not a person in radio that does not have a Bill Young story of their own. A true radio great. Sad day for us all.\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER: After he exits The Guess Who, Randy Bachman forms Brave Belt. After vocalist Chad Allen leaves, under record company pressure Randy changes the group's name to Bachman/Turner. Promoters book them as if they are a Soft Rock duo like Seals And Crofts or Brewer And Shipley and they find themselves playing all the wrong age groups. Crossing the Windsor/Detroit border, Bachman sees trucker's magazine Overdrive and their new Bachman-Turner Overdrive moniker is born. In February 1974, Top 40 KFJZ-1270's PD enters the control room and hands me an advanced acetate recording of new group Bachman-Turner Overdrive's new single Let It Ride. So, I'm the first DJ to play BTO's new single on the air in Ft. Worth, TX.\n\nBILL INGRAM [KILT-610] (Houston-Cleveland, TX) Jim I was at KILT in 91 and 92, and we had two Denon CD Decks in each control room. KILT FM was playing mostly CD Tracks, but a good portion of the playlist was still on full track stereo cart... KILT AM was playing mostly cart, with a few selected cuts on CD. During some of that time (for two weeks) on KILT AM, we went to K-MERLE- All Merle Haggard- All the time. That was fun!\n\nKILT FM From 1991-96, during my second time on KILT FM, both KILT control rooms have two Denon CD players each. On KILT FM all of our new music is on CD. On the other side of the building at 500 Lovett, KILT-610 control room has maybe 100 Oldies CDs while the outside wall in the hall contains hundreds of Oldies on music carts. Of course in September 1994, KILT-610 flips to all sports with feeds from outer space.

Randolph Street resident Kathleen Wolf is unhappy that a neighbor erects a 55-foot tall antenna in his backyard. Ham radio enthusiast Jeff Hullquist installs the antenna about six weeks ago. Wolf, whose historic home is in her family for four generations complains: Thats the last thing I want to look at. Jeff says: I know Im in good shape to keep it because the FCC protects amateur radio operators.\n\nTRIVIA QUESTION: Before they become The Oak Ridge Boys what is their original name?

Remembering the 'charged,' frenetic, competitive atmosphere there that made it the scariest, most fun and best place in Radio to be at that time. Unfortunately, I hated the job of scheduling every minute of every day on the daily Programming Logs. (When I left, they hired two people to do the work I'd been asked to do alone!) What made it fun and worthwhile were the great people I got to work with, like Joe Long; Roy Nichols; Gary DeLaune; and Jocks like: Jimmy Rabbitt; Jack Woods; Ken (\"Granny\") Dowe; Ron Chapman, et. al. And, the fact that McLendon liked my Voice on KLIF Station Ids & Liners. Also got to work doing VOs for Sponsors, which was crazy-fun for me!\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT TODAY'S RADIO?

If a fire does happen, firefighters better make sure that it is completely extinguished before they head back to the fire station. Tony Geftos, reporter for WTVG TV ABC CH 13 in Toledo, OH reports on the scene about a man who leaps out of his window to escape a fire that he says is set by an intruder who also assaults him. Firefighters put out that fire and then leave the scene. A few hours later, during WTVG TV's morning show, while Geftos talks about the initial fire, the flames return. During his report, Geftos drops his mic and bangs on doors and yells fire. Firefighters see Geftos report on the fire on TV and return to put the flames out one more time.\n\nTHIEF SWIPES WILLIE'S ARMADILLO While audience members meet and greet Country music legend Willie Nelson after his March 31, 2014 concert at the Westin Lake Las Vegas resort his stuffed armadillo that serves as an on-stage mascot disappears.

I was still in school when we married and after the ceremony all we could afford (being short of moola) to eat afterwards was a hamburger, fries and root beer from the Pig Stand on Forest Ave. We vowed to have that same meal each anniversary, which we have done. On our renewed vows at 50 we had the local Dairy Queen fix up the party room like a church and afterwards our son bought all in attendance our traditional meal.

He deserved it and so do you. It's apparently gone downhill since his induction about 10 years ago. Thanks for all you do to keep us seasoned broadcasters in the loop! My Best, Jim\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER: We often hear DJs on the radio refer to Rock group The Bee Gees as The Brothers Gibb. But members of The Bee Gees say that is not the origin of their name. They take their name The Bee Gees from two friends that help them out in their early days by the names of Bill Goode plus disc jockey Bill Gates. Hence The Bee Gees.\n\nDAN MCCURDY (Sherman, TX) Subject: KLIF - Charlie & Harrigan. Jim...sure wish you had come down to Triangle Point in Dallas while I was there at KLIF...I'd have been GLAD to give you the cook's tour! Ron Chapman and I (The Charlie and Harrigan Show) scored a 54-share (AQH) in the fall of '64, an astounding t54% of the radios in use during morning drive in D/FW were listening to KLIF when that audience rating came out! At that time, Dallas and Ft. Worth had, I'm guessing, about 45 radio stations. All AM, no known local FM broadcasting outlets then. Nowadays, with approx. 75 or more AM and FM stations, the #1 station in the MetroMess Survey Area does quite well indeed to score a 2% share...3% is 'Second Coming' time...mercy! they even throw office parties when a station pulls down a fat 1% AQH share! The ole 'radio pie' today has some super-skinny slices! Like Twiggy-thin! How times and radio have changed! No more 'local feel' or 'air personality' angles for terrestrial radio.

The driver is the father of a man who cops accuse of killing 20-year-old Demarkus Harrison and wounding another person. Witnesses blame the shooting on escalating tension in the neighborhood. Passenger Deshonna Smith, who is the driver's fiancée says: They came out here picking on him. This was self defense. Smith claims the victims family taunts her man: The man threw the bicycle. Another man came and punched him in his face. The devil has taken over this whole apartment complex. This aint nothing but Satans playground. Grandfather Paul Callis says: The night before last, they came two blocks over and shot my house up.

Longtime KEYE TV CBS CH 42 Austin, TX news anchor Judy Maggio retires at the end of May 2014. Maggio is on Austin's TV beam for 33 years. Judy tells the Austin American-Statesman that she declines a generous contract extension from KEYE to stay. KEYE TV anchor and reporter since June 24, 2013 Walt Maciborski brags: Shes been coming into peoples homes for 33 years. Think about all the lives shes touched. Its going to be weird without her. Were a family. Well have a huge hole. Maciborski, sports director Bob Ballou and chief meteorologist Chikage Windler say that they will miss Maggio when she departs next week: Weve been through four different owners. She is the lifeblood of this station.\n\nHAM RADIO RESCUES HOSPITAL Emergency managers who seek reliable backup communication in a crisis discover a new solution with an old technology: ham radio. Herb Schraufnagel, public safety captain with Emory University Hospital Midtown admits: Its just another avenue, another opportunity for us to be able to communicate. Emory HealthCare is one of a growing number of hospital systems who adopt the use of ham radio. As landlines and cell towers fail, which leaves some Gulf Coast medical centers isolated from the outside world, Hurricane Katrina teaches hospital administrators and government officials a lesson. Barry Thomas, Sr., ham radio enthusiast and employee at Emory University Hospital Midtown, recalls: When power, phone and Internet services go down, a battery-powered amateur radio and portable antenna provides that crucial link to the outside world. Ham radio will never die.\n\nWINDY CITY RADIO CELEBRATES 90 YEARS On Friday, June 27, 2014 Tribune Media unveils the WGN Radio Walk of Fame to celebrate WGN-720's 90th Anniversary.

Then on May 7 everything changes when he sits at the far right end of the desk. Edwards remains still on the far right, but later he stands on his feet. Does someone remove his chair? The move appears on media site TVSpy. A reader believes Edwards rightways migration might be KTTV code for 'well keep moving him right right off the set'.

They said theyre simply experimenting with anchor positions on the new set.\n\nGANNETT SNARES SIX TX TV STATIONS In 2013, Gannett pulls off a massive deal for Dallas-based Belo and its 20 TV stations that includes WFAA TV CH 8 in Dallas, TX for $1.5 billion.
