        "text": "Georgia Primary Results And Predictions For November – Austin’s Daily Commentary\n\nAustin talks about the political mood of a state based on primary results.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin: It’s often difficult to gauge the political mood of a state by its primary results. Turnout issues are always part of the equation as well. But if there’s one race that was decided Tuesday, that may bode well for the Republicans in November, take a look at the only statewide race where you had defined conservative versus a defined liberal, and enough attention on the race where everyone seemed to know what was going on there.\n\nIt was the state Supreme Court race between Justice Andrew Pinson, who, by the way, is a Lincoln County native, and a former congressman and well-known politician, John Barrow. Or as he likes to call himself, John “Berra”.\n\nJohn “Berra” was widely criticized by many in the legal world because his campaign ads did not just urge voters to show up and support him, like most judicial candidates are limited to saying. But no, he actually took political stands on the issue of abortion. A Supreme Court justice candidate for the state of Georgia, telling the voters that he is going to protect a woman’s right to choose no matter what.\n\nFolks, that’s not a judge’s job. A judge is supposed to be an umpire, not someone who sets the rules of the game. And I got to tell you something that campaign did Barrow or “Berra” far more damage than it did him good. As a matter of fact, at the end of the day, even legal scholars across the state were acknowledging as much as they may have personally wanted to support, Barrow that there was no way in the world that they could agree to his tone or the content of his political ads.\n\nPinson pulls out a victory, 55 – 45. And I think that’s going to be close to what Donald Trump finishes at in November. Now, granted, a lot of factors go into what’s going to make up the final vote tally in November. But if you want a good look, a snapshot of the conservative versus liberal take right this minute, in Georgia, 55- 45 conservatives on top.\n\nAnd by the way, Georgia Supreme Court Justice Andrew Pinson thanks you for his victory. John Barrow, see you later. And that’s the comment. I’m Austin Rhodes 95.1 FM News Talk WGAC."
