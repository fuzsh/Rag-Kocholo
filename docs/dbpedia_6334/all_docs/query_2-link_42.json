        "text": "Thunderstorms can be both fascinating and scary, with their electrifying displays of lightning and booming thunder. However, not everyone knows that there are certain things you’re not supposed to do when there’s a thunderstorm.\n\nDuring the summer months, thunderstorms occur frequently due to the high humidity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 73 percent of lightning-related fatalities occur in June, July, and August. According to the National Weather Service, an excess of moisture in the atmosphere, atmospheric instability, and a triggering mechanism are the conditions that lead to thunderstorms. When these elements are combined, they can unleash a powerful symphony of heavy rainfall, thunder, lightning, strong winds, and even hail.\n\nBeing prepared for thunderstorms\n\nThe American Red Cross has some advice on how to get ready for those wild summer thunderstorms. Taking preventive measures like subscribing to local government emergency alerts, equipping your home with backup batteries, and devising a family plan for hazardous weather situations can all prove invaluable during emergencies.\n\nThunderstorm myths and misconceptions\n\nWhen it comes to thunderstorms, there are plenty of myths and misconceptions about what you should avoid doing. One of the most common misconceptions is that wearing rubber-soled shoes or being inside a car with rubber tires makes us immune to lightning strikes. Unfortunately, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Lightning can still travel through the ground or the metal frame of a car, even if it has rubber tires.\n\nMany people believe that as long as they’re not directly under the storm cloud, they are safe from lightning strikes. However, lightning bolts can extend horizontally for significant distances, reaching as far as 10 miles away from the storm. And also keep in mind that trees, especially tall ones, are prime targets for lightning strikes due to their height and conductivity.\n\nAlong with getting prepared and knowing thunderstorm myths, you have to know what not to do during a thunderstorm.\n\nHere are 5 things you should never do during a thunderstorm."
