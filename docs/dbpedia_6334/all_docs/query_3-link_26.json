When his love of music took over while playing in the Ohio State University Jazz Ensemble, then working at the campus radio station, his love of recorded music tipped the scales in favor of being INSIDE of a radio station. He started his career as an air talent for a new local album-oriented rock station, WLVQ, where he also did news reporting. When that station was sold after almost 20 years, he found himself at what was then Clear Channel Radio (now iHeartMedia) and continued on the air, this time playing Top 40 classic hits, but added the duty of being the station cluster's Public Affairs Director. He produced, wrote, and hosted the weekly program for all seven stations. He enlisted the help of sister station WTVN News anchors to provide stories, and he had to reciprocate in kind and help the anchors in the newsroom. That's when the news bug hit, but he wasn't quite ready to hang up the headphones playing music, so he did both. Remarkably, iHeartMedia's Black Information Network came along in 2020, and he went for it. Just like at the Columbus radio cluster, he became the host of the public affairs program. The Black Perspective on BIN uses the same format as his local shows, only this time, there was a unique African-American lean to it. BIN's top-notch anchors contribute heavily to the show. Mike is still at home with Public Affairs hosting but admits the national angle is a sweet challenge!\n\nListen to Mike daily on BIN national newscasts on the iHeartRadio app and Cleveland's BIN 99.1, Columbus' BIN 1230 and on Memphis' BIN.
