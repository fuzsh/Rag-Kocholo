        "text": "Austin talks about his conversation with Columbia County Administrator Scott Johnson about the incorporation of Columbia County.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin Rhodes: Had an opportunity to sit down with Columbia County Administrator Scott Johnson yesterday on the radio show and discuss the ins and outs of incorporation for Columbia County and the benefits it could bring. There does seem to be a slight upcharge on utilities that Scott tells us in the interview can be refunded or reimbursed back to the taxpayers through a property tax rollback.\n\nAgain, this is about 8 or $9 million a year plus untold benefits as far as applying for federal grants and things of that nature. It would make all of unincorporated Columbia County a city. And again, the benefits. I think we would become the fifth-largest city in Georgia overnight with that destination. Is it worth looking into? Most definitely.\n\nA feasibility study has been done, and all of that material is about to be released to the public. We got a copy of it the media did a couple of days ago. I’ve read through the report. It looks like a very professional and solid case is being made for incorporation. It would have to go through with a public vote. I don’t think that your politicians are going to try and steamroll this thing through. Everyone would be able to vote on this, and if it passes a public referendum, we’re in.\n\nIf it doesn’t pass, then it’s over with. But it’s something that certainly Columbia County should consider. It seems like a very positive development for the community. And again, a great way to to collect some money that’s just basically sitting on the table right now waiting to be taken. Check out that report when it comes out. The entire interview’s at the Austin Rhodes Show page on Facebook just looked at it myself a moment ago. And that’s the comment, I’m Austin Rhodes, AM 580/95.1 FM News Talk WGAC.\n\nFor more from The Austin Rhodes Show, click here.\n\nGeorgia Spot Among the Best Cheap Spring Break Trips\n\nSpring break always arrives at just the right time.
