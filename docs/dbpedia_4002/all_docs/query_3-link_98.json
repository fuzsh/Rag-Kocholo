        "text": "NC State’s season opener vs. Western Carolina is right around the corner, with kickoff set for 7pm on Thursday night. Before kickoff, let’s preview the Wolfpack Defensive Line.\n\nStarters\n\nLeft Defensive End – Senior Davin Vann (6’2″/276)\n\nNose Tackle – Junior Brandon Cleveland (6’4″/315)\n\nRight Defensive End – Redshirt Junior Travali Price (6’4″/283)\n\nThe return of Vann was one of the most significant stories of the offseason. Vann could have entered his name in the 2024 NFL Draft, and heard his name called. Instead, he returned to increase his Draft Stock, and take care of unfinished business.\n\nPrior to the 2023 season, Wolfpack head coach Dave Doeren honored Vann with the #1 jersey, which is given to the player that leads the team in work ethic, training and leadership. Vann was also named a captain this past season.\n\nVann’s PFF grade of 76.5 this past season was the third highest on the team behind Payton Wilson and Robert Kennedy III. He recorded 42 tackles, 7 tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks as a Junior this season.\n\nVann has the 4th most Career QB Pressures out of all Power 5 players heading into the 2024 season, and the 2nd most in the ACC.\n\nBruce Feldman, of The Athletic, recently released his annual Freaks List, and Vann jumped 34 spots this year, landing at #6.\n\n6. Davin Vann, NC State, defensive end\n\nWolfpack strength coach Dantonio Burnette has an impressive track record of producing Freaks, and Vann is the latest in the pipeline. Last year, the former state champion wrestler and track star was ranked No. 40 on our list. Now, the 6-2 Vann has moved up after dropping a full tenth of a second off his 40-yard-dash time to a blistering 4.69 seconds despite weighing 276 pounds. Vann bench-pressed 440 pounds (up from 405 last year), did 31 reps of 225, cleaned 365 and squatted 580 to go with a 33-inch vertical. He has been a disruptive force for the Wolfpack, notching six sacks, seven TFLs and 42 tackles last season. (The Athletic)\n\nIn 2023, Cleveland had 28 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss, 3 sacks and 2 forced fumbles. The Nose Tackle position is in good hands with Cleveland, whose PFF Grade of 69.5 was the 8th best on the Wolfpack defense this season, and was better than CJ Clark’s (transferred to Miami), who was the starter last season.\n\nCleveland has put on 15 pounds since last season, preparing himself to stuff the middle at Nose Tackle.\n\nPrice is filling the shoes that Savion Jackson filled at Defensive End. Prior to now, Price has primarily been used as a 3rd down pass rush specialist. This offseason, he transformed his body, adding 13 pounds.\n\nPrice was a 4-star prospect in the 2021 recruiting class, with ON3 ranking him as the #186 overall player nationally, the #17 Defensive End and the #11 player in the state of North Carolina.\n\nLast season, Price had 13 tackles in 295 snaps, with 1.5 tackles for loss, 1 sack and 5 QB Hurries.\n\n2nd String\n\nRight Defensive End – Redshirt Senior Noah Potter (6’6″/274)\n\nNose Tackle – Redshirt Sophomore DJ Jackson (6’2″/180)\n\nLeft Defensive End – Senior Red Hibbler (6’2″/271)\n\nHibbler spent this offseason trying to be more than just a pass rusher. He wants to be a 3-down player, and has worked very hard at his run defense skills. Despite the fact that Hibbler has worked to become a more well-rounded player, he was undeniably NC State’s best pass rusher last season, leading the Pack with 6.5. He also tied for the lead in forced fumbles (2), and tied for 2nd in tackles for loss (7). Recording only 13 tackles on the year, over half of them were for a loss. Hibbler’s PFF grade of 69.6 this past season ranked 8th on the team. Despite not being named a starter in Week 1, Hibbler will definitely be a significant part of the Wolfpack’s D-Line.\n\nLast season was Hibbler’s first season in Raleigh, after playing his first three seasons in the JUCO ranks.\n\nPotter struggled in his first season at NC State last year, recording a PFF Grade of 50.7, after transferring from Ohio St. He had 2 tackles in 112 snaps, with 2 QB Hurries.\n\nThere has been good buzz surrounding Jackson this offseason. He has been described as a good compliment to Cleveland, bringing more quickness and “twitchiness.” Jackson is itching to play football for the first time since his Junior year in High School. He missed his Senior season due to an ACL injury, and didn’t play at NC State in 2022 as he continued to recover from it. The injuries continued last year, with Jackson missing the whole season due to an achilles injury.\n\nJackson had 20+ tackles for loss his Sophomore and Junior years in High School, and was the #15 player in the state of South Carolina in the 2022 class according to Rivals.\n\n3rd String\n\nNose Tackle – Senior Chazz Wallace (6’2″/317)\n\nLeft Defensive End – Redshirt Freshman Isaiah Shirley (6’3″/276)\n\nWallace transferred to NC State this offseason from Colorado. Last season under Coach Prime, Wallace had 10 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks. He played in 10 games, starting in 4. Prior to last season, Wallace played his first three years at Old Dominion.\n\nConsidering Wallace’s age and experience, it’s impressive to see Jackson in the 2nd string. Expect Wallace to push him for that spot.\n\nShirley will play on both sides of the ball again in 2024. He will play Defensive End, but also move over to the other side of the ball as a blocking Tight End when called upon. Coming out of high school, Shirley was the #16 player in the state of North Carolina in the 2023 recruiting class according to 247Sports.\n\nMake sure to check out our other position group previews:\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nRunning Backs\n\nWide Receivers\n\nTight Ends\n\nOffensive Line\n\nIn this post, I’ll be previewing the NC State Offense was we approach the 2024 season opener this Thursday night against Western Carolina.\n\nStarters\n\nLeft Tackle – Redshirt Senior Anthony Belton (6’6″/356)\n\nLeft Guard – Redshirt Junior Anthony Carter Jr. (6’3″/315)\n\nCenter – Redshirt Senior Zeke Correll (6’3″/310)\n\nRight Guard – Redshirt Senior Timothy McCkay (6’4″/321)\n\nRight Tackle – Redshirt Sophomore Jacarrius Peak (6’4″/298)\n\nThe Wolfpack returns a ton of experience on the O-Line in 2024. Belton and McKay started all 13 games for NC State last year, and Correll started every game for Notre Dame. Carter Jr. started in 12 of the 13 games. Peak started the last 6 games of the season at Right Tackle.\n\n2023 PFF Grades\n\nBelton – 65.9\n\nPeak – 64.5\n\nCorrell – 62.0\n\nMcKay – 57.6\n\nCarter Jr. – 56.5\n\nBelton earned 3rd Team All-ACC honors last season, and is projected to be a 1st Round NFL Draft pick next Spring. He spent his first two seasons in the JUCO ranks, playing for Georgia Military Academy. The fact that the former 3-Star High School prospect, who went the JUCO route, is being considered a possible 1st round pick next year, is a testament to his hard work, and the developmental work of the Wolfpack coaching staff.\n\nCorrell transferred in from Notre Dame this offseason, and due to injury, he wasn’t able to play in the Spring. Despite that fact, he found a way to lead from the back, without pads on. Even though he’s only been here for a little while, his teammates voted for him to be one of their four captains.\n\nHe was a multi-year starter for the Irish, starting in 30 of the 41 games he played in. Out of high school, he was a consensus 4-star prospect, with 247Sports ranking him as the #81 overall player nationally in the 2019 recruiting class.\n\nHis strength lies in pass protection, recording a grade of 78.0 according to ProFootballFocus, which was 2nd on the team\n\nCarter Jr. did start in 12 of 13 games last year, but his PFF Grade was the lowest of any of the starters last year (56.5). Doeren has indicated that Carter Jr. is healthy after recovering from offseason surgery, and has had a good Fall Camp.\n\nMcKay started the first 7 games last year at Right Tackle, but moved to Right Guard against Clemson, and remained there the rest of the year. Guard is a more natural position for McKay, and it’s good to see him get to work there the whole offseason, preparing him for consistency. McKay has started 22 games heading into 2024.\n\nPeak was also destined to be a stud. ON3 rated him as a 4-Star prospect coming out of High School, the #164 overall player nationally, the #14 Offensive Tackle and the #17 player in the state of Georgia. He might be undersized, but Peak might be the most talented player on the Wolfpack Offensive Line.\n\n2nd String O-Line\n\nLeft Tackle – Redshirt Freshman Rico Jackson (6’6″/323)\n\nLeft Guard – Redshirt Senior Dawson Jaramillo (6’5″/300)\n\nCenter – Redshirt Sophomore Rylan Vann (6’1″/297)\n\nRight Guard – Redshirt Sophomore Val Erickson (6’4″/316)\n\nRight Tackle – Redshirt Junior Patrick Matan (6’4″/316)\n\nJaramillo is definitely the most experienced of the 2nd string, playing 409 career snaps at Oregon before transferring to NC State before the 2023 season. Prior to last season, he unfortunately suffered a season ending knee injury, but the NCAA granted him an extra year of eligibility. On the 1st day of camp, Jaramillo was the 2nd string Center. At Oregon, he played all over the Offensive Line, making him a Swiss Army Knife for the Pack. Coming out of High School, ESPN ranked him as the #1 player in the state of Oregon, and the #127 overall player nationally in the 2018 recruiting class.\n\nWhile Carter Jr. is the returning starter, if he waivers at all, it would be interesting to see if Jaramillo or Erickson stepped in. Also, in a situation where Zeke Correll wasn’t available, I wonder if Vann would be the first person out, or if Jaramillo would move over from Guard.\n\nErickson transferred in from Missouri this offseason.\n\n3rd String\n\nLeft Tackle – Redshirt Freshman Darion Rivers (6’6″/308)\n\nLeft Guard – Redshirt Freshman Kamen Smith (6’5″/323)\n\nBoth Rivers and Smith are young, but extremely talented. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them challenge anyone on the 2nd string.\n\nMake sure to check out our other position group previews:\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nRunning Backs\n\nWide Receivers\n\nTight Ends"
