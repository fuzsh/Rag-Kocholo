A place where I could try new experiences and activities, that gave the opportunity for personal growth . A home of lifetime friendships spanning decades. Now I'm a parent of a Gibbons graduate and two current students and while some things have changed the sense of tradition and opportunity continue.\n\n- Mrs. Mickie Baldwin Â’84, ND-BG Parent\n\nMy granddaughter Audrey V graduated on Saturday as a member of the Class of 2020. I just wanted to thank all of the faculty and staff for making this day so special. NDBG was able to give these students their special time to end their High School careers Kudos to all. As a Notre Dame graduate, myself, class of 1964, I am so proud of the legacy of both ND and BG. I have enjoyed returning to the school many times during the time Audrey has been a student, it brought back so many memories of times spent in the very same hallways. I cherish those memories, traditions and values more than words can express.\n\n- Marianne Dussault Ille"
