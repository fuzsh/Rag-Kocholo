        "text": "My interest in running started when I was in the 6th grade based on placing 29th overall in the Cazenovia July 4th 5K (374 entries, 20:26, 07/04/21, Leone Timing) on no training. My interest turned to passion in the 7th grade because of winning the majority of the middle school cross country and track races. Later that fall, I ran in the Cazenovia Pumpkin 5K finishing in 3rd place right behind two members of the varsity cross country team (136 entries, 19:06, runsignup.com). This turned out to be my big break because those runners talked the varsity cross country coach into promoting me to the varsity cross country team in 8th grade. My proudest accomplishments so far include being the first 8th grader in school history to be promoted to varsity cross country, being the first freshman in school history to qualify for states as an individual in varsity cross country, being awarded the most valuable runner in cross country in 9th grade, running in the Nike Indoor Nationals as a freshman, and developing and sticking to a strict training and nutrition plan.\n\nI know you probably hear this all the time, but my hero is Steve Prefontaine. I have read about him and watched his races. I have learned that I need to be determined, goal oriented and disciplined in all aspects of my life.\n\nWhile in high school, I want to push myself academically and athletically so I can have as many options as possible for college. My goal is to find the right college which will continue to push me academically and athletically so I can fulfill my dreams of becoming a teacher and one of the nation's leading distance runners."
