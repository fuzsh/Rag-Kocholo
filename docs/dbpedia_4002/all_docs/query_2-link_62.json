        "text": "Former Bishop Gorman standout and Las Vegas native Vashti Cunningham missed out on a medal in the women’s high jump final Sunday.\n\nCunningham was part of a six-way tie for third at 1.95 meters cleared. Ukraine’s Iryna Gerashchenko and Australia’s Eleanor Patterson shared the bronze medal thanks to the total misses tiebreaker. They each had three. Cunningham had four to finish in fifth place.\n\n“Today went better than (Friday’s qualifying round), in my opinion. I cleared more bars and had better attempts,” Cunningham said. “It’s crazy that it came down to the height that I made to get a medal and one more miss than the other people.”\n\nCunningham’s first miss came at 1.91 meters. Her other three were at 1.98 meters. The 26-year-old still earned her best finish at the Olympics after placing 13th in 2016 and sixth in 2021.\n\n“This has just been a different season for me than any season I’ve ever had,” Cunningham said. “I’m learning to just roll with it and know that the battle that I’m facing is not medals. It’s different. It’s spiritual. I feel like I won the battle today.”\n\nCunningham has been dealing with a bulging disk the last few months. She said it felt fine when she left for Paris but it started to flare up after one of her makes Sunday.\n\n“That’s not the reason I didn’t jump as high as I wanted to,” Cunningham said. “I felt good about my performance. I was happy when I made the bar and when I missed the bar, I knew what I was doing wrong.”\n\nUkraine’s Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Australia’s Nicola Olyslagers each cleared 2 meters, but Mahuchikh earned the gold thanks to her three total misses. Olyslagers had five to take silver.\n\nWomen’s basketball: Aces guard Jackie Young scored 19 points to help the U.S. beat Germany 87-68 in pool play. A’ja Wilson added 14 points and Kelsey Plum had six points and five assists. The U.S. finished 3-0 in Group C and will play in the quarterfinals Wednesday.\n\nMen’s golf: Las Vegas resident Min Woo Lee, playing for Australia, shot 3-under 68 in the final round and finished tied for 22nd at 7-under 277. Las Vegas resident Collin Morikawa finished tied for 24th at 6-under 278 while representing Team USA. He shot 1-under 70 in the final round.\n\nMen’s swimming: Ilya Kharun, who trains with the Sandpipers of Nevada, helped Canada finish fifth (3:31.27) in the 4x100 medley relay final. China won the gold medal (3:27.46) and the U.S. won the silver (3:28.01). Kharun, 19, won a pair of individual bronze medals in the 100 and 200 meter butterfly.\n\nMonday’s schedule\n\nNo locals are competing.\n\nTuesday’s schedule\n\nNo locals are competing.\n\nOlympic TV schedule\n\nMONDAY\n\nNBC\n\n— 9 a.m.: Men’s volleyball, quarterfinal, France vs. Germany (live)\n\n— 10 a.m.: Men’s 3x3 basketball, semifinal (live)\n\n— 10:30 a.m.: Track and field, finals (live)\n\n— 1 p.m.: 3x3 basketball, gold medal games (live)\n\n— 2 p.m.: Beach volleyball, round of 16\n\n— 3 p.m.: Kayak, slalom cross finals (replay)\n\n— 3:30 p.m.: Women’s cycling, team sprint (replay)\n\n— 4 p.m.: Women’s diving, 10-meter platform semifinal (replay)\n\n— 5:15 p.m.: Men’s gymnastics, apparatus finals (replay)\n\n— 8 p.m.: Primetime in Paris (replays of track and field finals and women’s gymnastics apparatus finals)\n\n— 11:35 p.m.: Late Night (replays of 3x3 basketball medal games)\n\nE!\n\n— 1 a.m.: Women’s diving, 10-meter platform preliminaries (live)\n\n— 2:45 a.m.: Gymnastics, apparatus finals (live)\n\n— 6 a.m.: Women’s diving, 10-meter platform semifinal (live)\n\n— 8 a.m.: Beach volleyball, round of 16 (live)\n\n— 9 a.m.: Men’s soccer, semifinal, Morocco vs. Spain (live)\n\n— 11 a.m.: Artistic swimming, team technical routine (live)\n\n— Noon: 3x3 basketball, bronze medal games (live)\n\n— 1 p.m.: Equestrian, jumping, individual qualifier\n\nUSA\n\n— 12:40 a.m.: Men’s 3x3 basketball, pool play, U.S. vs. Netherlands (replay)\n\n— 1 a.m.: Track and field, heats (live)\n\n— 4:15 a.m.: Beach volleyball, round of 16 (live)\n\n— 6 a.m.: Shooting, mixed team skeet final (live)\n\n— 7:15 a.m.: Kayak, slalom cross finals (live)\n\n— 8:05 a.m.: Sport climbing, men’s combined, women’s speed\n\n— 8:30 a.m.: 3x3 basketball, semifinals (live)\n\n— 9:30 a.m.: Men’s water polo, group stage, U.S. vs. Croatia (live)\n\n— 10:45 a.m.: Women’s field hockey, quarterfinal, Belgium vs. Spain (live)\n\n— Noon: Men’s soccer, semifinal, Egypt vs. France (live)\n\n— 2 p.m.: Wrestling, eliminations\n\n— 3 p.m.: Men’s volleyball, quarterfinal\n\n— 5 p.m.: Women’s badminton, final\n\n— 6 p.m.: Women’s cycling, team sprint (replay)\n\n— 6:30 p.m.: Men’s badminton, final, and men’s shooting, rapid-fire pistol\n\n— 7:30 p.m.: 3x3 basketball, bronze medal games (replay)\n\nTUESDAY\n\nNBC\n\n— 9 a.m.: Women’s volleyball, quarterfinal (live)\n\n— 10:35 a.m.: Track and field, finals (live)\n\n— 1 p.m.: Beach volleyball, quarterfinal (live)\n\n— 2 p.m.: Women’s water polo, quarterfinal\n\n— 3 p.m.: Canoe, kayak sprint heats (replay)\n\n— 3:30 p.m.: Men’s cycling, team sprint (replay)\n\n— 4 p.m.: Men’s diving, 3-meter springboard preliminaries (replay)\n\n— 5:15 p.m.: Equestrian, jumping, individual final (replay)\n\n— 8 p.m.: Primetime in Paris (women’s diving, 10-meter platform final, and replay of track and field finals)\n\n— 11:35 p.m.: Late Night (sport climbing, men’s speed, women’s boulder, and replay of women’s skateboarding park final)\n\nE!\n\n— 1 a.m.: Men’s diving, 3-meter springboard preliminaries (live)\n\n— 2 a.m.: Men’s basketball, quarterfinal, Germany vs. Greece (live)\n\n— 4 a.m.: Equestrian, jumping, individual final (live)\n\n— 5:30 a.m.: Women’s skateboarding, park qualifying (live)\n\n— 6:30 a.m.: Canoe, kayak sprint heats (live)\n\n— 7:15 a.m.: Women’s handball, quarterfinal\n\n— 8:30 a.m.: Women’s skateboarding, park final (live)\n\n— 9:15 a.m.: Women’s sport climbing, boulder semifinal (live)\n\n— 10 a.m.: Women’s water polo, quarterfinal (live)\n\n— 11:15 a.m.: Men’s cycling, team sprint (live)\n\n— Noon: Women’s soccer, semifinal, Brazil vs. Spain (live)\n\n— 2 p.m.: Artistic swimming, team free routine\n\nUSA\n\n— Midnight: Men’s badminton, final\n\n— 1 a.m.: Track and field, repechages (live)\n\n— 4 a.m.: Men’s sport climbing, speed qualifying (live)\n\n— 5 a.m.: Wrestling, eliminations\n\n— 5:30 a.m.: Men’s basketball, quarterfinal, Serbia vs. Australia (live)\n\n— 7:15 a.m.: Women’s volleyball, quarterfinal\n\n— 8:45 a.m.: Women’s soccer, semifinal, U.S. vs. Germany (live)\n\n— 11:15 a.m.: Beach volleyball, quarterfinal\n\n— 12:15 p.m.: Men’s basketball, quarterfinal, U.S. vs. Brazil (live)\n\n— 2:15 p.m.: Wrestling, finals\n\n— 3 p.m.: Women’s volleyball, quarterfinal\n\n— 5 p.m.: Men’s field hockey, semifinal\n\n— 6 p.m.: Women’s handball, quarterfinal\n\n— 7 p.m.: Boxing, finals\n\n— 7:30 p.m.: Beach volleyball, quarterfinal\n\n— 8:30 p.m.: Men’s basketball, quarterfinal\n\n— 10:30 p.m.: Track and field, mixed team race walk (live)"
