        "text": "MILFORD—On October 11, Bridgeport’s Kolbe Cathedral High School hosted its first annual fundraising golf tournament at the Great River Golf Club in Milford. On a beautiful fall day, the inaugural Kolbe Cathedral Cup drew 88 golfers and raised almost $40,000 for the school. Participants included Board Chair Terry O’Connor, Treasurer Jon O’Herron, Jr. and board members Robert Aufiero, Kevin Grimes, Tom Reilly and John Sites. Also in attendance was former KCHS basketball star Chris Smith who went on to play in the NBA and is still the leading career scorer in UCONN history.\n\nMajor sponsors included the O’Herron Family Foundation, Paloian Family Foundation, Kaulbach Charitable Foundation, Maximilian Kolbe Scholarship, Trumbull Taiwan Associates, People’s United Bank and KeyBank. Major donors included Brooklawn Country Club, New Haven Country Club, Race Brook Country Club, Summit Golf Brands, Charles Nemetz, Kevin & Mary Cunningham, Jon & Andrea Maldon, Photo Bourgeoisie and Vazzy’s Restaurants.\n\n“We are thrilled with the first-year turnout and support we received from sponsors, donors and participants,” said Rick Ryan, KCHS Director of Development. “We have always done a lot more with a lot less here at Kolbe so $40,000 will go a long way in support of our critical mission to empower our underserved students with a rigorous education and Catholic values.” The day started with lunch, then golf followed by a post-tournament reception where attendees viewed a newly-produced Kolbe Cathedral video and heard from Principal Camille Figluizzi. Subsequently, a live auction then the announcement of raffle and tournament winners concluded the day.\n\n“Kolbe Cathedral is grateful to all participants and particularly the new friends that we made with our golf tournament,” said Principal Figluizzi, “but I’m especially proud of our students Eliana Baker, Christopher Morel and Exauce Mpoyi who volunteered their time on a day off (Columbus Day) to work at the event. I’m also thankful to the members of the Fairfield Prep and St. Joseph girls golf teams who came out to support our kids and our school.”\n\nAbout Kolbe Cathedral\n\nKolbe Cathedral is a small, private, Catholic, college preparatory school located in the heart of Bridgeport. It was formed by the diocese in 1976 by combining Kolbe Boys HS and Cathedral Girls HS. Forty-five years later, it continues to be a much-needed beacon of hope and an instrument of personal transformation for its diverse, multicultural, co-ed student population in “the Hollow” section of the largest and poorest city in Connecticut. Our student body is 45% Black/African American, 43% Hispanic/Latino and 12% White/Asian/Other. In spite of the adverse economic and social conditions, and in stark contrast to the city’s public schools (with high dropout and non-graduation rates), Kolbe Cathedral graduates 100% of its students and boasts a near 100% college acceptance rate. Further, our success is even more impressive in light of the lowest private high school tuition in the state of $8,650 (with 99% of students receiving some sort of financial aid) which is about half of what Bridgeport and Hartford public schools spend per student and with dismal outcomes. The mantra to our students is simple and effective …”Work Hard And Be Nice.”\n\nDANBURY—Immaculate High School recognized athletes who have made a remarkable contribution to the school’s athletic program in years past. Long-time broadcaster, sports director, program director for WLAD radio and WSCU Hall of Fame member, Bart Busterna, was the Master of Ceremonies at the Ethan Allen Hotel, Danbury.\n\nAfter an insightful speech that focused on fostering good sportsmanship and moral character in student-athletes, Busterna introduced the school’s inductees, including the 1995 SWC and CT State girls soccer team champions; four-year all-conference baseball player who held the record for most wins and innings pitched in the early ‘70s and lettered Class M basketball player, Walter “Dusty” Thompson ‘71; captain of the 1986 undefeated WCC league and Class S championship football team, offensive guard and middle linebacker, Jonathan Fenaroli’ 87; starter on the undefeated 1985 freshman basketball team, member of the 1986 championship basketball team, three-time defending WCC All Conference long jump champion, All-State Track and Field and Class M 100M State Championship winner, Alex Ascensio, ‘89; multiple SWC, All New England and MVP championship indoor track, Moira (Kenny) Howly ‘09; three-time All-State running back, defensive back player and record holder of the school’s Most Interceptions in a Career award, Zach Long ‘04; three-sport athlete who set a single season baseball record with 30 stolen bases and leading the team to the school’s first ever state championship, Anthony SImone, ‘01; starting point guard and two-time SWC honors recipient and four-year All SWC singles tennis player with a four-year record of playing in the CT State Open quarterfinals, Lauren (MacKay) Neeley; two-time All-State basketball player, four-time All SWC Conference team, four-time News Times All Area team member named in the “Top 25 Best Athletes of the Decade” and 1,176 point career scorer, Lindsay (Brown) Smith ‘06.\n\nIn addition, a Mustang Athletic Appreciation Award was presented to local Danbury resident, Michael Szabocsan, known as Big Mike to the school community. As its #1 fan, Mike, who did not attend Immaculate nor has had any relatives enrolled at Immaculate, has been attending basketball, soccer, football, hockey regular season and postseason championship games for the past thirty years.\n\nImmaculate High School is a private, non-profit Catholic college-preparatory institution serving students from 28 communities in Connecticut and New York. Founded in 1962, Immaculate High School also allows students to focus on academic excellence, spiritual development, service to others, and personal goals. Located in Danbury, Conn., Immaculate High School is part of the Diocese of Bridgeport’s school system.\n\nSTRATFORD—St. Mark School congratulates 8th-grade student, Robert “Robby” Rosati, for leading his team to 2nd place in the National Car Rental PGA Jr. League Championship this past weekend.\n\nRobby and Team Connecticut, one of the twelve All-Star Teams of players ages 10-13, competed in the Semi Finals at Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nRobby and his teammate won their round with seven birdies and one eagle. Robby’s eagle shot at the 17th hole secured the flag in the final round.\n\nAccording to the PGA Jr. League, the championship season highlights the aspirational nature of competition. All-Star Teams must win Section Championships before advancing to Regional competitions and ultimately the National Car Rental PGA Jr. League Championship.\n\n“Watching Robby excel at his favorite sport was extraordinary,” commented St. Mark Principal Melissa Warner. “Our school community is so incredibly proud of him and excited to see his talent being recognized nationally,” she added.\n\nThe championship was broadcast live on select ESPN networks. During a televised interview, Robby commented that history was his favorite school subject because he likes learning about the past.\n\n“As Robby’s Social Studies teacher, I am deeply impressed by his athletic achievements,” shared St. Mark teacher, Matt Bonito. “However, what impresses me the most about Robby is his fascination with history. On classwork and projects, such as our class Constitution, Robby always shows a level of dedication and engagement that mirrors students I have had in higher education. All of us benefit from Robby’s presence in our class and the insights he frequently shares. I am incredibly proud to teach history to Robby and I am even happier to see him make it.”\n\nSt. Mark School is planning a warm welcome upon Robby’s return.\n\nBRIDGEPORT– Three diocesan High Schools have officially joined as Catholic Relief Services (CRS )Clubs to support the official international humanitarian agency of the Catholic community in the United States. The agency alleviates suffering and provides assistance to people in need in more than 100 countries.\n\nImmaculate High School in Danbury, Kolbe Cathedral High School in Bridgeport, and Notre Dame High School in Fairfield have all joined the CRS network of clubs. Immaculate High School led the way with 167 students signing up as club members.\n\nNora Ferreira Aufiero , Community Engagement Manager for Catholic Relief Services, Northeast Mid-Atlantic Region, said she was delighted by the response from the Diocese. Additionally, she said there is interest in an adult chapter of the Club and hopes to schedule a Zoom meeting with those who are interested by mid to late October.\n\n“I believe that CRS Club can be true agents of change and an integral part of the movement to build a better world,” said Aufiero. “Young people have the power, energy and passion to drive real change, and their actions are essential to achieve our vision—God’s vision—of a world free of hunger, violence and injustice.\n\nCRS clubs empower students to contribute in a tangible way to join in the effort to lift millions of people out of poverty while developing leadership skills they can use to continue to be changemakers into the future, she said.\n\nBishop Frank J. Caggiano , who was named Chairman of the international catholic relief agency in 2019, welcomed the news and said that he was proud of the students for their commitment to others and their willingness to become part of the larger CRS community.\n\n“I am grateful to our young people for choosing to become missionary disciples who believe that in Christ we can build a more just and equitable world,” he said.\n\n“The number of those who are impoverished and endangered is staggering. Many persons live in fear and constant anxiety. The needs of minimal sustenance, particularly water, are of paramount importance and invite us to help. CRS reaches out to our global family,” the bishop said.\n\nThe bishop said that CRS Clubs across the country are giving students the opportunity to learn about issues of global injustice and involving their school community in impactful actions such as advocacy and fundraising.\n\nThe bishop said that CRS is “a bright light for all of our brothers and sisters overseas who don’t have enough to eat or a place to sleep because of entrenched poverty. All of God’s children have the right to live in just and peaceful societies, and for more than 75 years CRS has worked toward making that a reality.”\n\nCatholic Relief Services is the USCCB agency that provides global humanitarian assistance to those in need in two critical ways: by responding to man-made and natural disasters and providing direct assistance to those in need. Its mission seeks effective ways by which every human person can be assisted to realize his or her full human integral development in an environment that is peaceful and sustainable.\n\nFounded in 1943 by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the agency provides assistance to 130 million people in more than 100 countries and territories in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.\n\nFor more information on student and adult CRs clubs, contact Nora Ferreira Aufiero, Community Engagement Manager | Catholic Relief Services, Northeast Mid-Atlantic Region, Cell: 631-897-9129 | crs.org | crsespanol.org or visit the website at: https://www.crs.org/sites/default/files/crs-club-action-calendar-20-21.pdf\n\nPhoto: Members of the new CRS Club at Notre Dame High School in Fairfield\n\nSTRATFORD—The theme for the 2021-2022 academic year at St. Mark School is “Teamwork.”\n\nPrincipal Melissa Warner shares, “Each year we reflect upon our recent accomplishments and set goals for the new one. With so many new faces this year—faculty, staff and students, we acknowledge the importance of community building, collaboration and teamwork. We believe that teamwork is at the heart of achievement and success. It draws from everyone’s God-given talents, unique strengths and expertise and keeps us united and stronger.”\n\nPrincipal Warner shares that on November 6, the school hopes to showcase its “teamwork” to the community by participating as a team in the annual Vicki Soto 5K. “Collectively, we will show our support of our hometown hero and fellow educator in the town race,” said Warner.\n\nIn past years, the St. Mark School community has participated in the Vicki Soto 5k, which benefits the Vicki Soto Memorial Fund, established in honor of Vicki’s passion for education. In honor of the 27-year old first-grade teacher who lost her life in the Sandy Hook mass shooting, the fund awards scholarships to students pursuing careers in education.\n\nAbout St. Mark School\n\nSt. Mark School is a Blue Ribbon School recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as a National School of Academic Excellence. Its academic program encompasses pre-kindergarten through grade eight. The expectations and challenges of its curriculum prepare students for the moral, intellectual, social, technological and physical demands of today’s society.\n\n(For more information, please visit www.stmarkschool.org.)\n\nSTAMFORD—With a bit of faith and a bit of dirt, The Catholic Academy of Stamford launched its CAS Grows Garden this fall, the newest of the outdoor resources available to students at the school. The garden was lovingly built over the spring and summer with the hard work and generosity of school parents, and boasts seven raised garden beds, one in-ground bed, numerous containers and a sturdy fence to cradle the space, with improvements and additions to be added over time.\n\nStudents are already enjoying this season’s activities, which range from planting seeds and managing vegetable beds, to overseeing beneficial flowers and watering, and they learn about their environment through games, books and exploration. The CAS teachers have been helpful and enthusiastic partners in sharing this addition with their classes. The garden is also a resource for visual learning for topics already in the curriculum, and everyone benefits from the extra dose of fresh air during the school day.\n\nFruit, vegetable and herb gardening is a hands-on exercise in patience and perseverance that can bring great joy and wonder. It can also foster an appreciation for the origin of food, as well as an insight into the relationships of all things in the natural world. Gardening-based programs implemented in schools have been shown to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, and there is also evidence that the benefits can extend to stress reduction and teamwork building. This new initiative will certainly be a valued learning experience for all.\n\nBy sharing God’s gift of nature in this way, The Catholic Academy of Stamford helps to build a foundational understanding of the continued importance of natural stewardship in our lives and health. CAS students are encouraged to practice gratitude, respect, curiosity and care in their living classroom. The whole school is hoping to share a plentiful harvest this season, and is looking forward to seeing how it grows!\n\nBy Danielle Jahn, CAS parent of a 4th-grade student\n\nFAIRFIELD—Notre Dame High School has partnered with St. Charles Catholic High School in LaPlace, Louisiana—a community devastated by Hurricane Ida.\n\n“In the days following the hurricane and after a quick online search, I reached out to the principal and assistant principal at St. Charles Catholic High School in LaPlace,” said ND Principal Chris Cipriano. “I identified St. Charles because it reminded me so much of ND—a diverse diocesan high school, in the suburbs, with about 450 students.” Principal Cipriano sent an email, offering prayers and made an inquiry to see if the ND community could be of assistance. “Considering the area is still without power nearly two weeks after the storm, I was pleasantly surprised to hear back,” he said.\n\nPrincipal Cipriano asked if the Notre Dame community were able to collect and deliver supplies to their school, would they be able to receive and distribute them to their community? The answer was a quick yes.\n\n“After reviewing the list of requested items, I recognized how great the need is in LaPlace,” Cipriano said.\n\nNotre Dame’s goal is now to drive a truck full of supplies from Fairfield to LaPlace early next week—as the need is immediate.\n\n“To accomplish this ambitious goal, we are humbly asking for your support,” said principal Cipriano. “A wide-ranging list of items (from food to toys to brooms to shovels) requested by the St. Charles community can be found here.”\n\nNotre Dame will be collecting contributions this Thursday and Friday, September 9 and 10, during school hours (7 am-3 pm) and on Saturday, September 11 from 11 am – 2 pm. If you would like to make a monetary gift instead, click here.\n\n“Together, we will spread love and kindness to a fellow Catholic high school community that is struggling,” said principal Cipriano.\n\nNEWTOWN—Students at St. Rose of Lima in Newtown were met on their first day of school with a VIP greeting committee of Mr. Gjoka, Msgr.

Students started off the day with a “backpack blessing,” performed by Msgr. Royal, pastor of St. Mary Church.\n\nStudents were given tags to attach to their backpacks with the following blessing:\n\nLord, bless these backpacks and the children and youth who carry them as they begin yet another year of school. Give them peace when they feel nervous, focus when they feel distracted, energy when they feel tired. Open their minds to the lessons they will learn both in and outside the classroom. Help them to make friends that build one another up, and be friends to those who need them. Guide them in making good choices as they grow in wisdom and maturity.

The GarlicFest was founded originally by Father Bill Sangiovanni, a long-time Notre Dame administrator and passionate supporter of Catholic education.\n\nFather Bill was intrigued when he visited the famed Gilroy Garlic Fest in California. He had the foresight to bring an all garlic-themed menu back to Connecticut in April 1992. That year, nearly 10,000 people attended the event and enjoyed the incredible selection of garlic-flavored foods and dynamic entertainment. The rest is garlic history! After a 15 year pause, the Garlic Fest returned in 2019 and will be back again this fall. Upon the passing of Father Bill, thousands of Lancers gathered to celebrate his life and many contributions to the community. Of the many memories recalled, the Garlic Fest was at the top of the list. It is in Father Bill’s honor that the tradition has returned to our school.\n\nJoin us for an array of food trucks, beverages, craft and food vendors, the Garlic Bites children’s entertainment area, bingo and live music for adults and children. Garlic Fest will deliver tasty food and fun for every age group. Notre Dame alumni are encouraged to stop by the Alumni Tent for a chance to reminisce and reconnect with fellow Lancers.\n\nCurrent ND Principal Chris Cipriano commented, “This is a wonderful way to continue living the legacy of Father Bill. No one can replace him at the Fest wearing his famous garlic hat, but the spirit of the festival and the tremendous community event it was is back.”\n\nEvent proceeds will benefit the Father Bill Sangiovanni Memorial Scholarship and the students of ND Fund. Join us on September 24 and 25 to celebrate the old and the new all in support of our Notre Dame.\n\n(For more information and to purchase tickets, please visit NDgarlicfest.com.

The council has a tradition of assisting local Catholic schools with various projects to get ready for the upcoming school year.\n\nOn Saturday, August 7, the council went to work on beautifying the science playground at All Saints Catholic School. The Knights spread over 80 yards of mulch. As schools prepare to come back after the summer break it is important to spruce up the grounds for the children and make the school a welcoming and warm place.\n\n“Anything we can do to help make the return to school even a little bit better especially during these unpredictable times is a great thing,” said Council Grand Knight Anthony Armentano.\n\nOn Saturday, August 14, the Council 14360 mulching crew headed to Wilton to help their friends at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Academy in Wilton. It was a large job made much easier by a large turnout from the Knights, along with parents and students from OLF Catholic Academy. St. Matthew Knight’s member AJ Cossuto of AJ’s Landscaping Service, LLC donated his equipment once again to help move the mulch to the two playgrounds. “We are so thankful for Brother AJ’s generosity in donating his time and equipment to this project, said Council Past Grand Knight and project chairman George Ribellino.\n\nThis is the fourth year Council 14360 has assisted Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Academy and has become an annual council event Carmel Bowron, one of the parents at OLF Catholic Academy, reached out to the St. Matthew Knights in 2018 since she was familiar with their work at St. Matthew Church, All Saints Catholic School, Notre Dame Health and Rehabilitation Center and Malta House. Ribellino went on to say, “Our council loves to help the local community and parish. “We are always ready for put ‘Faith in Action’ and assist those in need.”\n\nGrand Knight Anthony Armentano praised his brothers for their efforts. “I am so proud and thankful of my Brother Knights for always answering the challenge by helping those in need. They never back down from a challenge big or small.”\n\nThe council uses the various talents of the members to take on large cleaning, repair and landscaping projects including remodeling a chapel, painting of rooms at Malta House and the mulching/landscaping projects at the local Catholic schools and Notre Dame Health and Rehab Center. The Council has done major projects in the past such as painting all of the classrooms and hallways at Regina Pacis Academy in Norwalk and the renovation of the chapel at the Notre Dame Health and Rehabilitation Center Convent Chapel.\n\n“If we can provide labor to help save on costs, we are honored to do it,” said Ribellino. The Council always tells the schools to reach out if they need help at any time.\n\n“It’s what Knights do, ‘Leave No Neighbor Behind.’ It was a great way to honor our founder Blessed Michael McGivney who’s feast day was on August 13,” said Armentano.\n\nThe goal of the Knights of Columbus Council at St. Matthew Church in Norwalk is to perform acts of charity, providing those in need with a range of support from financial to tactical help in dealing with a wide variety of challenges.\n\n(For more information, visit kofc14360.net)\n\nNEWTOWN—The 2020/21 first-grade class at St. Rose School in Newtown recently released a book called Ducky1V, First Grade Memories!\n\nEach child in the class chose a favorite memory and wrote about it with an illustration. All of these memories were bound together in a book that first-grade teacher Mrs. Jeanne Vitetta delivered to school for pick up late last week.\n\nThe children and parents are so delighted with the final product. It was a creative way to work on many skills such as writing, grammar, art and memory.\n\nMrs. Vitetta loves ducks, hence her class is called Ducky 1V!\n\nAbout St. Rose School\n\nSt. Rose of Lima Catholic School is a Christ-centered community committed to academic excellence in an atmosphere that nurtures the spiritual, intellectual, emotional, physical and moral development of each child.\n\nThe dedicated staff partners with families to prepare students to be responsible leaders in a global society by fostering integrity, service and respect.

Students attend weekly Mass and we are blessed by the continual presence of Monsignor Robert Weiss and the other parish priests.\n\n(For more information visit: www.stroseschool.com)\n\nYesterday (August 4) the following letter was issued to parents from Superintendent Steven Cheeseman concerning the upcoming school year, 2021-22.\n\nDownload the PDF version of the letter or read below.\n\n—\n\nDear Parents,\n\nI hope this letter finds each of you enjoying some relaxation during these warm and humid summer days. My letter today is a follow-up on my earlier message that indicated our desire to return to a near normal school year which included being mask optional.\n\nWhile I am not ready to retract any of my earlier statements, I cannot remain oblivious to the latest trends and the uptick in positive Covid-19 cases. We most likely will be riding a roller coaster as new variants of the Covid-19 virus come and go. We must carefully monitor these trends and respond appropriately to the resulting ebb and flow created by these variant cycles.\n\nMy office has been inundated with e-mails and calls from concerned parents voicing their opinion on the masking issue. In these communications, there is a clear sense that a return to normalcy for their children is the goal for the school year.\n\nThis is certainly an issue that can be viewed from several sides. We are a system of 25 schools and about 7,000 students across Fairfield County and the facts around vaccination rates or virus infectivity rates are different in various parts of the Diocese. This makes supporting a “one size fits all” decision a difficult one.\n\nSome facts are very positive:\n\nNearly 90% of our Diocesan teachers and staff are fully vaccinated.\n\nThere is an over 70% vaccination rate in Fairfield County among those eligible to receive it and more 12-15 year olds are receiving the vaccine daily.\n\nThere is limited transmission among young people and those infected have mild symptoms.\n\nWe are awaiting more concrete information from the State as to what might be “mandated” for all schools in September and beyond. In the meantime, I am offering the following recommended guidelines to schools as they prepare for their opening:\n\nSchool-wide Masses and assemblies should resume\n\nAll extracurricular activities, including athletics should resume\n\nComputer labs, libraries, and Innovation zones should reopen\n\nQuarantines should be limited to the unvaccinated who were in close proximity to the Covid-19 positive person\n\nWater fountains can be used for bottle filling\n\nMinimum 3 feet of physical distancing is required indoors for all classrooms and activities\n\nDaily wellness checks, which can include temperature checks should continue\n\nFrequent handwashing reminders for students should continue\n\nDisinfection and cleaning of high-touch/high traffic areas should continue\n\nThose eligible for vaccination should be encouraged to receive it\n\nRequired mask use when distancing is not possible,\n\nSpecifically, masks must be worn:\n\nTo and from school on the bus\n\nIn the hallways\n\nIn large group settings where distancing is not possible, i.e. Mass, Auditorium\n\nBy all visitors to the school building\n\nIn close contact in the classroom, i.e. Science lab partners, small group learning\n\nMasks may be optional:\n\nOutside\n\nIn the classroom once students are seated and spaced appropriately\n\nIt is important to note that Principals may need to tailor these recommendations to fit the realities of their school and township (i.e., a classmate has a compromising health issue, the town has low vaccination rates or the town has high rates of infectivity, etc.) There may be a need to revisit these recommendations based on trends or State public health mandates.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I will continue to monitor the data and communication from the CDC, and the State Public Health Agency. I will communicate any updates when necessary.\n\nLet us hope that these weeks are filled with good health and safety. Let us all be vigilant so that our young people, particularly those under 12 who at present are not protected by vaccines, can return to school with all the joy and enthusiasm that a new year brings.\n\nMay God bless each of you and may Our Lady shower her blessings on our Catholic school community.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Steven F. Cheeseman\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nDiocese of Bridgeport"
