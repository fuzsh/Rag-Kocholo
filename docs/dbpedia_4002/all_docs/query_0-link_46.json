        "text": "I have played soccer since I was in pre-school on varying teams in both California and NY. In 8th grade, I started playing for JDHS on the JV team as starting Goalie and in 9th grade, I was a starting defender. In 10th grade, I was pulled up to Varsity and played defense and midfield. This year I was starting outside defender. I have participated on many other club teams over the years and have played all positions at one time or another.\n\nIn addition to soccer, I am an actress and dancer. I have been in many community theatre plays, including Midsummer Night's Dream and the Hobbit. I also danced competitively (Jazz, Contemporary, Hip Hop, etc) from age 12 until this year. I am a member of the JD High School Cheer Team during winter season.\n\nI am interested in getting an undergraduate degree in Chemistry and then pursuing a law degree for a possible career as a patent lawer. I am President of the JD High School Mock Trial team and this year I was the lead lawyer. I have been on student council and volunteered at my schools Freshman Orientation and 8th Grade Information Days. Some other undergraduate majors that interest me are Chemical Engineering and Media Studies.\n\nMy gpa is a 4.42 and I have taken numerous Honors, AP, and SUPA (duel-credit ) classes.\n\nI am really looking forward to playing soccer in college!\n\nFollow me on Instagram @curlpowerz.
