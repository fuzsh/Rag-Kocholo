How can one truly measure one's ability but by competing against the very best?\"\n\nEvery December, Germantown Academy hosts the annual Make A Wish Basketball Showcase. All proceeds from the tournament benefit the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Make-A-Wish creates life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. The Make-A-Wish Foundation seeks to bring every eligible child's wish to life because a wish is an integral part of a child's treatment journey. Research shows children who have wishes granted can build the physical and emotional strength they need to fight their illness. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, Make-A-Wish is the world’s leading children’s wish-granting organization, serving children in every community in the United States and in more than 50 countries worldwide. Together, generous donors, supporters, staff and more than 39,000 volunteers across the U.S., grant a wish every 34 minutes, on average, somewhere in the country. Since 1986, Make-A-Wish Philadelphia, Delaware and Susquehanna Valley has fulfilled more than 6,800 transformational wishes for local children with critical illnesses.\n\nThe Make A Wish Basketball Showcase is the brainchild of former Varsity Boys Basketball Head Coach Jim Fenerty 1760. Coach Fenerty wanted his players, blessed with both athletic gifts and academic opportunities, to have a sense that not everyone is lucky enough to share their good fortune. He selected the Make-A-Wish Foundation as an exemplary organization and his players embraced the concept of helping to make wishes come true for local kids who have been dealt a difficult hand. He then enlisted other high school teams to join the tournament and asked former the Upper School Community Service Organization to organize the logistics."
