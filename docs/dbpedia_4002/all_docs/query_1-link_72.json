The week includes an opening mass, classroom presentations, after school activities, and a day of prayer and Eucharistic Adoration. Parents, grandparents, and alumni are invited to join us for prayer for vocations in our high schools. Contact the school for exact times and details. The Catholic high schools of the diocese are:\n\nVocation Team School Associates have been assigned to every Catholic Jr./Sr. High School as well as to every Catholic Elementary School. Each year, an updated version of the list of contacts for the Vocation School Associates and their assigned schools is published and sent directly to the Catholic school administrators throughout the diocese. The school admins or their campus ministers are then encouraged to reach out directly to the Vocation School Associate and schedule their annual visits. Vocation School Associate assigned to our High Schools are asked by the Bishop to celebrate at least one Mass for Vocations for the entire student body after which the School Associates need to make a week-long visit to all grades in the school. Oftentimes, the School Associates can follow the religion class schedule for the week and effectively reach all grades by teaching during religious class for each grade. Vocation School Associates assigned to Elementary Schools are asked to make at least a day-long visit whereby each grade is visited; 15 minutes for grades k-3 and 30 minutes for grades 4-6. Please reach out to Father Hage at JHage@syrdio.org directly with any clarifying questions about how to best incorporate your Vocation School Associate into your curriculum.\n\nElementary and Middle Schools\n\nThe diocese have shorter programs at different times throughout the year. The classroom visits include age appropriate stories, activities, as well as question and answer sessions. These programs also encourage our children to seek the will of God in their lives. The hope of the schools program is for the conversation about vocations to continue at home. When your child returns from school after a vocations day visit, be sure to ask about the day. Please visit our Prayer Tools page for ideas for nurturing vocations in the home.\n\n\n\nBishop Grimes,\n\nSyracuse\n\n\n\nNotre Dame,\n\nUtica\n\nSchool Associate:\n\nRev.
