        "text": "Catholic school, coeducational school in East Syracuse, , New York, United States\n\nBishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School is a private, Roman Catholic high school in East Syracuse, New York. It is located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse. This school has more than 350 students in grades seven through twelve.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School was established in 1966. It is named after the second bishop of Syracuse, John Grimes.[4] The school has had students from almost every public school district in Onondaga County. Plus, they have had kids of each Catholic parish in the Diocese of Syracuse. In 2005, they were in the Top 50 Catholic High Schools in the USA based on academics by the Cardinal Newman Society.[5]\n\nAcademics and student life\n\n[edit]\n\nBishop Grimes has an on-site chapel, monthly Masses, Theology classes, including retreats for each grade. They have 43 JV, modified, and varsity sports teams and two gymnasiums including a field that they can practice on. They offer the opportunity to take either Spanish or French, plus, they can go on tours abroad. They also provide the opportunity to take a band class, a chorus class, and/or drama. The school cooperates with Le Moyne College and offers Advanced Placement Courses. This means that people with high grades on their PSATs can take Le Moyne classes at only a fraction of the price. To assist those with special needs, they have a teacher who is a full-time IEP and a 504-Plan instructor. Financial aid and scholarships are ready with the proper documentation. The Class of 2020 received over $5,000,000 in scholarships, including financial awards. All students that come to Bishop Grimes get a congratulatory iPad for enrolling in the school starting in September 2021. They historically had Chromebooks for quite a few years until 2021.[6]\n\nGraduation requirements\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to graduate, students need four credits for Theology, four credits for ELA, four credits for Social Studies, four credits for Mathematics, four credits for Science, four credits for a foreign language (Spanish or French; Grimes historically had German and Latin until the 2014-2015 year), one credit for Art/Music, two credits for P.E, 0.5 credits for Health, and 0.5 credits for Electives. In total, students need at least 36 credits to graduate. Students may take honors classes starting in the 8th Grade.[7]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2013–14 school year, the school had an enrollment of 353 students and 28.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.3:1. The school's enrollment was 85.3% White, 10.2% Black, 1.1% Hispanic, 2.6% Asian and 0.9% American Indian / Alaska Native.[2]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nBob Antonacci, politician and judge\n\nBobcat Goldthwait, actor, comedian, director, and screenwriter\n\nTom Kenny, actor and comedian\n\nChloe Webb, actress"
