        "text": "The New York City penthouse that once belonged to Arthur Rankin Jr., the creative genius behind the beloved Rankin/Bass Productions, is now up for grabs at $3.85 million.\n\nThis luxurious duplex penthouse at 24 W. 55th St. is more than just a piece of property — it’s a portal to a world of cherished holiday classics and animated adventures.\n\nRankin, a visionary who wore many hats as a producer, director, screenwriter and animator, is best known for pioneering the art of “Animagic” — or stop-action animation.\n\nHis legacy is etched in the hearts of millions, especially during the holiday season.\n\nRankin/Bass Productions gave us timeless treasures like “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” which has graced our TV screens every holiday season since 1964, making it the longest-running Christmas TV special in the country. And who can forget “Frosty the Snowman,” another Yuletide classic that’s warmed our hearts since 1969?\n\nBut Rankin’s creativity extended far beyond the holiday season.\n\nHe took on the monumental task of bringing J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Hobbit” to life in an animated version that earned a prestigious Peabody Award and captivated audiences when it first aired on NBC in 1977.\n\nBeyond that, Rankin/Bass Productions ventured into the world of “ThunderCats,” giving us a beloved 1980s cartoon that ran for a whopping 180 episodes from 1985 to 1989.\n\nIn 2014, Rankin passed away in Bermuda, where his famous puppets still dazzle visitors in local museums.\n\nToday, his New York City apartment, a place where creativity flourished, is being offered for sale by his widow and current resident, Olga Karlatos, a Greek actress with a notable filmography that includes an appearance alongside Prince in “Purple Rain” as his on-screen mother.\n\nRankin purchased this duplex penthouse in 1977, situated atop a circa 1936 building.\n\nThe two-bedroom, two-bath home boasts two sprawling private terraces, offering panoramic views of the cityscape to the east, west, and north.\n\nWith a curved wall of windows in the living room and 10-foot ceilings, the penthouse exudes retro-glamour. The living and dining areas charm with a mirrored decorative fireplace, original chevron floors and a dramatic mirrored dry bar, complete with a Lucite bookcase.\n\nA grand Art Deco staircase leads to the upper level, where the primary suite enjoys its own terrace spanning the entire length of the apartment. Storage space abounds with a full wall of closets and an additional deep walk-in.\n\nThe kitchen has been thoughtfully renovated with quartz surfaces, custom Shaker-style cabinetry and stainless steel appliances.\n\nModern amenities include a new central air system and inset ceiling lighting throughout.\n\nAs an added bonus, the sale includes a separate studio apartment on the building’s second floor, perfect for use as a guest suite, a home office or staff quarters, the listing notes.\n\nCharlotte Van Doren of Corcoran has the listing."
