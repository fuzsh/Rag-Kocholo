A blue rectangle then appears like a door shutting and 2 circles appear separately on top of each other, one blue and the other light blue. The light blue and blue text \"A ranKin bass PRODUCTION\", each word stacked, appears next to the shapes. The logo itself is suppose to represent an abstract \"RB\", with the \"R\" formed up with the darker colored parts and the \"B\" made up of all the shapes.\n\nBylines:\n\n\"A Division of Tomorrow Entertainment\" (c.1971-1974)\n\nVideocraft copyright notice, e.g. \"Videocraft International Limited MCMLXX\"\n\nBylineless\n\nVariant: Some early appearances of this logo had the animation occurring without the tube outline and with the ending of the show's theme playing over it. This can usually be seen on The Little Drummer Boy and Frosty the Snowman.FX/SFX: Shapes form an abstract \"R\", and the text appearing.Music/Sounds: Same as the 1966 Videocraft International logo. Sometimes, it is silent, recent prints of Frosty the Snowman have it either with the film's closing theme or none, original prints and FHE releases have the music.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variant: There is a variant in which the bongos come in early.\n\nAvailability: Common, especially around the Christmas season. It appears on most of Rankin-Bass's Christmas output when aired by CBS, ABC Family (now Freeform), AMC and other channels, as well as on DVD and most VHS releases. Strangely enough, on one airing of The Little Drummer Boy, this logo was replaced with the \"Blues\" logo! It was plastered by the 1984 WBTV shield on the 2000 DVD of The Year Without a Santa Claus, but on the 2007 \"Deluxe Edition\" DVD, the logo is intact, while older FOX/ABC Family (now Freeform) airings plastered this logo with the 1990 WBTD and 1994 WBTV Domestic Pay TV logos due to split screen credits.Editor's Note: Simple, but decent for 1968. It's also a beloved and nostalgic logo by many, particularly during the Christmas season.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(September 11, 1971-September 1, 1973)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"190\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/4cef1250671b4ab32337a5e193575bad35f70dd4\" width=\"334\"></iframe>\n\nLogo: Superimposed over the Motown logo are the words \"Rankin/Bass\" in a script font superimposed onto it with the text \"IN ASSOCIATION WITH\".\n\nFX/SFX: The fade in.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Same as the 1971 Motown Productions logo.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. It was only seen on The Jackson 5ive.\n\nEditor's Note: TBA.\n\n3rd Logo(December 19, 1975-July 5, 1987)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"161\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/d96d8ef4835223366bff10b027fc743a93166c87\" width=\"282\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"162\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/88ca07a109cecbc9e1ff5da43a339a1edb3e9b34\" width=\"291\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"161\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/0aba339907775780fe21631b40b36e42f015f05e\" width=\"283\"></iframe>\n\nNickname: \"The Blues\"Logo: The screen flashes three different shades of blue, with the effect that they're getting sucked inwards, into a rectangle at the left of the screen. Every time they go through a shade, that's the color the rectangle is until all three have been done and the screen is white. Then the circles appear to complete the stylized \"R-B,\" except instead of just appearing, layers of the circles zoom in until they fill the outlineâ€“they sort of \"grow\" in their places. To the right of the logo appear the words \"A ranKin bass PRODUCTION\" as usual. It looks like the first logo without the TV monitor.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn earlier prints of The Hobbit, it's silent and the background is carrot orange, while on Nestor the Christmas Donkey, the music is sped-up and the background is orange-yellow (though both of these could be from film deterioration). On the Xenon VHS release and 2014 Remastered WB DVD of the former, the music is intact and the background is brighter with a slight pink tinge.\n\nOn Leprechaun's Christmas Gold, the logo is in a shade of green.\n\nOn The First Easter Rabbit, the logo is far more deteriorated than the one on The Hobbit. This variant has a dark brown background, and the text and shapes are hardly legible.\n\nOn certain airings of Rankin-Bass specials, the logo fades out after the animation is finished to make way for either the \\\\' \"Distributed By\" logo, or the WBTV \"75 Years\" logo.\n\nFX/SFX: The blues are \"sucked\" in, the circles zoom into place, and the text appearing.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Same as the previous logo, but in a slightly lower tone. In later years, the theme was re-arranged to a majestic orchestral version.\n\nMusic/Sound Variants:\n\nOn the 1983 TV special The Coneheads, the jingle was mixed with the drum roll and end chime of the Telepictures logo that followed.\n\nOn the WB DVD release of The First Easter Rabbit, the film deteriorated variant uses the fanfare from the 1986 Lorimar-Telepictures logo! This is likely another case of the sloppy reverse plaster syndrome.\n\nAvailability: Common. Retained on most Rankin-Bass holiday specials from this period on DVD releases and reruns on Freeform and AMC. The Warner Bros. variant appeared preserved in credits pushback on Freeform airings of Rudolph's Shiny New Year and Nestor the Christmas Donkey during the 24 Days of Christmas Marathon. The last special with this logo was The Wind in the Willows in 1987.Editor's Note: While still fairly simple, it's a bit more advanced than before. Another memorable logo during the Christmas season, though it isn't as notable as the 1st logo.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRankin-Bass Animated Entertainment\n\n1st Logo\n\n(January 23, 1985)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"205\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/589190f5b9c8c2db243565083b6f156193a36fb2\" width=\"272\"></iframe>\n\nNickname: \"The Jazz Blues\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, the 1975 logo plays, without the \"A\" and \"PRODUCTION\" above and below the now-white \"ranKin bass\" word, respectively. The word \"animated\" in a script like font flashes and appears. The words \"Entertainment from\" then appears. We then cut to a sped-up version of the Telepictures \"Linecoaster\" logo.\n\nFX/SFX: Same as the 1975 logo, sans the flashing of the text.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A jazzy drum break is heard, followed by an abridged version of Cheetara's leitmotif (a triumphant horn fanfare, with a funk flare to it). When the Telepictures logo appears, we hear an abridged version of the drum roll and a ding from the said logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variant: On one print of S4EP5 of ThunderCats, this had the music from the next logo with the Lorimar-Telepictures \"Crashing Comets\" logo in a high pitch (likely due to NTSC to PAL conversion).\n\nAvailability: This was a prototype/placeholder logo, and only appeared on the broadcast pilot for ThunderCats (Exodus and The Unholy Alliance). It was then plastered by the next logo when repeated on the show's fall premiere on that same year. Strangely, this logo survived on the PAL DVD prints of the show, plastering the next logo on all the episodes.\n\nEditor's Note: A cool and lively, but wasted logo that takes advantage of the \"Blues\" animation to good effect.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(September 9, 1985-December 5, 1989)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/d52db29f6e59b989f10ee9cedcf22e48c8c0d536\" width=\"225\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/72becbe61427870975eb53af6dd75e19c024c89d\" width=\"225\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/72ca71a271a6712644a4cb724299ee7ba30bea56\" width=\"225\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"'80s RB\", \"3D-RB\"\n\nLogo: We see the classic Rankin-Bass logo, except made completely three-dimensional, with the text in royal blue, in the corporate font of then-current parent company Telepictures. A white line forms under the logo, and that line \"springs\" into a cursive \"Animated Entertainment\". Then, the \"R-B\" zooms up, and the shapes slide apart as they come closer to the screen, revealing a white \"from\". As the \"O\" overtakes the screen, we see the animation of either Telepictures (1985-86) or Lorimar-Telepictures (1986-89), which eventually fills the entire screen.\n\nVariants:\n\nA shortened version exists that ends after the company name forming. This was due to the 1984 WBTD logo plastering the Telepictures logo. This was spotted on a later Russian print of ThunderCats S1 episode \"Return to Thundera\".\n\nAnother shortened version exists in which the logo fades out just as the \"R-B\" begins to zoom up. This was due to the 2003 WBTVD logo plastering the Telepictures logo. This was spotted on AMC's prints of the special The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus.\n\nFX/SFX: The text appears like a spring.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A bouncy, synthesized oboe theme (composed by Bernard Hoffer). On the first season of ThunderCats, the music segues into a custom fanfare for the Telepictures logo (also by Hoffer) and from 1986 onward, it segues into the end of the Lorimar-Telepictures theme when the logo appears.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nA low tone variant exists.\n\nOn a post-1989 Russian print of ThunderCats S1 episode \"Return to Thundera\", the logo is silent.\n\nAvailability: Appears on 1980s Rankin-Bass productions, including ThunderCats and SilverHawks. It also appeared on some '80s prints of older R-B specials, typically plastering the older logos. Editor's Note: A departure from the '60s-era animation of the previous logos. It is a definite improvement, and likely a favorite of those who remember watching ThunderCats and SilverHawks.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(December 17, 2001)\n\nNickname: \"The Flipping 3-D RB\"Logo: Same as the last logo, except the logo is thinner, and flips horizontally in the start.\n\nFX/SFX: The logo flips, and the text appears like a spring like the previous logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Just the end title theme playing over the logo.\n\nAvailability: Seen on the animated cartoon Santa Baby, the last film from Rankin-Bass before their closure."
