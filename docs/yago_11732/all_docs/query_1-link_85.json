        "text": "You may be familiar with the Island of Misfit Toys, Yukon Cornelius and Hermey the Elf, who worked making toys for Santa Claus but longed to be a dentist.\n\nBut, you may not be familiar with the Ulster County man who wrote the story for “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” the classic animated holiday television program that featured these characters; themes of diversity, inclusion and acceptance; and so much more.\n\n“Rudolph” was among the numerous holiday stories that the late Romeo Muller Jr. wrote for Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass. The pair of producers and directors used Muller’s tales — written in his home, which straddled the boarder between High Falls and the Town of Rochester — to craft timeless, animated television programs.\n\nGRATEFUL DEAD: Memorabilia auction features High Falls artist\n\nSINTERKLAAS: Rhinebeck tradition ushers in holiday season\n\nHOLIDAY HELPING HAND: Journal, United Way collaboratrion raises $1.3 million\n\nMuller was once a struggling playwright and actor, with a love of slapstick comedy.\n\nBut with their iconic stop-motion animation, “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” and “Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town” were among the television programs that established Muller’s stories as holiday touchstones with nearly as much yuletide meaning as tinsel and holly.\n\nAnd, while the Hudson Valley's influence is evident in his work, his own influence was evident in the area he called home, through hosting community events around the holidays and visits to local schools.\n\n“The whimsical stuff that makes these shows so fantastic, that was him,” said Bill Merchant of the High Falls-based D&H Canal Historical Society, Inc., which hosted Muller exhibits in 2015 and 2016. “If he didn’t write these shows, we wouldn’t be watching them.\n\nYou can watch “Rudolph,” or watch it again, at 8 p.m. Saturday when it is shown on CBS. “Frosty the Snowman,” the story for which Muller also wrote, is scheduled to follow at 9 p.m.\n\n\"I think it's super cool that it's so close to home for us,\" Sophia Spagnoli, 24, of Rhinebeck, said.\n\nMuller’s characters — Rudolph, Kris Kringle and the Burgermeister Meisterburger among them — help anchor the region’s historic arts legacy in the same way as the Hudson River School of Art and such iconic moments as the 1978 concert by The Police that drew four paying customers to The Chance in Poughkeepsie.\n\nHow much of an impact did the Hudson Valley leave on Muller?\n\nThe mountains inhabited by the abominable snow monster in “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” were inspired by the Catskills. That’s according to Rick Goldschmidt, who operates www.rankinbass.com and www.miserbros.com and is the author of multiple books on Rankin, Bass, and their television programs.\n\nAnd Muller seems to have left a big an impression on High Falls, the Marbletown hamlet nestled between Rosendale and Stone Ridge that served as his downtown.\n\nHe was known for dressing up as Santa Claus, participating in the annual High Falls tree lighting ceremony and handing out toys to children in the community. And Muller — who grew up as part of a conservative family on Long Island during the Great Depression — traveled to local schools to read his stories.\n\nMuller drove a red Cadillac convertible around High Falls and shared his extensive movie library with neighbors during free screenings, with popcorn, at the local firehouse.\n\nUlster County resident Krista Muller said her uncle loved the holidays and he loved sharing stories about growing up around the family dinner table.\n\nWhen Krista Muller was young, she and her uncle played a game together called “The Pie Guy.” They pretended that tossed pillows were tossed pies, like in a Laurel and Hardy film.\n\n“He was very sensitive,” said Krista Muller, 46, who grew up on Long Island; visited her uncle and grandfather in Ulster County as a child during the holidays; and later moved there. “He had a really big heart.”\n\nAnd she said Romeo Muller Jr. knew how to relate to children.\n\n“He remembered all the things in his childhood,\" said Krista Muller, whose favorite story written by her uncle was “Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey,” which was broadcast on television in 1977. \"In the Great Depression, things were bleak. He had to really use his imagination to entertain himself.”\n\nKrista Muller said her uncle did not boast of his achievements, nor did she tell classmates about her famous family.\n\n“When I was growing up, he kept his celebrity away from me,” she said. “In a way, I really loved the shows and yet there was a separation. I didn’t want to bother him or ask him.”\n\nDecades later, Muller’s celebrity draw endures.\n\nAccording to Nielsen data:\n\n► On Nov. 28, 53 years after its debut in 1964, an estimated 5.4 million U.S. households watched the television broadcast of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.”\n\nAlso, “Rudolph,” according to CBS, is the longest, continuously-running Christmas television special. In 2014, the U.S. Postal Service released four, limited-edition “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” stamps generated from still television frames.\n\n► On Nov. 24, an estimated 2.7 million U.S. households watched the television broadcast of “Frosty the Snowman.”\n\n► On that same night, an estimated 2.3 million U.S. households watched the television broadcast of “Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town.”\n\n“Frosty” debuted on television in 1969. “Santa Claus” debuted in 1970.\n\n“He had a formula of magic — heart and warmth always and making bad villains good,” Goldschmidt said.\n\nRomeo Muller Jr. was born in the Bronx in 1928 and raised on Long Island, according to www.rankinbass.com. At age 11, he became a puppeteer and presented his show at local schools. He later became a playwright and theatrical actor, director and producer.\n\nMuller wrote material for the legendary Jack Benny and was discovered by CBS founder William Paley, according to www.rankinbass.com. He was chosen to be a CBS staff writer for “Studio One,” which began on radio and shifted to television.\n\nIn 1963, Romeo met Rankin and Bass, who asked him to write a screenplay for their initial network television special, “Return To Oz,” which was broadcast on NBC's “The General Electric Fantasy Hour.”\n\nThat collaboration set the stage for “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” the first holiday television special that Muller wrote for Rankin and Bass, according to www.rankinbass.com.\n\nKrista Muller said her family’s links to Ulster County can be traced to Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz. Romeo Muller Jr.’s father, an oil executive, visited the resort often and loved the area so much that he retired in Ulster, moving to the High Falls property in 1952.\n\nA few years later, Muller's father invited his son to join him in Ulster County and set up a studio where he could write. Romeo Muller Jr. moved to Ulster County and remained there until his death on Dec. 30, 1992 — five days after Christmas.\n\nJohn W. Barry: jobarry@poughkeepsiejournal.com, 845-437-4822, Twitter: @JohnBarryPoJo\n\nTuning in:\n\n“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” will be shown at 8 p.m. on Saturday Dec. 9 on CBS.\n\n“Frosty the Snowman” is scheduled to be shown at 9 p.m. on Saturday Dec. 9 on CBS.\n\nDid you know:\n\nAccording to the Internet Movie Database, the reindeer Rudolph was created in 1939 for the Montgomery Ward department store, by employee Robert May, as part of an advertising campaign. The song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" was a seasonal standard written in 1939, then made popular by singer Gene Autry.\n\nIn 2016, according to Nielsen data:\n\nAt least one minute of holiday programming was viewed by more than 83 percent of television households.\n\nHoliday programming reached nearly 99 million homes and more than 214 million people\n\nHigh Falls is where:"
