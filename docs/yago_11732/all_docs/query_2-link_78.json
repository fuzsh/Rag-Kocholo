        "text": "The Hobbit is a 1977 animated musical television special created by Rankin/Bass, a studio known for their holiday specials, and animated by Topcraft, a precursor to Studio Ghibli. The film is an adaptation of the 1937 book of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien and was first broadcast on NBC in the United States on November 27, 1977.\n\nDirected and produced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin. Screenplay by Romeo Muller. Based on The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nBilbo Baggins\n\n[edit]\n\nDear me, no. We hobbits are plain, quiet folk. Adventures make one late for dinner.\n\nNo hat, no stick, no pipe, not even a pocket handkerchief. How can one survive?\n\nI am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I've lost my dwarves, my wizard and my way.\n\nTo Gandalf: As per your instructions, I am keeping this log of our journey through Mirkwood Forest. I shall make good use of it someday as a basis for my memoirs, which I intend to call: There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Holiday. The days are terrible, and the nights are impossible, for we are hungry and thirsty. The berries which grow here are hideous. Everything about these woods is unpleasant. One day, we decided someone should climb to the top of the tallest tree and have a look. I couldn't argue. My contract is vague on several points. There are moments which can change a person for all time. And I suddenly wondered if I would ever see my snug hobbit hole again. I wondered if I actually wanted to.\n\nNow, you are all free. I know the spiders' poisons have made you weak. But you must follow me. Quickly!\n\n[while smuggling the Dwarves in barrels] Oh, stop complaining! I never promised to burgle you first class accommodations.\n\nWe were fed, fattened, given supplies, and two weeks later found us nearing the end of our journey. And chances were it would be a very horrible end, indeed.\n\nYou think it's my job to go in first? I've already gotten you out of two messes not in the original bargain. And who will come with me?\n\n[in his mind] Now you're in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins. Why are you here? You've no use for dragon treasures. Feel the worm's heat, Mr. Baggins? A few more steps and you shall see the old dragon Smaug at last. You can still turn back, you know. But to go on, to take those steps, that would be the bravest of all moments. Whatever happens afterwards is nothing. Yes, here is where you fight your real battle, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. Do you go back?\n\nGandalf\n\n[edit]\n\n[first lines of the film; narrating] In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Many ages ago, when this ancient planet was not quite so ancient, long before men recorded his history, here was the time of Middle Earth, where men shared his days with elves, dwarves, wizards, goblins, dragons and... hobbits. In the lands of Middle Earth, in an area known as the Shire, there was a village named Hobbiton. There, in a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, nor a dry, bare, sandy hole. It was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\n\nI am Gandalf... and Gandalf means MEǃ\n\nAlways remember, Bilbo, when your heart wants lifting, think of pleasant things.\n\nDawn take you all, and be stone to you!\n\nMy dear Elrond, your hospitality is magnificent. The food, the vine, the stories, the music.\n\nYour story, Bilbo, has the ring of truth. Yes, it rings true. You need say no more.\n\nGollum\n\n[edit]\n\nBless us and splash us, my preciousǃ\n\nThief, thiefǃ Bagginsǃ We hates it, hates it foreverǃ\n\nThorin Oakenshield\n\n[edit]\n\nFriends, we are gathered here at the home of this most excellent hobbit. May the hair on his toes never fall outǃ\n\nOur lookout has found something.\n\nThe goblins are upon us! Save the ponies from the goblins!\n\nThorin, at your service. We did not mean to trespass. We were merely seeking shelter from the storm.\n\nIf these be our last moments, men, let us live them with honour.\n\nBard\n\n[edit]\n\n[to Thorin] I am Bard the guardsman. We are honored by your presence. Your grandfather lives in our songs and legends. What help we can offer will be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when the dragon Smaug is killed and your kingdom is regained.\n\n[as Smaug attacks Laketown] Black arrow! You've never failed me, and I've always recovered you. I had you from my father, and he from of old. If ever you came from the forges of the true King under the Mountain, go now and speed well!\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nGandalf: [as the Dwarves chant] There is a magic in that music.\n\nBilbo: And it moves through me.\n\nGandalf: You feel the love of beautiful things.\n\nBilbo: To go and see the great mountainsǃ To hear the pine trees and waterfallsǃ\n\nGandalf: To wear a sword instead of a walking stick.\n\nBilbo: Just once...\n\nThorin Oakenshield: Gandalf, dwarves, and Burglar Baggins...\n\nBilbo: What is this \"burglar\" business?\n\nGandalf the Gray: If you prefer, you can say \"expert treasure hunter\".\n\nBilbo: Well, yes, I do prefer that.\n\nThorin: We are met tonight in the house of our friend, this most excellent hobbit. May the hair on his toes never fall out.\n\nDwarves: Hear, hear!\n\nThorin: We shall soon start on our long journey. Our object is, I take it, well-known to us? All of us?\n\nBilbo: It is not well-known to me.\n\nThorin: Really? Then we must inform our burglar. We seek a treasure, that which is rightfully ours. Far off in the East, beyond the Misty Mountains and the dark Forest of Mirkwood, there you will find... Lonely Mountain. Long ago, this was the home of my people and was ruled by my grandfather: King Under the Mountain.\n\nGandalf: The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, while hammers fell like ringing bells, in places deep, where dark things sleep, in hollow halls beneath the fells. Goblets they carved there for themselves, and harps of gold, where no man delves. There lay they long, and many a song was sung unheard by man or elves. For ancient king and elvish lord, there many a gleaming golden hoard. They shaped and wrought, and light they caught, to hide in gems on hilt of sword. On silver necklaces they strung, the flowering stars, on crowns they hung. The dragon fire, in twisted wire, they meshed the light of moon and sun.\n\nThorin: Undoubtedly, all this wealth was what brought the dragon.\n\nGandalf: The pines were roaring on the height. The winds were moaning in the night. The fire was red, it flaming spread. The trees like torches blazed with light.\n\nThorin: And below us, in the valley, lay Dale. A town of mortal men.\n\nGandalf: The bells were ringing in the Dale. The men looked up with faces pale. The dragon's ire, more fierce than fire, laid low their towers and houses frail. The mountain smoked beneath the moon. The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom. They fled their hall, to dying fall, beneath his feet, beneath the moon.\n\nDwarves: [singing] We must away ere break of day, to seek the pale, enchanted gold.\n\nThorin: Curses to the dragon! Curses to Smaug! He killed our men and stole our gold!\n\nDwarves: Curses to the dragon Smaug!\n\nThorin: We'll keep these. Deucedly fine blades, considering they were made by trolls.\n\nGandalf: They don't seem like troll blades to me. Probably stolen. See these strange runes?\n\nBilbo: Whatever are runes?\n\nThorin: Ancient writing. Mine has them too. [to Gandalf] Can you make them out?\n\nGandalf: I am not familiar with these letters.\n\nThorin: Well, whoever made them, we've got them now. [to the Dwarves] Cover up the treasure, men. We'll fetch it on our return.\n\nBilbo: [slashing a sword around at the air] Take that, Smaug! You filthy worm!\n\nGandalf: I see you've also claimed a sword.\n\nBilbo: Yes. Just a dagger, actually. But for one of my size, it suffices.\n\nThorin: Hurry, men! We must be on our way.\n\nGandalf: Hold.\n\nThorin: Hold?\n\nGandalf: It is time for you to have this.\n\nThorin: And what may that be?\n\nGandalf: This is a map of Lonely Mountain, presented to me 100 years ago by your father.\n\nThorin: What? Why did it not come to me, the rightful heir?\n\nGandalf: I've chosen my own time to hand it over.\n\nBilbo: Oh, I do love maps! I have quite a collection.\n\nThorin: I remember the mountain well enough without this.\n\nGandalf: [skeptically] Indeed. And how do you intend to enter Smaug's chambers? Through the main gate, as a houseguest? You'd be ashes before you took your seventh step.\n\nBilbo: Oh, see! Look! This hand points from these runes to... Bless my soul! A secret entrance! A hidden passage to the lower halls!\n\nGandalf: Excellent, burglar!\n\nBilbo: I'm really quite good with maps.\n\nThorin: Let me see. [looks at the map] Yes, quite correct.\n\nBilbo: But has it remained a secret all these years?\n\nGandalf: It's too small for Smaug to use. It's covered by a door made to look exactly like the side of the mountain. [gives Thorin a key] Here is the key. Keep it safe.\n\nThorin: Of course I will.\n\nBilbo: But if the secret door is hidden, how do we find it? The map doesn't tell.\n\nGandalf: It does, and it doesn't.\n\nBilbo: Huh?\n\nGandalf: You will understand in time.\n\nGandalf: Behold, at last. Rivendell! The hidden valley of the elves, where Elrond dwells.\n\nBilbo: Simply enchanting.\n\nGandalf: But we must be on.\n\nBilbo: Pity. Elvish singing is not a thing to miss in June under the stars. But...\n\nGandalf: My dear Elrond, your hospitality is magnificent. The food, the vine, the stories, the music.\n\nThorin: Yes, but we've much to accomplish. You promised to have a look at these troll swords after our feast.\n\nElrond: Yes, yes, of course. The first of all, they're not troll-make. They must have been stolen. They were made for the goblin-wars. This sword, Thorin, the runes name Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.\n\nGandalf: And mine?\n\nElrond: Glamdring, the Foe-hammer. Keep them well.\n\nThorin: I will keep this in honour.\n\nElrond: Now show me your map.\n\nBilbo: I have it here. [gives Elrond the map]\n\nElrond: Something's strange. Let's see. Yes, indeed! There are moon-letters here! See?\n\nBilbo: What are moon-letters?\n\nElrond: Runes that can only be seen when the moon shines behind them. They give directions for finding the secret door. \"Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the last light of the setting sun will shine upon the keyhole.\"\n\nGreat Goblin: Who are these miserable persons?\n\nThorin: Thorin, at your service. We did not mean to trespass. We were merely seeking shelter from the storm.\n\nGoblin: He is a liar, O Truly Tremendous One. Ask him to explain his weapon! [draws Thorin's sword and holds it up] This sword is named Orcrist, the Goblin Cleaver!\n\nGreat Goblin: [enraged] Murderers! Elf friends!\n\nGandalf: STOP!\n\n[the torches in the goblin throne room are extinguished; Gandalf appears, holding up a sword shining with blue light]\n\nGreat Goblin: [terrified] I know that sword! It is called Glamdring, the Foe Hammer! NOOOO!!\n\n[Gandalf runs him through]\n\nBilbo: It's Gandalf! Good old Gandalf!\n\nGandalf: Follow me! Quickly! Through here! Follow me!\n\nBilbo: Perhaps you know the way out?\n\nGollum: Yes, gollum. But perhaps we sits here and chats with it a bitsy, my precious. It likes riddles?\n\nBilbo: Do I like riddles? Well, yes, after a fashion.\n\nGollum: It must have a competition with us. If precious asks and it doesn't answer... we eats it, my preciousǃ\n\nBilbo: Oh, I sayǃ\n\nGollum: But if it asks, and we doesn't answer, we shows it the way outǃ\n\nBilbo: [glum] It appears I have no choice.\n\nGollum: My precious... we makes the first riddle. Voiceless, it cries. Wingless, flutters. Toothless, bites. Mouthless, mutters. Can it... guess... the answer?\n\nBilbo: Half a moment.\n\nGollum: Is it nice, my precious? Is it juicy? Gooey? Yucky? Is it scrumptious?\n\nBilbo: If you please! [pause] Wind! Wind is the answer. Now, my turn. A box without hinges, key or lid. Yet golden treasure inside is hid.\n\nGollum: Let us give us a chance, my precious. [pause] Eggs! Eggs, it is!\n\nBilbo: Oh, bother!\n\nGollum: Us now! Now us, my precious.\n\nBilbo: [sarcastically] I'm a-quiver with anticipation.\n\nGollum: Now... This thing, all things devours. Birds, beasts, trees, flowers. Gnaws iron, bites steel. Grinds hard stones to meal. Slays king, ruins town, and beats high mountain... downǃ\n\nBilbo: Well, interesting. Yes, now, let me see.\n\nGollum: What does it answer? What does it answer?\n\nBilbo: Just a moment now!\n\nGollum: My precious... will it taste delicious? It will!\n\nBilbo: Give me some time.\n\nGollum: What? What does it say?\n\nBilbo: I said time! Time! [Gollum growls in disappointment] Whatever is the matter?\n\nGollum: It guesses! Time is the answer!\n\nBilbo: [surprised] It is? [with fake confidence] I knew it all along. That's an old one. Well, fun's fun. Now, couldn't we get out of here?\n\nGollum: It's got to ask us another riddle, my precious!\n\nBilbo: Blast, I can't think of another one.\n\nGollum: Ask! Ask!\n\nBilbo: Oh, very well. [pause] What have I got in my pocket?\n\nGollum: Not fair! Not fair to ask my precious what it's got in its nasty... little... pocketses!\n\nBilbo: I'm sorry. That's my riddle. And if you can't guess it, you lose and show me out!\n\nGollum: [wails] My precious loses! [sly] But first... my precious shows it... something pretty.\n\nBilbo: You wish to show me something?\n\nGollum: My birthday present.\n\nBilbo Wait! Where are you going?\n\nGollum: [to himself] My precious finds a ring... on his birthday... long ago. A golden ring. A magic ring! We must get my precious' birthday present from its hiding place.\n\nBilbo: You see, Gollum thought I knew the way out, and wished trying to head me off. I merely followed him to the exit.\n\nThorin: We had to fight our way through the goblin guard. How is it they didn't see you?\n\nBilbo: Oh, well, the art of burgling is really, you know, the art of being unobtrusive. Invisible, sort of speak.\n\nGandalf: Your story, Bilbo, has the ring of truth. Yes, it rings true. You need say no more. We best get a move on. There are still goblins about.\n\nBilbo: Oh bother. More mountains?\n\nGandalf: No. Don't you see? [points to the distance with his staff] The sun is setting in the west, behind the mountains. We're on the other side to the edge of the Land Beyond.\n\nSmaug: Well, thief... I smell you, feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along. Help yourself. There's plenty, and to spare.\n\nBilbo: Thank you, oh, Smaug the Magnificent. I did not come for presents. I only wish to have a look at you... and see if you are truly as great as tales say. I did not believe them.\n\nSmaug: Do you now?\n\nBilbo: They fall utterly short of reality, O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities!\n\nSmaug: You have nice manners, for a thief... and a liar. You know me, but I don't remember smelling you before. Who are you and where do you come from?\n\nBilbo: I come from under the hill. And under the hill and over the hills my paths led. And through the air. I am he that walks unseen.\n\nSmaug: You make riddles? What is your name?\n\nBilbo: I am the lucky number, the web-cutter, the spider-stinger...\n\nSmaug: Lovely titles.\n\nBilbo: I am he that drowns his friends and draws them alive again from the water. I am the guest of eagles, the ring-winner and luck-wearer... ...the clue-finder and the barrel-rider.\n\nSmaug: Barrel-rider, eh? Then I have guessed your riddle! You are one of those miserable, tub-thumping Lake-men! You and your town shall pay dearly for this intrusion! So the Lake-men would steal my treasure?!\n\nBilbo: Wait! You don't know everything. Not gold alone brought me hither.\n\nSmaug: Be done with your riddles! What else brought you, Lake-man?\n\nBilbo: Revenge!\n\nSmaug: Revenge...?\n\nBilbo: Surely you realize that your success has made you some bitter enemies.\n\nSmaug: [laughs contemptuously] REVENGE? YOU? HA! I AM SMAUG! I kill what I wish! I am strong... strong... STRONG! My armor is like tenfold shields... my teeth are like swords... my claws, spears... the shock of my tail... a thunderbolt! My wings... a HURRICANE! And my breath... DEATH! Well? WELL?! Where are your riddles now?!\n\nBilbo: Very, very impressive. However... I have always understood that dragons... were soft underneath. Vulnerable. Especially in the region of the chest.\n\nSmaug: You have heard wrong! I am armored both above and below.\n\nBilbo: Well, I don't know about that.\n\nSmaug: You \"don't know about that.\" I shall show you! [rolls onto his back] Look! What do you say to this? Rare and wonderful, eh?\n\nBilbo: Dazzling! Marvelous! Perfect! Flawless! Staggering! Mag... [laughs] Old fool! There's a patch in the hollow of your left breast... as bare as a snail out of its shell.\n\nSmaug: What's that? More riddles?\n\nBilbo: No, my riddling is done. I really must not detain Your Magnificence any longer. Sorry you could not find me. But a fine burglar takes expert catching. [removes the ring]\n\nSmaug: Burglar?!\n\n[Smaug sees Bilbo holding up an ornate cup from Smaug's sea of treasure. He darts into a hallway, leaving Smaug raging behind him.]\n\nSmaug: BUUURRRRGLAAAAAARRRR!!!! THIEF! FIRE! MURDER!\n\nBilbo: [dressed in armor] This is deucedly uncomfortable. I'm certain to get a rash!\n\nThorin: That armor was forged in the foundaries of my grandfather. Wear it proudly, and it will carry you to victory!\n\nBilbo: Confusticate and be-bother victory! I hope only to be taken prisoner as quickly as possible!\n\nThorin: Those are the words of a coward!\n\nBilbo: The coward who flushed out Smaug? The coward who saved you time and time again? The coward who always went forward while you cringed behind?\n\nThorin: You don't see us cringing now, do you?\n\nBilbo: This is madness! Fourteen against ten thousand, and yet you march off to certain destruction as merrily as if you were on your way to another tea party!\n\nThorin: Your kind will never understand war, hobbit. This is war! Warǃ\n\nGandalf: [Bilbo and Gandalf enter Thorin's tent. Thorin lies dying] I have brought him.\n\nThorin: Farewell. good thief. I wish to part in friendship, and would take back my words at the gate.\n\nBilbo: There were many words I would take back, also.\n\nThorin: And does it take this to make us to see each other?\n\nBilbo: Thorin...\n\nThorin: Hush. You are no coward, my friend. I am sorry I so named you.\n\nBilbo: This is not important...\n\nThorin: I was wrong. You did understand war. It was I who did not... until now.\n\nBilbo: Farewell, King Under the Mountain.\n\nThorin: Child of the kindly West, I have come to know, if more of us valued your ways - food and cheer above hoarded gold - it would be a merrier world. But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell. [dies]\n\nBilbo Baggins: [tearfully] Farewell, Thorin.\n\nGandalf: You take only two tiny bags of gold home with you? Your share was greater.\n\nBilbo: It's all my pony could carry, and it's more than I'll ever need.\n\nGandalf: But you have other prizes.\n\nBilbo: The ring? Oh, yes. I'll keep it as a souvenir, in a glass box on the mantel.\n\nGandalf: And so, the prophecies of old have come true. Smaug is gone and the goblins driven away. The Dwarves and Elves live in peace, and the Men thrive, multiply and build a civilization.\n\nBilbo: Prophecies!\n\nGandalf: What?\n\nBilbo: I had a hand in all that!\n\nGandalf: Surely you don't disbelieve the prophecies because you helped bring them about? You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole benefit? You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I'm very fond of you. But you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world, after all.\n\nBilbo: Thank goodness!\n\nGandalf: Yes, you will return to your home. Place your souvenir ring on your mantel. Publish your story, which you believe has come to its end\n\nBilbo: What do you mean, believe has come to an end? It has, hasn't it?\n\nGandalf: Oh, Bilbo Baggins, if you really understood that ring, as someday members of your family not yet born will... then you'd realize that this story has not ended, but is only beginning.\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nThe Hobbit quotes at the Internet Movie Database"
