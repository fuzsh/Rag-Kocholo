        "text": "So I was reading up on the Rankin Bass Christmas Specials and I learned that a lot of the Rankin/Bass specials were animated in Japan. Some of them by Toei Animation and Mushi Productions.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankin/Bass_Productions#History\n\nThe company was founded in New York City by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass on September 14, 1960, as Videocraft International. The majority of Rankin/Bass's work, including all of their \"Animagic\" stop-motion productions (which they were well known for), were created in Tokyo, Japan. Throughout the 1960s, the Animagic productions were headed by Japanese stop-motion animator Tadahito Mochinaga at his studio, MOM Production. He was credited for his supervision as \"Tad Mochinaga\"\n\nAt that same time, Rankin/Bass's traditionally cel-animated works were done at Crawley Films in Canada, and later, the other Japanese animation studios: Toei Animation, TCJ (now Eiken) and Mushi Production. And from the 1970s to the early 1980s, the others were animated by another of Tokyo's animation studios, Topcraft, which was formed in 1971 (or 1972 in some cases) as an offshoot of Toei Animation. Many Topcraft staffers, including the studio's founder Toru Hara (who was credited as an animation supervisor in some of Rankin/Bass' specials), would go on to join its successor Studio Ghibli and work on Hayao Miyazaki's feature films, including Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind and My Neighbor Totoro.\n\nThought this was an interesting piece of history regarding these Christmas Specials.\n\nedit: Title should be \"Rankin Bass Christmas Specials and Japanese Animation\". Can a mod please edit?"
