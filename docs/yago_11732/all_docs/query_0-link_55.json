        "text": "Rankin/Bass Historian Rick Goldschmit remembers the production problems on The King and I 1998 (Warner Bros/ Rankin/Bass/ Morgan Creek/Richard Rich)\n\nWell what happened with that was I knew about that when I did my first book and Arthur was telling me that they were trying do it in a much bigger way than it ended up,\n\nWas umm I forget the name of the company that released it....... ummmmm but I remember Arthur had a meeting with Michael Eisner back then because Eisner was the Disney chairman\n\nand he had worked with Rankin/Bass on the Jackson Five Show and the osmounds because he was in charge of the saturday morning cartoons on ABC in the early 70's\n\nSo Arthur wanted to do it with Disney originally. and then Morgan Creek was the company that actually released it.\n\nand the Animation was done by a Japenesse almost the son of Arthur, sort of an adopted son: Masaki Iizuka\n\nand I when I went to Arthur's memoreal Masaki and I were talking about The King and I he said \"It didn't have the song, it didn't have the main song of King and I\" and he said \"it's not going to work!\n\nit just won't work!\"\n\nand he still dosn't know why, why they did it the way they did it. and it wasn't a success and I think Arthur was trying to do was still keep in the bussiness and still see things through, the way he aways did\n\nbut in this day in age, you don't go to a company and say \"I wanna make a movie\" and they give you the money and you do it, you have to go through all kinds of groups and focus group channels and all kinds of stuff\n\nSo by the time it finally comes out, it's not what you envision.\n\nhttp://fanboynation.com/toon-in-talk-episode-10-interview-with-rick-goldschmidt-and-john-brickley/\n\nEdited by user 6 years ago | Reason: Not specified\n\nhttp://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/animation-anecdotes-136/\n\nJim Korkis’ Animation Anecdotes # 136: The Tolkien Battle.\n\nLawyers representing Saul Zaentz’s Fantasy Films and Tolkien’s estate filed suit to prevent Rankin-Bass’ The Return of the King (1980) from being televised,\n\ncharging Rankin-Bass with copyright violations.\n\nAn angry Ralph Bakshi stated, “They’re (Rankin-Bass) not going to stop us from doing The Lord of the Rings and they won’t stop us from doing The Hobbit.\n\nAnyone who saw their version of The Hobbit know it has nothing to do with the quality and style of our feature.\n\nMy life isn’t going to be altered by what Rankin-Bass choses to do badly.”\n\nJules Bass replied, “I liked Bakshi’s version. There were some interesting and exciting sequences.\n\nBut I don’t see any problem or confusion with our doing The Return of the King. There were six versions of “A Christmas Carol’ on the air last December (1979).\n\nPeople take each on its own terms. If Bakshi does a sequel in two or three years, it will just be his version.” The suit went to court but was settled “amicably” although no specifics were released.\n\nRankin-Bass’ The Return of the King aired May 1980.\n\nOrson Bean was the voice of both Bilbo and Frodo Baggins with John Huston doing the voice of Gandalf\n\nExcerpt from an interview with Rick Goldschmidt\n\nRick Goldschmidt: \"the thing about that whole story too was umm Arthur told me (pause) uhh and we had a night at his honur at the museum of broadcast of television and radio in New York,\n\nI think it was at breakfeast the next day he told me was something about the whole Tolkien experiance, after a while Tolkien didn't want them to do the speical that he didn't (unitelligble aduio quips) anymore\n\nThere were some legal issiues that came from that too, there was also a point where they were in court over The Hobbit and being released in Canada, there were a lot of legal issiues with that\n\nthat resulted in and why they had to make The Return of The King the way they had made it. Because orginially it was going to be called The Hobbit 2.\n\nI'm not a huge umm hobbit fan or you know Tolkien fan. but when I watch them I think man, did they capture uuh a stlye and a look and a uneverse that is so different than Rudolph, Santa you Know.\n\nI give them kudos for really working to make something very uniqe and represent the books and they can do it.\"\n\npardon me, the poster art says Frodo The Hobbit II\n\nhttp://enchantedworldofrankinbass.blogspot.com/2012/04/rankinbass-return-of-king.html\n\nhere is the link to Rick's interview\n\nhttp://fanboynation.com/toon-in-talk-episode-10-interview-with-rick-goldschmidt-and-john-brickley/\n\nEdited by user 6 years ago | Reason: Not specified\n\nRankin/Bass and Toei's Mouse on the Mayflower (1968)\n\nAn out of circulation animated muiscal thanksgiving TV speical of elementry school history of the Mayflower,\n\nthe harvest festivial and Henry Wadsworth Long Fellow's Courtship of Miles Standish with mice and pirate sailors thrown in.\n\nDiscriptions of missing scenes from the Broadway Video \"common YouTube upload\" cut of Rankin/Bass Mouse on the Mayflower (1968)[/b]\n\nshot of Miles Standish assigning John Aldan to carry Pricilla Mullin's parcels to Mayflower's qwarters\n\nJohn Aldan being clumsy\n\nand the muscial number When She Looks at Me - John Gary (John Alden)\n\n(not on the 1989/1993 vhs of the Broadway Video syndicated cut)\n\nThe scene lead up to the commercial break pligrims start to leave the mayflower and the first glimpses of the indians was cut by Broadway Video.\n\nInstead a fake fade to commercial was done in the part after Whielm Mouse signs the Mayflower compact.\n\nTime, Stands Still - John Gary (John Alden) Joanie Sommers (Pricilla Mullins)\n\n(partialy cut in half on the 1989/1993 F.H.E. vhs of the Broadway Video syndicated cut)\n\nGood Times - Tennessee Ernie Ford and chorus\n\n(not on the 1989/1993 F.H.E. vhs of the Broadway Video syndicated cut)\n\nRankin/Bass logo (the Rankin/Bass logo has it's music on the Broadway Video vhs, while the Golden Books vhs the logo music is missing.)\n\nThe way to get the uncut version is the golden books 1998 vhs\n\nor Rick Goldschmidt's Rankin/Bass Archives DVD with 1972 McDonald's commercials.\n\nEdited by user 4 years ago | Reason: deleted a video comparison I made. and revised the deleted trims desciptions."
