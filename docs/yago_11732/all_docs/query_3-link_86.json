        "text": "The legendary Arthur Rankin Jr, the man behind some of the most cherished animated films of all time, passed away January 30, 2014 at age 89.\n\nRankin is one half of the famous Rankin/Bass production company, probably best known for their holiday specials such as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman.\n\nThe Tolkien and fantasy community as a whole has many facets to it, and we remember Arthur Rankin for the animated treasures he gave to us. These classics include The Last Unicorn, The Return of the King, and of course, the beloved 1977 animated musical based upon The Hobbit.\n\nArthur Rankin began his career in the early 1960s. Since then, his whimsical stop-motion and carefully animated feature films have been winning the hearts of children and adults all around the globe. His contributions to not only the film industry, but to the fantasy genre will endure for generations to come.\n\nHe will be missed."
