        "text": "Jules Bass and Paul Coker Jr. passed away this year, almost precisely two months apart. To get the average person to puzzle out who these men were, you might have to engage in a game of telephone. “Do you know the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer claymation special?” you might ask. “The one they air every year? Yeah, they made those.”\n\nAs an animation enthusiast, I might feel the itch to be pedantic about this strategy: “claymation” is not the most accurate term and they didn’t really “make” them, soup to nuts. But, more than those know-it-all impulses, I would be happy to see them recognized at all.\n\nIn increasingly ironic and detached times, it seems the American Christmas manages to remain a time of relentless kitsch. Tradition prompts us to return to the same things, year after year, in search of warmth and familiarity. Gaudy rainbow colored lights and synthy Paul McCartney party songs blasting over store speakers rule the day. Part of the magic of it all is the way in which the definition of traditional, as it does with everything else, seems to morph with every year that goes by. The culture of Christmas accomplishes this better than most. It seems unfathomable to imagine a December without Mariah Carey and that bouncy piano, but its reign only began a mere 28 years ago. Elf (2003) permanently altered our lingo — and gif libraries — and yet children born the day it was released are barely out of high school.\n\nTo be a Christmas classic is to achieve immortality, revisited year after year when our hearts are allegedly at their most tender. And yet, though a deluge of holiday movies and songs and books and miscellany trying to cash in on this all-too-profitable season, only few seem to achieve this endless life in the zeitgeist. Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass seemed to crack the code, over and over. Every year, alongside animated titans like Scrooge McDuck and The Grinch, a little figurine of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer captures our hearts and affections.\n\nIt’s hard to understand exactly how we got to this point in pop culture. Stop motion from the mid-twentieth century, without the clout and budget of a Disney-size studio behind it? It seems like a recipe for creepy, forgettable fodder for video essayists digging up the corpses of lost media. The answer seems to be that the special is just good — the songs are fun, the characters are memorable (and memeable) and I’m always down for an annual rousing debate about how Santa Claus is inexplicably a total dick in it. But lots of good specials have faded into obscurity over the years (I point feverishly to the likes of Olive the Other Reindeer). So how did the little, aggressively bullied Reindeer survive for over half a century?\n\nWhile I would struggle to give you a perfect, concrete answer, at least one factor would probably be repetition and habit. CBS and NBC’s insistence on broadcasting a small handful of the Rankin/Bass oeuvre — Rudolph, along with fellow song adaptations Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town (1970) and the traditionally animated Frosty the Snowman (1969) — granted them that much sought-after seasonal immortality. Their colleagues in the Rankin/Bass filmography, though? Obscurity city, I would argue. Plenty of people reading this might not even know about half of the films the studio made for Christmas alone, coming in at almost twenty works over less than as many years. Really, even if you’re a fellow enthusiast, how many people outside of your niche animation circles have seen any of the duo’s B-squad like Rudolph and Frosty’s Christmas in July, or even the somewhat jarringly serious The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus? Probably not many. This, to me, is a loss for us.\n\nA commonality in the Rankin/Bass back catalogue — at least in my eyes — seems to be that quality and quirkiness alike were not enough to salvage them from public memory. While there are some works like The Last Unicorn and the studio’s Tolkien adaptations that manage to stay alive through the passion of nerds who hold them dear, their widespread impact seems to pale next to the entries of juggernaut studios like Disney, or even Dreamworks. So it goes for their litany of Christmas specials, with only a sliver of the lot even getting consistent airplay in the modern holiday rotation. Catching something like ’Twas the Night Before Christmas nowadays will send you on a bit of a Yuletide treasure hunt.\n\nSo how did I even get to know them? Well, as I mentioned before, it wasn’t always this was. I had the “classic” specials (the three mentioned above that still air on major networks) on tape as a kid, which I subsequently wore out with re-watches regardless of the actual season. It was only through the mythical “25 Days of Christmas” annual block on ABC Family (now Freeform) that I discovered the rest. For twenty-five consecutive days, the evenings on the network were devoted all things holly and jolly — including some deep cuts straight from the Rankin/Bass resume I’d never known of before.\n\nI could never explain quite why, but something about them hooked me. There was Jack Frost, a sort of gender-swapped Little Mermaid where the titular season sprite was granted a wish to turn human to find love with a woman down on Earth. Are you a fan of Frosty the Snwoman? Well, you have to check out Frosty’s Winter Wonderland, a traditionally animated sequel where he marries his wife, Crystal. And then, for good measure, watch the entire hour and a half where the couple and their children team up with another classic for the crossover event of the season, Rudolph and Frosty’s Christmas in July. You could cry with Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey, get a little pious with The Little Drummer Boy. The backlog is huge. Nostalgia accounted for, I think that I would still be hard pressed to call any of them bad.\n\nThat being said, it’s a little hard to curb that nostalgia entirely to explain the appeal. Consider what we’re still working with here: stop-motion animation from the mid- to later twentieth century, produced with a much smaller budget than your average Disney blockbuster. It seems like it could still be ripe ground for a series of uncanny, unsettling fare useful for little else than cringing and memeification half a century down the line.\n\nAnd yet, for those who do remember, these films manage to retain goodwill in the collective consciousness of pop culture. And it seems, every year, a few new youths enter the fold. The little figurines are cute, cuddly, and endearing. Build-a-Bear has produced adorable plushes of Rudolph and his beau Clarice. You can decorate your lawn this December with an inflatable Frosty bearing Paul Coker’s iconic design work. If you search “Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town” on YouTube — a mainstay covered by Mariah, Springsteen and the Jackson 5 to name a few — the 1970 special beats out some of music’s very best stars in the results. It may beg the question: why, exactly? As a self-identified preacher of the gospel here, I want to take a little time to examine it all.\n\nRemember Paul Coker? I’ll be candid: I didn’t even know his name until after he’d passed on this summer. I knew his work, though, and you would clock it too if you’d ever spent time with one of the specials. His designs — warm and round and delightfully 70s in their sensibility — are, to me, a key component of what helps these little cartoons survive. The trademarks are there. Big, round eyes with wide, curved, almost catlike mouths. Moreover, there’s a strong stylistic consistency from the stop motion work to the traditional. Translating a two dimensional drawing into a three dimensional object, especially without top tech, has a good chance to flop. The Rankin/Bass figures are excellent, though — even when you can make out the fingerprints of the animators who have been carefully jostling them around for the cameras. They exude a lot of charm.\n\nIt becomes apparent pretty fast when watching these specials that the budget is not particularly high. The bulk of the duo’s filmography is sandwiched into the early ‘60s into the very beginning of the ‘80s. The pair — Rankin an art director and Bass a copywriter who met while working for ABC — cut their production company’s teeth with a television series. The New Adventures of Pinocchio was a stop motion affair based on the oft-adapted Italian classic as its source material (just this year saw a meme in which Pauly Shore’s, er, unique take on the character in a dub of a Russian adaptation went viral).\n\nThe series, now extremely difficult to find readily available and in high quality, boasted a not-particularly-notable cast of actors and animation that was demonstrably behind the speed and dexterity of contemporary stop motion classics like the works of LAIKA, Aardman or Henry Selick. Still, one quality stood tall — one that stayed across all of the company’s projects: it was incredibly charming. In what little footage is available online, the little Pinocchio figurine toddles about the screen uneasily, a choppy style of movement that easily sets the stage for the type of waddling and waggling we see the figurines do a few years later in Rudolph. It’s a far cry from the impossibly smooth movements seen in Selick’s Wendell & Wild this year, but somehow that makes it all the sweeter. Rankin/Bass did not manage this solely by their own wit — more on that later — but it set the stage.\n\nRudolph came a few years later, made for NBC and sponsored by General Electric. It originally aired in prototypical 1960s black and white. This seems almost sinful, given how sweet and candy-colored the full package is. Those color coordinated (and gender separated, hmm) elf outfits ought to be seen in all their glory!\n\nThere have been dozens of takes on this little, somewhat sadistic holiday classic, so why is this the go-to? The story follows the classic song, yes, but it’s the quirks that really make it one to be held fondly your memories. Okay, yeah, Rudolph is there and he’s being bullied. But Santa is in on the mess. There’s an elf who wants to practice dentistry. An eccentric prospector who detects gold by licking his pick joins in. He’s combating an abominable snowman — nay, a Bumble — who bounces when he hits the ground. It could be argued these things are pressed into our collective memory much more than the red nose. Because, I mean… how do you not think fondly on an elf who wants to do root canals? It’s inspired.\n\nThis unique sensibility is found throughout the oeuvre. The stories are fun, but it’s the details, the humor and wit, and the utter creativity that makes it all complete. The Year Without a Santa Claus is a 1974 production by the studio based on a quaint childrens’ book of the same name by Phyllis McGinley. It stars Mickey Rooney as Santa (a role he did not assume for Rudolph but a mantle he wears for the majority of R/B films) and dear Hazel herself, Shirley Booth, as a Mrs. Claus that is both a tad flighty and master of her domain. The main story concerns Santa taking ill and deciding that the world isn’t interested in Christmas, and as such will skip the whole chimney mess that year.\n\nThat’s the actual plot, though. What everyone remembers, however, is the dueling showtune war between Snow Miser and Heat Miser, brothers who are in control of the aforementioned elements and gaily sing about it with a brassy instrumental track and mini-me backup singers. Their designs command attention: Heat Miser with a sparkly elf getup and flaming head that actually glows as he speaks, Snow Miser in a straw hat and hair made of sheer ice. They are completely absent in the source material, cooked up by the R/B team and honestly not particularly important to the overall plot. And still, it’s the standout element of the whole thing. One could argue it’s bad always writing to focus so much real estate on negligible side characters. Here, it’s genius. It seals it into our culture.\n\nIt’s this creativity that makes the memories so big. A million Christmas specials have Santa Claus. Only one has Burgermeister Meisterburger, Topper the South Pole Penguin and the Winter Warlock. Rudolph is cute. But can we talk about Yukon Cornelius? This unique quality is more than just silly characters, of course. A single, silly line from Rudolph rose to meme icon status years ago with a phrase uttered by a character without a real name: WHY weren’t you at elf practice!? Golden phrases like that are never hard to come by in these features — which is part of the magic.\n\nIt’s not particularly hard to retell an already ubiquitous carol in a tidy forty minutes when seeking out Christmas special cash-ins. Many have tried, many have done. This doesn’t necessarily make them good, and a wealth of YouTube videos dissecting bargain bin holiday fare will prove as much. Allow me to put this into the most Online terms I can muster: just this past September, the internet was sent into a tizzy for days because someone could not locate the identity of an elf from a 1991 Canadian animated special. I imagine you would be hard pressed to see the same people scramble for even a fraction of the time to identify, say, Jingle and Jangle Bells.\n\nAnd yet, despite these many charms, the legacy seems like it’s starting to fizzle. Finding the specials, particularly the less well-known ones, has become something of a sport. Freeform seems to have quit the game a while ago, barring those three standards. AMC will carry a couple here and there. Though it seems with each passing year, they get put into increasingly unconventional time slots — with a few fans even lamenting it on social media. I can’t help but wonder if, decades after Rankin/Bass stopped making new material, that the deification of annual tradition hasn’t been enough to save the specials that don’t have Rudolph in them. I hope not.\n\nIf it’s hard to explain the magic of why they work, it is perhaps even harder to explain why most of the studio’s output doesn’t seem fit for an extended cultural survival. All I could hope to provide are theories. They’re products of their time, for one. Not in the sense that they’re especially insensitive — in fact, barring the admittedly glaring fact that their films are almost always cast entirely by white characters, the visuals and writing hold up pretty well on the whole from an ethical standpoint. They are, however, very much marked by a distinct aesthetic and tonal sensibility that seems to not thrive beyond the dome of the ’60s and ’70s. Think The Match Game and “Spirit in the Sky.” Great stuff, but also a bit of a time capsule.\n\nThe films were abundant in celebrity voices that were big draws in their day — Rooney and Booth as Santa and the missus, but so many more. Kenan Wynn (an underrated nepo baby if there ever was one) playing the Winter Warlock. Broadway legend Joel Grey as Joshua Trundle the clockmaker, Fred Astaire as a singing mailman, Red Skelton as Father Time. This is just to name a few choice examples. All stellar performances were delivered from the above starlets, but — at the risk of sounding like an old fogey — how many millenials and zoomers can put a face to these names? This doesn’t make them bad by any means. But it does make their resonance that much harder.\n\nThat’s just one theory, though. Another is the changing medium it comes from. It’s harder and harder for animation houses outside of Disney to hold steady culturally. As our media diet gets smaller, more bombastic, less substantial, contained between fewer and fewer brands and massive companies, modest productions from lesser studios fall to the wayside. They are visibly old, archaic, relics. Even wonderful things get lost to time. Sometimes, being good and being timeless and being unique aren’t enough.\n\nAnd I would be remiss in not mentioning that the legacy isn’t pristine, as few ever are. A significant portion, if not the vast bulk, of the Rankin/Bass animated backlog was built by the hands of outsourced Japanese animation labor. In fact, the studio was one of the first American production houses to do this — now common practice in the industry, utilizing labor from countries like India, Korea and the Philippines. The classics of the studio’s filmography owe a great debt to studios like Mushi Productions and Topcraft, to say the minimum. I couldn’t say what exactly the labor standards were for these particular productions, though. But in the interest of being fair, it probably shouldn’t be ignored that the studio did help pioneer the practice.\n\nIf you read the credits in the specials, you may notice Japanese names such as Masaki Iizuka, Akikazu Kono and Tadahito Mochinaga — credited often as “Tad.” The names of artists who helped do some of the hardest parts of the animation process to make these specials happen in the first place. Viewers in 1970s America probably weren’t too keyed into this, either. As bad as it is that these works seem to be slipping away into the annals of time, it seems even worse that this aspect be forgotten twice over. To this day, the animation industry as a whole struggles to give its artists their dues. This is especially so for creators overseas, who in the modern day often endure grueling labor to yield beautiful works where their name doesn’t even manage to make the final cut of the credits. So, as we think back on these films, let us not leave them out of the conversation. Their contributions were incalculable.\n\nAnd when you look at these films as elaborate works of arduous labor, the quality grows. The studio was known for its “animagic” style of creation, where traditional cel animation worked side-by-side with stop motion technique to make the perfect shot. Hand drawn snow cascades over a shot of a stop motion set. When Aaron plays the drums for the infant Christ in The Little Drummer Boy, his lithe arms move with great fluidity. In a particularly striking scene from Comin’ to Town, Jessica (that is, a young Mrs. Claus) sings a ballad as the town around her dissolves into a cel animated dreamscape of many colors with her figure continuing to croon as it does. Budget limitations and desire for profit did not deter the artistic sensibility of the team. Across the movies, striking visuals are abound and come from the dedicated work of skilled craftsmen. That alone seems to me to be something that ought to stick around in our collective consciousness.\n\nIf nothing else, these films are truly and deeply a team effort. This feels like a silly thing to say — an animated film is nothing without the combined work of the storyboarders, the composers, the character designers and animators, the voice actors, the directors and so on. But this innate quality truly sparkles in the works of Rankin/Bass. Superstar voice talent and career in-house voiceover artists like Paul Frees alike bring characters to life. Visually skilled minds like Coker craft endearing, cuddly designs for the players. Multitalented hands at under-appreciated studios bring models to life. The cogs turn, and the end result is a memory that sticks to the walls of your brain as something warm and kind, comforting and nostalgic. Through these many hands, passing through with a sensibility that is unlike anything else in the medium, we get true originals.\n\nRankin/Bass was a work in progress. After years of cultivation in short-form television, Walt Disney set the tone from its first feature with the visual wealth and lushness of Snow White. Rudolph, meanwhile and for all of its merits, is still clunky and odd and jerky. Its position as the first entry in their holiday resume is very obvious, even just looking at the visual leap in the specials that aired a couple years later.\n\nPutting it next to The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, their final stop motion special, is what really shows the growth and dedication, though. In the film’s opening sequence, a bombastic song about immortality plays as supernatural creatures arrive to discuss the fate of one Kris Kringle, with their names announced by a polyglot elf as they go. The designs are stunning, fitting a group of immortal creatures. A wind demon with a head shaped like a dark snowflake sends winds whipping down the aisle. The Great Ak, a massive bearded man with a hat that looks to be carved from real wood, presides.\n\nThe eye doesn’t really know where to look first. Simultaneously, it’s somehow not too busy. It’s all a wonder. Maybe it’s more special or impressive that animation studios like Disney and Dreamworks started out with medium-defining masterpieces like The Prince of Egypt and Snow White. Still, I think there’s a beauty of its own in watching one, in real time, crawl on its belly and learn to toddle, grow to walk and then sprint.\n\nThis doesn’t even touch upon the myriad of works the studio created that had nothing to do with Christmas. This includes a couple of Easter specials — one in which Fred Astaire reprises his singing mailman role — a cult classic Halloween film called Mad Monster Party? (with punctuation), and traditionally animated works such as those adaptations of The Lord of the Rings, The Last Unicorn and, if you’ll believe it, production of the series Thundercats. It’d be a massive challenge to even attempt to squish their importance in animation into one seasonal article. All I can do is invite you to dig deep for yourself.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the general population doesn’t known much about Rankin/Bass. Most people I mention them to don’t know them offhand — those old clarifications I mentioned always seem to be needed. Creators like Tad Mochinaga and Paul Coker seem even more anonymous. It feels as if it’s all gradually being eroded, washed away in a sea of newer, more advanced, more marquee specials, eaten up by a world where a couple of annointed studios dominate the industry with relentless corporate dominance. There is no more room for the smaller, the imperfect and the secondary.\n\nAnd yet, vestiges of their artistry live on still. Ian Worthington — or “WorthiKids” — the independent animator behind creations like BigTop Burger, has made his admiration for the studio plain. Perhaps most notable is his short “Hatbox Troubles,” where a distinctly Coker-esque rendition of the Hatbox Ghost from Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion gets up to mischief with a narration reminiscent of Paul Frees, the prolific actor who lent his voice to both a pile of Rankin-Bass characters and the mansion’s Ghost Host. The little ghost is rendered in the animation software Blender, artfully done to evoke the texture and weight of a stop motion figurine in digital form. The year before, Worthington posted a similarly styled animation of Danny Elfman in his Oingo Boingo days. The passion, for both the medium and the influences that shaped the concept, is palpable.\n\nThese labors of love demonstrate something I’ve learned in my own fascination: if nothing else, these films have a chance through enthusiasts and artists. Worthington did a 2020 video with YouTuber Quinton Reviews where they dig deep on more esoteric Rankin/Bass works. Searching the studio’s name on the site will yield dozens of preserved clips, easily accessible, sandwiched between top ten lists and animation lovers recounting their output with great delight. Musicians cover the showtunes. Searching “rankin bass” on Tumblr will get you crisp gif sets of The Last Unicorn, credited Paul Coker illustrations, fanart, trivia, even a meme of Jack Frost T-posing if that’s what you’re into. Animation nerds on Twitter share the moments they tune in to their favorite specials in real time.\n\nSo, maybe I’m Chicken Little. Or maybe there is a potential lost media crisis on the horizon. Maybe it’s a bit of both, or neither. It seems like one of those things only time will assure. But whether the works of Rankin/Bass are really an endangered species or not, I believe this much: their contributions are special, one-of-a-kind entries into animated canon more than worthy of cultural preservation. There is nothing else in animated canon quite like them — of-its-time in the best way, growing in real time, built from international artistic perspective, passionate and whimsical.\n\nIf every overenthusiastic homage to this studio is just one bit of spackle in a foundation that keeps its legacy standing upright through the storm of time passing, I’m happy to contribute. If you’ve never taken a trip through the oeuvre before, why not start this year? Take an hour to meet a more esoteric stop motion figurine — the nefarious Kubla Kraus, or Frosty’s snow children, or Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey. Find a favorite. Make a new tradition. Share in a bit of buried art, help it stick around a little longer. And maybe, this Christmas, raise a glass to Arthur Rankin, Jules Bass, Tadahito Mochinaga, Paul Coker, Paul Frees, and every other hand, heart and voice that helped build a holiday tapestry — covered in hard-working fingerprints."
