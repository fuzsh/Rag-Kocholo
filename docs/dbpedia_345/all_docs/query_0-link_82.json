        "text": "Over the last couple of years, superstar Shahid Kapoor has transformed himself from your average chocolate boy of Bollywood to an actor who performs in a versatile demeanour. His latest post pandemic release, “Jersey”, where he essays the role of a cricketer is a clear indication of the same. His performance in this Telugu remake has garnered unanimous praise from critics and audiences alike.\n\nFrom his humble beginnings as a background dancer to becoming one of the highest-paid actors of the Hindi Film Industry, Shahid Kapoor’s new abode situated in Worli, Mumbai is a reflection of his roots.\n\nYears after his marriage with Mira Rajput, they have now settled down in their palatial INR 55 crore home which is not just high-class but exclusive too.\n\nThe son of actors Pankaj Kapur and Neelima Azeem, he has followed the path of hard work and dedication to make his own mark in the industry. Let us dive deeper into the intricacies of the exquisite sea facing apartments.\n\nOverview of Shahid Kapoor’s House\n\nShahid had purchased the plush multi-floor property back in 2018. The “Three Sixty West” is located in Bandra-Worli Sea Link which has a stunning view of Mumbai’s coastal line. The flat, which is spread across floors 42 and 43, costs a whopping INR 55 crores. As per reports, he made an additional payment of INR 2.19 Crore to the Government for just stamp duty registration.\n\nThe project was handled by Oasis Realty in a joint venture with Oberoi Realty Company and Sahana Development Corporation.\n\nThree Sixty West is a mixed-use land development project consisting of two high-rise towers. One of them is the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and the other tower is solely for luxurious residences managed by Ritz-Carlton.\n\nThe architecture of the building was spearheaded by an American company named Kohn Pedersen Fox. This is the second tallest skyscraper in India behind the Taj Mahal, towering at 85 stories high. The actor’s new home covers an area of 8,625 sq feet, which provides enough space for the couple and their two children to enjoy the breathtaking views from their palace.\n\nShahid Kapoor’s New House Interior\n\nIn Mira Rajput’s Instagram post, we can get an idea of the apartment’s interiors. Wood and dark hues are the primary design themes of this house, while colourful artefacts and furnishings add a layer of fun.\n\nThe Lavishing Living Space\n\nThe living room is lavish but minimalist at the same time. Barring aside the woodwork, a subdued white and black colour palette is used throughout the space, all of this is supplemented with eye-catching elements such as a huge mirror, warm yellow lighting and edgy wire chairs.\n\nThere is a huge centre-table placed in the middle of the hall with a grand couch along with multiple cushions surrounded by tall flower vases. The room opens to a large balcony that provides ample sunlight and compliments the overall look of the room.\n\nThe couple also possess an exhaustive library adorned with an impressive collection of books. In addition to that, a stunning piece of abstract art hangs behind the sofa, which adds for further visual appeal.\n\nThe Sassiest Bedroom\n\nWhen it is B-town’s most popular couple’s private space, it has to have a personal touch. This is the mantra which has been followed while designing the interiors of their bedroom. You can see how the walls are covered with polaroids capturing the couple’s most memorable moments.\n\nAlong with this, there is an hourglass, some candles, a bicycle bookend, and exclusive pieces of art, while the dark-coloured theme infuses a cosier vibe to the room. The house is an excellent example of style and class that reflects his personality.\n\nThe Family’s Former Residence in Juhu\n\nBefore moving to their dreamhouse, the couple along with their two kids- daughter Misha and son Zain, used to live in an apartment in Juhu.\n\nThe aesthetically pleasing veranda in this apartment was created by D Decor owner, Gauri Khan. The wooden patio is the highlight of this space. The porch is full of nature-elements such as potted flowers and plants, outdoor seats, and a sheet of grass that makes it seem like a tiny garden-like area. The entire spot could also be treated as a playground for the kids with swings, trampolines and an inflatable pool.\n\nBlack and white is a two-tone combination you can never go wrong with. A huge chunk of their living room here is decked with classic hues, large mirrors and plush sofas. The couple’s preference to dark tones can also be witnessed with their newest property.\n\nShahid Kapoor’s Sky-High Mansion Price\n\nShahid Kapoor lives in an upscale residential complex named Three Sixty West Apartment, adjacent to the former location of the Old Passport Office in Hanuman Nagar, Worli, Mumbai. His duplex apartment is on the 42nd and 43rd floors. It is reported that Shahid Kapoor’s house is worth about 58 crore rupees, a significant sum of money. Additionally, when purchasing this property, he paid an extra 2.91 crore rupees in stamp duty; a tax one pays when buying a property.\n\nLiving nearly amongst the clouds in such a bustling city as Mumbai, Shahid Kapoor’s house is akin to a dream. His house sounds like something out of a dream, right? The breathtaking views and opulence his home offers are truly fitting for a celebrity of his stature, justifying the hefty price tag.\n\nShahid Kapoor’s Balcony View: A Glimpse into Luxury\n\nShahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput’s duplex in Worli, boasts a 500-square-foot balcony on the 42nd and 43rd floors, providing a stunning view of the Arabian Sea. This peaceful spot, designed to complement their modern home, is a favourite of Shahid and Mira for enjoying serene mornings or sparkling city lights at night. It is a stylish, tranquil retreat for coffee, yoga, relaxation, and family time. These outdoor spaces have high-end furnishings like a plush grey sofa, coffee table, and potted plants. Moreover, he enjoys recording fun reels on the balcony for his fans, giving us a glimpse into his space.\n\nPeek into Shahid Kapoor’s Stylish Kitchen Space\n\nShahid Kapoor’s kitchen is the perfect mix of style and function. It features spacious, custom-made grey cabinets that keep things tidy and match the home’s decor. The kitchen has top-notch gadgets and appliances, from fancy ovens to smart fridges, ideal for cooking enthusiasts or a busy household. It’s a cosy spot for family time, installed with natural and stylish lighting. This kitchen truly reflects Shahid’s luxurious lifestyle.\n\nAmong the sleek furniture and breathtaking views of Shahid Kapoor’s luxurious Mumbai home, an iconic piece catches the eye: “a foot model”. This isn’t just any foot model; it’s a statement of style and a homage to the unexpected in interior design. Facing the balcony, this giant foot installation is a major highlight in the house and is also used as a coffee table by the actor. This piece has been the talk on social media and trolled for many reasons, all in good spirits!\n\nHis Net Worth\n\nWith an estimated net worth of over INR 258 crores (USD 36 million), it is only evident that he will own some of the most luxurious possessions imaginable.\n\nHis Luxurious Garage\n\nThe actor owns some of the swankiest and most expensive automobiles and bikes. Some of his possessions include:\n\nMercedes AMG S400 worth INR 1.28 crores\n\nBMW 7 Series\n\nLexus 470\n\nMercedes GL Class\n\nPorsche Cayenne GTS\n\nHarley Davidson Fat Boy\n\nYamaha MT01\n\nMaybach S580\n\nShahid Kapoor’s Newest Film\n\nAfter the success of Farzi on an OTT platform, Shahid Kapoor’s latest film, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, released on February 9, 2024, featuring a unique love story where the hero falls in love with a female android named Sifra, played by actress, Kriti Sanon. The movie blends elements of romance, humour, and drama in a setting that raises questions about human relationships with technology. The turnover of the movie was a great success, with a collection grossing over ₹95.43 crore (US$12 million) in India alone. Additionally, it garnered ₹37.35 crore (around US$4.7 million) from international markets, bringing its global earnings to a total of ₹132.78 crore (about US$17 million).\n\nShahid Kapoor’s forthcoming film Deva, directed by Rosshan Andrrews, is expected to hit the cinemas in October 2024. The movie’s plot centres on a clever but defiant policeman who reveals a complex scheme of deception and treachery while pursuing a prominent case.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nShahid Kapoor started as a background dancer before transitioning into mainstream acting. He has metamorphosed into an actor of substance and his body of work is an evidence of that. His performances in features like Haider, Kabir Singh, Padmavat, and Jersey were unanimously praised by critics and audiences alike. We can only wait to see what the future holds for a talented actor like him.\n\nStories you may also like"
