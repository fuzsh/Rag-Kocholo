        "text": "Shahid Kapoor has brought numerous memorable characters to life throughout his acting career. One of his most iconic roles was Aditya Kashyap in Imtiaz Ali’s Jab We Met. Now, Mumbai Police, known for their witty social media posts, did something that reminded us of this iconic character. To up their meme game, they took to their official Instagram handle and dropped a hilarious post featuring Shahid Kapoor from Jab We Met and Cillian Murphy from Peaky Blinders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMumbai Police’s latest post focused on the benefit of using different passwords for every account to enhance cybersecurity. They shared side-by-side pictures of Shahid Kapoor as Aditya Kashyap from Jab We Met and Cillian Murphy as Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders . Comparing the two characters, Mumbai Police wrote on their official Insta handle, “Your Password âShelbyâ different for all accounts&mldr;Meanwhile your password.”\n\nWhile these two projects are not connected to each other in any way, the resemblance of Shahid Kapoor and Cillian Murphy’s characters is simply uncanny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShahid Kapoor reshared Mumbai Police’s post on his Instagram stories and tagged the department, accompanied by three laughing emojis.\n\nInternet was simply in awe of the Mumbai Police’s creativity. An Instagram user shared in the comment section, “This page meme creativity is on another level as compared to other meme pages.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother social media user wrote, “Childhood brothers got separated during mela..”\n\n“Mumbai Police watches more series and movies than me,â a comment read.\n\nImtiaz Ali’s Jab We Met starring Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor hit the cinema halls in 2007. The film was highly appreciated by the viewers and the characters remain fresh in the hearts of movie buffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the tremendous success of the web series, Farzi, Shahid Kapoor recently confirmed a sequel."
