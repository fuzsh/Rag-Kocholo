        "text": "\"Honestly, I don't think 'Dil Bole Hadippa' is a woman-oriented subject. Of course, Rani has a very, very important role in the film and when you see it you will realise yourself how both of us actually fit into the storyline,\" Shahid told IANS.\n\nThe actor, who had hectic schedules before and after the release of dark thriller \"Kaminey\", is now busy promoting Anurag Singh's \"Dil Bole Hadippa\". But he admits that he could let down his hair more often during the shooting of \"...Hadippa\" when compared to Vishal Bharadwaj's \"Kaminey\".\n\n\"Seriously, 'Dil Bole Hadippa' is so contrasting to 'Kaminey'...in terms of genre, setting, performances, space, treatment and audiences. The film is very much in the space of the commercial genre. It is an out-and-out entertainer with a Punjabi background to it. Playing Rohan was not as challenging as enacting the role of Charlie or Guddu. After a 'Dhan Te Nan', it was a lot of fun to be indulging in some 'bhangra shangra'!\" Shahid said.\n\n\"By god's grace I have been accepted by audiences in my romantic avtar; so why let that go? A movie like 'Kaminey' or a 'Dil Bole Hadippa' only helps further in getting a contrast. Your value as an actor is realised due to the contrast you bring in,\" he said.\n\n\"Now look at 'Jab We Met'. I was an introvert there and the role was so different. Audiences gave me a thumbs up there and they did so for 'Kaminey' as well. But, frankly, after a point in time I don't want to start gauging audiences' reaction too much. Instead I wish to follow my instincts and give them what I feel could be a real value add,\" Shahid said.\n\n\"Honestly, I would love to do different kind of films. I can't be getting or doing 'Kaminey' all the time. To even think in that direction would be unfair. After all such a role can come to any actor may be once in a couple of years,\" Shahid said."
