        "meta_description": "Shahid Kapoor recently performed at an award function when he experienced a little mishap on stage. Some videos of the actor’s performance surfaced on social media wherein he can be seen dancing on his popular songs at the event. Shahid had set the stage on fire with his energetic dance moves, however towards the end of his performance, he slipped and fell. Nonetheless, the ‘Farzi’ actor did not let this goof-up affect his performance and quickly got back up on his feet in style. Shahid ended his performance in style as the audience cheered on for him. After his act, he was also seen blowing kisses to the audience while taking a close look at the edge of the stage to figure out how he tripped. One of his fans also showed concern for the actor as he commented, ‘hope he wasn’t hurt at the end’. Meanwhile, Shahid Kapoor recently made headlines for his statement on not doing multiple films at a time. In an interview, the actor reportedly said ‘I’m trying to do as many films that I can, but mera kya hai na mai muuch chipkaa ke acting nahi karta.’ He further added how he ‘doesn’t understand that type of acting’ and prefers doing only one film at a time. Many on the internet thought that Shahid’s statement was a dig at actors like Akshay Kumar who is known to do about 4-5 films in a calendar year. On the work front, Shahid will be next seen in an untitled romantic film produced by Dinesh Vijan alongside Kriti Sanon.",
