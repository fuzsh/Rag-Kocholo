        "text": "Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani’s Kabir Singh has hit the theatres today. The film has opened to decent reviews and the audience has loved Shahid’s performance in the film. Shahid plays the character of a brash medical student who falls in love with his junior, however, when their relationship comes to an end Kabir’s character cannot contain his grief and anger. According to the people who have watched the film, Shahid has outdone all his previous performances. Kiara’s innocent appeal is also striking a chord with the audience. Though a few reviewers have called the film highly misogynistic in nature. According to early box-office estimates, Kabir Singh might become the second highest opener of 2019 after Salman Khan’s Bharat.\n\nIt is being predicted that if all goes well, the film might earn around Rs 15 crores on its opening day making it Shahid’s highest opening ever. Well, watch this space for more news on the same."
