        "text": "Actor Shahid Kapoor, who started off as a background dancer in Bollywood, is celebrating his 40th birthday, today, and taking on the pitch (and screen) as Arjun Raichand, a cricketer in Jersey, later this year. The flick, directed by Gowtam Tinnanuri, is scheduled to release in theatres on November 5, 2021. And, judging by the actor’s popularity on-screen, the film’s expected to cross his previous highest grossing titles at the box office. See below.\n\n7 highest grossing Shahid Kapoor films to watch today on Amazon Prime Video & Netflix\n\n1. PADMAAVAT - AMAZON PRIME VIDEO | Box Office collection: Rs 282 crore\n\nSanjay Leela Bhansali’s magnum opus, Padmaavat, featuring Shahid Kapoor, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and an ensemble cast of supporting actors, was highly criticised for its inaccurate portrayal of Alauddin Khilji’s personality. But at the same time, it became one of the highest-grossing Indian movies of all time and won three National Film Awards.\n\n2. KABIR SINGH - NETFLIX | Box Office collection: Rs 276 crore\n\nKabir Singh, released in 2019, is the Hindi remake of a 2017 Telugu film, Arjun Reddy featuring South superstar Vijay Deverakonda in the titular role. Both films were directed by Sandeep Vanga, and despite coming under the public spotlight for its misogynistic undertones, went on to become the biggest hit of Shahid Kapoor’s career.\n\n3. R...RAJKUMAR - AMAZON PRIME VIDEO | Box Office collection: Rs 65 crore\n\nR... Rajkumar (2013) is a quintessential Bollywood action drama flick, written and directed by Prabhu Deva. The plot follows Shahid Kapoor as Romeo Rajkumar, a tough thug, whose life changes for the better when he falls for Chanda (played by Sonakshi Sinha).\n\n4. UDTA PUNJAB - NETFLIX | Box Office collection: Rs 58 crore\n\nAbhishek Chaubey’s Udta Punjab (2016) is among Shahid Kapoor’s career’s most memorable performances. The plot, while highlighting Punjab’s rampant drug abuse problem, follows Shahid Kapoor as Tejinder \"Tommy\" Singh. He’s a musician, who succumbs to drugs which triggers a chain of events.\n\n5. HAIDER - NETFLIX | Box Office collection: Rs 49 crore\n\nStarring Shahid Kapoor and Tabu in the lead roles, with Kay Kay Menon, Shraddha Kapoor and Irrfan Khan in supporting roles, Haider, set in Kashmir is a brilliant modern-day adaptation of William Shakespeare's Hamlet. Of course, Shahid Kapoor’s famous monologue comes to mind at the very mention of this film, but there’s not a single frame in this Vishal Bhardwaj directorial that will disappoint you.\n\n6. KAMINEY - NETFLIX | Box Office collection: Rs 41 crore\n\nKaminey (2009) is another Vishal Bhardwaj directorial that was a big hit when it was released. The film is set against the backdrop of a Mafia-dominated era in Mumbai and follows the rivalry between a pair of twin brothers, one with a lisp and the other with a stutter, who find a guitar case loaded with cocaine worth millions. The twins are played by Shahid Kapoor.\n\n7. SHAANDAAR - AMAZON PRIME VIDEO | Box Office collection: Rs 39 crore\n\nThis 2015 rom-com has been a feel-good escape for many Shahid Kapoor fans. The plot unravels a comical love story between his and Alia Bhatt’s characters after they meet at a wedding."
