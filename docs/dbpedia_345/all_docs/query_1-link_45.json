        "text": "After wrapping up ‘Rangoon’s Mumbai scheduled shoot, Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut have taken their film to Arunachal Pradesh. The two were spotted at the airport as they were leaving for their film’s next schedule. As they landed and reached their desired location, Shahid was snapped in Arunachal Pradesh's traditional attire. Reportedly, Shahid and Kangana will be shooting for a song sequence at Jonai railway station where the film’s entire team has gathered around. The song is being choreographed by Farah Khan, who was also snapped dressed in Arunachal Pradesh's traditional attire along with film’s director Vishal Bharadwaj. Shahid and Kangana’s co-star Saif Ali Khan is also with the film’s team. The film is a classic tale that is set against the backdrop of World War II. In this love triangle, we’ll see Saif playing the character of a filmmaker, Kangana as an actress from the 40s and Shahid plays the role of an army officer.\n\nSource: Deccan Chronicle"
