        "text": "What if I tell you a bunch of #Dhobis save a company like OYO. So here goes... In 2014-15, his budget hotel chain was on fire- conquering city after city across India. New hotels were signing up daily. Everyone is attracted by OYO's promise of increased bookings. But for an Indian entrepreneur everything is going so smoothly? Doesn't seem right. Well it wasn't. A major problem was bugging the OYO team. Bed sheets. Or more precisely, the lack thereof. OYO's rapid expansion had outpaced their linen supply chain. Their usual, high-end laundry service simply couldn't handle the exploding volume. Panic started to settle in. Frantic calls were made, quotes compared, but the solutions were all the same --> expensive and agonizingly slow. OYO prided itself on clean, crisp sheets and 5-star customer experience. Ritesh couldn't let a pile of dirty laundry be the reason for their downfall. One particular afternoon, Ritesh called an emergency team meeting with his Bangalore team. The mood was tense. Spreadsheets with alarmingly red numbers were projected on the wall. Just when everyone was about to lose their calm, a voice broke the silence. It was Manoj, a young manager from the Delhi operations. \"We could work with the dhobis,\" he offered. A collective eyebrow raise met his suggestion. Dhobis, the traditional Indian washermen, were known for their punctuality and open-air drying methods. Aren't they too old fashioned to handle OYO's modern demands? But Manoj, a Delhi native, had grown up relying on dhobis for their efficient and surprisingly affordable service. He argued that their network was vast, their turnaround time unbeatable, and their prices, well, a fraction of the fancy laundry services. Ritesh, being the excellent leader that he is, supported this idea in a heartbeat. Ritesh and his team scoured the cities, negotiating bulk deals with dhobis, setting up efficient pick-up and drop-off routes, and even establishing mini \"OYO Laundromats\" in strategic locations with a few industrial washing machines. The collaboration was a sight to behold. The \"Great OYO Bed Sheet Fiasco,\" as it came to be known internally, became a turning point. Moral of the story: The solution to your business problems can come from anywhere... as long your mind is open. #gogolstory #OYO\n\nLooking to start an AirBnB or Villa business in India? This is the exact blueprint you can use to get started: Step 1: Find a Villa you can rent It can be a vacation home you have in your family, a friend’s bungalow or contact a real estate agent to find one (You’ll incur an additional brokerage fee in this case) Step 2: Know your numbers Sample costs for renting a Villa near Pune: ➡️ Rent: INR 50,000 (depending on location) ➡️ Housekeeping: INR 15,000 (per employee) + INR 5,000 (overhead- excluding stay) + INR 5,000 (per employee for stay) ➡️ Utilities: May vary depending on use ➡️ Secuity Deposit: INR 2,00,000 -3,00,000 (depending on the villa) ➡️ One time Set up costs: INR 30,000 (Licences, GST) For a 4-5 bedroom villa, you’ll need 1 person to do the housekeeping. But if business booms, you may need to hire more employees. Step 3: Hire and train your staff, set up SOPs Step 4: Get customers Work with AirBnB, makemytrip, or other platforms (they’ll take 20-25% of your revenue) or reach out to your network, start marketing to get reservations You can start this business with 7 to 8 lakh rupees. And break-even within the first year! On AirBnB, you don’t even need all these certifications! But you need to have be careful about 2 things: ✴️ Condition 1: The Place needs to be renovated and updated on its own. It should be ready to use ✴️ Condition 2: The villa needs to be in a good location (ease of accessibility and connectivity) P.S.- Did you know if crime happens in your villa, you will be held responsible?\n\nI was going to outdoor tour with my friend's then i encounter a luxury hotel, but we could not afford to stay in Oberoi. after that i saw many HNI's boarding in hotel and i have read in newspaper that no. of HNI's in India will grow hence hotel industry will be booming till next decade or so. Thus i though i should do financial modelling of EIH LTD. EIH LTD remains in good financial position so far They have strong revenue growth (10 years-5%) and profit growth (10 years-20%) this also means that revenue is not keeping the pace with profit or in simple terms business is not growing in proportion of it's net profit. Both margins and ROE are in double digit due sudden boom in hospitality industry after COVID-19. It has strong brand image Majority of it's revenue comes from room(48.9%) and food(37.5%) and beverages & that also from India. with Revenue Per Available Room per Day (RevPAR) (Rs) stands 16,962 compare to its peer chalets hotel 8,984. In hospitality industry occupancy rate is important factor hence occupancy rate for EIH LTD stands at 84% and for chalet hotels it's 74%. To conclude future growth remains on two factor a) Growing no. of rich people. b) property rates. This is a EIH LTD financial Modelling featuring both DCF and VAR ( means how much money could you lose in EIH stock tomorrow). Your feedback is highly appreciated.

We currently have 2,298 keys spread among 30 hotels in 20 cities. We run hotels in the Upper Midscale, Economy, and Luxury & Upscale segments that are owned, leased, and managed by us. The Park Hotels\" are in the first category, \"Zone by the Park Hotels\" are in the upper midscale category, which is often made up of four-star hotels, and Stop by Zone\" is our brand of #budget motel. We have all three types of ownership in \"The Park Hotels\": owned, leased, and management contracts. The about 20 hotels in \"Zone by the Park Hotels\" are all valuable properties. Differentiated #leadership is what we believe in. Our capacity to continuously maintain higher occupancy rates is our main competitive advantage. India has the highest occupancy rate for the six months ending September 30, 2023 at 93%. In the luxury upmarket market, we also lead the REVPAR. Our dominance in the #food and beverage industry is our second main asset. We are able to counteract the seasonality that is generally linked to the hospitality industry thanks to our F&B revenue. Across our hotels, we run roughly 81 bars, nightclubs, and #restaurants. Their unique designs and the experiences they offer set them apart. Approximately 39% of our overall sales in FY23 and 42% of our revenue for the six months ending September 30, 2023, came from this division. Finally, but most certainly not least, is our strong #financial standing. In FY23, we made ₹524 Crore in total revenue, an increase of over 96% from the previous year. Compared to 21.76% in FY22, we attained an EBITDA margin of 33.77% in FY23. We have developed an asset-light strategy to support the growth of the brands \"Zone by The Park\" and \"Zone Connect by the Park.\" The properties we own, manage, and lease comprise a diverse portfolio spanning across India. During the next five years, we intend to add roughly 4,153 rooms. Approximately 2,371 of these are being added to the asset-light space of management contracts; 1,481 of these are being put to the owned side, and 301 are being added to the leased side. A great deal of attention is paid to the business model's asset-light side. www.tycoonstory.com #PriyaPaul #ApeejaySurrendraParkHotels #TheParkHotels #HospitalityIndustry #WomenInLeadership #HotelManagement #LuxuryHotels #IndianHospitality #SustainableTourism #Hotelier #BusinessLeadership #WomenEntrepreneurs #HospitalityExcellence #LuxuryTravel #InspiringLeaders Apeejay Surrendra Group Agnivo De Chandi Agarwal Daniel Raj Prakash Ranjan\n\n\"Can your villa in Goa generate a rental yield of ₹40,000 per day?\" - this topic is creating quite a debate online. Parul Gulati said that she can make a rent of 40,000 by renting her 2BHK in Goa. And Akshat Srivastava came in and disagreed. Here's my perspective: Akshat based his figures on a 4% rental yield and a 200-day occupancy rate, which is quite high for real estate. His facts and figures match what my experience has taught me in all these years in the real estate market. A ₹20 crore valuation is highly unrealistic even if the villa features: → Expansive space → High-end amenities → Goa's largest pool And then again it's important to remember that properties listed on Airbnb incur various costs, such as: → Manager fees → Daily expenses → Airbnb commissions Even accounting for these, expecting a daily rent of ₹25,000 to ₹30,000 is highly improbable. Setting such high expectations for investors can lead to disappointment. That is why it is very important to be very clear and well informed before buying a property, What are your thoughts on this? #realestate #income #investment #india #business"
