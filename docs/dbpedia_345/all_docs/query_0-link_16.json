        "text": "Shahid Kapoor has recently announced a cop action thriller under the banner of Zee Studios.\n\nMaking the announcement, Shahid wrote on his Twitter, “Get ready for an adrenaline-fueled ride with our thrilling action film directed by#RosshanAndrrews. I can’t wait to bring this story to life. Stay tuned for more!”.\n\nAccording to Shahid’s post, the film will be helmed by the renowned Malayalam director Rosshan Andrrews, who is known for Malayalam blockbusters like Salute and Kayamkulam Kochunni.\n\nThe plot of the film follows a brilliant yet rebellious police officer investigating a high-profile case. As he delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a web of deceit and betrayal, leading him down a thrilling and dangerous path.\n\nBoth Shahid and Rosshan shared their thoughts on the film.\n\nShahid said, It’s rare to find a subject that has action, thrill, drama and suspense all packed into one script and I am really looking forward to this. It's a privilege to be collaborating with Zee Studios and with Siddharth Roy Kapur, with whom I have worked on Haider and Kaminey earlier. We have also been neighbours for a long time, haha! Rosshan Andrrews is a veteran filmmaker whose Malayalam filmography is spectacular. We have spent many months together now and it will be a pleasure to work with such a fantastic cinematic mind. I can’t wait to bring this exhilarating, entertaining and thrilling story to the masses”.\n\nWhereas Rosshan said, “I am thrilled to make my Bollywood debut with this gripping story and work with such an incredible team of professionals. The combination of Shahid's exceptional acting, Siddharth Roy Kapur's expertise as a producer, and Zee Studios’ commitment to delivering ground-breaking content is truly inspiring. Their passion and dedication to the project have been instrumental in bringing the story to life. As a director, I aim to create an immersive cinematic experience that leaves audiences awed. I believe that this project has all the necessary elements to achieve that goal”.\n\nFans seem pretty excited about the project but they are worried if the film turns out to be ‘just another remake’.\n\nReportedly, the film will be a remake of the 2013 Malayalam film Mumbai Police directed by Rosshan Andrrews.\n\nOne user wrote, “Guys it's not a remake , if it would’ve been they would’ve said it loud and clear. So excited for this action thriller”.\n\nAnother user reacted, “Plz Bhai confirm that yea Mumbai police ka remake hai ya original story hai plzz confirm Karo”.\n\nOne other user reacted, “Are bhai , agr remake hoti toh they would have mentioned it”.\n\nThe film is scheduled to go on floors in the second half of 2023 and will release in 2024.\n\nApart from this, Shahid has two films in his pipeline; Bloody Daddy and an untitled film with Kriti Sanon.\n\nThe trailer for Bloody Daddy was released recently and is getting appreciated as people are digging Shahid’s action avatar.\n\nYou can watch the trailer for Bloody Daddy here."
