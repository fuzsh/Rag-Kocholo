        "text": "Pooja Entertainment is gearing up to take the audience on a thrilling journey where ancient legend meets modern marvel. Headlined by Shahid Kapoor, the magnum opus is helmed by Sachin Ravi. Kapoor takes the stage in his most monumental role yet in ‘Ashwatthama The Saga Continues’ – a magnum opus that tells a gripping tale that blurs the lines between myth and reality.\n\nThe magnum opus ‘Ashwatthama The Saga Continues’ will be released in five languages: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada.\n\nSet in the present era marked by rapid technological advancements and humanity's remarkable capabilities, Ashwatthama confronts the challenges of modernity, facing off against formidable adversaries in a high-octane, action-packed narrative. As the mystery of a legendary figure thrust into the chaos of the present day unravels, the film explores the inner psyche of an immortal being, revealing how he perceives the world he has witnessed for thousands of years.\n\nIn the sneak peek given, the makers promised us an adrenaline-fueled clash of titans as ancient valour clashes with contemporary might. It will be an electrifying ride where the past and present collide, and the true essence of heroism is put to the ultimate test.\n\nProducer Jackky Bhagnani says, “Every project we undertake is not just about entertainment; it's about creating an experience that resonates deeply with audiences, leaving a lasting impact on their hearts and minds. After Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, I wanted to do an unexpected film and that's when this came our way. It is a modern-day spin on a story we all know and the interpretation of the legend has been a joy to achieve.\"\n\nShahid Kapoor's Instagram post\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C4sieb0t4pG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"
