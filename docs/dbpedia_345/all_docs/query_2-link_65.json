        "text": "New Bollywood release ‘Jersey’ starring Shahid Kapoor, which is about a former cricketer returning to the field to fulfill his son’s and his own dreams, might be getting mixed reviews as a movie, but the promo of the movie made a major presence on the OOH-scape in the city. Executed by OOH company Minimax, the campaign was rolled out across 35 hoardings and 4 LEDs at all prime locations in Mumbai including Bandra, Worli, Juhu, Khar Linking Road, Mahim, JVPD Circle, etc. The campaign ran from April 6 to April 24.\n\nSpeaking about the return of movie promos on the OOH landscape, Arvind Bhandari - MD, Minimax, which deals in a range of OOH media including billboards, bus shelters, bus and train media, among others, says, “The market is looking very good. With movie halls reopening in Mumbai, all the movie releases that were on pause due to Covid are now getting released; and there is very good marketing happening now.”"
