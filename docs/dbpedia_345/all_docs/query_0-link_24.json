        "text": "The Buckingham Murders, directed by Hansal Mehta and starring Kareena Kapoor Khan, has been set as the opening film of the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.\n\nProduced by Ektaa R Kapoor and co-produced by Kapoor Khan, the film recently had its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival. It follows the story of a cop and single mother who recently lost her child in a shooting spree, as she transfers to a market town north of London and is assigned the case of a missing child.\n\nKapoor Khan will attend the festival’s red carpet opening ceremony on October 27 at the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre (NMACC) in Mumbai.\n\nThe film also stars Ash Tandon (Bodyguard), Ranveer Brar (MasterChef India) and Keith Allen (Kingsman: The Golden Circle). It was written by Aseem Arrora, Kashyap Kapoor, and Raghav Raj Kakker and produced by Balaji Telefilms and TBM Films alongside Shobha Kapoor, Ektaa R Kapoor and Kapoor Khan. International sales are being handled by Madhu Entertainment.\n\nAnupama Chopra, Jio MAMI Festival Director, said: “Hansal Mehta and Ektaa Kapoor have redefined storytelling across formats. In The Buckingham Murders, they join hands with another formidable artist – Kareena. We are delighted to announce The Buckingham Murders as the opening film at Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.”\n\nDirector Hansal Mehta said: “The Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival has been home to me ever since my rebirth as a filmmaker with Shahid. Coming back here with The Buckingham Murders as the opening film is indeed a proud moment for me personally. It’s the story of South Asian communities settled outside India, and it is heartening to see the world take notice of the kind of cinema we are now capable of producing in India.”\n\nKapoor Khan said: “It’s an honour for me as an actor and first-time co-producer that my film will open the Jio MAMI Mumbai film festival. It’s a place where movies are celebrated and all creative art forms are honoured. Can’t be happier to have our film grace the stage at Jio MAMI. The Buckingham Murders is very special for me since it’s my maiden voyage as a co-producer. Working with Hansal and Ektaa is a deeply satisfying and immersive process. We are only hoping our film will reach wider audiences and break barriers globally”.\n\nThe Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival is taking place from October 27 to November 5."
