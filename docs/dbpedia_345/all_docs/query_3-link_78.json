        "text": "Rana Daggubati might soon join Shahid Kapoor in the much-anticipated film Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Directed by Amit Rai, this film promises to be an intense period piece that highlights a significant chapter from the life of the legendary warrior.\n\nRana Daggubati to play which role in Shahid Kapoor’s next movie Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj?\n\nEarlier this year, it was revealed that Shahid Kapoor would play the role of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Amit Rai’s venture. The makers are in early discussions with Rana Daggubati to cast him as Aurangzeb, the infamous Mughal emperor.\n\nAccording to recent reports, preliminary discussions with Daggubati have already started. Furthermore, more concrete talks will follow once the logistics are finalized. A source close to the project disclosed, “Rana is at the top of the list for Amit Rai for the part of Aurangzeb. However, the logistics need to fall in place for the actor to come on board the film. Shahid is also excited with the probable collaboration.”\n\nUnlike a traditional biopic, Shahid Kapoor’s following promises to be a thrilling recount of one of the most daring episodes in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s life. According to insiders, the movie will focus on a jailbreak orchestrated by Shivaji. “It’s a film based on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, but not a biopic. The makers plan to treat it as a thriller. As the backdrop of the feature film is more on the lines of a jail-break by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the era gone by,” the source added.\n\nThe script for the movie is finalized, and pre-production has already started. The team aims to begin filming by the end of 2024. Shahid Kapoor is reportedly gearing up to undergo intensive preparation for his role as Shivaji Maharaj. Meanwhile, Rana Daggubati is expected to bring a unique intensity to Aurangzeb’s character. The actor is most known for his role in the Baahubali series."
