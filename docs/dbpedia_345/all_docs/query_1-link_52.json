Wondering why? Both the actors feel that allowing phones on the sets can lead to leaking important details of the film on social media.\n\nRecently the film’s fan club managed to get a sneak peek of the grand set erected at Film City, Mumbai, which is why Shahid wants to ensure that no such thing happens in the next schedule. According to the reports by Mid Day, Shahid will be setting an example by depositing his phone with the security guard on set, as soon as he arrives.\n\nThe leading tabloid also quoted a unit source saying, “The film has been mired in controversy for long, delaying the shoot considerably. Every detail of Rani Padmavati’s story, as Bhansali sees it, has become national news. It is important that the film is able to present something fresh. The actors, along with Bhansali, are taking every possible effort to ensure that there are no leaks from the set—whether an actor’s costume or any detail of the set.”\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
