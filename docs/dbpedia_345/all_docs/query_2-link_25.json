        "text": "Synopsis\n\nImtiaz Ali discussed the impact of Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor's breakup during the making of 'Jab We Met' in a recent interview. He praised their professionalism despite personal challenges, highlighting that their relationship did not affect the film's production. 'Jab We Met,' released in 2007, remains a beloved romantic film in Bollywood, with Imtiaz applauding Shahid and Kareena for their commitment to their roles.\n\nFilmmaker Imtiaz Ali recently shed light on the dynamics surrounding the breakup of actors Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor during the filming of their beloved romantic-comedy, 'Jab We Met'. In a candid interview with Galatta India, Imtiaz clarified that the personal upheavals between Shahid and Kareena had no bearing on the production of the film.\n\nKareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor's Professionalism\n\nReleased in 2007, 'Jab We Met' continues to hold a special place in Bollywood's romantic repertoire, enchanting audiences with its heartfelt narrative and captivating performances. Imtiaz commended Shahid and Kareena for their unwavering professionalism throughout the filming process, emphasizing their dedication to their craft.\n\nImtiaz reflected on the period when Shahid and Kareena were romantically involved, stating, \"Their relationship ended at the end of the film... Most of the film was shot. There were two days after their so-called break-up that we had to shoot. They were absolutely professional. No blemish, nothing at all, whatever is happening in their personal lives.\"\n\nAbout 'Jab We Met' and Potential Sequel\n\n'Jab We Met' chronicles the serendipitous encounter of two strangers, Geet Dhillon and Aditya Kashyap, on a train journey to Delhi, as they navigate the complexities of love. The film also features Tarun Arora, Saumya Tandon, and Dara Singh in pivotal roles.\n\nDuring the interview, Imtiaz also revealed fascinating insights into the casting process of 'Jab We Met'. Initially, he envisioned actors Bobby Deol and Preity Zinta as the leads. However, due to various circumstances, including Bobby's other commitments and Shahid's youthful appearance aligning better with the character, the casting evolved to include Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor in the iconic roles.\n\nAddressing speculations about a potential sequel, Imtiaz dismissed the rumors, stating, \"No, it’s not happening. I don’t have a story for Jab We Met 2 yet. I’ve heard of these and read these reports and articles. Nobody asked me before publishing them, so I don’t know what to say. But let’s see what happens.\"\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nMirae Asset's Surana sees overvaluation in select defence stocks, but feels market is fairly valued\n\nMarket risk or deception?
