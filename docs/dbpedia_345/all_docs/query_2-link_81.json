        "text": "Sacred Games 2 released earlier this month, and even after a fortnight, we are still discussing what could have really gone down at the end.\n\nThe Saif Ali Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui-starrer show was highly anticipated by fans. And its open-ending is the kind that Christopher Nolan would be proud of. However, to solve the mystery a little bit, Varun Grover, one of the lead writers of the show, gave us a few hints of whether Mumbai is saved or not, at the end of the second season.\n\nBut before we go ahead, we should warn you that the contents below contain major spoilers.\n\nQUICK READ: Sacred Games 2 Ending Explained\n\nIn the finale, Sartaj Singh (Saif Ali Khan) and his team finally figure out the location of the nuclear bomb that Shahid Khan (Ranvir Shorey) has planted. However, the bomb is already activated and Shahid Khan is killed before revealing how to stop it, on account of not giving any answers. To disable the bomb, Sartaj takes the book he got from Ganesh Gaitonde’s (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) biological father and finds the patterns that could act like the activating or deactivating code. There are five attempts given by the bomb to input the deactivating pattern, two of which are wasted by the scientist.\n\nIn his final attempt, Sartaj picks the pattern given against his father Dilbaug Singh’s name. But we don’t get to see whether he succeeds in deactivating the bomb or fails, as the show ends right after the scene.\n\nAnd recently, Varun Grover spelled out two possible endings beyond this point to a leading publisher. Here’s what he said:\n\nAlternate endings given by writer Varun Grover for Sacred Games Season 2:\n\n1. The first possibility is that Mumbai is saved because Dilbaug Singh’s pattern works. When Guruji (Pankaj Tripathi) spoke to his followers about the bomb, it was only he who wasn’t completely sure of the plan. So, if Guruji wanted a full-proof plan, the disabling passcode would be the pattern given against Dilbaug’s hand print. Back then, Guruji didn’t think that Batya (Kalki Koechlin) and Malcolm (Luke Kenny) would kill Dilbaug to ensure that there is no stopping the onset of Satya Yug.\n\nThis theory also seems more plausible to us because we later also learn that Sartaj and Shahid Khan were related, but torn apart due to the partition. So it would make sense that Sartaj putting in his father’s pattern could save the city.\n\n2. The other ending is that Mumbai is really destroyed. By the end, we see that Sartaj has also started believing in ideologies of the cult. After many sessions with the new Guruji i.e. Batya, Sartaj has lost hope that this world actually needs saving. This could explain why he says Aham Brahmasmi before putting in his father’s pattern. Guruji’s idea was to sacrifice what’s dearest to you, all for the greater cause. He wanted Gaitonde to sacrifice his constant love, that is Mumbai. Guruji himself sacrificed Gaitonde, because he was the dearest to him, but Gaitonde killed himself instead. And Sartaj has become the dearest to Batya, the new Guruji. And she sends him to the location of the bomb, to sacrifice him with the city.\n\nAdding on the sacrifice theme, we feel that by putting in his father’s pattern, there is also a sense of Sartaj finally sacrificing the idea of living up to Dilbaug Singh’s expectations and reputation.\n\nNow, if Sacred Games season three is announced, we obviously know that Mumbai didn’t blow up. In fact, Saif Ali Khan even gave us a few hints about the possibility of the next season. But in case that this is the end to Sartaj Singh and Ganesh Gaitonde’s saga, we know which ending we would prefer.\n\nNOW READ\n\nSacred Games 2: Here’s a recap of season 1 to prep you for the final days of Ganesh Gaitonde’s masterplan\n\nSacred Games 2: What is Gochi and what effects did it have?\n\nSacred Games: Who plays whom in Netflix’s first original Indian series"
