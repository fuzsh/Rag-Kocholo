        "text": "This paper seeks to look at the larger socio-political discourse that informs the two cinematic texts Ghare Baire Aaj by Aparna Sen and Ghare Baire by Satyajit Ray. Ray’s adaptation of Tagore’s novel explores the gendering of the public and private domain within the framework of the nationalist ideology. The film temporally embedded within a colonial context imagines the nation metaphorically through the woman whose possible transgression from private to public domain challenges both nationalist and colonial construction of the titular binary. Counterpoised against this, Sen’s deconstructive post-colonial and postglobal adaptation challenges further the dichotomy of the public and private to expose its fault lines. Sen’s film brings to the fore the contemporary ideological contradictions interpellated within the construction of secularism and liberal discourses of gender. The genderization of popular discourses of nationalism, colonialism and identity constructing the core of both Tagore’s novel and Ray’s film has been further extended and problematised by Sen through the Dalit identity of the central woman character of her movie. The paper then will try to unfold these critical nuances manifested through the dialogical engagement of these texts to unfold the influence of their multi-layered ‘sites’ on the gendered identity construction in the respective cinemas of Satyajit Ray and Aparna Sen.\n\nAn early Indian film adaptation of Macbeth, Jwala (dir. Vinayak, 1938) shows a Lady Mac- beth that sides with Banquo against Macbeth, as if an evil female character were difficult to conceive in the Indian imagination. In 21st century film adaptations of Macbeth, Maqbool (dir. Vishal Bhardwaj, 2003) and Veeram (dir. Jayaraj, 2017), the female character is as evil as in the source text. Yet, neither Nimmi (Lady Macbeth in Maqbool) nor Kuttimani (Lady Macbeth in Veeram) is married to Macbeth at the outset of the film, the implication be- ing an Indian married woman is incapable of such atrocities. In both movies, sexual drive becomes crucial in the course of events. By analyzing the role of Lady Macbeth in Maqbool and Veeram, this paper aims to show that these Lady Macbeths are as based on the play as on the role of the vamp (the evil woman) in popular Indian movies, since characters that are sexually driven are always condemned to death.\n\nFor the past two decades or so, cinema has proven to be the critical ground on which feminist debates about culture, identity and representation have been held. Films reflect social changes but they also shape cultural attitudes. Their stereotypes are the product of unconscious assumptions ingrained too deeply to be changed merely by putting more women in potent positions within the film industry, primarily as the ‘leading ladies.’ It is in this climate that the feminist film theory begins- as an urgent political act and feminists from Simone de Beauvoir onwards had seen cinema as a key carrier of contemporary cultural myths through which our material existences are viewed and lived. This paper examines the various themes that have been pertinent to the female protagonist of Indian Cinema (particularly Hindi Cinema) and the diverse transformations that the cinematic representation of the woman in the apparently male-centric Indian Cinema has broadly gone through. The paper seeks to explain how the connotations of the sign ’woman’ have been operating in different guises within the Indian film texts over the last few decades- the meanings it has been made to bear and how has it disengaged and placed the dominant power structures; the paper is a fusion of feminist criticism and Film theory, with the basic premise being that it is not enough for cinema to merely offer more positive roles for women or for women to operate collectively to produce more realistic film images, for film making to be transformed. Instead, efforts must be made to disrupt the ideological fabric of conventional films. Instead of a mindless, complete and irrevocable reversal of men’s and woman’s roles in the movies, women should be portrayed as women- no more, no less. The movies cited in the paper are random and have been quoted to exemplify the essence of the theme in question. The paper seeks to explain how the connotations of the sign ’woman’ have been operating in different guises within the Indian film texts over the last few decades- the meanings it has been made to bear and how has it disengaged and placed the dominant power structures.\n\nCinemas can’t function in isolation. Either they are the reflection of the society or they tend to change the accepted social order by displaying the truth. The Indian Film industry is a multimillion-dollar industry and produces the highest number of films each year in the world. There have been some very good films which upheld the need to purge the Indian society of patriarchy but the greatest number of the mainstream cinemas instilled the idea of the male toxic hegemony which has led to the escalation of crime against women. In this paper I’ve chosen Indian cinemas and primarily mainstream Bollywood because they have a great impact over our society. If one is born in India then Bollywood has crept in his/her life at least once. The objective of this paper is to examine the effect of Bollywood films on society from a feminist perspective. Keywords: Patriarchy, Objectification of women, commodification of women, traditions, Indian cinema, Bollywood.\n\nTransaction from a play to a screenplay is indeed, more an exercise of critical insight than just pulling dialogues from the pages of a book. In any comparative study between a play and its filmic adaptation, it becomes essential to address the question: what is left out, added, and altered in the film and why? The objective of the study is to investigate that to what extent Gulzar’s Angoor – a cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare’s the Comedy of Errors has been indigenized or indianised, keeping in view the transcultural audiences. By de-historicizing the settings and time, deracialsing the characters and disembodying the events of the play from their immediate context, that is the sixteenth century England; Gulzar, the director of the film has indigenized the play and this makes his film an illustration of transcultural adaptation. The context has played a decisive role in conditioning the meanings. As a film has its own formation codes such as intricate interaction of mise-en-scen...\n\nCinema in India incorporates mainstream cinema which holds popular appeal, art or parallel cinema that deals with social issues, and middle and regional language cinema concerned with local issues. 'Bollywood' is a term associated with the Hindi-language film industry centered in Mumbai (Ganti, 2004). In this paper the term 'Bollywood' will refer specifically to the Hindi-language film industry. The justification of studying Hindi films is best provided by Dasgupta (1996) who saw in them a very popular form of art and literature. In terms of reach, they top the chart. Moreover, Bollywood has been a major point of reference for Indian culture (Bagchi, 1996). It has reflected the changing scenarios of modern India to an extent that no preceding art form has ever achieved. It is true that the portrayal of women characters in Bollywood has been studied by various scholars. Past studies, however, mainly focused on the portrayal of lead female characters, the stereotyping of women and the construction of women as good or bad. (Kishwar & Vanita, 1987; Gopalan, 1997, and Ganti, 2004). Survey of available literature suggested a paucity of studies to examine the extent to which these portrayals reflected the socio-political realities of their times. The present study aims to fill the gap. Also, there is a dearth of literature on the changing construction of female characters in Bollywood. By examining films from different time periods the present study aims to capture the changes in the depiction of lead female characters of Hindi films over time.\n\nCinema is meant and believed to entertain, to take the viewer to a world that is starkly different from the real one, a world which provides escape from the daily grind of life. Cinema is a popular media of mass consumption which plays a key role in moulding opinions, constructing images and reinforcing dominant cultural values. The paper deals with representations of women characters in mainstream Bollywood movies. It is deemed appropriate to examine this issue because women are a major chunk of the country’s population and hence their portrayal on screen is crucial in determining the furtherance of already existing stereotypes in the society. The paper begins with a discussion on the field of feminist film criticism and how mainstream Hindi Cinema has restricted itself to defined sketches of womanhood. It also undertakes some glimpses from popular films to analyse this process of stereotyping the ‘other’ – considering that reality in mainstream cinema is constructed from the male view point. A section is devoted to discussion on contemporary realistic brand of cinema and its understanding of women. In conclusion, a debate ensues on whether mainstream Hindi cinema has been successful in portraying Indian women of different shades in a society dominated by patriarchal values.
