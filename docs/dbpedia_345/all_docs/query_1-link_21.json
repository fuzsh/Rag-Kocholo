        "text": "I’m sitting in the non-air-conditioned lobby of Shahid Kapoor’s apartment building in Versova, sweating my nuts off.\n\nAn entryway to a posh high-rise with no A/C? This seems a bit outdated for a building that’s home to at least two Bollywood A-listers – Priyanka Chopra also lives here – but then again, the place has one lift for Members & Guests and one for Others.\n\nIn this heat, plain old water won’t do. I feel like I’m about to nod off, faint or at least nap, perchance to dream – under such meteorological duress – of beer. But even once we get upstairs to Shahid’s apartment a little while later, past a non-ironic “SK” monogram on the glass panel beside the door, there still won’t be any beer. The guy’s a total straightedge. Or so says the internet, where I’d also found Priyanka’s flat number. According to the same abomination of a website, Kapoor and Chopra do inter-floor booty calls.\n\nWhat I really want out of this meeting is to decode the online bollocks dipped in bullshit that have fused into a public persona akin to this: Shahid Kapoor is the most arrogant, difficult, time-wasting, womanizing, talented egomaniac in Bollywood.\n\nAnd he doesn’t drink, even on days like this.\n\nJust before the Bombay barometer pulls me under the hard-deck of consciousness, a late-model Benz SUV, half-Batmobile half-battering ram, pulls up to the entrance and out bounds our man, dressed in a V-neck white T-shirt and beige shorts, a pair of Aviators framing out a sorta-spiky hairdo, grown in after having shaved his pate to the wood for his turn in Haider, director Vishal Bhardwaj’s third re-jigging of Shakespeare after Maqbool (Macbeth) in 2004 and Omkara (Othello) in 2006.\n\n“Sorry to keep you waiting,” says Shahid, a few steps ahead of his scuttling entourage, hand out for a shake. In my woozy state, he’s a Top Gun-era Tom Cruise, but with a better tan. “I was with a director I’ve been meaning to meet for ages.”\n\n(Is that the “time-wasting, keeping people waiting forever” for which he’s been so scorned?)\n\nOnce we’re out the Members & Guests lift and into Shahid’s sky-high bachelor pad, the A/C is cranked and I sullenly accept a nimbu pani while Shahid tells me how fun it was doing the Lungi Dance with Kevin Spacey at the International Indian Film Academy Awards in Tampa.\n\nFirst impressions: He’s a friendly, chirpy, affable frat-boy type. Someone you’d want to play video games with on a Sunday, but keep the hell away from your sister.\n\n(All that “womanizing”…) This cat’s packing mojo fierce enough to have pulled babes like Piggy Chops and Kareena Kapoor.\n\nOn a wall-mounted shelf, I notice a copy of Kashmiri journalist Basharat Peer’s 2009 memoir, Curfewed Night, next to some Friends DVDs. Which bodes well for our conversation – the memoir, not the sitcom – because Basharat Peer wrote Haider’s screenplay, transposing the Denmark of Hamlet onto his native Kashmir.\n\nWhen I discussed the project with Peer, he was certain that everything had to play out in the mid-Nineties, a period in which he witnessed “all the major themes of Hamlet… The abuse of power, the betrayals, the destruction of family and that dark, portentous atmosphere.”\n\nBhardwaj tells me that he approached Peer in Delhi last April about setting his latest Shakespeare installation in Kashmir, but the director wasn’t sure if he wanted to adapt Hamlet or King Lear. All it took was a quick recall of there being “something rotten in the state of Denmark” for Peer to say, “It has to be Hamlet”. And before a full first draft was complete, Bhardwaj was convinced it was Shahid who had to do it.\n\nInside Shahid’s bedroom, a couple dozen pairs of shoes and sneakers are lined up under the wall-to-wall windows that frame the last nub of Versova. But he’s moving out soon to a new house in Juhu that he’s furbished with a soundproof nightclub-type space that has its own entrance so people can still party while he’s not there. DJing, he says, is something that snuck up on him after a trip to Ibiza a few years ago, and he certainly didn’t hesitate to get behind the decks with DJ Ankytrixx at GQ’s Best-Dressed party in June. Now he’ll have his own private club to test-run his sets.\n\n“It took me four years to find that place,” he laughs. “Brokers just about stopped calling me back.”\n\n(Is this Shahid “being difficult”?)\n\nWe settle into the living room couch, and Shahid pops a Ricola mint into his mouth before lighting up a Benson & Hedges, tapped out after each few drags into an ashtray shaped like a squat toilet. “It was a very original experience, being in Kashmir and shooting the film,” he says. “I think this is probably the first time in many, many years, maybe ever, that an entire Hindi film has been shot in Kashmir… Being there for 50 days was a huge part of understanding the film, as well as what I’m representing or showcasing.”\n\nHaider’s dialogue is spoken in region-inflected Hindi, not unlike the way a script set in a non-English-speaking region would be spoken in a British accent. Nothing culturally oppressive about that, but the Bollywood crew arrived in the Valley to a spot of controversy. A group of students protested to raising the Indian tricolour for a scene at the University of Kashmir, and shooting was cut short. Another day, someone lobbed a kangri on to the set, motive unclear, landing somewhere between Shahid and Irrfan Khan. But there was also, while shooting in Anantnag, cries of “We love you Shahid-bhai!” and “Gandi Baaaaaat!” from gathered onlookers.\n\nThere’s always going to be baggage tied to a celebrity like Shahid Kapoor. This morning, for example, when it was reported that a female fan who’d run away from her job as a teacher in West Bengal was picked up near the gates of this building, god only knowing what she’d do if she actually caught hold of her film idol.\n\n(It’s sometimes easy to forget that part of Shahid’s gossip-composite persona is that he’s “a talented actor”.)\n\n“Were you worried about playing Hamlet, the most loaded role in the world?” I ask.\n\n“Yeah man,” answers Shahid, exhaling smoke over lower incisors familiarly tinged to the exercise, “it makes you feel very inept. You keep questioning whether you have the capacity to play the character because there are so many layers.”\n\nWhat I’m still trying to figure out is how Hamlet’s archetypal family dynamic of the uncle murdering the father to marry the wife, the son then plotting revenge on the uncle, fits into the political jigsaw of the Valley. Like the conflict itself, clarity is as fleeting and amorphous as King Hamlet’s posthumous cameos in the play, though if this particular ur-motif is to be employed in Haider’s Kashmir, it shouldn’t have been difficult to find the ghost of an unjustly murdered father or two.\n\nWhen I enquire about any meta-thematic meshings of the two H’s, Shahid is quick to remind me that Haider is an adaptation, not straight-up Hamlet, so he didn’t need to study the play or anything.\n\nEarlier in the week, I asked Shraddha Kapoor, who plays a young Kashmiri journalist in the film, about boning up on the Bard to prepare. “I studied Shakespeare in school,” she told me, “but I’ve completely forgotten it. In a way that’s good, because then you don’t get into any preconceived notions. But in a way it’s bad as well, because I should have been a bit familiar with it.”\n\n“CliffsNotes?” I’d suggested. She answered by blinking in silence.\n\nWhen the film drops on October 2, even if Shahid feels his adaptive performance measures up to those who’ve gone full-Hamlet on celluloid before him – Laurence Olivier, Kenneth Brannagh and to lesser degrees Mel Gibson and Ethan Hawke – there are taller hurdles for Haider. The star reportedly waived his fee for the film. If this is true and Haider ends up being a stinker, our boy is going to be out some serious cheese. Not the ideal way to start that DJing career.\n\nIn an industry where second chances are rarer than big breaks, 2009’s Kaminey, also directed by Bhardwaj, was already Shahid’s comeback, and since then it’s been a wobbly stack of movies and periods of radio silence. When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions.\n\n“Is this a comeback film?” I ask.\n\nShahid leans back into the couch, drawing a pattern on the ceiling with his eyes, breathing out a spume of cigarette smoke. “I wouldn’t say it’s a comeback movie, but I would say it’s me returning to a space after three or four years – cinema which is not in-your-face commercial, entertainment-oriented.”\n\nTo Shahid’s credit, his recent falling out with favour is one facet of The Movie Star persona (He’s supposed to be an “egomaniac”, isn’t he?) that goes uncontested when addressing his career’s latest walk through the wilderness.\n\n“I’m comfortable and happy with the journey I’ve taken,” he says, getting pensive. “It’s been up and down, and that balances you out, gives you a larger perspective.”\n\nMy immediate instinct is to come up with a wisecrack, but he has a point. Back in the hallway he leads me towards the lift. As we wait for it to arrive, I look out towards the sea, roiling away out there under the first arc of the moist star. It’s going to rain.\n\n“Maybe that helps to play Hamlet,” Shahid smiles, “all that wilderness.”\n\nFrom the September 2014 issue of GQ India.
