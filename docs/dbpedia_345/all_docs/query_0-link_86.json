        "text": "30 Road Trip Hindi Songs to Ad in Your Travel Playlist\n\nWhat's a journey without a soundtrack? No soft melody transporting you down the whirlpool of memories as you gaze through the windshield of a car, train or flight even? How would the vibe in that car full of friends be, if there were no loud songs playing to sing along with till everyone ends up with sore throats?\n\nMusic while travelling is as necessary as your travel kit of essentials. There is the constantly updated playlist for every day, and then there is the list of all-time Bollywood favourites. But, when it comes to travel some songs have to be on your playlist. We've compiled a list which is a motley mix of old and new that we think should be in every traveller's playlist. We would love to know yours! Let us know your favourite travel songs in the comments!\n\nHere is a list of road-trip Hindi songs to make your next trip memorable:\n\nWe went ahead and made the complete list on Spotify for you here - Holidify's Road Trip Playlist.\n\n1. Yunhi Chala Chal (Swades)\n\nIf you're treading along the lesser travelled roads of India, make sure you have this song on your playlist to keep your spirits up when you are squashed in a bus full of locals. Bonus fun if you can find a 'baba' to sing along on the trip.\n\n2. Dil Chahta Hai (Title Track)\n\nIt's hard to leave this one of the list. Farhan Akhtar's 2001 debut film is when travel took a front seat in a Bollywood film than just as a backdrop to a scene. Dil Chahta Hai in our opinion will always remain the ultimate hindi travel song for road trips, especially if during from Mumbai to Goa through the Konkan coast, where this song was shot.\n\n3. Khwabon Ke Parindey (ZNMD)\n\nExactly ten years later, Farhan Akhtar's sister Zoya comes out with an extension of the road trip vibe movie, only this time on a much larger scale. As a result, we have a film that not only has travel as the central theme but inspires you to travel. Haven't you all tried waving your hand against the wind, as Hrithik did?\n\n4. Tanha Dil (Shaan)\n\nA song for the solo travellers, to get lost in nostalgia; Shaan's voice has swooned us for years and this song is just one of his best. What's more, the music video features Shaan himself!\n\n5. Suhana Safar Aur Ye (Madhumati)\n\nThere is a reason why 'old is gold', it's because of classics like this song. From the 1958 movie Madhumati, picturized on Dilip Kumar and Vyjantimala, the tune is so melodious you can't help but hum along with it - A must add on your list of road trip songs.\n\n6. Hum Jo Chalne Lage (Jab We Met)\n\nWhile solo travels are bliss but having someone along with you to share the journey makes it so much more worthwhile. This beautiful song speaks of just that, even a mundane journey becomes exciting when you share it with someone special.\n\n7. Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana (Andaaz)\n\nA classic again, this time from 1971's Andaaz, sang by the legendary Kishore Kumar? remember the? yodelling?? You can't not have this song on your playlist, hum away! Or 'yodel' if you may!\n\n8. Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara (Jewel Thief)\n\nAnother of Kishore Kumar's best songs, add to that the evergreen Dev Anand's classic strut and you can't help but tap your feet to tunes of S.D. Burman's music while taking in the scenic beauty of the trip. We wholeheartedly approve that this song be added to the greatest list of best hindi travel songs ever.\n\n9. Aaj Kal Zindagi (Wake up Sid)\n\nWhether you're trying to scale the Mt. Everest or take a plunge in the Arabian Sea, this feel-good song is all the pep talk you need. From the movie Wake up Sid, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's beautiful composition!\n\n10. Ilahi (YJHD)\n\nAdmit it, you wished for Bunny aka Kabir aka Ranbir's life in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani. You repeated this dialogue, \"Main udna chahta hoon, daudna chahta hoon, girna bhi chahta hoon bus rukhna nahi chahta\", to anyone who asked you why you want to travel!\n\n11. Patakha Guddi (Highway)\n\nThis song from Highway won everyone's heart with its catchy lyrics and music and awesome video showing an actual road-trip! Put on your headphones, turn up the volume and take a lift on the back of a truck for the best experience.\n\n13. Musafir Hoon Yaaron\n\nNa ghar hai, na thikaana.. Sounds like your soul on a trip? Well, it is the reason why it appears on this list. While new numbers are all funky and peppy, nothing beats the charm of Kishore Kumar's voice on the road!\n\n14. Hai Apna Dil Toh Awara - Solva Saal\n\nOne of the best songs to bounce to, this number so aptly reverberates with the ethos of our generation, that it is impossible to not be in love with. All the more so when we have our travelling boots on! It is surely one of the best Hindi travel songs from the bygone era.\n\n15. Kabira (Ye Jawani Hai Deewani)\n\nBunny was pretty nomadic, and boy wasn't his life awesome! Kabira is perfect for when you're leaving a tiny part of your heart in a new place and are dealing with all the blues of separation.\n\nYou can also check out this Playlist of English Travel Songs\n\n16. Azaadiyan (Udaan)\n\nStrict mucchhadd dad, cute son, a cuter younger son, and a lovely song all about freedom. The travel playlist is just incomplete without this contemporary classic from Bollywood.\n\n17. Oh Gujaria (Queen)\n\nFree, fun and lively, Gujariya from Queen is one of those songs that will make your head bounce back and let you soak in the joy of the lovely beats! What's more, it celebrates your aawaarapan! Perfect road-trip song; isn't it?\n\n18. Chhod Aaye Hum Wo Galiyaan (Maachis)\n\nThe moment you lace on your trainers and lock the gate to your nest, the sense of independence that takes over is just too awesome, right? For spurring that feeling, make sure this one is there on your playlist when you plug in your headphones.\n\n19. Kyon (Barfi)\n\nThey say love is the fountain of life. What if you find love around fountains? Or waterfalls? Or the beach, or hills, or anything at all? Well, it's here to stay. Falling for a travel companion is awesome because there'll never be boring Sundays after that. Or, you could just listen to this one and marvel at that feeling!\n\n20. Dekha Hai Aisa Bhi - Lucky Ali\n\nA waylaid breeze, a road trip, and this blasting in your car? Isn't that the mantra for a great holiday! Last I heard, Lucky Ali was listed as a community favourite among us. We're sure you shall like the guy too!\n\n21. Chala Jaata Hoon Kisi Ki Dhun Mein (Mere Jeevan Saathi)\n\nKishore Kumar and Rajesh Khanna fans around? Well you'll love this one!\n\n22. Hairat (Anjaana Anjaani)\n\nEven if you're not going on a road trip to Las Vegas anytime soon (as shown in the movie), this energetic number can charge you up for any road trip!\n\n23. Safarnama (Tamasha)\n\nSafarnama literally means \"travelogue\". When you feel like getting all philosophical and emotional in your trip, do listen to this song.\n\n24. Banjarey (Fugly)\n\nWith you are riding around with your gang like nomads, this song will add on to the vibe of your trip.\n\n25. Chota Sa Fasana (Karwaan)\n\nAnother one for your nomadic soul!\n\n26. Phid Se Ud Chala (Rockstar)\n\nRanbir Kapoor arguably gave one of his finest performances in Rockstar. This song by Mohit Chauhan will leave you breathless with its melodious riffs. It just goes to show that it doesn't take much more than a soothing voice and well thought out lyrics to make a great song.\n\n27. Journey Song (Piku)\n\nWhen a song's name itself tells you it is meant for the roads there is little to do but to add it to your playlist. Taken from the outstanding film 'Piku', Anupam Roy's earthy voice alongside the sweetest of voices of Shreya Ghosal lends this song an ethereal vibe.\n\n28. Sooraj Dooba Hain (Roy)\n\nWhile the film may not have gone down well with the audience, some of its songs surely did. This upbeat banger sung by Arijit Singh ticks all the right boxes about self-love, forgetting your worries and living your best.\n\n29. Maeri - Euphoria\n\nThis olden song introduced a lot of us to Palash Sen's voice and made us fall in love with Euphoria. Till date, it remains an evergreen classic from the 90s and where better than to put it on the list of Hindi travel songs.\n\n30. Udd Gaye (Bacardi House Party Sessions) - Ritviz\n\nThe greatest party song ever in our honest opinion, this banger by Ritviz goes at weddings, nightclubs, and most importantly on that road trip with friends.\n\nYou can also check out this Playlist of English Travel Songs\n\nSo let us know what do you think about our list?
