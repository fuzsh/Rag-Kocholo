        "text": "He debuted in ‘Udta Punjab’ where he made an impression on the audience. He worked in ‘Hotel Mumbai’ with Dev Patel. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival 2018 and received positive feedback for its portrayal of the terrorist attack at Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai.\n\nThe casting director, Honey sir, saw me at another audition where I was dressed as a rapper. He told me to audition for the movie where most of the dialogues were in Punjabi. I remember asking if it a Punjabi movie.\n\nI soon started working with Shahid Kapoor and it was a good experience. He’s such a good actor and very giving. As a debutant and my first Bollywood film, I think I gave it my absolute best.\n\nIt was the best experience of my life because it was treated sensitively and the research was so strong. I never felt that it was an Australian who was directing and that the actors were from Hollywood.\n\nI am always very happy when I am on sets. I love being on a film set. I love shooting and I am grateful. In 2008, when I was in Delhi, I used to dream of this life. I used to wonder if this will ever happen to me and how I would go about it since I didn’t know anyone. I didn’t know anything about the city and about working with people here. To be where I am now, it feels great. There’s never a dull moment on sets!\n\nMusic is one of my biggest interests. I play the piano, write poetry and even rap sometimes. I understand the different nuances of music. If I had a good voice, I would have probably become a singer instead of an actor!"
