        "text": "The incident took place at the Star Screen Awards\n\n\"It was an understanding that Shahid will perform because he was bagging the award. He had rehearsed for the performance too,\" a source told Pinkvilla. Notably, the incident took place at the Star Screen Awards that were held in Mumbai on Sunday. In fact, prior to the event, Shahid had even joined Ranveer on the red carpet for a photoshoot, before things went south.\n\nEventually, Ranveer won Best Actor, Entertainer of the Year awards\n\nHowever, contrary to the plan, it was Ranveer who was eventually given the Best Actor award for Gully Boy. Additionally, he also took home the Entertainer of the Year award. Upset over the development, Shahid canceled his performance and walked out of the event. \"Shahid apparently lost his cool on organizers because it was unprofessional to sneakily change the whole scenario,\" the source added.\n\nDouble whammy, penned Ranveer, after bagging the awards\n\nThereafter, Varun Dhawan filled in as Shahid's replacement\n\nAfter Shahid's exit, show organizers started looking for a quick replacement to fill up the performance slot for the final edit. Reportedly, Varun Dhawan came to their rescue, by agreeing to perform. \"Varun saved the day by committing to this event. He agreed to come in late and shoot his song. Varun danced to a song from Street Dancer 3D,\" a source told NDTV.\n\nShahid and Ranveer have shared screen space in 'Padmaavat'\n\nTo recall, Shahid and Ranveer have worked together in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period drama movie Padmaavat (2018). Previously, there were rumors that the two were engaged in a feud during the shoot of the film. However, both the actors later brushed off the speculations.\n\nShahid will soon star in a Hindi remake of 'Jersey'"
