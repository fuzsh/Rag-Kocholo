        "text": "Step out on Kolkata’s streets on July 21 and you will be greeted by a festive mood, people in high spirits, music and good food. The uninitiated may mistakenly think that Pujo has arrived early, when, in fact, it is the ruling Trinamool Congress party’s annual Shahid Diwas, or Martyr’s Day rally.\n\nHere’s your trivia of the day: India observes not one, not two, but seven Martyr’s Days to honour the braves who laid down their lives during the freedom struggle. The most prominent among these is January 30, which is observed as Shahid Diwas to mark the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile these occasions are usually sombre affairs, the TMC’s Shahid Diwas is an all-out celebration that draws millions of party workers and supporters from all corners of West Bengal. It is a tribute to the 13 people who were killed in police firing at a rally of the Youth Congress in communist-ruled Kolkata on July 21, 1993.\n\nThis year, a mega rally led by TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is planned in the Esplanade area. Hundreds of thousands of cadres have flocked to the city ahead of the big day and are being hosted in temporary camps at Gitanjali Stadium, Khudiram Anushilan Kendra, Central Park and other locations. Elaborate traffic arrangements and tight security are in place for today’s flagship political event.\n\nREAD | Your blood will never go in vain: Mamata Banerjee's video message ahead of Martyr's Day\n\nExcitement is palpable among TMC workers. The Shahid Diwas rally is being held after a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19. Moreover, the party is planning to hold the rally in a much bigger way a mega celebration to commemorate its thumping victory in last year’s state assembly polls.\n\nHere’s why Shahid Diwas holds significance for the Trinamool Congress and its chief, Mamata Banerjee:\n\nThe 21 July Martyr's Day Rally is an annual mass rally organised by the TMC to commemorate the 1993 Kolkata firing. At least 13 people were shot by the city police and scores more were wounded during a rally by the West Bengal Youth Congress under Mamata Banerjee's leadership on July 21, 1993.\n\nIn 1993, the party in power in Bengal was the Jyoti Basu-led Communist Party of India (Marxist), while Mamata Banerjee was the Opposition leader. The July 21 rally was the Writers Chalo Abhijaan, a city-wide stir called by the Youth Congress to demand that Voter's Identity Card be made the sole required document for voting.\n\nIt was planned that Youth Congress workers would move towards Writers' Building from different directions and lay siege to the state secretariat. The government deployed a huge cop posting to ensure law and order and deter the demonstrators. Section 144 was also clamped.\n\nAfter drawing a huge crowd by addressing a rally at Brigade Parade Ground, Mamata Banerjee and Youth Congress functionaries located at five different points in the city began their march to the Writers' Building.\n\nMamata Banerjee and her band of supporters, who were coming down Brabourne Road, were stopped by a strong contingent of police near the Tea Board office. A peaceful march soon devolved into pandemonium as Kolkata Police personnel beat up party workers and fired tear gas shells.\n\nAs nimble as she is fiery, Mamata Banerjee climbed on top of a traffic post and attempted to pacify her supporters. Angry policemen surrounded the traffic post but Youth Congress workers shielded Banerjee by forming a protective ring around her. They were beaten back and blue. Banerjee was also beaten up and collapsed on the ground.\n\nSimilar scenes were witnessed at the crossing of Mayo Road and Red Road. Scuffles broke out and some people chucked stones, injuring a few policemen. Police resorted to lathicharge and tear gas shelling to disperse the crowd, but Youth Congress workers refused to back down. Police opened fire, killing 13 people. According to TMC leader Saugata Roy, over 200 Youth Congress workers were wounded in the police action.\n\nThe incident was a galvanizing moment in Mamata Banerjee’s political life. Already a rising star in the public arena, she garnered huge sympathy from the masses after being hurt in the July 21 melee. More and more people rallied around her and she went on to float her own political party, the Trinamool Congress, in 1998.\n\nAfter she became the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2011, Banerjee set up an inquiry into the 1993 police firing. In its report, the commission said the police action was “unprovoked and unconstitutional” and that officers had “overacted to please their political bosses. It also ordered compensation of Rs 25 lakh to the families of the deceased.\n\nNow, nearly 30 years later, Mamata Banerjee continues to remember her comrades who fell in the violence on July 21, 1993 and honours the martyrs and their families on this day every year.\n\nPublished By:\n\nDevika Bhattacharya\n\nPublished On:\n\nJul 21, 2022\n\n--- ENDS ---"
