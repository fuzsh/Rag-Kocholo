Shahid Kapoor has garnered an astounding number of accolades and nominations during his professional acting career. This success leads to a lot of money, and Shahid Kapoor's home has the luxury that truly aligns with his superstar status in the film industry.\n\nShahid Kapoor's Legendary Family Background\n\nShahid Kapoor's father, Pankaj Kapoor, his mother, actress Neelima Kapoor, and stepmother, Supriya Pathak, are well-known in the entertainment industry and live in a different residence and visit Shahid Kapoor new house often. He has three siblings: Ishaan Khattar, Ruhaan Kapoor, and Sanah Kapoor. He is the youngest of the three, and he is the eldest of the three brothers. He has four brothers and a sister, all of them are members of his family. On July 7, 2015, in Mumbai, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput exchanged wedding vows. In 2016, the couple welcomed their only daughter, Misha Kapoor, who was also the couple's first child.\n\nInside Mira Rajput and Shahid Kapoor Residence in Mumbai\n\nShahid Kapoor, after the box office success of \"Padmavat,\" invested in a luxurious residence in Mumbai's Three Sixty West high-rise. This architectural marvel, built by Oasis Realty in collaboration with Oberoi Realty and Sahana Development Corporation, boasts a stunning view of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The building, crafted by Kohn Pedersen Fox, is set to be India's second-highest residential structure. Shahid's spacious 8,625 sq ft home, offering cutting-edge design, promises tranquility and an artistic interior. Previously, the couple spent Rs 30 crore on this property, highlighted by scenic sea views, evident from their Instagram shares.\n\nThe Luxurious Shahid Kapoor House Juhu\n\nShahid Kapoor's sea-facing Juhu home boasts a modern design enriched by dark tones, wooden furnishings, and eclectic accents, like a fireplace and pool. Their residence features a wooden patio offering stunning countryside views, especially during sunset. This spot, evident from their social media shares, seems to be the couple's favorite. Moreover, glimpses of their interiors are showcased on their Instagram. They've also consulted interior designer Gauri Khan for potential collaborations, as highlighted on her Instagram with the caption, \"Perfect setting for my new collection with Shahid and Mira.\"\n\nShahid Kapoor House Pics Reveal the Chic and Artsy Interior\n\nAn ivory and blue throw pillow complete the overall aesthetic of the area of shahidâ€™s Kapoor new home. The Kapoors' wooden patio is designed in a verandah. It includes a large grass-covered middle portion, a combination of high and low seating, and ivory and blue cushions to complete the overall look. Natural features such as potted plants and flowers are combined with a sleek and contemporary design to create a quiet outside hideaway that is congruent with the rest of the property.\n\nThe Kapoors have been spotted enjoying this aspect of the Shahid Kapoor house on various occasions in recent years, including quiet Sunday mornings with their daughters Misha and Zain Kapoor and big occasions such as birthday parties and weddings receptions. When Rajput Kapoor is at home, this is the spot where he goes to the gym to work out.\n\nAccording to the household, the space is also used as a playground for the Kapoors' three-year-old daughter Misha Kapoor, and it is large enough to accommodate a swing, an inflatable pool, and a trampoline when required.\n\nOne such instance is a photograph uploaded on Instagram by Rajput Kapoor showing her daughter participating in a quick dancing session with her grandma. And that's not all; there's much more! For important events, Shahid and Mira Rajput Kapoor also spruce up their patio, which they use regularly. The family decorates the outdoor eating area of Shahid Kapoor's bungalow with rows of marigolds, which are also strung together with a string of fairy lights for alfresco dining during the festival of lights.\n\nIn their living area of the Shahid Kapoor house, they have carried over the minimalist style of their patio, which is ornamented with dark wood pieces and a subdued colour palette that compliments it. An all-black and all-white colour palette are used throughout the space, which is supplemented with eye-catching elements such as huge mirrors, warm yellow lighting, and edgy wire chairs. Because the centre table and surrounding seats are positioned low, the whole living room may be opened up to the outside world very soon after being constructed.\n\nThis is supported by the fact that Shahid and Mira Rajput Kapoor's house has a lot of book storage space, indicating that they are voracious readers. The living room also has an unexpectedly stunning abstract artwork that hangs behind the sofa, a knotted grey cushion, and an orange rug with an unusually vibrant hue of orange.\n\nThe Shahid Kapoor house inside the bedroom is filled with personal touches that make it seem like a home. Aside from the valuables, such as bicycle bookends, candles, and an hourglass, that have been put on one of the shelf walls, our favourite feature of the home is the wall covered with polaroids of the couple's most memorable moments. Aside from that, the Kapoors' bedroom is designed in a dark colour scheme, which gives the area a cosier vibe than the couple's living room.\n\nThereâ€™s no doubt that Shahid Kapoorâ€™s house is luxurious, lavish, stylish, and one of India's most valuable celebrity properties. When one looks at the interior design, one can sense that Shahid and Mira Kapoor are in love with all things white!
