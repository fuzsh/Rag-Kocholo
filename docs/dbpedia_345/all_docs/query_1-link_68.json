        "text": "Shahid Kapoor has grabbed headlines after his private travel plans leaked online. A snapshot of the actor’s detailed itinerary surfaced on various social media platforms, quickly spreading like wildfire and garnering widespread attention. Fans were seen reacting to it and standing in favour of Shahid.\n\nInstant Bollywood shared the travel itinerary on their handle. The itinerary showcased a packed schedule in which Shahid Kapoor will jet off from Mumbai to Delhi before heading overseas to Tokyo, then Sydney, followed by a transcontinental leap to New York, Paris, Istanbul, and back to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. He favoured Vistara for his flights within India, opting for United Airlines and Japan Airways for his international segments. He opted for InterContinental, The Doubtless Bay, and Six Senses for hotels. In his notes, Shahid expresses a preference for overnight flights when traveling long distances, while for shorter distances, he opts for early morning flights. Additionally, he choose First Class or Business Class for added comfort during these flights.\n\nTake a look here:\n\nAs soon as the itinerary was shared, fans flooded the comment section. One of the fans wrote, “Isn’t it wrong to share this on public platform acc to celebrities security concern???” Another wrote, “This should be deleted as this could sadly cause a safety issue, what if he is threatened with kidnap etc.”\n\nRecently, Shahid shared a dangerous-looking photo in which Shahid flaunted his chiselled body. In no time it went viral and fans were seen reacting to it. Many dropped heart emojis in the comment section. Taking to his Instagram handle, Shahid just wrote D for the caption. The photo is black and white and he is seen showing his perfect body from the back. One of the fans wrote, “Deva looking Dangerous.” Another wrote, “D se bole toh DEVA.” Recently, he also shared a photo in which he was seen understanding what his director was saying.\n\nThe actor took to Instagram to announce his new film on the occasion of Dusssehra last year. He also shared the first look in which Shahid appeared to be playing the role of a police officer in the movie. In the photo, Shahid was seen flaunting his short hairdo while holding a gun in his hand. The actor sported a bracelet and wore a half-button shirt with a pair of khakee pants. Shahid completed his look with a pair of sunglasses that reminded us of Kabir Singh. Sharing the photo, Shahid revealed that he is locking Dussehra 2024 for Deva. “DEVA in theatres on Dussehra 11th October 2024,” he wrote. The film also stars Pooja Hegde."
