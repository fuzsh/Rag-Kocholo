Investors have many apprehensions when it comes to investing. Attending the IPV Connect event held in Mumbai on June 14, 2024, was an eye-opener at various levels. Listening to tips on allaying those apprehensions through a scintillating conversation between Vinay Bansal and Ankur Mittal, ably moderated by Rajiv Indimath, here is what I picked up: 🔰 You need to get involved to understand this sector 🔰 Take baby steps - observe, listen, read, and learn 🔰 Experiment with small amounts 🔰 Follow your passion and interest - for instance, agri and health tech startups interest me the most because I am fascinated with the impact innovative ideas in this field can do 🔰 Get out of your comfort zone and network with other investors 𝗜 𝗮𝗺 𝗻𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿.
