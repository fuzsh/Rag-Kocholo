        "text": "Udta Punjab is currently the eighth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. But a month ago, the makers of the film worried if it would ever release, due to censorship issues. BBC Asian Network's Haroon Rashid speaks to Bollywood actors and writers about creative freedom and censorship in India.\n\nThe Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) had asked the Udta Punjab filmmakers to make 94 cuts, including removal of expletives, references to cities in Punjab and any shots of drugs being consumed, ironically in a film about drug abuse.\n\nBut Anurag Kashyup and other producers decided to challenge the CBFC's order in a Mumbai court, which eventually allowed the film's release with just one cut - a shot of lead actor Shahid Kapoor's character urinating in a crowd.\n\n\"I must confess that I was aware that it was not going to be easy to get [the film] out there. But I didn't anticipate the amount of conflict we would have to go through,\" Kapoor told the BBC.\n\nBut he added that \"the controversy helped the film\" because many Indians used social media outlets to show their support for creative freedom in India.\n\n\"The film got leaked two days before it was set for release but we still had people going into the theatres, which is amazing,\" he said.\n\nThe dispute has even gripped university professors in India.\n\nSome business schools are now using Udta Punjab as an example of how a public row can help drive interest in a film and raise awareness about a social issue.\n\nBut will one film's victory be enough to prevent heavy-handed censorship in the future? Actress Alia Bhatt said more steps were needed to ensure complete creative freedom.\n\nShe added that the \"interpretation of the 1952 cinematography law\" creates problems because \"it's a bit vague and can be interpreted in any way\".\n\nShe argued that the law has to be changed.\n\n\"As an adult, you're allowed to vote, you're allowed to drink, you're allowed to get married, then how can you not be allowed to view cuss words, or abusive words, or a kissing scene, or bloodshed or any of that on screen?\" she asked.\n\nJaved Akhtar, co-writer of cult films like Sholay, said we shouldn't view Udta Punjab \"as a one off case\".\n\n\"Censorship in India has always been quite erratic and quite irrational and ad hoc,\" he said.\n\nLast year, the CBFC asked the producers of Hindi thriller NH10 to shorten the duration of a violent scene that showed honour killing, had the word \"lesbian\" muted in romantic comedy Dum Laga Ke Haisha and banned erotic romance Fifty Shades of Grey despite the producers offering to make cuts.\n\nThe board also shortened the duration of two kissing scenes in Daniel Craig's Spectre, external before giving it an adult certification.\n\nAkhtar argued that the board needs better people to avoid these incidents.\n\n\"People who are from the arts, people who are from the theatre, people who are familiar with literature and drama should be on the panel,\" he said.\n\n\"Today, we have the biggest advantage of social media and the public opinion is the most important thing anywhere in the world. So I'm ready to fight if there's anything like [censorship],\" he said.\n\nAnil Kapoor's confidence comes partly from the growth of the internet and streaming services like Netflix in South Asia.\n\n\"We have the digital format platform now, so there is a possibility that I might make it [the series] for the digital platform,\" he said.\n\nBut \"moral policing\" has been noticeable online in India too. In February 2015, viral stand-up comedy group AIB took down a \"comedy roast show\" from YouTube, featuring Bollywood stars, after complaints of vulgar language.\n\nNonetheless, there have been fewer cases compared with films. Instead, several top Bollywood stars, including Deepika Padukone, Shah Rukh Khan and Bhatt, have been involved in creating original content for the internet which has been received positively.\n\nBut is going online the best way of tackling the CBFC or is it just avoiding the issue all together?\n\nWith Bollywood film makers becoming braver and bolder with their subject matter, the battle between certification and censorship is not going away anytime soon."
