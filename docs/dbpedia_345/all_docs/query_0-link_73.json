        "text": "MUMBAI: Star Plus has ventured into an unexplored territory and brings for the audience its new show Advocate Anjali Awasthi, starring Shritama Mitra (Advocate Anjali Awasthi) and Ankit Raizada (Aman Singh Rajpoot). The show is produced by Blues Productions.\n\nThe makers of the show Advocate Anjali Awasthi treated the audience with its first glimpse, which showcases the journey of Advocate Anjali Awasthi, who wants to be a successful lawyer but must tackle challenges and difficulties that stand in the way of achieving her aspirations. The audience will also witness Anjali's grit and spirit and determination to fight against injustice in order to mend her family's tarnished image. In her first case, Advocate Anjali Awasthi, a struggling advocate who evolves into a legal genius while restoring her father's disgrace, takes on a powerful and extremely corrupt lawyer.\n\nAdvocate Anjali Awasthi is a strong and fearless character; she craves recognition for her genius, and this will surely compel the audience to root for her cause—justice for the downtrodden.\n\nAnkit Raizada will be seen portraying the character of Aman Singh Rajpoot in the show Advocate Anjali Awasthi along with Shritama Mitra. Ankit's portrayal of the vibrant and free-spirited Aman Singh Rajpoot is definitely going to win the hearts of the viewers. In order to attain perfection for his portrayal of Aman, Ankit Raizada has taken inspiration from some famous characters from Bollywood iconic films like Shah Rukh Khan (Raj) from the film Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and Shahid Kapoor (Aditya Kashyap) from the film Jab We Met. It will be interesting and intriguing to witness Ankit Raizada imbibing these characteristics from Shah Rukh Khan and Shahid Kapoor.\n\nAnkit Raizada, aka Aman Singh Rajpoot, in the Star Plus show Advocate Anjali Awasthi shares, \"Adapting to Aman Singh Rajpoot was a rewarding experience. I drew inspiration from classic Bollywood characters like Shah Rukh Khan’s Raj in “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” and Shahid Kapoor’s character in “Jab We Met.” Both characters have a charming, fun-loving nature and a strong sense of family, which helped me shape Aman. I also looked at everyday people who are kind-hearted and selfless. This mix helped me bring Aman to life as a genuine and relatable character. Aman Singh Rajpoot is quite relatable to me as Ankit Raizada. While Aman is a fun-loving and caring character with a strong sense of family, I find parallels in how I approach relationships and life in general. His positive outlook, dedication to family, and romantic side—his ability to bring warmth and affection into his relationships—are traits that resonate with me personally. The romantic aspects of Aman’s character, such as his genuine love and care for his partner, reflect values and emotions I also connect with. While his experiences are unique to the show, the essence of Aman's character and his approach to love and relationships mirror aspects of my own life.\"\n\nProduced by Blues Productions, Advocate Anjali Awasthi will air today at 8.45pm on Star Plus."
