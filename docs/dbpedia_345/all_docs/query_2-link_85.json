        "text": "Shahid Kapoor is one of the Bollywood stars who adapted to the rise of OTT among Indian audiences. With superhit series like Farzi and Bloody Daddy, Shahid took the digital world by storm and left fans wanting more. At a recent event, he was asked by a fan if he had signed any more OTT projects yet. While Shahid said that he didn’t have more OTT projects lined up, he will return to the medium for the second season of his hit series Farzi.\n\nSpeaking at Pinkvilla’s Masterclass, Shahid said, “Free me dekhna hai? Theatre ke paise bachaane hai? Thoda toh kharch karaunga. (Do you want to watch it for free? Want to save money on theatre tickets? I will make you spend at least a little).”\n\nHe then continued, “So of course, the second season of Farzi will happen. I mean, the response was amazing. Also, the way the story ended, it was open-ended so there is an opportunity for a lot more to happen. It was not like a culmination. So Farzi 2 will happen, and if anything else I like, I will, but as of now, I haven’t said yes to anything for OTT because I had two releases this year, so I’m going to do some stuff for theatres now. But Farzi 2 will definitely happen.”\n\nFarzi marked Shahid Kapoor’s OTT debut. Directed by Raj and DK, the black comedy crime thriller also featured Vijay Sethupathi, Kay Kay Menon, Raashii Khanna and Bhuvan Arora in key roles. The series was released on Amazon Prime Video in February earlier this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Shahid will next be seen alongside Kriti Sanon for his upcoming yet-to-be-titled project. Produced by Dinesh Vijan for the banner Maddock Studios, the romantic comedy film is scheduled to be released during the Valentine’s Day weekend in 2024."
