        "text": "It is a high possibility that a mini Kabir Singh-Preeti reunion aka Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani's meet-up has happened in Mumbai. The duo, who played the iconic characters in the superhit 2019 film, happen to be great buddies. The latest photo posted by Kiara suggests that she visited Shahid and Mira at their house. If the photo wasn't enough, the comments by the husband-wife duo on Kiara's pic surely leave us excited for the next set of photos to come.\n\nKiara Advani might have visited Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput at their Mumbai apartment. The actor's latest photo has her casually sipping some tea from a fancy cup. However, the aesthetic background of the frame is similar to a background seen in one of Shahid's reels. However, Kiara hasn't confirmed whether she was actually at Shahid-Mira's house.\n\nOn Kiara's photo, Shahid commented, \"That sofa is very familiar\". His wife Mira Rajput posted, \"To be continued (sic)\". Varun Dhawan also complimented Kiara's sunnies.\n\nTake a look:\n\nAlso, take a look at Shahid's reel, which offers a glimpse into a similar-looking balcony in the backdrop:\n\nAlso, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput were one of Kiara Advani's select guests from the film industry to be a part of the latter's wedding in 2023. Here's an unseen glimpse from the wedding:\n\nKiara Advani spoke about working with Shahid Kapoor during 'Kabir Singh'. The actor once told Mumbai Mirror, \"I can't say I've grown up watching Shahid because he's not so old. But after completing an entire schedule with him, I can definitely I can definitely say that I can't see anyone but him in the the titular role. It's a pleasure to work who brings so much to a scene.\"\n\n'Kabir Singh', featuring Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani, was one of the highest grossers of 2019. The film earned a lifetime collection of Rs 278.24 crore (net)."
