        "text": "Over the years, Shahid Kapoor, the talented actor, has transformed his image from a sweet boy-next-door to a muscular and intense character on-screen. His performances in movies like Kabir Singh, Udta Punjab, and Padmavat have won him critical acclaim and a huge fan following.\n\nIn 2018, his career skyrocketed with the success of Padmavat and grew more with the release of Kabir Singh in 2019. Today, Shahid Kapoor is counted among the highest-paid actors in the industry, with a net worth estimated to be Rs. 235 Crore in 2023.\n\nShahid previously lived in Praneta Apartment, located in Juhu. However, in 2022, he moved to a luxurious new apartment, Three Sixty West in Worli, along with his family. This sea-facing residence is a sight to behold, and Shahid often shares glimpses of the stunning residence on his social media with his wife, Mira Rajput.\n\nAddress and Price\n\nShahid Kapoor’s house address is – Three Sixty West Apartment, Birla Aurora, adjacent to the Old Passport Office, in the Hanuman Nagar area of Worli, Mumbai.\n\nThe actor’s abode spans across the 42nd and 43rd floors of the luxurious apartment, which is estimated to be worth around Rs. 58 Crore. Additionally, the actor had to pay a significant stamp duty of Rs. 2.91 Crore for the property.\n\nBuilders and Spaces\n\nThe impressive skyscraper, constructed in a space of 8,625 sq. ft., features six parking spots and a large balcony area of 500 sq. ft. The balcony is designed with a wooden patio that offers a breathtaking view of the renowned Bandra-Worli Sea Link.\n\nThis architectural masterpiece was brought to life by Oasis Realty, working in collaboration with Oberoi Realty and Sahana Development Corporation. The interior spaces were designed by Gauri Khan Designs, adding to the building’s overall appeal and aesthetic charm.\n\nInside Glimpse of Shahid Kapoor’s House\n\nThe Sea-Facing Wooden Patio\n\nThe wooden patio built in a Verandah, is the key attraction here and most probably the favourite area in Shahid Kapoor’s house.\n\nThe patio gets a wooden finish with minimalist furniture like wooden stools and a side table. Alongside this, a giant foot installation enhances the aesthetic appeal of the place, whereas, the glass panels contribute to an aristocratic output and give an uninterrupted sunset view.\n\nThe Royal Living Room\n\nThe living room in Shahid Kapoor’s house showcases royalty through the amazing shades and other interiors like a giant door-style frame and a large sofa. The living room gets a perfect blend of dark and white shades in its walls and furniture.\n\nTwo small brown sofas, a large white sofa, and a marbled table are the key ingredients of this living room, while the white wall and abstract painting frames contribute to contrasting the beauty.\n\nThe Bright Dining Room\n\nThe dining area, situated in the white section of the house, boasts a bright and welcoming atmosphere. It features a chic 6-seater white dining table, adorned with subtle pastel shades, that exude elegance.\n\nThe decorations in the area are minimal, with a side table that has a lamp and a painting frame. The dining area offers an enchanting view of the sea from the open balcony, further enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe Cosier Bedroom\n\nThe bedroom in Shahid Kapoor’s house exudes elegance and simplicity, with its dark coat and minimal decor. The room is adorned with unique touches such as bicycle bookends, candles, and an hourglass that adds to its charm.\n\nThe walls are gracefully adorned with polaroids of the couple’s most cherished memories, adding a personal touch to the space.\n\nThe Fancy Kitchen\n\nMira recently provided a glimpse of her kitchen, which boasts a pristine white colour theme, accentuated by a sleek black oven.\n\nIn addition, she shared a picture of an impeccably arranged spice box, which showcased her passion for cooking and love for the cooking space.\n\nThe Piano Corner\n\nShahid Kapoor’s wife, Mira, loves spending time in the piano corner, where she enjoys playing her favourite musical instrument. The piano corner is adorned with a beautiful light shade that creates a stunning contrast with the black piano bench and the piano itself.\n\nThe corner exudes a warm and inviting ambience, thanks to the fancy bulbs and an abstract painting frame that adds to its charm.\n\nFloors and Staircase\n\nThe majority of the apartment’s interior features light shades and white walls, complemented by floors finished with a beautiful marble texture.\n\nHowever, to create a striking contrast, the designers have incorporated sleek black staircases that add a touch of sophistication to the overall aesthetic."
