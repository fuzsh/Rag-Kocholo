California MPS House at 1487 Loma Vista Street - National Register of Historic Places

Statement of Significance: Built in 1913 in the Pasadena Heights Tract, the architect and builder of the house at 1487 Loma Vista Street are unknown. Early owners are listed in the 1919-20 city directory as Reginald A. and Maude Black. The dwelling represents the property type “Arts and Crafts Single-Family Residences in Pasadena” and is an excellent example of the Craftsman style with Oriental influence within the subtype “two-story Arts and Crafts period house.” It meets the registration requirements under Criterion C, as it exemplifies the values of design, craftsmanship and materials, which embody the philosophy and practice of Arts and Crafts period residential architecture in Pasadena, and the property retains integrity. A dramatic combination of Craftsman design and heavy Oriental detailing, this residence stands out in Pasadena among other, more temperate examples of this combination. Distinguishing features associated with the Craftsman style include the low-pitched horizontal massing, wide eaves, and the use of exposed rafters and natural materials. Distinguishing, Oriental-influenced details include the upturned apexes of the gables, the elaborate brackets around the porch columns, the cloud lift design of the porch balustrade, and the use of curved ends for eave brackets, vergeboards, and porch supports.
