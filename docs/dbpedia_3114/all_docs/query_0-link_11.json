Each candidate must be at least 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, and a registered voter residing within the Beverly Hills City limits at the time nomination papers are issued.\n\nThe sales tax in Beverly Hills is currently 9.5%. State law caps local sales tax at 10.25%. Under existing law, the County of Los Angeles or another regional entity could raise the Beverly Hills sales tax rate from 9.5% to 10.25% and collect that incremental revenue for regional purposes without allocating that additional sales tax revenue to Beverly Hills. Measure RP reserves that the remaining 0.75% sales tax increment is for local use only and would only take effect if the County or another regional entity successfully imposes a sales tax in Beverly Hills.\n\nCalifornia's Public Records Act (\"PRA\") is a California statute that affords the public the right to inspect, and be provided a copy of, most of the written information retained by State and local agencies in the course of business. The PRA regulates the public's access to records and sets out the specific statutory circumstances under which particular records need not be disclosed. The PRA states that public records are open to inspection at all times during the office hours of a local agency.\n\nClick on the following links to request or receive access to information for:\n\nEngineering Records\n\nCommunity Development Records\n\nPolice Department Report Copies and BHPD PRA Forms\n\nFire Department Ambulance Patient Records Request Form (PDF)\n\nBeverly Hills Property Information (property and land records)\n\nSearch City Records (Agreements, Ordinances, Resolutions)\n\nFor Marriage, Birth, and Death Certificates, go to the LA County Registrar/Recorders Office\n\nRequests for easily identifiable public documents may be made in person in the City Clerk's Office and copies are made available at that time for a fee.

This notification should be in writing.\n\nNo. Marijuana is still considered an illegal drug by the federal government. Based on Attorney General Jeff Sessions memo released in January 2018, the official Department of Justice guidance that was in place prior to this date has been rescinded. The previous guidance (based on the Cole Memo) was not to interfere with marijuana cultivation/distribution/use in states that have legalized marijuana, with the exception that the Department of Justice will prosecute the distribution of marijuana to minors and the distribution of marijuana by gangs and cartels. This policy is subject to change at any point.\n\nA person 21 years of age or older may possess, process, transport, purchase or give away to persons 21 years of age or older not more than 28.5 grams of marijuana in the non-concentrated form and not more than 8 grams of marijuana in a concentrated form including in marijuana products.

A mixed hotel/condominium project is comprised of both a hotel and common interest development (condominium). The smoking laws apply to the residential portions of these developments. The smoking laws do not apply to the buildings, portions of the buildings, or any other areas that are designated as part of the hotel including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, and common areas that are used by hotel patrons and guests.\n\nAs long as a landlord or homeowners association complies with the code requirements as set forth in Beverly Hills Municipal Code sections 5-4-18 and 5-4-19, they shall not be criminally or civilly liable to any person as a result of an owner or any other person violating the smoking regulations while on the property. The requirements for these two Code sections are outlined in the previous question.\n\nOverdue fines make up less than one % (1%) of the library's operating budget and in fact cost more in staff time to collect than what is received. It costs nearly $3 to collect $0.15 fine, for example. The amount we receive in overdue fines continues to decrease every year. We want all our materials to be returned on time, but understand that patrons are not always able to come to the library. Our goal is to provide equal access to library's resources for all our patrons.\n\nOverdue fines will not be reflected on the patron's account for late items.\n\nWe will send notices to patrons regarding overdue materials. After 30 days overdue, the item is considered lost and the patron will be billed the replacement cost and processing fee; if the item is returned undamaged, all related fees shall be removed from the account and borrowing privileges will be reinstated.\n\nGreystone does not have an exclusive caterer list. Our Frequent Caterers (PDF) have worked at the property multiple times and no fee is charged. Approved Caterers have worked here at least once but not as often as the Frequent Caterers. You (the client) are charged a $1000 refundable deposit to use an Approved Caterer. We also have an approval process if you would like to use another licensed caterer, please contact the Greystone Venue Coordinator for more details.\n\nGreystone is the location for your event.

Here is a link to the CSLB Licensing Classifications. Please be prepared to submit an agent authorization letter (signed by the license owner) if you are not the license holder. If the work takes place in a single family residence, and the owner occupies that residence, the owner can act as their own general contractor on the job (Owner Builder), and either does the work themselves or has employees (or subcontractors) working on the project. The homeowner cannot construct and then sell more than two structures during any three-year period. Commercial and Multi-family properties do not qualify for \"Owner Builder\".\n\nFirst, contact your plan review team to determine if the work is eligible for a revision.

That includes Two Rodeo, the private property with the cobblestone, sloping Via and Spanish Steps. Permission to film/photography at Two Rodeo must be granted by Two Rodeo Property Management.\n\nIt depends on the details of the film shoot and elements required. Some permits can be issued within 48 business hours while others may take much longer depending on the scope of the project. We recommend submitting an application at least 7 business days in advance. The nonrefundable Application Processing Fee is determined by the timing of each application submission. Any application for filming or photography that requires Beverly Hills Police Department support must be received at least 7 business days in advance.\n\nUpon review of the application, a police officer and/or traffic control officers may be required. Situations that typically trigger the need for an officer are large-scale filming (15+ cast/crew), large-scale still photography (20+ cast/crew), filming/photography with a drone, brandishing weapons, gunfire, stunts, intermittent traffic control, car-to-car driving shots driving shots with a process trailer, street/curb lane activity, and parking equipment vehicles on streets that may pose potential traffic hazards. Additional needs may also trigger the support of the Beverly Hills Police Department and each situation will be reviewed.\n\nLarge events (includes street closures or major City impacts) may require City Council review and approval. The recommended timeframe to complete the application steps is minimum six months since street closures or events with major City impacts will require City Council approval and interdepartmental coordination. A special event application will need to be filed, and all permit processes completed and paid prior to holding an event. Information we need from applicants depends on the event, however, the following are some of the requirements:\n\nWritten Proposal Submitted\n\nStaff Review - Review proposal, and will look out for red flags, or will request additional information as needed - then we will finalize the proposal with a staff report to present to Council.\n\nLogistics/ Permits:\n\nSpecial Event Application, Traffic Plan, Site/Structural Plans stamped by an engineer, Certificate of Insurance, Fire Code Applications and Public Assembly Applications will need to all be submitted by the applicant.\n\nStaff will work with you to review the run of show, route, structural, and traffic control plans.\n\nPayment of fees/permit issuance:\n\nFee Schedule: Fee Schedule\n\nStreet closures carry their own set of permit fees, but it also takes personnel - PD officers, Traffic Control Officers, Fire safety officer, it can even take parking or public works staff, all at an hourly rate depending on the request.

There is a 7 to 10 business day turnaround for reports. Paramedic reports are medical records that can only be released to the patient with proper ID or to a representative of the patient with a signed release.\n\nIn order to be hired by the Beverly Hills Fire Department, you must first attend a fire academy which is typically 12 to 16 weeks, and be at least a high school graduate, however, a college degree is highly valuable. Next, you must obtain your Emergency Medical Technician certification to learn basic life-saving techniques. This takes a semester and is a requirement since every firefighter also works as an EMT. An option that many candidates choose to make themselves more valuable is to attend paramedic school.\n\nThe Fire Department can address the overhanging tree(s) only if it is dead or dry. If the tree is still green and lush, it becomes a civil matter. The Fire Department are not arborists and may recommend that you hire one to confirm the viability and stability of the tree. The City does not get involved in neighbor disputes or civil matters such as tree obstructions from view, tree nuisance, etc. The Fire Department only responds/investigates fire hazards.\n\n\"Fire hazards\" are determined by fire department personnel based on the Fire Code, not the public. Trash could be a health or nuisance issue. Provide as much detailed information about your concern and a fire department representative will investigate and determine whether or not it's a fire hazard. If trimmings are found piled up, please provide a week to have a waste company pick up per their schedule.\n\nElevators that are not current on state certification or complaints on non-operability should be reported to the Department of Industrial Relations Division of Occupational Safety and Health 626-471-6911. Elevators are not a method of exiting when there is an emergency. If you are ever stuck in an elevator, please dial 911 for assistance. Additionally, please familiarize yourself with all your exit stairwells and exits that lead to the public way. All exits shall be clear from obstructions, clearly marked, and accessible at all times.\n\nFire inspections are conducted to identify and correct any potential fire and life safety violations. In doing so, the Fire Department plays a vital role in educating businesses and residents in proper fire prevention practices. This only adds to an excellent quality of life for all who visit and live in Beverly Hills. Additionally, Beverly Hills is one of only sixty cities in the country that enjoys a Class One rating from the Insurance Services Office, which helps to establish lower property insurance costs for the residents of Beverly Hills.\n\nThe Fire Code is a model code adopted by the state or local jurisdiction and enforced by fire prevention officers within municipal fire departments. It is a set of rules prescribing minimum requirements to prevent fire and explosion hazards arising from storage, handling, or use of dangerous materials, or from other specific hazardous conditions. It complements the building code. The fire code is aimed primarily at preventing fires, ensuring that necessary training and equipment will be on hand and that the original design basis of the building, including the basic plan set out by the architect, is not compromised. The fire code also addresses inspection and maintenance requirements of various fire protection equipment in order to maintain optimal active fire protection and passive fire protection measures.\n\nAll businesses (retail and office), multi-family residences, and other occupancies as determined by the Fire Code Official, shall be inspected at least once in a two-year period, but not more than once a year for state and local fire, life, and safety requirements by the Fire Code Official. Brush inspections in areas of the city located in very high fire hazard severity zones (generally, all areas north of Sunset Boulevard) are inspected annually. For Retail, Office, and Multi-family inspections an annual fee is assessed. For brush inspections, there is no fee unless a violation is noted.\n\nIf a violation is found during an inspection an Inspection Notice will be issued to record the type and location of the violation - there is not a responsible party on site to receive the notice, it will be mailed to the property contact. Unless the violation poses an immediate fire, life, or safety violation, a reasonable time will be granted to make the corrections-generally, fifteen (15) business days. If more time is needed, please contact the inspector.\n\nIf compliance has not been met after the period allotted in the Fire Department's First Notice, a Second Notice will be issued. Concurrently a penalty fee will be assessed to you. A subsequent recheck will be made, and if the conditions in violation are still found, a Final Notice and Order will be issued and a penalty fee assessed to you. A subsequent recheck will be made, and if the conditions are still found, the matter will be turned over the City Attorney and an additional penalty fee will be assessed to you. Each additional recheck for compliance will bring a penalty fee. These rechecks may be made at five day intervals. If you have been assessed a penalty fee for noncompliance, you will not have your violation notice signed off as corrected until proof of payment is made.\n\nNo. Fire extinguisher service shall only be performed by contractors licensed by the California State Fire Marshal. You may search online for \"fire extinguisher servicing\", or look in the yellow pages. We do not endorse or recommend fire extinguisher servicing companies. Please be aware of fraudulent fire extinguisher servicing companies saying they were \"sent by the Fire Department\" to service the extinguishers. We would never send a company to service your fire extinguishers. A fire extinguisher company or a fire service company of any kind does not have enforcement powers nor the authority to demand work to be performed. If at any time you feel uncomfortable or threatened, call the Beverly Hills Police Department or 911. If you have further questions regarding fraudulent fire extinguishers or fire service companies, email askBH or call 310-285-1000.\n\nModeling has improved significantly since the last study was conducted in 2018, and we are now able to use new technology and focus on evacuation routes to get residents out and firefighters into locations quickly. This updated modeling and technology allows the City to be very surgical about which vegetation, including trees, should be removed to provide the highest level of safety and efficient evacuations, thus the greatly reduced number. Over the next few decades, however, more trees will reach the end of their lifespan and the City has developed a long-term replacement plan.\n\nThe most significant finding in this wildfire assessment for many Beverly Hills residents is the dramatically reduced number of trees that must be removed to increase wildfire safety. This report uses the latest research and technology to identify safety challenges and includes a fire modeling component that allows the Fire Department to focus on where initial efforts should be made to protect lives. The report also takes what we learned in our previous wildfire assessment and public tree studies and uses that and newly-sourced information to \"connect the dots\" to improve community safety.\n\nWe have taken information from this report and from other resources and are focusing our resources in specific locations to reduce risk, given our high vulnerability. Our inspectors are building relationships with residents in those areas by providing home hardening consultations, allowing for pre-landscape inspection walk-throughs, educating residents on defensible space, and performing landscape inspections. We are also looking at the highest hazard areas and expanding our Red Flag No Parking Program to facilitate evacuations in the event of a wildfire. The Department has an extensive landscape inspection program that is staffed with a dedicated Fire Inspector who is supplemented with suppression staff to ensure that we reduce local fire fuel loads. We also do extensive outreach and community education, including Ready Set Go and home hardening consultations. We have an aggressive fuel modification ordinance that sets standards for new and remodeled landscape projects. We are recognized as a Fire Wise community, which allows us to work with organizations and agencies around the world that empower residents with the knowledge and information needed to reduce wildfire loss. We also partner with other agencies such as the Los Angeles County Fire Department, the Los Angeles City Fire Department, the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, Edison, and the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to reduce wildfire hazards.\n\nWhile the City is doing everything possible to increase wildfire safety, residents have a significant responsibility and must be actively engaged as a partner. This is not solely a problem for the Fire Department, nor the City itself. It is everyone's challenge, and it cannot be solved without residents, business operators, and the City joining forces to develop solutions together.\n\nWe will continue to work with private agencies to evaluate the most vulnerable locations using advanced fire modeling to identify areas where we can improve fire safety. We will make recommendations and take action to make incremental improvements and identify emerging trends as the vegetation landscape continues to change. Residents are encouraged to attend the informational meetings scheduled on July 13 and 14, visit the City's website for updates, and contact the Fire or Public Works departments with comments, questions, and concerns.\n\nUnder California law, the Director of Forestry and Fire Protection was directed to evaluate all properties within the State and identify areas at greater risk for life, loss, and destruction of property due to fire. Statewide survey criterion was used to determine areas classified as a \"Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.\" Fuel, slope, weather, amount of vegetation, density of homes, roofing materials, and other fire-related factors were considered. As a result of this evaluation, the area north of Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills is designated as a \"Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.\"\n\nPlease view our Wild Fire Hazard Area and Evacuation Routes Interactive Map to learn more.\n\nTo promote community awareness and participation in the Brush Clearance Program, the initial inspection fee will be waived if your property is found to be in compliance when the Fire Department conducts its initial brush inspection. However, if your property is found noncompliant, you will be assessed the initial inspection fee plus a noncompliance fine and a reinspection fee as identified on page 3 of the Brush Clearance Brochure (PDF) that was mailed to your home.\n\nDuring \"Extreme Fire Weather Conditions,\" the City of Beverly Hills will restrict parking on certain streets north of Sunset. These parking restrictions are required to ensure residents can evacuate and that firefighting equipment can get into the area. When the parking restrictions are in place there will be signs posted at the entrance to these particular streets.\n\nTo learn more about vegetation management and what you can do to prepare for a wildland fire, please read the brochures.\n\nThe following pictures are examples of brush violations.\n\nAssessments can be performed by the Beverly Hills Fire Department or oneself with a Self-Assessment Form (PDF). If the assessment is conducted by the fire department, a copy of the form and summary of recommendations will be provided at the end of the assessment. The homeowner is not obligated to complete the recommendations and can ask for alternative solutions to any items identified during the assessment.\n\nThe City of Beverly Hills is made up of dedicated individuals, residents, businesses and organizations that serve the City of Beverly Hills Community and contribute to the wellbeing of the City. To recognize individuals, residents, businesses or organizations that have made significant efforts towards fulfilling the mission of the Health and Safety Commission in Beverly Hills, the Commission has created the Beverly Hills Community Health and Safety Recognition Program. The Commission will recognize those who have gone above and beyond in their dedication and service to health, safety and disaster preparedness. The mission of the Health and Safety Commission is to strive to maintain and improve the overall health and safety of the community.\n\nBenefit information specific to a position can be obtained by clicking on the benefits tab on the job bulletin. These benefits are established per bargaining group and are periodically revised. Full-time employees are entitled to a generous benefit package which may include but is not limited to:\n\nGeneral membership in the Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) with a 2.5% at 55 formula (8% employee contribution paid by the City). Safety 3%@50 formula, (9% safety employee contribution paid by the City).\n\n457 and 401(k) Deferred Compensation Plans\n\nLife Insurance program and Long Term Disability Insurance\n\nMedical Insurance, Dental Insurance, and Vision Insurance\n\nTwelve paid holidays annually (including two personal holidays)\n\nPaid vacation\n\nSick Leave\n\nFor more information, please review the applicable labor MOU or Compensation Plan.\n\nFirst you need to determine the zoning of the property in question. Please refer to the zoning information at Maps and GIS .\n\nOnce you have determined the zone, you can see what is allowed in the zone by looking at the zoning code at Chapter 3 Zoning. The zoning code outlines uses and other regulations for each zone in the City.\n\nTrees on Multi-family properties are not protected, meaning they can be removed without planning review.\n\nTrees on Single-family properties may be protected if they are between the street and the house on the property. More information can be found on the Private Property Tree Removal page. Please contact a planner if you have questions.\n\nPlease note: You may need a public right-of-way use permit if the public right-of-way will be used in the process of removing a tree.\n\nResidential Developments containing Affordable Units are produced as a result of the state or local legislation (including, but not limited to, Senate Bill No. 330., Senate Bill No. 8, the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, and state Density Bonus Law), or as a result of other agreements to provide Affordable Units as part of a development project in the City, shall comply with these Guidelines. Therefore, Affordable Units are priced reasonably for households that are at or below certain designated income levels. Pursuant to Government Code Section 66300 et seq., and State Density Bonus Law, replacement affordable units in a new housing development reserved for lower-income households (very low and low income) must be offered to tenants from the previously existing multi-family residential development. If an affordable unit is being filled by a previous tenant of the previously existing multi-family development, then the Occupancy Priority list outlined in the municipal code is overridden per state law requirements. If a previous tenant does not wish to exercise their first right of refusal for an affordable unit, then the Occupancy Priority list shall apply.\n\nThe income levels are determined using the Area Median Income (AMI) at the county-level, which are based on household size, and are set by the state Department of Housing and Community (HCD) each year. The current AMI for Los Angeles County is $98,200, which is then used to set the limit for income levels for various household sizes and is detailed in the table below. The income levels are generally calculated as follows:\n\nAcutely low income: 0 to 15% of AMI\n\nExtremely low income: 15 to 30% of AMI\n\nVery low income: 30% to 50% of AMI\n\nLow income: 50% to 80% of AMI\n\nModerate income: 80% to 120% of AMI\n\nNumber of Persons in Household:\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nLos Angeles County Area Median Income:\n\n$98,200\n\nAcutely Low\n\n$10,350\n\n$11,800\n\n$13,300\n\n$14,750\n\n$15,950\n\n$17,100\n\n$18,300\n\n$19,450\n\nExtremely Low\n\n$29,150\n\n$33,300\n\n$37,450\n\n$41,600\n\n$44,950\n\n$48,300\n\n$51,600\n\n$54,950\n\nVery Low Income\n\n$48,550\n\n$55,450\n\n$62,400\n\n$69,350\n\n$74,900\n\n$80,450\n\n$86,000\n\n$91,550\n\nLow Income\n\n$77,700\n\n$88,800\n\n$99,900\n\n$110,950\n\n$119,850\n\n$128,750\n\n$137,600\n\n$146,500\n\nMedian Income\n\n$68,750\n\n$78,550\n\n$88,400\n\n$98,200\n\n$106,050\n\n$113,900\n\n$121,750\n\n$129,600\n\nModerate Income\n\n$82,500\n\n$94,300\n\n$106,050\n\n$117,850\n\n$127,300\n\n$136,700\n\n$146,150\n\n$155,550\n\nThe affordable housing monthly rental prices listed in Table II are gross amounts before any deductions for utility allowances. If the tenant is required to pay for utilities, the maximum rent must be reduced to account for the cost of those utilities (the Utility Allowance as determined by the City of Beverly Hills and as updated from time to time) not including the cost of telephone, cable TV, or internet service.\n\nAffordable Unit Rental RatesNo. of Bedrooms\n\nExtremely Low (30%)\n\nVery Low (50%)\n\nLower (60%)\n\nModerate (110%)\n\n0 Bedroom (Efficiency)$515$859$1,031$1,8911 Bedroom$589$981$1,178$2,1602 Bedrooms$663$1,105$1,326$2,4313 Bedrooms$736$1,227$1,472$2,7004 Bedrooms$795$1,325$1,591$2,916\n\nThe rent for each income level has been adjusted for assumed household size based on presumed occupancy levels of one person in a studio apartment, two persons in a one-bedroom unit, three persons in a two-bedroom unit, and one additional person for each additional bedroom thereafter.\n\nAllowable Family Size\n\n0 Bedroom\n\n1 Bedroom\n\n2 Bedroom\n\n3 Bedroom\n\n4 Bedroom\n\n1-2 Persons\n\n1 - 3 Persons\n\n2 - 5 Persons\n\n3 – 7 persons\n\n4 – 9 persons\n\nThe City recently enacted an inclusionary housing ordinance, which requires a certain number of affordable housing units to be provided in new multi-family residential developments (apartments or condominiums) that are built in the City and contain a certain number of units. For projects with 5-9 units, one affordable unit is required (or a developer can pay a fee in lieu of physically providing the units that will be placed into the City's Affordable Housing Trust Fund). For projects with 10 units or more, 10% of the housing units are required to be affordable units.\n\nOnce affordable housing units become available (if existing units are vacated or if new units are constructed), the City will begin the application process with the developer. During this process, the developer will advertise the start date on which they will accept applications for the housing unit in advance, and the City will also notify the affordable housing notification list of this date. This will provide notice for any interested party to fill out the affordable housing application, and provide the required documentation. Once the developer and the City receives applications, they will process them to determine whether an application qualifies for the unit based on their income level.\n\nIf the household qualifies for the unit based on their income level, the City will then rank the applications based on the priority list for affordable housing placement. The Affordable Housing Occupancy Priority Ranking was determined by the City Council, and is summarized below. More information on the ranking categories can be found Occupancy Priority for Affordable Units in Beverly Hills (PDF). Additionally, the adopted City Ordinance can be found in the Ordinance Number 19-0-2791 (PDF).\n\nOnce the income-qualified applications are sorted per the above ranking categories, the units will be offered to qualified households in Tier 1 first, then Tier 2, and so on, until the units are occupied.\n\nIf you would like to receive email notifications when an application period for an affordable housing unit(s) begins, please email Affordable Housing and ask to be added to the notification list, or sign up through the form on this webpage. Once an application period for an affordable housing unit(s) is opened, an email notification will be sent to this list, as well as in advance of the start date for the application period.\n\nThe City has an inclusionary housing requirement that generally requires 10% of units in a project with more than four units to be affordable. In addition, there are State regulations, such as SB330 that require the replacement of certain units if they are being demolished as part of a project. This often results in a requirement to replace more than 10% of the units as affordable. Please work with a planner to better understand the situation for your property. It will be helpful if you know how many units exist on the site today and a have a general idea about what you would like to do on the site.\n\nFor more information, please call 310-285-1000 and ask to speak to a planner, or email Planning Division your questions.\n\nArchitectural review is required when a building, structure, sign, fence, wall, or landscape is constructed or changed in any zone other than single-family zones of the City. Note that architectural review is applicable to any portion of a building or property that is visible from a public right-of-way (e.g., a street or an alley). To verify the zoning of a property, please consult the City GIS.\n\nTo learn more or to begin the Architectural Review process, please email Christine Delostrinos or call 310-285-1174.\n\nA large portion of the architectural review completed by the City relates to business signage in commercial areas. Sign regulations are contained in the Beverly Hills Zoning Code.\n\nPlease consult the code if you would like to install or change a sign on any property in the City.\n\nSigns cannot be installed without receiving Architectural Review and building permits from the City. To begin this process, email Christine Delostrinos or call 310-285-1174.\n\nIf you received a notice about a proposed development project, please submit a comment to the email address of the planner on the notice, or give them a call. This contact info will be listed on the notice. If you have a question about a project but do not know who the assigned planner is, please email the Planning Division.\n\nAll properties in the Central Area of the City may be subject to design review depending on the scope and scale of the proposed project. Any project that involves work that is visible from the public street (e.g., new house, façade remodel, window replacement, painting, etc.) will require some level of design review.\n\nTo verify if your property is in the Central Area of the City, please review the Zoning Map (PDF). Please note that properties in the Trousdale Estates and the Hillside Area of the City are not subject to Design Review.\n\nDownload the Design Review Application (PDF)\n\nTo learn more or to begin the Design Review process, please email Jason Caraveo or call 310-285-1132.\n\nIn single-family residential areas, window replacements are subject to design review if the property is located in the Central Area of the City and the request involves an elevation that is visible from the public street (i.e., the front elevation or portions of the side elevations). For multi-family or commercial properties, window replacements are subject to Architectural Review if the request involves any elevation visible from a public right-of-way (e.g., a street or an alley). If you think you may need Architectural review, please email Deborah Hong or call 310-285-1174.\n\nPermits for a window replacement can typically be approved at the public counter if the request includes a like-for-like exchange of window material or, if not a like-for-like exchange, a high quality window material, such as fiberglass, aluminum clad, wood, steel, etc. Vinyl windows are not approved at the staff level (i.e., at the public counter).\n\nIf you think you need Design Review or have questions, please email Jason Caraveo or call 310-285-1132.\n\nThe Gale Yard is a vacant property owned by the City of Beverly Hills. It is currently being used as a staging yard by Metro for the construction of the Wilshire/La Cienega Purple Line Station, and the City will retain ownership once the subway construction is complete (after 2024). The City is seeking input from the community on options for developing the site with a long-term use, which will inform the process of seeking development proposals moving forward.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that a building or property could be considered \"historic.\" The City has a list of designated landmarks, which can be found here. In addition, a property could have been designed by a master architect. The list of master architects can be found here.\n\nIn order to determine if your property is an eligible historic resource or has historic significance, please email Aaron Savage.\n\nYes, if the proposed retail queueing meets the applicable standards, and the business is located within the Business Triangle area of the city (the area of the City of Beverly Hills bounded by the centerline of Wilshire Boulevard to the south, the centerline of Santa Monica Boulevard (south roadway) to the north and west, and the centerline of the alley between Cañon Drive and Crescent Drive to the east. Please see the submittal requirements on the website.\n\nThe retail queueing permit will be active for a 1-year period, except this will also be tied to the expiration date of the business’s insurance policy. If the insurance policy expires before the 1-year period is up, the business will need to make sure to bring an active insurance policy to cover the remainder of the 1-year period, or else the permit will be considered inactive. If the business provides an active insurance policy to cover the remainder of the 1-year period, there is no additional fee for the permit to be active for the remainder of that 1 year period.\n\nAny installation deemed to be in violation of these standards will be subject to code enforcement action and penalties. The City encourages businesses to utilize virtual queueing smartphone applications that will allow patrons to return to the store at a specified time if the retail queueing line has reached the maximum number of people allowed in the queueing area (queueing is only allowed along the storefront façade and may not encroach into a neighboring business’s façade).\n\nAn urban grove is a group of 50 or more trees, located anywhere on a property, where the ends of the branches of each tree are within 6' of the branches of one of the other trees in the grove. Removal of a tree within an urban grove requires a Tree Removal Permit issued by the Community Development Department, available Tree Removal Regulations (PDF)\n\nThe City has various enforcement remedies that may be relied upon in the case of an unpermitted tree removal. These remedies can include prosecution as a misdemeanor offense, a requirement to plant a healthy replacement tree of the same or similar species and size, and/or paying a monetary penalty to the City in an amount equal to the replacement value of the tree.\n\nStaff will make accommodations to allow you to participate in as many events as possible. However, there are some events (firearm training, ride-alongs, etc.) which may limit your ability to participate.\n\nIf you are not able to get in and out of a vehicle without assistance, you may be disqualified from the ride-along experience. Please let Staff know if you think a restriction may apply to you.\n\nThe California Vehicle Code (21225) allows cities to adopt local ordinances that regulate the parking and operation of motorized scooters on local streets, so long as they do not conflict with the Code.\n\nThe City is currently reviewing policies in neighboring jurisdictions and will bring the matter before the Beverly Hills City Council during a Study Session on July 24, 2018 at 2:30 pm. Ultimately, the City Council would review and approve any recommendations on restrictions and additional enforcement.\n\nProperty that is turned in as found (with the exception of firearms) may be claimed by appointment at the Beverly Hills Police Department. If the owner is unknown or has not claimed the property, the person who turned it in at the Beverly Hills Police Department may claim it in accordance to California law. Call 310-285-2151 for more information.\n\nThere may be minor traffic impacts when setting up the construction sites. Once set up, there will not be any major traffic impacts on either street. The contractor will maintain 2-way traffic and take out 8 to 10 metered parking spaces. The sidewalk will be closed on the east side of Le Doux Road and on the south side of Gregory Way.\n\nWhen construction is complete, the La Cienega Yard will become the station's entrance (see the artist's rendering at the top of this page). Future development above the station entrance is possible, but there are no current plans.\n\nThe City will retain ownership of the Gale Yard once construction is complete and is currently evaluating the development of a mobility hub at the site. This could include space for passenger and shuttle pick-up and drop-off, bike parking, plaza seating, security, food kiosks, wayfinding information, and public art. Development of the site could begin as early as 2024, when Metro vacates the site and the subway opens.\n\nFor more information on projects near the Wilshire/La Cienega Station, click on the Related Mobility Projects tab under Additional Information. Visit the Gale Yard page for more information.\n\nThe Reeves Yard will become the station entrance for the Wilshire/Rodeo Station (see artist's rendering at the top of this page). While future development above the entrance is possible, there are no current plans to do so.\n\nAlthough the Canon Yard was once considered a possible location for the station's North Portal, there are no current plans to develop the site.\n\nThe future subway will operate mostly under Wilshire Boulevard; however, there are segments where the tunnel passes below homes and businesses in the southwest neighborhood of the City and Beverly Hills High School, as well as between Century City and Westwood.\n\nThe subway tunnels are generally 50 to 70 feet below the surface, reaching depths greater than 100 feet in some areas. Few, if any, impacts are expected at the surface from tunnel construction. The tunnels are dug completely underground using the latest tunneling technology. All tunnels are engineered to withstand the weight of soil and structures, as well as potential seismic activity.\n\nTunneling from Century City to the Wilshire/Rodeo Station was completed in January 2022. On February 1, 2023, tunneling along Wilshire Boulevard to the Wilshire/La Cienega Station was completed.\n\nIn September 2019, North Canon Drive was closed and the contractor began the installation of the 20-foot sound wall at Wilshire Boulevard. This was in response to community feedback and to help lessen the impacts of construction. At the May 21, 2024 City Council meeting, the City Council approved a six-month extension for the closure of North Canon Drive until the end of December 2024. Each future extension may be considered up to six months until September 2025 which is when the closure extension expires.\n\nThe future subway will operate mostly under Wilshire Boulevard There are segments, however, where the tunnel will pass below homes and businesses in the southwest neighborhood of the City and Beverly Hills High School. The tunnel will also travel beneath homes and businesses between Century City and Westwood.\n\nThe subway tunnels will generally be between 50 and 70 feet below the surface, reaching depths greater than 100 feet in some areas. Few, if any, impacts are expected at the surface from tunnel construction. Unlike the subway stations, which are excavated from the street surface, tunnels are dug completely below ground using the latest tunneling technology. All tunnels are engineered to withstand the weight of soil and structures, as well as potential seismic events.\n\nYes, Wilshire Boulevard will remain open to vehicles during the construction of the two subway stations in Beverly Hills. However, while most construction activities occur inside the staging yards, behind construction barriers, and below the street surfaces, there will be times when traffic lanes or streets will be closed.\n\nAll traffic control must be reviewed and approved by the City of Beverly Hills. Notifications will be electronically and hand-delivered to residents and businesses with details of any proposed closures and impacts. Residents can also stay informed through the project's social media channels, electronic construction notices, and updates posted weekly to the City's project website.\n\nThe City project team and Metro also closely coordinate with GPS applications (Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Waze) to ensure they reflect turn restrictions and street closures.\n\nDuring construction, the project team will adjust traffic signals or restrict turns based on traffic volumes and construction, which will optimize traffic flow as much as possible and maintain a safe environment for motorists, pedestrians, and construction workers.\n\nThe project also conducted a comprehensive traffic study to understand the magnitude of traffic impacts during construction. As a result of that study, construction activities and work hours are planned to minimize impacts during peak traffic hours. These traffic control plans are developed using strategies like those used in the recent Freeway 405 improvements.\n\nThe project team is committed to keeping the community informed of the work progress. Drivers will be advised in advance of traffic impacts due to construction via media announcements (local newspaper ads, social media posts, project website updates, and emails), electronic message boards on the roadway, and advanced traffic control measures like detours.\n\nMetro coordinates with Los Angeles and Beverly Hills when developing traffic control plans. Each plan must be reviewed and approved before the contractor can begin any related work.\n\nThe plans submitted by Metro must identify modifications for major intersections that would keep traffic moving around neighborhoods, including turn restrictions to reduce opportunities for cut-through traffic. Other strategies include electronic message boards to inform drivers of alternate routes and the deployment of traffic control officers at identified locations.\n\nCertain construction activities will impact traffic lanes, turns, crosswalks, sidewalks, parking, and some streets. Outreach will be performed well in advance on any street closures. As part of the outreach, Metro will identify and provide alternate routes.\n\nMost businesses within the construction areas have parking areas accessible from side streets. However, for those businesses whose parking areas are only accessible from Wilshire Boulevard, Metro will continue to coordinate access during construction.\n\nAs part of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) negotiations, Metro and the City established pre-existing noise levels near the project work sites. The MOA places strict limits on allowable noise levels and identifies potential financial penalties for noise violations. The Independent Compliance Monitor (ICM) is responsible for measuring noise levels and enforcing limits during all construction activities. For more information on the allowable noise levels at the Wilshire/La Cienega Station, visit Article XIV of the Section 1 MOA (page 24). For information regarding allowable noise levels at the Wilshire/Rodeo Station, visit Article XIV of the Section 2 MOA (page 28).\n\nTo minimize noise impacts, the contractors have installed fencing and sound walls around all staging areas. Also, noise-monitoring equipment is used and maintained in areas where heavy equipment is in use.\n\nConnect Beverly Hills is a place-making and urban design project to develop a series of streetscape plans and design standards for commercial streets in Beverly Hills. The goal is to provide consistent, uniform, and attractive streets that are immediately recognizable as Beverly Hills because of their unique look and feel. Connect Beverly Hills implements the Complete Streets Plan, which was adopted in April 2021, and recommends developing streetscape plans and design standards for streets identified on the Pedestrian Enhanced Network map.\n\nFinal streetscape plans for commercial streets in the City will be implemented in phases. They will be incorporated into public and private projects that reconstruct the public right-of-way, such as Metro subway construction, the City's Capital Improvements Program, and private development projects.\n\nTo learn more about Connect Beverly Hills, visit the Connect Beverly Hills page.\n\nThe LA Metro project construction began in 2015 east of La Cienega Boulevard and in 2018 east of Beverly Drive. Metro plans to open the stations for public use in three sections. Section 1, which includes the Wilshire/La Cienega Station, is expected to open in 2025. Section 2, including the Wilshire/Rodeo Station and Century City/Constellation Station, is anticipated to open in 2026. The full extension to Westwood is expected to be completed and ready for public use in 2027. Dates are subject to change based on Metro’s schedule.\n\nInitially, Metro developed geographically-based preliminary names for the stations: Wilshire/La Cienega and Wilshire/Rodeo Station. In November 2020, the Metro Board adopted the name \"Wilshire/La Cienega\" Station for Section 1, a decision unanimously consented to by the Beverly Hills City Council in July 2020. Official names for Section 2 Stations will be reviewed and adopted by the Metro Board in 2024 after soliciting input from the community.\n\nThe City’s Real Time Watch Center, an extensive network of cameras and the drone program, provide security coverage throughout the City, including the areas near the new Metro stations. In addition, security resources will exist both at and below street level. The City’s MOA with Metro dictates staffing requirements for law enforcement, security and other support services to ensure 24/7 security coverage.\n\nAlso, City plans to increase resources in preparation of the station openings and upcoming regional events, such as FIFA World Cup 2026 and LA Olympics 2028.\n\nRestrooms are available at nearby locations for Section 1 and 2. At Section 1, a public restroom is available at La Cienega Park south of the Wilshire/La Cienega Station. At Section 2, public restrooms at Beverly Canon Gardens on North Beverly Drive, Beverly Gardens Park on Santa Monica Boulevard, and the intersection of Civic Center Drive and 3rd Street. Additional restrooms may be provided by Metro in the future.\n\nMetro's First and Last Mile program improves walking and biking connections to the future stations, including bike lanes and bike parking, crosswalks, stop enhancements, streetscape amenities, and wayfinding signage. These recommendations are being coordinated with the City’s mobility projects.\n\nThe City’s Complete Streets Plan and Connect BH Plan will improve the right-of-way to embrace all modes of travel and reduces vehicle trips on our streets, encouraging walking, biking, and bus transit to access the stations. City and Metro will continue to offer seniors and disabled transportation services.\n\nPassenger loading zones near the station entrances are being explored.\n\nMost LA Metro lines operate from before 5am to after midnight. Trains run as often as every 10 minutes during peak times. The current D Line schedule can be found here. Regardless of how often the train runs, 24/7 security coverage at the stations is anticipated per the MOA between the City and Metro.\n\nBeverly Hills has been in Conservation Stage C since 2017. From 2017 to June 2022 customers could water 2 days per week from October to May and 3 days per week from June to September. Also, there was a 20% citywide water reduction target which the City achieved.\n\nAs of June 22, 2022, outdoor watering is only TWO days per week. And, there is now a 30% citywide water reduction target.\n\nHand watering is allowed for supplemental watering to trees and shrubs any day before 9 am or after 6 pm if the hose is equipped with a self-closing water shut-off device. There is no specific time limit for this type of watering. Still, customers are reminded that any water use resulting in excess or continuous water flow or runoff onto adjoining sidewalks, driveways, streets, and gutters is always prohibited.\n\nTo get the water deep into the soil on slopes, water in cycles (aka: Cycle and Soak). Deep watering less frequently encourages stronger, healthier plants with deeper roots. To avoid run-off, water in cycles (example: instead of watering for 10 minutes straight, water for 5 minutes, and an hour later water for another 5 minutes). Depending on the slope, you may need to split the time into three cycles.\n\nThe City of Beverly Hills Fire Department requirements for residents in high fire-risk areas is focused on brushfire clearance prevention related to removing dried brush. While vegetation needs to continue to be maintained in accordance with the brush clearance requirements, there are no brush clearance requirements related to irrigation.\n\nIn addition to watering with sprinklers two days a week, hand watering with a self-closing nozzle is allowed any day of the week under the ordinance, except during the hours of 9 am and 6 pm\n\nThe first notice will be a written warning. Failure to comply may lead to a citation under Municipal Code 1-3-101. A. 1st violation = $100 administrative fine; 2nd violation = $200 administrative fine; 3rd violation = $500 administrative fine for each additional violation of the same provision of this code within a twelve 12 period. For any violation of this code for which there is no specific administrative fine established, the fine imposed shall be that set forth in a resolution adopted by the city council. Under Stage C mandatory requirements, a fine may be up to $1,000 and/or 6 months in county jail.\n\nA single-use article is any disposable foodware item used to serve, consume, transport, or contain food and beverages. This term includes plates, bowls, clamshells, pizza boxes, cups, trays, egg cartons, and wrappers, among other items. It also includes single-use foodware accessories provided alongside ready-to-eat food, such as forks, knives, spoons, chopsticks, straws, stirrers, spill plugs, hot beverage sleeves, cup lids, napkins, and condiment containers.\n\nIn contrast, multiservice utensils are foodware items designed to be cleaned and reused and are only required for full-service restaurants.\n\nThe ordinance will only permit compostable and recyclable single-use articles, as accepted by the City's waste hauler, and prohibits the sale of all expanded polystyrene products.\n\nA Compostable item will promptly and safely break down into non-toxic organic matter (compost), and conforms to the following requirements:\n\nMust be free of all fluorinated chemicals, including per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAs)\n\nMust satisfy one or more of the following criteria:\n\nIs home compostable, meaning it will biodegrade at moderate temperatures in a composting bin designed for home use\n\nIs composed of 100% fiber-based material free of non-fiber coatings and additives\n\nIf home compostable or fiber-based items are not feasible, then it must be certified compostable by both the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) and the Compost Manufacturing Alliance (CMA)\n\nDoes not include bioplastic cups, containers, foodware accessories, coatings, or additives\n\nAlthough some bioplastic items are certified as industrially compostable, they are not considered compostable in Beverly Hills because the City's waste hauler cannot process these materials.\n\nRecyclable items can be diverted from landfills and then feasibly salvaged, processed, and returned to use by society, with the following criteria:\n\nPlastic and expanded polystyrene single-use articles are not considered recyclable.\n\nAluminum, unlined paper, glass, and beverage containers with a CRV value are recyclable.\n\nDownload and view our list of Compliant Single-use Articles (XLSX) to help transition your foodware. This list is only intended to provide initial guidance and is not representative of all compliant products. The Department of Public Works will continue to update the list. Prices and links are subject to change. See the last column for the date each product was updated.\n\nThe prohibition of non-compostable and non-recyclable single-use articles does not apply to single-use articles that are:\n\nIncluded with ready-to-eat food that is pre-packaged at a location outside of the premises of the food facility\n\nProvided in response to an emergency that is declared or ratified by the City, County, State, or federal government\n\nProvided by health facilities to patients with ready-to-eat food during the course of treatment\n\nProvided as reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities who request them\n\nThe ordinance also does not cover beverage containers subject to the California Redemption Value (CRV), expanded polystyrene-based products encased in a more durable material, or products pre-packaged outside the City using expanded polystyrene as part of the packaging material.\n\nAdditionally, full-service restaurants may provide single-use foil wrappers, napkins, straws, and placemats to dine-in customers so long as they are compostable or recyclable. To-go accommodations from full-service restaurants must also adhere to single-use article requirements.\n\nIf complying with the ordinance will constitute an undue hardship for your business, you may apply to the Director of Public Works to waive the requirements for up to one year while you work to achieve compliance. Instances of undue hardship include a lack of dishwashing capacity for dine-in reusables, extraordinary financial strain, purchases of non-compliant products before receiving notice of the ordinance, or specific food-service applications for which no compliant articles can be feasibly used.\n\nSingle-use plastic foodware and expanded polystyrene (e.g., Styrofoam) products comprise a significant proportion of the City's waste production, dominating our landfills. Such items also pollute our streets, critical waterways, and local ecosystems, breaking down into hazardous microplastics that accumulate in perpetuity. Additionally, producing conventional plastics and expanded polystyrene depends on extracting and processing fossil fuels, resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe proposed ordinance intends to curtail these environmental and human health impacts by reducing the distribution and disposal of single-use plastic and expanded polystyrene items.\n\nCity Council will review the ordinance on March 11, 2024.\n\nAccess the Public Works recording of the February 26 Workshop\n\nAccess the City's Draft Ordinance (PDF)\n\nView our Business Fact Sheet (PDF) for an ordinance overview\n\nFood Facility\n\nAny operation that provides food for human consumption at the retail level and operates within the City or a City facility\n\nCategory 1\n\n1 year to comply (est.

Implementing the statewide plan under SB 1383 will reduce short-lived, harmful, super pollutants with significant warming impacts, and is essential to achieving California's climate goals.\n\nOrganic waste in landfills emits 20% of the state's methane, a climate super pollutant 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Organic waste, such as food scraps, yard trimmings, paper, and cardboard, make up half of what Californians send to landfills.\n\nThe State has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve human health, and create clean jobs that support resilient local economies. Implementing the statewide plan under SB 1383 will reduce short-lived, harmful, super pollutants with significant warming impacts, and is essential to achieving California's climate goals.\n\nOrganic waste in landfills emits 20% of the state's methane, a climate super pollutant 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Organic waste, such as food scraps, yard trimmings, paper, and cardboard, make up half of what Californians send to landfills.\n\nIn addition to the Proposed Rate Adjustments, there are changes in services and new fees.\n\nView the changes in commercial services:\n\nSunday Service Surcharge: A Sunday service surcharge will be imposed for accounts serviced less than seven days a week with a pick-up day on Sunday. Businesses will have the option to switch their Sunday service to another day to avoid a Sunday service surcharge, provided there are no sanitary issues with the switch from a Sunday pick-up.\n\nSeparate 65-Gallon Organics Cart Service: The separate 65-gallon organics cart provides service to comply with the State Assembly Bill 1826. Every business that generates four cubic yards of solid waste a week and every multi-family property with five units or more must subscribe to an organic recycling service. The goal of the regulation is to reduce organic waste from the landfills.\n\nRecycling Bin Rate Fee: Beginning January 1, 2022, customers with a recycling bin will be charged a bin rate. The recycling bin rate will be 50% of the refuse rate for the same bin size and frequency of collection. Residents can dispose of recyclables and waste in the same container. The recyclables are then separated from waste at the processing facility. Some residents prefer to have a separate container for recyclables.\n\nSee the changes in residential services:\n\nCollection Day Curbside Roll-Out Service Discontinued: The City provided a curbside roll-out service to properties north of Santa Monica Boulevard that are serviced by curbside collection, this includes north of Sunset Boulevard and the Trousdale estate area. Due to COVID-19, the curbside roll-out service was discontinued to ensure the safety of City staff and residents. Prior to COVID-19, staff proposed to discontinue this service, due to non-compliance, lack of space for staging containers, and burden of resources to run the program. Customers paying for the collection day curbside roll-out fee will be removed from the bill.\n\nRates for solid waste services are proposed to increase to ensure adequate revenues are available to deliver high-quality services to the community. Many solid waste aspects are increasing in cost including: collection, recycling processing, disposal at landfills and other facilities, equipment, fuel charges, public outreach, and state-mandated solid waste diversion programs including organics recycling. In addition, sales of recyclable materials generate revenue to reduce rates and avoid cost and impacts of disposal at landfills. However, recent changes to international policies restricting imports of recyclable materials and declining global market value for recyclables have resulted in a significant decline in the sale value of recyclable materials.\n\nIn addition to the revenues received from ratepayers, the City is using money from its Solid Waste Reserve Fund to moderate the increase in the rates and cover the costs of operation. It is important to maintain a healthy balance in the Solid Waste Reserve Fund to address unforeseen emergencies. For example, in the event of a major earthquake, money from the Reserve Fund would be used to provide citywide debris removal, as well as to acquire a location to stage debris before its disposal. At its public hearing to adopt rates on October 27, 2020 the City Council may consider an option, that uses a greater amount of Reserve Funds, and result in rate increases, which would be $1 to $3 lower per billing period for single-family residential customers, than those indicated in this notice. Lower rate increases would also result for commercial customers.\n\nWater that meets federal and state standards is safe to drink. Not only does California have some of the strictest water quality standards in the nation, the criteria established for both federal and state standards are based on cutting-edge scientific work that also utilizes health-related data to protect public health. These standards are developed by several governmental agencies, which have experienced public health medical doctors, toxicologists, epidemiologists, exposure scientists, environmental scientists, mathematical scientists, computer scientists, and biostatisticians to name just a few.\n\nDelivering safe, high-quality water to our residents is our top priority. The City of Beverly Hills, in conjunction with the Metropolitan Water District, ensures the reliability and safety of our drinking water through innovative water treatment processes, investments in our infrastructure, and resource management. We employ highly trained and skilled staff and take extensive measures to constantly monitor and test our water throughout our service area to protect public safety. We also use only State certified laboratories to test for emerging contaminants.\n\nBottled water is not necessarily any safer to drink than your tap water. In fact, much of bottled water comes from municipal water systems. Bottled water is considered a packaged product that is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Even though the bottle water industries have to adhere to quality standards, the FDA's water quality testing requirements are far less stringent than the standards we meet. Monitoring is also less frequent than your tap water and the FDA does not require water-bottling companies to share their test results to consumers like the results we provide to our customers. Also, keep in mind bottled water creates a tremendous amount of plastic, which leaves a big environmental footprint. Then there is the consideration of cost. The price you pay for a gallon of water at your tap is considerably less than the price of a gallon of bottled water.\n\nThe novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, does not present a threat to the safety of Beverly Hills' treated water supplies. First of all, COVID-19 is transmitted person-to-person, not through water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Secondly, Metropolitan's advanced, multi-step treatment process includes filtration and disinfection using ozone and chlorine. This process removes and kills viruses, including coronaviruses, as well as bacteria and other pathogens."
