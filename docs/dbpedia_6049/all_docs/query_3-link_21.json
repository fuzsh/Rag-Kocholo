        "text": "The Craft ... has a legacy that outweighs both its limited success and few flaws.\n\nMay 21, 2021\n\nSet to a banging alt-rock soundtrack, it follows four teenage outcasts who begin dabbling in the dark art of witchcraft, and soon find themselves out of their depth.\n\nMay 10, 2021\n\nMasquerades as a female empowerment film despite prioritizing the toxicity that can be rampant in groups of friends (female or otherwise).\n\nDecember 30, 2020\n\nI really enjoy the characters. Every single one of them is very unique and the film does an excellent job at fleshing out each girl.\n\nOctober 23, 2020\n\nI've never subscribed to this genre of movie...I found a lot of this stuff to just not be palatable. But for its time, it's an okay movie.\n\nAugust 12, 2019\n\nThe effects are obviously a bit rough around the edges, and the acting is very mixed.\n\nAugust 12, 2019\n\nDespite the fact that none of the actresses were anywhere near teen age while making the film, they're all pretty convincing as tortured teens expressing their pubescent angst through magic.\n\nMarch 31, 2019\n\nI really like Fairuza Balk as an actress and I really enjoyed her here.\n\nMarch 31, 2019\n\nThe early going is interesting, amusing and even clever, but such cinematic niceties give way to a disappointing second hour.\n\nMarch 21, 2019\n\nWe watched Rochelle take her own power and take her own revenge. It is one of the many reasons why The Craft was ahead of its time.\n\nJanuary 30, 2019"
