Applicants without a video portfolio are asked to complete a photo essay. Please see our guidelines on how to make a visual essay.\n\nHow to submit your portfolio\n\nSubmit your portfolio/ photo essay by including a link to an external site of your choice in the application (e.g. in the personal statement).\n\nThe English language level for this programme is: Level 4\n\nUCL Pre-Master's and Pre-sessional English courses are for international students who are aiming to study for a postgraduate degree at UCL.

Where a specific overall percentage is required in the UK qualification, the international equivalency will be higher than that stated below. Please contact Graduate Admissions should you require further advice.\n\nSelect your country\n\nAbout this degree\n\nStudents learn to tell stories in various documentary film modes; master the technical ‘craft’ skills needed to produce different kinds of documentary films of different lengths for varied audiences; critically view and review film material; draw on anthropological and social science approaches to documentary; think critically about the relationship between form and content in documentary film practice.\n\nWho this course is for\n\nWe are looking for students who want to challenge the documentary form and find innovative ways to tell important stories that resonate with global audiences. This degree is well-suited to students who have little or no experience in making films but also provides the opportunity for those with experience to deepen, broaden and diversify the range of their work.\n\nWhat this course will give you\n\nThis MA will allow you to benefit from UCL's unique position in London, at the centre of the UK creative industries. The programme uses professional film-makers to teach within a truly pan-disciplinary university research environment.\n\nUCL houses London's global non-fiction film festival, Open City Documentary Festival. You will gain access to this festival, providing a unique opportunity to engage with the global creative non-fiction industry.\n\nStudents have access to UCL's camera and editing equipment. Each student has their own full camera kit which they keep throughout the year - avoiding the need to check equipment in and out as well as access to editing suites. Students also have access to the extensive film collections in UCL Libraries and the team of creative artists who work in and around the Centre for Public Anthropology.\n\nThis programme is based at our brand new UCL East campus in East London, forming part of the School for Creative and Cultural Industries. Students will benefit from cultural and educational connections with our East Bank partners such as the V&A and BBC, as well as state-of-the-art facilities including exhibition, performance and curating spaces, conservation studios and a 160-seater surround-sound cinema.\n\nThe foundation of your career\n\nGraduates of the Ethnographic and Documentary MA are likely to find work in a number of fields. Some work as independent film makers. Others find opportunities elsewhere - in organisations such as independent production companies, the BBC, the Ipsos Mori film unit, film units of NGOs. A number of graduates go on to specialise in editing, camerawork or producing. The increasing demand for trained moving image specialists in the years ahead will continue, if not accelerate.\n\nEmployability\n\nThe programme equips students for careers in:\n\nmass media including cinematic, broadcast and web-based moving image\n\nfilm and TV industry as camera operators, producers, directors, editors, researchers\n\nacademia – ethnographic research, visual media and culture\n\nmarketing and research\n\ncommunication and other media\n\narchives, as well as cultural heritage organisations\n\nNGOs\n\nNetworking\n\nThroughout the year there will be weekly masterclasses in which invited guests from the world of non-fiction film come in to discuss their work and meet students. A number of these events will be specifically careers orientated, culminating in a Careers Day in the 3rd Term. Students are also invited to participate in the annual Open City Documentary Film Festival (taking place at Easter), organised within the Anthropology department and taking place in venues across London. This is a chance to network with many people involved at the cutting edge of non-fiction filmmaking.\n\nTeaching and learning\n\nThe programme is delivered through a combination of seminars, practical exercises, tutorials and masterclasses.\n\nThe programme is assessed by practical film exercises and written work.\n\nIn the first term students have approximately 180 contact hours and in the second, 120. Over the summer they have up to 65 contact hours with mentors, editing tutors and in supervised (rough and fine cut) screenings and tutorials of work in their studios.\n\nModules\n\nAcross the first and second terms all students will undertake the Documentary and Ethnographic Film Practice compulsory module, during which you will make two examinable short films and write accompanying Critical Evaluations. The films will each be between 7-10 minutes in duration. You will also regularly complete short film exercises in preparation for these two films. You will also take two optional taught postgraduate modules, normally within the Anthropology department. From April, under the guidance of a mentor who will be an established industry professional, you will work on your Graduation Film which forms the centrepiece of the portfolio of films that you will make during the MA and will be between 18-30 minutes in length.\n\nAs a part-time student you will complete your degree after two years. In the first year, you undertake the compulsory practical filmmaking module with two examinable short films and accompanying Critical Evaluations. You have the freedom to decide when you take two optional modules, normally within the Anthropology department; you may, for instance, chose to take them both in the second year, or one in each year. From April of your second year, under the guidance of a mentor who will be an established industry professional, you will work on your graduation film – normally between 18-30 minutes in length.\n\nPlease note that the list of modules given here is indicative. This information is published a long time in advance of enrolment and module content and availability are subject to change.
