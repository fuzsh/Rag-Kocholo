        "text": "Starring: Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell, Rachel True, Skeet Ulrich, Helen Shaver\n\nIn the cult classic The Craft, a powerful coven is formed when a new girl in town befriends three other misfits with supernatural tendencies. But it becomes good witch v bad witch when some of those in the group start to use their powers for revenge and their own personal gain. Self-centered, vengeful, and vain, these teens with special powers are a heightened version of the typical high school girl flick. Only in this case there’s levitation, love spells, and Manon. Teenage witches in the 1990s, gotta love ’em."
