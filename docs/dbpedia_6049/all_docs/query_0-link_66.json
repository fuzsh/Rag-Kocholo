        "text": "The film's protagonist, new-in-town Sarah, is already a somewhat troubled girl when the film begins, making it all too easy for her to fall into the outstretched arms of her coven to-be. Little do they know that this wide-eyed girl will become the most powerful of them all, and be the only one who gets to keep her powers in the end.\n\nThis role was the first of many successes for actress Robin Tunney, and even earned her an MTV Movie Award for best fight - shared with Fairuza Balk, of course. From there, she starred alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1999 action film End of Days, guest starred in the pilot episode of House, and acted in the first season of Prison Break. These days, she is perhaps best known for her larger roles on shows like The Mentalist and, most recently, The Fix.\n\nBut what she does in her free time might be even more interesting than her acting career: She's actually a skilled poker player. She played for charity on Celebrity Poker Showdown in 2006 and participated in the World Series of Poker shortly after, making it to the final table. She even joked in one interview that \"gambling and getting wasted\" are \"requirements\" at her family's Christmas Eve gatherings.\n\nAs for family, she is married and became a proud mother of two with the birth of her second child in January 2020.\n\nPoor Bonnie just wanted to be free of the scars that covered her body and drew torment from her classmates. Sadly, using her witch powers to remove them only led her to become intoxicated with narcissism as much as power.\n\nAlthough Neve Campell's portrayal of Bonnie in The Craft was her first lead role in a feature film, just seven months later, she'd snag the role that would really make her famous: Sidney Prescott in Scream. Her part in the wildly popular franchise made her a fan-favorite scream queen, winning her multiple MTV Movie, Fangoria Chainsaw, and Saturn Awards for her efforts.\n\nOutside of horror, she had an indie phase from about 2000 to 2011, starring in films that were well-reviewed but never really reached a wide audience (among these, 2000's Panic, and 2002's award-winning Last Call with Sissy Spacek and Jeremy Irons). During this time, she also co-wrote and produced a couple of films (one centered around her love of ballet, being a former ballerina herself), and even took to the stage for her theater debut. She did eventually return to mainstream entertainment in 2012 with a more TV-based approach, appearing in everything from The Simpsons and Grey's Anatomy to Mad Men and House of Cards. And finally, she confirmed Sidney would return for Scream 5 in 2022.\n\nAs for her personal life, she happily revealed the adoption of her second son in 2018.\n\nRochelle's struggles in the film sadly came in the form of racist bullying from the school's requisite mean blonde girl, Laura Lizzie. But she gets her revenge soon enough when she casts a spell that causes Laura's supposedly \"superior\" hair to fall out in tufts. No more bigoted, hair-based comments from her.\n\nFollowing her work on The Craft, Rochelle's actress Rachel True did snag a lead in the Dave Chappelle stoner comedy Half Baked. But, for the most part, her work in film remained small (say hello to cameos in both Sharknado 2: The Second One AND Sharknado: Heart of Sharkness). TV seemed to be more her lane, as she had a recurring role on The Drew Carey Show and made appearances on Dawson's Creek, Being Mary Jane, and, most recently, Good Trouble.\n\nBut what's really interesting is she seems to have embraced her inner witch the most out of the cast, as she's been a professional tarot card reader operating in the Echo Park neighborhood of LA since 2017. She's even written a book on the practice, which she sells bundled with a deck of tarot cards she helped design. She has said that reading cards helps her stay grounded, something she finds especially difficult to do in a place like Hollywood.\n\nOh Nancy, did you really deserve to end up tied to the bed of a mental institution, forever dreaming you could fly out of that prison? Okay, to be fair, she did take out Sarah's boyfriend, then try to end her as well... but dang, she really looked like a goth fashion dream while doing it.\n\nIt's easier to ask what Fairuza Balk hasn't been up to since starring in The Craft. She apparently became disenchanted with Hollywood, criticizing the industry as having \"no morals... no integrity at all.\" It's no wonder that she turned toward other artistic pursuits. She released music under the artist name Armed Love Militia. She's exhibited her own original mixed-media art in New York and Los Angeles. She even sells her art and other merchandise on her own website.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean her acting career is totally over. She did appear in films like The Island of Dr. Moreau, American History X, Adam Sandler's The Waterboy, and as a more colorful character (breaking her dark, edgy typecasting) in Almost Famous. As for TV, she and her home were subjects of an episode of The Haunting Of, where a medium apparently described her as having a \"witchy\" aura, and she briefly had a recurring role on Ray Donovan.\n\nChris's scummy character arguably kicks the whole plot off when his horrid treatment of Sarah pushes her to seek comfort in the arms of her coven. But getting revenge proves difficult, as a love spell intended as a practical joke quickly turns into a dangerous obsession.\n\nLike Neve Campbell, 1996 was a big year for Skeet Ulrich. Back to back to back, he starred in Boys (with Winona Ryder), The Craft, and Scream (teaming up with Campbell yet again). From here, he gained more starring roles in films like As Good As It Gets (reuniting with Scream alum Jamie Kennedy) and Chill Factor. As for TV, he appeared in the multiple-Emmy-nominated miniseries Into the West, the TV film The Magic of Ordinary Days, as a recurring guest voice on Robot Chicken, and on procedural dramas CSI: NY, Law & Order: LA, and Law & Order: SVU. More recently, his biggest role was likely that of F.P. Jones, the father of Jughead Jones, on Riverdale - but he apparently left the show because he got bored.\n\nIn his personal life, he has said before that he's not exactly interested in fame, and hates having his picture taken. He's even self-conscious about his early films. “My god, most of my beginning films, like Boys, the first one, I was horrific,” he says. “And I thought I was really bad in The Craft. I was like, This is horrible.” Perhaps it was a good thing then that he went on something of a self-imposed break from his fame when his children (two twin boys) were born so he could be a present and active father (a break that ended with the aforementioned Riverdale casting).\n\nLastly, he apparently really enjoys woodworking, specifically making furniture.\n\nMitt was the second most vocal of Chris's little trio of terror friend group. It's a wonder he managed to escape the wrath of the coven completely unharmed considering just how much he mouths off at them.\n\nMitt, or rather, Breckin Meyer, is actually probably best known for a character he played before The Craft: Travis Birkenstock, the stoner high school student/skateboarder in the 1995 hit film Clueless. Regardless, just like Fairuza Balk, this boy has been busy. First, his stoner typecasting in Clueless, The Craft, and Escape from LA had to go, so he set himself to work playing characters that went against this image in films like Kate & Leopold, Blue State, and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. Now we're going to ignore his regrettable role as Jon in the live-action Garfield and move to TV, where he played a district attorney on the legal drama The Fix (which Robin Tunney, AKA Sarah, was also a part of), appeared as the president's brother on Designated Survivor, and provided voice work for King of the Hill, American Dad, and Robot Chicken.\n\nSpeaking of Robot Chicken, did we mention he's received multiple Emmy nominations for his writing on the show? Yup, he's more than an actor. In addition to writing, he created the TBS show Men at Work, co-founded a production company with his friends, and has played drums for several famous musicians, including Tom Morello.\n\nAnd as if all of this weren't enough to make him a Renaissance man, he's also a dad of two."
