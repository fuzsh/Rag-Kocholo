        "text": "Top 3 Tips for Craft Services\n\nLearning to create the best craft services table is essential when working on film sets. For example, you can make a craft services checklist or assemble a list of foods your cast and crew members can and can’t eat. Here are three more important tips for craft service in the film industry.\n\n1. Choose Flexible Catering Options\n\nThere are all kinds of caterers in the business, and you want to choose the best one to support your craft services needs. Depending on where and when you’re filming, you’ll likely want to work with a catering company that can be flexible enough to meet the demands of your production. For example, shooting outside might involve providing slightly different options than when shooting on an indoor set.\n\nTherefore, selecting a catering company that can provide both hot meals on set and lunch boxes for on-location shooting is a great way to ensure your cast and crew are well-fed and ready for shooting.\n\n2. Provide Healthy Options and Alternatives\n\nMany people who run film sets wonder what should be included in a craft services meal plan. It’s essential to have healthy options and alternatives for those on set with nutritional needs or allergy requests. Encourage the cast and crew to eat healthy foods, like fruits and veggies, to keep them energized throughout the day.\n\nSome healthy food and beverage options you can provide include:\n\nFruit and veggies: Offering fruits and veggies ensures cast and crew have healthy snacks to eat between takes.\n\nYogurt parfaits: Include various yogurt options that can be mixed with fruit, honey or granola.\n\nPackaged snacks: Offer bags of pretzels, popcorn or chips for something people can grab easily.\n\nGranola and protein bars: Put out different types of granola bars to provide a healthy snacking option. These bars can also be a quick and nutritious breakfast option.\n\nSandwiches: Select two or three kinds of sandwiches to give your cast and crew some options for a good lunch or dinner.\n\nTea and coffee: Keep your cast and crew hydrated and caffeinated with various tea and coffee options. Creating a tea and coffee station at your craft services table is a terrific way to ensure everyone can choose their favorite options.\n\nWater: Be sure to provide plenty of bottled water throughout the day. It may also be a good idea to offer a cooler for cast and crew members to refill their reusable water bottles.\n\n3. Keep the Craft Services Table Accessible\n\nMaking the craft services table accessible is important, especially when your cast and crew work long days without many breaks away from set. Keep the craft service table near the set at all times to make accessing food throughout the day easier. Save people time and energy by placing food nearby, so they can grab it and go as needed.\n\nConsider Apple Spice’s Box Lunches for Your Craft Services Needs\n\nApple Spice offers box lunches and catering services to fit your film set needs. We provide a variety of box lunches for film crews who want to enjoy a good meal in between takes. Choose between sandwiches, salads, soups and extras for your craft services needs.\n\nFeel free to schedule a delivery of your lunch boxes for a future date or request some boxes to be delivered in a few hours. Our company is flexible, providing meals whenever you need them on set.\n\nApple Spice prioritizes safety regarding our lunch boxes. We label all boxes to eliminate the guessing game and smooth over craft services operations. As a result, you can spend less time figuring out your craft services options and more time getting that perfect take."
