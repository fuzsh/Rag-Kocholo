The three girls dabble in occult practices, and when they notice that Sarah has the powers of a natural witch, they talk her into joining their coven. After Sarah agrees to accompany the girls in their group, they soon discover that with a fourth witch in the coven, they are able to cast spells more powerful than they could before, and begin to amend all the things wrong in their lives.
