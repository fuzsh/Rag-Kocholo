        "text": "People have strong feelings about The Craft, the beloved 1996 teen movie that stars Fairuza Balk, Rachel True, Neve Campbell, and Robin Tunney as a coven of high-school-aged witches. So when the first trailer for The Craft: Legacy dropped on September 29, die-hard fans were split. Some couldn’t believe anyone would dare reimagine such a classic; others were giddy at the thought of revisiting the weirdos of their youth. But maybe this movie wasn’t crafted with us Gen Xers in mind at all.\n\nThe original film, cowritten and directed by Andrew Fleming, introduced a generation to light as a feather, stiff as a board and a new era of goth-chic attire. Twenty-two years after its release—and shortly after Hollywood entered the Time’s Up era—Zoe Lister-Jones began writing an updated version of the film fit for an age that not only welcomed stories designed for the female gaze, but demanded them.\n\nLister-Jones wouldn’t specify whether The Craft: Legacy, which premieres on Amazon and VOD October 28, should be considered a sequel, remake, continuation, or reboot. She would, however, say that her version—starring Cailee Spaeny, Gideon Adlon, Lovie Simone, and Zoey Luna, and directed as well as written by Lister-Jones—stands on its own: “I get asked, ‘Who is playing Nancy? Who’s playing Sarah?’ These [characters] are not based on those characters,” she recently told Vanity Fair. “These are very much their own young women, living in their own fictional universe.… [My film] is about what it means to be an outsider and a young woman—and when I speak of young women, of course I am also speaking to young trans women—in today’s landscape.”\n\nThat landscape, she said, is one in which the leadership of the United States is brazenly and openly disrespectful to women, not to mention people of color, immigrants, and the LGBTQ community. Lister-Jones wanted her film to tell a story about women upholding each other, working in partnership to build supportive communities.\n\n“No shade to the original—and women are allowed to be villains—but ultimately it was about women whose power was too overwhelming for them to harness and was turned on each other,” she said. (The Craft famously ends with Balk’s, True’s, and Campbell’s characters turning against Tunney’s, their former friend.) “The message that I want to put into the universe is that there is no power too great for women to harness and that we always need to be wary of turning that power on each other. [The first film was] intersectional at a time when representation was not being prioritized in popular culture. But I wanted to take that and go further with it—to look at the ways in which the community is so much more powerful than the individual.”\n\nThe original Craft did deal with some serious stuff—racism, bullying, attempted rape, parental abuse—and while some of the same issues will be tackled in Legacy, Lister-Jones also elected to tweak her protagonist’s plotline. In the original, Tunney’s Sarah is the new girl in town raised by a widowed father. In Legacy, Spaeny’s Lily has lived with a single mother (Michelle Monaghan) her whole life when she’s uprooted from that feminine space and moved in with her mother’s new boyfriend (David Duchovny) and his three sons—a very masculine space. Lister-Jones wanted to show those two opposing energies colliding at a pivotal moment in a young woman’s life.\n\nThe director was tight-lipped about any further plot details, though she did expand on why 2020 is the perfect time to revisit The Craft. “Right now witch and witchcraft are a part of the zeitgeist,” Lister-Jones said. “Self-identifying as a witch feels a little less scary.” While the original film cast witchcraft as something to fear, Lister-Jones wanted to allow modern practitioners of witchcraft a more welcoming, nonjudgmental entry point.\n\n“It’s about both the light and the dark, and that is the beauty of witchcraft,” she said. “But it’s also very much about manifesting the divine feminine in all of us, regardless of gender. The divine feminine is something that has been so suppressed for so long. And I think the suppression of witchcraft and witch hunting and the history that those traditions have had are so much about the institution of patriarchy being terrified of women’s power.”\n\nLister-Jones also wanted to tackle toxic masculinity and the ways in which women are forced to confront it. The original Craft eventually reveals Balk’s Nancy as its villain; Legacy instead focuses on the patriarchy as its nefarious overarching force.\n\n“What excites me about genre,” Lister-Jones said, “having never created a genre film before, is that there is actually an exciting place for social commentary within it. I was interested in exploring the gray area that so many adolescent women are in when coming into their sexuality. Suddenly they’re in that liminal space of being both invisible and hyper-visible to men for the first time.”\n\nThis is also, Lister-Jones pointed out, the stage when witchcraft can really appeal to young women. A tradition that puts control back in their hands can act as a lifeline. Though the director herself hid in the bathroom when her friends tried to conjure Bloody Mary in a mirror or play light as a feather, stiff as a board during their adolescent sleepovers, Lister-Jones has more recently gotten in tune with her own inner witch: “I’d like to find a coven,” she said.\n\nIn the meantime, she’s studied various international magic practices and new moon and full moon rituals, along with the art of setting and manifesting intentions—something many don’t see as witchcraft but that has been grounded in the practice of it for centuries. Her set employed three occult consultants—witches Pam Grossman, Bri Luna, and Aerin Fogel—in order to maintain authenticity; spells were based on real magical practice, written and choreographed by Grossman. The consultants also had the important job of protecting the set, magically speaking. “Whatever portals we were opening,” said Lister-Jones, “I wanted to make sure that we were doing it with the right intentions and also closing those portals at the day’s end.”\n\nIt’s a far cry from the original film, which employed one Wiccan consultant—but also questionably foregrounded a pagan deity called Manon. Lister-Jones wasn’t a fan of Manon—a being likely inspired by Mano, a feminine personification of the moon—being portrayed as a wicked male presence who inhibits Balk’s character in what can only be described as a sexual way. “We need to get way, way more connected to the goddess worship that has been suppressed for centuries,” she said. “Worshipping a masculine god in a film that is about embodying the divine feminine feels wrong. Witchcraft has much of its roots in goddess worship, [which] was so globally essential to so many cultures and then was just really wiped out. It’s 2020, and we’re getting back into it.”\n\nThat said: “Manon does make it [into my film], I’ll say that,” Lister-Jones admitted. “I won’t say more, though.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— A First Look at Diana and Margaret Thatcher in The Crown Season Four\n\n— Celebs Roast Trump in Rhyme for John Lithgow’s Trumpty Dumpty Book\n\n— Brace Yourself for George Clooney’s Apocalyptic Movie The Midnight Sky\n\n— The Best Shows and Movies Streaming This October\n\n— Inside Netflix’s Latest Binge-able Escape, Emily in Paris\n\n— The Crown’s Young Stars on Prince Charles and Princess Di\n\n— From the Archive: How Hollywood Sharks, Mafia Kingpins, and Cinematic Geniuses Shaped The Godfather\n\n— Not a subscriber?
