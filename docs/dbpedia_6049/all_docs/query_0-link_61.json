        "text": "A coven of teen witches transforms their high school into a little shop of horrors in the magically delicious comedy/thriller The Craft. After transferring to a posh Los Angeles Catholic high school, Sarah (Robin Tunney) finds that her telekinetic gift appeals to a group of three wannabe witches, who happen to be seeking a fourth member for their rituals. Outcast Bonnie (Neve Campbell, the same year she starred in Scream), bullied Rochelle (Rachel True) and self-proclaimed “trailer trash” Nancy (Fairuza Balk), like Sarah herself, all have troubled backgrounds, which combined with their intense teen angst and nascent powers, lead to dangerous consequences. Using tools stolen from a local magic shop, the newly formed coven summons the power of Manon, a primitive deity, to exact revenge on their tormentors and transform their lives. Drunk with power, the girls (egged on by the increasingly insane Nancy) see their spells spiraling out of control, and the coven soon realizes that with magic, “whatever you give comes back three-fold,” leading to an explosive, witchcraft-powered finale. A fun high school horror flick combining Clueless, Carrie, The Breakfast Club and Sabrina the Teenage Witch, The Craft is guaranteed to put a spell on you. (Dir. by Andrew Fleming, 1996, USA, 101 mins., Rated R)"
