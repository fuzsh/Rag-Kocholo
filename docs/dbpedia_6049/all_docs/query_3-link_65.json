        "text": "Each of The Craft's characters represents an element from nature and, when brought together, they are capable of spectacular spells. Mother Nature, however, didn't seem to be on their side when the production team tried to coordinate the beach scene.\n\nBecause filming took place on a real beach, the crew had to take precautions when planning their schedule. The tides were a deciding factor, as the waves' ebb and flow determined filming space. Even though the filmmakers timed out the natural tide schedule, the sea still rose during a take and \"washed away the whole set.\"\n\nWhen the crew finally overcame their conflict with the ocean, they still faced challenges: in another attempt, while Nancy was calling for Manon to \"fill her\" - after which lightning was supposed to strike her - the crew suddenly and inexplicably lost all power.\n\nAfter production of The Craft saw many strange on-set occurrences, some of the cast members began to believe in the power of the Wiccan practice. The film's Wiccan consultant Pat Devin recalled a particular incident:\n\nOn the last day of shooting at the beach, one of the actresses asked me to dedicate her to the Path of the Goddess. We walked up the beach in the dark, away from the lights, to a cove where I dedicated her and presented her to all four quarters. For her name, she took a name that I'd told her I would have named my daughter, had I ever had one.\n\nThough Devin never revealed which actress made the request, the film appeared to leave a lasting impression on at least one of its stars.\n\nMany films today tend to use simulated visual effects to save time on filming complicated scenes; however, the filmmakers of The Craft didn't have this luxury, as their budget was fairly tight. Because using real animals was more cost-effective than CGI, the cast had to endure working with live creatures. Director Andrew Fleming shared, \"We had 10,000 snakes. There was an animal trainer, and I just said, 'Let’s get the most bugs and snakes that you can possibly manage.'\"\n\nAlong with the cast, the stunt doubles had to perform with live creatures crawling all over them.\n\nThough billed as one of the film's leads, Rachel True claimed she wasn't invited to attend press events. True has spoken about her exclusion from the film's publicity many times over the years. She recalled:\n\n[It] just seemed a little racist back then, to be honest. That you have four girls in a movie and you don't include the Black one. I did end up going on one junket because one of the other actors called the producer and said, \"What's happening here? Will you please include her?\" So they did.\n\nIn addition to allegedly leaving True out of promotions, producers reportedly forgot her when the cast got booked for other events, such as pop culture conventions.\n\nFans will recall the movie's unforgettable scene in which numerous shark carcasses line the beach. As powerful an image as that was, it wasn't The Craft's only creepy, creature-related occurrence. Adding to the list of the film's odd behind-the-scenes incidents, the cast claimed a white owl had begun to appear in several filming locations.\n\nActress Rachel True recalled, \"Neve [Campbell] pointed out this white owl that was following us around from different sets. I was like, 'That's weird.' But I was new to California and I was like, 'Maybe it's just full of owls. I don't know.'\"\n\nThough the filmmakers were never positive it was the same bird, the owl's multiple appearances during production were difficult to ignore.\n\nGiven the The Craft's dark subject matter, audiences expected the movie to be filled with haunting imagery and creepy happenings; however, the production team did experience real-life odd occurrences during filming. Director Andrew Fleming spoke in 2016 about several inexplicable phenomena that plagued both the cast and crew during production.\n\nFleming explained the incidents: \"One time we started to film outside because the forecast was good, only to be caught in a massive deluge... [and] once a flock of crows just flew [onto the set] out of nowhere.\""
