        "text": "The Craft: Legacy spoilers follow, so you've been warned.\n\nThe Craft: Legacy has been billed as a spiritual successor to the original film rather than just a straight-up sequel, but now that the film has been released, it's actually a lot more interesting than that.\n\nThe film follows the original plot beats, following a group of aspiring teenage witches who get more than they bargained for when they begin to lean into their newfound powers.\n\nAs the film continues on, it becomes apparent there's more than meets the eye about our main character Lily (Cailee Spaeny), who moves to town with her mother Helen (Michelle Monaghan) at the beginning of the film.\n\nRelated: The Craft: Legacy star reveals seriously creepy on-set experience\n\nWe eventually learn that Lily is adopted and Helen tells Lily that her birth mother was a powerful witch.\n\nIt's later revealed that her mother was none other than Nancy, marking a return for original star Fairuza Balk, and the final scene in The Craft: Legacy also sees mother and daughter reunite, setting up a lot of material to explore in a future film.\n\nThis twist wasn't just something put in for shock value at the last minute, as director Zoe Lister-Jones told IndieWire: \"It was part of my original pitch. It was always a part of my vision for the film.\n\n\"Fairuza Balk is such an idol for me on so many levels. I was really excited to see Nancy now and connect her to this new generation as the sort of Supreme.\n\nRelated: The 10 movie franchises that got rebooted quickest\n\n\"And, in a perfect world, she has a sequel that could then explore the inter-generational witchcraft communities and how they might come together to take on the evil forces at play,\" she added.\n\nAs for whether the film will get a sequel, Lister-Jones continued: \"In terms of expectations, I try not to think about [a sequel], just because I think the intersection of art and commerce is something that's very complicated for me as a filmmaker and can be damaging to the creative process.\n\n\"Of course I hope that the movie soars, but I'm just happy to share it with as many people as possible. I'm just really happy to be getting the film out there at a time when I think the world just feels very bleak.\"\n\nThe Craft reboot has received some mixed reviews overall, but we'll see if it does well enough with viewers for the studio to greenlight a follow-up.\n\nThe Craft: Legacy is out now in the UK and US.\n\nDigital Spy has launched its first-ever digital magazine with exclusive features, interviews, and videos.
