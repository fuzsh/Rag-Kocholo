        "text": "‘Tis the season for classic horror films, and Andrew Fleming’s “The Craft“ is more relevant than ever. “The Craft” is a spellbinding story of four girls who get caught up in a world of dark magic and confusing adolescence. Fleming’s take on critical issues of the 90s is refreshing and real. You don’t see these topics in most 90s teen films. This is one of the qualities that makes “The Craft” so groundbreakingly important. However, it is a bit concerning to say that the issues the film tackles are the issues we still see today.\n\nSarah, played by Robin Tunney, moves to LA with her parents and instantly feels like an outcast at her new high school. Sarah has serious mental illnesses, including depression, that still haunt her. She notices a group of other outcast girls and quickly befriends them. Neve Campbell stars as Bonnie, a shy teenage girl who hides burn scars across her body from a previous accident. Bonnie struggles with image issues and avoids any kind of attention. Rachel True’s character, Rochelle, faces racism daily. Being in a predominately white Christian school, she is one of the only black characters in the film and faces severe bullying. Fairuza Balk steals the show as Nancy Downs, a tortured soul who is constantly being held down by her environment. She is the leader of the newly formed coven consisting of Sarah, Bonnie, Rochelle and herself. Watching her slow descent into madness is as intriguing as it is utterly terrifying. There is no one else who could have played this role better than Balk. The delivery of her lines has become ingrained into pop culture (“We are the weirdos, mister”).\n\nAfter discovering a mystical book called “The Craft,” the girls have all the tools they need to get everything they desire. They believe they will gain the power to achieve their goals that they would not be able to on their own. However, the girls’ true power is not from a magical book but rather their integrity and determination. At its core, it stands against patriarchy, racism, stigmas of mental illness and beauty standards.\n\nThe film is backed by an outstanding alternative rock soundtrack. A scene with “Glory Box” by Portishead is always a 90s teen film must-have. The overall aesthetic of the film resembles that of “Clueless,” except this is her gothic twin sister… and oh yeah, they levitate, walk on water and manipulate nature.\n\nMy only real issue with the film is that the third act was a bit rushed. I think the film could have benefited from a few extra scenes to explain why the events of the third act are happening. However, the third act does not take away from the brilliance of the film and the messages it pushes forward. “The Craft” still proudly stands strongly as it did in 1996. As the Halloween season rolls around, don’t forget to rewatch this classic."
