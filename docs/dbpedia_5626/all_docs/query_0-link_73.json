THE REALTY 2013PRE VIEW 14 SEMINARS WEDNESDAY, MAY 29 WEDNESDAY, MAY 29 SEMINAR ROOM 1 14.30 Alternative financing structures in the real estate sector Organized by Laga | until 15.30 – in English. Stefaan Van Dyck, Lawyer and Member of the Brussels Bar, Laga. The financial crisis and evolutions of the financial regulatory framework applicable to banks, have had a material impact on traditional bank lending, particularly for real estate investments and development. During this presentation, we will elaborate on a number of legal structures which may offer a basis for a more diversified funding, both with respect to long(er) term investment financing and with respect to short(er) term construction and development financing. 15.30 The residential real estate market in Brussels: trends and forecasts Organized by Trevi Group | until 17.00 – in French and Dutch. Eric Verlinden, CEO Trevi Group, Olivier Reye, Director Trevi Group. For four years now, the prices of the Belgian residential real estate are no longer smooth sailing, as they tended to be in the last 10 years, both at national level and in the Brussels area. Due to erratic price changes, the owners and buyers stayed away from the real estate market, with the hope that it would find back its clarity and balance. The purpose of this study carried out by the Trevi Group is to provide the reader with an overview over the evolution that the real estate in Brussels has been undergoing since 2000. Its goal is also to give several hints about the future trends starting from now to 2015. The study will be handed out to those who attended the conference. 17.00 Greener cities for better living Organized by Windeo and Plantdesign | until 18.00 – in English. Sébastien Crepieux, Director. Nature is going back to town! Not to every town, not to every building, but there is a strong tendency to integrate in new buildings green spaces. They can be horizontal or vertical, on the facade or in the roof, sometimes inside, extensive or intensive… These techniques are green roofs, green walls, terrace or roof gardens. They offer interests for the citizens and for the biodiversity, but also great value for the buildings (protection, acoustics, isolation, hygrometry), and are a key component to deal with urban soil waterproofing, urban heat island and pollution. Integrate nature in buildings is not only good for business; it is above all good for humans. The seminar will describe different approaches for urban greening, focusing on green walls, which offer the highest interest in urbanism to help building tomorrows’ towns. The seminar will conclude on prospective towards a greater use of nature in towns. SEMINAR ROOM 2 09.00 European Real Estate Policy and Investment Forum 2013 Organized by Property EU | until 13.00 – in English. Ad Buisman, Partner, EMEIA Real Estate Leader, Ernst & Young.

Organized by Confederatie Bouw | until 17.00 – in French and Dutch. Liesbet Van Cauwenberghe, Director of Immoterrae | Linda Dedrie, Lawyer at Loyens & Loeff. During the construction phase of a project, many developers are faced with extra expense for the removal of excavated soil, even in cases where the property was purchased with a so called ‘clean’ soil certificate, delivered after soil remediation works approved by OVAM. The presence of ‘residual’ contamination does not prevent the transfer of the land under the Flemish Soil Decree, but might af- terwards - under that same Decree - lead to major unexpected costs during soil excavation works for e.g. an underground parking, road works, utility cables, etc. In this seminar we will talk about the various ways of avoiding, or at least minimizing the risk of such extra expenses. From a legal perspective, Linda Dedrie, lawyer at Loyens & Loeff, will deal with the allocation of this risk in real estate agree- ments, in the contractor’s technical specifications, etc. Secondly, the right of recourse against the seller, long term lessee, contractor etc. for hidden defects will be discussed. For the technical aspects of this subject, Liesbet Van Cauwenberghe, director of Immoterrae, will share her wide experience and advise on the steps to be taken to avoid or limit this risk. 17.00 New real estate projects along the Brussels/Luxemburg axis, at the heart of Wallonia Organized by BEP, IBW and IDELUX | until 19.00 – in French.

ORA-ÏTO, designer. In 2009, Art & Build, an international architectural practice based in Brussels, initiated a series of special lectures on the occasion of the first Realty trade fair. The idea was to open the real estate debate to other horizons, highlighting core values practiced by the firm since 1989 – values which inform the European city of tomorrow. In 2009, sustainability was in the spotlight, with Michael Braungart introducing the Cradle to Cradle paradigm – a revolutionary approach to industrial production without waste – for the first time to an enraptured Belgian audience. In 2011, it was Jacques Attali, economist, writer, political advisor and founder of the European Bank or Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), who treated the audience to ‘A Brief History of the Future’ of European cities. The 2013 Realty fair will look at “Creativity as an economic driving force”. Art & Build has invited star designer Ora-Ïto to draw upon his experience and share his vision of the city of tomorrow – this on the eve of his new art centre in Marseille which will open up the rooftop of Le Corbusier’s Cité Radieuse to the public. The lecture will be introduced by Etienne de Callataÿ, Chief Economist at Degroof Bank, and will be followed by an exclusive walking diner at the exhibitors’ special evening.\n\n20.

Danny Stas, Partner Laga | Ivan Massin, Director. Recently the Belgian VAT authorities published new administrative guidelines on the VAT position of commercial centres (shopping malls, retail parks etc.). The guidelines in particular provide an extensive comment on the VAT recovery method to be applied by commercial centres. This follows from the specific VAT regime applicable to the agreements concluded with the tenants/shops. The provision of the shops is VAT exempt whilst the provision of the common areas is subject to VAT. The question then is how to determine the ratio of the VAT recovery as only part of the agreement is subject to VAT.\n\n22. THE REALTY 2013PRE VIEW 22 INFO\n\n23. INFO 23 For over 50 years Leiedal has been estab- lishing business parks to support the eco- nomicdevelopmentoftheregionofKortrijk. We will continue to do so in the future, but ourfocushasshifted.Untilrecentlyallbusi- ness parks were developed on so-called greenfields, whereas from now on we will focus on the reconversion of abandoned business sites. In the period 2007-2012 it was our ambition to plan 30% of new develop- ment in reconversion zones. This ambition was fully realized with the acquisition and re- conversionofthesitesBekaertZwevegem(DeBlokken,10ha),GroenbekWaregem(15ha), Nelca Lendelede (7ha) and Emdeka Bellegem (4ha). A second ambition is to improve the quality and sustainability of these business parks and integrate them into their (urban) surroundings. The establishment of a park man- agement is to guarantee long-term quality. Besides, Leiedal is trying to revitalise the first-generation business sites. The city of Kortrijk does the same with build- ings. Due to movements and development, somebigspotsinthecitycentrewillcomefree (hospitals, secondary school buildings, Police office, Belgacom Building etc). Kortrijk wants to adapt these old buildings for new uses; Re- usewiththefocuson “qualityofliving”.Public- private cooperation is an essential issue here. The AGB Stadsontwikkelingsbedrijf Kortrijk, an autonomous municipal company and town development department acts as a link between city and private parties. Numer- ous challenges are still awaiting Kortrijk. Kortrijk | Leiedal stand 3301 Kortrijk is a city in evolution, we would be pleased to let you take part of it! www.leiedal.be | www.agsok.be"
