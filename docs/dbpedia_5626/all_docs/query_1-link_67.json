        "text": "V2i has developed advanced systems based on several sensors, which can assess, in real time, the quality of the weld seam. The seam profile analysis is completed via powerful data handling which allows various weld defects, such as broad or narrow seams, holes, or misaligned strips and foreign objects to be detected reliably. A wide range of indicators have been defined according to the defects tracked. A statistical tool has been integrated, which correlates the defect with operating welder parameters. The system keeps on improving over years and adjusting the limits for each type of steel.\n\nFor a new nuclear power plant project, Vinçotte was requested the development of a procedure for the mechanized ultrasonic examination of reactor pressure vessel nozzle-to-integrated nozzle shell welds. These carbon steel heavy section narrow gap welds have a welded stainless steel clad on the inside, from which the ultrasonic examination must be performed. The examination should cover the complete narrow gap weld volume and adjacent base material. Dedicated phased array probes were designed to provide the required detection and sizing capabilities. A specific procedure was developed using data from welded mock-ups and simulation software.\n\nThe development of weld defect acceptance criteria has been historically influenced by the technological limitations of Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) technology. The actual shape of a real defect differs from the simplified shapes that are assumed within flaw assessment methodologies. In this sense, a feasibility study has been undertaken towards the development of a numerical framework for flaw assessment, where the detailed (irregular) geometry of a weld and its defect are considered and may be automatically fed into a finite element analysis (FEA) using scan results obtained from Full Matrix Capture (FMC) ultrasonic and Computed Tomography (CT) systems.\n\nThe lecture describes the state of the art and current developments in the field of welding process monitoring based on electrical and thermographic parameters. Tailored to current application examples, solution strategies for fault detection for automated arc welding, resistance spot welding and laser soldering processes are presented. The possibilities of the dynamic process analysis of the energetic parameters (welding current, welding voltage) for the detection of pores, burn-through defects and wire disturbances will be illuminated as well as the application possibilities of passive thermography by evaluation of the heat radiation of the still glowing seam. The explanations are supplemented by current application examples.\n\nPlants are constantly challenged when trying to examine hard-to-reach areas. Combining long-term experience in remote-operated crawlers with expert knowledge in non-destructive examination (NDE), Framatome provides various technologies for inspection of hardly accessible areas. In-pipe manipulators have several advantages for flexible application in vertical or horizontal piping including elbows. The presentation will give an overview on the present in-pipe manipulator development for pipe ID 75 to 110 mm as well as the NDE techniques adapted for the pipe`s examination. Focus will be placed on the capabilities and features for visual inspection (VT), eddy-current (ET) and ultrasonic testing (UT) as well as result assessment.\n\nWith the introduction of small portable Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) systems, the replacement of radiography by ultrasonic inspection techniques for testing of welds in thin-walled steel components has become a promising proposition. Over the past few years, several equipment suppliers have developed crawler based systems that enable the application of PAUT testing of welds in thin-wall (3.2 –8 mm) ferritic steel material. During a preceding KINT project, a PAUT technique description was developed, which resulted in a base document for ISO Standard (ISO/DIS 20601:2017). Following on from the technique description, the current PAUT project, aims to produce scientific and practical foundation as well as a draft ISO Acceptance Criteria Standard for this application.\n\nThe use of Automotive TWBs (Tailor Welded Blanks) represents an advanced manufacturing process consisting on the combination of multiple metal sheets that are seam-welded together prior to deformation. EMAT is the best technique for volumetric inspection of thin laser welds present in automotive components. Initially implemented for weld quality assessment, it is being used in the industry more and more for weld process control. This presentation covers OPTIBLANKS development, the first EMAT-Vision hybrid process control system, featuring unified rejection criteria using information from both technologies to make smarter and more robust decisions, leading to optimized manufacturing and quality.\n\nInspection of power, process and other industrial plants remains a labour intensive activity. In the case of high temperature power and process plant components replication is the most common form of indicator of the damage size and thus the safe remaining life. A new Electromagnetic (EM) technique has been developed which does not need any surface preparation and has shown promise as a possible alternative or as an aid to the traditional replication. Some preliminary work on the use of this technique on high temperature plant component damage detection and quantification has appeared to be promising. Some of the research and on-site work carried out using EM scanning will be discussed in this presentation."
