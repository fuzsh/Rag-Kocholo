All Vinçotte employees are eager and sincerely passionate to find the most suitable solution for our customers.\n\n(Self-)development\n\nWe focus on the development of our people and give them opportunities to grow. We set high standards, and are never satisfied in our eagerness to excel.\n\n(Self-)respect\n\nVinçotte employees must respect themselves and their colleagues. This manifests itself in their work, the safety regulations they comply with and their behaviour towards colleagues, clients and suppliers.\n\nSince 1872\n\nYou can count on almost 140 years of know-how and experience from a recognised inspection body, and a notified body with the European Union. Vinçotte combines knowledge of multinationals with experience of SMEs, irrespective of the sector.\n\nWorldwide\n\nYou call on the services of a worldwide organisation (with 13 establishments on five continents) which has positioned itself as an internationally recognisable brand name with a well-known logo.\n\nFlexible\n\nThanks to the versatile way in which our labs are organised, we are in a position to offer the most flexible support for product and materials analysis, as well as in-situ non-destructive testing.\n\nImpartial\n\nYou always receive an unbiased, independent service.\n\nHighly qualified\n\nYou work with highly qualified engineers and technical specialists who have specialised, sector-specific expertise, and who guarantee an up-to-date service in line with the very latest insights and techniques, thanks to their ongoing training and their contacts with the academic world.\n\nVinçotte was established almost 140 years ago, and since 1989 it has existed in the form of a merger of AIB and Vinçotte: the strengths of the two entities pooled as a 100% Belgian enterprise.\n\nThe name Vinçotte refers to Robert Vinçotte, who in 1872 was given the task by a small number of industrialists to make steam boilers safer. At that time steam was the main source of energy for industry.\n\nAIB stood for “Association des Industriels de Belgique”, and was set up in 1890 by Henri Adan, with the aim of carrying out preventive research and taking measures to prevent industrial accidents.\n\nWith a market share of around 75% on its home market of Belgium, Vinçotte is today one of the foremost inspection bodies in the euro zone."
