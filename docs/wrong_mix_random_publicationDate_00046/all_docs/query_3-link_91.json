        "text": "After tonight I want to take a short writing vacation, i really, really want a new book.\n\nbut since Im an ebay seller/buyer and i live a block away from a huge used book store, literally every author I like, I have tracked down every book they own and read them all.\n\nI need something new, an author I dont know about. I want lighter reading, a novel of some sort.\n\nSo my favorite authors that best reflect what I enjoy:\n\nKurt Vonnegut\n\nHerman Hesse\n\nJohn Irving\n\nChuck Pahliunuk\n\nJames Clavelle\n\nJonathan Safran Foer\n\nPaolo Coelho\n\nTom Robbins\n\nNeil gaiman\n\nMilan kundera\n\nSo considering that list, do you enjoy any of those authors and can think of someone related I might be able to find tonight at either a local bookstore or a borders?\n\noh yeah, asimov, piers anthony, heinlein and dan brown are also already well covered for light reading\n\nany thoughts? Ive proven to be genuinely incapable of just browsing around and finding a gem\n\nthat is a great suggestion and right down my alley, but its been read and re-read, as have most classics from aesop to virgil, im searching for something from this century, even this decade...someone I may have never heard of or is not so well known.\n\nMaybe take a spin on mystery and crime with two stellar women authors...Nevada Barr and Janet Evanovich.\n\nI guarantee that you will laugh our arse off reading Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels and want to know more about history, geology, ecology, and crime with the Barr books.\n\nFor sure, these are lighter works, maybe a change of pace from Vonnegut, Hesse, Irving, and the others. Sometimes it's good to escape.\n\nHave you read any of James Patterson's books? I think he's absolutely brilliant and have read loads of his. He wrote a lot of police crime thrillers but his Maximum Ride series are amazing! They're about children that are half-bird/half-human. Oh I think he might still be a cop in those books too, can't remember.\n\nGlad that you like Neil Gaiman - top author.\n\nDon't know if you have tried Stephen R. Donaldson - his Thomas Covenant series is one that I return to often. Philip Pullman is another - 'His Dark Materials' hits the spot. Robert E. Howard's Conan is very underrated - much more subtle than people give him credit for. There is Terry Pratchett, too - good for light relief.\n\nThat's all - I need to place a big Amazon order soon, or learn better Greek"
