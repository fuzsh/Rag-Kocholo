Bennett, January 2000)\n\nThis collection of papers, books, serials, and other materials, designated WSB98, was given to OSU in 1998 by the Estate of William S. Burroughs (James W. Grauerholz, Executor). Throughout this Guide, \"WSB\" refers to William S. Burroughs, and \"JWG\" refers to James W. Grauerholz. WSB's son, William S. Burroughs, Jr., is referred to as \"William S. Burroughs, Jr.\"\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis collection of materials, originally gathered by James W. Grauerholz, William S. Burroughs' assistant and editor, includes drafts and editorial materials for some of WSB's publications; copies of many of WSB's publications from the 1970's and 1980's; correspondence, fan mail, and printed matter received from the mid-1970's through the mid-1980's; books, chapbooks, and magazines received or acquired during the same period; Burroughs Communications business, travel, and tour files from that period; serial and other publications from that period including work by WSB, and/or reviews of and/or articles about WSB; and much other material.\n\nIn addition to providing source material for the study of WSB's life and works, this collection provides information about the avant-garde literary, art, and music worlds of the 1970's and 1980's, primarily in North America, but also in Europe and elsewhere. There is abundant correspondence, manuscript, and published material from a wide variety of writers and other artists, both contemporaries of WSB and younger artists and writers. Many of the latter are also represented in OSU's Avant Writing Collection.\n\nAmong the highlights of this collection are several manuscripts and drafts of WSB's book The Cat Inside, 1984-1986; a large collection of science fiction and other books and serials belonging to WSB, mostly published from the mid-1960's to the early 1980's; WSB's notes for a class he gave on Samuel Beckett and Marcel Proust (folder 118); a transcript of a 1960 interview with WSB (folder 166); a galley copy of WSB's 1977 edition of Junky (folder 176); and bound galleys of William S. Burroughs, Jr.'s 1984 book, Kentucky Ham (box 28). Throughout the collection there is correspondence with, or material about, Brion Gysin, John Giorno, Victor Bockris, Edie Kerouac Parker, Allen Ginsberg, Terry Southern, Patti Smith, Paul Bowles, Jack Kerouac, Claude Pelieu, James Grauerholz, and many others.\n\nIt should be noted that all material on a given topic is not necessarily in the same box; for example, material relating to The Cat Inside may be found throughout this collection. Further material on any given topic may be found in other WSB collections in the OSU Libraries.\n\nWILLIAM S.
