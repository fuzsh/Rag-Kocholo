        "text": "September 10, 2016\n\nThe Western Lands wraps up the Red Night trilogy with a more involved look at the pilgrimage thereto, intercut with crosscurrents from the Egyptian Book of the Dead and remembrances from the author’s own life, the mass of which merges into a hallucinogenic exploration of the potentialities inherent in our concept of the great beyond. Part memoir, part attempt to provide closure to the impossibly sprawling mythology he’s created, this book feels doubly relevant as we watch the story and W.S.B. himself galloping rapidly to their end:\n\n\"Forty years ago the writer had published a novel which had made a stir. [...] He still had the clippings, but they were yellow and brittle now and he never looked at them. If he had removed them from the cellophane covering in his scrapbook they would have shredded to dust. [...] Often in the morning he would lie in bed and watch grids of typewritten words in front of his eyes that moved and shifted as he tried to read [them], but he never could. He thought if he could just copy these words down, which were not his own words, he might be able to put together another book and then... yes, and then what?\"\n\nIt is perhaps impossible to miss the autobiographical quality of this passage, though to dwell on this aspect is to miss the deeper connection implied between the dying writer and the countless other deaths realized in our vain quest for immortality. Whether one seeks eternal life through their artistic legacy or by literally questing for the holy grail that is the Western Lands, only one thing is sure -- “Life is very dangerous and few survive it.”\n\nThe word is out now that life after death is a real possibility, no longer a matter of unsubstantiated faith. As governments collapse and global catastrophe inches closer and closer, a “Great Awakening” washes over the land, and a mass of pilgrims as determined as they are desperate flock to heed the call:\n\n\"Just as the Old World mariners suddenly glimpsed a round Earth to be circumnavigated and mapped, so awakened pilgrims catch hungry flashes of vast areas beyond Death to be created and discovered and charted, open to anyone ready to take a step into the unknown, a step as drastic and irretrievable as the transition from water to land. [...] The pilgrimage to the Western Lands has started, the voyage through the Land of the Dead. Waves of exhilaration sweep the planet, awash in seas of silence. There is hope and purpose in these faces, and total alertness, for this is the most dangerous of all roads, for every pilgrim must meet and overcome his own death.\"\n\nKim is now en route to The Western Lands, along with Neferti, Hassan i Sabbah, and a host of others as they each attempt their own treacherous journey, fraught with every kind of danger imaginable. And while there is no shortage of deadly foes and lethal traps to be evaded or otherwise dealt with along the way, including (but certainly not limited to) the noxious “Breathers”, flying venomous scorpions, and Open Season duelists around every corner, perhaps the biggest impediment to progress on the pilgrim’s path is the sheer uncertainty of how best to proceed. As we are told at the outset of chapter seven:\n\n\"Today’s easy passage may be tomorrow’s death trap. The obvious road is almost always a fool’s road, and beware the Middle Roads, the roads of moderation, common sense and careful planning. However, there is a time for planning, moderation and common sense.\"\n\nSound advice to be sure (wherever one’s destination), but when the eternal soul is on the line, seekers generally seek for more direct guidance than that! Perhaps this explains why we remain so inclined to find our way within the context of this or that philosophy, science, or religion -- as ultimately flawed beings, flawed as we are in terms of even basic perception, it is perhaps unsurprising that we so often look to others for the way. Then again, this would also explain why so few (if any) of us ever succeed in reaching the Western Lands....\n\nIf you somehow missed the first two books in this series, reincarnate yourself at the beginning with Cities of the Red Night.\n\nNovember 8, 2019\n\nThe final book in the wild and crazy Red Night trilogy by one of America's greatest avant-garde authors. Here are just two quotes from a brilliant book that is full of such musings:\n\n“It is inconceivable that Homo sapiens could last another thousand years in present form. People of such great stupidity and such barbarous manners. And what do years mean, apart from human measurement and perception? Does time pass if there is no one there to register it’s passing? Of course not, since Time is a figment of human perception.”\n\n“Messages from headquarters? What headquarters? Every man for himself—if he's got a self left. Not many do.”\n\nMay 23, 2023\n\nAll the filth and horror, fear, hate, disease and death of human history flows between you and the Western Lands. Let it flow!\n\nBehind the gonzo is the Menippean and behind that is something earnest. Confessional and deprecating, Burroughs succeeds when he isn't overburdened with toxicology and endless penises. I nearly gasped at occasion on how beautiful the prose was only to encounter a taxonomy of small arms and blow guns. There's a nod to Carson McCullers which I didn't expect. It possibly knocked me knee deep in Burrough's river of shit, okay some of it made its way into my mouth. I meditated and all was forgiven. The Egyptian Book of the Dead features prominently as does some sort of tropical Hajj. Centipedes feature in a bizarre notion of molar responsibility and Pre-Columbian sacrifice.\n\nSeptember 27, 2014\n\nSheer genius.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, the conclusion to the trilogy is not as sex-charged as the other novels. This is a real masterpiece. The narrative structure uses a blend of Egyptian mythology (Book of the Dead) and the craziness of a not-too-far-off world. Well, let's not hope not. So in this sense, I couldn't help but feel that Burroughs is writing this as a kind of warning.\n\nI absolutely loved Cities of the Red Night and thought to myself at the time, 'There is no way Burroughs is going to top this one. No way'. But lo and behold, he has. This book is unbelievable.\n\nIt was easily the best book I read in 2011 and with all the turmoil and mad weather patterns currently going on in the world, the pre-apocalytpic tone throughout the book seems to be so relevant to present times. Just like Kerouac was ahead of his time in terms of style (spontaneous bop prosody), Burroughs has penned an eerily accurate portrait of what kind of world we might be heading for - if you can decode all the metaphors in the book. I couldn't in one reading and that is why I'm going to read it again.\n\nThis has to be the coolest book I have ever read, even better than Marching Powder. I'm currently reading The Wild Boys which is somewhat disappointing compared to this novel.\n\nApril 3, 2012\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs is one of my visionary writers. That means I believe he did something like what the prophets did at one time. They saw and wrote things that were not entirely comprehensible, but those writings reveal things about life and were usually a critique of society. Other writers I consider to be in this category are Plato, William Blake, John Milton, Arthur Schopenhauer, Henry David Thoreau, J.R.R. Tolkien, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Philip K. Dick.\n\nThis book begins with the claim, by the author, that throughout his life he independently worked out a view of what happens to mortals when we die. He said it turned out that his view coincides with the ancient Egyptian description of how the 7 souls of a person attempts to make the trek across the desert to the Western Lands when we die. The book moves on to the story of an elderly writer who had written only one famous book a long time ago and who was living in an abandoned railroad car. The book continues with episodes of the kind we expect from William S. Burroughs. The book ends with the death of that writer.\n\nIf you are going to read only one book by William S. Burroughs I would recommend that it be either \"Naked Lunch\" or \"The Western Lands\". Actually, I recommend adults to read both. \"Naked Lunch\" is the book that Burroughs is remembered for. It captures the author in his prime. However, it is a vulgar book that will be justifiably offensive to many people. Still, I believe it and the rest of William S. Burroughs' work to be literature and worth reading.\n\n\"The Western Lands\" is Burroughs at the end of his career as a writer. He did write a famous book a long time ago and he was living in Kansas, not a railroad car, when he wrote the book. \"The Western Lands\" will give the reader a taste of Burroughs without having to endure unrestrained vulgarity and offensive scenes. That is not to say the book is devoid of vulgarity and patently inoffensive. It is still Burroughs, and worth reading, but it is a kinder, gentler Burroughs.\n\nWhen I read the description of the journey of the 7 souls I thought, 'huh?' and chalked it up to being another of those incomprehensible things that I read that someone else believed.\n\nLately, I have been reading Arthur Schopenhauer's \"The World as Will and Representation\". The book claims the human soul has a minimum of two parts, 1. The intellect and 2. self-knowledge, and maybe there are more. We also have The Will separate from the soul. That makes at least 3 parts to what we think of as our immaterial selves or our souls.\n\nReading Schopenhauer's long work makes the multi-part soul imaginable if not plausible. I still think, 'huh?' But I am not nearly so dismissive as I was. Schopenhauer gives me a renewed appreciation of the much shorter idea described in Burroughs' \"The Western Lands\".\n\nRead\n\nAugust 8, 2016\n\nTek kada sam počeo da čitam ovaj treći deo trilogije (“Gradovi crvene noći” i “Mesto mrtvih puteva”), video sam koliko je Barouz zapravo imao velikog uticaja na moj stil pisanja.\n\nGradovi crvene noći su me oduševili, verovatno zato što je to prvo delo ovog autora sa kojim sa imao zadovoljstvo da se upoznam (čak sam i film Goli ručak pogledao posle čitanja ove knjige).\n\nZapadne zemlje nastavljaju tradiciju totalno trpoznog ludiranja kroz banalnost mediokritetskog sveta koji nam naši očevi redovno oktroišu i borbu kreativnih duhova i umetničkih duša da nađu svoj deo kosmosa koji nije zatrovan običnim ljudima. U ovom romanu autor pokušava da uz pomoć likova iz prva dva dela trilogije pronađe put u besmrtnost.\n\nKnjiga je prepuna totalno blesavih i šašavih ideja. Meni je gotovo svaki pasus davao ideju za po jedan roman.\n\nIstovremeno ova knjiga može da se čita kao besmisleno trabunjanje nadrogiranog autora koji je pati od nedostatka inspiracije ili zdravog razuma.\n\nOd svih delova trilogije najsličnija je Golom ručku, sa istim brojem buba i mnogo većom količinom pederisanja.\n\nZapadne zemlje nisu za svakoga. Neki će da ih vole, neki će da ih mrze, ali niko neće da ostane ravnodušan. A to je ono najbolje što umetnost može da pruži.\n\nSeptember 15, 2019\n\nOverall I'd say this is one of the authors more accessible and entertaining works, and while still retaining an air of abstraction, temporal distortion and general twistedness, it is markedly more coherent than his earlier fiction. The cut and paste technique along with copious amounts of gay sex and drug use are absent.\n\nThe themes dealt with include; Egyptian mythology, centipede worship, vampirism and toxicology.This is interspersed with stream of consciousness and dream recall writing that help to give it an edge over more traditional fiction and helps break up the shifting narrative.\n\nMarch 25, 2020\n\n\"The road to the Western Lands is by definition the most dangerous road in the world, for it is a journey beyond Death...\"\n\nIn the world according to William Burroughs, even the afterlife is subject to governmental control. Just as the pharaohs attempted to monopolize immortality, so do our present day leaders, through petty, everyday controls and restrictions all the up to the deployment of the ultimate soul destroyer - the atom bomb.\n\nFighting the system is Margaras, the White Cat: a fearsome spirit, Hunter, Tracker, supreme assassin. Also Margaras Unlimited, a 'secret service without a nation'. For its agents such as Neferti and a reincarnated Kim Carsons, everything and everyone is fair game, e.g. blackmailing ex-Naxis in hiding.\n\nAmoral yes, but remember the motto of Hassan-i-Sabbah, the master of the order of the Assassons - or rather let Burroughs remind you, as he tends to do in each of his publications:\n\n\"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.\"\n\nIndeed, HIS actually appears as a character this time, on the lam in Egypt during his missing years there, evading his enemies, but also looking for the way into the Western Lands, a way to circumvent the Anubis Gates.\n\nAll the author's spare but powerfully descriptive prose is on display; few writers can conjure up time and place so swiftly and so sensually with just a few lines. The use of cut-up passages is rare but effective, the nasty homoerotic passages virtually edited out entirely.\n\nThen there is the humor, always a strong point. Many examples could be quoted, this is typical:\n\n\"Good. Then these letters of safe conduct are for you. Does this town boast a hotel?\"\n\n\"We do not boast, but there is the Hotel Splendide.\"\n\nThis is the final part of a trilogy of novels which taken together pretty much round out the whole of literary outlaw Burrough's paranoid, unique vision of the world, aided here by his recent discovery of Egyptian theology via Norman Mailer's Ancient Evenings, where he found a whole new set of controls and escapes to play around with.\n\nIt's not exactly a narrative trilogy - in fact, Burroughs can hardly keep a coherent story going for much more than 20-30 pages tops before it implodes into an orgy of sodomy and revenge fantasies - but it's certainly a trilogy in theme and phrase, with the same preoccupations and quotations returning again and again.\n\nIf I would recommend one of Burroughs' works to a new reader, it would probably be this one, despite being the last book in a trilogy.\n\nJanuary 4, 2008\n\nMore of a memoir than the final book of a trilogy. After reading The Place of Dead Roads and Cities of the Red Night I was slavering for the end of the series. From colonial privateerism, to manifest-destiny cowboys, this imagined sexual mystic outlaw history of the nationalistic push \"west\" or \"out\" and the counter-push \"in\" and against one's society would have a fascinating conclusion in the Egyptian struggle for immortality.\n\nThis book seriously lacks the kinetic intensity of its predecessors, however, and burroughs frequently \"digresses\" (yes you can say such a thing). Though characters and themes are present from the previous books, they are more memories. He drops the ball on the sexual language theme. To top it off, this book offer far less opportunities to go beat off than one expects.\n\nReally a great memoir, of an author talking to his characters, despite the fact that it doesnt really belong in the series.\n\nAugust 16, 2014\n\nAs with all of Burroughs work there are so many themes that could be expanded on and made into separate novels - if only the author lived to complete all his ideas.... The Western lands scatters across all of the author's interests, ancient Egypt, time travel, Arabian assassins, weapons, erotic imagery, medical manipulations... If I were to choose one theme, one novel, possibly extracted from this, his last major work, then it would be a novel based on the expedition to capture the giant centipede, along with the correspondence from Dean Ripa, Snake expert - A kind of Yage letters with the centipede as the holy grail of disgust...\n\nBurroughs in this trilogy is a great travel writer. A travel writer not just through places, but through time and space and outer space. A literary map-maker. His eye for detail and imagination for the absurd make this an interesting journey.\n\nBut be warned. If a linear plot is required or if you are new to Burroughs the Western Lands is not the best place to look.\n\nJune 8, 2015\n\nThis is a beautiful book. Burroughs is much calmer here than in his famed Nova trilogy which actually makes his satire even sharper as he himself seems to be coming from a more stable position in his own life. Now he's more comfortable to transition into more straight forward digressions on mortality and Egyptian mythology musings. Not for everyone of course (being Burroughs, there are of course multiple sections with bizarrely graphic sexual violence and perhaps more information on centipede venom than the average reader could care for) but this is essential for anyone with an interest in WSB.\n\nJuly 2, 2017\n\nNot with a bang, but with a whimper, som man brukar säga. Den har sina briljanta partier men författaren beskriver sin \"writer's block\" från och till, och det märks kanske på slutresultatet, som inte flödar lika fritt och galet som de tidigare böckerna, utan snarare stapplar fram.\n\nDet blir förstås ingen upplösning. Burroughs anarkism riktar sig förstås mot makten, i både världen men också i själva narrativet. De stora historierna dekonstrueras, och detta gäller även hans egen mytologi. Finns verkligen the western lands (fortfarande)? Den profetisk-gudomliga Hassan i Sabbah omskrivs här istället genom sin mänsklighet. Han är ingen världsfrånvänd mästare, ingen Gud på ett moln, utan han riskerar sitt eget liv tillsammans med varje lärjunge han tar sig an.\n\nBurroughs var före sin tid. 20 år innan lolcatz för han här fram katter som det bästa som finns i livet. Motsatsen är tusenfotingar. Den som tycker tusenfotingar är gulliga på samma sätt som en normal människa tycker katter är gulliga, han är en artförrädare som bör avrättas på plats, menar Burroughs.\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nLike, I don't even know where to begin with his books. His voice is quintessentially american, but especially the last trilogy is like all sorts of religious type stuff.\n\nIt's like a gay hieronomyous boch painting but as a novel.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 12, 2022\n\nNo recollection. (Nice cover art though, I do remember that.)\n\nMarch 9, 2014\n\nTărîmurile Vestice este volumul care încheie trilogia Cut up. Aparuta în 1987, cartea este scrisă de un Burroughs bătrîn, “ajuns la capătul cuvintelor, a ceea ce se poate face din cuvinte”. Romanul este considerat testamentul lui Burroughs ceea ce nu este departe de adevăr, deoarece în aceste pagini poate fi aflat un Burroughs agonizînd, un Burroughs care încearcă să împace cu ajutorul cuvintelor îmbătrînirea cărnii şi toate durerile fizice si psihice cumulate pînă la această vîrstă.\n\nEste cel mai greu de digerat roman din toate cele şase ale sale citite de mine pînă acum. Deşi nu mai este la fel de pornografic şi violent ca cele anterioare, cuvintele sunt mult mai apăsătoare datorită mesajului şi imaginilor care de această dată au o factură psihologică. Este un adevărat drum către purgatoriu, drumul către o viaţă veşnică înspăimîntătoare şi rigidă, o viaţă veşnică conformă cu viaţa dusă în această dimensiune şi realitate. Impresia pe care o lasă la un moment dat romanul este aceea că Burroughs este, de fapt, toate personajele sale, toate acele personalităţi ce sunt în căutarea tărîmurilor vestice sunt bătrînul ce acum tr��ieşte înconjurat de pisici într-o rulotă, aşteptînd inevitabilul. Senzaţia că personajele din carte sunt avataruri ale autorului şi că Burroughs se dematerializează luînd alte corpuri pentru a săvîrşi o călătorie iniţiatică este pregnantă, dar nu poate fi spus categoric acest lucru. Obişnuit să lucreze cu senzaţii, să producă deliruri şi fantezii narcotice, autorul se joace cu toată paleta de cunoştinţe a cititorului, dărîmînd, conform stilului său inconfundabil, tarele etice, religioase si proclamînd în loc un spaţiu dincolo de realitate, atemporal, menit a pune în aplicare toate pornirile şi dorinţele din timpul vieţii. Drumul e plin de magic şi grotesc, de rituri uitate şi păgîne, un fel de drum ce pare a fi călătoria finală a corpului alături de suflet, pentru ca într-un final, corpul sau sufletul să fie purificat, o purificare ciudată şi barbară, o purificare prin violenţă şi cruzime, o purificare comandată şi guvernată de forţe oculte şi politice.\n\nTărîmurile Vestice poate fi considerat o epopee în adevăratul sens al cuvîntului, aventurile personajelor aducînd aminte de Ulise şi Ahile iar bătrînul ajuns la capătul cuvintelor, poate fi comparat cu Homer. Deşi Burroughs nu este orb pare a scrie din inerţie, o forţă exterioară lui impune aşternerea cuvintelor pe hîrtie, acesta fiind rolul său final din tragedia umană, izvorîtă din toate substanţele toxice consumate pînă la acest moment.\n\nDupă mine, Burroughs plăteşte tributul final drogurilor prin această carte, plăteşte tributul lumilor construite din fuga dementă a narcoticelor prin mintea şi venele sale. Nu este un om sfîrşit, Burroughs a ajuns la sfîrşit iar acum derulează genericul pentru a da o ultimă explicaţie acestei lumi pe care s-ar putea să nu o fi acceptat vreodată.\n\n“Vreau să ajung în Tărîmurile Vestice – chiar înaintea ta, peste pîrîul bolborosind. E un canal îngheţat. E cunoscut ca Duad, îţi aminteşti? Tot jegul şi oroarea, frica, ura, boala şi moartea istoriei umane se scurge între tine şi Tărîmurile Vestice. Las-o să se scurgă! Pisica mea Fletch se întinde în spatele meu pe pat. Un copac cu dantelă neagră pe un cer gri. O străfulgerare de bucurie.\n\nCît îi ia unui om să inveţe că el nu poate, că nu poate să vrea ceea ce el vrea?\n\nTrebuie să fii în Iad ca să vezi Paradisul. Întrezăriri ale Tărîmului Mortului, străfulgerări ale unei bucurii serene fără timp, o bucurie la fel de bătrînă precum suferinţa sau moartea.”\n\nRecenzie publicata pe http://razvanvanfirescu.wordpress.com/\n\nDecember 12, 2016\n\nLow grade Burroughs. Burroughs' masterpieces are driven by hallucinogenic fuel, e.g., heroin (Naked Lunch) and dreams (My Education: A Book of Dreams). Running on empty for this one, had to force myself to finish. Some flashes of brilliance (the encounter with the Bible lady, St. Humwawa, Chapter 8, \"let go of the balloon,\" THE VALLEY). Unfortunately, the highlights were embedded in page after page of boring stuff that put me to sleep.\n\nMarch 22, 2011\n\nThe final volume of Burroughs' final trilogy is a rumination on death, mortality and immortality, morality and ethics, and freedom. The western lands of the title comes from Egyptian mythology, but as with the previous book, The Place of Dead Roads: A Novel, there is a lot of the American west here, as well. Burroughs is concerned with the journey, migration, movement, not content to sit still, and not satisfied with a heaven that can be achieved without struggle.\n\nJanuary 1, 2013\n\nBill Burroughs exercises the aging writer's motif of confronting one's mortality here, using his Cities of the Red Night and Ancient Egyptian polytheism as a vehicle. He's still out to euthanize bigots and the ilk, but less pointedly. Rather, this is more of an autobiography that takes significant license with the medium. An enjoyable experiment.\n\nThing is, whenever I read Burroughs, I can't help but hear his broken voice in that offbeat pace, and it scares the bejesus outta me.\n\nMay 10, 2008\n\nThe perfect book: as wise as it is wise assy, downright hilarious. WSB's timing got so much better as he got older; this is certainly his best book and a viable handbook to the after life. Methinks it the very best book I've ever read.\n\nFebruary 25, 2020\n\nBurroughs wrote a number of similar book: Cities of the Red Night, etc. Only later were they presented as part of a series. The Western Lands of one of WSB's best, and represents a type of culmination and distillation.\n\nNow classified as #3 of a trilogy.\n\nSeptember 1, 2007\n\nI really like the old William Burroughs a lot before he got too obsessed with cats. This book is absolutely wonderful, sad, weird.\n\nJune 12, 2009\n\nIf you enjoy books with purpose, don't waste your time.\n\nAugust 8, 2010\n\nHis most beautiful/eloquent prose and a great ending to the late trilogy\n\nDecember 26, 2021\n\n\"The pilgrimage to the Western lands has started, the voyage through the Land of the Dead. Waves of exhilaration sweep the planet, awash in seas of silence. There is hope and purpose in these faces, and total alertness, for in the most dangerous of all roads, for every pilgrim must meet and overcome his death.\"\n\nReading a William Burroughs now gives me this warm fuzzy comfy feeling. It's so nice to be back with my weird Avant Garde great uncle. I don't care what the hell he's going on about. But in this here, his last book he is a lot more understandable and focused and less obscene than normal.\n\nI would recommend anyone thinking of reading this first reads 'Cities of the Red Night' and 'The Place of Dead Roads' the earlier parts of this trilogy. Not because of any plot threads. (Ha plot!) Or recurring characters or themes or anything that would normally link trilogies of books together. No, just do it because it's the right thing to do. To fully appreciate this one you need a bit of a run up to it. Enjoy that Burroughs head space. Of course you don't need to. And this, I would say is the best of the three, perhaps the best he has written.\n\nAt the end of this book he is really trying to say all he can while he can. Like 'The Tempest'. Like 'The Waste Land' (which is quoted throughout and in the earlier books, even on the last line of this one. Even maybe alluded to in the title.) There's nothing held back in this one. He's ran himself out, he's finished because -\n\n\"The old writer couldn't write anymore because he had reached the end of words, the end of what can be done with words.\"\n\nBurroughs was the last writer to make a leap forward in literature, maybe the last there will ever be. I think he was inspired by the advances in art and applied them to writing. The cut up technique is collage. His parade of grotesques, horror and senseless cruelty is Bosch. His embracement of pulp low culture as an artifact of excitement, of obvious fake thrills, in his case the centipedes the cowboys and assassin's and poisonings and beheadings and sci-fi Egyptian mystercism is pure pop art. Trash elevated by its representation here, found art, post modernism. He is the history of art, but especially, twentieth century art applied to literature.\n\nBut there is in this last book something more than what I am used to in Burroughs, something, I wouldn't say exactly a story. But a progression towards death, elevation beyond death. Sometimes the disperate fragments made sense to me as metaphors, often really good metaphors for steps along that quest, further examinations of angles to look at death and life.\n\nThe last chapter is magnificent, it starts with a section called 'The Valley'. People have lived for generations in a valley eating radiated corn. No one can escape the valley no-one knows how anyone descended into it in the first place maybe long ladders over the cliffs that have been torn down. Any attempts to fly over or burrow through the cliffs have been failures. Everyone is stuck in the valley, sick and hungry, unsure how they got there, dreaming of escape, to some unknown other place.\n\nIs that not for once a clear and obvious and quite brilliant metaphor?\n\n\"The future may not happen, if you strike at the right time and the right place. So we have a human lifetime with a few moments of meaning and purpose scattered here and there ... Need not be superb pieces of deadly tradecraft, can just be the nightsky over St Louis or anywhere... It is fleeting if you see something beautiful, don't cling to it; if you see something horrible don't shrink from it.... The glimpses are rare so how do we live through these dreary years of deadwood, lumbering our aging flesh from here to there?\"\n\nAnd another clear and beautiful and obvious metaphor.\n\n\"The earth is loosing light at that speed. 186,000 miles per second... You can make a certain amount of light from your own substance, if you have any left and light transfusions can be had for a price. Politicians is trying to convince the public they got a system for eating votes and shitting out light. But the light is running out and everyone knows it. It's leaving this planet at 186,000 miles a second and nothing can bring it back.\"\n\nIn this, his last book, Burroughs let's himself be understandable. And has more to say than his usual odd sparkling instructions about this or that. His deadpan crazy comments. His wild scenes stolen and exploded and inverted from the culture at large, elevating the trash that excites him. Or have I just missed all that in his other books? Have I just started to get what he has been trying to say? That he has been trying to say things all along?\n\nNovember 13, 2019\n\nThe third book in the sequence that began with Cities of the Red Night and The Place of Dead Roads descends into chaotic fragmentation, interspersed with the reflections of a stand-in for the author. Most memorable are the further elucidations of the exotic places alluded to in the previous works: Waghdas, the center for thought and philosophy but also a way station on the path to the Western Lands themselves, which could best be summarized as where one goes for their final test, their final death. The plagues that populate the first two books become increasingly grotesque—one of the most memorable sections concerns the nature of poisonous centipedes and the bodily deformity and toxic effects of different bites from centipedes of different sizes. Kim Carsons, the gunman from The Place of Dead Roads, is conflated with Nepherti, whose journeys through Waghdas and then the peripheries of the Western Lands themselves are held up by the narrator as a demonstration of how one must contend with this metaphorical derivation of death. Metaphorical only because the extremity of the collage technique (or ‘cut-up’ technique) in the book prevents to a much greater degree than in the first two books the concept of reading this as a chronological narrative or even (as with the first two) an asynchronous narrative.\n\nThe main character is the author himself, waning in spirit, realizing that everything within himself is nearing death, and that the creations he has made are not a font of ongoing strength. Every writer must eventually be silenced. And, hence, the descriptions of the environs the writer/narrator works in contrast deeply with the exotic philosophizing of the rest of the work; interestingly, the sex drive as a topic, so central to the virus-infected caricatures of The Cities of the Red Night, wanes in both the author’s own narrative and in the fragments of the invention. The intensity of the end of the book, in the passages of “The Wishing Machine,” is rooted in the dying of this fragmentary, visionary voice, inconsistent though it was: “The old writer lived in a converted boxcar in a junk heap on the river… It was Christmas night, getting dark. The writer had just walked a quarter mile to a truck stop that was serving hot turkey sandwiches with dressing and gravy to go. He was carrying his sandwich back when he heard a cat mewling.” Or, this passage, about the power of creation, and its end—the end of the libertarian dreams, flight to Tangier or Cairo: “Remember when I threw a blast of energy and all the light in the Earl’s Court area of London went out, all the way down to North End Road? There in my five-quid-a-week room in the Empress Hotel…”\n\nI think the greatest truth in this rumination is that Burroughs’s vision, and methods, collectively were so deeply interior—all interiors, the settings of the regular world deranged, not so much a critique of elements of the world as a creation of something parallel that in the end, too, would die with the end of the writing—not for the reader perhaps, but for the creator."
