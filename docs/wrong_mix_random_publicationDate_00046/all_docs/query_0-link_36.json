        "text": "Early on in an interview with the Paris Review, William Burroughs speaks about the process of writing Junky and his thoughts on the end results: \"I didn't feel compelled. I had nothing else to do. Writing gave me something to do every day. I don't feel the results were at all spectacular. Junky is not much of a book, actually. I knew very little about writing at that time.\"\n\nPersonally, I read plenty of compulsion in this vivid catalogue of withdrawal and fix, scores and sales. It's a head-first and fully immersed plunge into the junk underworld, the people in it, the techniques of obtaining and taking drugs, of dodging jail and turning doctors. But perhaps we can take Burroughs at face value. Possibly he was just writing to battle boredom. After all, if you believe his account, he started taking heroin for similar reasons: \"You become a narcotics addict because you do not have strong motivations in any other direction. Junk wins by default. I tried it as a matter of curiosity … \"\n\nWhere I would dare to argue with Burroughs is in the notion that Junky is not much of a book. A century after his birth, 60 years after first publication, it is more than holding its own. Its sharp, specific depictions of time, places and species of humanity seem more fascinating the more they recede into the rearview mirror. His prose has dated with the style and grace of the best film noir. There's period charm to his hard-boiled prose, clipped sentences and way with plosives (\"Junk is not a kick\"). But this writing still bites and scratches. To give a very literal example:\n\nThe cat screamed and clawed me, then started spraying piss all over my pants. I went on hitting the cat, my hands bloody from scratches. The animal twisted loose and ran into the closet where I could hear it groaning and whimpering with fright.\n\n\"Now I'll finish the bastard off,\" I said, picking up a heavy painted cane …\n\nIt's apparently dispassionate, superficially funny – but essentially horrific. Burroughs walks the tightrope over these emotional chasms throughout the book, and barely puts a foot wrong. In his 1977 introduction, Allen Ginsberg wrote in his inimitable style: \"It is a notable accomplishment; there is no sentimentality here, no attempt at self-exculpation but the most candid, no romanticisation of the circumstances, the dreariness, the horror, the mechanical beatness and evil of the junk life as lived.\"\n\nIt's good, in short. Although, of course, \"good\" is hardly an apposite word to use with reference to Junky. The book remains so interesting, and still repays serious reading after all these years, partly because it lays down such challenges to conventional ideas of good and bad. Aesthetically it throws the pieces in the air, suggesting all the compulsions of art and sex and pleasure are easily forgotten when you measure out your life in spoons and needles. Morally, meanwhile, it isn't for the faint-hearted. He has taken a position in the darkness beyond the conventional lines and limits. Cat torture isn't the half of it.\n\nWhen Junky was first published (as Junkie), it came packaged in caveats and obfuscations to blunt the sharpness of its attack. It was sold in a back-to-back edition (\"69'd,\" as Ginsberg neatly put it) with a book from a former narcotics agent, as if to rebalance the scales. It bore a subtitle implying moral turpitude: \"Confessions of an unredeemed drug addict\". It carried footnotes pointing out statements Burroughs made that weren't supported by \"scientific\" evidence. Its editor, Carl Solomons, also wrote a \"worried introduction\" (Ginsberg's phrase again) explaining: \"From its very first lines, Junkie strips down the addict without shame in all his nakedness … There has never been a criminal confession better calculated to discourage imitation by thrill-hungry teens … His own words tell us that he is a fugitive from the law; that he has been diagnosed as a schizophrenic, paranoid; that he is totally without moral values.\"\n\nWorried indeed. And misleading. Burroughs \"own words\" also tell us that he wasn't schizophrenic, even if that was how he was diagnosed. Nor is it all \"calculated\" to discourage imitation, as Burroughs himself explained in a letter to Allen Ginsberg:\n\nI don't mean it as justification or deterrent or anything but an accurate account of what I experienced while I was on the junk. You might say it was a travel book more than anything else. It starts where I first make contact with junk, and it ends where no more contact is possible.\n\nFinally, while the narrator of this book may take a very different moral position from most of us, that doesn't make it amoral. Even though Burroughs may admit to torturing his cat, that doesn't mean he approves of it. The fact that he describes it in such chilling detail might even be taken to show that he doesn't.\n\nThere's an even more upsetting scene in the book where Burroughs and a friend called Roy attempt to steal money from a sleeping \"mooch\". He wakes, fights back and so the narrator starts to hit him and when his friend tells him to \"kick his head off\", he kicks him in the side and hears his rib snap. Again, no judgement is made in the text beyond the fact that the horror of the beating makes his mouth go dry. But again, the fact that he deems the episode worthy of reporting is enough.\n\nIt's quite possible to see these scenes as, as Homer Simpson says, \"just a bunch of stuff that happened\". It's possible to see self-excoriation and a condemnation of Burroughs himself, or of heroin, or criminalisation. But the major force of the book suggests that the real ass is the law. Would the narrator have committed crimes without the difficulties of maintaining reliable supplies; without the stigma, isolation and pressure of the outlaw life? Junkies do terrible things out of desperation throughout the book. But the authorities do worse, almost for fun. Burroughs doesn't ask us to like addicts, but he does ask us to look at the world through their eyes and see it anew: \"Kick is seeing things from a special angle.\"\n\nYes, that includes understanding that people like Burroughs have a life lived in the gutter and on the fringes. But it also helps us realise that the drug laws don't work in the interests of the average punter. At most, it becomes an all-encompassing metaphor for society and the means of control. Heroin has the narrator in its grip – but he isn't the only one who's lost control of his destiny. The outraged law is a far more dangerous, far crazier master than heroin, with few of its compensations. Is it better to accept the shackles of the status quo, or at least to live, as the narrator intends, with \"momentary freedom from the claims of the aging, cautious, nagging, frightened flesh\"?"
