        "text": "Dangerous Visions and New Worlds\n\nAn Introduction\n\nThe long sixties, an era which began in the late 1950s and extended into the 1970s, has become shorthand for a period of trenchant social change, most explicitly demonstrated through a host of liberatory and resistance movements focused on class, racial, gender, sexual, and other inequalities. These were as much about cultural expression and social recognition as economic redistribution and formal politics. While the degree to which often youthful insurgents achieved their goals varied greatly, the global challenge they presented was a major shock to the status quo.\n\nScience fiction, with its basis in speculation, possibilities, and the future, became the ideal vessel for expression in an era in which the focus of many was on the questioning and refusal of established power and social relations, on the one hand, and the exhortation and exploration of radical scenarios, on the other. The genre intrinsically reflected upon both lived and alternative realities—past, present, and future. A New Wave of writers who captured the utopian and dystopian zeitgeist leapt to prominence in the 1960s, coming to largely dominate the field by the 1970s.\n\nResistance to change came from authors, fans, and editors, often dubbed the Old Guard, who were wedded to the conventions of the so-called Golden Age of science fiction. This was the period, generally recognized to stretch from 1938 to the late 1940s, when the genre first began to attract major public attention. Despite some important exceptions, key examples of which can be found in this book, the strictures and censorship of long-running science fiction magazines, such as well-known conservative John Campbell’s Astounding, dominated the field during the high sales period of the 1950s and continued on into the 1960s. A focus on scientific progressivism, prim sexual morality, and linear narratives resulted in tales focused upon technological breakthroughs and space-conquering male heroes.\n\nIn their place came a flood of new work that challenged and destabilized the conservative norms of narrative and expression, as well as outlook and belief. Chafing at the way in which past conventions continued to weigh upon the present, some authors sought to distance themselves altogether by defining their innovative work as speculative rather than science fiction. This shift in focus was as much aesthetic as political. Influenced by modernist prose and poetry, William S. Burroughs and the Beats, New Journalism, psychedelics, and the quest for consciousness expansion, modes of expression became more disjointed and experimental and topics shifted to the state of inner rather than outer space. The New Wave still had its astronauts and interstellar explorers, but now they could be found psychologically crumbling under the physical and mental pressure of space flight and the directives of the oppressive military bureaucratic apparatus behind it. Elsewhere, the brave heroes of the past gave way to a new range of characters: geno-cidal antiheroes, cynical or conflicted over their role in imperial power games and corporate domination; overworked (or underworked) drones strung out on psychotropic or other mind-altering substances; those left in a deep state of confusion by the all-encompassing spectacle of modern mass media culture or made paranoid by pervasive political and corporate surveillance; and individuals left in despair at the commodification and destruction of the natural world.\n\nGreybeard (Panther, 1968)\n\nThe Demolished Man (Signet, 1954)\n\nBug Jack Barron (Avon, 1973)\n\nWhat Entropy Means to Me (Signet, 1973)\n\nThe internal and external revolt expressed in the genre was in part facilitated by changes in the publishing industry. As we have detailed in our previous two works, Girl Gangs, Biker Boys, and Real Cool Cats: Pulp Fiction and Youth Culture, 1950 to 1980 and Sticking It to the Man: Revolution and Counterculture, 1950 to 1980, the postwar period saw the paperback displace the pulp magazine and, even with the increasing presence of television, novels were hugely popular. This allowed a growing number of authors to make it into print, including some of those previously excluded from mainstream publishing, such as people of color and LGBTIQ writers.\n\nIn terms of science fiction, Michael Moorcock’s rise to the editorship of the long running New Worlds magazine in 1964, the increasing popularity of genre novels, and the publication of groundbreaking anthologies such as Dangerous Visions and England Swings, all provided writers with new opportunities. Alongside the inclusion of radical commentary, experimental poetry, and other forms of expression previously foreign to SF magazines, New Worlds provided primarily British and American writers with the freedom to produce groundbreaking work. One of its admirers, the established yet highly controversial Harlan Ellison, subsequently helped to emphatically mark the New Wave’s arrival with the aforementioned hefty and influential 1967 anthology Dangerous Visions and to further underscore its importance with 1972’s Again, Dangerous Visions. Lauded by the critics and commercially successful, the two books included seventy-nine stories, five of which won major awards, and featured almost all of the key writers of the period, as well as detailed headnotes from Ellison regarding their work. The significant role that both Dangerous Visions and New Worlds played is acknowledged and honored by the title of the collection you are reading.\n\nThe rise of the New Wave was controversial. Because of the entrenched role of fandom and critique in SF, issues regarding form and substance were debated to a much larger degree than in other literary genres. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, these arguments raged in the pages of fanzines and magazines, in letters between authors and readers, and at conferences, forums, and social events. The split between Golden Age right-wingers and New Wave left-wingers was exemplified by the pro– and anti–Vietnam War advertisements, replete with lists of endorsees, taken out in the June 1968 edition of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine, a pivotal moment in the genre covered in this volume. While some experimental authors leaned to the right and some conventional ones to the left, for the most part, those whose work was skeptical, if not an outright rejection, of the political status quo were also more likely to question the nature of reality more broadly and engage in nonconformist prose.\n\nIn keeping with the New Left in general, few, if any, of the New Wave writers looked to the Soviet Union for answers, except where it emerged in the form of Eastern Bloc dissidence, such as in the work of writers like Stanislaw Lem and Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Although some Western revolutionaries turned to Maoist China, Guevarist Cuba, and new and/or refreshed variants of Trotskyism, state socialism appears to have had little appeal to the majority of science fiction authors who believed in a radical restructuring of society. Although some took part in public demonstrations and other overt organized political action, most opted to undertake activism and sedition via literary expression. In keeping with the antiauthoritarianism of the counterculture, visions for real-world reform and revolution were either relatively fuzzy or aligned most strongly with anarchism and radical forms of feminism.\n\nNot all of the writers covered in this collection believed that such widespread change was desirable or feasible. Some iconoclastic creative types, like Philip K. Dick, refused to align with any ideology or literary movement. Nevertheless, almost all were focused on shaking things up and testing the limits of morality and critical tolerance within and beyond the genre. The promise of science fiction, in its ability to transcend and travel beyond the limits of the present, was met not only by authors but also illustrators and designers. The influence of psychedelia, surrealism, and experimentation in general on book cover art during the period can arguably be seen most strongly in the science fiction field.\n\nA Dream of Wessex (Pan, 1978)\n\nMemoirs of a Spacewoman (Four Square, 1964)\n\nThe Female Man (Bantam, 1975)\n\nLiterature always reflects the values, experiences, hopes, and fantasies of its creators, as well as the society and groupings they are a part of. Within speculative and science fiction genres the boundaries expanded rapidly to include pansexuality, communal lifestyles, hallucinogens, and radical politics. Changing, indeed, often reversing, conceptions of heroes and evildoers, and a blurring, if not complete demolition of the binary between them, were a regular feature of stories regarding near and far-future revolution and utopian societies. Alongside this came a renewed focus on dystopia. Living under the shadow of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the escalating Cold War superpower nuclear standoff, which had come close to global conflict with the US/Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and ever more cognizant of ecological and other issues, writers such as Brian Aldiss, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, Kate Wilhelm, and John Brunner produced disturbing apocalyptic works that reflected upon existing threats and warned of far worse to come.\n\nFor some, the end of the world was less terrifying than the continuance of it. The anomie, ennui, and spectacle of technologically drenched modern life was harshly depicted in many 1960s and 1970s works by J.G. Ballard, Barry Malzberg, Norman Spinrad, Thomas M. Disch, and others. Such visions often reflected the end of various dreams of the long sixties, in terms of a better, more fulfilling world to come, be it via a dazzling array of new consumer goods or communal revolution. As the 1970s progressed, the postwar economic boom faltered, and achieving social change, where it had not been reversed or fought to a standstill, became an ever harder and less glamorous slog. The cynicism and weariness that this engendered, as well as the impact of events such as Watergate on those who clung to faith in democratic institutions, became ever more extant in science fiction.\n\nDespite setbacks and a growing backlash from the privileged, the 1970s remained a period of social challenge and change. Just as women’s liberation had pushed back against misogyny and the continuing second-class status of women within the New Left and counterculture, so it did within science fiction, with authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Joanna Russ, and Marge Piercy challenging the Old Guard and New Wave alike with their fiction and commentary. While science fiction emerging from and catering to the burgeoning feminist and gay and lesbian movements of the period often focused upon and channeled the inequities of the present into utopian and dystopian visions, writers such as Judith Merril and Alice Sheldon, writing under the moniker James Tiptree Jr., offered implicit critique through settings that involved a future in which liberation and equality were a long accepted and unremarkable fact.\n\n1984 (Signet, 1955)\n\nBrave New World (Chatto & Windus, 1932)\n\nMotherlines (Berkley, 1978)\n\nMore Than Human (Penguin, 1965)\n\nThe Primal Urge (Sphere, 1967)\n\nRacism and allied issues, such as anti-colonialism, structural poverty, and changing patterns of immigration—as well as declining imperial power, in the case of the UK, and imperial overreach, in the case of the US—were regularly explored by radical SF authors during the 1960s and 1970s. Relatively few works by people of color were published, however, until the 1980s. Beyond towering contributions from Octavia Butler and Samuel Delany, the impact of science fiction was arguably felt more among a select range of African American musicians, such as Sun Ra and Parliament/Funkadelic, rather than authors. Although a number of near-future insurrectionist novels from black authors, including Samuel Greenlee and the little-known Joseph Denis Jackson, were published, they were generally marketed as thrillers rather than sci-fi.\n\nNew Worlds and Dangerous Visions details, celebrates, and evaluates many aspects of this influential period of speculative fiction through twenty-four chapters written by contemporary authors and critics. New angles on key novels and authors are presented alongside excavations of topics, works, and writers who have been largely forgotten or undeservedly ignored. Interspersed between these chapters are short essays and cover spreads that serve to highlight the diversity of the field, as well as innovation in book cover illustration. With the exception of the Soviet Union’s Strugatsky brothers, whose work appears here to demonstrate how radicals were pushing the aesthetic and political limits in a very different context—and whose books were published to considerable acclaim in the West—the authors and books covered in this collection are primarily those published in the US and UK or by writers based in those two nations. This is partially for reasons of space, but also because these two countries’ milieus and book industries dominated the SF field in the period under review.\n\nAs with most movements proposing radical transformation, partisans of the New Wave sometimes portrayed the field as a decisive break with the literary and political conventions of the past. Such a focus on what was new tended to erase the work of those who had been advocating for change and practicing it in their work for some time. The legacy of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, H.G. Wells, and other writers, as well as pioneering utopian and dystopian writers in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, was in many ways carried forward in the 1960s and 1970s. Although such early work falls largely outside the purview of this collection, the influence and continuing role of progressive authors who had an impact during the conservative 1950s, including Judith Merril, John Christopher, Mordecai Roshwald, Leigh Brackett, and John Wyndham, is scrutinized and given its due.\n\nThe impact of New Wave science fiction has, in turn, extended long beyond its heyday of the 1960s and 1970s. Although an explicit and heavy focus on technology returned with cyberpunk in the 1980s, the literary, thematic, and stylistic challenges and innovations presented in the preceding period were largely absorbed and refined rather than removed and rejected. While broader society has significantly changed and moral attitudes shifted, many of the social issues addressed by New Wave authors either remain or have been intensified, giving this body of work a continuing relevance.\n\nIain McIntyre and Andrew Nette\n\nImagining New Worlds\n\nSci-Fi and the Vietnam War\n\nFor those interested in the relationship between politics and literature, the New Wave of science fiction from the 1960s provides a useful example of the intersection where the reshaping of a genre goes hand in hand with a radical politics. That makes the story worth retelling, as we ask what a new political literature might look like and how we might reconsider our own practice today.\n\nIn June 1968, the well-known American magazine Galaxy Science Fiction published two advertisements, each containing a long list of science fiction writers, illustrators, and editors. The first read: We the undersigned believe the United States must remain in Vietnam to fulfil its responsibilities to the people of that country. On the facing page, the second list began: We oppose the participation of the United States in the war in Vietnam.\n\nThe anti-war ad had been organized by the writers Judith Merril and Kate Wilhelm. Merril had been in the Trotskyist movement during World War II and was both politically and personally radical. A member of the Futurians, a predominantly left-wing science fiction group, she’d led a colorful personal life and believed in women’s right to sexual liberation and free love.\n\nStarship Troopers (Four Square, 1959)\n\nAs she and Wilhelm collected names, they were shocked—somewhat naively, perhaps, when other science fiction writers refused to sign. They had assumed that because the science fiction field was generally liberal and forward-thinking, there would be widespread support for their advertisement. In fact, they had misread the situation entirely.\n\nThe pro-war signatories were—with some exceptions—writers of an older generation, from science fiction’s self-proclaimed Golden Age of the late 1930s and 1940s, including John W. Campbell, the most influential editor of that time, and Robert Heinlein, an ex-leftist who had become a cold warrior for the right. Heinlein, who responded to Merril’s list with declarations of America first and US must win, expressed a far-right militarism in anti-communist novels like The Puppet Masters (1951) and Starship Troopers (1951). His Glory Road (1963) tells of a soldier who fights in Vietnam and brags about disemboweling a Marxist in the jungle.\n\nThe Puppet Masters (Doubleday, 1951)\n\nGlory Road (G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1963)\n\nOther Golden Age writers were more liberal. Nevertheless, their work shared many characteristics. In the typical Golden Age SF story, the protagonist—almost always white and male—faced a plot puzzle created by some science-fictional dilemma, to be solved by either intelligence and scientific knowledge (the more liberal Golden Age writers) or through action (Heinlein and others from the right). For Golden Age writers, science was to lead us in a glorious progress from the suburbs to the stars. The Golden Age authors could, thus, ask: What kind of worlds will we be engaging with? What sort of alien environments and inhabitants exist there? At the center of many of the Golden Age texts—such as in Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series—was empire.\n\nIn its elevation of science, its technological determinism, and its belief in progress, the Golden Age was thus an expression of the dominant postwar American liberalism, itself born from the moment when the US moved to center stage politically and economically. As the Marxist economist Ernest Mandel argued in Late Capitalism (1976), somewhat overstatedly, postwar ideology was accompanied by a generalised proclamation of the advantages of organization.… Belief in the omnipotence of technology is the specific form of bourgeois ideology in late capitalism.\n\nThe anti-war signatories were, on the other hand, mostly of a younger generation: part of the New Wave, a term first used by Merril in 1966. As a movement, the aim of the New Wave was, as one of its members, Thomas M. Disch, explained, to elevate SF to its true potential as the heir of Joyce and Kafka, Beckett and Genet. In doing so, it opened itself up to all kinds of radical content—New Left, feminist, countercultural.\n\nThe New Wave really began with the anarchist Michael Moorcock, who took over the English science fiction magazine New Worlds and edited it from Ladbroke Grove, a center of the London Underground. Under Moorcock, New Worlds was transformed into an ambitious vehicle for a literary avant-garde within the genre. Moorcock aimed to revolutionize both science fiction and literary fiction by destroying the boundaries between the two, a task that included challenging all previous taboos, traditions, and norms. His first editorial proclaimed that New Worlds would publish a kind of SF which is unconventional in every sense. The idea was, as he explained in a 1979 article in Foundation: A Review of Science Fiction, to attempt a cross-fertilisation of popular SF, science and the work of the literary and artistic avant-garde. Thus, New Worlds attacked the ‘literary establishment’ as well as social institutions and scientific orthodoxy. Later, Moorcock looked back on the project:\n\nDuring the sixties, in common with many other periodicals, New Worlds believed in revolution. Our emphasis was on fiction, the arts and sciences, because it was what we knew best. We attacked and were in turn attacked in the all-too-familiar rituals. Smiths [and Menzies, the book retailing company] refused to continue distributing the magazine unless we toned down our contents. We refused. We were, they said, obscene, blasphemous, nihilistic etc., etc. The Daily Express attacked us. A Tory asked a question about us in the House of Commons—why was public money (a small Arts Council grant) being spent on such filth. I recount all this not merely to establish what we were prepared to do to maintain our policies (we were eventually wiped out by Smiths and Menzies) but to point out that we were the only SF magazine to pursue what you might call a determinedly radical approach—and SF buffs were the first to attack us with genuine vehemence.\n\nPlaying the role of T.S. Eliot to Moorcock’s Ezra Pound, as Disch once put it, was J.G. Ballard, a soft-spoken Englishman who had grown up in Shanghai. As a child during World War II, he had been incarcerated in a Japanese civilian detention center, an experience that formed the basis of his semi-autobiographical novel The Empire of the Sun (1984). The destruction of imperial certainties was to have a profound impact on Ballard, almost as much as the quiet respectability of suburban Shepparton, where he eventually settled after the war. For Ballard, the old science fiction was exhausted. In a 1962 piece for New Worlds titled Which Way to Inner Space? he wrote:\n\nI think science fiction should turn its back on space, on interstellar travel, extraterrestrial life forms, galactic wars and the overlap of these ideas … similarly, I think, science fiction must jettison its present narrative forms and plots.\n\nHe proclaimed a boredom with traditional science fiction, preferring an examination of inner space to outer space and gestured to surrealism and the unconscious. As he stated, To attract a critical readership, science fiction needs to alter completely its present content and approach.\n\nBallard’s own work reversed or inverted the central narrative strategies of Golden Age science fiction, replacing rational, cerebral protagonists with troubled, isolated antiheroes. His futures were not the spacefaring adventures of Asimov or Heinlein but crumbling worlds that were representations of the contemporary psyche, expressed in exotic and efflorescent language.\n\nBallard’s rejection of the verities of science fiction set the foundations for the later works in the New Wave. Many American SF writers—Disch, Norman Spinrad, Harlan Ellison—began to send their most radical writing to Moorcock. Before long, the magazine had, in Ballard’s words, \"ceased to be an SF magazine at all, even within my elastic definition of the term, and became something much closer to avant-garde experimental writing. Ballard himself went on to write a series of brilliant experimental condensed novels—reflections on the media landscape, with titles like Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan and The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race.\" Among Ballard’s notable acts was the curation of a show of crashed motorcars for a London art gallery, a precursor to his novel Crash (1973).\n\nVery quickly, this experimentation brought all kinds of radical content into science fiction, into New Worlds in particular. Pamela Zoline’s famous 1967 story The Heat Death of the Universe interspersed details of the everyday life of a housewife with other fragments, including an explanation of the second law of thermodynamics (that all closed systems lose energy and thus the universe will one day die). It was a brilliant story, but for many of the Old Guard one question remained: Was it science fiction?\n\nDangerous Visions (Doubleday, 1967)\n\nAgain, Dangerous Visions (Signet, 1973)\n\nThe energy of the New Wave quickly spread to the US, with many of the US writers sending their most radical works to New Worlds. Merril lived for a year in England in 1967 and was so impressed that she edited the 1968 anthology England Swings SF. The American New Wave was probably most visible in the Orbit (1966) anthology edited by Damon Knight (Kate Wilhelm’s husband) and, in particular, in Ellison’s anthology Dangerous Visions (1967).\n\nEllison had marched with Martin Luther King and protested against the Vietnam War. His journalistic work, some of it printed in the countercultural LA Free Press, connected him with the New Journalism of the 1960s (Tom Wolfe, Norman Mailer, Hunter S. Thompson, and others), which, as cultural critic Morris Dickstein says, included a broad spectrum of underground writing—political, countercultural, feminist, pornographic. In his introduction to Dangerous Visions, Ellison argued, This book … was constructed along specific lines of revolution. It was intended to shake things up. It was conceived out of a need for new horizons, new forms, new styles, new challenges in the literature of our times.\n\nThe anthology contained many New Wave writers—Ellison himself, Brian Aldiss, Spinrad, Ballard, Philip K. Dick—while its sequel, Again, Dangerous Visions (1972), included Ursula K. Le Guin, whose The Word for World Is Forest was a consciously anti–Vietnam War story. Like Moorcock, Le Guin sympathized with the anarchist theorist Kropotkin. In one of the pieces in her 1989 collection The Language of the Night: Essays on Fantasy and Science Fiction, she rejected establishment science fiction:\n\nThe Einstein Intersection (Ace, 1967)\n\nThe Einstein Intersection (Sphere, 1970)\n\nCamp Concentration (Avon, 1972)\n\nCamp Concentration (Bantam, 1980)\n\nFrom a social point of view most SF has been incredibly regressive and unimaginative. All those Galactic Empires, taken straight from the British Empire of 1880. All those planets—with 80 trillion miles between them!—conceived of as warring nation-states, or as colonies to be exploited, or to be nudged by the benevolent Imperium of Earth towards self-development—the White Man’s burden all over again. The Rotary Club on Alpha Centauri, that’s the size of it.\n\nLe Guin, along with Joanna Russ and others, introduced feminism into science fiction, with books like the former’s The Left Hand of Darkness (1969) and the latter’s The Female Man (1975). Le Guin was also involved in the civil rights and anti–Vietnam War movements, while Russ, a lesbian, was more combative in her challenge of male dominance in the field. But the writer in Ellison’s anthology who most exemplified the radical impulse was probably Samuel R. Delany, whom Disch described as the American New Wave’s most brightly shining star. Delany’s earliest novels share much of the imagery and symbolism of Ballard’s disaster stories. Both writers depict decaying civilizations filled with empty cities and ruined technologies, but Delany concentrates on the cultural relativism of language and science, with an emphasis on the marginalized and on problems of identity. Delany himself is black and gay, and his story in Dangerous Visions, Aye, and Gomorrah, is often taken as a symbolic reworking of the gay experience.\n\nDelany’s views developed in the context of the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the early 1960s, the New York hippie district where countercultural radicals like Abbie Hoffman based themselves. Delany was one of science fiction’s prodigies (he published The Jewels of Aptor in 1962 at the age of nineteen), had taken LSD by 1965, and was present at the famous participatory art installation Eighteen Happenings in Six Parts by Allan Kaprow. Later in the 1960s, he was involved in the anti–Vietnam War movement, and, in 1967, he lived as part of an urban commune, an experience chronicled in Heavenly Breakfast (1979). His writing represented a confluence of all of these currents.\n\nIn 1968, when the anti–Vietnam War letter appeared in Galaxy, the American New Wave was reaching its peak. That year Delany’s Einstein Intersection (1967), a novel of extreme language play and experimentation, won the Hugo, while Disch’s 1968 book Camp Concentration, in which the chief character, a draft resister, is imprisoned and infected with a form of syphilis, announced its author as a major talent. Robert Silverberg—probably the most right-wing of the New Wave writers—quickly produced a series of meditations on alienation, transcendence, and political action, through which his stalled science fiction career was brilliantly relaunched. Philip K. Dick had already built a body of work, including essays praising the New Left and the counterculture, centering around philosophical questions of reality, authenticity, and what it means to be human.\n\nPattern Master (Doubleday, 1976)\n\nThe Word for World Is Forest (Berkley, 1976)\n\nMeanwhile, in London, Le Guin published her 1969 feminist novel The Left Hand of Darkness. In 1976, she published her award-winning novel The Word for World Is Forest (based on the novella of the same name included in Again, Dangerous Visions), in which the gentle inhabitants of a planet fight the evil Yumen invaders.\n\nWe can see here convergence between science fiction and, for want of a better term, history. As Ellison proclaimed a revolution in Dangerous Visions, activists and radicals were taking to the streets across the world. In 1968, the 1960s went global: the events of May and June rocked France, with a general strike paralyzing the country; demonstrators marched through swinging London; in Vietnam, the Tet offensive demonstrated that the United States and its allies could not win the war; riots shook Germany and 126 cities in the US; in Japan students clashed with police; the Prague Spring arose as a powerful reform movement in Czechoslovakia.\n\nRevolutions in form represent the emergence of new content. As a generation, the New Wave writers set out to revolutionize science fiction, driving their own concerns—civil rights, feminism, gay and lesbian rights, the New Left and political action, spirituality and transcendence, eastern mysticism and philosophy—through the genre’s fissures. To do so, they had to break apart the traditional narrative forms and structures.\n\nThe New Wave dissipated in the mid-1970s, along with much of the radical movement that it was a part of, though the story is less one of defeat than of integration (acceptance by the genre as a whole) and dispersal (the disappearance of the distinctive tone representing the particular correlation of forces from which the New Wave emerged). Nonetheless, as Spinrad explained in an interview:\n\nThe Forever War (Ballantine, 1976)\n\n[The New Wave] did change science fiction forever. Because prior to that there really were all kinds of restrictions: it was edited as if it were stuff for teenagers, or more accurately, what librarians thought teenagers should be able to read. So there were all kinds of political restrictions, and sexual restrictions and language restrictions, none of which exist today. In that sense it succeeded completely. After Dangerous Visions after Bug Jack Barron, Barefoot in the Head, stuff like that, you could do anything.\n\nJoe Haldeman’s 1974 novel The Forever War provides a remarkable example of what the New Wave achieved, because in many ways it constitutes a rewrite of Heinlein’s Cold War novel Starship Troopers. Both novelists had been in the armed forces (Heinlein during World War II; Haldeman in Vietnam, where he was seriously wounded); both novels employ essentially the same plot (the rise of the protagonist from lowly foot soldier to officer); both have the same science-fictional hardware and a similar hard-nosed literary style. That resemblance illustrates the shifting in ideological focus, best understood against the schism in US domestic politics that was to result in the so-called Vietnam Syndrome. As Alasdair Spark explains in an essay in Science Fiction, Social Conflict and War (1990):\n\nHeinlein applauded heroism, revelled in combat, and lauded the organization of society along military lines.… Haldeman’s soldiers are elite draftees, caught in an endless, futile war which strips them of humanity, alienates them from civilian society, and denies them status except in survival.\n\nThe anti-war advertisement in Galaxy was written to foster exactly the sort of shift expressed in Haldeman’s The Forever War. For Merril, however, the letter was not enough. She moved to Canada in the late 1960s, citing the US government’s suppression of antiwar activism as a reason. There, she founded Rochdale College, an experiment in cooperative living and student-run education, and was heavily involved in the peace movement. Others took different paths, though few of the New Wave writers entirely lost their radicalism. Decades after the letter, their example shines for those who feel that contemporary culture needs to be revolutionized, not just in form but in content.\n\nOf course, literary movements cannot be simply invoked out of thin air, any more than radical political movements can be conjured by pure will. The New Wave project was constructed in the context of the broad social radicalization in which its writers participated. It is easy for us to forget just how profound this was. The civil rights movement, black power, feminism, the New Left, gay rights, the counterculture—the 1960s fundamentally altered the modern world. Revolution seemed to be in the air—in both the East and the West—and to understand New Wave SF you must understand it as emerging from and engaging with this radicalization.\n\nLiterary and political movements are never entirely spontaneous. They never emerge purely unplanned, without someone initiating them. As Antonio Gramsci noted, a description of an action as spontaneous simply means that leaders cannot be identified. The story of the New Wave consists of conscious political interventions—Moorcock’s tenure at New Worlds, Merril and Wilhelm’s letter, Ellison’s Dangerous Visions—having significant cultural effects. At key points of that history, both science fiction and the broader culture were shaped by people who had both a literary agenda and a political one.\n\nFurthermore, most of the New Wave writers embarked on their projects before the widespread 1960s radicalization took place. In 1962, Ballard’s inversion of Golden Age SF opened up a way of writing science fiction with an entirely different worldview. Moorcock took over New Worlds in 1964. Ellison began writing about civil rights and the marginalized in the late 1950s, populating his fiction with outsiders, the working class, little people struggling, rather than heroes. Le Guin and Delany followed similar trajectories. They were, in other words, participants in the 1960s, not simply reflections of it.\n\nRjurik Davidson\n\nSextrapolation in New Wave Science Fiction\n\nIn her 1985 essay The Virginity of Astronauts, Vivian Sobchack argues that science fiction film has persistently refused to deal with human eroticism, exiling sexuality to the point that it manifests only as unconscious pathology. The classic icons of the genre—monsters and mutants, alien invasion and possession, technological mastery or impotence—emerge in her analysis as neurotic symptoms, materializations of the forces of repression that lurk beneath the antiseptic surfaces of the futuristic sets and the Ken-doll banality of the space jockey heroes.\n\nHer study is devoted largely to classic SF films of the 1950s, and one wonders how she might apply her psychoanalytic methods to the more risqué movies of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Barbarella (1968) and Flesh Gordon (1974). Perhaps she would view such films as an epochal return of the repressed, an explosion into conscious awareness of the hidden libidinal energies that have always animated the genre. Capitalizing on the freer climate for sexual expression within contemporary popular culture, such Space Age sex farces might be seen as traducing the chasteness and moral seriousness of traditional SF cinema, deriving much of their comic charge precisely from a counterpoint between the puritanical rectitude of 1950s era SF and the decadent excesses of the youth counterculture.\n\nIn a review of the comic book version of Barbarella in the March 1967 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Judith Merril playfully defended the valid modern phenomenon of the sexy single girl, as incarnated in the eponymous heroine, over the undersexed high-minded Boy Scout of the space patrol one might normally expect to find in similar SF stories. Yet she acknowledged that hers was likely a minority taste, at least among traditional fans, for whom Barbarella’s cheerful ribaldry might seem dreadfully unserious—or, as Merril winkingly implied, vaguely threatening to the adolescent males who make up SF’s core audience. In the same review, Merril also praised John Barth’s quasi-SF novel Giles Goat Boy (1966) for its sophisticated handling of sexual material. In essence, she deployed a highbrow postmodernist novel and a lowbrow pop culture comic, both of which deal with sex bawdily and unapologetically, to critique the middlebrow tameness and asexuality of most genre SF. It is time, she claimed, and long past time, for some of the same kind of hard-headed speculative thinking that science fiction contributed to space flight and atomics, to be done in [the areas of] interpersonal psychology and sexology."
