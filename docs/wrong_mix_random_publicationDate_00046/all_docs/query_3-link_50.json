        "text": "Berkeley, CA, USA;London, England, UK: Blue Wind Press; Tangerine Press, 1979;2022. First Edition; First Edition Thus. Softcovers. “In this trenchant science-fiction screenplay treatment, William S. Burroughs explores the coming apocalyptic medical-care crisis, and the birth of a tenacious and inventive underground holistic medicine. The author of Naked Lunch, Junky, The Third Mind, and Cities of the Red Night treats this topical story in ultimate terms, with the dry, sophisticated humor he has mastered like no other modern writer.” (back cover, 1979 edition) There are often times when one does research, that you come across a story or series of events that’s as perplexing as it is fascinating–that being said when it comes to the subject of this particular curation(s), one must ask themselves: What do the following have in common; “Blade Runner: A Movie”/”Blade Runner (A Movie)”, “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?”, and Ridley Scott’s 1982 sci-fi masterpiece “Bladerunner”. Aside from having cult followings that would blossom into wider acclaim, being made by auteurs in their respective mediums, and having killer titles, that’s about where the similarities end. As most film buffs, or sci-fi nerds (much like your curator) would know, Scott’s 1982 film “Bladerunner” was an adaptation of Philip K. Dick’s “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” both works being techno-noirs about identity, humanity, the nature of consciousness, and explorative odysseys in sci-fi aesthetics. However, between Dick’s novel and Scott’s film, Alan E. Nourse (1928–1992) released his novel “Blade Runner” in 1974. Nourse is a figure who, it seems, time has largely forgotten. Friend and mentor to the likes of Robert Heinlein, Nourse’s legacy stretches long over the genre of science-fiction. Nourse’s “Blade Runner” depicted a dark and dystopian future in which medical procedures are done in chthonic alleyways and dank basements to avoid sterilization, as a plague breaks out among the underclass (or Proletariat as Marx would put it.) Now that the fog of confusion has cleared (or perhaps gotten even denser) we can finally broach the topic of today's curation. In 1979, WSB was commissioned to write a treatment for a possible film adaptation of Nourse’s novel. This treatment was published as “Bladerunner: A Movie” and more or less followed a similar plot structure and shared the same themes, with slight differences being that the story as Burroughs presented it was set in 1999, and dealt with a right-wing government as the antagonist. Offered here today is a bundle of two editions of this volume: (1) First softcover edition, 1979. Shoaf, Section I, No. 49(b), pg. 48; Schottlaender, A41(A), pg. 15. With a cover illustration by Michael Patrick Cronan of a high-top shoe adorned with a red cross and splattered with blood. (2) First edition thus second printing, 2022. With original introduction as well as an updated introduction by our esteemed colleague Oliver Harris, scholar, writer, co-founder of EBSN (European Beat Studies Network) and overall authority on Burroughs. (1) in very fine condition with light smudging/staining to front and back covers, and minimal wear to fine edges. (2) in very fine condition with only the slightest wear to fine edges. Overall both volumes are substantially mint! Very Fine;Very Fine. [Item #6217]"
