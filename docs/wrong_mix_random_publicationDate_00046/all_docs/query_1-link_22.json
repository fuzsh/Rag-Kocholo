        "text": "Nick Mamatas Books In Order\n\nBook links take you to Amazon. As an Amazon Associate I earn money from qualifying purchases.\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nPublication Order of Short Stories/Novellas\n\nPublication Order of Collections\n\nPublication Order of Non-Fiction Books\n\nPublication Order of All You Need Is Kill: Official Graphic Novel Adaptation Books\n\nwith Hiroshi Sakurazaka\n\nPublication Order of PM's Outspoken Authors Books\n\nPublication Order of Whispers from the Abyss Books\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies\n\nNick Mamatas\n\nNick Mamatas was born on Long Island, New York on February 20, 1972, and went to the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Western Connecticut State University, and New School University. At Western Connecticut State University, he graduated from the MFA program in professional and creative writing, which he attended after he published many short stories, articles, and books.\n\nNick funded his writing career early on by writing non-fiction and by producing term papers for college students, which later got him some notoriety. This is after he described this experience in an essay he wrote for The Smart Set, Drexel University’s online magazine, called “The Term Paper Artist”.\n\nNick’s work has appeared places such as: In These Times, Razor, Village Voice, Clamor, Spex, and Polyphony. His work has also appeared in many Ben Bella Books and Disinformation anthologies, as well as books like Before & After: Stories from New York, Corpse Blossoms, Short and Sweet, and Poe’s Lighthouse.\n\nNick’s debut novel, called “Move Under Ground”, was released in the year 2004. His work is from the genres of mystery, fantasy, science fiction, and horror.\n\n“Move Under Ground” was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel in the year 2004 and is one of five Stoker Award nominations his work has gotten. Nick has been nominated for two Hugo Awards, a Shirley Jackson Award, and two World Fantasy Awards.\n\n“Move Under Ground” is the first stand alone novel and was released in the year 2004. The year is nineteen-sixty-something-or-other, and after interminable millennia of watery sleep, all the stars are right, finally. Old R’lyeh rises from the Pacific, ready to cast its damn shadow right over the primitive human world. The first to see these peaks is a paranoid, alcoholic, and frightened Jack Kerouac, who was drinking away a nervous breakdown in Big Sur.\n\nJack has to get back on the road in order to locate Neal Cassady, the holy fool whose ranting letters hint about a world that was brought to its knees in its worship to the Elder God Cthulhu. Jack and Neal, with pistol-totin junkie William S. Burroughs, make their way from one side of the continent to the other to confront the murderous Lovecraftian cult which spread its darkness to the core of the American Dream. Is Neal really along to help save the world, or is he looking to destroy it in order to have an ending for his book?\n\nNick is able to capture the often disjointed yet rhythmic way Kerouac wrote at the top of his game, and makes the Cthulhu apocalypse feel disorienting and wild. Readers found this to be really fun, clever, and a great homage to a pair of great writers.\n\n“Under My Roof” is the second stand alone novel and was released in the year 2007. Herbert Weinberg’s dad is striking a blow for freedom. He has declared independence from the United States, after he implanted a nuclear device inside of a garden gnome in the front yard of their home in Long Island. The household is quite understandably in an uproar because of it. Mother has gone, Herbert (twelve years old) is both a hostage as well as the Minister of Information, and the local weatherman’s moved in.\n\nOne daring raid removes the lad out of his ancestral home, but even as troops surround the belligerent house-state that has become Weinbergia, the sounds of freedom has just been sounded. The house quickly fills with American refuseniks. Will the fridge hold out? Is Herbert’s telepathic powers going to reunite him with his dad and defeat imperialism?\n\nThe book raises a rather interesting question about exactly what will happen when enough people don’t want to play the same game any longer. Nick delivers a book that is rather ambitious with some of the things he tries tackling in the novel. Readers enjoyed all the fast paced laughter, yet is not just a simple and easy read.\n\n“Bullettime” is a stand alone novel and was released in the year 2012. David Holbrook is a victim of bullies and a scrawny child, and the neglected son of two insane parents. He is the Kallis Episkipos, a brutal killer turned captive leader of a death cult that is dedicated to the Hellenic goddess of discord, Eris. David has never killed anybody, and lives a luckless and lonely existence in a tumbledown New Jersey town.\n\nCaught between trigger and finger, David gets three opportunities to choose his fate like he is compelled to live and relive every potential existence. The whole time, he is only guided by some dark wisdom he found in a cough syrup bottle.\n\nReaders found this twisted tale to be a gratifying non-linear experience because of how the sequences are scattered in some different places. The novel is both hilarious yet has quite a few disturbing parts, and leaves a strong impact on you. It pays a lot of attention to the little nuances of life and the tale and has truths that are looked over easily. All of these characters, are also magnificent.\n\n“Sabbath” is a stand alone novel and was released in the year 2019. Hexen Sabbath, the infamous eleventh century warrior, is pulled from death and certain damnation by some being claiming to be an angel of the Lord. He then finds himself dumped right into contemporary Manhattan without weapons, without clothes, and without resources, with a single mission to hunt down and murder the living personifications of the Seven Deadly Sins before they bring on Armageddon.\n\nWith time starting to run out and his one ally a destitute art gallery owner, Sabbath has to fight his way through New York’s elite. Then challenge the world’s most powerful guy, or suffer through an eternity is going to be his, as well as our, sole reward.\n\nReaders found this to be a very enjoyable novel, with some fantastic writing. There is some funny dialogue, a magnificent cast of characters, and is filled with tons of action. Hexen Sabbath is just a treat and readers had a lot of fun following him around as he did pretty much whatever he wanted."
