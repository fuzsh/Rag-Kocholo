        "text": "Transformations : the story of the science-fiction magazines from 1950 to 1970 by Mike Ashley\n\nCall Number: PS374.S35 A78 2005\n\nISBN: 9780853237693\n\n\"This is the second of three volumes [Librarian's note: now five] that chart the history of the science fiction magazine from the earliest days to the present. The first volume, Time Machines, traced the development of the science fiction magazine from its earliest days and the creation of the first specialist magazine, Amazing Stories. This book takes up the story to reveal a turbulent period that was to witness the extraordinary rise and fall and rise again of science. It charts the science fiction boom years in the wake of the nuclear age that was to see the ‘The Golden Age’ of Science Fiction, with the emergence of magazines such as Galaxy, Startling Stories, and Fantastic, as well as authors like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, and Frank Herbert. The book then goes on to explore the bust years of 1954–1960, followed by the renaissance in the 1960s led by the new wave of British authors such as Michael Moorcock and J. G. Ballard, and the rise in interest of fantasy fiction, encouraged by The Lord of the Rings and the Conan books of Robert E. Howard. It concludes with an examination of the newfound interest in science fiction magazines during the late 1960s and the incredibly influential roles Star Trek, the film 2001: A Space Odyssey and, above all, the first manned Moon landing played in transforming the science fiction magazine.\" - from the publisher\n\nDangerous Visions and New Worlds : radical science fiction, 1950 to 1985 by Andrew Nette (Editor); Iain McIntyre (Editor)\n\nCall Number: PN3433.5 .D36 2021\n\nISBN: 9781629639321\n\n\"In the period of major social change that spanned the 1950s through the 1970s, science fiction became an ideal vessel to illustrate a multifaceted upsurge of radical protest, with its focus on speculation, alternate worlds, and the future. Dangerous Visions and New Worlds details, celebrates, and evaluates how science fiction novels and authors depicted, interacted with, and were inspired by these cultural and political movements in America and Great Britain. It starts with progressive authors who rose to prominence in the conservative 1950s, challenging the era's narratives of technological breakthroughs and space-conquering male heroes, then moves through the 1960s, when authors shattered existing writing conventions and incorporated contemporary themes such as modern mass media culture, corporate control, state surveillance, the Vietnam War, and rising currents of counterculture, ecological awareness, feminism, sexual liberation, and Black Power. The 1970s, when the genre reflected the end of various dreams of the 'long Sixties,' is also explored along with the first half of the 1980s, which gave rise to new subgenres.\" -- Provided by publisher.\n\nGateways to Forever : the story of the science-fiction magazines from 1970 to 1980 by Mike Ashley\n\nCall Number: PS374.S35 A78 2007\n\nISBN: 9781846310034\n\n\"This third volume in a four-volume study of science fiction magazines focuses on the turbulent years of the 1970s, when the United States emerged from the Vietnam War into an economic crisis. It saw the end of the Apollo moon programme and the start of the ecology movement. This proved to be one of the most complicated periods for the science fiction magazines. Not only were they struggling to survive within the economic climate, they also had to cope with the death of the father of modern science fiction, John W. Campbell, Jr., while facing new and potentially threatening opposition. The market for science fiction diversified as never before, with the growth in new anthologies, the emergence of semi-professional magazines, the explosion of science fiction in college, the start of role-playing gaming magazines, underground and adult comics, and, with the success of Star Wars, media magazines. The book explores how the traditional science fiction magazines coped with this, from the death of Campbell to the start of the major popular science magazine Omni and the first dreams of the Internet.\" - from the publisher\n\nSolar Flares : science fiction in the 1970s by Andrew M. Butler\n\nCall Number: PN3433.8 .B885 2012\n\nISBN: 9781846318344\n\n\"Science fiction produced in the 1970s has long been undervalued. The New Wave was all but over and cyberpunk had yet to arrive. The decade polarised sci-fi; on the one hand it aspired to be a serious form, addressing issues such as race, Vietnam, feminism, ecology and sexuality; on the other hand it broke box office records with ‘Star Wars’, ‘Close Encounters of the Third Kind’, ‘Alien’, and ‘Superman: The Movie’. Across the political spectrum, writers perceived a series of invisible enemies: radicals addressed the ideological structures of racism, sexism, homophobia, colonialism, pollution, and capitalism and the possibility of new social structures, whereas conservatives feared the gains made by the civil rights movement, feminism, gay liberation, independence movements, ecology and Marxism and the perceived threats to the nuclear family. Sci-fi would never be the same again. This book examines the ways in which the genre confronted a new epoch and its own history, including the rise of fantasy, the sci-fi blockbuster, children's sci-fi, pseudoscience and postmodernism.\" - from the publisher\n\nDangerous Visions (3 volumes) by Harlan Ellison (Editor)\n\nCall Number: PS3555.L62 D35 1969\n\n\"Dangerous Visions is a science fiction short story anthology edited by American writer Harlan Ellison and illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon. It was published in 1967. A path-breaking collection, Dangerous Visions helped define the New Wave science fiction movement, particularly in its depiction of sex in science fiction. Writer/editor Al Sarrantonio writes how Dangerous Visions 'almost single-handedly [...] changed the way readers thought about science fiction.' Contributors to the volume included 20 authors who had won, or would win, a Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, or BSFA award, and 16 with multiple such awards. Ellison introduced the anthology both collectively and individually while authors provided afterwords to their own stories.\" - from Wikipedia\n\nAgain, Dangerous Visions (2 volumes) by Harlan Ellison\n\nCall Number: PS648.S3 A43 1972\n\n\"Again, Dangerous Visions (1972) is a science fiction short story anthology, edited by American author Harlan Ellison. It is the follow-up to Dangerous Visions (1967), also edited by Ellison. Cover art and interior illustrations are by Ed Emshwiller. Like its predecessor, Again, Dangerous Visions, and many of the collected stories, have received awards recognition. 'The Word for World is Forest', by Ursula K. Le Guin, won the 1973 Hugo for Best Novella. 'When It Changed', by Joanna Russ, won a 1972 Nebula Award for Best Short Story. Harlan Ellison was recognized with a special Hugo Award for anthologizing, his second special award, in 1972. Again, Dangerous Visions was released as a two-volume paperback edition by Signet in the United States, and by Pan in the United Kingdom. A sequel was planned, The Last Dangerous Visions, but was never published.\" - from Wikipedia\n\nEngland Swings SF : stories of speculative fiction by Judith Merril 1923-1997, (Compiler)\n\nCall Number: PN6071.S33 E55 1968\n\n\"One anthology project Merril began in the early 1960s under contract to Lion Books in Chicago was aborted, but inspired her publisher's editor Harlan Ellison to go forward with his own version of the project, which yielded Dangerous Visions (Doubleday, 1967). As an initiator of the New Wave movement, she edited the 1968 anthology England Swings SF, whose stories she collected while living in England for a year.\" - from Wikipedia\n\nLibrarian's note: In this anthology, esteemed SF anthologist and editor Judith Merril collected stories from British New Wave authors -- who (according to scholar Andrew Nette and Iain McIntyre) were instrumental in starting the New Wave movement with Michael Moorcock becoming editor of New Worlds in 1964.\n\nMemoirs of a Spacewoman by Naomi Mitchison; Isobel Murray (Introduction by)\n\nCall Number: PR6025.I86 M46 1977\n\nISBN: 9781849210355\n\n\"Naomi Mitchison, daughter of a distinguished scientist, sister of geneticist J B S Haldane, was always interested in the sciences, especially genetics. Her novels did not tend to demonstrate this, and she did not publish a Science Fiction novel until almost forty years into her fiction-writing career. Isobel Murray's Introduction here argues that it is by no means 'pure' Science Fiction: the success of the novel depends not only on the extraordinarily variety of life forms its heroine encounters and attempts to communicate with on different worlds: she is also a very credible human, or Terran, with recognisibly human emotions and a dramatic emotional life. This novel works effectively for readers who usually eschew the genre and prefer more traditional narratives. Explorers like Mary are an elite class who consider curiosity to be Terrans' supreme gift, and in the novel she more than once takes risks that may destroy her life. Her voice, as she records her adventures and experiments, is individual, attractive and memorable. Isobel Murray is Emeritus Professor of Modern Scottish Literature at the University of Aberdeen.\" - from the publisher\n\nThe Genocides by Thomas M. Disch\n\nCall Number: PS3554.I8 G4 1978\n\nISBN: 9780375705465\n\n\"This spectacular novel established Thomas M. Disch as a major new force in science fiction. First published in 1965, it was immediately labeled a masterpiece reminiscent of the works of J.G. Ballard and H.G. Wells. In this harrowing novel, the world's cities have been reduced to cinder and ash and alien plants have overtaken the earth. The plants, able to grow the size of maples in only a month and eventually reach six hundred feet, have commandeered the world's soil and are sucking even the Great Lakes dry. In northern Minnesota, Anderson, an aging farmer armed with a Bible in one hand and a gun in the other, desperately leads the reduced citizenry of a small town in a daily struggle for meager existence. Throw into this fray Jeremiah Orville, a marauding outsider bent on a bizarre and private revenge, and the fight to live becomes a daunting task.\" - from the publisher\n\nIce by Anna Kavan; Jonathan Lethem (Foreword by); Kate Zambreno (Afterword by)\n\nCall Number: PR6009.D63 I24 2017\n\nISBN: 9780143131991\n\n\"In a frozen, apocalyptic landscape, destruction abounds: great walls of ice overrun the world and secretive governments vie for control. Against this surreal, yet eerily familiar broken world, an unnamed narrator embarks on a hallucinatory quest for a strange and elusive \"glass-girl\" with silver hair. He crosses icy seas and frozen plains, searching ruined towns and ransacked rooms, all to free her from the grips of a tyrant known only as the warden and save her before the ice closes all around. A novel unlike any other, Ice is at once a dystopian adventure shattering the conventions of science fiction, a prescient warning of climate change and totalitarianism, a feminist exploration of violence and trauma, a Kafkaesque literary dreamscape, and a brilliant allegory for its author's struggles with addiction--all crystallized in prose as glittering as the piling snow. Acclaimed upon its publication as one of the best science fiction books of the year, Kavan's 1967 novel has built a reputation as an extraordinary and innovative work of literature, garnering acclaim from China Mieville, Patti Smith, J.G. Ballard, Anaïs Nin, and Doris Lessing, among others. With echoes of dystopian classics like Ursula Le Guin's The Lathe of Heaven, Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle, and J.G. Ballard's High Rise, Ice is a necessary and unforgettable addition to the canon of science fiction classics.\" - from the publisher\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick\n\nCall Number: PS3554.I3 A33 2017\n\nISBN: 9780345404473\n\n\"By 2021, the World War had killed millions, driving entire species into extinction and sending mankind off-planet. Those who remained coveted any living creature, and for people who couldn't afford one, companies built incredibly realistic simulacra: horses, birds, cats, sheep... They even built humans. Immigrants to Mars received androids so sophisticated it was impossible to tell them from true men or women. Fearful of the havoc these artificial humans could wreak, the government banned them from Earth. But when androids didn't want to be identified, they just blended in. Rick Deckard was an officially sanctioned bounty hunter whose job was to find rogue androids and retire them. But cornered, androids tended to fight back, with deadly results.\" - from the publisher\n\nStand on Zanzibar by John Brunner 1934-1995\n\nCall Number: PR6052.R8 S73\n\n\"The brilliant 1969 Hugo Award-winning novel from John Brunner, Stand on Zanzibar, now included with a foreword by Bruce Sterling. Norman Niblock House is a rising executive at General Technics, one of a few all-powerful corporations. His work is leading General Technics to the forefront of global domination, both in the marketplace and politically---it's about to take over a country in Africa. Donald Hogan is his roommate, a seemingly sheepish bookworm. But Hogan is a spy, and he's about to discover a breakthrough in genetic engineering that will change the world...and kill him. These two men's lives weave through one of science fiction's most praised novels. Written in a way that echoes John Dos Passos' U.S.A. Trilogy, Stand on Zanzibar is a cross-section of a world overpopulated by the billions. Where society is squeezed into hive-living madness by god-like mega computers, mass-marketed psychedelic drugs, and mundane uses of genetic engineering. Though written in 1968, it speaks of now, and is frighteningly prescient and intensely powerful.\" - from the publisher\n\nThe Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffrey\n\nCall Number: PS3563.A255 D73 1978\n\n\"Finally together in one volume, the first three books in the world's most beloved science fiction series, THE DRAGONRIDERS OF PERN, by Anne McCaffrey, one of the great science fiction writers of all time: DRAGONFLIGHT, DRAGONQUEST, THE WHITE DRAGON. Those who know these extraordinary tales will be able to re-visit with Lessa, F'lar, Ruth, Lord Jaxon, and all the others. And for those just discovering this magical place, there are incomparable tales of danger, deceit, and daring, just waiting to be explored.\" - from the publisher\n\nLibrarian's note: With the first book in this omnibus, Dragonflight, Anne McCaffrey became the first woman to win the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1968.\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula. K Le Guin; David Mitchell (Foreword by); Charlie Jane Anders (Afterword by)\n\nCall Number: PS3562.E42 L44 1969\n\nISBN: 9780441478125\n\n\"Ursula K. Le Guin’s groundbreaking work of science fiction—winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards. A lone human ambassador is sent to the icebound planet of Winter, a world without sexual prejudice, where the inhabitants’ gender is fluid. His goal is to facilitate Winter’s inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the strange, intriguing culture he encounters... Embracing the aspects of psychology, society, and human emotion on an alien world, The Left Hand of Darkness stands as a landmark achievement in the annals of intellectual science fiction.\"\n\nThe Silver Eggheads by Fritz Leiber 1910-1992\n\nCall Number: PS3523.E4583 S55 1969\n\n\"A HEADLONG RIOT OF HILARIOUS SCIENCE FICTION SATIRE -- MEET SOME INSUFFERABLY WONDERFUL CHARACTERS, from the mad, gay, heady world of the \"arts\" -- GASPARD DE LA NUIT—human journeyman writer. He has problems with his rampant lover, Heloise Ibsen (assigned to him by his pub­lisher). What he really loves is the giant computer-word-machine that produces his novels—read by other humans—which he oils with devoted care. His closest friend is ZANE GORT—a fine, upstanding, self-employed robot writer. Zane writes books for other robots and is madly in love with MISS BLUSHES—a censor-robix (female robot) of delicate pink. Miss Blushes is something of a prude and rather hysterical: very logical when you consider that her circuits are wired for censorship, but it makes life difficult for Zane. He turns for help to NURSE BISHOP—a small, but formidably beautiful human, who (in addition to the remarkable advice she offers Zane) plays nursemaid to a mysterious group of near-human entities owned by FLAXMAN AND CULLINGHAM—human publishers, whose language is frequently deplorable. To say nothing of the peculiar interest at least one of them has in a luscious platinum robut no, the daring reader must discover this for himself...

Published in the United States in 1971, it as a ten-year retrospective of Ellison's short stories. It was later published in the United Kingdom in two volumes as All the Sounds of Fear in 1973 and The Time of the Eye in 1974 (the 1974 volume only containing a new introduction). All of the stories in this collection center around isolation and alienation, and were selected from previous short story collections to fit this theme. The book was dedicated to, among others, four student protesters who were killed in the Kent State shootings of 1970. This dedication prompted a response from a reader calling the students 'hooligans' who were 'Communist-led radical revolutionaries and anarchists, and deserved to be shot'. This letter was reprinted in the introduction to Ellison's subsequent 1974 short story collection Approaching Oblivion. Ellison states that this letter frightened him and was one of the things that led him to change that collection from a call to action to a cry of frustration and disillusionment.\" - from Wikipedia\n\nLibrarian's note: Collects some of Ellison's most famous stories, including \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" and \"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman.\"\n\nThe Stepford Wives by Ira Levin\n\nCall Number: PS3523.E7993 S74 1998\n\nISBN: 9780747538028\n\n\"For Joanna, her husband, Walter, and their children, the move to beautiful Stepford seems almost too good to be true. It is. For behind the town's idyllic facade lies a terrible secret -- a secret so shattering that no one who encounters it will ever be the same. At once a masterpiece of psychological suspense and a savage commentary on a media-driven society that values the pursuit of youth and beauty at all costs, The Stepford Wives is a novel so frightening in its final implications that the title itself has earned a place in the American lexicon.\"\n\nRendezvous with Rama by Arthur C Clarke (Arthur Charles), 1917-2008\n\nCall Number: PR6005.L36 R4 1973\n\nWinner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards • “[Arthur] Clarke is quite splendid. . . . We experience that chilling touch of the alien, the not-quite-knowable, that distinguishes SF at its most technically imaginative.”—The New York Times\n\n\"At first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredible, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind's first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams . . . and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits—just behind a Raman airlock door.\" - from the publisher\n\nThe Forever War by Joe W Haldeman\n\nCall Number: PS3558.A353 F67 2003\n\nISBN: 9780060510862\n\n\"The monumental Hugo and Nebula award winning SF classic [...] The Earth's leaders have drawn a line in the interstellar sand--despite the fact that the fierce alien enemy they would oppose is inscrutable, unconquerable, and very far away. A reluctant conscript drafted into an elite Military unit, Private William Mandella has been propelled through space and time to fight in the distant thousand-year conflict; to perform his duties and do whatever it takes to survive the ordeal and return home. But \"home\" may be even more terrifying than battle, because, thanks to the time dilation caused by space travel, Mandella is aging months while the Earth he left behind is aging centuries...\" - from the publisher\n\nBeyond Apollo by Barry N Malzberg\n\nCall Number: PS3563.A434 B4 1974\n\nISBN: 9780571105106\n\n\"Two astronauts travel on the first manned expedition to the planet Venus. When the mission is mysteriously aborted and the ship returns to Earth, the Captain is missing and the First Officer, Harry M. Evans, can't explain what happened. Under psychiatric evaluation and interrogation, Evans provides conflicting accounts of the Captain's disappearance, incriminating both himself and lethal Venusian forces in the Captain's murder. As the explanations pyramid and the supervising psychiatrist's increasingly desperate efforts to get a straight story falter, Evans' condition and his inability to tell the \"truth\" present terrifying expressions of humanity's incompetence, the politics of space exploration, and the intricate dynamics of psycho-sexual relations . . . Originally published in 1972, BEYOND APOLLO incited controversy, polarizing critics and fans despite winning the first John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. Always disinclined to sell out or compromise his vision, Malzberg became disillusioned with the SF genre, which purported to be THE genre of innovation. Paradoxically, many SF editors and publishers worried about unsettling readers' comfort zones and insisted that authors write in accordance with a set of rules, formulas and codes. Malzberg would neither heel nor kneel; disillusioned, he unofficially retired from the genre in the late seventies and hasn't looked back. What he produced as a science fiction writer, however, remains among the best published during the twentieth century-important in its historical context, but also entertaining and thought-provoking in its own right. Dark, acerbic, funny and smart, BEYOND APOLLO may be Malzberg's greatest accomplishment.\" - from the publisher\n\nThe Dispossessed by Ursula. K Le Guin\n\nCall Number: PS3562.E42 D57 1994\n\nISBN: 9780061054884\n\n\"From the brilliant and award-winning author Ursula K. Le Guin comes a classic tale of two planets torn apart by conflict and mistrust — and the man who risks everything to reunite them. A bleak moon settled by utopian anarchists, Anarres has long been isolated from other worlds, including its mother planet, Urras—a civilization of warring nations, great poverty, and immense wealth. Now Shevek, a brilliant physicist, is determined to reunite the two planets, which have been divided by centuries of distrust. He will seek answers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have kept them apart. To visit Urras—to learn, to teach, to share—will require great sacrifice and risks, which Shevek willingly accepts. But the ambitious scientist's gift is soon seen as a threat, and in the profound conflict that ensues, he must reexamine his beliefs even as he ignites the fires of change.\"\n\nThe continuous Katherine Mortenhoe = The Unsleeping Eye by D G Compton (David Guy), 1930-\n\nCall Number: PR6053.O45 C6 1974\n\nISBN: 9780575018280\n\n\"Katherine Mortenhoe lives in a near future very similar to the present day. Only in her time, dying from anything but old age is unheard of; death has been cured. So when Katherine is diagnosed with a terminal brain disease brought on by an inability to process an ever increasing volume of sensory input, she immediately becomes a celebrity to the “pain-starved public.” But Katherine rejects her tragic role: She will not agree to be the star of a Human Destiny TV show, her last days will not be documented or broadcast. What she doesn’t realize is that from the moment of diagnosis she’s been watched, not only by television producers but by a new kind of program host, a man with a camera behind his unsleeping eyes. Like Margaret Atwood’s MaddAddam trilogy, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go, and the television series Black Mirror, The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe is a thrilling psychological drama that is as wise about human nature as it is about the nature of technology.\" - from the publisher\n\nThe Centauri Device by M. John Harrison; Copyright Paperback Collection (Library of Congress) Staff (Contribution by)\n\nCall Number: PR6058.A6942 C46 1974\n\n\"John Truck was to outward appearances just another lowlife spaceship captain. But he was also the last of the Centaurans, or at least half of him was, which meant that he was the only person who could operate the Centauri Device, a sentient bomb which might hold the key to settling a vicious space war. M. John Harrison's classic novel turns the conventions of space opera on their head, and is written with the precision and brilliance for which is famed.\"\n\nDhalgren by Samuel R.
