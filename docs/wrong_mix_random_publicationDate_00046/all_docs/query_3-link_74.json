This is achieved through the ability to withhold essential services including work, credit, housing, retirement benefits and medical care through computerisation...\"\n\n—Quietus\n\n\"[Blade Runner: A Movie is set in] a future where the only way to receive medical treatment is to be sterilized to stop any further progeny polluting the world. This draconian bargain leads to a blackmarket of doctors operating on patients who refuse to be sterilized.\"\n\n—Dangerous Minds\n\n\"[The title of the film 'Blade Runner'] brings along with it a weird backstory that tells us something about how the Burroughs virus spreads around, infecting nearly everything science fictional and countercultural over the past half-century or so. That’s William S. Burroughs, of course, author of — among a few other things — a 1979 novelistic film treatment called Blade Runner: A Movie.\"\n\n—Open Culture\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs was born on February 5, 1914, in St. Louis, Missouri, and became one of the founding figures of the Beat Movement. An addict for years, he crafted books like Junky and Naked Lunch, which were harrowing, often grotesque looks at drug culture. He is cited as a major influence on counter-cultural figures in the world of music as well and worked on several recording projects. In 2019, Tangerine Press published a new edition of Blade Runner: A Movie. Mr Burroughs died in Lawrence, Kansas in 1997.\n\nIain Sinclair has lived in Hackney since 1968, working at a variously titled London project. It has always felt, since the Dublin day when the contribution arrived from Burroughs in Tangier, that a certain undefined duty, towards that text, and the force of underground and independent publishing, had been laid upon him."
