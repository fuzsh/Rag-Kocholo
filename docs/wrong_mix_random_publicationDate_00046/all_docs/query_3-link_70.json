        "text": "Phillip Tourian is seventeen years old, half Turkish and half American. He has a choice of several names but prefers Tourian. His father goes under the name of Rogers. Curly black hair falls over his forehead, his skin is very pale, and he has green eyes. He was sitting down in the most comfortable chair with his leg over the arm before the others were all in the room.\n\nThis Phillip is the kind of boy literary fags write sonnets to, which start out, “O raven-haired Grecian lad …” He was wearing a pair of very dirty slacks and a khaki shirt with the sleeves rolled up showing hard muscular forearms.\n\nRamsay Allen is an impressive-looking gray-haired man of forty or so, tall and a little flabby. He looks like a down-at-the-heels actor, or someone who used to be somebody. Also he is a southerner and claims to be of a good family, like all southerners. He is a very intelligent guy but you wouldn’t know it to see him now. He is so stuck on Phillip he is hovering over him like a shy vulture, with a foolish sloppy grin on his face.\n\nAl is one of the best guys I know, and you couldn’t find better company. And Phillip is all right too. But when they get together something happens, and they form a combination which gets on everybody’s nerves.\n\nAgnes O’Rourke has an ugly Irish face and close-cropped black hair, and she always wears pants. She is straightforward, manly, and reliable. Mike Ryko is a nineteen-year-old, red-haired Finn, a sort of merchant seaman dressed in dirty khaki.\n\nWell, that’s all there were, the four of them, and Agnes held up a bottle.\n\n“Ah, Canadian Club,” I said. “Come right in and sit down,” which they all had anyway by this time, and I got out some cocktail glasses and everyone poured himself a straight shot. Agnes asked me for some water which I got for her.\n\nPhillip had some philosophical idea he had evidently been developing in the course of the evening and now I was going to hear about it. He said, “I’ve figured out a whole philosophy on the idea of waste as evil and creation as good. So long as you are creating something it is good. The only sin is waste of your potentialities.”\n\nThat sounded pretty silly to me so I said, “Well of course I’m just a befuddled bartender, but what about Lifebuoy soap ads, they’re creations all right.”\n\nAnd he said, “Yeah, but you see, that’s what you call wasteful creation. It’s all dichotomized. Then there’s creative waste, such as talking to you now.”\n\nSo I said, “Yeah, but where are your criteria to tell waste from creation? Anybody can say that what he’s doing is creation whereas what everybody else is doing is waste. The thing is so general, it don’t mean a thing.”\n\nWell, that seemed to hit him right between the eyes. I guess he hadn’t been getting much opposition. At any rate he dropped the philosophy and I was glad to see it go because such ideas belong in the “I don’t want to hear about it” department as far as I’m concerned.\n\nPhillip then asked me if I had any marijuana and I told him not much, but he insisted he wanted to smoke some, so I got it out of the desk drawer and we lit a cigarette and passed it around. It was very poor stuff and the one stick had no effect on anyone.\n\nRyko, who had been sitting on the couch all this time without saying anything, said, “I smoked six sticks in Port Arthur, Texas, and I don’t remember a thing about Port Arthur, Texas.”\n\nI said, “Marijuana is very hard to get now, and I don’t know where I’ll get any more after this is gone,” but Phillip grabbed up another cigarette and started smoking it. So I filled my glass with Canadian Club.\n\nRight then it struck me as strange, since these guys never have any money, where this Canadian Club came from, so I asked them.\n\nAl said, “Agnes lifted it out of a bar.”\n\nIt seems Al and Agnes were standing at the end of the bar in the Pied Piper having a beer when Agnes suddenly said to Al, “Pick up your change and follow me. I’ve got a bottle of Canadian Club under my coat.” Al followed her out, more scared than she was. He hadn’t even seen her take it.\n\nThis took place earlier in the evening and the fifth was now about half gone. I congratulated Agnes and she smiled complacently.\n\n“It was easy,” she said. “I’m going to do it again.”\n\nNot when you’re with me, I said to myself.\n\nThen there was a lull in the conversation and I was too sleepy to say anything. There was some talk I didn’t hear and then I looked up just in time to see Phillip bite a large piece of glass out of his cocktail glass and begin chewing it up, which made a noise you could hear across the room. Agnes and Ryko made faces like someone was scratching fingernails on a blackboard.\n\nPhillip chewed up the glass fine and washed it down with Agnes’s water. So then Al ate a piece too and I got him a glass of water to wash it down with. Agnes asked if I thought they would die, and I said no, there was no danger if you chewed it up fine, it was like eating a little sand. All this talk about people dying from ground glass was hooey.\n\nRight then I got an idea for a gag, and I said, “I am neglecting my duties as a host. Is anyone hungry? I have something very special I just got today.”\n\nAt this point Phillip and Al were picking stray pieces of glass out from between their teeth. Al had gone into the bathroom to look at his gums in the mirror, and they were bleeding.\n\n“Yes,” said Al from the bathroom.\n\nPhillip said he’d worked up an appetite on the glass.\n\nAl asked me if it was another package of food from my old lady and I said, “As a matter of fact, yes, something real good.”\n\nSo I went into the closet and fooled around for a while and came out with a lot of old razor blades on a plate with a jar of mustard.\n\nPhillip said, “You bastard, I’m really hungry,” and I felt pretty good about it and said, ‘some gag, hey?”\n\nRyko said, “I saw some guy eat razor blades in Chicago. Razor blades, glass, and light globes. He finally ate a porcelain plate.”\n\nBy this time everyone was drunk except Agnes and me. Al was sitting at Phillip’s feet looking up at him with a goofy expression on his face. I began to wish that everybody would go home.\n\nThen Phillip got up, swaying a little bit, and said, “Let’s go up on the roof.”\n\nAnd Al said, “All right,” jumping up like he never heard such a wonderful suggestion.\n\nI said, “No, don’t. You’ll wake up the landlady. There’s nothing up there anyway.”\n\nAl said, “To hell with you, Dennison,” sore that I should try to block an idea coming from Phillip.\n\nSo they lurched out the door and started up the stairs. The landlady and her family occupy the floor above me, and above them is the roof.\n\nI sat down and poured myself some more Canadian Club. Agnes didn’t want any more and said she was going home. Ryko was now dozing on the couch, so I poured the rest in my own glass, and Agnes got up to go.\n\nI could hear some sort of commotion on the roof and then I heard some glass break in the street. We walked over to the window and Agnes said, “They must have thrown a glass down on the street.”\n\nThis seemed logical to me, so I stuck my head out cautiously and there was a woman looking up and swearing. It was getting gray in the street.\n\n“You crazy bastards,” she was saying. “What you wanta do, kill somebody?”\n\nNow I am firm believer in the counterattack, so I said, ‘shut up. You’re waking everybody up. Beat it or I’ll call a cop,” and I shut off the lights as though I had gotten up out of bed and gone back again.\n\nAfter a few minutes she walked away still swearing, and I was swearing myself, only silently, as I remembered all the trouble those two had caused me in the past. I remembered how they had piled up my car in Newark and got me thrown out of a hotel in Washington when Phillip pissed out the window. And there was plenty more of the same. I mean Joe College stuff, about 1910 style. This happened whenever they were together. Alone, they were all right.\n\nI turned on the lights and Agnes left. Everything was quiet on the roof.\n\n“I hope they don’t get the idea to jump off,” I said, to myself, because Ryko was asleep. “Well they can roost up there all night if they want to. I’m going to bed.”\n\nI undressed and got into bed, leaving Ryko sleeping on the couch. It was about six o’clock."
