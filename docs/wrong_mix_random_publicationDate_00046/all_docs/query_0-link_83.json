        "text": "Which books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Courtship Rite, Donald Kingsbury (1982)\n\nFrom the inside flap: “Gaet, Hoemei and Joesai are three clone brothers, survivors of the rigorous and deadly process of nurture and weeding that produces people of high kalothi, people worthy of surviving on the inhospitable planet of Geta. Geta was settled many thousands of years ago by human starships, but only legends of the people’s origins remain, memories that have become myths.\n\nGeta is not a friendly place for humanity, but mankind, true to its immemorial instincts, has adapted. There is almost no metal, so technology remains primitive, but bioengineering has developed incredibly. The natural vegetation is poisonous to man, and the hot climate and recurring droughts lead to crop failure for the Earth grains that are the staff of life. In times of famine the people turn to the only other available crop: themselves. The religion and the social institutions are based on a belief that species survival is more important than the individual, and ritual cannibalism based on a form of directed natural selection dictates that the weak and less worthy must feed the strong so that life will continue.\n\nThe three brothers joined forces as children and have saved one another’s lives and become a powerful influence in their city-state of Clan Kaiel. Their union has been strengthened by joint marriage to two wives, Now and Teenae, but they seek to form a Six by courting Kathein, an important biologist. Prime Predictor Aesoe is also attracted to her, however, and instead orders the brothers to court and wet Oelita the Heretic. Oelita lives in a neighboring province, preaches against the accepted practices of human sacrifice, and works ceaselessly to find ways of making the practices unnecessary by developing native foods that will not poison the eater.\n\nJoesai, the warrior brother, is dispatched to commence the courting but peremptorily commences a mating ritual, the Courtship Rite, which consists of an increasingly difficult series of seven deadly trials. If Oelita survives all the trials, then the final result will be either marriage of the death of the brothers.\n\nThe story of courtship is worked out against the detailed creation of a world that will rival Frank Herbert’s Dune, Niven and Pournelle’s Mote world and the planet of Joan Vinge’s The Snow Queen. A vast alien landscape and a human culture based on our own yet evolved in strange and wondrous ways by the forces of an inimical nature provide a panoramic backdrop for the romantic adventures of a large cast of memorable and attractive characters.”\n\nInitial Thoughts: Donald Kingsbury (1929-) is not an author I’ve read. His first SF work appeared in Astounding in June 1952—and his next in 1978! Courtship Rite (1982) was nominated for the 1983 Hugo Award for Best Novel. From the blurb it sounds dense and vast. SF Encyclopedia praises the novel’s worldbuilding.\n\n2. Patterns, Pat Cadigan (1989)\n\nFrom the back cover: “‘Cardigan knows the difference between what’s real and what matters. Crank it up, and play it loud.” Michael Swanwick\n\n‘When you read Pat Cadigan’s stories, you’ll swear she’s been a 1) a psychopath, 2) a pimp, 3) a junkie, 4) to Mars, because she can write so well of places you don’t ever want to visit and people you nevereverever want to meet. She hasn’t been any of those things; what she is is another typical beautiful genius Supermom from K. C. whose works cause me to bite holes in my desk every time I read a new one.’ Howard Waldrop\n\n‘I can’t think of another writer who makes such exacting work look so easy. She is the master of the arched eyebrow, the hoarse whisper, the cut that takes a very long time to bleed.’ Lewis Shiner”\n\nContents: “Patterns” (1987), “Eenie, Meenie, Ipsateenie” (1983), “Vengeance Is Yours” (1983), “The Day the Martels Got the Cable” (1982), “Roadside Rescue” (1985), “Rock On” (1984), “Heal” (1988), “Another One Hits the Road” (1984), “My Brother’s Keeper” (1988), “Pretty Boy Crossover” (1986), “Two” (1988), “Angel” (1987), “It was the Heat” (1988), “The Powers and the Passion” (1989).\n\nInitial Thoughts: I’d previously read and enjoyed Cadigan’s “Rock On” (1984) for my media in SF series and thought I might as well track down more of her early short fiction.\n\n3. The Butterfly Kid, Chester Anderson (1969)\n\nFrom the back cover: “IT WAS NOTHING-SPECIAL GREENWICH VILLAGE DAY…\n\nAnd good ole Chester Anderson—sometime poet, rock’n’roll singer and self-proclaimed king of the Village—strolled along, content.\n\nContent, that is, until he saw a kind make butterflies.\n\nReal butterflies. The kind with pretty wings that flutter.\n\nWhat at first seemed amusing, if a little strange, quickly changed. Chester and his ragtag pack of singers, groupies and street-wise prophets had stumbled onto a mind-blowing phenomenon that threatened the whole world.\n\nAnd only Chester and his ragamuffin crew could save it.\n\nFrom what? The six-foot, blue lobsters from outer space.\n\nHow? With a horrifying plan that hinged on the innocence of… The Butterfly Kid.”\n\nInitial Thoughts: Chester Anderson (1932-1991) sounds like a fascinating individual. He was a beatinik, science fiction author, and founded “Communications Company (ComCo), the ‘publishing arm’ of the anarchist guerrilla street theater group The Diggers” (Wikipedia). The Butterfly Kid is the first in shared world trilogy of recursive SF novels: “The trilogy stars all three authors who become involved in the attempts of a pop group to fight off a more than merely psychedelic Alien invasion menace: Greenwich Village is being threatened by the distribution of a “Reality Pill” which actualizes people’s fantasies. Anderson’s contribution, with its jokey, slightly gonzo melancholy, was probably the most memorable of the three” (SF Encyclopedia).\n\n4. The Soft Machine, William S. Burroughs (1961)\n\n“The Interstellar War of the Sexes\n\nIn The Soft Machine, William S. Burroughs, author of Naked Lunch, turns the sexy, “scientifically” controlled mass-media society inside out. With biting use of the American vernacular, Burroughs makes a devastating attack on the power structure, violence and hypocrisy in contemporary society.”\n\nInitial Thoughts: I am eager to read William S. Burroughs’ The Soft Machine (1961) due to its experimental “cut-up” techniques that influenced authors in the SF New Wave movement.\n\nFor book reviews consult the INDEX\n\nFor cover art posts consult the INDEX"
