        "text": "Having looked at the Arbor collection of Great Sf Novellas, it occurred to me to start a discussion of classic collections.\n\nRules: There aren't any.\n\nI will post what seems to be of interest - to me.\n\nMy fond wish is that anyone taking the time to glance at the thread will do the same.\n\nDisagreements, additions, comments, reactions, statements of personal interest, will add to what I hope might be a conversation.\n\nWhen I did a miniscule bit of investigation I was overwhelmed by others comments, lists and actual research on historic publications. I have published a grand total of one academic paper on SF. This ain't really in depth research. collections\n\nSo. What I will post about is what seem to me to be classic, both single shot and some best of the year series.\n\nTo get things started,\n\nAdventures in Time and Space Hardcover – 1957. Healy & McComas\n\nRepublished by the Book of the Month Club, I found it in my living room when I was twelve. I struggled through it, opening new worlds. Since then I have learned that it was ground breaking, not only as a pub to the non SF world. but for the quality of the stories. Heinlein, Stuart, Campbell, Harry Bates, and a plethora of familiar and forgotten authors.\n\nThe Best Science Fiction Stories Bleiler & Dikty. 1949 through 1954. The title changed to include \"Novels\" in 55. for another three years. So essentially it was a nine year series.\n\nI was not familiar with this in my youth. Bumped into them while looking for Judith Merrill anthologies some years ago. Interesting as a precursor to later greats.\n\nMore later.\n\nThe Blieler/Dikty was, as far as I can determine, the first published series to cover individual years. Each volume contains a rundown of the SF year plus an index of everything published that year. If you are interested in what was in each volume, you will find links in the Wikipedia entry for T. E. Dikty. He and Blieler were enmeshed in the field. He was married to Julian May. Who, I discovered, was the first woman to chair a Worldcon (10th, 1952) way before she was known as an author.\n\nIt does not go back as far as another series, Before the Golden Age. ed by Isaac Asimov. The Asimov gives coverage of stories written in the 30s by stalwarts such as Edmond Hamilton, Clifford Simak, Jack Williamson and others. The first volume came out in 74'. A continuing series edited by the good doctor and Martin Greenberg Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories 1 (1939)(pub. in 79) starts a 25 book sequence that with it's overall coverage includes what is (I think) is the most impressive collection under one aegis. Book 1 starts with I Robot, which in his intro, Dr Asimov points out, is not by him, but by \"Eadndo Binder\" a pair of brothers well known in the field. A paragraph penned by one or both of the editors, gives a chatty introduction to each of the stories. Of particular note is that Marty Greenberg edited hundreds of collections, often with a name author, making him, I believe, one of the three great Sf anthologists.\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate the importance of the above mentioned Adventures In Time and Space. To recapitulate, not only its wide distribution, but the quality of the stories by authors such as Heinlein, Asimov, Kuttner, van Vogt, Campbell, it captured the imagination of fan and non fan alike. HERE is a Wikipedia link with a list of the stories.\n\nBefore Adventures, starting in 1947 with, The Best of Science Fiction, Groff Conklin published several large hardcovers, each including 40 or so stories. Best ---(1946), Treasury of Science Fiction (1948), The Big Book of Science Fiction (1950), Omnibus of Science Fiction (1952). Huge and substantial, they were published by Crown, for $2.95 (!!!) each. I own three of them, and it is notable that two of mine were reprints under different titles. As you would expect, the books contained stories by all of the then current authors, although Conklin was not above throwing in a (very) few classic stories by Poe and others.\n\nHERE is a fan article about all of the Conklin anthologies. To ignore the general comments, scroll down and you will find a complete list of all of his books' contents.\n\nAfter his huge compilations, Conklin published dozens of other collections, well into the 60s. One that I remember with affection was 50 Short Science Fiction Tales (1953) (with I. Asimov).\n\nBrowsing back through my copies I was struck by their stories' quality. There are stereotypes about scientists, women (who are mostly ignored) and frequent GEE, GOSH, WOW reactions by characters as action develops, but, perhaps due to my age, I found them fun and straightforward at a level not practiced by most of today's sophisticated authors.\n\nNext? Judith Merril.\n\nThe Year's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy (1956-1968).\n\nJudith Merril published her first Science Fiction story in 1948.\n\nMerril was highly thought of as an author, receiving plaudits from luminaries such as Groff Conklin, Tony Boucher, Francis McComas and others. For several years she was book editor for the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and edited a number of anthologies before her epochal series. But it is for her Best series that she is mostly remembered.\n\nLater she drew back from most participation in American publishing due to her move to Canada in opposition to the Vietnam war.\n\nMerril was a member of the Futurians along with Fred. Pohl (who she briefly married), Cyril Kornbluth, Damon Knight, Isaac Asimov, Donald Wollheim and a bunch of others. Not only did her cohorts become famous in the field, but within a decade of the group's founding, members thereof were editing more than half the SF mags being published.\n\nAt first a pb original, pub by Dell and then published in limited hardcover edition by Gnome Press & then in pb. by Dell, the series received huge praise from both inside the field and pubs. that included the NYT as the best Best out there.\n\nHERE is a link to vol. 1 (1955). And HERE is a general link to all of Merril's collections, with contents links.\n\nCopyright dates and vol. nos. distinguish different years albeit not clearly. The Internet Speculative Fiction Database will also give you slightly more difficult access to the stories in the collections.\n\nNotably volume's one's introduction is by Orson Welles.\n\nWhat I like about her series is that every SF author that you ever heard of from the period is represented. Also many, many that you have not.\n\nBut she does not stop there, Volumes have pieces by authors such as Howard Fast, William Burroughs, and Lawrence Durrell. Also a few cartoons by Jules Feiffer and one by WALT KELLY!!! (If you don't know him, look up my name.) Poems by Tuli Kupferberg. There are a few thought pieces about writing. Most volumes have summaries of the year in SF written by Merrill, a few by Anthony Boucher.\n\nBut the strong majority of the books are stories from SF periodicals. So if you want to know what was going on, find copies.\n\nAnd here is a list of stories anthologized by Merril, blatantly ripped off from a thread that I started elsewhere.\n\nThe Golem - Avram Davidson\n\nThe Hoofer - Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n\nOne Ordinary Day, with Peanuts - Shirley Jackson\n\nThe Country of the Kind - Damon Knight\n\nSilent Brother - Algis Budrys\n\nStranger Station - Damon Knight\n\nPrima Belladonna - J.

Aldiss\n\nThe Ship Who Sang - Anne McCaffrey\n\nA Planet Named Shayol - Cordwainer Smith\n\nSeven-Day Terror - R. A. Lafferty\n\nThe Face in the Photo - Jack Finney\n\nSuch Stuff - John Brunner\n\nThe Man Who Made Friends with Electricity - Fritz Leiber\n\nKings Who Die - Poul Anderson\n\nA Miracle of Rare Device - Ray Bradbury\n\nAll the Sounds of Fear - Harlan Ellison\n\nPuppet Show - Fredric Brown\n\nHome from the Shore - Gordon R.

G. Ballard\n\nThe Last Lonely Man - John Brunner\n\nSlow Tuesday Night - R. A. Lafferty\n\nEyes Do More Than See - Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Circular Ruins - Jorge Luis Borges\n\nThe Drowned Giant - J. G. Ballard\n\nTraveller's Rest - David I. Masson\n\nThe Cloud-Sculptors of Coral D - J. G. Ballard\n\nLight of Other Days - Bob Shaw\n\nWhen I Was Miss Dow - Sonya Dorman\n\nAn Ornament to His Profession - Charles L. Harness\n\nNarrow Valley - R. A. Lafferty\n\nThe Winter Flies - Fritz Leiber\n\nThe Star Pit - Samuel R. Delany\n\nIt includes some of my favorite stories ever. The collection was my introduction to Cordwainer Smith, William Tenn, Avram Davidson (or was that in F&sf? been a long time), with reintroductions to a host of other favorites.\n\nNext up?\n\nThere are many collections thematic, original (The Star series ed, by Fred, Pohl comes prominently to mind). Instead of going there (feel free to do so everyone.) I thought that I would mention another one of the many \"Bests\" series. This one started shortly before the last volume of Merril's and since the initiator was a friend or long term acquaintance, I suspect that was not a coincidence. I noticed this when I was pulling my Merrils off the shelf.\n\nDonald Wollheim was a seminal presence in Science Fiction. He was the moving presence in the founding of the Futurians and one of the first to establish a presence in mainstream book publishing, first at ACE and then by founding DAW books.\n\nQuoting from Wikipedia, \"\n\n\"Robert Silverberg said that Wollheim was \"one of the most significant figures in 20th century American science fiction publishing,\" adding, \"A plausible case could be made that he was the most significant figure—responsible in large measure for the development of the science fiction paperback, the science fiction anthology, and the whole post-Tolkien boom in fantasy fiction.\" - \"Wollheim also helped develop Marion Zimmer Bradley, Robert Silverberg, Avram Davidson, Fritz Leiber, Andre Norton, Thomas Burnett Swann, Jack Vance, and Roger Zelazny,\"\n\nHe convinced the owner of ACE to go into SF. For 20 years he oversaw their SF publication including the invention of the Ace doubles. I could go on about his hugely influential career, but the Wikipedia HEREdoes an excellent job. Relevant to this discussion, he started a 7 year best of series for ACE, co-edited by Terry Carr, with World's Best Science Fiction 1965. HERE is a link to the volumes and the stories.\n\nHe continued that series after leaving ACE to start his own publishing house, with 19 years of the Annual worlds Best SF (1972-1990)\n\nHere is a link to those volumes and their contents.\n\nIt is not easy to get chatty about the contents. I still pull one or another of the volumes off the shelf when the mood strikes, Unfortunately I usually read a familiar author, missing the many who are less familiar. But the wealth of stories is staggering.\n\nHardly any commentary about the state of SF in the volumes. I had to look at several to find any, Did not notice much that diverged from the standard magazines, with the addition of a few from men's skin mags that published a bit of SF.\n\nBut the stories!\n\nThe obvious anthology for the best or most recognized stories would be The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Vols 1, Two A, and Two B. Voted by the Science Fiction Writers of America, ed by Silverberg (Vol. 1) (short stories) and Ben Bova (vols 2A & B) (novellas) Although they are all time greats, a quick browse of the indices had all six of the stories written between 1940 and the 1960s parameters.The selection vote was for stories from before 1966, the start of the Nebula annual series.\n\nThe problem with the collections is that the stories are TOO well known (and you probably have the books anyway)\n\nHERE is the wikipedia for vol 1 with the stories. And HERE is the link for IIA & IIB.\n\nPersonally I have enjoyed collections specific to various magazines. When a grabbed a few from the shelf I realized that I hadn't looked at them in decades. So I have to admit that my recommendations are based on somewhat distant memories.\n\nUnknown Worlds: Tales from Beyond. ed by Stanley Schmidt and Martin Greenburg The stories are from the 1939- 1943s.\n\nNot surprisingly the list of authors looks like the same old same old. A lot of the stories will be familiar. Here's the LINK\n\nGalaxy: Thirty Years of Innovative Science Fiction. eds. Pohl, Greenberg & Olander. 7 of the stories are post 60s. Here's the LINK\n\nPrologue to Analog. ed. by Campbell. Stories from 1953-61. Glancing at the contents page I do remember it as being not quite as much fun as the others. But it has an intro by Campbell and is illustrative of that editors very influential style. LINK\n\nThe Best From Fantasy and Science Fiction. A Special 25th Anniversary Anthology. ed. by Ed Ferman. I am pushing it with this one, as two of the six stories are from the 70s. But it is a marvelous book. Each of the six stories is followed by an appreciation of the author's work and then by a bibliography.Judith Merril writes about Theodore Sturgeon and Fritz Leiber. William Nolan about Ray Bradbury.L. Sprague De Camp about Isaac Asimov. Gordon Dickson about Poul Anderson. Robert Lowndes about James Blish.\n\nThe bibs seem complete, through the 60s, each taking about five pages (except Asimov which includes non-fic. His takes eight)\n\nHere's the LINK\n\nThe Unknown Worlds is the only one that really gets into the 40s. For more you have to go to the Asimov Greats series mentioned at the start of the thread or Blieler/Dikty. or other collections. I own few, any more.\n\nSuggestions?\n\nI could list the stories from this F&Sf that are among my favorites ever, but - - -\n\nWhat's with but? I like and remember others. but my all star list includes from this issue - - -\n\nFondly Fahrenheit • (1954) • novelette by Alfred Bester\n\nAnd Now the News ... • (1956) • novelette by Theodore Sturgeon\n\nFlowers for Algernon • (1959) • novelette by Daniel Keyes\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz • [Saint Leibowitz] • (1955) • novelette by Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n\nThrough Time and Space with Ferdinand Feghoot (F&SF, October 1979)\n\nThe Women Men Don't See • (1973) • novelette by James Tiptree, Jr.\n\n\"All You Zombies ...\" • (1959) • short story by Robert A. Heinlein\n\nJeffty Is Five • (1977) • short story by Harlan Ellison\n\nThe Gnurrs Come from the Voodvork Out • [Schimmelhorn] • (1950) • short story by Reginald Bretnor\n\nArarat • [The People] • (1952) • novelette by Zenna Henderson\n\nWe Can Remember It for You Wholesale • (1966) • novelette by Philip K. Dick\n\nThe Quest for Saint Aquin • (1951) • novelette by Anthony Boucher\n\nAw hell. I like the others too. Read em all.\n\nI would have listed this compilation, but it somehow got dumped when I gave away 9/10ths of my collection. Thank you Mark.\n\nI have a hodgepodge of pb best of the year collections, In addition to the three series that I highlighted above,\n\nNumerous authors have taken a stab at pulling collections together. These include Lester del Rey, Terry Carr, Harry Harrison, Robert Silverberg, Frederick Pohl, Brian Aldiss, David Hartwell and Gardner Dozois. I am probably missing others due to to the unsystematic way that I bought them. Dozois went on from continuing a Lester del Rey series for ACE,. to his epochal 1984-2018 collections for St. Martins which won the Locus prize for best anthology approx. 20 times and was runner up another ten.\n\nEven without the Dozois, these comprise a truly intimidating set of stories. Not surprising since \"Best\" series have multiplied since Judith Merrill got out of the business in 68.\n\nIn an entirely unsystematic survey I arbitrarily picked a story from each of the volumes that I own (excepting the Dozois), not favoring familiar names, not avoiding them. (I start with which ever story is on page 100) Two or three were real clunkers. Another 22 were well worth the reading. I shouldn't be surprised as these were \"Bests\" collections, right? Still striking as tastes change.\n\nAn added fillup is the discussions by the editors. Read a bunch. More on that later.\n\nAny series that struck you over the years?\n\nOr collection?\n\nOr tendency?\n\nFred Pohl's Star six volume series (53-59) was probably the earliest.\n\nThere were of course many others. In addition to the above aforementioned Silverberg and Bulmer/Carnell series, Terry Carr did a 17 vol. Universe (1971-81) set., Harry Harrison did a four volume series, Nova (1970-74). I am sure that there were other short lived anthology series.\n\nDoing a minimal bit of research. it seems that the most impactful was Orbit. In his intro to the eighth annual Best Science Fiction of the Year, Gardner Dozois lists 19 highly respected authors who were either introduced in the series or who did \"Their best work\" there. Of course this was as of way back in 79' but it includes Kate Wilhem, Ursula Le Guin Johanna Russ, Tom Disch and a wealth of others.\n\nThe SFDB differs,, pointing out that Carr's Universe as the most impactful, it having won six Hugo or Nebulas for its authors over the period of it's existence.\n\nThe real point of this is, to me. that anthologies published once a year were responsible for as much expansion and quality in the field as the great bulk of contemporaneous SF mags.\n\nedit: I should have mentioned New Dimensions, (1971-) 10 volumes editer by Robert Silverberg (two more by Marta Randall) Again.\n\n, Chock full of great original stories and prize winners.\n\nPosting on this thread made me look at my shelf where, I picked up an old anthology,\n\ned by Damon Knight.\n\nThe stories are dated but original in their time. Enjoying the re-read. Perhaps it's Knight's taste, but I appreciate that humour seems more common in classics.\n\nHere are the stories:\n\nIntroduction (First Contact) • (1971) • essay by Damon Knight\n\nFirst Contact • (1945) • novelette by Murray Leinster\n\nDoomsday Deferred • (1949) • short story by Murray Leinster [as by Will F. Jenkins]\n\nThe Hurkle Is a Happy Beast • (1949) • short story by Theodore Sturgeon\n\nNot Final! • [Jovians • 1] • (1941) • short story by Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Blind Pilot • (1960) • short story by Nathalie Henneberg (trans. of Au pilote aveugle 1959) [as by Charles Henneberg]\n\nThe Silly Season • (1950) • short story by C. M. Kornbluth\n\nGoldfish Bowl • (1942) • novelette by Robert A. Heinlein [as by Anson MacDonald]\n\nIn Value Deceived • (1950) • short story by H. B. Fyfe\n\nThe Waveries • (1945) • short story by Fredric Brown\n\nIn the Abyss • (1896) • short story by H. G. Wells\n\nAbove, Hobbit mentioned a classic magazine anthology, I mentioned the impact that Adventures in Time & Space had on me.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of SF works edited by Greenbug, Knight, or Silverberg without even getting into the hundreds (thousands?) of other editors' anthologies and collections.\n\nAnyone want to mention ones that had impacts due to quality or when you read them?\n\nedit: In addition there are single author collections, tribute anthologies, thematic anthologies, the aforementioned annual best series (I gave up trying to track them down when I got up to 30 different ones. I listed what seemed to be the most important early ones above), anthologies from specific magazine sources, retro series of bests from specific past years, and, I am sure, other types.\n\nAgain, I wonder if other collections of sf moved you in the past.\n\nAs part of my ongoing reviews of New Worlds Magazine over at Galactic Journey (just reviewed March 1968) I've read all of these stories. I will be very surprised if readers like everything - I certainly didn't! - but that may be the point. They are very different to what was in the US magazines at the time, although Harlan Ellison's anthology Dangerous Visions is pretty close - and IMO not always successful - but they certainly make you think. More allegory, less spaceships. And these 2 anthologies are a pretty good summary of what was going on there at the time."
