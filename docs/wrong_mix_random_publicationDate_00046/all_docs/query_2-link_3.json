        "text": "It’s not exactly a secret that David Bowie was influenced by science fiction. From the very beginning, many of his songs were love letters to visionary authors from Arthur C. Clarke (2001: A Space Oddity… er, Odyssey) to George Orwell (1984’s “Big Brother”) to Robert Heinlein (“The Man Who Sold the World,” or “Moon,” as in Heinlein’s 1951 short story). The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1973) was a standalone work of science fiction masquerading as a collection of irresistible pop songs.\n\nBut Bowie was more than a fan. I’d argue he was a major figure in the science fiction movement of the 1960s and 70s known as New Wave, which he drew inspiration from and inspired in turn. New Wave attempted to rescue the genre from the clichés of bug eyed monsters and space wars by injecting social relevance, literary style, and lots and lots of sex and drugs. By the time Bowie burst on the scene with “Space Oddity” in 1969, most of the bedrock of the New Wave canon had already appeared in print, with highlights collected in the best-selling anthology Dangerous Visions (1967), edited by Harlan Ellison.\n\nMuch of Bowie’s work throughout his career is a dialogue with New Wave SF, refracting it through his own sensibility and bringing the concepts to a mass audience via the medium of rock and roll. As I’ve been listening to the Bowie catalog for the past day, I’m reminded of a few specific connections and patterns of inspiration.\n\nThe Jerry Cornelius Novels (Michael Moorcock). Moorcock, the quintessential New Wave author, is better known for his sword and sorcery character Elric, but in 1968, he unleashed the sexually ambiguous secret agent Jerry Cornelius on an unsuspecting public in a novel called The Final Programme. An acid-drenched mashup of James Bond and Doctor Who, the dapper Cornelius hopscotches around space and time foiling plots against reality, assuming new identities and dazzling people with his avant gard aesthetics as he goes. Three further novels followed, each stranger than the next. Jerry Cornelius is less a specific inspiration for Bowie’s work than a template for his entire persona.\n\nThe Ticket That Exploded, The Soft Machine and The Nova Mob (William S. Burroughs). The great godfather of the Beat Generation William S. Burroughs wrote several visionary – and barely intelligible – works of science fiction in the early 1960s, including these three that feature a cosmic cops-and-robbers story of Agent Lee and his attempts to stop the Nova Mob’s schemes to control the minds of humanity. When Bowie said he used the “cut-up technique” for doing the lyrics to some of his more surreal songs, he is speaking of the method invented by Burroughs and Bryon Gysin and used in these novels.\n\nValis, The Divine Invasion and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer. (Philip K. Dick). Philip K. Dick, best known today as the author of The Man in the High Castle and the stories that inspired Blade Runner and Total Recall, wrote this trilogy involving alien invasions, Gnostic Christianity and Nixon-age political paranoia in the mid-70s, when his years of drug use were taking their toll. They were not published until the early 1980s. In the novels, a character called Eric Lampton is based on Bowie, and another, Brent Mini, on his then-producer/collaborator Brian Eno, operating under the assumption that the events depicted in “The Man Who Fell to Earth” were real. According to Bowie’s son Duncan, the admiration between Dick and Bowie was mutual.\n\nDhalgren (Samuel R. Delaney, 1975). Delaney’s inscrutable novel takes place in Bellona, a mythic Midwestern city cut off from the rest of the world, where gangs of polysexual anarchists, poets and biker gangs have taken over. I find it impossible to listen to Bowie’s “Panic in Detroit” (released in 1973, around the time that Delaney was working on his novel) without thinking of this book. Something tells me The Kid, Dhalgren’s nameless protagonist, looked a lot like Che Guevara.\n\nCanopus in Argos (Doris Lessing, 1979-83). Though perhaps too late to be considered part of the main New Wave movement, this set of five novels by Nobel Prize winning author Doris Lessing stakes out some of the same turf as Dick’s Valis trilogy. Using science fiction themes as a metaphor to explore gender, war, sex, art and power dynamics, all five books – but especially The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five (1979) and The Sirian Experiments (1980) – echo the lyrical concerns of much of Bowie’s work from the same period, the otherworldly electronica of Low, Lodger and Scary Monsters.\n\nBowie's influence could be felt on more mainstream science fiction as well. His appearances in films of the 80s like Labyrinth and The Hunger, as well as ones he seems to have directly inspired, like 1982's Liquid Sky (about aliens stalking androgynous fashion models in downtown New York) and 1984's The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (featuring a rock-star superhero and his glam posse), use his established persona(s) as shorthand for \"cool hero/villain.\" The time-displaced 2005 BBC series Life on Mars (and its sequel Ashes to Ashes) bring together overtones of his science fiction-themed work and his cultural impact on the 1970s and 80s. And, my personal favorite, the hilarious animated sci-fi/adventure series The Venture Bros., which is full of Bowie references and even a couple of cameo appearances.\n\nAll of those are homages that reflect the influence Bowie enjoyed once his reputation was established. However it's worth noting that when it came to creating his own art during the phases of his career where he was really kicking down cultural boundaries, Bowie was not afraid to engage with some of the most dense and challenging imaginative fiction of his era."
