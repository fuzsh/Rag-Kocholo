        "text": "Rather unlikely about Cordwainer Smith (Dr. Paul Linebarger), but an interesting thought. As for the two \"purple\" references... \"Riders of the Purple Wage\" is actually a central piece in The Purple Book, and the \"purple\" here is an ironic reference to being \"born to the purple\"....\n\nNot necessarily featuring strange creatures, etc., but a fair amount of what emerged from the \"New Wave\" was connected to psychedelia, and could at times be quite... odd. (Also frequently very good.) Take, for instance, Brian Aldiss' Barefoot in the Head, dealing with events of \"the Acid Head War\"... certainly a stylistic tour-de-force where language is stretched to its limits on a variety of levels. J. G. Ballard's novels (and short stories, for the matter of that) often have a lot of surrealistic imagery and ideation: The Drowned World being the most \"normal\", perhaps, becoming increasingly surrealistic with The Drought, The Crystal World, several of the pieces in The Voices of Time. Vermilion Sands, etc.... And then there's always that extreme example, The Atrocity Exhibition....\n\nYou might also find several of the stories in Dangerous Visions, and Again. Dangerous Visions, of interest (in fact, DV was the original place of publication of Farmer's \"Riders of the Purple Wage\"), not to mention Judith Merrill's England Swings SF, and Langdon Jones' The New SF. (Speaking of Farmer... I would think Strange Relations would be precisely the sort of thing you're looking for... sf alien encounters as seen through the lenses of Freud and Jung.) Some of Moorcock's works might also appeal, such as the five-volume-plus (the \"plus\" being occasional short stories, such as the recent \"Sumptuous Dress\") Dancers at the End of Time sequence, or The Time Dweller, The Rituals of Infinity, The Black Corridor, The Shores of Death, and some of the tales in Moorcock's Book of Martyrs... also known as Dying for Tomorrow in American editions.\n\nI've been mentioning him a lot, but some of Ellison's works have always been viewed as being rather psychedelic, especially those written from ca. 1962-1980... ironic, as they come from a man who has an extreme antipathy to putting any such substance, including alcohol, into his system. (Ted Sturgeon's piece in I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream has something to say about this.) And even some of Sturgeon's work has its elements of the psychedelic, from \"The Golden Helix\" to \"The [Widget], the [Wadget], and Boff\"....\n\nIf the great mix-master in my head isn't going full blast it seems to me the last story in Jack Vance's THE DYING EARTH was s one of the most bizarre I remember reading. Don't remember the exact details but I could hardly believe what I was reading. Reality turning upside down in his short story \"The Men Return\" shouldn't fail to entertain the psychedelically inclined. And William Burroughs's THE NAKED LUNCH might spark you plug.\n\nYou mean DE collection or the Dying Earth omnibus that ends with Rhialto the Marvelous stories. The last story was the weirdest in the omnibus to me.\n\n\"Morreion\"\n\nRhialto and his associates journey to the edge of the Universe to seek their erstwhile colleague Morreion, sent away in the distant past to locate the source of the valuable, magic-anulling IOUN stones.\n\nJack Vance Treasury collection have: The Men Return, The Secret, The New Prime that fit in very well with this thread."
