        "text": "A personal reflection and update on my 5-year journey to design a new kind of scholarly life for the internet era. In a previous podcast, I shared how the Other Life company hit some hard times. Here I explain what I learned from that, and how I've turned it around. I share some meditations on the pursuit of weird goals, finding one's own path, and some new things I've come to learn about entrepreneurship. The ultimate meaning and purpose of the \"other life\" concept has really come home to me in the past few months.\n\nOther Life\n\nâ¦ Subscribe to the coolest newsletter in the world https://OtherLife.co\n\nIndieThinkers.org\n\nâ¦ If you're working on independent creative work, join the next cohort of https://IndieThinkers.org\n\n(00:00) - A Late Night Message\n\n(01:19) - On authenticity\n\n(04:12) - Creativity vs. Business\n\n(10:51) - The Creator Economy and Power\n\n(11:50) - Network Power\n\n(14:46) - The Fear of Failure\n\n(16:19) - What is the Other Life?\n\n(18:53) - On Truth\n\n(19:17) - The Future of Other Life\n\nI'm joined by author William Egginton to discuss his new book The Rigor of Angels.

We discuss Coltrane, intelligence, creativity, biography, academia, and specialization vs. generalism. At the end, we discuss writing and publishing, the changing landscape of the book publishing industry, and how to think about writing for different audiences.\n\nChapters:(0:00:00) - The Rigor of Angels(0:10:43) - The Antinomies of Knowledge(0:19:55) - Impact of Great Art and Thinkers(0:23:41) - Curiosity and Conviviality(0:30:31) - Creativity and Intelligence(0:43:28) - The Future of Writing and Publishing(0:49:27) - Academic vs. Popular Writing\n\nWilliam Egginton:â¦ Buy the Rigor of Angels: https://amzn.to/3Rj3fDVâ¦ William on Twitter: https://twitter.com/WilliamEgginton\n\nOther Lifeâ¦ Subscribe to the coolest free newsletter in the world. https://otherlife.coâ¦ Become a member. https://otherlife.co/upgrade\n\nIndieThinkers.orgâ¦ If you're an independent writer, join the next cohort of https://IndieThinkers.org\n\nWe dissect the complex life of Ezra Pound, one of the most interesting and controversial poetic geniuses of the 20th century. You'll gain insight into: Why Pound was so influential, his extraordinary talent-spotting skills, and his knack for turning vibrant social scenes into artistic movements. However, be prepared for a rollercoaster ride, as we also delve into the darker sides of Pound's life, including his descent into Fascism and anti-semitism. I believe the story is a cautionary tale about resentment, the modern passion par excellence, and a dangerous trap for people who rebel against institutions.\n\nThis podcast will help you understand Pound's poetic and cultural innovations, including Imagism and Vorticism, and how his strong opinions and unique perspective propelled him, despite his controversial and often off-putting personality. We'll recount his turbulent career during WWI and WWII, his friendship with W.B. Yeats, the launch of Blast Magazine, and much more.\n\nThis podcast is based on a close reading of Ezra Pound: The Solitary Volcano (1987) by John Tytell.\n\nChapters\n\n(0:00:00) - Intro(0:04:04) - Summary of Lessons From Ezra Pound's Life(0:17:22) - Dense Networks and Creative Success(0:26:26) - Imagism and Vorticism(0:37:05) - Wyndham Lewis and Blast Magazine(0:42:41) - A Restless and Controversial Personality(0:53:07) - Taste, Talent-Spotting, and Pound's Extreme Generosity(1:04:52) - Downward Spiral(1:18:29) - Ezra Pound's Reflections Late in Life(1:22:07) - Final LessonsOther Lifeâ¦ Subscribe to the coolest newsletter in the world. https://otherlife.coâ¦ Join the community and get the bi-annual print edition by becoming a member. https://otherlife.co/upgrade\n\nIndieThinkers.org\n\nâ¦ If you're working on independent intellectual work, join the next cohort of https://IndieThinkers.org\n\n(00:00) - Overview\n\n(04:04) - Summary of Lessons From Ezra Pound's Life\n\n(17:22) - Intense Friendships and Creative Success\n\n(26:26) - Imagism and Vorticism\n\n(37:05) - Wyndham Lewis, Blast Magazine\n\n(42:41) - A Restless and Controversial Personality\n\n(53:07) - Taste, Talent-Spotting, and Pound's Extreme Generosity\n\n(01:04:52) - Downward Spiral Into Fascism\n\n(01:18:29) - Ezra Pound's Reflections Late in Life\n\n(01:22:07) - Final Lessons\n\nA deep dive into the life of William S. Burroughs based on a close reading of Ted Morgan's 1988 biography, Literary Outlaw: The Life and Times of William S. Burroughs. Burroughs is one of the most independent creative spirits of the 20th century. My goal is to understand how he did it; how he remained so free but was also so influential and successful.\n\nI discuss his transformation from a heroin addict living off his parents' allowance to an internationally acclaimed writer, who was inducted into the Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1983. Hear about his unique brand of conservative anarchism, his significant influence on the counterculture of the '60s and '70s, his parenting, and the social-psychological correlates of his creative freedom.\n\nBurroughs was a blend of the Yankee inventor and the fire-and-brimstone Methodist preacher. We explore his grandfather's invention of the arithmometer and his uncle Ivy Lee's career as a public relations expert. These stories shed light on the roots of Burroughs' radical literary career, which combined a penchant for invention with a desire to go his own way and attack the respectable order of things.\n\nI also discuss Burroughs' late entry into writing and his experiences as a heroin user and a criminal, which taught him a lot about how the world works. I explore his failed attempt to build a commercial farm, his theory of 'factualism', which anticipates Nick Land and Deleuze, and much more.\n\nWhat did you think of this format, dedicated to a close reading of a great writer's biography? I'd love to hear from you.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 William S Burroughs' Unconventional Life06:30 Burroughs' Complex Heritage16:55 Burroughs' Late Blooming30:40 The Critical Importance of Small Private Friend Groups43:49 Lessons From Burroughs' Life50:25 What Wild Looks Like: An Anecdote59:08 Did Burroughs Murder his Wife?07:35 The Controversial Success of Burroughs' Novels15:27 More Lessons From the Life of BurroughsOther Lifeâ¦ Quit your passive media consumption and read great books every day. https://otherlife.coâ¦ Get the bi-annual print edition and other perks by becoming a dues-paying member. https://otherlife.co/upgrade\n\nIndieThinkers.org\n\nâ¦ If you're working on your own writing, join the next cohort of https://IndieThinkers.org\n\n(00:00) - - William S Burroughs' Unconventional Life\n\n(06:30) - - Burroughs' Complex Heritage\n\n(16:55) - - Burroughs' Late Blooming\n\n(30:40) - - The Critical Importance of Small Private Friend Groups\n\n(43:49) - - Lessons From Burroughs' Life\n\n(50:25) - - What Wild Looks Like: An Anecdote\n\n(59:08) - - Did Burroughs Murder his Wife?\n\n(07:35) - - The Controversial Success of Burroughs' Novels\n\n(15:27) - - More Lessons From the Life of Burroughs"
