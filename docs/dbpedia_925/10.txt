Revco Solutions is a fresh name in the collections industry, but a new brand with a long history of success for the industries we serve. We establish our history launching from a foundation of a century of experience performing collection services. With the acquisition of both Professional Recovery Consultants (PRC) and Credit Bureau Collection Services (CBCS) in 2019, under the ownership of Revco Management, these two organizations have integrated their considerable strengths to rebrand in 2020 as Revco Solutions, LLC. Our combined organizations receive multi-billion dollars in placements annually.
