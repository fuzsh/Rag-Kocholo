        "text": "DURHAM, N.C. -- Longshore Capital Partners (“Longshore”) and its portfolio company, Revco Solutions (“Revco”), are pleased to announce the acquisition of ARMC Financial Services (“ARMC”). Based in Oradell, NJ, ARMC is a healthcare revenue cycle management company that specializes in denials management, helping hospitals collect revenue that is improperly denied by insurance carriers. The acquisition of ARMC provides Revco with broader geographic coverage and an additional service to offer its healthcare clients. In conjunction with Revco’s early out self-pay AR management services as well as primary and secondary bad debt collections, the ability to now offer an insurance denial management solution positions Revco as a full-service healthcare revenue cycle management organization.\n\nRevco’s CEO, Geoff Miller, commented, “ARMC’s denials management expertise allows Revco to enter a highly attractive niche of the revenue cycle to better serve its existing clients who have a need for these capabilities. We are excited to welcome the ARMC team into the Revco family.”\n\nRyan Anthony, Partner at Longshore, added, “The acquisition of ARMC represents an important step toward achieving Revco’s strategic goal of broadening its service portfolio across the revenue cycle continuum.”\n\nARMC, located in Oradell, N.J. has been successfully recovering revenue for health systems, hospitals, and physician groups for over two decades. Their denials management solution enables healthcare providers to effectively increase revenue owed by insurance companies that would otherwise go uncollected as a result of improper denials.\n\n[article_ad] Jack Hoban, Chief Development Officer at ARMC, said, “We felt that our denial management expertise, processes, and systems were unique and first-rate. But to ensure our long-term viability and scale to a national presence, we needed to find the right strategic business partner. After an exhaustive search process, we are happy to become a subsidiary of Revco Solutions.”\n\nIf you have questions regarding this transaction or would like to discuss partnering with Revco Solutions, please contact Geoff Miller of Revco at geoff.miller@revcosolutions.com or (919) 971-2313.\n\nAbout Revco Solutions"
