        "text": "NEW YORK — Rite Aid Corp. said Wednesday that it has withdrawn its $1.8 billion tender offer for Revco D.S. Inc., after the Federal Trade Commission had announced it would block the deal on antitrust grounds.\n\nThe FTC claimed the merger of the two drugstore chains would dominate the drugstore business in Eastern and Midwestern states, and on Tuesday it said it planned to go ahead with a lawsuit to halt the purchase. The merged chain would have had 4,800 stores in 22 states, more than twice the number of its closest competitor. Rite Aid already planned to close 340 of its stores to avoid antitrust problems, but the FTC had asked that over 600 be closed or sold. Martin Grass, Rite Aid chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement: “It is apparent to us that the Federal Trade Commission has never been interested in reviewing the facts surrounding the intended merger with Revco in an impartial manner. Despite the facts presented that proved this transaction would be pro-consumer, the FTC kept changing the rules of the negotiation.”\n\nD. Dwayne Hoven president and ceo of Revco D.S., responded by saying that he respects the FTC’s decision. He added, “I believe, however, that the FTC’s ruling in this case does not preclude further consolidation in the retail drugstore business.” Rite Aid’s tender offer was scheduled to expire on Friday."
