        "text": "Longshore Capital Partners (“Longshore”) and its portfolio company, Revco Solutions (“Revco”), are pleased to announce the acquisition of ARMC Financial Services (“ARMC”). Based in Oradell, NJ, ARMC is a healthcare revenue cycle management company that specializes in denials management, helping hospitals collect revenue that is improperly denied by insurance carriers. The acquisition of ARMC provides Revco with broader geographic coverage and a complementary service to offer its healthcare clients.\n\nRevco’s CEO, Geoff Miller, commented, “ARMC’s denials management expertise allows Revco to enter a highly attractive niche of the revenue cycle to better serve its existing clients who have a need for these capabilities. We are excited to welcome the ARMC team into the Revco family.”\n\nRyan Anthony, Partner at Longshore, added, “The acquisition of ARMC represents an important step toward achieving Revco’s strategic goal of broadening its service portfolio across the revenue cycle continuum.”\n\nIf you have questions regarding this transaction or would like to discuss other business services-related opportunities, please contact Ryan Anthony or Nick Christopher of Longshore at (312) 237-3838."
