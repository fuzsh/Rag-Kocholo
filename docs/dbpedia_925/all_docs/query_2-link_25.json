        "text": "Revco D.S. Inc. said today that its board had accepted an investor group's sweetened offer of $38.50 a share in cash, or $1.29 billion, to buy the drug-store chain.\n\nThe investor group - which includes Sidney Dworkin, Revco's chairman and chief executive, and other Revco executives - initially proposed in March to acquire Revco in a leveraged buyout, paying $36 in cash and securities for each of Revco's 33.5 million common shares outstanding.\n\nBut the delay in completing the original proposal led to Wall Street speculation that some Revco directors might have viewed the initial offer as inadequate.\n\nIn addition, the price of Revco's stock had traded between $38 and $40 a share until recently pulling back, suggesting to some observers that the Revco bid might have to be raised.\n\nAfter the announcement, Revco's common stock closed up $1.125 a share, at $36.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThere was also Wall Street speculation that in view of recent takeover activity involving other retailers, the Revco investor group, known as the Anac Holding Corporation, was willing to raise its offer to head off a potential rival bid for the company.\n\nRevco operates more than 2,000 drugstores in nearly 30 states, with stores concentrated in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee and Arizona. The company also runs about 150 Odd Lot Trading stores that specialize in selling closed-out merchandise.\n\nIn its fiscal year ended May 31, Revco's net income climbed 46 percent from the previous year, to $56.9 million, while sales rose 15 percent, to $2.74 billion.\n\nThe new deal is still subject to the arranging of financing and approval of a majority of Revco's shareholders at a meeting to be held within 90 days."
