        "text": "The CVS Corporation said yesterday that it would acquire Revco D.S. Inc. for about $2.8 billion in stock, a combination that will create the nation's second-largest drugstore chain.\n\nThe agreement, which came after months of negotiations, will create a company with about 4,000 outlets -- more than any other chain -- and $13 billion in annual revenues, behind the Rite Aid Corporation.\n\nUnder a formula agreed to by the companies, Revco shareholders will exchange each of their shares for CVS stock that would have been worth $40.64, based on Thursday's closing price of $44 a share.\n\nWord that the two companies were close to a deal has helped push prices of both stocks up in the last few weeks. The companies confirmed on Jan. 27 a report in The Wall Street that they were in negotiations. Yesterday, the shares of both registered strong gains after the CVS announcement.\n\nOn the New York Stock Exchange, CVS closed at $47.125, up $3.125. Revco's stock closed at $41.375, up $3.375.\n\nThe combination, which received unanimous approval from both boards, is still subject to ratification by shareholders and Federal regulators.\n\nAs part of the transaction, CVS will also assume about $900 million in Revco debt.\n\n''I can't imagine why Revco shareholders would not approve this,'' said Mark Husson, an analyst with J. P. Morgan & Company. ''CVS is a terrific company that provides outstanding customer service in an industry that is not known for that.''\n\nMr. Husson and other analysts said they did not anticipate major objections to the transaction from the Federal Trade Commission. For the most part, Revco and CVS operate in different parts of the country.\n\nRevco, based in Twinsburg, Ohio, operates about 2,600 stores in 17 states in the Midwest and Southeast. CVS, which is based in Woonsocket, R.I., has just over 1,400 stores in 14 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia.\n\nAnalysts said the only states where the two companies had overlapping operations were Maryland and Virginia.\n\nF.T.C. concerns about market saturation were critical in Rite Aid's failed bid to acquire Revco last year.\n\nThomas V. Ryan, vice chairman and chief operating officer of CVS, expressed confidence yesterday that antitrust issues would not scuttle the deal.\n\n''This is a distinct deal from Rite Aid/Revco,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We operate in distinct markets, and we feel quite confident that working with Revco we can be proactive and assist the F.T.C.''\n\nTo that end, CVS said that once the deal was completed, there would be relocations or openings involving some 300 stores. Mr. Ryan said he expected the combination to generate annual savings of $100 million. Over time, Revco's headquarters, which has about 950 employees, will be phased out. But few if any additional layoffs are contemplated. The combined companies have about 80,000 employees.\n\nCVS said it expected the transaction to be completed in May or June.\n\nDonaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette acted as investment adviser to CVS. Revco was represented by Wasserstein Perella."
