        "text": "TWINSBURG, Ohio -- Revco D.S. Inc. and IC Industries, Inc. Monday completed the transaction in which Revco acquired the 42-store Carls Drug chain from IC Industries.\n\nThe purchase price was not disclosed.\n\nWith stores in upstate New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, Carls had operated as a division of Pneumo Corporation, an IC Industries company. The acquisition by Revco, which operates the nation's largest drug chain, increases Revco's store count to 1,945 units in 30 states.\n\n'The (Carls) stores will continue to operate under the Carls name as a separate division of Revco, retaining their format as a promotional drug chain,' said Sidney Dworkin, Revco chief executive officer.\n\nThe Carls chain had sales of over $83 million in 1984. Revco, which will announce results for the fiscal year ended June 1 later this month, has estimated that its sales for the year will be approximately $2.4 billion."
