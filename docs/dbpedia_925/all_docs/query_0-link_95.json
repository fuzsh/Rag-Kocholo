        "text": "Tuesday, January 28, 1997 Page:\n\nAROUND TOWN\n\nStore closings by the McCrory Corporation will mean big savings for\n\ncustomers as the retail chain discounts all merchandise in the 300 targeted\n\nstoresThe discounts will continue until all merchandise at those stores is\n\nsold.\n\nThe York-based retailer that has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nsince 1992 announced a restructuring last week. The retailer operates under\n\nthe names McCrory, McLellan, H.L. Green, Silvers Store, J.J. Newberry, G.C.\n\nMurphy, Coast to Coast, WM Tally House and Kress Store.\n\nBy Friday, sales will be in place at all 300 stores including:\n\nJ.J. Newberry Co., 28-34 N. Main St., Carbondale.\n\nJ.J. Newberry Co., 6-12 Independence St., Shamokin.\n\nJ.J. Newberry Co., 600 Main St., Stroudsburg.\n\nMcCrory Store, Sunbury Plaza, Sunbury.\n\nOther McCrory Corporation stores in the Back Mountain Shopping Center,\n\nMidway Shopping Center and Hazleton are not on the list of store closings.\n\nStaffing at Tobyhanna Army Depot will remain at the current levels, federal\n\nofficials announced Thursday.\n\nPreviously, federal officials considered laying off 274 of the depot’s\n\n2,462 employees, citing a decrease in the workload. But the U.S. Army\n\nIndustrial Operations Command has reviewed the work and the staffing level and\n\nconcluded that no change is needed.\n\nAdult Services Unlimited, trading as Riverside Rehabilitation Center, of\n\nPlains Township, and Health Poconos, of Mount Pocono, have been sold by Diane\n\nBartoli to Arbor Health Care Company of Lima, Ohio.\n\nBoth facilities provide general, job-related injury and geriatric\n\nrehabilitation. They also offer specialty programs in pulmonary\n\nrehabilitation, chronic pain management and arthritis rehabilitation.\n\nIn 1996, the combined facilities served more than 1,300 patients with more\n\nthan 12,000 visits. They had combined revenues of $2.8 million.\n\nFrank A. Pugliese Jr., formerly administrator of Riverside Rehabilitation,\n\nwas named chief executive officer of the Plains Township facility. James S.\n\nCrawford, vice president of outpatient rehabilitation, will manage both\n\nfacilities.\n\nArbor Health Care Co. provides subacute and complex medical services and\n\nbasic health care services for geriatric or chronically ill patients. The\n\ncompany operates 30 licensed nursing centers with 3,578 beds in five states\n\nand its Pharmacy Division serves 23,900 beds in Ohio and Florida.\n\nNATION\n\nRevco D.S. Inc. and CVS Corp. confirmed Monday that they were discussing a\n\npossible merger, giving Revco stock a short-lived boost before the uncertainty\n\nof the deal eroded most of the gains.\n\nThe joint statement said there was no certainty that the talks would lead\n\nto a deal and that the two companies wouldn’t comment again until either the\n\ntalks end or there is an agreement.\n\nNews of the talks in Monday’s editions of The Wall Street Journal pushed\n\nRevco’s stock up as much as 5 percent in the early minutes of trading. But\n\nRevco later traded down 37.5 cents at $38.87 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe combination would create the nation’s No. 2 drugstore chain in terms of\n\nsales behind Walgreen Co. and slightly ahead of Rite Aid Corp. Together, Revco\n\nand CVS have about 4,000 stores and revenue of $11 billion.\n\nAnalysts said the deal makes sense because Revco and CVS are among the last\n\nremaining major drug store chains not involved in a large merger. Such deals\n\nare a way for drug stores to compete with large supermarket pharmacies and\n\nmail-in prescription services.\n\nCompaq Computer Corp. remained the world’s leading seller of personal\n\ncomputers in 1996, a year in which the industry continued to grow but at a\n\nslower rate than previously expected.\n\nAnalysts blamed delay of consumer purchases in the United States and\n\nweakness in some overseas economies for the industry’s less-rapid pace.\n\nStill, worldwide PC shipments rose 17.8 percent in 1996, according to\n\nDataquest Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Meanwhile, International Data Corp. of\n\nFramingham, Mass., reported 16 percent growth.\n\nCompaq enjoyed the No. 1 spot for the third consecutive year, followed by\n\nIBM, Packard Bell-NEC, Apple and Hewlett-Packard, according to both IDC and\n\nDataquest. Hewlett-Packard experienced the fastest growth, seeing sales rise\n\n48 percent according to IDC and 51.8 percent according to Dataquest.\n\nOverall, the industry sold 68.4 million personal computers last year,\n\naccording to IDC. Dataquest’s figure was 70.9 million."
