        "text": "How To Negotiate a Debt Settlement With Revco Solutions in 3 Steps\n\nIf youâre successful in negotiating a debt settlement â yes, this does actually happen â you may only have to pay 40% to 60% of the original amount of your debt.Â\n\nNegotiation is possible because third-party debt collectors like Revco Solutions get paid by taking a percentage of any money they can collect from you on behalf of their client. In other words, theyâre often motivated to settle your account even if itâs not for the full amount. The sooner they settle your debt, the sooner they get paid.\n\nSometimes a debt collector will offer to settle the debt for less in the first letter they send, but donât be afraid to start the negotiation process yourself. Itâs not too difficult once you know how it works.\n\nStep 1: Make Sure the Debt Is Valid\n\nBefore entering negotiations, first confirm the debt is valid. You have the right to do this because of a debt collection rule under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). It states that third-party debt collectors like Revco Solutions must send you a validation letter and give you 30 days to dispute the debt.\n\nIf Revco Solutions sent you a debt validation letter, look it over and confirm all the information is correct. If they never sent you a debt validation letter or if you want to dispute the information in their letter, you can send them a debt verification letter.\n\nItâs important to validate the details of the debt because debt collectors sometimes get information wrong. They may try to collect the wrong amount from you or try to collect a debt thatâs not yours. You also want to ensure that Revco Solutions owns the debt or can legally collect the debt on behalf of its client. If youâve done all this and you agree that you owe the debt, you can move on to the next step.\n\nStep 2: Figure Out What You Can Pay\n\nIf youâve validated the debt and want to negotiate the amount down, youâll first need to figure out what you can afford to pay. Do this by calculating how much money you have left over each month after you pay your bills, taxes, and other expenses. If you need help, check out the CFPBâs monthly budget worksheet and debt worksheet. You can also look into getting a free consultation with an accredited nonprofit credit counselor who can help you with your personal budget and debt management.Â\n\nWhen it comes to your settlement offer, you have two options: pay a lump sum or offer a payment plan. Debt collectors prefer to settle debts with a lump sum. Itâs less time-consuming and quicker for them. Perhaps thereâs an upcoming tax refund or holiday bonus you can use to pay the lump sum. Or you might have some personal property you can sell.\n\nIf you canât afford a lump-sum payment, youâll have to get clear on what monthly payment you realistically can afford and time period you feel comfortable with. Think of what else you can do to sweeten the pot: Revco Solutions may be more willing to approve a payment plan if you agree to set up an automatic direct withdrawal from your bank account.Â\n\nStep 3: Make a Settlement Offer to Revco Solutions\n\nAs with any other negotiation, you should start with a number thatâs lower than what you can afford. You can go as low as 25% of the original debt. If Revco Solutions accepts your offer, great! If not, donât worry â some back and forth is normal. The final number you agree on will likely be more than what you initially offered but still a more manageable amount than the full debt.\n\nWhatever agreement you reach with Revco Solutions should be in writing. If you arenât sure where to start, check out Upsolveâs article Writing a Debt Settlement Offer Letterthat includes a template to get you started.\n\nDonât Just Negotiate the Amountâ¦ Negotiate Everything!\n\nThe most important part of the negotiation process is the amount you pay, but there are other things you can negotiate, too. For example, you can ask them to report your account as âpaid in fullâ to the major credit reporting bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, or Equifax). Reporting the account as âpaid in fullâ rather than âpartial paymentâ or âsettledâ will be the best outcome for your credit score.\n\nAnother negotiating point is how much time you have to pay. If Revco isnât willing to accept a lower amount, they might be open to providing more time to submit your lump-sum payment or a few more months to make monthly payments.\n\nHow To Beat Revco Solutions in a Debt Lawsuit\n\nIf you get sued by Revco Solutions, youâll need to respond to the court documents you receive notifying you of the lawsuit. In most cases, these documents will consist of a summons and complaint. Revco Solutions will probably send these documents in the mail or have someone deliver them to you in person.Â\n\nIf you donât respond to the complaint, the judge will assume you donât want to defend yourself, and the debt collector will probably win the case. Then, the judge can issue a court order that allows Revco to garnish your paycheck or bank account. Keep in mind that even if thereâs a case pending against you, you can still negotiate an agreement to settle the debt.\n\nIf you're worried about responding on your own, but you can't afford a lawyer, you can draft a answer letter for free or a small fee using our partner SoloSuit.

Letâs take a look at the basic steps for responding to the complaint.\n\nStep 1: Read the Summons and Complaint Carefully\n\nA summons is a court document that tells you youâre being sued. The exact information contained in the summons varies by court, but most have basic information about the case, including:\n\nThe court name and address\n\nThe name and contact information of the plaintiff (person suing you) and the defendant (the person being sued; you)\n\nA case or docket number and date the court issued the summons\n\nThe signature and seal of the court\n\nThe type or nature of the lawsuit\n\nInstructions for the defendant to respond to the lawsuit\n\nA deadline or amount of time to respond to the lawsuit and consequences if this deadline is missed or ignored\n\nÂ\n\nThe complaint document explains why youâre being sued. Complaints are typically arranged in numbered paragraphs. Each paragraph states a specific fact or claim against you.\n\nStep 2: Fill Out an Answer Form (and Any Other Required Forms)\n\nAn answer form is your formal response to the plaintiffâs complaint. Many (but not all) courts will have a blank answer form that you can fill out to respond to the complaint. To see if your court has one, do an online search by entering in the court name on the summons and âcourt formsâ or âanswer form.â\n\nÂ\n\nIf you find an answer form, itâll normally come with some basic instructions. If you need clarification or have a question, the court clerk or employee can usually help. Just remember that while they canât give you legal advice or tell you what facts or legal arguments to put on the answer, they can explain where to write them on the form.\n\nÂ\n\nIf the answer form asks you to list your affirmative defenses, itâs important to do so. The court might not be willing to hear them later if the case progresses. You can learn more about defenses in Upsolveâ Article 3 Steps To Take if a Debt Collector Sues You.\n\nÂ\n\nYou may also be required to complete other forms.These include things like a certificate of service or verification. Sometimes these will be part of the answer template the court provides. You can ask the court clerk or check the courtâs website to see if you need to submit other forms alongside your answer form.\n\nStep 3: File the Answer Form With the Court and Serve on the Plaintiff\n\nAfter completing the forms, itâs time to file them with the court and serve copies to the plaintiff (the person suing you). The exact process to file your documents will depend on the court, but you can almost always do so in person at the courthouse. Many courts will also accept filings using other methods, such as e-filing or by mail. Youâll have to check with the court to confirm which methods they accept. This information may also be on the summons.\n\nÂ\n\nThe process to serve (officially deliver documents to) the plaintiff also varies by court. You may be able to physically hand a copy of the documents to the plaintiff. This is called personal service.Â\n\nSince this isnât very convenient for most people, you can usually serve the plaintiff by mail instead. Note that some courts have specific rules for how to do this. For example, you may be required to use certified mail to confirm receipt. As with the filing process, you can get further instructions on how to serve the plaintiff from the court clerk or court website."
