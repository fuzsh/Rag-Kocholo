        "text": "In 1974, Revco sought to bring a whole new level of personal protection to industrial markets. We created the Black Stallion® brand to represent our principles of Quality, Service, and Innovation. Equally important was the desire to work closely with independent distributors who shared in our values of hard work and dedication. We took those ideals to heart and turned them into a sound business strategy. Today we have earned a track record of success, along with a nationwide network of distributors who believe in the power of mutual partnership. With the 2007 introduction of the innovative BSX® line and AngelFire® women’s line, Revco is more committed than ever to working together to raise the bar in industrial protection. One thing still remains the same – we will continue to embrace those principles which have served us and our customers so well. With great pride in our tradition of service, Revco will always be committed to your success in any business climate. We will continue to seek real value and quality at a time when these are so readily sacrificed. As experts in manufacturing and global sourcing, Revco will strive to be your primary source for protective wear. We will remain passionate in our mission to innovate new products that energize sales and create practical solutions for your customers. You can depend on Revco and our culture of honesty and integrity for a long-term partnership."
