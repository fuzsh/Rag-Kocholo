        "text": "The Czech capital market, roundly criticised for a lack of transparency, needs an independent regulator, but it is not a panacea for all of the market's woes, a senior Finance Ministry official said on Tuesday. \"Let's not be seduced by the illusion that as soon as an independent securities committee is created that the Czech capital market will become more refined overnight,\" Jan Veverka of the ministry's capital markets supervisory department told a conference in the Czech capital. \"All it (the body) will do is create better conditions for the changes which can contribute to the market's gradual refinement,\" he added. Both foreign and domestic investors have complained that poor legislation and a lack of enforcement of rules that do exist make the Czech capital market one of Eastern Europe's most opaque. The soured outlook by investors has helped pull the Prague Stock Exchange down some 16 percent over the past two months, with predictions of further losses if rules do not change quickly. One of the biggest problems is that legislation allows for near complete secrecy of off-market deals -- where an estimated 70 percent of trading takes place -- making it difficult for investors to determine fairly-valued shares prices. Veverka said when the laws governing securities trading here were devised \"parliament...discarded the concept of regulation which would have given broad powers to the embryonic supervisory system out of fear that it might have abused these powers and impeded the process of creating a market economy\". Coupled with this, he said, was the need to allow for a flood of ownership changes in the market as the mass voucher privatisation put shares in nearly 2,000 firms onto the market in a matter of months. Now, he said, rules must be put in place to shift trading toward the main markets to bring about more transparency. \"Where trading takes place can be changed most effectively by ensuring an increase in the quality of the market's services and an end to the conditions which enable the kind of trading which is characterised by large price discrepancies,\" he said. Veverka called for a raising of the debate on creating a U.S.-style SEC oversight body \"to a much higher level and preparations should be made for the creation of this body\". But he added: \"Monitoring deals and indentifying suspicious prices or other phenomena indisputably belongs to the work of the stock market, and the market must act as a strong support to the supervisory work of the independent committee\". -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n\n1\n\nSweden beat the Czech Republic 3-0 in a World Cup ice hockey game on Thursday, setting up a showdown for European group supremacy against Finland and leaving the reigning world champions searching for answers. The fast-skating Swedes seized control of the game from the opening faceoff, forcing the Czechs to take several early penalties and keeping its vaunted offense in check. Toronto Maple Leaf winger Mats Sundin opened the scoring midway through the first period when he sped around the Czech defense and pulled Dallas Stars' goalie Roman Turek across the crease before sliding the puck between the netminder's legs. The Swedish National Hockey League (NHL) connection struck again early in the second frame when Washington Capital defenseman Calle Johansson blasted a slapshot from the blue line past a screened Turek with only 57 seconds gone. Turek, voted best goalie at the world championships for the past two years, was once again screened when a weak shot from Jonas Bergqvist found the bottom corner of the net to close out the scoring for the undefeated Swedes. The Czechs came into the tournament riding high after capturing the world title in Vienna in May, but have lost the first two games of the tournament and are in danger of crashing out despite having their version of the \"Dream Team\". With the addition of Pittsburgh Penguins duo Jaromir Jagr and Petr Nedved, Montreal Canadiens sharpshooter Martin Rucinsky and the core of the world championship team in tact, the Czechs were looking to prove they belonged at the pinnacle of the hockey world. The match at Prague's Sports Hall was to be a homecoming of sorts for the Czechs, their first home game since beating Canada 3-2 in a thrilling world championship final on a last minute goal. But after a demoralising loss to Finland in its tournament opener on Tuesday, and another listless effort on Thursday, Czech fans had had enough, pelting the Czech bench with beer cans near the end of the game. Even Czech coach Ludek Bukac, a veteran coach with almost 30 years behind the bench, was left searching for an answer to his sputtering offense and the team's lack of dynamism. \"The Swedes played well, you've got to hand it to them. But the fact that we didn't score at home is not a very good showing,\" he said. Added Jagr: \"We aren't that bad, but our performance is not showing it.\" Bukac, who has often expressed his disdain for bringing in players who have talent but not team spirit refused to comment on whether he would invite the same team back if he could do it all again. But with nine players on the roster with seven or less of national team games under their belts, the Czech players know they must come together quickly, or face the embarassment of failing to win in what is touted as the true battle for hockey supremacy. \"We've got to concentrate on winning against Germany and moving on to the next round, nothing else,\" added Robert Reichel, who recently re-signed with the Calgary Flames after playing one year in Germany. The win allows Sweden to keep pace with group leaders Finland, who have also won both their games so far but have a better goal difference. The two teams meet on Sunday in Stockholm while the Czechs must regroup and beat winless Germany in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Saturday to move into the quarterfinals next week in North America.\n\n1\n\nThe fall in the Czech trade deficit to 10.5 billion crowns in September from 14.5 billion in August buoyed market sentiment, and the goods imported show industrial restructuring is on track, analysts said on Thursday. Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) data released earlier showed the January-September trade shortfall hit an all-time high of 110.7 billion crowns, far surpassing the full 1995 deficit of 95.7 billion crowns. But the September shortfall, the smallest one-month deficit this year, surprised analysts, who had forecast on average a gap of 13 to 15 billion crowns. \"I'm happily surprised. I think it's a relatively optimistic figure, though not so good as to make us revise our full year forecast,\" said Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance, which has forecast a 150-160 billion crown deficit at year-end. The CSU said September imports rose 15.2 percent year-on-year, the same as in August, while exports rose 5.9 percent after a 6.4 percent increase in August. It added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports. Analysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector as these imports are needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for export. The crown also reacted positively, dipping slightly on the release of the figures but quickly regaining its losses as the market digested the statistics. The crown was trading at 26.939 to the dollar at 0840 GMT after opening at 26.945. The rate implies a deviation from the midpoint of the currency basket of +2.87 percent, after the central bank's Wednesday fixing at +2.80 percent. \"The market is pleased with the figures for sure, they seem to bear out estimates that slowly, the structure and size of the deficit is getting better,\" said one local forex dealer. \" don't think the crown itself will benefit too much from the numbers, but it certainly should not weaken,\" he added. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n\n1\n\nCzech paper concern Sepap Group a.s. on Friday said its nine-month net profit fell as a shutdown of its main paper mill, coupled with a downturn in the paper cycle bit into its bottom line. Sepap said its nine-month net profit, calculated according to international accounting standards, fell to 188.4 million crowns from 520.4 million over the same period in 1995, while revenues slumped to 3.94 billion crowns from 5.34 billion. The firm said results from the third quarter only had stabilised after a first half industry downtrend, though \"the planned annual shutdown of the Steti mill lowered earnings by virtue of the expected higher maintenance costs associated with the stoppage\". \"Overall, Sepap year-end ernings are expected to rise and show a slight improvement over third quarter levels,\" a company statement said. The Steti mill, which accounts for some three-quarters of the group's revenues and profits, saw its pre-tax profits plummet to seven million crowns. Comparative figures were not immediately available, but the mill's nine-month 1995 gross profit was some 95 million crowns. \"The market place is sending mixed signals for the fourth quarter. Anticipated price increases have not taken hold at the anticipated levels in all of the pulp and paper grades,\" the statement said. It added that the group's second biggest subsidiary, newsprint maker ROTO, \"continued to produce good results in a market that is weakening\". ROTO showed a nine-month pre-tax profit of 149 million crowns on sales of 1.25 billion crowns. Last year, Sepap was the center of a heated battle for control between Bahamas-based investor Michael Dingman and Swedish forestry concern Assidoman. Dingman, who controls 48 percent of Sepap through his Daventree Ltd investment company, won the battle, but later accepted Assidoman's role as a strategic partner in the paper industry. The Swedish firm holds a 39 percent stake in Sepap. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n\n1\n\nCzech shares rallied on Monday following the coalition government's win in weekend Senate elections, but analysts said the rise was due more to a technical correction than to a change in investor sentiment. The Prague Stock Exchange's PX50 index rose 0.82 percent on the day, spurred by gains to seven of the eight most-capitalised shares. Brokers, however, were muted in their optimism that the rally would last more than a few days, saying the centre-right government's strong showing was expected and already built into the market last week. \"Basically, this is a technically-led rally, I don't think it has a basis to do with Senate elections,\" said Jay King of the brokerage Wood and Company. Added another local trader: \"You're not seeing real volumes here you're just seeing prices being pushed up in anticipation of year-end, and without a doubt it is domestically driven. Foreigner investors are still on the sidelines.\" The minority coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took 52 of 81 seats in the newly-created upper house of parliament, following the second round of voting, well ahead of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats which took 25 seats. The Senate is a mostly advisory body with limited legislative powers, but the election was the first test at the polls for Klaus since his coalition lost its lower house majority in general elections in June. But a thin turnout -- just over 30 percent of the electorate cast their ballots -- made it hard for the three-party coalition government, which lost its lower house majority in June, to claim it had recaptured voters' hearts. The Prague bourse has been hard hit in recent months -- falling some 17 percent since September -- with most investors shying away from the a market characterised as opaque at best, and little regard for minority shareholder rights. And analysts said that the election would probably not bring about a new push for changes to securities laws within the coalition, a condition that is necessary to lure back participants. \"I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring in changes,\" said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka. \"I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic.\" Analysts said that the market should take some heart however, in statements made by Klaus following the vote when he said he saw no reason to call early elections for the lower house, which should keep the market stable in the near future.\n\n1\n\nMarkets across Eastern Europe remained mired in an autumn slump this week, with analysts saying they see little impetus on the horizon to break the bearish trend. Stock Exchanges in Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest, Zagreb and Ljubljana all lost ground on the week, while Budapest bucked the trend, rising slightly though it appeared to lose steam by week's end. PRAGUE Not even a strong showing by the centre-right governing coalition in Senate elections at the weekend could break the Prague Stock Exchange out of its current slump, as the PX50 index dipped 0.8 points on the week to close Thursday at 509.3. Analysts said that while the coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus may feel heartened by the showing which gave him a majority to the Czech upper house, which will have little power, investors are still put off by poor market regulation. \"I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring changes to the market,\" said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka. \"I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic.\" Investors have long complained that market regualtion and legislation in the Czech Republic is weak, providing little protection for minority shareholders. WARSAW The Warsaw Stock Exchange stayed virtually flat this week and analysts were divided over the market's direction. Some said the bourse could extend its three-week horizontal trend as no fresh signals were in sight. \"We are still in a horizontal trend and...I see no factors which could help create a clear direction for the market,\" said Mateusz Andrzejewski, an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage. But others saw the generally positive economic climate as an impulse strong enough that it could help the bourse climb above 14,000 points next week. Analysts said a senior central bank official's comment on Tuesday on a possible rise in interest rates next year was bringing some uncertainty to the bourse but was unlikely to signficantly hurt prices. BUDAPEST Hungarian shares, triggered by last Thursday's government decision to hike energy prices, started off the weekend strongly, but ran out of steam by mid-week. Oil and gas company MOL led the charge, but dealers said its weakening on Thursday could be a harbinger for the bourse. \"MOL turned around today (on Thursday), that is a warning sign,\" said New York Broker's Kalman Schuszter. \"Sellers are stronger now.\" The BUX index closed on Thursday at 3,674.61, up 3.1 percent from Monday's open. BRATISLAVA Slovak share prices continued their freefall over the course of the week, in a rampant bear market that has seen the Bratislava Stock Exchange lose about 25 percent since the end of August. The 12-share SAX index fell 12.49 points on the week to close at 161.82 on Thursday. Dealers said the silver lining to the bourse's woes may be that prices are becoming so cheap, foreign investors will soon be lured back. BUCHAREST Scant demand kept volumes modest at both weekly sessions in Bucharest, with turnover low and most prices edging down or staying flat. The unofficial VAB index inched down from the previous session by 1.1 percent to 294.2 points, while the BIG index eased 1.07 percent to 293.41. Fertiliser maker Azomures SA dominated trading, while newcomer, an oilfield equipment maker, put on a poor show. ZAGREB Croatian stocks were mostly lower in dwindling trade and analysts said they could see no end to the bearish period as big buyers continue to shy away from the market because of political developments. Croatia has been shaken by a wave of strikes, and last week Zagreb saw its biggest protest in years. LJUBLJANA Political concerns were also apparent in Ljubljana this week, with investors waiting for a new prime minister to be named, probably in the second half of December. \"The market will be uneasy until it is clear who will form the new government,\" one trader said. The SBI index fell 6,7 points from MOnday's open to close on Thursday at 1,145.5. Although the Liberal Democrats of current Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek were the strongest single party in the November general election, winning 25 out of 90 parliamentary seats, they are facing a loose alliance of rightist \"Spring\" parties, who got 45 seats.

But the premier's own party won fewer seats than expected after dominating the first round last week and voter turnout was dismal despite an appeal for Czechs to cast their ballots from President Vaclav Havel. With all 81 constituencies declared, the coalition parties secured 52 seats in the Senate, the very existence of which many Czechs have questioned. The result marked a turnaround for the coalition, central Europe's last centre-right government, which lost its majority in the more powerful lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, six months ago. Klaus's own Civic Democratic Party (ODS) won 32 seats ahead of the strongest opposition party, the Social Democrats, with 25. The Christian Democrats, a junior coalition partner, took take 13 seats while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance, won seven. The little-reformed Communists clinched two seats and two went to independents. \"I welcome the fact that the governing coalition took two-thirds of the senatorial seats, and that's a huge victory over the opposition,\" said Klaus, who sits in the lower house along with all other government ministers. \"The result in the second round isn't any surprising victory, but on the other hand the real fact that ODS has about 40 percent of the senators I would have to mark as successful.\" The Central Election Commission reported that second round turnout was around 30 percent, lower even than the 35 percent registered in the first round held on November 15-16. The centre-left Social Democrats, whose strong gains in June lower house elections stripped the coalition's majority, were saved the embarassment of a Senate dominated solely by their arch-rivals from Klaus's party. \"I am pleased that Senate will be a place of democratic discussion, and never the place of arrogant domination of one or another political party,\" Milos Zeman, the chairman of the Social Democrats and the lower house, told reporters. Zeman's party has been beset by internal bickering since June, but the results of the run-offs -- between the top two first-round candidates in constituencies where nobody won more than half the vote -- could have been worse for the opposition. \"Most importantly the Senate won't be one-coloured or two-coloured as was expected, but multi-coloured,\" said analyst Jiri Pehe of Prague's Open Media Research Institute. Before the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house but opinion surveys showed many had no interest. The Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus's coalition. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance. Klaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the Communists to turn back the clock on reform, and his supporters were galvanised by the coalition's June setback.\n\n1\n\nBritain's Tim Henman emerged on Friday as the only seed to advance to the semifinals of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open. In the day's opening match, seventh seeded Henman downed second seed Wayne Ferreira 6-4 6-3, while fifth seed Todd Martin was edged out by Germany's David Prinosil 7-6 7-6 and sixth seed Michael Stich lost to Czech Martin Damm 5-7 6-4 6-4. Czech Petr Korda rounded out the final four with his win over Davis Cup team mate Jiri Novak 6-1 6-0. Korda now faces another Davis Cupper in Damm. Henman will square off against Prinosil in the other semifinal on Saturday. Reigning Ostrava champion Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, never looked comfortable against Henman, the more aggressive of the two for most of the match. He failed to gain a single break point all match while the 22-year-old Briton broke serve late in both sets. Henman's win avenged his loss to the South African in Toronto earlier this year, and he said he had taken notes from that match on to court on Friday. \"In Toronto, Ferreira was dictating the points -- serving very well and hitting forehands very well -- so today I tried to be very aggressive and, when I had an opportunity, move forward,\" said Henman, ranked 26th in the world. Local favourite Damm, a finalist at the Beijing Open last week showed little signs of jet lag in spoiling Stich's 28th birthday. After losing the first set, Damm scored crucial breaks in the ninth game of the final two sets to take the match. For Martin, defeat was especially painful as he could have gained valuable ground on Ferreira in the race for the final spot at the ATP Tour championship in Hanover at the end of the season. The American currently sits 199 points behind the South African. A semifinal berth would have eaten 37 points out of that lead while a place in the finals would have almost halved Ferreira's advantage. Prinosil, ranked 58th in the world, profited from a Martin double fault at 5-5 in the first set tiebreak and took a 4-0 lead in the second set tiebreak on the way to sealing victory. Martin said: \"I realise I didn't help my cause at all but we've got two of the biggest tournaments coming up and I think whoever does really well in those events should probably play themselves into a position at Hanover. Martin, Stich and Ferreira both play next week in Stuttgart, where the winner gains 370 tour points, 200 more than the winner here. The tournament's organisers said on Friday that they expect Becker will also be fit to play. In a move to accomodate the Australian Open champion, his first round match has been put back until Wednesday.\n\n1\n\nCzech telephone operator SPT Telecom a.s. on Thursday said its nine-month gross profit hit 6.0 billion crowns, in line with analysts predictions and likely to have little effect on the firm's share price. SPT said in a statement that revenues for the first three quarters totalled 23.3 billion crowns, nearly equal to the 26.4 billion crowns in total revenues for 1995. SPT's 1995 full year gross profit was 7.0 billion crowns. All figures are calculated according to International Accounting Standards (IAS). SPT shares closed down six crowns at 2,879 on the Prague Stock Exchange on Thursday, though dealers said the results came out after trading ended for the day. \"The figures were basically in line with our estimates. Margins are pretty much the same as they were in the first half so I think the company is in a good position for future growth,\" said Alex Marcek an analyst at Patria Finance. The statement added the number of lines installed accelerated in the third quarter, putting the year-to-date figure at 272,000 lines and the overall installed base at 2.67 million lines. \"The company is confident that it will achieve its 1996 target of over 400,000 new set lines,\" the statement said. SPT, of which a Dutch-Swiss consortium comprised of PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom bought a 27 percent stake last summer, is aiming to increase the network by another 500,000 lines in 1997, and 650,000 in 1998. The statement said that investment expenditures for the first nine months totalled more than 20 billion crowns, \"more than the full year 1995 capital expenditure. \"If they hit the target of 400,000 new lines it would be a pretty good base as far as revenues are concerned,\" said one local telecom analyst. Analysts said that the figures would probably not have an immediate effect on SPT's share price, since the entire Czech capital market is in a downturn as investors avoid a market they characterise as plagued with a lack of transparency. Company officials have been adamant that SPT would not pay a dividend before 1998, as profits would still have to be ploughed back into the network's modernisation. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n\n1\n\nCzech telephone operator SPT Telecom a.s. on Thursday reported a nine-month gross profit of 6.0 billion crowns, in line with forecasts, and said outlays for investment rose significantly in the period. \"The figures were basically in line with our estimates. Margins are pretty much the same as they were in the first half so I think the company is in a good position for future growth,\" said Alex Marcek an analyst at Patria Finance. The company's gross profit for all of 1995 was 7.0 billion crowns. SPT used International Accounting Standards in calculating its profit. In a statement, the company said revenues totalled 23.3 billion crowns, nearly equal to the 26.4 billion crowns for 1995. SPT said outlays for investment in the nine-month period exceeded 20 billion crowns or more than the total for 1995. A Dutch-Swiss consortium of PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom, which bought a 27 percent stake in SPT from the government last summer, has effective day-to-day control of the firm. The consortium paid $1.32 billion for its stake. SPT said it installed more telephone lines in the Czech Republic in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date figure to 272,000 lines. SPT now has a total of 2.67 million lines. \"The company is confident that it will achieve its 1996 target of over 400,000 new set lines,\" the statement said. The company is aiming to increase its network by another 500,000 lines in 1997, and 650,000 in 1998. SPT is the only telephone line operator in the country. There are also two GSM mobile phone operators, but they do not install hard lines. \"If they hit the target of 400,000 new lines it would be a pretty good base as far as revenues are concerned,\" said one local telecom analyst. SPT shares closed down six crowns at 2,879 in after-bourse trading in Prague. The company didn't comment on its dividend policy. SPT has said in the past that it doesn't plan to pay a dividend before 1998. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n\n1\n\nGermany's David Prinosil ended rising British star Tim Henman's bid for his first ATP Tour victory on Saturday, while Czech Petr Korda halted compatriot Martin Damm's quest for his second final appearance in two weeks. Prinosil beat Henman 6-4 6-3 in the semifinals of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open and Korda followed with a hard-fought 4-6 6-3 7-5 victory against his Davis Cup team mate. Seventh seed Henman, who had not lost a set all week, looked shaky on his groundstrokes early, but stayed in contention with his strong serve, firing seven of his 11 aces in the first set. But in the 10th game of the match, Henman's serve failed him, his double fault giving the German triple break point. Henman, who has now reached seven semifinals but never gone further, fought back with a service winner and then an ace, but as he has done all week, Prinosil blasted a brilliant return to take the point and set. The British number one recovered to gain two break points of his own in the third game, but failed to come up big when he needed to. Prinosil, who was born near here in Olomouc before emigrating to Germany, then took control. Henman said: \"I didn't serve well at the right times. I felt confident coming into the match, (but) I just didn't really make anything happen today. It was just a case of not really having a good day at the office. \"I'm disappointed to have lost because I thought it was a good opportunity to make my first final. Bar this match, I've played very well this week and am confident going into Stuttgart and Paris.\" Prinosil said: \"I served very strongly today and just tried to play within myself, not get too excited and lose my concentration. No matter what happens tomorrow, this tournament has been a great success for me.\" Damm also looked on the bright side, viewing his appearance in the final last Sunday in the Beijing Open and this week's march to the semifinals as two of the best weeks of tennis he has ever played. Victimns on the way have included world number three Michael Chang and ex-Wimbledon champion Michael Stich. For Korda the win came as a relief following claims in the local media that he could no longer hold his nerve in big matches. The former world number five has suffered several injuries in the past two years, dropping to 49th in the rankings. \"I felt a lot of pressure at the beginning of the match and I've never seen Martin play that well, but I think I also showed that I am still capable of playing tennis at the highest level,\" said Korda, who won his first tournament in two seasons at the Qatar Open earlier this year.\n\n1\n\nThe Czech September trade deficit is expected to grow by between 13 and 15 billion crowns after a 14.7 billion crown monthly deficit in August, a Reuters poll of Czech economists showed on Wednesday. Czech trade figures for the first nine months are scheduled to be released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) at 0900 local time (0700 GMT) on Thursday. Most economists surveyed said they expect steady growth in the deficit and few surprises. \"It's still too early to talk about a period of stabilisation in the deficit, I think that will come in 1997 when imports level off and exports strengthen,\" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings told Reuters. Whatever the deficit in September, the nine-month trade gap is sure to be a record, after the January-August figure reached 100.9 billion crowns, more than all of the 1995's total shortfall of 95.7 billion crowns. The January-September 1995 trade deficit was 62.3 billion crowns. Most analysts agreed a 13-15 billion September gap would be in-line with prevailing trends, and on target for the estimated deficit of 150-160 billion crowns. Analysts say the trade balance has been hurt by a downturn in the economies of western Europe earlier in the year, and a the effects of a recovery of demand in western Europe have yet to make an impact. The government and central bank, however, has repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to boost exports. Analysts point to mid-1997 as a crucial time in which the import wave -- which is aimed at modernising industries -- must show results in productivity growth and competitiveness. Economists said the deficit could be financed this year, but might pose problems in the second half of 1997. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n\n1\n\nThe Prague Stock Exchange suffered one of its biggest one-day falls on Friday as foreign interest waned because of a lack of market transparency. Four of the PSE's five largest issues fell sharply in active trading, pulling the Reuters RPIX index down nearly three percent to 1,052. Long-criticised for its lack of transparency and regulation, analysts say Friday's loss was yet another sign that investors, especially foreigners, are pulling out of the market having grown tired of failed promises of reform. \"There's just a total lack of interest in this market,\" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. \"Fundamentally, companies look pretty cheap, but the lack of foreign interest and Czechs fearing the possibility of a devaluation and looking abroad (mean) you don't have that much buying interest.\" Under the Czech Republic's Securities Act, which was devised to handle the logistics of the government's massive voucher privatisation scheme, the Securities Registry (SCP) is bound by law to provide services such as moving securities to and from client accounts. Since the SCP does not reveal any details of transactions, including prices and volumes, brokers have taken to the SCP because of its privacy and faster settlement process. The problems have restrained the PSE which sees on average $4-$6 million of stock changing hands each day, compared with $15 million turnover in Warsaw, where the market has a capitalisation of just $3 billion. \"Unambiguously, a notable portion of foreign investors are not satisified with the current state of the Czech capital market,\" said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance. In April, parliament approved a series of market reforms to compel companies and fund managers to be more open and accountable. A key element tackles the chronic problem of slow and irregular reporting of company earnings and actions. The PSE has taken several steps to brings more transparency to the market, but some analysts say that the process is taking too long. In mid-September, the Prague Stock Exchange pledged to improve the state of the market, stressing in particular the need for the early creation of an independent watchdog. But many analysts were disappointed by the lack of strong enforcement requirements, as market supervision is still kept in the hands of a small, under-resourced Finance Ministry department. And some question whether there is even the political will here to change the market, or if a few regulations will be enough to change the attitude of many market participants. \"The problem isn't only with market regulations. I don't feel the political will which can bring change and prevent frauds.,\" Markus Winkler, manager of the Discover Europe Investment Fund was quoted in the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes as saying on Friday.\n\n1\n\nSenate runoff elections on Friday and Saturday should have little impact on Czech capital markets, as investors focus on macroeconomic fundamentals, not political influences. Analysts said last weekend's first round of voting gave a mild boost to the Czech crown and the Prague Stock Exchange, and unless results from the second round of voting on Friday and Saturday vary greatly, little further boost should be seen. \"Provided that nothing drastic happens, it's pretty much a non-starter from a foreign investor point of view. I think that for the markets, it will be pretty much a non-event,\" Jay King, of Wood and Company, told Reuters. In the first round of voting last weekend, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's right-wing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) posted a strong result, capturing over 36.5 percent of the national vote, an increase of some six percent from June lower house elections where his coalition lost its majority. The opposition Social Democrats were second with 20.3 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists but only 35 percent of the electorate voted. Of the 81 Senate seats, the ODS won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates go into the runoff, compared with 48 for the CSSD. In 47 constituencies, the runoff is a straight fight between the two main parties. Analysts said that with the two main parties assured of dominating the Senate, a body which will have limited powers anyway, little change appears imminent for the country's economic, or political course. \"Our expectation is ODS gaining somewhere around half of the total, and including the rest of the coalition it might be well over 50 seats. I don't think there should be any surprises,\" said Radek Maly, an economist at Citibank Prague. Following last weekend's vote, the PSE, mired in a two month long slump began to edge higher, gaining some four percent over the week. But dealers said the gains were based more on weak local buying than a change in sentiment from key foreign investors. The crown too, ratcheted up slightly after the first round of voting, but has since steadied at 2.9 percent stronger than its dollar/mark basket midpoint. Some analysts said foreign investors might be tempted, as they were the previous week, to play on a strong Klaus victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived. \"There may be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown,\" said Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. \"There's no other factor, more or less the basic impulse for that (a stronger crown) was really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets.\" Citibank's Maly added: \"I wouldn't foresee any major changes in the fixed income market. The fixed income market is rather less sensitive to these political events than is the FX (foreign exchange) market.\" -- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003\n\n1\n\nEast European bourses were mostly higher this week with the Warsaw Stock Exchange leading the way, hitting a 30-month high before easing slightly on profit-taking. Budapest, Zagreb, Bratislava, Ljubljana and Sofia also posted gains, while markets in Prague and Bucharest lost ground in listless trading. The Central European Share Index (CESI), which measures the performance of Prague, Budapest and Warsaw blue-chip stocks, dipped 0.29 percent to 1,486.55 points. WARSAW Polish shares on Friday extended Thursday's falls due to profit-taking, after a four-session, 2.7-percent rise on the back of gains on western bourses. Analysts said the market could slip below 14,800 points before picking up toward the middle of next week as firms release their September earnings reports. \"It looks like we'll have falls for a few sessions, with the first support line at 14,800 points possibly broken,\" said Grzegorz Pindur, an analyst at Bank Staropolski brokerage. The main market's all-share WIG index closed at 14,920.4 points, up 244.5 points or 1.7 percent from Friday's close. PRAGUE The Prague Stock Exchange continued to limp through October, yet to record an advancing session, with little hope in sight for a turnaround as investors shun a market plagued by a lack of transparency. The PX50 index closed at 542.4 on Friday, down 13.1 points, or 2.36 percent. \"I think the budget first reading passing is too weak a signal but it is definitely positive. There are still structural problems to be solved before investors get more confident in this market,\" said Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings. Foreign investors have long-complained that Czech capital markets are plagued by weak securities legislation that allows for secretive transactions. An estimated 70 percent of all market activity takes place off-market. BUDAPEST The Budapest Stock Exchange closed the week at an all-time high, boosted by the release of some positive macroeconomic figures. On Friday the BUX index closed at 3,639.68 points, up 31.67 from last Friday's close. \"Price rises were not very significant but they may mark the beginning of a modestly bullish trend,\" said Robert Agoston of Daewoo Securities. \"These macroeconomic data triggered price increases.\" Hungary released wide range of macroeconomic data this week, including the central bank's preliminary current account, trade gap, reserve and inflation data, in addition. BRATISLAVA The Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) also suffered through another week of sluggish trading, though a jump on Friday appeared to bear out broker predictions of signs that activity was gradually reviving. The 12-share SAX index fell through the 200 level at mid-week, but then rebounded slightly to close at 203.82 points on Friday, up from Monday's open at 200.32 points. \"We have witnessed some fresh players on our market over the past few days, and the good thing is that the ratio between foreign and domestic investor seems to be well-balanced,\" said Libor Briska of Creditanstalt. BUCHAREST Thin interest from retail investors, who dominate the bourse, drove most share prices down this week. Two independent indices fell to year-lows at both weekly sessions as investors awaited fresh listings to the currently traded 13 stocks. Last week, the bourse said 11 companies had applied for listing but did not say when they would join trading. The VAB index fell 1.5 percent to 291.7 points on Thursday and the BIG index dipped 1.6 percent to 289.98 points. SOFIA Two corporate issues traded higher on the Bulgarian stock market this week amid low investor interest. The 13-share Reuter All Bulgaria Stock Index (RABSI) closed at 41.28 points, up 0.26 from last Thursday due to the rise of RIF' third issue and TBS Hotels second issue. TIRANA Tirana's Stock Exchange this week recorded a 100 million leks transaction in 364-day treasury bills on Monday but no bonds changed hands on Thursday. The Savings Bank sold 100 million leks worth of 364-day T-Bills to the National Commercial Bank on Monday, the first of Tirana's Stock Exchange (TSE) two weekly sessions. The finance ministry on Thursday offered 800 million leks worth of 91-day t-bills, 400 million leks of 182-day t-bills and one billion leks in 364-day t-bills. ZAGREB Croatian stocks forged ahead throughout the week, ending mixed on Friday as selected hoteliers closed slightly lower after recording new highs during the week. Traders said growing supply will stabilise prices next week. LJUBLJANA Slovenian shares jumped 18.5 percent this week, pushing the index up 202.6 points to 1,299.70 as investors snapped up shares of newly-privatised companies.

Exchanges in Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, Bratislava and Bucharest all rose, while Zagreb and Sofia traded mixed. Ljubljana was the one gray cloud, posting slight losses. The Central European Share Index (CESI) which reflects the price movements of 50 selected Czech, Polish and Hungarian shares, firmed 66.11 points. PRAGUE Czech share prices were mostly steady on the Prague Stock Exchange throughout the week, with little movement expected soon as the holiday season slowly winds up. The PX50 index edged up 3.6 points from Monday to close at 568.6 on Thursday. Leading trading were SPT Telecom and Komercni Banka, though SPT's movements were largely characterised as \"accounting procedures\" that saw the issue gain as much as 102 crowns one session, only to lose the same amount the following day. \"The final price (of SPT) was not the real market price, but because average prices are not used for the close, it gives an artificial final number,\" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. SPT closed on Thursday at 3,340 crowns. Dealers have long-complained that some market participants consistently manipulate prices on the bourse, a fact that to cloud foreign investor perceptions of the Czech market. WARSAW Polish shares on Thursday rose for the sixth consecutive session but analysts said stronger selling after price-fixing showed the market was losing steam and made it unclear if the growth trend would continue. \"It seems we now have a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers,\" said Krzysztof Rogalski, an analyst at Bank Staropolski SA brokerage. But some analysts said a real growth trend had already begun, sparked by firms releasing better July earnings at the start of the week. The WIG index closed at 13,597.4 points, up 892.7 points or 7.0 percent from last Friday's close. Analysts said recent systematic gains in higher turnovers by several large-cap stocks was a good sign that could help return the market toward this year's July 5, 14,282.2-point high next week. BUDAPEST Prices rose at both of this week's sessions as market participants returned after holidays on Monday and Tuesday. The rest of the market strengthened as investors were cheered because the U.S. Federal Reserve had left interest rates steady. \"It's certainly due to the fact the U.S. investors put money into the east European emerging markets,\" Peter Haas of Postabank Securities said. \"Optimism seems to have spread over investors after the danger of a rate hike was eliminated.\" The BUX index closed on Thursday at 3,370.23, up 198.79 points over last Friday. BRATISLAVA The Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) saw a week of listless holiday trading, with the ongoing struggle for strategic control over the country's largest investment fund, VUB Kupon, dominating floor trading. The 12-share SAX index posted several year-highs over the week, peaking at 226.34 points on Tuesday, and closing at 223.75 points on Thursday, slightly firmer from Monday's open. \"This week was a transparent example, showing how the index is often far off from real trends on the market,\" Dusan Sykora of ING Barings said. \"The SAX has been reaching top levels, while only a few trades were concluded on the bourse on low volumes,\" he added. SOFIA No corporate issues traded for a third week in a row on the Bulgarian stock market as investors turnede their attention to treasuries and foreign currency. Only the Sofia Stock Exchange (SSE) operated this week after the Bulgarian Stock Exchange (BSE) went into a summer recess on August 5. The BSE will resume trading on September 2. The 13-share Reuter All Bulgaria Stock Exchange Index (RABSI) closed at 41.31 points, unchanged from last Thursday. BUCHAREST Romanian share prices posted gains this week on the back of healthy half-year earnings reports by several firms but trading, dominated by retail investors, was modest in volume. Overall turnover fell by almost 30 million lei to 68.5 million on Thursday. The unofficial VAB Index -- a value-weighted index of all stocks computed by Vanguard SA securities -- closed at 371 points, 8.20 points or 3.5 percent up on the week. Its base was 1,000 points when it was created last November. ZAGREB Croatian stocks were mixed though the summer lull seemed to be nearing an end as big buyers became more active, boosting prices and prompting broker predictions of a steady rise in the weeks to come. Most active was Zagrebacka Banka which gained 130 kuna since last Tuesday, but other companies including foodprocessor Podravka also registered an increase of prices. LJUBLJANA In Ljubljana, share prices, eased 0.4 percent as the SBI index fell 4.31 points to 980.60.

In the only other match involving a seeded player on the opening day, Britain's Tim Henman overpowered Sweden's Nicklas Kulti 7-6 6-4. Both players took advantage of the fast carpet court, blasting service winner after service winner to demoralise their opponents. Ivanisevic, ranked fifth in the world, started slowly against world number 42 Voinea, before pulling away in the middle of the tie break and never looked back. \"It's always tough to play in a new hall and the carpet here is much faster than last week in Vienna,\" said Ivanisevic who hit 14 aces. \"But this was good preparation though because the tournament has so many top players. To win it will take at least one win over a top 10 player.\" Ivanisevic's is scheduled to play the winner of Tuesday's match between Czech Petr Korda and Ecuardor's Nicolas Lapentti and could also have to get past third seed Boris Becker and eighth seeded Czech Bohdan Ulihrach it he is to reach Sunday's final. Henman also used his dominating serve to wear down Kulti. \"It was a tough match but I think I should have taken the first set before the tiebreak,\" said Henman. \"He fought back well but I felt more comfortable in the second set. \"I enjoy playing a tough match right from the start, it focuses you very quickly.\"\n\n1\n\nThe Prague Stock Exchange hit a new year-high on Thursday as major banking issues broke out of a recent slump to spur the bourse higher. Komercni Banka and Ceska Sporitelna, the country's two largest banks both posted strong gains to help push the PX50 index up 3.3 points, or 0.58 percent, to a 1996 high of 574.9. Overall, advancing issues narrowly outpaced decliners by 320 to 298, with 192 holding steady. Total volume remained steady at 916,194 shares on turnover of 648.3 million crowns. Komercni, a likely recipient of attention from investors looking to enter the Czech market after an announcement of its inclusion into the Morgan Stanley index, jumped 99 crowns to close at 2,439. Meanwhile, savings bank Ceska Sporitelna also posted a strong gain of 16 crowns to 351. \"The inclusion of the Czech Republic in the Morgan Stanley index should help boost issues like Komercni,\" said Jan Sykora of the brokerage Wood and Company. Earlier in the day, Sporitelna CEO Jaroslav Klapal announced the bank expects 1996 net profit to total 2.1 billion crowns, while gross profit will hit at least 6.1 billion. Klapal added that he expected the bank would pay a higher dividend in 1996 than its five crown per share dividend for last year. \"Gross profit, before the creation of reserves and payment of taxes could be slightly above 6.1 billion crowns,\" Klapal said. \"We are counting on dividends for this year will be higher than that of last year.\" Sporitelna's 1995 after-tax profit, calculated according to Czech accounting standards, plummetted to 263 million crowns from a previous 980 million crowns after the bank provisioned heavily for risky loans. The bank's 1995 gross profit was 9.17 billion crowns but the bank assigned almost an identical sum, 9.13 billion, to its reserves covering \"classified\" loans -- those whose likelihood of recovery ranges from doubtful to hopeless. Klapal did not say whether his forecasts were calculated according to Czech or international accounting standards, which vary mainly in terms of allowable write-offs and depreciation costs. Even though analysts agreed that the financial situation of the bank was markedly better this year than it was last year, they said shares of the bank were overvalued. Analysts say they are closely watching what appears to be a strong acquisition of shares in Sporitelna by the usually secretive Czech investment group Motoinvest and the rival bank Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. \"The attractiveness of (Sporitelna) could greatly drop if Motoinvest took a more significant share in management,\" said Richard Podpiera analyst at the investment house Atlantk FT.\n\n1\n\nCzech paper concern Sepap Group a.s. on Friday said its nine-month net profit fell as a shutdown of its main paper mill, coupled with a downturn in the paper cycle bit into its bottom line. Sepap said its nine-month net profit, calculated according to international accounting standards, fell to 188.4 million crowns ($7 million) from 520.4 million over the same period in 1995, while revenues slumped to 3.94 billion crowns from 5.34 billion. The firm said results from the third quarter only had stabilised after a first half industry downtrend, though \"the planned annual shutdown of the Steti mill lowered earnings by virtue of the expected higher maintenance costs associated with the stoppage\". \"Overall, Sepap year-end earnings are expected to rise and show a slight improvement over third quarter levels,\" a company statement said. The Steti mill, which accounts for some three-quarters of the group's revenues and profits, saw its pre-tax profits plummet to seven million crowns. Comparative figures were not immediately available, but the mill's nine-month 1995 gross profit was some 95 million crowns. \"The market place is sending mixed signals for the fourth quarter. Anticipated price increases have not taken hold at the anticipated levels in all of the pulp and paper grades,\" the statement said. It added that the group's second biggest subsidiary, newsprint maker ROTO, \"continued to produce good results in a market that is weakening\". ROTO showed a nine-month pre-tax profit of 149 million crowns on sales of 1.25 billion crowns. Last year, Sepap was the centre of a heated battle for control between Bahamas-based investor Michael Dingman and Swedish forestry concern Assidoman. Dingman, who controls 48 percent of Sepap through his Daventree Ltd investment company, won the battle, but later accepted Assidoman's role as a strategic partner in the paper industry. The Swedish firm holds a 39 percent stake in Sepap. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($ = 26.86 Czech Crowns)\n\n1\n\nThe Prague Stock Exchange suffered one of its biggest one-day falls ever on Friday, as waning foreign interest due to a lack of market transparency continues to run roughshod over the beleaguered bourse.

The apathy suggested that the real winners might not be Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate elections and told fellow Czechs to follow suit. Unofficial figures from the two-day first round, which ended on Saturday, indicated that turnout would be well under 40 percent, by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism. Opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted that turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23. \"I think that no party can be happy with the low election turnout, because people that don't turn out for the Senate elections are giving up their civic rights, the right to vote, the right to decide,\" Zeman told reporters. No national figures were available immediately after the polls closed at 2.00 p.m. (1300 GMT). But preliminary, unofficial data from some of the 81 constituencies showed Klaus's centre-right ODS doing well against a bleak background on turnout. In the Western city of Plzen, turnout was just 36 percent with the ODS candidate expected to face a Social Democrat in the second round, the Czech news agency CTK reported. If no candidate wins more than half the vote in the first round, the top two candidates go through to the runoff. In the northern mining town of Most, turnout was 26 percent with the ODS candidate leading trade union leader Richard Falbr, who is running for the Social Democrats. Pundits have billed the Senate elections as an indicator of whether the Czech Republic can break out of a political impasse following inconclusive lower house polls which stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority last June. But the apparent low turnout, which compares with 76.4 percent in June, seems a vindication of the Republicans and their leader Miroslav Sladek. Sladek regards the Senate as a waste of time and money. \"They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,\" he told a recent anti-election rally, adding that it \"would be lazy, useless and expensive\". Conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority. If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier.\n\n1\n\nCzech share prices rallied following the coalition government's win in weekend Senate elections, but analysts said the rise is due more to a technical correction than a change in investor sentiment. The Prague Stock Exchange's PX50 index rose 0.86 percent at the bourse's daily price fixing, spurred by gains to seven of the eight most-capitalised shares. Brokers, however, were muted in their optimism that the rally would last more than a few days, saying the centre-right government's strong showing was expected and already built into the market last week. \"Basically, this is a technically-led rally, I don't think it has a basis to do with Senate elections,\" said Jay King of the brokerage Wood and Company. Added another local trader: \"You're not seeing real volumes here you're just seeing prices being pushed up in anticipation of year-end, and without a doubt it is domestically driven. Foreigner investors are still on the sidelines.\" The minority coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took 52 of 81 seats in the newly-created upper house of parliament, following the second round of voting, well ahead of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats which took 25 seats. The Senate is a mostly advisory body with limited legislative powers, but the election was the first test at the polls for Klaus since his coalition lost its lower house majority in general elections in June. But a thin turnout -- just over 30 percent of the electorate cast their ballots -- made it hard for the three-party coalition government, which lost its lower house majority in June, to claim it had recaptured voters' hearts. The Prague bourse has been hard hit in recent months -- falling some 17 percent since September -- with most investors shying away from the a market characterised as opaque at best, and little regard for minority shareholder rights. And analysts said that the election would probably not bring about a new push for changes to securities laws within the coalition, a condition that is necessary to lure back participants. \"I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring in changes,\" said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka. \"I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic.\" Analysts said that the market should take some heart however, in statements made by Klaus following the vote when he said he saw no reason to call early elections for the lower house, which should keep the market stable in the near future. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n\n1\n\nThird seed Boris Becker withdrew from the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open on Thursday because of a recurring wrist injury. Becker, who tore a ligament in his right wrist during the third round at this year's Wimbledon, was in pain after training and dropped out of his scheduled second round match against Czech Martin Damm. \"Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening,\" ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw said. On Wednesday evening, Becker cruised to a 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein. During the match he held his wrist several times. The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month but the injury forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago. Becker's absence has set back his plan to qualify for a record 12th appearance at the season-ending ATP Tour championship. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira for the eighth and final spot in Hannover. Second seed Ferreira scraped through to the quarter-finals in Ostrava with a 7-6 5-7 7-5 victory over Dutch qualifier Joost Winnink. Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, was stretched to the limit by Winnink. Their absorbing baseline battle ended in the 12th game of the deciding set when Winnink's backhand let him down on three successive occasions. Although Becker was ranked only third for Ostrava behind Goran Ivanisevic and Ferreira, it was clear most fans wanted to watch him. Barely 1,000 saw Ivanisevic's first round against world number 42 Adrian Voinea. A tournament record 10,000 watched Becker defeat Fetterlein, ranked 156. Seventh seed Tim Henman reached the last eight with a 7-6 7-5 victory over British Davis Cup team mate Greg Rusedski.\n\n1\n\nThe Czech trade deficit jumped sharply in October, rising nearly 16 billion crowns ($600 million), but analysts were not alarmed by the rise, which was in line with their full year forecasts. The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Tuesday the trade gap for the first 10 months of the year hit a record 125.5 billion crowns, up from a revised 109.6 billion crown shortfall for January-September. The CSU, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and some analysts have predicted the deficit -- inflated by economic slowdown with the country's main trading partner, Germany -- will finish the year at a record 150-160 billion crowns. \"The figures are developing according to forecasts. It's clear that the year-end deficit will be 150-160 billion crowns,\" said Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka. \"I'm not surprised by the jump since the economic revival of Germany will only show up in export growth in the first half of next year, not in one or two months,\" he added. The CSU said in a statement that imports in the first ten months of the year rose by 14.4 percent year-on-year, down from 15.2 percent in the first nine months, while exports rose by 5.2 percent after a 5.9 percent increase in January-September. It added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, growing by 19.1 percent year- on-year and accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports. Analysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector because the imports were needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for exporting. \"The trend seems unchanged. The financing of future economic growth is being done with imports, especially in the heavy machinery sector,\" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings said. Martin Kupka of Patria Finance added -- \"The country is still clamouring for machinery and raw materials which are necessary for industrial restructuring.\" Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, a monetarist-economist, has said the record trade deficit is \"not tragic\", adding it has come partly from a temporary foreign investment wave. The Czech crown reacted indifferently to the trade figures on Tuesday, hovering around three percent above its dollar/mark basket parity, where it was for most of Monday. The crown was trading at 26.919 to the dollar at 1230 local time (1130 GMT). The rate implies a deviation from the midpoint of the currency basket of +3.09 percent, after the central bank's fixing earlier on Tuesday at +3.00 percent. \"The market is neither alarmed nor pleased with the figure. If the deficit hits the forecast level, I doubt we will see any significant change in the currency's value,\" said one local forex dealer. -- Prague newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=26.78 Czech Crown)\n\n1\n\nThe Czech Republic and Spain played out a scoreless draw in their World Cup group six qualifier on Wednesday, in a match that never lived up to expectations. The Czechs were facing their first big test since they reached the Euro 96 final, while Real Madrid's teenage striker Raul was looking to spark a depleted Spanish attack in his first full international. Both sides opened their World Cup campaigns last month with high-scoring victories over the two weakest teams in the group, Spain winning 6-2 in the Faroe Islands and the Czechs thrashing Malta 6-0. But Yugoslavia have already collected three wins and Slovakia two against the same two hapless victims and neither team could afford to give ground in Prague. Like two heavyweights feeling each other out in the early rounds, both teams started tentatively, waiting to pounce on the other's mistakes. The Spaniard's were the first to flinch when Kaiserslautern striker Pavel Kuka's cross found an unmarked Karel Poborsky just outside the crease. But the Manchester United midfielder failed to control the ball, wasting what would turn out be one of the game's few good scoring chances. Next it was the Czechs turn to falter. Newcastle United goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek, winning his first cap in over a year, tried to clear the ball, but hit attacker Alfonso Perez and watched helplessly as it rolled just wide of the net. The Czechs picked up their play in the second half, putting Spain on their heels for the rest of the game. \"I don't think we lost points tonight because they are such an excellent team. They played strongly in the defence and its too bad we missed out on the two great chances we had,\" said Czech striker Patrik Berger. Teams: Czech Republic: 1-Pavel Srnicek, 2-Radoslav Latal, 3-Jan Suchoparek, 4-Pavel Nedved (15-Martin Frydek, 86th), 5-Miroslav Kadlec, 6-Michal Hornak, 7-Jiri Nemec, 8-Karel Poborsky (17-Vladimir Smicer, 58th), 9-Pavel Kuka, 10-Patrik Berger, 11-Radek Bejbl Spain: 1-Andoni Zubizarreta, 2-Abelardo Fernandez, 3-Sergi Barjuan, 4-Rafael Alkorta, 5-Miguel Angel Nadal, 6-Fernando Hierro, 7-Raul Gonzalez, 8-Luis Enrique Martinez, 9-Guillermo Amor (18-Ismael Urzaiz, 76th), 10-Julen Guerrero (14-Josep Guardiola, 52nd), 11-Alfonso Perez (15-Roberto Rios, 73rd)\n\n1\n\nIt's a Snip, bidding to become the ninth horse to win two years in succession in the 106-year history of the Pardubice steeplechase, leads a British raid to this city east of Prague on Sunday. Last year's winner, one of a trio of British horses expected for the controversial four-and-a-quarter mile event (6.9 km), has the considerable advantage from the saddle of Richard Dunwoody, one of the world's most accomplished jump jockeys. The Pardubice, a unique test of man and horse, includes a series of demanding obstacles and has been compared to the Grand National at Aintree, a race Dunwoody has won twice. Race organisers have made the course easier in recent years, including modifying the daunting Taxis jump with its tough, high, wide fence and deep ditch. This and various other changes among the other 30 jumps followed massive protests and the embarassing 1993 outcome when only one horse managed to finish. A total of 21 horses have died in the Pardubice over the years. Rounding out the trio of British challengers looking to win part of the 2.5 million crown ($92,000) purse are Irish Stamp and Veleda II. Irish Stamp, to be ridden by Norman Williamson, has a clear chance and is rated considerably higher in England than It's a Snip, although the latter's proven ability over the course will be a major factor. Of the others, Polish-trained Scater is also expected to make a bold show. Despite its long history, the Pardubice has only recently regained its former status. \"In the past everyone in Britain knew of the enormously difficult course but they didn't have much interest,\" said Nigel Miller, one of the organisers who has worked to bring the British contingent here. \"But this year, one of the biggest hits of the season is to come here for a two-day trip to one of the most historic races around.\"\n\n1\n\nThe Czech trade deficit jumped sharply in October, rising nearly 16 billion crowns, but analysts said they were not alarmed by the rise which is inline with their full year forecasts.

Fifth seed Todd Martin also had an easy time in his second round match, downing Italian Cristiano Caratti 6-4 6-1, while eighth seeded Czech Bohdan Ulihrach was not as fortunate, falling 6-4 6-2 to Davis Cup team mate Jiri Novak. A slightly tired-looking Becker, who won the CA Trophy in Vienna on Sunday, looked rusty at times, missing easy volleys. But his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes kept Fetterlein, ranked 129th in the world, permanently on the back foot. \"I have good days and bad days with my hand...it was sore in the match but I managed to fight through it and hopefully it will be alright tomorrow,\" said Becker who needed just over an hour to defeat his opponent. The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month, but recurring problems with the ligament he tore in a third round match at Wimbledon forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago. His return to form may be just enough to earn the 28-year-old a record 12th appearance at the ATP Tour Championships at the end of the year. Becker currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded second in Ostrava, by only 46 points for the eighth and final spot in Hanover. Martin, ranked 11th in the world, also had little trouble disposing of Caratti, needing just 49 minutes for his straight sets win. For Ulihrach, meeting a Davis Cup team mate for the second consecutive day proved too much, as he put up little resistance to Novak. The previous day Ulihrach beat Daniel Vacek, ranked one spot below him at 36th, but could not recapture the service return which propelled him into the second round against Novak, ranked 40th.\n\n1\n\nWimbledon champion and fourth seed Richard Krajicek crashed out of the first round of the Czech Indoor Open on Tuesday, losing 6-4 6-3 to Germany's David Prinosil. Second seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa also had a rough ride but eventually overcame Italy's Renzo Furlan 7-5 4-6 6-3 while sixth seed Michael Stich of Germany cruised past Australian Sandon Stolle 7-6 6-2. Krajicek, whose parents emigrated from then Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands when he was a child, struggled to bring his booming serve under control from the outset, failing to mount a sustained attack against Prinosil, ranked number 58 in the world. \"I'm not very happy with the way I played, and David returned my serve very well, and my second serve was off,\" said Krajicek who served up only seven aces and six double faults. Former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich found the going much easier, taking a close first set before overpowering world number 71 Stolle in the second set. After crashing out of the first round in each of his last two tournaments, world number seven Ferreira looked shaky at times, committing a rash of unforced errors that left the match even after two sets. But another early exit for the South African would have seriously jeopardised his chances of qualifying for the ATP Tour World Championship in Hanover, Germany at the end of the year. \"It's always a tough match against Renzo, he has a game that is suited well against mine,\" said Ferreira, who currently holds the eighth and final spot for Hanover with Boris Becker, scheduled to play in Ostrava on Wednesday, just 46 points behind. Fifth seed Todd Martin easily disposed of Slovakia's Jan Kroslak 6-3 6-4 and eighth seed Bohdan Ulihrach fought back in the last set to defeat his Czech Davis Cup team mate Daniel Vacek 6-2 3-6 7-5.\n\n1\n\nGermany's David Prinosil, in a homecoming of sorts, overwhelmed Czech Petr Korda 6-1 6-2 in the final of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open on Sunday. The 23-year-old German, who was born near here in Olomouc and emigrated to Germany when he was 14, took control of the match from the beginning, keeping Korda off balance with his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes. As was the case all week, Prinosil used his deft return of service as an offensive weapon, seizing on both break points he had to take the first set in just 22 minutes. It was more of the same in the second set, with world number 49 Korda taking more chances, but failing to unsettle the German, who was playing in only his second final on the tour after he won in Newport last year. Korda was on the verge of breaking Prinosil in the fourth game, but the world number 58 blasted four straight service winners to take the game, and then ripped two crosscourt forehands to break in the fifth and seventh games in a match that lasted just 50 minutes. \"If someone told me I wouldn't lose a set all week, I would have said they were crazy. I don't think I have ever played this well,\" said Prinosil, who enjoyed straight set victories over Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, American Todd Martin and Briton Tim Henman on his way to the final and a prize of $64,000. Korda said: \"I was a little drained from yesterday's match and he hit the ball well. The points were short, which gave me little chance to take control of the match.\" Korda needed two hours late on Saturday to defeat Davis Cup team mate Martin Damm in three sets while Prinosil beat Henman in just 56 minutes.\n\n1\n\nThe party of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took a solid lead in Senate election run-offs on Saturday, but turnout was dismal despite an appeal to vote from President Vaclav Havel. With almost half the 81 constituencies declared, Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) had won 19 seats in the new upper house, ahead of the opposition Social Democrats with eight. The Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's centre-right coalition, put in a strong perfomance to take seven while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) won two. Turnout was just 30.5 percent, lower even than the 35 percent recorded in the first round of the Senate polls on November 15 and 16, the Central Election Commission said. Before the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house. The Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus's coalition, which lost its lower house majority in elections six months ago. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance. Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, an ODS member, forecast that the government parties would take control of the Senate. \"It is clear that the coalition is leading at the moment and I think they still will be after the final results are out,\" Kocarnik told reporters, predicting that the ODS would win between 33 and 40 seats. Analysts had forecast that voter apathy would benefit the ODS which is well-organised and well-funded by big business. Its supporters, largely more affluent Czechs who have benefited from Klaus's free market reforms since the 1989 fall of communism, have been galvanised by the coalition's loss of its majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies in June. Klaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the little-reformed communists to turn back the clock on reform. Scepticism is widespread among Czechs and Klaus himself has questioned the need for the Senate, which was written into the Czech Republic's new constitution when Czechoslovakia split at the end of 1992, but is only now being elected. The Social Democrats have said they would scrap the Senate if they ever achieved the three-fifths majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies needed to change the constitution. Klaus toned down his scepticism as voting neared but only Havel has appeared enthusiastic about the idea. Before the run-offs -- for the top two first round candidates in constituencies where no one won more than half the vote -- Havel appealed to citizens to turn out in much greater numbers for the sake of the Senate's legitimacy. -- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003\n\n1\n\nThe Prague Stock Exchange on Tuesday, buoyed by financial sector share gains, continued to rebounds from its recent slump, closing higher for the third consecutive session. Komercni Banka, IPB, Ceska Sporitelna and Zivnostenska Banka all gained ground as the PX50 index edged up 2.5 points, or 0.47 percent, to 537.1. The Reuters RPIX index, measuring the seven continuously- traded equity issues on the bourse, climbed five points to 1,095. Overall, 188 shares rose on the day, while 121 lost and 74 held steady. Total volume was 701,356 shares on turnover of 721.14 million crowns. For IPB, which rose 15 crowns to 331, it was the second consecutive five percent gain, the maximum allowed by the bourse in a session, after the government said it would be the first of the big four banks to undergo privatisation. On Friday, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik gave investors the signal they had been looking for when he said that a strong foreign strategic partner would be the most likely beneficiary of any sell off. Since the announcement, Nomura and ING Bank have been rumoured as the frontrunners in any bid to participate in the selloff. The government holds about a 30 percent stake in IPB. \"If you were to bring in a foreign partner such as the caliber of the two banks mentioned, that addresses questions that have been hovering around IPB on its perceived lack of corporate structure and transparency,\" said Jay King of Wood and Company. The bank has been widely-criticsed for being the least transparent of the four major Czech banks in its dealings, especially a recent spending spree that has seen it quietly buy large stakes in several firms. Several utilities also fared well at the fixing, with Stredoceska Energetika, Prazska Teplarenska, Severomoravksa Energetika, Jihomoravska Energetika and Elektrarny Opatovice all rising.\n\n1\n\nA Czech central bank scheme to buy doubtful debts of smaller banks and restore stability to the banking sector has attracted interest from about 10 banks, the Czech news agency reported on Wednesday. CTK, quoting central bank spokesman Martin Svehla, said that of the 13 banks allowed to participate in the plan, the number that had expressed an interest in joining \"is nearing 10\". Central bank officials were not immediately available for comment. The Czech National Bank (CNB) outlined the programme in mid-October followed the failure of Kreditni Banka in August -- the 11th bank in which the CNB had intervened -- and the politicisation of the case which had undermined confidence especially in small banks. Under the plan, participating banks must follow strict conditions and allow the central bank to make management changes where needed. CNB officials said the programme was not aimed at resolving a problem at any one bank. The plan will be open to all small private banks with total paid-in capital of 12.5 billion crowns ($458.5 million) and total assets of not more than 30 billion crowns. The state-run Konsolidacni Banka would buy the banks' doubtful assets at face value. The banks will be required to buy back the assets after around five to seven years, again priced at their nominal value, minus credits recovered by Konsolidacni from the debtors in the meantime. Banks seeking to participate will be held to strict requirements which include sticking to a three-year stabilisation plan and an agreement to attain an eight percent capital adequacy ratio. Banks also must maintain cost controls, profitability and liquidity as well as agreeing to frequent reviews by the central bank. The maximum purchase of debt by Konsolidacni can total up to 110 percent of a single bank's paid-in capital, meaning a maximum exposure for the state of 13.7 billion crowns in total if all eligible banks participated. The programme is voluntary based on a contract with the CNB, and the central bank said it would not reveal which banks elected to participate. Banks eligible include Ekoagrobanka, Union Banka, Evrobanka, Prvni Mestska Banka, COOP Banka, Pragobanka, Plzenska Banka, Foresbank, Bankovni Dum Skala, Moravia Banka, Universal Banka, Zemska Banka, and Banka Hana. Money for the scheme is to come primarily from state- controlled Konsolidacni Banka and if necessary from the CNB itself. A newly created unit of Konsolidacni, Ceska Financni s.r.o., will administer the programme. Any losses from the programme are to be covered by the National Property Fund (NPF), the state privatisation agency. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n\n1\n\nBoris Becker withdrew from the Czech Indoor Open on Thursday because of a recurring wrist injury, while top seed Goran Ivanisevic crashed out to Czech Petr Korda 7-6 6-2. Becker, who tore a ligament in his right wrist at the Wimbledon championships this year, was in pain after training and dropped out of his scheduled second round match against Czech Martin Damm. \"Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening,\" ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw said. On Wednesday Becker had held his wrist several times during his 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein. The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month but the injury forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago. Becker's absence has set back his bid for a record 12th appearance at the season-ending ATP Tour championship. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira for the eighth and final spot. Ivanisevic, who has already qualified for the tour finale, lives and dies by the serve. But he was outgunned by Korda who served 10 aces and only one double fault, while Ivanisevic managed only nine aces along with five double faults. \"He surprised me the way he played, he served well and returned very well. I double-faulted at 5-5 in the tie break which hurt,\" said Ivanisevic. \"I didn't return well, I didn't take any chances on his second serve. I didn't know whether to stay back or come in and when you're not sure what to do then it's no good.\" Second seed Ferreira scraped through to the quarter-finals with a 7-6 5-7 7-5 victory over Dutch qualifier Joost Winnink. Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, was stretched to the limit by Winnink. Their absorbing baseline battle ended in the 12th game of the deciding set when Winnink's backhand let him down on three successive occasions.\n\n1\n\nThe Czech September trade deficit should hold steady at around 14 billion crowns after a 14.7 billion crown monthly deficit in August, a Reuters poll of Czech economists showed on Wednesday. Czech trade figures for the first nine months are scheduled to be released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) at 0900 local time (0700 GMT) on Thursday. Most economists surveyed said they expect steady growth in the deficit and few surprises. \"It's still too early to talk about a period of stabilisation in the deficit, I think that will come in 1997 when imports level off and exports strengthen,\" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings told Reuters. Whatever the deficit in September, the nine-month trade gap is sure to be a record, after the January-August figure reached 100.9 billion crowns, more than all of the 1995's total shortfall of 95.7 billion crowns. The January-September 1995 trade deficit was 62.3 billion crowns. Most analysts agreed a 13-15 September gap would be in-line with prevailing trends, and on target for the estimated deficit of 150-160 billion crowns. The foreign exchange and money markets are expected to show little reaction over the figures, as long as they do not vary greatly from the estimates. Analysts say the trade balance has been hurt by a downturn in the economies of western Europe earlier in the year, and a the effects of a recovery of demand in western Europe have yet to make an impact. CSU figures show import growth was exceeding export growth by about 15 percent versus just over two percent over the last three months. The government and central bank, however, has repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to boost exports. Analysts point to mid-1997 as a crucial time in which the import wave -- which is aimed at modernising industries -- must show results in productivity growth and competitiveness. Economists said the deficit could be financed this year, but might pose problems in the second half of 1997. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003\n\n1\n\nSecond seed Wayne Ferreira and fifth seed Todd Martin both went down to straight set defeats in the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open quarterfinals on Friday. In the day's opening match, Ferreira lost 6-4 6-3 to Britain's Tim Henman, seeded seventh in the tournament, while Martin was edged out by Germany's David Prinosil 7-6 7-6. Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, never looked comfortable against Henman, who was the aggressor for most of the match. The 22 year-old Brit avenged his loss to Ferreira in the round of 16 in Toronto earlier this year, and said he took notes from that match onto the court on Friday. Henman managed to break Ferreira late in both sets, while the South African failed to gain a single break point in the macth. \"In Toronto Ferreira was dictating the points, serving very well and hitting forehands very well so today I tried to be very aggressive and when I had an opportunity, move forward,\" said Henman, ranked 26th in the world. For Martin, the loss was especially painful since he could have gained valuable ground on Ferreira in the race for the final spot at the ATP Tour Championships in Hannover at the end of the season. The American currently sits 199 points behind the South African, and a semifinal berth would have eaten 37 points out of the lead, while a place in the finals would have cut Ferreira's advantage by almost half. Prinosil, ranked 58th in the world, took advantage of a Martin double fault at 5-5 in the first set tiebreak, and then jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the second set tiebreak, a hole the American could not pull himself out of. \"I realise I didn't help my cause by at all, but we've got two of the biggest tournaments coming up and I think whoever does really well in those events should probably play themselves into a position at Hannover,\" Martin said. Martin was helped this week by Boris Becker's recurring wrist injury which forced him out of the Ostrava tournament after the first round. All three players will compete next week at Stutgart, where the winner will receive 370 tour points, more than double the 170 points to be awarded to the winner at Ostrava.\n\n1\n\nThird seed Boris Becker on Thursday withdrew from the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open due to a recurring injury to his right wrist. Becker, who tore a ligament in the wrist during a third round match at this year's Wimbledon, trained on Thursday morning, but afterward complained of pain in his wrist. He later told ATP officials that he would not play his second round match against Czech Martin Damm later on Thursday. \"Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening,\" ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw told Reuters. He did not elaborate. On Wednesday evening, Becker cruised to an easy 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein. During the match he held his wrist several times, and appeared to be favouring it again at practice on Thursday morning. Becker immediately left the training court for his hotel. He was not available for comment \"I have good days and bad days with my hand...it was sore in the match but I managed to fight through it and hopefully it will be alright tomorrow,\" Becker said after the match on Wednesday. The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month, but recurring problems with the wrist forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago. Becker's withdrawal puts a serious dent in the 28 year old's plans to qualify for a record 12th appearance at the ATP Tour Championships at the end of the year. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded second in Ostrava, by only 46 points for the eighth and final spot in Hannover. It also comes as a blow to tournament organisers. Though he was only ranked third in the tournament behind top seed Goran Ivanisevic and Ferreira, it was clear most of the tickets sold were by fans hoping to catch a glimpse of the German. Barely 1,000 fans came out to watch Ivanisevic's first round match against world number 42 Adrian Voinea. In contrast, a tournament record crowd of some 10,000 watched Becker defeat the Fetterlien, ranked 156 in the world.\n\n1\n\nInvestors, fed up with a lack of transparency and the poor performance of the Czech equity market, are turning to the country's less opaque debt market, buoyed by favourable interest rates and economic data. The Prague bourse has been caught in a downward spiral -- the official PX50 index has lost almost 18 percent in the past two months -- that analysts say won't end before the New Year. But while bears maul the equities market, they say bulls are quietly finding greener pastures in Czech debt. \"The bond market is pretty bullish and the outlook is good. Rates have been tending down and people are positive especially in the longer maturities which are looking more attractive,\" said Michael Gartner, a debt analyst at ING Capital Markets. Estimated daily bond turnover has grown to 900 million to one billion crowns, equal to turnover on the Prague stock exchange, from 500 million a year ago. \"The bond market is becoming even more important for foreign investors because they can get reasonable prices,\" said Alojz Lacko, a bond trader at Patria Finance. Reasonable prices are something investors, foreign and domestic, have long complained they cannot find on the equities market where insufficient legislation has pushed an estimated 70 percent of trading into murky off-market dealing, and trampled minority shareholder rights. Many strategic and speculative investors have taken advantage of the opaque system to buy up large stakes in firms without prices or counter-parties being made public until long after the deal has been made. Bourse and Finance Ministry officials have stepped up their campaign in recent months to assure investors tighter, more stringent rules for trading will be introduced. But analysts say the moves appear to be too little, too late for investors who are turning away from Czech equities. \"Investors are really put off by the (trading) practices here and frankly, it will be hard to lure some back. But we don't have these problems in the debt market, and a lot are turning their attentions there,\" said one local trader. ING's Gartner said investor motivation for entering the debt market is in many ways different from equity investments. Investor fears of having the carpet pulled out from under them by an off-market takeover deal are non-existent. \"The bond market is completely transparent because prices are transparent. It's a good market: it works, it's liquid, foreign investors, domestic investors, pension funds, investment funds all participate on an even field,\" he said. A recent spate of positive economic indicators has further buoyed the market. Inflation, one of the lowest in the region, eased further in October with the year-on-year rate standing at 8.7 percent. The central bank's war on a burgeoning money supply has also borne fruit recently, with the expansion of the key M2 year-on-year rate falling to 13.2 percent at the end of August, just below its 14-17 percent target. Although investor sentiment has traditionally been bearish on East European bonds because of currency risks, high taxation and political and economic instability, analysts say these factors are less significant in the Czech Republic. While rates may be higher in neghbouring Poland and Hungary, the markets are very illiquid, especially in local currency corporate issues. But with the strength and stability of the crown the Czech market is attractive because an investor can add a play on the local currency, and have little fear of currency risk since it is tied closely to the mark. Traders say the government has also helped by easing currency exchange laws to help foreign investors repatriate their holdings. Foreigners may repatriate interest income on bonds as well as income from selling or redeeming them. -- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003\n\n1\n\nMarkets across Eastern Europe remained mired in an autumn slump this week, with analysts seeing little on the horizon to break the bearish trend. Stock exchanges in Bratislava, Bucharest, and Zagreb all lost ground on the week, while Prague and Warsaw held steady. Budapest and Ljubljana bucked the trend, rising slightly, although it appeared neither would see a sustained upturn in the near future. PRAGUE Not even a strong showing by the centre-right governing coalition in Senate elections at the weekend could break the Prague Stock Exchange out of its current malaise, as the PX50 index inched up 0.3 points on the week to close at 510.4. Analysts said that while the coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus may feel heartened by the showing which gave him a majority to the Czech upper house, which will have little power, investors remain put off by poor market regulation. \"I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring changes to the market,\" said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka. \"I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic.\" Investors have long complained that market regulation and legislation in the Czech Republic is weak, providing little protection for minority shareholders. WARSAW The Warsaw Stock Exchange stayed virtually flat this week and analysts said it could extend its three-and-a-half-week horizontal trend next week as no fresh signals were in sight. \"We are still in a horizontal trend and...I see no factors which could help create a clear direction for the market,\" said Mateusz Andrzejewski, an"
