But now, he claims, the company is \"safe from the turmoil\" it was in back then. And after having spent more than $70 million on legal and other professional fees, Revco is ready to emerge from Chapter 11.\n\nThe chances are, Sells says, that, after the ongoing creditor vote and a January 8 confirmation hearing, Revco will emerge as an independent company with the current management intact. At the same time, he isn't counting on the Revco-backed reorganization plan sailing through this final stage.\n\nNo evidence of erosion\n\nAccording to the chairman, the plan has \"a pretty good probability\" of receiving creditor approval--if only because it was proposed by a group representing the bulk of Revco's debt. And there has been no evidence of erosion of support for the plan. However, Sells admits to the \"likelihood\" that more than one plan (as is possible under bankruptcy rules) will win approval.\n\nThat would leave it up to the judge, in the confirmation stage, to choose the fairest and most workable plan. \"At that stage, in a room that has 50 lawyers,\" says Sells, \"most anything could happen.\"\n\nAttorneys could battle at length over the confirmability of any plan. \"This is the bottomless pit of legal machinations,\" Sells says.\n\nWorking under Chapter 11 has been debilitating for the company. The many rumors circulated during the past few years about Revco's fate have been tough on employees. Moreover, in many practical ways bankruptcy has limited sales and business opportunities.\n\nFor one thing, the proceedings have impacted hiring. \"It's been difficult, because we have had no long-term incentive plans of any kind to offer people,\" says Sells.\n\nIn addition, Revco has missed out on desirable store sites, because shopping center developers seeking financing cannot rely on tenancy commitments from companies that have filed under Chapter 11.\n\nSimilarly, third-party arrangements have been harder to come by. \"Our third-party sales rose by 30% last year,\" says Sells. \"But I don't know what they'd be if it weren't for the fact that we have had to fight this Chapter 11 problem. It's just astounding that the company is doing as well as it is. It's a tribute to our employees that, no matter what, they hang in there and do it.\"\n\nThose Revco rivals bidding to take over the company, of course, offer a different assessment.\n\nRite Aid Corp., in a recent full-length newspaper advertisement addressed to Revco creditors, cites net losses of $519.8 million suffered by Revco in the past four years. The current management, the ad reads, \"has consistently failed to meet its own projections, even while running the company under the protection of the bankruptcy laws.\"\n\nSells notes that a sizable portion of Revco's net losses suffered since bankruptcy relates to a onetime provision for the company's downsizing in fiscal 1990.\n\nHe also argues that in terms of income from actual store operations the company is approximating its projections. Income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and other charges totaled $148.4 million over the past two-and-one-half years on a FIFO basis, he says, which compares favorably with a projected total of $155.2 million. Moreover, he claims that Revco's sales performance currently leads the industry on a comparable-store basis.\n\nIn Sells' judgment, the firm's current business trends are sufficient to sustain the main creditors' reorganization plan.\n\nAssuming that that particular plan prevails, Sells does not foresee any significant change in Revco's management or business direction. The new creditor/owners will appoint new board members. \"But, I don't expect them to have a different point of view about the company from what we have seen so far,\" says Sells. \"They have shown Revco pretty good cooperation.\"\n\nUnder Sells' continuing leadership, Revco would keep to its current 10-state marketing area. \"We'll still have modest new store development,\" he adds, \"and there will be strong remodeling and relocation.\"\n\nNo additional store closures are planned. Within the framework of Chapter 11 a company can break store leases with a minimal penalty. \"So we'd be crazy to reject leases anytime but now,\" says Sells.\n\nDuring the Chapter 11 proceedings Revco has spent nearly $100 million on capital improvements, including increased automation of store and pharmacy operations. The investment has already paid off in helping the company weather on-going personnel turnover.\n\nSells declines to comment on the bids by Rite Aid and Jack Eckerd Corp., other than to describe them as attempts at \"hostile takeovers.\"\n\nDuring an earlier court hearing Sells accused Rite Aid personnel of intruding into Revco's daily operations in connection with the reorganization fight. Revco attorneys also leveled charges that the rival chains, using their buying clout, were trying unduly to influence the votes of various trade creditors.\n\nSells notes that the state of Ohio had issued civil investigation demands to Revco relating to the antitrust implications of a rival takeover of the 1,150-store chain. Antitrust action could conceivably block or at least delay the acquisition of Revco by one of its rivals.\n\nArticle Details Title Annotation:Boake Sells, chairman and chief executive officer of Revco D.S.
