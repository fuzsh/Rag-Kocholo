        "text": "Highest Quality Precision Balancing At A Fair Price\n\nRevco Precision is proud of the reputation they have earned as being the best in the business, always giving fast service, all at a reputable price to the customer.\n\nWhen Larry Revis founded Revco Precision in the fall of 2006, he brought to the company 35 years of expertise in the balancing and vibration analysis fields. Frustrated with businesses that worry only about the bottom line and charging outrageous prices, he made it his goal to open a small shop offering the highest quality of work, and fast service, at a fair price.\n\nRevco concentrates on balancing services, vibration analysis, and specialty machine work, all related to the internal components of engines and machines. They donât machine blocks, heads, build engines, or sell large volumes of parts. Because of their experience, large supply of specialty tooling and specific built machines, they can perform most jobs in a fraction of the time it takes most âdo it allâ shops. This translates into savings for the customer.\n\nOwner, Larry Revis, will tell you that itâs the weekend racer who is the heart of their business, yet their list of customers over the years reads like a âWhoâs Whoâ of racing, including American, Asian and European auto makers, and professional race teams from Motorcross, Nascar and Top Fuel."
