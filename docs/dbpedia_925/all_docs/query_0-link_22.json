HSI stores operate variously under the names Hook's, SupeRx and Brooks.\n\nRevco and HSI combined, operate 2,371 stores and achieved sales of $4.7 billion duringr the past twelve months. The acquisition will make Revco the second largest drugstore chain in the nation.\n\n'HSI is an excellent fit for Revco, and we look forward to welcoming their employees and customers,' said D. Dwayne Hoven, president of Revco. 'This strategic acquisition enhances our position in the market, strengthens our capabilities in third-party marketing, and helps further position us for health care reform. It will also provide an expanded mail-order business and enhanced benefits-management capabilities.\n\n'Revco's strategy has been to increase market penetration by adding stores in the nine contiguous states in which we operate,' Hoven said.
