        "text": "On December 2, 2016, a Texas federal court ruled that the insurer for the predecessor of CVS Caremark Corp., Revco D.S. Inc. (Revco), must pay $15 million toward a $100 million settlement of a class action lawsuit for the injuries and deaths allegedly caused by a toxic vitamin solution, E-Ferol. Pursuant to the settlement, the plaintiffs received an assignment of Revco’s rights to pursue indemnity insurance coverage from the company’s excess insurer, Federal Insurance Co. (Federal). The Court granted, in part, the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment seeking indemnity, by declaring that Revco’s excess insurance policy covered the negligence claims based on its manufacturing and distributing of E-Ferol."
