        "text": "Allan Stoekl\n\nDepartments of French\n\nand Comparative Literature\n\nPennsylvania State University\n\nThe postmodern moment has been characterized as one of the loss of legitimacy of the master narratives–social, historical, political; Hegelian, Marxist, Fascist–by which lives were ordered and sacrificed throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 1\n\nThe demise of the great story, which gave direction and purpose to struggle and violence, has opened a space for a proliferation of conflicting modes of interpreting and speaking. Of course those modes can only be partial: they can never aspire to the horrifying totalization promoted by overarching certainties. And they will likely interfere with each other, cross over, meld and (self) contradict, because the possibility of their autonomy has been given up; at best we can say that they are “language games” now, rules for representation, argument, and analysis; no longer are they the ground of teleology, satisfaction, and self-certainty.\n\nBut there is a problem with this kind of argument, as I see it. It’s not that I do not find it “true,” because of some kind of empirical counter-evidence, such as: the old nationalist narratives still hold sway; history is still slouching toward a goal; history isn’t slouching toward a goal, but it is nevertheless still slouching, etc. One can probably develop all sorts of arguments based on empirical observation concerning the postmodern. Or one can just as easily “deconstruct” the master stories from within, by taking them apart while still, necessarily, acting in full complicity with them (for what “space” could be said to open beyond their margins?). The problem, as I see it, is that this kind of argument is closely tied to the “end of history” arguments that were current in the immediate postwar period, and that have recently had a renewed but highly contested efflorescence. 2 This is of course immensely ironic, because philosophers such as Lyotard–spokespersons of the postmodern–have informed us that the possibility of a larger teleology is lost for good, along with the knowledge that flowed from it. But there still is a larger knowledge, after all–the one that proclaims the death of the possibility of a larger knowledge. Whether arrived at empirically or logically, this awareness comes at the end of a series of historical actions and tragedies, and the certainty associated with it is no doubt due to lessons derived from those failures. This history will still have the form of a narrative, albeit one that lacks, perhaps, the power of retrospective justification that characterized the Hegelian model. Its lessons might be purely practical, or they might be derived from a study of the incoherences or contradictions of the earlier paradigms. The net result, whatever the means of their determination, development and (self) cancelling, will be a generally valid knowledge that mandates the end of generally valid knowledges. The language games that proliferate, then, in a postmodern epoch will be allowed and encouraged to do so only because the way has been opened by yet another master narrative: the narrative of the end of narratives. The freedom to be enjoyed by the games is the result of the master story’s knowledge–but, to be sure, the games’ actions, their orientations, will not be determined by it. They will be independent of it–but the preservation of their semi-autonomous functioning is nevertheless the goal of a postmodern theoretical project (such as one that affirms adjudication between different, conflicting, games). Further, it is their guarantee that they will participate in a stable postmodern order: without the postmodern narrative and its powers of harmonization, they would risk falling into particularist discourses into which “nationalist” ideologies are prone.\n\nIs this postmodern version of things that different from a theory of the “end of history” that envisages a State founded on the mutual recognition of free subjects? On the surface, yes: the postmodern view concerns itself not with subjectivity, consciousness as productive labor, and the like, but on the recognition of difference between partial discourses and “constructed” cultures. The posthistorical model seems almost quaint with its emphasis on codified law and the State as guarantor of a freedom identifiable with labor and construction. But beyond these evident differences there may be a more fundamental similarity.\n\nJust as the postmodern presents language games as independent of transcendent social reason, so too the posthistorical imagines the moment of the ultimate end of history as a kind of definitive break, after which life will go on, but in which unidirectional history will be supplanted by “playful” activities that may be enjoyable in themselves, but that will by necessity not be recuperable in any larger social or historical scheme. The State at the end of history will be as unconcerned with these ludic activities–sports, arts, love making, and so on–as the postmodern regime will be with justifying the logic of the language games of what we would call the cultures, subcultures, and micro-cultures whose disputes would be subject to its acts of arbitration. 3\n\nOn the surface of it at least, Alexandre Kojève’s take on Hegel in his Introduction to the Reading of Hegel can be seen as being not an attempt at the ultimate vindication of a “grand” historical and philosophical narrative–the triumph of the end of history and the univocal (self) satisfaction of the entire population of the earth–but instead the surprising mutation of that certainty, that knowledge, into a postmodern generation of discourses and styles. 4 History as narrative triumphs, but it also ends: its termination is the opening for the proliferation of poses and play that is literally post modern. Rather than contradicting Kojève, then, or demonstrating the extent to which a Hegelian modernism is null and void, a rigorous postmodern might see itself as deriving from a completion and fulfillment of a dialectical project. It might.\n\nThe postmodern, we could argue, has already come part of the way. It has posited a knowledge–the authority of its own text–that in spite of itself stands as a knowledge at the end of a long history of illusions. It takes itself as a stranger to, and grave digger for, the Hegelian tradition. Kojève, on the other hand, at least recognizes the inescapability, the inevitability, of the univocal truth of his own system. But he is blind to the consequences of the termination of history: the proliferation of signs and acts that, by their very nature as partial constructions, challenge the totalizing power of the Concept.\n\nTo get any further we will have to look at certain key passages of Kojève’s Introduction. Most often in footnotes and asides, he grapples with the really crucial questions: what does it mean for “Man” to “die”? What will come “after” the end of history? If “Man” is dead, what will remain of human labor? What will be the status of the “Book” in which Knowledge resides? The answers to these questions will enable us to consider in more detail the problem of the relation been posthistory and the postmodern.\n\nAccording to most historians of French philosophy of the twentieth century, it was Kojève who single-handedly popularized Hegel in France, through a brilliant series of lectures in the 1930s. After decades of idealist neo-Kantianism, the Hegel that Kojève preferred was a welcome change: History could now be seen as a dialectical progression in which Man ineluctably moves toward a social satisfaction in which the desire for recognition–and the recognition of the other’s desire for recognition–is fulfilled. The posthistorical State alone is capable of recognizing Man for what he is: beyond all superstition, all theology, Man is the creative/destructive agent whose labor ends in the recognition of all by all through the mediation of the State. The labor of Hegel’s slave, its destructive and formative action, “transforms” “natural given being”: Man is the “Time that annihilates [nature]” (158). But in the end all transformative labor ceases. History comes to an end because, eventually at least, the labor leading to full reciprocal recognition will have been carried out: at the end of history, there will be nothing new to accomplish.\n\nNow the end of history for Kojève is the ultimate ideological weapon because it justifies, retrospectively, just about anything that went before that made its arrival possible. Man for Kojève is a type: the Master, the Slave, the Philosopher, and, at the end, the impersonal Hegel (and his reader, Kojève), that is, the Wise Man (le Sage). The negativity that made the arrival of the end possible will, in retrospect, be judged moral, no matter how it seemed at the time. And since Man himself is defined as temporality and negation (IRH 160), even the bloodiest violence or the grossest injustice, if necessary for the eventual completion, will be (or will have been) good.\n\nThe true moral judgments are those borne by the State (moral=legal); States themselves are judged by universal history. But for these judgments to have a meaning, History must be completed. And Napoleon and Hegel end history. That is why Hegel can judge States and individuals. The “good” is everything that has made possible Hegel, in other words the formation of the universal Napoleonic Empire (it is 1807!) which is “understood” by Hegel (in and through the Phenomenology).\n\nWhat is good is what exists, the extent that it exists. All action, since it negates existing givens, is thus bad: a sin. But sin can be pardoned. How? Through its success. Success absolves crime, because success–is a new reality that exists. But how to judge success? For that, History has to be completed. Then one can see what is maintained in existence: definitive reality. (ILH, 95)\n\nThis is the “ruse of reason”: reason acting in and through History reaches its end in ways that might seem to have nothing to do with accepted (“Christian”) morality. Certainly anyone attempting to judge the morality or immorality of events before the end of history will be incapable of it; only with Hegel (and Kojève) will the true value and morality of actions be evident. Not only do the ends always justify the means, but they do so retroactively, so that agents (“people”) will never be competent to judge the acceptability of their own behavior. The “Owl of Minerva flies at dusk,” to use a Hegelian formulation: only when the outcome is final and its corresponding overview are grasped can all preceding events be fully known. 5\n\nBut in a way all this is irrelevant: since history for Kojève is already ended, everything that takes place now is a purely technical “catching up” process. The end of History was achieved at the battle of Jena: Napoleon’s conquering forces brought the egalitarian ideals of the French revolution, codified and implemented by the State, to others. From now on History will only be a series of lesser battles of Jena, leading to the implementation throughout the world, by bureaucratic governments, of rights and liberties. What at first might seem to be the ultimate 1930s justification of ruthlessness at any cost (indeed Stalin comes to replace Napoleon for Kojève in the pre-World War II period) leads inevitably, in the late 40s and 50s, to a recognition that the difference between ideologies is largely irrelevant. How one arrives at the “classless” society, the society of the mutual recognition of the desire for recognition, is of no interest to the “Wise Man”: it is a purely technical question. The seemingly great postwar problem of the conflict of ideologies, or the question of the defense of Soviet ideology in the face of American pressure (Merleau-Ponty, Humanisme et terreur, Sartre, Les Communistes et la paix) simply does not exist for Kojève. The end of history is the end of ideology. In a “Note to the Second Edition” of the Introduction to the Reading of Hegel, inserted in 1959, Kojève states: “One can even say that, from a certain point of view, the United States has already attained the final stage of Marxist “communism,” seeing that, practically, all the members of the “classless society” can from now on appropriate for themselves everything that seems good to them, without thereby working any more than their heart dictates” (IRH, 161, note).\n\nIdeology, in the end, is thus utterly unimportant: it too fades away once history is at an end. If it contributes or has contributed to that end it is good, if not bad. Like all means it is justified by the end, but at the end it has no specificity other than its “success.” From the perspective of the end, all bloody action is over: it can be judged, but it no longer is effective. In time and as time Man is free to act, but he does not know; at the end of Time, History is known, but Man can no longer act (he has nothing more to do)–hence he no longer even exists. At the end, there are no longer even any means to be justified. History and its ideologies are a matter of utter indifference.\n\nThis leaves an enormous question, one typical of the 1950s. The completion of history is perfectly ahistorical, but ahistory itself is a function of history. True, we are now delivered from history, action, and all the hard–and ambiguous–moral questions. The machine of history has functioned so well that it has erased itself: its mechanism was the unfolding of Truth, but now that we are in the definitive era of Truth, History has ceased to exist, and its moral conundrums are irrelevant. At the end of history, ideology is finished, and so ceases to exist: but “Man” therefore no longer exists either.\n\nThe Selbst–that is, Man properly so-called or the free Individual, is Time and Time is History, and only History. . . . And Man is essentially Negativity, for Time is Becoming–that is, the annihilation of Being or Space. Therefore Man is a Nothingness that nihilates and that preserves itself in (spatial) Being only by negating being, this Negation being Action Now, if Man is Negativity,–that is, Time–he is not eternal. He is born and he dies as Man. He is ‘das Negativ seiner selbst,’ Hegel says. And we know what that means: Man overcomes himself as Action (or Selbst) by ceasing to oppose himself to the World, after creating in it the universal and homogeneous State; or to put it otherwise, on the cognitive level: Man overcomes himself as Error (or “Subject” opposed to the Object) after creating the Truth of “Science” (IRH, 160; emphasis in original).\n\nMan dies at this strange juncture point between History and the End (in both senses of the word) of History. In the future, after the end, Kojève tells us that “life is purely biological” (ILH, 387). But this is a, and perhaps the, crucial question for Kojève: if history stops, if Man and Time and negating labor is dead, how then is Man any different from the animals? He had originally constituted himself against Nature (“But Man, once constituted in his human specificity, opposes himself to Nature”); nature for Kojève is timeless and can in no way be incorporated in the dialectic. No “dialectics of nature” can therefore be conceived within the Kojèvian reading of Hegel. 6 But if man is an animal, History itself is not so much completed as dead. It will be–or is now, since History is already ended, in principle at least–as if History had never existed.\n\nKojève presents two approaches to this problem in the long footnote to his interpretation of Chapter VIII of the Phenomenology (IRH, 158-62), a passage of which I have already cited. First he states that Man indeed is an animal, but a happy one, “in harmony with Nature or given Being.” True, he no longer can engage in productive Historical activity, “Action negating the given, . . . the Subject opposed to the Object.” But he has plenty of other consolations: “art, love, play, etc. etc.–in short, everything that makes man happy” (IRH, 159). This is a “world of freedom” in which men “no longer fight, and work as little as possible.”\n\nIt sounds almost too good to be true: the world itself is transformed into a vast, postmodern Southern California, its inhabitants concerned above all with training their bodies and trading their automobiles and art objects. It is here that one recognizes with a start the perfect transformation of a Hegelian modernism into an anti-Hegelian, but soft, postmodernism: at the End of History History is replaced with a heterogeneous collection of lifestyle choices. Indeed we learn, in the footnote added to the second edition of 1959, that Kojève had earlier (in the immediate postwar period, “1948-58”) seen the “American way of life” as the true posthistorical regime–although he also saw the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists as nothing other than “still poor Americans” (IRH, 161). The only larger coherence is a general lack of coherence: one is free to cultivate one’s own interests and ignore the larger movement by which all personal activities are justified. The new human animals will “recognize one another without reservation,” but this recognition will be of the right of each one to be completely different, in what promise to be mainly physical pursuits.\n\nIn a second footnote added in 1959 (the first dates from 1946), Kojève objects to his own theory. Reading his earlier note quite literally, he argues that if all Action is eliminated from Human life, Man will actually be not an American, but an animal:\n\n“If Man becomes an animal again, his acts, his loves, and his play must also become purely ‘natural’ again. Hence it would have to be admitted that after the end of History, men would construct their edifices and works of art as birds build their nests and spiders spin their webs. . . . ‘The definitive annihilation of Man properly so-called‘ also means the definitive disappearance of human Discourse (Logos) in the strict sense. Animals of the species Homo sapiens would react by conditioned reflexes to vocal signals or sign ‘language,’ and thus their so-called ‘discourses’ would be like what is supposed to be the ‘language’ of bees. What would disappear, then, is not only Philosophy or the search for discursive Wisdom, but also that Wisdom itself.” (IRH, 159-60; emphasis in original)\n\nThe posthistorical, in other words, must be saved from any threat of animality–that is, of purely unreflected-upon behavior. Kojève does not really consider the consequences of “art, love, play, etc. etc.” because, fortunately, he has another example of activity “after the end of History.” This is, surprisingly enough, Japan: the “American way of life” is now replaced by a model of Japanese culture that has been “at the End of History” “for almost three centuries.” While “American” posthistory is associated with sheer animality, Japanese culture is seen by Kojève as a pure formalism. Unlike the animal, Man continues to be a “Subject opposed to the Object,” although “action” and “Time” have ceased. Forms are opposed to one another, and values themselves come to be “totally formalized“–the Japanese tea ceremony, Noh theatre, even the suicide of the Kamikaze pilot represent an opposition to the Object that, while empty, nevertheless continues to be an opposition: Man is now a snob. It is as if the armature of labor, negation and Historical activity continues to function, but in a void, since there can no longer be any negating or any History.\n\nIn this model, “Opposition” continues, and so Man does too. The difference between the two versions (that of ’46 and that of ’59) lies in the fact that while the first proposes an activity that can be purely individual, so long as it is in accord with nature, the second, “Japanese,” entails a struggle for recognition, and therefore derives its power from the earlier, and decisive, Master-Slave dialectic. After all, the purpose of snobbery, of dandyism, is to be recognized by the Other, even if that recognition is totally meaningless. Thus a society is implied, and a culture; this was not the case, finally, for the “animals,” no matter what their “way of life” might have been.\n\nBut the larger posthistorical culture–if such a thing can even be written of–will be unthinkable because Absolute Knowing will play no part in it. Kojève inadvertently indicates the irrelevance of the Wise Man–of reflexive consciousness at the end of History–by choosing the example of the Japanese: if they were carrying out posthistorical acts one hundred years before the birth of Hegel, Hegel and his book, and Kojève in their wake, need never have existed. History culminates in perfect indifference to Wisdom. From the other side of the end of History, it now appears clear that the Phenomenology is perfectly pointless. Purely formal activities therefore will take place, and will have meanings, perhaps, within certain posthistorical cultures; those cultures, however, will exist in perfect isolation, without a larger Wisdom to unify them and give them meaning. Here, then, is yet another Kojèvian postmodernism, this time one based not on the particularity of desires but on the multiplicity and radical non-congruence of separate cultures. Absolute knowing finds its completion in a series of social practices or lifestyles which are united only in the fact that as formal activities each one is precisely a lack of knowledge of the whole. The snob’s gesture is a forgetting, willful or not, of the larger significance–or insignificance–of his or her act. Its success can be judged only by its immediate impact: the dandy walking his lobster on a leash can bask only in the recognition given here and now. The act excludes any larger “meaning.”\n\nHow then, under these circumstances, can one say that History is ended? It does not seem that, if the Japanese (as represented by Kojève) are to be our models, there can be any history or historical consciousness at all. Elsewhere–in passages and footnotes dating from the original (1947) publication of Introduction la lecture de Hegel–it seems that Kojève himself recognized the necessity of historical memory and historical text–and thus of the writing of the Phenomenology itself–for the ultimate completion of History. A few pages after the footnote that I have discussed, Kojève writes: “It is first necessary that real History be completed; next, it must be narrated to Man; and only then can the Philosopher, becoming a Wise Man, understand it by reconstructing it a priori in the Phenomenology” (IRH, 166). Kojève adds in a footnote appended to this passage (more precisely, to the phrase that ends “narrated to Man”): “Moreover, there is no real history without historical memory–that is, without oral or written Memoirs.”\n\nHere we are back at our earlier problem: if the Japanese constitute an ahistorical end of history, a posthistorical moment that has nothing to do with history, how can they be said to be Human? If Man is determined in and through history, then it would seem that the Japanese, in their sophisticated and useless labor, are no more Human than are the bee-like posthistorical animals that Kojève in 1959 saw as implicit in his earlier footnote (of 1946), and rejected. The Natural–the realm of the inhuman that, for Kojève at least, simply had nothing to do with Human activity, Time, or History–seems to triumph once again. In the case of the simple human-animals we might say that the Owl of Minerva flew, but that its flight seen from a posthistorical perspective was the equivalent of the movement of any other animal, the Owl of Minerva being no different from any owl–no matter how endangered–in the forest. For the Kojèvian Japanese, however, and for all the rest of us who will necessarily emulate them, the Owl of Minerva need never have flown in the first place. Perhaps it did, perhaps it didn’t; in any case it is now stuffed and resides in a European museum, where it is routinely photographed by hurried groups of Japanese tourists.\n\nWhat, finally, is the status of the Book–the Phenomenology itself as a summation of History and embodiment of Wisdom–at the end of History? This is perhaps the most important question in Kojève’s Hegelianism, and, characteristically, he never poses it explicitly; instead, we must try to formulate an answer on the basis of two elliptic and ironic footnotes. Yet, as we will see, the status of “Self-Consciousness” at and after the end of History will remain very much in question.\n\nThe first question, which arises in Kojève’s discussion of the third part of Chapter VIII of the Phenomenology, is the role of the Wise Man, the post-philosopher (or Sage), in the establishment of the posthistorical regime. At one point Kojève writes: “One can say . . . that, in and by the Wise Man (who produces absolute Science, the Science that entirely reveals the totality of Being), Spirit ‘attains or wins the Concept'” (ILH, 413). He soon modifies this, though, in a footnote (ILH, 414). If the Wise Man–Hegel, Kojève, the “authors” of the Phenomenology–are those who “produce” Science, the true end of History and reign of Self-Consciousness will be possible only when mediated by the State. The State, in effect, will guarantee the recognition of the freedom of all by all; the satisfaction it provides will do away with all opposition between Subject and Object, for-itself and in-itself. This clearly implies more than the personal teaching of a single person: rather what is at stake now is the universalization of a definitive doctrine contained in a book. Kojève writes:\n\nTo turn out to be true, philosophy must be universally recognized, in other words recognized finally by the universal and homogeneous State. The empirical-existence (Dasein) of Science–is thus not the private thought of the Wise Man, but his words [sa parole], universally recognized. And it is obvious that this “recognition” can only be obtained through the publication of a book. And by existing in the form of a book, Science is effectively detached from its author, in other words from the Wise Man or from Man [du Sage ou de l’Homme]. (ILH, 414)\n\nThis is a passage fraught with difficulties, but one that is well worth considering. It is recognition, first of all, that determines truth; the truth of the book is determined by its recognition by the State. The book consists of the words–or literally, the word–of the author, but the book itself, on publication, is detached not only from the Wise Man, but from Man himself. The detachment and recognition of the book is the determination of its truth–which in turn guarantees the universality and homogeneity of the State. The book is detached from Man himself; presumably at this point Man has nothing more to do, and passes from the scene (as we will see in yet another footnote, discussed below).\n\nBut note that the “private thought” of the Wise Man is not at stake here. Rather his words are recognized, and this makes them “true”; the same gesture by the State–recognition–makes it a State. Truth and Statehood are generated reciprocally, at the same instant, by the same act.\n\nNow if they are the result of the immediacy of what seems to be a purely formal act, Truth and Statehood cannot be generated out of reading. Kojève never explicitly poses the question, but it is in any case an obvious one: does anybody read this book? Who? Are recognition and reading the same thing? It does not seem likely: reading here does not appear as a social or even physical/psychological phenomenon: it is not a question of the appropriation of the Wise Man’s teaching, the reading of the book on the highest levels of government, its dissemination through the schools, etc. For that is an interminable process: reading necessarily implies interpretation, misinterpretation, questioning, rephrasing, codification. There is none of that here: in a single gesture, in one movement, the book and the State are “recognized.” Recognition, then, has nothing to do with reading–and by reading I mean, on the simplest level, a bare acquaintance with the contents of the book. The word will be “recognized,” it seems, without having to be deciphered.\n\nMy interpretation is borne out in another footnote that comes some twenty-five pages before the one I have just discussed. It explicitly links the death of Man to the book as inanimate, and presumably unread, object. Once again this note attempts to face the ultimate problem: the fate of Man “after” the closing of History:\n\nThe fact that at the end of Time the Word-concept (Logos) is detached from Man and exists–empirically no longer in the form of a human-reality, but as a Book–this fact reveals the essential finitude of Man. It’s not only a given man who dies: Man dies as such. The end of History is the death of Man properly speaking. There remains after this death: 1) living bodies with a human form, but deprived of Spirit, in other words of Time or creative power; 2) a Spirit which exists-empirically, but in the form of an inorganic reality, not living: as a Book which, not even having an animal life, no longer has anything to do with Time. The relation between the Wise Man and his Book is thus rigorously analogous to that of Man and his death. My death is certainly mine; it is not the death of an other. But it is mine only in the future; for one can say: “I am going to die,” but not: “I am dead.” It is the same for the Book. It is my work [mon oeuvre], and not that of an other; and in it it is a question of me and not of anything else. But I am only in the Book, I am only this Book to the extent that I write and publish it, in other words to the extent that it is still a future (or a project). Once the Book is published it is detached from me. It ceases to be me, just as my body ceases to be mine after my death. Death is just as impersonal and eternal, in other words inhuman, as Spirit is impersonal, eternal and inhuman when realized in and by the Book. (ILH, 387-88, footnote; Kojève’s emphasis)\n\nWe see now posthistorical Man as an “animal,” no longer carrying out a task or striving toward self-Consciousness. But “he” is not just an animal–a bee or beaver–because he has the word, the Logos, which guarantees his movement from the Human to a kind of higher-order animality. (This difference is something that Kojève seems to have forgotten when he wrote the 1959 addendum to his long footnote on “animality,” discussed above.) But clearly the Book is not something to be read: there can be no labor of interpretation or inculcation. For that reason the book is explicitly presented as dead, as “inorganic” (i.e., lifeless) material.\n\nThe death of Man is not, strictly speaking, the death of self-Consciousness. The latter is externalized, frozen on the pages of a book. The message is absolute: as Kojève states, “The Wise Man who reveals what is through the Word [Parole] or Concept reveals it definitively: for what is thus remains eternally identical to itself, no longer modified by uneasiness [inquietude] (Unruhe)” (ILH, 413). The dead message, moreover, is a dead me (or a dead Man), because it is the highest Wisdom of me (the Wise Man, Hegel, Kojève), preserved intact forever, apparently well beyond the labor of interpretation. The connection between the Book and “my death” is, then, not merely a metaphor: it is both “me” in the sense that it consists of my remains, and at the same time it is not me, or my living project. It is my dead body. And the dead bodies of trees.\n\nIf we can understand the role played by the Book in Kojève, we will be able to grasp both the status, and the radical limitation, of Absolute Knowledge as it is both the Book and the Book’s reading.\n\nTime is circular, but it is not cyclical. Hegelian time, according to Kojève, can only be run through (parcouru) once (ILH, 391). This is because the end is a return to the state before which the Human commences: the one in which an opposition between Man and his World does not exist. That opposition, in and through which Man exists (and creates himself) in Time and Action, is History. At the end, the opposition between Man and World is overcome, and ceases to exist: History ends and Man dies. The difference between beginning and end is that at the end, and after it, “Identity is revealed by the Concept. . . . It is only at the end of History that the identity of Man and World exists for Man, as revealed by human Discourse” (ILH, 392).\n\nThere is a certain irony in all this, upon which Kojève does not dwell. The end is the “discursive revelation of its beginning”–yet the higher knowledge that is the end, the “comprehension of anthropogenic Desire, as it is revealed in the Phenomenology” (ILH, 392), is a human comprehension (“for Man”) that nevertheless marks the end of Man. In an impossible moment Man both understands and ceases to exist. His understanding and death would seem to have to be simultaneous, as well as definitive. After the end, there is no Man left to whom Discourse can reveal the unity of Man and World.\n\nHence the strange status of the Book. The Book, we are told, is the “empirical existence of Science” (ILH, 394). Its return is also its definitive termination, because then the “totality of Discourse is exhausted [épuisee]” (ILH, 393). There can only be one book, then, that contains the defunct but definitive Science. As we’ve already seen, Kojève compares this book to a dead body, separated for ever from its consciousness/author.\n\nDiscourse as well then returns to Nature; Man is dead, Action is over, and the “empirical existence of Science is not historical Man, but a Book made of paper, in other words a natural entity” (ILH, 394).\n\nBut if all this is the case, why would anyone read the Book? If Historical Action is at an end, and if Man is dead, there would be no point in doing so. Yet not to do so would consign all of human History–and Absolute Knowledge–to a kind of Absolute Forgetting. In that case there would be a return to the origin not on the higher level of comprehension, but on the lower level of simple repetition.\n\nThat clearly is not an option either, so the Book must be read. The crucial question then is: what is reading? Whatever it is, it will be the task of the posthistorical animal/dandy. Reading is not Action or historically significant labor of any sort–all that is over, ended. And since the cycle only returns to its origin once, it cannot be a reading that entails any individual interpretation or thought: it can only be a sheer repetition of the one, definitive, return of Science and Knowledge. Kojève writes:\n\nCertainly, the Book must be read and understood by men, in order to be a Book, in other words something other than paper. But the man who reads it no longer creates anything and he no longer changes himself: he is therefore no longer Time with the primacy of the Future or History; in other words he is not Man in the strong sense of the word. This man is, himself, a quasi-natural or cyclical being: he is a reasonable animal, who changes and reproduces himself while remaining eternally identical to himself. And it is this “reasonable animal” who is the “absoluter Geist,” become Spirit or completed-and-perfect [achevé-et-parfait]; in other words, dead. (ILH, 394)\n\nThe end of history, which had promised so much, with its State as a kind of institutionalized utopia, mediating through law the mutual recognition of the “anthropogenic” Desire of all men, becomes a kind of necrotopia of reading. The Book cannot not be read. 7 But what is commonly understood by “reading”–a personal understanding and a perhaps wayward interpretation that can, and does, discover new things in the text–is out of the question here. The Book cannot therefore be read, either–or we must totally redefine reading. Reading in the Kojèvian sense will become an animalistic or dead repetition of Discourse, its exact repetition by the dead. This is the strange end of the Kojèvian mock theology that would replace heaven with the State, 8 and of a mock existentialism that would resituate the recognition and reign of death definitively as satisfaction and stasis. 9\n\nReading, then, becomes as “natural” as the Book–it is not an Action in Time; it is not, on other words, a human activity. The Book is an “objective reality,” the only possible realization of philosophy, which must be recognized by all persons–i.e., by the State–in order to be true: mere intention is not enough (ILH, 414, note). It is when Kojève considers the “objective” existence of the Work that we see the problem in his conception of reading, for he can only see publication as subjecting the Work, the Book, to the “danger [that it will be] changed and perverted” (ILH, 414, note). Kojève sees this risk of “perversion”–of interpretation, in other words–as a regrettable consequence of the necessity of the Work to be “the objectively-real that maintains itself”–i.e., to be a Work that is published and circulated as a real, solid object–rather than a “pure intention” that “fades away [s’evanouit]”–i.e., that is an idea beyond appropriation by all of society, or by the State (ILH, 414, note). Kojève, in other words, can only see reading as a function of the passive reproduction of what is “objectively-real”; all deviation from an imagined definitive meaning (or Absolute Knowledge) can only be “perversion.”\n\nIn light of this it is hard to see why Kojève makes a strong distinction between the book as mere paper and the act of reading. Reading as the pure repetition of a dead, frozen state will be as “material” as the thudding pileup in a warehouse of the unread copies of a book. Hermeneutics becomes hermetics: the act of reading now is the automatic reproduction of a hermetically sealed text, and of a “Knowledge” so remote that there is no place in it, or around it, for human action: thinking, rethinking, questioning. Cultural reproduction made possible by this reading will be the mere repetition ad infinitum of the assent of the dead, of animals. So much for the paradise on earth that Kojève saw as replacing the bad-faith paradise of all organized religion.\n\nWe see here a complete reversal from the position at the outset of history, when man confronted nature and transformed it through his labor. That view presented a radical duality between a dialectical Man and inert nature. 10 Now it is Nature–as the material Book, and as the dead reading of the Book–that has become dialectical, or at least post-dialectical, whereas Man is simply dead. Nature has triumphed, but its triumph is of no concern to the “human animals”–the Americans or Japanese, bees or dandys, it hardly matters–who engage in their fragmentary and formal activities which are of no relevance whatever to the genesis, triumph, or demise of Man.\n\nIt is here that we can draw some conclusions about the radical–and significant–difference between the posthistorical and the postmodern. The posthistorical, as we’ve just seen, posits a radical break, an unbridgeable gap, between definitive Knowledge and the freeplay of posthistorical action. The Book can contain nothing of interest to say about the residual uses to which leftover negativity, in the form of human action, will be put “after” the end of History. In other words it has nothing at all to say about the present or the future. Indeed the few pronouncements Kojève makes on this subject are all in footnotes, as if they were tangential to the main body of the text. The postmodern, on the other hand, puts forward a “knowledge” that arrives at its end by recognizing the necessity of the proliferation of what we might call “unbound” discourses and language games. It recognizes its death as definitive knowledge in and of the proliferation of partial knowledges, activities, and languages. Rather than being essentially closed to them, as indifferent as mere paper or rote reading, it is open to and dependent on them: it is the very knowledge of their incompletion that makes its completion–a provisional completion, to be sure, but a completion–possible.\n\nPosthistorical Knowledge always comes too soon–the Owl of Minerva always takes off well before dusk–because it closes off the possibility of, and is blind to, human activity, even though activity will obviously continue, albeit without benefit of Wise Man or Book. Postmodern knowledge, on the other hand, comes too soon as well, but for the opposite reason: because its larger truth must be ignored by the very activities that justify it. If posthistorical Knowledge knows too little, postmodern knowledge knows too much. The postmodern is always already in advance of the partial activities it defines: if those activities were themselves to recognize fully the postmodern, they would simply fall under its aegis: they would be coherent parts of a larger narrative, and thus fully modern, and ultimately posthistorical. And yet these activities, these games, are thoroughly dependent on a postmodern knowledge which they must not know: without the overarching knowledge of the postmodern, they would be indistinguishable from any other human narratives, “primitive” or “modern,” which have nothing whatsoever to do with the postmodern. And without their definitive blindness, at the end of modernity which is the postmodern, they would only be components of a higher Knowledge, fully recuperated by it. They, in other words, in order to be postmodern, must in some sense be as blind to postmodern knowledge as posthistorical Knowledge would be to them.\n\nAnd yet the Kojèvian posthistorical might be more postmodern than the postmodern. It, after all, is ignorant, locked in its perfect, one-time circularity. It does not, and must not, concern itself with, or know, that which comes after it, in an inevitable but supplementary relation. It is the sheer performance, in other words, of the blindness of partial knowledges and practices that the postmodern can only know. The posthistorical is therefore the enactment of the postmodern in and through its absolutely necessary lack of awareness of itself as postmodern; this lack is nothing more than the a priori failure and completion of postmodern knowledge. The posthistorical will always again come after the postmodern, supplementing it with its radical not-knowing. The posthistorical Owl also always flies too late–well after dusk.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

See, in this context, Francis Fukuyama’s neo-Kojèvian celebration of the New World Order, The End of History and the Last Man (New York: The Free Press, 1992). Jacques Derrida has recently criticized Fukuyama for the incoherence of his approach: either the end of history is a kind of eschatology, a pure logical necessity beyond empirical proof, or it is empirically verifiable, in which case it loses the attributes that give it its necessity, and also its attractiveness. One cannot, however, demonstrate the logically necessary (or the “messianic”) by invoking empirical observations. See Derrida, Spectres de Marx (Paris: Galilée, 1993), pp. 112-20. Derrida, at the end of the same chapter (“Conjurer–le marxisme,” pp. 120-27) also considers some of the Kojèvian footnotes that I discuss in this article. I would argue that one could extend Derrida’s critique of Fukuyama to Kojève himself: for Kojève too history is ended because it is a logical necessity that it end: therefore he is largely indifferent to what comes next. Yet at the same time Kojève points to empirical evidence–America, the Soviet Union, Japan, the defeat of the Nazis–to back up his thesis.\n\n3. On the postmodern and adjudication between language games in conflict, see Lyotard’s The Differend: Phrases in Dispute, trans. Georges Van Den Abbeele (Minneapolis: The University of Minnesota Press, 1988).\n\n4. The Introduction to the Reading of Hegel (New York: Basic Books, 1969) is an English translation (by James H. Nichols, Jr.) of certain sections of Kojève’s Introduction la lecture de Hegel (Paris: Gallimard, Collection “Tel,” 1980). The editor of the English edition, Allan Bloom, has omitted much of the material of the 1938-39 lectures. When possible, then, I quote from the official English translation, giving page numbers from it, following the letters “IRH.” When a citation is not found in the English edition, I provide my own translation and cite the page number of the French edition, following the letters “ILH.” The reader will note that the pagination of the now widely available French edition from which I quote is different from that of the original French edition (Paris: Gallimard, 1947).\n\n5.”One more word about teaching what the world ought to be: philosophy always arrives too late to do any such teaching . . . the Owl of Minerva takes flight only as the dusk begins to fall” (Hegel, Preface to the Philosophy of Right).\n\n6.Kojève could never admit that a dialectics of nature was conceivable. Prior to human desire, there is simple identity. Judith Butler writes: “Kojève views nature as a set of brutally given facts, governed by the principle of simple identity, displaying no dialectical possibilities, and, hence, in stark contrast to the life of consciousness” (Subjects of Desire: Hegelian Reflections in Twentieth Century France [New York: Columbia University Press, 1987], p. 67). Maurice Blanchot rewrites this unreadability in his 1948 novel, Le Tres-Haut. In this fiction the Book becomes the journal of a perfect civil servant of a posthistorical State, a civil servant who is at the same time a subversive challenging the State through the very act of writing. The Book for Blanchot becomes an allegory of the collapse of political allegory, since all writing on the State is both fully recuperable by it, and is also its death, its extinction. Meaning itself is in a twilight zone of perfect representation of the State–so perfect it’s inhuman, or posthuman–but is also, by the very fact that it is a written representation, the death of that State, but a never dying death. (The curse of death is that it cannot die.) Such a text is perfectly circular, but also unreadable: nothing can ever happen in this State, and there is nothing more to be said, and certainly nothing more to read–but this nothing, this self-cancelling law, will be repeated endlessly, in exactly the same form. See my preface to the translation I have done of this novel, entitled The Most High, forthcoming from the University of Nebraska Press.\n\n7.This is a gambit that comes out quite clearly in Kojève’s article “Hegel, Marx, et le Christianisme” (Critique, 1, 3-4 (1946): 339-66. See, for example, p. 358: “Thus–a supremely curious thing [chose curieuse entre toutes]–man is completed and perfected, in other words he attains supreme satisfaction, by becoming conscious, in the person of the Wise Man, of his essential finitude.” Kojève thus links the most profound desire of religion (as he sees it)–to guarantee man perfection and satisfaction–to that which religion most abhors: mortality.\n\n8.As Mikkel Dufrenne notes (p. 397), Kojève’s stress on finitude and mortality establishes his Hegelianism as a revisionary Heideggerianism. See “Actualit de Hegel”–a review of Kojève’s Introduction and Jean Hyppolite’s “Genese et structure de la Phenomenologie de l’esprit chez Hegel”–in Esprit, 16, 9 (1948): 396-408.\n\n9.See note 5, above. Dufrenne for his part sees this duality between a nondialectical nature (the “en-soi“) and dialectical Man the “pour-soi“) as a key inheritance from existentialism–one which poses plenty of problems for philosophers such as Sartre, in Being and Nothingness. How indeed does the “pour-soi” arise if the “en-soi” is closed? How can the two be reconciled beyond a mere “as if”? For Dufrenne, this is the origin of the thematics of failure (échec), anguish and despair in Sartre: “A linear series of failures cannot be taken for a dialectic” (Dufrenne, 401-03).\n\n10.This statement should not be taken as a “criticism” of the postmodern, or an attempt to condemn it by “associating” it with the posthistorical. As is made clear in Blanchot’s novel (see footnote 7, above) there is no logical space outside of the postmodern–or the posthistorical, for that matter–from which such a “criticism” could be carried out.\n\nDeepika Bahri\n\nSchool of Literature, Communication, and Culture\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\ndeepika.bahri@modlangs.gatech.edu\n\nDirecting his “attention to the importance of two problems raised by Marxism and by anthropology concerning the moral and social significance of biological and physical ‘things,'” Michael Taussig argues in The Nervous System that “things such as the signs and symptoms of disease, as much as the technology of healing, are not ‘things-in-themselves,’ are not only biological and physical, but are also signs of social relations disguised as natural things, concealing their roots in human reciprocity” (83). If Taussig’s observation with regard to the cultural analysis of an illness and its treatment in the USA in 1978 is extrapolated to a very different scene but not so distant time, the machinations of illness in a fictional case study reveal the usually syncopated socio-personal reciprocity Taussig suggests. The scene is Rhodesia on the brink of its evolution into the nation now named after a ruined city in its southern part. The “subject” under analysis is Nyasha, the anorexic, teenage deuteragonist of Tsitsi Dangarembga’s 1988 novel Nervous Conditions (a title inspired by Sartre’s observation in the preface to The Wretched of the Earth, that the native’s is a nervous condition 1). The novel, narrated in the first person by Nyasha’s cousin Tambu, catalogues the struggles of the latter to escape the impoverished and stifling atmosphere of the “homestead” in search of education and a better life, as well the efforts of other women in her family to negotiate their circumstances, offering the while a scathing critique of the confused and corrupt social structure they are a part of. Tambu’s movement from her homestead, which symbolizes rural decay, to the prosperous, urban mission of her uncle introduces us to a cast of characters scarred by encounters with the savagery of colonialism in the context of an indigenously oppressive socius. One of many characters in the novel suffering from a nervous condition, young Nyasha demonstrates in dramatic pathological form what appears to ail an entire socio-economic construct. If “the manifestations of disease are like symbols, and the diagnostician sees them and interprets them with an eye trained by the social determinants of perception” (Taussig 87), and if, as Susan Bordo argues in “The Body and Reproduction of Femininity,” “the bodies of disordered women . . . offer themselves as aggressively graphic text for the interpreter–a text that insists, actually demands, it be read as a cultural statement” (16), Nyasha’s diseased self suggests the textualized female body on whose abject person are writ large the imperial inscriptions of colonization, the intimate branding of patriarchy, and the battle between native culture, Western narrative, and her complex relationship with both. Not surprisingly, Nyasha’s response to this violence on the body is not only somatogenic but it is to manifest specifically that illness which will consume that body.\n\nThe pathological consequences of colonization, signaled in the heightened synaptic activity which, according to Fanon, produces violence among colonized peoples, take shape in Nyasha in the need to target herself as the site on which to launch a terrorist attack upon the produced self. According to Sartre, the violence of the settlers contaminates the colonized, producing fury; failing to find an outlet, “it turns in a vacuum and devastates the oppressed creatures themselves” (18). The quest for an outlet takes grotesque forms in Nyasha through the physical symptomatology of disorder. But it would be entirely too simple to attribute her disease to the ills of colonization alone: Nyasha responds not only as native and Other, she responds as woman to the ratification of socially en-gendered native categories which conspire with colonial narratives to ensure her subjectivity. The implication of precapital and precolonial socio-economic systems in the postcolonial state, moreover, makes a simplistic oppositionality between colonizer/colonized meaningless. Her response to Western colonial narratives which enthrall as they distress at a time when she is also contending with her burgeoning sexuality in a repressed society, further complicate any efforts to understand and explain her pathology. Living on the edge of a body weakening from anorexia and bulimia, Nyasha’s involuntary reaction to the narratives competing for control over her, I would suggest, appears to be to systematically evacuate the materials ostensibly intended to sustain her, empty the body of signification and content to make “a body without organs” (BwO) in Deleuze and Guattari’s terminology, and thereby to reveal and dismantle (although never completely) the self diseased by both patriarchy and colonization. As Tambu’s narrative unfolds, the female body as text itself is being rewritten as protest, attempting to rid itself of the desires projected on it, even if hybrid subjectivity prevents it from purging them all. 2 The “body talk” invoked in my reading, informed largely by postmodern (despite the “realist” mode of narration) and feminist concerns, also resonates with postcolonial, social, and psychological ones. Many of these approaches are of unlike ilk, and none of them can be explained fully within the scope of this essay. Rather, the interplay of these positions is used to shed light on a case that defies simple theoretical models. Readers will note the use in this essay of Western and non-Western theorists, often with widely ranging positionings: given the “hybrid” culture being described in the novel and the range of apparata necessary to understand Nyasha’s condition in terms that were medical as well as socio-political, feminist as well as postcolonial, physical as well as psychological, it seemed specious to confine the theoretical apparatus to non-Western theory or a particular feminist or postcolonial perspective. More importantly, it seemed less useful. None of these perspectives, however, preclude the analysis of body as metaphor and illness as symbol.\n\nNyasha’s recourse to a stereotypically Western female pathological condition 3 to empty herself of food, the physical token of her anomie and a significant preoccupation of African life, is ironic and fitting as Dangarembga forces a collocation of native and colonial cultural concerns to complicate our ways of reading the postcolonial. Nyasha’s accusatory delirium, kamikaze behavior and oneiroid symptoms are at once symptomatic of a postcolonial and female disorder whereby the symptom is the cure, both exemplified in her refusal to occupy the honorary space allotted her by colonial and patriarchal narratives in which she is required to be but cannot be a good native and a good girl. This entails her rejection of food (metonymic token of a system that commodifies women’s bodies and labor and sustains male authority), of a socio-sexual code that is designed to prepare her for an unequal marriage market while repressing her sexuality, and of an educational system which has the potential to emancipate women and natives but functions, instead, to keep them in their place and even further exacerbate their ills.\n\nIn “Killing the Hysteric in the Colonized’s House”, Sue Thomas has argued for a reading of the novel as a narrative of loss of cultural and maternal affiliations, invoking Grosz’s suggestion that hysteria is a tragic self-mutilation that symptomatizes inarticulable resistance (27). Hysterical overcompliance with domination, she suggests, characterizes all the major characters in the novel. While this is well substantiated in her essay, I will argue that the female body is a very particular space that is marked in ways that narrativize elaborate systems of production, cultural and economic. The recoding of these systems in the text, elaborated in the story of Tambu’s introduction into and misgivings about the cycle, the adult women’s struggles within it, and Nyasha’s articulation of structural imparities is a staging of these narratives in performative terms that bears illustrative witness to the violence done to the female body in the successive scenes of pre and postcolonial Zimbabwe. Nyasha’s war with patriarchal and colonial systems is fought on the turf of her own body, both because it is the scene of enactment of these systems and because it is the only site of resistance available. This reading suggests that the performativity of female resistance needs to be at the heart of a feminist postcolonial politics.\n\nIt would be well to acknowledge the centrality of Dangarembga’s feminist agenda before attempting to transpose a postcolonial reading on the novel. In an interview with Rosemary Marangoly George and Helen Scott, the author claimed that her purpose was “to write things about ourselves in our own voices which other people can pick up to read. And I do think that Nervous Conditions is serving this purpose for young girls in Zimbabwe” (312). Tambudzai, the young female narrator’s missionary education tells only of “Ben and Betty in Town and Country” (27), not of her own people; Nervous Conditions is an attempt at telling Zimbabwean girls stories about themselves to counter the lingering narrative in which Zimbabwe remains a remote control neo-colony administered by toadies like Nyasha’s western educated father, Babamukuru and his ilk who are still “painfully under the evil wizard’s spell,” and will continue the colonial project (50). Women’s stories do not easily see the light of day in Zimbabwe because, according to Dangarembga, “the men are the publishers” and “it seems very difficult for men to accept the things that women write and want to write about” (qtd. in George 311). These stories, however, must be told. Early in the novel, Tambu tells us that the novel is not about death though it begins with the ironic admission “I was not sorry when my brother died” (1); rather it is about “my escape and Lucia’s; about my mother’s and Maiguru’s entrapment; and about Nyasha’s rebellion [which] may not in the end have been successful” (1). The postcolonial critic should be wary that any overarching theory proposed be mediated by Dangarembga’s emphasis on the feminist preoccupations of the story for the novel ends with the reminder: “the story I have told here, is my own story, the story of four women whom I loved, and our men, this story is how it all began” (204). That the novel opens with the prefiguring of her brother Nhamo’s death to make way for Tambu’s tale is a poignant reminder of the symbolic starting point of female narrative. Far from making a postcolonial reading less tenable, however, Dangarembga’s feminist proclivities are useful in explaining the dense nature of power relations in the postcolonial world in a way that colonial discourse (including western feminist discourse) typically fails to do.\n\nIn Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism, Chandra Talpade Mohanty complains that Western feminists “homogenize and systematize” third world woman, creating a single dimensional picture. They also assume a “singular, monolithic notion of patriarchy” which is reductive. Ultimately, “Western feminisms appropriate and ‘colonize’ the fundamental complexities and conflicts which characterize the lives of women of different classes, religions, cultures, races and castes in these countries” (335). Dangarembga’s representation of women of different ages, classes, educational qualifications, and economic capacities, makes composite and reductive sketches of the third world woman if not impossible, difficult. The women in this novel are neither simply victims, nor inherently more noble than the men; rather, their stories illustrate the difficulty of separating problem and solution, perpetrator and victim, cause and effect. That they are uniquely positioned to bear the brunt of native and colonial oppression, however, is vividly demonstrated: even issues of class and status are ultimately subservient to and informed by a pervasive but complex phallocentric order; this Tambu clarifies when she marvels at “the way all the conflicts came back to this question of femaleness” (116). The patriarchal order is supported by the colonial project, pre and post capitalist economy, and what we may call, for lack of a better phrase, traditional cultural codes. By layering gender politics with the atrophying discourse of colonialism, Dangarembga obliges us to recognize that the power structure is a contradictory amalgam of complicity and helplessness–where colonizer and colonized, men and women collude to produce their psycho-pathological, in a word, “nervous” conditions. What ails Nyasha, then, is not simply an eating problem but a rampant disorder in the socio-cultural complex that determines her fate as woman and native on the eve of the birth of a new nation.\n\nThe novel dramatizes the intersections of personal and national history on the one hand 4 and the feminist and postcolonial on the other through Nyasha’s attempts to escape her own assigned narrative as woman and colonized subject. Colonialism, capitalism, and patriarchal national culture conspire to produce an imperiled Nyasha and a nation in crisis. Symptoms of the latter abound in the repetitive images of rural poverty, female disempowerment, and continuing colonialism in educational and economic institutions while Nyasha’s crisis is evident in her hysteric, nervous condition and endangered body. Given this, one could read Nyasha’s story as yet another vignette of victimage, but, apart from Dangarembga’s own criticism of such a narrative, 5 there are other reasons for reading it as a text of possibilities for survival, agency, and re-creation. Several third world feminist critics reject the discourse of victimage in feminist and minority discourse. Mohanty objects in “Under Western Eyes” to the “construction of ‘Third World Women’ as a homogeneous ‘powerless’ group often located as implicit victims of particular socio-economic systems” (338). Spivak complains that “There is a horrible, horrible thing in minority discourse which is a competition for maximum victimization . . . . That is absolutely meretricious.” 6 This is not to say that Nyasha is not victimized but to acknowledge that it is quite another thing to cast her as victim. Western feminists also recognize this distinction: Naomi Wolf’s recent Fire with Fire, for instance, issues a call to women to eschew the rhetoric of victimage. Nyasha is conscious of victimization but hardly content to remain a victim; regardless of the caliber or effectiveness of her methods of opposition, she/her body are the enunciation of protest against and the story of victimization. A reading of Nyasha as victim fails for another interesting reason: this is because the text reveals the ways in which she is quite complicit with the oppressive order she so abhors. In this sense, too, she emerges less as victim than as the mediated product of a conflicted narrative.\n\nReading female praxis as narrative of relative “agency,” in The Beauty Myth Naomi Wolf tells us that anorexia and bulimia begin “as sane and mentally healthy responses to an insane social reality: that most women can feel good about themselves only in a state of permanent semistarvation” (198), although it is not the myth of female beauty alone that contaminates Nyasha–she is rejecting the very basic processes, the business of living in a colonized world where she shares the dual onus of being colonized and female. Wolf also tells us that “Eating diseases are often interpreted as symptomatic of a neurotic need for control. But surely it is a sign of mental health to try to control something that is trying to control you” (198). Nyasha leaves us in no doubt that she is aware of the oppressive forces that seek to bend her to their will. In one of her many pedagogic moments, she warns Tambu that “when you’ve seen different things you want to be sure you’re adjusting to the right thing. You can’t go on all the time being whatever’s necessary. You’ve got to have some conviction . . . . Once you get used to it, it’s natural to carry on and become trapped” and then it becomes clear that “they control everything you do” (117). Hardly, it would seem, is this the language or sensibility of a passive victim. Nyasha’s potential for agency cannot be acknowledged until one understands that the “[body] still remains the threshold for the transcendence of the subject” (Braidotti 151). Through the diseased female body as text is made visible the violence of history, and through its spontaneous bodily resistance, the possibilities for rupturing and remaking that text. Control over the body is a gesture of denial of representative abject/subject status for Nyasha since “the proliferation of discourses about life, the living organism, and the body is coextensive with the dislocation of the very basis of the human subject’s representation” (151).\n\nThe teleology of Nyasha’s anorexic and bulimic practices is intimately linked to her revulsion at the mandate to represent herself as good girl and good native in particular instances of infractions against her sense of self in the novel. Tambu speaks of the time Babamukuru confiscates Nyasha’s copy of D.H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover which is objectionable for its depiction of female sexuality. Appalled at this invasion of her rights, and what might be seen as a persistent barrier to her development into sexual agent rather than sexualized commodity, Nyasha, indicating the etiology of her symptoms, refuses to eat for the first time in the novel (83). Tambu next alerts us to Nyasha’s quiet rejection of her meal when she is scolded by her father for not responding to her primary school headmaster and thereby shaming him; it is Tambu who tells us that her cousin’s behavior stems from her dislike of being spoken in the third person, because “it made her feel like an object” (99). In preparing for her Standard Six exams, too, Nyasha loses her appetite, signaling the much greater apotheosis of internal conflict to follow at her O-levels. Her withdrawal from the family and rejection of food after the confrontation over her late arrival from the school dance, and subsequently on another later arrival from school where she has stayed to study, then, comes as no surprise. Layered in between these specific instances are general references to Nyasha’s disdain of fatty foods in the interest of maintaining a more desirable body shape; this quest for “commodification” as an attractive object is not recognized by her as destructive and, interestingly, is not textually linked directly to starvation or anorexia. Instead, the usually appearance-centered practices of anorexia and bulimia become narrativized as artful, if grotesque, protest that will prevent Nyasha’s maturation into full fledged commodified “womanhood,” even as she embraces the abjection that comes from seeking a “pre-objectal relationship,” becoming separated from her own body “in order to be” (Kristeva 10). 7\n\nThe question of control is focal and must be located within the matrix of complex power relations to understand the significance of Nyasha’s rebellion. 8 Patriarchal society, colonial imperialism, and capitalist economy function by controlling and commodifying the subject’s body and labor; the female subject in this cultural and social economy, well documented in Nervous Conditions, is assessed by the ability to reproduce (she goes into labor), to provide sexual release (the labors of love), and to work (home, farm, market labor). Prostitution and pimping are extreme representations of the annexation of female labor while the marital institution within oppressive narratives is a quotidian, usually sanctioned, appropriation. Female labor in this novel denotes a woman’s exchange value in the socio-familial and matrimonial economy. It is necessary to understand the role of female labor in the novel and the reason why it is not available as a site of resistance to grasp fully the implications of Nyasha’s default choice of the physical body as the locus for rebellion. Women are not only expected to work and work for men, their value and worth are determined by work, although it does not make them “valuable” in any intrinsic, meaningful sense. In “Re-examining Patriarchy as a Mode of Production: The Case of Zimbabwe,” Cindy Courville explains that “women’s exploitation and oppression were structured in terms of political, economic, and social relations of the Shona and Ndebele societies” (34). Under colonial capitalism, however, women became the “‘proletariat’ of the proletariats, becoming more subordinated in the new socio-economic schemes, and often losing their old and meaningful roles within the older production processes” (Ogundipe-Leslie 108).\n\nTambu reveals that “the needs and sensibilities of the women in my family were not considered a priority, or even legitimate” (12). Women are intended to enable men to attain value through their labor: Netsai and Tambu, therefore, must labor so their brother Nhamo can attend school. They may not enjoy the fruits of their own labor: “under both traditional and colonial law, they [African women] were denied ownership and control of the land and the goods they produced. It was the unpaid labor of women and children which subsidized the colonial wage” (Courville 38). Nhamo, in fact, steals Tambu’s labor–the maize she has been growing in a scant spare time to buy an education–and squanders it in gifts to friends, while her father steals her prospects by keeping the money Babamukuru has sent him for Tambu’s school bills. 9 Interestingly, while the maize does serve to keep her in school, 10 and later allows her admission to the mostly White Sacred Heart Convent, we can assume from her aunt Maiguru’s trajectory and her own pursuit of it that she will continue to be schooled in the ways of a societal economy that will use her labor to support and enable the colonial and patriarchal order which will deny her, as it has Maiguru, the fruits of that labor. Maiguru, the most educated woman in the novel, is just as qualified as her husband Babamukuru (a little publicized fact that surprises Tambu when she learns of it) and just as instrumental in helping to maintain the mission lifestyle that Nhamo and Tambu find so dazzling, but her knowledge and her labor are never acknowledged: they have been annexed to serve a societal order which awards the fruits of that knowledge and labor as well as the associated prestige to Babamukuru, lending him authority, as a result, over the entire extended family, including his older brother. Babamukuru, in effect, has “stolen” her labor to enhance his position. To the untrained eye Maiguru appears to be incapable of suffering because she “lived in the best of all possible circumstances, in the best of all possible worlds” as Tambu says, ironically echoing Candide’s unfortunate and misguided philosopher Pangloss. To this Nyasha replies that “such things could only be seen” (142). Education, then, which might free women like Maiguru from service to capitalism and patriarchy becomes yet another token of exchange, further alienating them from the “home” economy of agricultural subsistence in favor of urban wage service. 11 When she and her husband return to their uneducated, struggling relatives, it is to further heighten the impoverishment of the homestead, and the need to escape from it. It is Nyasha who points out that the education of solitary family members will not solve the ills of rural poverty: “there’ll always be brothers and mealies and mothers too tired to clean latrines. Whether you go to the convent or not. There’s more to be done than that,” she tells Tambu who believes that education will “lighten” their burdens (179). Near the end of the novel, Tambu herself wonders, “but what use were educated young ladies on the homestead? Or at the mission?” (199). Admittedly comprehension has only begun to dawn on her at that stage, but a fuller realization seems to be clearly indicated.\n\nBabamukuru, his young nephew Nhamo, and son Chido, however, embrace colonial capitalism and education because they are usually compatible with and in fact, uphold traditional patriarchy. Courville tells us that “the colonial state sanctioned and institutionalized the political and legal status of African women as minors and/or dependents subject to male control” (37). Educational degrees, in this economy, are fodder for men’s appetites for control. Witness the following scene. On his return from England, Babamukuru is comically greeted by a rousing chorus of admirers who extol his abilities, while ignoring Maiguru’s comparable achievements: “Our father and benefactor has returned appeased, having devoured English letters with a ferocious appetite! Did you think degrees were indigestible? If so, look at my brother. He has digested them” (36). Indeed, men can digest degrees as well as the food prepared by women since both sustain their stature while failing to “nourish” the women. Their lot, educational status notwithstanding, is defined by service to and for men. Courville claims that while “some social aspects of African patriarchy were repugnant to European culture . . . colonial authorities recognized the significance of patriarchal power in mobilizing the labor of women” (38). That none of the women in the novel ever refuse their labor is no oddity since we learn that female labor may not be and is not withheld for fear of punishment; Netsai’s failure to carry her empty-handed brother’s bags at Tambu’s suggestion, for instance, results in a sound thrashing and her conclusion that she should have just done it “in the first place” (10). Nor is Nhamo’s behavior unusual; while Tambu acknowledges that “Nhamo was not interested in being fair,” she insists he was not being obnoxious, merely behaving “in the expected manner” (12). Netsai, needless to say, never refuses to carry his bags again. Even Tambu, who appears to demonstrate a keen sense of outrage at the injustice of a patriarchal order while at the homestead, participates in all the labor intensive tasks on the homestead while the men await service. One of the few instances of her failure to be a “good girl,” evident to her uncle in her refusal to attend the Christian ceremony that is to sanction her parents’ otherwise “sinful” marriage of many years–an embarrassing and humiliating proposition to Tambu, is also, predictably, punished with a beating and a sentence of domestic labor; interestingly, before she issues an outright refusal, Tambu confesses to a muscular inability to leave her bed, prompting her uncle to ask if she is “ill” and then to dismiss Maiguru’s affirmative response with injunctions to get the girl dressed; this event is an adroit linking in the novel of its major themes, revealing the nexus of relations between illness, body, labor, colonialism, patriarchy, and the female subject.\n\nNyasha, too, who is seen laboring on the homestead along with the other women, including Maiguru, at the family’s Christmas gathering, is clearly being prepared for a lifetime of service to the men in her life despite her relatively privileged economic status. Since labor cannot be denied in the phallocratic order–at least not with impunity, the body then becomes the site of conflict for control. I realize that the dichotomy between labor and the body here is problematic since it is the body that labors, but in this instance we need to separate the two to recognize the extent to which Nyasha’s body as text is scripted, and how that text might be reinscribed as protest.\n\nIn a certain sense, Nyasha’s understanding of bodily dimensions has been shaped, if not determined, by her brief exposure in England to the Western desire for the “svelte, sensuous” womanly frame (197); she is preoccupied with her own figure and urges her unofficial pupil Tambu not to eat too much (192). Her sense of the ideal self, then, has already been appropriated by an aesthetic that does not recognize the wide-hipped, muscle bound female form as beautiful; this same constitutional African female frame is prized for its capacity to produce labor and to signal the subject’s relatively superior status because it suggests that the subject is well-fed, a beautiful thing in societies that experience food shortages. Tambu and Nyasha’s aunt Lucia, for instance, “managed somehow to keep herself plump in spite of her tribulations . . . . And Lucia was strong. She could cultivate a whole acre single-handed without rest”; these twin attributes qualify her as an “inviting prospect” to Takesure, Tambu’s father, and, Dangarembga hints, Babamukuru (127). Nyasha’s attraction to the Western ideal of femininity must be mediated, then, by her understanding of the exploitative usurpation of the healthy African female body. On a visit to the homestead, Tambu’s mother, Mainini, pinches Nyasha’s breast after remarking that “the breasts are already quite large” and then asking when she is to bring them a son-in-law (130). Nyasha’s pathology and her belief that “angles were more attractive than curves” (135), I would insist, is not simply rooted in her desire for slimness (which it might be) but also in a rejection of the rounded contours of the adult female body primed for the Shona matrimonial and social economy.\n\nThe role of food as a pawn in this struggle for control over the body is a crucial one. Wolf notes that “Food is the primal symbol of social worth. Whom a society values, it feeds well” and “Publicly apportioning food is about determining power relations” (189). She concludes that: “Cross-culturally, men receive hot meals, more protein, and the first helpings of a dish, while women eat the cooling leftovers, often having to use deceit and cunning to get enough to eat” (190-91). This pattern is made amply clear at the Christmas reunion at the homestead where Babamukuru and Maiguru provide the victuals. Maiguru jealously guards the meat, insisting that the rotting meat be cooked and served despite its tell-tale green color, but not to the patriarchy who are served from meat that has been stored in the somewhat small refrigerator. The able women at the homestead must cook and serve the dwindling food, eating last and little, typically without complaint. They, in fact, sleep in the kitchen but their labor produced in their assigned space is not theirs to enjoy, except as scraps.\n\nIn Babamukuru’s household, women do not eat least although they must wait till he is served. Even here, Maiguru replicates the practices of the homestead, fawning over her husband and eating his leftovers. Babamukuru puts out a token protest at her servility, following it up with a rebuke to Nyasha for helping herself to the rice before he is quite finished. He, nevertheless, prides himself on his table and would have been gratified by wide-eyed and poorly-fed Tambu’s silent observation that “no one who ate from such a table could fail to grow fat and healthy” (69). In this case, however, it is important to note that the ability to provide plentifully gives Babamukuru prestige even though Maiguru’s labor is just as important in accounting for the ample table. Refusal to eat at such a table is tantamount to a direct challenge to his authority. He repeatedly insists that Nyasha “must eat her food, all of it” or he will “stop providing for her–fees, clothes, food, everything” (189). Given this, it may be somewhat easier to understand Nyasha’s inability to stomach the food intended to “develop” her into a valuable commodity for the market, and to serve as a token doled out to enhance her father’s stature and to exercise his control over her, exhibited in multiple other ways as well.\n\nBabamukuru is obsessed with control in general, control over women in particular, and control over his girl-becoming-woman daughter, how much she eats, how she dresses and speaks to the elders in the family, how often and how much she talks with boys, and what she reads, all measures designed to fashion her into a “decent” woman. Perhaps it might be more accurate to add that he is “pathetically” obsessed, being himself implicated in a societal system that puts men of means and education in the slot of caretaker and guardian so he must maintain and improve, juggling old and new ways, or find his own position as “good boy” (defined by a different but no less compelling rubric) jeopardized. Nyasha’s body and her mind, then, are pressed into Babamukuru’s strangely distorted project of asserting his control and preserving his status in society lest it be challenged: “I am respected in this mission,” he announces, “I cannot have a daughter who behaves like a whore” (114). Nyasha’s questionable behavior, punished with a merciless beating, consists of coming in ten minutes later than her brother Chido–who is not subject to the same rules anyway–and cousin Tambu–who seldom challenges her uncle’s authority or taxes him with the need to exert it–from a school dance. The survival of patriarchal ideology, of which Babamukuru is torchbearer, depends on its enactment on Nyasha’s very person. This should not be surprising since, in postcolonial terms, the female body has often been the space where “traditional” cultural practices that ensure male control over it, encoded in words like “decency,” must be preserved. Babamukuru chooses which parts of traditional culture and modernity (represented through colonial education and ways) Nyasha is to adopt and exhibit to maximize his status as colonial surrogate and de facto clan elder–a schema analogous to his acceptance of Maiguru’s earnings (the fruit of her Western education), while insisting on her compliance with the traditional requirement of wifely obedience. The claims of traditional society, of colonial and precolonial modes of production, and of western aesthetics on Nyasha’s body, I would argue, together produce her pathological response. Fanon’s contention that “colonialism in its essence was already taking on the aspect of a fertile purveyor for psychiatric disorders” (249) must be complicated by the observation that it is not only the colonial war Nyasha is fighting on the turf of her body but also a battle with the megalomaniacal patriarchal control represented by Babamukuru of whom she says: “Sometimes I feel like I am trapped by that man” (174). Her “anti-colonial” war, moreover, is complicated by her own collusion with the corrupt system she is fighting–her unwillingness to relinquish the accent acquired from her brief stay in England, her criticism of the racist dominion of colonizers while remaining standoffish with her compatriots at school, and the lack of effort at regaining her native language or contact with homestead relatives–visible to Tambu but unacknowledged, or unknown to her except in her sense of herself as “hybrid,” is also a factor in the war of ideas and values being narrativized on her corporeal bodily space. Nyasha, “who thrived on inconsistencies,” according to Tambu, seems to internalize the conflicts posed by her surroundings till her tongue, body, and mind seem together to want to carry the struggle to a dramatic conclusion (116).\n\nThe body under siege, then, is not surprisingly the space for resistance. Moreover, Nyasha has exhausted the options for legitimate engagement with oppression through official means. Having attempted and failed at reasoning with her father, no “usual” recourse remains. In her view, other adult women in the novel offer no viable alternatives. Nyasha is quite certain that her “mother doesn’t want to be respected. If people did that they’d have nothing to moan about” (78-79). Having witnessed her mother Maiguru’s feeble and feckless flutters for freedom, when she briefly runs away to her brother’s only to return five days later, 12 Nyasha, who elsewhere concedes that her mother is rather “sensible,” must look for other means of resistance. Maiguru’s state of “entrapment,” foretold for the reader in the very beginning of the novel, and reflected in her admission that she chose “security” over “self,” is precisely what Nyasha is seeking to avoid. Aunt Lucia, too, who is supposed to be an unmanageable free spirit and, commendably, rejects her paramour Takesure’s questionable support, ultimately disappoints Nyasha by resorting to propitiate Babamukuru. To Nyasha’s complaint that “she’s been groveling ever since she arrived to get Daddy to help her out. That sort of thing shouldn’t be necessary,” Lucia pragmatically responds, “Babamukuru wanted to be asked, so I asked. And now we both have what we wanted” (160). Nyasha fails to appreciate that Lucia’s strategies are essential to her. In the final tally, Maiguru, “married” to patriarchy, and Tambu’s mother, too tired and too traditional to engage in a sustained struggle with it, her mind never being hers to make up, remain trapped (153) while Tambu–with her “finely tuned survival system” (65), and Lucia are the ones who will “escape,” both having learned the value of survival and relative empowerment over enactments of dramatic protest, but effecting their escape in different ways. But then Nyasha does not have the benefit of hindsight endowed on the reader by Tambu’s prefiguring of the fate of the women in the story. Her critique of women’s ingratiating and subservient ways, however, is instructive.\n\nThe implication of women in oppressive cultural codes–the craft and guile evident in their quest for survival and advancement–is undeniably an issue here. Women provide the mainstay of patriarchal structures. In her novel, Le Pique-nique sur l’Acropole, Louky Bersianik presents a stunning embodiment of female complicity in the image of women as petrified pillars supporting the temple of Erectheion in Athens. Acropolis, the bastion and symbol of traditional Western patriarchal thought is the site of a long male banquet at which women have served as handmaidens. The homestead and the mission, too, are a picnic for men that women will cater. Maiguru, Lucia, and Tambu’s sporadic gestures of resistance are ultimately “permissible” infractions because they are followed by propitiatory gestures consonant with compliant performances of femininity and so do not seriously challenge the extant order; they “play” the system and attempt to prevail within rather than without it, ultimately gaining some modicum of satisfaction by way of security, a job, or an education–none of which, we are being told through Nyasha’s expostulations and actions, is adequate compensation. A propos of this issue, however, is the observation that Nyasha herself seems to decide to give in to Babamukuru’s authority because “it is restful to have him pleased (196). The strategies adopted by Maiguru and Lucia–and on occasion Nyasha herself–are survivalist in nature in contrast to her ultimate recourse to violent and destructive ones. Her seeming acquiescence toward her father–a survivalist tactic–is followed, however, by a more solipsistic, private regimen of rebellion: she tells Tambu “that she had embarked on a diet, to discipline [her] body and occupy [her] mind” (197). The diet and the disease become for her a holy mission; Rudolph Bell in Holy Anorexia “relates the disease to the religious impulses of medieval nuns, seeing starvation as purification” (qtd. in Wolf 189). To borrow Fanon’s words yet again, “this pathology is considered as a means whereby the organism responds to, in other words adapts itself to, the conflict it is faced with, the disorder being at the same time a symptom and a cure” (290). 13 Or as Wolf puts it, “The anorexic refuses to let the official cycle master her: By starving, she masters it” (198). Taking recourse to anorexia and bulimia then becomes for Nyasha a pathetic means of both establishing control over her body in the only way possible and relinquishing control by giving in to a learned western pathology.\n\nBut let us pause. There are two issues of import here: a.) rejection of food has already been read in terms beyond the vocabulary only of anorexia and bulimia; b.) it is not only food that is being rejected by the bodily organism. With regard to the first, let us remember that Tambu’s mother also abjures food to protest her departure for the mission at first, and then Sacred Heart because she thinks education and English-ness will kill Tambu as it has Nhamo (184). Before her departure for the mission, Tambu speculates that “at Babamukuru’s I would have the leisure . . . to consider questions that had to do with survival of the spirit, the creation of consciousness, rather than mere sustenance of the body,” the latter having been a considerable preoccupation for homestead women (59). That Nyasha can afford the luxury of refusing food is certainly relevant, but it becomes less significant in light of Mainini’s gesture. Refusal to eat is a time honored and cross-cultural form of protest. Gandhi’s program of Satyagraha 14 and fasting were pivotal in India’s fight for freedom. It is interesting to pose the case of a teenage girl, hyper-conscious of the territorial offenses against her, along the same spectrum of protest activity that accommodates Gandhi’s lofty project of non-cooperation. The difference is that female lives are usually confined to the private sphere; female protests usually do not find outlet in public ways although one might argue that “the distinction between what is public and what is private is always a subtle one,” especially if one reads the female body as implicated in the economy of male and societal desire (Strachey 66). And lest we overlook the obvious, Nyasha, after all, is only fourteen years old when she begins to stage her gestures of protest.\n\nHer rejection of food is linked to a whole set of other associated unpalatable realities: the anorexic herself tells us that the fuss is about something else altogether, “it’s more than that really, more than just food. That’s how it comes out, but really it’s all the things about boys and men and being decent and indecent and good and bad” (190). Nyasha’s commodity status in the sexual economy, for instance, is exposed implicitly through her anorexic behavior intended to erode the body and prevent its blossoming into womanhood; but it is also exposed explicitly in a discussion on “private parts” between the cousins. The suppression of her sexuality at the same time that she is being groomed for an equipoisal matrimonial market, her fear that a tampon is the only thing that will enter her vaginal orifice “at this rate,” and her recommendations, albeit playful, to Tambu about the relative advantages of losing one’s virginity to the sanitary device rather than to an insensitive braggart, suggest the disbalancement of the market system that would ensue, should the girls choose to transform sexual restriction into abstinence or “devalue” themselves by accidentally rupturing their precious membranes (119; 96). The threat is a potent one because virginity is desirable in unmarried women and functions symbolically, with “the powers and dangers credited to social structure reproduced in small on the human body” (Douglas 11). The vulvic crime Nyasha gestures at has the content of a vaginal betrayal of the patrimonial body of the state–it is the denial of heterosexual exchange, of the preservation of expected social narratives. While there is no textual evidence of her having lost her virginity thus, Nyasha’s larger project of making the body itself disappear by denying it nourishment tacitly promises to accomplish something of the same objective.\n\nTested, tried, and unsuccessful as “good girl,” it remains for Nyasha to fail as “good native.” Confronted with her “O” level exams, Nyasha transforms a test situation into a veritable trial of the soul, testing the very mettle of history. Attracted and repelled in almost equal measure by colonial educational and cultural systems, Nyasha reacts in a foreseeably conflicted manner to the variety of concerns weighing on her mind: she becomes obsessed with passing the exams which will test her on the colonizer’s version of knowledge even while she is aware that this education is a “gift” of her father’s status, and the “knowledge” itself is questionable. As her body spurns food, her mind is rejecting what the colonizers have called knowledge, and evincing a hysteric, physical revulsion to “their history. Fucking liars. Their bloody lies” (201). Nyasha’s “body language” is as loud and clear as her words for she is tearing her book to shreds with her teeth as she rages. But what is the substitute? Dangarembga explains that “one of the problems that most Zimbabwean people of my generation have is that we really don t have a tangible history we can relate to” (qtd. in Wilkinson 190-91). Not available to Nyasha are the (his)stories heard in whispers from the margins, in the brief accounts given by Tambu’s grandmother 15 who speaks of the history that “could not be found in the textbooks” (17), about the “wizards” who were avaricious and grasping and annexed Babamukuru’s spirit: “They thought he was a good boy, cultivable, in the way that land is, to yield harvests that sustain the cultivator” (19). The knowledge she has been fed is less easily digested by Nyasha than it is by the good native, Babamukuru, although he too, incidentally, suffers from bad nerves. Nyasha’s protest transpires exponentially: “They’ve trapped us. But I won’t be trapped. I’m not a good girl” (201). The moral content of “goodness,” like the symbolic content of “womanhood,” are recognized by Nyasha as inherently bankrupt. Her acute sensibility scans “goodness” as a managerial tool, rather than a moral imperative, that keeps women and natives in line. Ironically, Nyasha’s dramatic indictment of colonial education, delivered in the language and in an approximation of the accent of the colonizer, speaks eloquently of an embattled and muddled consciousness attempting to regain control. Nyasha fails in multiple ways as “good native”: both in her failure to accept the totality of colonial education and in her failure to renounce it completely.\n\nUltimately, then, food is only the metonymic representation of all that Nyasha cannot accept and understand. Her dwindling body boldly enacts the pervasive and aggregate suffering and bewilderment of colonized women caught between opposing as well as joined forces. Clearly, she also does not have the stomach for the deception and lies of the colonial project or the pathetic mimicry of this project by natives like Babamukuru and his confused and endearment mouthing consort, Maiguru. “It’s bad enough,” she laments, “when . . . a country gets colonised, but when the people do as well!” (147). Having learned the discourse of equality and freedom, young and confused though she might be, Nyasha recognizes that the native has failed to adopt the more salubrious aspects of Western humanism. The truth is that natives could learn different lessons from colonial education. Instead, the overwhelming preoccupation with food and food presentation, the “eyeing and coveting” of dresses outside the mission church, Tambu’s visualization of a convent education in terms of a smart and clean “white blouse and dark-red pleated terylene skirt, with blazer and gloves, and a hat” (183), the ritualized attention to hierarchy at gatherings, unbridled materialism and lust for goods and items of “comfort and ease and rest” evident in the mission as Tambu catalogues Babamukuru and Maiguru’s household effects (70), the incongruous adoption of western diet and the presence and prevalence of a servile, laboring class in the very hearth of the mission, among other symptoms of a community in crisis, testify to endemic class divisions heightened by a total capitulation to commodity fetishism. The embrace of selective items of Westernization by Babamukuru and others, even Nyasha, to the exclusion of its more useful possibilities is exposed throughout the novel. The potential for communicating the principles and values of Western education is clear to Babamukuru who does not approve of Tambu’s desire to go to the mostly white school because association with white people would cause girls “to have too much freedom,” a consequence incompatible with their eminently desirable development into “decent women” appropriate for the marriage market (180).\n\nAt the same time that the potential for emancipation promised by the colonial encounter is left frustrate by the natives’ refusal to accept the better part of western humanism, the failure of colonizers themselves to exercise those same principles which serve to legitimize their sense of superiority over “less civilized” natives is exposed through Nyasha’s revolt. Nadel and Curtis explain the psychology of colonial dominion in their introduction to Imperialism and Colonialism: “Underlying all forms of imperialism is the belief–at times unshakable–of the imperial agent or nation in an inherent right, based on moral superiority as well as material might, to impose its pre-eminent values and techniques on the ‘inferior’ indigenous nation or society” (1). In The Conquest of America: The Question of the Other, Tzvetan Todorov demonstrates that colonialism exerts its control by extending the principle of equality only when it withholds from its Others the principle of difference. Principles of democracy, freedom, and independence, that fueled the American and French revolutions as well as reforms in much of the Western world did not, for instance, stand in the way of colonialism. Nor did concessions to minorities in the developed world encourage officials to extend the same to colonized subjects. The excesses of African patriarchy, for instance, which repulsed European sensibilities, were tolerated “in the interest of colonial profit” while the condemnation of polygynous marriages resulted not from a concern for women but from a need “for the reproduction of the labor force” (Courville 38). These contradictions are glaringly obvious to young Nyasha. The colonizer’s formula for accommodating the native, as she astutely observes, is to create “an honorary space in which you could join them and they could make sure you behaved yourself” (178); “But, she insisted, one ought not to occupy that space. Really, one ought to refuse” (179).\n\nThe net impact of Nyasha’s “refusal” seems less important than that in her, Dangarembga has offered not only a textbook example of the havoc wrought by colonial and patriarchal systems, but a narrativization of the body itself in terms of conflict and resistance and its angry longing for a better, less perplexing world. In bodily terms, Nyasha almost succeeds in destroying herself, in achieving, if not the body without organs–which is admittedly unrealizable anyway, at least a grotesquely unhealthy remainder of her original self. The anorexic, after all, is effectively unwomanned and left a shell of herself: “the woman has been killed off in her. She is almost not there” (Wolf 197). But the woman that dies is the abject self that has never enjoyed the luxury of self-determination, that is no real woman but an insubstantial changeling who functions as token and currency in the labor and matrimonial market. Nyasha’s pathological persona enacts a multi-pronged assault on a complex and interwoven system th"
