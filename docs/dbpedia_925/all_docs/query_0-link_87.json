KILCOYNE\n\nSUIT Writer\n\nThe Army Reserve Officers Training Corps began\n\noperating last month at ECU. It already has 59 cadets\n\nin the basic course (freshman and sophomores) and\n\n32 in the advanced course (juniors and seniors), and\n\nwill exist alongside the already successful Air Force\n\nROTC.\n\nThe head of the Army program, Maj. Michael\n\nBishop, said that all signs indicate that his group's\n\nprogram will grow substantially in the next few years.\n\nStudent enrollees can choose two tracks in ROTC.\n\nIn the four year program, interested freshmen and\n\nsophomores can take the basic courses for six credit\n\nhours of military science without committing\n\nthemselves to joining ROTC. Next comes the advanc-\n\ned courses of sixteen credit hours in which a student\n\nformally joins AROTC.\n\nIn the two-year program, upperclassmen entered\n\nAROTC with the immediate service obligation of\n\nthree years after graduation. The basic and advanced\n\ncourses are combined in two years. In addition, two\n\nand three-year scholarships can be won by eligible\n\nstudents who have at least a 2.5 grade point average.\n\nThe scholarships pay for books, tuition and fees in\n\naddition to the $100 per month that all cadets receive\n\nfor the ten-month school year.\n\nCadets are civilian students who study whatever\n\nmajor and minor fields they wish. On graduation,\n\nthey are commissioned as second lieutenants and can\n\nenter active duty for three years. If they choose the\n\nnational guard or the reserves, the obligation is eight\n\nyears. Nurses, because they are in short supply, go in-\n\nto active service.\n\nSee AROTC, Page 6\n\nThe East Carolinian\n\nElections Set For Wednesday;\n\nShore Foresees No Problems\n\nROB POOL - Ptwte Lab\n\nSo What Else Is New?\n\nAn ECU policeman gives yet another traffic ticket\n\nto an illegally parked vehicle.\n\nBy PATRICK O'NEILL\n\nStart Writer\n\nThe second round of the SGA\n\nelections is set for Wednesday,\n\nwith 72 ECU students vying for\n\npositions from graduate class\n\npresident to day representative.\n\nTen students are running unop-\n\nposed, while six other positions,\n\nincluding junior class vice presi-\n\ndent, have no candidates on the\n\nballot. The election polls are\n\nlocated throughout campus and\n\nwill be open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nNewly appointed elections com-\n\nmittee chairman Walter Shore\n\nsaid he is confident that the ad-\n\nministrative problems which\n\nresulted in the cancellation of last\n\nmonth's SGA election results have\n\nbeen smoothed over. \"I don't\n\nforesee any problems on Wednes-\n\nday Shore said Monday.\n\n\"Things will run smooth this\n\ntime; we've gotten a lot of sup-\n\nport\n\nIn the previous election held on\n\nSept. 28, 20 candidates' names\n\nwere left off the ballot because\n\nthey had failed to file a financial\n\nstatement. But according to of-\n\nficial SGA election rules, failure\n\nto file the financial expense report\n\nis not grounds for disqualifica-\n\ntion. As a result, the first election\n\nwas declared void and the entire\n\nprocess was reconducted.\n\nGeneral Manager Leaves\n\nB PATRICK.

He was\n\nappointed to the position of\n\ngeneral manager in May of 1982\n\nas part of administrative restruc-\n\nturing effort which gave the\n\ngeneral manager complete respon-\n\nsibility of the business aspects of\n\nThe East Carolinian, while\n\nkeeping the post of a managing\n\neditor to oversee the editorial con-\n\ntent of the paper.

Wake County Commissioner\n\nBetty Ann Knudsen says it's time to start a new tradi-\n\ntion in the secretary of state's office by ending Thad\n\nEure's 46-year hold on the job.\n\nMrs. Knudsen announced Monday she will vie\n\nagainst the 83-year-old Eure next year for the\n\nDemocratic nomination. No Republicans have an-\n\nnounced their candidacy.\n\n\"I firmly believe North Carolinians deserve a\n\nsecretary of state who has a vision of the future, not\n\nwho is rooted in the past Mrs. Knudsen said in an\n\nannoucement at the Capitol.

She is expected to garner support\n\nfrom women's groups, and currently is the only\n\nwoman seeking any statewide elective office.\n\nEure won the secretary of state's office in 1936 and\n\nhas been a colorful part of state politics ever since.\n\nHe calls himself \"the oldest rat in the Democratic\n\nbarn\" and appears regularly at gatherings across\n\nNorth Carolina.\n\nHe has won re-election easily every four years since\n\nthen, except in 1976 when George W.

Watt stated it best when he said\n\nin his resignation letter to Presi-\n\ndent Reagan'the time has come\n\nNever has Watt said anything bet-\n\nter. His and the administration's\n\npro-developmental policies have\n\nangered many, and we, like many\n\nothers, are glad to see him go. On-\n\nly, unlike Watt, we thought the\n\ntime had come a long time ago.\n\nUnfortunately, his leaving does\n\nnot mean the end to what he stood\n\nfor. Because, ultimately, the per-\n\nson responsible for what the In-\n\nterior Secretary did is still sitting in\n\nthe Oval Office. Both Reagan and\n\nWatt symbolize the heart of true\n\ncapitalist Republicanism: the pro-\n\nmotion of individual enterprise\n\nunhindered by regulations design-\n\ned to help the environment. The\n\nman firing the gun may be gone,\n\nbut, regretfully, the gun is still\n\nthere ? and loaded.\n\nWe are not against free enter-\n\nprise. A system where the poorest\n\nman can become rich because of\n\nhis ingenuity and hard work is, in\n\nour eyes, the best system. Yet,\n\nunregulated use of the environ-\n\nment for pure monetary gain is just\n\nnot possible in an era where\n\nnatural beauty has become an en-\n\ndangered species. However, we,\n\nlike many others, realize the\n\nsecretary didn't leave because he\n\nhad been raping the land; he left\n\nbecause he had incurable hoof-in-\n\nmouth disease.\n\nEnvironmentalists who have\n\nbeen clamoring for Watt's resigna-\n\ntion even before he was in office\n\nshould find little solace that the\n\noutspoken secretary is gone. In\n\nfact, they weren't the ones that\n\npushed him out of office. The\n\nSierra Club, which had a petition\n\ncalling for his resignation signed\n\nby an astronomical amount of peo-\n\nple, wasn't able to budge him. The\n\nAmerican public, which con-\n\nsistently gave Watt the lowest\n\nrating of any member of Reagan's\n\nCabinet, didn't cause his leaving.\n\nIt was Watt and the press. In the\n\nend he was a liability to the presi-\n\ndent. But, the man that is gone will\n\nsoon be replaced with someone\n\nwho believes exactly the same\n\nthing.\n\nSo, there is only one thing that\n\nwe can truly do if we want to\n\nchange the federal government's\n\nenvironmental policy ? keep\n\nReagan from winning a second\n\nterm. For those of you who care\n\nenough about the environment to\n\nwant to save it, get out and vote ?\n\nfor anybody but Reagan, but\n\nespecially for a candidate who\n\nbelieves in protecting our precious\n\nnatural resources.\n\nYou Can't Gripe\n\nStudents do not deserve the right\n\nto gripe about student govern-\n\nment. Sure, they pay the man-\n\ndatory fee, and sure they go to\n\nschool, but when fewer than 15\n\npercent of the student body votes\n\nin elections and seats in the\n\nlegislature go unfilled, its time to\n\nreevaluate the accountability of the\n\nlegislators to their \"constituency\n\nWhenever there's a problem\n\nwith one of the school year's elec-\n\ntions, students read about it in the\n\npaper and say, \"Those people\n\nshouldn't be there. They shouldn't\n\nbe trusted with my money Well,\n\nthe majority of these people are\n\nwrong. Of course, those entrusted\n\nwith running the SGA can't be\n\nscrewing up all the time. (And they\n\ndon't.) But, the average apathetic\n\nstudent who doesn't get up off his\n\nbutt to go and vote or run for\n\n(fill?) a seat in the legislature\n\ndoesn't deserve the right to ques-\n\ntion what those on the second floor\n\nof Mendenhall are doing.\n\nWhat we are basically trying to\n\nsay is let's, as educated adults, par-\n\nticipate in our electoral process ?\n\nwhether on a national or university\n\nscale.

The country is run by a\n\nwhite regime that makes up only 17 per-\n\ncent of the population but controls the\n\nnation's wealth and government and\n\nkeeps its citizens classified by apartheid,\n\na racial segregation system.\n\nEvery citizen, according to the\n\ngovernment, falls into one of four racial\n\ngroups: white, coloured, asian or (black)\n\nAfrican. The classification is important,\n\nfor it determines the entire route of the\n\nrest of one's life in South Africa. The\n\narea in which one can live, the education\n\none can receive, the jobs one can hold\n\nand the wages one will earn are all defin-\n\ned by racial classification. No race may\n\nmix with any other.\n\nSo, how can Americans, and\n\nAmerican companies, justify dealing\n\nwith this nation that blatantly practices\n\neverything we have fought against for\n\nyears? Can the simple profit motive\n\njustify American investment in a coun-\n\ntry that treats its black citizens no better\n\nthan the Soviet Union treats its citizens?\n\nIt is a moral question facing Americans\n\nand particularly American investors, for\n\nU.S. firms do business in South Africa\n\nto the tune of $1.5 billion a year, making\n\nthe United States the third largest\n\ntrading partner of South Africa.\n\nOne American businessman, an ex-\n\necutive with Coca-Cola who dealt much\n\nwith his company's South African\n\nThe Truth Of\n\nRepercussions\n\nBy GLENN MAUGHAN\n\nThe shooting down of Korean Airlines\n\nflight 007 by the Soviet Union happened\n\nmore than a month ago. At this point, is\n\nis clear that neither Soviet or U.S.\n\nleaders are going to budge from their\n\npositions regarding the tragic incident.\n\nNews of the black box is now relegated\n\nto the back pages; perhaps the full story,\n\ndare I say \"the truth will never be\n\nknown.\n\nIt is now time for the world to really\n\ntake a look at this incident and tke note\n\nof the probable repercussions the event\n\nwill have on us all.\n\nShortly after the incident, Soviet\n\npolicy expert Andrew Cockburn was\n\nasked what impact he thought the\n\nshooting down of the jet would have on\n\nAmericans. He quickly responded the\n\nincident would cost us $25 billion.\n\nCockburn figured $25 billion in addi-\n\ntional defense expenditures could be\n\npushed through Congress by President\n\nReagan now that the Soviets have shown\n\ntheir \"true colors The \"evil empire\"\n\nimage of the Soviets is as stark as ever.\n\nA recent headline in the The New\n\nYork Times, \"Reagan Rides the Crest\n\nOf An Anti-Soviet Wave suggests the\n\npresident is going to use this incident as\n\nan excuse to justify events which could\n\nresult in the escalation of the nuclear\n\narms race and increased U.S. military\n\nadventurism around the globe.\n\nA case in point is Reagan's recent vic-\n\ntory regarding the continued presence of\n\nU.S. Marines in the Middle East. Some\n\nanalysts predict Reagan will begin\n\nsimilar efforts to increase military ac-\n\ntivities in Central America.\n\n\"When we came into office, one of\n\nour primary missions was to get\n\nAmericans out of the 'Vietnam Syn-\n\ndrome' and get them accustomed again\n\nto the idea that projecting power\n\noverseas can help the cause of peace\n\nan administration official said in the\n\nTimes story. \"Well, it's worked. There's\n\na consensus on Capitol Hill in favor of\n\nkeeping American troops in a battle\n\noperations, has come to justify his\n\nbusiness in the world's most racist coun-\n\ntry on more than just monetary terms.\n\nHe visited the Coca-Cola facilities as\n\nrecently as last March and was in Chapel\n\nHill last weekend attending a conference\n\non the history and policy of South\n\nAfrica.\n\nHe explained that his company began\n\nits operations in South Africa in 1939, at\n\ntime when Americans saw nothing\n\nwrong with the white minority govern-\n\nment, for U.S policy at home enforced\n\nmuch less than liberty and justice for all.\n\nLater, after the United States affected\n\nslow changes in its policies toward\n\nracism, and the South African govern-\n\nment seemed to mesh less easily with\n\nU.S. ideals, Coca-Cola stopped putting\n\nmoney into its South African operation.\n\nThey have not expanded their operation\n\nsince the early days, but neither have\n\nthey discontinued it altogether. Com-\n\npanies cannot pull out of nations every\n\ntime policy changes or an unfavorable\n\ngovernment comes to power, the ex-\n\necutive explained.\n\nIf U.S. companies pulled out of every\n\ncountry that had human rights viola-\n\ntions, he explained, there would be few\n\nplaces for American business outside\n\nEurope. He cited Argentina and the\n\nPhilippines as two examples of nations\n\nwith whom the United States probably\n\nshould not, on moral grounds, do\n\nbusiness.\n\nFurther, he explained, if his company\n\ndid divest, they would have to sell their\n\nfactory and operations in South Africa,\n\nprobably to the white South African\n\ngovernment. The white regime certainly\n\nwould not continue Coke's example of\n\nemployee business practices. They\n\nwould instead simply spread their racist\n\nnational policy to that work site as well.\n\nYou see, Coca-Cola considers itself a\n\ngood example in South Africa, a son oi\n\ncivilized exception doing benevolent\n\nwork among heathens. Not because of\n\nthe ineffective and largely cosmetic\n\nSullivan principles, in which American\n\ncompanies promise non-segregation and\n\nfair work practices, but because of its\n\npersonal employee policy. As the ex\n\necutive said, \"1 feel South Africa is a lit-\n\ntle better place for us having been\n\nthere\n\nCoca-Cola offers loans, including\n\nhome mortgages, to its employees, as\n\nwell as school scholarships lo\n\nemployees' children, skill training for\n\nworkers and promotions within the com-\n\npany that would not occur under South\n\nAfrica's regular \"Job Reservation Act,1'\n\nin which the best jobs are reserved for\n\nwhites. All this in a country where two-\n\nthirds of black Africans live in sub-\n\nstandard housing below the poverty tine,\n\nwhere the educational funds for blacks\n\nare one-tenth that for whites and many\n\nsubjects or training are not offered in\n\nblack schools.\n\nNo, Coca-Cola does not, he said, sup-\n\nport the South African government. It is\n\nnot expanding its operation there, but is\n\nmaintaining what it already established.\n\nin hopes that it is helping the lives of its\n\nemployees more than the South African\n\ngovernment. He is not happy with the\n\nracist white regime, but he has worked\n\nout a personal justification for doing\n\nbusiness in South Africa.\n\nFlight 007 Still Unknown;\n\nShouldn't Aid Arms Race\n\nzone. There's been a significant at-\n\nmospheric change in general\n\nIt's a fact the Korean incident makes\n\nit harder for many Americans to trust\n\nthe Russians. Even though the plane\n\nflew deep into Korean territory, the in-\n\nitial Soviet cover-up of the incident has\n\nleft many of us with a lot of questions.\n\nHowever, I don't think people should\n\nview this incident as an excuse for the\n\nUnited States to dump billions more\n\ndollars into the arms race. In fact, the\n\nresponse should be just the opposite.\n\nEven more wierd is the fact we have\n\nalways viewed Russia with a wary eye; so\n\nnow, with all the bellicose rhetoric, one\n\nmight believe we thought they were once\n\nthe \"good guys\" in the first place.\n\nBecause most college students are of\n\ndraft-registering age, any power Reagan\n\nis likely to project overseas will be done\n\nwith your bodies.

There was something\n\nabout those two wide, white\n\nstripes running parallel over\n\nhood, roof and rear deck that\n\nmade my heart race and my palms\n\nsweat. Whoever first called such\n\nmarkings racing stripes must have\n\nfelt the same excitement I did.\n\nlust above the kickpanel from\n\nfront to rear wheelwall ran a nar-\n\nrow white stripe bordered by two\n\nthinner ones. At the head of these\n\nstripes in white three-inch letters\n\nwas \"GT-350\n\nThe car sat lower than a normal\n\n'f6 Mustang because of its low-\n\nprofile 60-series tires and altered\n\nfront suspension geometry. The\n\nangular, masculine lines of the\n\nfenders and body contrasted nice-\n\nly with the arc that began with the\n\nwindshield, crested through the\n\nroof and tapered through the rear\n\nglass into the trunk deck. Both\n\nround and square, the overall ef-\n\nfect was that of a giant, red and\n\nwhite hockey puck. I wondered if\n\nit would scoot like one.\n\nWhen I looked inside, I was\n\nstartled to see the backseat miss-\n\ning. In its place as a black\n\nfiberglass deck with the spare tire\n\nsnugged onto it. A four-point\n\npadded roll bar erupted from the\n\nfloor behind the bucket seats and\n\nstretched to the ceiling while its\n\ntwo back legs slanted into the cor-\n\nners of the rear deck. 1 slid into\n\nthe driver's seat to check out the\n\ncockpit.\n\nA pod-mounted Sun tach stared\n\nat me like some Cyclops' eye from\n\nits angled position atop the center\n\nof the dash. The rest of the\n\ngauges. including the\n\nspeedometer, were all by Stewart\n\nWarner. There was no radio.\n\nWith no backseat or jam box, this\n\nobviously wasn't a Saturday night\n\ndate machine. When I raised the\n\nhood, it was apparent that the\n\nShelby would be more at home on\n\nthe backstretch at Sebring than\n\ntooling around some burger joint.\n\n\"She's a beauty isn't she said\n\nthe dealer, who was suddenly\n\nstanding at my shoulder. \"Two\n\n460 Holly fours, Ford dual-point\n\ndistributer, Le Mans 289 cam,\n\nGT-40 valves, finned aluminum\n\nracing pan, balanced and\n\nblueprinted.

Stone was sell-\n\ning the Shelby on commission\n\nsome sap who was going\n\na nasty divorce, and. as he ex-\n\nplained, he took every opportuni-\n\nty tc drive the car.\n\nThe instant Stone hit the\n\nstarter, the engine busted to\n\nand sat there idling at 1500 rpm.\n\nWe rumbled up King Street in :\n\nand second gears, the car jerk\n\nlow speeds. Whenever Stone pull-\n\ned away from the stoplight, it was\n\ndifficult for him not to chirp the\n\ntires. Driving the car in town\n\nlike leading a mad bull with a nose\n\nring. Finally we came to the steep\n\nentrance ramp to 1-26 Stone ;\n\nched the accelerator with the car\n\nin first. As we shot up the ramp 1\n\nfelt like Eve! Knevel blasting\n\nacross the Snake River. Stone\n\nwound the engine to seven grand,\n\nand when he shifted we were do-\n\ning \"0. The rear tires bit into the\n\npavement and the Shelbv jumped\n\nforward, accelerating through se-\n\ncond. At 95. Stone shifted to\n\nthird, backed off the gas and then\n\nshifted to fourth. Our little red\n\nrocket coasted back down to 65.\n\nAs we passed cars, heads turn-\n\ned. We went by a couple of\n\nCitadel cadets in a red Alfa\n\nRomeo spyder. They fell in\n\nbehind us pointing and talking\n\nand then pulled along side to stare\n\nsome more. Stone downshiftec\n\nsecond and the Shelby shot for-\n\nward as though hurled from a\n\ncatapult. We weaved through the\n\nsix-lane traffic for another mile\n\nducking around station wagons\n\nand 18 wheelers at better than\n\n100. Then he threw the Shelby on-\n\nto an exit ramp that corkscrewed\n\ndown to an underpass. The car\n\ngrowled through the tightening\n\nspiral, its tail hanging slightly out.\n\nwithout a trace of body lean.\n\nI suddenly knew that I had to\n\nhave the car. I had to hae it We\n\ngot down to price dickering back\n\nat the lot Stone started at six\n\ngrand. When he finally accepted\n\nthat I was about as poor as I was\n\nyoung, he gave me the bottom\n\nline: $4,000 for the owner plus his\n\n$200 sales commission. I told him\n\nto give me a couple of days to see\n\nwhat I could dig up and gave him\n\n$100 to hold the car.\n\n??\"???\"????????????B ????????\n\nBanks won 7 finance a\n\nclassic car, not even\n\nHitler's Mercedes.\n\nI soon found that banks won't\n\nfinance a classic car, not even if\n\nit's Hitler's Mercedes One loan\n\nofficer after another declined the\n\nopportunity to finance a 12-year-\n\nold Mustang.

The\n\nPirates moved to a 4-1 record,\n\nwhile the Cajuns suffered their\n\nfourth defeat.\n\nIt took a 63-yard ECU drive in\n\nthe fourth quarter for the Pirates\n\nto run back the Cajuns before\n\n27,345 fans at Ficklen Stadium ?\n\nECU's fifth largest crowd ever.\n\nBaker capped the drive with a\n\none-yard touchdown run with\n\n7:30 remaining.\n\n\"We didn't take this game\n\nlightly, but we just didn't play\n\nwith as much intensity as we have\n\nin our last several games Baker\n\nsaid.\n\nEast Carolina led 14-3 at\n\nhalftime, but three second-half\n\nfumbles resulted in two Cajun\n\ntouchdowns.\n\n\"Every game we've had to fight\n\nfor our lives in the fourth\n\nquarter Emory said. \"I don't\n\nknow if they brought fumblitis in\n\nhere or what.\n\n\"I didn't think it would be as\n\nbad as 1980 when we set a recrod\n\nfor fumbles in a quarter with five\n\nin the third quarter against this\n\nteam. Last time, we had five\n\nfumbles against them. But we go\n\nin the second half and try to beat\n\nthat damn record\n\nECU had a chance to build a\n\ncomfortable lead early in the se-\n\ncond half, but the Pirates' Ernest\n\nByner fumbled on a first-and-goal\n\nsituation at the Cajuns' seven-\n\nyard line.\n\nThe Cajuns recovered another\n\nECU fumble that launched a\n\n57-yard drive ending in fullback\n\nThomas Jackson's 37-yard\n\ntouchdown run with 37 seconds\n\nleft in the third period. Backup\n\nquarterback Donnie Schexnider\n\nthen passed to Jackson in the end-\n\nzone for a two-point conversion.\n\nThe Pirates then fumbled at\n\ntheir 36, setting up a five-yard\n\ntouchdown pass from Schexnider\n\nto tight end Zachary Dennis that\n\ngave USL an 18-14 lead.\n\nECU responded by taking the\n\nensuing kick-off 63 yards in 13\n\nplays, capped by Baker's one-yard\n\nscoring plunge.\n\nAfter stopping the Cajun of-\n\nfense and regaining the ball, ECU\n\ngave SW Louisiana one more\n\nchance when Baker fumbled. But\n\nthe Cajuns were unable to move\n\nbeyond their 44.\n\nEmory, who credited ECU's\n\ndefense for last week's 13-6 vic-\n\ntory over Missouri, was not as\n\ncomplimentary after this game. \"I\n\nthought we looked sluggish on\n\ndefense Emory said. \"We just\n\ndidn't tackle\n\nECU free safety Clint Harris\n\nagreed. \"Defensively, this was\n\nour worst game of the year. We\n\ndidn't play like we're capable of,\n\nbut we stopped them when we had\n\nto. I think this game could be con-\n\nsidered our midseason slump\n\nEmory, on the other hand, said\n\nthe Pirates don't have time for\n\nmidseason slumps. \"We can't\n\ntaper off he said. \"If we don't\n\nget better, we don't have a\n\nchance. There's just no reason to\n\nhave a midseason slump after four\n\nweeks.\n\n\"It's the mark of a man to sus-\n\ntain their intensity and motiva-\n\ntion. I don't expect my staff,\n\nplayers or anybody else"
