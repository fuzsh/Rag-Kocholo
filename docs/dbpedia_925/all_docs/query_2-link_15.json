        "text": "FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nRevco is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ANAC Holding Corporation (\"ANAC\"). Revco and its subsidiaries operate approximately 2000 retail drug stores in 28 states. NYLIC owns $75 million of preferred stock in ANAC. NYLIC appeals from an order entered by the bankruptcy court on August 24, 1988, approving an agreement for debtor-in-possession financing and adequate protection. In particular, NYLIC challenges the authorization of periodic payments of interest on very substantial pre-petition indebtedness.\n\nPursuant to an indenture (the \"Indenture\") dated as of August 15, 1985, as amended, between Revco and Mellon Bank, Mellon became the trustee for the holders of 11 3/4% sinking fund debentures issued by Revco in the aggregate principal amount of $125 million.\n\nPursuant to certain loan agreements (the \"Credit Agreements\") entered into in 1986 between the Banks and Revco, the Banks agreed to lend money to Revco. 2 ANAC, on behalf of Revco, guaranteed the performance of these Credit Agreements. To secure the indebtedness arising under the Credit Agreements, Revco granted the Banks security interests in and liens and mortgages upon substantially all of Revco's property and other assets.\n\nIn accordance with certain requirements of the Indenture, the security interest and liens and mortgages upon the collateral granted to the Banks were conveyed in trust to secure the obligations to the Banks arising under the Credit Agreements and the obligations to the indenture trustee, on an equal and ratable basis. It is undisputed that the debt owed to the Banks and indenture trustee is fully secured.\n\nOn July 28, 1988, Revco filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. After filing the petition in bankruptcy, Revco was faced with a dilemma prompted by the forthcoming holiday season, its major sales period. As a result of the Banks' liens, all of Revco's cash in Chapter 11 constituted \"cash collateral\" of the Banks, and thus Revco could not use its cash without the Banks' consent or a court order. See 11 U.S.C. Sec. 363(c)(2). Moreover, Revco was unable to obtain credit from its trade creditors, most of whom placed it on a cash-on-delivery or cash-in-advance basis. Without cash or new credit, Revco could neither rebuild its extremely low inventories for the critical Christmas sales period nor replenish its pharmaceutical departments.\n\nRevco, therefore, sought debtor-in-possession financing from several lenders. Revco, however, was unable to obtain unsecured credit on any terms and several lenders refused to consider a proposal without time to study Revco's situation. Revco also was unable to obtain adequate credit secured by security interests or liens junior to the existing security interests or by liens on the few remaining unencumbered properties of the estate. Because Revco's principal assets were subject to the liens and security interests of the Banks and the indenture trustee, all of the proposals received by Revco for debtor-in-possession financing contemplated the granting of a superpriority lien under section 364(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nRevco concluded that the best financing terms were offered by Wells Fargo Bank and Marine Midland Bank (the \"DIP Lenders\"). 3 Revco and the DIP Lenders bargained at arms' length over the terms and conditions of an agreement entitled \"Stipulation and Agreement Regarding Debtor-in-Possession Financing, Use of Cash Collateral and Adequate Protection\" (the \"Stipulation\"). This agreement provided for the extension of credit on terms that were more favorable than Revco could have obtained from any other source. Under the Stipulation, the DIP Lenders agreed to provide Revco with $145 million in post-petition credit and to allow Revco to use existing cash collateral in the course of its Chapter 11 operations. Pursuant to the Stipulation, Revco agreed to grant a superpriority lien to the DIP Lenders senior to the lien of the Banks and indenture trustee. (Their former debt was therefore also subordinated). The Stipulation also allowed Revco to grant a pari passu first priority lien to secure post-petition trade credit as inducement for trade creditors to extend credit.\n\nRevco recognized, and the indenture trustee noted, that pursuant to section 363 it could not use cash collateral unless the Banks and indenture trustee consented or unless the court authorized such use and provided \"adequate protection\" to the Banks and the indenture trustee. The indenture trustee also noted that pursuant to section 364(d)(1) Revco could not grant a superpriority lien to the DIP Lenders unless the court authorized such a lien and provided \"adequate protection\" to the Banks and the indenture trustee as existing secured creditors. See 11 U.S.C. Sec. 364(d)(1).\n\nTo provide adequate protection to the Banks and the indenture trustee, Revco proposed to make periodic payments equal to the contractual interest accruing on Revco's pre-petition obligations to the Banks under the Credit Agreements and to the indenture trustee under the Indenture. This proposal avoided the possibility of higher default interest under the terms of the preexisting security agreement.\n\nRevco filed a motion requesting the bankruptcy court to enter an order approving the Stipulation within a week of filing its bankruptcy petition. NYLIC, as owner of preferred stock, objected to the Stipulation, and particularly to Revco's proposal to pay accruing interest to the Banks and indenture trustee as \"adequate protection.\"\n\nThe final hearing on the motion to approve the Stipulation was not scheduled until after the appointment of official creditors' committees pursuant to Section 1102 of the Bankruptcy Code. The committees obtained counsel, reviewed the Stipulation and discussed it with Revco and the Banks. Within a month of the bankruptcy filing, the bankruptcy court held a hearing to review the Stipulation and NYLIC's objection to the Stipulation. Representatives of both creditors' committees appeared at the hearing and supported the Stipulation, as did Revco's common stockholders. NYLIC was the sole objector.\n\nNYLIC supported Revco's obtaining the loan but it objected to the fact that the Banks were to be paid prepetition interest under the Credit Agreements. The bankruptcy court approved the Stipulation and specifically decided that the payment of accruing interest was appropriate as adequate protection. 4"
