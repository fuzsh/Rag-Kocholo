Having lost out on bids for two energy companies, the chairman and president of Red Eagle Resources Corp. decided his outfit was too small to compete against better-heeled rivals. So on Aug. 30, Johnson announced that he would sell the Oklahoma City oil and gas producer he had founded in 1977 to competitor Lomak Petroleum Inc. for $38.3 million. \"It was a shock to everyone who knew me that I parted with my baby,\" says the laconic 62-year-old former roughneck.\n\nWell, maybe dot everyone. Red Eagle's stock shot up 16%, to $5.50, the day before the $7.94-a-share deal was made public. And trading volume in the stock on Aug. 29--16,500 shares--was more than triple the norm. The American Stock Exchange promptly launched an inquiry. \"Where there are a lot of people involved in a deal,\" Johnson sighs, \"you have to believe in the tooth fairy to think there isn't leakage.\""
