        "text": "FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b) and General Order of Reference 84 of the Northern District of Ohio.

The responsibility for the property is now yours and the undersigned assumes no further responsibility as to this property. You should take any necessary action to protect your interests in the property.\n\n9.

Mr. Ingber obtained insurance on the Premises without knowing if the Premises were already adequately insured under the Sublease. Tr., pp. 152-153.\n\n18. Kandist presented the testimony of Howard Bieber, vice-president of distribution at Revco. Mr. Bieber testified that in March, 1988 Revco decided to close the Premises and Revco did not tell Kandist it had closed and vacated the Premises until October 24, 1988. Tr., pp. 163-165.\n\nISSUE 1\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nRevco asserts that the Sublease was rejected on October 24, 1988 by dispatching to Kandist a letter declaring its intention to surrender the Premises and seek court approval of the rejection. Kandist asserts that rejection of the Sublease did not occur until December 13, 1988, when the Bankruptcy Court, after notice and a hearing, approved the rejection. Nationwide Insurance Company filed a memorandum in support of Kandist's position.\n\nKandist cites an exhaustive list of cases in support of its position that court approval is necessary for an effective rejection of a lease. Revco primarily relies on the case In re 1 Potato 2, Inc., 58 B.R. 752 (Bankr. D.Minn. ) for its position that court approval is not a prerequisite to an effective rejection.\n\nUpon review of the relevant case law on this issue as well as the presentations of counsel at the hearing and the pleadings submitted, it is the conclusion of this Court that approval of the Bankruptcy Court is necessary for an effective rejection of a lease and therefore, December 13, 1988, the date the Court approved the rejection of the Sublease, is the effective date of the rejection of the Sublease in the instant case.\n\nSection 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 365(a), governs rejection of unexpired leases and states in pertinent part:\n\nThe trustee, subject to the court\\'s approval, may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.1\n\nUnilateral acts or decisions of a debtor do not constitute a rejection of a lease. The requirement of express court approval in order to reject an executory contract or unexpired lease under section 365(a) is well supported by case law. In re Hejco, Inc., 87 B.R. 80, 82 (Bankr.D.Neb. ); Guardian Equipment Corp. v. Whiteside (In re Guardian Equipment Corp.), 18 B.R. 864, 867 ..."
