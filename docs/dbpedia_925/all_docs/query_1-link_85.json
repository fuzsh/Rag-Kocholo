        "text": "The Rite Aid Corporation is expected to announce today that it is acquiring Revco D.S. Inc. in a cash and stock deal valued at $1.8 billion.\n\nThe acquisition, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, would cement Rite Aid's position as the largest drugstore chain in the country, creating a company with $11 billion in revenues and more than 4,500 stores.\n\nThe managed care industry is driving our business, and we want to be in a position to offer them the most convenient low-cost service they can find,\" Martin L. Grass, chairman and chief executive of Rite Aid, said in an interview last night. \"The expanded capacity this merger will give us will make us the best-positioned retail drugstore chain in the country to meet the challenges that changes in the medical industry are bringing.\"\n\nRite Aid has been looking for a way to make its Eagle Managed Care subsidiary, a prescription benefits management company, competitive in an era when large drug companies have been buying up prescription management services. In recent years, Merck has acquired Medco and Eli Lilly has bought PCS Health Systems Inc., creating huge drug distribution networks that threaten independent operators like Eagle.\n\nAs part of the biggest drugstore chain in the country, however, Eagle will be able to stand up to such giants, Mr. Grass contended. \"This starts to level the playing field and even give us an advantage,\" he said. \"Would you rather buy drugs from prescription management companies allied with a major pharmaceutical manufacturer who have an interest in pushing that manufacturer's products or with someone independent like Eagle?\"\n\nMr. Grass said the combined companies would be able to take advantage of Rite Aid's advanced computer system and extend Revco's mail-order drug business.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
