        "text": "The Twinsburg, Ohio, headquarters of Revco D.S. Inc. will be phased out by the end of the year, six months after the drugstore retailer's sale to CVS Corp. is expected to be completed, a CVS executive said Tuesday.\n\nThomas M. Ryan, vice chairman and chief operating officer of CVS Corp., said he would tell that to Revco employees this week during a two-day visit with workers at the Twinsburg headquarters and regional offices.Ryan said he would come back to workers in six weeks with a timetable that outlined how the closing would unfold.\n\n``I'm going to be open and honest,' said Ryan, who also plans visits to Revco workers in Cleveland, Indianapolis and Charlotte, N.C.\n\nThe Woonsocket retail drug chain said Friday it would acquire Revco in a stock deal worth about $2.9 billion. CVS will also take on about $900 million of Revco's debt.\n\nThe deal, which must be approved by shareholders and the Federal Trade Commission, is expected to be completed in the summer.\n\nThat will eliminate the jobs of approximately 950 workers at Revco's headquarters, plus another 150 employees in the field.\n\nCVS has said it will honor severance packages to Revco workers and supply them with outplacement help where possible.\n\nRyan, a 44-year-old former CVS pharmacist, said talking to workers in Twinsburg will be the toughest part of the upcoming trip. ``They did a remarkable job,' he said.\n\nHowever, for the thousands of Revco store employees, pharmacists and regional managers who will have a new employer in CVS, the transition will be ``fairly seamless,' Ryan said.\n\n``I think the real change in their lives will be stripping away their uncertainty,' he said Tuesday in an interview in Woonsocket. ``I think they've been treading water for a year.'\n\nRevco workers have been in a cyclone of uncertainty tracing back to the company's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1988. When majority shareholder Sam Zell's Zell/Chilmark Fund provided the revenue to bring the company out of bankruptcy, it left open the possibility of a change in ownership.\n\nRevco workers thought that day had arrived last year, when Rite Aid Corp. of Camp Hill, Pa., made a $27.50-per-share bid for the company. However, that deal eventually disintegrated over FTC antitrust concerns.\n\nRevco customers won't see a name change at their store for a year and a half after the deal closes, Ryan said. The name changes will be rolled out market by market rather than all at once, he said.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
