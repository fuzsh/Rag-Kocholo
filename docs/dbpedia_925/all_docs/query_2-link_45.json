        "text": "For 19 years, the Revco-Cleveland Marathon has been a springtime civic celebration. But participants wondered if this year's race, scheduled for May 5, might be the last--the victim of the local drugstore chain's merger with rival Rite Aid Corp.\n\nIt was a close one. Thanks largely to the Federal Trade Commission, the marathon--and Revco D.S. Inc.--will remain in business. On Apr. 24, Rite Aid withdrew its offer, bowing to FTC complaints that the new drugstore chain would control too much of the market in nine states. The unexpected decision may have been good news to 10,000 marathon runners, but it has complicated the economic future of a company that had planned to vanish from the corporate scene. Executives had been scouting for new positions. Expansion plans were shelved. And modernization of acquired stores ground to a halt. \"They thought they were dead, and have been laying on a slab for five months,\" says Mark A. Husson, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. \"They have to get off a slab and start moving again.\""
