He added\n\nthat it was less than the 1981-82\n\nschool year, but the cuts were not as\n\ndeep as expected.\n\nLast week, Edward Elmendorf,\n\nacting assistant secretary for\n\npostsecondary education, announc-\n\ned the Reagan adminstration's stu-\n\ndent aid proposal for the 1983-84\n\nschool year.\n\nThe proposal is similar to the plan\n\nsubmitted last year by the ad-\n\nministration that was rejected by\n\nCongress and calls for a 50-percent\n\ncut in federal student aid programs.\n\nAccording to Elmendorf, the ad-\n\nminstration wants to abolish four\n\nstudent aid programs: Auxilary\n\nLoans, State Student Incentive\n\nGrants, Supplemental Educational\n\nOpprotunity Grants and National\n\nDirect Student Loans.\n\nThe administration proposed\n\neliminating the same programs last\n\nyear, but Congress rejected the idea.\n\nThe administration did get rid of\n\nStudent Social Security, however.\n\nAccording to Boudreaux, the ad-\n\nministration recommended $1.4\n\nbillion to be allocated for the Pell\n\nGrant program next year, while the\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee\n\nwants to continue last year's figure\n\nof approximately $2.4 billion.

When Brannon asked\n\nInstead of fining Hinton the usual\n\n5-15 dollars, which Brannon calls\n\n\"a slap on the wrist and also in-\n\nstead of handing the case over to ci-\n\nty officials, who could give Hinton a\n\nmaximum of six months in jail\n\nandor a fine of $500, Brannon sent\n\nthe case to the Student Honor\n\nCouncil.\n\nAccording to SGA Attorney\n\nwhich cites \"Jobs, Peace and\n\nEquality\" as its major goals.\n\n\"We thought it was very impor-\n\ntant to demonstrate in Helms'\n\nbackyard, to let people know that\n\nthere is opposition to the policies\n\ncoming out of the Congressional\n\nClub and the Reagan administra-\n\ntion said Ted Johnson, a coor-\n\ndinator of the federation's Chapel\n\nHarry Dest, the student public Hill chapter. \"It's crucial to show\n\ndefender who represented Hinton,\n\nsaid, \"I think they are using Mr.\n\nHinton's case as an example to the\n\nstudents ? they're trying to set a\n\nprecedent\n\nDest said that Hinton said his act\n\nwas not volitious. \"He did not mean\n\nto set the alarm off\n\nHinton received the maximum\n\nthat Reagan, Helms, East and the\n\nrest of them don't have the mandate\n\nthat they claim Johnson con-\n\ntinued. \"There is opposition ?\n\nthere are poeple calling for jobs,\n\npeace and equality\n\nThe federation, which sponsored\n\na similar protest earlier this month\n\nwhen Vice President George Bush\n\nGeneral Mike Swaim the \"typical\" penalty possible from the Honor ???\n\npunishment for defendents accused Council for an offense of this type, was in the area, held their peaceful\n\nof setting off false alarms last\n\nsemester was five hours of work for\n\nthe university. \"The days of letting\n\nHe has the option of performing\n\nservice work for the university at\n\nminimum wage for 70 hours or pay-\n\nhim if he knew anything about the people off practically scott-free are ing the fine in cash.\n\nincident, Hinton confessed to hav\n\nsent to the ECU Department of ing pulled the alarm.\n\nover as far as false alarms are con-\n\ncerned Swaim added.\n\n\"I think it is very unfair Hinton\n\ntold The East Carolinian. \"I didn't\n\nthink the alarm would go off, the\n\nglass was already broken Hinton\n\nstressed that he received the max-\n\nimum fine even though another per-\n\nson had damaged the encasement.\n\nReferring to Hinton's fine,\n\nAssociate Dean of the Department\n\nof Orientation and Judiciary James\n\nB.

Many North Carolina\n\nnewspapers have given editorial sup-\n\nport to Charns, and media attention\n\nhas been heavy. \"Incredible\n\nnumbers of people have been\n\nvolunteering their help Charns\n\ntold The East Caroinian. \"I'm over-\n\nwhelmed. I can't believe the positive\n\nresponse that so many people\n\ncame forward to speak out in my\n\ndefense\n\nCharns, who earlier referred to\n\nthe morals hearing as a \"political\n\nand religious inquisition claims\n\nthat his denial stemmed not from his\n\nso-called moral unfitness but\n\nbecause of his political and religious\n\nbeliefs. \"I'm being deprived of a\n\nlaw license solely because of my\n\nbeliefs said Charns who calls\n\nhimself a Catholic pacifist.\n\nCharns claims that he has\n\ndiscovered at least two other at-\n\ntorneys who presently practice law\n\nin North Carolina who also were\n\nconvicted of crimes of conscience,\n\nyet they were admitted to the bar.\n\nOne of the two was charged with\n\nresisting the draft during the Viet-\n\nnam War, Charns said, which is a\n\nfelony. Charns' charge is a misde-\n\nmeanor.\n\n\"It just reinforces my belief that\n\nthe Board of Law Examiners is\n\nprimarily concerned with my\n\npolitical ideology not with my\n\nmoral fitness to practice law\n\nCharns said.\n\nHe referred to his arrest last\n\nMarch at the Fort Bragg U.S. Army\n\nBase as a \"personal moral decision\n\nsaying 'no' to death ? 'no' to kill-\n\ning Charns, who's still allowed an\n\nappeal to the full 11-member Board\n\nof Law Examiners, said he will take\n\nhis case all the way to the Supreme\n\nCourt if necessary. No date for his\n\nappeal has yet been set.\n\nCharns claims he was targeted for\n\ndenial because of his visiblity and\n\noutspokeness on matters of cons-\n\ncience and that the government is\n\nusing his case as a \"scare tactic\" to\n\ndiscourage other poeple from speak-\n\ning out on similar issues.\n\n\"It's very important that people\n\ndon't become afraid because of my\n\nsituation Charns said. \"One of\n\nthe problems with all the publicity\n\n(given his case) is that people are\n\ngetting scared\n\nHe added that he believes the\n\nUnited States is moving politically\n\ntoward a more right-wing conser-\n\nvative position and that he is seeing\n\nan increase in government repres-\n\nsion and redbaiting similar to the\n\n\"McCarthyism\" of the 50s. \"Joe\n\nMcCarthy is alive and living in the\n\noffices of the N.C. Board of Law\n\nExaminers he said. \"If people\n\ndon't stop this now, it will only get\n\nworse\n\n\"My grandfather was sent to a\n\nNazi prison camp after being charg-\n\ned with high treason against the\n\nThird Reich for smuggling Polish\n\nJews into Lithvania said Charns.\n\n\"My uncle was also caught by the\n\nstorm troopers, and they cut of\n\npieces of his ear bit by bit trying to\n\nget him to divulge the names of\n\nmembers of the Polish\n\nunderground.

If I didn't know better (and I\n\ndo), I'd swear that we are fast\n\nbecoming that newspaper's favorite\n\nschool to write about.\n\nThe most recent example of their\n\nblatant bias occurred on page one of\n\nTuesday's sports section, in which\n\nthe N&O's illustrious Sports Editor\n\nJoe Tiede carried on with line after\n\nline of dubious remarks in an ob-\n\nvious attempt to \"put ECU in its\n\nplace\n\nUnfortunately, for Mr. Tiede, his\n\ncolumn contained more inconsisten-\n\ncies than are acceptable, even for\n\nhim.\n\nHe referred to ECU'S withdrawl\n\nfrom the Southern Conference in\n\n1977 as a \"mistake saying that the\n\nPirates don't belong in NCAA Divi-\n\nsion I-A. He not only questioned\n\nthe short- and long-range goals of\n\nECU's football program; he goes so\n\nfar as to doubt the existence of any\n\ngoals whatsoever.\n\nBut he also criticized the East\n\nCarolina football program for\n\nscheduling pushovers like East Ten-\n\nnessee State and Illinois State, the\n\nvery same teams he would have\n\nECU play in Division I-AA.\n\nLater on, he makes quite a\n\nstrange attempt at bringing about a\n\nparallel to ECU's \"mistake\n\nGeorgia Tech, Tiede believes, did\n\nnot benefit from pulling out of the\n\nSoutheastern Conference in the\n\n1960s. Now, although I do agree\n\nthat having to schedule Carolina,\n\nClemson and Maryland every year\n\nhas made the earlygoing in the ACC\n\ntough for the Yellowjackets. But\n\ndoes Mr. Tiede honestly believe that\n\na yearly schedule of the likes of\n\nAlabama, Georgia, Florida,\n\nAuburn, Tennessee, etc would be\n\nany easier? I hardly think it would.\n\n\"It makes no sense to schedule\n\nopponents like Central Michigan,\n\nIllinois State and Texas-Arlington\n\nTiede writes. \"The Pirates play only\n\nthree of 11 games against teams\n\nfrom their own area\n\nThe funny thing about that astute\n\nobservation is that Mr. Tiede knows\n\ndamn well why ECU can't schedule\n\nmore teams in this area. After all, it\n\nwas Carolina, not ECU, which ter-\n\nminated that former annual rivalry.\n\nAnd the same holds true for Duke.\n\nPerhaps the Tarheels outclass the\n\nPirates; I give him that much. But if\n\nthey're (UNC) so intensely in-\n\nterested in playing only the grid-\n\nkings, then why have they scheduled\n\nsuch \"pushovers\" as Army,\n\nVanderbilt or, of all schools, Bowl-\n\ning Green? Somehow, these football\n\npowers just don't scheme to fit into\n\nCarolina's \"scheme of things Mr.\n\nTiede.\n\n\"East Carolina has practically no\n\nchance of earning a bowl bid or a\n\nnational ranking he\n\nphilosophizes. Obviously, he\n\nforgets ECU won the 1978 In-\n\ndependence Bowl in Shreveport, La.\n\nA minor bowl, admittedly, yet I\n\ncan't even remember the last time\n\nhis beloved Wolfpack, Bluedevils or\n\nCavaliers were even invited to play\n\nin any postseason game.\n\nEast Carolina is a \"building\"\n\nfootball program, in every sense of\n\nthe word (inasmuch as financial\n\nresources, recruiting capability and\n\nthe like). And in so being, lean years\n\nare a mere consequence. Tiede\n\nseems to forget the lean year \"a\n\nglamour name like Notre Dame\"\n\nhad under its new head coach in\n\n1981.\n\nHe gives ECU a slim-to-none\n\nchance of beating any of its Divi-\n\nsion I-A opponents. Sure, 15th-\n\nranked Florida State beat us in\n\nevery way imaginable, not much\n\nunlike Carolina's \"stunning\"\n\ndefeat a couple of years back at the\n\nhands of Oklahoma. I, for one,\n\nwasn't stunned. And how quickly\n\nMr. Tiede forgets the recent scare\n\nthe Pirates staged in Raleigh against\n\nN.C. State. Seven points is hardly a\n\nslim-to-none chance.\n\nAnd finally, he offers, as if it\n\nwere some great consolation, the\n\nfact that Division I-AA schools\n\ncompete for a national title. Let\n\nDuke and Virginia play for a Divi\n\nsion I-AA crown. We want to play\n\nwith the big boys.\n\nITENl: SESAME STREET'S FIRST\n\nVIEWERS NOW\n\nS, LETS S.A& ABOUT We INC\n\nveuarY cp sue -atzwuc Particles\n\nre\n\n? ?\n\nMilitary Spending 'Absurd Behavior'\n\nBy PAT O'NEILL\n\n\"World military costs have risen to $600\n\nbillion a year ? well over $1 million a\n\nminute\n\nWhen I saw these words, which were\n\nreleased in a study published last week,\n\nthey sort of jumped off the page and hit\n\nme in the face. It's just so hard for me to\n\nconceptualize the meaning of such absurd\n\nbehavior.\n\nWhy does a group of human beings, all\n\nliving together on the same little planet,\n\nwant to make preparation for death their\n\nNo. 1 priority? Why does my own country\n\nhave to be the leader in this macabre\n\nbusiness?\n\nThe more I ponder these seemingly\n\nlogical questions, the more disoriented I\n\nbecome, because the reality of these\n\nthoughts leaves me with a lump in my\n\nthroat. I don't want to believe it ? I can't\n\nbelieve it!\n\nLife is too precious, I think to myself;\n\ncertainly we'll all come to our senses\n\nbefore it's too late. Everyone knows the\n\nworld can't go on if we continue to use $1\n\nmillion worth of its resources per minute to\n\npromote war, don't they?\n\nI'm trying to maintain a semblance of\n\nhope in the human species, but the signs of\n\nthe times tell me that our time is short and\n\nour task arduous. And I'm aware of yet\n\nanother problem that discourages my\n\nhope.\n\nI see that many of the people on our\n\nplanet don't share my sense of urgency; in\n\nfact, most of them seem to go about their\n\nlives apparently oblivious to the events at.\n\nhand. We appear to be aimlessly teetering\n\nalong the path to our demise, denying that\n\ndeath is really so near.\n\nActually, it's all quite similar to the\n\nstages of death that any terminally-ill\n\ncancer patient goes through. Denial of\n\ndeath is very common; it's an escape. Who\n\nwants to admit the end anyway?\n\nUnfortunately, in the nuclear age, this\n\ntype of defense mechanism is our greatest\n\nenemy ? even greater than the nuclear\n\narsenals, whose treachery we deny ?\n\nbecause all of us know what chronological-\n\nly follows denial acceptance.\n\nWhen we accept this kind of death ?\n\nnuclear death ? we are accepting mega-\n\ndeath, a type unknown, never-before-\n\nexperienced. We must snap ourselves out\n\nof this nightmare and work instead for life.\n\nWe must do this now, collectively, before\n\nthe paradoxical solace of acceptance\n\nsoftens us all. . t rx\n\nDressing Up Like The 'Stars'\n\nShopping For Halloween\n\nIt being the Halloween season, I scraped\n\nup the copper remains of my last four\n\npaychecks the other day, and set out on my\n\nannual ritual quest to find a suitable trick-\n\nor-treating costume. Needless to say, I was\n\nfeeling pretty excited; my mother said T\n\ncould go out alone this year.\n\nMy first stop, Roses, was having a\n\nclearance sale on their entire stock of Slim\n\nWhitman costumes. But, like most of us, I\n\ndon't like to wear the same thing two years\n\nin a row. I was looking for something a lit-\n\ntle more political anyway. So, I fished\n\naround the sparse shelves for a while, tried\n\non a \"Ronnie Reagan\" plastic mask\n\n(which, by the way, didn't fit because so-\n\nmeone had errantly glued a foot in the\n\nmouth hole) and decided there really\n\nwasn't anything there I particularly\n\nwanted.\n\nThe Issues & The Answers\n\nBy JAY STONE\n\nToday, more than ever, complex and\n\ndemanding issues confront American\n\nsociety and the world. How we choose to\n\ndeal with these problems will shape the\n\nkind of world that we will live in and our\n\nprogeny will inherit. In many respects, we\n\nare at a critical mass point. Fundamental\n\nand extensive changes in our social institu-\n\ntions are demanded in the present epoch if\n\nwe are to continue to live harmoniously\n\nand to prosper.\n\nThe nuclear arms race, if carried on\n\nunabated for the next 20 years, obviously\n\nthreatens humanity with destruction of an\n\nunimaginable scale. The systematic\n\neradication of the environment (dumping\n\nof toxic wastes, pesticides, wastes from\n\nnuclear power plants, erosion of the ozone\n\nlayer, air pollution, desertification, and\n\nthe list goes on) also holds an ominous and\n\nforeboding portent for us. Our economic\n\nproblems of unemployment, inflation and\n\nthe decline of the ability of American\n\nmanufacturers to compete with foreign\n\nproducts is yet another problem deman-\n\nding action. All of these problems and\n\nothers, e.g energy, demand immediate\n\nand decisive action. They will not be put\n\noff until the next generation inherits them.\n\nIt is our generation that must confront\n\nand deal with these problems. Although we\n\ndid not create them, they are now our pro-\n\nblems. It is today's youth who will most\n\nlikely die in an impending nuclear war and\n\nour generation which will reap the conse-\n\nquences of the destruction of the environ-\n\nment and an obsolete political and\n\neconomic system. The young die in war,\n\nand the young are disproportionately\n\nunemployed.\n\nUpon coming to this realization, our\n\nfirst response is often denial; we simply ig-\n\nnore all the problems and hope that they\n\ngo away. This response is what is common-\n\nly misdiagnosed as apathy. It is usually not\n\nthat we don't care; more often, we simply\n\ndon't understand the issue or see how it ap-\n\nplies to us, so we feel helpless and\n\nfrustrated by it. In any case, this attitude\n\ndoes not do anything about \"solving\" our\n\nproblems.\n\nWhat does do something about solving\n\nthem is when we ban together, study our\n\nproblems and take action. Right now, we\n\nare on the fringe of an exciting new era. If\n\nwe can simply keep from incinerating\n\nourselves with nuclear weapons or poison-\n\ning ourselves or suffering an economic col-\n\nlapse we will likely see most of the major\n\nproblems that plague humanity solved in\n\nour lifetime.\n\nTremendous strides are being made in\n\nthe elimination of hunger and disease. A\n\npromising breakthrough in the production\n\nof energy in the form of hydrogen (which\n\nis essentially non-polluting and almost in-\n\nexhaustible) was recently announced on\n\nthe CBS Evening News. Scientists are even\n\ntalking about significantly extending the\n\nhuman life span. With the advent of the\n\nspace shuttle, mining the moon or\n\nasteroids for raw materials is a real\n\npossibility. We are discovering techniques\n\nfor enhancing memory and intelligence as\n\nwell as altering moods. In short, most of\n\nthe reasons why people have fought wars\n\nwill be eliminated within the next 25 years.\n\nWhy do we need to fight wars if there is\n\nplenty for everyone? Why do we need\n\nnuclear weapons if we don't fight wars?\n\nWe are, indeed, in the midst of a major\n\nrennaissance, one like the world has never\n\neven dreamt of! Yet, we are still partially\n\nsteeped in the Dark Ages. And we plod\n\nalong like lemmings.\n\nIt is up to the members of this genera-\n\ntion to help purge the rest of society of its\n\nold habits of fear and superstition so that\n\nwe may begin to explore our vast potential\n\nfor transformation and growth. This must\n\nbe undertaken immediately.\n\n\"Campus Forum\n\nMike Hughes\n\nJust The Way It Is\n\nI popped on over to K-Mart, which, I\n\nmight add, usually boasts Greenville's\n\nfinest selection of political Halloween get-\n\nups. But, once again, hundreds of other\n\n\"smart shoppers\" had beat me to the best\n\ndeals. Damn! All that was left was a Ronco\n\n\"Tippy\" O'Neill leisure costume, com-\n\nplete with hair powder, empty fifth bottle\n\nand flashing red nose (batteries not includ-\n\ned). But even that would have been okay\n\nhad it not been a \"small I take a \"large\"\n\nin Ronco.\n\nTotally disgusted, I headed out to\n\nNichols. Now, I know what you're think-\n\ning. Hell, I've never really liked Nichols'\n\nHalloween costumes either, but by this\n\ntime, I was getting incredibly desperate. I\n\nhad nothing to wear: I had forgot to feed\n\nmy Leonid Breznev eyebrows, and they\n\nwere dead; I'd tost one of the Nerf foot-\n\nballs to my Dolly Parton costume, and my\n\nofficial Fidel Castro cigar had been con-\n\nfiscated by campus security. I was in a\n\nbind.\n\nSurprisingly, Nichols' shelves were pret-\n\nty well stocked with replicas of the outfits\n\nworn by everyone's favorite political stars.\n\nI tried on a Menachem Begin suit, but the\n\noversized head was so loose, I was afraid it\n\nwould fall off if I tried to move too fast.\n\nSo, I looked on the shelf to the right at the\n\nAriel Sharon costumes. They were pretty\n\nnice, except they all had big red stains\n\ndown the front. And neither costume came\n\nwith instructions on how to use the ac-\n\ncessory cluster bombs.\n\nI strolled over to whert they stock the\n\nghoul outfits, so I could get a gander at\n\nthe Ted Kennedy suits. But unfortunately,\n\nnone of the life preservers fit.\n\nI ambled over to the ornate Ferdinand\n\nMarcos costumes, but I refuse to fork out\n\n$600 for a stupid white shirt.\n\nThe James Watt \"Natureboy\" outfits\n\nwere all torn up and tattered; the\n\nAyatollah Khomeini executioners' veils\n\nwere pretty nice, but \"far too revealing\n\nthe halos on all the Jesse Helms angel suits\n\nwere missing, and the entire shipment of\n\nLech Walesa union-made coveralls had\n\nbeen confiscated, and no one knew where\n\nthey were.\n\nI went home and started practicing up\n\non my yodelling.\n\nEditor's Note: Mike Hughes, a senior from\n\nSmryna, N.C, is a local novelist and\n\ngrocery-store stockboy. His most recent\n\nand famous book, based on the plentious\n\nexcitement to be found here in Greenville,\n\nis appropriately titled East Of Ayden.\n\n'Parallel9 Runneth Perpendicular\n\nOn Oct. 26, the Campus Forum\n\nprinted a \"modern parallel\" to I Corin-\n\nthians chapter 13. Because this writing\n\nshows no real religious corrollation, and\n\nbecause many principles in the writing\n\nare anti-Biblical, the (letter) must be\n\nchallenged.\n\nOpen your Bible and take a look at I\n\nCorinthians 13. It's about spiritual gifts,\n\nprophecy and tongues, to name a few.\n\nThese gifts must be exercised in love.\n\nThat's what chapter 13 is about. What\n\nit's not about is anything having to do\n\nwith nuclear arms and social problems,\n\nas Mr. Skidmore suggests.\n\nThe main point here is not that the\n\nideas presented here do not pertain to\n\nchapter 13; it is that many contradict the\n\nBible. And ideas that contradict the Bi-\n\nble cannot be called a \"modern\n\nparallel\" to any part of it. For example,\n\nthe version says, \"The ends always\n\njustify the means Hitler's dream was\n\nto create a master race. He killed seven\n\nmillion Jews in his attempt. Creating a\n\nmaster race was not such a terrible idea,\n\nbut the ends here obviously didn't\n\njustify the means.\n\nThe last verse of I Corinthians 13\n\nreads, \"And now abideth faith, hope,\n\ncharity (love), these three; but the\n\ngreatest of these is love Mr. Skid-\n\nmore's \"modern parallel\" reads,\n\n\"There are, in the end, three things that\n\nlast: poverty, social injustice and the\n\nmilitary budget. And the greatest of\n\nthese is our acceptance of them What\n\ndo \"faith, hope and love\" have to do\n\nwith \"poverty, social injustice and the\n\nmilitary budget?\"\n\nIf Mr. Skidmore wants to call this his\n\nanti-Biblical philosophy on the world to-\n\nday, that's his opinion. But to correlate\n\nideas such as these presented with the Bi-\n\nble is pure distortion.\n\nJohnParncJJ\n\nFreshman, Pre-Business\n\nChristian\n\nM\n\nBy ANTH\n\nMiff\n\n\"Medn\n\nSlavery: Tl\n\nBlacks ii\n\nSouth\" was\n\na \"Persp\n\nture given\n\nL.

Savitt of the ECU\n\nSchool of Medicine's\n\nmedical humanities\n\nprogram. The lecture\n\nwas part of a series of\n\ngeneral interest lectures\n\nsponsored by the\n\nmedical school and the\n\nCharles E. Culpepper\n\nFoundation of New\n\nYork.\n\nDr. Savitt's lecture\n\nwas based on his book,\n\nMedicine and Slavery\n\nand on research con-\n\nducted in Virginia. The\n\nlecture focused on the\n\nquestion of whether\n\nblacks were medically\n\ndifferent from whites.\n\nSavitt also talked about\n\nblack health in the slave\n\nquarters, female\n\ndisorders, children's\n\ndisorders, types of\n\nhealth care and\n\nepidemics.\n\nAccording to Savitt,\n\nslavery was a part of\n\nthe Southern culture.\n\nBy 1860, blacks made\n\nup one-third of the\n\nSouthern population.\n\nCiting information\n\nfrom diaries, letters,\n\njournal, magazine and\n\nnewspaper articles, Dr.\n\nSavitt said that\n\nSoutherners were con-\n\ncerned with their health\n\nand the health of their\n\nslaves. Disease was\n\nmore rampant hi the\n\nSouth, the most com-\n\nmon being parasitic in-\n\nfections, malaria,\n\nyellow fever, small pox,\n\nmeasles and dysentery.\n\nDoctors could treat\n\nminor medical pro-\n\nblems, but for treating\n\ndisease, \"their presence\n\nwas not effective\n\nSavitt said blacks\n\nwere medically dif-\n\nferent from whites.\n\nHowever, many of the\n\ndifferences were based\n\non anecdotes and used\n\nmainly to justify\n\nslavery. There were no\n\nmedical procedures\n\ndesigned specifically to\n\ntreat blacks. \"It was a\n\npolitical claim Savitt\n\nsaid.\n\nDr. Savitt also\n\ndiscussed life in slave\n\nquarters, which he call-\n\ned, \"small com-\n\nmunities He explain-\n\ned that the quarters had\n\nproblems that are com-\n\nmon to all groups such,\n\nas body lice, bed bugs,\n\nviruses and skin and\n\nscalp problems.

It's\n\nperhaps the most controversial issue\n\nof our time.\n\nStaunch feminists scream that\n\ntheir bodies are their own and what\n\nthey do with them is their business.\n\nThey cry out that anti-abortionists\n\n\"are not concerned about life after\n\nbirth but only with controlling\n\npeople's free choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the opposition\n\nsometimes refers to pro-choicers as\n\nmurderers, and so they chain\n\nthemselves to the doors of abortion\n\nclinics. It's truly hard to find a mid-\n\ndle of the roader on this volatile\n\nissue.\n\nEnter \"Pro-Lifers for Survivial\"\n\nor P.S and the fire gets hotter.\n\nStarted in 1979 by anti-nuclear ac-\n\ntivist Juli Loesch, P.S. was the\n\nresponse by Loesch and some of her\n\nfriends, to the lack of sensitivity\n\nthey perceived among the peace ac-\n\ntivists, concerning the issue of abor-\n\ntion.\n\nDuring a 1979 \"No Nukes\" rally,\n\nLoesch and her group distributed\n\n10,000 prolife leaflets explaining\n\nwhy members of the anti-nuclear\n\nmovement should be opposed to\n\nabortion too. And so came the\n\n\"birth\" of P.S.\n\n\"Prolifers for Survival is a\n\nbridge states their promotional\n\nbrochure. It links the prolife move-\n\nment (opposing abortion and other\n\nsocially selected killing), and the\n\npeace movement (opposng nuclear\n\narms and other threats to world sur-\n\nvival), because as they claim, \"Life\n\nand Peace belong together\n\nLoesch recognizes a clear connec-\n\ntion between the threat of the\n\nnuclear arms race and the abortion\n\nof an unwanted child.\n\n\"They're exactly the same\n\nthing Loesch told the East Caroli-\n\nnian Because they each represent\n\na deliberate, direct, and massive at-\n\ntack against innocent human life\n\nShe refers to nuclear war as poten-\n\ntial \"megabortion a term she\n\ncoined herself.\n\nLoesch, who was raised a\n\nCatholic and actively works in lay\n\nministry is single, and has never\n\nbeen married nor been pregnant.\n\nShe hopes that P.S. will be able to\n\n\"foster dialogue in arenas too often\n\npolarized by bitter conservative ?\n\nvs ? liberal debate\n\n\"Left and right are not as impor-\n\ntant to us as right and wrong. And\n\nwhat's right is strengthened by\n\nworking with the love of life in the\n\nhearts of traditional adversaries\n\nstates P.Ss promotional brochure.\n\nLoesch also draws on a set of con-\n\nclusions that she has made citing the\n\nconnections between the nuclear\n\npower industry and abortion. She\n\nwas appalled by the fact that people\n\nhave called for extra funds for abor-\n\ntions, to be used in the event of a\n\nnuclear accident, while they also\n\nproclaim their opposition to nuclear\n\nweapons and power. \"This isn't\n\nnon-violence. This is a search and\n\ndestroy mission Loesch said.\n\nLoesch went on to say, \"It allows\n\nthe nuclear business to sweep away\n\ntheir casualties. They nullify any\n\nreal moral or legal response to the\n\nviolence that they're carrying out\n\nagainst human life\n\n\"It is this numb not-\n\nknowingness, this species-amnesia,\n\nwhich makes the nuclearmilitary\n\nindustry even thinkable.

Pablic tickets are also\n\non sale at the two Greenville Record Bars and at Apple Records.\n\nBy JAY STONE\n\nSome predict that Lester C. Thurow may well be the\n\nnext John Kennith Galbraith. (Readers may recall that\n\nJohn Kennith Galbraith is the economist who\n\nengineered much of the New Deal.) Thurow, Professor\n\nof Economics and Management at the Massachusetts\n\nInstitute of Technology, is in a position to have com-\n\nparisons like this made because of the extent to which\n\nhis economic policies are influencing the top contenders\n\nfor the 1984 Democratic Presidential nomination. He is\n\nadvisor to Edward Kennedy, Walter Mondale, and\n\nSenator Gary Hart of Colorado. These three are con-\n\nsidered by analysts to be the most likely choices for the\n\nDemocratic nomination in '84.\n\nThurow has been a frequent contributor to \"New\n\nYork Times Magazine\" and he is author of \"The Zero-\n\nSum Society In a recent editorial for \"New York\n\nTimes\" he declared that the easy money measures\n\nadopted by the Reagan administration are not likely to\n\npull us out of the present financial crisis.\n\nAccording to Thurow, one of the reasons for this is\n\nthe weakness of the banking system due to a world-wide\n\nrecession. This recession, he said, is being fueled by the\n\nfact that Mexico is not paying interest or principal on\n\nmore than $80 billion in loans, Poland is not paying in-\n\nterest or principal on more than $256 billion, and all of\n\nEastern Europe is, financially speaking, only a step\n\nbehind the Poles. He added that Brazil, Argentina, and\n\nVenezuala have a combined debt of roughly $100 billion\n\nand are , at most, two steps beLind Mexico which is on\n\nthe verge of financial collapse. Canada and Belgium are\n\nalso seriously ailing. As a consequence, Thurow con-\n\nlcuded, it is highly unlikely that mortgage interest rates\n\nwill fall, which might fuel investment in housing, since\n\nthe banks simply need a period of high lending rates to\n\nget themselves back into a healthy financial state.\n\nFurthermore, Thurow said, the economic climate to-\n\nday provides the consumer with little encouragement to\n\ninclrease spending. Wary over the rate of unemploy-\n\nment, bankruptcies, and plant closings consumers are\n\nmore prone to save than to spend. Hence, consumers\n\nare not likely to provide the spark for a return to\n\neconomic growth. And neither are state and local\n\ngovernments which have provided ever-increasing ex-\n\npenditures on schools in the past, which created jobs\n\nand stimulated growth. But that has changed in the last\n\nfew years, according to Thurow's article; with falling\n\nschool enrollments state and local spending is declining.\n\nIn his book The Zero-Sum Society Thurow offers a\n\nunique analysis of our contemporary economic malaise.\n\nThe fundamental problem, Thurow says in his book, is\n\nslow economic growth coupled with inflation. The trad-\n\ntional cure for inflation has been to tighten fiscal\n\nandor monetary policies to the point that they create a\n\nrecession large enough to crack indexing, stop infla-\n\ntionary expectations, and force wages and prices to fall.\n\nThurow is quick to point out, however, that this cure\n\nhas the unfortunate draw-back of resulting in high\n\nunemployment. Furthermore, no one knows how high\n\nSee U.S. ECONOMY, Page 7\n\nU.\n\nContinued Fq\n\nunemployei\n\nhave to be t\n\ntion in thi\n\nBecause of\n\nvantage n\n\nprogram\n\nvocates this\n\nto solving t!\n\nproblem is\n\ntain the suj\n\nelectorate f\n\nThurow's oj\n\nHe mail\n\nour slow\n\ngrow i a is\n\nby tight m\n\nfiscal poli\n\nresult in '\n\nty More\n\npercent of\n\nplants and\n\nnot being\n\nding to Tl\n\nlargest percj\n\nthe statist\n\ncomplied u\n\n\"With ic\n\nincentives\n\ndiminish,\n\nneed for\n\nproductive!\n\nKnowing t(\n\nnot need\n\nfirms often I\n\nresearch ai\n\nment for\n\ntion procesj\n\nresult is\n\neconomy\n\njmi\n\nsotrn\n\nThurs.\n\nalsi\n\nL,\n\nystinjl\n\n? -\n\n- ?? ? ? ?? ?\n\n.bHimWSIiii 0T ' I\n\nTHE EAST CAROLINIAN\n\nOCTOBER 28, 1982\n\nre\n\nIt ie ECU\n\nand Our\n\nter noted\n\ne already\n\nyears.\n\nich week-\n\nim.

These\n\nbarriers are in the form\n\nof government sub-\n\nsidies for \"inefficient\"\n\nindustries and import\n\ntariffs to protect\n\ndomestic industry from\n\ncompetition. Because\n\nof this, says Thurow,\n\nbusinesses are not en-\n\ncouraged to be in-\n\nnovative and to invest\n\nin promising new areas\n\nof the economy.\n\nIn explanation of\n\nwhy the economy is\n\ndesigned in this way\n\nThurow points to\n\ngroups which organize\n\nto prevent policies be-\n\ning put into effect that\n\nwill hurt them.

If that's the only thing that\n\nmotivates you, it will be a very long\n\nseason. I've coached at four ACC\n\nschools (Wake Forest, Clemson,\n\nDuke and Georgia Tech), and I'd\n\nmuch rather be coaching here at\n\nECU.

It's good for us to\n\nplay these teams\n\n\"East Carolina has practically no\n\nchance of earning a bowl bid or a\n\nnational ranking In reference to\n\nthis statement, Emory said he\n\nwouldn't rule out all possibilities.\n\n\"We're just going to try and finish\n\nwith an 8-3 record and get a bowl\n\nbid. Right now, we have to play for\n\nrespect and it's up to the players to\n\nshow how much they want\n\n\"Powers like Pittsburgh, Penn\n\nState and Florida State have the ad-\n\nvantage of populous areas in which\n\nto recruit. East Carolina has none of\n\nthese According to Emory,\n\nhowever, ECU has something that\n\nno other school can offer. \"We\n\nbelieve competition build pro-\n\ngrams he said. \"We tell each\n\nrecruit that comes here that we can\n\noffer him something that Penn State\n\ncan't, Florida State can't or\n\nCarolina. We'll give him the\n\ngreatest competitive urge because\n\nwe're trying to outdo those people,\n\nand it's human desire to want to be\n\nas good as the best man\n\nWhen it comes to recuits, Emory\n\nsaid ECU will get its share because\n\n\"we have more to sell\n\n\"You take West Virginia he\n\nsaid. \"They have only seven signees\n\nfrom Virginia and we've got more\n\nthan that from North Carolina.\n\nEmory added that ECU is much\n\nmore populous than Florida State\n\n? two-million more. \"Our drawing\n\nrange is much larger than theirs\n\nhe said. \"We get people all the way\n\nfrom Washington, D.C. to South\n\nCarolina and all over\n\nAs far as comparing stadium size,\n\nEmory said he is tired of hearing\n\nthat ECU only has 35,000 seats.\n\n\"Heck, we're bigger than 40 of the\n\nstadiums at Division-I schools.\n\nBesides, we're bigger than the\n\nUniversity of Virginia, and Duke\n\nand Georgia Tech both draw in the\n\n20's (20,000) at home\n\nEmory is looking toward the\n\nfuture, and he knows the road he is\n\ntraveling is a long and winding one.\n\nBut as he indicated, ECU is not the\n\nonly school to confront such a\n\nchallenge. \"Look at Pitt\n\n(Pittsburgh) and Florida State he\n\nsaid. \"In '74, Pitt's football pro-\n\ngram was really struggling and I\n\ndon't think Florida State won a\n\ngame that year\n\nIn Tiede's concluding statements,\n\nhe insinuated that ECU is wander-\n\ning headlessiy down a football path\n\nof no direction. But Emory knows\n\nbetter. \"When you know what you\n\nwant, you're not in a state of confu-\n\nsionhe said, \"and we know what\n\nwe want\n\nIn order to completely prove\n\nTiede wrong, however, can only be\n\ndetermined by one element ? time.\n\nAnd as the old saying goes, time will\n\ncertainly tell.\n\nRRotO By GARY PATTERSON\n\nCoach Ed Emory expressed optimism about the ECU football program's\n\nbright future after reading an upsetting newspaper article.\n\nMountaineers Pose Problems\n\nBy KEN BOLTON\n\nAssistant Sports Editor\n\nThe ECU football team is prepar-\n\ning for a grueling four-game road\n\ntrip that will see the team travel\n\nthrough states as far away as Texas\n\nand Pennsylvania.\n\nAs Pirate head coach Ed Emory\n\nputs it, the team will get a scenic\n\nview of much of the country. \"We'll\n\nbe going from the coal mines of\n\nWest Virginia to Dallas-Ft. Worth,\n\nthen to one of the birthplaces of\n\nAmerica in Williamsburg and final-\n\nly to Philadelphia, the 'City of\n\nBrotherly Love \"\n\nThe first stop for the Pirates will\n\nbe Morgantown, West Virginia,\n\nwhere ECU will take on the highly-\n\nranked Mountaineers next Saturday\n\nafternoon.\n\nWVU is the reigning Peach Bowl\n\nchampions after they demolished\n\nFlorida 26-6 in last year's post-\n\nseason contest.\n\nIt will be Band Day at Moun-\n\ntaineer Field when WVU, 5-2, takes\n\non the Pirates, who have a 4-3\n\nmark. The two teams met last year\n\nwith the Mountaineers coming out\n\non top, 20-3.\n\nWest Virginia quarterback Jeff\n\nHostetler has had an impressive year\n\nas he has completed 49.8 per-cent of\n\nhis passes for 1555 yards. He has\n\nbeen bothered by a bruised big toe\n\non his left foot and is expected to be\n\nready, but will not start. Kevin\n\nWhite will .start in the backfield\n\nalong with runningbacks Ron\n\nWolfley and Tom Gray.\n\nEmory feels that Hostetler might\n\nsee action. \"Kevin White is a fine\n\nplayer, but I don't believe that\n\nHostetler is not going to play said\n\nEmory. \"They are fighting for a\n\nbowl berth, so how could they keep\n\nhim out if the game is close?\"\n\nWhether Hostetler plays or not,\n\nEmory knows that the Moun-\n\ntaineers will be tough. Their only\n\ntwo losses of the year have been to\n\nPittsburgh and Penn State.\n\n\"I feel West Virginia is of the\n\nsame quality and basic thinking as\n\nFlorida State with the same type of\n\nathletes stated Emory.\n\n\"Defensively, they controlled\n\nOklahoma's high-powered offense,\n\nand then controlled Pitt and Marino\n\n(Dan). They also held Penn State to\n\nonly 118 yards passing last week,\n\ndespite Penn State's fine quarter-\n\nback (Todd Blackledge)\n\nEmory's sideline counterpart will\n\nbe Don Nehlen. In just two years,\n\nNehlen has taken the West Virginia\n\nfootball program from four con-\n\nsecutive losing seasons to last year's\n\n8-3 mark and Peach Bowl cham-\n\npionship.
