ACTION: Proposed consent agreement. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition, this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, a Ohio-based drugstore chain to divest, within one year of the order, to a Commission approved acquirer, all assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in either the respondent's store or in the acquired Hook-SupeRx (HSI) retail store in each of three geographic areas, and to complete the divestiture within one year. If not complete in that period of time, the order would require the respondent to consent to the appointment of a trustee to divest the assets. In addition, the proposed consent agreement would require the respondent to obtain prior Commission approval, for ten years, before acquiring any similar business interest in any of the three specified towns. DATES: Comments must be received on or before September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be directed to FTC/Office of the Secretary, Room 159, 6th St. and Pa. Ave., N.W., Washington, DC. 20580.

In the matter of Revco D.S., Inc., a corporation. File No. 941- 0075. Agreement Containing Consent Order The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') having initiated an investigation of the proposed acquisition of all of the voting stock of Hook SupeRx, Inc. (``HSI''), by Revco D.S., Inc. (``Revco''), and it is now appearing that Revco, hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``Proposed Respondent,'' is willing to enter into an agreement containing an order (``Agreement'') to divest certain assets, and to cease and desist from making certain acquisitions, and providing for certain other relief: It is hereby agreed by and between Proposed Respondent, by its duty authorized officers and attorneys, and counsel for the Commission that: 1. Proposed Respondent Revco is a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by the virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware with its office and principal place of business located at 1925 Enterprise Parkway, Twinsburg, Ohio 44087. 2. Proposed Respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached. 3. Proposed Respondent waives: a. any further procedural steps; b. the requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law; c. all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant to this agreement; and d. any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act. 4. This Agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the Commission. If this Agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the Proposed Respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint (in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding. 5. This Agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by Proposed Respondent that the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft complaint, other than the jurisdictional facts, are true. 6. This Agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may, without further notice to the Proposed Respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following Order to divest and to cease and desist in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public with respect thereto. When so entered, the Order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the same time provided by statute for other orders. The Order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the United States Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to Order to Proposed Respondent's address as stated in this Agreement shall constitute service. Proposed Respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner of services. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation not contained in the Order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the Order. 7. Proposed Respondent has read the proposed Complaint and Order contemplated hereby. Proposed Respondent understands that once the Order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully complied with the Order. Proposed Respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by law for each violation of the Order after it becomes final.

The purpose of the divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested is to ensure the continued use of the Assets To Be Divested as ongoing viable pharmacies engaged in the same businesses in which the Assets To Be Divested are presently employed and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint. C. Pending divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested, Respondent shall take such actions as are necessary to maintain the competitiveness, viability and marketability of the Assets To Be Divested and to prevent the destruction, removal, wasting, deterioration, or impairment of any Assets To Be Divested except for ordinary wear and tear. D. If a divestiture includes a lease of physical space, and if pursuant to that lease Respondent through default of the lease or otherwise regains possession of the space, Respondent must notify the Commission of such repossession within thirty (30) days and must redivest such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II of this Order within six (6) months of such repossession. If Respondent has not redivested such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II of this Order within six (6) months of such repossession, the provisions of Paragraph III shall apply to these assets. III It is further ordered That: A. If Respondent has not divested, absolutely and in good faith and with the Commission's prior approval, the Assets To Be Divested within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes final, the Commission may appoint a trustee to divest the Assets To Be Divested. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to Sec. 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 45(l), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, Respondent shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to Sec. 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by Respondent to comply with this Order. B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. of this Order, Respondent shall consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities: 1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Respondent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If Respondent has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to Respondent of the identity of any proposed trustee, Respondent shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee. 2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest the Assets To Be Divested. 3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, Respondent shall execute a trust agreement that, subject to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture required by this Order. 4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in Paragraph III.B.3 to accomplish the divestiture, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission. If, however, at the end of the twelve-month period the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or in the case of a court- appointed trustee by the court. 5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities related to the Assets To Be Divested, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may reasonably request. Respondent shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any delays in divestiture caused by Respondent shall extend the time for divestiture under this Paragraph in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee, by the court. 6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract that is submitted to the Commission subject to Respondent's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum price. The divestiture shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set out in Paragraph II of this Order. Provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquirer, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquirer, the trustee shall divest to the acquirer or acquirers selected by Respondent from among those approved by the Commission. 7. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of Respondent, on such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have authority to employ, at the cost and expense of Respondent, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are reasonably necessary to carry out the trustee's duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Respondent and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the Assets To Be Divested. 8. Respondent shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, and Respondent shall either defend against such claims or pay the trustee's expenses, including all reasonable fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense of any such claim, whether or not resulting in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses result from misfeasance, gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee. 9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner as provided in Paragraph III.A. of this Order. 10. The Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, the court, may on its own initiative or at the request of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the divestiture required by this Order. 11. The trustee shall have no obligation or authority to operate or maintain the Assets To Be Divested. 12. The trustee shall report in writing to Respondent and to the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning the trustee's efforts to accomplish divestiture. IV It is further ordered That, for a period of ten (10) years from the date this Order becomes final, Respondent shall not, without the prior approval of the Commission, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, partnerships, or otherwise: (A) Acquire any stock, share capital, equity, leasehold or other interest in any concern, corporate or non-corporate, presently engaged in, or within the six months preceding such acquisition engaged in, the business of selling prescription drugs at retail stores located in any of the cities or towns listed in Paragraph I. (J). of this Order; or (B) Acquire any assets used for, or previously used for (and still suitable for use for), the business of selling prescription drugs at retail stores located in any of the cities or towns listed in Paragraph I.(J). of this Order from any concern, corporate or non-corporate, presently engaged in or within the six months preceding such acquisition engaged in, the business of selling prescription drugs at retail stores located in any of the cities or towns listed in Paragraph I.(J). of this Order. Provided, however, that these prohibitions shall not relate to the construction of new facilities. V It is further ordered That: A. Within sixty (60) days after the date this Order becomes final and every sixty (60) days thereafter until Respondent has fully complied with the provisions of Paragraphs II. and III. of this Order, Respondent shall submit to the Commission a verified written report setting forth in detail the manner and form in which it intends to comply, is complying, and has complied with those provisions. Respondent shall include in its compliance reports, among other things that are required from time to time, a full description of the efforts being made to comply with Paragraphs II and III of the Order, including a description of all substantive contacts or negotiations for the divestiture and the identity of all parties contacted. Respondent also shall include in its compliance reports copies of all written communications to and from such parties, all internal memoranda, and all reports and recommendations concerning divestiture. B. One (1) year from the date this Order becomes final, annually thereafter for the next nine (9) years on the anniversary of the date this Order became final, and at such other times as the Commission may require, Respondent shall file a verified written report with the Commission setting forth in detail the manner and form in which it has complied and is complying with Paragraph IV. of this Order. VI It is further ordered That Respondent shall notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any proposed change in the corporate respondent such as dissolution, assignment, sale resulting in the emergence of a successor corporation, or the creation or dissolution of subsidiaries or any other change in the corporation that may affect compliance obligations arising out of the Order. VII It is further ordered That, for the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Order, Respondent shall permit any duly authorized representative of the Commission: A. Access, during office hours and in the presence of counsel, to inspect and copy all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of Respondent relating to any matters contained in this consent order; and B. Upon five (5) days notice to Respondent, and without restraint or interference from it, to interview officers, directors, or employees of Respondent, who may have counsel present, regarding such matters. Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent Order from Revco D.S., Inc. (``Revco'') under which Revco would divest pharmacy assets in three (3) geographic locations where it faces limited competition. Revco operates the Revco chain of drug stores. The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed Order. On March 31, 1994 Revco and Hook-SupeRx, Inc. (``HSI'') executed an Agreement and Plan or Merger providing for the acquisition by Revco of all of the voting securities of HSI. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 45, in the market for the sale of prescription drugs in retail stores in the following towns: Covington, Virginia; Marion, Virginia; and Radford, Virginia (hereinafter ``relevant geographic area''). The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by maintaining the current number of competitors in the relevant geographic areas where Revco and HSI are direct competitors and where they face limited competition. The proposed Consent Order provides that within one (1) year of the Order becoming final, Revco shall divest all assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in Revco or HSI retail stores in the relevant geographic areas. The divestiture of the Revco or HSI pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas shall be made only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The assets shall be divested to an eligible acquirer or acquirers that will operate a pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas. Eligible acquirers in each relevant geographic area include, but are not limited to: owners of retail stores that currently do not operate a pharmacy in that relevant geographic area; persons previously employed by Revco or HSI; or persons who will open a new retail store. In the event that Revco has not divested the Revco or HSI pharmacy assets in the relevant areas in one (1) year, the proposed Consent Order provides that Revco shall consent to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the pharmacy assets. Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Revco is also required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until Revco has completely divested its interest in assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in the relevant geographic areas. The proposed Order will also prohibit Revco, for a period of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Federal Trade Commission approval, any stock in any concern engaged in the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas or any assets used for the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas. One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Revco will be required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Revco to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) day prior to any change in the structure of Revco resulting in the emergence of a successor. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.
