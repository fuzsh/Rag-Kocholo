        "text": "Despite receiving the cold shoulder, Clearwater-based Jack Eckerd Corp. is pursuing its bid to acquire drug chain Revco D.S. Inc., which is now in reorganization in bankruptcy court. Twinsburg, Ohio-based Revco said it is putting aside its own reorganization plan and supporting a proposal by three creditors' groups to restructure the company and bring it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThe three creditors' groups, which hold $1.2-billion or 80 percent of the outstanding claims against Revco, indicated they will pursue their reorganization plan, rather than adopt the proposal submitted last month by Eckerd and a smaller group of creditors.\n\nJudge Harold White will hear details of the reorganization plans proposed by Eckerd and the main creditors on Nov. 8 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron. If one plan is approved, all the company's creditors will have the opportunity to vote on it.\n\nRevco's rebuff of Eckerd's takeover attempt was not a surprise, according to Mike Zagorac, a spokesman for Eckerd.\n\nBut \"We believe our plan is superior to either the management plan or the creditors' plan,\" Zagorac said. Eckerd continues to negotiate with creditors and \"pursue its options,\" he said.\n\nAmong the options Eckerd might explore are sweetening its reorganization plan to make it more attractive to creditors or simply withdrawing its plan and pursuing an acquisition after Revco emerges from bankruptcy.\n\nEckerd proposed to buy Revco by issuing $970-million in bonds to pay creditors. In conjunction, privately held Eckerd planned to issue about 200-million shares of stock to the public and use the proceeds to retire debt.\n\nIf Eckerd were to acquire Revco in bankruptcy court, it would preclude any bids for the reorganized company. Creditors are betting the company will be worth more on the open market after it emerges from bankruptcy.\n\nThe combination of Revco and Eckerd would create the nation's largest drug store chain and greatly expand Eckerd's presence in eastern states. Revco, with annual sales of $1.9-billion, operates 1,150 stores in 10 eastern states. Eckerd has 1,676 stores, predominantly in the South."
