        "text": "TWINSBURG, Ohio -- Revco D.S. Inc. -- in Chapter 11 bankruptcy since 1988 -- filed an amended plan of reorganization and the required disclosure statement Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron, Ohio.\n\n'Financially, we believe this plan offers creditors recoveries equal to or better than other plans in this case,' said Revco Chairman Boake A. Sells. 'It also assures an independent Revco, proposes no massive store closings and preserves thousands of jobs.\n\n'Further, as this plan does not require the time that would be needed for planning store closings or layoffs and has no due-diligence or anti-trust risks, it carries a high degree of certainty it will be completed and completed soon.' Boakes said.\n\nGregory K. Raven, Revco executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the amended plan offers creditors in excess of $100 million in cash, attractive debt securities and equity in the reorganized company.\n\nHe said the cash recoveries are possible due to Revco's significantly improved operating results, he said.\n\nRevco, based in Twinsburg, operates 1,150 drug stores in 10 states and has annual sales of around $1.9 billion. It sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 1988 after the collapse of a leveraged buyout by former management and other investors buried it under $1.5 billion in debt.\n\nThree reorganization plans put to a vote of creditors early this month failed to win adequate support for adoption, though a plan proposed by creditors and backed by Revco won support of four of the seven key creditor classes.\n\nLike the new reorganization plan, the previous Revco-backed plan called for the drug store chain to emerge from Chapter 11 as an independent company, with creditors as stakeholders.\n\nThe two competing plans involved buyouts of Revco.\n\nA plan offered by Rite Aid Corp. of Shiremanstown, Pa., which proposed to acquire Revco in a cash-stock deal valued at $733 million, won support from two creditor classes but was withdrawn two weeks ago.\n\nA Rite Aid spokeswoman said the company, which operates 2,444 stores in 22 Eastern states, decided to withdraw its plan to acquire Revco because any increase in its offer would 'make the price excessive.'\n\nThe third plan put to creditors -- an acquisition proposal by Jack Eckerd Corp., a Florida drug chain -- was backed by only one group but Eckerd is offering an amended plan.\n\nThe bankruptcy court has scheduled a Feb. 14 hearing on the adequacy of the Revco disclosure statement. A hearing on the adequacy of the disclosure statement for the proposed amended plan by Eckerd is scheduled for the same date.\n\nDisclosure statements describe how creditors and interest holders will be treated under the reorganization plans and include background and financial projections.\n\nThe purpose of disclosure statements is to provide enough information to allow creditors and interest holders to make an informed decision in voting on the plans.\n\nOnce the disclosure statements are approved, creditors will vote on the plans. To be confirmed, a plan must win approval of a majority of creditors in each class. Those approving the plan in each creditor class must also represent two thirds of the total debt held by all creditors voting in that class.\n\nA confirmation hearing on the amended Revco and Eckerd plan has been scheduled for March 11."
