        "text": "TWINSBURG, Ohio -- A study of the 1986 leveraged buyout of Revco D.S. Inc. said the deal may have left the company with too little money to operate the business and effectively left the company insolvent.\n\nThe New York law firm of Kelley Drye and Warren that specializes in bankruptcy cases asked professor Barry Zaretsky of the Brooklyn Law School to review the buyout.\n\nThe law firm said Wednesday the findings could support its claim that the buyout was 'a fraudulent conveyance.'\n\nRevco, the nation's second-largest drugstore chain, announced in January 1990 that under its bankruptcy reorganization it would sell 712 stores in 17 states.\n\nSidney Dworkin, who founded the company with a single drugstore in Detroit 33 years ago, took the company private in a $1.2 billion leveraged buyout on Dec. 29, 1986.\n\nDespite optimistic sales and earnings forecasts, Revco plunged into the red, losing $59 million in fiscal 1987 and $150.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 1988 before filing for federal bankruptcy protection.\n\nDworkin was ousted in 1987.\n\nIf the bankruptcy judge agrees with the findings in the 300-page report, he could force banks and bondholders who financed the leveraged buyout farther behind in a line of creditors seeking money Revco owes them, the professor said.\n\nAmong other things, the judge could order investment bankers, accountants, and lawyers involved in the leveraged buyout who did not render services to Revco to return their fees.\n\nZaretsky, an expert in bankruptcy proceedings, said his report could have widespread implications in other cases in which a company failed shortly after undergoing a buyout that involves debt-financing. The law professor said he combed 200,000 pages of documents related to the buyout and interviewed 50 people.\n\nIn May 1989 eight men accused of insider trading in the leveraged buyout agreed to pay $1.8 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint involving the Insider Trading Act of 1984. They, however, did not admit or deny the allegations.\n\nThe SEC alleged the defendants violated anti-fraud provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act in connection with the sale of Revco.\n\nOne of the men involved was Glenn Golenberg, principal owner of Golenberg & Co., an investment banking company in Cleveland that served as adviser for leveraged buyout.\n\nPlans call for Revco to keep 1,161 stores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and eastern Tennessee.\n\nNo evidence of actual fraudulent intent was found in the report. But Zaretsky said the determination that the trasfer of Revco's asets and the huge debt incurred by the leveraged buyout 'likely constituted a fraudulent conveyance.'"
