Revco D.S. Inc. became part of 1980s business lore as the first big debt-financed takeover to seek bankruptcy refuge. Now the drug chain could make 1990s history by showing the Chapter 11 prescription worked.

After four years, Revco is due to re-emerge from federal bankruptcy protection this week, smaller, wiser and unfettered by overwhelming debts.

The company announced Monday that creditors have accepted its plan of reorganization. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold White has scheduled a Wednesday hearing to review the creditor approval.

Once one of the nation's biggest pharmacy chains, Revco is about 40 percent smaller than it was in 1988. It now runs a network of 1,125 stores in 10 states from headquarters in Twinsburg, Ohio.

But the surviving stores have been modernized, benefiting from the financial flexibility that bankruptcy protection affords troubled companies.

The reorganization will preserve Revco managers' goal of keeping the company independent of two former suitors, rivals Rite Aid and Eckerd.

The only clear losers are the holders of some classes of Revco "junk bonds," who will only get a tiny fraction of their initial investment back.
