Revco D.S. Inc., the drugstore chain that emerged from bankruptcy last month, said today that its board had named Sam Zell and Talton Embry, two of its biggest investors, to be co-chairmen.

The announcement by Revco follows its decision last week to name D. Dwayne Hoven president and chief operating officer. Mr. Hoven was executive vice president of marketing and stores for Revco's 1,143 outlets. Mr. Hoven may become Revco's chief executive, depending on his performance, David Schultie, Mr. Zell's partner, said.

Neither Mr. Zell nor Mr. Embry was immediately available for comment.

Revco's stock closed today at $8.625, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

The board made the largely ceremonial decision Monday at a meeting in New York. Mr. Zell's Zell/Chilmark Fund L.P. of Chicago owns about 19.5 percent of Revco's common stock. Mr. Embry's Magten Asset Management Corporation of New York owns 16.5 percent of Revco. Revco reported annual sales of $2.1 billion last year.
