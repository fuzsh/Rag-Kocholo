Revco D.S. Inc., the drugstore chain, received court approval today for its bankruptcy reorganization disclosure statement, meaning creditors will now be able to vote on the plan.

A hearing was set for March 11 to review the results of the voting. Revco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in July 1988 after a leveraged buyout.

Revco's plan is now the only one left since the rival Jack Eckerd Corporation decided to drop its takeover offer. Revco agreed to pay Eckerd $7.5 million to cover its expenses. Eckerd's plan would have merged the two drugstore chains.

Revco, based in Twinsburg, Ohio, operates 1,150 drugstores in 10 states.

During a hearing on the disclosure statement, Boake Sells, Revco chairman, said he was anxious to have just one plan for Revco's future.
