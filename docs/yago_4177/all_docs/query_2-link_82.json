        "text": "Things Getting Strange\n\nAugust 3, 2024\n\nI don’t know about you, but to me things are getting strange around here, the world and all. I’m sure I’m not alone in echoing the immortal words of Marvin Gaye in his 1971 hit: “What’s Going On?” So, what’s going on? I’m not sure. But as for me, I’m finishing up work on my […]\n\nEinstein’s Riddle\n\nFebruary 4, 2024\n\nThis is a famous riddle: There are five houses lined up next to each other along a street. Each house is a different color, and each homeowner is of a different nationality, drinks a different beverage, smokes a different brand of cigar, and owns a different pet. If these variables can never repeat from house […]\n\nChristmas 2023\n\nDecember 26, 2023\n\nChristmas is here! Finally! Although, really Advent seemed to go by in a flash. And we got a White Christmas. We weren’t just dreaming of a white Christmas, we got one, and it was lovely. We didn’t get a lot but a pretty dusting like a present given on Christmas morn. And from Midnight Mass: […]\n\nAlmost Christmas!\n\nDecember 16, 2023\n\nLooking back at my last post on September 30, I was saying it was almost October. Well, now it’s almost Christmas! Wow! This tells me two things: First, that I don’t update this blog very often! Second, that time is moving faster than fast these days!! So, given that, I hope your Christmas preparations are […]\n\nAlmost October\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\nIt’s amazing to think about, but time has really been flying by lately! God did say that He would speed up time, and He wasn’t lying (not that God would). Time’s a movin’ on, as someone might have said once. Anyway, that’s all I really wanted to say right now. I’ll catch you next time, […]\n\n11/22/63\n\nApril 11, 2023\n\nBook Review Well, I finally did it. I read (to the very end) Stephen King’s massive novel, 11/22/63. I say finally, because I had checked this book out of the library before but had never gotten past reading the back cover, maybe out of fear of the time commitment involved in reading it. How can […]\n\nNew Year 2023\n\nJanuary 15, 2023\n\nI hope everyone enjoyed celebrating Christmas, the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! And what now? Well, a new year has dawned, so let’s make the most of it!\n\n11 Days ‘Till Christmas\n\nDecember 14, 2022\n\nThere are now only 11 days until Christmas, one day fewer than yesterday! But how the time creeps by. If only it were now.\n\n12 Days ‘Till Christmas!\n\nDecember 13, 2022\n\nThere are only 12 days until Christmas, the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ! If you’re not already deep into preparations for the arrival of the King, delay no longer and begin now.\n\nThanksgiving\n\nNovember 25, 2022\n\nWell, it’s the day after Thanksgiving and all through the house, not a belly was empty not even a mouse’s. Nice start to a poem! Now what? I’ve never been much of a poet, but I appreciate a good rhyme anytime. My apologies to Clement Clarke Moore."
