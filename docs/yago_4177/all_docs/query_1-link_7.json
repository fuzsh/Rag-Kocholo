        "text": "Contemporary Iranian cinema has enjoyed wide success on the international scene—winning awards at film festivals, receiving praise by critics, and being screened in many countries around the world. But this success has another side to it: at home in Iran, the movie theater attendance is in decline and a range of players, including individuals, policymakers and government entities continue to meddle in shaping its future. Throughout the twentieth century and during the two decades of post-revolutionary successes abroad, Iranian cinema developed its own unique style and aesthetic. A cinema which was sometimes nurtured and financially encouraged by the government, yet at other times censored or banned by it. This paper provides a brief survey of the history of Iranian cinema since the 1900s in order to reveal the paradoxical issues both propelling and bedeviling its development and the role of principal actors involved in fashioning an Iranian national cinema.\n\n11 Afkhami now (2007) believes that the national Iranian cinema is more or less dead. He argues that almost all governments after the revolution have worked toward the weakening of the Iranian national cinema without realizing that this would lead to surrendering to American commercial cinema for entertaining the public. See Etemaad Melli, 13 Esfand 1385/4 March 2007, 316:12.\n\n17 For example, the screening of Do Nime ye Seeb (Two Halves of the Apple, 1992) by Kianoush Ayyari was interrupted in a number of movie theaters in Tehran by religious hardliners in 1993. About 60 people entered Qods movie theater in Isfahan and interrupted a screening on 5 December 1997. In 1995, Adam Barfi (The Snow Man), and in 2004, Marmoulak (Lizard) faced similar objections. Quoted from film critic Zaven Ghookasian, with permission.\n\n30 Abbas Kiarostami, one of the most prolific Iranian filmmakers, remarked at a press conference during the 25th International Fajr Film Festival that banning and censoring was no longer effective, because people would have access to the films through their illegal reproduction on video compact discs (VCDs) and digital versatile discs (DVDs). He believes banning film only hurts the independent cinema in Iran. See Etemaad Melli, 23 Bahman 1385/12 February 2007, 291: 8.\n\n34 According to UNESCO's Institute for Statistics, Iran had 448 movie theaters in 1975. By 1995, the number had been reduced to 287. The annual attendance was recorded at 163 million in 1980, shrinking to 26 million in 1995. See http://www.uis.unesco.org/TEMPLATE/html/CultAndCom/Table_IV_13_Asia.html, retrieved 7 May 2007. The Cinema Shahr Institute, a government entity overseeing the reconstruction of movie theaters in the country, reports remodeling of some of the old movie theaters, or construction of new ones in Iran. Still, the number of active movie theaters is less than the pre-Revolution period. For current information on the status of movie theaters in Iran, see Cinema Shahr Institute's website, http://www.cinemashahr.ir (in Persian).\n\n48 Author Jamal Shirmohammadi believes success in representing Iranian cinema at international festivals was one of the main accomplishments of Seyed Mohammad Beheshti, the first director of Farabi Cinema Foundation. Whether he had the approval of the Iranian government is not clear. Beheshti's other major accomplishment, according to Shirmohammadi, was wining the battle against a more hardline group at the Art Center in setting up direction and policies for the Iranian cinema. See Shirmohammadi, Syasatgozaran Ya Syasabazan-e Cinema-ye Ba'd az Enghelab, 312.\n\n56 After Mr Ahmadinejad took over as president in June 2005, a number of pro-Islamic Republic filmmakers such as Hatami Kia, Majidi, and Darvish, asked the spiritual leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, to prevent radical Muslim filmmakers such as Shamaghdari, Shoorjeh, and Salahshour from being appointed to the key positions in cinematic affairs. They succeeded.\n\n58 A good number of films in the competition were selected from war film genre, labeled “Sacred Defense” (Defa'-e Moqaddas), and spiritual or religious films labeled “Ma'nagara”. The best film award was given to a war film, The Third Day. Other awards mainly went to war or religious films. See Houshmand Honarkar, “Rooz -e Sevvom Behtarin Film -e Jashnvareh Shod” [The Third Day Became the Best Film of the Festival], 11 February 2007, http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2007/02/printable/070211_v-hh-fajr-film-end.shtml, retrieved 2 February 2007."
