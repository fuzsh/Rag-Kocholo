        "text": "A screening of Abel Gance’s newly-restored 1927 masterpiece ‘Napoleon by Abel Gance’ kicked off the 77th Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday. The film, one of the last large-scale productions of the silent film era, premiered at the Debussy Theatre as part of the ‘Cannes Classics’ series, just six months after Ridley Scott’s remake of the film premiered at Salle Pleyel in Paris.\n\nThe screening was the culmination of a 16-year restoration effort, completed with funding from the Golden Globe Foundation, which started in 2008 when researchers at the Cinemathèque française in Paris discovered reels of the film in Abel Gance’s archives. Restoration specialists from the Cinemathèque française were in attendance along with its former president Costa-Gavras, who described the film as “a lyrical poem, a testament of one man’s passion for another”.\n\nFestival Director Thierry Frémaux introduced the film, describing the restoration as an “exceptional moment”. Gance’s original version of the film hadn’t been seen since 1927 when it was shown at the Opera Garnier in Paris in front of then French President Gaston Doumergue. Cannes’s Debussy Theatre sits just 250 yards away from a site Napoleon camped at after fleeing the island of Elba in March 1815.\n\nThe seven-hour epic was renowned for its ambitious scenes and innovative camera work, requiring dozens of stars and thousands of extras. Hundreds of crew members took on immense challenges throughout the production. Hand-held and horse-mounted cameras captured panoramic battles sequences, originally shown on three screens simultaneously, each with a separate projector, to capture the full scope. Film distributors at the time demanded shorter edits resulting in more than 20 versions of the film making their own expeditions around the globe.\n\nLEFT: Abel Gance at the time of the production of Napoleon.

The film was reconstructed and restored by the Cinemathèque française with the support of Fondation Napoléon, Netflix, the laboratory Éclair Classics/L’Image Retrouvée, CNC – Centre national du cinéma et de l’image animée, Michel Merkt, TransPerfect Media, Aline Foriel-Destezet, Golden Globe Foundation, Ministère de la Culture, Micèle Ray-Gavras, The Foundation of Friends of the Cannes Festival, Centre National de la Musique, Radio France, Sacem, and France TV.\n\nFROM TOP: (1): Still image from ‘Napoleon by Abel Gance’.
