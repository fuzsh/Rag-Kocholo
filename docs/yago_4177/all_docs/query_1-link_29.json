There the riposte is made by Charles Lamb in his famous stutter, and the English essayist employs it as an excuse to his tolerant boss at the East India Company. Of course, Howard Dietz could have reinvented Lamb's excuse or adapted it to his own situation. That was certainly the case with \"Honey, I forgot to duck\"—Ronald Reagan's much-quoted line to Nancy after he was shot in 1981. The original (without the Honey) appeared on a telegram to Jack Barrymore from Jack Dempsey, after Gene Tunney defeated him as world heavyweight boxing champion in 1926. Epigrams and witticisms have an afterlife quite independent of their authors. Then there are events which have taken place within living memory, such as the stealing of John Barrymore's body from the mortuary by some of his boon companions. They dragged it to Errol Flynn's house on top of\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe Hollywood hills and propped it up in his favorite chair. But who were they? Flynn wrote in his memoirs that the macabre prank had been organized by director Raoul Walsh. The incident is attributed to Peter Lorre by Paul Henreid; they were both acting in Casablanca at the time. My oldest friend from old Hollywood, Rudi Fehr, tells me categorically that the perpetrator was the actor Albert Dekker. Gene Fowler's biography of Barrymore, written soon after his friend's demise, does not even mention Errol Flynn. Proper allocation of credits has always been problematic in the movie business. And, as Otto Friedrich remarked in his City of Nets, \"All the best Hollywood stories have several contradictory versions.\" All three of the versions above at least agree that the prank took place. Paul Henreid tells another story, of Jack Warner's commissioning a portrait of his wife from Salvador Dali. When the painting was unveiled at a huge party at his mansion, Warner found his own likeness in the face of a monkey painted in the background; he is then supposed to have shut away the picture, as he did some of his motion pictures he did not want the public to see. Again I asked Rudi Fehr, who had been one of Jack Warner's closest associates for three decades; he called the monkey business pure fantasy—the mogul had the painting proudly displayed in his house. For a while I hesitated about including the story in this collection, but then I reminded myself that such scruples, taken to their logical conclusion, would result in a very slim volume, with more footnotes than text. More importantly, it would no longer be a book of anecdotes. The genre is not about facts or history, though there might be more than a hint of truth to H. L. Mencken's definition of the historian as an unsuccessful novelist. With anecdotes, story is everything, and in this respect there is a happy coincidence with the craft of the scenarist. The material of life— most of it immaterial or antithetical to drama—has to be chopped up and fashioned into something that will hold large numbers of people entertained or in suspense. Facts and research become background; characters and episodes are transposed, eliminated, or invented; key moments, especially the ending, often changed. The best screenwriters and film-makers know that reality on the screen must be manufactured, not out of arbitrary judgment, but in order to serve the story. There is no pretense at objectivity; as with the camera, point of view creates the picture. In the history of Hollywood movies, Ronald Reagan is of small importance, except perhaps for his tenure as president of the Screen Actors Guild during the period of McCarthyism and the breakup of MCA. From an anecdotal viewpoint, if Reagan had not become President of the United States he would also be minor: there are no witticisms from his Hollywood\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nyears that stand out, no stories that have not been told as well or better about others. But he did become President and so even minor incidents and casual sayings gain importance. They are embroidered by the tellers who thereby hope to garner greater significance. As Reagan grew to be a national and then world figure, everything he had said or people remembered about his Hollywood years (remarkably little, all things considered) was examined with a microscope and found to be prophetic. Reagan proved to be also the most anecdotal President since Abraham Lincoln, and as several historians have begun to show, he believed more in jokes and stories from his old movies than in facts reported by his aides. So in a circular way, the Reagan anecdotes did become relevatory about the workings of Hollywood and of Washington, which is why he looms large in one chapter of this book. A somewhat different distortion is caused by the innumerable stories associated with Samuel Goldwyn, who was indeed a giant figure in the first fifty years of Hollywood's history. He gained notoriety because of peculiarities in his language which reflected the even more peculiar way his brain worked. For the second half of his life Goldwyn ran an independent studio which was based on his taste and vision rather than on star actors, writers, or directors. That is why his press agents began to focus on his personality to fuel the insatiable publicity engine that sells movies. When they got everybody in Hollywood to laugh, Goldwyn tried to stop the machine and denied authorship of the mangled aphorisms attributed to him. But, as often happens with the dominant figures of any field in any age, anecdotes about more obscure people became attached to him, especially if a story or saying became so exaggerated through constant retelling that it required a larger-than-life personality. I felt it my obligation as an anecdotist to pass on as many of these famous Goldwynisms and stories as possible, rather than be pedantic about their origin. It is the story, as it typified an aspect of film-making, or of the Hollywood system, that interested me, not the casting in one particular remake. Apart from gathering relatively large numbers of stories about a few of these archetypal figures and genuine wits, I have made no attempt to be comprehensive. Indeed, it would have been futile to do so; after all, what would constitute completeness? A story that pleases one, bores another. Also the volume of old material is staggering and, given the steady flow of new movie biographies and memoirs, must be endless. I have tried to include most of the classic anecdotes that movie-makers and buffs still tell each other, and find some lesser known stories that deserve to be remembered. But, despite the distinguished publisher, this is not meant to be a\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nscholarly book. I give sources only when quoting directly; the same story crops up so many times that it would have been arbitrary to cite one provenance over another. I have built, of course, on previous collections (as they did, too), but the selection is highly personal. The groupings and order are meant to enhance and surround each anecdote with a context. For the same reason I provided in most cases a date, which must be taken as approximate, since the year a film is made, released, or given an Oscar, may all be different. As in my two volumes of theatrical anecdotes, here, too, the past preponderates. This is in the nature of the beast. When you ask for somebody's best stories, they are likely to be of a vintage year, not last week's. Anecdotes about a golden age have a mythical quality, and it seems easier to be immortal, Goldwyn might have said, if you are dead. It is also safe to say that the ruthless egotists of the pioneer era were a good deal more colorful than the accountants, lawyers, and corporate executives who run the studios these days, often from New York or Tokyo. At the same time, I did include some stories about living, younger figures who are well on their way to becoming legendary. Although there is a great deal of amusing and tragic gossip associated with movie stars, which fill the tabloids, I avoided the purely sleazy and the merely scandalous. Because the film community has always been global, I wanted to collect more anecdotes from Europe, Canada, Australia, India, Japan, but I must admit that these were swamped—as are the films of all foreign countries— by the product from Hollywood. The best stories took place in the movie capital, which of course has attracted talent from countries all over the world. In its heyday—from the twenties to the forties—Hollywood was an oasis where wit was more highly prized and paid than anywhere else since the days of Charles II in Restoration England; where more stories were told than in the Chicago newsrooms or the cafes of central Europe—often by the exiled habitues of these places. The movie colony is still a venue for fads and follies, but in those days the best wits from Broadway and the Algonquin Round Table recorded each wretched excess. A huge domestic and foreign press corps lived and died for items; columnists killed for exclusivcs; comedians trod on each other's gags. Even after that Hollywood died, aging show people have poured forth their memories on paper and on talk shows, retailing those same stories of long, long ago. So this collection mainly consists of period pieces, some from the silent era, many in black and white, not colorized, I hope. Because I had collected the anecdotes out of sequence, I had to edit hundreds of bits and pieces into a montage of verbal images. They arc taken from larger pictures\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv ii\n\nand tell only part of the story. I selected the shots I needed for my continuity, with many scenes ending up on the cutting room floor. The result may not be Hitchcock, Bergman, or Fellini, but I will be satisfied if the reader said afterwards: That's Entertainment.\n\nP.H. Los Angeles June 1990\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1\n\nPast History\n\nVisionaries Auguste Lumiere, who with his brother Louis invented modem cinematography, gave the following advice back in 1895: \"Young man, you can be grateful that my invention is not for sale, for it would undoubtedly ruin you. It can be exploited for a certain time as a scientific curiosity, but apart from that it has no commercial value whatsoever.\" Adolph Zukor hired Edwin Porter in 1912 to make six pictures a year for Famous Players. \"There isn't that much talent in the world,\" said Porter. When Warner Brothers shocked the film world with the announcement of The Jazz Singer (1927), the first feature film with sound, a reporter sought out Irving Thalberg on his honeymoon for comment. \"Novelty is always welcome,\" opined the all-powerful production chief of MGM, \"but talking pictures are just a fad.\" 3\n\n4\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nNot all the Warner brothers were behind the innovation which was adopted out of a make-or-break desperation by their studio. When Harry Warner heard about plans to break the sound barrier, he said: \"Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?\" Panic in the Aisles D. W. Griffith has been credited, among many other technical innovations, with the invention of the close-up, although some historians attribute it to his cameraman, Billy Bitzer. Not everybody hailed this new development. When the financial backers first saw an actor close-up in the projection room, they were startled. \"It's murder,\" opined one of them. \"Whoever heard of a face with no legs in sight?\" \"Museums are full of masterpieces with nothing but large and arresting faces,\" Griffith retorted. \"If the face tells what I mean it to tell, an audience will forget all about legs, arms, liver and lungs.\" Henry Marvin, Griffith's boss at Biograph was even more blunt. \"We paid for the whole actor, Mr. Griffith,\" he is supposed to have said: \"We want to see all of him.\" Abel Gance, the French pioneer who sometimes has been called \"the D. W. Griffith of Europe,\" also got into trouble with introducing close-ups into his film Barberousse (1916). \"What are these huge pictures supposed to mean?\" asked his producer, Louis Nalpas, threatening to close down production. \"You'll have people panicking in the cinema. They'll make for the exits!\"\n\nThe Rest Is Silence When Jimmy Durante's first picture, Roadhouse Nights, was released in 1930, his father Bartolomeo went to see his son on the big screen three times. Asked what he thought of the movie, the elder Durante adapted Hamlet's view of the world to the talkies. He simply said: \"Talk! Talk! Talk!\" Overnight Success Ben Lyon came to movies from the theatre. The change to sound caught him in an endless project with Howard Hughes, called Hell's Angels\n\n5\n\nPast History\n\n(1930), which took two years to make because Hughes was a perfectionist and he also insisted on making both a silent and a sound version. This was an era when studios were turning out pictures in four weeks, and by the time he emerged from Hell's Angels, Ben Lyon was practically forgotten. So when his friend Henry Duffy invited him back to act on the stage in a legitimate play, Lyon jumped at the chance to work. It was in a Los Angeles revival of Boomerang, a Broadway play Lyon had done ten years before, and since he was working for almost nothing, the actor invited everybody in Hollywood to remind them of his existence. The theatre was packed with directors, producers, and studio executives, and when Lyon made his first entrance and uttered his first line, there was a stir and a buzz that went through the audience, reaching him on stage: \"My god, he can talk!\" That week Lyon got three movie offers and he was a star again.\n\nRead My Lips There was much speculation in the silent era about what words were actually formed by the actors' lips. One story had a girl being carried by her lover to bed in a tender swoon, while her lips read: \"If you drop me, you bastard, I'll kill you.\" Conrad Nagel, one of the silent era stars, knew of one rehearsal in which an actor with a hangover was trying to lift an actress unsuccessfully from the floor. \"Use your breath,\" she advised him, \"that's strong enough to do the job.\" Bring on the Wits As silent movies developed literary story lines, producers began to look to sophisticated wits who could write titles that \"hit the back wall,\" as the jargon had it. Herman Mankiewicz, in the vanguard of the journalistic Broadwayites to be seduced by Hollywood, excelled at composing cards that packed a one-two punch. \"Derely Devore, the star, rose from the chorus because she was cool in an emergency—and warm in a taxi,\" he wrote for a film called Take Me Home (1928). For Three Week-Ends (1928) Mankiewiez wrote: \"I've got as much chance to wash in private as a six month old baby.\" Another title read: \"Paris, where half the women are working women . . .\" followed quickly by: \". . . and half the women are working men.\"\n\n6\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nFire Joseph Mankiewiez, Herman's younger brother, recalled the panic stars felt in front of the microphone. One day there was a fire at Paramount, and Clara Bow ran out screaming: \"I hope to Christ it was the sound stages!\"\n\nProblem Like many a worried silent star, Marion Davies went to see The Jazz Singer. She watched the first talking picture in quiet concentration. At the end the mistress of William Randolph Hearst turned to the MGM publicity man who had escorted her, and said: \"M-m-m-ister Voight, I-I-I have a p-p-problem.\"\n\nA Sound Deal The breakthrough of sound pictures caught most studios off-guard. MGM tried to get into the act by putting together an anthology of the greatest silent stars, and selling it with the slogan: \"Hear the stars talk!\" The most famous silent actor of course was a mime. Charlie Chaplin was asked if he would do two minutes of talking in front of the camera. \"I was in a jam,\" Chaplin later said, explaining how his reputation for being money-mad had come about. \"If I agreed to do it I should have made a fool of myself, because I had never spoken on the screen and it could harm the picture I was making. If I refused, everyone would have thought me crazy to turn down the offer of good money for a couple of minutes. They went away muttering, but at least my reputation as a commercially minded film man was intact.\" A Tramp Is Born One of the important motion picture pioneers was William N. Selig, a young magician and showman, who was among other things responsible for the career of the great black comedian, Bert Williams. In the midiSgos, Selig acquired a purloined copy of a Lumiere Cinematographe, the French machine which could both take and project moving pictures. Up to his time the story of cinematography was mainly that of technological innovation. As Terry Ramsaye chronicles it in A Million and One Nights, finally somebody became interested in what the new medium could do to provide entertainment.\n\nPast History\n\n7\n\nThe early Selig pictures were made about the streets of Chicago and in backyards when it was desirable to escape the curious passersby. One of the classic first Selig productions was The Tramp and the Dog, a backyard comedy. It was nearly a hundred and fifty feet long. In this startling drama a tramp knocks at the back door for a hand-out and is chased off the premises and over the fence by the vigilant bulldog. An unforeseen happening added vastly to the success of this picture. As the tramp clambered over the fence the dog attached himself with great tenacity to the seat of the tramp's ragged pants. There was a brief struggle in which the genuinely frightened actor tumbled down the outside of the fence as the dog dropped back victorious with a large mouthful of pants in full view upstage, center. The bulldog scene was a tremendous hit, just as it would be today. Here was the discovery for the screen of the basic humor of pants. Pants have always been a joke, despite all efforts to dignify them as trousers. Motion picture comedy without pants would be unthinkable.\n\nInitiation It is difficult to meet anyone with extensive dealings with movie people who will not have some horror story of having been cheated, bamboozled, or deceived. The early motion-picture business was lawless, cut-throat competition between trusts and robber barons, who ruthlessly exploited the original inventors or circumvented their patents. American film-makers moved first from Manhattan to Fort Lee, New Jersey, and then to California, primarily to escape the law. Fred J. Balshofer, one of the pioneer cameramen, describes, in One Reel a Week, how he got initiated into the business in 1905 in the shop of Siegmund \"Pop\" Lubin, an optician turned entrepreneur. After two years with the Shields Lantern Slide Company, I had saved a little money, so I decided to take a vacation in south Jersey near Atlantic City. On the way home it was necessary to change trains in Philadelphia. I took the opportunity to take a few days to see the city. As I strolled along Eighth Street, my attention was caught by a store with the entrance between two plate glass windows. Gold letters on one window read \"Siegmund Lubin, Optician\" and on the other \"Manufacturer of Moving Pictures.\" Moving pictures were now magic words to me, and on an impulse I entered the store. I hardly anticipated that this moment would change my career and start me in an industry where I would remain the rest of my working life.\n\n8\n\nMovie Anecdotes After a moment Mr. Lubin came from the back of the store. He was a bald-headed, stoop-shouldered man, well over six feet tall, and when he talked he really mangled the English language. I told him I would like a job in his moving picture company. Lubin didn't say a word but looked me over like he was appraising a horse before buying it. I stood awkwardly embarrassed until he finally spoke. \"You can vaste tousands of dollars if you don't know vat you are doing in diss moving picture business,\" was Lubin's first remark. \"What makes you think I don't know what I'm doing?\" I responded. \"I know photography and I have been making illustrated song slides for the past two years.\" Mr. Lubin's sole reaction was a slight smile. Then I told him of my years with Underwood and Underwood. \"You make money?\" Lubin inquired. I told him I'd been doing just fine. \"Then vy don't you stay in the singing business?\" I explained to Lubin that there had been a decline in the use of song slides and that I thought that moving pictures were a growing business. This seemed to make an impression on him and, after further conversation, we settled on a week's trial. I was so afraid I might not have a chance, even for a week, of learning something about the moving picture business that I forebore to ask Mr. Lubin how much he planned to pay me. The real surprise was that for several weeks I never had the chance to photograph anything. I was kept busy in the laboratory in the basement of the store making duplicates of pictures that had been produced in France, by the Melies company and Pathe Freres. We called them \"dupes\" from of course \"duplicates.\" I simply printed a negative from a positive print and from that duped negative made as many positive prints as Lubin could sell to his customers. In those days each moving picture company had its own trademark which was usually placed in some prominent place in the picture to ensure its visibility. The Melies trademark was a star, and Pathe used a rooster in a circle. I spent a lot of time blocking out the trademark on each individual frame under a magnifying glass, using a camel's hair brush dipped in opaque. When customers came to the store to buy moving pictures, Mr. Lubin brought them down to the laboratory and I would show some of our duped pictures on a small screen. When the selection had been made, the customer paid in advance. Then I would make the prints to be shipped. It required little intelligence to know that this was shady business, but Mr. Lubin carried on the practice as if it were perfectly ordinary and completely legitimate. . . .\n\nPast History\n\n9\n\nIn my two years with Lubin, there is one incident I don't think I'll ever forget. He asked me to screen some pictures for a prospective buyer who didn't disclose his identity but said he was in the market to buy some films. As we sold to anyone who had the cash, Lubin hustled the customer into a small screening room where I was waiting to grind the projector, which was set up without a booth. After showing a few of the pictures made by Lubin without a sale, he had me run some dupes. Among them was A Trip to the Moon, one of Melies's best pictures. Practice had made me quite expert at blocking out the trademarks, and the job on this picture was so good it was hard for our customer to believe his eyes. Suddenly he jumped up from his chair, shot his arm out in front of the beam of light from the projector, and shouted, \"Stop the machine.\" Startled, I stopped grinding and turned on the light. Lubin stared at him wondering what was wrong. We found out soon enough when the prospective buyer shouted, \"You want me to buy that film?\" Lubin wanted to know why not. \"I,\" the man bellowed thumping his chest, \"I made that picture. I am Georges Melies from Paris.\" The man, quite naturally, was in a wild rage. Lubin glared at him and, pointing to me, brazenly began telling Melies what a hard time I had had blocking out the trademark. Lubin's defiant attitude stunned Mr. Melies, and he stood there speechless. Lubin seemed to consider the incident a joke, and I was dumbfounded when he went out laughing. I didn't see the humor of the situation as Melies was in such a rage he could have become physically violent, but he soon stamped out of the room. After that, whenever I was asked to run dupes for prospective buyers I was always a bit fearful.\n\nThe Past Is Prologue The quest for originality in movies has a long history. One of the first pictures wholly made in Hollywood was The Law of the Range (1911), shot by Al Christie for the Nestor Company. After establishing a studio near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower, Christie took a tour. He looked in on his scenario editor, and asked him what he was up to. \"I'm working on a scenario,\" said the writer. \"Do you think it will make a good picture?\" asked the boss encouragingly. \"Why not?\" the scenarist replied, \"it always has.\"\n\n1o\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nThe King of Comedy The first satire about the movies, The Small Town Idol (1921), naturally found favor with the critics. One of them praised its producer, Mack Sennett, by likening him to Moliere. The king of comedy was pleased and showed the review to his title writer, Johnny Grey, asking him: \"Who is this fellow Moly-something?\" D. W. Griffith, who happened to overhear the question, cut in: \"Moliere was a smart French plagiarist who hired three men to do his thinking for him.\"\n\nTo Catch a Thief D. W. Griffith, forgotten but not gone from Hollywood, was asked by journalist Ezra Goodman what he thought of Orson Welles's innovative Citizen Kane (1941). The veteran director replied that he \"particularly loved the ideas he took from me.\"\n\nGold Rush Days Although movies were made in many locations all over the world, and businesses sprang up in different countries, only one place became an industry town, coeval and synonymous with making pictures. Jack Hasty, an old-fashioned newspaperman, covered the second gold rush that began in California around 1920, which he recalled in his book Done With Mirrors (1943). The mythical city of Hollywood had not as yet arisen out of the smoke of press agents' speeding typewriters. Where it is now presumed to stand was a dry and desolate area stretching north of Los Angeles, a dusty, discouraged expanse of terrain dotted with rubbish heaps, sign boards, dilapidated chicken farms, and the remnants of exploded subdivisions. The moving-picture business was scattered all over Southern California. Bronco Billy Anderson was producing the first horse operas at National City, close to the California-Mexico border. Lubin had a studio at Coronado in San Diego Bay. American Beauty Films were shooting in Santa Barbara. There were other studios in Burbank, and Culver City, and on the fringes of Los Angeles—studios which, if you were to mention them today, would draw only blank looks—Reliance, Peerless, World, Kalem, Christy. The industry was booming. There\n\nPast History\n\n11\n\nwere opportunities for everyone, and with reasonable luck anybody could get a place in the Klieg light. The Cinderella touch was everywhere. Sales girls became stars. A well-known \"madame\" landed as the head of a casting department, and for a time kept an eye on her former profession, as she didn't believe pictures would last. On the screens of a hundred thousand nickelodeons flashed names which only a few months before had appeared on factory and department-store payrolls. The legitimate stage was as contemptuous of the new art as in a later day the movies were contemptuous of radio; and performers came from almost every vocation except that of the theatre. Cullen Landis drove a truck; Edward Burns sold stocks; William Duncan ran a physical-culture school; George Walsh was a lawyer; Allan Hale was an osteopath. The top scenario writer of the period was a girl still in high school, a girl named Anita Loos. But an ex-sign painter ran a close second, and was fated to hold the highest paid scripting job in the City of Celluloid for a great many years. These were the roaring gold-camp days. The pioneers, who with a dollar and an extra shirt had hit the trail westward, were striking it rich and spending it riotously. Life ran turbulently, played for high comedy and lurid melodrama. Few spots offered as many laughs as did the old Alexandria Hotel when a bunch of the boys and girls were whooping it up of a Saturday night. The evening commenced heavy with decorum and much polite flitting from table to table, exchanging compliments; but by eleven o'clock, when the crowd got down to serious drinking, you learned what picture stars really thought of each other. Waiters were run ragged escorting out drunks and breaking up brawls. Love making went on practically underfoot. It was '49 all over again, but in evening clothes and ermine. Gold!. Gold in California! They had discovered it, and this was their night to howl. Like true pioneers, most of them died broke and not a few with their boots on— William Desmond Taylor, Olive Thomas, Thomas Ince—a long list of them. . . . Pictures were a good source of copy, but the copy was not good. The Arbuckle party which resulted in the death of Virginia Rapp, the story of Wally Reid, the story of Blanche Sweet—these and other scandals made headlines throughout the world, headlines which hit the moving-picture business where it hurt most—in the box office. Through morality clauses in contracts it was possible to exercise some control over the private lives of picture people, but it was much more possible through well-organized press departments to exercise control\n\n12\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nover what was printed about picture people. And so typewriters began to click; typewriters building word upon word the mythical city of Hollywood. Lunatics United Artists was formed in 1919 by Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Charlie Chaplin, and D. W. Griffith. When Richard Rowland, president of Metro, heard news of their venture he expressed the opinion of the whole industry: \"The lunatics have taken charge of the asylum.\" Like so many witty expressions of the period, the phrase may have originated with Wilson Mizner who described these early years of moviemaking circa 1916: \"That was before the bankers had got into the saddle and the inmates were still running the colossal asylums—just where they were running them to was an immediate problem.\" Several generations later, when stars wielded even more power in the film industry, some of the artists came to join the lunatic fringe. \"You spend all your life,\" Jane Fonda was once quoted as saying, \"trying to do something they put people in asylums for.\" Volunteer for the Asylum Will Rogers, a big star on Broadway with the Ziegfeld Follies, was actually living near a mental institution when Rex Beach advised Samuel Coldwyn to use the cowboy-actor for the lead in Laughing Bill Hyde (1919), based on one of Beach's novels. A few years later, Rogers himself described how he got into the movies. I didn't have any more intention of going into pictures than I had of being president of Yale. I was living quiet and peaceful down in Amityville, Long Island, where the insane asylum is, when Mrs. Rex Beach came driving down there one day. She steps out of her royalty on The Spoilers and says: \"Will, you're goin' into the movies.\" I pointed over to the place where they kept the lunatics and told her chauffeur he had come to the wrong place. \"No, Will, I'm serious,\" Mrs. Beach says. I told her my hair wasn't curly, that I couldn't roll a cigarette with one hand, and that I didn't aim to annoy more than one audience at a time. \"You've got to come, Will,\" she insisted. \"The movies is the third\n\n13\n\nPast History biggest business in the world. Safety razors is first, corn plasters second, and movies third.\" Well, I went in. Since then the movies has become the second biggest business in the country. Bootlegging is the biggest. The movies is the grandest show business I know anything about. It's the only place where an actor can act and at the same time sit down in front and clap for himself.\n\nFrom Such Acorns In 1923, when the name of Will Rogers was a great deal better known than that of the fledgling Warner Brothers, Jack Warner approached the cowboy vaudevillian about signing him for a part. Rogers sent back a wire that hung framed for decades in Warner's office: I MIGHT FLY OUT OF HERE AND TO THE LEGION CONVENTION AND WORLD SERIES • BUT IF I DONT AND DONT GET A BETTER OFFER WILL BE GLAD TO BE WITH YOU • WHERE IS YOUR STUDIO? The Warner brothers had begun in business by converting a storefront in Newcastle, Pennsylvania, into a theatre, borrowing the chairs from a nearby undertaker. When there was a funeral, the moviegoers had to stand.\n\nThe First Fifty Years According to Arthur Mayer, living pictures were first used in vaudeville houses as \"chasers\" between acts to drive out the patrons. \"Indeed,\" he wrote in 1953, \"the history of motion pictures might well be summarized to date as starting with drive-outs and culminating with drive-ins.\" Trendsetters Theda Bara was the first star to have a screen personality specially tailored for her by William Fox, who did start his career as a tailor. \"Is it only a coincidence,\" asked British film critic Stanley Walker, \"that he, like some of his most powerful rivals, spent part of his early working life in the garment trade where success depended above all on creating new styles, then persuading people that they wanted them? Fox cut suit linings, Goldwyn sold gloves, Zukor was a furrier, Laemmle's family had owned an outfitter's.\"\n\n14\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nJoseph P. Kennedy entered the movie industry in the mid-1920s and quickly rose to become chairman of Pathe. His business methods were greatly disliked by the founding moguls, and Marcus Loew remarked about the Irishman: \"What's Kennedy doing in pictures? He's not a furrier.\"\n\nA Goldfish Named Goldwyn Samuel Goldfish, who began his career as a glove-maker, formed Goldwyn Pictures in 1918 with the brothers Archie and Edgar Selwyn. When this venture failed, Archie Selwyn complained that his former associate had not only lost most of the Selwyns' money, but had also appropriated one-half of his name. Hollywood wits often wondered what would have happened if young Goldfish had taken the first half of the Selwyns' name and the last of his own. Then the famous malapropisms might now be called Selfishisms.\n\nDay Care Balaban & Katz were one of the early firms to make their fortune in the exhibition of motion pictures, starting in Chicago in 1917. They had to solve many problems as they occurred. Because in those days children under seven were admitted for free, it was difficult to police or verify the right age of every kid who claimed to be under seven. One of the younger Balaban brothers, Dave, decided how tall the average seven-year-old should be. He drew a chalk mark, and kids had to line up under it, in order to get free admission, regardless of age. Arthur Mayer also relates, in his book Merely Colossal, that Abe Balaban set up a combination of valet/day-care service, to keep crying babies out of the picture palaces. The baby carriages were left on the sidewalk outside—in those more innocent days—allowing the mothers to enjoy the show inside. The buggies were numbered, and if one of the tots cried too much, the management would flash a slide on the screen: \"Mother Number 47, your baby is crying.\"\n\nRude Awakening When Mary Pickford went to see Violin Maker of Cremona (1910), one of her first pictures, she came up against the law: I glided proudly up to the theatre with the self-satisfying knowledge that I was a full-fledged motion-picture star, earning five dollars a day!\n\n15\n\nPast History In front of the advertising display, I admired a picture of myself through a golden mist and tripped lightly over my dream cloud to the ticket window and clinked down a dime. \"Whatcha age, Goldilocks?\" snapped the man, \"you gotta be sixteen to get in here!\" Arguments failed. I walked away, a wilted lily—old enough to make movies, but not old enough to see them!\n\nSideshow Most Hollywood studios are impregnable forts. The one exception has been Universal which discovered early that people are willing to pay money to peep backstage at how movies are made. King Vidor, who arrived in Los Angeles in 1915, remembered \"a circus spieler was employed to escort the visitors through the studio and even during the filming of highly emotional scenes the sonorous voice of the professional guide resounded throughout the set and merged with the tinny raspiness of the portable organ employed to keep the actors in the proper mood. The visitors were charged twentyfive cents per head and the studio realized hundreds of dollars per day out of this annoying by-product.\"\n\nBlind Justice In the early days of Universal Pictures, Carl Laemmle had come through another round of litigation over patent infringement that was endemic to the industry. After the customary delays, the suit finally got to court in New York. Laemmle was on the West Coast, when he received a cable from his lawyer. It simply read: \"JUSTICE HAS TRIUMPHED.\" The mogul wired back at once: \"APPEAL IMMEDIATELY.\"\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n2\n\nReal to Reel\n\nIf You Must Know Motion pictures, because of the enormous technical complexity involved, is the ultimate art form of our technological era. As Francis Ford Coppola once observed, very few inside the profession are familiar with more than one or two aspects of film-making. And, despite the avalanche of magazines, behind-the-scenes and interview programs, the whole process of how films are made remains a complete mystery to the average moviegoer. Walt Disney was once showing a journalist around his studio, who asked: \"Flow do you stumble, Mr. Disney, on all those remarkable technical developments?\" Disney pointed to a building marked \"Research Department.\" \"Well, you see,\" he said in his slow, deliberate way, \"we maintain a Stumbling Department just for that purpose.\" Director John Rich was taking some outdoor shots for a Western, filming one scene for the seventh time. In a break, while the shot was being set up again, a woman stopped her car to watch. She asked: \"Why do you keep taking the same scene so many times?\" 16\n\n17\n\nReal to Reel\n\n\"Madam,\" said the director wearily, \"have you ever stopped to consider how many theatres there are in this country?\"\n\nReal Tinsel Hollywood discovered early that genuine realism has to be staged. In 1914 Mutual Films, in search of documentary footage, signed up Pancho Villa, the populist bandit of Mexico, and accompanied him on one of his expeditions to fight the Federal troops. Villa agreed—for a consideration of $25,000—to fight all his skirmishes by daylight, and only after movie cameras had been put in place. Villa kept his side of the contract, and his troops never went into combat unless they were accompanied by Mutual's crews bearing the emblem: \"Mutual Movies Make Time Fly.\" However, when the studio executives viewed the footage, they found it too tame for their picture. So they decided to reshoot the battle scenes in a studio, where everything could be under greater control. Arthur Mayer tells a similar story, when Paramount sent a crew to Nevada to shoot an atomic bomb test for War of the Worlds (1953). Finding the blinding flash and mushroom cloud inadequate, the special effects department was given the task of producing a more thrilling blast. Comedies of Errors The early studios cranked out movies at such a rate that errors were bound to occur. One clay copies of a script were left accidentally in the mailbox for two directors, who went out and both shot the same movie. To prevent a loss, one of them was retitled and released a few months later, by which time nobody could remember whether they had seen it before. Director King Vidor also recalled an incident when two studio drivers picked up each other's instructions and delivered their carloads of actors to the wrong location. Rather than waste half a day, the directors of each project simply recast their scripts as best they could and proceeded with the actors they had. Through a Fog Darkly Robert Newton's drinking sometimes made him confused. Once he was supposed to be working on a movie called The Beachcomber (1938); instead he turned up on the set of an English movie, called Always in the Fog.\n\n18\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nThere happened to be a part for an adult delinquent, and since it was a low-budget movie, the director was delighted to have the services of a major star for free. Newton had shot four scenes before the producers from The Beachcomber had tracked him down and hauled him away.\n\nSuperstitious Natives A film called The Adventuress (1946) was being made on the Isle of Man, and the cast was taken each morning by car to the set. Along the route a little bridge had to be crossed, where the native driver insisted that everybody had to greet the fairies to forestall disaster. Everybody in the crowded automobile complied, except Deborah Kerr, star of the movie. She refused to say \"good morning\" to the fairies, because she thought it was silly. The driver refused to cross the bridge. Clouds gathered and it started to drizzle. The stand-off lasted an hour, while both the producer and the director implored Miss Kerr to bow to tradition. Finally she mumbled \"good morning\" to the fairies—and the sky cleared and all was well with the world.\n\nThe Miracle Occasionally in the making of a motion picture something actually turns out better than was planned. It is rare enough that such an event can be attributed to divine intervention. In appropriately awestruck prose, Richard Fleischer described how he lucked on to a shot while directing a biblical epic for Dino De Laurentiis. On the morning of February 15, 1961, on a windswept hill near the medieval village of Roccastrada, some 120 miles north of Rome, the screen version of Barabbas began with the most unique sequence ever filmed. The scene was so emotional and impressive, in fact, that hundreds of villagers who had gathered to watch the film company at work dropped to their knees and prayed, while most of the film crew hurriedly blessed themselves as they worked. It was a moving, unforgettable moment. The unique sequence was the re-enactment of the Crucifixion of Christ against the total eclipse of the sun. This was a once-in-a-lifetime coincidence—the sun to be in total eclipse at the same time that a reenactment of the Crucifixion was about to be filmed. It took a producer with imagination to see the possibilities of this\n\n19\n\nReal to Reel\n\ncombination and then to make full use of it. Mr. De Laurentiis pushed this one sequence six weeks ahead of the scheduled start of actual production in order to take advantage of the unique lighting this natural phenomenon would offer, identical with that which must have prevailed on that fateful day, nearly 2,000 years ago, when, according to the Gospel of Luke, 23:44, \"There came a darkness over the whole land. The sun was in eclipse.\" This scene has made film history, for it is a real \"first\" in motion pictures. In fact, many of his own staff told Mr. De Laurentiis it couldn't be done; that it was impossible to shoot directly into the sun, and that when the eclipse was total there would not be enough light for the Technirama and Technicolor cameras. They insisted it was too costly a gamble. But the producer decided to take the risk and sent a cast and crew to Roccastrada, to at least make an attempt to photograph the scene. That his insistence paid off is now history. Chief Cinematographer Aldo Tonti had no precedent for this particular shot, so he was forced to rely on instinct. But his judgment proved perfect and he captured on film a moment that may never again be repeated. Later, viewing the results, everyone was amazed to see something on the screen that no artificial lighting on a sound stage could ever have duplicated. As the sun began to emerge from the eclipse, it sent rays of light up and out that formed a perfect cross of golden light in the sky, directly above the cross on which Christ was being portrayed. A miracle was provided by nature. Even in the darkest moment of the eclipse, the outlines of the three crosses are still visible, adding drama to a scene already almost unbearable in its emotional beauty. It was during this darkest moment that the onlookers dropped to their knees and prayed. The combination of the eclipse and the re-enactment of the Crucifixion made it seem terribly real to the several thousand persons on that windswept hillside. Cowboys and Indians King Vidor was filming a Western near Gallup in New Mexico, with a group of Zuni Indians as extras. During one setup Vidor noticed some of the braves riding towards him, right up to the camera platform which towered above the horses. Leaning down, the director asked what they wanted. \"When do we go home?\" their spokesman asked. \"Are you not satisfied with the food or your living quarters?\" asked Vidor.\n\n20 20\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\n\"Everything okay,\" said the brave. \"But we are tired of playing cowboys and Indians every day.\" John Ford employed real Indians in Fort Apache (1948), most of which he shot in Monument Valley. The director also got into the habit of finding out each morning what the local medicine man forecast for the day's weather. The predictions were remarkably accurate, and the film people came to rely on them more and more. One morning, there was no weather report. Questioned by Ford, one of the Indian actors told him that the medicine man did not have an answer yet: \"His radio broke down.\" Smoke Signals Another charming story told by Teet Carle and Richard Webb in their book The Laughs on Hollywood took place during one of the Westerns being shot by George Sherman in Navajo country. One particular scene involved the creation of smoke signals used for communication by the Indians. The special effects people had laid down a large quantity of explosive charges some five miles away, and these were set off when the director gave his order via a walkie-talkie. An enormous column of smoke rose behind the hills, and as the crew and cast stood in silent awe, one buckskin-clad Navajo actor was heard sighing: \"God, I wish I'd said that.\" A scene in The Fabulous Texan (1947) required smoke signals sent by the local Indian tribe. Producer Edmund Grainger hired Indians from a nearby reservation to make sure it was performed correctly, and afterward congratulated them for a job well done. \"No problem,\" replied one of the Indian consultants, \"we learned it from the movies.\" In Darkest Africa When MGM was making King Solomon's Mines (1950), they needed some scenes with primitive tribes. The moviemakers arrived in the Congo, the heart of the African jungle, and were appalled to find the natives wearing tennis shoes and Hawaiian shirts. Worst of all, their hair was slicked down and did not look right. Finally, MGM solved the problem by shipping two hundred Afro wigs from Culver City and the tribesmen agreed to wear them.\n\nReal to Reel\n\n21\n\nThe Living Desert Sometimes a director will ask for a small addition or change of the set at the last minute which will tax the ingenuity of the people around him. One well-known story about Oscar Lau, a legendary prop man, took place during the filming of The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936), one of Henry Fonda's early movies. Henry Hathaway was directing the picture on location in the high desert about an hour and a half from Los Angeles. He was about to break for lunch, having set up the shot of a simple burial, when he casually mentioned to Oscar Lau that the freshly dug grave in the next scene would require fresh flowers. Hathaway had been a prop man himself and delighted in posing difficulties for his former colleagues. He now happily went off to lunch with his stars, leaving the panicked Lau with the problem of finding fresh-cut flowers in the middle of the desert in autumn. After lunch, just as the stars were gathering around the grave, and Henry Hathaway was discussing the shot with his cinematographer, Oscar Lau arrived in a cloud of dust and with a dazzling bouquet of fresh flowers. The scene was shot, and the happy prop man told his story. He had remembered that a passenger train always stopped around noon for about half an hour in the desert town of Mojave to take on extra water. Driving at top speed, Lau had just managed to catch it, and by slipping ten dollars to the dining room steward, he could pick all the flowers he wanted from the tables.\n\nThe Rainmaker Sometimes the preparations prior to production, no matter how meticulous, go to waste not because of a mistake or weather. During the making of Shane (1953) George Stevens thought it would be desirable to have a rainstorm during the cemetery scene at Boot Hill. Rain usually falls only when one does not want it, and the location in the wilds of Wyoming had no river or lake nearby to provide reliable and sufficient water. Scouting around the area a good three months before shooting began, Harry Caplan, who was unit production manager, found an animal watering hole. He brought in bulldozers to create a small underground reservoir almost seventy square feet. He bought several gas tanks of the type that are buried underneath your local gas station, and supplementing these with portable army reservoirs, he rigged up hoses to sixteen stands with nozzles which could spray water to simulate rain. Extra water would be trucked in. A couple of days before shooting the scene, George Stevens visited the set. He inspected the terrain from a raised camera platform. All the elabo-\n\n22\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nrate rigging for the rainstorm was artfully hidden or outside the camera's range. After a few minutes, the director climbed down: \"Harry, I've decided to do something else. Scrub the rain,\" he said, walking away. Without another word, the stunned Harry Caplan began to dismantle the work of several months.\n\nNobody Is Indispensable Frank Capra was having problems with a scene which had a parrot in the background. Unfortunately, the bird had picked up the constant megaphonic cry which precedes shooting on a movie set: \"QUIET PLEASE!\" Every time the director called \"Action!\" the parrot would ruin the scene by screaming \"QUIET PLEASE! QUIET PLEASE!\" When nothing worked to achieve silence, Capra fired the parrot.\n\nAnd That's the Way It Is While filming Jaws (1975) in Martha's Vineyard, Steven Spielberg became friendly with Walter Cronkite, still the CBS anchorman at the time, but who was on vacation and pursuing his favorite hobby of sailing. One day Cronkite watched the testing of the mechanical shark, when everything went wrong. Instead of leaping out of the water, the shark became twisted in the cable which controlled it from a hydraulic platform, and only the tail appeared. Seeing Spielberg's total humiliation, Cronkite remarked: \"Have you ever considered a career in broadcasting?\"\n\nFinal Cut Directors always fear that they might be removed from their pictures and the final cut would be made by the producer or some studio hack. Steven Spielberg, who shoots his films in such a way that no editor could make head or tail of the sequence of shots without his presence, likes to repeat a story told to him by William Wellman about the making of Wings (1927). The director was falling so far behind schedule that the investors fired him. Faced with a mass of footage that cohered only in Wellman's head, they were forced to come back and rehire him. Wellman, whom James Mason once described as \"a tough little bastard,\" enjoyed the discomfiture of his producers, and became more resolved than ever to shoot his films his own way.\n\nThe Director's Nightmare One of the classic, and probably apocryphal stories about the problems of film-making has Cecil B. De Mille preparing for the biggest and costliest\n\n23\n\nRed to Reel\n\nshot in one of his colossal epics. At a given signal from the director, high above the battle, thousands of chariots, horses, and extras are engaged in battle, which rages for quite a while, until De Mille shouts: \"Cut!\" The smoke and dust clear, the director turns towards his cameramen to see whether everything was okay, when he hears his cinematographer call out: \"Ready, when you are, C.B.!\" Something fairly similar did occur when William Wellman was directing Wings, the first movie to win an Oscar. An enormous field outside San Antonio had been mined to re-create the battle of Saint-Mihiel of World War I. It was to start at a signal from a little red flag from the observation tower, specially constructed, where the director stood with a large number of city officials to watch the awesome destruction. Producer Jesse L. Lasky was also up there. Acres of carefully planted TNT were set to go off in chain explosions. Two thousand soldiers—Americans and Germans—were standing by with guns in hand. Fifty Army planes, with engines idling, were ready to take off from nearby Kelly Field at the noise of the first blast. Everything was ready—everything but the cameras! Up in the tower, the little daughter of one of the city dignitaries spotted a friend. \"Yoo hoo, Mildred! Here I am,\" she yelled . . . waving the director's red flag. There was no stopping the futile battle of Saint-Mihiel.\n\nConversion John Stahl, the first director whom Louis B. Mayer hired soon after his arrival in Hollywood as a young executive, refused to observe budgets or schedules and insisted on working at his own pace. This annoyed the future czar of movies, who began to call Stahl an uncompromising bastard behind his back. Unfazed, the more experienced director laughed it off: \"All is forgiven when you have a good preview.\"\n\nNow for the Good News Yankee Doodle Dandy had its principal day of photography on the day after Pearl Harbor. The actress Rosemary DeCamp recalled how she was listening with Walter Huston and Jeanne Cagney to President Roosevelt\n\n24\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\non the radio that the United States was at war with Japan and Germany. At that point director Michael Curtiz came on the sound stage with Jimmy Cagney, and they all listened in silence for the national anthem to finish. As the two women dabbed some tears from their eyes, and the men were deeply moved, Curtiz said in his best Hungarian accent: \"Now boys and girls, we have work to do. We have had bad news, but we have a wonderful story to tell the world. So let's put away sad things and begin.\"\n\nLiberties During World War II, after the Soviet Union and America became allies, there was a great deal of government pressure suddenly to produce proRussian films. That is how Jack Warner agreed to undertake Mission to Moscow (1943), based on Ambassador Joseph Davies's book of the same name. (A few years later, during the anti-Communist witch-hunt, this patriotic act came to haunt Jack Warner, who publicly apologized for making it.) The film was shot in a documentary style, which meant that an unusual amount of attention was being paid to historical and factual accuracy. The young Jay Leyda, later to become an important critic and film historian, was hired to do research, because he had worked with Eisenstein and knew the Soviet Union first-hand. Screenwriter Howard Koch remembers how Mike Curtiz, a director with typical Hollywood regard for authenticity, told Leyda at their first meeting: \"Your job is to make everything accurate, but don't forget I have to take liberties.\"\n\nTechnical Expertise Aristotle may have written that drama is the imitation of action, but most movies take this bit of ancient wisdom quite loosely: stories based on real people's lives, or on carefully crafted fiction, end up on the screen bearing only the faintest resemblance to the original. The King brothers, Maurice and Frank, independent producers of exploitation movies in the forties and fifties, tried to improve their image as people who really cared about accuracy and detail. They were planning to make a picture called The Man in the Moon and contacted Albert Einstein at Princeton as the ultimate expert about the secrets of the universe. \"Sorry,\" Einstein wired them back, \"but I am not competent in this matter.\"\n\n25\n\nRed to Reel\n\nTyrone Power was having problems grasping some of the symbolism in The Razor's Edge (1946), the novel by Somerset Maugham. After he had asked one question too many, Darryl Zanuck exclaimed: \"Do I have to bring my barber here for technical director?\"\n\nEarly Tolkien Samuel Marx was story editor at MGM in the thirties. He was visited one day by a man who wanted a job as technical expert on mythical kingdoms. \"I spent most of my life in them and I know all about them,\" he claimed.\n\nGrand Illusion Film critic Judith Crist was devastated to learn from Mervyn Le Roy that the tornado in The Wizard of Oz (1939) was created by a swirling silk stocking in front of the camera. \"I've never forgiven him for telling me that,\" Crist has said, \"and when I watch The Wizard of Oz, I know that it's not a silk stocking.\"\n\nMade in Japan In trying to make The Yakuzaa (1975) as authentic as possible, director Sidney Pollack became immersed in the culture of the Japanese underworld after whom the picture is named. As part of the price of getting the services of Takakura Ken, a star of Japanese gangster movies, Pollack undertook to shoot the film in a Japanese studio controlled by the Yakuza. One of the peculiarities in the code of honor of this Oriental equivalent of the Mafia (which becomes a plot point in Paul Sehrader's script of The Yakuza) is the voluntary removal of a joint from one's finger for any mistake or dishonorable act. The joint is then wrapped up and presented as penance to the wronged party. As soon as Sidney Pollack arrived at the studio in Japan, he noticed a number of employees walking around with hardly any fingers on any hands. And soon after work got under way, one of the transportation people made a mistake in picking up an American star arriving at the airport. \"Afterward,\" Pollack reminisced during a Tarrytown Film Weekend, \"he came into the production office with the first joint of his little finger wrapped up in a handkerchief—and he presented it to the production manager as an apology.\"\n\n26\n\nMovie Anecdotes Acting Is Where You Find It\n\nDespite the careful details that go into preparing a film, some of the most memorable or telling moments come about by accident. Waiting for the sets to be built for Rashomon (1950), Akira Kurosawa was passing the time with the actors at a Kyoto hotel by running 16mm prints. He recalled that one of them was a Martin Johnson jungle film which had a fairly standard shot of a roaming lion. The director told his star, Toshiro Mifune, that he wanted him to be just like that lion. Then Masayuki Mori remembered another jungle film with a black leopard. They screened it, and when the large cat made its menacing appearance, Machiko Kyo hid her face. \"I recognized the gesture,\" Kurosawa told an interviewer. \"It was just what I wanted for the young wife.\" Given such inspiration, it is interesting that Kurosawa was criticized for making the acting technique in Rashomon \"too traditionally Japanese.\" Samurai Bergman More frequently Kurosawa had been labeled as a Western-style director, in the tradition of Shingeki. As an example of how the few great directors in the world influence each other, Ingmar Bergman was asked about his opinion of The Virgin Spring (1959) some ten years after he made it. Bergman called it a \"touristic, lousy imitation of Kurosawa.\" He said he made it when he was infatuated with the Japanese cinema: \"I was almost a samurai myself!\" Until Then—Ciao! Luchino Viseonti was an exacting perfectionist. If something had not been set up properly to his liking he simply went on strike. Burt Lancaster remembers arriving with the director to a Sicilian village during the making of The Leopard (1964), when Viseonti noticed that some of the houses had anachronistic television antennas. Although he might have been able to shoot around them, he ordered his art director to remove every one of them. \"When they are down,\" he said, \"we will shoot. You'll find me at my hotel.\"\n\nRed to Reel\n\n27\n\nCandid Camera In making North by Northwest (1959), Alfred Hitchcock needed to film in the lobby of the United Nations building in New York. However, permission was refused on orders of Dag Hammarskjold, who instituted the ban after excessive disruption caused by The Glass Wall (1953). The director was forced finally to build a miniature of the lobby, but not for lack of trying. \"While the guards were looking for our equipment,\" Hitchcock told Franeois Truffaut, \"we shot one scene of Cary Grant coming into the building by using a concealed camera. We'd been told that we couldn't even do any photography, so we concealed the camera in the back of a truck and in that way we got enough footage for the background. Then we got a still photographer to get permission to take some colored stills inside and I walked around with him, as if I was a visitor, whispering, 'Take that shot from there. And now, another one from the roof down.' We used those color photographs to reconstitute the settings in our studios.\" Hitchcock also sought in vain to get permission to shoot on location the famous chase scene over the monumental stone heads of the presidents at Mount Rushmore. He had to rebuild the landmark in the studio, as the Master recalled, \"because to have Cary Grant get a sneezing fit in Lincoln's nose was considered an insult to the shrine of democracy.\" Reality Preparing to film Sweet Bird of Youth (1962), Richard Brooks was consulting the author of the play. \"Make sure you shoot it on the Gulf,\" Tennessee Williams urged, \"because you can't find these locations anywhere else.\" Brooks spent some time scouting locations in New Orleans and along the Gulf states. On his return to California, he decided he could save a great deal of money by shooting in and around San Diego. Brooks did not tell Williams when he first screened the film for him where he found his locations. \"It just shows you,\" said the contented playwright, \"when you have the real thing—how [good] it looks.\" Fury and Sound Like many German refugees in the 1930s, Fritz Lang arrived in Hollywood with a minimal knowledge of English. He gave authenticity to his first American script, Fury (1936), by copying suitable items from newspaper\n\n28\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nclippings. Under the studio system, once a script and its budget had been approved, no further changes were allowed without permission from the front office. Following a preview of Fury, the supervising producer, Joseph Mankiewiez, summoned Fritz: Lang into his office and accused him of having changed the approved screenplay. \"How could I change the script,\" the director protested, \"when I can't even speak English?\" Mankiewiez sent for the script and began reading it. \"Damn you, you're right,\" he admitted, \"but it sounds different on the screen.\"\n\nDon't Try This at Home In making the epic film The Bible (1966), John Huston faced the problem of getting the animals to file into the ark two by two, as required in the Good Script: Finally I found a trainer who said it could be done, and he devised a way at enormous expense. We built a road that led through the ark and ditches on either side of the road. First the animals were led singly just around this circuit to the ark, and then two animals would be led, and finally when they had become used to this, nylon lines were attached to bridles and the men led them within the ditches. Then they would add another pair of animals, and each pair had been worked separately, at first singly and then in pairs, and then we added to the pairs, and finally came the time when the bridles were taken off and the animals walked altogether two by two around into the ark.\n\nDear Deer Director Victor Fleming went on location to Florida to shoot some of the nature scenes in The Yearling (1946). When no footage was coming back, the studio sent a telegram telling him to speed things up. Fleming wired back: JUST SAT DOWN AND READ SCRIPT AND YOUR TELEGRAM TO DEER • FEEL SURE HE WILL DO BETTER HEREAFTER. Getting His Goat Peter Lorre had to milk a goat in a scene, but he couldn't get the hang of it. \"Better get it right the next time,\" urged the animal's owner from the sidelines, \"there's only one more take left in the goat.\"\n\nCHAPTER\n\n3\n\nYou Ought To Be in Pictures\n\nHobson's Choice Allan Dwan, one of the pioneer film directors, found his career by accident. He was working as an engineer for a Chicago-based movie company, which sent him out to California to investigate a production in trouble. Dwan arrived in San Diego and found a bunch of actors waiting around for the director, who had disappeared on a binge. He telegraphed the home office, and a wire came back instructing him to take over the project. Dwan had never faced actors before, but he knew that somehow he must get them on his side. Calling together the cast he told them: \"Either I am a director—or you are out of your jobs.\" Beginners When Hal Roach, another Hollywood veteran, got his first directing assignment, he was afraid that all the technical staff would laugh at his inexperience. He was especially scared of Fred Jackman, his cameraman, who looked as though he had grown up in the business. On the first morning Hal Roach copied every gesture of Fred Jackman's, and was careful only 29\n\n300\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nto speak in the most technical jargon. They shot a scene that day in which Harold Lloyd rolled clown a steep, rocky incline, but when they saw the rushes the next morning, it appeared as if he was going along level ground. The camera angle was such that it straightened out the incline, which meant that the whole sequence would have to be shot again, causing another series of bruises for Harold Lloyd. Tormented by his conscience, Hal Roach took his cinematographer aside: \"Fred,\" he said meekly, \"I have a confession to make. I've never directed a picture before.\" Jackman looked him manfully in the eye. After pausing for a second or two, he said: \"Hal, I've a confession to make, too. I never worked on a camera before yesterday.\"\n\nOgre Josef von Sternberg, who almost gave definition to the tyrannical director, worked hard to gain his reputation as an ogre. The British actor Clive Brooks recalled sharing a room on a Welsh location, where the Austrian was working as an assistant director. One morning Brooks saw young Sternberg staring a long time at his visage in the mirror. \"Which is more horrible,\" he finally asked. \"With or without a moustache?\" \"What do you want to look horrible for?\" asked the actor. \"The only way to succeed,\" said the director, \"is to make people hate you. That way they remember you.\" Later in life, on the university circuit, Josef von Sternberg was frequently asked by aspiring students what qualifications were needed to become a film director. He would tell them that a director must speak several languages; he must know the history of theatre and drama from the beginning of time. He must have some psychiatric training and be expert at psychoanalysis. Once a student asked: \"Mr. von Sternberg, did you know all that?\" \"No,\" he replied, poker-faced. \"But then I never asked anyone how to become a director.\" Why I Became a Director Director George Roy Hill is a fine amateur musician, who studied composition at Yale. David Shire had done for him the score for The World\n\nYou Ought To Be in Pictures\n\n31\n\nAccording to Garp (1982), and they were chatting during a scoring session while the orchestra took a break. \"I wish I could be doing your job,\" the reticent director told the composer with frank envy. Shire, who is also a Yalie, asked why Hill had not pursued music further. \"I was in my senior year,\" George Roy Hill explained, \"studying with Paul Hindemith. For my senior thesis I had composed a sonata for piano and violin. Several weeks after I had turned it in, I was summoned by Professor Hindemith. He was sitting in his office. \" 'Mr. Hill,' he said, 'I've looked at your sonata, and I also saw the excellent production of Gilbert & Sullivan you did recently at your residential college. I am prepared to graduate you, if you give me your solemn pledge that you will not write any more music.' \"It was at that moment,\" George Roy Hill concluded, \"that I knew I was going to be a director.\" In college John Badham wanted to be an actor but could never get cast. He noticed that there was a guy down in front of the stage always surrounded by girls. \"Gee,\" asked young Badham, \"how do you get to meet all these girls?\" \"Well,\" said the man, \"you have to be the director.\"\n\nEasy As One, Two, Three Roger Corman is famous not only for his low-budget movies but also for giving a good many talented people their early break in pictures. Peter Bogdanovich was a cineaste writing about film for Esquire and the Museum of Modern Art when he got a call from Corman asking whether he would like to try his hand at directing a picture. The producer told Bogdanovich that he could do absolutely anything he wanted within the following parameters: 1. Boris Karloff owed Corman two days' shooting, during which Bogdanovich should squeeze about twenty minutes of screen time out of Karloff, who was eighty years old and dying of emphysema. 2. To supplement it, there was another twenty minutes that Corman would let Bogdanovich have from an earlier movie he had made with Karloff called The Terror (1963). 3. \"Then you get together a bunch of actors,\" Corman told the novice director, \"and shoot for about ten days another forty minutes and you've got an eighty-minute Karloff picture I can release.\"\n\n32\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nAnd that is how Peter Bogdanovich got to make Targets (1968), \"his\" first feature film, for $130,000. Shoot First, Talk Later Steve Kovaes began in movies working for Roger Corman. \"I was production assistant at first, and soon became head of production,\" he recalls, \"and the only difference was that with the second job I had access to a secretary.\" One of his first assignments was to supervise Deathsport (1977), which was being shot near Agoura, some forty miles northwest of Los Angeles. One day, the first-time director began to be abusive towards the leading lady, Claudia Jennings, until David Carradine, the star, came to her aid by roughing up the man. It was a hot and dusty day, and all work came to an abrupt end. Kovaes called Roger Corman and told him what was not happening. . \"Why don't you just go ahead,\" demanded Corman, \"and keep shooting.\" \"The situation is very tense, Roger,\" Kovaes explained to the boss, \"I think you'd better come out.\" In about forty-five minutes Corman arrived in his Mercedes'. He drove up right to the camera, got out, and said to the production manager and the cameraman: \"Let's set up the next shot.\" Only after the scene was in the can did Corman take care of the human problem, which was all smoothed out by the evening. Close Encounter For those fascinated by the early development of great achievers, Leah Adler, the mother of Steven Spielberg, provides a stream of conscious information. Fred Bernstein interviewed her for his book The Jewish Mothers Hall of Fame at her kosher restaurant \"The Milky Way\" in Los Angeles. Practically every day, someone at the restaurant—often someone who mistakenly addresses her as \"Mrs. Spielberg\"—asks her if she always knew that Steven was a genius. Leah has an answer ready: \"When he was growing up, I didn't know he was a genius. Frankly, I didn't know what the hell he was. I'm really ashamed, but I didn't recognize the symptoms of talent. I\n\nYou Ought To Be in Pictures\n\n33\n\ndid him an injustice. I had no idea back then that my son would be Steven Spielberg. \"For one thing—and he'll probably take away my charge accounts for saying this—Steven was never a good student. Once, his teacher told me he was 'special'—and I wondered how she meant it. \"You see, Steven wasn't exactly cuddly. What he was was scary. When Steven woke up from a nap, I shook.\" Long before Gremlins, Steven was a master at creating terror. He practiced on his three kid sisters. Says Leah, \"He used to stand outside their windows at night, howling, 'I am the moon. I am the moon.' They're still scared of the moon. And he cut off the head of one of Nancy's dolls and served it to her on a bed of lettuce. \"The first thing I'd do when we moved to a new house was look for a baby-sitter,\" Leah says. \"But it didn't work, because they wouldn't let us go out for more than a few hours without taking Steven. \"Once,\" Leah remembers, \"I took Steven to the Grand Canyon. He said, \"This is nice/ and then he threw up. With Steven, you held on for dear life. \"I mean, I didn't know how to raise children,\" Leah continues. \"Maybe we were more normal than I remember—but I sincerely doubt it. Steven's room was such a mess, you could grow mushrooms on the floor. Once his lizard got out of its cage, and we found it—livingthree years later. He had a parakeet he refused to keep in a cage altogether. It was disgusting. Once a week, I would stick my head in, grab his dirty laundry, and slam the door. \"If I had known better,\" she says, \"I would have taken him to a psychiatrist, and there never would have been an E.T.\" . . . When he was fourteen, Steven made his first full-length movie, a sci-fi flick called Firelight, and he got a theatre in Phoenix to show it. It was Leah who put up the letters on the marquee. \"I thought, 'This is a nice hobby.'\" Incredibly, the film made money, and there was no stopping Steven. Once, Leah says, \"he wanted to shoot a scene in a hospital, and they closed down an entire wing. Another time, he needed to shoot at an airport, and they gave him a whole runway. Nobody ever said no to Steven. He always gets what he wants, anyway, so the name of the game is to save your strength and say yes early.\" At least once, she should have said no—early. Steven wanted to do a scene (similar to one in Poltergeist twenty years later) in which something horrible came oozing out of Leah's kitchen cabinets. She not only agreed but went to the supermarket and bought thirty cans of\n\n34\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\ncherries, which she cooked in a pressure cooker until they exploded all over the room. \"For years after that,\" she jokes, \"my routine every morning was to go downstairs, put the coffee on, and wipe cherries off the cabinets.\" The Kid\n\nGeorge Lucas's first foray into the world of professional movie-making was a documentary he called 6-18-67 because of the date he finished shooting it. Columbia Pictures had given scholarships to four apprentice filmmakers—two graduates each from the leading film-schools of the University of Southern California and the University of California at Los Angeles—with the idea that they would shoot short films about Carl Foreman's starstudded Western, McKenna's Cold (1968), which was being shot around the spectacular Canyon cle Chelly in northern Arizona. Lucas avoided the trap of making a movie about the making of another movie; instead he filmed the landscape, the desert wildlife, with distant shots of the antlike activities of the Hollywood film crews. Foreman had opposed Lucas's idea, but the 22-year-old filmmaker refused to yield, saying that he was not interested in doing a promotional film under the guise of a training scholarship. The veteran producer, who could be quite a bully, backed down and later openly admired the film. He also remembered Lucas's giving him a piece of advice. After one lunch-break, when the whole cast and crew were waiting around for the sun to come out, Lucas observed to Foreman that they could be rehearsing the scene while waiting, rather than wasting the light later. Foreman fought off his instinct to tell the young man to go wipe his nose, and went to ask the British director J. Lee-Thompson, another veteran, whether he had rehearsed yet. He had not, but thought that it was a good suggestion. \"I was both embarrassed and impressed,\" Carl Foreman later told writer Dale Pollock. \"That director hadn't done something that the kid knew to do.\" Discoveries Every profession has its legend of how somebody was discovered or suddenly managed to get a lucky break. The most cherished Hollywood story concerns the i6-year-okl Julia Turner, who was playing hooky from school and sat in a sweater sipping a strawberry malt. This historic event took place in 1936, though not, as has been retailed to generations of tovirists, at the soda fountain of the late lamented Schwaab's drugstore, but a couple\n\nYou Ought To Be in Pictures\n\n35\n\nof miles to the east in Hollywood, at the Top Hat Malt on Sunset and Highland Avenue. There William Wilkerson, publisher of the Hollywood Reporter, who had been watching the well-developed teenager for some time, finally went up to her and popped the question: \"How would you like to be in pictures?\" Within a very short time, Wilkerson took the girl to Zeppo Marx, who ran a talent agency, and she was asked to think of a new name. She came up with Lana herself. Her first appearance in a sweater and a walk-on part in Mervyn Le Roy's film, They Won't Forget (1937), made her an instant star. Yet the first time \"The Sweater Girl\" saw herself on screen she was embarrassed by the garment she had made famous. \"I looked so cheap,\" she complained. One block down from the Chinese Theatre is C. C. Brown, Hollywood's most elegant ice cream parlor, founded in 1929. This is the birthplace of the hot-fudge sundae and also the spot where agent William Demarest discovered Ellen Drew, selling chocolates. He took her to Paramount for a screen test, and when she became a star, Miss Drew returned to Brown's to help christen the Cinderella sundae in her honor. Success Has Many Fathers Orson Welles took credit for discovering Judy Holliday. In fact, she worked as a telephone operator at the Mercury Theatre, and Welles never suspected she had any talent. Rudolf Seiber was assistant to the young Alexander Korda in Berlin and asked the director if his wife might get the tiniest bit part in their current movie. Korda told him that the lady had not the slightest potential as a film actress. Frau Seiber became better known as Marlene Dietrich. Great Rejections The movie world thrills almost as much to stories of rejection as to discoveries, provided that the rejected unknown consequently reached stardom. Looking at a screen test of Fred Astaire, some genius at RKO wrote a succinct report: \"Can't act. Slightly bald. Can dance a little.\" Astaire, who disliked his own face and did not believe that the camera could keep his fancy footwork in focus, must have looked elsewhere to rebuild his confidence in the short period before he became, with Ginger Rogers, Hollywood's biggest box-office attraction.\n\n36\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nBette Davis did a test after Arthur Hornblow Jr. saw her in Broken Dishes (1929) on Broadway. Samuel Goldwyn, who was looking for a leading lady in Raffles, watched the film and was reported to have yelled: \"Whom did this to me?\" Davis was not surprised because, when she saw the test herself, \"I ran from the projection room screaming.\" Clark Gable was still trying for a career on the stage, even after he had moved to Los Angeles. Discouraged with occasional work as a bit player or extra, Gable told the talent scout who first offered him a screen test: \"Why waste my time and your money? I've tried movie work often enough to know I have nothing Hollywood wants.\" With the revolution brought about by talkies, stage actors were suddenly in demand. Gable liked to tell the story how Lionel Barrymore, fcr whom he had worked in the theatre, suggested that he make a test for a film Barrymore was directing at MGM. As soon as Gable reported on the lot, hairdressers curled his hair, he was stripped and given a G-string, a prop man stuck a knife into it and put a hibiscus behind his ear. Barrymore told him to creep through some bushes, as if looking for a girl. There were no lines to speak. When Irving Thalberg viewed the test he called the director and said: \"You can't put this man in a picture. Look at him!\" Lionel Barrymore tried to stick up for his protege: \"He's young, but he'll be all right.\" \"Not for my money, he won't. Look at his big, batlike ears.\" A little later Clark Gable was tested at Warner by Mervyn LeRoy, and overheard Jack Warner yell at him: \"Why do you throw away five hundred dollars of our money on a test for that big ape? Didn't you see those big cars when you talked to him? And those big feet and hands, not to mention that ugly face of his?\" Within a year the Hollywood Reporter announced to its readers that a new star was born. \"Never have we seen audiences work themselves into such enthusiasm, as when Gable walks on the screen.\" An Awkward Peasant Girl On a visit to Berlin, Louis B. Mayer saw Gosta Berling (1924), a four-hour film made by the Swedish director Maurite Stiller, and was impressed by its star, Greta Gustaffson. He invited her on the spot to come and work at MGM, but only on condition that she take off some weight.\n\nYou Ought To Be in Pictures\n\n37\n\n\"We don't like fat girls in my country,\" he informed her through an interpreter. When Greta arrived in New York in the summer of 1925, accompanied by her lover and director Stiller (he insisted that he be included in her contract), Mayer suggested to the front office that they meet the newest star in the MGM firmament. Major Edward Bowes was the only one who did and left wondering about Mayer's judgment: \"What an awkward peasant girl she is!\" he said of the woman, who within a few short years would conquer the world. Meanwhile in Hollywood, Howard Dietz, head of the publicity department, called a meeting to decide what new name to give her. \"Garbo sounds too much like garbage,\" he said. After arriving on the West Coast, Greta Garbo spent hours wandering around the MGM lot waiting for her first assignment. During one of these walks, noticing a fig tree outside the costume department, she picked a fig on an impulse and ate it. \"Those who saw her do it, gaped,\" noted Samuel Marx wryly; \"no one had ever done that before. There was a widespread belief that fruit which grew inside a movie studio must be inedible.\" What's in a Name? Lucille Le Sucur was discovered by MGM executive Harry Rapf, who decided that her surname sounded too close to \"sewer,\" so a nationwide contest was launched to find a better name. A woman in Albany, New York, won $500 for coming up with Joan Crawford. Doris Day was born von Kappelhoff. Orchestra leader Barney Rapp changed her name, over her protest, after the song \"Day after Day.\" Anne Bancroft first appeared under her own name Anna Italiano, and then Anna Marno. She chose her current name from a list drawn up by Darryl Zanuck. \"Bancroft was the only name,\" she later said, \"that didn't make me sound like a bubble dancer.\" Actor Dane Clark was originally Bernard Zanville from Brooklyn, and received his less ethnic name when he signed on as a contract player with Warner. He was bitterly unhappy with his new name, and one day a fel-\n\n38\n\nMovie Anecdotes\n\nlow thespian played a cruel gag on him by saying that he had just been informed his name was being changed to Bernard Zanville. \"They can't do that to me!\" screamed a.k.a. Clark, \"that's my name!\" MGM publicist Howard Dietz once gave the following genealogical account of a typical Hollywood transformation: \"She was born Tula Ellice Finklea. Her baby brother nicknamed her Sid. She joined the Ballet Russe and became Felicia Sidarova. This was subsequently changed to Maria Estamano. She married and became Mrs. Nico Charisse. At the start of her screen career she took the name Lily Norwood. MGM changed that to Sid Charisse and she was finally billed Cyd Charisse.\" Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, in its golden age under Louis B. Mayer, once hired an actor named George Mayer. As usual, he was instructed to change his name. \"Mayer is not a good name for success in the movies,\" said one of the executives. Maurice Joseph Micklcwhite began acting on the English stage as Michael Scott. Soon he had to join Equity and the union already had a member with that name. After a discussion of the problem with his agent, the actor caught sight of the word \"Caine\" on the marquee of the big cinema on Leicester Square. The rest of the title was obscured. \"It's a good job the trees were in the right place,\" Michael Caine recalled, \"otherwise I would have been called Michael Mutiny.\" Just Say No Even before Bette Davis arrived in California, the publicity men of Universal's office in New York told the stage star that she had a great name for a secretary, but it completely lacked glamour for the movies. Claiming that they had given the matter a great deal of thought, they told her that Bettina Dawes was the perfect name for her. \"Bettina Dawes!\" Miss Davis exploded. \"I refuse to be called 'Between the Drawers' all my life!\" Baptism With the inevitable triumph of sound, Hollywood turned to Broadway to find actors who could talk and act at the same time. William Fox signed\n\nYou Ought To Be in Pictures\n\n3g\n\nMuni Wiesenfreund, the Austrian-born actor who had risen to stardom by playing old men in the Yiddish theatre of New York. As soon as the actor arrived in Hollywood, a Fox producer suggested that he make his first name his last. \"I like Muni for a last name,\" he opined. \"It's short and catchy.\" \"So is Rin Tin Tin,\" the newly baptized actor retorted. The studio immediately released the news that \"Mr. William Fox has personally discovered the celebrated Russian actor, Paul Muni.\" On hearing this, the star told his wife Bella: \"I not only have a new name, I have a new nationality!\" \"Russian,\" she explained to her husband, \"is a polite word for Yiddish.\" Sauerkraut Joseph Schildkraut, another Austrian-born actor, was proud of having come from a line of great players. He was more than a little peeved at a Hollywood party when a woman compounded her failure to recognize him by suggesting: \"You know, you really should be an actor.\" \"Madam,\" he replied pompously, \"my name happens to be Schildkraut!\" \"Oh, that's too bad,\" said the young lady brightly: \"but you can change it and nobody will know the difference.\" What Was It Before? Tony Curtis was brought to Hollywood by agent Joyce Selznick. His early career grew from the infertile soil of desert epics, in one of which, while riding on top of a dune with Piper Laurie, he uttered the immortal line: \"Yonda lies the castle from my fodda!\" In fact, Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz in the Bronx; and his father had come over from Hungary—lately the actor has established a fund in his father's memory to help restore the main synagogue in Budapest. As his career grew at Universal, Tony Curtis brought out his family to Hollywood. He was showing the studio to his father, when they came upon Oscar Brodney, a writer-producer. After being introduced, Brodney could not resist asking: \"Tell me, Mr. Schwartz, why didn't you like the name Curtis?\" If At First You Don't Succeed Kirk Douglas knew that it would be hard to make his way in American society with the name he was born: Issur Danielovitch. So he changed his name to Izzy Demsky.\n\n4o\n\nMovie Anecdotes Patriarch\n\nKirk Douglas is as fiercely proud of his four sons—Michael, Joel, Peter, and Eric—as of any of his creations on celluloid over a career of fifty years. An old-fashioned paterfamilias, Douglas stayed close to his children over decades by writing to them constantly from every film location all over the world, proffering fatherly advice on every subject, whether they wanted it or not. All of them ignored his basic advice—to stay out of the movie business. \"They never had my advantages,\" the veteran actor said in an interview; \"I started out poor.\" The Answer to Every Girl's Prayer Gabriel Pascal, the maverick producer of several Bernard Shaw films, was looking for a fresh face to play a young Salvation Army girl in Major Barbara (1940). He was telling his friend Richard Norton over lunch at the Savoy that he wanted a pure, innocent girl with a spiritual face. \"That's going to be difficult,\" Norton opined. Pascal scanned the dining room and his eyes rested on a girl having lunch at a nearby table with an older woman. He got up and went up to them, placing his hands on the girl's shoulder in a familiar manner. \"Are you a virgin?\" the producer asked without preliminaries. The girl blushed, but before she could answer, Pascal explained who he was and about his mission. \"I have a feeling you can act,\" he said. \"Please meet me in the lobby after lunch and recite something for me.\" The producer was not far wrong. The young woman was a dancer at Sadler's Wells and did have ambitions of acting. She and her friend left their lunch and rushed for the ladies' room, where they rehearsed the only monologue the girl knew from a Spanish play called Cradle Song. When she began reciting it for Pascal, he stopped her almost immediately. \"Do you know the Lord's Prayer?\" he asked. She nodded and her recital of it brought tears to the producer's eyes. \"You are the girl,\" he said simply, thus launching the career of Deborah Kerr. The Scary Part Not long after Peter Lorre came to Hollywood, he had been promised a part, but the producer had changed his mind. Lorre went to see him in the\n\nYou Ought To Be in Pictures\n\n4i\n\nhope of reconsidering this decision. The Hungarian-born actor, who became famous through German films, was tongue-tied in English, so he just stood and glared at the producer with his bulging eyes. After about a minute of this, the man became truly frightened: \"Stop staring at me like this,\" he yelled at Lorre, \"you can have your part.\" Blondbeard S. Z. Sakall, rotund comedy star who came to Hollywood just before the Second World War, was known in Hungary as Szoke Szakall, or Blondbeard, a play on Bluebeard. He once explained his increased girth: \"Now I am a star but when I came over here I was just a starlet.\" Playtime Lucille Ball started in pictures as one of the Goldwyn Girls. She needed to stand out from a crowd of other beautiful chorines, so she devised a strategy of bringing herself to her boss's attention. She heard one day that Sam Goldwyn was meeting with his contract writers, so she drove the car up to the studio executive building and honked repeatedly. Finally, Goldwyn himself appeared on a second floor balcony and glared down at the prettyredhead, who smiled back at him as she asked disingenuously: \"Can the writers come out and play with me now?\" Better Late Than Never George Cukor was speaking on a panel, which included Mike P'rankovich, who was then production chief at Columbia Pictures. Cukor recalled how thirty years before Frankovich had wanted to break into pictures as an actor and Cukor had given him one line, which he kept fluffing. \"It was something really simple,\" said Cukor, \"like—']ack, your breakfast is ready.' \" \"That wasn't the line,\" Frankovich rose to his feet. \"It went, 'Your breakfast is ready, Jack.' \" Cukor glared at the executive for a moment and said; \"Now you remember the line.\"\n\nCHAPTER\n\n4\n\nCast to Type\n\nThere Are More Things in Heaven and Earth Along with every other female star in the world, Katharine Hepburn coveted the role of Scarlett O'Hara.
