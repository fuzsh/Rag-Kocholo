He also states this film employed \"a series of crude wipes\", although it's unclear if he's getting that from contemporary reviews or actually having seen this alleged copy. Someone needs to go to France, double check if this is actually in their archives and if so, persuade them to release it. Due to the lack of information, I'm personally dubious."
