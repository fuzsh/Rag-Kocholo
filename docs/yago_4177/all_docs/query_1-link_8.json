I remember the assistant, a young guy. He said to me, 'Look, why don't you go away? Times have changed. You're an old man. The parade's gone .'\" by The silent era is regarded as prehistoric, even by those who work in motion pictures. Crude, fumbling, naive, the films exist only to be chuckled at quaint reminders of a simple-minded past, like Vic.\n\nit all\n\n.\n\n—\n\ntorian samplers.\n\nThis book attempts to correct these distortions, for the silent era was the richest in the cinema's history. I have tried to recapture the spirit of the era through the words of those who created it. Linking chapters provide a context for the interviews, in the way that estab-\n\nBut the use of direct material has led cannot claim that this book is definitive. I regret omitting a chapter on Erich von Stroheim, for example, but I never met him and could throw no more light on his work than the many other writers whose books and articles have already been published. I regret still more the exclusion of other personalities whom I did meet, and who gave me so much fascinating material. The silent era is far too rich and complex a period to be covered in one book; I hope evenlishing shots precede closeups.\n\nto gaps,\n\nand\n\nI\n\ntually to publish all these interviews.\n\nhave tried to see the films I write about, rather than depending on secondhand reports. Certainly, many have disappeared, but I had access to private collections, company vaults, and national archives, and can claim to have seen a representative cross section of the films of the time. I have also built up my own collection of silent features. William K. Everson, the film historian who has done more than anyone to rescue and to document the silent era, also did more than anyone to help me, by making available both his knowledge and I\n\nhis collection.\n\nThroughout the book\n\nhave quoted frequently from Photoplay magazine. Fan magazines are not noted for their accuracy or wit, but Photoplay had nothing in common with its present-day counterparts. It was a forthright, hard-hitting, well-balanced, and highly entertaining publication, and it was a gold mine of information about the making of pictures. Photoplay's success was engineered by James Quirk, former editor of Popular Mechanics. He gave it a sort of clinical accuracy which none of the other magazines shared. Quirk knew the film business and seldom fell for press-agent stories. Occasionally, he would brighten an issue by publishing the more outrageous publicity I Introduction\n\nI\n\nhe printed a picture of Dorothy Mackaill, having her lips tattooed, and captioned it \"pure bunk.\" Photoplay set the standard for film journalism, publishing work by Robert E. Sherwood, H. L. Mencken, George Jean Nathan, and Donald Ogden Stewart As a film technician in the modern industry, I have a deep admiration for my counterparts of forty years ago. Carried away by the novelty of the new medium by the lack of conventions and rules, by their newly acquired wealth and by the glamour, excitement, and risk of motion-picture production, the film makers of silent-era Hollywood created something valuable enough to be called art. The beginnings of this newest art are so recent that many of those who developed it are still alive. Commercial interests, however, have destroyed their work. When the money-making life of a film is over, prints are generally incinerated. The average existence of a motion picture is five years.

The golden era was the period from 191 6 to 1928. It is a neglected period, forgotten often by the very men who enriched it. They have seen their films reissued on television; bad prints shown at the wrong speed have distorted their memory. Perhaps the ballyhoo meant noth-\n\nPerhaps their much-praised pictures were as jerky and as primithey appear today. They were not. Even at their worst, American silent pictures were technically competent. At their best, the photography glistened and gleamed, lights and gauzes fused with magical effect until the art of lighting reached its zenith. It was not merely the stories or the stars that gave magic to the silent screen. It was the patience, hard work, the man who, in less tenacity, and skill of the silent-film technician craft and perfected developed a an art. had than ten years, ing.\n\ntive as\n\n—\n\n2\n\nTHE PRlJ^ITIVE YEARS\n\nbeloved of film historians, in which audiences scream, faint or stampede at the first glimpse of Lumiere's train may arouse suspicions of fantasy. For the public was not completely unprepared for the motion picture. Attempts to represent movement are as old as cave paintings. Shadowplays, images thrown in silhouette upon a white screen, preceded the theater itself. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, various optical toys created an astonishingly con-\n\nThe\n\nstory, so\n\nvincing illusion of movement, depicting birds flying, figures leaping, and horses galloping. The magic-lantern show was generally a static display, but some elaborate slides were fitted with the mechanism of motion.\n\nWhen\n\na small handle was turned, wheels revolved, trees\n\nwaved, and chimneys smoked. But these movements were lateral. They usually occurred on one plane. The Zoetrope bird flapped energetically, and appeared to be traveling\n\nfrom\n\nupward.\n\nWhen\n\nmade\n\nright to\n\nleft.\n\nThe smoke\n\nLumiere's train arrived\n\nat\n\nthe lantern slide drifted\n\nin\n\nLa\n\nCiotat station in 1895,\n\nFor it was photographed as it came toward, and past, the camera.

Lumiere selected this head-on view in order to get the whole train into the picture; a side angle would have been inadequate. By doing this, he unconsciously added the one element missing from other attempts at simulating movement: dynamism.\n\nAlthough every\n\nit\n\nmember\n\nwas peacefully steaming\n\nout of the screen.\n\nmon\n\nto a halt, a sight familiar to\n\nbe hurtling the spectators' com-\n\nof the audience, Lumiere's train appeared to\n\nHad\n\nthey had time to think,\n\nsense would have preserved their dignity.\n\nAs\n\nit\n\nwas, they scarcely\n\nto duck. According to original reports, some women screamed, others fainted. And Lumiere's train was not the only film\n\nhad time\n\nto arouse alarm.\n\nIn America, in April 1896, at Koster and Bial's Music Hall, EdiVitascope was presented.

Some of the reports from this time were undoubtedly colored by recalled that\n\njournalistic excitement, but the basic truth remains:\n\nadults, with nor-\n\nmal reactions and intelligence, reacted like children. The fact that this occurred in 1896 makes little difference. As late as 1931, when Georovesti, Rumania, was treated to its first motion-picture show, twelve peasants were hurt in the rush for the exit.

A roller coaster, a train it is not the movement itself that is magical, but how that movement itself\n\ncoaster ride.\n\n—\n\nis\n\nused.\n\nDuring the primitive years, the emphasis was on movement for movement's sake. Film manufacturers exploited only the most basic characteristic of the motion picture. The public's interest flagged as the novelty wore thin. The little one-shot films like Lumiere's Demolition of a Wall and Launching of a Boat continued to be shown for many years at fairgrounds and by traveling showmen, but their theatrical attraction was diminishing by the turn of the century. In America, the big vaudeville houses decided that the living-picture craze was over. They dispensed with their equipment. The cheaper theaters continued to use films\n\n—but\n\nonly as chasers, clearing the houses, like\n\nthe advertising intermissions of today.\n\nVaudeville, however, supplied entertainment mainly for the middle America's working classes, its immigrant population, continued\n\nclasses.\n\nto find living pictures exciting, even if they had to peer into handcranked machines to see them. Owners of Kinetoscopes and Mutoscopes, aware of the money they were making from their penny arcades, quickly realized the money they could make. They acquired projection machines and converted their arcades into picture theaters. Before long, the penny arcades became nickelodeons. Vacant stores were bought up and converted by entrepreneurs, working feverishly\n\n2\n\nThe Primitive Years\n\nagainst the time they feared the craze\n\nThe middle\n\nwould\n\ncease.\n\n\"penny claptrap.\" Motion Picture Magazine in 191 6, vividly recalled his disillusionment at a \"moving photograph\" show in Philadelphia in the late 1890s. Dunne was attracted to a store window, blazing with the light of two arc lamps, in which a young man cranked the handle of \"an odd looking boxlike contrivance upon a tripod.\"\n\nHomer Dunne,\n\nA\n\nclasses regarded such exhibitions as\n\nwriting in\n\nbarker harangued a knot of curious bystanders.\n\nDunne parted with\n\nand went inside. \"At the far end of the store a small sheet, obviously dirty, was hung loosely from a wire. It was biliously yellow, and had a seam down the center. A rope was stretched from one wall to the other, about three feet in front of the sheet. There were no seats; the halfdozen spectators smoked vigorously and mopped their fevered foreheads. Presently there sounded a noisy sputtering and spitting in the window. Upon the sheet appeared the silhouette of the head of the perspiring young man who officiated at the clothes-wringer handle. The shadow moved here and there, as though he were dodging a crowd of angry hornets. If this were a 'moving photograph' I decided I preferred the shadowgraphs of donkeys and rabbits I had learned to throw upon the wall in my youth. \"I was on the point of leaving when the voice of the barker took on a new thrill of urgency. The sputtering and the spitting became louder and sharper. The silhouette of the young man's head disappeared and the sheet suddenly glowed with an exaggerated phosfive cents\n\nphorescence.\n\nA\n\nnoise like the grinding of a coffee-mill\n\nbecame\n\naudible.\n\nand click! Then the sheet broke into a rash of magnified measles. Great blobs of pearl-colored light danced from one side to the other. These were interspersed with flashes of zigzag lightning and punctuated with soft and mellow glows like a summer sunset. As an exhibition of a 'light fantasy' it was an unqualified success. But as yet nothing even remotely resembling a picture, moving or still, had appeared. \"After a few minutes of this luminous orgy, however, a man's face popped out from between two brilliant splotches of light. Soon, another face appeared in the northwest corner of the sheet. Later, a human torso flashed into view; then its arms popped into place, then its legs; its head arrived soon after, and it stood revealed in its entirety a perfect man. Eventually, he was joined by his pal. For nearly a minute they gestured and gesticulated at each other. Finally Number One lost his temper. Without warning he launched a vicious blow at Number Two. \"Whether the blow was a knockout I shall never know. Before it landed, the sheet was plunged into pitchy darkness and the show was over. \"I have often wondered what would have happened if I had preClickety-clack!

How could we, when not one of us knew what it was all about?\"^ In Europe, several forces were transforming the watching of films from an optical assault into a magical experience. One of these was a genuine magician, Georges Melies. Among the first to tell a story with film, Melies invariably provided a full-scale pantomime with trimmings no stage manager could achieve. He and his staff produced trick effects which at the time seemed stupendous, and which even today appear remarkable. Melies, however, was not a true cineaste. He was a dedicated showman; he regarded the camera as an invaluable prop which improved beyond measure many of his stage effects. With films he could reach a far wider audience. Although he employed new effects, such as a form of dissolve, Melies's camera recorded the customary theatrical mid-long-shot from the front seat .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nof the\n\nstalls.\n\nWhatever\n\nmethods, however, he told a story and was the most Deeply impressed by his work was Edwin S. Porter, cameraman and director for the Edison Company in America. Porter once said that it was the Melies pictures that led him to a significant conclusion: since the attraction of the one-shot films was beginning to pall, perhaps the straightforward telling of a story might draw the customers back to the theaters. Porter took some of the Edison Company's one-shot films, fiftyfoot lengths with the common subject of fire. He had them joined his\n\ninfluential of the pioneers.\n\nhundred and twenty-five feet and was American Fireman. The scenes were purely informative, showing the firehouse and crew, and the fire engines racing to a call. To make these stock shots more exciting, Porter photographed extra scenes the fireman thinking of his wife and baby, and the final rescue from the burning building. The Edison Company, in their publicity, glossed over the fact that the stock shots showed different fire departments by claiming: \"We were compelled to enlist the services of the fire departments of four different cities. It will be difficult for the exhibitor to conceive the amount of work involved and the number of rehearsals necessary to turn out a film of this together; the result lasted four\n\ntitled\n\nThe\n\nLife\n\nof an\n\n—\n\nkind.\"2 Porter's epoch-making editing of this film and the more elaborate Great Train Robbery (1903) has been the subject of much analysis and supposition. Actually, like so many other important events in motion pictures, it was casual and intuitive. Yet few other film makers followed this compelling style not even\n\n—\n\n'Motion Picture Magazine, Aug. 1916, p. 81.

This is the most important reference work on the silent era.\n\n'\n\n2\n\nThe Primitive Years\n\nPorter, whose later films were conservative and theatrical. For dramatic subjects of this period were invariably reproductions of stage from plays. The players conducted themselves as though on the stage which most of them had come. The scenery was generally painted, and the camera was rigid. Titles announced the content of the scene.\n\n—\n\nwas left to the imagination. But some of those crouched in the scented darkness of the nickelodeon had never seen a play, and these films were a revelation. Some, poorly paid workers, were illiterate. Others, penniless immigrants, did not speak English. But the titles were read from the screen aloud and translated into a dozen languages. It was Babel, but there were few who did not benefit. The commotion encouraged the stranger; here was one place where he was accepted and where he felt at ease. Gradually the little films taught him customs and ways of life which had previously baffled him; they began to extend his outlook and enlarge his interests. America's immigrant population learned from the movies in a way denied them by the spoken theater. Others, for whom the theater had been the principal diversion, discovered new advantages in the movies. Accustomed to the cheapest seats, they found the camera giving them the view from the best seats in the house. The scenes, though lengthy, were much shorter than those of theatrical productions. The titles that separated them were swifter than a curtain. When two scenes were joined together without a title, the impact on audiences used to the tedious delays of scene shifting was understandably startling. But for all these advantages, the middle-class patrons of vaudeville, and of the legitimate stage, had yet to be won over to the movies. The main deterrent was the movie houses themselves. Owners protested that their houses were clean and free from vermin; they had sprayed the disinfectant themselves. Somehow, the middle classes remained unconvinced. Certain exhibitors opened luxurious new theaters and were gratified by the response. But the prosperous classes demanded more than colored lights and plush. Motion pictures remained Little\n\ncommon\n\nlanguage of the poor. A vast number of short films were churned out during this period. Most of them were sold outright, and so many have survived unlike the silent films of later years, which were returned to the distributor for destruction. When seen today these early films are interesting historically, academically, and sociologically but seldom cinematically. Apart from the occasional breakthrough, such as the experiments of Melies and Porter, films of this very early period were not films at all. Shots were joined together but not edited. Scenes were illuminated but not lit. Yet the foundations for a new industry were being laid. And by laying the foundations for industry, these pioneers were providing the groundwork of an art. the\n\n—\n\n—\n\n11\n\n^^\n\n*•«/•\n\n1\n\n,.#Sn\n\n3\n\n'y\n\n\"•%?!%\" \"%i^ 1m.\n\nEARLY DAYS AT VITAGRAPH\n\nAlthough the American film\n\nindustry\n\nis\n\nassociated\n\nwith\n\nexclusively\n\nHollywood, it was born in the East.

In the last years of its existence, before it was taken over by Warner Brothers, Vitagraph was a shadow of\n\nformer glory. Referred to as the Morgue of the Movies, it still succeeded in producing pictures of high quality: Black Beauty; Pampered Youth, the silent version of The Magnificent Ambersons; Captain Blood; The Beloved Brute, Victor McLaglen's first American its\n\nfilm.\n\nJames Morrison knew Vitagraph\n\nat all its stages, and while about the crudity of the very early productions, great admiration for what was achieved later.

He had no sentimentality about the past, but displayed a warm nostalgia for the people he worked with. As he talked, it became clear that this journey to the past was a significant experience for him. \"Why,\" he exclaimed at one point, \"you're bringing up names I haven't thought of for forty\n\nThe.\n\nown\n\nsure\n\nstunts in those early days,\"\n\nyears!\"\n\nJAMES MORRISON: My of Dramatic Arts,\n\nwhere\n\nI\n\ncareer began at the American specialized in\n\nmendous teacher there called Madame that pantomime had to be the basis of\n\npantomime.\n\nWe\n\nAcademy had a\n\ntre-\n\nwas pantomime your\n\nAlberti; her great theory all\n\nacting.

I told them that perhaps I might fit in, since I had been working on pantomime. They thought that was very nice, but they felt I should have more experience. Quite frankly, I didn't know what to do. I knew you had to have a job in order to get a job, so I went to Chicago my home's in the Vitagraph\n\nat\n\nFlatbush to see\n\nif\n\nI\n\n—\n\n5 Early Days\n\nat Vitagraph\n\nJames Morrison and Jean Paige (Mrs. Albert E. Smith) Beauty (1921) directed by David Smith.\n\nin Vitagraph's\n\nBlack\n\n,\n\n—\n\nwhich was a summer theater. I didn't play but I saw several stock-company performances. Then I returned to town, and thought I'd try Vitagraph again. I told them I'd been to Ravinia Park. \"That's fine,\" they said. \"Now you've got some professional experience, let's see what you can do.\" So I was in. At this time Carlyle Blackwell, a leading 191 1 juvenile man, was leaving, and they thought they'd try me out in the things that he'd been doing. We weren't at all alike but that's how Illinois\n\nto Ravinia Park,\n\nin anything,\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nI\n\nstarted.\n\n—\n\nA\n\nTale of Two Cities and this was one of Norma Talmadge's first appearances, too. I played the peasant brother, and Lillian Walker played my sister. In one scene I had to leap a balustrade and attack the Marquis, while a big ball was going on. I went back as far as I could to get momentum about twentyfive feet against the back wall then I ran forward, and as I leaped the balcony I let out a loud yell. Afterward, Julia Swayne Gordon told me: \"When I heard that cry, it really struck truth to me. I was in the toilet at the time, but I had to come out to see who on earth had done it.\" So my training had not been in vain!\n\nThe\n\nfirst\n\nthing\n\ndid was\n\nI\n\n—\n\n.\n\n.\n\n—\n\n.\n\n15\n\nWithin another week, Mabel Normand arrived, so all of us stuck together because we didn't know a thing. We were raw beginners. I knew a bit more than Norma or Mabel, because I'd done some acting.\n\nWe\n\nhad no\n\ngraph\n\nuntil\n\ncontracts. I never\n\nhad a written contract with the Vita-\n\nWe\n\nthem.\n\nafter I'd left\n\nall\n\nstarted at about twenty-five\n\nYou used to get a raise in an odd sort of a way. It came through either the English or the French office, who would write the American office and say: \"So-and-so was very good in such-and-such a picture.\" That was worth a five-dollar raise. But it created some confusion. We always got our money in cash, never by check, so when we got a raise we thought we'd been miscounted. You'd look at your money and you'd think: \"Oh, my. That's dollars a week.\n\nusually\n\nmust have counted twice.\" So if we got a raise we'd always have to get one of the others to count our salary. And even some of the older people there would encounter the same trouble. I remember Julia Swayne Gordon saying one time, \"Jim, I hate to do this, but would you mind counting my money?\" She had a fifteen-dollar raise for something special she'd done. They wrong.\n\nI\n\n—\n\nnever said anything about it they just gave it to her. The Vitagraph Corporation really was a great big happy family. Two young men from England, Albert E. Smith and J. Stuart Blackton, had started it with a man called Pop Rock. Pop had the money.\n\nThat was what Pop had Blackton and Smith had their separate companies. I was taken in by Blackton's side, and for a while Smith's side didn't have anything to do with me. There was quite a difference between the two camps. In the Smith group I think it was, just for a short time, they tried out the most pitiful method of direction. The director would call \"Number five!\" and the leading woman would pull expression number five. That was all there was to it one two three four five. Luckily .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n—\n\nit\n\ndidn't last very long.\n\nWe\n\nwere doing a job in those days. There was no feeling about new. It was a job and we did it. Nevertheless, there were experiments. In 191 1, Larry Trimble made a whole story using only hands and feet. Not until the very end did he reveal the two starting anything\n\npeople.\n\nBut had to\n\nsame\n\nshow you how\n\nprimitive it all was, I hours without moving. They had a number of scenes on this set, and they'd placed the camera solidly in one position. They never thought of moving the camera, and they didn't want a jump, so they had to have me in that one spot. I didn't have any lunch This was for A Tale of Two Cities; very soon after that they discovered that they could break the shot, go to a title or another shot, and then come back without the audience noticing any jump.

When I started, they would frame the scene as in a theater, a long shot with everyone shown full length. We were the first ones to bring people up to within nine feet of the camera. The nine-foot line was a line of tape on the floor; if you came any nearer you'd go out of focus. The next innovation in the movies was when Griffith did the close-up. We thought of the nine-foot line, but\n\nWe I\n\nhad\n\ndid to\n\nall\n\nour own\n\nbe shot\n\noff\n\nit\n\nwe\n\nstunts.\n\n...\n\ndidn't think of the close-up.\n\nThe\n\nthird time\n\nin full gallop.\n\nI\n\never rode on a horse\n\nThis was for The Seepore\n\nRebellion, in which Wallace Reid was an extra man.

In those days, when you were told to do something, you tried to do it. I got along pretty well until I was about my own height up. Then my feet started slipping because there was cement on the bricks. My and nails were going too by this time. I struggled to keep climbing the cameraman announced that he was going to change the angle. \"You keep right on with what you're doing!\" I snapped between clenched teeth. Then I grabbed the spouting and it was rusty and it began to give. How I did that last heave on the roof I'll never know, but I got there. And when I saw the film at the Vitagraph Theatre, I heard some people behind me say: \"You know what they do? That's all laid out on the floor, and all they have to do is crawl along it.\" There was another incident which wasn't amusing at the time, but is amusing to look back on. Julia Swayne Gordon was a vamp, and I played her young lover. She had a tiger, in this picture, as a pet, and it had been in captivity for just six months. We got it from Coney Island, and we had to work with it on the same set. No double exposure or anything. The carpenters had built a great fence around us, and everyone was standing around with guns. Not that they would have been much help; the damage would have been done before they could fire and they probably wouldn't have dared to shoot for\n\nhad\n\n.\n\n.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nfear of killing us.\n\nand I felt like a couple of Christians ... I was supposed be afraid of the tiger, that's what worried me. I expect the tiger could smell my natural fear, on top of which I had to act frightened I had to back away from it. In between shots, Julia was stroking the tiger's head, trying to keep him quiet. And she just happened to touch its ear. The tiger raised Julia\n\nto\n\n—\n\n5 Early Days\n\nat\n\nVitagraph\n\nits\n\nhead and took her arm in\n\nfrozen absolutely if\n\nWe\n\nmouth.\n\ndidn't breathe.\n\nWe\n\nwere\n\nstill.\n\nher arm for just a little while, then it looked at her to say \"Don't do that again\" and opened its jaws and let her go.\n\nThe as\n\nits\n\ntiger held\n\n—\n\nThere was a man called Nick Dunaew, who was Russian we called him Nick the Dime-Bender. He was probably of peasant stock, but he knew enough about Russia and its aristocracy to help us a lot as adviser when we did Russian pictures.

He was unknown then, of course it was only afterward that everyone realized he'd been with us.^ John Bunny, Mary Charleson, and I opened the Vitagraph Theatre. It was the first time they'd ever charged a dollar for a movie. We opened in a pantomime written by J. Stuart Blackton called The Honeymooners; we appeared in person, and they followed that with a dramatic film. We'd taken the Criterion Theatre, on the site of called\n\nthe present Criterion.\n\nEveryone said we'd\n\nfail.\n\nWe\n\nwere scared out of our wits\n\n—here\n\nwe were invading Broadway. But we had a packed house at the opening just packed. Diamond Jim Brady was down front, and we\n\n—\n\nWe\n\nplayed close to four months, with the same show, and after that the Vitagraph used it as a first-run theater for their pictures. They only tried one other show a comedy with Flora Finch but it didn't work too well. I was the first one at Vitagraph to have a tuxedo. Maurice Costello had one, and I had one. Then Earle WiUiams came in with a wardrobe. That set us back on our heels At the beginning we would be cast as extras as well as leading players. Somebody would be shooting a banquet scene, and they'd say, got thirteen curtain\n\ncalls.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"Get into your dress suit, and come in here.\" We had quite a battle where we were leading players only, and weren't\n\nto get to the point\n\nused as extra people.\n\nWe\n\nhad\n\nMercury- vapor tubes the light was sort of greenish. We had to wear a blue shirt if we wanted it to photograph white; real white was too glaring. All our dress clothes had to be dyed even our tan would take white.

It gets into your eyes, and they'd swell up and go pink this was called Klieg eyes. It would take two or three days before they'd be normal. It was agony. Out on the Coast, they had constant sunlight, so it was some time before they began using artificial light.\n\n—\n\nartificial light all\n\nthe time at the Vitagraph.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nTrotsky had been one of the principal leaders of the 1905 revolution in Russia, but his name was little known in America.

They were supposed to come crashing down into the water. Well, everybody but the damn things held their breath. Down came the columns floated, because they'd been made of wood. It broke their hearts. I left the Vitagraph in 191 8 when they brought in efficiency experts. When that happened, the art of the company disappeared. Here were three people dividing two million dollars a year and yet they brought in efficiency experts.

Eclair have offered me eighty-five dollars a week.\" He wrote back, at the bottom of my letter: \"If Eclair want you for eighty-five, then Vitagraph certainly does. Come back and go to work.\" And I found myself back with the Vitagraph Corporation.\n\n5 Early Days\n\nat\n\nVitagraph\n\n#\n\n4\n\nTHE EXPERIMENTERS\n\nVerne fantasy, the twentieth century burst forth in a riot all miraculously acof speed. Communications, transport, pictures was on In Everything the move. America, the autowings. quired mobile industry was in ascendancy, closely paced by the moving-picture business. Modifications and alterations were improving the product all the time, but the earlier, cruder models remained for all to see. In these young, vigorous industries, improvements were astonishingly rapid, and one week's output could make obsolete the work of a\n\nLike 3\n\nJules\n\n—\n\ndecade.\n\nThe great changes that took place in the motion picture industry have been attributed to the influence of one man: David Wark Griffith.\n\nhad been an unsuccessful playwright. He wrote under the name of Lawrence Griffith, keeping his real name for more successful ventures in the future. When one of his plays closed prematurely, Griffith\n\ncrushing his hopes, he tried to\n\nsell stories\n\nto the galloping tintypes.\n\nAt the Edison Studios, he encountered Edwin S. Porter. Porter did not buy his stories, but he hired him as an actor. Griffith was chagrined; only failures allowed themselves to appear in moving pictures. However, he needed the money. Then he was offered the opportunity to direct, but was afraid that he would make mistakes and lose his acting job as well. He was persuaded that his job would be safe, and realizing that directing was more remunerative, and more anonymous, he began work on The Adventures of Dollie. Griffith was the son of a Kentucky colonel, and he regarded himself as a member of the aristocracy. This affair of moving pictures, he felt, was degrading. To show his lack of respect he broke all the existing rules of film making. But there was more to it than mere perversity. Griffith also regarded himself as\n\nan\n\nartist\n\nof potential genius.\n\nAs Lloyd Morris has profoundly put it: \"He had no respect for the medium in which he was working, but his temperament compelled him to treat it as if it were an art. The result was that he made it one.\"i\n\nThe Adventures of\n\nDollie,\n\nmade\n\n1908, contained none of the by historians. But, as William K. in\n\nadvances claimed for it \"one can point to the overall construction and the stress on suspense and melodramatic chase as being a kind of blueprint for significant\n\nEverson all\n\nsays,\n\nthe great Griffith material that\n\nMany\n\nwas\n\nto follow.\"^\n\nGround out at an aston-! more than four hundred one- and two-reelers before The Birth of a Nation these little stories ranged from the pedantic to the brilliant.

But since Turner employed the unprecedented number of five hundred extras for the battle scenes,\n\nfamous\n\nride begins.\n\nhis self-indulgence\n\nOn\n\nis\n\nforgivable.\n\nthe whole, however, film makers at this period\n\nfelt that if they simply and directly, without recourse to mechanical tricks, they should do so. Apart from anything else, a traveling shot took a great deal of time to prepare. It was difficult to keep the\n\ncould\n\ntell\n\ntheir stories\n\nin focus, and the delays cost money. Nevertheless, some techwere fascinated by the untapped resources of motion-picture gadgetry. William F. Alder, cameraman on The Second-in-Command (directed by WiUiam Bowman for Fred Balshofer in 1915), enlivened a theatrical and mediocre production with several beautifully executed and surprisingly intricate traveling shots. The movement was absolutely smooth, even when the camera, mounted on two dollies, slid backward and then sideways. The Second-in-Command appeared a full ten years before The Last Laugh, acknowledged by historians as the first film to exploit the moving camera, but two years after Cabiria, the Italian epic that gave its name to the trucking shot (Cabiria movement). \"Suppose I had patented the fade-out,\" said Griffith mournfully in 1926. \"I would be drawing at least a million a year in royalties. The fade-out is absolutely necessary to the smooth telling of a story. Try counting the number of times it is used in a single picture. To eliminate it would make necessary the abrupt beginning and ending of scenes. It would jar and distort the whole observation of a film drama. Yes, I might have patented it. You can patent anything derived from a mechanical device. I just didn't realize its significance then. We were all beginners and I wanted to help the business.\"* The early cinema depended upon interaction; Griffith no more invented the fade-out than he did the close-up. He and Bitzer arrived at some of these effects independently, and often accidentally. Others he consciously or unconsciously took from American and European pictures. But he used these devices with intelligence, sometimes with genius, and film makers were happy to take their improved ideas back again. Artistic and technical progress at this time was thus\n\ncamera nicians\n\n—\n\nastonishingly fast. *\n\nPhotoplay, Dec. 1926,\n\np. 30.\n\n1\n\n4 The Experimenters\n\nI\n\nFrame enlargements from\n\nSheridan's Ride (Universal, 1912); William Clifford\n\nas General Sheridan.\n\nU.S.\n\nArmy\n\ntroops in\n\nflight.\n\n29\n\n— a fact, and a disturbing one in\n\nIt is\n\nmany\n\nways, that every basic\n\ndevice of cinematic storytelling had been established by 19 12.

The Birth of a Nation was cinematic revolution it was responsible for revolutions in every field affected by motion pictures. Riots and demonstrations were living proof of the power of the film. No well-informed person could allow himself to ignore it. The intelligentsia, who had regarded movies much as the jukebox is regarded today, conceded at last that the film had value. With critics and writers embroiled in controversy, the middle classes went to see for themselves. And more important still, the men who controlled the business grew ambitious again. The Birth of a Nation was the first feature to be made in the same fluid way as pictures are made today. It was the most widely seen production of the time and it had the strongest influence. It is still but now it looks like an actor who has been on the being shown stage for half a century. A pale, worn shadow, its original glory is a memory rather than an actuality. The film has been reprinted and cut about frequently; it is also shown at the speed of sound films twenty-four frames a second instead of the sixteen frames more suitable for it. But, as with the actor, it is good to have it with us after all first\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\ntime.\n\nthis\n\nWith the success of The Birth of a Nation, three major producers, Griffith, Thomas Ince and Mack Sennett, were joined together to form the Triangle Corporation. As the strongest rivals to Famous Players, a company formed to exploit theatrical success. Triangle attracted a cluster of Broadway stars. With De Wolf Hopper, William Collier, Beerbohm Tree, and Constance ColHer appearing in pictures, people were at last forced to take the cinema seriously. Griffith merely supervised his apex at Triangle.^ His energies were being devoted to his next production. Intolerance. This amazing picture was a commercial failure.

In 1894, Horace Henderson Wilcox, a Kansas prohibitionist, bought 120 acres near Los Angeles for his country home. His wife named the place Hollywood. By the turn of the century, only a few hundred people had settled there, for lush as it was, Hollywood had once been a barren cactus thicket, and the encroaching desert waited only for drought to reestablish itself. In 1 9 10, lack of water forced the town to seek protection from Los Angeles, and Hollywood became a suburb, separated from the city by eight miles of rough country road. The arrival of motion pictures took the form more of a gradual infiltration than an open invasion. The studio of the American Biograph and Mutoscope Company was established in Los Angeles in 1906, and in 1907 director Francis Boggs arrived in the city with a handful of players from Chicago's Selig Company. Colonel Selig had been attracted by the Chamber of Commerce claim that Los Angeles enjoyed 350 sunny days a year. Boggs and his group had been making a trip through the whole country, filming single-reel dramas on the way. In Los Angeles, one of the actors decided to leave. Boggs replaced him with a stage director named Hobart Bosworth, a former Broadway actor who had lost his voice, and his acting career, after an attack of consumption. Boggs had little trouble persuading Bosworth that since his voice would not be heard in pictures, he could resume his acting career. With Bosworth in the lead, Boggs directed The Power of the Sultan, believed to be the first dramatic film made entirely in California, on a vacant lot next to a Chinese laundry at Olive and Seventh.^ Because he was working in the open air, Bosworth began to recover from the aftereffects of his illness. He was therefore appalled when Colonel Selig wrote from Chicago to recall the company. \"I couldn't go to Chicago,\" he protested to Francis Boggs. \"I'd be dead in a year.\"^ Boggs suggested that he write to Sehg, explaining that California was the best possible place in which to make motion pictures. Bosworth was so eloquent in describing the unvarying sunshine and the ideal conditions that instead\n\ncompany take\n\nof insisting that the\n\nthe\n\nnext train back East, Selig took a train West. The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce echoed Bosworth's letter in their advertising:\n\nEnvironment\n\ncertainly affects creative workers.\n\nYou\n\nrealize surely\n\nthe importance in such essentially sensitive production as the\n\nof Motion Pictures the vital importance of having every Also in the cast were Stella Adams, Tom Santschi, Frank future director, Robert Leonard. * Motion Picture Classic, Aug. 1927, p. 49. ^\n\n5 Early Hollywood\n\nmaking\n\nmember\n\nof\n\nMontgomery, and a\n\n^\n\nan organization awake in the morning and start to work in a flood of happy sunshine. Cold rain and slushy snow do not tend to the proper mental condition for the best creative work.^\n\nIn 1909, Fred Balshofer established the West Coast operations of Kessel and Bauman at 17 12 Allesandro Street, later to be the headquarters of the Mack Sennett Keystone Company. Selig built a small studio at 1845 Allesandro Street. D. W. Griffith came West in the\n\nsame year\n\nThe\n\nfirst\n\nto\n\nmake use\n\nstudio in\n\nof the authentic Western backgrounds.\n\nHollywood\n\nitself,\n\nhowever, was not opened until\n\nOctober 191 1, when the Centaur company, owned by two Englishmen, William* and David Horsley, established a West Coast branch, Nestor. Centaur's chief director, Al Christie, had been making westerns in the East, in Bayonne, New Jersey, and he had begun to tire of the inaccurate local backgrounds. He was anxious to try shooting in California, but David Horsley felt that Florida would offer better climate and terrain. Christie tossed a coin, and California won. On the train out West, Horsley and Christie met a theatrical producer who advised them to see Frank Hoover, owner of a photographic business at Hollywood Boulevard and Gower Street. Hoover persuaded them to set up business in California. The real-estate man who drove the motion-picture men to possible sites felt that Edendale or Santa Monica would prove the most suitable areas. He left Hollywood until last. But on dusty Sunset Boulevard, Christie spotted some property he liked. Nearby was a decrepit building, a roadhouse, which they leased for forty dollars a month. \"Behind this building,\" recalled Nestor cameraman Charles Rosher, \"there was a bam in the garden where we developed all the film. We made one-reel pictures like Indian Raiders, directed by Tom Ricketts, with real Indians brought in from New Mexico by Jack Parsons, who later started the Western Costume Company. \"Although we had a developing room, we had no printing machinery. The picture was cut directly from the negative, and we thought nothing of running original negative through the projector. Scratches and abrasions were mere details. When the negative was cut, the completed reel was sent to New York or Chicago for printing. \"Today, the huge building of the Columbia Broadcasting System stands on the site of the roadhouse.\"^\n\n^WID's Year Book, igig (ed. Wid Gunning), p. I2j. The building was owned by Louis Blondeau, who was, for a time, Hollywood's only barber. He bought up several such sites in the area and became very wealthy *\n\nvery quickly. \"\n\nCharles Rosher to author, London, July 1966.\n\n33\n\nThe Nestor company soon discovered\n\nthat they could\n\nchum\n\nout\n\npicture after picture, with few delays from bad weather. Other companies, enduring the erratic climate of the East, marveled at Nestor's\n\nsteady output and improved photographic quality and came out to Hollywood to learn the secret. Within months, fifteen companies were\n\nshooting in and around Hollywood. The fine weather was certainly a major incentive for many companies to move their entire organizations to the West Coast, but Hollywood offered another advantage. An industrial dispute, known\n\nWar and\n\nfought with weapons and violence enough to justify the term, had forced several producers to flee from New York to Chicago and even to Cuba. These producers had infringed the Edison patents by making equipment built from pirated designs. An immediate cause of the dispute was the Latham Loop, a patented mechanism incorporated in the camera. Hollywood offered an ideal sanctuary for refugees of the Patents War, for should trouble appear, the Mexican border was a mere hundred-mile drive away. \"Horsley was the leader in the fight against the Edison Trust,\" said Rosher, \"and we had to keep our eyes open for spies. We never dared open our cameras outside, in case someone saw the Latham Loop. So to load or unload them, or simply to clean them, we took them inside houses.\" The atmosphere of the wild West was re-created not only on film. The bitter rivalry between these early barnstorming producers led to armed clashes on several occasions. Charles Rosher remembered one as the Patents\n\n—\n\nof these:\n\n\"In May 191 2, the Nestor company was taken over by Universal. Universal was also supposed to have taken over Kay-Bee [Kessel and Bauman], but there was some dispute between the two factions. The general manager of Universal, William Swanson, asked me to go and seize control of Kay-Bee. I was armed with power of attorney and I took a bunch of cowboys armed with guns. I remember Fred Mace, the comedian, and a group of them were sitting there playing cards when we marched in and seized control. That was quite a thing to do .1 was told to search the place, and I came across private papers showing just who was out for a fast buck. They were pretty wild guys in those days.\" Griffith, Sennett, Ince, Zukor, Lasky, De Mille by 19 14, Hollywood had become the center of a major industry. Its advantages, however, were not apparent to everyone. When Francis X. Bushman was brought out to California to make one picture a month for Fred Balshofer, he found it extremely difficult. The blight of Los Angeles today is smog; at that time it was ordinary fog. spate of foggy mornings put paid to the company's plans. Often it was not possible to begin shooting until two in the afternoon, when the fog had cleared. \"And it wasn't just the fog,\" said Bushman. \"This is semitropical .\n\n.\n\n—\n\nA\n\n5 Early Hollywood\n\nH*\n\n.1*^*\n\n\"^\n\n^v4%\"'ft^\"\n\n^jmm^fm\n\n-i,\n\n^iiifi' ^n^ jsrm\n\n'S..™...\n\n.\n\n-^i\n\n:;^'\n\nmF^w ^, ^IS***^'\"^\n\n\\«*^^ • ..\n\n';»,;\",:.:;',./\n\n';,;•.\n\n*\"\n\naa C^* .•\n\n^Hh^ ^g;/,.-\n\n-Hs^^\n\nl^i:\n\n1 ^HHH^K^\n\nriit ^\n\n!Wb\n\nMotion Pictures East and West.

By 1 9 19, eighty per cent of the motion pictures of the world were being produced in southern California. Some citizens of Hollywood regarded the activities of the motionpicture people with dismay, feeling as though their respectable town had been overrun by gypsies. Others were indifferent, displaying no more interest in the film makers' antics than in the games of the neighborhood children. Film people were called \"movies\" by Hollywood residents, who were unaware that the term referred to the product, not to the personnel. The word conjured up the right sort of vision; it was vaguely suggestive of irritating insects. The more influential citizens took a firm stand against the \"movies,\" and for many years it was as hard for a motion-picture person to join a country club as it was for a Jew or a Negro. For this was the West; its respectability was a thin and brittle veneer that inadequately concealed California's explosive past. Anything out of the ordinary was shunned. As late as 191 8, the exclusive Garden Court Apartments were holding out against picture people, and only the dignified, conservative, and English J. Stuart Blackton was allowed residence there.\n\nOstracized by Los Angeles society, the motion-picture colony enjoyed a healthy democracy. The casual atmosphere lasted until Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were married and began entertaining visiting dignitaries. Class distinctions then began to consolidate.\n\nThe lower\n\ncowboys, stagehands, and people who worked at Universal. Blue blood was generally established by green currency. Later, it was deemed necessary to marry into the foreign aristocracy; a number of penniless immigrants added a title to their names and received warm welcomes in Hollywood. Whenever orders were\n\nextras,\n\nroyalty arrived, the motion-picture aristocrats fought for invitations.\n\nThe\n\nPrincess Beatriz de Ortego y Braganza of Alhambre Granada, Spain, was given the red-carpet treatment until she was unmasked as a typist from San Francisco.\n\nHowe: \"Ever since Doug and Mary lowered the drawPickfair to the Duke d'Alba and Lord and Lady MountHollywood has been rushing royalty.

Both Beatrice Lillie and Peggy Hopkins Joyce were starred; Miss Lillie was a fine comedienne in her own right, while Peggy Hopkins Joyce was the subject of numerous scandal stories. Some of the aristocrats, refugees from Russia, genuinely needed work. Others took part in pictures for the fun of\n\nViscount Glerawly was cast by Cecil B.

H. L. Mencken, editor of The American Mercury, said in 1927 that the wildest nightlife he encountered was at Aimee Semple McPherson's tabernacle. \"I saw no wildness among the movie folk.

Even\n\nBalti-\n\nmore can't beat it.\"^ Generalizations about Hollywood are also generalizations about Los Angeles, Glendale, Burbank, Culver City, Malibu, and Santa Monica. Hollywood is a generic term as well as a specific place. When you arrive in Hollywood itself, you are still miles away from several major Hollywood studios and six miles from the homes of the stars in Beverly Hills. It is for this reason that the sprawUng city of Los Angeles has been called \"six suburbs of a city.\" Hollywood was transformed from a paradise for retired lowan farmers into a seventh heaven for youth. Catering to the two extremes, the town did not provide those links with the past that give stability to the present; there were no art galleries, very few bookshops, no proper theaters or museums, and, until the Hollywood Bowl was built, no concert halls. Europeans could find no point of reference, and they were\n\nmade uneasy by\n\nthe all-pervading atmosphere of\n\nimperma-\n\nwas a cultural vacuum. In this respect it was little different from other American country towns. But as the capital of an industry, outsiders expected Hollywood to offer them the amenities and tradition nence. It\n\nof the capital of a nation.\n\nEntertainment was what Hollywood and its environs offered, and they offered it in the widest possible variety. While motion-picture people were highly circumspect during the week, retiring at ten in order to get up at five in the morning, the weekends were different. Prohibition did\n\nlittle\n\nto\n\ndampen\n\nthe attractions of\n\nHollywood\n\nnight-\n\nwas near enough to the coast to receive plentiful supand when drink was required, curtains were discreetly drawn. From the earliest days, the underworld took a firm grip; petty racketeers, drug peddlers, blackmailers, and phony agents found Hollywood a paradise. One of the most dangerous men was a charming, apparently inoffensive actor on the Sennett lot. \"Everyone who took drugs in the industry was started by this man,\" said Eddie Sutherland. \"He was one of the quietest, nicest actors I've ever known. He put Mabel Normand on the junk, Wallie Reid, Alma Rubens. All three died as a direct result. Somebody would have a hangover, and he'd say, 'I'll fix it for you,' and that was that.\" EHvorces and illicit affairs provided the newspapers with a sohd core of gasp-producing features.

She worked at Sennett; I knew her well. She was very sweet, but she was suffering from several diseases, one of which so shocked Sennett that he closed down the studio and had it fumigated, so none of the boys at Keystone would have had anything to do with her.\"^ And according to Eddie Sutherland, \"Roscoe was destroyed by ambitious lawyers and some renegade people from Hollywood who gave him the worst of it when he'd given them the best of it.\" Hollywood was seriously affected by the scandal, and many people who remember the case are\n\nstill\n\nbitter\n\nabout\n\nit.\n\nHollywood's golden era was for many the most desperate time of Thousands of girls poured into the town, pathetically anxious to work in pictures.

This was always risky,\n\nsometimes downright dangerous, for few men would allow a girl to refuse their hospitahty once they had her in the car. The other extra girls would offer no help. Their position was every bit as desperate. The movie czar Will Hays, who had been made supreme arbiter in 1922 after Hollywood's scandals had shaken box-office receipts, tried to stem the flow. He ensured that all extras were obtained through Central Casting. But the flow did not stop; the misery merely increased. Studio casting offices were the scenes of daily emotional outbursts.\n\nPhotoplay writer Ruth Waterbury tried to beat the new casting system and break into movies on her own merit. She failed, and her reminiscences remain a terrifying account of what Hollywood offered an extra girl. On one occasion, after a series of exhausting experiences, Miss Waterbury was waiting in a casting office. An actor asked some girls if they had worked recently. They hadn't. Instead of a job, he produced a handful of mints. \"I'm big-hearted. I just made three-fifty.

Nevertheless, to ignore this grim background to the golden age would be as dishonest and misleading as discounting the casualties of a great victory.

One wall of the barn dissolved away to show a flock of sheep being tended by a Christ figure. The dissolve itself was difficult enough, but the problem was increased by the flock of sheep. Whenever the scene was about to be shot, the sheep wandered away. Rosher had the carpenters build high platforms which were camouflaged with grass and foliage, and the sheep placed on top. Unwilling to break their necks by jumping off the edge, the sheep stayed put. For Rosita, Mary Pickford's version of \"Don Cesar de Bazan,\" directed by Ernst Lubitsch, Rosher created a new method of lighting. Wrote a reviewer: \"The really exceptional photography seen in Rosita\n\n...\n\nthe screen.\n\nis\n\nlikely to establish a\n\nThe\n\nresult\n\nnew school\n\nof photographic art for\n\nMr. Rosher has attained with\n\nhis\n\nnew method\n\nan almost perfect perspective of the third dimension, or stereoshowing the figures in bold relief in the foreground, at the same time keeping the background sharply in focus yet obtaining the long-sought-for effect of showing distance on a flat surface.

She did a lot of her own directing. The director would often just direct the crowd. At the end of a scene, whoever was directing, she would always ask me for my opinion. I often chose the setups; I'd get her to play a scene where I could light her favorably. \"On orthochromatic film, hair always looked dark unless you specially Ht it.

I did special tests of their stars to demonstrate glamour lighting. They always lit them with heavy, dramatic lighting and deep shadows. Erich Pommer was there then, and he put me under contract for a year, with Mary's consent. I acted as consultant on F. W. Mumau's Faust. I didn't do anything on the picture, but Murnau expected to go to America, and he kept asking, 'How would they do this in Hollywood?' \"Carl Hoffman photographed Faust and I learned a great deal from him.

My friend and associate, Karl Struss, operated the camera on this scene. It was a big undertaking; practically every shot was on the move. The German designers built an enormous set on the Fox lot, with false-perspective buildings. Real streetcars were brought in, and streetcar rails laid. \"For the forest scene, a mile-long track was built out at Lake Arrowhead; the end of the track came right in to the city. All of it was specially built, including the streetcar, which was mounted on an automobile chassis. On those big scenes, such as the fairground and the cafe, I think I used more lights than had ever been used before.\" Sunrise is a great film; slow and classical. Photographically, it is a work of genius. Its European flavor is very strong, even though it was made in California. But however brilliant the European cameramen may have been, no one could have infused the visuals with such a combination of delicacy and richness as the great Charles Rosher.\n\nMurnau\n\nclearly trusted his\n\nMurnau\n\ncameraman\n\nimplicitly.\n\n\"I\n\nfound\n\nit\n\ndiffi-\n\ntell you if I would have continued to work with Murnau on Four Devils, but I had to go back to Mary Pickford.

Mary said, 'If you don't like him or his photography after you've worked with him, I'll talk to you again.' We got along fine, and after that he borrowed me whenever I was between pictures.\" He photographed Sidney Franklin's Smilin' Thru with Norma Talmadge and Tiger Rose with Lenore Ulric.\n\n—\n\nthe only time Harry Warner has \"I got a bonus on that picture ever been known to give a bonus. Ulric had to be back in the theater by a certain date. If we hadn't finished the picture by then, we'd have to go to New York and carry on while she was rehearsing.\n\nThat would have been pretty expensive. Well, Harry Warner began to sweat. \" 'Charlie,' he said, 'I'd\n\nbe very grateful\n\nif\n\nyou'd help\n\nme\n\nover\n\nthis.\n\nTry and put the pressure on before she returns.' He said that to me, see, because Sid couldn't put pressure on anybody; he was only concerned with the actors. Well, I did my best, and we managed to complete the picture before she went to her rehearsals. We were now back from location at the Sunset Boulevard studios of Warner Brothers. And Harry called me into his office. \" 'I want to thank you, Charlie, for putting on the pressure and getting us through. If we'd gone to New York it would have cost us twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars more to finish the picture.'\n\nAnd he\n\nproffered\n\nme\n\na check.\n\nI\n\ntook\n\nit,\n\nbut he kept hold of his\n\nwas only doing my duty, and I shouldn't really accept. You see, I was getting a salary from Mary Pickford, who had loaned me, as well as a salary from Warners. But if I'd let go of that check, he'd have put it on the table, and I could hardly pick it up after all I'd said. \"So I just kept hold of it. He kept on talking and I kept on holding and at last he let go. I looked at it, and found that it was for the Warners handing a thousand dollars. That was epoch-making end.\n\nI\n\nsaid\n\nI\n\nwas very\n\n—\n\ngrateful but that\n\nI\n\n—\n\nout a bonus.\" David Belasco, the great impresario, who had produced the stage version of Tiger Rose, was so delighted with Rosher's work that he sent him a telegram:\n\nYOUR CAMERA WORK IN THE TIGER ROSE PICTURE IS SO SUPERB THAT I HASTEN TO CONGRATULATE YOU YOUR LIGHTING EFFECTS ARE GOD GIVEN IN THEIR NATURALNESS AND BEAUTY YOU HAVE MORE THAN CONFIRMED ALL THAT I HAVE HEARD OF YOUR ARTISTRY DAVID BELASCO Belasco, the pioneer of elaborate stage effects,\n\ni8 Charles Rosher\n\nknew what he was\n\nRosher claims, however, that it was only because he had made Lenore Ulric look good in the close-ups. \"Belasco was sweet on Ulric she was his pet, and that was why I\n\ntalking about.\n\n—\n\ngot that cable.\"\n\nRosher preferred to work with men who understood the problems of photography and who would allow him the time needed to achieve the effects they wanted. This was not always possible. \"Sam Wood was selfish; he wasn't interested in my job, and he never gave me enough time. He didn't want to devote time to photography unlike Sidney Franklin, who was so tasteful, so highly\n\n—\n\nsensitive.\n\nworking with Robert Z. Leonard, husband of Mae Murray.

It sounds simple enough today fairies walking over Tom Moore's hand ^but it had to be done with the old Pathe camera, and it was not easy at all. The fairies were children; one of them was Loretta Young. \"Another fine director who appreciated photography was Maurice Tourneur, for whom I photographed The White Circle.\" In 1927, Rosher began work for United Artists' Tempest, originally planned as a von Stroheim picture, but now a Barrymore vehicle, directed by the Russian emigre director Viatcheslav Tourjansky. In France, Tourjansky had worked with Abel Gance on Napoleon and had directed the brilliant Michel Strogoff with Ivan Mosjoukine. \"Tourjansky was a perfect delight to work with. He had a camera eye, great taste, and a fine imagination. But he wasn't fast enough. I don't know the details of the dispute, but Schenck took him off the picture. Lewis Milestone was brought in, but Sam Taylor finished the picture. The leading woman, Dorothy Sebastian, was taken off as well as Tourjansky, and replaced with Schenck's girl friend, Camilla Horn, who had been in Mumau's Faust. \"By this time I had developed my Rosher Kino Portrait Lens. In Germany, in 1926, I had the opportunity with a big optical company there to develop this lens. It gave a rather marvelous quality, and roundness, almost a stereoscopic quality. The lens was tried out in Germany; the first time it was used was by Gunther Rittau on von Sternberg's Blue Angel for the close-ups of Marlene Dietrich. The first time I used it was on My Best Girl with Mary Pickford. And it is still in use in Russia, with my name on it. \"Barrymore was especially pleased with it because its softness smoothed away his dewlaps. For the first time he could be photographed properly full-face; before, they had to favor the famous profile. I was the only one who could get him on the set. He was half-stiff from drink most of the time. He used to get me in his dressing \"I liked\n\n—\n\n—\n\n265\n\n— room\n\nto\n\ndrink Napoleon brandy with him;\n\nused to pour\n\nit\n\nsur-\n\ndirector, hardly an ideal choice for a\n\nRus-\n\nI\n\nreptitiously into a flower vase.\"\n\nSam Taylor was a\n\nfull\n\na\n\ncomedy\n\nHe was\n\nmelodrama.\n\nsian\n\ncommand\n\na very imaginative director, however, with\n\nof motion-picture technique; thanks to his direction,\n\nand to Rosher's beautiful camera work, Tempest emerged as a richly impressive production, the epitome of the romantic Hollywood spectacle\n\nof the\n\nlate\n\ntwenties.\n\nAfter Tempest, Rosher did location work in the Canadian Rockies Barrymore film.

Rosher went to the studio, and attended a meeting with Sam Tay-\n\nfor another\n\nand the sound engineers. They produced a plan, showing the positions of the cameras. Each camera would be contained in an insulated booth; the plan was carefully worked out to enable entire scenes to be shot at one time. \"Taylor and the sound men must have spent a lot of time laying out these plans. No consideration had been given as to how the cameraman was to achieve satisfactory lighting.\" At this time, 1929, the sound engineers had not found a way of recording close-ups and long shots and maintaining the levels, so scenes had to be shot in a sort of television style. \"Sound dominated everything in Hollywood, and photography took lor\n\na great setback for over a year. Anyway, I expressed myself freely, and as a result my career with Mary Pickford came to an end fortunately without any unpleasantness. I took\n\nno part\n\nin the\n\nproduc-\n\ntion.\"\n\nA new career began for Charles Rosher. While in Germany, he had received an offer from British International Pictures, in Elstree, which he had been forced to turn down. Now he told them he was available, and he was immediately engaged. While E. A. Dupont set up Atlantic, the story of the sinking of the Titanic, Rosher photographed The Vagabond Queen (Geza von Bolvary) with Betty Balfour, known as the Mary Pickford of England. After working on La Route est Belle (Robert Florey), he returned to\n\nHollywood\n\nin\n\n1930,\n\nand started work\n\nAcademy Award\n\nat\n\nM-G-M. Having won\n\n—\n\ncameraman for Sunrise Rosher received another Academy Award for The Yearling (directed by Clarence Brown, produced by Sidney Franklin, 1946).

He also became a Life Fellow the\n\n—\n\nfirst\n\never given to a\n\nof the Royal Photographic Society, a fellow of the Photographic Society '\n\nThe working\n\ntitle\n\nwas King of\n\n18 Charles Rosher\n\nthe Mountains,\n\nand only fellowship award to a cinematographer from the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, in 1950. He received his highest award when the Professional Photographers of America made him an Honorary Master of Photography. But Charles Rosher's greatest accomplishment took place during the silent era when he, and a small group of top-flight cameramen, changed the look of American films. As Mary Pickford said, at the opening of the Eastman House Photographic Museum in 1950, \"Charles Rosher is the dean of cameramen.\" Charles Rosher was also one of the great masters of the motion of America, and he received the\n\nfirst\n\npicture.\n\n267\n\n19\n\nART DIRECTION\n\nThe more successful the ticed.\n\nOnly when\n\nof this\n\nit fails,\n\nart direction,\n\nonly\n\nwhen\n\nthe less likely\n\na set looks like a\n\nmuch overlooked department become\n\nSet design, set construction,\n\nand\n\nset\n\nit\n\nset,\n\nis\n\nto\n\nbe no-\n\ndoes the work\n\napparent.\n\ndressing are items taken for\n\ngranted by audiences.

Art direction, or production design, determines the look of a pic-\n\nFor it dictates the atmosphere atmosphere, particularly in films of period reconstruction, is tremendously important. ture almost as forcefully as the lighting.\n\n—and\n\nIn the silent days, art direction was a late developer. The earliest pictures were shot against flats decorated by the property man. If a\n\nscene painter was needed, he was hired from a local theater. Audiences, accustomed to the inadequacy of theatrical sets, were not disturbed by the White House looking like a small-town grocery store. The miracle was that it was there at all.\n\nThe improvement\n\nin\n\nart\n\ndirection paralleled\n\nthe\n\nimprovement\n\nin\n\n19 14, one of the greatest theatrical designers in America, Wilfred Buckland, joined Famous-Players-Lasky. The ephemeral miracles he had achieved for Belasco he now created, more permanently, for films like Carmen, The Cheat, and Joan the Woman. \"Because Buckland had worked with the master realist of the stage,\" wrote Kenneth MacGowan in Photoplay, \"he brought something besides the Belasco plays to Lasky. He brought tasteful richness of setting. Under the flat lighting of most movies [which were then lit by daylight] it would have bored and distracted with quite the force that it does on the stage. But made over by 'Lasky Lighting' as it is it has a today in most of the Famous-Players-Lasky productions splendid and satisfying richness.\"^ Probably the greatest impetus to art direction at this period were the gigantic sets in Intolerance, built without any art director. They took three months to erect, and Frank \"Huck\" Wortman, the master craftsman who built them, aroused much anger in Hollywood when he refused to obey the instructions for instant demolition issued by the Los Angeles fire department. They stood, both a reproach and an encouragement, for almost a year, towering above the site where lighting. In\n\n— —\n\nthe Allied Artists studios\n\nnow\n\nstand.\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst, anxious that Marion Davies should appear in the richest possible settings, brought in Joseph Urban, designer for the Ziegfeld Follies and the Metropolitan Opera House. \"The motion picture offers incomparably the greatest field to any creative artist of brush or blueprint today,\" said Urban, in 1920. \"It is the art of the twentieth century and perhaps the greatest art of ^Photoplay, Jan. 192 1,\n\n79 Art Direction\n\np. 75.\n\nmodern times. It is all so young, so fresh, so untried. It is like an unknown ocean stretching out before a modern Columbus.\"^ A Viennese architect, Urban left Austria in 19 13 and became as celebrated in America as Reinhardt in Germany. Said Julian Johnson in Photoplay, \"The thing that has spread Mr. Urban's name about the United States has been the Ziegfeld Follies, in five gorgeous annual issues. However much Mr. Ziegfeld has done for Mr. Urban, in either finance or notoriety, Mr. Urban has done incalculably more for Mr. Ziegfeld, for, in supervising every item of color and material form, from the lights to the gowns of the girls, he no other ^has created the most beautiful vision of its kind that the stage has ever seen. 'Urban lighting,' 'Urban scenery,' 'Urban curtains,' and, above all, a deep, tropic, furnace-like, fascinating, and almost intolerable shade known as 'Urban blue,' have become household words in every show-\n\n—\n\n—\n\nshop.\"3\n\nArt directors,\n\nlike\n\ncarpenters and prop\n\nUrban,\n\nran into\n\nmen who had had\n\nstrong\n\nresentment from the\n\nthe field to themselves for so\n\nlong. On the Hearst production The World and His Wife (Robert Vignola), the studio carpenter, evidently distrusting Urban's motionpicture ability, brought him a set of postcards as a guide, and some photographs of a Spanish house which he thought should be copied. Urban, with the crushing knowledge of the erudite European, gently explained that he had brought, as an example of the city architecture of New Castile, pictures of a new French chateau built in Andalusia\n\nby a war\n\nprofiteer.\n\nby these design experts. The directors, too, grew impatient. They had to follow carefully laid plans, their movements were restricted, and they could no longer switch haphazardly from setup to setup without elaborate alterations to flats\n\nNot only carpenters were\n\nirritated\n\nand overheads.\n\nOne director explained to Urban that he wanted a model of a Buddhist temple constructed for a dream sequence: \"You build her right up there, about three feet high, and I wheel it up or push it back she gets big or she gets small, just as I place the platform;\n\n—\n\nyou know what\n\nI\n\nmean?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured Urban, \"I know.
