        "text": "As I near the project's final stages, I now look back at my production schedule (seen below) and evaluate how realistic it was, and how well I've kept up with it. I believe the film has been completed to a standard I am happy with, and have kept pretty close to it (give or take a week or so). From previous projects such as the Beano project in 3rd year, as well as 10x10x18, I have learnt what I can achieve in limited periods of time, and so planned the project accordingly.\n\nMuch of the preproduction had taken place in the first semester, however, the visual development had taken another turn after visiting Dubai before returning back to university in January. This firsthand experience of seeing ghaff trees in their natural habitat, along with having the opportunity to photograph the local area, gave me more ideas to look into before I decided to go forward in the production schedule.\n\nLike many animated films, the narrative and shots were constantly changing throughout the project, and I found it difficult to finalise the animatic when I was still playing around with ideas. I also understood that some animations would be difficult to produce with deadline being in a few months, and so had to understand my limitations. I also took the time whilst finalising the animatic to also test the character rig and see how well it would translate across from 2D to 3D.\n\nSound was one aspect that I worry about because the composer / sound designer will need to have a version of the film in a semi-completed state before he could get to work on anything solid. This meant that the animatic has to be spot-on, which I found difficult to produce - again, because there were many scenes (many character-animation driven scenes) that were altered or even removed in their entirety in the final cut. However, we had met up to have several conversations regarding the feeling and atmosphere that the film was meant to convey, and because it is a fluid and experimental piece of filmmaking, I didn't want to have sound rigidly tied down to each shot.\n\nIn order to measure progress, I keep daily notes and tick-boxes in my diary and on my studio white board in order to remind myself what was of high priority that week. I find that this keeps me on track and helps me plan if there are issues, such as certain shots taking unexpectedly long, or if I had extra time to go into more detail. Overall I feel that the project I have undertaken is ambitious yet realistic to achieve with some hard work, and I excited to see the outcome.\n\nFor an internship application for Bartle Bogle Hegarty, I have been asked to answer 5 questions in rather than send in a CV. BBH asked us to answer the questions in any way we wanted. I decided to create 5 motion-graphic animations to answer them. As their brief suggested that they were looking for someone outside the box, I decided to think of wittier ways to answer the questions. They are heavily influenced by the style of motion graphics I create for Vidsy briefs.\n\nWhat does being a black sheep mean to you?\n\nPick a brand that has a good product, but could do better in advertising.\n\nHow would you give it a black sheep makeover?\n\nPick a “zag” that has nothing to do with advertising. Why did you pick it?\n\nYou’ve just been given three bags full of wool.\n\nWhat are you going to do with it?\n\nIf you were a shepherd, how would you find your lost sheep?\n\nBack in November I volunteered myself to create visuals for the 'Music for the Mind' charity concert, which aims to help provide support for young people through art and music. Three of the music acts were keen on having projected visuals as part of their set, and as I am interested in creating a career in visuals for live music and events, I found this to be a useful opportunity to use my skills for a diverse group of musical styles- Barbe Rousse, a psychedelic-inspired band, Dinosaur 94, a punk-inspired band, and the Micro Orchestra.\n\nI met with Barbe Rousse and D94 in person in order to discuss ideas on what they'd like to incorporate into the visuals. I met with D94 and was able to watch them practice, which gave me a sense of how they performed. They were keen on having a bit of a jokey vibe, and really liked the idea of Jeff Goldblum being animated in some form, so I decided to have him ride a dinosaur through Jurassic Park. I had an original idea of having him being chased by dinosaurs but didn't want to make the animation too complex.\n\nAfter meeting with the group I created a rough run based on my Big Eggo character from a previous year's project, however I was not too happy with the results. I remade the animation from scratch, then used After Effects to add extra bits and an endlessly looping background.\n\nIn order to get a better idea of visuals for Barbe Rousse, I met with Alasdair, who listed the band's inspirations and motifs - he liked the idea of colourful interesting visuals, and so I decided to create a kaleidoscope effect that is traditionally synonymous with psychedelic music. I found a file of old photos on my computer, including those that were out of focus and abstract, and used one as the basis for the kaleidoscope on After Effects. Over the course of the set, the colours will change, meaning no pattern is exactly alike.\n\nThe Micro Orchestra is playing two songs - 'Experience' by Ludovico Einaudi and Day One - Interstellar by Hans Zimmer, as seen below. Gonzalo, the organiser of the event, showed me some examples of what the Orchestra wanted, and it seemed that the priority on the visuals was to be a background to the music, rather than overshadow it, so I created a simple looping animation of the stars.\n\nI believe that over the course of the two pitches I have improved my pitching and public speaking skills. In my first pitch I (understandably) was nervous and still unsure what the direction the film was taking, and so it was difficult to answer questions directly as the film was still in its early stages.\n\nIn order to combat this problem I signed up for a university public speaking session to improve my confidence. I learnt that it is important to know what you are talking about and be focussed and concise, so if people ask questions, you can answer more directly, so for the sound design pitch I focussed more on sound design and composition that I was interested in.\n\nTo build that research and confidence, I looked back on a Spotify playlist of music that had inspired me while developing the visuals for the film, and figured out what it was that had drawn me to it. I wanted to give the sound designers/composition students the best idea of what they could be potentially working on, so by showing and explaining my work to them was key to get them inspired.\n\nOverall I feel that as the film as developed, my confidence in my skills and the film have improved, and so my public speaking skills have improved.\n\n​I was asked by a friend to create a 'Draw my Life' style video for Palma Soap, a student-led start-up that helps women in Malawi make money through making and selling sustainable soaps that help prevent the spread of malaria. In order to do so, we discussed what was wanted to be drawn in relation to the script, and created a rough storyboard to follow. I also suggested a stop-motion ending using the whiteboard and photos that they had taken. It was a collaboration between myself (doing the drawing), and Palma (filming, scripting, and recording voice-overs).\n\nOnce the video was filmed, I waited for Palma to provide the voices to match with the visuals, which I sped up using Adobe Suite. They were also keen to get some music, so I had asked on the 10x10 Facebook group if anybody was keen, and quite a few people were. As of this point my work was done, but I am still very interested in how the final product turns out!\n\nAs my animation style and preferences have developed, I find myself interested in motion graphics and animation tailored to be shown live in a club or concert setting. The combination of music and visuals that match the rhythm is mesmerising and a simple way of making a striking _. Colours of Edinburgh, a social awareness project ran by students to create \"a platform for refugees to share their voices through art, photography , and storytelling\" were planning a fundraising club night in The Mash House and had an open call for video submissions under the theme of 'Journeys and Boundaries'. I was creating a small animation for the Pylon Animation competition, which had the similar theme of 'Labyrinth', and so I decided to extend the 30 second piece to 2 minutes in order to partake in this project also.\n\nAs the music being played that evening was \"house, techno and soul tunes by great local DJs\", I wanted to use my motion graphics skills to emphasise a repetitive beat, and be something people could dance to.\n\nI created a quick mind map to explore what I could associate the key words with, and was drawn to the idea of being 'boxed in' inside a cube, and the boundaries that created. I also wanted to improve on the motion graphic style I had used for a couple of my 10x10x18 films last semester. After planning a very rough storyboard, I began creating the shapes in Adobe After Effects, and the 3D cube in Maya. I decided to drop the character animation early on as I felt it was jarring the repetitive experience and didn't add much, as this was not a strictly narrative piece. I chose the name 'perimeter' because of the geometric forms that dominated the film, as well as being something that surrounds a shape, reflecting on the theme of journeys and boundaries.\n\nAfter watching my work being projected alongside music, and having people interacting with it, I feel that this was a very successful piece. The entire process took around 4 days to complete, and I am very happy with the result, and it was a good break from my main project, giving me time to reflect on where my strengths lied.\n\nPassword to view video: Eca_Animation\n\n​Through the freelancers website Vidsy, I was commissioned to create three short advertisements to promote Gumi's app 'The Last Summoner: Brave Frontier'. I was given a brief, assets and a selection of music to work with to bring a client's specific vision to life, and had roughly 48 hours to complete it.\n\nFrom the notes of the brief I listed what was most important for each video and created very rough thumbnails to try and visualise how to best approach. The advertisements were short so they had to grab the attention of a viewer quickly, and keep them excited. Each video had to a different perspective of the animation - one needed to be about the gameplay, one about the characters, and one to build excitement.\n\nThis was a valuable lesson in learning how to use assets that were previously made by someone else to promote a commercial product, rather than a conventional film that I create, often with a narrative structure. It helped me develop my ability to work to a client's brief, as well as my own motion graphics skills."
