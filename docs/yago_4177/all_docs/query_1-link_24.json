First of all I thank all the film directors, producers, camerapersons, actors, critics, and television producers who supplied me with copies of their films, videos, and biographies, and sometimes with stills of their films. Many of them also granted me interviews, in person or by telephone, mail, e-mail, and even tape recording. Underscoring the globalization and diasporization of Iranians—including mediamakers—these interviews spanned the globe, from Iran to various European countries, and from New Zealand to the United States. And underscoring the duration of the project, they extended in time from the mid-1970s to the late 2000s. The interviewees and filmmakers were Abbas (Abbas Attar), Nader Afshar Naderi, Jamsheed Akrami, Mohammad Reza Allamehzadeh, Farshad Aminian, Amir Amirani, Taghi Amirani, Jahanshah Ardalan, Shoja Azari, Fuad Badie, Ramin Bahrani, Bahram Baizai, Rakhshan Banietemad, Manuchehr Bibian, Arlene Dallalfar, Mahmud Dorudian, Ghasem Ebrahimian, Esmail Emami, Tanaz Eshaghian, Shirin Etessam, Anna Fahr, Golshifteh Farahani, Shahriar Farah­vashi, Simin Farkhondeh, Bahman Farmanara, Aryana Farshad, Jalal Fatemi, Tina Gharavi, Ali Ghelichi, Ebrahim Golestan, Shahla Haeri, Mohammad Reza Haeri, Khosrow Haritash, Melissa Hibbard, Mohammad Ali Issari, Erica Jordan, Pirooz Kalantari, Shahram Karimi, Maryam Kashani, Mehrdad Kashani, Maryam Keshavarz, Laleh Khadivi, Hossein Khandan, Fakhri Khorvash, Abbas Kiarostami, Bahman Kiarostami, Masud Kimiai, Parviz Kimiavi, Kim Longinotto, Bahman Maghsoudlou, Moslem Mansouri,\n\nDariush Mehrjui, Ziba Mir-Hosseini, Bahman Mofid, Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, Behnaz A.

Each volume’s bibliography provides details of the interviews. I interviewed several cinema and television administrators in Iran during the Pahlavi and Islamic Republic periods to gain insight into official procedures and perspectives. Those interviewed included Gholamhosain Alaq­ eh­­ band, Mohammad Beheshti, Mohammad Hasan Khoshnevis, Kambiz Mahmoudi, and Alireza Shojanoori. To gain insight into the movies’ sociohistorical contexts of production and reception I interviewed spectators, witnesses, relatives, and scholars. These included Mehrdad Amanat, Zia Ashraf Nasr, Hamid Khan Bakhtiari, Cosroe Chaqueri, Mohammad Ali Djamalzadeh, Houshang Golmakani, Faezeh Golshan, Jalal Golshan, Shusha Guppy, Ahmet Gurata, Latifeh Haghighi, Jafar Hakimzadeh, Amir Hassanpour, Badi’eh Misaqiyeh (Eshraghian), Reza Nafisi (my uncle), Parviz Navi, Alaviyeh Okhovat (my grandmother), Batul Okhovat (my mother), Amir Bahman Samsam, Emmanuel Sevrugian, and Ali Shakeri. The Foundation for Iranian Studies in Washington kindly supplied me with transcripts of interviews with major cinema, television, and culture industry leaders of the Pahlavi era, including transcripts of lengthy interviews with Farrokh Gaffary, Shahrokh Golestan, Kambiz Mahmoudi, Mohammad Naficy, Arby Ovanessian, and Mehrdad Pahlbod. Likewise, the Boroumand Foundation in Washington, which documents human rights violations in Iran, provided me with newspaper clippings on the Rex Cinema fire in Abadan and political persecutions in Iran. Poori Soltani, a senior research librarian at the National Library of Iran, graciously supplied me with data on film periodicals. Hosain Tousi, the director general of mcig’s Research and Cinematic Relations immediately after the revolution, provided me with the early, unpublished regulations and guidelines governing film review and censorship under the Islamic Republic. xiv\n\nac k no w l e d gmen t s\n\nHasan Khoshnevis, director of the National Film Archive of Iran, facilitated my research and film viewing at the archive in Tehran and sat for interviews with me. I also benefited from discussions with other colleagues at the national film archive, namely Gholam Haidari, Fereydoun Khameneipour, and Ladan Taheri. To examine nonfiction films about Iran, I visited the United States National Archives and Records Services and the Library of Congress’s Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, both in Washington, to examine records of usia/usis films and other documentaries. A visit to the Defense Audiovisual Agency at Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino, California, produced information on military newsreels and raw footage shot by U.S. military units inside Iran after the Second World War. The ucla Film and Television Archive helped me with information on Hearst News and Hearst Metrotone News newsreels. A visit to the University of South Carolina helped with materials on the following newsreels about Iran: Fox News, Fox Movietone, Paramount News, Pathé News, Universal Newsreel, UPITN, Visnews, and Pathé Sound News. The British National Film Archives and the British Film Institute in London were helpful on various newsreels and documentaries on Iran. I also visited the British Public Records Office to examine the files of the British Council’s cultural activities in Iran. In the United States I obtained the Confidential United States Central Files on Iran’s Internal Affairs and the Foreign Affairs Records of the Department of State Relating to Internal Affairs of Iran for the Second World War and the Cold War through microfilm and Internet research. These British and American diplomatic files are rich in documents relating to Iran’s sociopolitical and cultural conditions, if one persists long enough in sifting through thousands of pages of unrelated materials. They proved invaluable in my charting the rivalry among the former allies after the Second World War to influence the hearts and minds of Iranians through cinema. At the Danish Film Institute in Copenhagen, the archivist Mikael Braae helped me with screening and translating the railway film Iran, the New Persia. Another archivist, Palle Bøgelund Petterson, supplied additional printed information and films. Professor I. B. Bondebjerg, head of the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Media, Cognition, and Communication, facilitated my visit and research in the Danish capital. In Washington I was able to examine the collection of Antoin Sevruguin’s photographs at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery thanks to Massumeh Farhad, the chief curator and the curator of Islamic art. In Heidelberg I interviewed Sevruguin’s grandson, Emmanuel Sevrugian, for further insight into his grandfather’s photographic and filmic ac kno wled gments\n\nxv\n\ncareer. At the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, I examined the M. Eleanor Fitzgerald Papers for materials on Nilla Cram Cook, with assistance from the archivist Christel Maass. Finally, I visited the Brigham Young University Archives to examine Merian C. Cooper’s papers on Grass and King Kong, and I visited the Museum of Modern Art in New York to view the original blackand-white and tinted versions of Grass, as well as footage shot for its remake. I gained further information about films on Iran by corresponding with the Imperial War Museum in London (for wartime newsreels), the Scottish Film Archive and the British Petroleum Company Limited (for oil films), the United Nations Visual Material Library (for un films on Iran), the Sherman Grinberg Film Library (for various newsreels), the John E. Allen Inc. Film Library (for Kinogram and Telenews newsreels), and the Abraham F. Rad Contemporary Jewish Film Archive in Jerusalem. For television newscasts and documentaries on Iran, I visited and corresponded with various television archives, including the abc News Television Archive, the cbs News Film/Tape Documentary Archive, the nbc News Television Archive, the pbs News Tape Archive, the bbc News Television Archive, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the ctv Television Network (Canada), and the Vanderbilt Television News Archive in Nashville. Abazar Sepehri, head Middle Eastern librarian at the University of Texas, Austin, helped me many times to track down Persian-language sources and articles. Likewise, Jet Prendeville, the art and architecture librarian at Rice University, assisted me in tracking down English and foreign-language film sources. Academic colleagues in various disciplines in the United States were very helpful. Paula Amad and Peter Bloom provided me with copies of the film Yellow Cruise and with relevant materials on it; Jennifer Fey commented on my paper on Rakhshan Banietemad, as did Janet Afary on the chapters on Reza Shah and the preface, Marianne Hopmann on my discussion of the oral tradition, and Majid Naficy on parts of chapter 6 (vol. 2) and the preface (vol. 1). George Marcus, Chuck Kleinhans, Mehdy Naficy, Nahal Naficy, Azar Nafisi, and Mohammad Nafissi commented on the preface. Philip Lutgendorf shared with me his unpublished paper on Indian cinema, and Natasa Durovicova shared her articles on sound and dubbing. Camron Michael Amin provided information on U.S. government files on Iran, and Amir Hassanpour provided information on Kurdish cinema and satellite television. Jalil Doostkhah helped with the names of the Isfahan circle of intellectuals. Mehrnaz SaeedVafa was extremely helpful throughout my research, supplying me with films\n\nxvi\n\nac k no w l e d gmen t s\n\nand assisting me in tracking down information on Iranian cinema and filmmakers. Colleagues in Iran were also very helpful. Houshang Golmakani, editor in chief of Mahnameh-ye Sinemai-ye Film, made sure that I received issues of the journal, sent me stills that I requested, and assisted with other inquiries. Mohammad Atebbai of Iranian Independents put several documentaries at my disposal. The documentarian Pirooz Kalantari was conscientious and generous in supplying me with documents, books, films, photographs, and other research materials from Iran, far beyond his own works. Shahin Kharazmi of Tehran’s Industrial Management Institute supplied me with data on media uses and audience demography in Iran. Esmail Emami facilitated my meeting with members of the Iranian Society of Documentary Filmmakers in Tehran. Mohammad Tahaminejad and Homayun Emami also helped with information on documentary cinema. Elsewhere, the art curator Rose Issa in London shared with me videos and posters of Iranian movies. The journalist Homa Sarshar and the Center for Iranian Jewish Oral History in Los Angeles kindly supplied me with a copy of the film A Mother for Shamsi. Mehdi Zamani facilitated my interview in Los Angeles with the actor Bahman Mofid, while Mohammad Ali Yazdi did the same for my interview with Sohrab Shahid Saless. The photographer and artist Soody Sharifi kindly put at my disposal her photograph of the “movie set.” Sima Shakhsari of the University of California, Berkeley, helped to identify Iranian blogs and movie blogs. Debra Zimmerman of Women Make Movies made Iranian films available for my viewing, as did Barbara Scharess, the director of programming at Chicago’s Gene Siskel Film Center. I helped launch two long-lasting annual film festivals at universities in the United States. I worked with Geoffrey Gilmore in 1990, then of the ucla Film and Television Archive, to curate one of the first and longest-running festivals of Iranian cinema in the United States. In Houston I worked with Marian Luntz, the film curator of the Museum of Fine Art, and Charles Dove, cinema director at Rice University, to organize an annual festival of Iranian films there. Programming and curating these festivals, which still continue, provided me with important venues and opportunities for further research, film viewing, interviews with filmmakers, and the promotion of Iranian cinema. At Rice University my research assistant Danny Stuyck and the visual resource assistant Kathleen Hamilton scanned still images for the book. Michael Dyrby Jensen translated a Danish text for me. The anthropology doctoral student Nahal Naficy was a valuable, resourceful, and cheerful help as my primary bilingual research assistant. She wrote the draft of the caption on\n\nac kno wled gments\n\nxvii\n\nSharifi’s “movie set” artwork (chapter 4, vol. 2). At Northwestern University my research assistants Neha Kamdar, Daniel Bashara, John Nicolau, Jason Roberts, and Racquel Gates helped with the book’s images and bibliography. The research phases of the book were funded in large part by summer research grants that I received from the deans of humanities at Rice University, Gayle Stokes and Gary Wihl, which allowed me to take research trips and to visit archives in various countries, as well as to write. The Art History Department’s Segal Fund at Rice University paid for my research assistants and equipment. A travel-to-collection grant from ucla’s Von Gruenbaum Center for Middle East Studies made possible my research visit to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The writing phase of the book was primarily funded by major national grants from the National Endowment for Humanities Fellowship (neh05020401) and the American Council of Learned Societies, the Social Science Research Council, and the National Endowment for Humanities International and Area Studies Fellowship (r14820–363000, neh fa-51979, osr 05020401), which Rice University matched, thus allowing me to spend the academic year 2004–5 entirely on writing the bulk of the manuscript. Gary Wihl also kindly provided subvention funds for the publication of this multivolume book, as did Barbara O’Keefe, Northwestern University’s dean of the School of Communication. Northwestern University in Qatar also contributed. I thank all these institutions and individuals for their generous assistance. My editor Ann Klefstad went through the manuscript as usual with a finetoothed comb, helping to sculpt the text. Ken Wissoker, editorial director at Duke University Press, was a delight to work with; he guided the project with openness, patience, wisdom, and élan. A project as extensive as this naturally involves not only professional colleagues but also family and friends in various witting and unwitting capacities. My siblings—Naficeh, Nahid, Nasrin, Nooshin, Mehdy, and Majid—all helped in one way or another with research, information gathering, and the mailing of films and other materials for the book. I interviewed my mother and my paternal grandmother about their social lives and experiences with cinema. I learned to appreciate Iranian popular culture, perhaps initially from the joyful and lilting manner in which my mother sang the popular songs of her youth, songs that her strict Muslim parents had forbidden to her. My father’s research-mindedness and intellectual curiosity, which turned our childhood outings into lessons in local botany and medical anthropology, became a model for my commitment to academic research and education. Durxviii\n\nac k no w l e d gmen t s\n\ning my research travels many family members and friends in various places provided me with a home away from home: Mehdy Naficy and Fariba JafarShaghaghi in Heidelberg; Mohammad Nafissi and Georgiana Parry-Crooke in London; Fatemeh Ebtehaj and Hamid Hakimzadeh in London; Azar Nafisi and Bijan Naderi in Washington; Nastaran and Vahid Naficy in Tehran; and Paul and Helen Edwards in Helena, Montana. Montana’s majestic and enduring natural world offered an implacable contrast against which human history, particularly one as recent and as marred with moral and political ambiguities as that of the cinema and entertainment fields, found its proper perspective. This book has been with me for so long that it feels like a third child, older than my two biological children, Cameron and Shayda, both of whom are now thriving, idealistic young people close to the age at which I unknowingly began this project. My life partner Carol (Kelly) Edwards has been with me every step of the way, through thick and thin, in Iran, in the United States, and in many other places in between. All three have been unconditionally supportive of my life choices, my career and its demands, including this book project (Kelly scanned many of the stills). I hope that I have, in the end, been deserving of their respect, love, and trust.\n\nac kno wled gments\n\nxix\n\norga niz at ion of t he volumes\n\nT\n\nhe book is divided into four volumes, covering the social history of over a century of Iranian cinema, from around 1897 to about 2010. The history of Iranian society and the cinema it produced in this period is bookended by two revolutions: the 1905–11 Constitutional Revolution, which brought in a constitutional monarchy, and the 1978–79 Islamic Revolution, which installed a republican theocratic state. While the impact of the first revolution on cinema and film culture was apparently limited and inchoate, the latter revolution profoundly affected them, resulting in their unprecedented efflorescence. As a work of social history and theory, these volumes deal not only with such chronological developments in society and in the film industry but also with the synchronic contexts, formations, dispositions, and maneuvers that overdetermined modernity in Iran and a dynamically evolving film industry and its unique products. I locate the film industry and its mode of production, narratives, aesthetics, and generic forms in the interplay of deeply rooted Iranian performative and visual arts and what was imported, adopted, adapted, translated, mistranslated, and hybridized from the West. The interplay between Iranian and Islamic philosophies and aesthetics complicated and channeled cinema, particularly that involving women, in ways unique to Iran, which are discussed throughout the volumes. Likewise, the contribution of Iranian ethnoreligious minorities, both widespread and profound, gave Iranian cinema additional specificity. The volumes also situate Iranian cinema at the intersection of state-driven authoritarian modernization, nationalist and Islamist politics, and geopolitics during its tumultuous century, charting the manner in which local, national, regional, and international powers competed for ascendancy in Iran, affect-\n\ning what Iranians saw on screens, what they produced, and the technologies they adopted. The logic of dividing the work into four volumes is driven by both sociopolitical developments and the evolution of the film industry. While these volumes are autonomous, each contributes to the understanding and appreciation of the others, as certain theoretical, stylistic, industrial, commercial, cultural, religious, sociopolitical, biographical, authorial, and governmental elements form lines of inquiry pursued throughout, gathering momentum and weight. Each volume has a table of contents, a bibliography, an index, and when needed appendices.\n\nVolume 1: The Artisanal Era, 1897–1941 This volume offers a theory linking Iranian modernity and national identity with the emergence of an inchoate artisanal cinema and with an othered cinematic subjectivity. Qajar-era cinema consisted of the exhibition of foreign actualities and narratives and the production of a limited number of domestic actualities and comic skits by pioneer exhibitors and producers, all of whom are featured. The image of women on the screens and the presence of women as spectators in movie houses proved controversial, resulting in the first act of film censorship. Borrowing from the curtain reciting tradition, live movie translators (dilmaj) helped increase narrative comprehension and the enjoyment of Western movies. Reza Shah Pahlavi dissolved the Qajar dynasty in 1925 and ruled until 1941. During his rule, the first Pahlavi period, the state implemented an authoritarian syncretic Westernization program that attempted to modernize and secularize the multicultural, multilingual, and multiethnic Iranians into a homogenous modern nation. Cinematic representations of a fast modernizing Iran in documentaries and fiction movies were encouraged, photography and movie production were tightly controlled, movie houses were regulated, and perceived affronts to Iran in Western documentaries were taken seriously. The veil was outlawed and dandies flourished. All these developments receive extensive coverage in this volume. Despite efforts to centralize and control cinema, film production proved marginal to state formation and remained artisanal. Only one silent feature film was produced domestically, while all sound features were produced by an Iranian expatriate in India. This latter fact and others discussed in the volume show Iranian cinema’s trans­ national nature from the start. xxii\n\no r g ani zat i on of t he v olu mes\n\nVolume 2: The Industrializing Years, 1941–1978 During the second Pahlavi period (Mohammad Reza Shah, 1941–79), cinema flourished and became industrialized, producing at its height over ninety films a year. The state was instrumental in building the infrastructures of the cinema and television industries, and it instituted a vast apparatus of censorship and patronage. During the Second World War and its aftermath, the three major Allied powers—the United Kingdom, the United States, and the ussr—competed with each other to control what Iranians saw on movie screens. One chapter examines this fascinating history. In the subsequent decades, two major parallel cinemas emerged: the commercial filmfarsi movies, popular with average spectators, forming the bulk of the output, and a smaller but influential cinema of dissent, the new-wave cinema. The commercial filmfarsi movies, exemplified by the stewpot and tough-guy genres discussed extensively in two chapters, were for entertainment purposes and drew their power and charm from their stars and their rootedness in Iranian traditions, which were juxtaposed favorably and often comically or melodramatically with modern Western traditions. A dynamic nonfiction cinema evolved, which receives a chapter. Ironically, the state both funded and censored much of the new-wave cinema, which grew bolder in its criticism and impact as Pahlavi authoritarianism consolidated. The new-wave films, produced by the collaboration of Westernized filmmakers with modernist dissident writers, did well in international film festivals, starting the globalization of Iranian cinema. The impending revolution could retrospectively be read in the fear-driven narratives of the new-wave films and in the various cultural struggles around official culture and arts festivals, the censorship of films, religious sermons on audiocassettes, poetry reading nights, television trials and confessions, and underground filming, all of which I discuss at length.\n\nVolume 3: The Islamicate Period, 1978–1984 Identified toward the end of the Shah’s rule as one of the agents of moral corruption in the country, movies and movie houses became targets of a rising anti-Shah movement, resulting in the destruction of a third of all movie houses nationwide. This volume charts both such revolutionary destruction and the subsequent rebuilding and evolution of the film and media industries. Many above-the-line personnel in these industries found themselves org a n izatio n o f the vo lumes\n\nxxiii\n\nsidelined, banned, arrested, deprived of property, or exiled. The star system, a major attraction of filmfarsi cinema, was thus dismantled. Movies were banned, cut, redubbed, and painted over to remove offending features. After such iconoclastic destructions and purification the new Islamic regime undertook a wide-ranging effort to institutionalize a new film industry whose values would be commensurate with the newly formulated Islamicate values. The first rules and regulations governing film production and exhibition were adopted in 1982. Like the second Pahlavi regime, the ayatollahs’ regime put into place a strong, centralized, and draconian system of state regulation and patronage to encourage politically correct movies. The import of foreign movies oscillated but was eventually banned, leaving the field open for a new domestic cinema. The long war with Iraq, the gendered segregation of space, and the imposition of the veil on women encouraged certain ideological and aesthetic trends. Foremost was the reconceptualization of cinema from a despised agent of corruption and othering to an agent of nation building and selfing. However, the resulting Islamicate cinema and culture were neither homogeneous nor static. They evolved with considerable personal, institutional, and ideological struggles.\n\nVolume 4: The Globalizing Era, 1984–2010 The revolutionary experience, the bloody eight-year war with Iraq, and the perceived Western cultural invasion of Iran all encouraged soul searching, national epistemophilia, and a desire for self-representation, resulting in an array of documentary films and film forms about the revolution, war, and the various social ills and inequalities that accumulated under the Islamist regime. The state-run television and fiction film industries, too, funded and supported filmmakers committed to Islam who made powerful “imposed war” movies in which sacred subjectivity replaced modernist subjectivity. Women’s presence both on camera and behind the camera increased significantly in all genres and types of films, in both the television and movie industries, leading to a veritable “women’s cinema.” The veil evolved from a repressive social institution to a dynamic social practice and critical aesthetics. A deepening sociopolitical and cultural struggle over cinema, media, and culture, and ultimately the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic, emerged in the country. This was reflected in, and shaped by, a new form of public diplomacy, chiefly between Iran and the United States, during Mohammad Khatami’s presidency, which intensified under his successor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. xxiv\n\no r g ani zat i on of t he v olu mes\n\nIn a new “cultural turn” the antagonistic governments began to recruit all sorts of mutual domestic, diasporic, and international film, television, radio, and Internet media and formations to serve this diplomacy, sometimes with dire consequences for the participants. Foreign and exile videos and satellite televisions were officially banned, but enforcement was chaotic, encouraging a thriving culture of resistance that continues to date. With the rise of opposition to the Islamic Republic regime a dissident Internet cinema emerged. The postrevolution era bred its own dissident art-house parallel cinema, involving some of the best Pahlavi-era new-wave directors and a new crop of innovative postrevolution directors, placing Iranian cinema on the map of the vital world cinemas. They brought self-respect and prestige for Iranians at home and abroad. The displacement, dispersion, and exile of a massive number of Iranians, many in the visual and performing arts and cinema and television, resulted in new formations in Iran’s social history and cinematic history—a diasporic formation of people with a complex subjectivity and an “accented cinema,” made by first-generation émigrés and their second- and third-­generation descendants. Both the wide circulation of Iran-made films and those Iranians made in the diaspora, as well as the vast diasporic dispersion of Iranians, helped globalize Iranian cinema. Each of these developments is discussed in its own chapter.\n\norg a n izatio n o f the vo lumes\n\nxxv\n\na wor d a bou t il lus t r at ions\n\nI\n\nhave used several types of illustration here, each providing supplementary or complementary material to the text. Production stills show something of the behind-the-scenes process. Frame enlargements, taken directly from films or videos, offer visuals for textual analyses of the films’ aesthetic and generic systems. Posters offer not only an encapsulated rendition of the film by artists other than filmmakers but also showcase the art of poster design and production, which form important components of the movies’ publicity, exhibition, and reception. Like the movies themselves, this art also evolved over time, an evolution discernable in the posters included in the present volumes. Cartoons and other material objects about cinema demonstrate the wider circulation of things filmic among Iranians. The flyers announcing film screenings and cultural and political events featuring screenings served as important vehicles in exile for advertising, political agitprop, and film exhibition immediately after the 1978–79 revolution. They provide a good sense of the films, of the political culture of the time, and of the sponsoring groups. Finally, the many tables in the book offer other forms of data for the analysis of the films’ cultural contexts, such as audience demography, production output, film export and import, organizations involved in production, and the regulations concerning censorship and banning of movies. Because of the diversity of sources and the deterioration of some films and videos, the quality of the pictorial illustrations varies.\n\npr eface How It All Began\n\nH\n\nistory is written by individuals who have their own personal and intellectual histories and perspectives. This preface is a history of my engagement with the subject of Iranian cinema and its place in the world. It is not my autobiography or my family’s history, but a cultural autobiography about my contentious love affair—and that of other Iranians—with cinema, Iran, and the West. As such it offers a microcosmic perspective on Iranian culture and society during the second Pahlavi period and its transition to the Islamic Republic. I watched Western movies, made films, and taught and wrote about cinema. My affair with cinema began early with a fascination with photography and translations of Western novels, adapted to the screen. Like all love affairs it had moments of disillusionment, misunderstanding, hostility, and betrayal.\n\nTaking Photographs I was born in the historic and magnificent city of Isfahan, and I roamed the place with my father’s Kodak Brownie box camera. I remember the small color image of the viewfinder and its sharp contrast with the resultant blackand-white photos. That image was as vivid as a dream, like the single 35mm color frames of American movies, which I used to purchase from street hawkers in my hometown. I acquired my own camera as a gift from our neighbor, Heshmatollah\n\n­ ehesh on Jahan Nama Street, near Darvazeh Dowlat. He had three children: D The eldest, Keyvan, was blind. One fine, sunny, wintry day the haunting music coming from Dehesh’s household attracted me, and I went up to our rooftop to investigate. From there I could see Dehesh’s yard paved with brick, in the center of which sat a raised, oblong pool. Four garden plots separated the pool from the paved yard, and four thirsty tongues of the yard reached between those plots and rested on the side of the pool. It was a cold day, and the white mulberry trees in the garden were bare. To my amazement I observed that it was Keyvan who was playing this beautiful tune on his violin as he walked around the pool casting his shadow on the gently rippling water. Keyvan’s father took him to West Germany for treatment, where he stayed. His father returned, however, and brought me a present—a 35mm Agfa camera. I was thrilled and grateful. Five decades later, I am struck by this irony: gaining a second sight with the camera at the age of thirteen or fourteen thanks to a sightless boy. Using this camera I documented bicycle outings with my family and excursions with school friends to the countryside—Kuleh Parcheh, Abshar, Chiriun, Kuh Donbeh, Atashgah, and Bagh Abrisham. I felt lonely most of the time in those days, and taking pictures helped cement our relationships, as for weeks afterward we traded and copied photographs. In a fatalist society, pictures were proof of our existence, shoring us up against the vagaries of time and history. My current interest in documentation must have begun then. I assiduously took pictures of my two favorite subjects: the very young and the very old. I thought that children needed documentation to celebrate their arrival into the world (and besides, they were very cute), while the elders needed to prove their existence before departing into the netherworld. But I went beyond simply taking photographs, mostly in our new house on Jahan Nama Street, which since then has been torn down and rebuilt in honor of my father as “Doctor Naficy’s Clinic.” I asked the elder family members whose pictures I took to write some words of wisdom for me in an “advice notebook.” Following the custom of gender segregation, I had two notebooks: one for women and one for men. Looking over these books now, I see the Islamic, moralistic, and modernist ideologies of the authors shine through the variety of elegant handwritings (good penmanship was valued then), colors of ink, and length. (Uncle Alinaqi’s moralistic advice, for example, is thirty pages long and in green ink, while my dad’s advice, written in 1961, is ninety-seven pages in blue ink, ending with the French adage “La fonction fait l’organ,” form follows function.) xxx\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\nThe usual mise-en-scène of my family portraits is a single individual in the center, standing near a tree in our backyard, or seated on a sun-drenched balcony. Expressions in these medium shots are generally serious, composed, and the subjects are looking directly, sometimes with a hint of a smile, at me behind the camera. This aesthetics of portraiture somehow migrated into the hundreds of freehand drawings that I have made over the years of public intellectuals and cultural critics (figures 1–12). The modernist belief in individuals’ uniqueness, subjectivity, and agency informing this aesthetic is also inscribed in the portraits of filmmakers strewn throughout the book.\n\nFigures 1–12 Author’s freehand portrait drawings, 1980s–1990s.

It is true that I was mahram (related) and thus halal (permitted) to them, and they did not have to wear the veil for me, but the technicians who developed the pictures in the photo shops were not.1 I resolved this dilemma by taking candid shots without veils or taking posed photos with veils. Clearly, technology was intruding into the gendered domestic space: it was making the sacred profane and the private public.\n\nBuilding a Film Projector Chaharbagh Avenue was Isfahan’s Champs-Élysées: ancient, beautiful, soulful, and lined with tall sycamores and modern shops, including most of the city’s movie houses. Street vendors there sold short strips of movies, single movie frames, movie posters, printed lyrics of pop songs, lottery tickets, cigarettes, and candy. The film frames I bought there as a young boy typically showed Tarzan or handsome and beautiful movie stars. At night, I would go to one of the unoccupied rooms in our huge three-story house, shine a little black flashlight onto each frame, and watch the projected color images on the wall. I also found other creative uses for these film frames: Sometimes I folded a frame over itself so that when pressed on one side it produced a loud click. In a small way I had appropriated a Western commodity as raw material to make a native product, reversing the usual economic relationship. I enjoyed squeezing my clicker over and over to annoy my mother, who would shoo me away. A little later, I built a wooden light-box with a window in its top. Inside, I placed a light bulb, a reflector, and a roll of cartoon images, which I had cut out and pasted together from the children’s magazine Kayhan-e Bacheh­ha (Children’s Kayhan), the subscription to which I had won in a contest. By cranking the handles on the outside of the box, I could view the cartoon strip as it passed in front of the window. I added a lens to the window and was able to project the cartoon images on the wall (ignoring the reversed writing), creating my first film show for my family. In an entrepreneurial move, I think I even charged them admission. I continued to improve the system. Since the children’s magazine was a monthly, I soon ran out of cartoons, and my uncles and I had to draw by hand our own cartoon strips for the primitive projector. I still remember the exuberant comments and the oohs and aahs of the family audience during these shows. My uncles Reza and Hosain Nafisi, who also built a hand-cranked cartoon projector in the mid-1950s, solved the problem of the reversed projection of the alphabets by reading the dialogue aloud to the ho w it all began\n\nxxxv\n\nspectators like curtain reciters and movie-house translators, discussed extensively here (Naficy 2007b). The filmmaker Asadollah Niknejad, who emigrated to the United States, told me that he had been fascinated with the idea of building a projector in his youth and, indeed, had manufactured a 35mm model, which he said still works. He showed me a picture of himself as a young boy with it. My distant cousin, Alireza, who later became a physician and married my sister Nasrin, built a rather elaborate 35mm film projector with his friend Homayun Shahriari when they were in high school (figure 13). As he told me in a telephone interview from Isfahan, building the projector was a summer project, which the two friends embarked on for several reasons germane to Iranian film history: going to the movies involved frustrating interruptions in the 1950s, as the screenings in commercial cinemas were frequently cut and even cancelled because of loss of electricity. The spectators could reenter the cinemas later when electricity was restored by showing their ticket stubs. “To see a movie in full,” said Alireza Naficy, “sometimes, we would have to return to the movie house several times, a very frustrating experience” (Naficy 2006c). In addition, moviegoing was a morally corrupting and physically dangerous experience, as sexual predators preyed on their young victims inside and outside these establishments. Seeing the movies at home, therefore, was an attractive and safe alternative; yet few people could afford the cost of purchasing portable projectors and renting movies. This made constructing homemade movie projectors both a viable and a challenging solution, particularly for scientific and modern-minded youths.\n\n13 Building a 35mm film projector. My cousin, Alireza Naficy, eighteen years old (left), and his classmate, Homayun Shahriari (right), with the 35mm projector they built in 1955 in the backyard of Shahriai’s house in Isfahan. Still courtesy of Alireza Naficy\n\nxxxvi\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\nElectrical service stoppages were not the only source of movie interruption. Because of inferior projectors and old “junk” film prints, discussed in these pages, movies often broke during projection, causing projectionists to cut off strips of films when resplicing. The availability of these film strips, which the street vendors sold by the meter or frame on Chaharbagh Avenue in Isfahan and in other major cities, was an enticement to young modernists and inventors. Likewise, Point Four film projectionists of the United States Information Agency (usia), who drove into schools and other public places in their mobile film units and showed films on their portable 16mm projectors, provided an up-close model of a projector for interested youths. Yet much creativity and perseverance was needed to build a homemade projector, given the limited technical knowledge, equipment, and resources. “To begin with,” Alireza Naficy told me, “to build our projector we copied the pictures of a film projector we had seen in a magazine, as well as the actual Point Four projectors we had seen. We had no real blueprint for it. It was all based on visual cognition.” Like the pioneers of cinema, they built their equipment in an artisanal fashion with whatever was available or adaptable. The projector’s body was made with planks of wood obtained from crates. For the lens, they adapted an ordinary magnifier, which they installed inside a tube; for the claw mechanism that pulled the film using sprocket holes, they drove nails into a wooden spool they obtained from a textile mill; for the motor to drive the projector, they cannibalized an electric fan they had purchased for the purpose; and for the belt connecting the motor to the claw mechanism, they waxed some twine. After all this, they discovered their projector’s Achilles’ heel: they needed a shutter and an intermittent movement mechanism to hold each frame still for a fraction of a second in front of the lens. This proved an insurmountable ordeal and, anyway, by then the summer vacation had ended, and Shahriari’s parents wanted some results for their investment. Most early cinema pioneers in Iran suffered such constraints and impediments and invented their own artisanal, ad hoc solutions. The two entrepreneurs, Alireza and Homayun, were forced to stage not a film performance but a slideshow, so to speak, as they projected each frame of the filmstrips they had bought, one frame at a time. They invited a large group of spectators, consisting of Shahriari’s extended family members from the small town of Najafabad nearby. “They loved what they saw. Most of them were villagers, and they seemed to be more fascinated by the technology of projection than by the images themselves—the projector’s turning reels, its noise, its light—as though the machine was magically materializing the images by itself.” ho w it all began\n\nxxxvii\n\nThat building a film projector formed part of a larger techno-scientific modernization is borne out by the vials of chemicals on the table in front of their projector in figure 13, where the two budding scientists are pouring some chemical into a container with an eyedropper (Shahriari would later become an electronics engineer and Naficy a virologist). The map of Iran tacked to the wall indexes the national aspiration associated with modernity. Around the same time, following the instructions and diagrams in ­Kayhan-e Bachehha, I built with great expectations a radio set that required an earphone for listening. I scoured Isfahan’s electrical shops, but the more I sought the less I found. The only thing I came up with was an old headset from the Second World War, which did not work. Crushed, I gave up that project, still tasting the disappointment half a century later. Taking photographs, building a projector for paper film rolls, and making an amateur radio were precursors to building a film projector, which seemed to be both a dream and a challenge for many enterprising and modernist young boys. The difficulties of these projects pointed to the underdevelopment of technical knowledge and infrastructure in Iran that dogged not only the amateur world but also the field of professional film, keeping it an artisanal cottage industry for decades.\n\nWatching Literature-Based Movies The relationship between modernist and Western literature and cinema was reciprocal, for viewing the adaptations validated both the original novel and the experience of the cinema. They both vividly represented the Western Other with whom I had to come to terms. I spent the summer of 1960 reading all the great novels that I could get my hands on. I read more than thirty of them and saw many film adaptations. Yul Brynner and Maria Schell brought to life the tumultuous but difficult text of Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Kara­ mazov (1958) in Richard Brooks’s screen adaptation. Impressed, after the film I noted in a letter to my uncle Reza, dated 28 Farvardin 1339 (17 April 1960), “The performances were magnificent.” On a warm May night, I took my Agfa camera to Mayak Cinema, which was showing Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace (1956), directed by King Vidor. I wanted to take color slides of the film. Unsure of how the ushers and spectators would react, I hid the camera under my jacket. During close-ups of Pierre and Natasha (Henry Fonda and Audrey Hepburn), I discreetly took timed pictures, holding my breath to steady my hands. Captivated by the great novel, I xxxviii\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\nhad spent weeks reading and annotating it—noting in my diary, with a combination of awe and arrogance, “the breadth and the style of the book is utterly amazing. I am trying to understand it as fully as possible because it is worth it” (22 Ordibehesht 1339 / 12 May 1960). Holding the color slides of Hepburn’s enchanting face to the light felt like holding a piece of a dream, a condensed image of Russia and America. At night, I sometimes put myself to sleep by going over the scenes of recent movies. That night, after returning home from War and Peace, as I was falling asleep I recalled scenes from Les Misérables (1956), directed by Jean-Paul Le Chanois, based on Victor Hugo’s novel, and starring the great Jean Gabin. I wrote my uncle Reza about this film and collected newspaper accounts of it. Two summers earlier I had been with my family in Khunsar, a cool, mountainous region, reading Les Misérables during long afternoons. Everyone took a one- or two-hour nap. All was silent but for the quiet murmuring of the brook nearby. I would lie down on my back and voraciously consume the Hugo tale, often crying at the trials of Cozette, Marius, and Jean Valjean. I filled half a notebook with quotations from the book. The memories of reading the novels and watching their movie adaptations affected my dreaming. During waking hours, these filmic recollections enlivened my otherwise drab and lonely existence. I noted in my diary, “In my life these memories and dreams are all that I have to be satisfied with” (22 Ordibehesht 1339 / 12 May 1960). I was being hailed by the world the foreign dream factories were offering. The Russian film that affected me the most was Mikhail Kalatozov’s romantic war movie, The Cranes Are Flying (1957). The heroism of the Russian people and the lost romance of the protagonists moved me, infatuated as I was at the time with leftist politics and classic Russian novels. The film’s war scenes and the haunting face of the lead actress, Tatyana Samoilova, remained forever etched on my mind. Now, more than a half a century later, reading over the plot summary from my diary of that year, I am struck by the image of the cranes flying in the sky, cranes Tatyana watched to remember her lost love, Boris, killed in the war. When I remember that image now, I am reminded of my own loss—my country, lost to exile. Such is the power of symmetry, of cinematic memory.\n\nCreating a Private Family Republic of Letters Of course, I read more than just the literature that had been turned into movies. In fact, the literature that attracted me increasingly as I entered high ho w it all began\n\nxxxix\n\n14 In a dandy move, the author wearing a “Duglasi mustache” and coiffed hair strikes a movie-star pose. Collection of the author\n\nschool was socially conscious novels and leftist social criticism, many of which were either officially or unofficially banned. Jack London’s The Iron Heel, John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, Maxim Gorky’s The Lower Depths, all in Persian translation, and Jalal Al-e Ahmad’s Gharbzadegi (Westernstruckness) were among these, which I borrowed from a friend, Naser Motii, the Sa’di High School librarian (these banned books were not supposed to circulate), bought under the table from a sympathetic bookseller, or exchanged secretly with friends in alleys. These simple acts of reading turned us into criminals. We played flâneur on Chaharbagh Avenue or along the Zayandeh River’s breezy boulevards, visiting bookshops and hanging out at cafés, all the while discussing politics and literature. Some of us dressed as Westernized dandies ( fokoli) and were photographed in movie star poses (figure 14). Having been raised in a devout but enlightened and open-minded Muslim family (followers of the progressive Sheikhi school of Shiism), we saw no contradiction between participating in Shiite sermons and passion plays (taziyeh) or between reading Russian and Soviet literature about peasants and workers and sporting Western fashions and going to Western movies. We were becoming modern through our personal syncretism, much as the nation was becoming modern through state-sanctioned syncretic Westernization. A key source of intellectual nourishment was my Naficy/Okhovat paternal and maternal family culture and its institutions.2 Although not explicitly oppositional politically, these men and women served to create an alternate universe, a familial republic of letters, for the children, which made us indexl\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\n15 My contribution at age fourteen to the Neda-ye Elm family magazine (vol. 3, no. 63, 30 Shahrivar 1337/21 September 1958), is a curious article on “metaposcopy,” which analyzes the relationship of the placement of moles on a human face to the owner’s character and destiny. Collection of the author\n\npendent from both mainstream politics and Shiite religion and helped both nurture us intellectually and emotionally and protect us morally and politically from the society at large. And the family was large enough to be self-sufficient socially and culturally. The culture it produced consisted of a three-thousandvolume children’s lending library, handwritten magazines composed and illustrated by children, and plays and art exhibitions that children organized. We named the library Ibn Sina Library in honor of the great Persian physician and scientist Ali Abu Sina (980–1037), known in the West as Avicenna. One of our family magazines was Neda-ye Elm (Call of Science), to which I contributed (figure 15). This republic of letters was an inchoate civil society institution of the type considered necessary for ushering in modernity, one rooted both in traditional kinship and in modern individualist structures. Such informal familial institution building formed a mode of resistance in the face of oppression from both the state and the tradition. And it foreshadowed the “cinematic family mode of production” that emerged later, particularly during ho w it all began\n\nxli\n\nthe Islamic Republic period. This modernist republic also involved engaging in what Foucault called “technologies of the self,” a set of practices by which subjects monitor and constitute themselves discursively (1988). Most family members kept journals, composed poetry, wrote letters of which they kept copies, and penned short stories. By so doing they reflected on themselves and constructed their position in the world. Although these compositions were private, on many occasions the writers read excerpts or the full texts of these works to family members. In this manner modern subjectivity and individuality were shaped and regulated in the fields of power—­vis-à-vis family, state, and society. As I entered high school, the family circle proved insufficient. In the late 1950s, I branched out by joining the Saeb Literary Society in Isfahan, which in those days witnessed the rise of leftist and modernist intellectuals, like me, against the old-fashioned traditionalist members. Literary societies are important civil institutions with deep roots in modern Iranian history. Most were oppositional and spurred modernist literature and art. Saeb society members attended meetings in a room in the garden of the tomb of the famed poet Saeb Isfahani and went to the countryside to read and interpret modern poetry and literary works all day, with breaks for lunch, play, and literary gossip. Older members like Jalil Doostkhah and Hushang Golshiri took the lead and mentored the younger ones. Some of the Saeb members and their allies later created another literary circle, which published the Jong-e Isfahan literary magazine, whose members became well-known writers, novelists, poets, scholars, translators, and screen writers on the national scene and still later, in the diaspora, created influential literary, cultural, and cinematic societies, periodicals, and venues.3 In one of the society’s public night sessions, I read a polemical rant against a famous traditional town poet (I think it was Shakib-e Isfahani) all the while trembling with fear of being arrested by the Savak (secret police). Some members used the cover of the literary society for antigovernment political activities, meeting with friends in each others’ homes, which in 1961 led to the arrest of the Group of 92 Teachers (Goruh-e 92 Moallem), charged with being Communist or Tudeh Party members. The arrest of the group dissolved the Saeb Literary Society. Had I not gone abroad for higher education I might have been arrested as well. As we entered the 1960s, the fear of secret police surveillance, even for harmless intellectual pursuits, became pervasive, making our social life oppressive, pushing us back into less public gatherings, trusted family circles, or exile. Our anxieties found wide currency in modernist poetry and were inscribed graphically in the dissident new-wave films of the 1960s and 1970s. xlii\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\nGoing to the Movies and Religious Sermons in Isfahan While engaged in these cultural and literary endeavors, I also attended the movies with a different set of friends and family members. My first recollection of watching films dates back to the early 1950s when I was younger than eight. I remember being extremely anxious watching a particular scene involving voyeurism through a high window, the specifics of which I do not now recall. All I remember is intense emotion, anxiety, and suspense. I clutched my father for safety. My uncle Reza, who is only a few years older than me, also remembers that at ten, while watching Tarzan, he felt extremely frightened of the possibility of the lions charging and devouring him (Naficy 1986). As far as the movie house itself is concerned, my first recollection is of a long, narrow, place almost resembling a tunnel, with a high ceiling, filled with people, smoke, and noise. This was a modest commercial cinema that, I think, was called Metropole Cinema, located near our house on Lower Chaharbagh Avenue (it later became a shopping plaza). Before a film began and during intermissions, amid the clamor of the young male spectators (I do not remember any women), a voice could be heard above the general hubbub, calling: “Coca, Fanta, cigarettes, nuts, snacks.” It came from a young, disheveled boy carrying a wooden tray hung from his neck. On it he carried bottles of soft drinks (recently introduced in Iran), lemonade, cigarettes, and ajil— an assortment of lightly salted watermelon, melon, and pumpkin seeds and nuts. Spectators talked to the screen, commenting on the action or addressing the characters. As my uncle Reza recalled, when Tarzan was screened, every few minutes a Persian-language intertitle interrupted the film, and literate spectators read the titles out loud for the benefit of those who could not read (Naficy 2007b). Despite the advent of sound, spectators continued to talk back. They would not hesitate to tell the actors what they should do next: “Oh, watch out, he is behind you,” “Yeah, punch him hard, in the stomach, hit him, hit him!” During the screening of Cecil B. DeMille’s Samson and Delilah (1949), when Victor Mature as Samson stood in the doorway to push the pillars apart and destroy the temple, the spectators urged him on and applauded him wildly. I still remember the outstretched arms waving in the eerie, blue light of the projector in the smoke-filled hall. In the early decades, since most cinemas had only one film projector, a movie was never shown in its entirety without several intermissions, needed to change the reels. During the first intermission, spectators would noisily migrate from row to row to sit near their friends or in better seats. In the ho w it all began\n\nxliii\n\nmovie houses that allowed women, these were separated from the men by a curtain or a divider erected in the middle. Even lacking an official barrier, women usually sat on one side and men on the other. Both the religious and some secular elites opposed moviegoing on religious and moral grounds. The penalty for intransigence varied. For example, in 1951, my then teenage uncles Reza and Hosain, who were under the guardianship of their older brother Karim, received beatings from him for going to the movies. I remember Karim punishing Hosain on an otherwise beautiful autumn afternoon under the grape arbor of my paternal grandmother’s house. He was lashing Hosain with a long, lean branch of the plum tree, which he had earlier soaked in the yard pool. Reza, too, says that one night returning home late from a movie, he and Hosain felt a shadow move among the trees outside their home. They were spooked until they heard a hesitant voice asking if it was them (their neighborhood, Pa Qal’eh, had no electricity yet). They immediately recognized the voice of their brother, who was lurking in the shadows with his limber switch in hand. It was too late for a beating that night, but its inevitability made them toss and turn all night. The next day, they received their due punishment. To avoid these violent episodes, Hosain often lied about his whereabouts, sometimes stating he had been to a religious sermon (rowzeh) instead of the movies. As will be seen in these pages, movies and mosque did not always stand in opposition to each other, as many functional parallels existed between them, something both traditionalists and modernists exploited. Even my father, who was a modernist Muslim physician and liberal in his attitudes toward modernity and Western institutions (he wore a bowtie in his youth and received his heart specialization from Harvard), distrusted cinema enough in the 1950s to hesitate permitting me to enroll in an Isfahan cinema club, which primarily showed foreign movies. He worried not about cinema as such, for he used to take me to the movies himself; rather, he worried about what transpired at public movie houses: pederast males were said to stalk their young prey and prostitutes to trade their wares. I was perhaps fifteen years old then, and when he finally acquiesced to my attending the club screenings by myself, he would later ask me to describe to him both the movie plots and the lessons I had learned from them.4 My mother, who is more religious and had abandoned her education after completing elementary school due to Reza Shah’s forced unveiling, had never seen a movie until I was able to persuade her to go with me to DeMille’s biblical yarn The Ten Commandments (1956). She agreed to see her first movie precisely because it was about a religious story, showing the complex relationxliv\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\nship of religious people with cinema. Hailed by the movies myself, I, in turn, completed the interpellative chain and hailed my mother. The safety derived from anonymity turned the movie houses into sites both for resisting the state’s official politics, such as refusing to stand up for the national anthem film containing images of the Shah, and for violating cultural and religious taboos against moviegoing. Young people not permitted to walk the streets together or to meet openly in cafés found the cinemas conducive to experiencing charged moments of privacy, intimacy, and eroticism. No kissing or even petting was necessary to make the movie house electrifying: mere privacy, anonymity, and holding hands were sufficient. I remember watching in rapture Elia Kazan’s Splendor in the Grass (1961) with my girlfriend Zhina in the Moulin Rouge Cinema in the Armenian district of Jolfa. The resonance between the love that Warren Beatty’s and Natalie Wood’s characters felt and the passion that Zhina and I had was gripping. As a child, I attended not only movies but also rowzeh, often with my parents, where we sat on carpets on our haunches in gender-segregated groups for hours, listening to sermons and lamentations, watching the chest-­beating, forehead- and thigh-slapping, and weeping of adults. Family members attended a weekly rotating reading circle in which they read and interpreted key Sheikhi religious texts. An old preacher, Molla Jafar, visited our home weekly to deliver a short private sermon. In addition, I also attended intensely dramatic Shiite performances, such as taziyeh passion plays and Muharram processions, where throngs of young boys and men beat their chests, daubed mud over their heads, flagellated their backs with chains, or cut their heads with knives, blood streaming down their faces and chests, reddening the white shroud of martyrdom they wore—all designed to demonstrate their complete identification with, and love for, the Shiite martyrs. Curtain reciters (pardeh khan) interpreted religious or heroic paintings on large canvas curtains, particularly in Isfahan’s ancient Takht-e Pulad Cemetery, where I stood among crowds of men and boys to watch them work their magic.\n\nViewing usia Films at Nemuneh Elementary School I watched politically motivated American nonfiction films as well as Holly­ wood products. The former were part of the U.S. government’s anticommunist Cold War project, extensively discussed in the present book. As an ele­mentary school student in an experimental “model school” (Dabestan-e Nemuneh), planned and funded by the Point 4 Program of the United States ho w it all began\n\nxlv\n\nInformation Agency (usia), I was exposed to many of these films on a regular basis. Every Thursday afternoon (the day before the weekend), a green mobile film unit—a Jeep station wagon—would drive into our schoolyard. A young Iranian wearing a gray suit and tie, the driver who doubled as the projectionist, would emerge to set up his portable screen and 16mm Bell & Howell projector in our assembly hall. Powered by the generator inside the Jeep, the ­projector opened a new world to us (and to the Sa’di High School next door). As an American-funded institution, my elementary school had many modern and democratic amenities, including an open-stack library and a student-run, wall-mounted newspaper, which my classmate Ahmad Baizavi illustrated. It also took films seriously enough for our teacher to require us to review them in writing. All these student-centered activities were modernist and revolutionary for us in the stilted and authoritarian educational system of 1950s Iran, in the same way that the mere screening of films at Aqdassieh School half a century earlier, described in this book, had been revolutionary to Mohammad Ali Djamalzadeh in the 1900s. I still have a notebook of sixteen of my 1953–54 reviews, written in the third grade (at age nine). The films were mostly shot in Iran by the Syracuse Team that the usia had assembled and dealt with improving health, hygiene, and agricultural practices. A few films about American practices had been filmed in the United States. With one exception, all were documentaries.5 My reviews indicate that each film about Iran concerned a specific problem, such as tuberculosis or dysentery, which was demonstrably manageable and curable. A disease temporarily disturbed the world of a village or a family, but soon stability and calm were restored by, for instance, Western-trained doctors with downright positivist names, such as Doctor Optimist (Khoshbin) and Doctor Good Omen (Khoshqadam).6 Each of my reviews begins with a title closely resembling the actual film title and ends with a large “The End” (payan). The teacher’s brief comments appear at the bottom of a few of my reviews, in fact strict plot summaries (figure 16). The absence of personal opinion on my part may be interpreted in different ways: I was a child, too inexperienced and shy to express critical judgment about movies in writing; or I was applying a subconscious strategy of resistance, a refusal to make the 180-degree interpellative turn to become the subject of the Western Other. In Jean Baudrillard’s words, this was a form of “refusal by over-acceptance” (1985:588). Yet my friends and I loved American fiction movies and fetishized their stars, imitated their style, and took delight in mimicking their names with exaggerated flourish. In addition, we regarded the movie houses as both symxlvi\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\n16: Author’s early film criticism.

The page on the right shows the end of one review, marked by “the end” in large letters like the ending credit of Iranian movies, next to the teacher’s comment “Good.” The left page shows my review of the film Cleanliness Results in Health (Pakizegi Mojeb-e Tandorosti Ast).\n\nbols and indexes of modernization and as sites for secular conversion, rivaling the mosque. As an oppositional teenager, I lauded the weakening of all centralized authorities, be it the state, the party, or the mosque. In letters to friends and relatives I announced with pride the openings of new movie houses in Isfahan. A letter to my uncle Reza, dated 11 Bahman 1339 (31 Janu­ ary 1961), notes: “Recently a new movie house has opened in Jolfa. Called Moulin Rouge Cinema, it is better and more luxurious than the other cinemas in Isfahan. It is showing Richard Fleischer’s 20,000 Leagues under the Sea (1954) for its opening night fare.” I continued, “There is also another one under construction, Asia Cinema, which has a small hall, but it is very nice, and finally there is a third one near the Zayandeh River, Sahel Cinema, which is to be a three-story movie palace, more luxurious than Tehran theaters.” ho w it all began\n\nxlvii\n\nOf course, not everyone considered movie houses sites of secular modernity; many thought them dens of moral iniquity, state indoctrination, and Western domination. These sentiments would fester and come to a boil several decades later, resulting in the widespread destruction of the movie houses during the 1978–79 revolution.\n\nMaking Films in the United States and in Iran My long-term relationship with the West, mediated at great length and long distance by means of photography, radio, literature, and film, finally became firsthand. After high school, I went to Lancaster, England, to continue my studies. Friday night cinemagoing in one of the town’s two movie houses provided me with a home away from home, helping me practice my English comprehension and heal the epistemic violence and loneliness of my exile (Naficy 2003). Basil Dearden’s gripping movie The Mind Benders (1962), starring Dirk Bogarde, became a metaphor of my life as a foreigner. Here I was, an eighteen-year-old boy who had never flown in an airplane and had never ventured out of my country alone. Now, in a single stroke I was severed from the warmth of family and country and planted abroad—a single, solitary seedling, adrift in a foreign land, surrounded by a reserved people and an unfamiliar language and culture. The experience of it all numbed me, much as it did the film’s protagonist, Dr. Henry Longman, a scientist who undergoes experiments in a water tank to determine the effects of total isolation on his psyche. The absence of input makes him vulnerable to indoctrination and psychosis. I considered the film significant enough to write about it in my journal (dated 5 May 1963), ending my entry with this question: “Is it possible for humans to tolerate total isolation?” Soon, I moved to the United States to begin my formal studies in film and television. Barely a month after arriving in Los Angeles, a sense of desolation and rage took me over, pushing me toward Stephen Crane’s horrific poetry and Jean-Paul Sartre’s humanist and existentialist philosophy. I copied many of Crane’s poems and passages from Sartre’s Nausea in my journal. On 26 April 1964, for example, I filled an entire page with the word nausea, repeated over and over, in a fashion chillingly reminiscent of Jack Torrance’s possessed writing of pages of “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” in Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining (1980). Last night, reading over these diary pages for the first time in many years, the hair rose on the back of my neck. And tonight, while screening the film to students in my film authorship seminar, I xlviii\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\nrealized the similarity between my exilic panic then, in my dorm room in the University of Southern California’s (usc) Trojan Hall, and Jack’s unhinging in the isolation of the Overlook Hotel in the movie. At the time, I began to take photographs to stem the tide of exilic torrents. Indeed, photography became a way of fixing, knowing, and objectifying both the Western Other and myself. Uncannily echoing the infatuation with an all-seeing camera that Dziga Vertov had theorized in the 1920s (before I had read him), I wrote in my diary on 8 February 1964: “My body takes pictures of the outside world. Each inch of my body has become a camera to absorb the world. I work with all my seven, eight, ten senses!” Up to this point, I had been a consumer of the movies—with the exception of my childhood experiments with the primitive cartoon-strip projector. After graduating from usc and entering ucla’s mfa program in film and television production I began to study and make films professionally. The self-othering trajectory, begun long ago with photography and film spectatorship in Iran, was now being reversed from a position of exile. The distance that had once separated me from the diegetic world of the United States and that had made that world all the more alluring dissolved with my transplantation to Los Angeles. The “elsewhere” was now “here.” Me, myself, I, he—all of me—were now here in the West at once, with no media-created distance separating us. But unity, wholeness, and ease proved elusive because of the ruptures of exile and modernity—and, besides, a switch was taking place. Another elsewhere, another Other, was now looming large, making me ill at ease again. I am speaking of home, against which I had begun to define myself anew. With one exception, all the films and videos I made at ucla were psychological, surreal, abstract, and dystopic, expressing the various anxieties, disruptions, and displacements of modernity and exile I was experiencing— and was later to theorize. Blacktop (1970) is an abstract eight-minute video in which the sounds of my emphatic footsteps walking on a sidewalk and a car engine trying to start up accompany the images, which consist of a variety of abstract images (figure 17). The film ends when the footsteps stop, a car door slams, and the image cuts from abstract visuals to a desolate reddish-brown cityscape (in fact an extreme close-up of the inside of a rotting tree trunk). Piano Player (1969) is a surrealistic dramedy based on a Donald Barthelme short story about a couple’s postmodern angst, in which my housemate from the Ellis Island Commune, Kendra Lince, starred (wearing football shoulder pads and a cast for a real-life broken arm). To intensify the alienating effect, I incorporated one of Franz Kafka’s parables into Barthelme’s tale. REM (Rapid Eye Movement, 1969) is an original surreal video largely conceived while ho w it all began\n\nxlix\n\ndreaming: A young man and woman are on a quest in a desolate land (resembling Iran). The paucity of their relationship reflects the futility of this quest. Dialogue during the thirty-minute video consists only of the appropriately inflected repetition of a single word, toilet, which at one point builds into a staccato symphony. In one scene, the pair is on all fours in tattered clothing, circling each other like two beasts and viciously barking out the two-­syllable word at each other. At the film’s end, in a self-reflexive scene, the young man in a dry creek-bed finds a small black-and-white television set, which is showing an image of him discovering the set. The image on the tv shows a whole brain placed outside a skull on a table. A hand (my own) reaches into the frame and proceeds to mash and knead the brain like dough. Whatever the impetus—and interpretations—for these dissociative images, cinematic othering and selfing would become a major academic concern of mine in the years to come (Naficy 2000b). The exception was Ellis Island (1969), a video documentary I made with the newly released Sony Porta Pack video camera—perhaps one of the first such documentaries. It focused on the commune named in the film’s title in which I lived for several years with other radical hippies, counterculture students, foreign students, artists, musicians, and members of the Students for a Democratic Society (sds). The video documented a moment of crisis in the life of the commune: the candid disillusionment of many members with their collective life.7 In my mfa thesis project, Salamander Syncope (1971), I pushed the abstraction and experimentation further to produce a twenty-four-minute animated video about the origin of life on “spaceship earth,” whose images and four-channel soundtrack were computer-generated in the days when digital computers primarily served as accounting and mathematical tools and analogue computers were used for television commercials (figures 18 and 19). 8\n\n17 Frame enlargement from my abstract video, Blacktop\n\nl\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\nAs I noted in the abstract of my ucla thesis, the purpose of the project was to “explore the capabilities of computer and videotape technologies as tools for generating visual designs, and to develop proper techniques and methodologies by which the fusion of these two media can best be controlled and directed toward the expression of a specific notion, i.e., the invocation of molecular memory.” What was being remembered, it seems, was a rebirth, my rebirth as a new subject in exile.\n\n18 Frame enlargement of my computer-video generated mfa film, Salamander Syncope 19 A poster for the first public screening of Salamander Syncope at ucla. Collection of the author\n\nho w it all began\n\nli\n\nAfter obtaining my master of fine art, I made films and programs for Theta Cable television (later Group w tv) in Los Angeles (1972–73), for the Free University of Iran (1973–78), and for ucla’s Instructional Media Services (1980– 85). These sensitized me to the processes of funding, preproduction, production, postproduction, exhibition, and broadcast of films and television and their impact on society and on what ends up on the screen. They affected my research methodologies and scholarship, including those for this book, as I conducted many interviews with filmmakers and industry people about their biographies, production and exhibition practices, and the limitations and censorship of their works. I engaged in participant observation of filming and paid attention to the demography and ethnography of spectators and to their opinions. In the present book, films are not regarded as autonomous art objects or just commercial products but as works resulting from complex social, political, industrial, cultural, and authorial processes of signification, production, consumption, and negotiation that are individual and collective as well as national and transnational.\n\nDisintegration and the Reemergence of the Family Republic of Letters For several years in the 1970s, I returned to Iran to assist with creating the new multimedia Free University of Iran. As the director of its Broadcast and Media Center, I also served as the executive producer of a series of groundbreaking documentaries on what I called the country’s “indigenous technologies,” such as The Qanat Irrigation Tradition in Iran (Sonnat-e Qanat dar Iran, 1977) and The Pigeon Towers (Kabutarkhan, 1978). These were never broadcast, for the oncoming revolution disrupted everything. The private family republic of letters was gradually ravaged by the state, first under Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and then under the ayatollahs, resulting in the secret police’s arrest of scores of members, the execution of nearly a dozen, the imprisonment of many more, and the dispersal of many others to foreign lands. The political and ideological divisions within the family further exacerbated the actions of the repressive states. This politicization of the family intellectuals and cultural producers and the terrible toll it took was emblematic of the whole country. My much younger brother Said was arrested in 1973 along with my uncle Mohammad Naficy, the former editor of Call of Science, and my cousin Ali Naficy. They were tortured and imprisoned for two, four, and five years, respectively. When Said and others were arrested lii\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\nbecause of antigovernment activities, including the distribution of leaflets, my parents immediately threw their manual Olympia typewriter, which he may have used to write the leaflets, into a well in the yard that supplied the water to the pool. This was to avoid its discovery by the secret police, Savak, and marked the beginning of the family republic of culture’s dismantling. Soon, in another tragic but necessary step, the family broke up the Ibn Sina Library by dividing the books thematically among a half a dozen members’ homes and gardens, where they were dispersed in closets, backrooms, and basements. The final nail in the coffin of the library came when one night I and Nooshin, my youngest sister whose cute baby pictures I had taken only a few years before, fearing that the Ibn Sina patrons’ ledger may incriminate the family, wrapped it in layers of plastic for safekeeping and buried it deep under a plum tree in the yard in our Bagh Jennat house. The familial purge took private turns as well. I burned a suitcase full of letters that I had written to my parents during the many years I had spent abroad, brokenhearted at the loss. I even destroyed pages from my own diaries in which I had discussed the Saeb Society events and other politically sensitive issues or mentioned the names of leftist friends and relatives. In authoritarian societies the worst kind of censorship is the self-censorship that authors engage in to preempt official censorship.9 In the 1970s I visited my brother Said in the Qasr Prison in Tehran on many Thursday afternoons during official visiting hours, taking to him fruit, nuts, sweets, money, and clothes. Sometimes, I would coordinate my visits with those of my uncle Hasan Naficy and my cousin Jafar Naficy, who visited their respective brothers, Mohammad and Ali, in the same political prisoners’ ward. We were able then to see all three relatives together; in a bizarre ritual we shouted to them across the prison bars over the chaotic voices of a dozen other visitors meeting their relatives, exchanging information and pleasantries often in coded language. Their imprisonment caused trouble for their close relatives. One day, the chancellor of my university, Abdolrahim Ahmadi, a former leftist intellectual and a co-translator of Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath (with Shahrokh Meskoob), which had been banned years ago, called me into his office. He showed me a terse letter from the Savak addressed to him, forbidding my promotion within the university structure beyond middle management (I was at the time already occupying such a position as an associate professor and the director of the Broadcast and Media Center). He asked what I had done to deserve such special attention. I confided in him and told him for the first time of the arrests of my brother, uncle, and cousin. I also noted that I had boycotted all the mandatory meetings of the single Resurho w it all began\n\nliii\n\ngence (Rastakhiz) Party, which the Shah had created in the mid-1970s. He understood the situation, and we never discussed the matter again. It is ironic that such a warning against me was issued during the years in which university officers, myself included, were required to attend the annual official Noruz Salaam (New Year’s audience) before the Shah, where he shook hands with us and asked questions about our university’s progress. All three of our prisoners were released with the 1978–79 revolution, only to be executed, disappear, and go underground, respectively, during the early Islamic Republic era. I was on a yearlong sabbatical in the United States in 1978 when the revolution toppled the Pahlavi regime. Although at first we cele­brated the revolution for its emancipatory potential, soon the new Islamic regime’s theocratic and authoritarian intolerance and violence erased the gains. Some family members went into exile voluntarily; others illegally as refugees. Those who were abroad, like me, stayed put, forming an emerging diaspora. Tragically, during the reign of terror that followed, eleven family members were executed and many other lives and professions were derailed.10 Demonstrating the still patriarchal family structure in Iran, my three brothers and I went abroad for higher education, while my four sisters, married and with children, stayed home. Despite the centripetal forces at work, the family culture of resistance proved resilient. It survived by shape-shifting, evolving, and regenerating with each succeeding generation, thanks to my sisters and their offspring. In the thirty years since then, the third- and fourth-generation children have written and performed plays and put on art exhibitions and photographic shows in the family homes. An editorial board consisting of eight children produced a handwritten and illustrated monthly magazine, Science/Knowledge (Elm), which like its predecessor, Call of Science, had varied departments. However, as Nahal Naficy, one of the youngest members involved in the project, told me, these editors added a new, sophisticated feature: extensively researched special issues. One of these was devoted to Zoroastrianism, and its preparation involved a group field trip to the seat of the religion in Yazd to conduct interviews there and to study the sacred text, the Avesta. The production process also became more collective and more regularized than its predecessor’s, consisting of regular monthly or bimonthly editorial meetings at a member’s home, sleepovers, and group writing and illustrating sessions (Naficy 2007c). Soon the production process was modernized by using typewriters and computers and by introducing new graphic features. As did the Pahlavi-era generation’s magazines, the Islamic Republic period’s Science/Knowledge served as the catalyst for other family-centered cultural, educational, and artistic enliv\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\ngagements. An annual exhibition of the family’s arts and crafts was given at the end of summer 1985: a big affair to which the adults contributed not only their presence but also refreshments. “All this happened during the war with Iraq and political repression when the country was devastated,” said Nahal. “And this is how our family enriched itself and survived the trauma; but I also remember that there were a lot of concerns about our safety because we would be out during bombings, we would come home late, we risked being arrested by Komiteh (revolutionary committee), even though what we did never had political content; we were very careful about that” (Naficy 2007c). Two chief editors of Science/Knowledge, Nastaran and Vahid, became fast friends and later married. Everyone called them an “Elm couple,” referring to the Persian title of the magazine. With the graduation from high school of some of the activists in this family republic of letters, the production of the magazine gradually ground to a halt. Yet soon two new venues replaced it. One was the creation in 1991 of a nonprofit institution for the middle-aged and elderly, one of the first in the country. Called Rangin Kaman-e Sepid (White Rainbow), the institution transmogrified the informal family circle into a formal, registered civil society institution with its own offices and employees that catered to non-family members. The nucleus was the partial reconstitution of the Ibn Sina Library (its children’s sections), with additional cultural and performance projects, which catered to the needs of multiple generations, particularly the elders. The activities included putting on plays, publishing a monthly magazine called Sepidar (Aspen), and holding art classes, art exhibitions, yoga classes, and diary-writing classes. The institution not only provides artistic and creative outlets for its elderly members, such as my mother in her eighties who takes yoga and painting classes, but also links the generations by mixing youngsters with the elders in various activities, such as in storytelling programs. The other venue was the Internet blogs and Web pages, which are widely written and read by family members, particularly the third- and fourth-generation children. While Rangin Kaman-e Sepid expanded the circle to include others outside the family, the Internet transformed the actual face-to-face republic into a virtual global collectivity, which reaches far beyond the immediate family and the city of Isfahan to link nuclear and extended family members with others both inside the country and outside, in the global diaspora. Both institutions are indexes of the evolving globalization and modernity of Iranians, including the filmmakers discussed in these pages, something that propelled them beyond both kinship and nation.\n\nho w it all began\n\nlv\n\nThe Organization of Iranian Film Festivals and Their Politics Film festivals offer prime sites for intensified national and transnational trans­ lation and mistranslation, as well as for hailing (interpellation) and haggling (counterinterpellation) over identity and representation. I came to understand these relations intimately when in 1990, while writing my PhD dissertation on Iranian exile culture and television, I curated a festival of Iranian films in the United States at ucla (figure 20). A Decade of Iranian Cinema, 1980– 1990, featured more than twenty postrevolutionary films. During the decade under examination, the anti-Iranian politics and policies of the United States and the Islamic Republic’s hostility toward both the U.S. government and Iranian exiles had discouraged the importation of postrevolutionary films. This cinema was thus unavailable in the United States, even though Iranian films had begun to receive praise at international festivals elsewhere. The ucla event and the ensuing controversy helped change this situation. Some exiles—rightist and leftist media producers, journalists, filmmakers, and actors—alleged that the event would whitewash the Islamist government’s crimes and human rights violations. The filmmaker, theater direc-\n\n20 Cover of the catalogue for the A Decade of Iranian Cinema, 1980– 1990 film festival, ucla, MarchApril 1990. Collection of the author\n\nlvi\n\nho w i t al l b eg a n\n\ntor, and actor Parviz Sayyad was particularly vitriolic and relentless on the issue. For years he accused in person, in writing, and on his television shows the festival organizers of being the pro-government “cultural militia in exile” (Sayyad 1996:55) and “celebrators of fascism” (57). In the macabre fantasies of some exiles, the Islamic regime had given us a “Dracula kiss,” to use Nahal Naficy’s apt terminology (2009), and we had become its undead agents. Sayyad and more than a dozen well-known filmmakers and actors, in a public letter titled “No More ‘Cultural’ Iran-Contra,” called for a total boycott of this and other Iranian film festivals abroad.11 Seventeen of them protested outside ucla’s Melnitz Theater (Lo 1990). Other opposition groups (monarchists, the Young Iranian Movement, and Iran’s National Resistance Front) also joined the chorus of condemnations, some writing protest letters to the ucla chancellor. The anti–Islamic Republic exile media fanned the fire by creating a panic about an imminent takeover of Los Angeles by the Islamists. The Persian-language morning daily of Los Angeles, Sobh-e Iran (Iran’s Morning), edited by Naser Enqeta, printed a boycott call with the headline, “The Islamic Republic Film Festival in Los Angeles.” Quoting the boycott letter, it characterized the festival as a “cultural Iran-Contra affair,” referring to the Reagan-era “Iran-Contra Affair” during which the U.S. government had clandestinely supplied arms to Iran through Israel, giving this income to the “Contra” forces fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua (figure 21). Likewise, Parviz Qazisaid, the editor of Asr-e Emruz (This Evening), headlined his editorial, “Los Angeles under Siege by the Hezbollahis [supporters of the Party of God]” (figure 22). In addition to these newspapers, which ran daily articles during the ten-day festival, weekly periodicals, such as Javanan (The Youth), Ayandegan (The Future Times), and Iran News, as well as Radio ­Seda-ye Iran (Voice of Iran Radio), Radio Omid (Hope Radio), and various television programs such as Sayyad’s Parsian tv (Persian tv ), Ali Limonadi’s Iranian tv, Nader Rafii’s Midnight Show, and Manuchehr Bibian’s Jam-e Jam tv (Cup of Jamshid tv ), contributed to the debate by featuring antifestival speakers, and sometimes festival proponents. Several exile television producers, who openly supported the festival, were criticized by the opposing factions and embraced by others.12 Although largely one-sided, the media debate about the festival was healthy, as it opened up a space for Iranians to exercise their newly acquired democratic rights of free speech, expression, and assembly, and to hear diverse views on controversial cultural issues, such as the exchange of artistic and cinematic works with the homeland. However, the personal charges against me were very painful, as I knew most of the film industry boycotters ho w it all began\n\nlvii\n\n21 The Los Angeles Persian-language morning paper, Sobh-Emruz (This Morning) (30 March 1990), characterizes the ucla film festival as a “cultural Iran-Contra affair.” Collection of the author 22 The Los Angeles Persian-language evening paper, Asr-e Emruz (This Evening) (29 March 1990), declares that Los Angeles is “Under Siege by Iranian Hezbollah.” Collection of the author\n\npersonally and had even promoted their films at other ucla and Los Angeles events.

I felt betrayed by the critics and unfairly attacked. During the previous weeks, I had viewed some forty-four feature movies and a dozen short films from Iran and had selected twenty-five of them for the festival. In no way did the festival promote the regime. If anything, it celebrated Iranian filmmakers’ ability to make world-class films under stringent censorship and adverse conditions. We showcased the “old-timers” (veteran new-wave filmmakers who had begun their careers under the Pahlavi regime and had continued on successfully after its demise, such as Abbas Kiarostami, Bahram Baizai, Amir Naderi, Naser Taqvai, and Dariush Mehrjui) as well as the “newcomers” (artcinema filmmakers who had emerged under the Islamist regime, such as Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Rakhshan Banietemad, Said Ebrahimifar, and Abolfazl Jalili). For the first time, two films by a female director were screened. None of the films was supportive of the Islamist regime or of its politics; in fact, almost all of them were implicitly critical either of the prerevolutionary or the postrevolutionary societies.
