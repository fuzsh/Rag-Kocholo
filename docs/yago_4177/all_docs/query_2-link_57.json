        "text": "It's great to see that the BRIT Awards are committed to making the show more inclusive, responding proactively to last year’s feedback by taking concerted actions for 2024. Nice one Dr Jo Twist OBE (she/her) YolanDa Brown OBE DL and the BPI team. #BRITs The 60 / 40 gender split in favour of female artists for the nominees in the Artist of the Year category is one of the standout developments following last year’s controversy. Doubling the number of nominations for Artist of the Year, International Artist of the Year and introduction of R&B as its own genre award are also positive steps forward, together with greater transparency in setting out the makeup and demographics of the Voting Academy. Plus the selection of Youth Music funded partner Saffron Records as the 'Official Supported Non-Profit for 2024' for the BRIT Awards & Mercury Prize is brilliant to see. It’s important now to build on this positive momentum as there’s more to be done to ensure a creative, diverse, and inclusive music industry. For young people, it’s imperative they see people like them represented in the nominations, awards and wider music industries. From a wide range of backgrounds in terms of gender, ethnicity, disability and socioeconomic background. It’s about young people having role models representing them and their lives both on and off stage. It’s also great for creativity too. Greater diversity produces greater music. Artists from a range of backgrounds create songs and lyrics often expressing their own lived experiences, challenges and observations on society. This provides us with rich, thoughtful music from a multitude of voices, platforming the diversity and creativity of the UK. And it all starts at the grassroots, supporting young people at the earliest age to make, learn and then earn in music. This is the national ecosystem we support and invest in at Youth Music and we ask the music industries to do the same with us. This in turn will create the very pipeline of diverse creative talent that’s being called for. ⬇️⬇️"
