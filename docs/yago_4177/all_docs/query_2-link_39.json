        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIn the village of Rahau, Romania, villagers are confronted with the return of Nicolae Ceaușescu in the form of a hologram.\n\nDirector Biography\n\nMihai Grecu was born in Romania in 1981. After studying art and design in Romania and France, he has been pursuing his artistic research at the Fresnoy Studio of Contemporary Arts. Recurring topics such as environmental crysis, political allegories, new technologies and catastrophes articulate the whole of his exploration of mysterious and subconscious beginnings. These visual and poetic trips mix several techniques and may be seen as propositions for a new dream oriented technology."
