        "text": "The fair-skinned people who inhabit the Sudan fringes of west Africa stretching from the Senegal valley to the shores of Lake Chad and who speak the language known as Fulfulde, are known by many names.1 They call themselves Fulbe (singular, Pullo). They are called Fulani by the Hausa of southern Nigeria, and this name has been used for them throughout Nigeria. The British call them Ful, Fulani, or Fula, while the French refer to them as Peul, Peulh, or Poulah. In Senegal the French also inadvertently call them Toucouleur or Tukulor. The Kanuri of northern Nigeria call them Fulata or Felata. In this paper we will adopt the Hausa (or Nigerian) name for the people—Fulani.\n\nAccurate censuses are not available on the Fulani in west Africa. A mid-twentieth century estimate puts the total number of Fulani at “over 4 million,” more than half of whom are said to inhabit Nigeria. Another estimate towards the end of 1989 puts the total number of Nigeria's Fulani (nomads only) at over ten million. If both estimates were correct, then the Fulani population in Nigeria alone must have grown 500 per cent in forty years. The dominant factor in this population growth is increased immigration of pastoralists into Nigeria in the wake of the 1968-73 Sahelian drought.\n\n8. Hopen, C. E., The Pastoral Fulbe Family in Gwandu (London, 1958), 1.Google Scholar I should note here that the Fulani pastoralists are increasingly coming under Islamic influence. Thus it would not be entirely correct to describe all of them as animists. Nevertheless, the Muslims among them have not been noted for their peity. The study by Joseph Hickley and others has shown that most of the herdsmen lack a deep understanding of the Islamic tenets and that they perform the pilgrimage for both religious and extrareligious reasons. See Hickley, Joseph V., Staats, Gregory R., and McGaw, Douglas B., “Factors Associated with the Mecca Pilgrimage Among the Bokkos Fulani,” Journal of Asian and African Studies, 14 (1979), 217-29CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Hickley, Joseph V. and Thompson, William E., “Politics and the Emergence of Alhajis among the Bokkos Fulani,” Journal of Asian and African Studies, 16 (1981), 212-22.CrossRefGoogle Scholar\n\n10. The main written document—an Arabic source—on the origin of the Fulani and their immigration into Hausaland and Bomo is Mohammed Bello's Infaku'l Maisuri. This has been translated and paraphrased by Amett, F. J. in his The Rise of the Sokoto Fulani (Kano, 1922).Google Scholar\n\nStudies on the origin of the Fulani under review here are: Hopen, Pastoral Fulbe Family, Awogbade, M.

J., Savanna Nomads (London, 1964)Google Scholar; Croix, W. F., The Fulani of Northern Nigeria (Lagos, 1946).Google Scholar Anthropological notes compiled by colonial officials in northern Nigeria in the first three decades of the twentieth century also contain useful references on the origin of the Fulani. The few that were published included Boyle, C. V., “Historical Notes on the Yola Fulanis,” Journal of the African Society, 10 (1910/1911), 73–92Google Scholar; Brackenbury, E.

Among these are Dupire, Marguerite, Peuls nomades: études descriptive de WoDaaBe du Sahel nigérien (Paris, 1962)Google Scholar; idem, L'organisation sociale des Peuls: étude d'ethnographie comparée (Paris, 1970); Diara, M.S., “Les problèmes de contact entre les pasteurs Peul et les agriculteurs dans le Niger Central” in Monod, Theodore, éd., Pastoralism in Tropical Africa (London, 1975), 284-97Google Scholar; Boutrais, Jean, “Les savanes humides, dernier refuge pastoral: l'exemple de WoDaaBe, Mbororo de Centrafrique,” Genève-Afrique, 28 (1990), 65–90.Google Scholar\n\n17. Hopen, C. E., Pastoral Fulbe Family, 6–7Google Scholar, states that “[t]oday it is very rarely that one meets Fulbe na'i in Western Sokoto Province who have knowledge of any myth of origin. A few among them know one or more details or variations of the above myth; some of them for example may know only Ukuba's name and perhaps that he was an Arab, others may not know his name, but they ‘heard' he came from the East (or that he was an Arab)’”\n\n22. There are many culture heroes in the traditions of origin of many African societies. Among the Yoruba, Oduduwa is held with such reverence as the father of the people. Our view of Ukuba here corresponds to Sutton's view of Bayajida, the mythical founder of the Hausa states. According to Sutton, Bayajida has been used in the tradition of origin of the Hausa states in a fashion akin to political machination. However, ‘Bayayida may be mythical, but certainly not nonsensical.’ See Sutton, “Towards.”\n\n30. For instance D. F. Heath, ADO Gashaka Division, Adamawa Province, was unable to collect any tangible information from the Bororo. He then relied on the settled Fulani in the area who claimed to know the Bororo very well. He was still unable to collect any valuable information. He then resorted to blackmail, and in the end he was told what he himself immediately recognized as lies. He stated thus: “I am now certain of only two things about the Bororo. They have extraordinary sexual habits and they are the best and most persistent liars I have ever met.” See D. F. Heath to Resident, Adamawa Province, No. 118/9 of 6 November 1927, NAK, SNP. 17/8 K. 2055, vol. 1, 96-101.\n\n32. Jacob Burckhardt had warned that “[o]f all scholarly disciplines history is the most unscientific, because it possesses or can possess least of all an assured, approved method of selection… Every historian will have a special selection, a different criterion for what is worth communicating, according to his nationality, subjectivity, training and period.” See his Judgements on History and Historians (London, 1958), 158.Google Scholar Of course, the situation is not as confused as Burckhardt would have us believe, for certain rules of the game would still have to be followed in the selection and dissemination of knowledge.

With the help of a Hausa interpreter, Danladi Yakubu, resident in Jos, Plateau State, I spoke to six Fulani herdsmen in October 1989. The information I received confirmed the main story. But the details are fading in the memory of many pastoralists. M. O. Awogbade and I. L. Bashir, in separate audiences, agreed that there is much truth in the traditions, but there are too many gaps. The Fulani herdsmen I spoke to were: Ruwa d. Ardo, Barkin Ladi, 19 October 1989; Naman d. Jango, Bar kin Ladi, 19 October 1989; Aliyu d. Umani, Kachia, 24 October 1989; Ardo d. Zumbu Haliru, Kachia, 24 October 1989; Garba d. Wakaro, Kagoro, 27 October 1989; and Sheku Chindo, Kagoro, 27 October 1989."
