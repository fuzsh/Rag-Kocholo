        "text": "Niger-Kordofanian is the family to which the vast majority of the languages of subSaharan Africa belong. Hundreds of languages fall into this group and about 350,000,000 people speak Niger-Kordofanian languages. Geographically, this group ranges from Senegal in the west to Kenya in the east and extends as far south as South Africa. The proposal for the group ‘Niger-Kordofanian’ dates from Greenberg’s (1963) classiﬁ-\n\ncation of the languages of Africa into four families: Niger-Kordofanian, Nilo-Saharan, Afroasiatic and Khoisan. Greenberg’s creation of Niger-Kordofanian differed from earlier work on the classiﬁcation of the relevant languages with respect to both larger and smaller groupings, as well as in its assignment of certain languages to particular subgroups. For example, at the level of large groupings, he included ‘Kordofanian’ and ‘Niger-Congo’ within a single family; at the level of smaller groupings, he argued that Bantu was actually a sub-sub-subgroup of Niger-Congo – not an independent family of its own; with respect to particular languages, he argued (for example) that Fula properly belongs to the West Atlantic subgroup of Niger-Congo. The basic subdivisions for Niger-Kordofanian proposed by Greenberg are as follows: NIGER-CONGO: (1) West Atlantic, (2) Mande, (3) Gur (Voltaic), (4) Kwa, (5) Benue-Congo, (6) Adamawa-Eastern; KORDOFANIAN: (1) Koalib, (2) Tegali, (3) Talodi, (4) Tumtum, (5) Katla. (Note that in more recent work, the language family as a whole is usually called ‘Niger-Congo’, with Kordofanian as one of its branches, rather than ‘Niger-Kordofanian’; to avoid confusion, we retain Greenberg’s original terminology here.) There are several problems encountered in the classiﬁcation of the languages of this\n\ngroup. Apart from general problems involved in the classiﬁcation of any group of languages, one ﬁnds a number of speciﬁc problems. There are very few historical records of these languages that go back more than a couple of hundred years and yet we are dealing with a very large, very diverse group of languages which has been splitting apart for thousands of years. Obviously the details of larger genetic groupings will\n\n– a task that is a given the number of languages involved and the limited amount of knowledge about many of them. To illustrate this point, work by Elugbe and Williamson (1976) on the reconstruction of Proto-E. do and Proto-I.jo. (two subgroups of Kwa) calls into question the legitimacy of the distinction between Kwa and Benue-Congo. They show that properties considered to be identifying characteristics of Benue-Congo must also be reconstructed for ‘Proto-E. do-I.jo. ’. Their conclusion is that there is no evidence for separating Kwa from Benue-Congo, and that the two groups really constitute a single ‘Benue-Kwa’ subfamily of Niger-Congo. It is not within the scope of this short survey to review the work that has been done on the classiﬁcation of African languages since Greenberg’s inﬂuential work (although it is worth noting that studies such as that of Elugbe and Williamson serve to reﬁne – not refute – Greenberg’s work). Consequently, I will refer to languages and language groups according to their positions within Greenberg’s (1963) classiﬁcation. I stress that this is not intended as a rejection of reﬁnements to the 1963 classiﬁcation, but simply because that classiﬁcation is the most familiar. Because of the large number of languages in the Niger-Kordofanian family, it is\n\nprobably impossible to make any general statements that hold true of all member languages. And even if one were to have access to a comprehensive reconstruction of Proto-Niger-Kordofanian, this would tell us relatively little about the presently attested characteristics of many (most) of the descendants of that language. For example, while most Niger-Kordofanian languages are tonal (and the proto-language surely was), there are important exceptions in languages like Fula (West Atlantic) and Swahili (Bantu; Benue-Congo). Moreover, even in the ‘tonal’ languages, the actual properties of the tonal systems vary considerably; languages may employ a fairly restricted system – for example, two tones and a fairly predictable distribution of the tones – or languages may employ highly articulated systems involving several distinct tones, essentially unpredictable lexical placements of the tones, complex realisation rules, etc. Languages also differ, for example, as to whether tones are used for lexical and/or grammatical (e.g. tense) contrasts. In the following discussion, I will survey languages and language characteristics of Niger-Congo. Niger-Congo languages will be concentrated on since the Kordofanian group is more limited both in terms of number of speakers and in terms of geographical distribution (all the Kordofanian languages are spoken in the relatively small Kordofan area of Sudan). The languages that will be mentioned were chosen by virtue of being spoken by large numbers of people (although numbers vary from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions); topics to be discussed, however, have been chosen more in terms of anticipated interest than necessarily because they involve pan-Niger-Congo features. For example, perhaps all Niger-Congo languages have dental or alveolar stops while only an important subset of the family has doubly-articulated stops. But in such a case, the doubly-articulated stops will be discussed. The westernmost branch of Niger-Congo is ‘West Atlantic’. The languages of this\n\ngroup are concentrated in the extreme western portion of West Africa, ranging basically from Senegal to Liberia. This said, the list of languages included in this group will begin with an exception. Fula (Fulani, Fulfulde, Peul, Fulbe, etc.), which is perhaps the most well-known language of this group, is spoken essentially throughout West Africa in a sub-Saharan belt that extends from Senegal in the west to as far east as Chad. Closely related to Fula is Serer, a language spoken predominantly in Senegal and also in Gambia. Still closely related is Wolof, centred in Senegal but also spoken in Gambia, Mali, Mauritania and Guinea. Other important languages in the West Atlantic group\n\nTemne (Sierra Leone), Kissi (Sierra Leone, Guinea; also Liberia), Gola (Liberia; also Sierra Leone) and Limba (Sierra Leone and Guinea). Despite its not being a very uniﬁed group, it is typical for a West Atlantic language\n\nto have noun classes and a system of consonant mutations (Sapir 1971). Class systems of the type generally associated with Bantu languages (see, for example, Chapter 52 in this volume) are found in languages of the West Atlantic group. Classes may have phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic correlates. The morphological indicators of noun class membership generally involve preﬁxation and/or sufﬁxation (for example, Temne has class preﬁxes while Fula has sufﬁxes); in a language like Wolof, however, class membership is not morphologically marked and can only be deduced from the effect a noun has on governed elements. The important syntactic effect of noun classes is in determining properties of agreement. The various elements that can occur within a noun phrase will typically be marked to agree in class with the head of the noun phrase. Agreement can extend beyond the noun phrase to include elements such as the verb. The number of noun classes found in a particular language varies considerably within the West Atlantic group. For example, a language like Nalu has only three classes while certain dialects of Fula have up to twenty-ﬁve. While classes are generally not deﬁnable in terms of their semantics, certain generalisations can often be made. Classes are typically associated with either singular or plural nouns; classes may indicate notions such as ‘augmentative’ or ‘diminutive’. A particularly interesting phonological property that is related to the noun class system is consonant mutation. In Fula, for example, changes in the phonological nature of the initial consonant of a stem accompany the assignment of a particular class sufﬁx. Hence in addition to the sufﬁx marking the appropriate singular or plural class, examples like the following involve changes in the initial stem consonant: pul-lo ‘a Fula’; ful-ɓe ‘Fulas’. In the singular class, the initial stem consonant must appear in its ‘stop grade’; in the plural class, the initial stem consonant appears in its ‘fricative’ grade; other classes could require either of the above grades or a third ‘nasal grade’ (which for the p/f series would also be p, but which for many other series would be a prenasalised consonant). Although such consonant alternations correlate with noun classes in Fula, this is not always the case. In Serer, for example, the appropriate consonant grade is determined by an interaction between noun class membership and other lexical stem properties. As a ﬁnal point, consonant mutation is not restricted to nouns; consonants of adjectives, verbs and even (in Fula) certain sufﬁxes may alternate. For example, the following verbs from Fula illustrate the appearance of the fricative grade in the singular and of the nasal grade in the plural: laamɗo warii ‘the chief came’; laamɓe ngarii ‘the chiefs came’ (w/ng). Mande languages, the second group to be considered here, are spoken as far west as\n\nSenegal and as far east as Bourkina Fasso (Upper Volta) and Ivory Coast. The largest languages in this group are Maninka-Bambara-Dyula and Mende. Maninka-BambaraDyula refers to a group of very closely related dialects/languages spoken in several countries including Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast and Bourkina Fasso; Mende is spoken in Sierra Leone. Other languages in the Mande group include Soninke (Mali), Vai (Sierra Leone), Susu-Yalunka (Guinea, Sierre Leone), Loma (Liberia, Guinea), Kpelle (Liberia, Guinea), Mano (Liberia, Guinea), Dan-Kweni (Ivory Coast, Liberia), Samo (Bourkina Fasso, Mali) and Busa (Benin, Nigeria). Note that Busa is exceptional geographically for Mande, occurring as far east as Nigeria."
