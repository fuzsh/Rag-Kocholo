        "text": "Prayer Profile\n\nThe Fulakunda of Senegal The Fulakunda are a sub-group of the Fulani (or Fula), a vast cluster of peoples living throughout central and western Africa. Most of the Fulani are nomadic herdsmen, and almost all are considered Muslim. They are separated and grouped according to language, location, and occupation.\n\nAs the Fulani migrated southward to and through Guinea Bissau during the fifteenth century, some of them mixed with the Mandingo in the area. Those who intermarried with the Mandingo were considered \"black,\" or preto. These Fulani became known as Fula Preto, or Fulakunda. They speak Fulakunda (or Pulaar), which belongs to the West Atlantic branch of the Niger-Congo language family. The area they inhabit lies between Guinea Bissau, Guinea, and Gambia. They live among the Mandingo and Tukulor peoples in the forests of southern Senegal.\n\nWhat are their lives like?\n\nAlthough the Fulakunda have mixed cultures and have intermarried with the \"black\" groups in the area, they still practice many of the customs and traditions of the \"pure\" Fulani. Their lives center around their herds of cattle or sheep. In fact, the more cattle one owns, the wealthier he is considered to be. In addition, some Fulakunda are hired as herdsmen for various kingdoms in the Sudan, just as their fathers were before them.\n\nMixing agriculture with herding, the Fulakunda consume grains and milk as their staple foods. Meat is seldom eaten. In fact, only during important formal events, such as the naming ceremony or at the birth of a first son, is beef consumed. Even then, it is usually eaten only for ceremonial purposes. Donkeys, chickens, and dogs are kept on the farms.\n\nThe wuro (village) is the center of Fulakunda society. It is there that the women do most of their work. They prepare the evening meal, which takes about four or five hours. They also gather grass and twigs for the construction of their huts. Milking the cattle and preparing butter are other important chores. The men herd the cattle and dig wells. Sons over the age of 15 assume their fathers' work. The young men are directed and supervised by their fathers.\n\nAt 15, a boy builds and begins living in his own hut, which he will eventually share with his first wife. Subsequent wives will be given huts of their own. A girl is often \"lent\" to a man, to see if she will work well with the first wife. The prospective husband will visit and give gifts to the girl's family until the marriage is official.\n\nFor the most part, the Fulakunda, like other Fulani herdsmen, are illiterate. Although they may lack a scholarly grasp on book knowledge, they are considered skilled social analysts. Some elders have traveled in many countries and know of the language, people, and culture of each.\n\nWhat are their beliefs?\n\nThe Fulakunda of Senegal are a Muslim people, following the teachings of Mohammed. They adhere strongly to virtues and good morals, such as justice, honesty, generosity, and patience.\n\nThe Fulakunda think of the village as a place of rules and obligationsÂ—a place for socially acceptable behavior. The bush, on the other hand, is a place of freedom, where they can act according to their own needs.\n\nThe Fulakunda hate to feel alone. However, they tend to hide their feelings, and the need for love and companionship is not expressed in public. Only through songs is this need freely acknowledged.\n\nWhat are their needs?\n\nThree missions agencies are currently working among the Fulakunda of Senegal. Although some Christian resources are available to them, only a small number of Fulakunda have become Christians. Though portions of the Bible have been translated into their language, very few Fulakunda can read. Perhaps Christian teachers will have the greatest opportunity to work among these Muslims.\n\nThe Fulakunda are very devoted to Islam, probably because they were responsible in helping spread it throughout much of Africa. Fervent prayer is needed to break the stronghold Islam has on their lives.\n\nPrayer Points\n\nAsk the Lord of the harvest to send additional Christian laborers to work among the Fulakunda of Senegal.\n\nAsk the Holy Spirit to grant wisdom and favor to the missions agencies that are targeting the Fulakunda.\n\nPray that God will anoint the Gospel as it goes forth via radio in their area.\n\nAsk the Lord to send forth Christian teachers to live among the Fulakunda and teach them how to read the Word of God.\n\nPray that God will give the few Fulakunda believers boldness to share Christ with their families and friends.\n\nTake authority over the spiritual principalities and powers that are keeping the Fulakunda bound.\n\nPray that God will raise up teams of intercessors who will faithfully stand in the gap for these precious people.\n\nAsk the Lord to bring forth a triumphant Fulakunda church for the glory of His name!\n\nSee also the following related groups:\n\nthe Adawama Fulani of Cameroon;\n\nthe Bagirmi Fula of Chad and the Central African Republic;\n\nthe Bauchi Fulani of Nigeria; the Benin/Togo Fulani of Togo; the Bororo Fulani of Cameroon;\n\nthe Fula of Benin and Burkina Faso;\n\nthe Fula Jalon of Guinea, Mali, Senegal, and Sierra Leone;\n\nthe Fula Kita of Mali;\n\nthe Fula Macina of Mali and Maruitania;\n\nthe Fula Toro of Senegal; the Fula Kunda of Guinea Bissau;\n\nThe Fulani of Chad, Gambia, and Sudan;\n\nthe Gurma Fulani of Burkina Faso; the Krio Fula of Sierra Leone;\n\nthe Sokoto Fulani of Niger and Nigeria;\n\nthe Liptako Fula of Burkina Faso; the Toroobe Fulani of Nigeria; and the Western Fulani of Niger.\n\nStatistics\n\nLatest estimates from the World Evangelization Research Center.\n\nTHE PEOPLE\n\nPeople name: Fulakunda\n\nCountry: Senegal\n\nTheir language: fulakunda\n\nPopulation:\n\nLargest religion:\n\nChristians: <1%\n\nChurch members: 103\n\nScriptures in their own language: Portions\n\nJesus Film in their own language: None\n\nChristian broadcasts in their own language: Available\n\nMission agencies working among this people: 3\n\nPersons who have heard the Gospel: 276,600 (27%)\n\nPersons who have never heard the Gospel: 753,000 (73%)\n\nTHEIR COUNTRY\n\nCountry: Senegal\n\nPopulation:\n\nMajor peoples in size order:\n\nMajor religions:\n\nNumber of denominations: 17"
