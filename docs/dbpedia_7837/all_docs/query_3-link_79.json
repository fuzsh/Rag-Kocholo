        "text": "Fulani may refer to:\n\npertaining to the Fulani Empire\n\npertaining to the Fulani War\n\nYasir Al-Fulani, a character from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\n\nEthnic group and language\n\nFula people (autonym Fulɓe)\n\nHausa-Fulani, a larger grouping which the Fulani belong to\n\nFula language or Fulfulde language\n\nPeople (proper name)\n\nDan Fulani, nom de plume used by John Hare as a Nigerian author\n\nLenora Fulani, an American psychologist, psychotherapist, and political activist.\n\nFulani cattle\n\nRed Fulani cattle\n\nWhite Fulani cattle\n\nThe Fula, Fulani, or Fulɓe people (Fula: Fulɓe, 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞤩𞤫; French: Peul; Hausa: Fulani or Hilani; Portuguese: Fula; Wolof: Pël; Bambara: Fulaw) are one of the largest ethnic groups in the Sahel and West Africa, widely dispersed across the region. Inhabiting many countries, they live mainly in West Africa and northern parts of Central Africa but also in South Sudan, Sudan, and regions near the Red Sea coast. The approximate number of Fula people is unknown due to clashing definitions regarding Fula ethnicity; various estimates put the figure between 35 and 45 million worldwide.\n\nCentral to the Fulani people’s lifestyle is a code of behavior known as pulaaku (Fulfulde: 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞤢𞥄𞤳𞤵) or laawol Fulɓe (𞤂𞤢𞥄𞤱𞤮𞤤 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞤩𞤫) literally meaning the “Fulani pathways” which are passed on by each generation as high moral values of the Fulbe, which enable them to maintain their identity across boundaries and changes of lifestyle. Essentially viewed as what makes a person Fulani, or “Fulaniness”, pulaaku includes:\n\nMunyal: Patience, self-control, discipline, prudence\n\nGacce / Semteende: Modesty, respect for others (including foes)\n\nHakkille: Wisdom, forethought, personal responsibility, hospitality\n\nSagata / Tiinaade: Courage, hard work\n\nThe language of the Fulani is “Pulaar” 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞤢𞥄𞤪, which is also the language of the Toucouleurs. All Senegalese and Mauritanians who speak the language natively are known as the Halpulaar (𞤖𞤢𞤤𞤨𞤵𞤤𞤢𞥄𞤪) or Haalpulaar’en (𞤖𞤢𞥄𞤤𞤵𞤤𞤢𞥄𞤪𞥇𞤫𞤲), which means “speakers of Pulaar” (“hal” is the root of the Pulaar verb haalugol 𞤖𞤢𞥄𞤤𞤵𞤺𞤮𞤤, meaning “to speak”). In some areas, e.g. in northern Cameroon, Fulfulde is a local lingua franca.\n\nThere are three writing systems used to write this language: an Arabic derived one called Ajami, a Latin derived system with 6 sets, and a native phonetic-faithful system called Adlam recently invented in 1989; the third one is the most increasingly popular not only learnt by hundred thousands of people among the diaspora worldwide but has also apps and computer programs created to assist in the script’s adoption.\n\nPulaar is a Fula language spoken primarily as a first language by the Fula and Toucouleur peoples in the Senegal River valley area traditionally known as Futa Tooro and further south and east. Pulaar speakers, known as Haalpulaar’en live in Senegal, Mauritania, the Gambia, and western Mali. The two main speakers of Pulaar are the Toucouleur people and the Fulɓe (also known as Fulani or Peul). Pulaar is the second most spoken local language in Senegal, being a first language for around 22% of the population. This correlates with 23.7% of the country in which Pulaar is the population’s ethnicity. Pulaar is one of the national languages of Senegal alongside 13 others. It was admitted as an official language of Senegal by Presidential decree in 1971. There are around 28 known dialects of Pulaar, most of which are mutually intelligible with each other. The Pulaar dialects, as well as other West African languages, are usually referenced under the umbrella term ‘Fula’. Pulaar as a language, however, is not usually referenced as ‘Fula’.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue there are several dialectal varieties, but all are mutually intelligible.\n\nPulaar is not to be confused with Pular, another variety of Fula spoken in Guinea (including the Fouta Djallon region). The Pulaar and Pular varieties of Fula are to some extent mutually intelligible.\n\nPulaar is written in Latin and Adlam, but historically was written in an Arabic script known as the “Ajami script” (see Fula alphabets).\n\nThe word Pulaar translates to ‘the language of the Fulɓe’ as the stem /pul/ is the singular form of Fulɓe and the suffix /-aar/ means language. The language is believed to have formed in Fuuta Tooro when the ancestors of the Toucouleur people began speaking the language of the Fulɓe. It is then believed that the term Haalpulaar’en (which means ‘speakers of the language of Pulaar’) was created to apply to non-Fulɓe speakers of Fulɓe, of which the Toucouleur people are the largest demographic.\n\nAlphabet\n\na, b, ɓ, c, d, ɗ, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, mb, n, nd, ng, nj, ñ, ŋ, o, p, r, s, t, u, w, y, Ƴ\n\nNumbers\n\nThe Pulaar counting system is base five (a quinary-decimal system) which is similar to the surrounding Niger-Congo languages. The number 7, for example, uses the prefix of d͡ʒoj (5) and the suffix ɗiɗi (2) becoming d͡ʒeeɗiɗi (5+2). Other languages that use this system in West Africa include Pular, Wolof, Sereer-Sine and East Limba. These quinary-decimal counting languages can be found in the west African regions of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Gambia. Pulaar and Pular possess almost identical words for numbers, in which every number from 1 to 10 share the exact same name except for 5 (d͡ʒoj for Pulaar and d͡ʒowi for Pular).\n\nNoun Classes\n\nPulaar contains 21 noun classes. These noun classes can commonly be observed by looking at the suffix of a noun. For example, a noun that is the result of a loan word will typically end in -o (however, human singular nouns such as debbo (meaning woman) also end in -o). The class of the noun will often refer to the actual content of the noun. For example, the ɗam noun class is applied to nouns that describe a liquid.\n\nAnother feature of the language is initial consonant mutation between singular and plural forms of nouns and of verbs.\n\nfaɗo (shoe), paɗe (shoes), paɗon (little shoes)\n\nsekko (reed), cekke (reeds), cekkon (little reeds)\n\nhaayre (stone), kaaƳe (stones), kaaƳon (little stones)\n\nraŋalde (backside), daŋaale (backsides), ndaŋalon (little backsides)\n\nwudere (sarong), gude (sarongs), ngudon (little sarongs)\n\nwowru (mortar), boɓi (mortars), nboɓon (little mortars)\n\nyertere (peanut), gerte (peanuts), ngerton (tiny peanuts)\n\nyeeso (face), jeese (faces), njeeson (little faces)\n\npaɗel (little shoe), paɗal (big shoe)\n\nhello (slap), kellel (little slap), kellal (big slap)\n\nVowel Suffixes\n\nThe Pulaar verb system contains multiple suffixes which can be added to verbs to change their cases. These suffixes include the –t suffixes, the -d suffixes, the -n suffixes, and the -r suffixes. When multiple suffixes are used in a single verb, they follow the ‘TDNR’ order. This means that –t suffixes go before -d suffixes which go before -n suffixes, and -r suffixes are the last in order. There are few exceptions to this rule. An example of this is the word nyaam-n-id-ii. In this word, the -n suffix goes before the -d suffix.\n\nThe -t suffix is added to verbs in order to change the case of the verb. The allomorphs -t or -it are added to make a verb retaliative, meaning to do in retaliation for a previous action. For example, lata (meaning ‘kick’) adds the allomorph –it to become lat-it-o (meaning ‘kick back’). The allomorphs -t, -it or -ut are added to a verb to make it reversive, meaning to do the opposite of the original verb. For example, taara (meaning ‘wind’) becomes taar-t-a (meaning ‘unwind’). The same allomorphs apply for the repetitive case, meaning the repeating of an action. There are no means of distinguishing between a reversive and a repetitious case other than by observing the context of the sentence. The allomorphs -t and -it are used to make a verb reflexive, which means to make the object of the action the same as the subject. For example, ndaara (meaning ‘look at’) becomes ndaar-t-o (meaning ‘look at oneself’). The allomorphs -t, -ut and -it are used to show that a verb is completed with intensity. For example, yana (meaning ‘fall’) becomes yan-t-a (meaning ‘fall heavily’). For words such as yama (meaning ‘ask’), the intensive form becomes yam-t-a (meaning ‘interrogate’) which is also the same form the repetitive case (meaning ‘ask again’). Therefore, yam-t-a is either one of those cases and therefore cannot be distinguished without taking into account the context of the sentence it is used in.\n\nThe negative accomplished verb form ends in -aani.\n\nEssential Phrases\n\nDictionary / English-Pulaar\n\nAa\n\nBb\n\nCc\n\nDd\n\nEe\n\nFf\n\nGg\n\nHh\n\nIi\n\nJj\n\nKk\n\nSynonyms\n\nThe source for this dictionary uses a lot of peculiar words and as such we thought it would be helpful to include this list of synonyms of more common words along with the dictionary entry they coincide with.
