Other languages in the Atlantic branch are Wolof, Serer, Koñagi, Baga, Landuma, and Kissi. The Mandé branch is also in the Niger-Congo family, and includes Maninka, Susu, Jakanke, Jalonke, and Soninke.\n\nThe dialect taught in this book, known as Pular Fuuta, is spoken in the area that once comprised the theocratic kingdom of the Fuuta Jallon (most of which is in modern-day Guinea). Other dialects in the area are Fulakunda, spoken in Casamance (southern Senegal) and parts of Guinea-Bissau and Gambia; and Pulaar, the language of the Toroobe (Toucouleur) in Northern and southeastern Senegal and southern Mauritania (as well as in Dinguiraye in Guinea). Other forms of Pular are spoken in Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Cameroon. Linguists sometimes refer to Pular and its first cousins by the generic name of Fulfulde.\n\nIt is a useful language in West Africa, not only because it has relatives in so many different countries, but also because the Fulåe-Fuuta are everywhere. As a result of large emigration movements over the last 50-60 years, every West African capital has a colony of Fulåe traders, merchants, etc. Today there are over 2.5 million speakers of the Fuuta Jallon dialect, out of around 14 million Pular speakers total.\n\nA brief history of the Fuuta-Jallon Fulåe\n\nYou may hear a lot of stories about the origin of the Fulåe1: they came from Ethiopia, they came from Australia, they’re the lost tribe of Israel, and so on. There are several causes for this speculation: The French wondered about their light skin and fine features, and their language seemed unrelated to any of the surrounding languages; add to this the fact that there are credible historical sightings of the Fulåe as far east as Libya and Egypt. And the Fulåe themselves like the idea that they are somehow mysterious, different from (and perhaps superior to) their neighbors.\n\n1 Also known as the Peulh (the Wolof word for them) or the Fula (the Hausa word for them). Fulåe is what they call themselves (Pullo in the singular).\n\nMore recent research in anthropology and linguistics lends support to the following story: The Fulåe originated north of the Senegal river, in what is now Mauritania. They traveled widely; some wandered east, where they were islamicized by Arabs or Berbers, and eventually returned west. The Fuuta Jallon was settled by the Fulåe in two waves: the first, possibly as early as the 13th century, consisted of pagan (nonIslamic) Fulåe, known as Pulli. The second began in the 16th century and consisted of Moslem Fulåe from Macina in what is now the republic of Mali. This clan of Fulåe originally shared the Fuuta Jallon with its other inhabitants, nonMuslim Fulåe and Jallonke. Sometime in the 17th century, though, they became fed up with the pagans’ drinking and dancing, and declared holy war. This jihad was long and bloody and featured a number of atrocities, if the Fulåe’s own oral history is to be believed. When the dust settled (around 1725), the Muslim Fulåe had established a federal theocracy under Islamic law, with a central ruler in Timbo (near present-day Mamou), a holy city in Fougoumba, and seven other provinces (diwe) with a certain amount of autonomy. Labe quickly became the wealthiest and most powerful of these, expanding its borders to the north and west until it encompassed an area nearly as long as the rest of the kingdom put together. From the outset this kingdom was plagued by power struggles. The descendants of the first Almaami (Imam/king) quickly split into two houses, the Alfaya and the Soriya, which fought more or less incessantly throughout the history of the kingdom. For a while a system of bicephalism was formalized, in which there were always two Almaamis, one from each house, who would trade off power every two years. In practice this didn’t work out very well, as one might expect; and reigning Almaamis stood a good chance of having their heads cut off and delivered in a gourd to the Almaami-in-waiting. The French were able to establish themselves in all the surrounding areas long before they made any headway in the Fuuta. They were finally able to capitalize on internal power struggles, and on Labe’s hopes for greater autonomy. In 1896, at the battle of Pore-Daka, the French, along with the armies of Alfa Yaya, chief of Labe, defeated the last Almaami, Buubakar Biro. The colonial authorities moved quickly to consolidate their power over the area, putting puppet chiefs in place, dividing the Fuuta in order to strengthen leaders favorable to them, and little by little diluting the role of the Almaami. As Alfa Yaya watched his authority slip away, he tried to organize an uprising against the colonists; but his plot was discovered, and he was sent into exile. He died in a prison colony in Mauritania.\n\nHow to use this book:\n\nThis book was written to complement and support an intensive 3-month training for Peace Corps volunteers. It is primarily intended to be used alongside daily classes led by an instructor who is a native speaker of Pular. It is also designed to serve as a reference and study tool for the volunteer once at site, whether or not they received extensive language training beforehand. The vocabulary, texts, and examples draw heavily from the experience of volunteers, and the competences reflect the communications needs of someone living and working in a village or town in the Fuuta Jallon. Having said all that, there is no reason why this book couldn’t be used by someone learning entirely on their own, or by someone with needs different from those of a PCV. We hope that travelers, researchers, development workers, missionaries, and others might find this guide useful. The book is divided into two parts: 9 competence-based chapters, based on cartoon dialogues, which can be covered in three months of training; and 4 chapters based on texts, intended for independent study at site. These texts are considerably more difficult than the dialogues given in the competences; they are raw excerpts from documents written by and for native speakers, and have not been simplified for the learner. They offer a variety of writing styles and illustrate some more advanced grammatical structures. Each chapter includes one or more dialogues or texts, a vocabulary list, one or more points of grammar, cultural notes, and exercises. For those using this book to study independently, we suggest the following approach to each chapter: Read the dialogues or text, trying to figure out words you don’t understand from the pictures or the context, before peeking at the vocabulary list. In the vocabulary lists, we’ve tried to be comprehensive; don’t be intimidated. The lists are intended to serve as a reference, and you shouldn’t feel that you need to memorize every word right away. Sometimes the essential beginners’ vocabulary is highlighted; focus on this, then learn more of the vocabulary when you can. Review the grammar points, looking back to the dialogue or text for examples. Don’t be intimidated by the grammar either; it is there for your reference. Just read through it once, then refer back to it when necessary. These explanations are here to help answer any questions you may have about the way the language works, not to make you feel like you don’t speak Pular until you master all the rules. Work the exercises, then have a native speaker help you correct your work (see below for more about working with an informant). Do them in pencil and fix any errors, so that the worked exercises themselves provide a useful resource.\n\nApproximate extent of the Islamic kingdom of the Fuuta Jallon, 19th century. Towns established or made important by the French are in parentheses.\n\nTips on learning Pular at post:\n\nNot everyone has the benefit of months of intensive language training before arriving at post; even if you did have this training, you will need to continue to put effort into learning the language on your own once you’re at your site. Perhaps this goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: this book should not be the focus of your self-directed language study. You will learn Pular from Pular speakers, not from a book; this manual is just a crutch, a reference to help answer your questions, a shortcut to understanding how the language works. You need to spend a lot of time just listening to Pular being spoken, but you also need time focused on studying the language. Hire a tutor/informant, make a schedule, and keep to it. Much of the following advice is summarized from Learning a Field Language by Robbins Burling (Ann Arbor: U. Michigan Press, 1984), which is full of helpful hints and takes about an hour to read cover to cover. It is a small green paperback; Peace Corps has many copies. Focus on comprehension rather than production. Once you can understand a certain percentage of what is being said, you will begin to make much more rapid progress. You will come to speak correctly without having to think about the grammar involved, because you already have an ear for what “sounds right.” When you do speak Pular, don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Focus on getting out whatever message it is you want to communicate. In fact, it is better if your Pular is a little broken, because this indicates that you are learning, and prompts the other person to speak slowly and be patient with you. Focus on vocabulary rather than grammar. Your priority is to communicate, not to speak elegantly. You can get by with a minimum of grammar; “me want water” is understandable and unambiguous. Without vocabulary, you can neither speak nor understand. Use mnemonic tricks to learn many words quickly: associate a Pular word with a similarsounding English word, and then make up a visual association between the two concepts, no matter how far-fetched. Dogugol means “to run”; so picture a dog running. Ngesa means “field”; so picture a flock of geese sitting in a field.\n\nWorking with an informant\n\nIf you hire someone to help you learn Pular, you should not think of them as your teacher or tutor. Very few Fulåe have ever needed to think about how Pular grammar works or have been trained to teach Pular as a second language. If they are educated, they may try to shoehorn Pular into French grammatical structures they have studied. You should think of this person as an informant, a natural source of authentic Pular speech. This book should be able to answer your grammatical questions. Your informant is there to provide you with spontaneous spoken language to learn from, and to help you build your vocabulary. You will need to take the lead in giving structure to sessions with your informant; decide what you want to learn, and how you want to go about it. More advice: Use a tape recorder. Give your tutor a topic and have them speak for three–five minutes into the tape recorder; even better, record a conversation between two people. Transcribe the recording with their help. Afterwards listen to the recording over and over until you can understand everything that is said without referring back to your notes. Completing this exercise just once can push your ability to understand spoken Pular to a new level. Don’t start from French. Don’t ask, “How do you say X in Pular?” This forces your informant to grope for a Pular equivalent to a French word, when such an equivalent may not really exist, or where several different words could be used in different contexts. Rather, have your informant generate speech, and then attempt to understand the words he or she has spontaneously used. Dedicate a lot of time to learning the language when you first arrive at post, particularly if you are a health or NRM volunteer and don’t have a lot to do at first. This is the time you should spend getting to know your community, and learning Pular is an integral part of that process. Research shows that the more hours a day you spend studying a language, the more you get out of each hour; in other words, you get more from studying four hours a day for a week than from studying one hour a day for four weeks. This investment in time will serve you well once you shift into a more active role in your community.\n\nAbout mixing Pular and French\n\nPular borrows promiscuously from other languages—and this dialect does so more than others. For obvious reasons, most religious and legal terminology comes from Arabic; and huge amounts of French vocabulary have made their way into everyday conversation. There are also words from English, Portuguese, Malinke, Susu, Wolof, and others. Every learner of Pular will need to strike a balance between using French words when appropriate, and speaking as pure a Pular as possible without using French as a crutch. On the one hand, if a French word is more widely used and understood than the “pure” Pular equivalent, then it makes more sense to use the borrowed term; for instance, fuleer (from fleur) is more widely used to say “flower” than pindi (the correct Pular word). And it makes little sense to make up words in Pular when there is already a French word being used; thus we prefer soferjo (from chauffeur) for “driver,” rather than the contrived doginoowo (“one who causes to run”). We don’t tell you how to tell clock time in Pular because no one ever does so; everyone either uses the French words (or the Arabic prayer times). On the other hand, one can easily get into the lazy habit of lapsing into French when the Pular word doesn’t come to mind; in fact, many educated Fulåe speak this way. The danger is that this reliance on French may prevent you from expanding your vocabulary and refining your Pular. In this book we try to teach Pular as it is spoken today by the average Pullo who speaks little or no French; if you are learning Pular, it is presumably in order to communicate with this person. This still includes borrowed vocabulary, but only those words that have been absorbed into the language and are universally understood by the Fulåe. Depending on a given word’s degree of assimilation into the Pular language, we either render it in the Pular orthography (dwaagol, to need to, from doit) or in its original French spelling, in italics (huit heures trente).\n\nOther Pular resources\n\nThis manual is intended to give an introduction to the basics of the Pular language. There is a great deal that has been deliberately left out or simplified to keep things accessible and friendly. The learner who wishes to study the language seriously on their own may find that this book doesn’t go deep enough or that some of the complexities of the language have been smoothed over. The Protestant missionaries in Labe and Conakry, some of whom are trained linguists working to translate the Bible into Pular, are the best source of Pular learning materials. The Peace Corps resource centers in Conakry and Labe also have a variety of documents. Here are some of the most useful resources for continued study. Evans, Barrie. Teaching Grammar of Pular\n\n(Christian Reformed World Missions) . This is the most complete and reliable Pular grammar around, and most of the grammatical explanations in this book are based on it. It was written by a missionary linguist, and some may find the technical language and occasional forays into obscure points of linguistics intimidating; but this is the definitive guide to the language and there are few grammatical questions it doesn’t answer. It is available at cost from the missionaries in Labe. Fuzzy copies of an older draft version are floating around Peace Corps as well. Evans, Barrie. Dictionnaire Pular-Français-Anglais (Christian Reformed World Missions) . This companion volume to the Teaching Grammar is the most thorough dictionary we know of. Although it is officially still a work in progress, the missionaries in Labe may provide you a copy of the most recent version for the cost of reproducing it. Fagerberg-Diallo, Sonja, Ph.D. Pular: A Guide for the Dialect of Fuuta Jallon (Guinea) (Joint Christian Mission to West Africa) . Written by a linguist who has studied a number of Fufulde dialects, this book complements Evans in some ways: it provides a wealth of cultural and historical background, and a number of useful annotated texts; and it puts this dialect in the context of its near relatives. However, some of the grammar explanations are just wrong, and a number of phrases from other dialects—which would be incomprehensible to most Fulåe Fuuta—have crept in; so use with care, and with the help of a local informant. Peace Corps has a number of red, hard-bound copies.\n\nPular texts:\n\nYou may find written texts a useful tool for learning the language. One way to obtain large quantities of text to work with is to record radio rurale broadcasts (Contes et légendes en langue Pular or Tinndi e Taali e Haala Pular, Wednesdays at 11:00 p.m. is often good). Even better, give people a topic and have them talk into a tape recorder; and then transcribe (see “Tips on learning Pular at post,” above) Here are some other sources of text: Diallo, Abdalla. Taali . These 19 folk tales were compiled as a masters’ thesis at Kankan University. They provide a wealth of raw material, and the stories provide an interesting look at the Pullo imagination at work. Peace Corps has a few copies, and so do the missionaries in Labe. Diallo, Al-Hajji Malaaðo Baame-Kuree. Taarixa Fii Alsilaamaaku\n\n(History of the Islamic State) . This is a transcription made by Barrie Evans of an oral history of the Islamic state of the Fuuta Jallon. The English translation is included, which makes it a very useful study tool; and the story itself is fascinating. Diallo, Aliou et Abdourahmane Diallo (trans.) Anndugol fii Danndugol: Savoir Pour Sauver en Pular (Service National d’Alphabétisation, 1995) . This 90-page guide to basic health care is particularly useful for health volunteers. There are chapters on birth control, childhood diseases, AIDS, etc. There are a few publishers in Conakry, such as Editions Ganndal, producing Pular-language books—mostly poetry and songs. These can be found in bookstores around Conakry. The poetry is interesting but often the vocabulary is so elevated and the language so stylized that even native speakers end up scratching their heads trying to decipher them. There are also a number of Pular texts available on the Internet; just type “Pular” into a search engine and see what turns up. Another good starting point is http://www.fuuta–jaloo.org.\n\nAbout this edition\n\nThis is the second edition of this book. The first was written by Alfa Oumar Kona Baldé, with technical assistance and supervision from Mane Sylla of the CHP/Peace Corps training center in Thies, Senegal, in 1998. This second edition was produced by Herb Caudill (PCV Guinea 1997-99) and Ousmane Besseko Diallo.\n\nWe have attempted to add in this edition: the perspective of recent learners of Pular on how to approach the language; volunteers’ views on what language (grammar, vocabulary) is most useful; enough substance to be useful as a reference at post; a functional and compact layout and design to lower reproduction costs; and a sense of humor to keep the learner interested and to make the whole process of learning a strange tongue a little more bearable. We suggest that this approach—collaboration between a Peace Corps volunteer who has learned the language and a trainer who speaks it as his or her mother tongue—is the best way to come up with a manual that is relevant, useful, and user-friendly for volunteers, while remaining accurate. This is a work in progress, and we welcome advice and criticism from all sides: trainers, trainees, volunteers, Peace Corps staff, and others. This manual is available online at http://www.ibamba.net/pular; the authors’ email addresses are given below. Herb Caudill thanks Ibrahima Barry, Oumar Diallo, Ousmane Besseko Diallo and Mamadou Ciré Pellal Diallo, as well as the people of Maali-Yamberen and surrounding villages, for teaching him Pular before, during, and after his service as a volunteer. In addition the authors thank those who have looked over the first drafts of this document and who have suggested improvements: in particular, Becky Furth and Beverly Roberts.\n\nHerbert Caudill\n\nherb@ibamba.net\n\nOusmane Besseko Diallo\n\nbesseko@yahoo.fr\n\nConakry, Guinea,\n\nJuly 2000\n\nOverview\n\nRow 1, Column 1 Row 1, Column 2 Row 1, Column 3 Row 1, Column 4\n\nVOCABULARY GRAMMAR CULTURAL NOTES KEY WORDS\n\nBasic greetings Questions to which “Jam tun” is the correct answer Alternatives to “Jam tun” Taking leave Polite words Useful phrases for the beginner\n\nSpelling and pronunciation Respect Women and Islam Body language Greetings during prayertime The Will of God Living up to your predecessor\n\nOccupations Nationalities & ethnicities Social roles Phrasebook: Introductions A couple of handy words C’est madame … ou mademoiselle?\n\nPersonal pronouns Will you marry me?

In Pular this also applies when referring to someone in the third person; when referring to your father, for instance, you would say respectfully “they are sleeping” rather than “he is sleeping.”\n\nThat’s the easy part. To complicate things further, there is a special vocabulary of respect—verbs like “to come” or “to sleep” or nouns like “head” or “hand” have completely different forms when applied to someone of status.\n\nCompetence 1 [ GREETINGS ] 3\n\nGRAMMAR\n\nSpelling and pronunciation\n\nular is written the way it is pronounced. The orthography used in this book was adopted in 1966 at a UNESCO conference in Bamako, and abides by the principle of one symbol/one sound. Speakers of Spanish or Italian should find Pular pronunciation easy; the five vowel sounds are the same as in those languages (a, e, i, o, u). There are only three sounds in Pular that are completely unfamiliar: these are the implosive consonants å, ð, and ý (also known as funky å, funky ð, and funky ý). The velar ø sound (which is like the ng in “sing”) as well as the mb, mg, nj, and nd combinations all exist in English, but may seem a bit strange at the beginning of a word. The palatal ñ is pronounced ny, just like in Spanish.1 Two more things: c is actually a ch sound like in Italian (“cello”); and the r is rolled like in Spanish (“rumba”). Double vowels (aa, ee, etc.) indicate a long vowel; double consonants (bb, cc, etc.) indicate a stressed consonant. These differences are very important in Pular and can be frustratingly subtle for the beginner. You should not worry too much about pronouncing all these sounds exactly right; getting rid of a foreign accent can take years, and isn’t really necessary; it is possible to be fluent in a language and still have a heavy accent. You do, however, need to learn to differentiate between contrasting sounds, both when listening and when speaking. From the beginning, you should exaggerate the difference between similar sounds— b vs. b, aa vs. a, tt vs. t. Make the long vowels really long, and the short vowels very, very short, and so on. It may feel silly at first, but it will help you fix the differences in your mind and it will help you make yourself understood. The drills at the end of the chapter, worked with a patient informant, can help get you off to a good start. We suggest here a somewhat unorthodox handwritten form of the harmonized alphabet, which we find easier to write and highlights the differences between “regular” and “funky” consonants. There are other writing systems for Pular in use; the correspondences are listed in the above table. Most Fulåe use a form of Arabic script to write Pular; if you need to communicate in writing with people, and feel up to a challenge, have someone teach you the letters. It’s not that hard and it can earn you a lot of respect.\n\n1The palatal ñ is usually written ñ; this is the glyph adopted by the Bamako conference. We have chosen to go against convention here for three reasons: because American learners are more likely to be familiar with the ñ already, from Spanish; because we find it easier to write by hand; and because we always get ñ mixed up with ø .\n\nP LETTER USED IN THIS BOOK\n\nENGLISH EXAMPLE\n\nPULAR EXAMPLE\n\nOTHER WRITING SYSTEMS\n\na a father awdi (seed)\n\nb b boy baaba (father)\n\nb b beyngu (wife) Benggu\n\nbh c c cello coggu (price) ty d d dog danki (bed) ð ð ðatal (path) dh e e pet esiraawo (in-law) f f fun fayande (cooking pot) g g girl gatal (prayer mat) h h house hanki (yesterday) i i ski innde (name) j j jump jungo (hand or arm) dy, di k k kite kosan (sour milk) l l leg lekki (tree) m m mouse mawðo (old person) mb mb amber mbeewa (goat) n n note nebban (oil) nd nd mandate ndowru (mouse) ng ng anger ngayuuri (lion) nj nj enjoy njaatigi (friend) ø ø sing øari (beauty) nh ñ ñ tenure ñaari (cat) ny, ñ o o open o’owooye (no) p p path puyðo (lazy person) r r reedu (stomach) s s salt saare (town) t t talk teew (meat) u u tutu unirgal (pestle) ou w w water woyndu (well) ou y y yellow yeeso (face) ý ý ýiiyan (blood) yh ’ ’\n\n(glottal stop)\n\nýi’al (bone)\n\n4 Competence 1 [ GREETINGS ]\n\nEXERCISES\n\nA.

In general, in the Fuuta as in most of the world, women have a harder time than men getting respect and being taken seriously outside traditional feminine roles. Although white women receive more respect simply for being white, and in some cases are treated as honorary men, they will still likely find that they are accorded less respect than their male peers.\n\nCompetence 2 [ INTRODUCTIONS ] 7\n\nCompetence 2 [ INTRODUCTIONS ] Wonaa mi Faranseejo, ðey!

The negation of ko is wonaa (also pronounced wanaa, hinaa, or just naa)\n\nCompetence 2 [ INTRODUCTIONS ] 9\n\nGRAMMAR\n\nPersonal pronouns\n\nWe will introduce two types of personal pronouns now: the subject and the independent. (We give the French here because the independent pronoun is used similarly in Pular). Min, ko mi jannoowo. Moi , je suis professeur. Me , I am a teacher. An, ko a jangoowo. Toi , tu es élève. You , you are a student.\n\nTwo differences between pronouns in English and in Pular: First, there are no masculine or feminine terms: o can mean “he” or “she”. Second, there are two ways to say “we”: If the person being spoken to is included, you use en; if the person being spoken to is not included, you use men (see sidebar). Note that the plural pronouns also serve to denote respect, as they do in French. A jaraama. Hello (familiar) On jaraama. Hello. (respectful) On jaraama. Hello.

This is almost always done in a joking manner, and the best response is to not take things to seriously; play along with the joke. If someone really wants to propose, they will do it privately or through someone else.\n\nThe proposal: Miðo faala jombude ma. I want to marry you.\n\nHow to “accept”: Awa, mi salataako. OK, that’s fine. Ko honto teøe an woni? Where’s my dowry? Ðun no fandi. That’s not adequate. Hiða haani okkude mawbe an ben na’i sappo. You’ll have to give my folks ten cows.\n\nSome gentle refusals: Miðo mari moodi. I have a husband. Mi ýettaama. I’m already taken. Mi andaa maa. I don’t know you. Mi falaaka jombeede. I don’t want to get married. Mi hewtaali jombeede taho. I’m not old enough to marry.\n\nSome not-so-gentle refusals (use with care): Mi falaaka maa. I don’t like you. Hiða kaani. You’re ugly. Hiða fanði. You’re small. Ko sagata mi faalaa. I want a young man. Ko mawðo mi faalaa. I want an old man.\n\nCompetence 2 [ INTRODUCTIONS ] 11\n\nC. Name that profession\n\nWrite the Pular word for each of the following characters’ profession.\n\nCULTURAL NOTES\n\nLast name games\n\nAn interesting custom in the Fuuta is sanakuyaagal or joking between clans. Here’s how it works: the Diallos tease the Baldes (or Bahs) and the Sows joke with the Barrys. These are the four “noble” last names of the Fulåe-Fuuta; people with humbler last names (who are often descendants of slaves from other ethnic groups) don’t get to play.\n\nFor example, a Barry might call a Sow a thief (gujjo) or a slave (maccuðo) and otherwise ridicule their character and lineage, all in good fun. The cross-cousins don’t have to know each other well to start play-insulting each other.\n\nSome portos take a Pullo last name and jump into the sanakuyaagal game with enthusiasm; this is usually good for laughs. Others are uncomfortable making jokes about slavery and the Fulbe social hierarchy.\n\n12 Competence 2 [ INTRODUCTIONS ]\n\nD. Me, Me, Me\n\nWrite a paragraph in which you introduce yourself.\n\nE.

That is my father. It can be replaced by a person’s name: Ko baaba Aamadu nii. That is Amadou’s father. The table to the right shows all the pronouns we’ve seen so far. The pronouns an, maa, men, and amen are particularly hard to keep straight because they sound like other pronouns. Two of these pronouns, men and mon, have lengthened forms as well, which are perhaps more insistent: me’en and mo’on, respectively. baaba men baaba me’en } our father baaba mon baaba mo’on } your father EXERCISES\n\nA.

There are a few rules beyond that (one penny, two pennies) and a handful of irregularities (one mouse, two mice). In Pular, plurals are very irregular; the whole word changes, and there are no easy rules—although there are patterns that will soon become apparent. Our advice is just to memorize the plural form of each noun along with the singular, and eventually you’ll get the hang of it. The table to the right gives a sampler of plural forms.\n\nGeneric noun forms\n\nHere’s another twist: In addition to the singular and plural noun forms, there is often a generic noun form that is neither singular nor plural. Some English nouns are essentially generic: “corn,” as in “corn is good for you,” refers to the grain in a general sense. You don’t say “one corn” or “two corns”; to discuss individual items, in this case, you say “one ear of corn.” In Pular, you would say kaaba (corn), kaabawal (ear of corn), or kaabaaje (ears of corn). The following table gives some examples of nouns with generic, singular, and plural forms.\n\nSOME GENERIC NOUNS\n\nSINGULAR PLURAL GENERIC MEANING\n\nbareeru ndun bareeji ðin bare on\n\ndog\n\nbiiniiri ndin biniije ðen biini on\n\nbottle\n\notowal ngal otooje ðen oto on\n\ncar\n\nñariiru ndun ñariiji ðin ñaari on\n\ncat\n\nbareeru ndun bareeji ðin bare on\n\ndog\n\nsaabiwal ngal caabiije ðen saabi on\n\nkey\n\nkotiraawo on kotiraaåe åen koto on\n\nolder brother\n\nleemunneere nden leemunneeje ðen leemunne on\n\norange\n\nbireediwal ngal bireediije ðen bireedi on\n\nbread\n\nOften the generic form is the most commonly heard, and the singular is only used to emphasize that a single item is being referred to. The generic always takes the on article (leemune on) regardless of the class of the singular (leemuneere nden).\n\nNouns: An overview of the class system\n\nEnglish has no noun class system. French has two classes: masculine and feminine. Every noun falls into one class or the other, and words that modify the noun must agree with its class: articles (le livre, la table), adjectives (un bon livre, une bonne table), demonstratives (ce livre, cette table) and so on.\n\nSOME SAMPLE PLURALS SINGULAR PLURAL MEANING\n\npullo on fulåe åen Pullo fello ngon pelle ðen hill koðo on hoååe åen guest mboddi ndin bolle ðen snake lewru ndun lebbi ðin month finkaari ndin pinkaaje ðen rifle otowal ngal otooje ðen car dolokke nden dolokaaji ðin shirt karambol ngol karambi ðin pen ngesa mban gese ðen field paykun kun paykoy koy child\n\n26 Competence 4 [ PLACES & THINGS ]\n\nPular has 24 classes. This sounds scary, but it’s not really that complicated: as with French, with a little practice it’s easy to guess what class a noun belongs to. While some classes are associated with certain meanings, it’s often easier to learn noun classes by the sound of the words. Let’s look at some of the most important classes (an exhaustive summary is on page 114).\n\non, åen The on class is used for singular human nouns: gorko on the man portojo on the white person Most words borrowed from other languages also fall into this class. Bik on the pen maakiti on the market Generic terms (as opposed to plural or singular, see above) are also in this class. kaaba on the corn The åen class is used for plural human nouns exclusively. woråe åen the men portooåe åen the white people\n\nðen, ðin Almost all other plurals fall into either the ðen class or the ðin class. defte ðen the books bareeji ðin the dogs All plurals ending in e take ðen; all plurals ending in i take ðin.\n\nkun, koy The kun class is used for diminutives. paykun kun the (small) child pootihun kun the little jar The koy class is used for the plurals of nouns in the kun class. paykoy koy the small children pootihoy koy the small jars\n\nOther classes The remaining classes aren’t as easy to categorize semantically or grammatically, so you’ll just have to learn what words go in which class, and train your ear as you go along. The above table gives an example for each of the remaining classes.\n\nArticles\n\nIn all of the above examples we have given the word with its definite article (equivalent to the in English or le/la in French). There is no indefinite article in Pular (equivalent to a in English or un/une in French). gorko a man gorko on the man The article can be used in addition to the possessive pronoun. Deftere makko no ka suudu. A book of his is in the house. Deftere makko nden no ka suudu. His book is in the house.\n\nEXAMPLES OF NOUNS IN OTHER CLASSES\n\nsaare nden\n\nthe town\n\nmboddi ndin\n\nthe snake\n\nbareeru ndun\n\nthe dog\n\nnaange ngen\n\nthe sun\n\nfello ngon\n\nthe hill\n\ncoggu ngun\n\nthe price\n\ngertogal ngal\n\nthe chicken\n\nsonsoliwii ngii\n\nthe mosquito\n\nlaawol ngol\n\nthe road\n\nmbeewa mban\n\nthe goat\n\nhaala kan\n\nthe language\n\nlaåi kin\n\nthe knife\n\nmaaro kon\n\nthe rice\n\nndiyan ðan\n\nthe water\n\nALL 24 CLASS ARTICLES\n\non, åen ðen, ðin nden, ndin, ndun ngen, ngon, ngun ngal, ngel, ngii, ngol mban kan, kin, kon kal, kol kun, koy ðan, ðun\n\n(Please don’t bother memorizing this list.)\n\nCompetence 4 [ PLACES & THINGS ] 27\n\nVerbs: An overview\n\nTo make up for its complex noun system, Pular has a very straightforward, 99% predictable verb system. There are three infinitive endings: -ugol, -agol, and -egol. A verb can have three different forms: one in which the action is performed on something/someone else by the subject (-ugol, transitive), one in which it is performed on the subject by the subject (-agol, reflexive), one in which it is performed on the subject by someone/something else (-egol, passive).\n\nTRANSITIVE lootugol\n\nto wash (something or someone)\n\nREFLEXIVE lootagol\n\nto wash oneself\n\nPASSIVE lootegol\n\nto be washed (by someone else)\n\nEach type of verb has its own set of endings. A complete table is on page 109. There are no irregular verbs, and verbs are not conjugated.\n\nThe imperative\n\nThe verb endings for the imperative are given below.\n\nIMPERATIVE VERB ENDINGS 2ND PERSON SINGULAR 2ND PERSON PLURAL\n\n1ST PERSON PLURAL (INCLUSIVE)\n\nyou (an) you all (onon) we (enen)\n\n-ugol -u -ee -en\n\n-agol -o -ee -oðen\n\n-egol\n\nPassive verbs have no imperative form.\n\nHere are some examples: arugol Aru!\n\nCome!

In Pular there are quite a few; we’ll look at the basic ones here. gaa here (used for a place where one lives or works) ðoo here (used in a more general sense) too over yonder ton there\n\nTHREE TYPES OF VERBS INFINITIVE EXAMPLE MEANING\n\n-ugol yahugol\n\nto go\n\n-agol jooðagol\n\nto sit\n\n-egol faalegol to want\n\nANCIENT WISDOM OF THE FULÅE Leggal, ko waalii ka ndiyan woo, wontataa noora.\n\nNo mater how long it sits in the water, a log doesn’t turn into a crocodile.\n\n28 Competence 4 [ PLACES & THINGS ]\n\nEXERCISES\n\nA.

See page 25 for more details.\n\nCompetence 5 [ FOOD ] 35\n\nGRAMMAR\n\nThe stative\n\nIn English, we usually use adjectives to express qualities. I am hungry . The food is bad . In Pular, we often use stative verbs instead of adjectives; instead of expressing qualities, they express states. Miðo weelaa. I am hungry . (from weelegol , to be hungry) Ñiiri ndin no metti. The food tastes bad . (from mettugol , to taste bad)\n\nThe table below shows the verb endings we’ve seen so far. A comprehensive table is on page 109. Here are some examples with the stative endings. Hiåe yiiði maafe tiga. They like peanut sauce. Baafal ngal no udditii. The door is open . Hiða faalaa ñaamugol? Do you want to eat? Here are some examples with the negative stative endings: Mi andaa Bubakar. I don’t know Bubakar. Baafal ngal ombaaki The door is not shut . O faalaaka teew. He doesn’t want meat.\n\nStative pronouns and the no particle\n\nWe have already seen one type of subject pronoun: we now add a second type, the stative, and to differentiate we’ll call the first the active pronoun. The stative pronoun is used with stative verbs. When using a noun (like Bubakar or Portojo on) instead of a pronoun in a stative sentence, you need the particle no.\n\nHimo waawi Pular\n\nHe can speak Pular.\n\nBubakar no waawi Pular.\n\nBubakar can speak Pular.\n\nMiðo weelaa.\n\nI am hungry.\n\nPortojo on no weelaa.\n\nThe Porto is hungry. Or you can leave out the noun/pronoun altogether, leaving the sentence vague as to what is being referred to. No moýýi! (That’s) good ! Negative sentences take the active pronoun, and don’t need the no. Maafe kon welaa. The sauce is not good . Mi weelaaka. I am not hungry . Moýýaa! (That’s) not good !\n\nSTATIVE VERB ENDINGS INFINITIVE STATIVE NEGATIVE IMPERATIVE\n\n-ugol -i -aa\n\n-u -en -ee\n\n-agol -ii -aaki\n\n-o -oðen -oðee\n\n-egol -aa -aaka µ\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nRight away we have a problem: The stative ending for -egol verbs is the same as the negative ending for -ugol verbs. This can be confusing. To make matters worse, in this chapter we have two different verbs that sound similar: weelegol, to be hungry; and welugol, to taste good. Miðo weelaa. I am hungry. Kosan welaa. Kosan doesn’t taste good.\n\nThree things can help you keep this straight: context; a slightly different stress pattern in pronunciation; and the difference between the active pronoun (mi) and the stative pronoun (miðo).\n\nSTATIVE PRONOUNS SUBJECT ACTIVE (SHORT) STATIVE (LONG) INDEPENDENT POSSESSIVE I mi miðo min an you a hiða an maa he/she o himo kanko makko\n\nwe (incl) en hiðen enen men we (excl) men meðen menen amen you (pl) on hiðon onon mo’on they åe hiåe kanåe maååe\n\n36 Competence 5 [ FOOD ]\n\nThe focused perfective\n\nIn English, the sentence “I went to the market today” could be the answer to several different questions: Who went to the market today? I went to the market today. Where did you go today? I went to the market today. When did you go to the market? I went to the market today. In English we emphasize one part of the sentence or another by stress or intonation; the word order doesn’t necessarily change. In Pular, the sentence gets rearranged to highlight, or focus on the new information being presented. Here are the same questions and answers in Pular: Ko hombo yahi ka maakiti hande? Ko min yahi ka maakiti hande. It is I who went to the market today Ko honto yahuða hande? Ko ka maakiti mi yahi hande. It is to the market that I went today. Ko honde tuma yahuða ka maakiti? Ko hande mi yahi ka maakiti. It is today that I went to the market. The focus form takes the active (short) pronoun (see page 35). The verb endings for the focused perfective are the same as for the stative (above), with one twist: When the pronoun is a, en, or on, a funny little inversion takes place.\n\nFOCUSED PERFECTIVE ENDINGS (WITH INVERSIONS)\n\n-ugol -agol -egol EXAMPLE (yahugol) ko ka maakiti mi yahi I mi … -i mi … -ii mi … -aa it is to the market\n\nI\n\nwent\n\nko ka maakiti yahuða you … -uða … -iða … -aða it is to the market\n\nyou\n\nwent\n\nko ka maakiti o yahi he/she o … -i o … -ii o … -aa it is to the market\n\nshe went\n\nko ka maakiti yahuðen we (incl) … -uðen … -iðen … -aðen it is to the market\n\nwe\n\nwent\n\nko ka maakiti men yahi we (excl) men … -i men … -ii men … -aa it is to the market\n\nwe\n\nwent\n\nko ka maakiti yahuðon you (pl) … -uðon … -iðon … -aðon it is to the market\n\nyou\n\nwent\n\nko ka maakiti åe yahi they åe … -i åe … -ii åe … -aa it is to the market\n\nthey went\n\nMost questions are asked and answered in focus form. Here are some examples. Ko hombo defi ñiiri ndin? Ko åeyngu an defi. Who cooked the food? My wife cooked it. Ko honde tuma hewtuðen? Ko e dix-heures hewtuðen. When did we arrive? We arrived at ten o’clock. Ko honto jooðiða? Ko ðoo mi jooðii. Where did you sit? I sat here. Ko honðun faalaðon? Ko ndiyan men faalaa. What do y’all want? We want water. Why is this called the perfective focus form? We’ll get into that when we talk about the imperfective, next chapter. For now, you should know that this form applies to questions and answers concerning completed (past) actions and states or qualities; it does not apply to actions that are happening in the present or in the future.\n\nCULTURAL NOTES\n\nFasting and Ramadan\n\nDuring the month of Sumayee (which falls at different times of the year, since the Islamic calendar is lunar), Muslim adults fast during the day and eat only at night. To fast is hoorugol.\n\nSome Portos choose to fast for one or several days, as a gesture of solidarity. If you’re not fasting, be as discrete as possible about eating or drinking during the day. If you can’t help eating in front of others, here are a few responses to the inevitable Enee, Porto, a hoorataa? (“Hey, Porto, aren’t you fasting?”): Mi alaa hoorude. I’m not fasting. Mi wawaali. I couldn’t hack it. Wonaa mi julðo. I’m not Muslim.\n\nCompetence 5 [ FOOD ] 37\n\nIntensifiers\n\nThere are about a hundred ways to say “very” or “totally” in Pular; many stative verbs have their very own intensifiers. Mi haari tef! I am totally full! Hiða kaani kas! You are very ugly! Ðan ndiyan no wojji cos! That water is totally red! There’s a lot of regional variation—for instance, some say Mi haari tew. Most intensifiers are used with one and only one stative verb: cos can only be used with wojjugol, “to be red.” Others can be used with a handful of related words: tef can be used with words having to do with fullness, like haarugol (to have one’s stomach full) and hewugol (to be full). Oto on no heewi tef! The car is completely full! A few other common intensifiers are given in the table to the right. There are dozens more; ask around if you’re interested. You don’t really need to know these, but the ability to use a few of these correctly impresses people far out of proportion to the difficulty of learning to do so.\n\nEXERCISES\n\nA. Questions & answers\n\nAnswer the following questions in complete sentences, using the responses provided.\n\n1 Ko hombo yahi ka saare?\n\n(my big brother) Ko koto an yahi ka saare. 2 Ko honðun faalaaða ñaamugol?

They must come! (I want them to come!) Yo mi addu ndiyan? Shall I bring water? Himo faala yo a looto. He wants you to bathe. Woo yo a yahu. (She said) you should go.\n\nThe construction yo + imperative is called the desiderative\n\nand has no direct equivalent in English. It extends the imperative so that it can be used with any person (me, you, them, us, him, etc.)\n\nwata is the opposite of yo; it tells someone not to do something. It can be applied to any person as well. Wata åe aru! They must not come! Let them not come!\n\nIt is often used in proverbs. Wata gerto yaw ko hoccata. A chicken shouldn’t sneer at what it gathers. (“Beggars can’t be choosers.”)\n\n38 Competence 5 [ FOOD ]\n\n14 Ko honðun woni ka nder suudu maa? (just a bed)\n\n15 Ko homåo jey ndee deftere? (your teacher)\n\n16 Ko hombo jogii saabiwal ngal?

Hours before dinnertime, you’re likely to be told to stay and eat (“it’s almost ready”). Feel free to accept or turn down these invitations as you see fit; they may or may not be just being polite.\n\nSome polite ways to decline: Mi haari. I’m full. Ko jooni mi ñaami. I just ate. Albarka. Thanks anyway.\n\nOn the flipside, a PCV living alone and cooking for themselves is unfortunately often unable to reciprocate all this spontaneous hospitality when unexpected guests arrive. Anyone who fails to understand this and gives you a hard time is either just teasing or being rude. In any event, here are some handy phrases: Mi defaali hande. I didn’t cook today. Ko seeda nii mi defi hande. I only cooked a little bit today. Fayda mi gaynii. I’m almost finished. Accee hakke. Sorry about that.\n\nCompetence 5 [ FOOD ] 39\n\n8 Ko ka saare men yahi.\n\n9 Ko kosan mi faalaa yarugol.\n\n10 Ko fii hiwragol moodi maa mi ari.\n\n11 Ko min jogii deftere makko.\n\n12 Ko Amadu piki boobo on.\n\n13 Ko maafe haako mi defi.\n\n14 Ko ka Aliu men hirtii.\n\n15 Ko lakree mi waði ka taabal. 16 Ko fii ñaamugol tun åe yahi ka makko. 17 Ko kaawu Idrissa jey suudu ndun.\n\n18 Ko Cerno Aliu woni moodi makko.\n\n19 Ko ka suudu åe woni.\n\n20 Ko miñiraaåe tato o mari.\n\nD.

I g a v e it t o Jo h n. ( I is a subject pronoun) John gave it to me . ( me is an object pronoun) In Pular, the object pronouns are different only in the singular. Here are all of our pronouns to date:\n\nOBJECT PRONOUNS\n\nS U B J E C T ACTIVE (SHORT) STATIVE (LONG) INDEPENDENT POSSESSIVE OBJECT\n\nI mi miðo min an lan you a hiða an maa ma he/she o himo kanko makko mo\n\nwe (incl) en hiðen enen men en we (excl) men meðen menen amen men you (pl) on hiðon onon mo’on on they åe hiåe kanåe maååe åe\n\nHere are some examples: Hoore nden no muusude lan.\n\n(My) head is hurting me .\n\nKo hombo jonni ma ðun?\n\nWho gave you that?\n\nJunnu mo lekki kin.\n\nGive him the medicine.\n\nKo kanko ñawndata men.\n\nHe will heal us . To make up for the fact that we only have three new pronouns, we have a number of irregular forms to deal with; we’ll only look at the two most common ones here. Exception : -u + lan = -an (imperative) wrong: Jonnu lan!\n\nright: Jonnan! Give it to me! wrong: Okkoru lan ndiyan mi yara.\n\nright: Okkoran ndiyan mi yara. Pass me some water to drink. Exception : -ay + ma = -ete (future: see page 57) wrong: Mi piyay ma!\n\nright: Mi piyete! I will beat you!\n\nTime vs. aspect\n\nVerb forms in English and French are organized around tense—past, present, and future actions. In Pular, they are organized around aspect—complete and incomplete actions. Very roughly, the past is described with perfective verb forms, while the future is described with imperfective verb forms. But it’s not quite that simple. Here is an overview of the basic verb forms in Pular. (Keep in mind that the translations given here are approximate; again, the Pular sentences are not as unambiguous about time as the English equivalents given. There are ways to specify the time of an action more precisely; see pages 82 and 98.)\n\nKEY WORDS\n\nwaawugol\n\nThe English word “can” (as in “I can”) and the verb “to be able to” is translated in Pular by the verb waawugol. Himo waawi dogugol. He can (really) run. Åe waawataa Pular. They can’t (speak) Pular.\n\n46 Competence 6 [ BODY ]\n\nPerfective (complete actions): Himo yahi ka saare.\n\nHe is gone to town. (stative)\n\nO yahi ka saare\n\nHe went to town. (narrative)\n\nO yahii ka saare.\n\nHe did go to town. (asserted)\n\nO yahaali ka saare.\n\nHe didn’t go to town. (negative)\n\nKo ka saare o yahi.\n\nIt’s to town that he went . (focused) Imperfective (incomplete actions): Himo yahude ka saare. He is going to town. (progressive) Himo yaha ka saare. He goes to town. (simple/habitual) O yahay ka saare. He will go to town. (future) O yahataa ka saare. He won’t go to town. (negative) Ko ka saare o yahata. It’s to town that he will go . (focused) Yahu ka saare. Go to town. (imperative) Note that the pronoun form used (long, as in himo yahi; or short as in o yahi) changes the meaning of the verb form. A complete table of endings is given on page 109. We’ve already seen the focused perfective and the stative; now we’ll look at the focused imperfective and the progressive.\n\nThe focused imperfective\n\nThe imperfective focus form is used to discuss incomplete actions—generally taking place now or in the future—and not states or complete (past) actions. Ko honto o yahata? Where is he going? OR Where will he go? Ko ka saare o yahata. It is to town that he is going. OR It is to town that he will go. As with the focused perfective, when the pronoun is a, on, or en there is an inversion.\n\nFOCUSED IMPERFECTIVE ENDINGS (WITH INVERSIONS)\n\n-ugol -agol -egol EXAMPLE (yahugol) ko ka maakiti mi yahata I mi … -ata mi … -oto mi … -ete it is to the market\n\nI\n\nwill go\n\nko ka maakiti yahataa you … -ataa … -otoða … -eteða it is to the market\n\nyou\n\nwill go\n\nko ka maakiti o yahi he/she o … -ata o … -oto o … -ete it is to the market\n\nshe will go\n\nko ka maakiti yahaten we (incl) … -aten … -otoðen … -eteðen it is to the market\n\nwe\n\nwill go\n\nko ka maakiti men yahata we (excl) men … -ata men … -oto men … -ete it is to the market\n\nwe\n\nwill go\n\nko ka maakiti yahaton you (pl) … -aton … -otoðon … -eteðon it is to the market\n\nyou\n\nwill go\n\nko ka maakiti åe yahata they åe … -ata åe … -oto åe … -ete it is to the market\n\nthey will go\n\nAgain, questions are asked and answered in the focus form.\n\nCompetence 6 [ BODY ] 47\n\nKo honðun musata ma? Ko reedu ndun muusata lan.\n\nWhat hurts you? My stomach hurts me.\n\nKo honto hirtotoða? Ko ka Cerno Aliu mi hirtoto.\n\nWhere will you eat supper? I’ll eat supper at Cerno Aliu’s.\n\nKo honno inneteða? Ko Mamadu Aliu mi innete.\n\nWhat are you called? I am called Mamadu Aliu.\n\nThe progressive\n\nThe progressive is used to denote an action which is currently underway. Miðo ñaamude. I am eating. Notice that it takes the long (stative) pronoun in the affirmative. The negative of the progressive uses the short pronoun + alaa. Mi alaa ñaamude. I am not eating. Here is the progressive in the context of all the verb endings we’ve learned so far:\n\nPROGRESSIVE VERB ENDINGS\n\nPERFECTIVE IMPERFECTIVE\n\nINFINITIVE\n\nFOCUS/ STATIVE NEGATIVE PROGRESSIVE FOCUS IMPERATIVE\n\n-ugol -i -aa -ude -ata\n\n-u -en -ee\n\n-agol -ii -aaki -aade -oto\n\n-o -oðen -oðee\n\n-egol -aa -aaka -eede -ete µ\n\nSome more examples: Miðo soodude bireedi.\n\nI am buying bread.\n\nHimo lootaade.\n\nHe is washing himself.\n\nMen alaa cippaade ka oto.\n\nWe’re not getting out of the car.\n\nHimo mooreede ton.\n\nShe is having her hair braided there. The progressive form of the verb is technically another infinitive form: yahugol t o g o (infinitiv e /v e r b al n o u n ) yahude going (infinitive/progressive) Both infinitives can be used following helper verbs: Miðo faala yahude. Miðo faala yahugol. } I want to go. While both of these are acceptable, some speakers prefer one over the other.\n\nKEY WORDS\n\nwonugol\n\nThe focus form as it has been presented thus far"
