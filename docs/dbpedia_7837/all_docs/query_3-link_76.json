        "text": "This paper attempts to penetrate the recesses of the Arabic and English languages with a view to outline the historical development and evolution of the two languages and to compare the state of Arabic language and the language families of Europe in the past, present and future. The paper also deals with teaching of Arabic as a Foreign Language (i.e. to non-native speakers) and the difficulties that entails and the obstacles encountered in its written form, sentence structure and grammatical patterns.\n\nThis paper investigates Arabic and English inflectional morphology with a view to identifying the similarities and differences between them. The differences between the two languages might be the main reason for making errors by Arab EFL learners. Predicting the sources of such errors might help both teachers and learners to overcome these problems. By identifying the morphological differences between the two languages, teachers will determine how and what to teach, on the one hand, and students will know how and what to focus on when learning the target language, on the other.\n\nThe current study aimed to explore derivation as a linguistic phenomenon between the English and Arabic languages and to identify its most prominent characteristics and divisions. It also sought to deduce the main similarities and differences between the two languages in this regard from both typological and contrastive perspectives. To achieve the main aim, this study adopted a descriptive analytical approach. In fact, the analysis of morphological phenomenon across disparate languages is of linguistic value, as it enriches the linguistic repertoire with some insights from comparative studies, which are considered scarce in this field. Findings of this study shows that the common features between the Arabic and English languages is that they derive new forms of words from a single root word with an association in meaning between the produced words. However, the derivation process in Arabic is more complex and diverse compared with English, in which derivation can mainly be archived through affixation. Additionally, this study revealed that the distinction between the two languages may result in some translation problems, as some derived words in Arabic have no equivalent in the English language. Accordingly, some solutions to this dilemma were suggested throughout this research, including the application of established translation techniques proposed by Newamark (1988) and other translation scholars, such as paraphrasing, transference, notes, and synonymy. Finally, it is worth noting that exploring the similarities and differences between languages has important pedagogical implications, as this might contribute to facilitating the learning and teaching process of a foreign language."
