        "meta_description": "Fula is a language of Guinea. Roughly 31% of the population there speak it as a first language. The Fula language is spoken over a large area of West Africa. The major dialects known as Pular, Pulaar and Fulfulde are considered by Ethnologue to be separate languages, but most linguists consider Fula to be a single language. Wilson (1989) is quoted on Wikipedia stating that \"travellers over wide distances never find communication impossible\". There are roughly 14 million speakers in 17 African territories. Over a million speakers live in each of Guinea, Senegal, Nigeria, Niger and Mali.",

Estimating the number of speakers of a language is fraught with difficulty on several levels (last accessed January 2009). We aim to map as complete data as possible and therefore estimate data for missing values. The language numbers we use and publish are rough estimates, and should not be taken as definitive. In some cases, missing data for very small territories is not used in the cartogram and that area is therefore omitted in the map.\n\nFurther notes on the data, as well as all modifications to the original data source are noted in our data sheets.\n\nDownload data file"
