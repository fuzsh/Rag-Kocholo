        "text": "Whole genome diversity and population structure of the Fulani people\n\nWe selected 23 Fulani samples from 8 countries in the Sahelian belt. To this group of samples, 17 samples from other African populations and 3 European individuals have been added, for a total of 43 samples, representing 14 different populations, 9 African linguistic sub-families and 13 sampling countries, analyzed by high coverage (> 30 ×) whole genome sequencing (Table 1). The 43 samples presented here were merged with 771 published whole genome sequences (including 2 additional Fulani from Cameroon) from four different projects, namely the study by Fan and colleagues [19], the Simons Genome Diversity Project (SGDP) [30], the high-coverage sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project [39] and the whole genomes from the Human Genome Diversity Projects (HGDP) [31]. The published samples have been selected to represent relevant ethnic groups and geographic regions for our study (Additional File 1, Supplementary Table S1) to create a modern dataset including a total of 4,143,934 markers (1,907,678 after LD pruning) from 814 individuals (Fig. 1).\n\nFirst, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA, Fig. 2): in general, most of the variability can be explained by geographic location and ethnic group affiliations, with the first PC separating the southern African Khoe-San speaking individuals and some central African Rainforest hunter-gatherers from all the others, while the second PC separates Africans and non Africans, according to previous studies [18,30].\n\nLooking at the PCA in more detail, we can observe that three groups of samples form long stretches from central/western African cluster to northern African and Eurasian clusters: 1) the eastern African samples (shades of green); 2) the African admixed (grey); 3) the Fulani individuals (red/orange triangles).\n\nThe eastern African group is the most dispersed along both PC1 and PC2, with people from the Great Lakes region (dark green) nearer to the Bantu groups (including Luhya) and people from the Horn (light green) shifted towards the Middle East/Europe along PC2, consistently with their known Eurasiatic ancestry component [41]. The second group is composed by the two African admixed populations, African Caribbean in Barbados (ACB) and African in Southwest US (ASW) from the 1000 Genomes project [29]: consistently with their known history related to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, these samples occupy a long stretch along PC2, with some individuals tightly clustering with western/central African people and some others shifted towards the Europeans, while their variation is very low along PC1 [42]. Finally, the third group is represented by the Fulani people (orange/red triangles). Differently from the two previous groups, the Fulani cluster is more homogeneous along both PCs, occupying a defined region in the PCA space, between western/central Africa and the non-African regions along PC2. Along the PC1, the position of the Fulani cluster is above the line of the northern African sample, differently from eastern African and African admixed groups that lie below. This observed difference between the Fulani and the other two groups with a well-known Eurasian component may suggest a different source of the non-sub-Saharan ancestry in the Fulani genomes, in addition to differences between the groups contributing to their sub-Saharan ancestry. Despite the Fulani general homogeneity, it is worth noting that not all the individuals fall in the Fulani cluster: indeed, some of them fall in the western/central African groups or among the African-admixed samples, suggesting that admixture events between Fulani and different neighboring populations may have shaped their genetic pool at some extent [15,43].\n\nWe further investigate the population structure of the Fulani people compared to the other African and non-African groups by performing an admixture analysis [44], for K from 2 to 10 (Additional File 3, Supplementary Figure S1). For the sake of clarity, hereafter we refer to the genetic ancestry components with the name of the regions/populations mainly representing them. At K=2, the African (blue) and non-African (orange) ancestry components are clearly separated, while K=3 distinguishes the African hunter-gatherer ancestry (yellow), as previously observed [45]. At K=4, when the cross validation error minimizes, we can see a northern African/Middle Eastern ancestry component (light blue), different from the European one: interestingly, this component is observed both in Fulani and in the eastern African groups, that have a known admixture history with the northern Africa/Middle East [46,41]. On the other hand, this ancestry component is absent in the African Admixed ACB and ASW [29], which instead show a non-African ancestry of European origin. At K=5, we can observe an eastern African ancestry component (dark blue), different from the northern African/Middle Eastern one and present in the groups from eastern Africa. At K=6, the northern African ancestry component (purple) is distinguished from the Middle Eastern one: among the Fulani, this new component replaces the old one and represents the second most frequent component (37% on average). Higher Ks further define the Fulani sub-Saharan ancestry component (violet), that ca be defined as a Senegambian component since it is representative (∼ 100%) of these people (i.e. Wolof, Mende and Mandenka), while it decreases south-and eastward. This admixture analysis further confirms the presence of two subgroups among our Fulani samples, clearly differentiated by their ancestry composition. On the basis of both the PCA and admixture results, we then subset the Fulani in two groups: hereafter, FulaniA and FulaniB will refer respectively to the samples within the main Fulani PCA/admixture cluster or outside it (Additional File 1, Supplementary Table S1).\n\nNew clues on Fulani origins from ancient DNA\n\nIn order to shed light on the origin of Fulani, especially of their non-sub-Saharan ancestry component, we merged the modern dataset described above with the Allen Ancient DNA Resource [40], selecting only the ancient and modern samples from the same macroregions as the individuals in our modern dataset (Additional File 1, Supplementary Table S2). First, we performed a PCA by projecting the ancient samples on the principal components obtained only from the modern samples (Additional File 4). The PCA recapitulates what has been observed from Fig. 1, with ancient individuals mainly falling into the genetic variability ranges of modern samples from the same regions.\n\nWe then performed an admixture analysis on the same dataset (Additional File 3, Supplementary Figure S2). Focusing on the Fulani groups, we can see that the FulaniA cluster is differentiated from other sub-Saharan groups and from the FulaniB since K=2, showing an average 25% of the non-sub-Saharan ancestry component (azure), similarly to the African Admixed groups. This non-sub-Saharan component is further defined with increasing K values; at K=5 (lowest cross validation error), we can see that the FulaniA cluster shows 3 non-sub-Saharan ancestry components: 1) an azure ancestry component, possibly corresponding to the Anatolian Neolithic (AN); 2) a blue ancestry component, representing the Iran Neolithic/Caucasus hunter-gatherers (CHG); 3) a negligible red ancestry component (less than 2%), corresponding to the Western hunter-gatherers (WHG) (Fig. 3).\n\nThe same components are also observed in the FulaniB and in both the African Admixed groups, but at drastically different proportions, suggesting that these groups experienced different evolutionary trajectories. At K=6 (second lowest cross validation error), we observe that the non-sub-Saharan ancestry component in FulaniA is mainly characterized by the new orange component. Interestingly, this component is typical of north-western African individuals older than 8000 BP (more specifically, Taforalt and IAM individuals) [47,48] and can be also observed in other Sahelian/Eastern African groups, while it is virtually absent from African Admixed and other sub-Saharan populations (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the Iranian Neolithic blue ancestry component is not represented anymore among FulaniA. Higher Ks confirmed this pattern where FulaniA share a non-negligible portion of their non sub-Saharan ancestry with ancient northern African people. As for the FulaniA sub-Saharan ancestry component (yellow), this analysis confirmed the link with the Wolof and Mende groups already highlighted by the admixture based on modern data only.\n\nWe further explored the link between Fulani (A and B) and ancient people by performing D-statistics in the form D(Fulani, sub-Saharan Africa, Eurasia/North Africa, Chimpanzee), where a) Fulani were alternatively represented by FulaniA or FulaniB; b) excluding the Southern Africa and Northern European regions from sub-Saharan Africa and Eurasia/North Africa respectively; c) testing both FulaniA and FulaniB also as sub-Saharan groups and d) using Chimpanzee as outgroup. Overall, the Eurasia/North Africa pool tended to share more alleles with both Fulani clusters rather than central/western African people and less compared to eastern African populations (both ancient and modern). However, when focusing on the relationships between the two Fulani clusters and the ancient north-western African individuals in the form D(FulaniA, FulaniB, ancient North-western Africa, Chimpanzee), we observed that FulaniA were closer to all the 3 ancient north-western African groups than FulaniB (Additional File 1, Table S3 and Additional File 3, Figure S3). When analyzed by qpWave/qpAdm framework with two putative sources, both Fulani groups were modeled by an ancient sample from Cameroon (about 7000 BP) and the Early Neolithic Moroccans (about 6000 BP), with Iberomaurusian-like component being higher among FulaniA (Additional File 1, Table S3A). In addition, FulaniA were also successfully modeled by modern Berbers and modern Sahelian people. When 3 putative sources were tested, we observed that FulaniA can be only modeled by the same two previous ancient sources plus the eastern Sahelian Agew at approximately the same proportions, while FulaniB could be successfully modeled by two sub-Saharan sources and a northern African one, with the latter accounting for no more than 27% (Additional File 1, Table S3B). Finally, we also performed 10 admixture graphs varying the number of admixture edges from 2 to 5 and retained the three graphs characterized by the lowest score, testing only the Fulani A. For all the inferred graphs FulaniA were modeled as composed of two main ancestries. The first ancestry (between 60% and 70%) is close to Western African groups related to Mende from Sierra Leone (MSL). This group also harbored a minor proportion from a ghost population which stems as an outgroup of all the other populations analyzed, as already suggested in previous studies [49]. The second ancestry (more than 30%) was derived from an unsampled group close to Iberomaurusian samples, modeled as a sister group of ancient Northern Africans, or alternatively, as an outgroup of all the “Eurasian-ancestry” enriched groups (Additional File 3, Supplementary Figure S4). This may suggest that, at least part of the non-sub-Saharan ancestry in present day Fulani might have an ancient origin, and is not exclusively derived by migrations in the last two millennia.\n\nA Green Sahara story\n\nMost recent studies based on the genome-wide variability suggested that the origin of the non-sub-Saharan ancestry of Fulani traces back to relatively recent times (1800-300 BP), after admixture events between a western African and northern African/southern European source [15,18,37,38]. Here, we analyzed the Fulani genomes in the frame of the worldwide genetic variability considering both modern and ancient individuals. In this context, the analysis of aDNA allowed us to characterize the non-sub-Saharan ancestry component in the Fulani in more detail, shedding new light on its origin. By comparing the Fulani genetic diversity with those of the large number of ancient individuals currently available [40] through an admixture analysis (K=6, Fig. 3), we observed that their non-sub-Saharan ancestry is characterized by a component observed in extremely high proportions (virtually 100%) also in ancient Morroccans older than 8000 BP [47,50], and an azure Levantine component. We could also see a non-negligible fraction of the WHG red component, as in the Late Neolithic Moroccan individuals, possibly arrived from Iberia to the Maghreb [47]. On the other hand, Fulani lacked the Iran Neolithic/CHG blue component, which was observed instead in modern northern Africans, Middle Easterners and Europeans. This pattern of ancestry components can be hardly explained solely by recent admixture between western African and northern African groups. Indeed, in this case, we would have expected to observe also the Iran Neolithic/CHG blue component in the Fulani, since this component is present in all the modern northern African, European and Middle Eastern samples. So, the admixture event(s) that forged the non-sub-Saharan ancestry in Fulani should have occurred before the arrival of this component in the areas to the north of the Sahara. It is challenging to obtain exact time estimates for such events [51], considering that they were probably followed by later admixture events involving the same or very similar source populations [15,18,37,38]. However, considering the results of the admixture analysis (K=6), we can try to define broad time windows. Indeed, considering the presence of the azure (Levantine) and red (WHG) components in Fulani, in addition to the orange (Iberomaurusian) one, and the absence of the blue (Iran Neolithic/CHG) component, we can postulate that their non-sub-Saharan component dates back to about 8000-7000 years ago from a source population similar (except for the blue component) to the Late Neolithic Moroccans (dated about 5000 BCE, considering their radiocarbon time estimates) (Additional 2, Supplementary Table S2). In addition, the qpAdm analysis also points to a period corresponding to 7000 BP considering the radiocarbon time estimates of the two ancient sources that successfully modelled both FulaniA and FulaniB (Additional 2, Supplementary Table S4). Intriguingly, this time window corresponds to the period of the last Green Sahara.\n\nThe Sahara has played and still plays an important role in the population history of the African continent. Currently, it acts as a strong geographic barrier because of its arid environment; however, during its humid phases (called Green Sahara), it became a fertile and lush land inhabited by different species, including humans [10]. The last of these fertile periods occurred approximately between 12000 and 5000 BP, during the Holocene climatic optimum, and the archaeological findings from that time are characterized by different material cultures [9], testifying the rich diversity of the populations in that region. Indeed, the fertile environment of the Sahara, with extensive hydrogeological networks connecting rivers and lakes, may have promoted extensive contacts between the different groups settled in this area. The last Green Sahara was also characterized by social and cultural changes, such as the spreading of pastoralism and farming, both developed locally or arrived from the Middle East to northeastern Africa between 7000 and 6000 years ago [1,52,53].\n\nIn this scenario, the formation of the non-sub-Saharan component in Fulani should not be interpreted as a simple admixture event between a western African source group and a northern African one. On the contrary, we should consider that many different groups inhabited the Saharan area at that time [53,54] and the favorable climatic conditions could have allowed a relatively continuous gene flow between them (Fig. 5), as also suggested by the presence of a western African ancestry component in the Iberomaurusians [50] and in addition to the main northeast-to-northwest and northeast-to-east routes [48,55,56].\n\nThese Saharan people may have actually been the ancestors of present-day Sahelian people, including Fulani. This is also supported by our admixture analysis, showing that also the Neolithic pastoralists from Kenya and the modern central Sahelian groups showed the orange and azure components at non-negligible proportions (Fig. 3 and Additional File 3, Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover, the absence of the blue component in the modern Nilo-Saharan groups from both central and eastern Sahel further confirms this hypothesis, since it has been proposed that the Nilo-Saharan languages were much more widespread in the Green Sahara region during the last humid phase, to be replaced by Afro-Asiatic languages only in more recent times (about 1500 years ago) [9,53]. In this context, it is also worth noting that a recent whole genome study further confirmed the presence of a shared ancestry between Fulani and Afro-Asiatic speakers from Eastern Africa [37]. Interestingly, it has also been proposed that the Green Sahara area (more precisely the lake Chad basin, occupied by the Megalake Chad at the time [9]) was also the homeland of the Niger-Congo (i.e. the language currently spoken by Fulani) about 7000 years ago, intriguingly corresponding to the possible time estimate of the Fulani non-sub-Saharan components. This language then spread westwards (and eastwards to a lesser extent) replacing the pre-existing languages [57].\n\nThe exact genetic ancestry composition of the “ghost” Saharan populations cannot be assessed without ancient individuals from that area at that time; however, on the basis of the ancient data currently available, we can propose that they were genetically similar to the Late Neolithic Moroccans here analyzed, although this group already shows the Iranian Neolithic/CHG component that was probably more diluted further south, while the yellow western African component was possibly present at higher proportions (Fig. 5).\n\nWith the end of the Green Sahara and the subsequent gradual desertification of that region, the Saharan groups moved westwards, eastwards, southwards or northwards, as also suggested by the Y chromosome data [12]. This phenomenon was not abrupt and was slightly longer in the central Sahel rather than in the east depending on the local hydrogeological conditions; according to the archaeological evidence, the changing climate conditions led to changes in the socio-economic organization of the different groups. In particular, it has been suggested that cattle pastoralism became the predominant form of subsistence at that time since it was a more reliable source of food, leading to the establishment of a pan-Saharan cattle cult, as testified by rock paintings and rituals that spread westwards with the pastoral groups in search of new pastures [54,58]. This scenario may also reconcile the apparent contrasting evidence from different genetic systems linking Fulani with sub-Saharan, northern African, European or eastern African groups [12,15,17,37,38,43,59–61]; indeed, if we assume the past presence of Green Saharan populations with extensive contacts, it is not surprising that these groups could share genetic affinities. With the Sahara desertification and the following different population dynamics, the genetic differentiation between the different groups may have led to the loss or maintenance of different genetic variants because of genetic drift and/or selection.\n\nAll this bulk of data seems to point to a Green Sahara origin of the Fulani with regard to their non-sub-Saharan component. Their ancestors were possibly Saharan cattle herders that moved westwards in response to the changing climate and then mixed with local people. Later, the peculiar Fulani lifestyle, historically characterized by nomadism and endogamy [59,62], and their population size dramatic decrease [37] could have prevented the dilution of this ancient “Green Saharan” ancestry component that can be still identified.\n\nFinally, both Fulani clusters show the same ancestry components, pointing to a common ancestry of the two groups, although at different proportions, suggesting different population dynamics.\n\nModern dataset\n\nSelection of published whole genome sequences\n\nIn order to place our data in a broader context, we collected and analyzed 771 published WGS sequences, for a total of 814 individuals.\n\nMore specifically, our modern dataset includes samples from 5 different projects: 1) the samples from this study; 2) the samples from Fan et al. [19]; 3) a subset of relevant samples from the high coverage version of the 1000 Genomes Project [69]; 4) a subset of relevant samples from the Simons Genetic Diversity Project (SGDP) [30]; 5) a subset of relevant samples from the whole genomes from Human Genetic Diversity Project (HGDP) [31]. For all the datasets, the starting files were VCFs.\n\nLiftover\n\nSequencing data from two published datasets were aligned against the hg38/GRCh38 human reference sequence [31,69]. In order to make the variant list comparable, these VCF data were converted to the hg19/GRCh37 coordinates using the LiftoverVcf tool in Picard [66].\n\nSample selection for SGDP, HGDP and 1000 Genomes project\n\nThe variant datasets from the three worldwide variation projects [30,31,69] are available as multi-sample VCFs, however only a subset of samples was relevant for our study. For the selection, we focused on different ethnic groups and geographical regions in Africa, Europe and Asia. Moreover, since some populations were over-represented with a large sample size, we randomly selected 25 individuals from each large population in each dataset to make their sample size comparable with the number of Fulani individuals (25). After these selection steps, the samples to be excluded were discarded using bcftools [70]. These steps have been performed on each dataset separately.\n\nAfrican datasets\n\nThe two African datasets, i.e. the one analyzed in this study and the one from Fan et al. [19], were organized with one VCF for each sample. First, we had to create a multisample VCF for each dataset, merging the samples with bcftools. Since each individual may have private variants, this can create a large amount of missing data when merging different individuals. However, considering the high quality of the sequencing data, we can reliably state that the positions not listed in the individual VCFs show the reference state in the respective samples and so they have been coded as homozygous reference during the merging step using the-0 option in the bcftools view command [70].\n\nData merging and SNP filtering\n\nThe 5 datasets have been first analyzed in two batches: 1) datasets originally in the hg19/GRCh37 assembly, i.e. this study, SGDP and Fan et al. [19,30]; 2) datasets originally in hg38/GRCh38 and then converted by liftover, i.e. HGDP and 1000 Genomes project [31,69].\n\nThe datasets in each batch have been merged with bcftools [70], setting variants that were not present in one or more datasets as missing in the corresponding individuals. Then, only the biallelic SNPs on the autosomes have been kept and the strict callable mask from the 1000 Genome Project [29] was applied. After this step, the two batches have been merged together using bcftools [70], averaging the depth (DP) and mapping quality (MQ) values across all the samples to create a single multisample VCF. In order to discard false variant calls, we applied the following filters: 1) minor allele frequency ≥ 1%; 2) QUAL > 30; 3) average MQ > 40, leaving more than 12 million variant calls.\n\nFinal modern datasets\n\nThe modern dataset obtained in the previous steps was then further filtered to create two different datasets used for the haplotype-based or frequency-based analyses.\n\nFor the haplotype-based methods, the modern dataset was filtered to discard variants missing in at least one sample using the --geno 0 option in plink [71], for a total of 4143934 SNPs.\n\nFor the allele frequency based analyses, the modern dataset has been filtered using plink [71] to discard the variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and missing in more than 10% of samples. The LD filter was applied using the --indep-pairwise command with a window size of 200, shifting by 25 SNPs and a maximum pairwise r2 threshold of 0.5, while the missingness filter was applied using the --geno 0.1 option, for a total of 1907678 SNPs.\n\nAncient and modern dataset\n\nWe merged our LD-pruned modern dataset with the modern and ancient genome-wide SNP data available from the Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR, V44.3) [40] using plink [71]. First, we discarded the AADR samples that were present also in our modern dataset from the published genetic projects [19,30,31,69] and kept only individuals from the same geographic areas as the modern dataset (Additional File 2, Supplementary Table S2). Then, the two sets of data were merged based on common variants, for a total of 226222 SNPs in 2615 samples. Additional ancient samples to be used as comparison or outgroups have been added for specific analyses, as explained in the corresponding method sections.\n\nPCA\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was performed on our LD-pruned modern dataset using the smartpca tool from EIGENSOFT version 7.2.0 [72]. We also performed the PCA on the modern + ancient dataset by estimating the principal components from modern individuals only and projecting the ancient samples onto such components.\n\nAdmixture\n\nPatterns of population structure were explored performing a model-based individual ancestry analysis using ADMXITURE v1.3.0 [44], running 10 independent iterations for K ancestral clusters ranging from 2 to 10 with the unsupervised approach for the modern dataset. For the modern + ancient dataset, the modern samples were first pseudohaploidized to make them consistent with the ancient pseudohaploid data. Then, the ADMIXTURE analysis was performed as described above.\n\nf statistics, qpWave/qpAdm and admixture graph\n\nThe D statistics have been estimated using ADMIXTOOLS version 7.0.1 [73] on the modern + ancient dataset after adding the chimpanzee and Neanderthal data (for a total of 2626 individuals) from the AADR (V44.3) [40] to be used as outgroups. In order to describe the ancestry of Fulani samples as a combination of prehistoric/modern groups, we used the qpWave/qpAdm framework. In detail, for each Fulani group, given a set of left and right populations, and for the number of left sources K {2,3}: a) we evaluated if the right samples can be used to significantly discriminate the provided sources, using qpWave. Right populations present in sources were excluded for that specific test; b) if step a) provided a significant p value < 0.01, we used qpWave to evaluate if the target population could be described as a combination of K sources; c) if b) provided a p value > 0.01, we used qpAdm to describe the target as a mixture of the K sources employed for that specific experiment. Given the high rate of missingness in some of our tested samples we used the option ‘‘allsnps=YES’’. As left populations, we used: “GWD”, “MSL”, “Cameroon_SMA_6000-3000BCE”, “Bantu”, “Mada”, “Bulala”, “Agew”, “ESN”, “Berbers”, “Morocco_EN_8000-6000BCE”, “Morocco_LN_6000-3000BCE”, “Bedouin”, “Turkey_N_8000-6000BCE”. As right populations, we used: “San”, “Czech_Vestonice”, “Spain_ElMiron_before10000BCE”, “Italy_North_Villabruna_HG_before10000BCE”, “WHG”, “ONG.SG”, “Han”, “Papuan.SDG”, “Russia_Ust_Ishim_HG_published.DG”, “Russia_Kostenki”, “Russia_MA1_HG.SG”, “Chimp.REF”, “Neanderthal”, “Karitiana.SDG”, “Iran_GanjDareh_N_8000-6000BCE”.\n\nFor the admixture graph, we harnessed the function “graph_Auto”, implemented in admixtools 2 [74], to model the evolutionary history and admixture edges of each Fulani group, together with a set of representative populations (“Morocco_Iberomaurusian_before10000BCE”, “Mbuti”,“MSL”,,“Morocco_LN_6000-3000BCE”, “Yoruba”, “Altai_Neanderthal.DG”, “Chimp.REF”, “Israel_Natufian_before10000BCE”, “Iran_GanjDareh_N_10000-8000BCE”). We estimated graphs varying the number of admixture edges from 2 to 5, and repeated the whole process 10 times. For each admixture edge the three most supported graphs were retained and plotted.\n\nIdentity-by-descent and runs of homozygosity\n\nThe identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis has been performed on the non-LD-pruned modern dataset using the software IBIS version 1.20.6 [75] with the default parameters. The runs of homozygosity (ROH) analysis was performed on the same dataset using plink after slightly modifying the parameters previously used for Sahelian populations [59] as follows: --homozyg-snp 30 --homozyg-kb 300 --homozyg-density 30 --homozyg-window-snp 30 --homozyg-gap 1000 --homozyg-window-het 1--homozyg-window-missing 15 --homozyg-window-threshold 0.05. The raw outputs have been manipulated and plotted using the ggplot2 and dplyr packages in R version 4.1.3."
