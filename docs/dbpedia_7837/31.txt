Fulfulde is a West African subgroup of the Niger-Congo language family with numerous dialects spread over a wide area. The language has different names depending on the dialect or region. The eastern dialects are often called Ful, Fula, Fulani or Fulfulde. The western dialects are mostly based on French and are spelled Peul, Peulh, Pulaar or Poular.

Origins and development of the language

The Fulbe and their language have been present in the Sahel region for centuries. Their origins are often traced back to the Senegal River Valley, from where they spread across large parts of West Africa through nomadic cattle breeding and trade. These migratory movements contributed to the spread of the language and led to a strong diversification of dialects.

Fulfulde is known for its complex system of nominal classes, which functions similarly to many Bantu languages. These classes influence both the form of nouns and the verbs and adjectives associated with them. The verbal system is also complex, with a variety of aspects, modes and tenses to convey different nuances of action.

The language has evolved over time, absorbing influences from Arabic, French and, more recently, English. These influences also reflect the colonial and post-colonial history of many Fulbe peoples.

The writing of the Fulfulde has produced different writing systems in different regions, including the Latin alphabet and the Arabic Ajami writing system. Educational policy initiatives and cultural organizations are increasingly seeking to standardize and promote the language in order to strengthen and maintain its use in formal educational contexts.
