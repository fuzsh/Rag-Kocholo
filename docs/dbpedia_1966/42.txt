Hiro Knives Co., Ltd. in Seki-City, under the supervision of Master craftsman and designer Masui Hiroaki. Master Masui was born in Seki (The cutlery making capital of Japan) in 1944 and began his knife-making career at the age of 16 years old. In his youth, in addition to learning knife-making techniques, he also studied design at the Musashino School of Art (Now, Musashino Art University) in Tokyo.

Master Masui originally specialize in producing high quality outdoor sports and hunting knives that were based on his own original designs.

For many years, we have been impressed by Master Masuiâ€™s passion and energy for knife making and we love his lively spirit and his inventive ideas and designs. His knife making philosophy is very simple, but is not easily achieved by ordinary craftsmen.
