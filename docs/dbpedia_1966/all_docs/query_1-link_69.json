A total of 2,106 elderly Japanese (749 men and 1,357 women), aged 60-79 years, were enrolled in a cross-sectional investigation study. Anthropometric parameters and physical fitness, i.e., muscle strength and flexibility, were measured. Of the 2,106 subjects, 569 subjects (302 men and 267 women) were further evaluated for aerobic exercise level, using the ventilatory threshold (VT). Muscle strength in subjects in their 70s was significantly lower than that in subjects in their 60s in both sexes. Two hundred and twenty-nine men (30.6%) and 540 women (39.8%) were taking no medications. In men, anthropometric parameters were significantly lower and muscle strength, flexibility, and work rate at VT were significantly higher in subjects without medications than these values in subjects with medications. In women, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and abdominal circumference were significantly lower, and muscle strength was significantly higher in subjects without medications than these values in subjects with medications. This mean value may provide a useful database for evaluating anthropometric parameters and physical fitness in elderly Japanese subjects.\n\nRelations of nutritional intake to age, sex and body mass index in Japanese elderly patients with type 2 diabetes: the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshimura, Yukio; Kamada, Chiemi; Takahashi, Keiko; Kaimoto, Tae; Iimuro, Satoshi; Ohashi, Yasuo; Araki, Atsushi; Umegaki, Hiroyuki; Sakurai, Takashi; Ito, Hideki\n\n2012-04-01\n\nTo determine the status of nutritional intake in elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes aged 65 years or older, and to clarify relations of nutritional intake to age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Clinical parameters and nutritional intake were investigated and compared in 912 (417 men, 495 women) elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes registered to the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial. The mean daily energy intake of patients was 1802 kcal in men and 1661 kcal in women, respectively. The energy intakes per kilogram of standard bodyweight in both sexes and the energy intakes per kilogram of present bodyweight in men increased significantly with age. The protein : fat : carbohydrate (PFC) energy ratio (%E) was 15.2:25.4:59.5 in men, and 15.7:25.8:58.6 in women, respectively. Grain, oil, alcohol and soft drink intakes were higher in men than in women. Potato, fruit and green vegetable intakes were higher in women than in men. Fruit intake showed a significant age-related increase in men. In women, there was an age-related significant decrease of meat intake. An increase of BMI correlated with a significant increase in bodyweight, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, triglycerides and diastolic blood pressure. The mean energy intake of three BMI groups, lean (BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2)), normal (18.5 kg/m(2) = BMI < 25 kg/m(2) ) and obese (25 kg/m(2) = BMI), were 1625, 1796 and 1839 kcal in men, and 1655, 1647 and 1685 kcal in women, respectively. However, BMI-related increase of energy intake did not reach statistically significant levels in both sexes. Energyintake per kilogram of present bodyweight decreased as BMI increased in both sexes. Energy intake per kilogram of standard bodyweight increased significantly as BMI increased in men only, but not in women. There were no differences in PFC energy ratios among the three BMI groups. In contrast, intake of soft drinks in men increased significantly as BMI increased.

Subjects comprised 403 men and 373 women aged 60-81 years at baseline who participated in the follow-up study at least once. Bean, soy product and soy isoflavone intake was assessed using a 3-day dietary record at baseline. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MMSE scores of â¤23 were used to define cognitive impairment. The relationship between bean, soy product and soy isoflavone intake and cognitive impairment was assessed using a generalized estimating equation. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for cognitive impairment with a 1 s.d. increase in total bean, total soybean and total soy isoflavone intakes were 0.48 (0.28-0.81; pâ=â0.006), 0.51 (0.32-0.83; pâ=â0.007), and 0.55 (0.32-0.93; pâ=â0.026), respectively, in women. Total soybean and soy isoflavone intake might decrease the risk of cognitive impairment in elderly Japanese women.\n\nPlasma TNF-Î± Is Associated with Inflammation and Nutrition Status in Community-Dwelling Japanese Elderly.\n\nPubMed\n\nOe, Yukiko; Mochizuki, Kazuki; Miyauchi, Rie; Misaki, Yasumi; Kasezawa, Nobuhiko; Tohyama, Kazushige; Goda, Toshinao\n\n2015-01-01\n\nInflammation has been suggested to play an important role in age-related chronic diseases and disability, and it is associated with nutritional status including obesity and malnutrition. While numerous studies have examined the validity of inflammatory markers in the population studies in Caucasian elderly people, very little information is available for the factors affecting inflammatory markers in Asian elderly people. Among inflammatory markers frequently used for the studies of aging, tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±) is produced mainly by macrophages, and contributes to production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), thus directing a chronic inflammatory process in the body. In the present study, we examined the associations between plasma TNF-Î± level and several factors related to nutrition status, including BMI, albumin, and energy intake in community-dwelling Japanese elderly. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 390 men and women aged 70-86 y (average 73.5 y), who participated in health check-ups. Associations between plasma TNF-Î± levels, other clinical parameters, and lifestyle factors were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. In elderly men, plasma TNF-Î± level was positively associated with age, white blood cell count, monocyte count, plasma CRP level, serum creatinine, ureic acid, and triacylglycerol levels, and negatively associated with albumin/globulin ratio, eGFR, and serum HDL-cholesterol level. In elderly women, plasma TNF-Î± level was positively associated with age, plasma CRP level, and serum triacylglycerol level, and negatively associated with serum albumin and HDL-cholesterol levels. The results of this study suggest that plasma TNF-Î± is associated with inflammation and insulin resistance in both Japanese elderly men and women, and a prominent association of TNF-Î± with malnutrition status was observed in elderly women.\n\nElder Abuse in Japan\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nArai, Mizuho\n\n2006-01-01\n\nPerceptions of elder abuse were examined in Japanese women (n =100) and men (n =46). Japanese women and men both emphasized physical aggression, followed by neglect and blaming, when giving examples of extremely abusive behavior. Physical aggression was also the most frequently mentioned type of moderate elder abuse, followed by neglect, economicâ¦\n\nInformation processing speed and 8-year mortality among community-dwelling elderly Japanese.\n\nPubMed\n\nIwasa, Hajime; Kai, Ichiro; Yoshida, Yuko; Suzuki, Takao; Kim, Hunkyung; Yoshida, Hideyo\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCognitive function is an important contributor to health among elderly adults. One reliable measure of cognitive functioning is information processing speed, which can predict incident dementia and is longitudinally related to the incidence of functional dependence. Few studies have examined the association between information processing speed and mortality. This 8-year prospective cohort study design with mortality surveillance examined the longitudinal relationship between information processing speed and all-cause mortality among community-dwelling elderly Japanese. A total of 440 men and 371 women aged 70 years or older participated in this study. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) was used to assess information processing speed. DSST score was used as an independent variable, and age, sex, education level, depressive symptoms, chronic disease, sensory deficit, instrumental activities of daily living, walking speed, and cognitive impairment were used as covariates. During the follow-up period, 182 participants (133 men and 49 women) died. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that lower DSST score was associated with increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.62, 95% CI = 0.97-2.72; HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.05-2.87; and HR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.51-4.29, for the third, second, and first quartiles of DSST score, respectively). Slower information processing speed was associated with shorter survival among elderly Japanese.\n\nThe gender gap in depressive symptoms among Japanese elders: evaluating social support and health as mediating factors.\n\nPubMed\n\nTiedt, Andrew D\n\n2010-09-01\n\nDepression has been described as the world's most prevalent illness and a leading cause of disability across age groups. The global literature on aging and depression reports greater prevalence of depressive symptoms among women than men. This research applies data from the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging to the gender gap in depressive symptoms reported by Japanese elders. This study takes the position that cultural norms centered on obligations to care determine both the prevalence of social support and its application by family members. Since gender is the lens through which social and cultural expectations are filtered, the experiences of men and women are distinguished from one another. This study hypothesized that coresidency and filial obligations should protect elders from depression. At the same time, combative relationships within households were posited to aggravate depressive symptoms among mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. Weak social support networks, as captured through not being married, living alone and lack of community contact were also hypothesized to exacerbate isolation and heighten depressive symptoms. The analyses found that receipt of support both protected elders as well as worsened depressive symptoms. While women reported greater frequency of depressive symptoms overall, results indicated that men experienced a larger effect of decreased mobility and transitions to poor physical health on depressive symptoms than women.\n\nAn analysis of the impact of cell phone use on depressive symptoms among Japanese elders.\n\nPubMed\n\nMinagawa, Yuka; Saito, Yasuhiko\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThere has been increasing interest in the impact of information and communication technologies, such as the computer and Internet, on physical and mental health status, but relatively little is known about the health effects of using cell phones. This study investigates how cell phone usage is associated with levels of depressive symptoms among Japanese men and women aged 65 years and older. We focus on social relationships, particularly intergenerational relationships between older parents and adult children, as a possible mediator in the association of cell phone use with late-life depressive symptoms. We therefore hypothesize that using cell phones contributes to the psychological well-being of older adults primarily through encouraging social relationships. We used 4 waves of data from the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging (2001-2009) to analyze the impact of cell phone use on depressive symptoms. RESULTS are based on ordinary least squares regression analyses. Although the use of cell phones was related to lower levels of depressive symptoms among elderly Japanese people, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and physical health conditions wiped out the effects for men. In contrast, the protective effects of using cell phones persisted among women, even net of all controls. Moreover, the impact of using cell phones was not explained by filial relationship measures, suggesting that cell phone use influences the mental health of older women independently of social engagement. Among the many advantages brought about by recent technological developments, cell phones appear to be an important contributor to the psychological well-being of Japanese elders. Researchers and policy makers should prioritize access to new technologies for older adults. Â© 2014 S.

We conducted a 6-year cohort study of 773 community-dwelling elderly Japanese women and found that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)ââ¥â71Â nmol/L was associated with a reduced risk of osteoporotic limb and vertebral fractures. Data on the association between vitamin D status and osteoporotic fracture in Asians are sparse. This study aimed to clarify the association between vitamin D and other markers of nutritional status with the incidence of fracture in elderly Japanese women. We conducted a cohort study with a 6-year follow-up of 773 community-dwelling women aged 69Â years and older. The 6-year follow-up ended in 2009. We assessed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, undercarboxylated osteocalcin (an index of vitamin K status), and calcium intake. The primary outcome was incident limb and vertebral fractures. Covariates were forearm bone mineral density (BMD), age, body mass index, osteoporosis treatment, and physical activity. The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 60.0Â nmol/L. Thirty-seven limb fractures and 14 vertebral fractures occurred in 4,392 person-years. Lower forearm BMD was significantly associated with increased incident fracture (Pâ=â0.0242). The adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of fracture for the first quartile (<47.7Â nmol/L) and the third quartile (59.2-70.9Â nmol/L) of serum 25(OH)D, compared to the fourth quartile (â¥71.0Â nmol/L), were 2.82 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-7.34) and 2.82 (95%CI, 1.09-7.27), respectively. The pooled adjusted HR was 0.42 (95%CI, 0.18-0.99) when the incidence in the fourth quartile (â¥71.0Â nmol/L) was compared to the other three quartiles combined (<71.0Â nmol/L). Vitamin K status and calcium intake were not associated with incident fracture. Sufficient vitamin D status, i.e., serum 25(OH)Dââ¥â71Â nmol/L, is associated with low limb and vertebral fracture risk in community-dwelling elderly women.\n\nLight-intensity physical activity is associated with insulin resistance in elderly Japanese women independent of moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nGando, Yuko; Murakami, Haruka; Kawakami, Ryoko; Tanaka, Noriko; Sanada, Kiyoshi; Tabata, Izumi; Higuchi, Mitsuru; Miyachi, Motohiko\n\n2014-02-01\n\nIt is unclear whether light physical activity is beneficially associated with insulin resistance, similar to moderate and/or vigorous physical activity. This cross-sectional study was performed to determine the relationship between the amount of light physical activity, as determined with a triaxial accelerometer, and insulin resistance. A total of 807 healthy men and women participated in this study. Physical activity was measured using a triaxial accelerometer worn for 28 days and summarized as light intensity (1.1-2.9 METs) or moderate to vigorous intensity (â¥ 3.0 METs). Insulin resistance was evaluated by HOMA_R (FPG [mg/dL] Ã IRI [Î¼U/mL]/405). The daily time spent in light physical activity was inversely associated with HOMA_R (r = -0.173, P < 0.05). After adjustment for confounders, the association between light physical activity and HOMA_R remained statistically significant (Î² = -0.119, P < .05). Light physical activity remained significantly associated with HOMA_R following further adjustment for moderate to vigorous intensity activity (Î² = -0.125, P < .05). Similar results were observed when light physical activity was modeled as quartiles, especially in elderly women. These cross-sectional data suggest that light-intensity physical activity is beneficially associated with insulin resistance in elderly Japanese women.\n\nBacterial Pneumonia in Elderly Japanese Populations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiyashita, Naoya; Yamauchi, Yasuhiro\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBacterial pneumonia is one of the most important infectious diseases in terms of incidence, effect on quality of life, mortality, and impact on society. Pneumonia was the third leading cause of death in Japan in 2011. In 2016, 119â650 Japanese people died of pneumonia, 96% of whom were aged 65âyears and above. The symptoms of pneumonia in elderly people are often atypical. Aspiration pneumonia is seen more frequently than in young people because of swallowing dysfunction in the elderly. The mortality rate is also higher in the elderly than in young people. In Japan, the population is aging at an unprecedented rate, and pneumonia in the elderly will be increasingly important in medicine and medical economics in the future. To manage pneumonia in the elderly, it is important to accurately evaluate its severity, administer appropriate antibiotic treatment, and implement effective preventive measures.

We aimed to clarify the correlation between the PFC energy ratio and metabolic parameters including glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and triglycerides in Japanese elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 65 years or older. Participants were 1173 diabetic patients aged 65 years or older with serum HbA1c level of >/=7.4% enrolled in the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial (J-EDIT). The participants were divided into four groups by the percentage of total energy intake (%E) of carbohydrate (C1: less than 55%E, C2: 55%E or more and less than 60%E, C3: 60%E or more and less than 65%E, and C4: 65%E or more). Relations of %E of carbohydrate to HbA1c and other metabolic parameters, energy intake and nutritional intake were examined. Furthermore, the subjects were divided into four categories by HbA1c levels by quartile method (Q1: less than 7.90%, Q2: 7.90% or more and less than 8.30%, Q3: 8.30% or more and less than 8.80%, Q4: 8.80% or more). Relations of HbA1c to other metabolic parameters, energy intake and nutritional intake were examined. The mean HbA1c levels in the four groups were C1: 8.40%, C2: 8.50%, C3: 8.41% and C4: 8.36% in men, and C1: 8.51%, C2: 8.47%, C3: 8.35% and C4: 8.52% in women, respectively. There were no significant differences and linear trend in HbA1c levels across groups. The mean triglyceride levels were in the range of 122-128 mg/dL in men from C1 to C3, although it was significantly higher in C4 (177 mg/dL). The mean triglyceride levels were in the range of 128-136 mg/dL in women from C1 to C3, although it was significantly higher in Q4 (150 mg/dL). Amounts of protein and fat intakes decreased with an increase of %E of carbohydrate, although amount of carbohydrate intake did not change significantly. As a result, %E of protein and fat, and energy intake decreased\n\nEstimated Dietary Polyphenol Intake and Major Food and Beverage Sources among Elderly Japanese\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTaguchi, Chie; Fukushima, Yoichi; Kishimoto, Yoshimi; Suzuki-Sugihara, Norie; Saita, Emi; Takahashi, Yoshinari; Kondo, Kazuo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nEstimating polyphenol intake contributes to the understanding of polyphenolsâ health benefits. However, information about human polyphenol intake is scarce, especially in the elderly. This study aimed to estimate the dietary intake and major sources of polyphenols and to determine whether there is any relationship between polyphenol intake and micronutrient intake in healthy elderly Japanese. First, 610 subjects (569 men, 41 women; aged 67.3 Â± 6.1 years) completed food frequency questionnaires. We then calculated their total polyphenol intake using our polyphenol content database. Their average total polyphenol intake was 1492 Â± 665 mg/day, the greatest part of which was provided by beverages (79.1%). The daily polyphenol intake differed largely among individuals (183â4854 mg/day), also attributable mostly to beverage consumption. Coffee (43.2%) and green tea (26.6%) were the major sources of total polyphenol; the top 20 food items accounted for >90%. The polyphenol intake did not strongly correlate with the intake of any micronutrient, suggesting that polyphenols may exert health benefits independently of nutritional intake. The polyphenol intake in this elderly population was slightly higher than previous data in Japanese adults, and beverages such as coffee and green tea contributed highly to the intake.

The study group comprised 14 elderly Korean women residents at a Korean-oriented, insurance-based, day services center in midwestern Japan. They were interviewed in depth, and the data were analyzed using the modified grounded theory approach. The study designated the core category as \"conservation of ethnic identity\" and identified five subcategories: (a) loneliness, (b) returning to one's homeland culture, (c) physical decline as a result of aging, (d) family ties, and (e) a place where one belongs. The results elucidated that although the participants had adapted to Japanese culture, they were strongly influenced by the memories of their hometowns and wished to return to their homeland. The study suggests that elderly immigrants need day care support that provides an environment where they can enjoy their culture.\n\nHigh-molecular-weight adiponectin levels in healthy, community-dwelling, elderly Japanese volunteers: a 5-year prospective observational study.\n\nPubMed\n\nOtsuka, Hiromasa; Yanai, Mitsuru; Kobayashi, Hiroki; Haketa, Akira; Hara, Motohiko; Sugama, Kaoru; Kato, Kimitoshi; Soma, Masayoshi\n\n2017-10-19\n\nSerum adiponectin levels are associated with frailty and cardiovascular diseases. Longitudinal changes in adiponectin levels might enhance our understanding of age-related conditions and diseases. This prospective observational study aimed to: (1) elucidate age-related changes in high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin levels; and (2) identify variables predictive of elevated HMW adiponectin levels and the association with well-known adiponectin single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in healthy, elderly Japanese participants. Healthy elderly volunteers (nâ=â196; 55 men and 141 women; median age 72.0 years; range 69.0-75.0Â years) underwent anthropometric and physical function measurements, as well as laboratory tests at baseline and the 5-year follow-up. HMW adiponectin levels were significantly higher in women than in men (8.4, 5.3-11.9 vs. 5.7, 3.1-9.0Â Î¼g/mL; pâ<â0.001) at baseline and decreased significantly at follow-up in women (7.7, 4.8-11.2Â Î¼g/mL; pâ<â0.001), but not in men. In the multiple regression analysis, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and body weight were independent predictors of HMW adiponectin levels. The rate of change in HMW adiponectin levels was inversely correlated with the rates of change in body weight, body mass index, and knee leg extension strengths, and positively correlated with rates of change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and one-leg standing time. There were no significant differences in HMW adiponectin levels among SNPs. Decreasing HMW adiponectin levels might lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in elderly women. HMW adiponectin levels significantly decreased over a 5-year period in community-dwelling elderly Japanese women.\n\nPerceived Neighborhood Environment and Walking for Specific Purposes Among Elderly Japanese\n\nPubMed Central\n\nInoue, Shigeru; Ohya, Yumiko; Odagiri, Yuko; Takamiya, Tomoko; Kamada, Masamitsu; Okada, Shinpei; Oka, Kohichiro; Kitabatake, Yoshinori; Nakaya, Tomoki; Sallis, James F; Shimomitsu, Teruichi\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Recent research has revealed the importance of neighborhood environment as a determinant of physical activity. However, evidence among elderly adults is limited. This study examined the association between perceived neighborhood environment and walking for specific purposes among Japanese elderly adults. Methods This population-based, cross-sectional study enrolled 1921 participants (age: 65â74 years, men: 51.9%). Neighborhood environment (International Physical Activity Questionnaire Environmental Module) and walking for specific purposes (ie, transportation or recreation) were assessed by self-report. Multilevel logistic regression analyses with individuals at levelÂ 1 and neighborhoods at levelÂ 2 were conducted to examine the association between environment and walking, after adjustment for potential confounders. Results Access to exercise facilities, social environment, and aesthetics were associated with total neighborhood walking. Odds ratios (95% CI) were 1.23 (1.00â1.51), 1.39 (1.14â1.71), and 1.48 (1.21â1.81), respectively. Regarding walking for specific purposes, social environment and aesthetics were consistent correlates of both transportation walking and recreational walking. Environmental correlates differed by specific types of walking and by sex. Transportation walking significantly correlated with a greater variety of environmental attributes. Sex differences were observed, especially for transportation walking. Bicycle lanes, crime safety, traffic safety, aesthetics, and household motor vehicles were significant correlates among men, while access to shops, access to exercise facilities, and social environment were important among women. Conclusions Specific environmentâwalking associations differed by walking purpose and sex among elderly adults. Social environment and aesthetics were consistent correlates of both transportation walking and recreational walking. Improving these environmental features might be effective in\n\nReference values of MostGraph measures for middle-aged and elderly Japanese individuals who participated in annual health checkups.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbe, Yuki; Shibata, Yoko; Igarashi, Akira; Inoue, Sumito; Sato, Kento; Sato, Masamichi; Nemoto, Takako; Kobayashi, Maki; Nishiwaki, Michiko; Kimura, Tomomi; Tokairin, Yoshikane; Kayama, Takamasa; Kubota, Isao\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe forced oscillation technique (FOT) can measure respiratory system resistance and reactance under tidal volume respiration. MostGraph is a device that incorporates the FOT and enables the immediate, three-dimensional visualization of resistance and reactance parameters. The aim of this study was to establish MostGraph reference values for middle-aged and elderly Japanese individuals. From 2004 to 2006, 3253 subjects living in Takahata, Yamagata underwent spirometry. Of these, 872 again underwent spirometry in 2011, and 784 (368 men, ages 46-89 years; 416 women, ages 47-90 years) underwent FOT examinations using MostGraph-01. In this study population, 19.0% of the men and 91.5% of the women were life-long never smokers. Abnormal spirometric findings were observed in 30.2% of the men and 14.6% of the women. Although the respiratory system resistance and reactance parameters obtained using MostGraph were not distributed normally, normal distribution was achieved via natural logarithm (R5, R20, Fres, and ALX), square root (R5-R20), or exponential (X5) transformation. Furthermore, the transformed values were converted back to the actual values after determining the values representing one and two standard deviations from the mean. Respiratory system resistance and reactance reference values were determined using MostGraph in middle-aged and elderly Japanese individuals who participated in annual health checkups.

Hence, there is an urgent need for applicable community-based intervention models for halting the progression of knee pain and related disabilities in elderly women. We aimed to assess the efficacy of home-visit physiotherapy as a new intervention model. This non-randomized 5-month-long controlled trial enrolled elderly community-dwelling women (aged 60-83 years) with mild knee pain. The intervention consisted of two home visits by a physiotherapist, with instructions on routinely performing muscle-strengthening exercises at home and implementing simple environmental modifications when necessary. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and 5 months later. The primary outcomes were measured as the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and a newly devised seiza-style sitting score. People in Japan, especially elderly women, are accustomed to seiza-style sitting that involves kneeling on one's lower legs while resting the buttocks on the heels. The secondary outcomes included quadriceps isometric strength, knee alignment in the frontal and sagittal planes, and passive knee extension range. Forty-two subjects (20 in the intervention group and 22 in the control group) completed the study. At baseline, characteristics and the primary outcomes did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. At 5 months, the primary outcomes improved significantly in the intervention group. Estimated differences in the change from baseline for each outcome between the 2 groups were computed, adjusting for outcome variables imbalanced at baseline. Even after the adjustment, the home-visit physiotherapy regimen provides favorable improvement in the seiza-style sitting score.\n\nThe Work Values of Japanese Women.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEngel, John W.\n\nEmpirical studies of Japanese work ethics have tended to focus on male workers while neglecting women.

Mekabu fucoidan (MF), a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from seaweed, was previously shown to have an immunomodulatory effect. We therefore investigated antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly Japanese men and women with and without oral MF intake. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted with 70 volunteers >60 y of age. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups, consuming either MF (300 mg/d) or placebo for 4 wk, and then given a trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. Serum was sampled at 5 and 20 wk after vaccination to measure the hemagglutination inhibition titer and natural killer cell activity. The MF group had higher antibody titers against all 3 strains contained in the seasonal influenza virus vaccine than the placebo group. Titers against the B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B) strain increased substantially more in the MF group than in the placebo group over the product consumption period. The immune response against B antigen met the European Union Licensure criteria regarding the geometric mean titer ratio in the MF group (2.4), but not in the placebo group (1.7). In the MF group, natural killer cell activity tended to increase from baseline 9 wk after MF intake (P = 0.08). However, in the placebo group no substantial increase was noted at 9 wk, and the activity decreased substantially from 9 to 24 wk. In the immunocompromised elderly, MF intake increased antibody production after vaccination, possibly preventing influenza epidemics.

Repeated measurements of 498 elders over a three-year survey interval were obtained from a baseline mail survey and two- and three-year follow-up surveys. Outcomes were analyzed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. Male elders were more likely to have a spouse and work at paid jobs, while female elders were likely to have more frequent contacts with their child/children and more interactions with friends. As the elders aged over three years, life satisfaction decreased, while depression did not show any significant overall trend. There were no beneficial effects of social interactions on change in well-being, although social participation, interaction with friends, and conversation with spouse were beneficially related to baseline levels of both depressive tendency and life satisfaction. Among female elders only, the number of children had beneficial effects on life satisfaction. There are modest gender differences of the impact of social interactions on the well-being of Japanese elders, and the number of children seems to be more important as potential sources of support for female rather than male elders. Spousal conversation and non-obligatory social interaction such as unpaid social activities and friendship seem to be important for both male and female elders in Japan. These findings suggest that social relations among Japanese elders may be moving away from more gender dependent patterns seen in the past.\n\nGenerational Differences in Japanese Attitudes toward Women's Employment.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEngel, John W.\n\nTraditional ideals discourage Japanese women from working outside the home.

Therefore, in this cross-sectional study we attempted to characterize the condition of facial skin (hyperpigmentation, pores, texture, and wrinkling) in Japanese adults aged 65 years or older by using objective and quantitative imaging methods. In addition, we aimed to identify lifestyle factors significantly associated with these visible signs of aging. Methods The study subjects were 802 community-dwelling Japanese men and women aged at least 65 years and living in the town of Kurabuchi (Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture, Japan), a mountain community with a population of approximately 4800. The facial skin condition of subjects was assessed quantitatively using a standardized facial imaging system and subsequent computer image analysis. Lifestyle information was collected using a structured questionnaire. The association between skin condition and lifestyle factors was examined using multivariable regression analysis. Results Among women, the mean values for facial texture, hyperpigmentation, and pores were generally lower than those among age-matched men. There was no significant difference between sexes in the severity of facial wrinkling. Older age was associated with worse skin condition among women only. After adjusting for age, smoking status and topical sun protection were significantly associated with skin condition among both men and women. Conclusions Our study revealed significant differences between sexes in the severity of hyperpigmentation, texture, and pores, but not wrinkling. Smoking status and topical sun protection were significantly associated with signs of visible skin aging in this study population.

STELLA-LONG TERM is an ongoing 3-year prospective surveillance study of Japanese T2DM patients receiving ipragliflozin 50Â mg once daily. In this subgroup analysis, patient characteristics, laboratory variables, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were compared between non-elderly (<65Â years) and elderly (â¥65Â years) patients. Non-elderly patients had significantly higher body mass index and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than elderly patients (PÂ <Â 0.001). The proportion of patients with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <8.0% was significantly higher among elderly patients (PÂ <Â 0.001). HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and body weight significantly decreased from baseline to 3 and 12Â months in both groups (all PÂ <Â 0.05 vs. baseline). The ADR incidence was 10.83% vs. 10.42% in non-elderly and elderly patients. The incidence of skin complications was 0.98% vs. 1.65% and that of renal disorder was 0.47% vs. 0.95% in non-elderly and elderly patients (both PÂ =Â 0.003). Ipragliflozin was effective in non-elderly and elderly Japanese T2DM patients in a real-world clinical setting. The incidence of renal disorder and skin complications was significantly higher in elderly vs. non-elderly patients.\n\nPrevalence of falls in elderly women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVitor, Priscila Regina Rorato; de Oliveira, Ana Carolina Kovaleski; Kohler, Renan; Winter, Gabriele Regiane; Rodacki, Cintia; Krause, Maressa Priscila\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: To verify prevalence of falls and fear of falling, and to compare functional fitness among elderly women fallers and non-fallers. METHODS: Seventy-eight elderly women participated in this study. Cases of falls and the fear of falling were self-reported by the elderly women, while the functional fitness was measured by a set of functional tests. Mean and standard deviation were used to describe the sample. Independent t-test was used to compare functional fitness between groups. RESULTS: The prevalence of falls in this sample was 32.4%. Among women fallers, 40% self-reported a high fear of falling. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that functional and resistance exercises are included in the preventive strategies for reducing risk factors for falls and its determinants in elderly women.

Combined with the tradition of family responsibility for elder care, this rapid population aging has resulted in middle-aged Japanese people being much more likely today than in past decades to face the responsibility of caring for their elderly parents alongside their other major roles. Using nationally representative Japanese data, this study assessed the individual and combined implications of caregiving and other role involvements for the well-being of middle-aged men and women. Some evidence was found for deleterious psychological consequences of the caregiver role. However, in contrast to expectations, the interaction between the roles of caregiver and worker was positively associated with well-being among both men and women. The results suggest the importance of middle-aged adults being able to keep working when they have to care for their aging parents. Another important finding was significant gender differences in the psychological consequences of holding multiple family- and work-related roles and in combining these with the caregiver role. Further analysis showed that the spousal role was also negatively associated with depressive symptoms and positively associated with satisfaction for men but not for women. Gender differences in the findings appear to reflect the significant gender asymmetry in role experiences in Japan.\n\nLower physical activity, but not excessive calorie intake, is associated with metabolic syndrome in elderly with type 2 diabetes mellitus: the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nIijima, Katsuya; Iimuro, Satoshi; Ohashi, Yasuo; Sakurai, Takashi; Umegaki, Hiroyuki; Araki, Atsushi; Yoshimura, Yukio; Ouchi, Yasuyoshi; Ito, Hideki\n\n2012-04-01\n\nA decline in physical activity has been shown to be associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), leading to cardiovascular events. However, this is difficult to manage well in the elderly with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors. In this study, we investigated the correlation between physical activity and clinical parameters in the presence and absence of MetS in Japanese elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, we determined which factor, calorie intake or physical activity, mainly contributes to the prevalence of MetS. Cross-sectional analysis of 846 consecutive Japanese elderly (408 men and 438 women, mean age 68.7 years) was carried out at the time of enrolment (2000-2002) in the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial. Their level of physical activity was evaluated using the Baecke questionnaire, consisting of three components: work, sports and leisure. Total activity score (TAS) as the sum of each activity score was divided into four quartiles (Q1 to Q4). After adjustment for age and sex, there was a positive association of TAS with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, although no significant correlation between other lipid parameters and TAS was found. In addition, fasting plasma glucose, insulin level and physical measurements, such as waist circumference, waist/hip ratio and body mass index, were inversely associated with TAS. Although no correlation between TAS and cognitive function Mini-Mental State Examination was found, TAS was positively associated with instrumental ADL and negatively associated with geriatric depression score (GDS), suggesting that a decline in physical activity in the elderly is associated with depressed mood rather than a decline of cognitive function. Total calorie intake appeared to increase according to TAS; however, this did not reach statistical significance. In a subanalysis comparing the presence and absence of MetS, the TAS grade in the MetS group was significantly lower than that in the\n\nUn-Autobiographical Autobiographies: Investigating the Life-Stories of Ten Elderly Nisei Christian Women at a Local Japanese American Church\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOkamura, Naoki\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTraise Yamamoto, a professor of English and a scholar of biographical studies, made the following remark in her book \"Masking Selves, Making Subjects\" (1999).

However, New Zealand statistics show a high percentage of epidural use amongst Asian women. Entonox (a gas mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen) and pethidine are also available to women in New Zealand. This article investigates how Japanese women in New Zealand respond to the use of pharmacological pain relief in labour. The study was guided by two research questions: (1) How do Japanese women experience and manage labour pain in New Zealand? (2) How do they feel about the use of pharmacological pain relief? Thirteen Japanese women who had given birth in New Zealand were interviewed individually or in a focus group. The conversations were analysed using thematic analysis. Although in Japan very few women use pain relief, nine women received epidural and/or Entonox out of 11 women who experienced labour pain. The contrast between their Japanese cultural expectations and their birth experiences caused some of the women subsequent personal conflict. Japanese women's cultural perspectives and passive attitudes were demonstrated to influence the decision-making process concerning pain relief. It was concluded that understanding Japanese cultural worldviews and approaches to the role of pain in labour would help maternity providers in their provision of appropriate care for Japanese women.

In this study, we translated the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) into Japanese and assessed its validity and reliability. Three hundred and twenty-five healthy and elderly subjects over 65 years were enrolled. Concurrent validity was evaluated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between PASE scores and an accelerometer (waking steps and energy expenditure), a physical activity questionnaire for adults in general (the Japan Arteriosclerosis Longitudinal Study Physical Activity Questionnaire, JALSPAQ), grip strength, mid-thigh muscle area per bodyweight, static valance and bodyfat percentage. Reliability was evaluated by the test-retest method over a period of 3-4 weeks. The mean PASE score in this study was 114.9. The PASE score was significantly correlated with walking steps (rho = 0.17, P = 0.014), energy expenditure (rho = 0.16, P = 0.024), activity measured with the JALSPAQ (rho = 0.48, P < 0.001), mid-thigh muscle area per bodyweight (rho = 0.15, P = 0.006) and static balance (rho = 0.19, P = 0.001). The proportion of consistency in the response between the first and second surveys was adequately high. The intraclass correlation coefficient for the PASE score was 0.65. The Japanese version of PASE was shown to have acceptable validity and reliability. The PASE is useful to measure the physical activity of elderly people in Japan.\n\nIs the useful field of view a good predictor of at-fault crash risk in elderly Japanese drivers?\n\nPubMed\n\nSakai, Hiroyuki; Uchiyama, Yuji; Takahara, Miwa; Doi, Shun'ichi; Kubota, Fumiko; Yoshimura, Takayoshi; Tachibana, Atsumichi; Kurahashi, Tetsuo\n\n2015-05-01\n\nAlthough age-related decline in the useful field of view (UFOV) is well recognized as a risk factor for at-fault crash involvement in elderly drivers, there is still room to study its applicability to elderly Japanese drivers. In the current study, we thus examined the relationship between UFOV and at-fault crash history in an elderly Japanese population. We also explored whether potential factors that create awareness of reduced driving fitness could be a trigger for the self-regulation of driving in elderly drivers. We measured UFOV and at-fault crash history from 151 community-dwelling Japanese aged 60 years or older, and compared UFOV of at-fault crash-free and crash-involved drivers. We also measured self-evaluated driving style using a questionnaire. UFOV in crash-involved drivers was significantly lower than that in crash-free drivers. No significant difference was found in self-evaluated driving style between crash-free and crash-involved drivers. In addition, there was no significant association between UFOV and self-evaluated driving style. The present study showed that UFOV is a good predictor of at-fault crash risk in elderly Japanese drivers. Furthermore, our data imply that it might be difficult for elderly drivers to adopt appropriate driving strategies commensurate with their current driving competence.

A total of 3000 participants aged 60 years or older were randomly recruited in Y City, Japan in 2002, of whom 2964 provided complete information for analysis. Information on income level, mobility status, medical status, and vital status of each participant was collected annually from 2002 to 2006. Follow-up surveys on survival were conducted until August 2007. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by a Cox model, using taxation categories at baseline. In these analyses, age-adjusted and age- and mobility-adjusted models were used. A significantly higher mortality risk was seen only in the lowest taxation category among men: as compared with men in the second highest taxation category, the HR in the lowest category was 2.53 (95% CI, 1.26-5.08, P = 0.009). This significant association between taxation category and mortality was lost after adjustment for mobility. There was no other difference in mortality among taxation categories in men or women. The present findings only partly supported our hypothesis that taxation category is a good indicator of socioeconomic status in examining health inequalities among elderly Japanese.\n\nApolipoprotein E polymorphism in elderly Japanese-Brazilian immigrants does not explain the reduced cardiovascular risk factor incidence.\n\nPubMed\n\nTerra, N; Moriguchi, Y; Bittencourt, L; Trois, R S; Piccoli, J E C; Cruz, I B M\n\n2011-09-09\n\nStudy of immigrant populations may contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of diseases associated with the aging process. We examined the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphism, in elderly subjects who were born in Japan, migrated to South Brazil and have lived in that region for over 40 years, versus a group of elderly, locally born Brazilians living in the same region. These Japanese subjects came to Brazil after World War II (1950-1960) from several Japanese cities, mainly Nagasaki, Kumamoto and Hokkaido. Among 1007 subjects genotyped for ApoE polymorphism, we selected 540 elderly subjects (>60 years old), consisting of 270 Japanese-Brazilians and 270 Brazilians of European ancestry from Rio Grande do Sul State (Gaucha population). The Japanese-Brazilian group had significantly lower prevalences of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome than did the Gaucho population group. ApoE polymorphism frequencies were similar in the two groups. The differences in cardiovascular risk factors observed in the two populations cannot be explained by ApoE polymorphism; they could be related to conservation of Japanese lifestyle habits, such as diet.\n\nWomen's Studies and the International Student: A Report on a Course for Japanese Women.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRosser, Sue V.\n\nProblems encountered by Japanese women who participated in an American women's studies seminar have been valuable to the development of a cross-cultural women's course at Mary Baldwin College in Virginia.

We aimed to evaluate the induction of labor (IoL) failure rates among elderly nulliparous women. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all nulliparous women at 34â+â0 to 41â+â6 weeks, undergoing cervical ripening by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) vaginal insert. Study group included elderly (â¥35 years) nulliparous and control group included non-elderly (<35 years) nulliparous women. Primary outcome was IoL failure rate and secondary outcome was cesarean delivery rate. Outcomes were compared between the groups by univariate analysis followed by regression analysis to adjust results to potential confounders. Of 537 women undergoing IoL, 69 (12.8%) were elderly. The univariate analysis demonstrated no difference in IoL failure rate (26.5% versus 34.8%, pâ=â0.502) between groups. However, elderly nulliparous women had higher rates of cesarean delivery (36.2% versus 21.4%, pâ=â0.009). This difference was no longer significant after adjustment for maternal body mass index, indication for delivery, birth weight and gestational age at delivery. Among nulliparous women, older maternal age is not associated with higher rates of IoL failure or cesarean deliveries.\n\nLower physical activity is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus beyond traditional risk factors: the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nIijima, Katsuya; Iimuro, Satoshi; Shinozaki, Tomohiro; Ohashi, Yasuo; Sakurai, Takashi; Umegaki, Hiroyuki; Araki, Atsushi; Ouchi, Yasuyoshi; Ito, Hideki\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIt is well known that a decline in physical activity is associated with lifestyle-related diseases including cardiovascular (CV) events. However, little is known about the association between physical activity and CV events in elderly patients, because recent accumulating reports have mainly dealt with middle-aged populations. In this study, we investigated the correlation between physical activity and CV events in Japanese elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 938 Japanese elderly patients with T2DM (447 men and 491 women, mean age 71.9 years) enrolled (2000-2002) in the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial (J-EDIT) were used in this study. Physical activity consisting of three components, work, sports and leisure-time, of their lifestyle was evaluated using the Baecke questionnaire at baseline. Total activity score (TAS) as a sum of each activity score was divided into four quartiles (Q1 to Q4). During a follow-up period of 65.2 months, 165 events and 71 deaths in total occurred. Higher TAS grade was associated with reduced risk of all events (hazard ratios: 0.82, 0.77 and 0.54 in Q2, Q3 and Q4, respectively) with statistical significance. Even after multivariate adjustment for covariates, higher TAS grade was a strong predictor of all events, and the prediction by TAS of cerebrovascular events was more effective than that of cardiac events. In contrast, all-cause mortality gradually decreased according to TAS grade; however, no statistical significance was found. Among the four grades of TAS, no significant change in several parameters, such as profiles of lipid and glucose metabolism, blood pressure, physical measurements, cognitive function and depression scale, was found throughout the follow-up period, suggesting that the higher level of physical activity itself was associated with the risk reduction of primary events. Lower physical activity is a strong and independent predictor of all CV events in the elderly with T2DM\n\nUnder-representation of elderly and women in clinical trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nVitale, Cristiana; Fini, Massimo; Spoletini, Ilaria; Lainscak, Mitja; Seferovic, Petar; Rosano, Giuseppe Mc\n\n2017-04-01\n\nElderly and women have been often under-represented in randomised clinical trials (RCTs) testing the effect of treatments on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) even though these diseases highly affect both of them. Taking into account these issues, the aim of this review is to critically analyse the topic of under-representation of elderly and women in cardiovascular RCTs. Compared to their younger counterparts, elderly have a higher incidence of disease-related morbidities, take more medicines and account for more adverse drug related events. Similarly, women present several differences in CVD pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and outcomes in comparison to their male counterparts. For these reasons, the results of RCTs obtained in younger men cannot be simply translated in elderly and women. Unfortunately, although international guidelines have been published to increase the enrolment of elderly and women, their recruitment is still insufficient. Thus, the inclusion of these subgroups in cardiovascular RCTs is a key aspect to acquire evidence-based knowledge in the understanding and management of CVDs in elderly and women.

The aim of this study was to explore the factors associated with the progression of this complication in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. This retrospective study of a subgroup of patients registered with the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial included 621 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (age â¥ 65 years, 346 with normoalbuminuria, 190 with microalbuminuria and 85 with overt proteinuria). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model with a backward stepwise procedure was applied to select factors with significant effects on worsening of nephropathy stage and the doubling of serum creatinine. During the follow up (median 52 months), 21% of patients progressed from normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria to a worse nephropathy stage. Aging, female sex and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were identified as independent and significant factors that worsen nephropathy stage. Also, 6.1% of patients showed doubling of serum creatinine during follow up. A positive history of cardiovascular disease, hyperuricemia and conventional therapy were identified as significant factors involved in the doubling of serum creatinine. The cumulative incidence of the doubling of serum creatinine was significantly lower in the intensive therapy group than the conventional therapy group (P = 0.016), although that of progression of nephropathy stage was similar in the two groups. We identified several factors associated with the progression of diabetic nephropathy in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that multiple risk factor intervention seems important in preventing deterioration of renal dysfunction. Â© 2012 Japan Geriatrics Society.\n\nElderly women and stress. Does marriage make a difference?\n\nPubMed\n\nPreston, D B; Dellasega, C\n\n1990-04-01\n\nAlthough studies of gender differences in the stress/health relationship of elderly persons have been done, few have examined the combined affect of marital status and gender on health. The experience of stress may affect elderly married women differently than elderly unmarried women. The purpose of this study was to explore the differential effects of stress on elderly married women and to identify interventions that could be used in gerontological nursing practice to promote effective coping. Roy's theory is used to explain the effects of stress on elderly women and to suggest nursing interventions. According to Roy, individuals respond to stressors in four behavioral modes: physiological, self-concept, role performance, and interdependency. The results of this study indicate that, of the four groups studied in this sample, the married women were in poorest health and the most vulnerable to stress.\n\nExercise and Nutritional Supplementation on Community-Dwelling Elderly Japanese Women With Sarcopenic Obesity: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Hunkyung; Kim, Miji; Kojima, Narumi; Fujino, Ken; Hosoi, Erika; Kobayashi, Hisamine; Somekawa, Shinji; Niki, Yoshifumi; Yamashiro, Yukari; Yoshida, Hideyo\n\n2016-11-01\n\nTo investigate the effects of exercise and/or nutritional supplementation on body composition, blood components, and physical function in community-dwelling elderly Japanese women with sarcopenic obesity. Randomized controlled trial. Urban community in Tokyo, Japan. Among 1213 community-dwelling elderly women over 70Â years of age, 307 were defined with sarcopenic obesity, and 139 women participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups. The exercise and nutrition (ExÂ +Â N) and exercise only (Ex) groups attended 60-minute exercise classes twice a week for 3Â months. The ExÂ +Â N and nutrition only (N) groups were provided with essential amino acid supplementation and tea fortified with catechins to be taken daily for 3Â months. Health education classes were provided to the control (HE) group every 2Â weeks. Bioelectric impedance analysis was used to measure body composition. Skeletal muscle mass index was calculated using measures of muscle mass and height. Physical function measures included grip strength, knee extension strength, usual walking speed, and walking parameters (stride, step length, width, walking angles). Blood samples were obtained to analyze levels of albumin, triglycerides, cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, leptin, cystatin C, vitamin D, interleukin-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Significant between-groupÂ ÃÂ time interactions were observed in usual walking speed (PÂ =Â .012), stride (PÂ =Â .004), right step length (PÂ =Â .003), average number of steps (PÂ =Â .029), and vitamin D (PÂ <Â .001). Compared to the HE group, the ExÂ +Â N intervention significantly decreased total body fat mass (PÂ =Â .036) and increased stride (PÂ =Â .038) and vitamin D (PÂ <Â .001). Significant reductions in trunk fat were observed in the Ex group compared with HE (PÂ =Â .014). The ExÂ +Â N and Ex interventions were over four times as likely (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) to reduce body fat mass than the\n\nThe decline in BMI among Japanese women after World War II.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaruyama, Shiko; Nakamura, Sayaka\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe body mass index (BMI) of the Japanese is significantly lower than is found in other high-income countries. Moreover, the average BMI of Japanese women is lower than that of Japanese men, and the age-specific BMI of Japanese women has decreased over time. The average BMI of Japanese women at age 25 decreased from 21.8 in 1948 to 20.4 in 2010 whereas that of men increased from 21.4 to 22.3 over the same period. We examine the long-term BMI trend in Japan by combining several historical data sources spanning eleven decades, from 1901 to 2012, to determine not only when but also how the BMI decline among women began: whether its inception was period-specific or cohort-specific. Our nonparametric regression analysis generated five findings. First, the BMI of Japanese women peaked with the 1930s birth cohort. This means that the trend is cohort-specific. Second, the BMI of men outpaced that of women in the next cohort. Third, the BMI of Japanese children, boys and girls alike, increased steadily throughout the 20th century. Fourth, the gender difference in the BMI trend is due to a gender difference in the weight trend, not the height trend. Fifth, these BMI trends are observed in urban and rural populations alike. We conclude that the BMI decline among Japanese women began with those who were in their late teens shortly after World War II. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The subjects comprised 398 women ranging in age from 40 to <60 years (mean age, 50.5 years). Climacteric symptoms were objectively assessed using the Keio questionnaire. The total scores obtained for the 40 symptoms were used to calculate symptom prevalence and severity. (i) The most frequent symptom was poor memory, reported by 88.7% of the women. (ii) Lumbar-sacral back pain was rated as a severe symptom by the highest percentage of women (15.3%). (iii) The prevalence and severity of poor memory and lumbar-sacral back pain did not differ with menopausal status. (iv) Hot flashes and sweats were slightly higher in peri- and early postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women. The present study showed that healthy women who do not consult physicians because of climacteric symptoms are primarily concerned with age-related symptoms, such as poor memory, loss of hair, and forgetfulness.\n\nSafety of ipragliflozin in elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (STELLA-ELDER): Interim results of a post-marketing surveillance study.\n\nPubMed\n\nTerauchi, Yasuo; Yokote, Koutaro; Nakamura, Ichiro; Sugamori, Haruko\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo determine the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with ipragliflozin in elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We report interim results of a postmarketing surveillance survey. Japanese physicians recorded ADRs in elderly patients (â¥ 65 years old) who were first prescribed with ipragliflozin within 3 months of its launch (April 2014). Incidence of ADRs within 1 year of starting treatment with ipragliflozin. 898 ADRs occurred in 721/7,170 patients (10.06%). Skin complication-, volume depletion-, genital infection-, polyuria/pollakiuria-, urinary tract infection-, and hypoglycemia-related ADRs occurred in 2.23%, 1.90%, 1.45%, 1.32%, 0.77%, and 0.32%, respectively. ADRs were classified as serious in 44 (0.61%) patients. Half of the ADRs occurred within 30 days of starting treatment. There were no cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Most (92.1%) of the ADRs resolved or improved. Glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, body weight, and systolic blood pressure decreased by 0.6% (baseline 7.8%), 22.7 mg/dL (baseline 163.0 mg/dL), 2.3 kg (baseline 67.4 kg), and 3.1 mmHg (baseline 133.2 mmHg), respectively, from baseline to treatment discontinuation/last visit. Ipragliflozin is well tolerated and reduced surrogate endpoints in elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Because help seeking for distress occurs within social networks, we examined how social networks supported or disabled help seeking for Japanese sojourners living in the US. Unfortunately, most of the literature about Japanese social relationships focuses on men in organizational settings. This study used intensive ethnographic interviewing with 49 Japanese expatriate women to examine how social relationships influenced psychosocial distress and help seeking. We found that the women in these samples engaged in complex, highly regulated, complicated and obligatory relationships through their primary affiliation with other âcompany wives.â Like many immigrant women, increased traditional cultural norms (referred to in Japanese as ryoosai kenbo, or good wives and wise mothers), were expected from these modern women, and the enactment of these roles was enforced through scrutiny, gossip and the possibility of ostracism. Fears of scrutiny was described by the women as a primary barrier to their self-disclosure and ultimate help seeking. Understanding the social organization and support within the Japanese women's community is central to understanding how culturally specific social networks can both give support, as well as create social constraints to help seeking. Health oriented prevention programs must consider these social factors when evaluating the immigration stressors faced by these families.

Elderly Japanese immigrants aged 65 years and over, belonging to the Miyagi Association in the SÃ£o Paulo Metropolitan Area, were targeted. They emigrated from Miyagi Prefecture to Brazil and are now living in the area. We were able to interview 166 respondents. All data were gathered using standardized interview methods covering (a) free interview about the immigration history, (b) demographics, and (c) physical status. Through the free interview, we found their immigration histories, which affected their clinical profiles. The mean age and educational level were 77.5 years and 6.3 years, respectively. Sixty per cent of them immigrated when they were younger than 14. Ninety-four per cent of them still keep Japanese nationality. Fifty-seven per cent of them usually use Japanese, while 10% of them use Portuguese. Although their emigration histories were hard, 76% of them perceived their health as being excellent or relatively good. The percentages of subjects with histories of disease were hypertension, 52.5%; cardiac disease, 20.8%; diabetes mellitus, 24.2%; and hyperlipidemia, 25.0%, which were affected by the Brazilian environment. The elderly Japanese who emigrated to Brazil before World War II have a unique historical and demographic background. Their clinical profiles cannot be fully understood without knowing their histories. They definitely need high quality international psychogeriatric care.

The PSQ translates DSM-IV criteria into a rating scale with degrees of severity. One thousand one hundred and eighty-seven Japanese women between the ages of 20 and 49 yrs, who were seen at a clinic for uterine cancer screening, were assessed regarding their premenstrual symptoms using the PSQ. As many as 95% of these women were found to suffer from premenstrual symptoms. The rates of prevalence of moderate to severe PMS and PMDD in Japanese women were 5.3 and 1.2%, respectively, which are lower than those in Western women. Only 5.3% of women with moderate to severe PMS and PMDD were treated. The results of this study suggest that race and ethnicity influence the expression of premenstrual symptoms and that the current state of medical care for Japanese women with moderate to severe PMS and PMDD is not satisfactory.\n\nA screening model for low bone mass in elderly Japanese men using quantitative ultrasound measurements: Fujiwara-Kyo Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMinematsu, Akira; Hazaki, Kan; Harano, Akihiro; Iki, Masayuki; Fujita, Yuki; Okamoto, Nozomi; Kurumatani, Norio\n\n2012-01-01\n\nScreening for low bone mass is important to prevent fragility fractures in men as well as women, although men show a much lower prevalence of osteoporosis than women. The purpose of this study was to establish a screening model for low bone mineral density (BMD) using a quantitative ultrasound parameter and easily obtained objective indices for elderly Japanese men. We examined 1633 men (65-84 yr old) who were subjects of the Fujiwara-Kyo Study. Speed of sound (SOS) at the calcaneus was determined, and BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH), and femoral neck (FN). Low BMD was defined as >1 standard deviation below the young adult mean, in accordance with World Health Organization criteria. We performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify a better screening model incorporating SOS and determined the optimal cutoff value using Youden index. Prevalences of low BMD at the 3 skeletal sites were 27.8% (LS), 33.5% (TH), 48.6% (FN), and 43.3% at either LS or TH. The greatest area under the ROC curve (0.806, 95% confidence interval: 0.785-0.828) and smallest Akaike's information criterion were obtained in the multivariate model incorporating SOS, age, height, and weight for predicting low BMD at all skeletal sites. This model predicted low BMD at TH with the sensitivity of 0.726 and specificity of 0.739, whereas a similar model predicted low BMD at LS with much lower validity. We conclude that the multivariate model for TH could be used to screen for low BMD in elderly Japanese men. Copyright Â© 2012 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry.

By using a large population-based sample of elderly Japanese people, we sought to investigate the association between bonding and bridging social capital and self-rated health for men and women separately. Methods In August 2010, questionnaires were sent to all residents aged â¥65Â years in three municipalities in Okayama prefecture (nâ=â21232), and 13929 questionnaires were returned (response rate: 65.6%). Social capital was measured from survey responses to questions on participation in six different types of groups: a) the elderly club or sports/hobby/culture circle; b) alumni association; c) political campaign club; d) citizenâs group or environmental preservation activity; e) community association; and f) religious organization. Participant perception of group homogeneity (gender, age, and previous occupation) was used to divide social capital into bonding or bridging. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for poor self-rated health were calculated. Results A total of 11146 subjects (4441 men and 6705 women) were available for the analysis. Among men, bonding and bridging social capital were inversely associated with poor self-rated health (high bonding social capital; OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.31â0.99; high bridging social capital; OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.48â0.81) after adjusting for age, educational attainment, smoking status, frequency of alcohol consumption, overweight, living arrangements, and type-D personality. The beneficial effect among women was more likely limited to bonding social capital (high bonding social capital; OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12â1.00), and the association between bridging social capital and self-rated health was less clear (high bridging social capital; OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.44â1.07).

The purpose of this study was to clarify the explanatory factors for disability in Japanese diabetic elderly. The 6-year decline in physical disability and functional limitations was investigated among 317 elderly people with type 2 diabetes recruited in a large-scale prospective study of the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial. Information about diabetes, blood examinations and complications was obtained, and basic activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) were assessed by total score of the Barthel index and the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence, respectively. After 6 years of follow up, 13.6% of patients had developed a new ADL disability and 38.3% had developed a new functional impairment. In the 65-74 years age group, basic ADL decreased only in males, whereas females became functionally impaired. In the 75-84 years age group, basic and IADL decreased in both males and females. Older age and metabolic syndrome were prognostic for impairment of basic ADL, whereas baseline IADL problems, lower cognitive function, physical inactivity and insulin therapy were significant predictors of a future decline in the IADL. This study identified several factors predicting the future decline of basic ADL and IADL in diabetic elderly patients, and provided a conceptual framework that might help to clarify the pathways leading to disability. Because the specific causes of each functional problem are modifiable, comprehensive treatment and care are needed to allow Japanese diabetic elderly patients to have more favorable living conditions.

The subjects enrolleded in this study were participants in the National Institute for Longevity Sciences, Longitudinal Study of Aging (NILS-LSA). The data of 792 community-dwelling participants aged 60 to 88 years old were collected. All had taken the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and had undergone pure tone audiometry (PTA) assessment and video recording of an otoscopic examination. We then analyzed associations between the incidence of the cerumen impaction of better-hearing ear, hearing level and MMSE scores using a general linear model. Cerumen impaction of the better-hearing ear was observed in 10.7% of all participants. In participants with an MMSE score of less than 24, the frequency of cerumen impaction was 23.3%. Cerumen was significant associated with poorer hearing after adjustment for sex and age (p=0.0001). Cerumen impaction also showed a significant association with a low MMSE score after adjustment for sex, age, hearing level and education (p=0.02). The frequency of cerumen impaction in Japanese elderly was estimated to be approximately 10%. The existence of cerumen impaction was associated with poorer hearing level and lower MMSE score.\n\nHair loss in elderly women.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, WenChieh; Yang, Chao-Chun; Todorova, Antonia; Al Khuzaei, Safaa; Chiu, Hsien-Ching; Worret, Wolf-Ingo; Ring, Johannes\n\n2010-01-01\n\nHair loss in elderly women has been becoming a major topic in the daily practice of dermatology. Aging of hair follicles seems to affect hair growth and pigmentation, the molecular mechanisms of which remain to be elucidated. Further senile changes in physiology and immunity may influence the onset and course of hair diseases. Some preexisting diseases such as androgenetic alopecia usually worsen after menopause, while others, like discoid lupus erythematosus, may attenuate. Hormone surveying, especially with regard to internal androgen-producing tumors, is indicated in postmenopausal women with androgenetic alopecia of sudden exacerbation or with unusual manifestation or other virilizing signs. The prevalence of alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis appears to be much lower in postmenopausal ages as compared to earlier onset. Acute or chronic telogen effluvium is not uncommonly superimposed on androgenetic alopecia. Trichotillomania shows a marked female predominance in the senile age group with a higher rate of psychopathology. Worldwide, tinea capitis has been increasingly observed in postmenopausal women. Frontal fibrosing alopecia, giant cell arteritis and erosive pustular dermatosis involve mainly elder women leading to scarring alopecia. Alopecia induced by tumor metastasis to the scalp must be considered in women with underlying neoplasms, especially breast cancer. Overall, hair loss in postmenopausal women is often multifactorial and warrants a close inspection.\n\nDietary patterns associated with fall-related fracture in elderly Japanese: a population based prospective study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMonma, Yasutake; Niu, Kaijun; Iwasaki, Koh; Tomita, Naoki; Nakaya, Naoki; Hozawa, Atsushi; Kuriyama, Shinichi; Takayama, Shin; Seki, Takashi; Takeda, Takashi; Yaegashi, Nobuo; Ebihara, Satoru; Arai, Hiroyuki; Nagatomi, Ryoichi; Tsuji, Ichiro\n\n2010-06-01\n\nDiet is considered an important factor for bone health, but is composed of a wide variety of foods containing complex combinations of nutrients. Therefore we investigated the relationship between dietary patterns and fall-related fractures in the elderly. We designed a population-based prospective survey of 1178 elderly people in Japan in 2002. Dietary intake was assessed with a 75-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), from which dietary patterns were created by factor analysis from 27 food groups. The frequency of fall-related fracture was investigated based on insurance claim records from 2002 until 2006. The relationship between the incidence of fall-related fracture and modifiable factors, including dietary patterns, were examined. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the relationships between dietary patterns and incidence of fall-related fracture with adjustment for age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI) and energy intake. Among 877 participants who agreed to a 4 year follow-up, 28 suffered from a fall-related fracture. Three dietary patterns were identified: mainly vegetable, mainly meat and mainly traditional Japanese. The moderately confirmed (see statistical methods) groups with a Meat pattern showed a reduced risk of fall-related fracture (Hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.13 - 0.94) after adjustment for age, gender, BMI and energy intake. The Vegetable pattern showed a significant risk increase (Hazard ratio = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.03 - 6.90) after adjustment for age, gender and BMI. The Traditional Japanese pattern had no relationship to the risk of fall-related fracture. The results of this study have the potential to reduce fall-related fracture risk in elderly Japanese. The results should be interpreted in light of the overall low meat intake of the Japanese population.\n\n[Elderly women and alcohol].\n\nPubMed\n\nMoscato, Alba\n\nIt is important to understand the reasons for alcohol abuse in elderly people and in particular women.

This study uses data collected from 1,250 elderly women living in urban areas. The regression model was used to examine the influence of elderly women's participation in productive activities on their life satisfaction. Elderly women who participate in volunteer work, learning, and social group activities commonly recognized their activities as meaningful, feeling like worthwhile members of society, and evaluated such activities as very positive. In contrast, elderly women who participated in household chores and family care activities expressed a negative life satisfaction. The difference in life satisfaction regarding productive activities stems not only from the physical and environmental differences but also from the gap between the official social value underpinned by the recognition of surrounding people, their support, and the value of productive activities.\n\nAssociation of sarcopenia with functional decline in community-dwelling elderly subjects in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanimoto, Yoshimi; Watanabe, Misuzu; Sun, Wei; Tanimoto, Keiji; Shishikura, Kanako; Sugiura, Yumiko; Kusabiraki, Toshiyuki; Kono, Koichi\n\n2013-10-01\n\nThe present study aimed to determine the association of sarcopenia, defined by muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance, with functional disability from a 2-year cohort study of community-dwelling elderly Japanese people. Participants were 743 community-dwelling elderly Japanese people aged 65 years or older. We used bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure muscle mass, grip strength to measure muscle strength, and usual walking speed to measure physical performance in a baseline study. Functional disability was defined using an activities of daily living (ADL) scale and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale at baseline and during follow-up examinations 2 years later. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and body mass index, was used to examine the association between sarcopenia and the occurrence of functional disability. In the present study, 7.8% of men and 10.2% of women were classified as having sarcopenia. Among sarcopenia patients in the baseline study, 36.8% of men and 18.8% of women became dependent in ADL at 2-year follow up. From the logistic regression analysis adjusted by age and body mass index, sarcopenia was significantly associated with the occurrences of physical disability compared with normal subjects in both men and women. Sarcopenia, defined by muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance, was associated with functional decline over a 2-year period in elderly Japanese. Interventions to prevent sarcopenia are very important to prevent functional decline among elderly individuals.

Cross-sectional study. Community hospital in Japan. Subjects were people with diabetes aged 65Â years and older being treated on an outpatient basis at the Ise Red Cross Hospital. We used the Japanese version of the self-administered cognitive test Test Your Memory (TYM-J) to measure MCI and the self-administered questionnaire SARC-F-J, consisting of 5 items, to evaluate sarcopenia. We conducted a multiple logistic regression analysis with MCI as the dependent variable and sarcopenia as the explanatory variable to calculate the odds ratio of sarcopenia in association with MCI. A total of 250 cases (150 men and 100 women) were included in our study. The prevalence of sarcopenia in this sample was 19.5% and that of MCI was 40.3%. The adjusted odds ratio of sarcopenia in association with MCI was 2.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-7.70, PÂ =Â .032). A statistically significant association was found between sarcopenia and MCI in an assessment of elderly patients with diabetes using the SARC-F-J.

Migration studies indicate that elderly migrant women are passive, ill victims caught in a marginalized position due to age, ethnicity and gender, and thus have little access to opposition and agency. To broaden the picture it is necessary to develop an innovative approach to understand what is implicated in the process of migration.
