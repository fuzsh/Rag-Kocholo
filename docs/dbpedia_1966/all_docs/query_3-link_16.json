        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis post‐hoc analysis demonstrated the long‐term safety and efficacy of tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID therapy in patients from East Asia in OCTAVE Open, with generally similar safety and efficacy profiles versus the OCTAVE Open global study population. 9\n\nDuring OCTAVE Open, the safety profile of tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID in patients from East Asia was largely consistent with the results of the global analysis. 9 The frequencies of AEs and SAEs were similar between tofacitinib treatment groups. Consistent with findings from OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2, and OCTAVE Sustain, as well as the OCTAVE Open global study population, 10 nasopharyngitis remained one of the most common TEAEs.\n\nPatients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at higher risk of HZ versus the general population, and the risk is further increased by treatment with immunosuppressive therapies. 11 , 12 The IR for HZ (non‐serious and serious) for all tofacitinib patients reported in this study (IR per 100 PY, 6.07 [95% CI, 3.40–10.02]) was higher than those reported in the general population in Japan (IR per 100 PY, 0.48 [CI not reported]) 13 and Korea (IR per 100 PY, 1.04 [CI not reported]). 14 Furthermore, the IR for HZ (non‐serious and serious) for all tofacitinib patients was higher than those reported in patients with UC from Korea (IR per 100 PY, 1.93 [1.84–2.02]), 15 in patients with IBD from Japan (IR per 100 PY, 0.74 [0.52–1.02]), 11 and numerically higher than real‐world data from patients with UC in the United States who were treated with tofacitinib (IR per 100 PY, 3.29 [1.37–7.90]). 16\n\nThe reason for the higher HZ incidence among patients from East Asia, compared with the global population of patients with UC treated with tofacitinib, remains unclear. In a study of HZ among patients in the global OCTAVE UC clinical program, multivariate analyses identified age and prior TNFi failure as independent risk factors for HZ. 6 The study also found that patients of the Asian race had a higher risk of HZ compared with patients of other races, although this finding was not statistically significant in the multivariate model. 6 A genetic analysis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis treated with tofacitinib identified a rare single nucleotide polymorphism associated with HZ risk that was more prevalent in Japanese patients than Caucasian patients, which could have contributed to the increased risk within the population from Japan observed here. 17 Furthermore, two separate reports that analyzed data from phase 2, 3, and open‐label, long‐term extension studies of tofacitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated that there was a trend toward higher IRs in patients receiving tofacitinib and prednisone (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), compared with those not taking prednisone, and a trend toward higher IRs among patients who received tofacitinib with corticosteroids and conventional synthetic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs, compared with tofacitinib monotherapy, respectively. 18 , 19\n\nPrevious analyses of global data from OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2, and OCTAVE Sustain, indicated that there was an elevated risk of HZ in patients with UC who were treated with tofacitinib. 5 , 6 An in vitro study that investigated the effect of tofacitinib on epithelial cells suggested that the mechanism behind the increased HZ risk associated with tofacitinib may be related to inhibition of antiviral immunity. 20 In the OCTAVE Open global study population, IRs for HZ were numerically similar between tofacitinib dose groups (IR per 100 PY, 2.08 [1.11–3.55] and 3.55 [2.71–4.58] for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID, respectively). 9 This was also true in our analysis; however, it should be noted that IRs were numerically higher among patients from East Asia (IR per 100 PY, 5.77 [1.57–14.76] and 6.19 [3.09–11.08] for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID, respectively) versus the global study population. The potential dose‐dependency of HZ has been discussed previously; 21 however, the differences in extent of exposure in this study (74.6 PY for tofacitinib 5 mg BID versus 199.2 PY for tofacitinib 10 mg BID) and in the OCTAVE Open global study population (643.7 PY for tofacitinib 5 mg BID versus 1797.0 PY for tofacitinib 10 mg BID), as well as the differences in study population sizes (particularly the small tofacitinib 5 mg BID group), should be noted when comparing the IRs between doses and studies.\n\nIn agreement with previous analyses of HZ in the overall tofacitinib UC clinical program, and similar to the OCTAVE Open global study population, most HZ cases among patients from East Asia were non‐serious. 6 , 9 IRs for HZ did not increase over time.\n\nCorticosteroid use is associated with increased risk of HZ, particularly in patients with IBD. 22 Although corticosteroid tapering was mandatory for patients entering OCTAVE Open, patients unable to tolerate tapering could remain in the study on a dose < 10 mg/day. Here, of the 15 patients who had HZ events, six remained on corticosteroids throughout the study.\n\nExcluding the higher incidence of HZ, the IRs for AESI in the population from East Asia were similar to the global study population. As in the overall tofacitinib UC clinical program, the OCTAVE Open global study population and the overall tofacitinib UC program, serious infections were infrequent in patients from East Asia, with similar IRs reported in the three populations. 9 , 21 Serious infections were infrequent with tofacitinib treatment in the current study, in keeping with real‐world data from various regions. 23 , 24\n\nIn patients from East Asia, no deaths or venous thromboembolic events, one adjudicated malignancy, and one adjudicated MACE were reported. Continuous monitoring is required to evaluate the long‐term safety of tofacitinib in patients with UC from East Asia, and post‐marketing surveillance studies are ongoing in Japan and Korea.\n\nIn keeping with the findings from the OCTAVE Open global study population, the proportion of patients with abnormal AST or ALT values (≥ 3 × the ULN) was numerically higher in the tofacitinib 5 versus 10 mg BID group. 9 While there were no notable differences in baseline disease characteristics or prior therapies between the tofacitinib treatment groups, aside from higher baseline corticosteroid use in the tofacitinib 10 versus 5 mg BID group, the body mass index (BMI) of the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group was numerically higher than the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group. This slight difference in BMI could account for the elevated liver enzyme levels observed in patients who received tofacitinib 5 mg BID, as was noted in a study of patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with tofacitinib. 25\n\nThis analysis showed that the proportions of patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group who achieved the efficacy endpoints up to 36 months remained high throughout the observation period. When assessed by NRI‐LOCF, a lower proportion of patients in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group achieved clinical response at month 36 (54.2%) versus the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (68.2%), as in the OCTAVE Open global study population (40.3% and 66.9% at month 36, respectively). 9 Notably, patients who were assigned to the tofacitinib 10 mg BID group were not in remission at baseline; hence, they were likely a more treatment‐refractory population versus the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group. This may explain the difference in proportions of patients achieving the efficacy endpoints. Despite the differences between dose groups, exploratory efficacy results for endoscopic improvement and remission support sustained efficacy with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID through to month 36 in patients from East Asia.\n\nLimitations for the OCTAVE Open study were reported previously. 9 Here, the sample size of the cohort from East Asia was small (n = 105) compared with the OCTAVE Open global study population (n = 944), and the ability to detect and compare AEs with low occurrence rates was limited, particularly due to the small number of patients in each treatment group. Our results should, therefore, be interpreted with caution and may not be generalizable to the entire East Asian population. Furthermore, differences in disease activity between patient populations at study enrollment may have impacted study outcomes. Tofacitinib dose assignment was based on baseline remission status and, due to this study design, 79% of patients from East Asia were assigned to tofacitinib 10 mg BID. Due to these differences, and because dose adjustments were allowed during the study, between‐group comparisons are limited, and dose‐dependency of AEs could not be established. Finally, OCTAVE Open had no placebo or active comparator arm, limiting the direct comparability of tofacitinib to other UC therapies, including other biologics.\n\nIn conclusion, in patients from East Asia who enrolled in OCTAVE Open, tofacitinib was efficacious and demonstrated long‐term safety profiles that were generally consistent with those of the global study population. Compared with the global study population, the IR of HZ (non‐serious and serious) was numerically higher among patients from East Asia. Therefore, patients with UC from East Asia who are receiving tofacitinib treatment may have an increased risk of HZ and should be monitored closely."
