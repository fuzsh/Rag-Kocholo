        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Japanese clouded salamander, Hynobius nebulosus, originally described as Salamandra nebulosa from Nagasaki, Kyushu (Temminck et Schlegel, 1838), is the type species of the genus Hynobius Tschudi, 1838, which is the type genus of the family Hynobiidae Cope, 1859. The genus Hynobius is now very large containing about 40 species from Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and China (excluding the enigmatic H. turkestanucus Nikolskii, 1910 from central Asia: Frost, 2018) with the center of speciation in Japan. Hynobius nebulosus occurs mainly in the lowlands of western Japan, including the mainland and adjacent small islands (Fig. 1). It is basically a lentic breeder and usually breeds in still waters, such as wetlands and small pools (Sato, 1943), but some populations from the Chugoku District in western Honshu breed in high altitude wetlands and sometimes in small streams (Okawa and Utsunomiya, 1989).\n\nAlthough H. nebulosus is currently viewed as a representative widespread salamander in western Japan, contents of this species experienced complicate taxonomic history. Dunn (1923a) described H. vandenburghi from Nara, Yamato Province, Hondo (mainland of Japan), H. ikishimae from Iki-shima Is., Tsushima Straits, H. bicolor from southern Tsushima Is., and H. tagoi from northern Tsushima Is., all as allied to H. nebulosus from Kyushu. He (Dunn, 1923b) further proposed the name “nebulosus group” to accommodate them, where H. bicolor was synonymized with H. tsuensis Abe, 1922.\n\nHowever, Oyama (1930) found the characters listed by Dunn (1923a) to differentiate H. ikishimae and H. nebulosus are all unreliable. For the taxonomic study of the H. nebulosus group, Sato (1934) used skull morphology, which he found useful in interspecific comparisons of H. kimurae Dunn, 1923 (Sato, 1933), and completely confirmed Oyama's (1930) taxonomic idea about H. nebulosus and H. ikishimae. Regarding H. tsuensis and H. tagoi from Tsushima Is., Sato (1934) closely examined body color, which Dunn (1923a) used to differentiate them, of a large number of specimens, and found them quite variable. He also studied egg sacs and skull morphology and concluded them conspecific, as to be called H. tsuensis. Additionally, Sato (1934) doubted the heterospecific status of H. vandenburghi and H. nebulosus, and because they were differentiated only by subtle differences in coloration and tail shape, he (Sato, 1934) considered them as conspecific.\n\nAnother topic related to the taxonomy of H. nebulosus is the discovery of a salamander from Nagoya, Chubu District of central Honshu. It was identified by Sato (1934) as H. tokyoensis Tago, 1931, which had been known from the Kanto District disjunct from Chubu, and unequivocally considered to be closely related but distinct from H. nebulosus (Sato, 1934, 1943). However, Ebitani (1952) found H. tokyoensis from Chubu and H. nebulosus from Nagasaki to be very similar in skull morphology, and suggested their conspecificity. Additionally, Kawamura (1953) obtained fertile hybrids among some populations of these two species. Nakamura and Uéno (1963) thus treated them as two different subspecies, H. n. nebulosus and H. n. tokyoensis.\n\nMorphological and ecological studies of H. nebulosus from western Japan were initiated in the 1980s by Utsunomiya and Okawa (1987), and presence of several distinct morphotypes has been reported (e.g., Okawa et al., 2009). Similarly in the 1980s, biochemical techniques became applied to salamander systematics in Japan (Matsui and Miyazaki, 1984) and in Matsui (1987), relationships of H. nebulosus with some other species were assessed based on allozyme variations. Also, through allozymic comparisons, Matsui et al. (2001) found H. tokyoensis from Chubu to be conspecific with H. nebulosus, but heterospecific with H. tokyoensis from Kanto District. Matsui et al. (2006) made a comprehensive allozymic variation study in 46 populations of H. nebulosus, and recognized two major groups (western group from Kyushu to westernmost Chugoku, and an eastern group from Shikoku through Kinki to Chubu) and two less clearly defined groups (montane group from the Chugoku Mountains, and a Chugoku group from northern coastal Chugoku).\n\nMeanwhile, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses were applied to the study of genetic variations and phylogenetic relationships of Hynobius salamanders (e.g., Matsui et al., 2007a; Aoki et al., 2013). Matsui et al. (2007a) studied complete sequences of cytochrome b (cyt b) and control region (CR) genes among populations of H. tokyoensis, where populations of H. nebulosus from Chubu (Aichi, Mie) and Kinki regions were included. Confirming Matsui et al. (2001), populations of H. nebulosus formed a clade, which was sister to the clade of H. tokyoensis. Aoki et al. (2013) also performed mitochondrial cyt b analysis of H. lichenatus Boulenger, 1883, and found distinct clades.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies based on mtDNA analysis revealed cryptic diversity within species of other Japanese small salamanders (e.g., Tominaga et al., 2006; Yoshikawa et al., 2008), and using mtDNA markers for H. nebulous is expected to be effective for elucidating intraspecies cryptic diversity. However, no detailed DNA study of H. nebulosus has been done that is equivalent to allozymic study by Matsui et al. (2006) or studies on H. tokyoensis (Matsui et al., 2007a) and H. lichenatus (Aoki et al., 2013).\n\nInstead, several H. nebulosus have been used as reference in the study of other species. In describing H. mikawaensis Matsui, Misawa, Nishikawa et Shimada, 2017, Matsui et al. (2017a) used mitochondrial cyt b gene to estimate phylogeny, and included H. nebulous from three separate regions (Aichi, Tottori, and Nagasaki). As a result, samples of H. nebulosus from three populations did not form a clade with each other, but the Tottori sample was sister species to the clade of H. mikawaensis, H. takedai Matsui et Miyazaki, 1984 and H. nigrescens Stejneger, 1907, Aichi sample to H. tokyoensis, and the Nagasaki sample to H. dunni Tago, 1931. Genetic divergences between different populations as estimated by uncorrected p-distance were larger than those observed among recognized species. The study demonstrated high variation and cryptic genetic diversity within H. nebulosus, which has long been studied since Dunn (1923a, b).\n\nThus, H. nebulosus, currently treated as a single species, is surely a composite of cryptic species, yet the magnitude and pattern of geographical differentiation of this species are still unclear. Therefore, a comprehensive mtDNA and nuclear DNA survey was conducted to elucidate geographical variation and genealogical structure throughout the range of salamanders now called H. nebulosus and to define the boundaries of species within them.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTwo hynobiid salamanders collected by von Siebold were described and named by Temminck and Schlegel (1838): Salamandra naevia (currently H. naevius) and Salamandra nebulosa (currently H. nebulosus). These represent southwestern Japanese lotic and lentic breeding species, respectively. More recently, H. naevius was split into two distinct species, H. naevius and H. yatsui Oyama, 1947 (Tominaga and Matsui, 2008), and the types of H. naevius were shown to have come from Tara-cho, Saga Prefecture (Tominaga and Matsui, 2007). Another species, H. yatsui, is now called H. stejnegeri after complicated taxonomical considerations (Matsui et al., 2017b).\n\nIn contrast, the taxonomic revision of H. nebulosus was delayed after early research during the 1920s to 1940s by Dunn, Oyama, and Sato. Of these, Sato published a monumental monograph of the Japanese Caudata (Sato, 1943), but seems to have studied H. nebulosus from Hiroshima very little, even though this is where he lived. Instead, he (Sato, 1943) mistook a population of that species from Yatsugi in Hiroshima as H. abei, which he had originally described from Tango Province, Kyoto Prefecture.\n\nShibata (1979) compiled distribution data for H. nebulosus, noting some interesting records in Hiroshima, Kagawa, and Nagano Prefectures. Taeko Utsunomiya energetically made a field survey (e.g., Utsunomiya and Utsunomiya, 1998) with Y. Utsunomiya, H. Okawa, M. Matsui, and T. Seto, and clarified the occurrence of several distinct morphotypes including the Highland type, later discovered in wider regions covering Tottori through Hiroshima to Okayama, and eventually in western Hyogo. Because typical Highland type looks like H. hidamontanus that Matsui (1987) described from central Japan, he further tried to find out the distribution of the form, but has failed to find specimens further to the east. Distinct clades have been reported (e.g., Okawa and Utsunomiya, 1989; Okawa et al., 2007, 2009), chiefly on morphological grounds over these 30 years and were mostly confirmed in the present genetic investigations.\n\nIt is notable that lineages of so-called H. nebulosus frequently form clades in mtDNA not with other conspecific lineages but with other named species. For example, the sister species of H. bakan sp. nov. was H. dunni, and H. abuensis sp. nov. was the sister to H. tosashimizuensis. This was first proved by mtDNA, which shows only matrilineal lineages. However, MIG-seq, including a lot of nuclear genomic SNPs, also confirmed recognition of mitochondrial lineages. Thus the molecular, as well as morphological data sets, although less clearly, provides evidence that the concept of H. nebulosus as a single, widespread species (as in Sato, 1943; Nakamura and Uéno, 1963) must be rejected. Instead, the present data indicate that this is a complex of as many as nine species. The sympatry of H. setoi sp. nov. and H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov. also supports this idea.\n\nTable 5.\n\nEstimated divergence times (MY) of main divergences of lentic breeding Hynobius shown in Fig. 16.\n\nIn the phylogenetic tree based on cyt b gene, two major clades, A and B, were recognized, and in the latter, Clades B1 and B2 were recognized. Clade A included H. lichenatus, H. abei, H. nigrescens, H. mikawaensis, H. takedai, H. tokyoensis, H. setoi sp. nov., H. vandenburghi, and H. setouchi sp. nov., whereas Clade B1 contained H. okiensis, H. tsuensis, H. dunni, H. nebulosus, H. iwami sp. nov., and H. bakan sp. nov., and Clade B2 encompassed H. tosashimizuensis, H. hidamontanus, H. abuensis sp. nov., H. akiensis sp. nov., and H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov.\n\nThese groupings fairly well agree with those obtained by Matsui et al. (2006) based on enzyme variation. Of members in Clade A, H. setoi sp. nov. corresponds to the Chugoku group, and H. vandenburghi and H. setouchi sp. nov. represent the Eastern group of Matsui et al. (2006) based on enzyme variation. Whereas H. nebulosus, H. iwami sp. nov., and H. bakan sp. nov. in Clade B1, and H. abuensis sp. nov. in Clade B2 are in the Western group. Hynobius utsunomiyaorum sp. nov. in Clade B2 corresponds to the Montane group of Matsui et al. (2006). Samples not assigned to any group in Matsui et al. (2006) are H. akiensis sp. nov. in Clade B2 and part of H. iwami sp. nov. in Clade B1.\n\nIn the present result, Clade A contained species from central and northeastern species like H. abei and H. lichenatus, and surely originated in regions northwards to central Japan. Because H. setoi sp. nov. formed a clade with the clade of these species it is not close to H. nebulosus from southwestern Japan, although the two species commonly have a large body and yellow stripes on the tail. This morphological resemblance would be a result of convergence, or some characteristics like possession of a yellow tail stripe may represent plesiomorphic states, and further studies are badly needed.\n\nHynobius vandenburghi proved to be phylogenetically remote from H. nebulosus, rejecting Sato's (1934) idea of their conspecific status, but supporting Dunn's (1923b) original view. On the other hand, it was a sister species to H. tokyoensis, supporting earlier taxonomy based on morphology (Sato, 1937). Intraspecific variation was great and populations from Aichi Prefecture were split in two. Of these, one is remote from more western populations like Nara and Kyoto with a large p-distance, and might be split from H. vandenburghi (type locality=Nara) as a distinct species.\n\nThe third species in Clade A, H. setouchi sp. nov., was sister to the clade including H. vandenburghi and H. tokyoensis, and occurred in regions around Seto Inland Sea, i.e., eastern Shikoku and inland regions of southwestern Kinki region. The species was found very close to H. vandenburghi in southern Osaka. The possibility that their sympatric occurrence is not precluded. Further detailed survey is required.\n\nSpecies in Clade B1 and B2 were close to Chinese and Korean species (data not shown) and had no relatives in central to northeastern Japan except for H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov., whose relative, H. hidamontanus occurs in highland of central Japan.\n\nClade B1 included H. nebulosus, H. bakan sp. nov., and H. iwami sp. nov. together with H. dunni, H. tsuensis, and H. okiensis. Hynobius tsuensis from Tsushima Island is actually a lotic breeder (Sato, 1943), but has been generally regarded as a close relative of H. nebulosus since its description (Dunn, 1923b). Hynobius tsuensis and H. okiensis have 2N=56 chromosomes, like lentic breeding H. nebulosus and H. dunni, and unlike other lotic-breeders with 58 chromosomes (Seto et al., 1987). Thus, changes in breeding habits appear to have occurred in different lineages independently of karyotypic evolution in Japanese small salamanders. Like H. tsuensis, H. okiensis is ecologically grouped with lotic-breeders such as H. naevius, H. kimurae, or H. boulengeri (Sato, 1943), and the degree of adaptation to the lotic environment seems greater than in H. tsuensis (Matsui et al., 2007b).\n\nHynobius okiensis did not form a clade with H. setoi sp. nov., even though it occurs on the opposite shore on Oki Island and thought to have diverged from eastern members (Clade A). Instead, H. okiensis is thought to have diverged from the western members because it was grouped in the western Clade B1.\n\nHynobius iwami was close to a clade of H. nebulosus and H. bakan sp. nov., although it is geographically separated from H. nebulosus and H. bakan sp. nov. by the area occupied by H. abuensis sp. nov. From the pattern of distribution, H. iwami and H. okiensis might have a common ancestor.\n\nHynobius bakan sp. nov. has isolated populations in Oita, Kyushu based on mtDNA analysis, and this confirms results from allozymes (Matsui et al., 2006). The species is also close to H. dunni from eastern Kyushu. Although the two species have been recorded from the same locality (Usa and Bungotakada), whether they are parapatric or sympatric is not confirmed and requires investigation (Sugawara et al., 2017).\n\nSamples of H. nebulosus from Nagasaki and Isahaya, including the topotypic population, formed a clade distinct from samples from the other regions for unknown reasons. The populations from Iki Islands, once called H. ikishimae, were within the range of variation of other populations of H. nebulosus and their conspecific relationship first proposed by Oyama (1930) and Sato (1934) was confirmed.\n\nIn Clade B2, H. abuensis sp. nov. was the sister species to H. tosashimizuensis from Western Shikoku, but the species was distinct from the latter and the others with egg sacs having striations, which condition is wellknown in H. abei and H. lichenatus from central to eastern Japan (Matsui and Matsui, 1980). However, they are phylogenetically not close either, and compared with these northern species, the striations of H. abuensis sp. nov. are much weaker. Morphology of egg-sac envelope markedly varies even in a closely related species pair like H. mikawaensis and H. nigrescens, and possession of striations on egg-sacs could be a convergence among H. abuensis sp. nov., H. abei, and H. lichenatus.\n\nHynobius akiensis sp. nov. occurs inland to coastal regions of Hiroshima and Imabari, Shikoku. Thus, salamanders hitherto called H. nebulosus on Shikoku seem to have two origins, one from Hiroshima (H. akiensis sp. nov.) and another one from western Kinki (H. setouchi sp. nov.). Okawa and Utsunomiya (1992) considered populations from the northern region of Hiroshima (Akitakata-shi, Miyoshi-shi, and Kitahiroshima-cho) to be transitional types from the Highland type (H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov.). However, the direction of “transition” is not clear, and the populations should be better called as mixed ones. The present genetic analysis resulted in poor resolution of phylogenetic relationships in mtDNA of H. akiensis sp. nov. and H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov. Also in MIG-seq, a few individuals in Clade B2b2 (H. akiensis sp. nov.) showed probable past hybridization with the neighboring clades, i.e., H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov.\n\nInterestingly, some populations of the Hynobius X (Okawa and Utsunomiya, 1989) or the Highland morphotype (Okawa et al., 1998) included highly variable cyt b genotypes, and some of them proved to be genetically very close to H. hidamontanus, suggesting possible gene flow between them, although their current geographical distribution is widely separated from each other, and no salamanders like them are known in between.\n\nAfter the description of H. hidamontanus from Nagano Prefecture, H. tenuis Nambu, 1991 was described from Toyama Prefecture (Nambu, 1991), but they proved to be nearly identical in allozymes characteristics and the latter was synonymized with the former (Matsui et al., 2002). In our preliminary survey in mtDNA, populations of H. hidamontanus from Nagano and Toyama were very similar and both were contained in the clade of Highland morphotype (data not shown). In spite of our intensive field survey over the past 30 years, salamanders like H. hidamontanus or the Highland morphotype from the Chugoku regions have not been discovered from montane regions between them that are at least 260 km apart in straight-line distance. As far as we know, degree of genetic differentiation of the High Highland morphotype from H. hidamontanus is not large, but they could be viewed as heterospecific. The mean uncorrected pairwise sequence divergences of 3.0–7.4% between them are similar to those reported for some heterospecific pairs of Hynobius (2.9% between H. ikioi and H. amakusaensis, 3.9% between H. ikioi and H. osumiensis, 5.7% between H. nigrescens and H. takedai, 5.9% between H. mikawaensis and H. nigrescens, and 6.7% between H. mikawaensis and H. takedai: Matsui et al., 2017a; Nishikawa and Matsui, 2014). Thus, we had at present better to treat the Highland morphotype as H. utsunomiyaorum, a species close to, but distinct from H. hidamontanus.\n\nHistory of differentiation\n\nHynobius nebulosus and the related salamanders here revised are all endemic to Japan and mainly distributed in the area north (the Inner Zone) of MTL (Major [Median] Tectonic Line), and west of ISTL (Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line), although a few populations have slightly invaded into the Outer Zone. MTL was formed 20–15MYBP, while ISTL was formed in the Mid Miocene (Isozaki et al., 2010).\n\nAges of divergences of H. nebulosus and related species from the lotic breeders we estimated were all later than these periods, and all events related to differentiation are thought to have occurred in the area north of MTL and west of ISTL (Kinki to Chubu regions in Honshu, coastal areas of Shikoku, and northwestern areas of Kyushu).\n\nIt has been estimated that the Hynobius species occurring outside of Japan arose among lineages of the Japanese species (e.g., Nishikawa et al., 2010; Weisrock et al. 2013). In our age estimation, major diversifications of H. nebulosus and related salamanders all occurred in the Late Miocene. These include divergence between the northeastern and southwestern clades (Clades A and B), separation of the Chinese and Korean lineages from Clade B, and divergences within the northeastern and southwestern clades in Japan.\n\nAs far as we know, no significant vicariant events are known in western Japan around Middle to Late Miocene, while the Chugoku Mountains were formed by wide-ranging crustal uplift during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. However, these ages experienced climatically very important changes. It is thought that large areas of the continents experienced drying, enhanced seasonality, and a restructuring of terrestrial plant and animal communities during the Late Miocene, and cooling in this epoch culminated with ocean temperatures dipping to near-modern values between about 7 and 5.4 MYBP (Herbert et al., 2016).\n\nUnfortunately, we have no direct evidence of the effect of these climate changes upon cladogenesis of East Asian Hynobius salamanders, but if indeed aridity in terrestrial ecosystem increased, populations would tend to be confined to wet habitats, being isolated from each other, resulting in prevention of gene exchange and enhancement of speciation.\n\nThe Highland morphotype, H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov., is particularly interesting, both biogeographically and phylogenetically. Hynobius utsunomiyaorum sp. nov. formed a clade with H. akiensis sp. nov., and their divergence was estimated to be around 3.2 MYBP in the early Pliocene. Around this epoch, about 3 to 2.5 MYBP in the late Pliocene, floral change is known to have occurred, due to cooling of climates and beginning of active mountain formation around sedimentary basins.\n\nOn the other hand, H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov. is genetically very close to H. hidamontanus with small sequence divergences (3.0–7.4%), indicating their separation roughly 1.8 MYBP in the Early Pleistocene. Thus, in the current Chugoku area, an ancestral salamander was split to give birth to lowland H. akiensis and montane H. utsunomiyaorum. This ancestral H. utsunomiyaorum seems to have enlarged its range towards east, eventually to the edge of ISTL, where H. hidamontanus currently occurs.\n\nHynobius hidamontanus is now distributed from eastern and western slopes of Japan Alps (Hida Mountains) and just east of Mt. Hakusan, but the populations occur widely apart. On the other hand, H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov. is now known nearly continuously from Shiso-shi, Hyogo Prefecture, westwards to Yasugi-shi. Areas between the ranges of these two species are mountainous, seemingly suitable for distribution, although there are no particularly high mountains. Thus, the past continuous distribution of their ancestor would have been split by environmental changes. It is noteworthy that so many resultant species are now genetically unique from each other and occurring allopatrically or parapatrically.\n\nPast gene flow surely happened between ancestors of H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov. and of H. akiensis sp. nov. as shown by MIG-seq results, but H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov. and H. hidamontanus might never have been contacted secondarily after geographic separation, probably due to changes in the areas connecting them by crustal movements. Around 1.6 MYBP, increasing global cooling forced subalpine coniferous forests to enlarge their distribution to the areas with lower elevations (Momohara, 2017). This would have induced gene flow between H. utsunomiyaorum sp. nov. and H. akiensis sp. nov. as noted above.\n\nDespite the high degree of morphological uniformity, the salamanders long treated as H. nebulosus are proving to be far more diverse than originally expected. As a result, the number of species in the genus Hynobius increased from current 39 species (Frost, 2018) to 46 species. At the same time, the highest diversity of the genus in Japan is confirmed by the present study. This diversity surpasses recent researches where integrative taxonomic studies have demonstrated that several other wide-ranging Japanese Hynobius are, in fact, species complexes (e.g., Tominaga and Matsui, 2008; Nishikawa and Matsui, 2014). Because wide areas of western Honshu, especially of the Chugoku District, have been surveyed over these 30 years, new species of Hynobius are not likely to be discovered. However, additional field researches in unexplored regions of Shikoku and the remaining regions of western Honshu are necessary so as to catalogue and protect this unrealized biodiversity.\n\nKey for typical specimens\n\n1.
