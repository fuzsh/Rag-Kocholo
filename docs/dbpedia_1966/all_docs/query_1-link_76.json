The twitcher shows clinical and histological features similar to those of human Krabbe-type leukodystrophy. We here present the results of a neurochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of the twitcher. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that in the particulate fraction of the spinal cord, myelin basic proteins (MBP) and proteolipid protein were decreased, and in the sciatic nerve fibers, PO protein, X, Y and MBP were clearly decreased. 2′,3′-Cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) activities of the pallium cerebri, brain stem and spinal cord of the twitcher were about 20% less than those of the control. However, in the sciatic nerve, the activity was half that of the control. Immunohistochemical studies were carried out by means of antisera against MBP and CNPase. There were clear patches indicating both MBP- and CNPase-negative reactions in the white matter of the central nervous system from the twitcher. The reaction on the section of sciatic nerve fibers from the twitcher showed a positive reaction only in a very limited number of fibers with both MBP and CNPase antisera. A clear astrocytic hypertrophy was detected by the antiserum against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Even in the grey matter of the cerebral cortex, strong GFAP-positive astrocytes were clearly observed. © 1985 Plenum Publishing Corporation.</p>\n\nThe gene expression of myelin basic proteins (MBPs) in shiverer mutant mice was investigated by the Northern and Southern hybridization techniques. In the control mice RNA molecules from the brains which were about 2,300 nucleotides in length were hybridized to cDNA of 1.8 kb encoding for a mouse MBP, but RNA from the brains of 3-week-old shiverer mutant mice contained no detectable amount of MBP transcripts hybridizing to this probe. Moreover the shiverer mutant mice lost several restriction fragments that hybridized to the same probe in the control mice when each of the five restriction enzymes, i.e., HindIII, PstI, PvuII, AccI, and StuI, was used. These data suggest that the shiverer mutation may correspond to the deletion of a large portion of MBP exon(s) in the gene, and this deletion causes inefficient transcription leading to the depletion of MBPs in the myelin and the dysmyelination observed in these mice.\n\n<p>P400 protein has been found in the cerebellum and localizes to Purkinje cells. It is a glycoprotein and reacts with plant lectins. Autoradiographic patterns of the protein profiles of mutant mice cerebella after intracranial injections of 14C-leucine were analyzed. P400 protein was one of the dominant proteins labeled in the control cerebellum. No incorporation of 14C-leucine to the position of P400 protein was found in the nervous and pcd mutant mice where no Purkinje cells and no P400 protein are present. P400 protein in weaver cerebellum was labelled more intensely than that in the control. In the staggerer mice, where dendritic arborization of Purkinje cell is poor and no spines are formed on the dendrites, no P400 protein was found and no 14C-leucine incorporation was observed to the position of P400 protein, suggesting that staggerer is a mutation where no P400 protein accumulated in the fractions being studied. P400 protein was phosphorylated independently of the presence of Ca2+. Among the proteins of the isolated Purkinje cells, P400 protein was one of the major proteins phosphorylated.</p>\n\n<p>Myelin deficiency (mld) is an autosomal recessive mutation in mice and is considered to be allelic to the shiverer (shi) mutation. Mld mice are characterized by hypomyelination of the central nervous system (CNS). They show typical symptoms such as tremor, tonic convulsion and ataxic movement. Subcellular fractionation of the CNS revealed that the MBP bands were greatly decreased in the P2A (myelin) fraction and the total content of myelin basic protein (MBP) was much lower than that in the control in all parts of the CNS. Sections from mld mice were examined by immunohistochemical tests with MBP antiserum, and a mosaic expression of MBP was found in the myelin of the mld mice. Since the major dense line is considered to be composed mainly of MBP, we investigated the myelin of mld mice by electron microscopy and found that there were 3 types of myelin: (1) a normal type compact myelin with a major dense line, (2) a shiverer-type myelin with no major dense line, and (3) a mixed-type myelin, in which within a myelin lamella the major dense line abruptly changes to cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes.</p>\n\n<p>A hereditary dysmyelination mutation, named myelin deficient (mld), is considered to be allelic to shiverer, a deletion mutation of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene. The present study showed that MBP expression is greatly reduced in mld, but that it is still detectable. Northern blot analysis revealed that the pronounced decrease in the MBP level in mld resulted from a reduced mRNA level and was not caused by deletion of a large portion of the MBP gene as in shiverer. Southern blod studies with BamHI-digested chromosomal DNA suggested some part of the MBP gene, at least the 5'-portion, was duplicated in mld. These results indicated that the mld and shiverer mutations were different from each other, even though genetic allelism between the two was reconfirmed. We also examined the developmental pattern of the gene expression of MBP and that of another protein, myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), specifically expressed in the oligodendrocyte, in mld by RNA dot blot study. The mRNA level of MBP in mld was greatly reduced during the active myelination stages, gradually increasing and remaining constant in the later stages. The PLP-mRNA content in mld was almost normal (60-80% that of control) at any stage of development. All these findings imply that the primary defect in mld is due to reduced transcriptional activity of the MBP gene.</p>\n\n<p>The myelin deficient shimld mouse is an autosomal recessive mutant, characterized by hypomyelination in the central nervous system. The expression of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene is inhibited transcriptionally. The MBP gene is duplicated tandemly in mld, and exons 3 to 7 of the upstream copy is inverted. In the present studies, we determined the approximate position of the 5' boundary and the nucleotide sequence surrounding the 3' boundary of the inversion and found a number of sequences homologous to the switching regions of mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and J regions of human T cell receptor genes. Antisense RNA complementary to exons 3 and 7, which correspond to the inverted segment, was detected by RNase protection studies. This abnormal transcript was also shown to elongate through the inverted segment to reach the transcription initiation site of the downstream gene.</p>\n\n<p>The first hybrid mice ('shiverer*mld' mice) produced by intercrossing the homozygotes of the shiverer (BALB/c strain) and mld (MDB/Dt strain) were used for investigating the fine structure of the myelin lamellae, immunoreactive pattern for myelin basic proteins (MBP) and Golgi impregnated images of oligodendrocytes, with special reference to the influence of aging. All of the hybrid mice had an intermediate coat color between the white of the shiverer and black-brown of the mld, and revealed the same neurological symptoms, intention tremor, ataxic behavior, etc., as those of the shiverer and mld. The central myelin lamellae of the 'shiverer*mld' mouse exhibited the similar characteristics to the shiverer type rather than the mld type from the standpoint of the infrequent occurrence of major dense lines, although they did display a tendency to increase major dense lines with aging like the mld. Observation of the immunohistochemical preparations for MBP showed that immunopositive myelin sheaths were present in the white matter, although they were far more infrequent than those of the mld mutant, probably reflecting the amount of major dense lines. Thus, in the CNS of the 'shiverer*mld' mouse, the MBP-synthesis was possibly much more disturbed than in the mld mutant, or at least, revealed an intermediate pattern between the mld and shiverer. © 1988.</p>\n\n<p>The mouse proteolipid protein (PLP) gene was cloned into the λ bacteriophage Charon 4A. The organization and the nucleotide sequence of the exons of the mouse PLP gene were quite similar to those of their human counterparts, consisting of seven exons. The transcription of the PLP gene started from multiple sites. There was a unique sequence tandemly repeated four times, sharing homology with the herpes simplex virus DR2 sequence, upstream from the transcribed region. Expression of the myelin basic protein (MBP) is also restricted to the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system as is the PLP expression. Homology search against the mouse MBP gene revealed that several boxes in the 5′-flanking region of PLP show a high degree of homology with the sequence present in the MBP 5′-flanking region, possibly of importance in the concomitant expression of both genes in the central nervous system. PLP-mRNA in jimpy mutant mice does not contain exon 5 and its content is greatly reduced. We analyzed the jimpy PLP-mRNA and showed that the transcription initiated from the same sites as those in normal mice. Cloning and sequencing of the 5′-flanking region of the jimpy PLP gene revealed that there were no mutations in the promoter region of the jimpy PLP gene. Therefore, it is likely that a mutation, presumably existing within the jimpy PLP gene, caused the skipping of exon 5 and directly affected the mRNA level. © 1987.</p>\n\n<p>A hereditary dysmyelinating mutation, named myelin deficient (shi(mld)), is characterized by reduced expression of myelin basic protein (MBP). In shi(mld), the MBP gene is duplicated and its reduced expression is mainly determined by the level of mRNA. We have characterized the structure and function of the promoter regions of the duplicated MBP genes in shi(mld). Among the lambda clones containing promoter regions of the duplicated MBP genes in shi(mld), one (gene 1) had the same restriction enzyme pattern as that in control mice, but another (gene 2) had a rearrangement on a distal part of the promoter. A 712-bp nucleotide sequence upstream of the first exons of both of the duplicated MBP genes of shi(mld) was completely consistent with that of the control. Promoter activities of 1.3-kb 5'-flanking regions from respective genes of shi(mld) measured by in vitro run-off assay using HeLa whole-cell extracts were indistinguishable from that of the control MPB gene. Chromosomal mapping by in situ hybridization suggested that the duplicated MBP genes were located closely to each other at the distal part of chromosome 18. A recombinational event including the inversion seemed to have occurred within gene 1 and its possible relationship to the reduced expression of MBP is discussed.</p>\n\n<p>The shiverer and myelin-deficient (mld) mutants are two allelic mutations. Both are characterized by hypomyelination in the CNS and deficient expression of the MBP gene. Chimeric analysis of the pathogenesis of shiverer showed that shiverer mutation acts intrinsic to the oligodendrocyte, which is the only cell type expressing. The MBP gene in the CNS. Molecular genetic studies by several groups demonstrated that shiverer is a deletion mutation in the MBP gene. Consequently, no MBP is produced in the shiverer mutant. In mld, however, partial expression of the MBP gene was observed. Interestingly, MBP was expressed in a mosaic fashion in the CNS of mld mice. Molecular genetic studies revealed that the mld mutant has duplicated MBP genes in tandem on a distal part (E2-4) of chromosome 18q. The reduced expression was based on the level of mRNA. A large portion is inverted in the upstream copy, and an intact copy is located downstream. We showed in mld mutants that antisense RNA corresponding to the inverted segment is transcribed, and it forms RNA duplex, with the RNA transcribed from the normal gene located downstream.</p>\n\n<p>MAJOR histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are not normally expressed in the central nervous system (CNS)1-3. However, aberrant expression has been observed in multiple sclerosis lesions and could contribute to the destruction of myelin or the myelinating cells known as oligodendrocytes4,5. The mechanism of cell damage associated with aberrant MHC molecule expression is unclear: for example, overexpression of class I (ref. 6) and class II (refs 7, 8) MHC molecules in pancreatic β cells in transgenic mice leads to nonimmune destruction of the cells and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We have generated transgenic mice that express class I H-2Kb MHC molecules, under the control of the myelin basic protein promoter, specifically in oligodendrocytes. Homozygous transgenic mice have a shivering phenotype, develop tonic seizures and die at 15-22 days. This phenotype, which we term 'wonky', is due to hypomyelination in the CNS, and not to involvement of the immune system. The primary defect appears to be a shortage of myelinating oligodendrocytes resulting from overexpression of the class I MHC molecules.</p>\n\n<p>Myelin basic protein (MBP) is a major constituent in the myelin of the CNS. In mice, five forms of MBPs (14 kDa, two types of 17 kDa, 18.5 kDa, and 21.5 kDa) encoded by separate mRNAs have been identified based on cDNA cloning studies. These mRNAs are considered to be produced by alternative splicing from a single gene composed of seven exons. Here we report the existence of two novel MBP mRNAs encoding 19.7-kDa and 21-kDa MBPs identified by cDNA cloning using the polymerase chain reaction. Both of these MBPs contain a sequence of a previously unidentified exon of 66 nucleotides, which was mapped to be just 5′ of exon 5 in the MBP gene. MBP mRNAs containing this novel exon (exon 5a) belong to a minor population in the whole brain and PNS and are somewhat enriched in the spinal cord. Exon 5a encodes a very hydrophobic segment rich in valine residues, which presumably forms a β-pleated sheet.</p>\n\n<p>1. Myelin is an important structure for facilitating the conduction of impulses along the axons both in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). 2. Myelin basic protein (MBP) is a major protein in CNS myelin. 3. MBP is expressed specifically in the nervous system. 4. The MBP gene has been cloned and characterized. 5. Two mutant mice, Shiverer (shi) and myelin-deficient (mld, shimid), are autosomal recessive mutants that show severe symptoms such as intentional tremor. They have been found to have a mutation in the MBP gene that results in poor myelination in the central nervous system. 6. It was found that rearrangement within the MBP gene results in low expression of the gene. 7. In Shiverer, the MBP gene is partially deleted (from exons 3 to 7), and in mld, the gene is duplicated tandemly and a large portion of the duplication is inverted upstream of the intact copy. 8. In mld, anti-sense RNA complementary to exons 3-7, which correspond to the inverted segment, was detected by RNase protection studies, and presumed to be responsible for the reduced expressions of MBP. 9.The mechanism of gene rearrangement in MBP was also characterized. 10. This article reviews the recent progress in the study of the MBP gene, especially the rearrangement of the gene and its expression in mutant mice. © 1991.</p>\n\n<p>The myelin-deficient (mld) mouse is an autosomal recessive mutant characterized by hypomyelination of the CNS due to reduced expression of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene. In the mld mutant, the MBP gene is duplicated in tandem. One gene is intact, but a large portion is inverted upstream of the other copy, and its transcription yields the antisense RNA. This antisense RNA was shown to be localized in the nucleus and to form an RNA:RNA duplex with sense RNA. These findings suggested that inhibition of transport from the nucleus or selective degradation of the duplex is responsible for the reduced expression of the MBP gene in the mld mutant. The mechanism of gene rearrangement at the MBP locus was also characterized. Cosmid clones encompassing whole MBP gene loci from control and mld genomic DNA libraries were isolated. The recombination points indicated that the duplication and inversion observed in mld occurred due to nonhomologous recombination.</p>\n\n<p>Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) is a second messenger that releases Ca2+ from its intracellular stores. The InsP3 receptor has been purified and its cDNA has been cloned. We have found that the InsP3 receptor is identical to P400 protein, first identified as a protein enriched in cerebellar Purkinje cells. We have generated an L-fibroblast cell transfectant that produces cDNA-derived InsP3 receptors. The protein displays high affinity and specificity for InsP3. InsP3 induces greater Ca2+ release from membrane vesicles from transfected cells than from those from control L-fibroblasts. After incorporation of the purified InsP3 receptor into lipid bilayers InsP3-induced Ca2+ currents were demonstrated. These results suggest that the InsP3 receptor is involved in physiological Ca2+ release. Immunogold labelling using monoclonal antibodies against the receptor showed that it is highly concentrated on the smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum and slightly on the outer nuclear membrane and rough endoplasmic reticulum; no labelling of Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and plasmalemma was seen. Cross-linking experiments showed that the receptor forms a homotetramer. The approximately 650 N-terminal amino acids are highly conserved between mouse and Drosophila, and this region contains the critical sequences for InsP3 binding. We have investigated the heterogeneity of the InsP3 receptor using the polymerase chain reaction and have found novel subtypes of the mouse InsP3 receptor that are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally specific manner.</p>\n\n<p>To study the role of the IP3 receptor (IP3R) upon egg activation, cDNA clones encoding IP3R expressed in the Xenopus oocytes were isolated. By analyses of the primary structure and functional expression of the cDNA, Xenopus IP3R (XIP3R) was shown to have an IP3-binding domain and a putative Ca2+ channel region. Immunocytochemical studies revealed polarized distribution of XIP3R in the cytoplasm of the animal hemisphere in a well-organized endoplasmic reticulum-like structure and intensive localization in the perinuclear region of stage VI immature oocytes. In ovulated unfertilized eggs, XIP3R was densely enriched in the cortical region of both hemispheres in addition to its polarized localization. After fertilization, XIP3R showed a drastic change in its distribution in the cortical region. These results imply the predominant role of the XIP3R in both the formation and propagation of Ca2+ waves at fertilization. © 1993.</p>\n\n<p>The Drosophila strawberry (sty) locus was isolated by P-element insertion mutagenesis in a screen for mutations affecting eye development. Analysis of the mutant phenotype and the putative expression pattern of the sty gene suggested that it has multiple functions. Mutations in the sty gene lead to irregular spacing of ommatidia, an increase in the number of photoreceptor cells, as well as abnormal axonal projections to the lamina and disrupted structure of the optic lobes in the adult fly. The sty mutation also causes abnormal head involution, a change in a number of sensilla in the antennomaxillary complex in the embryonic stage and abnormal morphogenesis of the maxillary palp and wings in later stages. We examined the presumptive expression of the sty gene during development by histochemical staining for lacZ expression from enhancer trap elements inserted within the sty gene. During embryogenesis, expression of lacZ showed a segmental pattern in the ectoderm and in the nervous system. In the eye imaginal discs, lacZ was expressed in photoreceptor cells beginning a few rows posterior to the morphogenetic furrow. The lacZ was also expressed in the wing disc. In the adult, lacZ was expressed in the retina and lamina. We cloned the sty gene by P-element tagging and found that it encodes a putative secreted protein containing a cysteine-rich region similar to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat. On the basis of the loss of function phenotype, the expression pattern and the predicted structure of its product, we propose that sty encodes a diffusible protein acting as a signal involved in lateral inhibition within the developing nervous system and also as a factor involved either directly or indirectly in axonal guidance and optic lobe development.</p>\n\n<p>The Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) decapentaplegic (dpp) gene product plays an essential role during several stages of Dm development. The DPP protein is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and an orthologue of mammalian bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 and -4). Recently, a cDNA clone encoding the mouse Ser/Thr kinase receptor specific for BMP-2/-4 (mTFRll) was isolated. Here, we describe the deduced primary structure, the cytogenetic position and expression pattern of the Dm homologue of mTFR11 (DTFR), a putative DPP receptor. The cytogenetic position of the Dm dtfr gene was mapped to 25D. DTFR has striking homology to mTFR11, especially in the cytoplasmic domain (approx. 63%), including a Ser+Gly-rich box that is characteristic of type-I receptors for the TGF-β superfamily. Although the amino acid (aa) sequence of the extracellular domain is less conserved than that of the cytoplasmic domain, the extracellular domains of these two molecules were more homologous (approx. 27%) to each other than any other receptors for the TGF-β superfamily. The spacing of Cys residues in the extracellular domain, which is considered crucial to ligand specificity, is highly conserved in these two receptors. During Dm embryonic development, its expression pattern changes in a dynamic fashion with high levels of expression in mesoderm and midgut, with some relation to dpp mutant phenotypes. © 1994.</p>\n\n<p>We report the identification of a Drosophila locus, reversed polarity (repo). Weak repo alleles were viable but affected glia in the optic lobe, resulting in a reversal in polarity of the electrophysiological response to light in the adult. Strong repo alleles caused defects in embryonic glia and resulted in embryonic lethality. Expression of repo appeared to be specific to glia throughout development. In the adult visual system, repo was expressed in laminal glia, medullar glia, and subretinal cells; in the embryo, repo was expressed in nearly all of the identified glia in the central and peripheral nervous systems except midline glia. The repo gene encoded a homeo domain protein suggesting that it might be a transcriptional regulator of genes required for glial development.</p>\n\n<p>The Drosophila argos gene, which encodes a secreted protein with an EGF motif, is involved in several developmental processes regulating cell-cell interactions such as eye morphogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in the argos gene cause an increase in the number of photoreceptor cells and cone cells, impaired retinal projections to the optic lobe, and the formation of extra veins. We show here that ubiquitously expressed argos product restored all these loss-of-function phenotypes. Overexpression of argos in the wild- type background resulted in the reduced number of photoreceptor cells, cone cells, and pigment cells, which are phenotypes opposite to those of the loss- of-function mutants. The argos gene is expressed in developing wing veins. Ubiquitous argos expression caused loss of veins in a dose-dependent manner. This phenotype was enhanced by the loss-of-function rhomboid mutation, implying the possibility that argos and rhomboid play key roles in a common pathway for normal wing vein formation. We propose that argos acts as an inhibitory signal for cellular differentiation in the developing eye and wing.</p>\n\n<p>A family of neural RNA-binding proteins has recently been described in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We have identified a new member of this family, the Drosophila musashi (msi) locus, which is required for development of adult external sensory organs (sensilla). In contrast with wild-type sensilla, which contain two outer support cells, the msi mutation typically results in the appearance of extra outer support cells. The msi putative RNA-binding protein is localized to the nucleus and appears to be expressed in all cells in each sensillum and predominantly in neurons during embryogenesis. We propose that the msi protein regulates sensillum development by controlling the expression of target genes at the posttranscriptional level. © 1994.</p>\n\n<p>Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), the major myelin protein in the CNS, has been thought to function in myelin assembly. Thus, mutations within the gene coding for PLP (Plp) cause hypomyelination, such as the jimpy phenotype in mice and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease in humans. However, these mutants often exhibit premature death of oligodendrocytes, which form CNS myelin. To elucidate the functional roles of Pip gene products in the maturation and/or survival of oligodendrocytes, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing the Plp gene by introducing extra wild-type mouse Pip genes. Surprisingly, transgenic mice bearing 4 more Plp genes exhibited dysmyelination in the CNS, whereas those with 2 more Plp genes showed normal myelination at an early age (3 weeks after birth), but later developed demyelination. Overexpression of the Plp gene resulted in arrested maturation of oligodendrocytes, and the severity of arrest was dependent on the extent of overexpression. Overexpression also led to oligodendrocyte cell death, apparently caused by abnormal swelling of the Golgi apparatus. Thus, tight regulation of Plpgene expression is necessary for normal oligodendrocyte differentiation and survival, and its overexpression can be the cause of both dys- and demyelination. © 1994.</p>\n\n<p>Two types of determinants appear to be responsible for the generation of neural cell diversity: non-cell-autonomous and cell-autonomous cues. We have identified both types of determinants through the intensive screening of P-element induced Drosophila mutants affected in neural development. As a member of the first category argos (also referred to as strawberry or giant lens), which regulates cell-cell interaction in the developing nervous system, needs to be mentioned. On the basis of the phenotype on loss of function of argos, its expression pattern and the predicted structure of its product (a secreted protein with a putative epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif) we propose that argos encodes a diffusible protein with pleiotropic functions that acts as a signal involved in lateral inhibition within the developing nervous system and also as a factor involved in axonal guidance. As a member of the second category, I refer to the Drosophila musashi gene that is required for lineage formation and asymmetric division of precursor cells in the developing nervous system. The musashi gene encodes a neural RNA-binding protein and is thus likely to regulate the asymmetric cell division of neural precursor cells by controlling the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level. We have identified its mammalian homologue, mouse-musashi-1 (m-Msi-1). In the developing central nervous system (CNS), m-Msi-1 expression was highly enriched to neural precursor cells as is the expression of nestin. Based on the results of a single cell culture experiment, m-Msi-1 expression appears to be associated with multipotent cells that are capable of self-renewal and with the generation of committed precursor cells of both neurons and glia. However, fully differentiated neuronal and glial cells lost their m-Msi-1 expression. The expression of m-Msi protein showed a complementary pattern to that of another mammalian RNA-binding protein Hu, which is localized in differentiated neurons in the CNS. Based on such differential expression patterns and its similarity to the Drosophila musashi, we propose that a combination of neural RNA-binding proteins are required for the asymmetric distribution of intrinsic determinants in the developing mammalian nervous system. The Drosophila glial-specific homeobox protein, Repo, can also be classified as a cell-autonomous cue regulating cell-fate decision during neural development. Repo expression is required for terminal differentiation and for the survival of glial cells.</p>\n\n<p>Inhibitory signals of cellular differentiation from differentiating cells play an important role in regulating the number and spatial distribution of distinctive types of cells in developing tissues. Several types of inhibitory mechanisms of cellular differentiation have been identified by making full use of the developmental genetics of Drosophila compound eyes. These inhibitory mechanisms are distinct from each other in their signal transduction cascades and/or their role in the pattern formation of the developing Drosophila eye. The following events occur: firstly a diffusible protein, Scabrous (Sea), is required to confer regular spacings of the founder cells, R8 cells, or preommatidial clusters in the developing eye disc via an unknown signal transduction cascade, secondly the Notch-signalling is at least required for the single-out of the R8 cells within the pre-ommatidial cluster possibly by preventing other cells in the equivalent groups from adapting fates as R8 cells. Notch-signalling activates a simple signal cascade mediating communication between the plasma membrane and nucleus not via protein phosphorylation. In contrast, a novel diffusible ligand, Argos, was likely to be required subsequently to the selection of R8 cells. Argos was shown to inhibit the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase, DER, and the subsequent signal transduction in the Ras/MAPK cascade (the third inhibitory mechanism). We proposed that the role of Argos is to regulate the number of differentiated cells by controlling cellular differentiation and subsequent programmed cell death. The distinct roles of these inhibitory signals in the developing Drosophila eye are discussed in detail.</p>\n\n<p>Calcium signaling is known to be associated with cytokinesis; however, the detailed spatio-temporal pattern of calcium dynamics has remained unclear. We have studied changes of intracellular free calcium in cleavage- stage Xenopus embryos using fluorescent calcium indictor dyes, mainly Calcium Green-1. Cleavage formation was followed by calcium transients that localized to cleavage furrows and propagated along the furrows as calcium waves. The calcium transients at the cleavage furrows were observed at each cleavage furrow at least until blastula stage. The velocity of the calcium waves at the first cleavage furrow was ~3 μ/s, which was much slower than that associated with fertilization/egg activation. These calcium waves traveled only along the cleavage furrows and not in the direction orthogonal to the furrows. These observations imply that there exists an intracellular calcium releasing activity specifically associated with cleavage furrows. The calcium waves occurred in the absence of extracellular calcium and were inhibited in embryos injected with heparin, an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor antagonist. These results suggest that InsP3 receptor mediated calcium mobilization plays an essential role in calcium wave formation at the cleavage furrows.</p>\n\n<p>The Drosophila argos gene encodes a secreted protein with an EGF motif which acts as an inhibitor of cellular differentiation in multiple developmental processes. To investigate the cellular pathways regulated by Argos we screened for mutations which could modify the phenotype caused by overexpression of argos. We show that the effects of argos overexpression on the eye and wing vein development are suppressed by gain-of-function mutations of the MAPKK/D-MEK gene (Dsor1/D-mek) and the MAPK/ERK-A gene (rolled) and were enhanced by loss-of-function mutations of Star. Loss-of-function mutations in components of the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade act as dominant suppressors of the phenotype caused by the argos null mutation. A loss-of-function argos mutation enhanced the overproduction of R7 neurons caused by gain-of-function alleles of Son of sevenless and Dsor1. Conversely, overexpression of argos inhibited formation of the extra R7 cells that was caused by high-level MAPK/ERK-A activity. A phenotype of the sev; argos double mutants revealed that sev is epistatic to argos. These results provide evidence that Argos negatively regulates signal transduction events in the Ras/MAPK cascade.</p>\n\n<p>There is increasing interest in the role of RNA-binding proteins during neural development. Drosophila Musashi is one of the neural RNA-binding proteins essential for neural development and required for asymmetric cell divisions in the Drosophila adult sensory organ development. Here, a novel mammalian neural RNA-binding protein, mouse Musashi-1, was identified based on the homology to Drosophila Musashi and Xenopus NRP-1. In the developing CNS, mouse-Musashi-1 protein was highly enriched in the CNS stem cell. Single-cell culture experiments indicated that mouse Musashi-1 expression is associated with neural precursor cells that are capable of generating neurons and glia. In contrast, in fully differentiated neuronal and glial cells mouse-Musashi-1 expression is lost. This expression pattern of mouse-Musashi-1 is complementary to that of another mammalian neural RNA-binding protein, Hu (a mammalian homologue of a Drosophila neuronal RNA-binding protein Elav), that is expressed in postmitotic neurons within the CNS. In vitro studies indicated that mouse-Musashi-1 possesses binding preferences on poly(G) RNA homopolymer, whereas Hu is known to preferentially bind to short A/U-rich regions in RNA. Based on their differential expression patterns and distinct preferential target RNA sequences, we believe that the mouse-Musashi-1 and Hu proteins may play distinct roles in neurogenesis, either through sequential regulatory mechanisms or differential sorting of mRNA populations during asymmetric division of neural precursor cells.</p>\n\n<p>We characterized the embryonic expression pattern and mutant phenotypes of the Drosophila gene argos, which encodes a secreted protein with an epidermal growth factor motif. The argos null mutation caused an increase in chordotonal (Ch) organs in both the thoracic and the abdominal segments, whereas overexpression of the argos gene resulted in a decrease in these organs. We showed that the argos transcripts are expressed transiently in the cells surrounding the Ch organ precursor and that the gene rhomboid (rho), which is involved in the regulation of the number of Ch organs, acts epistatically to argos in this event. Our findings suggest that argos plays a role in Ch organ precursor formation and regulates the final number of Ch organs.</p>\n\n<p>The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor acts as an InsP3-gated Ca2+ release channel in a variety of cell types. Type 1 InsP3 receptor (IP3R1) is the major neuronal member of the IP3R family in the central nervous system, predominantly enriched in cerebellar Purkinje cells but also concentrated in neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region, caudate-putamen, and cerebral cortex. Here we report that most IP3R1-deficient mice generated by gene targeting die in utero, and born animals have severe ataxia and tonic or tonic-clonic seizures and die by the weaning period. An electroencephalogram showed that they suffer from epilepsy, indicating that IP3R1 is essential for proper brain function. However, observation by light microscope of the haematoxylin-eosin staining of the brain and peripheral tissues of IP3R1-deficient mice showed no abnormality, and the unique electrophysiological properties of the cerebellar Purkinje cells of IP3R1 deficient mice were not severely impaired.</p>\n\n<p>Activation of the membrane-bound phospholipase D (PLD) requires cytosolic factor(s), and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) has been identified as a cytosolic PLD activator. In the present study, we demonstrate that calmodulin (CaM) and ARF are both involved in PLD activation in rabbit peritoneal neutrophils. The PLD activity of streptolysin O-permeabilized, cytosol- depleted rabbit neutrophils was significantly enhanced when the permeabilized cells were reconstituted with bovine brain cytosol in the presence of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS), whereas there was little activation of the enzyme in the absence of cytosol. The GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity in the presence of cytosol was augmented on increasing the concentration of free Ca2+. The PLD activity stimulated by GTPγS and Ca2+ in this system was inhibited by the calmodulin inhibitor W-7. These findings suggest that CaM plays a role as a cytosolic PLD activator. Moreover, highly purified CaM alone, as well as partially purified ARF alone, promoted a slight stimulation of the PLD activity in permeabilized neutrophils. Interestingly, ARF-stimulated PLD activity was augmented by CaM in the presence of GTPγS and Ca2+. This augmentation was again inhibited by W-7, as well as by the structurally unrelated CaM inhibitor trifluoperazine. These data imply that CaM stimulates the PLD activity of rabbit neutrophils in concert with ARF.</p>\n\n<p>A recessive mutation, hiiragi(P1), on the second chromosome of Drosophila was obtained by P element insertion mutagenesis. Flies homozygous for hiiragi(P1) have notched wing margins. Genetic interactions between hiiragi and the genes that encode components of Notch signaling, such as Notch, Hairless, Serrate and deltex, strongly support the involvement of hiiragi in the signal transduction cascade of Notch. It has been reported that Serrate and Delta, other components of Notch signaling, share EGF-like repeats and a second conserved cysteine-rich motif, and that these components interact physically with the same region of Notch. In hiiragi(P1); Serrate(D)/+ double mutants, we observed synergistic enhancement of the notched phenotype of wing margins. In contrast, Delta(FX3) had no phenotypic effect on hiiragi(P1) in hiiragi(P1); Delta(FX3)/+ double mutants. Taken together, these results indicate that hiiragi is involved in the Notch signaling cascade induced by Serrate rather than by Delta.</p>\n\n<p>The Drosophila argos gene encodes a secreted protein with an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif, which acts as an inhibitor of cell recruitment in the developing eye and wing. Here, we have analyzed the role of argos during optic lobe development, argos expression was observed in the optic lobes throughout the developmental stages. In argos mutants, neuropiles failed to develop normally during embryonic and larval stages, and photoreceptor axons did not project properly into the lamina. Ubiquitous expression of argos, under control of the hsp70 promoter, rescued the defects in optic lobes. We have found that glial cells failed to differentiate in the larval optic lobes of argos mutants. Correspondingly, in loss-of-function repo mutants, whose glial cells also fail to differentiate, photoreceptor axons showed the impaired projection pattern similar to the argos phenotype. These results suggest that glial cells play a role for guidance of photoreceptor axons. The loss-of-function Star mutation (Star(X155)) dominantly suppressed the defects in the argos optic lobes, suggesting that these two genes act in an antagonistic fashion during optic lobe development.</p>\n\n<p>The type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) is expressed abundantly in the CNS, such as in cerebellar Purkinje cells and the hippocampus. We established a tissue-specific cell-free transcription system and studied regulatory properties of the 5' upstream region of the IP3R1 gene by use of this system. Deletion analyses of the promoter revealed several cis elements that function significantly in brain nuclear extracts. Among those elements, sequences from -396 to -295 showed the most predominant cerebellum-specific positive function. Footprint analyses demonstrated a factor-binding region from -334 to -318, termed box-I, that contained an E- box consensus sequence. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed CNS- related basic helix-loop-helix proteins for the box-I. Mutational studies using the function assay end competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a good correlation between the box-I-binding factors and the activated transcription. Box-I-binding factors were present abundantly in adult mouse CNS, whereas their existence was restricted in embryonic and nonneural tissues. Transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay for the IP3R1 promoter revealed the requirement of box-I in Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells. In the postnatal CNS, multiple basic helix-loop-helix factors are expressed abundantly, some of which are suggested to activate IP3R1 gene expression in the mammalian CNS.</p>\n\n<p>To study the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors during early embryogenesis in Xenopus, we examined the temporal-spatial localization of Xenopus IP3 receptor (XIP3R), XIP3R protein is enriched in the animal hemisphere of early cleavage stage embryos and becomes localized in the ectoderm and involuted mesoderm in gastrula stage embryos. Up to tailbud stages, expression of XIP3R is observed in the mesodermal tissues and in most subregions of the central nervous system. A quantitative analysis of endogenous IP3 mass during normal early embryogenesis revealed an increase in IP3 mass first observed at early gastrula stage of 10.5 with an enrichment in the ectoderm throughout the gastrula stages, implying a potential role during gastrulation.</p>\n\n<p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is thought to be one of the mediators responsible for the damage of oligodendrocytes (OLGs) in multiple sclerosis (MS). We report here the involvement of the interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (ICE)/Caenorhabditis elegans gene ced-3 (CED-3) family in TNF-mediated cell death of OLGs. The addition of TNF-α to primary cultures of OLGs that express ice and cpp32 significantly decreased the number of live OLGs in 72 h. DNA fragmentation was detected in TNF-treated OLGs at 36 h with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling assay. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH 2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene, an inhibitor of the ICE/CED-3 family that shows p35-like inhibitory specificity, protected against the TNF-induced cell death of OLGs. Furthermore, acetyl-YVAD-CHO (a specific inhibitor of ICE-like proteases) as well as acetyl-DEVD-CHO (a specific inhibitor of CPP32-like proteases) enhanced the survival of OLGs treated with TNF-α, indicating that ICE- and the CPP32-mediated cell death pathways are activated in TNF-induced OLG cell death. Our results suggest that the inhibition of ICE/CED-3 proteases may be a novel approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.</p>\n\n<p>The chordotonal (Ch) organ, an internal stretch receptor located in the subepidermal layer, is one of the major sensory organs in the peripheral nervous system of Drosophila melantogaster. Although the cell lineage of the Ch organ has been well characterized in many studies, the determination machinery of Ch organ precursor cells (COPs) remains largely unresolved. Here we report that the rhomboid (rho) gene and the activity of the Drosophila EGF receptor (DER) signaling pathway are necessary to induce specifically three of the eight COPs in an embryonic abdominal hemisegment. The cell-lineage analysis of COPs using the yeast flpase (flp/FRT) method indicated that each of the eight COPs originated from an individual undifferentiated ectodermal cell. The eight COPs in each abdominal hemisegment seemed to be determined by a two-phase induction: first, five COPs are determined by the action of the proneural gene atonal and neurogenic genes. Subsequently, these five COPs start to express the rho gene, and rho activates the DER-signaling pathway in neighboring cells and induces argos expression. Three of these argos-expressing cells differentiate into the three remaining COPs and they prevent neighboring cells from becoming extra COPs.</p>\n\n<p>mouse-Musashi-1 (m-Msi-1) is an RNA-binding protein, abundantly expressed in the developing mammalian central nervous system (CNS). m-Msi-1 contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). In this study, we found that the N-terminal RRM of m-Msi-1 (MMA) binds strongly to poly(G) and weakly to poly(U) in a way similar to that of the full-length m-Msi-1 protein characterized previously. The C-terminal RRM of m-Msi-1 (MMB), however, does not bind to RNA. In addition, the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the two RRMs showed that the α-helical content of MMA is significantly higher than that of MMB, indicating that some differences in the secondary structure may be responsible for the distinct RNA binding properties of MMA and MMB.</p>\n\n<p>Cell fate in the nervous system is determined by environmental signals and/or heredity. They can be referred to as extrinsic and intrinsic determinants, respectively. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these processes are well conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates. We have identified both types of determinants through the intensive screening of P-element-induced Drosophila mutants affected in neural development. As a member of the first category, argos gene product which regulates cell-cell interaction in the developing nervous system gives a good example. As a member of the second category, we refer to Drosophila musashi gene encoding a neural RNA-binding protein. The functions of these gene products and application to the mammalian nervous system will be discussed.</p>\n\n<p>There is an increasing interest in the role of RNA-binding proteins during neural development. Mouse-Musashi-1 (m-Msi-1) is a mouse neural RNA- binding protein with sequence similarity to Drosophila musashi (d-msi), which is essential for neural development. m-Msi-1 is highly enriched in neural precursor cells that are capable of generating both neurons and glia during embryonic CNS development. The present study characterized m-Msi-1-expressing cells in the postnatal and adult CNS. Postnatally, m-Msi-1 was expressed in proliferative neuronal precursors in the external granule cell layer of the cerebellum and in the anterior corner of the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. In gliogenesis, the persistent expression of m-Msi-1 was observed in cells of the astrocyte lineage ranging from proliferative glial precursors in the subventricular zone (SVZ), to differentiated astrocytes in the parenchyma. In addition, we showed that m-Mis-1 was still expressed in proliferating cells in the adult SVZ, which may contain neural precursor or stem cells. Another neural RNA-binding protein Hu (the mammalian homolog of Drosophila neuronal RNA-binding protein Elav) was present in postmitotic neurons throughout the development of the CNS, and its pattern of expression was compared with that of m-Msi-1. These observations imply that these two RNA-binding proteins may be involved in the development of neurons and glia by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.</p>\n\n<p>We have isolated a novel Drosophila paired-like homeobox gene, DPHD-1. The homeodomain of DPHD-1 showed 85% amino-acid identity with that of the C. elegans Unc-4 protein. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of embryos and third-instar larvae revealed that the DPHD-1 mRNA is specifically localized in subsets of postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and in the developing epidermis with a segmentally repeated pattern. Double staining with a posterior compartment marker, an anti-Engrailed antibody, showed that DPHD-1 expressing neurons in the CNS were present in the posterior compartment, whereas DPHD-1 expression in the epidermis was restricted to the anterior compartment in each segment. This temporal and spatial expression pattern suggests that DPHD-1 may play a role in determining the distinct cell types in each segment.</p>\n\n<p>The adult mammalian forebrain harbors neuronal precursor cells in the subependymal zone (SZ). Neuronal progenitors also persist in the adult human SZ and have been cultured from epileptic temporal lobe. In the present study, we sought to identify these neural progenitors in situ, and to direct their expansion and neuronal differentiation in vitro. We prepared explants of adult human SZ, obtained from temporal lobe resections of refractory epileptics. The resultant cultures were treated with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) for a week, with concurrent exposure to [3H]thymidine, then switched to media containing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) for up to 2 months. Sporadic neuronal outgrowth, verified antigenically and physiologically, was observed from SZ cultures regardless of FGF-2/BDNF treatment; however, only FGF-2/BDNF-treated cultures exhibited profuse outgrowth, and these displayed neuronal survival as long as 9 weeks in vitro. In addition, cortical cultures derived from two brains generated microtubule- associated protein-2+ neurons, which incorporated [3H]thymidine and exhibited significant calcium increments to depolarization. In histological sections of the subependyma, both uncommitted and restricted progenitors, defined respectively by musashi and Hu protein expression, were identified. Thus, the adult human subependyma harbors neural progenitors, which are able to give rise to neurons whose numbers can be supported for prolonged periods in vitro.</p>\n\n<p>We studied the role of Ras signaling in the regulation of cell death during Drosophila eye development. Overexpression of Argos, a diffusible inhibitor of the EGF receptor and Ras signaling, caused excessive cell death in developing eyes at pupal stages. The Argos-induced cell death was suppressed by coexpression of the anti-apoptotic genes p35, diap1, or diap2 in the eye as well as by the Df(3L)H99 chromosomal deletion that lacks three apoptosis-inducing genes, reaper, head involution defective (hid) and grim. Transient misexpression of the activated Ras1 protein (Ras1(V12)) later in pupal development suppressed the Argos-induced cell death. Thus, Argos-induced cell death seemed to have resulted from the suppression of the anti-apoptotic function of Ras. Conversely, cell death induced by overexpression of Hid was suppressed by gain-of-function mutations of the genes coding for MEK and ERK. These results support the idea that Ras signaling functions in two distinct processes during eye development, first triggering the recruitment of cells and later negatively regulating cell death.</p>\n\n<p>Serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A receptor) is widely distributed in the central nervous system, and has been suggested to be involved in a variety of behavioral conditions and neuropsychiatric disorders. Two polyclonal antibodies were raised against the N-terminus peptide of rat 5-HT2A receptor in chickens (5-HT2A-N) and a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that contained the C-terminus of the mouse 5-HT2A receptor in rabbits (5-HT2A-C). Affinity-purified 5-HT2A-N and -C antibodies reacted strongly with a single band of 77-78 kDa in postsynaptic density proteins prepared from the rat cortex. The distribution pattern of immunoreactive structures in the rat brain was virtually the same for the two antibodies. The highest levels of immunoreactivity were observed in the olfactory bulb, neocortex, claustrum, piriform cortex, mamillary bodies, pontine nuclei, red nucleus and cranial motor nuclei. In the olfactory bulb, mitral cells were intensely labeled. In the neocortex, many immunoreactive neurons were found in layers II-VI. In layer IV of the neocortex, strong neuropil labeling was observed. In a double-labeling study using chicken 5-HT2A-N and rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody, a considerable number of GFAP positive cells also showed 5-HT2A immunoreactivity. By using an immunoelectron microscopic technique, 5-HT2A receptor immunoreaction was shown to be localized just beneath the postsynaptic membrane thickening of asymmetric synapses.</p>\n\n<p>ced-9, a member of the bcl-2 gene family in Caenorhabditis elegans plays a central roles in preventing cell death in worms. Overexpression of human bcl-2 can partially prevent cell death in C. elegans. However, it remains to be elucidated whether ced-9 can regulate cell death when expressed in other organisms. We demonstrated that the CED-9 protein is co-localized with BCL-2 in COS cells and Drosophila Schneider's L2 (SL2) cells, suggesting that the site of CED-9 action is located to specific cytoplasmic compartments. Overexpression of ced-9 only poorly protected cells from the death induced by ced-3 in HeLa cells, but ced-9 significantly reduced the cell death induced by ced-3 in Drosophila SL2 cells. Furthermore, apoptosis of SL2 cells that was induced by a Drosophila cell-death gene, reaper, was shown to be partially prevented by ced-9, bcl-2 and bcl-xL. These results suggest that the signaling pathway that is required for the anti-apoptotic function of bcl-2 family members, including ced-9, is conserved in Drosophila cells. In addition, SL2 cells provide a unique systems for dissecting the main machinery of cell death.</p>\n\n<p>The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) protein-tyrosine kinase plays important roles in cell adhesion in vertebrates. Using polymerase chain reaction-based cloning strategy, we cloned a Drosophila gene that is homologous to the vertebrate FAK family of protein-tyrosine kinases. We designated this gene Dfak56 and characterized its gene product. The overall protein structure and deduced amino acid sequence of Dfak56 show significant similarity to those of FAK and PYK2. Dfak56 has in vitro autophosphorylation activity at tyrosine residues. Expression of the Dfak56 mRNA and the protein was observed in the central nervous system and the muscle-epidermis attachment site in the embryo, where Drosophila position-specific integrins are localized. The results suggest that like FAK in vertebrates, Dfak56 functions downstream of integrins. Dfak56 was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon integrin-dependent attachment of the cell to the extracellular matrix. We conclude that the Dfak56 tyrosine kinase is involved in integrin-mediated cell adhesion signaling and thus is a functional homolog of vertebrate FAK.</p>\n\n<p>We have examined the roles played by the Drosophila neural RNA-binding protein Musashi (MSI) in eye development. MSI expression was observed in the nuclei of all photoreceptor cells (R1-R8). Although a msi loss-of-function mutation resulted in only weak abnormalities in photoreceptor differentiation, we found that the msi eye phenotype was significantly enhanced in a seven in absentia (sina) background. sina is known to be involved in the degradation of the Tramtrack (TTK) protein, leading to the specification of the R7 fate. We demonstrated that MSI also functions to regulate TTK expression. The sina msi mutants showed significantly high ectopic expression of TTK69 and failure in the determination of the R1, R6, and R7 fates. Other photoreceptor cells also failed to differentiate with abnormalities occurring late in the differentiation process. These results suggest that MSI and SINA function redundantly to downregulate TTK in developing photoreceptor cells.

Although Drosophila ELAV is required for the correct differentiation and survival of neurons, the roles played by the Hu genes in the mammalian nervous system remain largely unknown. To explore the in vivo functions of mouse Hu proteins, we overexpressed them in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, where they induced neuronal phenotype in the absence of nerve growth factor. We have characterized the functions of various forms of mHuB and mHuC bearing point mutations or deletions. Mutants of mHuC that had amino acid exchanges in the RNP1 domain of the first or second RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) lost biologic activity as well as RNA-binding activity. In addition, the mutants containing only the third RRM failed to induce the neuronal phenotype in PC12 cells and inhibited the biologic activity of cotransfected wild-type mHuB and mHuC, thus acting as a dominant-negative form. However, these mutants could not suppress the nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. Further, we misexpressed wild-type and dominant-negative Hu in E9.5 mouse embryos, by using electroporation into the neural tube at the level of the rhombencephalon, mHuB and mHuC induced the ectopic expression of neuronal markers, whereas the dominant-negative forms of mHuB and mHuC suppressed the differentiation of central nervous system motor neurons. From these results, we suggest that Hu proteins are required for neuronal differentiation in the mammalian nervous system.</p>\n\n<p>The Ral GTPase is activated by RalGDS, which is one of the effector proteins for Ras. Previous studies have suggested that Ral might function to regulate the cytoskeleton; however, its in vivo function is unknown. We have identified a Drosophila homologue of Ral that is widely expressed during embryogenesis and imaginal disc development. Two mutant Drosophila Ral (DRal) proteins, DRal(G20V) and DRal(S25N), were generated and analyzed for nucleotide binding and GTPase activity. The biochemical analyses demonstrated that DRal(G20V) and DRal(S25N) act as constitutively active and dominant negative mutants, respectively. Overexpression of the wild-type DRal did not cause any visible phenotype, whereas DRal(G20V) and DRal(S25N) mutants caused defects in the development of various tissues including the cuticular surface, which is covered by parallel arrays of polarized structures such as hairs and sensory bristles. The dominant negative DRal protein caused defects in the development of hairs and bristles. These phenotypes were genetically suppressed by loss of function mutations of hemipterous and basket, encoding Drosophila Jun NH2-terminal kinase kinase (JNKK) and Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), respectively. Expression of the constitutively active DRal protein caused defects in the process of dorsal closure during embryogenesis and inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK in cultured S2 cells. These results indicate that DRal regulates developmental cell shape changes through the JNK pathway.</p>\n\n<p>Musashi1 is an RNA-binding protein abundantly expressed in the developing mouse central nervous system. Its restricted expression in neural precursor cells suggests that it is involved in the regulation of asymmetric cell division. Musashi1 contains two ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-type RNA-binding domains (RBDs), RBD1 and RBD2. Our previous studies showed that RBD1 alone binds to RNA, while the binding of RBD2 is not detected under the same conditions. Joining of RBD2 to RBD1, however, increases the affinity to greater than that of RBD1 alone, indicating that RBD2 contributes to RNA-binding. We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the C-terminal RBD (RBD2) of Musashi1 by NMR. It folds into a compact up structure comprising a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet packed against two α-helices, which is characteristic of RNP-type RBDs. Special structural features of RBD2 include a β-bulge in β2 and a shallow twist of the β-sheet. The smaller 1H-15N nuclear Overhauser enhancement values for the residues of loop 3 between β2 and β3 suggest that this loop is flexible in the time-scale of nano- to picosecond order. The smaller 15N T2 values for the residues around the border between α2 and the following loop (loop 5) suggest this region undergoes conformational exchange in the milli- to microsecond time-scale. Chemical shift perturbation analysis indicated that RBD2 binds to an RNA oligomer obtained by in vitro selection under the conditions for NMR measurements, and thus the nature of the weak RNA-binding of RBD2 was successfully characterized by NMR, which is otherwise difficult to assess. Mainly the residues of the surface composed of the four-stranded β-sheet, loops and C-terminal region are involved in the interaction. The appearance of side-chain NH proton resonances of arginine residues of loop 3 and imino proton resonances of RNA bases upon complex formation suggests the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The structural arrangement of the rings of the conserved aromatic residues of β2 and β3 is suitable for stacking interaction with RNA bases, known to be one of the major protein-RNA interactions, but a survey of the perturbation data suggested that the stacking interaction is not ideally achieved in the complex, which may be related to the weaker RNA-binding of RBD2.</p>\n\n<p>The small GTP-binding protein Ral is activated by RalGDS, one of the effector molecules for Ras. Active Ral binds to a GTPase activating protein for CDC42 and Rac. Although previous studies suggest a role for Ral in the regulation of CDC42 and Rac, which are involved in arranging the cytoskeleton, its in in vivo function is largely unknown. To examine the effect of overexpressing Ral on development, transgenic Drosophila were generated that overexpress wild-type or mutated Ral during eye development. While wild-type Ral caused no developmental defects, expression of a constitutively activated protein resulted in a rough eye phenotype. Activated Rat did not affect cell fate determination in the larval eye discs but caused severe disruption of the ommatidial organization later in pupal development. Phalloidin staining showed that activated Ral perturbed the cytoskeletal structure and cell shape changes during pupal development. This phenotype is similar to that caused by RhoA overexpression. In addition, the phenotype was synergistically enhanced by the coexpression of RhoA. These results suggest that Ral functions to control the cytoskeletal structure required for cell shape changes during Drosophila development.</p>\n\n<p>Myelin is synthesized about the time of birth. The Src-family tyrosine kinase Fyn is involved in the initial events of myelination. Fyn is present in myelin-forming cells and is activated through stimulation of celt surface receptors such as large myelin-associated glycoprotein (L-MAG). Here we show that Fyn stimulates transcription of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene for myelination. MBP is a major component of the myelin membrane. In 4-week-old Fyn-deficient mice, MBP is significantly reduced, and electron microscopic analysis showed that myelination is delayed, compared with wild-type mice. The Fyn-deficient mice had thinner, more irregular myelin than the wild- type. We found that Fyn stimulates the promoter activity of the MBP gene by approximately sevenfold. The region responsible for the transactivation by Fyn is located between nucleotides -675 and -647 with respect to the transcription start site. Proteins binding to this region were found by gel shift study, and the binding activity correlates with Fyn activity during myelination. These results suggest that transactivation of the MBP gene by Fyn is important for myelination.</p>\n\n<p>CED-4 protein plays an important role in the induction of programmed cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans through the activation of caspases. However, the precise mechanisms by which it activates caspases remain unknown. To investigate the conservation of CED-4 function in evolution, transgenic Drosophila lines that express CED-4 in the compound eye were generated. Ectopic expression of CED-4 in the eyes induced massive apoptotic cell death through caspase activation. An ATP-binding site (P-loop) mutation in CED-4 (K165R) causes a loss of function in its ability to activate Drosophila caspase, and an ATPase inhibitor blocks the CED-4-dependent caspase activity in Drosophila S2 cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that both CED-4 and CED-4 (K165R) bind directly to Drosophila caspase drICE, and the overexpression of CED-4 (K165R) inhibits CED-4-, ecdysone-, or cycloheximide-dependent caspase activation in S2 cells. Furthermore, CED-4 (K165R) partially prevented cell death induced by CED-4 in Drosophila compound eyes. Thus, CED-4 function is evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila, and the molecular mechanisms by which CED-4 activates caspases might require ATP binding and direct interaction with the caspases.</p>\n\n<p>During C. elegans development, Wnt/WG signaling is required for differences in cell fate between sister cells born from anterior/posterior divisions. A β-catenin-related gene, wrm-1, and the lit-1 gene are effectors of this signaling pathway and appear to downregulate the activity of POP-1, a TCF/LEF-related protein, in posterior daughter cells. We show here that lit- 1 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase homolog related to the Drosophila tissue polarity protein Nemo. We demonstrate that the WRM-1 protein binds to LIT-1 in vivo and that WRM-1 can activate the LIT-1 protein kinase when coexpressed in vertebrate tissue culture cells. This activation leads to phosphorylation of POP-1 and to apparent changes in its subcellular localization. Our findings provide evidence for novel regulatory avenues for an evolutionarily conserved Wnt/WG signaling pathway.</p>\n\n<p>Oligodendrocytes are myelin-forming cells in the mammalian central nervous system. About 50% of oligodendrocytes undergo cell death in normal development. In addition, massive oligodendrocyte cell death has been observed in multiple sclerosis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is thought to be one of the mediators responsible for the damage of oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis. The addition of TNF-α to primary cultures of oligodendrocytes significantly decreased the number of live cells in 72 h. DNA fragmentation was detected in TNF-treated oligodendrocytes at 36h by TUNEL assay. Chemical inhibitors Ac-YVAD-CHO (a specific inhibitor of caspase-1[ICE]-like proteases) as well as Ac-DEVD-CHO (a specific inhibitor of caspase-3[CPP32]-like proteases) enhanced the survival of oligodendrocytes treated with TNF-α, indicating that caspase-1- and the caspase-3-mediated cell-death pathways are activated in TNF-induced oligodendrocyte cell death. Caspase-11 is involved in activation of caspase-1. Oligodendrocytes from CASP-11-deficient mice are partially resistant to TNF-induced oligodendrocyte cell death. Our results suggest that the inhibition of caspases may be a novel approach to treat multiple sclerosis.</p>\n\n<p>Argos is a secreted protein that contains an EGF-like domain and acts as an inhibitor of Drosophila EGF receptor activation. To identify genes that function in the Argos-regulated signaling pathway, we performed a genetic screen for enhancers and suppressors of the eye phenotype caused by the overexpression of argos. As a result, new alleles of known genes encoding components of the EGF receptor pathway, such as Star, sprouty, bulge, and clown, were isolated. To study the role of clown in development, we examined the eye and wing phenotypes of the clown mutants in detail. In the eye discs of clown mutants, the pattern of neuronal differentiation was impaired, showing a phenotype similar to those caused by a gain-of-function EGF receptor mutation and overexpression of secreted Spitz, an activating ligand for the EGF receptor. There was also an increased number of pigment cells in the clown eyes. Epistatic analysis placed clown between argos and Ras1. In addition, we found that clown negatively regulated the development of wing veins. These results suggest that the clown gene product is important for the Argos-mediated inhibition of EGF receptor activation during the development of various tissues. In addition to the known genes, we identified six mutations of novel genes. Genetic characterization of these mutants suggested that they have distinct roles in cell differentiation and/or survival regulated by the EGF receptor pathway.</p>\n\n<p>Drosophila Argos (Aos), a secreted protein with an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, has been shown to inhibit the activation of the Drosophila EGF receptor (DER). However, it has not been determined whether Aos binds directly to DER or whether regulation of the DER activation occurs through some other mechanism. Using DER-expressing cells (DER/S2) and a recombinant DER extracellular domain-Fc fusion protein (DER-Fc), we have shown that Aos binds directly to the extracellular domain of DER with its carboxyl-terminal region, including the EGF-like domain. Furthermore, Aos can block the binding of secreted Spitz (sSpi), a transforming growth factor α- like ligand of DER, to the extracellular domain of DER. We observed that sSpi stimulates the dimerization of both the soluble DER extracellular domain (sDER) and the intact DER in the DER/S2 cells and that Aos can block the sSpi-induced dimerization of both sDER and intact DER. Moreover, we have shown that, by directly interacting with DER, Aos and SpiAos (a chimeric protein that is composed of the N-terminal region of Spi and the C-terminal region of Aos) inhibit the dimerization and phosphorylation of DER that are induced by DER's overexpression in the absence of sSpi. These results indicate that Aos exerts its inhibitory function through dual molecular mechanisms: by blocking both the receptor dimerization and the binding of activating ligand to the receptor. This is the first description of this novel inhibitory mechanism for receptor tyrosine kinases.</p>\n\n<p>Neurogenesis persists in the adult mammalian hippocampus. To identify and isolate neuronal progenitor cells of the adult human hippocampus, we transfected ventricular zone-free dissociates of surgically-excised dentate gyrus with DNA encoding humanized green fluorescent protein (hGFP), placed under the control of either the nestin enhancer (E/nestin) or the Tα1 tubulin promoter (P/Tα1), two regulatory regions that direct transcription in neural progenitor cells. The resultant P/Tα1:hGFP+, and E/nestin:enhanced (E)GFP+ cells expressed βIII-tubulin or microtubule- associated protein-2; many incorporated bromodeoxyuridine, indicating their genesis in vitro. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, the E/nestin:EGFP+ and P/Tα1:hGFP+ cells were isolated to near purity, and matured antigenically and physiologically as neurons. Thus, the adult human hippocampus contains mitotically competent neuronal progenitors that can be selectively extracted. The isolation of these cells may provide a cellular substrate for re-populating the damaged or degenerated adult hippocampus.</p>\n\n<p>The mechanisms underlying oligodendrocyte (OLG) loss and the precise roles played by OLG death in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), and in the rodent model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), remain to be elucidated. To clarify the involvement of OLG death in EAE, we have generated transgenic mice that express the baculovirus anti-apoptotic protein p35 in OLGs through the Cre-loxP system. OLGs from cre/p35 transgenic mice were resistant to tumor necrosis factor-α-, anti-Fas antibody- and interferon-γ-induced cell death. cre/p35 transgenic mice were resistant to EAE induction by immunization with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. The numbers of infiltrating T cells and macrophages/microglia in the EAE lesions were significantly reduced, as were the numbers of apoptotic OLGs expressing the activated form of caspase-3. Thus, inhibition of apoptosis in OLGs by p35 expression alleviated the severity of the neurological manifestations observed in autoimmune demyelinating diseases.</p>\n\n<p>Adult humans, like their nonhuman mammalian counterparts, harbor persistent neural progenitor cells in the forebrain ventricular lining. In the absence of adequate surface markers, however, these cells have proven difficult to isolate for study. We have previously identified and selected neural progenitor cells from both the fetal and adult rodent ventricular zone (VZ), by sorting forebrain cells transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the gene for green fluorescent protein driven by the early neuronal promoter for Tα1 tubulin (P/Tα1:hGFP). We have now extended this approach by purifying both P/Tα1:hGFP tubulin-defined neuronal progenitors, as well as potentially less committed E/nestin:hGFP-defined neural progenitor cells, from the adult human VZ. The ventricular wall of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle was dissected from temporal lobes obtained from four adult patients undergoing therapeutic lobectomy. These samples were dissociated, and the cultured cells transduced with either P/Tα1:hGFP or E/nestin:EGFP plasmid DNA. A week later, the cells were redissociated, selected via fluorescence- activated cell sorting (FACS) on the basis of neural promoter-driven GFP expression, and replated. The majority of these cells expressed the early neuronal protein βIII-tubulin upon FACS; within the week thereafter, most matured as morphologically evident neurons that coexpressed βIII-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2. Many of these neurons had incorporated bromodeoxyuridine in vitro in the days before FACS, indicating their mitogenesis in vitro. Thus, the use of fluorescent transgenes under the control of early neural promoters permits the enrichment of neuronal progenitor cells from the adult human ventricular zone. The specific acquisition, in both purity and number, of residual neural progenitor cells from the adult human brain may now permit hitherto unfeasible studies of both their biology and practical application.

We report here the identification and characterization of Drob-1, the first Drosophila member of the Bcl-2/CED-9 family to be isolated. Drob-1 contains four conserved Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain. Ectopic expression of Drob-1 in the developing Drosophila eye resulted in a rough-eye phenotype. Furthermore, when overexpressed in Drosophila S2 cells, Drob-1 induced apoptosis accompanied by elevated caspase activity. This Drob-1-induced cell death, however, could not be antagonized by baculovirus p35, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. Drob-1 was localized to the intracytoplasmic membranes, predominantly to the mitochondrial membranes, and a mutant Drob-1 lacking the hydrophobic C terminus lost both its mitochondrial localization and its proapoptotic activity. These results suggest that Drob-1 promotes cell death by inducing both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways at the mitochondria. Our identification of Drob-1 and further genetic analysis should provide increased understanding of the universal mechanisms by which the Bcl-2/CED-9 family members and other related proteins regulate apoptosis.</p>\n\n<p>Visualization of specific transsynaptic neural pathways is an indispensable technique for understanding the relationship between structure and function in the nervous system. Here, we demonstrate the application of the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) transgene technique for tracing transsynaptic neural pathways in Drosophila. The intracellular localization of WGA was examined by immunoelectron microscopy. WGA signals were detected in granule- like structures in both the outer photoreceptor cells expressing WGA and the second-order laminar neurons. Misexpression of tetanus toxin (TNT), which inactivates N-synaptobrevin, in the outer photoreceptor cells resulted in the elimination of on/off transients in electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and in a great reduction in WGA transfer into laminar neurons, suggesting that anterograde WGA transsynaptic transfer is dependent mainly on synaptic transmission. Retrograde WGA transfer was also detected upon its forced expression in muscle cells. WGA primarily expressed in muscle cells was taken up by motoneuron axons and transported to their cell bodies in the ventral nerve cord, suggesting that WGA can trace motoneuronal pathways in combination with the muscle-specific GAL4 driver. Thus, the GAL4/UAS-WGA system should facilitate the dissection of the Drosophila neural circuit formation and/or synaptic activity in various regions and at various developmental stages.</p>\n\n<p>Hes1 is one of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that regulate mammalian CNS development, and its loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes indicate that it negatively regulates neuronal differentiation. Here we report that Has1(-/-) mice expressed both early (TuJ1 and Hu) and late (MAP2 and Neurofilament) neuronal markers prematurely, and that there were approximately twice the normal number of neurons in the Hes1 (-/-) brain during early neural development. However, immunochemical analyses of sections and dissociated cells using neural progenitor markers, including nestin, failed to detect any changes in Hes1 (-/-) progenitor population. Therefore, further characterization of neural progenitor cells that discriminated between multipotent and monopotent cells was performed using two culture methods, low-density culture, and a neurosphere assay. We demonstrate that the self-renewal activity of multipotent progenitor cells was reduced in the Hes1 (-/-) brain, and that their subsequent commitment to the neuronal lineage was accelerated. The Hes1 (-/-) neuronal progenitor cells were functionally abnormal, in that they divided, on average, only once, and then generated two neurons, (instead of one progenitor cell and one neuron), whereas wild-type progenitor cells divided more. In addition, some Hes1(-/-) progenitors followed an apoptotic fate. The overproduction of neurons in the early Hes1(-/-) brains may reflect this premature and immediate generation of neurons as well as a net increase in the number of neuronal progenitor cells. Taken together, we conclude that Hes1 is important for maintaining the self- renewing ability of progenitors and for repressing the commitment of multipotent progenitor cells to a neuronal fate, which is critical for the correct number of neurons to be produced and for the establishment of normal neuronal function.</p>\n\n<p>Oligodendrocytes are myelin forming cells in mammalian central nervous system. About 50% of oligodendrocytes (OLGs) undergo cell death in normal development. In addition, OLG cell deaths have been observed in demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). Clinical observations and in vitro cell culture studies have suggested that cytokines mediate OLG cell damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). Among the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is thought to be one of the mediators responsible for the damage of OLGs in MS. The administration of TNF-α to primary cultures of OLGs induced DNA fragmentation, and significantly decreased the number of live OLGs. Chemical inhibitors Ac-YVAD-CHO (a specific inhibitor of caspase-1 (ICE)-like proteases) enhanced the survival of TNF-α treated OLGs better than Ac-DEVD-CHO (a specific inhibitor of caspase-3 (CPP32)-like proteases). These results indicate that caspase-1-mediated cell-death pathway are activated in TNF-induced OLG cell death. Caspase-11 is involved in activation of caspase-1. Oligodendrocytes from caspase-11-deficient mice are partially resistant to TNF-induced OLG cell death. Our results suggest that the inhibition of caspase-1 sufamily may be a novel therapeutic approach to treat MS.</p>\n\n<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotential progenitor cells that have self-renewal activities. A single NSC is capable of generating various kinds of cells within the CNS, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Because of these characteristics, there is an increasing interest in NSCs and neural progenitor cells from the aspects of both basic developmental biology and therapeutic applications for damaged brain. By understanding the nature of NSCs present in the CNS, extracellular factors and signal transduction cascades involved in the differentiation and maintenance of NSCs, population dynamics and localization of NSCs in embryonic and adult brains, prospective identification and isolation of NSCs, and induction of NSCs into particular neuronal phenotypes, it would be possible to develop a feasible strategy to manipulate cells in situ to treat damaged brain.</p>\n\n<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing and multipotential neural progenitor cells, which have received strong attention as potential tools to treat the injured or diseased brain. To develop therapeutic strategies intended to capitalize upon the plasticity and propagability of NSCs, we need both to better understand their biology, and to develop better means for their prospective identification and harvest. We summerize here recent findings from our laboratories. Specifically, we describe the prospective identification of NSCs, using fluorescent reporters placed under the control of the nestin enhancer. Together, these findings provide us both new conceptual and operational strategies for studying NSCs, and as such should greatly accelerate their development for the treatment of neurologic disease.</p>\n\n<p>Background: Neural RNA-binding proteins are thought to play important roles in neural development and the functional regulation of postmitotic neurones by mediating post-transcriptional gene regulation. RNA-binding proteins belonging to the Musashi family are highly expressed in the nervous system; however, their roles are poorly understood. Results: We identified a Caenorhabditis elegans Musashi homologue, MSI-1, whose RNA-recognition motifs show extensive similarity to those of Drosophila and vertebrate Musashi proteins. We isolated a msi-1 mutant and found males with this mutation to have a mating defect. C. elegans male mating behaviour includes a distinct series of steps: response to contact, backing, turning, vulva location, spicule insertion, and sperm transfer. msi-1 is required for the turning and vulva location steps. Like other Musashi family members, MSI-1 is expressed specifically in neural cells, including male-specific neurones required for turning and vulva location. However, msi-1 was not expressed in proliferating neural progenitors in C. elegans, unlike the Musashi family genes in other systems. Conclusions: Our results suggest that msi-1 is expressed specifically in postmitotic neurones in C. elegans. msi-1 is required for full development of male mating behaviour, possibly through regulation of msi-1 expressing neurones.</p>\n\n<p>Asymmetric cell division is a fundamental process that produces cellular diversity during development. We have identified two mutants in C. elegans (psa-1 and psa-4) in which the asymmetry of T cell division is disrupted. psa-1 and psa-4 encode homologs of yeast SW13 and SW12/SNF2, respectively, which are components of the SWI/SNF complex. We show by RNA interference assay that homologs of other components of SWI/SNF are also involved in T cell division. psa-1 and psa-4 are likely to be required in the T cell during mitosis to cause asymmetric cell division. Because the SWI/SNF complex is required for asymmetric division in S. cerevisiae, these results demonstrate that at least some aspects of the mechanism of asymmetric cell division are conserved between yeast and a multicellular organism.</p>\n\n<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotential progenitor cells that have self-renewal activities.

The Drosophila deltex gene encodes a modulator of the Notch pathway that has been shown to interact physically with the Ankyrin repeats of Notch. We isolated four distinct cDNAs corresponding to mouse homologs of deltex - mouse Deltex1 (MDTX1), mouse Deltex2 (MDTX2), mouse Deltex2ΔE (MDTX2ΔE), and mouse Deltex3 (MDTX3). Deduced amino acid sequences of these four cDNAs showed a high degree of similarity to Drosophila Deltex and its human homolog, DTX1 throughout their lengths, even though they possess distinct structural features. MDTX proteins formed homotypic and heterotypic multimers. We found that these genes were expressed in the central, peripheral nervous system and in the thymus, overlapping with those of mouse Notch1. In mammalian tissue culture cells, overexpression of any of the four mouse deltex homologs suppressed the transcriptional activity of E47, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, in a manner similar to suppression by an activated form of human Notch1 or human DTX1. In addition, overexpression of MDTX2 and MDTX2ΔE in C2C12 cells under differentiation-inducing conditions suppressed the expression of myogenin, one of the myogenic transcriptional factors; this was also similar to a previously reported activity of constitutively activated Notch. Furthermore, misexpression of any of the MDTX genes in Xenopus embryos resulted in an expansion of the region expressing the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) gene, a marker for the neuroepithelium. Collectively, our results suggest that these mouse deltex homologs are involved in vertebrate Notch signaling and regulation of neurogenesis.

Flow cytometry followed by in vitro assays revealed that in situ EGFP expression in the embryonic brain correlated with the mitotic index, the cogeneration of both neurons and gila, and the frequency of neurosphere formation in vitro. High-level EGFP expressors derived from embryos included a distinct subpopulation of cells that were self-renewable and multipotent, criteria that define neural stern cells (NSCs). Such cells were largely absent among lower-level or non-EGFP expressors, thereby permitting us to enrich for NSCs using EGFP expression level. In adults, although E/nestin:EGFP-positive cells included the NSC population, the frequency of neurosphere formation did not correlate directly with the level of EGFP expression. However, moderately EGFP-expressing cells in adults gained EGFP intensity when they formed neurospheres, suggesting embryonic and adult NSCs exist in different microenvironments in vivo.</p>\n\n<p>Self-renewing and multipotent neural stem cells are present in the adult human brain. We successfully harvested neural stem cells from mice and humans using misexpressed EGFP proteins under the control of the nestin second intron enhancer. High-level EGFP expressors derived from mouse embryos included a distinct subpopulation of cells that were self-renewable and multipotent. Further, we obtained that neural progenitor cells from rat fetal spinal cords using a neurosphere technique, and demonstrated their ability to divide and differentiate into neurons in vivo, where they were integrated into the host tissue in the injured rat spinal cord with resultant behavioral improvement of the recipient rat. We also harvested tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons from a transgenic mouse expressing GFP under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter, and successfully transplanted them into the striatum of rats with parkinsonism with marked improvement of the neurological symptoms. Since neural stem cells can adapt well in the host CNS, studies should focus on their application as a vector in gene therapy and on the introduction in vivo or ex vivo of genes to control their proliferation and differentiation. Neural stem cells are a potential, useful source for developing new therapy for CNS disorders.</p>\n\n<p>Although chromosomal segregation at meiosis I is the critical process for genetic reassortment and inheritance, little is known about molecules involved in this process in metazoa. Here we show by utilizing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated genetic interference that novel protein kinases (Ce-CDS-1 and Ce-CDS-2) related to Cds1 (Chk2) play an essential role in meiotic recombination in Caenorhabditis elegans. Injection of dsRNA into adult animals resulted in the inhibition of meiotic crossing over and induced the loss of chiasmata at diakenesis in oocytes of F1 animals. However, electron microscopic analysis revealed that synaptonemal complex formation in pachytene nuclei of the same progeny of injected animals appeared to be normal. Thus, Ce-CDS-1 and Ce-CDS-2 are the first example of Cds1-related kinases that are required for meiotic recombination in multicellular organisms.</p>\n\n<p>Homologues of the Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins are evolutionarily conserved across species. In mammals, two members of this family, Musashil (Msil) and Musashi2 (Msi2), are strongly coexpressed in neural precursor cells, including CNS stem cells. To address the in vivo roles of msi in neural development, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the gene encoding Msil. Homozygous newborn mice frequently developed obstructive hydrocephalus with aberrant proliferation of ependymal cells in a restricted area surrounding the Sylvius aqueduct. These observations indicate a vital role for msil in the normal development of this subpopulation of ependymal cells, which has been speculated to be a source of postnatal CNS stem cells. On the other hand, histological examination and an in vitro neurosphere assay showed that neither the embryonic CNS development nor the self-renewal activity of CNS stem cells in embryonic forebrains appeared to be affected by the disruption of msil, but the diversity of the cell types produced by the stem cells was moderately reduced by the msil deficiency. Therefore, we performed antisense ablation experiments to target both msi1 and msi2 in embryonic neural precursor cells. Administration of the antisense peptidenucleotides, which were designed to specifically down-regulate msi2 expression, to msi1-/- CNS stem cell cultures drastically suppressed the formation of neurospheres in a dose-dependent manner. Antisense-treated msi1-/- CNS stem cells showed a reduced proliferative activity. These data suggest that msi1 and msi2 are cooperatively involved in the proliferation and maintenance of CNS stem cell populations.</p>\n\n<p>It had been long believed that our adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) does not regenerate after damage due to injuries or degenerative diseases, as Santiago Ramóny Cajal had indicated long time ago. Today, however, CNS came to be recognized as an important target of so called \"regenerative medicine\". We have been proposing that regeneration of CNS does include the following three concepts: i) re-growth of the damaged neuronal axons, ii) replenishment of lost neural (or neuronal) cells and iii) recovery of lost neural functions. Here, we would like to emphasize that to recapitulate normal neural development is an essential strategy for CNS-regeneration. In this review, we would like to take Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury as examples to discuss actual strategy aiming for CNS-regeneration.</p>\n\n<p>This chapter describes a mechanism that underlies the degradation of newly formed fibrous bands in CCl&lt;inf&gt;4&lt;/inf&gt;-induced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis and demonstrates that neural progenitor cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells express interstitial collagenase in the recovery phase of experimental cirrhosis. It also discusses the availability of hematopoietic stem cells for the treatment of human liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. The reversibility of liver fibrosis in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and alcoholic fatty liver with fibrosis has been observed after alcohol abstinence. Histologically documented reversibility of liver fibrosis in alcoholic liver diseases was closely correlated with a decrease in serum fibrosis markers of type IV collagen. It is now generally accepted that reversibility of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis occurs under some conditions if the cause of liver damage is removed or adequately treated.</p>\n\n<p>Neural stem cells(NSCs) are multipotential progenitor cells that can generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, the three major cell types in the central nervous system. Due to their self-renewal activities, NSCs can proliferate in an undifferentiated state in vitro, allowing them to be expanded mitotically and harvested in bulk. Recent advances in stem cell biology have led us to investigate methods for the regenerative manipulation of the damaged CNS. However, there is much that is still not known about regulatory mechanisms of the differentiation and self-renewal of NSCs. In this article, we review some of the basic notions regarding the extracellular factors and signal transduction cascades involved in the differentiation and maintenance of NSCs.</p>\n\n<p>One of the final goals of our research is the regaining of normal functions previously lost in damaged tissue. While it has long been believed regeneration of the central nervous system was absolutely impossible, scientists have recently made progress towards this goal. For the regeneration of damaged tissues, both morphological and functional reconstitutions are an indispensable process. As undifferentiated cells, have better survival rates in all types of environments as well as better competency with regard to extracellular signaling factors, we have tried to take advantage of these characteristics. We are trying to find methodologies that will let these cells recapitulate the developmental processes in order to regain the normal physiological functions of damaged tissues. Some of the candidate cells that can be utilized for retinal regeneration are retinal stem cells and embryonic stem cells. In this study, we describe a method for inducing these cells towards specific cell fates as well as their potential therapeutic application. We also describe the significance of investigating the effects of the microenvironment in damaged retina for the purpose of inducing neural retinal regeneration.</p>\n\n<p>Progenitor cells that generate neuron pairs (\"pair progenitor cells\") are implicated in mammalian cortical development, and their division has been thought to be \"symmetric.\" However, asymmetric growth of two sister neurons generated by the division of a pair progenitor cell would lead to more efficient generation of neuronal diversity in the cortex. To explore mechanisms by which pair progenitor cells provide neuronal diversity, we examined molecular differences between a pair of neurons generated in clonal-density culture. Time-course analysis for the acquisition of neuronal markers and the disappearance of Pax6 and Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) demonstrated that 1) these transcription factors are expressed transiently in some but not all young neurons and 2) some neuron pairs showed uneven/asymmetric expression of Pax6 (19.5%) or Ngn2 (23.8%), whereas other pairs were either symmetrically positive or negative. Asymmetric Pax6 distribution in neuron pairs was not associated with asymmetric distribution of Numb, which raises an intriguing possibility, that Pax6 asymmetry in neuron pairs is produced by an alternative mode of the cell autonomous mechanisms. Stage-dependent changes were noted in the pattern of Ngn2 retention in daughter neurons, reflecting qualitative changes in the pair progenitor population. We suggest that pair progenitor cells contribute to the generation of neuronal diversity through cell-intrinsic heterogeneity and asymmetric division. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>\n\n<p>Bone marrow (BM) cells are reported to contribute to the process of regeneration following myocardial infarction. However, the responsible BM cells have not been fully identified. Here, we used 2 independent clonal studies to determine the origin of bone marrow (BM)-derived cardiomyocytes. First, we transplanted single CD34- c-kit+Sca-1+ lineage- side population (CD34-KSL-SP) cells or whole BM cells from mice ubiquitously expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into lethally irradiated mice, induced myocardial infarction (MI), and treated the animals with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize stem cells to the damaged myocardium. At 8 weeks after MI, from 100 specimens we counted only 3 EGFP+ actinin+ cells in myocardium of CD34- KSL-SP cells in mice that received transplants, but more than 5000 EGFP+ actinin+ cells in whole BM cell in mice that received transplants, suggesting that most of EGFP+ actinin+ cells were derived from nonhematopoietic BM cells. Next, clonally purified nonhematopoietic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), cardiomyogenic (CMG) cells, that expressed EGFP in the cardiomyocyte-specific manner were transplanted directly into BM of lethally irradiated mice, MI was induced, and they were treated with G-CSF. EGFP+ actinin+ cells were observed in the ischemic myocardium, indicating that CMG cells had been mobilized and differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Together, these results suggest that the origin of the vast majority of BM-derived cardiomyocytes is MSCs. © 2004 by The American Society of Hematology.</p>\n\n<p>Retinoic acid (RA) is one of the most important morphogens, and its embryonic distribution correlates with neural differentiation and positional specification in the developing central nervous system. To investigate the concentration-dependent effects of RA on neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells), we investigated the precise expression profiles of neural and regional specific genes by ES cells aggregated into embryoid bodies (EBs) exposed to various concentrations of RA or the BMP antagonist Noggin. RA promoted both neural differentiation and caudalization in a concentration-dependent manner, and the concentration of RA was found to regulate dorso-ventral identity, i.e., higher concentrations of RA induced a dorsal phenotype, and lower concentrations of RA induced a more ventral phenotype. The induction of the more ventral phenotype was due to the higher expression level of the N-terminus of sonic hedgehog protein (Shh-N) when treated with low concentration RA, as it was abrogated by an inhibitor of Shh signaling, cyclopamine. These findings suggest that the concentration of RA strictly and simultaneously regulates the neuralization and positional specification during "
