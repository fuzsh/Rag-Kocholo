Robert O’Brien gives a higher figure: 458 Nisei students. In any case, the University of Washington had the second-highest Japanese American enrollment in the nation, coming in second to the University of California, Berkeley, with 485 students. Robert W.

Mrs. Sekor, leader of the Gatewood mothers is quoted: “I think that’s very white of those girls.” Sally Kazama, a secretary at Whittier School in 1942, later contended that the pressure to resign was applied by James Sakamoto, head of the Seattle chapter of the Japanese American Citizen League (JACL): “Well, we are at war and to show we are good citizens we must resign. This is being good citizens by resigning, in effect. This is what he said. Some of us were under protest. We were almost coerced into signing. Either that or be fired.” Sally Kazama, interview by Louis Fiset, August 16, 1995. The Seattle Public Schools made a public apology and compensated the fired clerks in 1986.\n\n9. Calvin Schmid, a UW professor, worked with the military to map out the restricted areas and managed to keep Eastern Oregon and Eastern Washington outside of the restricted zone. As Robert O’Brien explained:\n\nOne of the things that probably doesn’t get recorded is that sometimes people who work in quiet ways can be very effective in making democracy function, and one of these was Calvin Schmid who was asked by the military to draw the maps and the plans for the evacuation of Japanese and Japanese Americans. Calvin was looking at a map of California, and he drew the line straight north so that the eastern parts of Oregon and Washington would be still available for Japanese and Japanese Americans, and these people did not have to be evacuated. I doubt if many people know this about Professor Schmid because he’s a quiet person about this sort of commitment, but he had this commitment. The result was, of course, that we could relocate students in Pullman and Whitman College and others in the eastern part of the state.\n\nRobert O’Brien, interview by Howard Droker, April 24, 1975, Robert W.

See Steiner’s complete statement and transcript.\n\n9. Ibid. See Steiner’s complete statement and transcript.\n\n10. Steiner stated:\n\nIn our efforts to deal with this problem, progress can be made by dividing the second generation Japanese into two classes; first, those who are thoroughly Americanized and who identify themselves completely with American life; and second, those who through dual citizenship and long visits to Japan have tended to identify themselves with the Japanese Nation. Among the members of this latter class are found frequently the so-called “kibei,” those who were born in this country but were sent to Japan in early childhood to be brought up by their grandparents and educated in Japanese schools and then returned to this country in later adolescence to get an American education. Since they have a good reading as well as speaking knowledge of the Japanese language, they were the ones who often found employment in Japanese exporting and importing firms in American cities and thus remained to a large extent under Japanese alien influence. It is not assumed, of course, that all ‘kibei’ are more closely attached to Japan than to America, but it is this group that is likely to be most responsible for the widely prevalent feeling on the Pacific coast that all American-born Japanese are lacking in loyalty to America.\n\nIbid.\n\nSee Steiner’s complete statement and transcript.\n\n11.

An interesting aside: Robert O’Brien credits UW professor Calvin Schmid with ensuring that eastern Washington and Oregon remain out of the restricted area.\n\nOne of the things that probably doesn’t get recorded is that sometimes people who work in quiet ways can be very effective in making democracy function, and one of these was Calvin Schmid who was asked by the military to draw the maps and the plans for the evacuation of Japanese and Japanese Americans. Calvin was looking at a map of California, and he drew the line straight north so that the eastern parts of Oregon and Washington would be still available for Japanese and Japanese Americans, and these people did not have to be evacuated.

O’Brien, Acc. 2420-003, UW Libraries Special Collections. See further excerpts from the interview.\n\nApparently eastern Oregon and Washington were excluded because “the natural forests and mountain barriers” divided the states while in California these natural barriers were located in the eastern half of the state so the entire state was designated a restricted military area. J.L. DeWitt, Final Report: Japanese Evacuation form the West Coast, 1942 (Washington DC: Government Printing Office, 1943), 15.\n\n3. Robert O’Brien, interview by Howard Droker, April 24, 1975. See further excerpts from the interview. Tom Bodine remembers that “the staff at the University of Washington, from the president down, worked hard at this project of helping Japanese American students on campus get into colleges in the east. It wasn’t easy because colleges in the east were prejudiced against them as everybody was. Fearful that they were going to be traitors or something.” Thomas Bodine, Thomas Bodine: Japanese American internment, student relocation, World War II (Philadelphia: American Friends Service Committee, 1991), page 6.

According to the World War II Honor List of Dead and Missing Army and Army Air Forces Personnel from Idaho, he died during the war of non-battle causes. Another source, NCOs the Military Tradition, a publication of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center, states that Yamaguchi, a member of the Counter Intelligence Corps, was killed in a plane crash on August 13, 1945 in Okinawa.\n\n15. Evalene Hall Jenness provides a more detailed description of the process. “This plan was drastically altered in July 1942 when the Department of War and the WRA signed a memorandum of agreement pertaining to the student relocation program. The agreement listed an eight-step process to facilitate the transfer of Japanese American students. The procedure now included a dossier on each student that went to the project director of the assembly or relocation center that included many documents such as the student’s questionnaire form, high school and college transcripts and letters of references. The project director sent the completed application to a WRA regional director with the project director’s student recommendation, the rest of the dossier as well as a copy of the applicant’s fingerprints. The regional director then forwarded ‘the essential data to the appropriate FBI, ONI [Office of Naval Intelligence], and G-2 [Army intelligence] offices for a record check’ of each student. Once the record check was completed, the student’s dossier was sent to the WRA office in Washington which passed it on to the Division of Military Intelligence (DMI) at the War Department for a clearance check. The DMI granted or denied clearance, notified the WRA, then the WRA sent word to the NJASRC in Philadelphia. The Council notified the school as well as the student of approval. The WRA then issued a pass to the student so he or she could travel. Lastly, the DMI, ‘inform[ed] the Commanding General of the Military or Corps Area of the presence in his area of such relocated student.'” Jenness, Evaline Hall, “Japanese American College Students during the Second World War: The Politics of Relocation,” (PhD diss., Indiana University, 1993), p.174-175.\n\nDillon S. Myer, Director of the War Relocation Authority, even went so far as to send a letter to college and university presidents noting that “any student relocated at your university through the efforts of the Council will have undergone a thorough investigation as to his loyalty to the United States.” Dillon S. Myer to college and university presidents, 7 August 1942, American Friends Service Committee, Acc. 4791, UW Libraries Special Collections.\n\n16. “Facts about Student Relocation,” Pacific Cable 1, no. 6 (1942):1.\n\nJohn H. Provinse, Chief of the Community Management Division of the War Relocation Authority, further explained why certain schools received clearance:\n\nDespite a sifting process designed to eliminate the possibility of releasing any student of doubtful loyalty, the first lists of cleared educational institutions were limited to rather small schools in locations removed from defense centers or other installations of military importance. In addition to these restrictions, there were a certain number of schools in the cleared category which were unwilling to accept Japanese-American students because of misunderstandings as to the status of the students or the nature of the program or unfavorable sentiment in the community. At the same time, a number of the larger institutions were eager to extend a welcome to this dislocated group, but the presence of training or research programs being carried on for the Armed Services precluded their admission.\n\nHe also noted that until January of 1944 there were a number schools prohibited to Japanese Americans:\n\nAt that time the Office of the Provost Marshal General assumed responsibility for security measures for all branches of the Armed Forces; and the regulations were relaxed to provide that if a student of Japanese ancestry would submit a Personal Security Questionnaire and obtain the approval of that Office, he might attend any school in the United States outside the military areas of the West Coast. For the first time it was possible for the Nisei to attend such schools as the University of Chicago, Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, and some of the large State Universities in the Middle West. After a trial period during which the number of denials was negligible, the last restrictions were removed on August 31, 1944, and Japanese-American students may now be accepted at any educational institution on the same basis as other schools.\n\nProvinse, John H. “Relocation of Japanese-American College Students: Acceptance of a Challenge,” Higher Education 1, no. 8 (1945):1-4.\n\n17.

There is no mention in the Camp Harmony News-Letter or in the Minidoka Irrigator of visits from Sieg. There is a brief mention of students receiving their diplomas by mail in the Seattle Times:\n\nEvacuated Japanese students, who were to receive their diplomas at the University’s Commencement exercises June 12, will get them by mail after the University is sure of their whereabouts, the office of Dr. L.P. Sieg, president, said today. They may not be received until some time after the end of the University term. There are less than 20 Japanese graduating seniors the office said.

The questionnaires were created by the National Student Relocation Council for all students (high school graduates, transfers and those entering graduate school) wishing to relocate to colleges and universities. Students were required to fill out the questionnaire in triplicate. See page 1, page 2 and page 3. Questionnaire included as Appendix F in Robert W.

Henry Okuda later had a hearing in Fort Missoula and was released on basis of old age (he was 74). He was prevented from returning to the Seattle area, now designated a restricted zone by the Army, and was paroled in April of 1942. He went to Spokane sometime in June of 1942.

How the Puyallup Assembly Center got the name Camp Harmony is a mystery. Certainly the name appears in an article in the Japanese American Courier on April 24, 1942. Some, alluding to the boredom prevalent in the camp, referred to “Camp Harmonotony.” See “Local Paper Praises Center Art, Staffs Posters Lauded,” Camp Harmony News-Letter, July 18, 1942. Kenji Okuda preferred to call it “Camp Hell”: “I prefer to call this place Camp “H” instead of Camp Harmony.” Kenji Okuda to Norio Higano, 12 May 1942.\n\n15. Ibid.

Okuda probably arrived in Puyallup on or slightly before April 28, when the first contingent “of cooks, bakers, and other technicians” arrived.

The observer, Joseph Conard of the American Friends Service Committee, went on to say, “There will be approximately 40 rows of these rabbit hutches. 4 hutches to a row, 6 rooms to a hutch. Each room is about 20 feet square and separated from the next room by a partition that runs up part way to the roof. Each room is to house a Japanese family.” Japanese Evacuation Report #8, April 2, 1942, Joseph Conard, Collector, Hoover Institution Library and Archives, Stanford.

In an interview, Okuda described the job as “disseminating information coming down with orders from WCCA or information about what might happen, what have you.

Then assisting anyone who wanted assistance, whether dealing with anybody else.” Kenji Okuda, interview by Louis Fiset, August 9, 1995. Complete interview transcript.\n\n21. Kenji Okuda to Norio Higano, 30 May 1942. He continued,\n\nOn this first Memorial Day after our fateful entrance into a frightening, devastating war . . .thousands of young Americans have already perished and other thousands are fighting furiously dying and killing . . . there is nothing in this camp to remind us of that occasion except a memorial service this evening at 7. No military parade will we see; no valiant or half-hearted display of armed might . . .just a quiet service for those Japanese pioneers who have died striving that we, their children, might inherit something of that Great American ideal, Democracy.\n\n22. Kenji Okuda to Norio Higano, 10 July 1942. These same regulations prevented Kenji’s father from rejoining the family in Puyallup and the family from relocating to Spokane. In this letter he also refers to General DeWitt, commander of the Fourth Army and promulgator of the proclamations, as “Dim Witt.”\n\n23. The report provides the Army’s perspective on the JACL administration:\n\nAt the Puyallup Assembly Center the ‘Evacuee Adminstration Headquarters’ under the leadership of James Yoshimori Sakamoto, blind editor and publisher of the Japanese-American Courier and past president of the Japanese-American Citizens League, succeeded in maintaining harmony and peace for a period of from six weeks to two months. Friction then broke out when a rival group led by Thomas Shinao Masuda and Kenji Ito, both Seattle nisei attorneys, who had just succeeded in gaining acquittal in Federal Court on charges of being unregistered agents of the Japanese government, challenged the Japanese American Citizens League groups authority. Sakamoto’’s supporters, in endeavoring to maintain their authority, adopted the stand that as loyal partriotic Americans the Nisei should make the best of the camp, which was to be a temporary inconvenience at most, and do all possible to cooperate with the United States Government in every way. The opposition, led by Masuda and Ito and supported by most of the kibei group (American born but educated in Japan) and the most pro-Japan element among the alien body, argued that the internal camp administration was undemocratic and un-American because its officers were not duly elected by popular vote and that the Japanese-American Citizens League was a tool of the United States Government agencies such as the Army, Navy and Federal Bureau of Investigation, and had been remiss in its duty to its members and the Japanese community in general when it failed to fight the evacuation orders (at least as pertaining to the Nisei) in the courts.\n\nTo ascertain the view of the Japanese in the Camp the Wartime Civil Control Authorities Camp Supervisor called for a vote of confidence in the Japanese American Citizens League and its administration at Camp Harmony. All evacuees at the center 15 years of age and older were given the opportunity to vote. An overwhelming vote of nearly five to one in favor of retaining the Japanese American Citizens League internal adminstrative body resulted.\n\nReport on the Evacuation and Relocation in the 13th Naval District (Seattle, Washington), Prepared by the District Intelligence Office, March 25, 1943, Papers of the U.S. Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, part 1,\n\nReel 2 0337 [1532-1570].\n\n24.

Later he recalled his departure and the trip to Merced:\n\nWhen Bill Mimbu and I were called, I guess we just had lunch, which means between 12 and 1, and we got a note hand carried over by a lady, asking us to go immediately to McGovern’s office. This was a day or two before we were to start packing to go to Minidoka. Bill and I, according to my recollection, speculated on what the heck we were being called over on such short notice. And then we were ushered in to McGovern’s office. And we were informed by him that we had to be ready to catch the 4:30 train out of Puyallup, to go to California. That I was going to Merced and Bill was going to Stockton. I have some notes on it. My notes indicate that we got the impression that this was an order directly out of San Francisco. That it had come out of probably Bendetsen’s office, or whatever out of the Western Defense Command. I can remember being extremely upset. . . . So for awhile I was thinking well what would happen if I just sit here, come and haul me away and put me on the train. But ah, then my mother and sister and friends all said, that’s ridiculous, you’re going to go anyway, might as well make the best of it. So we were ready when the pick up came and put us on the train with two guards, civilian guards. Slow, dirty train. Bill got off first at Stockton. Apparently, my notes say, Bill and Merrie were given berths for the night on the train. For some reason my mother didn’t get a berth although she was much older than they were. We just sat up the whole time. We got off close to midnight in Merced. Apparently they had a camp ambulance there to greet us, to pick us up and take us to the camp. Then we discovered we had relatives in the camp. Shortly thereafter, less than a week later, they gave us temporary quarters, because they were already starting to move people to Colorado.\n\nKenji Okuda, interview by Louis Fiset, August 9, 1995.

The council created a constitution for the Granada Christian Church which required baptism for membership. Kenji saw this as a “blunder” that would “limit this Kingdom of God.” “Perhaps my idea of the Church isn’t the orthodox, but how can we build the Church Universal upon the orthodox where that has resulted in a thousand Church Infinitesimals. If we expect Christianity to become a stronger force, we shouldn’t try to make all Christians believe the virgin birth of Christ for example.

To them must be presented the challenge of the tensions which face us… a great man does not become so by overcoming little things . . . no . . . it is by overcoming huge things (either physically or mentally speaking . . . thus this camp existence can so temper our faith and strength that no odds will deter us, or so soften us that ours will be the subservient, blindly obedient path akin to that of the Indians or Mexican pariahs.” Kenji Okuda to Mr. and Mrs. Farquharson, 1 January 1943., Mary Farquharson Papers, 1942-1945, Acc. 397-5, Box 1, folder 1, UW Libraries Special Collections.\n\n43.

Sproul and several other men meeting the President, I believe, about this will have its beneficial effects.” Kenji Okuda to Eleanor Ring, 26 July 1942. According to an article in the Pacific Cable, as of September 1942, “156 colleges have accepted students. Of these 111 have been cleared by both the army and navy, 13 await navy clearance and the remaining 32 await both army and navy clearance.” It was not until August 1944 that all universities and colleges were open to Nisei students. For more information on clearance of schools see John H. Provinse, “ Relocation of Japanese-American College Students: Acceptance of a Challenge.” “Oberlin has apparently been approved by the Army – I don’t know about the Navy, but I think that the latter will approve…” Kenji Okuda to Norio Higano, 27 August 1942.\n\n59. Kenji Okuda to Norio Higano, 27 August 1942. The August 27 letter is in two parts. In the first, written from Camp Harmony, Kenji was fairly optimistic about his future: “my hopes are reasonably high.” The second part, written from the Merced Assembly Center after his abrupt departure from Puyallup, is pessimistic. Tom Bodine worked for the NJASRC. See Hirabayashi article and other excerpts from the Pacific Cable, a newsletter published by the Seattle area American Friends Service Committee and Fellowship of Reconciliation.\n\n60. Kenji Okuda to Norio Higano, 14 September 1942. The NJASRC sent a form letter out to all Nisei students awaiting relocation stating that “Do not think that we have forgotten you. As the opening of fall terms approaches we are as anxious as you to see results instead of merely continuing to hope. . . . That more of you have not yet been able to go is owing to the fact that every college and university which might enroll you must first be approved by five government agencies, two of which have their hands more than full fighting a war.” Conard to Nisei students, 18 August 1942, Historical Council Material, Volume II, NJASRC Papers, Hoover Archives, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, Stanford University. Cited in Evaline Jenness Hall, “Japanese American College Students during the Second World War,” 183.\n\n61. Kenji Okuda to Mr. and Mrs. Farquharson, 1 January 1943. Dillon Myer, director of the WRA assured college presidents that only loyal students would be allowed out of the camps. “The Kibei groups who have been partially educated in Japan will not be granted leave either from assembly centers or relocation centers to attend colleges.” Dillon S. Myer to College and University Presidents, 7 August 1942, American Friends Service Committee, Acc. 4791, UW Libraries Special Collections.\n\n62. Kenji Okuda to the Ring family, 6 January 1943. He praised in the same letter the work of Tom Bodine, Floyd Schmoe and Robert O’Brien, “A few are leaving camp very week for school — the effects of Mr. O’Brien’s, Mr. Schmoe’s and Tom Bodine’s influences are self-evident when we study the number of students who have left Puyallup and Minidoka for school with the record of other centers — at least 40 left Idaho, and there were only about 250 altogether at that time. As I try to catch up with the fellows and girls I know, I find them scattered almost all over the U.S. — from Washington State to Simmons College in Boston —’ from the U of Utah to Guilford College in North Carolina. The more I talk with those in this center, the more convinced I am that I was very fortunate to live in the Pacific Northwest where the economic, political and social tensions were nowhere as great and to have know people like yourselves.” Brief mentions of his departure to Oberlin were published in the January 18, 1943 edition of Pacific Cable and the January 14, 1943 edition of the Granada Pioneer.\n\n63. A form letter sent by the NJASRC’s Tom Bodine explicitly used the term ambassdor of goodwill: “Every Japanese American, whether still on the project, waiting for an educational leave, resettled in college or on an employment leave, is an ambassador of goodwill, paving the way for others along relocation lines.” Cited in Allan W.

According to the Time article, “A typical evacuated Nisei student is Oberlin College’s lanky, 20-year-old, bespectacled Kenji Okuda. Son of a former Seattle expressman, he was raised as a Protestant, stood second in his high-school class of 500. At the University of Washington he was Y.M.C.A. president. Hustled into a Colorado relocation project (his parents are still there) after Pearl Harbor, he was released early this year. At Oberlin, Kenji heeled the college paper, made a hit, became student-council president.” “Okuda, Kojima and Company,” Time June 21, 1943, p.?. His election was also covered in The Christian Century, April 14, 1943 and in camp newspapers such as the Tulean Dispatch April 8, 1943.\n\n71. Clipping from the Minidoka Irrigator, 10 April 1943.

He would later muse that his election was perhaps “an indication of widespread student objection to the evacuation, or as a gesture of defiance.” “Reflection on the 40’s: The Impact of the War Years,” Oberlin Alumni Magazine Fall 1995: 10-13. Gordon Hirabayashi in a letter to Eleanor Ring mentions the election: “From Oberlin comes the news that Kenji Okuda is the new student body prexy. Things have a way of happening in a hurry — it seems Kenji just landed on the campus. He has a way of getting around, does very well as a speaker, has a good booster in Bill Makino, finds very favorable climate among the students there. Ken went through a lot of hell, but he stayed on the beam and I guess that is noticeable to others. That was truly good news to have.”\n\n72. Gordon Hirabayashi to Eleanor Ring, 15 April 1943.\n\n73. “Each student released can and should be such an emissary! How many, though, are? We decry the shortage of leaders, but are we in our own small ways doing what we can do for the other Japanese who are less fortunate?
