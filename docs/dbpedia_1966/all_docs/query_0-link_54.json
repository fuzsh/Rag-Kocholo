        "text": "Class Notes\n\n1940s\n\nRalph Draves ’49 attended OWU after World War II. He had several different careers and ended up teaching on Long Island, N.Y., for more than 25 years. Upon retirement, he and his wife moved to Asheville, N.C. He became active in the local bicycle club and was renowned for his cue sheets. Bicycling took him touring in Europe, particularly the Netherlands. In his early 90s, health problems forced him to give up strenuous activities, and he has concentrated his attention on his daughter Kyra and grandchildren Alexandra and Camden. Overall, he has enjoyed his twilight years and has no regrets.\n\nCatherine Winkler Olds ’49 made an acquaintance in Dr. Roy Bossert’s organic chemistry lab that resulted in a marriage of almost 68 years to Bob Olds ’50, who died in March 2018. She continues to live in their home in Brigham City, Utah, where they raised four successful citizens: an attorney, a CPA, a computer engineer, and a college professor. They added eight grandchildren and five great-grands. Olds worked in public education for 36 years and has conducted handbell choirs for adults and youth for 21 years. She says attending OWU was one of the best decisions of her life.\n\n1950s\n\nPat James Simpson ’54 reports from Tuscon, Arizona that all is well in the desert. She’s sure most of her classmates are probably confronting some age-related issues but doing the best they can. Her kids are doing well, and the grandkids are doing amazing things in college and beyond, which is what really counts. Cheers to those still here and best wishes to all!\n\nGilbert Smith ’54 and his wife Richeen Hettinger live in Canandaigua, NY.\n\nPatricia “Pat” Cochran Davis ’59 married Bob Davis in 1960. She taught second grade for three years and then was a stay-at-home mom for three boys, who went on to give her seven grandchildren. Pat volunteered for many service organizations, enjoyed trips to many countries, and is now focusing on visiting our national parks. She spent 27 years living in an 1853 stone farmhouse on 100 acres — “a dream come true.” Her husband retired from his plastic surgery practice in 2002, and they downsized to a townhouse in 2003. Their hometown has been York, Pa., for 46 years.\n\nMarcia Van Scoy Davis ’59 is retired from college counseling at Cuyahoga Community College. Davis and her husband Jim live in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and would welcome the opportunity to share Cleveland’s cultural richness with OWU visitors.\n\nJill Shanks Eliot ’59 of Grandview Heights, Ohio, retired as director of the Imaginating Dramatics Company, a youth dramatics and musical theater company she founded. She taught for 37 years and directed 400-plus productions, participating in many special events and performing for many government officials. Working with her husband, Don Eliot ’59, Alpha Sigma Phi, was her joy. Don, whom she married in the OWU chapel in 1959, passed away in 2014 and left a “hole” in her heart. Together they wrote five musicals. Their granddaughter, Amelia Naille ’21, is the 29th member of the family to attend OWU. Jill writes a column for her church and serves on its executive board. She hopes all the “Tweedies” will be back in force at the reunion! “La Vie Boheme - There’s no day like today.”\n\nFred Fulmer ’59 and his wife Judy have enjoyed retirement for the last 20 years on the 47th floor of a highrise condo overlooking Lake Michigan in downtown Chicago. They enjoy cooking, walking the lakefront, and visiting Chicago’s restaurants and cultural attractions. Fred’s hobbies include photography, reading, and fishing. The Fulmers travel extensively, having visited all continents except Antarctica. Fred has enjoyed trekking with a Denison buddy in England, Scotland, Switzerland, and New Zealand. He also participates in a peer learning program at Northwestern University, belongs to a writing group, and has had photographs and articles published in Northwest Journal.\n\nAnn King Gunsalus ’59 married her high school sweetheart Jim after graduating from OWU and lived in Larchmont, N.Y. They have three sons, including Curtis Gunsalus ’89 and Eric Gunsalus ’87. She had two careers: teaching in public school and a home business, “Calligraphic Art.” In 1994, she and Jim retired to a house they had built overlooking Nauset Beach on Cape Cod, Mass. They have traveled and enjoyed their six grandchildren. She taught Sunday school for 15 years and has enjoyed three writers’ groups, a Pi Beta Phi group, two book clubs, her garden club, and keeping up with fellow alumni on Facebook.\n\nGay Martin Hendricks ’59 and her husband John moved back to Minnesota to be closer to family in 2015. In 2016, they sold their house in Bella Vista, Ariz., in 18 hours. They then moved to Cumberland, Wis., (their summer home) to await a call from Waverly Garden in North Oaks, Minn. John passed away in August 2107, of mouth cancer, although he never smoked. Four months later, Gay received a call that an apartment would be ready for her on Jan. 1, 2018. She misses John dearly yet does love her life at Waverly, a Presbyterian Homes complex.\n\nHarry Kepner ’59 enjoyed an exciting 21-year career in the Air Force. He retired as a lieutenant colonel and went directly to work for EDS (Ross Perot’s company) for 16 years. He dabbled in independent consulting work for a few years, then became a volunteer with Meals on Wheels and the Area Agency on Aging. Four years ago, he and Carol Kraus Kepner ’60 moved into an active older-adult living community in Dallas and are loving it; it has everything they need including an on-site medical center. Forty years a Texan.\n\nDiane “Dutch” Mulvihill Millard ’59 and her husband Bob Millard ’60 are enjoying their retirement years in San Diego. Their three children and six grandchildren bring them much joy. Diane volunteers in a first-grade reading program, and they enjoy serving their church. Diane is currently the chaplain for her P.E.O (Philanthropic Education Organization) chapter, which supports women’s opportunities to pursue their dreams for further education, and she has been attending community Bible studies for the past 15 years. Playing in a bridge group and her love for reading as a member of a book club help to keep her mind active. Bob and Diane are so grateful for meeting at OWU over 60 years ago!\n\nJan Root Peak ’59 taught school for several years in Euclid and Elyria, Ohio. In 1961, she married Jim Peak ’59 (Sigma Tau Epsilon). They had three sons and a happy 51-year marriage. He died at 75 after a long illness. Peak earned an accounting degree and pursued various related jobs. She also became a potter and did folk-art pieces in the north Georgia mountains. In 2013, she moved to Carlyle Place, a retirement center in Macon, Ga. There, she met David Reed ’57, which seemed the most unlikely of possibilities, and they married in 2014. He died last May from a fall due to Parkinson’s. She walks daily and at 81 is just starting to take clogging lessons. She cherishes the richness of her life experiences.\n\nJoanne Hlavin Ritter ’59, Pi Beta Phi, B.F.A., recently read that “if you have a garden and books, you have everything.” As a lifelong gardener and reader, she knows that to be true. An active community volunteer in Bellefontaine, Ohio, she is a member and past chair of the City Tree Commission. Since 2002, she has led a group of 14 women, “elves,” in decorating the downtown for the holidays. Using her art degree, she designed the arch commemorating the “First Concrete Street in America,” Court Street. Most of all she is a wife, mother, and Nanna.\n\nDon Saliers ’59, of Atlanta, has taught theology, liturgy, and music at Yale and Emory universities — with many guest lectureships in between — for more than 50 years. One of the great joys of his life has been combining church music, scholarship, and engagement with social issues. Writing a book and giving concerts around the country with daughter Emily have been rare privileges. Fifteen books and hundreds of essays later, it is still the act of working with students and anyone eager to learn that animates his life. Oh, then there is hiking, jazz, and a bit of golf thrown in.\n\nJudy Sanders Selby ’59 enjoys life with her partner, Reid Spencer (Amherst College ’55). She is retired as marketing professor at the College of Charleston and was principal at Selby and Associates, a marketing consulting firm. She is now an active volunteer. She has two daughters, one in Los Angeles and one in New York, and one granddaughter, age 15. A rescue dog named Bonnie is now Judy and Reid’s faithful companion. She’s afraid of everyone but them. Reach Judy at judy.selby@gmail.com.\n\nCarol Smith Simpson ’59 and her husband spend half of the year at their condo in Louisville, Ky., and the rest of the time at their condo in Bradenton, Fla. They still consider Louisville their home.\n\nBeryl Mullen Whaley ’59 retired from teaching from the Murray, Ky., school system in 2001, and Peter Whaley ’59 retired from Murray State University in 2003. They relocated to Salisbury, Md., in 2007. Daughters, sons-in-law, and nine grandkids keep them busy. Daughter Sharon will become an empty-nester. Sandra teaches. Janet works for Easter Seals. Two sons-in-law are enjoying new jobs, the third received a major promotion. Two grandsons are employed. An employed granddaughter was married; another will graduate with a job. Five other grandkids have had successful school years. Collectively, the families spent a week at Beryl and Peter’s beach house in Fenwick Island, Del. Beryl has had a good year. Heart rehab, cataract surgery, and removal of two melanomas have helped Peter’s doctors keep their skills sharpened. The Whaleys have been very blessed.\n\nDavid Yoder ’59 and his wife Elizabeth moved to Portland, Ore., in 2015 to be closer to their daughter’s and son’s families. While they lived in San Francisco for 50 years, they also called New York and Los Angeles home. Yoder spent his career in advertising, starting out with Campbell Soup as a “normal” client and ending up sprinting with Apple, Intel, Microsoft, Dell, and other roller coaster technology firms. The goal was to stay one day ahead of them. Yoder was a media specialist or a director for nine (often crazy) advertising agencies. His wife was a medical social worker.\n\n1960s\n\nSue Aikman Alperin ’64 worked for the American Red Cross for five years, and she met her husband, an Air Force dentist, in the Philippines. They were married in 1970, moved to his hometown of Miami and one year later moved to Portland, Ore., where they still reside. They have two children, Scott and Mandy, and two grandchildren. Sue worked mostly in the mental health field but pursued her interest in interculturalism through a master’s degree in intercultural relations. Her last job was at Destinations Services, helping corporate clients temporarily moving to Portland. She loves to travel and has been to five continents. She also gardens, cross-country skis, hikes, and volunteers.\n\nWilliam “Bill” Barton ’64 is enjoying the benefits of retirement: more time to enjoy the journey and appreciate life, family, get-togethers with friends, travel, and those special times with his granddaughter. Bill and his wife Carol (Duquesne ’66) recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with OWU friends in attendance, followed by a trip to China and Vietnam. They live in McLean, Va., where they raised their family and enjoyed professional careers; now it is a center for connection to old friends and family. Remembering the OWU experience never gets old, and Bill can’t wait for the next 50 years. Reach him at wbbarton2@gmail.com.\n\nSue Wilson Bynum ’64 lives in New York City and is retired after 50 years working in nonprofits, government, and business, as well as her own consulting firm, dealing with public relations, marketing research, and planning. After getting an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, Bynum has continued her commitment to nonprofits, tutors English, serves on several boards, and has been actively involved in the United Methodist Church for the past 20 years. She’s married to Bob Kimtis, who is retired after a Wall Street career, and she has two children and four wonderful teenage grandchildren. In addition to enjoying family and all that New York has to offer, they love to travel the world.\n\nTom Fenton ’64 and his wife Sharon still live in historic Marietta, Ohio, overlooking the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers. So far, the rivers have been kind to them, allowing them to view them from above and never from within or below. Recent events: text grandkid, gym workout, archaeological dig team volunteer (Sharon), pickleball, Transatlantic by Colum McCann, volunteer (Tom) for student drug-screening, hiking Colorado, and luck.\n\nNancy Nail Molitor ’64 has lived in Atlanta most of her married life (52 years), migrating after the Navy years to Delta Air Lines with her pilot husband Art. Retiring from the workforce early to be a stay-at-home mom, she has made time to volunteer with no shortage of travel and recreation, with boating and outdoor pursuits a common thread. They try to keep up with their two delightfully different grown children and their families, a son in Savannah, Ga., and a daughter in the Dominican Republic.\n\nMichael Murphy ’64, Sigma Chi, married his wife Chris in 1970 and moved to Aurora, Ohio. Mike worked as a general dentist and Chris owned a physical therapy practice. Now they are retired and living in Charleston, S.C. Mike and Chris carry and walk 18 holes three times a week, go dancing weekly, and typically close down the bar. Mornings when Chris is outside running 7 miles, Mike is indoors watching Fox News and old movies, sometimes with a bloody mary. They have made great new friends. Despite the distance separating them from old friends, they have kept in close contact by attending each other’s celebrations and traveling together. They know how to retire!\n\nRon Pierre ’64 and Barb Hites Pierre ’64 are “retired” in LaGrange, Ohio, yet continuing their usual activities: serving the Lord in their church and ministries in Italy, Haiti, Africa, and the U.S., plus business involvements in commercial real estate, a biomedical company, and Sorrento Ristorante, while traveling and keeping up with their family of six, their spouses, and 24 grandchildren. They thank God daily for His undeserved grace: for both present and eternal blessings through the faith He gave us to believe in Christ, our Savior (Ephesians 2:8-10), for giving them each other, their family and friends, and for energy to enjoy all!\n\nJanet Ahner Rubinoff ’64 finally decided last fall at 76 to retire from teaching at York University in Toronto. She is enjoying her “freedom” and trying to get some long-postponed writing done. Her address is 92 Maplewood Ave., Toronto, ON, Canada M6C 1J5.\n\nMaeve Murphy Shapiro ’64 recounts that recently, after asking her husband for the umpteenth time, “Where is...?” he casually remarked, “You’ve got five good years left.” “Oh, no,” she shuddered, “I’ve caught a case of the olds.” Thankfully that thought prompted her to reflect on her life’s journey — definitely a fun one. After graduation she headed to the East Coast with classmates. Fourteen years later and nine months pregnant, she drove to the West Coast with a master’s, a Siamese cat, and a husband. She started a psychotherapy practice in Tustin, Calif., where she still resides, and had two children, both of whom followed their father’s career in medicine. At this stage of life, her favorite activities are coffee with friends, duplicate bridge, and entering the digital world. She does not have a bucket list. However, she still has wanderlust and would go on an interesting trip any time. And although she only has five good years left, she knows who she is!\n\nBetty Bright Stallings ’64 earned an M.S.W. at the University of Wisconsin in 1966. She founded a nonprofit organization and served as its executive director for 14 years. This led her to write six books and travel the world speaking on issues related to nonprofit groups for 20-plus years. Retired at age 75, she is now active as a volunteer with Asante Africa Foundation after two amazing trips to South Africa. She’s been married for more than 53 years to Charles Stallings and has two grown daughters and four grandchildren. She lives part-time in Pleasanton, Calif., and Del Mar, Calif.\n\nNabil Ailabouni ’68, of Dublin, Ohio, retired from a career of teaching and finally found the time to relax and reminisce about events, people, and circumstances that influenced his life. He wrote and published a book, My Life’s Journey as a Palestinian Christian, including his years and experiences at OWU. His story also highlights the tragic events of how he and his family became refugees and unwelcome in their ancestral homeland. In 1964, OWU became his threshold to higher education and his gateway to personal freedom and American citizenship.\n\n1970s\n\nGeoffrey Greif ’71, professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore School of Social Work, was named UMB Teacher of the Year for 2018. He is the longest-serving faculty member at the School of Social Work and thanks Tom Brittenham at OWU for encouraging him to go into the profession.\n\nCheryl Smith Benefield ’74 retired in 2006 after 30 years of service as an educator in the DeKalb County School System in Georgia. She wrote her first book, Nathan’s Story, in 2009, which chronicles the medical miracles, life transitions, and lessons learned from her beloved son Nathan, who was born in 1994 with Down syndrome and was initially diagnosed as profoundly deaf. She’s also the CEO of Miracle Believers Inc., and believes her mission is to encourage, equip, and empower the brokenhearted and disenfranchised. Currently she serves as the minister of congregational care and women’s ministry coordinator at her church and resides in Atlanta.\n\nLise Uptegrove Chase ’74 was married to Peter Chase ’74 for 25 years. During the next 19 years, Lise worked as an intercultural specialist, coaching executives prior to their international assignments. For 10 years, she volunteered many hours in the community of Darien, Conn., while her world travels continued. In 2016 she remarried and was widowed in 2018. She currently lives in Millbrook, N.Y., and her retired life revolves around family, friends, travel, and hobbies.\n\nPeter Chase ’74 earned a master’s in international business studies from the University of South Carolina. His 25-year marriage to Lise Uptegrove Chase ’74 resulted in three sons: Matthew, Timothy, and Andrew Chase ’07, and five grandchildren. Chase spent 32 years at the Colgate Palmolive Co. in international marketing, living with his family overseas for 16 years. In 2009, he married Dan Robinson of Scotch Plains, N.J. They are enjoying retirement with summers in East Hampton, N.Y., and winters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. They travel extensively and enjoy their growing families. Chase joined the Alumni Board in 2017 as director. In 2007, he established a scholarship endowment in the name of his late father, Dr. John N. Chase ’49, who taught zoology at OWU from 1955 to 1974 and served as provost from 1975 until his untimely death in 1977.\n\nJim Diem ’74 has been a school bus driver for 28 years in Michigan, as well as a photographer, reporter, editor, and publisher of the weekly Newberry News since 1989.

They have three children.\n\nMarie Eslinger ’74 and Robert (“Red”) B.G. Horowitz ’74 have been married for 43 years and live in Manhasset, N.Y. They have three sons.

The foundation was happy to establish two scholarships for OWU students. Previously, she was president of Eslinger Associates, a legal consulting company. Robert went to law school at the University of Miami, graduating with a J.D. degree in 1977. He practices intellectual property law in New York City and has been a partner with BakerHostetler for 11 years. Classmates may remember that he was very active in the OWU Music Department, and he continues his love of music as a classical tenor soloist in his church choir and in a choir he started 30 years ago that performs annual Christmas concerts. He still takes voice lessons; his teacher is Peter Maravell (who was an original, and the youngest, member of the Robert Shaw Chorale).\n\nLorraine Farquhar ’74 reports that retirement came too soon, as a career in medical center and college fundraising hit a wall in the 2009 recession. She enjoys living in Ardmore, a suburb of Philadelphia, and doesn’t get to Ohio much these days. She sends greetings and best wishes to her classmates.\n\nChris Knisely ’74 serves as president of the Athens City Council in Athens, Ohio.

Barbara has spent the majority of her retirement in service with Church in the Circle (formerly First United Methodist Church of Cleveland). The Children’s Defense Fund Freedom Schools has been a fantastic use of her energy as project director, consultant, and evaluator for a little more than 10 years.

The kids are delightful! Walking on the beach is great. The downside of island living is when hurricanes come calling. Hurricane Florence was nearly a direct hit. Her island held up fairly well. She lost a huge pine tree that fell across her yard instead of on her house. She was so lucky and thankful!\n\nCarolea Graf Radke ’79 is loving life! She fills her time in Inverness, Fla., with golf and travels often on weekends to attend her daughter’s swim meets. Her twins, Karlea and Brett, are now 15. Brett is big-time into bowling.

It’s been fun raising three city girls; they’ve had a wonderful time taking advantage of all that Chicago has to offer. Working in the high-tech field his entire career has been intellectually challenging with every day being different. He has been fortunate to work with great people, travel the world, and enjoy a high quality of life.\n\nTodd Griesman ’84 finds it hard to believe, but his oldest child is preparing to look at colleges, and the youngest isn’t that far behind. Both he and his wife Emily have new jobs, at LDI Color Toolbox and Equinix, respectively. Todd’s website, NYCcopierGUY.com, was recently updated with a new look and tons of information. The couple continues to live in New York City, but the next move is beginning to creep into the conversation.

Suffering is optional!\n\nCarrie Harris ’84 is serving on the committee for her 35th class reunion, which will be part of Reunion Weekend 2019 on campus May 17-19.

Scott and Tammy love to ski, hike, run, and mountain-bike.\n\nKimberly Crawford McConville ’89 still works in her major as a lobbyist and trade association executive.

Her husband Bob retired from his active duty USMC career, and they are now settled in Delaware (state, not town), where they are raising their 11-year-old son, Cooper. Jennifer’s contribution to the world at large is the occasional pretty photograph, sparkly piece of handmade jewelry, or a watercolor painting. And she survives it all thanks to her OWU Girls (they know who they are!).\n\nMarcia Campo ’94 has remained in northeastern Ohio since graduation, working in sales for several industries, including advertising, lawn care, and tourism.

The rest of the time she tries to figure out how much wine she can drink to survive the tween years and still fit into her pants.\n\nKimberly Boggs Hull ’94 has two daughters, ages 16 and 18. If you don’t see her at Reunion Weekend, it’s because Ellie’s graduation is on May 18. Bad timing! She hopes to make it to campus from Dublin, Ohio, for some of the late-night gatherings. Her family has a great time traveling together. Yet, she always looks forward to her yearly gathering with her sisters from OWU.

As an economics/politics and government major, she joked that her dream job was “Julie McCoy from The Love Boat.” That path took a few turns, but she is now very fulfilled as owner of Powell Travel and Tours.
