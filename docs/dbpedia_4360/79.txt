It Has Arrived! The First Skyranger Ninja 600 in the US!

Our Skyranger kit made the journey from the UK unscaved. After the boxes were unloaded from the delivery truck and we started inspecting and inventorying the parts. We were very impressed with the care that went into the packaging of the kit. Most of kit components were very well marked and had the associated hardware loosely installed in the correct order (huge time saver). A packing list with drawings was included to make process easier.

We started building the upper and lower sections of the forward fuselage, then connected them together with the uprights. That this point it started to look like something you could sit in, we resisted the urge to climb in and make engine noises.

We Continued to add small Items and hardware in the sequence outlined in the builders manual. One thing I can not stress enough is to read ahead in the manual, it will save you many headaches going forward.

We installed the Floor, battery box, diagonal center tubes, and motor mounts. The control stick went in next, its starting to feel more and more like an airplane. We assembled the Rear fuselage and installed the new 600KG/1320LBS landing gear. The new gear and bush wheels come we supplemental instructions separate from the builders manual. Many pre-built cables were installed to strengthen the rear fuselage. It really looks great on the wheels!

We added the hydraulic brakes to the gear, this required some head scratching, then we drilled a hole in both legs of the main gear to attached the brake calipers We added the brake handle to the control stick and installed the flap control lever.

Working alone we would have about a 56 work-hours into the project at this point
