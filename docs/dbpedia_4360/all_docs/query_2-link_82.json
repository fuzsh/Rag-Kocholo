        "text": "MBDA Deutschland and Rheinmetall have signed a deal to integrate the Small Anti Drone Missile (SADM) into the Skyranger 30 short-range turret system.\n\nThe letter of intent highlights the long-term cooperation needed for the development, production, and interoperability of the capabilities, as well as other future launcher and digital systems architecture.\n\nThe two companies will also look into incorporating the SADM into other Rheinmetall military vehicles.\n\nMBDA’s missiles will serve as one of the Skyranger’s main solutions against small- and medium-sized drones, gaining a high hit probability even at stand-off distances.\n\nRheinmetall chief digital officer Timo Haas stated that they are now in the earliest stages of the program’s setup.\n\n“The Small Anti-Drone Missile is an ideal and logical addition to the capabilities of Rheinmetall’s systems and vehicles. We are working in advance and are already creating the conditions for the industrial set-up in order to quickly implement the customer’s decisions,” Haas shared.\n\nThe Skyranger 30\n\nRheinmetall’s Skyranger 30 was designed to provide ground units with a mobile system that can take on fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, as well as unmanned aerial systems and cruise missiles.\n\nIt has an effective range of up to 1.8 miles (3 kilometers), which can extend to 3.7 miles (6 kilometers) when integrated with missile systems.\n\nIt monitors its surrounding space with an active 3D AESA search radar, and a passive 360-degree fast infrared scanner."
