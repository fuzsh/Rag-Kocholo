Do you dream of having a job where you work outdoors in a hands-on environment?\n\nIf so, then becoming a Utah State Park Ranger may be just the career you’ve been looking for.\n\nNon-Law Enforcement Rangers are key assets in the operation of Utah State Parks and our programs. These rangers work hard to raise awareness about responsible recreation practices and engage directly with the public at our beautiful parks.\n\nThey help organize guided hikes, interact with the public at educational events, raise awareness about the importance of protecting our natural resources, and much more!"
