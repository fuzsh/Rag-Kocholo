        "text": "Frame and Body\n\nThe fuselage structure is a traditional, well-understood monocoque design in which the outer skin carries the major part of the load. The majority of the structural parts in the fuselage are produced from sheets of inherently corrosion resistant 6061-T6 aluminum using a CNC turret punch press.\n\nThe Ranger R7 is one of the first examples of a small aircraft that utilizes pre-painted metal to save manufacturing cost, which allows Vashon to produce a less expensive aircraft\n\nAdditionally, Vashon manufactures the vast majority of the airframe parts itself, reducing its supply chain drastically. Vashon invested heavily in manufacturing and tooling to build high quality parts as efficiently and effectively as possible to control costs.\n\nAdjustable Pedals\n\nFor comfort and ease of use, the rudder pedals are adjustable to allow pilots to move them to the perfect spot for their body size."
