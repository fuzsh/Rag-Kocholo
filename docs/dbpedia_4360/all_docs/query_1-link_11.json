        "text": "On February 21, 2024, the German Bundestag's Budget Committee authorized the purchase of Skyranger mobile air defense systems based on the 8x8 boxer armored vehicle, which will be equipped with a 30 mm cannon and reinforced with the latest version of the Stinger guided missile for secondary defense, specifically targeting drones. This initial order, valued at nearly 650 million euros, includes 19 anti-aircraft tanks as part of an air defense strategy focused on combating unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) for immediate and short-range protection.\n\nFollow Army Recognition on Google News at this link\n\nThe German Bundestag's Budget Committee authorized the purchase of Skyranger. (Picture source: Army Recognition)\n\nPrimarily funded by the Bundeswehr's special fund, this order also includes development costs, with contributions amounting to 37 million euros. Rheinmetall, the project's main contractor, will develop these systems based on their Skyranger 30 model.\n\nThe acquired package consists of a prototype, 18 production models, 8 reloading vehicles, and 8 workshop vehicles, as well as 18 simulators, with an option for purchasing an additional 30 tanks in the future. This acquisition aims to urgently strengthen the army's air defense capabilities. Although it is an interim solution, these tanks will be compatible with the future NNbS air defense system, expected to be fully operational later this decade.\n\nThe Skyranger 30 is a modular and scalable hybrid solution designed to counter the full range of future aerial threats. This solution uniquely integrates a combination of effectors: a 30 mm automatic cannon, guided missiles, and, eventually, a high-energy laser (Skyranger 30 HEL variant). Paired with a suitable set of sensors, the Skyranger 30 is capable of autonomously monitoring airspace while selecting the most appropriate effector for the identified threat. Thus, it can protect mobile units on the move or critical stationary infrastructure and facilities from aerial threats, providing an appropriate response to each initial situation to ensure compliance with legal requirements and avoid collateral damage.\n\nThe 30mmx173 KCE revolver cannon has a firing rate of 1,200 rounds per minute. Programmable time-delayed ammunition increases the probability of hitting even the smallest aerial targets. The Skyranger 30's guided missiles enhance the system's operational flexibility and maximum range.\n\nFor the HEL component, Rheinmetall's effectors include a laser source and laser guidance system integrated into the vehicle, as well as a laser weapon station built into the turret, which also serves as a platform for electro-optical sensors. This laser weapon station automatically tracks targets and neutralizes them with a laser beam. Thus, the Skyranger 30 HEL is capable of effectively defending assigned airspace with three different effectors - an automatic cannon, guided missiles, and a high-energy laser - with the appropriate level of intensity.\n\nIn live trials, current technological sample systems for laser weapon systems have successfully achieved laser outputs of 20 kW, with the capability planned to increase this power up to 100 kW. The laser weapon station used has its own sensors for identifying and tracking targets.\n\nThis project has sparked international interest, indicating potential collaborative opportunities in development and acquisition to address global air defense gaps. However, the Budget Committee's approval comes with conditions, including detailed cost breakdowns and assessments of potential cost savings through international cooperation, to be provided in the coming months."
