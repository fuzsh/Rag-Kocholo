        "text": "New York advanced to the conference final, where it will face either the Boston Bruins or Florida Panthers. Florida leads that best-of-7 series 3-2 entering Game 6 at Boston on Friday (7 p.m. ET; MAX, truTV, TNT, SN, TVAS, CBC).\n\nâThereâs a belief in the room and a trust in the guys thatâs been built over the time weâve spent together here,â Rangers captain Jacob Trouba said. âWe know whatâs on the line, we only get so many cracks at it. We wanted to end this thing tonight after letting it slip away in New York (in a 4-1 loss in Game 5 on Monday), so that was the focus. We knew we had one more period to get it done. A lot of guys stepped up big.â\n\nKreiderâs three goals came in a span of 8:58.\n\nRyan Lindgren circled the net and passed to Kreider in front for a tap-in that put the Rangers ahead 4-3 at 15:41. Barclay Goodrow scored an empty-net goal with 49 seconds left for the 5-3 final.\n\nâIt never really felt like we were out of it,â Kreider said. âWe talk about being a resilient group and a competitive group. I think we showed that tonight.â\n\nVincent Trocheck had a goal and an assist, Artemi Panarin had two assists, and Igor Shesterkin made 33 saves for the Rangers, who are the No. 1 seed from the Metropolitan Division. They scored their four third-period goals on 10 shots.\n\nâThat is just a monster third period,â New York coach Peter Laviolette said of Kreider's performance. âI mean, [Kreider] put it on his back and he really delivered. It was more than him, but at the end of the day we needed to score goals, and this is what he does and this is what he did tonight.\"\n\nSebastian Aho had a goal and an assist, and Andrei Svechnikov had two assists for the Hurricanes, the No. 2 seed from the Metropolitan, who avoided elimination twice after the Rangers took a 3-0 series lead. Frederik AndersenÂ made 19 saves.\n\nâWe had chances to build the lead, but obviously we couldnât do it,â Aho said. âWhoever scores a goal gets a little momentum, and they did a good job riding the momentum. It just didnât go our way.â\n\nThe Rangers tied it 3-3 on the power play at 11:54 when Kreider tipped a long wrist shot by Panarin.\n\nâYou donât really see him stress,â New York forward Mika ZibanejadÂ said of Kreider. âSometimes it feels like we donât have much, but we donât need much to get something going. Heâs great with that for our line, to just keep calm, keep working and eventually it will come. Iâm just really happy for him to be able to perform in a game like this, and also very thankful for that performance to come at the right time.â\n\nKreider cut it to 3-2 at 6:43. Andersen pinned the puck against the right post after Zibanejad flipped it there from below the goal line, but Kreider punched the puck in before Andersen could secure it.\n\nâIt definitely hurts. You donât want to give them life,â Andersen said. âI thought I had it covered and I wasnât able to get my glove down on it. A mistake. Tough timing for that. We werenât able to bounce back this time.â\n\nRangers forward Jack Roslovic won a battle with Jaccob Slavin along the right boards before Zibanejad worked the puck wide of Brent Burns.\n\nâObviously, that goal was a tough one,â Carolina coach Rod BrindâAmour said. âIt just canât happen, we know that. You canât give a team like that a goal, and I thought we gave them a couple.â\n\nCarolina took a 1-0 lead with 1:22 left in the first period. Jordan Martinook made a backhand pass from behind the net to Martin Necas, who roofed a shot over Shesterkinâs glove.\n\nThe Hurricanes increased the lead to 2-0 on the power play at 4:38 of the second period. Seth JarvisÂ popped in a loose puck from the crease after Aho tipped Svechnikovâs wrist shot through Shesterkinâs pads.\n\nTrocheck cut it to 2-1 at 5:29 when he tipped Panarinâs long wrist shot from above the left circle following a long clearing attempt by Hurricanes defenseman Dmitry Orlov.\n\nAho extended the lead to 3-1 at 9:23. He took a pass off the right boards in the neutral zone and held the puck on a 2-on-1 with Jake GuentzelÂ before scoring on a wrist shot.\n\nMartinook prevented a Rangers goal at 13:05 when he slid on his stomach to clear the puck off the goal line after Lindgrenâs backhand from in close trickled through Andersenâs five-hole.\n\nThe Rangers were outshot 20-14 after two periods.\n\nâThere wasnât a whole lot said after the second,â Trocheck said. âItâs just that we knew that wasnât the way we needed to play in order to win hockey games in the playoffs. We just had to go out there and make a decision in the third period, and either show up and play and be a part of the series or donât. I think we had 20 guys show up in the third.â\n\nNOTES: Kreider became the third player in NHL history to score a third-period hat trick that included a Stanley Cup Playoff series-clinching goal (Guentzel, Pittsburgh Penguins, Game 6 of 2018 first round; Jack Darragh, Ottawa Senators, Game 5 of 1920 Stanley Cup Final). He became the third player in Rangers history to score a hat trick in a potential series-clinching game, joining Mike Gartner (Game 5 of 1990 Patrick Division Semifinals) and Steve Vickers (Game 5 of 1973 NHL Quarterfinals), and also is the third player in New York history with three goals in a playoff period (Mark Messier, Game 6 of 1994 conference final; Wayne Gretzky, Game 4 of 1997 conference quarterfinals). â¦ The Rangers reached the conference final for the second time in three seasons; they lost in six games to the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2022."
