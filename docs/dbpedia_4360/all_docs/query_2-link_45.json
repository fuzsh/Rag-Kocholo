        "text": "A very rare 1991 Ford SkyRanger has been listed on eBay with a \"buy it now\" price of $33,999.\n\nBelieved to be one of the only 17 cars ever made, the SkyRanger is based on the Ranger Extended Cab with a six-cylinder 4.0-liter engine and a four-wheel drive system receiving power from a five-speed manual gearbox. It was transformed by the American Sunroof Company (ASC) and according to the eBay listing this particular car is likely the sole survivor.\n\nIt appears to be in good condition and has been driven for just 7,279 miles (11,714 km). The SkyRanger comes bundled with the original dealer brochure and benefits from a functional air conditioning system, power locks, cruise control, power windows, custom wheels and power seats.\n\nThe listing which will come to an end tomorrow has a starting bid of $28,999 and at the moment there aren't any bids."
