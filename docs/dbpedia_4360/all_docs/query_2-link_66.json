        "text": "History\n\nThe Boxer armored vehicle project, initiated in 1993 by France and Germany, saw the UK join in 1996. After France’s exit in 1999, the Netherlands joined in 2001. The project produced twelve prototypes and introduced the “Boxer” name in 2002. The UK departed the project in 2003, while the Netherlands and Germany proceeded with orders of 200 and 272 vehicles, respectively, with the Dutch deliveries starting from 2013 and the first German Boxer delivered in 2009.\n\nThe Skyranger 30 commenced its development as a conceptual Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft (SPAA) system. It was formally introduced in March of 2021 under the designation “Oerlikon Skyranger 30.” This innovative platform showcased advanced features, including a remotely controlled turret and the incorporation of the 30mm Oerlikon Revolver Cannon (KCE-ABM). Additionally, the system demonstrated versatility by offering the capability to be outfitted with Short-Range Air Defense (SHORAD) missiles, thereby extending its effective range from 3000 to 6000 meters.\n\nWeaponry:\n\n30mm Oerlikon Revolver Cannon® KCE-ABM\n\nCapable of firing: HEI-T, FAP, TP-T, APFSDS-T and ABM (KETF)\n\nMK266, PMC308, PMC287\n\nShort-Range Air Defense (SHORAD) missiles:\n\nStinger, Mistral and Chiron(optional)\n\nCoaxially mounted 7.62mm MG\n\nMain Features:\n\nRemote controlled gun/missile turret\n\nElevation angles of -10° +85°\n\nEffective range: up to 3,000m, with missile 6,000m\n\n30mm Oerlikon Revolver Cannon® KCE-ABM\n\nRate of fire: 1,200rds/min\n\nRapid single shot mode: 200rds/min\n\nIntegrated 7.62mm CoAx machine gun\n\nReady to fire ammunition: 252 x 30mm, 1,000 x 7.62mm\n\n2 integrated SHORAD missiles (option)\n\nIntegrated 360° AESA search radar -5° +85°\n\nIntegrated 360° fast infrared scanner FIRST -5° +18°(option)\n\nFully stabilized electro-optical sensor unit\n\nKu-band or X-band tracking radar (option)\n\nBallistic protection: up to level 4 (STANAG4569)\n\n2 x9 Rosy smoke grenade launchers\n\nTwo operator consoles in vehicle (commander/gunner)\n\nLaser Rangefinder with up to 20km range\n\nOther Features:\n\nThe primary electro-optical sensor suite designed for tracking comprises a High-Definition Television (HD TV) camera featuring a variable Field of View (FoV) ranging from 30° to 1°. Additionally, it incorporates a High-Definition Infrared (IR) thermal camera with FoV specifications of 21.8°/4.6°/1.3°. The central Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) search radar, operating within the S or X bands, boasts a maximum range of 20 kilometers and offers complete coverage spanning 360° around the turret, ranging from -5° downward to +85° upward, with this aswell being covered by the integrated 360° fast infrared scanner FIRST with elevation angles of -5° +18°. Notably, the sensor package is capable of independent rotation from the turret, with the ability to depress to -15° and elevate to +85°. In addition to possessing automated capabilities for target detection, acquisition, and tracking, all made possible by the fire control module.\n\nMobility:\n\nThe Skyranger 30, with a weight of 34.7 tons, is powered by the 530 kW (711 hp) MTU 8V199 TE20 Engine. This engine is paired with the Allison HD4070 transmission, equipped with 7 forward gears and 3 reverse gears, enabling the Skyranger to achieve speeds of up to 103 km/h.\n\nArmor:\n\nThe Skyranger 30 is built on a standard Boxer chassis, reinforced with AMAP composite armor capable of withstanding 14.5x114mm Armor-Piercing (AP) rounds at a distance of 200 meters, or meeting STANAG4569 armor standards. Notably, the turret is equipped with an equivalent amount of armor as the hull.\n\nPictures\n\nSkyranger 30-A3 (thanks to @Faster_Boiiiii for sharing the picture and sources)\n\nLeichtes Wirkmittel 1800+ anti drone missile modification(Credits to @Faster_Boiiiii for sharing pic and sources)\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.rheinmetall.com/Rheinmetall%20Group/brochure-download/Air-Defence/D994e0222-Oerlikon-Skyranger-30.pdf\n\nRheinmetall Air Defence unveils its Skyranger 30 (upgraded) - EDR Magazine\n\nEntwicklungsauftrag aus Ungarn für Rheinmetall Lnyx-Skyranger-Variante | Rheinmetall\n\nx.com\n\nSmall Anti Drone Missile Integration in den Skyranger 30 vereinbart\n\nhttps://www.mbda-deutschland.de/pressemitteilung/ila-2024-rheinmetall-und-mbda-unterzeichnen-vereinbarung/\n\nRheinmetall und MBDA unterzeichnen Vereinbarung | Rheinmetall"
