        "text": "After spending most of my life appreciating Australia’s natural ecosystems and working closely with wildlife, I have now been fortunate enough to become a Ranger in one of the most exceptionally beautiful locations in the world – the Wet Tropics Rainforest.\n\nHave you ever seen a Musky Rat-kangaroo or heard of the elusive Lumholtz Tree Kangaroo? It’s extraordinary the flora and fauna you can find within this ancient rainforest, and I’d love to show you this living museum!\n\nCome and experience the magic and unlock the secrets of the Wet Tropics with me on the lush boardwalks of Red Peak. It’s another world out here!\n\nI am an expat from Austria and I found my paradise in Cairns, Australia. I am an avid landscape photographer and spend most of my time in the outdoors.\n\nI love that my workplace is one of the most amazing eco-systems in the world (with some of the best views to match!) and I enjoy unveiling the fascinating history and mysterious stories of this magnificent rainforest with you.\n\nTropical rainforest is nature at its best and my favourite part of the ranger tour is when I see your enhanced appreciation of this incredible living green museum.\n\nI am fluent in English, Japanese and Chinese and am a very passionate Skyrail Ranger. I am lucky because there are not too many jobs in the world where your ‘office’ is world heritage protected tropical rainforest.\n\nMy favourite part of the ranger guided tour is imparting our knowledge about the Basket Fern. It’s an amazing story of how fascinating the rainforest is, as it’s more than just a plant but its own mini eco-system.\n\nI would love to tell you many fascinating rainforest stories on a ranger guided tour with me at Red Peak!\n\nBeing part of the Skyrail family for almost 20 years, it is very important to me as an Indigenous Ranger that I get to showcase the rainforest and my culture, the world’s oldest living culture, with you.\n\nThe Barron Gorge National Park is a special story place, a healing place, and a sacred place to me, and the Djabugay people.\n\nI take great pride in sharing my heritage and its significance, so join me at Red Peak / Guriguri Bunda: where I feel like I have the whole world at my feet!\n\nI relocated to the beautiful Tropical North Queensland a few years ago now and thankful that I work immersed in nature every day.\n\nOne of the highlights of guiding at Red Peak as a Ranger is discussing the Rattan palm, also known locally as the wait-a-while plant. It’s rewarding to see how guests begin to recognize and discuss the palm after my explanation.\n\nThis shift in their observation shows their growing curiosity and appreciation for the rainforest’s complexities, and it reminds me of the valuable role as Rangers we play in enhancing their understanding of this precious ecosystem.\n\nGrowing up here in Cairns has given me a great appreciation for this beautiful region.\n\nI am incredibly passionate about sharing stories of the Rainforest and witnessing people’s eyes light up and connect deeper to the forest on my Boardwalk Tours. I feel there is so much healing for the soul when you are surrounded by greenery.\n\nI feel being nature in helps so much with anxiety and mental health. My favourite part of the boardwalk is the Ancient Queensland Kauri Pine. What an incredible specimen, that has survived 400 years on this mountain top/island in the sky.\n\nAs a photographer, I like to look through the lens of beauty.\n\nI am privileged to have worked across 6 continents chasing adventure and all the wonders of the natural world. Formerly a Zookeeper tending to a diverse range of species, including rescued bears, monkeys, and Koalas to name a few!\n\nContinuing with my exploration of new terrains; in the ancient rainforest alongside the Great Barrier Reef, I am constantly searching for unique creatures to identify and amazing plants to discover.\n\nSo come and take a walk with me through this corner of antiquity. Let us learn together on this journey of exploration on the boardwalk at Red Peak.\n\nMy exposure to the environmental sciences early on began my deep-set love for nature. Having grown up and then studied in Cairns through JCU, I was always surrounded by rainforest.\n\nPrior to working with Skyrail I was a Blue Mountains National Park ranger, as well as bush regenerator. Working in these fields has become natural to me, as well as something I thoroughly enjoy and feel passion for.\n\nWith my background in recreational rock climbing, I have spent countless days exploring the Wet Tropics. It is a pleasure to help others connect with these areas, while simultaneously doing my bit to protect them.\n\nI love learning and sharing knowledge, so being a Skyrail ranger allows me to fully explore that side of myself and use it to enhance the experiences of others.\n\nFor the past ten years, I’ve called the lush tropical rainforests of Cairns and the Wet Tropics World Heritage area home.\n\nSharing the wonder of this ecological wonderland with visitors on the boardwalk of Red Peak is the absolute highlight of my job.\n\nEvery day, I get to witness the awe-inspiring beauty of the Wet Tropics, working alongside our amazing team to conserve and protect it together.\n\nJoin me during your ancient rainforest experience and let me share my stories with you.\n\nOriginally from Japan, I have lived in Cairns for over 20 years. I love sharing stories about the beautiful tropical rainforest, especially the remarkable diversity of flora and fauna that can be seen at Red Peak.\n\nMy favourite rainforest creature is either the Southern Cassowary, an impressive dinosaur bird that saunters through the rainforest undergrowth, or the delicate Ulysses Butterfly, its striking blue colour standing out as it flutters through the tropical green rainforest.\n\nI look forward to sharing more about these rainforest inhabitants with you on a ranger guided tour at Red Peak!"
