        "text": "Rheinmetall has tested its mobile Skyranger 30 air defense system, paving the way for its system qualification in mid-2024.\n\nIt included live firing by the vehicle’s A1 configuration in static and mobile modes.\n\nThe A1 is a development test bed whose “flexible design enables efficient testing and optimization of multiple customer variants with different radars and effectors,” the German company explained.\n\nThe Skyranger 30\n\nThe Skyranger 30 is a remote control gun turret mounted on a ground vehicle.\n\nIts main component is a 30mmx173 KCE revolver cannon, capable of shooting down targets up to 3,000 meters (9,842 feet) away.\n\nIt can also be armed with short-range missiles such as the Mistral, Stinger, and Chiron.\n\nRecent Contracts\n\nHungary and Denmark have contracted Rheinmetall to develop mobile air-defense systems with the Skyranger 30 turret mounted on a Lynx KF41 infantry fighting vehicle and Piranha 5 armored personnel carrier, respectively.\n\nGermany also plans to buy the turret for the Boxer 8×8 wheeled armored vehicle.\n\n“The Skyranger 30 A3 will decisively counter current and future aerial threats – including drones – enabling ground troops to focus on their actual mission,” Rheinmetall stated.\n\n“The well-thought-out design of its diverse array of ordnance, high mobility and state-of-the-art sensors enable both autonomous and networked operation.”"
