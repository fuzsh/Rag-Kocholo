        "text": "The Leading Trainer in French Flight Schools\n\nTo many observers, the Sky Ranger looks like a RANS Coyote. Based on general appearances, it appears the French light plane borrowed heavily from the popular model sold by the Kansas light plane kit leader. But, Sky Ranger importer Richard Helm bristles a bit when he hears that statement and retorts, “People compare the Sky Ranger to the RANS Coyote. They say it’s a knockoff, but the French designer didn’t take anything from the Coyote. It’s built completely different,” although he admits, “It does look a lot like the Coyote.”\n\nGive a Yankee welcome to the Sky\n\nRanger. The French-designed\n\nultralight is typical of a trend I\n\nthink we’ll be seeing with increasing\n\nfrequency—imported light planes from\n\nEurope. Sky Ranger is built in the\n\nUkraine by Aeros, Ltd. I visited this\n\nfactory with Phil Lockwood of\n\nLockwood Aviation in the spring of\n\n2001. Once built by Synairgy in France,\n\nSky Ranger production moved to this\n\nformer eastern-block country in 1997.\n\nAeros has found a ready market in the\n\nUnited States and around the world for\n\nits attractively priced and good-flying\n\nhang gliders. The company also makes\n\ntrike wings for Sabre and many other\n\ntrike manufacturers, so its entry into\n\nfixed-wing ultralights using the\n\nconstruction methods of hang gliders\n\nwas a logical development.\n\nBecause the Sky Ranger was first\n\nintroduced to the French market, it has\n\nbecome one of the most popular club\n\nplanes in its native country, widely\n\nused by instructors to train new pilots.\n\nIn France, as in most of Europe,\n\nultralights are commonly owned by\n\naero clubs that manage recreational\n\nairfields. These aero clubs provide an\n\neasy, low-cost way for average pilots to\n\nfly and for newcomers to be introduced\n\nto flying. Many aero clubs provide\n\ninstruction, and the clubs own and\n\nmaintain the aircraft. The aero club\n\nconcept has worked especially well with\n\nsailplanes; Europe has more than twice\n\nas many sailplanes as the United States\n\nand several times the sailplane pilot\n\npopulation. In fact, the aero club\n\nconcept is an idea that U.S. enthusiasts\n\nmay want to consider when the new\n\nsport pilot/light-sport aircraft rules are\n\nadopted.\n\nFrench Origins\n\nCreator Phillippe Prevot had\n\nambitious design goals for the Sky\n\nRanger: He sought to “develop an\n\nairplane…with good performance but\n\nwith the possibility of being built by two\n\npersons in a week and that could be\n\ninspected and maintained by a person\n\nwithout special or technical knowledge.”\n\nBuild it in a week! And maintain it\n\nyourself? With ease? Sounds like hype,\n\nbut according to Rich and east coast\n\nrepresentative, Kevin Green, Sky Ranger\n\ndoes go together fast and simply. Rich\n\nstates, “It’s the most popular ultralight in France, especially in the flight schools.”\n\nIn just over half a decade, the company\n\nclaims deliveries of 500 Sky Rangers.\n\nBecause the Sky Ranger is\n\nappropriate for newer pilots,\n\nits landing gear may\n\noccasionally suffer hard\n\nlandings, but its easy repairability is a\n\nbenefit for recreational pilots who prefer\n\nflying to handling wrenches. Owners\n\ncan reasonably handle more of their\n\nown repair work, say Rich and Kevin.\n\nPhillippe worked hard to keep the\n\ndesign as simple as possible. The Sky\n\nRanger requires no welding, uses only\n\nstraight main airframe members, and\n\ndoes not use composite materials for\n\nstructural components. “The Sky Ranger\n\nis of typical ultralight construction with\n\ntubes bolted together,” clarifies Rich.\n\nOverall, Sky Ranger is based on\n\ntriangulation from the centerline of the\n\nfuselage. According to Rich, the design\n\nhas earned a French patent for the\n\ntubing airframe structure and its lack of\n\ncomplex, formed members.\n\nBesides the simple design concept,\n\nthe Sky Ranger has no obstructing\n\naircraft components to make your entry\n\nharder. You need not slide behind,\n\naround, or step over any tubes to enter\n\nthe Sky Ranger. This is rare among light\n\naircraft designs, especially those using\n\naluminum tubing for the main structure.\n\nRich says two people can fold the\n\nwings in 20 minutes; however, I never\n\nwitnessed the effort. Folding wings have\n\nbecome a marketing plus for many\n\ndesigns, and Sky Ranger has also found\n\nthis to be true.\n\nI found the Sky Ranger I flew to be a\n\nwell-equipped ultralight, especially at a\n\nfairly modest price ($12,500 without\n\nengine). My evaluation aircraft had\n\nhydraulic brakes, flaps, in-flight trim,\n\nremote primer, electric start, and an\n\nelectric Ivo prop joined to a Rotax 503.\n\nSky Ranger’s standard equipment flap\n\nlever is tucked almost out of sight\n\nbetween the seats and has a squeeze\n\nhandle to allow movement between\n\nthree positions of flaps plus a neutral\n\nposition. The in-flight trim is located at\n\nthe back of the seat frames between\n\npilots. A small lever adjusts tension on\n\nthe elevator linkage in a manner\n\ncommon to ultralights.\n\nAmericans Will Fit Well\n\n“Two large pilots should fit well in\n\nthe Sky Ranger,” says Rich. “Another\n\n200-pounder and I fit comfortably, and\n\nthe Rotax 503 performed very well,” he\n\nexplained while also endorsing the\n\nlower cost engine. In my flying, I also\n\nfound the popular two-stroke to be\n\nample.\n\nEven for big folks, entry into the Sky\n\nRanger is not hampered, thanks to a\n\nlone side structural member. Positioned\n\nat your hips, this single tube on a 45-\n\ndegree angle is padded and mostly out\n\nof the way.\n\nIn fact, you may come to\n\nlike it just as sports car buffs prefer their\n\nauto seats with side bolsters to securely\n\nhold you in place. Especially with the\n\ndoors off, pilots accustomed to some\n\nside structure may like the tube’s\n\nposition.\n\nIn fact, I found it comforting. I have\n\nlots of experience with even-more-open\n\nultralights, and I usually enjoy the\n\nsensation. However, in the Sky Ranger\n\nwith no doors installed and almost no\n\nside structure, I got a weird feeling that I\n\ncould fall out. This sensation\n\nheightened when I deliberately made\n\nuncoordinated turns or maneuvers to\n\ntest the ultralight’s control responses.\n\nThough I rarely get this feeling and\n\ncan’t explain it in Sky Ranger, at least\n\nthe machine’s very sturdy seat belt\n\nsystem and that short, padded tube at\n\nmy outside hip offered me a little\n\nsecurity. Doors are available for the truly\n\nuneasy.\n\nI found the access to the primary\n\ncontrols such as the joystick, flap lever,\n\nand trim lever to be good, but I really\n\ndidn’t care for the throttle in the Sky\n\nRanger. For me, it was too much of a\n\nreach and offered no place to rest my\n\nhand. If you keep your hand on the\n\nthrottle constantly, as I often do, the\n\nlocation caused fatigue. Rich says you\n\ncan set up the throttle as a push-pull\n\nknob, like a Cessna, but that wouldn’t\n\nhelp much over the lever arrangement.\n\nYou’d still have the reach and no\n\nsupport point.\n\nBecause the Sky Ranger’s seats are\n\nonly adjustable during construction, I\n\ncouldn’t move the seat up closer to\n\nreduce my reach to the throttle. My\n\nreach to other switches and knobs was\n\nfine, so moving the seat forward\n\nwouldn’t ease the long reach to the\n\nthrottle.\n\nThe Sky Ranger’s cockpit arrangement\n\nfelt somewhat like the older Kolb\n\nMark III as your legs and feet had to\n\nangle toward the center of the fuselage\n\n(New Kolb’s Mark III Extra fixes this\n\nshortcoming). The angle was less\n\npronounced than in the Kolb, which\n\nhas a pointier nose, but I found it less\n\nthan optimal in comfort.\n\nI also noticed heat being directed\n\nonto my left, outside leg and generally\n\ninto the foot area of the cockpit. While I\n\nwould love this during a Minnesota\n\nwinter, my foot broiled in Florida’s\n\nstifling heat.\n\nLocating the brake on the forward\n\nside of the joystick was as useful and\n\neffective as any other designs that\n\nemploy this mount, and the Sky\n\nRanger’s hydraulic brakes worked with\n\nsurprising power.\n\nPrevot’s skylight design—basically\n\nencompassing the entire fuselage over\n\nthe cabin—allows you to look out the\n\nskylight in turns opposite your seating\n\nside. But, because you sit high relative to\n\nthe wing, turns had to be rather steeply\n\nbanked to see laterally. In the Sky\n\nRanger it seemed to me that you’re best\n\noff using lateral vision before the turn.\n\nWith the doors off and its large skylight,\n\nincluding two windows in the fabric\n\nabove the fuel tank area, the Sky Ranger\n\noffers broad visibility.\n\nPerfect for\n\nInstructional Use\n\nFor this flight evaluation, I used an\n\naircraft donated by owner Tony Berman.\n\nTony and Phillippe built this Sky Ranger;\n\ntalk about your factory service! The two\n\nassembled the plane in three, 16-hour days\n\n(or 48 hours’ construction time) and flew it.\n\nGranted, the clear coating, instrument\n\nfitting, and attachment of the cowl came\n\nlater but in only three long days, my test\n\nSky Ranger went from crate to flight.\n\nDespite the factory attention to\n\nbuilding, this test bird had a mild right turn\n\nin it that caused me to use left rudder\n\nnearly all the time. Combined with the\n\nangled reach, I kept having to reposition\n\nmy feet on the pedals to get a better\n\npurchase on them.\n\nRich says that by adjusting the bungee\n\ncord attached well aft of the pilot in the\n\ntailcone, you could fix some turn tendency\n\nby sliding the bungee to the appropriate\n\nside. This has limits, of course, but for small\n\nadjustments, it may prove sufficient. By\n\ncreating a small opening in the skin on the\n\nunderside, you can reach up and\n\nmanipulate the bungee, which is attached\n\nto a mid-cone cross member. Using such an\n\naccess point, you could occasionally make\n\nadjustments. Making this access point is\n\neasier than it sounds because the aircraft’s\n\ncovering envelope, which slips on the\n\nfuselage, has reinforced seams joined by\n\ncord lashing or Velcro closures. Ultimately,\n\nyou’d want to correct the turn by aileron\n\nrigging when time permits, but a quick\n\nadjustment as just described would help\n\nwhile en route to a destination.\n\nRich explained that Phillippe always\n\ntightens up the return bungees on the\n\nrudder pedals quite firmly as he believes\n\nthis configuration is better for students, as\n\nRich accounted for some rudder stiffness I\n\nnoted. By making the pedals resist\n\nmovement, a student must work a little\n\nharder to fly the plane, but Phillippe feels\n\nthey’ll get necessary feedback while their\n\ntactile sense of control movement\n\nsharpens.\n\nThe dissimilarity of efforts—smooth,\n\nfairly light stick versus stiffer rudder\n\npedals—made the harmony between stick\n\nand rudder less than perfect. My Dutch roll\n\ncoordination exercises in the Sky Ranger were done with much less bank angle than in the Sky Raider II I’d flown earlier in the day. I made good quality but shallower Dutch rolls, which says a lot about overall control lightness, response, and harmony. As I tried to do them as steeply as I’d just done the Sky Raider II, I wallowed around the sky. Of course, my lack of experience in the model also contributes to control sloppiness.\n\nGet Up and Go on the Cheap\n\nSky Ranger has sprightly if not inspiring performance. I loved that this airplane had a Rotax 503 engine, though Rich admits that he sees the logic for the 912-engine installation. Naturally, 80 hp versus 48 hp would give shorter take off rolls and stronger climbs, but it’d also cost $8,500 more and raise the weight by 70 pounds.\n\nMy experience suggests that the agreeably priced Rotax 503 could perform well in a flight school environment. Everybody loves the 503, and you save a lot of upfront cash, though one argument in favor of the 912 is that total overhaul expenses will be lower in the long run.\n\nClimb in the Sky Ranger with the 503 engine is only about 500 fpm, I’d estimate. Tony had not installed an altimeter, so I couldn’t be certain. Conversely, Rich and his 200-pound friend found the Sky Ranger climbed well even in Rich’s hot home state of Arizona with its higher density altitude.\n\nIndividual performance categories are important, but Sky Ranger’s overall package is a good one. Sky Ranger has won World Championship status two times since 1996. In the first two contests since the model arrived on the market— not counting one in 2001—Phillippe Zen, then a dealer for the Sky Ranger in France, won in his competition class.\n\nRich summarizes this achievement simply. “If it wins, it must be a pretty good performing ultralight.” Wellrounded qualities and good piloting technique combined to help Zen and his Sky Ranger to log the dual victories.\n\nThe Sky Ranger’s cruise was fairly speedy, thanks to an electrically adjusted prop. I recorded a high of 88 mph during some runs, while Phillippe reports that a 80-hp 912 will only go about 93 mph. Keep in mind that installed instrument error is always a factor in my reporting.\n\nStalls occurred at low speeds, in the high 30s, again dependent on instrument accuracy. But intuitively I felt I could sense the lighter weight of the smaller engine and lighter airframe. All stalls—power on, power off, and accelerated—resisted any tendency to fall on a wing, and the nose break was mild or nonexistent. Indeed, these characteristics are good for students and for the rest of us.\n\nI did no spins or other unusual attitude maneuvers because the aircraft didn’t have a parachute. Sabre Aircraft, Rich’s company, works closely with BRS and a system installation for the Sky Ranger is expected, but none was installed on this test ultralight. However, chutes have been fitted on the design, as Rich referenced a deployment in South Africa in the last couple years. Unfortunately, information was sparse as to why the need arose or how the emergency system performed.\n\nI’d Advise a Close Look\n\nIf you have an interest in this airplane, you have several sources to see it. At the time of its introduction, Sky Ranger was already represented in three distinct locales of the United States and in Canada.\n\nSabre Aircraft, located in the greater Phoenix, Arizona, area, has the U.S. and Mexican distribution rights; Speedwing has Canada. Acting as dealers through Sabre Aircraft, Florida-based Arnet-Pereyra, manufacturers of the Aventura and several other aircraft, and Kevin Green of West Virginia-based Green Landings, distribute the aircraft. Kevin is enthusiastic about the Sky Ranger and has consummated numerous sales. He also represents Flightstar Sportplanes.\n\nThe Sky Ranger is billed as an “ultra-fast build kit” with the flaps, ailerons, tailplane, vertical stabilizer, rudders, and elevator coming pre-built and covered. The rest of the airframe is referred to as “a number of subassemblies.” In addition, the factory says that, “All joints come with the bolts already in position and attachment brackets already in their places.”\n\nTony Berman says that covering the Sky Ranger was one of the easier jobs, as those surfaces merely slip on and tie up.\n\nThis is a big difference over conventional\n\ndope-and-fabric covering, which then\n\nrequires heat-stretching, priming, and\n\npainting. You save both time and money\n\nwith the Dacron envelope solution.\n\nGreen Landings advertises good prices\n\non all models of Sky Rangers, and they\n\nhave clear pricing about the cost to build\n\nit for you. Even if the task is supposedly\n\nquick and simple, it still takes 100 hours\n\nor more, making the Green Landings’\n\noffer of interest to many time-starved\n\npilots. And, if built as a Part 103\n\nultralight, building the aircraft for you is\n\ncompletely legal.\n\nThe basic Sky Ranger kit, without\n\nengine, runs a shade over $12,000. Add\n\nthe Rotax 503 plus mounts, exhaust,\n\n(non-electric) prop, and your choice of\n\ncolors, the price tag hits $15,500. If you\n\nmust have the 80-hp 912 Rotax plus its\n\nelectric starter, you’ll spend almost\n\n$24,000. Those interested in four-stroke\n\nadvantages might also choose the HKS\n\n700-E engine, which would offer more\n\nthan adequate power at lower cost. But\n\nthose aircraft will definitely not meet the\n\nweight limitations of FAR Part 103, so\n\nbuilders would need to register those\n\naircraft in the experimental amateurbuilt\n\ncategory.\n\nDespite the higher price of the 912\n\nmodel, Rich says, “I’ve looked at it all\n\nand I’m convinced the 912 is the way to\n\ngo.” He calculated purchase price,\n\noverhaul and maintenance, and fuel\n\nconsumption and believes the fourstroke\n\nengine is worth the considerable\n\nextra cost. Rich also agreed that the HKS\n\n700E would make a good powerplant for\n\nthe same reasons.\n\nTo compare, the Rotax 503 adds\n\nabout $3,500 to the airframe price, not\n\nincluding the effort of installation. Have\n\nSabre install a Rotax 912 and the\n\ncomparable value is around $11,000\n\n(though they do the work of installation\n\nfor this price). Have Sabre fit an HKS and\n\nthe add-on to the airframe will be under\n\n$9,000 thanks to new, lower prices from\n\nthe Japanese engine distributed by\n\nHPower Ltd.\n\nBig engine or little, four stroke or two,\n\nSky Ranger makes an interesting new\n\nchoice for private owners and flight\n\nschools. Either way, you might feel at\n\nhome in the Sky Ranger.\n\nPublished in Experimenter Magazine"
