        "text": "The Skyranger family offers mobile defence against all current and future battlefield air threats. The Skyranger combines superior firepower, active and passive sensors and the dynamics needed to engage the most demanding targets performing loiter, pop-up or dive attacks. The use of best-in-class cannon systems means that the Skyranger can stand its ground against swarming attacks and its mobility means that it can be deployed alongside ground forces or for stationary vital-asset protection. The Skyranger can independently generate its own local air picture whilst its command and control architecture (Skymaster), IFF and data link mean that it can be seamlessly integrated into the battle order and command structure.\n\nDepending on the tactical needs and the required target spectrum, the Skyranger can be equipped with a 35 mm x 228 KDG revolver cannon or a 30 mm x 173 KCE revolver cannon. Both cannons are characterised by a high rate of fire, excellent precision and airburst ammunition. The 35mm calibre offers C-RAM capability and an effective range of up to 4,000m. The 30 mm calibre has an effective range of up to 3,000m and the gun turret is designed to also mount short-range air defence missiles.\n\nThe highly modular design approach chosen allows customized active or passive sensor configurations. These include AESA radars, passive panoview systems and optronic packages. Advanced algorithms are used to fuse the sensor data together, classify the targets and support the operators in their decision making. As the threats evolve, so does the Skyranger. Integration of a high-energy laser or vertically launched C-PGM missiles is being explored."
