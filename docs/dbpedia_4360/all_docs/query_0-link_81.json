        "meta_description": "skyranger swift 2 42750for sale. Our very lovely Sky-ranger swift 2. Weve owned it for approximately 9 months and have enjoyed every minute of it. Its been a great first aircraft for myself and my wife, and now its only for sale because we are looking to move on to a newer aircraft. It is a 2017 model, and currently has 315 hours on the engine and slightly less on the airframe. It is fitted with the Berringer brakes and wheels which are very effective. It has all the gauges as can be seen in the photos, including a transponder and radio. It has pilot aware fitted, End of wing spats and strobes, and landing lights. We only bought this because of its condition, and the 80 horse Rotax only had approx 260 hours on it so we have added the 55, which i believe is still very low for its age. 15 h",

I will be open to sensible offers, but they will need to be very close to the asking price. Many thanks Pete"
