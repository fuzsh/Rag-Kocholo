        "text": "The Aeryon SkyRanger is a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities. It was developed by Aeryon Labs for government and public safety agencies, and military forces. The sUAS was launched in May 2013 and is simple, reliable and easy-to-use in confined environments.\n\nThe Aeryon SkyRanger can be deployed in missions including tactical ship boarding, anti-piracy tactics, covert intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), tactical situational awareness and targeting, de-mining, and perimeter and convoy security.\n\nIt system can also be used for the management of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) and hazardous materials (HAZMAT), and to provide emergency and disaster response.\n\nThe SkyRanger system completed performance trials in June 2013 as part of the Robotic Aircraft for Public Safety (RAPS) programme of the US Department of Homeland Security, and Borders and Maritime Security Division (BMD). The performance parameters including flight time, range from base station, ground speed, landing accuracy, and launch and recovery methods were tested during the trials.\n\nDesign and features of the Aeryon SkyRanger sUAS\n\nThe SkyRanger small UAS integrates a new airframe and unified system design offering superior safety over manned aircraft in potentially dangerous situations. The VTOL capability ensures the SkyRanger to hover on the target for extended periods.\n\nThe sUAS measures 102cm in diameter and 24cm in height when deployed. The folded length and width of the system are 50cm and 25cm. The system weighs up to 2.4kg without payload. The entire SkyRanger system fits within a backpack and can be re-assembled without tools.\n\nThe UAS is integrated with tablet ground control station (GCS) solution. It also has the ability to automatically detect potential threats and set up visual no-fly zones.\n\n\"The system can fly beyond the line-of-sight in manual mode as well as in a programmed flight path.\"\n\nThe system can fly beyond the line-of-sight in manual mode as well as in a programmed flight path. It can switch between payloads with automatic connectivity.\n\nPayload\n\nThe SkyRanger small UAS platform is equipped with integrated imaging payloads and custom payloads to collect high quality imagery and data. The stabilised and simultaneously streaming dual electro-optical / infrared (EO/IR) cameras equipped with click-to-aim control can operate at a range beyond 5km in low-latency all-digital 256sbit AES encrypted network.\n\nThe three-axis EO camera offers high definition video and can capture still images with up to 15 mega-pixels resolution. The IR camera can collect still images and high quality video with 640×480 H.264 quality. It can switch between white-hot and black-hot modes. The video can be transmitted to any mobile device over the specified IP network.\n\nPerformance of the Aeryon SkyRanger small UAS\n\nThe sUAS can perform safe flight in sustained wind speed of 65kph and gusts of 90kph. It can fly in extreme weather environments with operating temperatures ranging from -30°C to +50°C. The VTOL configuration eliminates the need for launch and recovery equipment.\n\n\"The system can conduct continuous operations for up to 50 minutes with payloads in normal environment.\"\n\nThe system can conduct continuous operations for up to 50 minutes with payloads in normal environment. It automatically returns home and lands once the user-configurable limits are reached. The point-and-click touchscreen of the system displays battery minutes and flight time at all times.\n\nEquipped with secure network pairing, the SkyRanger UAS operates in custom radio frequencies of 900MHz and 2.4GHz. It incorporates red / green and red / near-infrared (NIR) navigation LED arrays. It is also equipped with dynamic flight plans including Follow-Me protection and AutoGrid mapping functions.\n\nThe above ground level altitude of the system is 450m, while mean sea level altitude is 4,500m."
