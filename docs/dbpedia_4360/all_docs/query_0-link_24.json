        "text": "An all around low-wing sport model based off a 1970âs classic.\n\nThe Sky Ranger 40 is as much fun to build as it is to fly.\n\nUsing updated design techniques and laser-cut precision, weâve designed this kit so most any modeler can successfully build it in a short amount of time.\n\nThis all-around sport modelâs retro design looks great in the air and makes you look like an ace pilot. Loop it, roll it, spin it, snap it, and just have a great time flying it.\n\nPower the Sky Ranger 40 with either an electric or glow powerplant.\n\nWeâve designed the fuselage with a built-in hatch, so you have quick access to either your LiPo batteries or fuel tank. The wing is removable via two bolts from the underside of the model.\n\nOur Sky Ranger 40 was reviewed by Terry Dunn in Model Aviation magazine. Check out his video report below..."
