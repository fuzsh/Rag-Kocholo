        "text": "SUNRISE, Fla. — It’s over for the New York Rangers. The Florida Panthers advanced to their second straight Stanley Cup Final with a 2-1 win in Game 6, sending the Presidents’ Trophy winners out in the Eastern Conference final.\n\nSam Bennett’s goal with 48.5 seconds left in the first period gave the Panthers a lead they held into the third, when Vladimir Tarasenko buried a feed from Anton Lundell with 10:52 left to give them a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Rangers, who chased too many of the games in this series and chased Florida too much, had no pushback after the two-goal deficit, worn down by a Panthers team that executed to near-perfection in front of Sergei Bobrovsky, who made 22 saves.\n\nArtemi Panarin got New York on the board with 1:39 to play but the Rangers didn’t get another good look before the final horn.\n\nNew York goaltender Igor Shesterkin had the best performance in the series for either team and was again excellent in Game 6.\n\nStill, the Rangers could not generate enough even with decent zone time and possession in this one.\n\nFlorida awaits the winner of the Edmonton Oilers versus Dallas Stars series in the Final. The Rangers go out at the same spot they did in 2022.\n\nGoing to be fascinating to see where the Rangers go from here. They appeared to be very well built, with strong centers, multiple elite wingers, a stout defense corps and one of the best goalies in the league.\n\nThe Panthers were clearly the better team in this series, but there's a strong case to run it back with this group (or something very close to it).\n\nWill Rangers' owner James Dolan have the patience for that?\n\nThe Florida Panthers are going to get a second consecutive crack at the Stanley Cup, and they earned it, eliminating the Rangers with a 2-1 win Saturday night.\n\nA huge early goal from Sam Bennett allowed the Panthers to tighten the screws on the Presidents' Trophy winners, who are faced with another offseason that started a bit early.\n\nFlorida, meanwhile, awaits the winner of the Western Conference final between the Oilers and Stars. Edmonton leads that series 3-2, with Game 6 taking place Sunday night.\n\nWhoever winds up advancing will meet a team that, increasingly, has looked like one without any real weakness. They've got high-end skill, quality depth throughout the lineup and a goaltender that, once again, has raised his game in the postseason.\n\nI'm not sure any NHL player has raised their profile on this playoff stage as much as Panthers defenseman Gustav Forsling.\n\nHe makes an early impact there breaking up a Mika Zibanejad rush opportunity with his stick, one of many impressive such plays he's turned into habit.\n\nIt's not even that Forsling has changed his level of play, he's been an outstanding player all season, but he's forced the league to take notice with his showing in these playoffs."
