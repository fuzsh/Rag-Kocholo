        "text": "​​​\n\n​We are all fascinated by the night sky and this is an opportunity for you to explore it with me, a Dark Sky Ranger. The best and darkest stargazing is found in and around where I am based in the Galloway and Southern Aryshire Biosphere and Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park, These are superb areas for stargazing because it is so dark with very little light pollution. The rest of Dumfries and Galloway is great too, when you get away from the towns so there are lots of places that we can choose from for your stargazing experience\n\nWhen are the best times to stargaze?\n\nWinter, early Spring and late Autumn are the best times for stargazing as it gets darker earlier and stays dark for longer so stargazing can start all the sooner. There are all kinds of stargazing experiences you can have.\n\nYou and your family might just want to do something different and get have the experience of being outside at night. I can make sure that you are safe and comfortable. You might want to have a fire to keep warm and stories and activities which help you learn about planets or the moon.\n\n​If you live in a city you might not have seen a really dark sky before and would like a bit of help identifying stars, constellations and finding our galaxy, the milky way.\n\nSpotting the International Space Station (ISS) with astronauts aboard might be what you would like to do. I can point you in the right direction.\n\nYou might want to celebrating a special birthday or anniversary where I can find you a birthday star, arrange a birthday cake or a special picnic and make it a truly memorable experience.\n\n​\n\nI will help set something up so that you can enjoy your star watching experience. Unfortunately there is nothing that I can do about the weather however I try to be as flexible as possible on dates, times and places to give you as good a chance as possible to see some stars. I also have alternative activities that allow us to have a dark sky outdoor experience whatever the weather."
