        "text": "Rangers are an essential part of the Virginia State Park System. Some of the duties of Park Rangers are to protect the plants and animals, preserve the history of each park, share their knowledge with park guests and to ensure the safety of every park guest.\n\nBecome a Junior Ranger today and earn your Official Junior Ranger Badge! Nothing beats a ranger-led program in one of our parks. However, program schedules may not meet your needs, or you might prefer to explore on your own. Ranger-led self-guided programs are available at many parks to assist you in self-exploration. Below is a list of what is available for download. Check with the park office for pre-printed versions or other materials. Also take a look at our list of Junior Ranger events and camps.\n\nJunior Ranger Events\n\nPark Trail Maps\n\nDownload park maps to help you navigate the trails."
