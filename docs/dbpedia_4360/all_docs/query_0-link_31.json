He meets Nancy Feldmore (Marjorie Daw), who worries about his dangerous job.\n\nFarrell flies to a rough border town, where Nancy's father, Senator Feldmore (Henry A.

The leading man, Reed Howes, was an expert stunt performer, but was not an aviator.[5] Consequently, \"most of the more dangerous flying stunts were performed by doubles. Diminutive short-subject \"funster\" Bobby Dunn provides marginal comic relief.\"[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nErisman, Fred.
