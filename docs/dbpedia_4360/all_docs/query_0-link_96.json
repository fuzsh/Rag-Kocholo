It was the first purpose-built aircraft carrier in the United States fleet and sacrificed almost all other qualities in favor of carrying the maximum possible number of aircraft on the minimum possible displacement. The result was a badly unbalanced design.\n\nUnlike the previous Lexingtons, the Ranger was constructed with a flight deck that was built as a light superstructure rather than as an integral part of the hull. The original design called for a flush flight deck, which resulted in several unfavorable design tradeoffs, only to have a deck island adopted almost at the last minute. Exhaust was vented through six folding stacks that proved problematic enough to never be repeated in any American carrier design. The Ranger was almost completely lacking in any form of protection, other than locating the magazines as low as possible in the ship and placing minimal armor protection around the steering gear.\n\nThe authorized air group on 7 December 1941 was one fighter squadron of 18 fighters and one scout and one bombing squadron of 18 dive bombers each. Together with the air group commander's dive bomber, this totaled 55 aircraft. There was no torpedo magazine or other provisions for torpedo bombers.\n\nThe \"minimal carrier\" philosophy behind Ranger was quickly judged a failure, and the next class of carriers (the Yorktowns) represented a return to a carrier design close to the treaty limits. Ranger was considered so inadequate that she was not committed to the Pacific until July 1944, and then only in a training role for night combat air groups. She never saw combat against the Japanese.\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nU.S. Navy\n\nU.S. Navy\n\nReferences\n\nDANFS\n\nChesneau (1992)\n\nFriedmann (1983)\n\nThe Pacific War Online Encyclopedia Â© 2016 by Kent G.
