        "text": "Since its release in 2013, the SkyRanger R60 has captured real-time aerial intelligence across 30 countries, for well over 100,000 collective hours of operation. The world’s most demanding UAS operators have come to rely on the SkyRanger when lives and livelihoods hang in the balance.\n\nWith the new R80, Aeryon is pushing the small UAS performance envelope, with more computing power, more payload capacity, and more advanced software features. Delivering a broader range of mission capabilities, in a wider set of environments, the R80 is redefining what’s possible with a man-packable UAS.\n\nThe new SkyRanger R80 is a robust, multi-mission UAS that provides reliable operations in harsh environments and demanding weather conditions. With a wide range of next-generation hardware and software features, the R80 delivers:\n\nGroup 2-3 payload capabilities in a Group 1 footprint\n\nReal-time on-board AI and computer vision for autonomous missions\n\nA secure Application Development Kit (ADK) and Payload Development Kit (PDK) to enable rapid 3rd-party software integrations and payload developments\n\nA robust IP-54 rated airframe with redundancy in all flight-critical systems\n\nCarry Payloads up to 2 kg\n\nSkyRanger R80 has a payload capacity of up to 2kg, enabling it to carry heavier optics and multi-sensor payloads that were previously restricted to much larger, more expensive fixed-wing UAS. With the new Osprey carry and delivery payload, R80 operators can attach and deliver nearly any object up to 2kg such as radios, ground sensors, medkits, life vests, and more. The R80 adds a new front-mounted EO/IR payload (with image fusion) to supplement bottom-mounted, non-camera payloads.\n\nFlexible and Modular\n\nThe R80’s new PDK extends payload development to end users and third-party integrators, enabling the rapid development of mission-specific payloads for the R80 platform. The R80 also offers an ADK to interface with other control applications across a set of secure APIs.\n\nThe R80’s power is delivered from four redundant batteries, each rated below 99Wh for easy transportation on commercial aircrafts. With its simple plug-in tether kit, co-developed with Hoverfly Technologies, Inc, the R80 can provide persistent endurance for long-term overwatch or surveillance applications, then can be easily reconfigured quickly back into free-flight mode.\n\nAutonomous and Intelligent\n\nWith multiple embedded NVIDIA TX2 processors, the R80 is a flying supercomputer with an engine for real-time artificial intelligence at the network edge, including object detection and classification. To enable autonomous operations or flight in GPS-denied environments, the R80 includes multiple sensors providing flight control inputs, including four dedicated computer vision cameras.\n\nUsing Aeryon’s new Multi-Aircraft Control software, a single pilot can fly multiple R80s from a single Ground Control Station (GCS), on a single network, in coordinated semi-autonomous flight plans. Multi-Aircraft Control builds upon Aeryon’s proven Automatic In-Air Replacement (AIR) technology enabling two R80s to automatically replace one another in flight, automatically handing off camera subjects while maintaining continuous eyes on target.\n\nReliable and Resilient\n\nBuilding off the proven SkyRanger R60 platform, the R80 offers a rugged carbon fiber and magnesium airframe, tested to IP-54/MIL-810G environmental tolerances. The R80 can withstand sustained winds up to 70 kph, and operate up to 15,000’ MSL under its standard propulsion configuration. Mission success is underpinned by two fully redundant communication links, and two flight computers. For operations in denied RF environments, or beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS), the R80 is able to execute semi-autonomous missions without an active wireless link.\n\nAvailability\n\nTo meet the unique requirements of the United States Department of Defense and its other federal customers, Aeryon Defense USA (a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Aeryon Labs), will customize the commercially available SkyRanger R80, which will be known as the R80D. Delivery of the R80D will begin in May 2018."
