        "text": "The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system is an un-corruptible sky ranger that will act as a major deterrent in preventing the slaughter of elephants and other endangered wildlife.\n\nSuccessful anti-poaching operations often have fixed wing or rotary aircraft on station which serves as a major deterrent but, because of their high running cost, many organizations forgo this critical tactical deterrent tool or they use this asset sparingly to save money, which we believe is a grave tactical mistake.\n\nDictated by the sheer area that requires surveillance, Airborne patrols must be an integral part of the anti-poaching plan and they must be continuously airborne to be effective.\n\nThis is where the Sky Rangers 1 & 2 comes into play.\n\nThe UAV technology provides the anti-poaching team with a cost-effective working solution while at the same time, maintaining and enhancing the operational capability, providing invaluable real time information day and night to park management.\n\nThis critical information can now be used to make real time decisions allowing Rangers to deploy anti-poaching teams in a moment to prevent the killing of elephants and other endangered species.\n\nThe technical aspect of this UAVâ€™s capacities makes it uniquely suitable for anti-poaching efforts.\n\nThe Sky Ranger is designed to operate repeatedly and reliably throughout its lifetime and can operate at any time of day or night and in most conditions, delivering data continuously in an efficient and cost-effective way."
