        "text": "Rowdy Harris\n\nPark Manager\n\nI am Rowdy Harris, Park Manager at Devils Fork State Park. My entire life, I have always enjoyed the outdoors, but never really considered being a park ranger. I was looking for something to do for the summer during college, and found out the state parks hired seasonal employees. I started at Dreher Island State Park, part-time in the spring of 2004, fell in love with the job and have never looked back.\n\nThough it is hard to single out a favorite element of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Devils Fork is unique because it is located on Lake Jocassee. That combination of a beautifully clear lake nestled in the rugged mountains makes it a very special place. An added bonus is the lake is a fun, but challenging, trout fishery.\n\nIf youâ€™re a first-time visitor to Devils Fork, make sure you see the Oconee Bells if you are here in early spring when they are blooming. But, a must-do year round is taking a tour on the lake to see the sights and the waterfalls. That is definitely my favorite. Add dropping a lure in the water for a trout or bass, and you've got a perfect day!\n\n**Our Ultimate Outsider stamp is located just outside the Ranger Station at the park kiosk."
