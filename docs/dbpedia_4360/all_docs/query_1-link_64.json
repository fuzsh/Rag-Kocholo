        "text": "Year: 1946\n\nDonation: Gary Lintner\n\nEngine: Continental A-85, 85 HP\n\nDesigned in 1939 by Robert Rummell, Rearwin built 80 units before WWII stopped production of civilian airplanes. Rearwin was reorganized in 1943 as Commonwealth Aircraft Corp and after the war they resumed production of the Skyranger, aimed at businessmen and sport flyers. The slots in the wingâ€™s outboard leading edge let the plane fly with the wing at higher angles of attack than a wing without slots. A technical note: In general, slots are non-moveable openings near the leading edge of the wing while slats are moveable and are installed only on large airplanes.\n\nAdditional Specifications:\n\nCruise: 103 MPH\n\nTop Speed: 115 MPH\n\nEmpty Weight: 910 lbs\n\nGross Weight: 1450 lbs\n\nWing Span: 34'\n\nLength: 21'5\"\n\nHeight: 7'\n\nService Ceiling: 14,000'\n\nClimb in 1 Minute: 650' at sea level\n\nApproximate Number Built: 275\n\n(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's U.S. Civil Aircraft series.)\n\nReturn to the WAAAM airplane collection page."
