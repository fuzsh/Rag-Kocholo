        "text": "I was innocently minding my own business, scrolling through aviation stuff on the local Craigslist, when I ran across a Commonwealth SkyRanger 185.\n\nhttps://lewiston.craigslist.org/avo/d/lewiston-commonwealth-skyranger-185/6966779507.html\n\nI'd never seen or heard of one before. This one has a C-90, is in current annual, and apparently has relatively new fabric. The downside is the owner doesn't seem to know much of its history and only flies it 5-6 hours a year.\n\nBut I'm a sucker for the obscure. I wasn't really looking for something like this to buy, but I'm going to look at it tomorrow.\n\nIs anyone here familiar with this type?\n\nVic\n\nIf my memory serves, the Skyranger is a derivative of a late 1930's Rearwin design, probably on the same Type Certificate. A former Luscombe partner of mine bought one in the late '70's, but didn't fly it a whole lot. But of course he got to abbreviate his logbook entries as \"C-185\" ;-) . I seem to recall a wooden wing structure, so that's something which would need to be carefully looked at, including how it's been stored over the years.\n\nThat said, I've got a soft spot in my heart (and head) for these examples of all these old gems, chasing pretty much the same small market. Let us know what you find out.\n\nThanks. cubscout\n\nI too recall it having a wood spars and ribs. Very roomy. I had a friend with one long ago who seemed to like it. I never flew in it. This is a good description: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Skyranger\n\nThat price is suspicious, unless the owner just wants it gone. The pictures imply that it has been hangared which is a plus.\n\nIt is likely that it is not as well known as the Cubs and Champs because the company went out of business just as the post war boom was starting. They did not have the advantage of a large war time production being all tooled up, along with the war production resources to keep them going.\n\nLet us know what you find. It certainly is not expensive.\n\nSo I checked it out. It looked pretty good. The owner is an older A&P, retired except for a hobby of restoring aircraft. He lives on a private airstrip development 7 miles out of town. I didn't know the place existed. He used to be a spray pilot too. Nice shop with various exotic parts and relics. Turns out he is good friends with a local IA that I respect, who signed the July annual. Reason he wants to sell is to make room for the Ercoupe he has an eye on.\n\nI didn't press him on the low price--I'm going to talk to the IA about that. I did like the airplane: clean and simple. The owner pointed various minor flaws, but the engine seems sound and good compressions measured just 2 months ago. I didn't have time to run it, that will be later. It also has updated Cleveland disc brakes and an electric starter. New mags. I poked around in usual suspicious areas and saw no hint of rust. Logs go back to 1947 and it looked consistently maintained. Top overhaul 6 years ago, overhaul 9 years ago in a shop in Billings. Once concern is low hours over the past 6 years, but that seems common on these kinds of things.\n\nIt has wing slots on the outer wing:\n\nT-craft-like wings:\n\nSo, despite not planning on buying an airplane, I intend to have another set of eyes look it over. I will probably make an offer. My aviation slush fund has built up to cover it. Now I just have to find a hangar....(He did offer to rent me his for the time being).\n\nA friend of mine had one back in the early 80s in Toledo, WA. Nice plane. As previously mentioned, the large vertical stab and small rudder limit the crosswind capabilities, but otherwise a nice solid plane. Was originally born with a C-85. I can tell you the grillwork and exhaust aren't original, but that's probably not a huge surprise. It was built with drilled diffusers on the exhaust. It looks like those are just missing, but shouldn't be an issue. I can't recall what the cowl looked like, but the inlets on that one aren't it. :lol: I'll have to dig through my old photos and see if I can't find my pictures of it. At any rate, if I was in the market for that class of plane, I'd be all over it for that price. Original instrumentation was all the engine instruments in a single gauge around a large tachometer. Kind of like the dash on a 1950s car. ;-)\n\n-Cub Builder"
