        "text": "On April 1, 1994, I was first introduced to Tom Greer. The night before I had reported to C Co 3/75. Tom Greer was a 1LT at the time and was my Platoon Leader. I was a lost man-child that had jumped into the deep end of an alpha male world of warriors. My experiences in the Army to that point had been nothing more than training: Basic Training/AIT, Airborne School, and the Ranger Indoctrination Program. Little did I know that the real training was just beginning.\n\nThe 75th Ranger Regiment in those days is an experience that you would have to participate in to understand. The life of an untabbed private was a crucible of physical exertion (usually in the form of a \"smoking\" for a mistake), trying to learn mission critical skills, weapons maintenance, and mundane tasks assigned by your chain of command. The experience forges a bond closer than most families. Membership in this elite group provides a never ending supply of brothers.\n\nTom Greer made a lasting impression on me from the start. He was like the calm in the middle of the storm. He showed me what true leadership was all about. I remember over-hearing a conversation between him and SFC Porter in the platoon office one day. Tom was leaned back in his chair with his feet up on the desk. He told SFC Porter something to the effect of \"OK sergeant, you have the mission. Your job is to get the platoon ready. Make me look good when we go to the field. If you need something typed up let me know. I went to college so I'm good at typing.\"\n\nNow some may wonder, \"How is that leadership?\" My answer is that he provided the mission. He communicated the standard expected. He communicated that he would provide whatever support was needed. Above all, he trusted his subordinates to do their job! I learned that Tom was a \"Mustang.\" He was a non-commissioned officer prior to becoming an officer through the Army's \"Green-to-Gold\" program. Tom understood that officer's could do more harm than good by trying to micro-manage. The true proof was that from day one you knew that Tom truly cared about his men. He was the calm in the middle of the storm because he controlled the storm. It was because of men like Tom that Rangers Lead the Way.\n\nSeveral years ago a friend, James Thyne, posted an article on Facebook titled \"The Night Ranger Sergeant Harness Passed.\" The article was penned by Dalton Fury. I remember the night vividly so I was interested in reading the article. It did not take long to realize that the perspective was that of a person that was there on the ground. The only problem was that I did not remember a Ranger Fury. That name would have definitely stood out! A quick search on Google provided me with the answer. I quickly found Tom's Dalton Fury Facebook page and followed it. I sent a message that was answered. Over approximately one hour we caught up and I had the opportunity to tell him what I thought of his leadership. For that I am thankful.\n\nSeveral weeks ago I found out that Tom was again in a battle for his life. The enemy this time was cancer. The cancer had dug in and had a strong foothold. Early this morning Tom's body lost that fight. I say that because I know that his spirit has no quit in it. I know that he never quit. I know this because he lived the Ranger Creed!\n\nTom was a Ranger, an operator, a world class pistol-smith, a family man, author, brother, and friend to so many. The world is truly a better place for him having been here. America lost a true asset today. Tom, take your place in the Great Hall of Valhalla, you have earned it. \"For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.\" (2 Timothy 4:6-7)\n\nRangers have a tradition of always doing one more for the Airborne Ranger in the Sky. So Tom, this one is for you."
