At the 1947, Cleveland Air races one of the most eye catching racers was the Lockheed P-38J lightning owned by J. D. Reed and flown by Charles Walling Jr. Reed put a boatload of cash into the modifications to Race #14, and Walling was able to take an early lead from Tony Levier in his P-38L Race #3 during the Lightning only \"Sohio\" trophy race. Levier went on to win the Race at an average speed of 360.866 mph, while Walling took second at 351.785 mph.    *This original work is available for purchase. Painting size in inches: 18 x 24.
