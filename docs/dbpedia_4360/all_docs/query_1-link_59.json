        "text": "Canada will begin transferring 450 SkyRanger multipurpose drones to Ukraine in the summer, and Lithuania will allocate €3 million for FPV drones. This was reported by the press service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.\n\nReportedly, at a meeting of the leadership group of the \"drone coalition\" held the day before, Ukraine informed its partners about the situation on the battlefield and the urgent needs to repel enemy attacks.\n\nAs a result of the meeting:\n\nCanada will start transferring 450 multi-purpose SkyRanger UAVs in the summer.\n\nLithuania will allocate 3 million euros for the production of FPV drones for Ukraine.\n\nThe Netherlands confirmed its intention to contract a batch of Heidrun RQ-35 drones for 200 million euros in cooperation with Denmark and Germany.\n\nGermany will provide VECTOR 211 reconnaissance drones.\n\n\"The situation on the frontline is changing every day, the enemy continues to attack civilian objects, especially energy infrastructure. We need tools for an asymmetric response. The time to discuss solutions is running out, we need it now,\" said Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Kateryna Chornohorenko.\n\nLatvian Defense Minister Andris Sprūds, in turn, called on those present to remember every day that the war is ongoing, so it is time for all participants to join the initiative, which is gaining momentum and is awaiting the accession of new countries."
