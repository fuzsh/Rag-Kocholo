        "text": "Welcome to Ranger III\n\nThe Ranger III is a 165 foot long, 34 feet wide, 648 ton vessel that carries up to 128 passengers. Go here for full Ranger III specs. An experienced nine-member crew takes great pride in maintaining the vessel and serving its passengers. The Ranger III has been in operation since 1958, and is part of a rich history of vessels that have serviced Isle Royale.\n\nThrough its dedicated service, it has fostered strong connections between this remote island and many mainland communities, and it has become an icon of Lake Superior. These Ranger III connections have allowed Isle Royale National Park to serve visitors year after year.\n\nBeginnings\n\nDuring the Eisenhower administration (1953-1961), the \"Mission 66\" program began nationwide to rejuvinate national park lands and facilities. During this time, Isle Royale National Park asked for a new vessel to better connect the mainland to the archipelago it manages. Custom designed for the National Park Service (NPS), the Ranger III was built in 1958 by the Christy Corporation, a shipyard in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. The Ranger III, the largest vessel operated by the NPS, set sail for Isle Royale for the first time on September 8, 1958.\n\nRanger II\n\nAfter WWII, the decayed Ranger was replaced by a surplus Army minelayer. This 114-foot wooden-hulled ship defended American harbors during WWII. Now it would be known as the Ranger II. From 1946 to 1958, the Ranger II carried passengers and tons of cargo to the developing park.\n\nWhat became of the original vessels?\n\nThe first Ranger was acquired from the government by an individual in 1946 and later resold in 1953. The Ranger II was purchased from the NPS in 1961 and later that year sold to the University of Michigan for use by its Great Lakes Research Division. The name of the vessel was changed to Inland Seas, and operated until 1973 when it was again sold to a private individual. The NPS does not have further records after 1953 for the Ranger and 1977 for the Ranger II.\n\nThe Ranger and Ranger II have faded into history, but the original connections made to Isle Royale live on in the Ranger III.\n\nThe Journey Today\n\nYour Isle Royale National Park journey starts at the Ranger III's home port located in Houghton, Michigan. The 73 mile journey to Rock Harbor takes 6 hours. During the first hour of the trip, the ship navigates the scenic Keweenaw Waterway, passing under the world's largest lift bridge.\n\nOnce on the open water of Lake Superior, riding the Ranger III allows one to appreciate the size and breadth of the world's largest fresh water lake (measured by surface area). As Isle Royale approaches, a picturesque seascape transitions to a rugged, lichen-covered shoreline.\n\nFor those traveling to Rock Harbor, the historic Rock Harbor Lighthouse appears at the entrance to the Rock Harbor Channel. During a short stop at Mott Island, the park's summer admistrative headquarters, you'll view staff unload groceries, supplies, boats, building materials, dumpsters, and more to keep the island functioning. For those traveling to Windigo, you'll see the lone sentinel, the Rock of Ages Lighthouse, before turning into Washington Harbor.\n\nThe Future of the Ranger III\n\nThe Ranger III has two primary missions:\n\n1. Provide logistical support to Isle Royale National Park\n\n2. Provide scheduled public passenger service from Isle Royale to Houghton, Michigan\n\nPassenger service operates June through early September. Before and after that time, known as \"freight season,\" the Ranger III is dedicated to island opening and closing operations such as transporting rangers and supplies to and from Mott Administrative Island, Rock Harbor, and Windigo. Each year the Ranger III averages about 80 voyages. Throughout its 50 year history, it has made over 4,000 Lake Superior crossings. Each of these voyages brought supplies and family connections to island rangers, and visitors whose park memories began when they first stepped aboard.\n\nIsle Royale National Park will always be a solitary archipelago amid Lake Superior. For years to come, the vessel which will connect mainland communities to the park will continue to be the Ranger III."
