        "text": "Each year as we commemorate the anniversary of the day that changed our world forever, we ask you to join us as we Remember the Sky. Simply post a photo of the sky wherever in the world you are on September 11, 2024 — regardless of the weather. Then, share it on Instagram or the social media platform of your choice with a caption, tag us, and include the hashtags #neverforget911 and #rememberthesky.\n\nThis digital commemoration is inspired by the clear blue sky that was present in New York City and across the country on 9/11, as well as by Spencer Finch’s monumental art installation in the 9/11 Memorial Museum. His artwork, “Trying to Remember the Color of the Sky on That September Morning,” is comprised of 2,983 watercolors — each a unique shade of blue — a tribute to the enormity of collective loss and the individuality of each of those who were taken from us far too soon.\n\nFor younger Americans, 9/11 is no longer an experience lived but history learned. Remember the Sky seeks to engage audiences in meaningful conversation, serving as a bridge between memory of that day and what can be experienced in-person by visiting the Museum. Your participation helps us expose a new generation to the lessons learned during and following 9/11 as together, we fulfill our collective promise never to forget."
