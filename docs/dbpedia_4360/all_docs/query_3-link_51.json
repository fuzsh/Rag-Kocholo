        "text": "From: Sherman Alexie\n\nTo: Jess Walter\n\nSent: Thursday, June 20\n\nSubject: Twentieth Anniversary “Lone Ranger and Tonto”\n\nS.A.: So I’ve been trying to write the intro to the twentieth-anniversary edition, but it feels too self-congratulatory, so do you want to have an e-mail exchange about it and use that as the intro?\n\nJ.W.: “The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven” is twenty!?! Your e-mail sent me scurrying to my signed copy. I looked at the jacket photo and there you are, with the greatest “Breakfast Club” pro-wrestling warrior mullet of all time.\n\nS.A.: The rez mullet! I also find my former haircut amusing in stylistic terms. It’s embarrassing now. But there’s always been a conscious and subconscious classist / racist edge to mullet jokes, especially when it comes to white guys with mullets. If one means to tell a racist / classist joke then make it a good one, but I don’t actually think that many folks realize the cultural importance of the mullet in Native American-warrior history. Take a look at Chief Joseph.\n\nUnravel those braids, my friend, and you’ve got a legendary mullet, comparable to mine. The contemporary motto for the mullet wearer is “Business in front, party in the back,” but the Indian mullet-warrior motto was “I don’t want my hair to get in my eyes as I’m kicking your ass.” The Indian-mullet motto, coincidentally or not, is the same as the motto for hockey-mullet wearers. Somebody needs to do a study …\n\nLooking at my hair through a slightly more serious lens, I think I wore such an exaggerated mullet as a means of aggressively declaring my Indian identity. And my class identity. When “The Lone Ranger” was published, I was being fêted by the publishing world while I was back living on the rez, after college. I was called “one of the major lyric voices of our time” while I was sleeping in a U.S. Army surplus bed in the unfinished basement bedroom in my family’s government-built house.\n\nThe contrast between my literary life and my real life was epic. Scary. Even dangerous. And it felt epic, scary, and dangerous for many years.\n\nMy mullet was an insecurity shield. My mullet was an ethnic hatchet. My mullet was an arrow on fire.\n\nMy mullet said to the literary world, “Hello, you privileged prep-school assholes, I’m here to steal your thunder, lightning, and book sales.”\n\nJ.W.: Yes, undoubtedly: Chief Joseph’s business in front carries more power and meaning than say, Brian Bosworth’s. (My own unfortunate mullet included a braided rattail—just in case I wasn’t white trash enough.) And in your author photo from that time there is a fierce, steady engagement in your eyes that reflects exactly that quality in the book—you are drawn in by the humor, the sorrow, and the anger over injustice, the steady and unblinking cost of admission. I remember so clearly the reviews you were getting, and especially that phrase from the New York Times Book Review’s cover story on “The Business of Fancydancing”—“one of the major lyric voices of our time”—but I couldn’t have comprehended the pressure that such praise brings, especially the identity component of it, and so early in your writing life. To follow those reviews with a book like “Lone Ranger,” is, frankly, kind of fucking remarkable. The book won the PEN / Hemingway Award for best first fiction and garnered even more praise, but it must have felt like even more weight; every writer dreams of “stunning” and “dazzling,” but the Chicago Tribune writing, “The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is for the American Indian what Richard Wright’s Native Son was for the black American in 1940”—what does a twenty-six-year-old do with that?\n\nThe pressure of straddling two worlds comes through in “Lone Ranger.” In “A Good Story,” the gap is represented by the sweetest bit of postmodernist breaking of the fourth wall, in which you, the author, seem to be lying on the couch and your mother pleads with you to “write a story about something good.”\n\nAnother example of the disparate worlds you’ve suddenly found yourself straddling is one of my all-time-favorite stories, “The Trial of Thomas Builds-the-Fire,” which begins with a wonderfully apt epigraph from Kafka’s “The Trial”: “Someone must have been telling lies about Joseph K., for without having done anything wrong he was arrested one fine morning.” Your name, your boy’s name: Joseph. You almost seem to be staking out territory on the literary side of that divide, and having to defend yourself to both sides. That story also moves toward something I see in your work—a brotherhood in class, Thomas on the bus to prison with “four African men, one Chicano, and a white man from the smallest town in the state,” delivering them to “a new kind of reservation, barrio, ghetto, logging-town tin shack.”\n\nS.A.: And now I remember a New Yorker party early in my career, when I stepped out of a penthouse apartment elevator and saw Stephen King and Salman Rushdie hugging each other. What does a rez boy do with that visual information?\n\nOh boy, do I still feel like a class warrior in the literary world. In the whole world, really. These stories are drenched in poverty and helplessness.\n\nWe’ve talked about this a few times. I often make the joke that your trailer-park poverty makes my rez poverty look good.\n\nBut that’s an overlooked part of these stories, I think. I grew up in the tribe called the Rural Poor, as did you, and I don’t think folks think of us that way. I grew up in wheat fields. I grew up climbing to the tops of pine trees. I grew up angry and ready to punch a rich guy in the ear.\n\nSo, yeah, realism is my thing in this book. Autobiography, too. Not an autobiography of details but an autobiography of the soul.\n\nOne thing: I wrote this book in the middle of a decadelong effort to believe in God. So it’s curious to see the uncynical God hunger in the boy I was.\n\nJ.W.: Oh man! That’s a more high-powered hug than you and I hugging at the Los Angeles Times Book Festival, in 1996. I still remember, you said, “What are you doing here?” Then you introduced me to Helen Fielding, of all people. “This is Jess Walter, the second-best writer from Stevens County, Washington.” And we both laughed, because you and I knew that I was the only other writer from Stevens County, Washington.\n\nTo my shame now, I grew up embarrassed about being blue-collar, a first-generation college student, a nineteen-year-old father. We usually think of passing in terms of race, but people try to pass as another class, too. I did that.\n\nYou, however, seemed to know to claim class as a subject—that literature belongs to the poor shits, too. Your stories are sneaky that way: they confront readers on that level; there’s a quiet insistence that this world is as rich a literary world as London or New York, that Benjamin Lake can be as profound a place as Walden Pond, that Tshimakain Creek can have as much literary resonance as the Thames.\n\nBut place and class are only part of the story. Many people tell me that they had no picture of contemporary reservation life, or even urban Indian life, before reading “The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.” To break Indians out of museums and movies and Chief Wahoo—that’s a legacy for any book. “The Lone Ranger” and “Smoke Signals” gave many people their first picture of contemporary Native American life.\n\n“Autobiography of the soul” is a great phrase. I remember someone on the reservation telling me, back when I covered the Spokane Tribe and your book came up, “You know what that book seemed like to me? The news.”\n\nSo what do you make of people who have called your work magical realism? I wonder if there isn’t a cultural gap in that phrase, a whiff of colonialism. I’m a big García Márquez fan, and reading his autobiography is not so different from reading his fiction.\n\nS.A.: Describing my book as magical realism does make me feel like a witch doctor in blue jeans. I’ve got a friend who calls me Shaman Perplexy. I like that. Isn’t all fiction (and nonfiction) magical realism? Aren’t we all making shit up? And, if we do it well enough, it can feel surreal. Anyway, I’m not nearly as much of a magical realist as Flannery O’Connor.\n\nWhat is your favorite story in the book?\n\nJ.W.: What feels surreal to me are those stories of kids growing up on the Upper East Side, going to summer camp, then prep school, then choosing between Harvard and Yale … sci-fi.\n\n“Jesus Christ’s Half-Brother” is a huge story, dreamy and plaintive. I’m not surprised to hear that you were contemplating your faith as you worked on this book. I have a sentimental sweet spot for the stories about basketball, especially “Indian Education” and “The Only Traffic Signal on the Reservation Doesn’t Flash Red Anymore.” One of my favorite first lines is from “The First Annual All-Indian Horseshoe Pitch and Barbecue”: “Somebody forgot the charcoal; blame the BIA.” But I think the story that moved me the most at the time is “This Is What it Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona.” When I went back to that story, I was amazed that you accomplished all of that in sixteen pages. The story was a novel in my mind.\n\nRead Sherman Alexie’s Fiction and Poetry in The New Yorker\n\nAbove: Sherman Alexie, in his 1995 author photo for “Lone Ranger.” Photograph by Rex Rystedt/MPI/Getty."
