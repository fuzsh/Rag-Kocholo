        "text": "OK\n\nMathew and Jason\n\nhere with something that I wrote 2 years ago concerning my selection of the Skyranger.\n\nSince that time I have I have notched up over 200 hours and am absolutely thrilled with the aircraft.\n\nGood things about the Skyranger\n\n1..not too expensive a kit\n\n2..very easy and quick to build, You will have something recognisably an aircraft after a week of work.\n\n3..very easy to fly\n\n4..great short field performance\n\n5..OK on grass and rough fields\n\n6..can be tail dragger\n\n7..can have big wheels for rough fields.\n\n8..excellent visibility\n\n9..easiest aircraft with less than 10 seats to get in and out of\n\n10..good payload\n\n11..OK, if not fast cross country, mine has been South Port to Avalon and back and then Southport to Yarram.\n\nBecause it is very light it is a bit bouncy in turbulence, and as with all others of similar design is is rather draggy and hence not very fast.\n\nAn absolute delight to fly.\n\nbest wishes\n\nDavid Hill.\n\nBuying the right aircraft\n\na personal journey\n\nWhen we retired, the Spouse Person and I decided that in our future there would be an aeroplane.\n\nSo I prepared the check list of features that this aircraft would need. Over time this became a very long list. A list that included Australian manufacture, metal skin to lessen need for hangarage, factory built so that potential as school aircraft would increase its resale value, economical enough for spur of the moment flits around the block, long enough legs for serious touring, easy access for older bones and not seen as too claustrophobic for the Spouse PersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sensitivities.\n\nOver a couple of years the check list grew and grew while the decision seemed further and further away. At fly-ins I was the guy with the limp acquired from a surfeit of tyre kicking. Early on I decided against GRP aircraft for no other reason than rebellion against the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœeverybody has oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ phenomenon. If forced to justify that restriction IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d say that all the ones that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d seen within the ultralight class were too heavy to have a reasonable useful load. A criticism I suspect more justified of the regulation than of the aircraft. Although I did make one local manufacturer an offer that he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refuse. He promptly declined.\n\nThen we found the Foxbat!. Ticked all our boxes did the Foxbat. Spouse Person loved the visibility and swallowed the demonstration pilotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s line that a slow flight ability equated to safety and utility, hook line and sinker. There was room for all the essentials (hair drier, presents for the grandchildren etc) although the drinks trolley would require a substantial re design. To her mind the very best flying thing that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have 7*7 in its name.\n\nSo we ordered the Foxbat and celebrated when Peter Harlow wrote back with a delivery date and a build number. Then I took the numbers, the other numbers, to the accountant and explained to him my clever financing scheme. Ah the harsh implications of the various regulations governing taxation and superannuation. The verdict was yes my cunning funding scheme would work. Work that is until the auditors had a good look. Would still work after their assessment but in the process our super fund would lose its compliant status. Meaning that we would have our Foxbat alright but with a severely slashed retirement income stream within which to enjoy it.\n\nI wrote the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dear PeterÃ¢â‚¬Â letter, and Peter with courtesy, sympathy and understanding allocated our order to some other lucky pilot.\n\nBack to tyre kicking. At this point something strange happened:- I completely forgot about the check list and went about instead seeking something that looked like a Foxbat; a less expensive Foxbat.\n\nIn New Zealand I spied a Skyranger, went for a fly with owner Wayne and immediately fell in love with the aircraft. Back in Australia I contacted Jean-claude Smitka and negotiated to purchase sight unseen his demonstrator Skyranger VH ULS. By the time that friend Jim and I arrived in Yarram on our delivery flight from Southport I was 100% happy with the new purchase.\n\nNow about that checklist:- the Skyranger is not Australian, not metal, nor factory built. But it is the aircraft that struck the emotional chords for me. First I fell in love with it; a process that completely over rode my carefully prepared check list. Then I retrospectively built up a whole new check list that recorded the long list of positive features of the chosen one. Much the same way that I chose the Spouse Person.\n\nFortunately for me in both cases the post-decision list of positive features is extensive and in hindsight should have comprised the first list.\n\nExcellent visibility, predictable handling, great useful load, superbly matched engine and prop (same Kiev prop/912 combination as the Foxbat), very easy for stiff jointed folk to get in and out of , comfortable seats, practical 80kt tourer and cheerful/economical 60kt around-the-block sight seeing platform. Couple all that with very good short field performance and lowish purchase price and for what else would one ask?.\n\nWhen I heard about SkyrangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four gold medals in the World Microlight Championships and three major awards Sun Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn Fun I was reassured that others with better adhered-to checklists than mine have arrived at similar conclusions.\n\nI did not build mine. I know David Hill too well to be up there in the first aircraft that he ever built. The Skyranger however would be very hard to beat for ease, speed and economy of home construction. (They say that two people can have one flying in two weeks). All that with a price differential from the Foxbat that would allow me to pay cash for a dearer motor car than anything I have owned in the last 6 decades.\n\nULS is now 19-4397 and I hope cringes less now at my approach than during my first attempts, after a 15 year absence from 3 axis flying, to guide her through the air-ground interface .\n\nA couple of months ago I flew into Leadville Colorado in a Skyranger known to its builders as \"Gizmo\"\n\nthe aircraft performed falwlessly to 13,000 feet.\n\n.\n\nLeadville has the houour of being the highest registered airfield in the United States.\n\nWhat follows is a tale of the first time that Gizmo went to LEadville.\n\nThis was written by a good friend of the owner/builders, Rod Raleigh, in march of 06. At this point David the owner was still a student pilot.\n\nDavid says \" Rod spent quite a bit of time testing and training Dad, myself and the plane, since his first flight of \"Gizmo\" in Nov. 05.\n\nHe posted this letter to the Skyranger group, a few days after. There pics on the group site, called \"Gizmo\" goes to Leadville.\"\n\nA\n\nI've been a silent observer on this list for about 8 months now - I figure it's time to weigh in with my story.\n\nA little over 1 year ago, a dear friend of mine told me that he and his dad were going to build an airplane. Actually, it was his dad's idea; since he was approaching the octogenarian milestone of his life, Elton deemed it necessary to try something \"out-of-the ordinary\". Both men had some recent flight training, but neither had soloed, so they asked me if I would help them with the \"pilot perspective\" of the project. I readily agreed and thus began my introduction to the SkyRanger.\n\nDuring my first visit to their workshop (April 2005), father and son proudly displayed what looked like 1000 pieces of assorted aluminum tubing and a pile of cloth that reminded me of my grandmother's sewing room. I found myself concerned that I was expected to eventually take this collection of parts aloft and return with a report on how it flew - perhaps I had been a bit too eager to volunteer as test pilot. My worries soon vanished when I realized that this pile of \"airplane parts\" would take years to assemble into any such craft that might take flight, and by then I would be \"unavailable\"; or so I thought.\n\nThree weeks later, Dave called me and said, \"Hey, why don't you come down to the 'hangar' and sit in the plane. We want to make sure the seat is set right and the control stick falls in a comfortable position for you.\" I was flattered by the concern, but I couldn't imagine why they would waste time to mock up a cockpit for control position. (Dave works a full time job and only builds airplanes during evenings and weekends.) I obliged and made a date to visit. At this visit, I saw a very complete fuselage & empennage sitting on its gear with seats, floorboard, pedals and control stick mounted. \"Holy crap - these guys are AP's in disguise with a Boeing assembly line as backup! They might really pull this gig off - now what do I do?\"\n\nOver the next several months, I visited the \"hangar\" a few more times. Not so much as to help build the airplane, but to help build my confidence. I bounced in the seat, I twisted the framework, I thumped the fabric, I rocked the wings, I wiggled the ailerons, I ran the motor, I did what I could to find fault in this airplane, yet it escaped my search. Instead, I became more impressed with the SkyRanger's ruggedness and its airplane qualities - \"Did you see the size of those flaps? I know some 'real' planes that would like to have a set of those!\" I had grown fond of \"Gizmo\" and now found myself eager to fly the little bugger.\n\nOn November 7th, 2005, \"Gizmo\" took to the air. After a few adjustments to trim and rigging, I was flying hands off and enjoying the incredible view! In less than 8 months, a non-pilot, first-time-AC-builder, while-working-a-day-job, father-son team, built a SkyRanger. A rock solid aircraft that flew like any \"real\" airplane should fly.\n\nSince November, we have been occupied with the usual (and not so usual) flight-testing and proverbial \"tweaking\". It was the events of the past few weeks that moved me to write these accolades of the SkyRanger. Please note: I did not pick this airplane, it picked me; I therefore have no actions to justify.\n\n\"Gizmo\" is powered by a Rotax 912 (100hp) turning an IVO Medium 3 blade ground adjustable prop. It has a BRS emergency chute, the 20 gallon fuel tank, clear coat on all the fabric (top & bottom), full electrical with mode C transponder, ICOM panel mount transceiver, strobes, position and landing lights - it weighs in a tad heavy. I bring about 215 lbs to the equation - okay, I weigh in a tad heavy too. Our home field is 6,200 MSL.\n\nMarch 17, 2006 - After doing a few maximum performance take offs, I decided to explore \"Gizmo's\" service ceiling. OAT was 50 degrees F on the surface. While climbing through 7,000 MSL, the airspeed indicated 65 mph and 800 ft/min on theVSI. At 11,000MSL the VSI was registering 500 ft/min. By 15,000 MSL the climb rate had dwindled to 200 ft/min. The VSI was still indicating a positive 100 ft/min when I had to turn around at 17,700 MSL; I was fast approaching the boundaries of heaven, and you need God's permission to enter in. I took pictures of the altimeter - I didn't think anyone would believe me; after all, I was solo. The climb to 15,000ft. (from 7,000ft) took me just under 18 minutes - that works out to an average of 450 ft/min. For all practical purposes, 15,000 ft MSL will clear most everything we have in Colorado with safe margin. (Side note: I've tried the same stunt in my 230 HP \"Spam-can\" - I got bored hanging on the prop at 16,500 MSL and never went higher.)\n\nMarch 25, 2006 - Clear Colorado sky, wind calm, a great day for some dual cross-country. Elton and I load up the SkyRanger with 11 gallons of fuel, 445 lbs of organic material and head out! Pikes Peak is due west of our field, rising to 14,300 ft. We veer a few degrees north and level off at 10,500. Our destination, 83 miles distant, is Lake County Airport; just outside of Leadville Colorado. Immediately east of Leadville is a mountain ridge that reaches up to about 12,000 ft. Elton eases \"Gizmo\" up to 13,000ft. MSL to \"avoid leaving tracks in the snow\". We drop down into the valley and set up right traffic for RWY16. Lake County Airport holds the grand honor of being the highest airport in North America. At 9,927 ft.MSL, Lake County is not for the faint of heart. In the thin mountain air, the stick is full aft as the SkyRanger settles nicely onto the runway.\n\nThe ramp is vacant except for a covered 182 and a gleaming RV-4. We meet the pilot of the RV in the pilot lounge. \"What is that you're fly'n? A Kit Fox? An Avid?..A what? It's made where?\" \"You know, gettin' in here is the easy part, it's the leavin' that bites ya. You might have trouble gettin' out in that little plane this afternoon.\"\n\n(Does that smirk come with the RV kit or is it a special order item?)\n\nIf you ask, the nice folks at the FBO will present you with a \"Certificate of Pilotage\" just for visiting via an airborne vehicle. Elton handled his certificate at if it might break. He carefully stowed it away flat, so as not to mar it with a crease or wrinkle. The courtesy car was out of service so we headed back out to the ramp - tummies a grumbling.\n\nHeadwinds had hampered our westerly travel so we opted to add some 100LL before heading back. We back taxied on RWY16 to take advantage of its full length. If we couldn't fly out of ground effect, I wanted enough runway to land again and exercise plan \"B\". After run up, we deployed flaps and fire walled the throttle. Unbeknownst to us, a gallery of skeptics had gathered outside the FBO to watch our departure. No doubt they were eager to see us wallow down the runway, struggling for altitude. We waved as we passed the FBO - with 1/3 of the runway behind us, we were at 50ft AGL and climbing. ASOS announced density altitude at 10,900 yet we were climbing at 300 ft/min with 2 fat boys and ? fuel on board! By the end of the runway we were 200 ft AGL and still climbing. I had Elton lower the nose just so we could watch for traffic. I'm sure our grins were visible from the ground. For the rest of the trip home I sat in disbelief. I just couldn't believe how \"Gizmo\" launched off that high runway at near gross.\n\nThose of you that are flying SkyRangers know the outstanding performance these aircraft offer - my story only confirms what you already knew. Those of you that are straddling the fence, I urge you to fly a SkyRanger. My first impression of the SkyRanger was that it was a mediocre ultra light made for the flat lands; it had no real business in the high country. After riding \"Gizmo\" through the gauntlet, I have the utmost confidence in the capabilities and performance of the SkyRanger. I'd take it anywhere. I'll race an RV to 300 ft AGL any day of the week!\n\nThere are new challenging fields on my wish list to visit - places that I never would have considered before I met \"Gizmo\".\n\nIf you happen to be in the Rocky Mountain region, give Dave & Elton a call (719-661-3615), they'll set you up with an incredible ride in a SkyRanger.\n\nRod Raleigh\n\nSkyRanger convert"
