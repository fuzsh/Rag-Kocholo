        "text": "FREE SHIPPING *Shipped directly from manufacturer, only to 48 Contiguous USA states*\n\n**Order $25 or more of any DUBRO products and get 10% off all Laser Cut Kits!**\n\nWe're introducing the latest in Old School Model Works line of kits that you can not only build and fly successfully, but personalize them to your own taste. Old School Model Works is continuing to bring back great designs from the past and rework them to incorporate modern, laser-cut techniques to make kit building better than ever. All of Old School Model Works kits are made right here in the USA.\n\nThe Sky Ranger 40 is as much fun to build as it is to fly. Using updated design techniques and laser-cut precision, Old School Model Works designed this kit so most any modeler can successfully assemble it in a short amount of time.\n\nThis all-around sport model's retro design looks great in the air and makes you look like an ace pilot. Loop it, roll it, spin it, snap it, and just have a great time flying it.\n\nPower can be from either electric or glow. Old School Model Works designed the fuselage with a built-in hatch held in place with magnets so you have quick access to either your batteries or fuel tank.\n\nUtilizing the unique WEB-LOCK construction, you can build our wings, straight and true - with a minimum amount of fuss. We include sturdy, pre-bent main gear and wheel collars. The 3/16\" diameter wire can absorb quite a bit of abuse for those no-so-good landings.\n\nIncluded in each Old School Model Works kit are full-sized rolled plans, a printed construction manual, pre-bent main gear, hand-selected balsa and ply woods, and a premium hardware package from brand-name, USA manufacturers (DuBro®, Sonic-Tronics, and others) to guarantee the best quality. Also included is a clear, pre-formed plastic windscreen.\n\nWhat's more is you can cover and finish your Sky Ranger 40 like you want, rather than being stuck with a \"me-too\" offering that look exactly the same as the others at your local field.\n\nWhether you like gentle cruising, or prefer to tear up the sky, the Sky Ranger 40's wide flight envelope makes it a blast to fly!\n\nSpecifications:\n\nWingspan: 60 inches\n\nWing Area: 527 square inches\n\nLength (airframe only): 42.75 inches\n\nWeight: 3.5-4.5 pounds\n\nRadio:\n\n4 channel system\n\n2, 40-70 in./oz. servos for elevons and rudder;\n\n2, 40-70 in./oz. servos for ailerons;\n\n1, 40-70 in./oz. servo for throttle (if using a glow engine)\n\nPower:\n\nElectric: (minimum 800 watt motor, 80 amp ESC, 4-5S LiPo)\n\nGlow (.40-.45 engine, 6 ounce tank, fuel tubing)\n\nRecommended DU-BRO® Items to complete this fun kit:\n\n1- 500 - 36\" Lazer Rods\n\nFor ailerons\n\n1 - 801 - 2-56 Threaded Rods (12/ 305 MM) 6/PKG\n\n2 - 109 - 2-56 Spring Steel Clevis (threaded)\n\n2 - 112 - 2-56 Spring Steel Clevis (solder)\n\n1 - 350T Tires\n\nIf glow:\n\n1 additional - 109 - 2-56 Spring Steel Clevis (threaded)\n\n1 additional - 112 - 2-56 Spring Steel Clevis (solder)\n\n1 - 406 - 6 ounce fuel tank\n\n1 - 840 Fill-It Fuel System\n\n1 - 222 Super Blue Silicone (medium)\n\nAdditional Required Building Tools and Adhesives\n\n1 - 252 Nickel Plated T-Pins\n\n1 - PT-01 - ZAP 2oz (medium)\n\n1 - PT-08 - ZAP 1oz (thin)\n\n1 - 216 - Kwik-Hinge Slotter\n\nIf glow:\n\n1 - 785 - Tubing Bender\n\n1 - 666 - Kwik Start Glo Plug Igniter w/Charger\n\n1 - 696 - Exhaust Deflector"
