WUPA TV 69 calls itself "Atlanta's CW 69" and broadcasts entertainment programming in the Atlanta market. On weeknights the station airs "CW69 News at 10." WUPA is owned by CBS Broadcasting, a unit of CBS Entertainment Group which in turn is part of ViacomCBS.

CBS bought the station from BCG Communications on September 1, 1995 when it was called WVEU TV. BCG had owned the station since it was launched in 1981. CBS quickly sold the station to Paramount Pictures, which changed its call letters to WUPA. The station again became the property of CBS after Viacom bought both Paramount (in 1993) and CBS (in 2000).

This TV station is owned by CBS Entertainment Group.
