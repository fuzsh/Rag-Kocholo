        "text": "A year after Hulu launched its live-streaming pay-TV service, the biggest changes to the programming lineup have been on the local front.\n\nHulu with Live TV now provides 51 national cable channels and 593 local TV affiliates — all while maintaining the same $39.99 per month launch price (for now). The full lineups of national networks and locals on Hulu with Live TV are listed below.\n\nIn addition, regional sports networks from Comcast, NBC Sports and Fox Sports are available in many areas, as is NBCU’s New England regional news network NECN. Plus, Hulu customers have the option to add Showtime ($8.99/month), HBO (currently $4.99/month for 6 months, then $14.99/month) and Cinemax ($9.99/month). The Hulu with Live TV subscription also includes full access to the original and licensed VOD content, including the streamer’s breakout hit “The Handmaid’s Tale.”\n\nThe 593 total local affiliates now on Hulu’s live service (as of April 26) is an almost three-fold increase in the last eight months, up from about 200 in August 2017. According to Hulu, 51% of TV households in the U.S. now have access to ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC local stations. It also distributes 15 local affiliates of Spanish-language Telemundo broadcaster, which is owned by NBCU, and 12 MyNetworkTV affiliates (including WWOR in New York and KCOP in L.A.).\n\nNote that Hulu is owned by four major media conglomerates — Disney, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal and Time Warner — which obviously helped grease the wheels to clinch the deals with local TV affiliates.\n\nMeanwhile, even as Hulu has been bulking up on local TV, it still doesn’t offer channels from several big programming groups, including AMC Networks, Viacom, and Starz. It also excludes legacy Discovery channels but does have channels from Scripps Networks Interactive (which is now part of Discovery) like Food Network and HGTV.\n\nHulu hasn’t disclosed how many subscribers it has for the over-the-top live TV package. The company said it ended 2017 with more than 17 million paying subs, which includes both live TV and standalone subscription VOD (which starts at $7.99 per month). Hulu’s live TV service has been gaining traction as cord-cutters and other consumers seek cheaper and more flexible alternatives to traditional cable and satellite packages. Other players in the “virtual pay-TV” sector include YouTube TV, AT&T’s DirecTV Now, Dish’s Sling TV, Sony’s PlayStation Vue, and FuboTV.\n\nHere are the national cable networks currently in Hulu with Live TV:\n\nA&E\n\nAdult Swim\n\nBig Ten Network\n\nBoomerang\n\nBravo\n\nCartoon Network\n\nCBS Sports Network\n\nCheddar\n\nChiller\n\nCNN\n\nCNN International\n\nCNBC\n\nDisney Channel\n\nDisney XD\n\nDisney Junior\n\nE!\n\nESPN\n\nESPN2\n\nEPSNU\n\nESPNews\n\nESPN-SEC Network\n\nFood Network\n\nFox Business Network\n\nFox News Channel\n\nFox Sports 1\n\nFox Sports 2\n\nFreeform\n\nFX\n\nFXM\n\nFXX\n\nFYI\n\nGolf Channel\n\nHGTV\n\nHistory\n\nHLN\n\nLifetime Movie Network (LMN)\n\nNat Geo Wild\n\nNational Geographic\n\nNBCSN\n\nOxygen Network\n\nPOP\n\nSmithsonian\n\nSprout\n\nSyfy\n\nTBS\n\nTCM\n\nTNT\n\nTravel Channel\n\nTruTV\n\nUniversal Kids (East)\n\nViceland\n\nHere is the full list of local TV stations available in Hulu with Live TV:"
