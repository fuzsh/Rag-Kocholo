We could sent KIRO to the CW and KSTW to CBS and likely becoming CBS 11 and launch CBS News Seattle on the streaming service. Atlanta: We could see a swap of possible of WANF and WUPA before September 1st Because CBS owns WUPA, they could be switching to CBS instead of an independent station and WANF could end up with the CW unless WATL or WPCH could take over as a CW affiliate. Detroit: We are still waiting from a word from the sale of WADL to Mission and we haven't heard from them since May. If the sale reaches by September 1st, WADL could likely be a new CW affiliate. If the sale doesn't reach by September 1st, WMYD or a subchannel of WDIV could temporarily be carrying the CW until the sale of WADL is complete."
