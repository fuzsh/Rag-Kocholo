        "text": "The CW Network has expanded and extended its network affiliation agreement with Gray Television, which will see Gray continue carrying CW entertainment and sports programming on television stations in 55 markets, 42 of which are covered under the new agreement and 13 of which are covered by previous agreements. In addition, beginning September 2, Gray will launch The CW on WPCH-TV in Atlanta. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed (The CW). The extension comes as The CW is set to air 13 ACC football games this season along with 28 men’s basketball games and nine women’s basketball games. Atlanta-based WUPA-TV is \"dropping its CW affiliation\" tomorrow (ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION, 8/30).\n\nMeanwhile, The CW has named its panel for its debut season of “Inside the NFL.” Former NFLer Ryan Clark will serve as the program’s host and be joined by former NFLers Channing Crowder, Jay Cutler, Chad Johnson and Chris Long (The CW)."
