        "text": "The company (Weigel) that owns MeTV has purchased a TV station and also is building their own ATSC 3.0 antenna tower. It owns several OTA franchises such as MeTV, Heroes & Icons, etc. It appears that they want to consolidate all their broadcast channels to eventually use their own facilities rather than simply renting sub-channels from others.\n\nIt’s fun watching people like Robert Redford getting their start on shows such as Route 66 (there’s a young Jack Nicholson on an Andy Griffith episode). MASH was originally shot in 16:9 and is getting remastered and restored to 16:9 without artificial stretching. Some people have seen it and say it looks great! Our LG TVs do a good job of upscaling these old programs to look fresh.\n\nWeigel does issue their MeTV programs in 720 BUT they are broadcast as 480 on the sub-channels by different stations that allocate the sub-channel bandwidths. So we’re not seeing these programs as well as they can be shown. Perhaps that is also why Weigel wants their own broadcasting facilities. Perry Mason and Hawaii 5-0 look a lot better on CBS All Access than they do on MeTV as distributed by local stations. I think Weigel wants to improve how their programming is carried…\n\nHogan’s Heroes was originally filmed in 1080; I’ve seen it in 1080i and the picture quality is terrific."
