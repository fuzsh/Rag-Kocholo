        "text": "I don't think anyone who knows anything about the business would call the KRON situation a success. NBC ultimately came out the winner, as KNTV is a success, but everyone would have been a lot better off if Young had just gotten out of the way and let NBC buy KRON. KRON would have been able to keep its NBC identity and would have had continued success; Young wouldn't have been forced to sell WKBT (CBS) in LaCrosse, Wis. just to make the downpayment on KRON; and Young ultimately would not have had to sell KCAL in L.A. to CBS and WTVO (ABC) in Rockford, Ill. to Mission. The KRON fiasco has pretty much ruined Young and forced the company into bankruptcy. And due to KRON's lack of a major network affiliation (MyNet hardly counts) and low ratings, the station is worth only a fraction of what it was worth when Young bought it. In the battle of egos between Young and NBC, NBC won, but NBC had to literally pour millions into KNTV to make the San Jose-based station successful in San Francisco. If NBC had stayed on KRON, it would have been interesting to see what direction KNTV (which was Granite-owned at the time) would have taken.\n\nI don't really know how things are going for WJXT in Jacksonville. I would imagine, in hindsight, that Post-Newsweek wished it hadn't thrown away WJXT's CBS affiliation. The station can't be doing the numbers that it was as a CBS affiliate. I believe that not too long after WJXT dropped CBS, sister station WKMG in Orlando re-upped with CBS. That tells me that Post-Newsweek wasn't interested in throwing that away, as well.\n\nI've also read that KCET is really in bad shape since dropping PBS. It's one thing for a commercial station to drop a network and go indie. Although they may not be quite as popular and get the numbers that the network shows do, there is a glut of syndicated shows out there, and if the station has the resources, they can continue to do lots of local news and at least attract some audience with that. On the educational side (and I'm not an expert on PBS or educational TV, by any means), there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of compelling programming outside of PBS, at least enough to fill a full schedule.\n\nLet me run through a few of these and tell you whether they have succeeded or failed:\n\nKRON - massive failure. In fact, it is not going out on a limb to say this station has had the worst decline in value and ratings of any station in the history of American local television broadcasting. This station was sold for some ridiculous sum of money (I want to say it was nearly 800 million dollars) to Young Broadcasting. Their ratings fell apart after they lost their NBC affiliation. It's now valued at a tiny fraction of what Young bought it for. The My Network TV affiliation saves them some money, but certainly doesn't do much to bring in revenue. KRON has gone from being the top rated and top billing station in one of the top 5 markets to being a station that is near the bottom of the ratings and in such a bad financial situation that there has been concern by some on staff they might have to go dark. I think it has leveled out somewhat compared to a few years ago, but it's still in just awful shape.\n\nWJXT - okay, not great. Much better managed station than the KRON situation. It's lost some ratings to be sure, but it's still fairly competitive. They made the decision not to keep their network affiliation based on their concerns about the financial relationship they had with their network. It's unlikely another network is going to come back to them with an offer that would satisfy whatever financial concerns they had. Staying independent can work if done right. So far, they're okay... just not \"great!\"\n\nKTVK - probably the best success story of any independent in the country. They greatly expanded their local news after losing their network affiliation. The station has largely maintained their news ratings and are generally considered the highest rated independent in the country. They have embraced localism and are reaping the rewards."
