        "text": "Origin and launch\n\nOn October 2, 2007, the network announced that due to a joint decision between Time Warner and CBS Corporation – the parent companies of The CW – it would discontinue the Kids' WB programming block, due to the effects of children's advertising limits and competition from cable television, and sell the programming time to Grupo Clarin (through its subsidiary 4Kids Entertainment). Kids' WB ended its run on The CW on May 17, 2008 (Kids' WB, like The WB Television Network that the block originated, then relaunched as an online-only video on demand service). 4Kids Entertainment took over programming the block on May 24, 2008, premiering under the name The CW4Kids. In addition to programming the block, 4Kids also handled responsibilities for its content and advertising revenue.\n\nAt the time of the block's launch, 4Kids also programmed the competing 4Kids TV block for Fox, until that network nullified its time leasing agreement with 4KidsTV on December 27, 2008, due to a dispute between Fox and 4Kids involving 4Kids' failure to pay the network for its time lease, and the network's inability to maintain guaranteed clearances for the block, due to difficulties getting Fox affiliates and stations that would be used as default carriers of the block in markets where the Fox station did not carry 4Kids TV to air it. The CW4Kids was not renamed in order to avert confusion and due to contractual obligations to feature the CW name in some form within the block's title. 4Kids Entertainment's sister company Artear would later rebrand Canal Trece as El trece in January 2009.\n\nOn April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced a joint venture with Saban Capital Group and the rebranding of The CW4Kids under the new name Toonzai, a name change that took effect on August 14, 2010.\n\nTakeover by Saban Brands and end of Toonzai\n\nOn June 26, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, finalized a bid to acquire 4Kids' agreement with The CW for the block. On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, began programming the block, which would be relaunched under the name Vortexx. Toonzai quietly ended its run on The CW on August 18, 2012 after a Yu-Gi-Oh! marathon, with Vortexx premiering the following week on August 25, 2012. Some of Toonzai's programming, including Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, Sonic X and Dragon Ball Z Kai continued to air on the block until September 27, 2014, when Vortexx ended its run.\n\nProgramming differences\n\nIn most markets, CW affiliates used the network's recommended Saturday morning scheduling for the block – though some such as CW owned-and-operated station Atlanta, Georgia's WUPA-TV, aired it on Sunday, instead due to regular Saturday programming. Connecticut affiliate WCCT-TV aired three hours on Saturday, and two hours on Sunday. KMAX-TV in Sacramento, California aired the entire lineup, but it had a four-hour tape delay, running from 11:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. WLFL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina and WNUV-TV in Baltimore, Maryland, aired the entire lineup, but it had two hours earlier, running from 5:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. San Diego's XETV-TV, aired three hours from 5:00 a.m. - 8:00 a.m. and two hours from 10:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.San Antonio's KMYS, which affiliated with The CW in 2010, aired it on Sunday and Monday before 5:00 a.m. Other stations preempted portions of the block; Shreveport, Louisiana's KPXJ-TV preempted the final hour of the block. Columbus, Georgia's WLTZ-DT2 preempted the first half-hour of the block.\n\nWhile The CW recommended that its affiliates carry the The CW4Kids/Toonzai block at 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Saturday mornings (regardless of time zone), its secondary CW Plus national feed for smaller markets aired the Toonzai block an hour earlier on its broadcast and cable-only affiliates in the Central, Mountain and Alaska time zones, as The CW Plus operates two separate feeds running on Eastern and Pacific time zone schedules.\n\nFormer programming\n\nThe CW4Kids\n\nEon Kid † (May 24, 2008 – June 14, 2008)\n\nJohnny Test † (May 24, 2008 – June 14, 2008)\n\nWorld of Quest † (May 24, 2008 – June 14, 2008)\n\nTom and Jerry Tales † (May 24, 2008 – September 6, 2008)\n\nMagi-Nation † ‡ (May 24, 2008 – September 20, 2008)\n\nThe Spectacular Spider-Man † (May 24, 2008 – January 31, 2009)\n\nWill and Dewitt † (May 24, 2008 – April 4, 2009)\n\nSkunk Fu! † (May 24, 2008 – October 18, 2008; May 29, 2010 – July 10, 2010)\n\nThe Batman † (June 21, 2008 – August 2, 2008)\n\nYu-Gi-Oh!
