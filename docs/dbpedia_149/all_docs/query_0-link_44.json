The Scanning found them, but when I tune to them nothing comes in. The WB channel has a signal or 100+, UPN has a signal of 70-80. I never had any problems with these channels on L188.\n\n2.) About 50% of the time when I tune to my other OTA channels, the channel is squished to the left 25% of the screen. It is really weird. Some time I can change to a non-OTA channel and get the screen back and some time I can not leave that channel. (Even when I power down, the channel still plays. The power light goes out but the squished channel still plays.\n\nBoot Version: 150B\n\nFlash Version: F053\n\nSW version: L211HEED-N\n\nP.S.

You said \"squished\", does that mean that a person looks taller and skinnier than normal like an anamorphic squease, or is the image simply cropped? Is it possible to show us a picture of this problem?\n\nG\n\n#6 ·\n\nI cannot add my analog OTA stations, WB KXVO 15 and FOX KPTM 42.\n\nAfter getting 211, I deleted all OTAs, digital and analog. I scanned in DTVs and they tuned. I then scan in analogs. They show on the Local Channels screen (menu 6-8) but will not tune. I deleted all channels, scanned in OTA analog and they won't tune. I deleted them, added the analog channels again one at a time and they won't tune in. As I sit now, I can't view any OTA analog channels, period.\n\nI had done a reboot after clearing the channels, then tried it again with no luck.\n\nBoot 150B\n\nFlash F053\n\nSW L211HEED-N\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n30 posts ·\n\n#7 ·\n\nMark Lamutt said:\n\nmichaelL - you really have to tell us where you are, and what channels won't tune.

You said \"squished\", does that mean that a person looks taller and skinnier than normal like an anamorphic squease, or is the image simply cropped? Is it possible to show us a picture of this problem?\n\nLike a anamorphic squeeze. After a more test I have found that every time I got the squeezed video is after I tried to tune to the two channels above.\n\nAlso, I tried removing and readding 022-01 and 028-01 from the \"local channels\". They are now working. I have not seen the squeezed video since. Hopefully that fixed the problem.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n82 posts ·\n\n#8 ·\n\ngpflepsen said:\n\nI cannot add my analog OTA stations... any suggestions?\n\nYou might want to find the switch that makes the OTA channels map on the guide - not close to the 921 atm and can not remember the the menu setting - to see if that makes a difference.

Thanks.\n\n14 posts ·\n\n#10 ·\n\nNot a problematic bug, but, I live in the Denver area (Littleton), the PBS channel KBDI 12, digital 38 that used to be remapped to 12 is no longer remapped, it now shows up as channel 38 with the call sign \"Rf38\". The other OTA locals re-mapped in correctly with the correct call signs. At least it works, it's very important to have PBS kids on 038-02 for the little one in the house.\n\n2143 posts ·\n\n#11 ·\n\nI'm very pleased that L211 fixed the OTA issue where I couldn't get KRCR digital 34. I get the main channel and the subchannel. Neither channel have any guide data listed in the display banner, browse banner or within the guide. KRCR still has no PSIP and this may be the reason for not having the data. In the display banner directly under 34-01 is, \"Rf34.\" The only data information displayed is, \"Local Programming.\"\n\n02-22-05 Tuesday, KRCR TV digital channel now is transmitting PSIP and their channel is remapped to 07-01 and 07-02. No CC yet and the EPG now contains program information! Now lets see how the DVR timers work?\n\n264 posts ·\n\n#12 ·\n\nNot sure if this is common knowledge or not. After loading the software and rebooting, all my local OTA digital channels were working great, and my dish locals had remapped to their correct numbers. However when scrolling through the channel browser, I was able to scroll down but once I got to a local dish channel (Channel 8 for example) I could not scroll back up, only down. Going into the local channel set up and deleting all my local analog channels solved the problem.\n\n564 posts ·\n\n#13 ·\n\nWell, I went through the usual scanning process. My spiffy new signal strength meter confirms I'm getting 78%, but still a black screen on KCOP (it's a UPN affiliate) .\n\nOTA channel 13 analog/channel 66 digital.\n\nhttp://www.upn13.com/\n\nSeverity for me is minor.\n\n80 posts ·\n\n#14 ·\n\nI'm in Buffalo, New York. All my OTA locals get remapped except for channel 2 which is NBC. It's call letters are WGRZ (www.wgrz.com) and the digital channel is located on channel 33. The identical thing happened with L188. I was hoping it would get fixed with L211 but I guess not. So is it a PSIP thing or something else?\n\nThe channel comes in clear and strong but since the 921 doesn't know it's NBC I don't get guide data for it. Can we just tell the 921 that this OTA channel is NBC like I used to for my 5000 receiver?\n\nEverything else so far is working fine.\n\nHere's some more info about the station:\n\nWGRZ-TV\n\n259 Delaware Ave.\n\nBuffalo, NY 14202\n\n716/849-2222\n\nThanks for listening,\n\nLenny\n\n39 posts ·\n\n#15 ·\n\nSkates said:\n\nWell, I went through the usual scanning process.

Major changes in remapping with L211 - I can now add them to favorites.

Do you actually mean the digital sub-channel (4:3 aspect ratio) like 02, -03 etc.?\n\n121 posts ·\n\n#18 ·\n\nHi,\n\nI can no longer add KNTVDT broadcast 49 assigned 48-2 (paired with Telemundo).\n\nIt worked fine before the upgrade, but now I can't add it. I try to manually add it, signal locks, but doesn't get aquired.\n\nAlso can't get KRCB boardcast 23 assigned 22-1.

I know someone else posted something that said they had to try it a couple times.\n\nI'll try doing it again.\n\nLenny\n\n33 posts ·\n\n#20 ·\n\nKATV 22 (ABC) and KLRT 30 (FOX), both in Little Rock, did not show up after I deleted my OTA digitals and re-scanned. I rescanned twice, but nothing. Adding manually, signal strengths were 95 and 120 respectively, so I have no idea what the problem could have been -- trying to find the sat guide info for mapping, maybe? KATV had PSIP problems that prevented recording OTA in 188, but KLRT was always a rock.\n\nIronically the scan did find KARK 32 (NBC) which is a weak-ass SD-only signal, typically 60-65 for me even though they broadcast from the same mountain as KLRT. (The station is a local embarrassment to HD buffs 'round here...)\n\n3127 posts ·\n\n#21 ·\n\nThe Seattle PBS affiliate (KCTS) has 4 digital subchannels. Rather than show up as 009-0X KCTS, 2 of them show up as 041-01 R141 (41 is their assigned frequency), another shows up as 041-02 R141. The first has program information and is channel 009-01. The second does not and should be 009-05 judging from program content.\n\n40 posts ·\n\n#22 ·\n\nSamich said:\n\nNot a problematic bug, but, I live in the Denver area (Littleton), the PBS channel KBDI 12, digital 38 that used to be remapped to 12 is no longer remapped, it now shows up as channel 38 with the call sign \"Rf38\".

In my area OTA HD channel 036-01 (WJYS 36) would show up on a scan, but when selected for viewing was a black screen with no sound. Now with L211, this channel appears in the Guide as 036-01 Rf36.\n\n40 posts ·\n\n#23 ·\n\nboylehome said:\n\nI was under the impression that analog channels could not be recorded with the 921 digital DVR. Do you actually mean the digital sub-channel (4:3 aspect ratio) like 02, -03 etc.?\n\nNo, I notice that the 921 uses one of the SAT tuners to record the non-OTA HD channel (remapped local). The remapped local must be remapped from the SAT provided local channel.\n\n726 posts ·\n\n#24 ·\n\nRescanned all DTV stations. It found them all. But there seems to be a possibly new multipath rejection problem with L211...\n\nI have been able to tune all Atlanta DTV channels since L188 - no breakups, solid picture on both of my 921s.\n\nWith L211 now we can't watch WAGA (17), WUPA (43), WPXA (51), and WATL (25). Lots of breakups and \"acquiring signal\" screens. No rain, clear night, no wind. No reason except for L211.\n\nI do have quite a bit of multipath but L188 was solid, no issues and I checked each station before the machines were rebooted to start the install of L211.\n\nAlso PSIP remapping issues on WPXA (should remap to 14.X) and isn't.\n\n111 posts ·\n\n#25 ·\n\nsampatterson said:\n\nRescanned all DTV stations.

It shows lock with varying signal, but doesn't get added.\n\nI'm checking more and fiddling with the antenna before getting too exercised about it.\n\nJohn"
