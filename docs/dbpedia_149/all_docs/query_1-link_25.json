It’s Wednesday, January 12, 2005, and this is your first early morning briefing.\n\nThe part 2 premiere of Fox’s 24 drew a 5.0/12 A18-49 on Monday night in final ratings from Nielsen Media Research. M18-49 chimed in stronger with a 5.5/14 for the 2-hour premiere evening. Fox won both hours in those key demos over a tie between NBC’s Fear Factor and ABC‘s premiere of EMHE: How’d They Do That?, both pulling a 4.2/11. For its first four hours, 24 has averaged a 5.5/13 A18-49 over two nights, up 38% vs. the first four hours of last season (4.0/10). ABC’s 2-hour premiere of The Bachelorette pulled a decent 4.3/10 A18-49, with higher marks in the women demo: 6.0/13 W18-49, 6.5/15 W18-34.

The LA storyline revolves around an elite undercover crime unit targeting the city’s most wanted criminals.\n\nABC has ordered up three new pilots: Laws of Chance (Roundtable Entertainment) is about a clever Houston based female assistant district attorney going up against good-ol’ boy defense attorneys.

TV and Shaun Cassidy) finds strange things happening in a small Florida town in the days following a massive hurricane. Little green men have not been ruled out.\n\nCurrently in development at Comedy Central is an improv comedy from Matt Ballard, Chris Crockett and David Wain called Teach’s Lounge.\n\nCABLEready and St.Paul based independent producer Bosch Media will develop a new reality series called House of Babies which centers on the lives and drama of the students in a midwifery educational facility. Viewers will follow the stories of the parents who have chosen midwifery as a birthing option, and the midwives and students. Bosch Media will produce 13 half-hour episodes of the series.\n\nLast Sunday VH1 enjoyed an evening of premieres beginning with the fourth season of The Surreal Life at 9pm, earning a 1.6 A18-49 rating and 2.25 million viewers 2+.

The list is ranked by viewer’s ability to recall the new ads and their associated products and brands. The Recall Score is the percentage of TV viewers who within 24 hours are able to remember the brand of the ad they saw during normal TV viewing. The scores are then indexed against the mean score for all ads during the time period to create the Recall Index; 100 is Average. For example, with a Recall Index of 237, the top-ranked Subway spot was more than twice as memorable as the average new ad during the period.

PBS will include a biological warfare panel discussion as part of the film’s surrounding programming.\n\nThe Raoul Peck-written and directed Sometimes in April tells the tales of the 1994 genocidal violence in Rwanda starring Idris Elba and Debra Winger. It will premiere on HBO in March followed by PBS in April.\n\nIn Yesterday, a young mother in African deals with AIDS.\n\nThe only movie requiring serious re-editing for PBS is Dirty War with a scene showing those exposed to the biological agent are forced to shed their clothes (editing more to avoid possible FCC issues rather than its “racy” content according to HBO chairman Chris Albrecht). This agreement between the two networks will make these films available to a wider array of television audiences. PBS is creating panel discussions centering on each individual film’s core theme. In yesteryears, HBO has screened some of its original films in theaters before airing them on TV (usually as a run for the Academy Awards) but has never aired them on free TV before.\n\nFox Sports World, the soccer channel, will officially change its name to Fox Soccer Channel, at the stroke of midnight, Monday, February 7. Sister network, Fox Sports will offer a sneak peek at the channel during the Super Bowl Pre-Game Show, Sunday, February 6, 2p.
