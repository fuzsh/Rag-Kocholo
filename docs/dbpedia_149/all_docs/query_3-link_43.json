I have contacted WPBA engineering to have them take a look. WUPA could be a PSIP issue as well.\n\nMy HR20 has a problem with WATL (36-1).

Last night, sometime after 10B went national, I noticed WUPA was mapped to 69-1 and I had no picture. I reran the antenna setup and WUPA was remapped to 43-1 and the picture returned. For me, WATL 36-1 displays live with no problems. I have the same issue you have with WPBA, however, on my Samsung TV, WPBA OTA is mapped to 23-1 not 30-1 and and the TV's display shows it as a 1080i signal but with no program info., and nothing is in HD. I sure hope GPTV goes digital soon as I've read Public Broadcasting has a lot of great looking HD content.\n\njdeaton said:\n\nI originally got 10B with the second Santa release and after running the initial antenna setup WUPA (The CW) was mapped to 43-1 and coming in fine.

I sure hope GPTV goes digital soon as I've read Public Broadcasting has a lot of great looking HD content.\n\nIt sounds like both WUPA and WPBA have some PSIP issues. I don't know what to think about WATL, although I never watch that channel anyway. As far as HDTV from WPBA, don't count on it any time soon. I got an email yesterday from WPBA (I sent an email asking them to check their PSIP data) that indicated they have to purchase and install a 'digital master control system' before they can resume broadcasting HDTV. The email did not give a time line on when that would happen, only that it would be done before the Jan 2009 digital conversion deadline.\n\nI think WUPA's PSIP is fine. However, they are not remapping to 69-1. I spoke to one of their engineers who said that since Ch69 is no longer going to be in the UHF spectrum after the DTV conversion they opted to move to 43-1. If you notice, their name or logos don't have the 69 anymore. I think that may be where DTV is screwing up.\n\nAnd my WUPA issues started after the national rollout also, though I think that was just a coincidence. I can no longer tune 43-1...it tells me channel not available. I did try redoing the antenna setup and still get 69-1 but no 43-1.\n\nStrange because I get a great signal on the meter on 69-1.\n\nI am having trouble with WUPA too (but I haven't tried to watch since setting up OTA last weekend). CBS (46-1) is also giving me fits. I suspect my issue are due to the fact that I am dead in the center of CBS, ABC, NBC, TBS and FOX towers, and within 1-2 miles of each, so my antenna can't pick them all up at once.\n\nAnd I am having difficulty with the PBS station (30-1) as well.\n\nI have a question that is somewhat related...I live in N.Fulton area and would like to get a suggestion on which antenna I should buy to get the OTA channels in HD...also is there an antenna that connects around my current 5LNB dish? I would prefer that over having to have a new antenna take up more space on my roof\n\nAlso, where is the best place to shop locally for it? How much should I expect to pay for it? Will it get all of the local atlanta channels? Will it get any distant channels?\n\nThanks\n\ntkrandall said:\n\nnovice question here, sorry.\n\nWhat do you mean by 43-1, 69-1, etc? I am aware that digital tv can multichannel, and that the digital broadcasts are on temporary frequency assignments at this time (as long as analog is alive), but that is about all I know at this point.\n\nFor example, for WSB channel 2, how are analog and digital channels mapped in this way?\n\nLets take channel 2 as an example. WSB's analog signal (going away in 2009) is broadcast on VHF 2. Their digital signal is broadcast on 39, and it can contain more than 1 a/v stream (subchannels). Via. PSIP (mapping and program data in the digital the stream) the set top box is told to display 39-1 as 2-1 to the user.\n\ndervari said:\n\nI just bought a DTV2BUHF and it works great. I have it in a 2nd floor window pointing SW and can pick up everything on my TV's tuner. If only DTV can get the 30-1 and 69-1 mappings correct.....\n\ndervari, how far are you from the towers? I am in town (in Morningside/Va Hi). Curious as to whether the antenna you have would work for us.\n\ngreenwave said:\n\ndervari, how far are you from the towers? I am in town (in Morningside/Va Hi). Curious as to whether the antenna you have would work for us.\n\nI'm in the Northlake area, a few hundred yards behind the Hollywood 24 theater on the 85N access road. I point SW and get all the major stations. It may be a little tougher for you since you're right under the antenna farms.\n\ndervari said:\n\nI think WUPA's PSIP is fine.

We all have 10B yet our Atlanta area HR-20's are behaving differently. I'm currently watching WUPA on 43-1, and whan I check the signal meter, 69-1 is not even listed. I wonder if changing to the Newnan zip code, 30265 prior to rerunning antenna set up would enable you to tune WUPA on 43-1. I'm pretty sure I won't be rerunning antenna setup any time soon for fear of loosing WUPA OTA. I kind of feel like that 3 leged dog named Lucky.\n\nJust another data point: I too am having problems with 30-1 and 43-1. They both appear in my guide, but no picture on either. However if I go to the Antenna Setup and check the signal meter, both are in the 90's. 43-1 works fine if I use the OTA tuner in my TV.\n\nI do not have any problems watching or recording 36-1.\n\nWeird. I wish WPBA would get their act together. Nova is nice in HD.\n\ntsbrady1 said:\n\nrjc, I live in Sugar Hill and have a CM 4228 in my attic with a CM 7777 amp and get everything but 46 which comes and goes, I think they use WWII surplus equipment. I believe FRY's sells them and they are around 50$, I don't remeber how much the 7777 was\n\nI live in Stockbridge & last summer I led my daughter on a rather unseccessful search to Fry's (that is one LOOONG drive from Henry County) three separate times to get the elusive, red-breasted CM 4228. I finally gave up & jsut bought whatever CM they had in my local Lowe's. I too, have had & continue to have problems with CBS."
