I don't know how the American public collectively divined it's atrociousness before it aired, but it apparently contains terrible acting, awkward cut-scenes, and either really easily remedied plot points or ones that are glossed over for a nonsensical reason.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by RainMaker\n\nAm I the only one who likes Suits?

Psych, White Collar, Burn Notice and Suits are must-sees for me every week.\n\nI think it's pretty much in-line with the USA formula -- smart, funny self-contained episodes with easy-to-pick-up short story arcs and one broader arc that gets brushed periodically until the occasional meltdown.\n\nThe USA show that doesn't come across as a USA show for me is Necessary Roughness. I slogged my way through season one but season two just got too much for me to take Callie Thorne really grates on my nerves. If they had swapped her and Sarah Shahi from Fairly Legally I'd probably have liked both shows better.\n\nCovert Affairs was really good to start but seemed to lose some of its charm in season 3.\n\nkcchief hits it for me, with the exception that I think (despite my love of Bruce Campbell) Burn Notice lost it, or rather reiterated it, around 2-3 seasons ago - although I will be 100% back on board if they start making fun of CSI again.

White Collar has done a little better job developing supporting characters, but is kind of at a crossroads, and needs a shakeup if they're going to continue on.\n\nSuits has done the best at creating a world around the two main characters, to the point my only real complaint is why they keep trying to force the Mike/Rachel like each other, but can't be together because of X scenario... but like all USA shows it's based on a premise (Michael wants to find who burned him, Sean is a fake psychic, we don't know if Neal wants to go straight or set up for a bigger score, Mike? didn't go to Harvard Law) that's fun, but can only really hold up for a season or two before it loses any suspense.\n\nLast edited by BishopMVP : 02-02-2013 at 04:10 AM.\n\nPro Starter\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2000\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by BishopMVP\n\nkcchief hits it for me, with the exception that I think (despite my love of Bruce Campbell) Burn Notice lost it, or rather reiterated it, around 2-3 seasons ago - although I will be 100% back on board if they start making fun of CSI again.

I'm sure they thought it was artistic to put Michael through a trauma, cross a line then go on the run while fighting with his friends and family. But it really cut into the heart of the show where you know who you're rooting for and eventually things work out. This season wasn't funny, had no heart and was grueling to get through.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by BishopMVP\n\nPsych is another show that really hasn't progressed plot-wise past season 2 or so, but I think the chemistry between the two main characters is genuine enough it can carry the show through dull patches.

The chemistry of the cast is so terrific that the show is still funny and engaging, but I would like to see some jazzier plots. There are a couple of episodes of this new season I'm really looking forward to, especially the \"Clue\" episode. I'm not a big fan of the current Neal's father plotline, but White Collar is solid.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by RainMaker\n\nWhat I mean by a USA show is that they all tend to give off a campy sort of feel to them. Royal Pains being a good example. I just feel like Suits would fit in just fine on AMC or a Premium Channel.\n\nI'm not digging the Mike/Rachel stuff either, but I do like the scenes she is in regardless of what she's doing.\n\nThat makes sense. I think it's hard to be quirky on the Big Four broadcast networks. Even White Collar has its quirks.\n\nI've been an advocate for a long time that if NBC were smart, it would use its cable nets as a farm system to develop cheap, engaging shows, and if they prove to be worthy promote to the broadcast network and reward them with a budget. When you factor in reairings, The top 5 shows on USA would all beat the the average show on NBC. So move Suits to NBC, and let USA try to develop the next show. What's the worst that could happen? Suits could possibly do worse than Do No Harm did -- it's already beating it from cable.\n\nUSA has a lot of hot, underrated B-list female characters.

I don't think it was marketed at all, or done properly (for some reason, I think it was a re-run), but it seems like that was their attempt at it and they'll use that as a reason not to ever do it again.\n\nI definitely agree with you on the latter part, and clearly I'm not the only one - Fairly Legal on USA - Front Office Football Central\n\nPro Starter\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2000\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO\n\nIt's been tried, but very half-assed. ABC developed Monk but never ran first-run episodes before kicking the show to USA, which they owned at the time. During Monk's first season they were airing episodes a week or two after they aired. The tried the same setup again a few years later.\n\nNBC pulled the stunt a couple of times, again airing old episodes. They reran episodes of Psych for a couple of weeks in March a few years ago, then in the summer aired reruns of Psych, Sci-Fi's Battlestar Galactica and Bravo's Project Runway.\n\nRegardless, airing old episodes in the summer or burning them off on a Saturday night is hardly a try out. I'd be interested in seeing what Covert Affairs or Suits might do on NBC with the right promotion and time slot.\n\nPro Starter\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2000\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO\n\nCouple of tidbits for the ratings junkies like myself ...\n\nQuote:\n\nIn week 19 of the broadcast television season ending Sunday, February 3, 2013, CBS came in first place among adults 18-49 with a 8.9 rating average. FOX came in second with a 2.2. ABC was third with a 1.4. NBC was fourth with a 1.2. The CW finished last with a 0.6 adults 18-49 rating average. CBS won the week with total viewers, with 27.997 million viewers, ahead of second place FOX with 6.233 million viewers. ABC was third with 4.661 million. NBC was fourth with 3.8550 million followed by the CW with 1.606 million.\n\nIf you ever wonder why networks spend a bundle on the NFL, here's why. The Super Bowl alone is enough to boost CBS's average primetime 18-49 number by about .25 of a point for the entire season. That's tens of millions in ad revenue alone.\n\nOn the other end of the football spectrum, NBC has completed their first-to-worst transition now that SNF is done. I still don't know why there was so much hoopla over NBC's fall numbers since it was evident from the math that there demo numbers were entirely boosted by the NFL. Still some mid-season shuffling going on but February sweeps should give us indication of where everyone is.\n\nAnother note ... Smash absolutely tanked on its return, delivering a 1.1 in the demo. The Betty White birthday special was its lead-in, so you could dismiss it as a bad matchup. But it didn't even keep that audience, so hard to say what will happen when Go On/New Normal are the lead-in. NBC is in sad shape.\n\nLast edited by kcchief19 : 02-06-2013 at 03:19 PM.\n\nPro Starter\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2000\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by stevew\n\nDo No Harm pulled from the schedule. And Christina Applegate quits Up All Night. Go On and the New Normal posting series lows. NBC looking good in regular season.\n\nDo No Harm was impressive -- it posted a 0.7 in the demo. They don't go head to head, but Do No Harm barely edged out Beauty and the Beast on the CW. Suits on USA pulverized it.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Ryan S\n\nI think that \"The Voice\" was the biggest factor in NBC's Monday and Tuesday fall ratings.\n\nNo doubt that was a big factor as well. I just thought it was noteworthy that if you removed SNF from the equation, NBC's 18-49 number in the fall was worse than their number last year, although everyone seemed to think that NBC had made a recovery.\n\nThe Voice covered up a lot of problems. Early returns so far suggest that Revolution and Go On/New Normal benefited from The Voice lead ins. I know The Voice is coming back this spring, and I'm assuming it's returning to Monday/Tuesday. That will stem some of the bleeding, but now they have a gaping hole on Thursdays to fill.\n\nPro Starter\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2005\n\nLocation: Appleton, WI\n\nI am a little bummed about Do No Harm, thought it was an interesting concept and Steven Pasquale was doing a pretty good job, IMO. Oh well...\n\nNot all that surprised about Up All Night, although that one does bum me out. My wife and I really enjoyed that show and as soon as they announced the whole format switch, I knew it was the kiss of death. Not at all surprised that Applegate wanted out.\n\nWe also finally got to watching The Americans - VERY much enjoying it thus far. Didn't think I would like Keri Russell as much as I do, but she is doing a bang-up job alongside Matthew Rhys.\n\nPro Starter\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2000\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO\n\nThe NBC cratering continues ...\n\nNBC To Finish 5th In Sweeps For First Time; Network Falls Behind Univision - Yahoo! TV\n\nNot a huge surprise because Univision has beaten a network for a month before and has had some very strong single-night showings as well. But to hand it to NBC during a sweeps month when NBC is trying ... ouch. Have to wonder what kind of effect this performance will have on the affiliates -- could be another mini-revolt in the making.\n\nCommunity dropped big in its second week back, so the glimmer of renewal hope offered by the premiere's rating is pretty much gone. Haven't seen tonight's episode, but the first two just weren't the same as the first three seasons. The magic is gone.\n\nThe Americans has been renewed for season two.

I thought about this thread when the overnight's for Atlanta showed up in my inbox this morning.\n\n8p Community -- 1.2 HH rtg ... that's 7th among broadcast networks, trailing not only the big three but also Ind. WPCH (1.6 Meet The Browns syndication) and UPN WUPA (2.0 Vampire Diaries) and Ind. WATL (1.2 White Collar syndication)\n\n830p Parks & Rec -- 0.9 HH rtg ... 7th among broadcast ... trailing Ind WPCH (House of Payne syn) and the 2nd half of shows on WUPA & WATL\n\n9p Parks & Rec -- 0.9 HH rtg ... 7th among broadcast ... behind the big three as well as another ep of Meet the Browns syn. , another ep of White Collar syn. and Beauty & the Beast.\n\n930p 1600 Penn -- 0.5 HH rtg ... 7th among broadcast, behind more Payne and the 2nd half of the other shows\n\n10p L&O SVU -- 1.7 HH rtg for the hour ... 4th among broadcast as it edged out WPCH Seinfeld syn (1.4), WUPA HIMYM (0.5) and WATL (0.2) local news*/30 Rock syn combo.\n\nAlso 1135p Leno beat everything in NBC prime with a 1.8 HH, and the first half of 1235a Fallon beat the whole 830p-10p block with a 1.0 (finished with a 0.8 for the entire hour).\n\n*Somewhat ironically considering the discussion here, the local NBC affiliate produces a 10p newscast for indy WATL.\n\nAlso noting here that I used HH rtg for the comparison but the primary demo A18-49 ratings were even lower for every NBC show except the 9p Parks & Rec\n\n__________________\n\n\"I lit another cigarette.

They can bitch but I don't know that the network really gives a big crap beyond being annoyed.\n\nI'd agree that network switches aren't as likely as they once were due to the larger affiliate groups and cross ownership. But a high-performing local NBC affiliate could still angle to improve their network if the Fox, ABC or CBS affiliate in their market is ailing.\n\nThe greater threat is dumping worthless network programming for better performing syndicated or cheaper local programming. If you're losing money on news because NBC primetime is sucking you need to make that money elsewhere. Maybe you do that by dumping the third or fourth hours of Today and going with local news. Maybe you push Fallon back an hour and load in your reruns of The Big Bang Theory and 2 1/2 Men. Since NBC doesn't even try on Fridays and Saturdays, maybe you dump that for local sports or a movie. That helps you but hurts NBC.\n\nOur NBC local affiliate here has been known to preempt primetime reruns for local news specials.\n\nPro Starter\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2000\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by JonInMiddleGA\n\nMost of the markets I'm seeing at the moment are getting more out of Today II & III than their midday locals (I know it was just an example, I just happen to kinda notice that this week).\n\nThe catch is that in the right situation you can make more money with a cheap local or syndi show than a network show. In my radio days, I worked for a station owner who had also owned the ABC affiliate in town and was notorious for dumping network primetime reruns for old movies and such. The reason was that even if the ratings were lower, he got 100% of the ad revenue instead of 30-50%.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by JonInMiddleGA\n\nAnd unless they already own them, those syndi strips probably aren't going to outperform Fallon (who isn't awful really, ratings wise).\n\nI'm not picking on Fallon, just acknowledging that you might make more money as a local airing programming where you get more revenue than you do for network programming. You might get better ratings with Leno, an hour of strong comedies, then Fallon rather than airing the comedies after Fallon.\n\nKC has two examples of this working. The ABC affiliate still bumps Kimmel to an hour after the late local news following 2 1/2 Men and Big Bang Theory. They've used this strategy for a couple of decades now, going back to when MASH and later Seinfeld filled those slots. They still perform so well that they refused pressure from ABC to bump the comedy slot when Kimmel moved to 11:30. I haven't seen Kimmel's clearance number, so I wonder if he's suffering from not having the same clearance percentage Nightline had.\n\nThe CBS affiliate here bumps Ferguson a half hour for Insider. Not sure how it impacts their ratings, but I know it helps the bottom line. Even $500 extra a night adds up over a year.\n\nPro Starter\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2000\n\nLocation: Kansas City, MO\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Radii\n\nI'm torn between wanting it cancelled and holding out hope that they find a way to change it and make it better. For now its off my DVR, I'll keep reading reviews in hopes that it turns around, but I wouldn't expect it during this 13 episode run, only if it gets extended and they get to learn from how bad this is and try to do something totally different with these characters.\n\nThis came up last week in the Community thread too, but I'm siding more with it being cancelled. At this point I continue to watch because I'm invested in the show and the characters, but I feel like I'm being ripped off. Cancelling the show would save me time and emotional pain.\n\nThe only option I see to save the show is get it off NBC. Comedy Central already owns the syndication, so they have a financial investment in saving the show. Maybe they pick it up ala Futurama. Maybe it's worthy of a Netflix investment. Pick up the show, can the new producers and bring Dan Harman back. Only way to save the show.\n\nOtherwise, kill it.\n\nHall Of Famer\n\nJoin Date: Nov 2000\n\nLocation: Behind Enemy Lines in Athens, GA\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by kcchief19\n\nI'm not picking on Fallon, just acknowledging that you might make more money as a local airing programming where you get more revenue than you do for network programming.\n\nTrust me, I'm not defending Fallon\n\nQuote:\n\n... following 2 1/2 Men and Big Bang Theory.

Just not sure the math is there if you have to buy 'em for that purpose. That was probably my train of thought since the affiliate in Atlanta doesn't really have anything useful like that to speak of (their syndi lineup includes mostly 2nd tier talkers and Jeopardy ... which I suspect they'd be cautious about doubling up since it could hurt ratings on the first airing)\n\n__________________\n\n\"I lit another cigarette.

That ranked 69th in the demo and 83rd among viewers for all shows that season. Those numbers this year would make it a top 25 who in the demo and a top 40 show among viewers.\n\nThat said, if Leno were back in prime today his numbers would be worse as well. Probably a lot worse since his lead-ins would be even more awful.\n\nI think we should start a thread to come up with ideas on how to save NBC."
