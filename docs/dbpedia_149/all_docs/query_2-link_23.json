Isn't WUPA a CBS/Viacom O&O?\n\nThat's hard to explain, given that the ratings are inserted by the program producer, not the station. The syndicated programs should arrive at WUPA with the rating already present.\n\nI don't see a rating on every program. I might not expect them on old programs, produced before the ratings existed or on infomercials.\n\nTo the best of my recollection the rating is voluntary.\n\nThey could be having some FCC issues soon, if their programming is not. Unfortunately, the affiliate (which is actually run out of Norfolk, VA) is at the mercies of the distributor. CW is responsible for rating their network programming, and the syndicators are responsible for rating theirs.\n\nPlus, didn't the rules change about two years ago? The old rule was that the TV rating had to air at the top and bottom of the hour, if an hour+ long program, and at the beginning of the program for half-hour programs. But, I thought the new rule was that every segment is supposed to lead with the ratings bug. Anybody got the correct info?\n\nFloydB said:\n\nThey could be having some FCC issues soon, if their programming is not.

You practically see just about every TV station and cable channel playing ball with the TV ratings system.\n\nAs for the rules regarding the display of ratings, it practically varies by station, in terms of icon size and frequency. It seems, though, that the cable channels have an iron-clad plan of ratings decorum, with an icon after every break, and a huge icon at the start of each show (which they almost taken after ABC).\n\nazumanga said:\n\nw9wi said:\n\nThe rating is voluntary.\n\nBut is it \"voluntary\", as truly voluntary; or \"voluntary\" as Emergency Broadcasting System \"voluntary\"?

The only real mandatory part is that all TV sets aold in the US must have V-Chips. From my understanding, the guidelines on how they are displayed are \"federal guidelines\", meaning voluntary.\n\nEverybody treats them as mandatory out of fear that it will become mandatory.\n\nWPCH overrides the small distributor-installed bugs on the syndicated version of \"Family Guy\" with the bigger Turner ones. You can clearly see it. (TBS and Cartoon Network/Adult Swim airs the network version without distributer installed ratings, but with just the huge Turner version).\n\nIndividual TV stations do not have the resources to rate each episode of each program they air."
