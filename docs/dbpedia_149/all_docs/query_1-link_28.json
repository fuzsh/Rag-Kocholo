        "text": "Well, here it is, 20 years ago today, December 11, 1994, was the day television changed forever in 3 television markets. WJBK was a CBS affiliate in Detroit and formerly owned by New World Communications (same for sister stations WITI in Milwaukee & WAGA in Atlanta). Fox took a 20% stake in New World, as a result of outbidding CBS for its NFC football package which led to WJBK, (along with WITI and WAGA) dumping CBS for Fox. CBS on the other hand was forced to find new affiliates in those markets:\n\nHere in Detroit, CBS approached Scripps-owned ABC station WXYZ and Post-Newsweek-owned NBC station WDIV for an affiliation. The two stations turned the offer down, same with former independent station WXON (later WDWB, now WMYD) and former Fox affiliate WKBD, However Viacom turned that offer down because it wanted to launch the United Paramount Network (in which WKBD became an charter affiliate on January 16, 1995). CBS was left with the other independent stations, WADL and WGPR. CBS broke off the negotiations with WADL due its owner (Adell Broadcasting) making unreasonable demands, although it is not known what those demands were. So by default, CBS went with WGPR (which later purchased the station in 1995 and renaming the station WWJ-TV.)\n\nIn Atlanta, CBS approached with Cox-owned ABC station WSB-TV, Gannett-owned NBC station WXIA-TV, and former Fox affiliate WATL, none of them was interested. CBS almost purchased then-independent station WVEU (now WUPA), but then they affiliated with then-independent WGNX 46 instead (formerly owned by Tribune, which was slated to become a charter station of The WB; that station is now WGCL-TV).\n\nIn Milwaukee, CBS scrambled to find a new home in the market, so they approached Journal-owned NBC station WTMJ, Hearst-owned ABC station WISN (which was affiliated with CBS from 1961-1977), then-independent WVTV (which was a CBS station as WXIX from 1955-1959), and again from 1960-1981. Like the Detroit and Atlanta scenarios, no station was interested. This left CBS to negotiate with WJJA (now WMLW) and Weigel Broadcasting-owned WDJT, along with religious station WVCY. The negotiations between WJJA and WDJT fell through and CBS considered purchasing WVCY before its ownership group decided not sell. So out of desperation, CBS agreed to affiliate with WDJT.\n\n20 years later, those CBS stations whom they replaced are having trouble ratingswise, Meredith-owned WGCL keeps changing back an forth between the \"CBS 46\" and \"CBS Atlanta\" monikers until they finally adopted the \"CBS 46\" name (for the third time) this year. WDJT was the weaker CBS affiliate for years after the switch, but is faring better with its syndicated schedule and its being competitive in primetime due to CBS's higher ratings. WWJ-TV didn't start a news department after the switch until April 2001 when they launched an 11pm newscast produced by WKBD. The newscast was dropped in 2002 after WKBD shut down its department to allow WXYZ to produce its newscasts, which ended in 2004. As a result, WWJ-TV airs syndicated programming in those time slots. In 2008, WWJ-TV started airing weather reports, which was later accompanied by a morning program with emphasis on weather and traffic, plus news reports by Detroit Free Press in 2009. In 2012, the show was cancelled due to low ratings.\n\nSo there it is, the changes that shook the television landscape in those television markets. So what would it be like had the Fox-New World alliance had not happened? Would these stations (WJBK, WITI, or WAGA) be better off as CBS O&O's? I would like to hear your reaction and sorry for the long posting.\n\nYou forgot the other big casualty. ABC in St. Louis.\n\nKTVI was one of ABC's best performing affiliates in the nation. It still does decent with Fox especially with having the Rams and to a smaller extent, the Cardinals.\n\nKDNL on the other hand is pretty much the opposite. Even with ABC News performing well in the ratings, it barely makes a dent here in St. Louis. Even GMA barely registers in the ratings. Having no local newscast doesn't help and considering that the best KDNL can come up with is a talk show hosted by a right-wing talk show host, I don't think ABC has much of a future here in St. Louis and that ABC's presence in St. Louis was the biggest casualty of the Fox-New World deal even more so than Detroit and Atlanta.\n\nAs far as your original question. Its really hard to say because each of these markets has an NFC team which really helps boost the ratings for these stations. For example, Packers football is a hard thing for a station like WITI to turn down even with a CBS affiliation in exchange."
