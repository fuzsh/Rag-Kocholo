These particulars are extremely similar to last week's in terms of duration, number of occurrences, and even general timeframe.

Lots of pixelation during movements, fast or slow it didn't matter. CBS 42 in Birmingham was the same way during football yesterday.\n\ntimmac\n\n· AllStar\n\nJoined Jul 26, 2007\n\n·\n\n70 Posts\n\nSame problems here. It wasn't even worth watching. It's starting to get annoying. I started watching Animal Planet while there was a football game on, and thats just wrong!\n\nrpjones68\n\n· Legend\n\nJoined Feb 5, 2007\n\n·\n\n109 Posts\n\nAtlHDTV said:\n\nI've had issues all day with the D* reception of WXIA.

WXIA seems to be the worst. When I watch my record of Las Vegas from Friday, we'll see if it was there too.\n\ncoit\n\n· Legend\n\nJoined Feb 13, 2007\n\n·\n\n204 Posts\n\nOn a different note, I went up on Sunday nite at about 11:30 PM or so, and my DirecTivo was showing \"no signal on Satellite 1\" or whatever when I tried to tune the Atlanta locals. This occured on 2 / 11 / 46. I checked the national channels, and they were fine.\n\nI went to check on another TV, but by then, the locals were back on. Maybe by 11:35 or so.\n\nAnyone else see this?\n\nK4SMX\n\n· Hall Of Fame\n\nJoined May 19, 2007\n\n·\n\n3,433 Posts\n\nSince this seems to be the central reporting point for D* ATL HD local problems, I can add that I was experiencing quite a few momentary audio drop outs on WAGA Fox Ch. 5 last night during \"Cane\" (10-11 pm EDST). No pixelization, however. Couldn't compare with the OTA, because I have some kind of problem up here 110 miles NNE with the Ch. 27 RF signal only.\n\nthekochs\n\n· DirecTV 10yr+ Customer\n\nJoined Oct 7, 2006\n\n·\n\n1,010 Posts\n\nI'm here in Atlanta watching NBC local HD football and bad breakups at beginning of game.

WXIA has been terrible for several weeks. I only watch SNF, Earl and The Office, and I get significant bouts of pixelization on all shows. Desperate Housewives on ABC has been very spotty as well. My wife is starting to really get annoyed with my decision to leave Comcast. Does anyone get an answer from DirecTV as to why this is happening? All I ever get is \"reset the receiver\". Frankly, I'm done with doing that as it has not worked once.\n\nmhking\n\n· Legend\n\nJoined Oct 28, 2002\n\n·\n\n584 Posts\n\nmarkgriffith said:\n\nAnother Atlanta resident complaining of the same issue.
