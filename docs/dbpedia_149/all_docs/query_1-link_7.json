        "text": "With less than a few weeks remaining, the WB Network will soon be a thing of the past, as well as UPN. Yet, you posters have said that Kid's WB programming will continue on the CW Network. Question is, will stations across the nation still carry the 8a.m.-Noon block of programming from Kid's WB? I have doubt the (now) former UPN station WUPA-TV Channel 69 (CW Atlanta/ Charter Cable 9) will not, given that surprise when it dropped the Fox Box (Now 4 Kids TV) just after me and my family moved here to Atlanta two years ago.\n\nI'm curious myself as to how my local affiliates will handle the kids blocks, and also the whole WB thing in general.\n\nWhat I mean is, my WB affiliate starts showing My Network stuff on the 5th, yet the last day of the WB is the 17th - so who's gonna' be showing that last night of the WB? Will UPN end early and the UPN-becoming-CW affiliate show the last night of WB? Anybody else know how their area is handling that?\n\nI also have no idea who'll air what kids' network in my area. There's a good chance that our UPN-turned-CW affiliate will pass on airing Kids' WB, which'll likely keep both KWB and 4K!DS TV on our WB-turned-MY affiliate.\n\nAs others said, Kids WB will stay intact on whatever station in your area is carrying the CW--- branding, stupid CGI-WB-studio-lot stuff, annoying talking socks, and all.\n\nSince My Network TV starts on September 5, and the UPN/WB contracts don't end until another week or so afterwards, stations carrying My Network shows will also air the rest of their contractually-obligated UPN/WB stuff in some miscellaneous timeslot (late at night, etc.) until the contract is up.\n\n>>\n\nI also have no idea who'll air what kids' network in my area. There's a good chance that our UPN-turned-CW affiliate will pass on airing Kids' WB, which'll likely keep both KWB and 4K!DS TV on our WB-turned-MY affiliate.\n\nWikipedia has a list of stations carrying CW and My Network programming...just look for the stations in your area.\n\nbeta said:\n\nTribune stations are sure to continue carrying Kids' WB! (such as here in New York), but that's really rotten luck that the CW ended up going to the former UPN in your neck of the woods. I remember having watched the Fox Box on Channel 69, but we moved out, quite seemingly, just as you moved in... in 2004.\n\nWUPA is a CBS O&O in Atlanta, so that's why they're getting CW. I think they'll be carrying Kids WB along with it, even though they dropped Fox Box before, which was also dropped by WATL before, who is going to be the My Network TV affiliate.\n\nThePeterNetwork said:\n\nI think there should just be the three networks airing what they used to air. That way there is a greater variety of programming on with independent syndicates. These whole Fox networks and WB/UPN stations have obliterated broadcast television as we know it with their onslaught of bad programming.\n\nFox has been considered to be the modern day breakthrough in terms of television, and their shows have made it the #3 network most of the time now (they passed NBC a couple of years ago and are close to #2, but Lost and Desperate Housewives are keeping ABC typically at #2). I agree that UPN and the WB have lowered the standard, but by combining those two networks, I feel they've done a great thing that will make television watchable again. I know personally I'll be spliting my time between CBS and CW. The only thing I might watch on NBC is Friday Night Lights and possibly Deal or No Deal, and I only care for Lost on ABC. Fox only began going down in terms of programming when they went to mostly reality programming.\n\nWhile I doubt I'll watch much of Kids' WB! on the CW this year, I'm personally glad to know that my local CW affiliate will be carrying it, and I do plan on watching Legion of Superheroes and maybe The Batman on it.\n\nI do find the clicker on WB shows couting down their change to the CW now to be hillarious, but at the same time I'm actually getting to see the promos for fall shows now, so it also makes me happy.\n\nbigddan11 said:\n\nI agree that UPN and the WB have lowered the standard, but by combining those two networks, I feel they've done a great thing that will make television watchable again.\n\nAnd, just what have they done? Mixed typical WB programming with the typical UPN primetime fare? That hardly merits congratulations. It just means... one less channel pitted against another (who's honestly going to commit to watching My Network TV?).\n\nlivingfruitvirus said:\n\nWUPA is a CBS O&O in Atlanta, so that's why they're getting CW.

I wasn't quite living in the metro area at the time, but I do recall seeing a televised ad while I was in a hotel.\n\nbeta said:\n\nHmm... didn't WATL carry Fox Kids (on Sunday mornings) at a time?

Right now 4Kids TV has no home in Atlanta, and since WAGA, WATL, and WUPA all tried out the various incarnations of Fox's kids programming, I don't think anyone will be picking it up anytime soon.\n\nbeta said:\n\nAnd, just what have they done?

Also, when I look at their line-up, it is probably the most well rounded line-up out of all the networks, and it is the lone network that seems to have something for everyone in the family, just as the early networks did.\n\nbigddan11 said:\n\nBy combining the two networks together, they've almost doubled their number of viewers which will put them right next to NBC in terms of current viewrship totals.
