Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. (ET).\n\nWUPA-TV can be found on 810 on Comcast, 1069 on U-Verse, 709 on Charter, 69 on DirecTV and 6376 on DISH TV.\n\nKennesaw State enters the game 5-1 overall and 1-0 in the Big South Conference, while Liberty is 3-4 and 0-2 in conference play. The Flames are defending conference champions and advanced to the second round of the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) playoffs a year ago.\n\nThe Owls made history last week when they defeated Gardner-Webb, 12-7, at Fifth Third Bank Stadium to become the first newcomer to win its Big South Conference debut.\n\nFans not in the greater Atlanta area can watch the game on ESPN3.com or listen to live at KSUOwls.com. Brian Giffin, Tutan Reyes and Art Eckman will describe the action.\n\nFifth Third Bank is the Official Bank of Kennesaw State Athletics. Fifth Third Bank Stadium is the home of women's soccer, women's lacrosse and football.\n\nKeep up with Kennesaw State Athletics by following KSU on Twitter @KSUOwlNation and or by liking Kennesaw State Owls on Facebook.
