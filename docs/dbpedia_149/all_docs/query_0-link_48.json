Martin Luther King Jr. in honor of the civil rights icon’s birthday. Gov. Nathan Deal, House Speaker David Ralston, Secretary of State Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed invoked King’s message of justice and equality. Deal presented a proclamation to Christine King Farris, King’s only living sibling. “Dr. King gave his life for a cause that provided dignity and opportunity for mil- lions of men, women and children, not only in his day, but in ours,” Deal told the crowd gathered at the Capitol not far from where a portrait of the 1965 Nobel Peace Prize winner hangs. “Almost half a century after his death, our nation continues to measure King’s work and his impact on the world. The passing of time has served only to illustrate the greatness of this man.” King’s actual birthday is Jan. 15. The Georgia native, who was born in Atlanta, would have been 83 years old. Thursday’s ceremony was the 27th annual Martin Luther King Jr. holiday tribute at the Capitol. Reed reminded the audience that many of King’s colleagues in the civil rights movement can be found not in history books, but around town. “Those who stood on the front lines of freedom are still among us,” Reed said. “That’s something Atlantans take for granted.” Kemp said King’s efforts affected poli- Kelleyto attend movie premiere in <strong>LaGrange</strong> “It’s always good to come home” Andrea Lovejoy Contributing editor The last few weeks have been a whirlwind for <strong>LaGrange</strong> native and Hollywood star Elijah Kelley, whose latest movie, “Red Tails,” opens Jan. 20 in theaters nationwide. The 24-year-old Troup High graduate, who made a splash in the 2007 hit “Hairspray,” has been criss-crossing the country for screenings of the action-packed film based on the heroic World War II exploits of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first African-American aerial combat unit. The movie, named for the distinctive “red tails” on the Tuskegee pilots’ planes, was financed and produced by George Lucas, creator of the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” films. In recent days, Kelley has been hugged by Oprah Winfrey at a gala screening in Dallas, hosted by famed producer Tyler Perry at a post-screening party in Atlanta and hailed by director Anthony Hemingway (“Treme,” “The Wire,” “Battlestar Galactica”) at Tuesday’s world premiere in New York City. He’s heard Alabama coach Nick Saban credit a private screening of the movie with inspiring the Crimson Tide’s dominating national championship victory over LSU. And he awoke Thursday to multiple phone messages telling him to get ready to head to Washington, D.C. for a White House screening of the movie for President Obama and the first family. So where does Kelley plan to be when the movie officially opens? Right here in his hometown of <strong>LaGrange</strong>. “It’s always good to come home,” Kelley said in a Thursday afternoon phone interview from New York. “I’m excited about it and hoping a lot of people will come out.” Kelley will be at the Legacy Museum and Troup County Archives on Jan. 20 at 4 p.m. for a reception to unveil an exhibit on the Tuskegee Airmen. The “meet and greet” event is free and open to the public. About 5 or 5:30 p.m., Kelley will cross Main Street to greet fans and NEW YORK (AP) — About 1.9 million homes entered the foreclosure process in 2011, the lowest level since 2007 when the recession began, according to a report Thursday by the foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac Inc. The firm cautioned that the decline does not necessarily indicate that the housing market is getting better, as many foreclosures have been delayed due to confusion over documentation and legal issues involved in the process. There have also been problems with the way some lenders were handling foreclosures. sign autographs at Carmike Cinemas 10, where multiple showings of the movie will be offered, beginning in late afternoon. He’s expected to shuttle between the movie house and the museum, which will stay open until 9 p.m. to accommodate exhibit viewing and give fans a chance to meet Kelley. Local events are being coordinated by Shanitra Ransom, executive director of the Elijah Kelley Foundation, which provides scholarships and other assistance to local students. Ransom saw the movie in December at a private screening in Atlanta, followed by a party at Perry’s mansion. The 300 guests included former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and music superstar Ludacris. “It was absolutely phenomenal,” Ransom said. “It’s Elijah’s biggest role yet, and he’s very good in it.” Kelley portrays Samuel “Joker” George, a fictional character based on one of the Tuskegee-trained pilots. The ensemble cast is headlined by Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. and Oscar nominee Terrance Howard. The hometown premiere of “Red Tails” has been planned with less fan- Specifically, signing off on home foreclosures without first verifying documents — a practice referred to as “robo-signing.” Many of the nation’s largest banks reacted by temporarily ceasing all foreclosures, re-filing previously filed foreclosure cases and revisiting pending cases to prevent errors. “Foreclosures were in full delay mode in 2011, resulting in a dramatic drop in foreclosure activity for the year,” RealtyTrac CEO Brandon Moore said in a statement. The listing firm anticipates that 2012’s foreclosure rate will be higher than last year’s, but -Elijah Kelley <strong>LaGrange</strong> native and actor See MOVIE | 3 2011’s foreclosure rate lowest since 2007 will remain below the peak of 2010. High unemployment, a sluggish housing market and falling home values remain major factors in homeowners falling behind on their mortgage payments. Many borrowers also have simply stopped paying their mortgage because they owe more on the mortgage than the home is worth. RealtyTrac said that 2011’s foreclosure activity is 34 percent lower than 2010 and the lowest since 2007. The Great Recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.

Other states among those with the highest foreclosure rates for the year were Georgia, Michigan, Florida, Illinois, Colorado and Idaho. The company said that December’s foreclosure filings on 205,024 homes were the lowest monthly total since November 2007. The figure was also 20 percent below the prioryear period’s results. In the fourth quarter, there were foreclosure filings for 586,133 homes in the U.S., down 27 percent from a year earlier. tics, but also “transcended the day-to-day issues in the political arena.” “The efforts of Dr. King, his associates and followers to shine a light on racist and unconstitutional laws were certainly significant and lasting feats, particularly in the face of entrenched hate and violence,” Kemp said. “I’m equally thankful for the opportunities we all have to work together, break bread together, laugh and cry together and pray together, thanks to our late fellow Georgian, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.” Willie Fuller was a <strong>LaGrange</strong> resident and one of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the first black military aerial unit that gained notoriety in World War II and helped defy racial barriers. <strong>LaGrange</strong> native Elijah Kelley plays an Airman in the upcoming movie ‘Red Tails,’ tying in the legacy of Fuller and <strong>LaGrange</strong> to the famed unit. WillieFuller, <strong>LaGrange</strong>’s Tuskegeeairman Andrea Lovejoy Contributing editor The opening of the new movie, “Red Tails,” is focusing renewed attention on the Tuskegee Airmen, the black military aviators who overcame barriers to perform heroically in World War II. <strong>LaGrange</strong>’s own Tuskegee Airman is being recognized in a new exhibit which opens Friday at Legacy Museum and Troup County Archives at 115 Main St. The public is invited to a reception at 4 p.m. with “Red Tails” star and <strong>LaGrange</strong> native Elijah Kelley attending. Here, as researched and written by Troup County historian, Clark Johnson, is Fuller’s story. Willie Howell Fuller, Troup County’s original connection to the Tuskegee Airmen, was born in Tarboro, N.C., in 1919. He enrolled in Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, where he received his B. S. in Mechanical Industries and Science. Pearl Annual meal to feed 250 Monday Matt Chambers Staff writer For the 12th year in a row, a meal will be provided to home-bound, disabled residents during the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day dinner. The dinner will be held Monday at St. James C.M.E. Church, said Jake Sessions, who organizes the dinner with Robert Darden. “What we do is use the leftover food from Christmas dinner to feed people,” Sessions said. “We can’t keep these turkeys for the whole year.” Darden said volunteers are welcomed at the event, which will be from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. “We started it together about 12 years ago,” Darden said. “It’s on a smaller scale,” than the other annual meals, he said. 483504 See FULLER | 3 See MEAL | 3"
