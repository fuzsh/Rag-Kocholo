        "text": "Anyone else with Hulu Live notice our game isn’t listed in the live menu at 6:30 p.m.? Hope that’s just a scheduling mistake.\n\nThis is probably not going to work, but with HULU streaming there is a tap for The CW. This only shows movies and other shows, and no live television. However, at the top there is a menu that shows Home-Shows-Movies-LIV Golf Live. I clicked on the LIV Golf Live button which is showing golf. At the top of that page it reads CW Sports Live. I believe this golf thingy is being shown on Peachtree TV at the same time. I'm going to give this a shot at 6:30. It probably won't work.\n\nPeachtree TV is ööööing bush league for not having a livestream version of their channel. I can't even watch this öööö with my parents' Comcast login. What ööööing year am I in, 2003?\n\nI feel the pain. No live streams have it apparently. I have signed into multiple accounts where it's on, but not on Live Stream. Complete Bullshit! Typical ACC öööö."
