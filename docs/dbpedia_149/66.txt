Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Detroit are currently without Kids WB. Their CW stations (ours being WUPA) have not yet opted to pick up the programming. Keep in mind that WUPA dropped the Fox Box back in the day.

I've tried to contact WATL's (former WB) owner, Gannett Broadcasting, about it. No response.

So Atlanta, the home of Cartoon Network, has no affiliate that airs either Kids' WB or 4KidsTV? You know what I say to that?

Suspicioooooooous!

WPSG, the Philly CW station, apparently has opted to show paid programming during that time. It was previously the UPN station and as such never showed KidsWB. Actually from looking at their schedule, they are only CW during primetime, the rest of the time they are local programming.

The former WPHL WB station is now a MyNetworkTV affiliate and now shows DIC programming instead of KidsWB.

I've tried writing to the email address provided for WPSG, but the page still lists it as part of the Viacom Television Stations Group. I'm not even sure if the email address is still correct.

CBS Television Atlanta just said that they'll be airing Kids WB on WUPA on Sundays from 7 AM to noon.

Assuming you live in Atlanta and are responding to my post, WUPA IS the CW. So they're keeping it, but on tape delay.

WPSG finally said they won't be airing Kids WB, so Philly is officially screwed.

Aw, crap. Now this just cements my opinion of them as a lousy-and-proud station. Grr.

So, if WPSG CW 57 in Philadelphia shuts out Kids WB, does this give Philadelphia FOX station WTXF 29 with its Saturday 4 Kids TV lineup a big advantage, unless Philly cable systems get NYC CW affiliate WPIX 11?

That's strange because KidsWB is showing up in multiple TV listing services as showing on WPSG on Sept 23. WPSG's own schedule still shows them as showing infomercials though.

Did they give any reason for not airing it?

Even with them showing infomercials now in that time slot, you'd think that they could get more advertising money with airing programs people would actually watch.

Update: Here's an article from yesterday (mirrored on WPSG's own website) about WPSG that mentions the Kids WB. While it doesn't say whether or not the Kids WB will air on WPSG specifically, it heavily implies that it will by saying it will air on the CW. If it won't air on WPSG, then this is one of the most misleading articles I've ever read.

Yeah. And Titan TV shows infomercials too. Some say they're not, some are now, so maybe there's hope.

I got an email response from WPSG

The Kids WB will be moving over to us next Saturday 9/23 - look for it at 7am. thanks-CWPhilly57

So assuming they aren't lying in the email, it looks like Philly will get the Kids WB.

I got the same response from them this afternoon, so hopefully it is on the level.
