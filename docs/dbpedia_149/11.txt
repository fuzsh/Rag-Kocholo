WUPA, channel 69, is a television station in Atlanta, Georgia. An owned and operated station of the former United Paramount Network, it identified itself as "UPN 69". It was owned by Viacom Corporation. Founded November 10, 1980, the station is broadcast locally in high-definition on channel 43 (virtual channel 69.1). Originally atop the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, Atlanta's tallest building at the time, it now transmits from another site further east. WUPA broadcasts from its studios located in unincorporated DeKalb County on the frontage road of Interstate 85.

History[]

The affiliation with UPN ushered in a new era for WUPA. With a stronger signal and the syndicated shows acquired from WGNX, it became a factor in the Atlanta ratings for the first time ever. The station would surpass WATL and even WTBS' ratings. For most of UPN's run, WUPA was the network's fourth strongest station.

The station returned to CBS hands when CBS merged with Viacom in 2000. However, the station remained affiliated with UPN (due to WGNX/WGCL having higher ratings and a better channel position than WUPA). In 2006, Viacom changed its name to CBS Corporation and spun off its cable and movie interests as a new Viacom. WUPA remained under the CBS banner, along with the other broadcasting interests. It is also co-owned with its corporate radio cousins WVEE, WZGC-FM and WAOK, which are all located separately from WUPA in midtown.

Over the years, more first run syndicated shows were added to the station's schedule. When the Disney cartoon block ended in 2003, WUPA stopped running kids programming except for the weekends. It picked up the Fox Box, later 4Kids TV, from WHOT-TV (now WUVG-DT) in 2002 when that station was sold to Univision. Channel 69 continued to air Fox's Saturday morning children's block until just before The CW began airing. Thereafter, 4Kids TV was not picked up by any Atlanta station until it went off the air in December 2008. (The successor block to 4Kids TV, the Weekend Marketplace infomercial block, is currently aired on WATL.)

On Monday, April 5, 2004, the station launched "UPN Atlanta News at Ten", a 10pm newscast produced by WXIA-TV as well as a live program at 10:30pm titled "Atlanta Tonight". Both suffered in the ratings, and they were canceled on Sunday, August 28, 2005. WXIA has since resumed a 10pm newscast after purchasing WATL in 2006.
