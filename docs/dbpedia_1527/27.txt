These Are Fightin' Words

I LOVE what Sharon's daughter, Brandi had to say â€œToday we fight. Tomorrow we fight. The day after, we fight. And if this disease plans on whipping us, it better bring a lunch." I love their spirit.

Her family thanks you in advance and hope to see you on Saturday, July 30th. Rusty's Cabin is located at State Rt. 858 in Little Meadows, Pa.
