        "text": "Sharon Brown\n\nSharon Brown began her volunteer experience as a patient visitor for Treasure Coast Hospice in 2007. When the role of coordinating volunteer for the Treasured Pets program became available in 2013, she jumped right in. A self-professed animal lover, Sharon understood how pets provided another way to establish relationships with patients.\n\n“Not only are pets part of the family but they mean so much to someone’s spirits when things aren’t going well. It’s important to make sure that patients know that they, as well as their pets, are in good and loving hands.”\n\nToday, Sharon is the heart and soul of Treasured Pets, a special program for hospice patients and their pets. Whether contacting families, coordinating the purchase of pet food, setting up grooming sessions, negotiating discounts with local veterinarians, or finding “Forever Homes” for pets left behind, she and the dedicated team of Treasured Pets volunteers are committed advocates for both patients and their furry companions."
