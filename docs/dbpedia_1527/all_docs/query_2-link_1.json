Sharon Brown left LA and returned to the East Coast only to find years later her song \"Family Tree\" had become a huge underground hit. It was licensed once by Sharon Brown and OST Recording based in the UK to release \"Family Tree\" around the world, that, despite receiving club play in both the US and the UK, has never been officially received or in FM radio rotation.[2] She had a hit single on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1982 with the song \"I Specialize in Love\",[3] which was written by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher.
