        "text": "It used to be, getting sent to the principal's office was a bad thing. But students at Bluffton High School may be a little less reluctant-or perhaps even eager-to pass through that door with Sharon Brown sitting at the front desk, a big smile on her face and a positive word on her lips. As secretary to the principal, her job includes a whole lot more than just shuffling papers. She does everything she can to support the teachers, students and parents; or as she puts it, it's not about her job description, but what she can do for you at that moment.\n\n\"If anyone asks me how many kids I have in school right now, I say, well, I think the current enrollment is 1,351,\" said Sharon. \"I love them all. These kids are our future. How can I not get attached to all of them?\"\n\nChances are Sharon darkened the door of the principal's office at some point during her own schooling. After her mom died from injuries suffered in a tragic car accident, Sharon, who was 14 at the time, went through a dark, reclusive period. She graduated from McCracken High School in Bluffton, but in college she began to turn increasingly to alcohol to assuage her sorrows. By the time she graduated, she was drinking and using drugs to a destructive extent.\n\n\"I was lost,\" she says. \"I was really searching for my identity, but I was looking in all the wrong directions-partying, drinking, doing drugs. I didn't do much during the '80's.\"\n\nThen something miraculous happened: At age 29, Sharon conceived a daughter who would ultimately become her redemption. She put down the substances long enough to have the baby, but she went back to using them during the girl's early years. It wasn't until little Sable was six years old that Sharon hit rock bottom; after getting arrested for shoplifting she finally made the decision to get treatment. Five months later, she was clean and loving it.\n\n\"It was a great awakening for me,\" said Sharon. \"It was refreshing being clean and sober because I no longer had to be out on the streets. And I really think that my daughter saved me because, if I didn't have her, what would I have to live for?\"\n\nSharon began volunteering in the community, getting proactive in her daughter's education and rediscovering her faith in God. She's been involved in Bluffton High School since it was built and has held her current position there for two years. Working with people and trying to make a positive impact on students' lives is what she's all about, whether it means giving friendly advice, a dose of tough love or just a hug and a \"God bless you.\" It's almost impossible to talk to her without some of that unshakably upbeat attitude rubbing off on you. She doesn't dwell on the past; her mistakes have been repented for and let go.\n\n\"I don't ever look back,\" she said. \"That's the old Sharon and I'm not ashamed of it. But I'm focused on where I am now and where I'm going. I want to spend the rest of my life doing good things for people.\"\n\nUp Close\n\nBorn: Savannah, GA Grew up: Florida and Bluffton, SC Degree in: fashion merchandising Mother of: Sable, 20, a graduate of Bluffton High School who is now enrolled in the nursing program at TCL Hobbies: watching sports, playing softball, crocheting, going to church and singing in the choir Other duties: secretary of the public safety committee Three words to describe herself: friendly, loving, people-person Pipe dream: become a wealthy philanthropist so she can spend all her time and riches helping people, as well as building a homeless shelter in Beaufort County Word to the wise: \"What you do today affects your tomorrow.\""
