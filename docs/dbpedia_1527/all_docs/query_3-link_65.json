        "text": "Sharon Lee Brown passed peacefully, surrounded by her family, on June 6, 2024, in Sedalia, Missouri.\n\nSharon was born on June 24, 1946, to J.D. and Velma Prall in Sedalia. On June 1, 1963, she was united in marriage to James \"Jimmy\" H. Brown. Sharon worked with Jimmy in his many businesses. She also worked with her mother, Velma, when they opened Plaster Craft Den in the early 1980's. She enjoyed working with her mom and creating plaster figurines. After that, she opened The Light House lighting store with her husband, Jimmy, where she worked until retirement. She loved slot machines and traveling to Las Vegas with family and friends. She also loved gardening and had the prettiest yard in her neighborhood year after year. Her biggest love was her family, especially her grandkids, who she never said no to on any occasion. In her final days, she was described by one of her grandkids as a \"beautiful soul,\" something anyone who ever met her would certainly agree with. She was sweet, kind, giving, and a genuinely wonderful person who her family will deeply miss.\n\nSharon was preceded in death by her parents, her husband, \"Jimmy,\" her baby sister, and her brother, \"Danny\".\n\nShe is survived by her two sons, Brian (Karla) of Kansas City and John of Sedalia, and her treasured grandkids, Noah (Jordan) and Alex, all of Kansas City, and Collin, Rachel, and Fred, all of Sedalia. Her brother, Carl (Betty) Prall of Branson, also survived her.\n\nSharon will be laid to rest in a private service with family at the Missouri Veterans Cemetery in Higginsville, Missouri, next to her beloved husband, \"Jimmy.\""
