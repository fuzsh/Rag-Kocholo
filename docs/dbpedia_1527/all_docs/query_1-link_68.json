        "text": "LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Friends and fans were remembering actor-comedian Johnny Brown, who was best known for being the butt of jokes as building superintendent Nathan Bookman on the CBS sitcom ``Good Times'' in the 1970s, following his death at age of 84.\n\nSinger and actress Janet Jackson, who co-starred with Brown on ``Good Times,'' was among those remembering him over the weekend.\n\n``Such loving memories of our time together,'' Jackson tweeted ``You were full of laughter and forever smiling. Always so sweet and so kind to me. I love you and will miss you.''\n\n``R.I.P. Mr. Johnny Brown,'' former actor Shavar Ross tweeted ``I've known him since age 9 and he was one of the kindest people I've met. My sincerest condolences to the Brown family, friends and fans.''\n\nBrown's daughter, actress Sharon Brown announced his death Friday on Instagram.\n\n``Our family is devastated. Devastated. Devastated. Beyond heartbroken. Barely able to breathe,'' she wrote. ``... This is my mom's husband for sixty one years, mine and JJ's dad, Elijah and Levi's Pop Pop, older brother to George and brother in law to Pat and extended family to Chris, Hihat, Damian and Derell.\n\n``It's too terrible. It will never not be. It's a shock. He was literally snatched out of our lives. It's not real for us yet. So there will be more to say but not now. Dad was the absolute best. We love him so very much.''\n\nAccording to the post, Brown died Wednesday. Sharon Catherine Brown told TMZ her father was at his doctor's office in Los Angeles that day getting his pacemaker checked out, and went into cardiac arrest shortly after leaving. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died.\n\nBrown was born in St. Petersburg, Florida and grew up in Harlem, cutting his teeth as a nightclub performer and later a Broadway actor, including appearing in the play ``Golden Boy'' with Sammy Davis Jr. He also sang, performing with bands and recording songs before his television career.\n\nBrown first gained national attention on NBC's ``Laugh-In'' in the early 1970s, before joining ``Good Times'' in the middle of its second season in 1975.\n\nHis superintendent character Bookman was relentlessly ridiculed by the entire Evans family, as well as their neighbor Willona. Brown earned the respect of audiences for enduring such frequently repeated barbs as ``Buffalo Butt'' and ``Booger.''\n\nBrown's other TV work included appearances on ``The Flip Wilson Show,'' ``The Jeffersons,'' ``Family Matters,'' ``The Jamie Foxx Show,'' ``The Wayans Bros.'' and ``Martin.''\n\nHe also appeared in several films including ``A Man Called Adam'' with Davis and ``Life'' with Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence."
