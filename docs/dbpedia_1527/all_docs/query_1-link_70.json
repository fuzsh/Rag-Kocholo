        "text": "Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we start, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your childhood backstory?\n\nI am the middle child of 3, the only girl. I grew up in army barracks until my Dad retired from the Army and then we moved to Lusk, a small Village in North County Dublin. Growing up I was always a sensitive child. I had a very wild imagination as a child, I loved playing in the garden and remember always feeling there was something else, looking back now I could always sense and feel different energies. Growing up I was always interested in going to Fortune tellers, paranormal and i always seeing things differently from others. In my late 30s I had an accident at work and did some serious damage to my arm. After 3 years of hospital visits and medical intervention, I was told I would have to live with the pain, there was nothing they could do. So I looked into alternative ways to heal myself. I started learning reiki and self healed and that opened me up to my soul journey.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\nNever let anyone dull your sparkle, By Marlyn Monore, the words are so relevant to in my life because when I was at school I was thick, lazy and stupid because i wasn’t any good at school work, later on in life I discovered I was dyslexic, which made a lot of sense to me looking back. Even in my work I don’t let any dull my sparkle as I don’t worry about what others think of me, it is none of my business.\n\nIs there a particular book, podcast, or film that made a significant impact on you? Can you share a story or explain why it resonated with you so much?\n\nThe Secret By Rhonda Byrne, it was my first spiritual book and it opened me up to believing and trusting in myself, it helped me look at life in a positive way and helped let go of the negative beliefs i was holding on to. After reading this book I could see how blessed I was and what I was grateful for in my life, it was life changing for me. I still open it on a random page and it is what I need at that moment in time, it truly does hold the magic within.\n\nLet’s now shift to the main part of our discussion. Let’s begin with a definition of terms so that each of us and our readers are on the same page. What exactly does intuition mean? Can you explain?\n\nTo me intuition means the ability to understand or know something without the need for conscious reasoning or explicit evidence. It’s often described as a “gut feeling,” a hunch, or an immediate understanding that doesn’t necessarily rely on logical analysis or explicit information. Most people get that gut feeling or just a sense of knowing and no matter what anyone is saying, you just know it’s right.\n\nHow would you define common sense? Are intuition and common sense related?\n\nTo me Common sense refers to the practical knowledge and reasoning that most people share about everyday situations. It’s like the basic understanding of how things work or what’s generally considered reasonable in a given context. Common sense is built upon facts, experiences, and social norms that everyone agrees upon. It’s the kind of wisdom that helps you make logical decisions,\n\nIntuition, on the other hand, is that “gut feeling” or hunch you get without having to think it through. It’s like your brain quickly putting together puzzle pieces without you consciously realizing it. Intuition often relies on patterns, past experiences, feelings to guide you, even when you can’t explain why you feel a certain way.\n\nHow are they different from each other?\n\nIn a nutshell, common sense is the simple stuff we all know, while intuition is that mysterious sixth sense/ Gut feeling that helps us decide things without logical thinking.\n\nWhat are the positive aspects of being in touch with your intuition? Can you give a story or example to explain what you mean?\n\nWhen we listen to our intuition we never going wrong, our intuition always has are best interests at heart., it is our soul/ higher self leading the way. For example, I get that I need to make a contact with a friend, I get a strong feeling that they are not doing too good and they may need a friend. When I get the feeling and I contact them, there is always something going on for them and they just need a friend to listen.\n\nAre there negative aspects to being guided by intuition? Can you give a story or example to explain what you mean?\n\nThere can be, not everyone around you can or will understand your choices and sometimes you just can’t explain how or why you are making these choices, that is the part they don’t understand.\n\nCan you give some guidance about when one should make a decision based on their intuition and when one should use other methods to come to a decision?\n\nI always go with my gut feeling and that sense of knowing that I get, if it is not right for me I know straight away. If I second myself when I get those feelings, that is when things don’t work out for me. It is about trusting and believing in yourself and following the feeling you are getting, only you know them.\n\nFrom your experience or perspective, what are some of the common barriers that hold someone back from trusting their intuition?\n\nI find what holds them back is lack of self confidence, learnt beliefs, unworthiness, Self/others Judgment and fear of getting it wrong. As I say to my clients there is no wrong way, there is only your way, if you don’t try you will never know.\n\nHere is the central question of our discussion. What are five methods that someone can use to become more in touch with their intuition?\n\n1 . Mindfulness and Meditation: Practice mindfulness and meditation to quiet your mind and tune into your inner thoughts and feelings. These techniques help you become more aware of your instincts and can improve your ability to notice intuitive hits and most of all trust what you are getting\n\n2 . Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to how your body reacts in different situations. Your physical sensations, like butterflies in your stomach or tense shoulders, can be signals from your intuition. If something feels off or right, your body might be trying to tell you something.\n\n3 . Keep a Journal: Write down your thoughts, feelings, and hunches regularly. Over time, patterns will emerge, showing you when your intuition is most accurate. Reflecting on your journal entries can help you recognize your intuitive insights more easily.\n\n4. Quiet Time: :Spend some quiet time alone. Away from distractions, your intuition can speak more clearly. Whether you’re taking a walk, sitting in nature, or simply relaxing, solitude can help your intuitive thoughts come forward.\n\n5 . Practice Decision-Making: Start with small decisions and trust your gut feeling. See how often your intuition guides you correctly. Gradually work your way up to bigger decisions, using your intuition alongside logical reasoning.\n\nYou are a person of significant influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be?\n\nTo me it would be self love, a lot of people don’t even understand the concept of self love, they think loving yourself is being selfish, that is the way a lot of us were brought up. They think by giving some else all there love, that it is ok, but it not as you have to love yourself first unconditional before you can love anyone else, for a lot of people that is very hard to do, i struggled myself with this for years, and when i look back i see how unhappy and lost i was,. When was the last time you looked in the mirror and loved what you saw ? , why not try looking in the mirror and saying to the beautiful reflection I LOVE YOU.\n\nIs there a person in the world whom you would love to have lunch with, and why? Maybe we can tag them and see what happens!\n\nRhonda Byrne is the person I would like to meet. I would love to have a very deep conversation with her about life and the magic that we all hold within us.\n\nHow can our readers further follow your work online?\n\nYou cam follow me the follow social media platform:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/livinguniquelyusharon.ie\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sharonbrownthesoulconnector/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC43zyVhrjxCJKjcUWfJU8wQ\n\nhttps://sharonbrown.net/"
