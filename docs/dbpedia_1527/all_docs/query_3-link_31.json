        "text": "We’re very happy to announce that Sharon Brown recently joined A Better Way as our new Chief Operating Officer (COO). Ms. Brown has served with distinction as COO and interim CEO of Youth Uprising – an innovative, transformational, and celebrated non-profit in East Oakland. She has been recognized for her skilled hand guiding Youth Uprising through challenging times and landing them on solid ground. She carries a wealth of highly relevant knowledge, experience, and expertise.\n\nWe recently asked her a few questions about her new position.\n\nHow does it feel to be stepping into the role of Chief Operating Officer at A Better Way?\n\nIt’s an exciting opportunity. The timing is ideal with the assimilation of new leadership. It feels fitting to join an organization with a long-standing presence that has demonstrated its unwavering commitment to improving the quality of care for those impacted by the child welfare system.\n\nWhat inspires you about the type of work that A Better Way does?\n\nI am invigorated by A Better Way's philosophy of \"clients first.\" Our clients are at the forefront of everything that we do! From a very early age, I have always felt an inherent responsibility to help those in need directly or indirectly through efforts in my personal and professional capacity. Being a part of a collective leading the charge to improve child welfare outcomes and help families thrive is a natural alignment - I am energetic about the future.\n\nCan you share something about yourself that isn’t work related?\n\nSure! This may come as a surprise to some folks, but I love, love, love new construction build, home renovations, interior design, and a great DIY – all are so gratifying. Some evenings you can find me perusing the HGTV Network for inspiration - Property Brothers is my absolute favorite. My friends often solicit my design skills when they're looking to refresh their homes or switch out furniture pieces. For now, I am looking to add a couple of new power tools to my limited collection for my next DIY. Wish me luck!\n\nAs Chief Operating Officer, what do you look forward to?\n\nI look forward to developing a sustainable infrastructure that allows us to deepen our commitment to improving the quality of care and continuous quality improvement for the children and families we serve."
