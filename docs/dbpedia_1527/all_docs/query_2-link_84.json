In order for students to thrive, they need the support of their families, school administrators and community to ensure there is governance transparency, fiscal accountability and a quality education.\n\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\n\nI am a good candidate for the school board because I am a concerned and active citizen.\n\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\n\nI admire President Joe Biden. He is a unifier and believes in community across the nation.\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nOne of the most important issues facing our students is access to mental wellness resources. I support increasing the access to mental wellness services and resources for students.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nI am greatly concerned about school safety. I support local law enforcement working with the public school administrators to collaborate on needed solutions.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nHistory lessons should cover all events of the past in a detailed manner. Students should be allowed to research topics and develop their own theses.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nBooks are provided to students to increase their knowledge of learning."
