        "text": "Sharon went home to heaven and was welcomed into the presence of her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on Monday, August 29, 2022.\n\nSharon was born November 23, 1955 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to loving parents, Jerome V. “Jerry” and Deloris “Dee” Kopveiler. She attended Edina public schools and was a part of the Edina band program.\n\nIn her youth, Sharon was in bowling leagues, enjoyed putting on family talent shows with her cousins, and music. She loved music so much that it inspired her to be a part of the band where she learned to play flute and piccolo.\n\nAfter high school, Sharon married (now divorced) and had a daughter Amy. She began her career at Cargill and ended as a Supervisor of Medical Transcription for Allina Health in 2017, due to health reasons. She loved the people she worked with. Her daughter Amy married Brian and they have two children: Mikayla and Kyler. Mikayla and Kyler were her pride and joy and they share the love of marching band with her. They are in the Pella Marching Dutch.\n\nSharon is survived by her daughter Amy (Brian) Besick of Pella, Iowa, grandchildren Mikayla and Kyler. She was preceded in death by her parents and sister Laurie.\n\nSharon loved to travel. She went on various trips to Europe, Hong Kong, Mexico, Hawaii, and of course Disney. A highlight in her travels was when she traveled with the Great Lakes Ambassadors of Music with Amy on a 2 ½ week trek through Europe. She fell in love with a little town called Champery, Switzerland in the Swiss Alps. She wanted to go back some day.\n\nSharon did not wish to have a memorial service. In her honor, please donate to Edina Band Boosters or Pella Marching Dutch as her love for band never wavered, and she would watch her grandchildren every chance she had."
