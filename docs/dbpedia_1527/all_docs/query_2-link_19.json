These talents carried into her adult life as she decorated cakes for events, painted beautiful portraits, and created gifts that will forever be cherished by those who loved her.\n\nSharon adored her family, most especially her girls and her grandchildren. She had a deep and abiding love for the Lord, being baptized and raised at First Christian Church in Plymouth. Later, she joined Holly Neck Church of Christ in Roper, where she found her church home. Sharon battled many health issues in her adult life, but her faith in God and trust in Him never faltered. He was her strength.\n\nA celebration of Sharon’s life will be held at 3:00 p.m. on Saturday, February 10, 2024, at Holly Neck Church of Christ in Roper, with David Watts officiating. The family will visit with friends from 1:30 – 2:30 p.m. prior to the service. A private burial will follow at Jamesville Cemetery.\n\nSharon is survived by her two daughters, Amanda G.
