        "text": "As an investor, advisor, and entrepreneur, I know that every business owner is looking for the fastest and most impactful way to accelerate growth and scale their businesses.\n\nNo one likes the uncertainty or overwhelm that can come when trying to grow and get to the next level... But you can get results faster when you know what to do now and what to do next.\n\nWhether you need an investor and advisor to help you grow your existing business or you are looking to sell and exit, it starts with building a relationship and taking the first step.\n\nI’m an investor in mostly technology companies (with some possible exceptions) that are generating revenue. I believe in entrepreneurs who know how to gain traction and how to launch physical and digital products and services.\n\nUse the link above to contact me. If for some reason I’m unable to help you directly, I would be happy to extend introductions to investors in my network with whom I collaborate and partner.\n\n.Hi, my name is Sharon Brown, and I’m an investor and entrepreneur.\n\nI love all things sports and travel related, plus a good laugh every day… AND helping others scale their businesses and exit fuels me.\n\nI’ve launched over 207 physical products and services as an entrepreneur, including the award-winning Selona luxury skincare consumer goods products… And I’ve invested in some pretty innovative companies as an investor.\n\nThrough engaging with countless businesses across a variety of industries… I also have had the good fortune of identifying the key triggers and challenges that businesses struggle with when it comes to scaling and integrating people, processes, and systems.\n\nWith a background in technology and as an integration strategist on tech and non-tech businesses, I’m also a recovering certified SAFe Product Owner/Product Manager (POPM), Six Sigma Master Black Belt, and certified business analyst (CBAP). I know what it’s like to have HUGE budgets to create multi-million dollar mission-critical products and services.\n\nThough I was fortunate to have those experiences when I was a “corporate citizen of the world”, I quickly came to realize that THAT was not the experience of 99% of mid-market businesses who sometimes struggle to grow revenue. Also, owners struggle to realize their dreams of what their lives will look like after they sell.\n\nSo, I’ve spent over two decades creating proven processes and frameworks that have been essential in helping businesses successfully grow faster, and with more impact… and I eventually started investing in companies to help them do the same.\n\nBecause no one likes the uncertainty or overwhelm that can come from trying to grow, or looking for ways to move on and realize life beyond their business.\n\nIf you want to discuss potential investor and advisor partnerships, or have an audience and you’re interested in bringing them a new perspective on integration and growth… Let’s talk!"
