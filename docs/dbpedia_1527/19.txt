Sharon Brown was a teenager when she first began working for Ted Brown Music. While in high school she met and began dating the founderâ€™s son, Warren. Soon she discovered she had a real love for both Warren and the music business. She ran the record department and after marrying Warren, she played a very important supportive role in the business as well as the industry. The couple were among the founding members of NASMD, and while her husband served as president, she served as secretary for the board from 1981-1985. Sharon also helped run the annual conference which included even cooking the salmon dinner in the early days! Her love, support and passion has clearly been passed down to her two daughters who continue the family tradition. While she did not consider herself a musician, she helped thousands of students and customers of all ages make music!
