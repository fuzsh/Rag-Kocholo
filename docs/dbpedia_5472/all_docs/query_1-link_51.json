        "text": "Northeast PA is mostly known for two things (three, if you count that one town with the big underground fire). While West Virginia’s got them beat in one of those things (coal), they remain unmatched in the other– emo music.\n\nWe’re going to start this off with a little mental exercise. Think back to the first time you felt cool. When I say cool, I don’t mean the mass-produced coolness that gets sold back to everyone in an attempt to sell you the next hot product.\n\nThis past April, a thunderous EP came crashing into U92’s rotation, injuring one DJ and strewing the studio with broken glass and goat hair. Created by Saint Louis, Missouri area punks Inner City Witches, HOOF! presents a unique blend of punk, post-punk, and jazz all fusing together into a sound equally cohesive and coercive."
