She obtained her PhD from that university as well as a Master’s Degree in Biochemistry- Immunology. She has large expertise in cell culture system (2D and 3D culture models) and immuno-oncology field. Hayet Rafa also has more recent, extensive experience with nanoantibodies production and the development of new tools for predictive diagnostic in cervical cancer. In the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), she plans to develop a new pre-clinical tool to assess innovative treatments such as the evaluation of immune cell therapy efficacy and safety in colorectal cancer metastasis (Preclinical trial on chip). During her fellowship, she was granted the Roche-ATRSS Award for Cancer Research.\n\nJudith Gbenoudon, from Benin, obtained her PhD in Immunology at the Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany, and held postdoctoral positions in Hamburg, Bonn, and Gambia. She is the current Director of the Laboratory of Immunology, Infectious and Allergic Diseases at the Institute for Applied Biomedical Sciences in Cotonou. During her fellowship at the Spanish National Center for Biotechnology (CNB) she carried out her project Tumor Immunomarkers and the Development of Immunotherapy (TIDEI), with the aim of determining the specificities of immunotherapy in isolated cells from patients in infectious endemic areas, like Benin, as compared to cells from patients in clean areas like Spain. This research earned her the prestigious Abdool Karim Prize from The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) in Trieste (Italy).\n\nLeontine Nkamba, from Cameroon, holds a joint PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Lorraine (France) and the University of Gaston Berger (Senegal).

She investigates Molecular Parasitology with special focus on African Trypanosomiasis. Currently, she’s the Principal Investigator of a Deutstche Forshungsgemeinschaft (DFG) funded project focusing on Animal African trypanosomes in Humans as an emerging zoonoses. “Building research capacity to tackle leishmaniasis in Nigeria” is the title of the research she conducts at the Carlos lll Health Institute in Madrid thanks to the funding of the State Foundation for Health, Childhood and Social Wellbeing (FCSAI).\n\nMansurah Abdulazeez, from Nigeria, got her PhD in Ahmadu Bello University and is currently a Senior Lecturer at the Center for Biotechnology Research, Bayero University. In the Institute of Neurosciences (CSIC-UMH) of Alicante she works on the project ‘‘Molecular basis of therapy resistance in triple negative breast cancer’, hoping to understand the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the progression to the metastatic state in cancer. Thus, to alleviate the unending tragedy brought about by this disease it is pertinent to understand the basis of drug resistance and consequent metastasis in this type of cancer. She is focusing on three TNBC cell lines: human breast adenocarcinomas (MDA- MB-231 and MX-1) and human breast medullary carcinoma (MDA-MB-157) to understand the principles of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) at cellular and molecular levels and characterize multiple EMT programmes by analysing different EMT phenotypes.\n\nDr. Fadipe, from Nigeria, holds a PhD in Cell Biology and Genetics from the University of Lagos (Nigeria) and she is currently a Chief Research Officer and Head of the Molecular Biology Laboratory at the Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi, Nigeria. She is investigating the sustainable production of Polyhydroxyalkanoates for bioplastic production in Nigeria. In fact, the enormous amount of synthetic plastic waste in Lagos is a big problem that needs sustainable alternatives. In line with the UNSDGs (3,9,12), she aims to replace synthetic plastics with biodegradable ones in order to prevent further environmental (e.g. flooding) and health (e.g. cancer) problems. She strongly believes that “investing in quality R&D will reposition Nigeria on the global stage”.
