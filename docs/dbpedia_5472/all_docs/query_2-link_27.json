        "text": "Station Streams\n\nThis is my radio directory of streaming stations. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do. In most cases, the link placed here will take you directly to the station stream, and sound should begin playing shortly. Please note that some streams may buffer, depending on the station’s player, and the speed of your internet connection. Streams that use either the Samnet Media Player, or that work best in the Firefox (refered to as FF) browser are labeled as such. (The streams that are labeled “FF Browser needed.” usually also work in Internet Explorer (IE), but not in the SA browser—even though the streams are labeled as working in Firefox; it means FF is the best browser for said streams. Also, some streams would not allow me to copy the direct link for the SA player, or use a flash player where you must go to the station website, and press play. In both cases, the link seen here will take you to the station’s website. Please note that streams from Radio Loyalty may take a minute or so to load, so please give it a moment before assuming the stream is down. There is the possibility that a stream may be down for a short period of time. If you notice anything in this directory that hasn’t been streaming for more than a week, or have a station stream you think I might want to add, please email me at serena@samobile.net. Your help will make it easier for me to keep this directory up to date. I’m open to any ideas for new streams to add here, but I’m primarely focused on streams of over the air radio stations. And, as far as I’m concerned, this directory only has one rule: If I don’t like it, I don’t add it. Please enjoy the stations here, and use them as frquently as you wish.\n\n—Serena.\n\nPlease choose one of the following 1167 links.\n\n100.1 Fox FM (Opens SA player.): Classic Hits station from Jasper, AL.
