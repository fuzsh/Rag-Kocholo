        "text": "Newsroom Sep - Dec 2007\n\nSupport HisAir.Net\n\nMidas Records artist Rush Of Fools #1 single, Undowas lauded as R&R's 2007 'Most Played Song of the Year' for the Adult Contemporary Monitored chart. In addition iTunes announced the smash hit as one of the top downloaded songs within the Christian & Gospel category of 2007, while Rush Of Fools has become the first new artist to land a debut single at #1 since Casting Crowns in 2004. The groups recent Christmas single, \"O Come All Ye Faithful climbed the charts to the number #9 position on the R&R AC Chart with more than 1.8 million impressions, following an onslaught of over 6,000 free digital downloads of the track that were recorded in the first three weeks when offered on various websites including HisAir.Net. (12/28)\n\nIn sympathetic response to the cries of the Music First Coalition that radio airplay has hurt rather than helped musical performers, Christian Listening Network stations will no longer air music recorded by artists listed on the Coalition's website. Following the December 18 introduction of legislation titled Performance Rights Act, the stations' Music Directors have been instructed to cull artists from playlists whose names appear on the Music First Coalition's website as Founding Artists. Christian Listening Network's General Manager Dan DeBruler is among the outspoken critics of the legislation, calling it a ...tax that cannot be fairly distributed among artists whose music actually receives airplay. The proponents of the legislation implied it to be a performance royalty during its formation, then added a flat-rate fee for small and noncommercial radio stations when it was introduced to Congress.\n\nAccording to DeBruler, Our Music Directors are diligent in selecting the best songs week after week, adding  it is illegal for US radio stations to accept direct compensation in any form in exchange for airplay. We play and promote the best songs and artists, then watch as they climb the charts. The result is increased record sales and improved ticket sales at live performances. If performing artists believe uncompensated airplay is hurting them to the extent they need legislation to stop it, we'll save them the trouble, DeBruler said of the ban.\n\nFrom DeBrulers memo to Music Directors: Please continue to work closely with your recording industry representatives. Selecting and promoting top music is still in the best interest of our listeners and our industry. If the Performance Rights Act becomes law, we will negotiate individual fees with the artists whose music we play to ensure fair compensation.\n\nDan DeBruler manages three Christian Listening Network stations in North Carolina: WCLN-FM, WGQR-FM, WBLA-AM.

Z88.3 made this change after seeing the outreach opportunity that Christian radio stations around the country have had by switching to all Christmas music during the Christmas season. We are excited to announce that we will be switching to all Christmas music for the first time this year. It is in an effort to reach the lost at a time when people are most receptive to the Gospel message, said Jim Hoge, Z88.3 President/General Manager.

(11/20)\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission opened what ended up being a ten day filing window for new non-commercial educational stations October 12-22. It was originally scheduled for October 12-19, but the FCC extended the filing window to the following Monday. There had been a freeze in place on new applications since 2000. The FCC had a one week filing window for translators in the commercial band four years ago and received 14,000 applications. Following that experience the FCC limited this filing to ten applications per organization.\n\nThe FCC began releasing the list of over 3600 applications on November 9. It seems that with the four year freeze there were many organizations that had been waiting for the opportunity to file for a radio station. There were also a generous compliment of state educational stations that applied, but it appears the over whelming majority of applications belong to Christian organizations.\n\nHowever, with the large number of applications most of them are in competition with one another. The FCC is allowing a sixty day opportunity for the organizations to reach an agreement on who would receive a frequency. However, with the overwhelming number of frequencies having three and more applicants it appears that it will take the FCC years to work through their system of handling competing applications.\n\nMany radio stations have built a network of translator stations. Translators are not protected radio stations. Many of these organizations filed for full power stations to protect their translators. However, since the FCC allowed only ten applications per organization there were an insufficient number of applications to protect all translator areas. Therefore this NCE filing window has created a situation where Christian organizations will be taking over the frequencies once operated by another Christian organization.\n\nThroughout the applications there are clues that a number of organizations worked in conjunction with various other ministries to be able to file for more than ten stations. The list of applications is 266 pages long and is a tangled web of competing applications. It appears that very few will benefit significantly in the near future. To view broadcast applications go here.

In an effort to fully understand homelessness, West chose to leave the comforts of his family, home, job and financial security. \"I heard the story of a Canadian DJ who just decided to live as a homeless person and I immediately thought 'I have to do that! West continued, To me, I just felt I that I had never really understood what homelessness was, even though I had given to the homeless, supported the mission and so forth. I just knew to really understand, I would need to experience it, even just for a little bit.\"\n\nOn Monday, November 12, 2007 at 9:40am, West was dropped off with only the clothes on his back, a jacket and a cell phone. He is phoning reports to the radio station during two long days and two cold nights as he discovers the feeling of having nowhere to go, nothing to eat and nowhere warm to sleep.

As a result of Wests efforts listeners are encouraged to help the mission provide food and care to the homeless community this Holiday season. Click here to see picture.

Danny Dardeau, station manager found out about the theft after he returned to the station Saturday afternoon following an outreach event. Out back of the building Monday morning, there was nothing more than an empty slab where the unit once stood. Dardeau said he would have done anything possible to help those who needed it if they would have just asked. \"If I had an extra AC unit, I'd give you one,\" Dardeau said. The incident is a setback to the station, which operates on a small budget with local support and underwriting from local businesses. It comes at a time when the station is planning an outreach music festival in early December at Parc International. Now, in addition to having to pool resources to make that happen, the station has to come up with additional funds to replace the AC unit.

(10/12)\n\nIn a last-day outpouring of listener support that amazed even veteran fundraisers WJIS/Sarasota (The Joy FM) annual fall Share-a-thon set a station record for single-day fundraising. The on-air appeal, which lasted 16 hours (6:00 A.M. until 10:00 P.M.) produced some 1500 calls and a total of $453,600 in gifts and commitments. That one (1) day amount represents just over 45% of the overall goal set for the entire 5 day event. Not only was it the largest fundraising day ever for The Joy FM, It also may be a one-day record for non-commercial Christian radio support drives nationwide, said air personality Bill Martin, a 21 year employee of The Joy FM.\n\nTheres never been a day like it here added GM Jeff MacFarlane. Almost half a million dollars in a day!

(10/2)\n\nA select group of Christian radio program directors, air personalities and other key influencers met last weekend at the Billy Graham Training Center at The Cove in Asheville, NC to address how Christian music broadcasters can best communicate the Gospel of Jesus Christ on-air in an authentic, life-changing way. This unique assembly of broadcasters, sponsored and hosted by Ron Hutchcraft Ministries, Renaissance Communications and Goodratings Strategic Services participated in a collaborative process and discussed various styles of effectively expressing the Gospel while maintaining programming excellence and remaining formatically correct.\n\nThe two day event was highlighted by veteran broadcaster and evangelism expert Ron Hutchcraft, who challenged the group to use their incredible media platforms to turn their radio stations into live-saving stations, modeled after the actual rescue stations created along the Eastern seaboard that developed into the Coast Guard. The parallel challenge for broadcasters was to become a station that intentionally looks for ways to reach the lost for Christ in a non-religious way.\n\nThe Gospel is the most powerful message on earth - it changes eternities. Radio is one of the most powerful delivery systems on earth. Rescue by Radio was about how we can turn all that power loose to spiritually rescue many more lost lives. We are committed together to use the influence that Gods giving us to help as many listeners as possible be in heaven with us someday. said Hutchcraft.\n\nLeadership input from Joe Battaglia of Renaissance Communications and John Frost and Alan Mason of Goodratings Strategic Services deliberated the fundamental questions of mission effectiveness for the future of Christian music radio. Joe Battaglia stated Reaching people for Christ shouldnt be an optional goal for a radio station. The truth is that we need a strategy for best doing it in the context of great radio. This summit sought to make that a greater priority in the minds and lives of our managers and broadcasters.\n\nFrost urged the broadcasters to move out of the box, design tools that create effective bridges of communication to listeners, and translate Christian rescue language into radio reality. Alan Mason moderated the group in several discussions and addressed their questions and concerns. Frost and Mason instructed the broadcasters how to equip their air talent with the freedom and skills to effectively convey the gospel without sacrificing quality or their format. Mason added Im honored and humbled to be serving in this way, and to be a part of something so important with such a high caliber level of talent. This was an exercise in collaborative design, with everyone sharing ideas and concepts that will advance our ability to share our faith on the radio.\n\nHow to communicate faith on the air effectively hits a response chord with a wide range of programming philosophies. Some stations limit faith-centered content because of their concern over whether the air talent can deliver it effectively. On the other hand, stations that desire more overt faith content want to know how their talent can to do it better stated Frost.\n\nIn their last session Frost and Mason gave the broadcasters steps for implementing the Rescue Radio strategy. Frost reminded the group that as we grow in our impact we grow in our responsibility.\n\nRons parting message to the broadcasters was delivered with power and conviction as he encouraged them to leave with a renewed focus and passion for their audience, to create excellent radio and to remember who you are and remember why youre here.\n\nBroadcasters in attendance included Rob Dempsey, PD of WLFJ-His Radio, Kristen Roberts, morning show host from His Radio Network; Dave Senes, PD of WAY-FM Network; Wally, Host of the syndicated national program Total Axxess; John Owens, PD of Family Life Network; Denny Nugent, PD of the Moody Broadcasting Network; Dean ONeal, PD of Z88.3 in Orlando; Chuck Pryor, PD of KSBJ, Houston; Carmen Brown, PD of The Joy FM Network; Reid Holsen, Assistant VP of stations at Northwestern College Radio; Kevin Peterson, editor of the Christian music column of R&R; Rick Robertson, PD of American Family Radio Network; Tom Greene, PD of WMIT, Asheville, NC; Scott Valentine, PD of KCMS, Seattle; and Gary Moreland, Network PD WRCM/WMHK and morning show host of WRCM, Charlotte.\n\nPlans are underway for a second annual Rescue by Radio Summit for next year.(10/1)\n\nK-LOVE network director of programming David Pierce has been promoted to VP of programming for EMF Broadcasting replacing Mike Novak who was upped to EMF president.
