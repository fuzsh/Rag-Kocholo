        "text": "You've probably heard of the ACT and SAT, but how different are these two tests really In this extensive ACT vs SAT analysis, we look at the top 11 differences between the ACT and SAT and explain what these differences mean for you. And to conclude, we give you tips on how to decide whether you should take the ACT or SAT.\n\nACT vs SAT: How Different Are They?\n\nAt a glance, the two tests aren't that different. Both the ACT and SAT are nationally recognized standardized tests and common admission requirements for US schools. Catering primarily to high school juniors and seniors, each test measures students' proficiency in various critical skill areas—such as problem solving and reading comprehension—that are necessary for college success.\n\nBecause all US colleges and universities accept scores from either the ACT or SAT, there's no advantage in taking one test over the other. This means you can apply to the same schools, regardless of which test you decide to take.\n\nBut what about the actual content of the two tests? Though not identical, the ACT and SAT do have some things in common:\n\nContain similar sections (Reading, Math, etc.) in a predetermined order\n\nUse rights-only scoring, meaning you will not be penalized for incorrect answers\n\nDespite all these similarities, there are still many ways in which the ACT and SAT differ from each other. For one, the ACT is overall longer than the SAT. What's more, the number of questions and time limits are different for corresponding sections.\n\nHere is a brief overview of the basic structural and logistical differences between the ACT and SAT:\n\nACT\n\nSAT\n\nTotal Time\n\n2 hrs 55 mins without Writing\n\n3 hrs 35 mins with Writing 2 hrs 14 minutes total\n\nOrder of Sections\n\n1. English\n\n2. Math\n\n3. Reading\n\n4. Science\n\n5. Writing (optional) 1. Reading and Writing (Module 1 and 2)\n\n2. Math (Module 1 and 2)\n\nTime Per Section\n\nEnglish: 45 mins\n\nMath: 60 mins\n\nReading: 35 mins\n\nScience: 35 mins\n\nWriting (optional): 40 mins Reading and Writing: 64 mins (two 32-min modules\n\nMath: 70 mins (two 35-min modules)\n\n# of Questions\n\nEnglish: 75 questions\n\nMath: 60 questions\n\nReading: 40 questions\n\nScience: 40 questions\n\nWriting (optional): 1 essay Reading and Writing: 54 questions\n\nMath: 44 questions\n\nScoring\n\nTotal score range: 1-36\n\nEach section uses a scale of 1-36. Your total score is the average of your four section scores.\n\nThe optional Writing section uses a scale of 2-12 and does not count toward your final score.\n\nTotal score range: 400-1600\n\nThe Reading and Writing and Math sections each use a scale of 200-800 and are combined for a total score.\n\nCost\n\n$63 without Writing\n\n$88 with Writing $60\n\nWho Accepts Scores?\n\nAccepted by all colleges and universities in the US\n\nAccepted by all colleges and universities in the US\n\nSo are these the only ways in which the ACT and SAT differ? Not at all! In fact, the two tests differ quite significantly in 11 key ways. Read on to see what these differences are and what they ultimately mean for you.\n\nSAT vs ACT: 11 Key Differences\n\nNow, let's begin our ACT vs SAT comparison. Although both tests share several similarities, here are the most important differences for you to consider before deciding whether to take the SAT or ACT.\n\n#1: Digital SAT Format\n\nBeginning March of 2024, students will take the SAT digitally. The adaptive testing model means that as you work, your accuracy in answering questions determines what questions will be presented to you in the next module. The level of difficulty will be matched to your ability. So if you answer most questions correctly in the first module of Reading and Writing, for example, the test will adapt and present you with more challenging questions in the second module. In turn, you will have a greater chance of scoring higher on the SAT, assuming you continue to answer questions correctly.\n\nThe ACT is still given as a paper test (at least for now). You will be presented with the same series of questions in each section, regardless of your performance throughout the test.\n\n#2: Time Per Question\n\nLoathe time crunches? Then you might prefer the SAT over the ACT. This is because the SAT gives you more time per question than the ACT does.\n\nThis chart illustrates the differences in time per question (if you were to spend the same amount of time on each question in a given section):\n\nACT SAT ACT Reading/ SAT Reading and Writing 53 sec/question 61 sec/question ACT English 36 sec/question N/A Math 60 sec/question 95 sec/question Science 53 sec/question N/A\n\nAs you can see, the SAT offers more time per question on all sections of the exam. You'll have the biggest increase in time per question on the SAT Math section.\n\nSo if you're worried about time management, particularly on math questions, the SAT offers much more workable and far less stress-inducing time constraints than the ACT does.\n\n#3: Science Section\n\nAnother major difference has to do with science. While the ACT contains a section entirely devoted to science, the SAT does not.\n\nLooking above at our chart of differences, we can see that the ACT Science section contains 40 questions and lasts 35 minutes. Like the other three ACT sections, Science constitutes one-fourth of your total ACT score. So if you're a science whiz who loves the idea of having an entire section focused on scientific data, graphs, and hypotheses, the ACT might be a better fit for you.\n\nThat being said, the SAT does test scientific concepts—just not through a separate Science section. On the SAT, you'll occasionally come across questions dealing with scientific passages, data, and charts on the Reading and Writing and Math sections.\n\n#4: Types and Balance of Math Concepts\n\nIn regard to math content, the ACT and SAT both have a big emphasis on algebra. But the ACT also tests a couple of concepts that the SAT doesn't focus on as much.\n\nTo start, the ACT has a much larger focus on geometry, which makes up about 30-45% of ACT Math. By contrast, geometry accounts for less than 10% of SAT Math questions. In addition, trigonometry accounts for about 7% of the ACT but less than 5% of the SAT, so there's a slightly larger emphasis of trig on the ACT than there is on the SAT.\n\nThe ACT also tests a few concepts that the SAT doesn't test at all. These include things such as matrices, graphs of trig functions, and logarithms.\n\nSo what does all this mean for you? If you're good at algebra and data analysis, you'll likely do well on the SAT. But if you're a fan of trig functions and geometry and are comfortable with matrices and logs, the ACT is a better choice.\n\n#5: Math Formulas Reference Guide\n\nHere's another math-related difference: the SAT provides you with a diagram of math formulas, whereas the ACT does not.\n\nBefore the two SAT Math subsections, you'll be given a diagram containing 12 geometry formulas and three laws:\n\nAlthough all these formulas and laws pertain to geometry—which, as you now know, doesn't make up a huge part of the SAT—having this diagram handy means you won't need to spend a ton of time memorizing formulas beforehand (though you should take care to memorize some important formulas not included in the diagram).\n\nUnlike the SAT, the ACT doesn't give you any formulas on test day, meaning you absolutely must memorize all potential formulas before taking the test.\n\nIn short, if you're concerned you might forget certain formulas, the SAT offers a little more of a crutch than the ACT does.\n\n#6: Importance of Math in Final Score\n\nHow big of a role will Math play in your final score? The answer to this question depends on whether you're taking the ACT or SAT. On the ACT, Math accounts for one-fourth of your total score (your Math section score is averaged with your other three section scores). On the SAT, however, Math accounts for half of your total score, making it twice as important on the SAT!\n\nSo if math isn't your strong suit, consider opting for the ACT. With the ACT, a lower Math score won't negatively affect your total score as much as it will on the SAT.\n\nTo illustrate this more clearly, let's look at an example. If I were to score in similar percentiles on the ACT and SAT—with significantly lower Math section scores—you might think that my total percentiles on both exams would be about the same. But as you can see below, this isn't the case.\n\nACT percentiles:\n\nEnglish: 32 (92nd percentile)\n\nMath: 16 (35th percentile)\n\nReading: 32 (91st percentile)\n\nScience: 30 (93rd percentile)\n\nComposite: 28 (88th percentile)\n\nSAT percentiles:\n\nEBRW: 700 (94th percentile)\n\nMath: 460 (31st percentile)\n\nComposite: 1160 (69th percentile)\n\nAs this example indicates, even if I were to score in similar percentiles on every section of the ACT and SAT (with lower Math section scores on each test), my composite score percentiles would differ dramatically. In this case, my final ACT percentile is 19% higher than my SAT percentile.\n\nIn other words, if math isn't one of your strengths, you'll have a better shot at hitting the total percentile you want on the ACT than you will on the SAT.\n\n#7: Number of Answer Choices on Math\n\nThe two tests also differ in the number of answer choices they give you on Math. Both the SAT and ACT Math sections are predominantly multiple choice. But while ACT Math gives you five possible answer choices (A-E or F-K) for each question, SAT Math only gives you four (A-D).\n\nAs a reminder, both tests use rights-only scoring, meaning you'll never lose a point for an incorrect answer. So if you were to guess on an SAT Math question, you'd have a 25% chance of getting the question right. But if you were to guess on an ACT Math question, you'd have only a 20% chance of getting it right.\n\nTherefore, if you think you might need to guess on Math, know that the SAT offers a very slight advantage over the ACT, with a 5% higher probability of getting a question correct.\n\n#8: Free Response Math Questions\n\nIf you love multiple choice, especially when it comes to math questions, you might want to stick with the ACT. The SAT, though mostly multiple choice, also has student-produced response questions, which are math questions for which you must fill in your own answer. In other words, you'll have no answer choices from which to choose on these questions!\n\nStudent-produced response questions account for roughly 25% of SAT Math, or 11 total questions total. By contrast, ACT Math only has multiple-choice questions. If you're not a fan of math questions that don't offer you any answer choices, the ACT is the superior choice.\n\n#9: Evidence-Support Reading Questions\n\nAre you good at pinpointing areas in texts to support your answers to questions? If so, the SAT might be a better fit for you.\n\nEvidence-support questions are a big part of SAT Reading but are entirely absent on ACT Reading. These questions build off of the questions that come before them and ask you to cite specific lines or paragraphs as evidence for your answer to a previous question.\n\nOur guide discusses in more detail the different types of evidence questions you'll encounter on SAT Reading. Evidence questions can be somewhat tricky, so if you're not into the idea of identifying supporting statements, try the ACT instead.\n\n#10: Reading and English Passages\n\nOn ACT Reading and English, all questions are in reference to one of four (for Reading) or five (for English) long passages. But on SAT Reading and Writing, each question stands on its own and includes all the information you need to find the answer.\n\nAs a result, SAT Reading questions are generally easier to follow and thus easier to answer than ACT Reading questions. The shorter questions on the SAT can also save you time, as you won't need to search the entire passage for the area to which a question is referring.\n\n#11: Optional Essay\n\nThe last major difference between the two tests deals with the optional essay. On the ACT, there is an essay component that you can choose to take; however, as of summer 2021, the SAT no longer offers an extra essay.\n\nIf you choose to take the essay portion of the ACT, you'll read a short passage about an issue and then analyze the different perspectives on this issue. Then, you'll also give your own opinion on the issue discussed in the passage.\n\nHere's an example of an ACT Writing prompt:\n\nFor this optional writing section you'll not only need to have good reading comprehension skills in order to fully realize the strengths and weaknesses of the author's argument, but you'll need strong rhetorical skills too. So, if you decide to take this portion of the ACT, you need to be able to effectively compare and contrast different perspectives on an issue as well as give ample evidence to support your opinion.\n\nACT vs SAT: Which Test Is Right for You?\n\nAt last, it's time to ask yourself: which test is right for you—the ACT or SAT? Here are three ways to help you make your decision.\n\nMethod 1: Take Official Practice Tests\n\nInstead of just guessing whether you'll be better at the ACT or SAT, the best way to decide is to actually take each test and then compare your scores. To do this, you'll need to find an official practice test for both the ACT and SAT. Official practice tests are the closest you can get to the real deal. Here at PrepScholar, we've got all official SAT practice tests and ACT practice tests compiled for your convenience.\n\nHere's what you'll do: choose one official practice test for each exam and then decide on the days you'll take them. As a reminder, each test takes approximately four hours, so make sure you set aside enough time to complete each test without interruption. Do not take the tests on the same day or even two days in a row. In addition, make sure that you're taking the tests in a quiet place and are timing yourself accordingly (as you would be timed on the actual exams).\n\nOnce you've completed both practice tests, calculate your ACT and SAT scores using your practice tests' respective scoring guides and then compare your scores. The easiest way to compare your scores is to convert your total ACT test score to a total SAT test score using our handy conversion system.\n\nAlternatively, you can compare percentiles for your ACT and SAT scores to see on which test your percentile was higher. In the end, whichever test you scored higher on is the one you should ultimately prep for and use for college admissions.\n\nIf your ACT and SAT scores are nearly or exactly the same, you'll probably perform equally well on either test. So it's up to you, then, to decide whether you'd like to try taking both tests, or whether you'd prefer to take just one. For more information, read our guide on who should consider taking both the ACT and SAT.\n\nMethod 2: Take an SAT vs ACT Quiz\n\nAnother way you can determine which test is right for you is to take a short quiz. In the chart below, check whether you agree or disagree with each statement.\n\nNow, count up your check marks in each column to find out what your score means.\n\nMostly Agrees — The SAT is your match!\n\nIf you agreed with most or all of the above statements, the SAT is what you've been looking for. With the SAT, you'll have more time for each question and won't need to deal with a pesky science section or a ton of geometry questions.\n\nMostly Disagrees — The ACT's the one for you!\n\nIf you disagreed with most or all of the statements, you'll most likely prefer the ACT over the SAT. On the ACT, you'll never have to come up with your own answers to math problems, and you get to let your opinion shine in your writing.\n\nEqual Agrees and Disagrees — Either test will work!\n\nIf you checked \"Agree\" and \"Disagree\" an equal number of times, either the ACT or SAT will suit you. Unless you decide to take both, I suggest taking official ACT and SAT practice tests (as described in #1 above) to see which test's format you're ultimately more comfortable with.\n\nMethod 3: Consider Your State's Testing Requirements\n\nLastly, don't forget to find out whether your state has any specific testing requirements. Some states require all high school students to take the ACT or SAT. In these cases, it's usually best to stick with whatever test is required for your state so that you don't need to study for the other test, too.\n\nThere are 11 states that require the ACT:\n\nAlabama\n\nHawaii\n\nKentucky\n\nMississippi\n\nMontana\n\nNebraska\n\nNevada\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nUtah\n\nWisconsin\n\nWyoming\n\nAnd there are 10 states that require the SAT:\n\nColorado\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nMaine\n\nMichigan\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRhode Island\n\nWest Virginia\n\nIn addition, Idaho, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, and Tennessee require a test as part of the graduation process, but these states allow you to choose the SAT or the ACT.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nWant more comparisons of the ACT and SAT?
