Moderate price range of $12-$18 U.S. for a complete dinner. Not only was the food and ambiance a delight, but the family hostess was very friendly and warm. The town of Le Quesnox is a marvel to behold, with 15th-Century fortifications, moats and cobblestone roads. The surrounding countryside offers ideal camping facilities with a beautiful lake. This is in northern France. The restaurant: Le Relais de l’Escale, 155 Route de Valenciennes, 59530 Le Quesnox.”\n\nFrance--David Epstein, Irvine: Enjoyed Chez Franckie, 95 Rue La Bourgade, Haute de Cagnes. “Fewer than a dozen tables, and guests are made to feel very welcome by the owner.”\n\nIreland--Ralph Pierre, LaVerne: “Greatest B&B; in the world is Hawthorne Farm. Only about $18 per person. Near Kenmare, Killarney and the Ring of Kerry. On a fishing stream. Food is great. Write to Kitty Dineen, Hawthorne Farm, Kilgarvan, County Kerry. Kitty is a delight, as is her little granddaughter, Sheila. This B&B; is the greatest.”\n\nEngland--Mrs. George Middleton, Carpinteria: Enjoyed The Elizabethan Restaurant, 18 Jenery St., Winchester. “Has enormous character, dates from the 16th Century. Food is delicious, prices reasonable, the maitre d’ is gracious and friendly.”\n\nEngland--Donald Miller, Long Beach: “A wonderful bed and breakfast guest house, The Shamrock, 11 Wearbay Road, East Cliff, Folkestone, Kent. Ask for a room overlooking the ocean. What a lovely view. Rates are a very reasonable, about $41 U.S. double and about $20 U.S. single.
