        "text": "Want to improve your English and have fun? Why not read an English magazine?\n\nAre you ready to discover the 25 best magazines that will help you improve your English?\n\nGreat – let’s begin then!\n\nYou can jump straight to the English magazine that interests you most using the table of contents below.\n\nOtherwise, keep scrolling to discover 25 incredible magazines in English.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. The Economist\n\nCan you guess what The Economist is about? Yes, economics! But not only that.\n\nThis magazine also focuses on global events, politics, science, technology, and culture.\n\nIt sounds like I’m talking about a newspaper, doesn’t it?\n\nWell, technically, The Economist is a British weekly newspaper printed in magazine format.\n\nImportant and well-known business people around the globe read The Economist (I wouldn’t be surprised if Elon Musk has a subscription to it) and this is why the language you’ll find in it is high-quality journalistic writing.\n\nOnce I had a student who worked as the CFO of a bank in Italy. He told me he always read The Economist because it helped him expand his advanced English vocabulary which he would then use in his financial reports and presentations.\n\nSo this is not the English magazine to read if you’d like to improve your conversational, informal, urban English.\n\nHowever, if you want to learn specialised vocabulary related to economics, politics, and science, then yes, get a copy and have fun learning.\n\nYou can read The Economist online here.\n\n2. National Geographic\n\nThis was once called The National Geographic Magazine.\n\nCan you guess when the first issue was published?\n\nI’ll give you three options (don’t read on until you haven’t answered this question):\n\n1958\n\n1888\n\n1928\n\nThe answer is b. Yes, it’s over 100 years old! There’s a reason why this English magazine has stood the test of time: National Geographic is great!\n\nYou just need to flick through it for a few seconds to notice how beautiful and educational everything is.\n\nThe photos are taken by the most skilled photographers in the world. And the articles, too, are written by the best writers.\n\nBut what’s National Geographic about? Wildlife, archaeology, environmental issues, and cultural studies. Given that these are the main topics, the language you'll find is rich and descriptive.\n\nSo if you’d like to expand your descriptive vocabulary and you’re also into nature, exploration, and world culture, then National Geographic is a must.\n\nYou can read some National Geographic articles online here.\n\n3. Speak Up\n\nThis magazine is produced for learners of English based in Italy and Spain. I read and translated the About page of the Speak Up Italian website.\n\nThis is what it says:\n\n“Forget about grammatical rules and long lists to memorize. With Speak Up you’ll immerse yourself in the English spoken in the media by reading and listening to articles and interviews with famous people. You’ll improve your reading comprehension, listening, and pronunciation. You’ll expand your vocabulary with current terms, neologisms, trending concepts, idioms, and colloquial expressions.”\n\nSpeak Up\n\nThis is a special English magazine because it's designed with English learners in mind so the articles are classified and tagged according to the level of difficulty.\n\nThis is how they’re categorised:\n\nPre-intermediate: Articles with common phrases in English and simple expressions.\n\nLower-intermediate: Standard language articles on a wide variety of topics.\n\nUpper-intermediate: Complex texts on both concrete and abstract topics.\n\nAdvanced: Long texts with a higher level of complexity that includes colloquial expressions and English idioms.\n\nProficiency: Long articles with a complex structure featuring diverse descriptions and topics, and a rich and creative vocabulary.\n\nBut there’s more: most of the articles in Speak Up are available in audio format so you can listen to them while reading the text. This will help you improve both your listening skills and English pronunciation.\n\nGet a subscription to Speak Up here\n\n4. Babel\n\n“Love language? Love Babel.”\n\nThis is what you read on page 1 of Babel, a popular language magazine written by experts in languages and linguistics whose mission is to bring you the latest linguistics research.\n\nBut you don’t have to be a language expert to appreciate this magazine. Everything is explained in an accessible and colourful format.\n\nBabel is published every four months and each issue contains regular features. Some of these are:\n\nThe linguistic lexicon: a section that explores linguistic terms such as “connotation” or “catenative verbs”.\n\nLanguages of the world: this introduces you to languages spoken around the globe.\n\nAsk a linguist: a section where a linguist answers your questions on anything and everything about languages and linguistics.\n\nThe team behind Babel is so generous that they give access to their “Best Of” issue for free, which includes the best features taken from across their first 32 issues.\n\nYou can read it here and then decide if this is a magazine for you.\n\n5. Forbes\n\nThis is another well-known magazine that’s been around for over a century.\n\nBefore I tell you what you can expect to find in it, let’s see if you can guess the answer to this trivia question: Where does Forbes take its name from?\n\nThree options:\n\nThe person who founded it\n\nA car\n\nA Greek word\n\nHave you made your guess?\n\nOkay, Forbes was founded in 1917 by Bertie Charles Forbes, a Scottish-American financial journalist who then remained the magazine's editor-in-chief until 1954.\n\nBut let’s come back to the present. Today, Forbes is published eight times a year and is one of the most popular business magazines in the world.\n\nThe articles you’ll find in it are about a wide variety of topics such as finance, investing, marketing, technology, communications, science, politics, and law.\n\nWhat’s true for The Economist is also true for Forbes: this isn’t a magazine you would read to improve your conversational skills but one that can help you with academic vocabulary, academic reading and writing.\n\nAn interesting thing about Forbes is that it’s known for its lists and rankings such as:\n\nThe richest Americans (the Forbes 400)\n\nThe 30 most notable young people under the age of 30 (Forbes 30 under 30)\n\nAmerica's Wealthiest Celebrities\n\nThe world's top companies (the Forbes Global 2000)\n\nThe World's Most Powerful People\n\nThe World's Billionaires\n\nIf you’re especially interested in American culture and business, well, you should also be interested in getting your eyes on Forbes.\n\n6. English NOW\n\nLe plaisir d'apprendre l'anglais tout en se divertissant.\n\nThat’s French for “The pleasure of learning English while having fun” and it’s what English NOW, a bimonthly 48-page magazine specially written for learners of English based in France, will help you to do.\n\nEnglish NOW offers a variety of articles and topics but you’ll also find vocabulary, grammar, and tests. Remember SpeakUp (no. 3 on this list)?\n\nEnglish NOW is similar to that because each article is categorised according to its level of difficulty as well as which English-speaking country it focuses on (United Kingdom, United States, Australia, etc.).\n\nIf you subscribe, you can get your magazine articles read by native speakers with different accents. You’ll also get interactive exercises that focus on all four language skills, multimedia content, and teacher bonuses (if you’re a teacher).\n\nOui mon ami, c'est un super magazine si tu veux améliorer ton anglais!\n\nFind out more about English NOW here.\n\n7. Time\n\nYou may already know about this American magazine as it’s one of the most influential and authoritative sources of news.\n\nBut let’s see if you can guess which of these statements about it is false:\n\nTime was published weekly for nearly a century.\n\nThere are European, Asian, and South Pacific editions of Time.\n\nThere are editions of Time written in easy English specifically for learners like you.\n\nWhich one is false?\n\nI’m afraid to say that the answer is C: at the moment, there are no versions of Time written for learners of English. But don’t worry. If you already have strong English reading skills, Time can help you expand your vocabulary in the context of current events and global issues.\n\nMost of what you’ll read in Time revolves around current political, social, economic, and cultural events around the globe.\n\nYou may also like the TIME 100 list, an annual list that presents the 100 most influential people in the world such as leaders, creators, and innovators.\n\nTIME 100 is actually one of my favourite things to read!\n\nCheck out TIME magazine here.\n\n8. VOA Learning English\n\nVoice of America (VOA) is the largest American international broadcaster.\n\nTheir content is targeted at proficient-level English speakers but they also have a website, VOA Learning English, for learners of English like you.\n\nOkay, technically, VOA Learning English isn’t a magazine in the sense that it doesn’t have regular issues that are published every week or every month.\n\nBut you can consider it as an online magazine for learners because its website features many news articles about a variety of topics.\n\nThis is what the VOA Learning English’s About page says:\n\nLearning English is VOA’s multimedia source of news and information for millions of English learners worldwide.\n\nVOA Learning English\n\nTheir articles are categorised into three levels: Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced. The cool thing about them is that you can also listen to the articles through the audio player that’s on every webpage.\n\nCheck out their “intermediate level” page to see how it works.\n\n9. Wired\n\nAre you a technophobe (=a​ person who is afraid of, dislikes or avoids new technology) or a techie (=a person who is expert in or enthusiastic about technology)?\n\nIn either case, Wired is worth checking out.\n\nWhy? Because Wired is a monthly American magazine that focuses on how emerging technologies affect culture, the economy, and politics.\n\nSo, if you’re a technophobe, you’ll find plenty of articles that will show you why you shouldn’t be afraid of technology.\n\nAnd if you’re a techie, you may find articles that will make you reconsider your enthusiasm for new technologies!\n\nReading Wired is also a great way to expand your vocabulary around the topic of technology and culture. You can start today by reading their online articles on their website.\n\nCheck out Wired here.\n\n10. Language Magazine\n\nLanguage Magazine is a monthly publication that provides cutting-edge information for language learners, educators, and professionals around the world. Through promoting multicultural learning, global citizenship, and language education, Language Magazine provides well-researched insight on the literacy and language sphere of education.\n\nLanguage Magazine\n\nThis is what the About page of Language Magazine says. So you may like this magazine if you’re a teacher or a learner who’s into language research and language learning.\n\nThe editorial team also publish the full issues in an app for tablets along with a digital edition that you can view or download if you subscribe.\n\nCheck out Language Magazine here.\n\n11. The Relatable Voice Magazine\n\nThe creative director of The Relatable Voice Magazine is Lucia Matuonto, a multilingual lady from Brazil.\n\nI talked about her in my blog about English podcasts too, as Lucia is also a podcast host and a big fan of real, personal, human stories (like me!)\n\nIn her magazine, you’ll find interesting interviews with a variety of people, from authors, film writers, and actors, to scriptwriters, songwriters, and content writers.\n\nThe magazine is free to read online and it’s perfect for you if you’re into media, culture, writing, books and, of course, real human stories!\n\nCheck out Relatable Voice here.\n\n12. Health\n\nHealth is an e-magazine about…erm, well, health!\n\nIt was founded in 1981 and covers health and wellness information for everyone. Fancy another pub quiz type of question?\n\nHow many people does Health reach every year?\n\nOver 120 million people\n\nLess than 100 million people\n\n1 million people\n\nThe answer is the first one.
