        "text": "When I first wrote this on another blog, I thought most language learners would be pretty sure of “which foreign language to learn.”\n\nWell, unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nThe most commonly asked questions are, “What language should I learn?”\n\nOr Which foreign language is more in demand?\n\nAnd to tell you the truth, I still find it quite challenging to answer.\n\nGone are the days when learning a foreign language is just a hobby.\n\nMore importantly, In today’s competitive, evolving, and ever-shrinking world, there’s an exponential demand for jobs that require a foreign language.\n\nThanks to the numerous career choices in languages, the importance of foreign languages has never been more valuable than today.\n\nIt’s no surprise that language learning is now regarded as a full-fledged career objective.\n\nLanguages can be broadly classified into two categories — Popular Foreign Languages Vs. Less spoken Languages.\n\nThere are primarily three main confusions:\n\nAmong European — French Vs. Spanish Vs. German,\n\nBetween East Asian — Chinese Vs. Japanese Vs. Korean,\n\nAmongst West Asian — Arabic, Persian, and Turkish.\n\n“You live a new life for every language you speak. If you know only one language, you live only once.”\n\nCzech proverb\n\nPicking the right language to learn can be a daunting task.\n\nThe answer to the question will, of course, be different depending on your intention and circumstances.\n\nOnce you have a definite idea of learning any language, the number of language options will decline significantly.\n\nAre you planning to immigrate to Canada and want to make yourself more employable?\n\nThen, your best foreign language to learn will be different than if you have an interest in K-Drama and K-Pop.\n\nIn other words, from a learner’s perspective, you must look at the numerous reasons and plans.\n\nGlobalization has made all businesses international to some extent, and adding language skills is a great value add to your resume.\n\nIt will help if you consider several factors when choosing a foreign language: difficulty level, interest, personal preference, industries, possible immigration, future goals, etc.\n\nWhether you’re interested in improving your career opportunities or seeking international employment. Or perhaps enhancing your business drive, looking for adventure, or just trying to check off your bucket list.\n\nThere are countless reasons to learn a new language.\n\n10 Best Foreign Languages to Learn in India\n\nAll of the foreign tongues listed here are vital.\n\nSo, if you are wondering which foreign language is in demand in India.\n\nHere, we have listed 10 of the best international language you can learn in India if you intend to remain competent and relevant in today’s job market.\n\nSo here we go.\n\n1. French (Français)\n\nFrench is the most popular foreign language in India, and the reasons to learn French are apparent.\n\nWith over 30 Francophone countries around the globe, It is spoken by roughly 300 million French speakers globally.\n\nAccording to Forbes, 750 million French speakers will be worldwide by 2050.\n\nFrench continues to be a top choice among Indian students at the school and University levels.\n\nIt contributes over 50% of original words to the English language. Hence, Indians fancy it so much as it becomes relatively easier to learn.\n\nThanks to a wide range of Jobs in the French language, the benefits are pretty amazing. Plus, the language offers plenty of career possibilities.\n\nWant to study in France?\n\nWithin Europe, France is the third most popular destination for international students, including India.\n\nAnother reason is India’s craze about Canada, where French is one of the two official languages.\n\nYou can score extra points on your visa to Canada if you appear for the TEF or TCF Exam.\n\nFrench also provides you a run-through, vibrant culture and customs, which is very intriguing.\n\nBesides, suppose you’re interested in embassy jobs, the export-import business, or wish to make a career as a language teacher. In that case, French will be an asset to your CV.\n\nFrench is a language of international excellence—the official language of many international organizations like the UNO, EU, AU, NATO, FIFA, IOC, ISA, etc.\n\nIt will benefit you if you are interested in pharmaceuticals, energy production, information technology, aeronautics, fashion, and telecommunications.\n\nStill not sure which foreign language to choose?\n\nI will make it easy for you — learn French.\n\n2. German (Deutsch)\n\nAfter French, German is the second most popular foreign language among Indians.\n\nIt is spoken by over 100 million native speakers and a total of 185 million speakers worldwide. It is also the most spoken native language of Europe.\n\nBesides, German is the second most commonly used language on the internet.\n\nThere is a myriad of reasons to learn German.\n\nIt is easier than French but has more challenging syntax than Spanish.\n\nMany schools and Colleges in India have listed German as an optional and, in some cases, compulsory subject to study.\n\nIt becomes essential to contemplate acquiring German because the demand is increasing, and you will need to be more competitive.\n\nNo surprise, Zertifikat Deutsch test seats are quickly filled in India.\n\nGermany is Europe’s largest economy, the fourth-largest by nominal GDP globally, and the world’s second-largest exporter, making it a crucial language to learn.\n\nThe scope of learning German is full of lucrative salaries and immense job opportunities.\n\nDo you want to pursue further studies or do business in Germany, Switzerland, or Austria? Or enhance your job prospects in engineering, automobile, power and utility, management, medical, and healthcare?\n\nWell, German is an excellent selection for such options.\n\nGerman is hard to beat if you’re interested in literature, classical music, arts, psychology, or philosophy.\n\n3. Spanish (Español)\n\nWhy Learn Spanish?\n\nBeing the official language of 20 countries, Spanish is the lingua franca of Spain and most Central and South American countries.\n\nAs per the study of Cervantes, There are roughly 572 million Spanish-speaking populations worldwide.\n\nWith over 50 million Spanish speakers, the USA is now the second-largest Hispanic-speaking country After Mexico.\n\nSpanish is probably one of the most natural languages to learn for Indians.\n\nSpanish syntax and grammar are simple so much that their vocabulary is highly similar to English.\n\nYou can pronounce most Spanish words with little effort.\n\nHowever, some of the tenses, verb irregularities, synonyms for vocabulary, and Spanish dialects are more complicated and time-consuming to learn in Spanish than in European languages like French or German.\n\nArmed with suitable methodology, proper guidance, and regular practice, you can pass the Spanish Proficiency Test, i.e., B2 or C1 of the DELE or SIELE Test, in 2-3 years.\n\nBilateral and diplomatic relations between India and countries in Latin America are growing like a California wildfire, so there is a surge in demand for Spanish in India.\n\nWhile there are various career options in Spanish, one most sought-after choices is foreign language jobs in BPO, KPO, and call centers.\n\nIf you don’t want to be left behind in the future scheme of things (especially in the translators, diplomats, teachers, and travel career prospect fields).\n\nIt is one of the best foreign languages to learn for jobs.\n\n4. Japanese (日本語 / Nihongo)\n\nIf you are perplexed, “Which east Asian language should I learn” or in case you are still wondering which foreign language is best for a career.\n\nWell, then, learn Japanese.\n\nThere is a reason why the Japanese are in high demand in India—the skyrocketing increase in trade between India and Japan.\n\nWith over 130 million native speakers, Japanese is one of the most commonly spoken languages globally.\n\nAs of October 2018, the number of Japanese companies and businesses operating in India has increased to 1,441.\n\nSince most Japanese are shy to speak a different language, they always look for reliable Japanese translators and interpreters.\n\nThe ability to speak fluently could significantly increase your job advancement involving Japanese in India and abroad.\n\nAfter learning Japanese, the career scope is full of employment possibilities if you can reach a higher Japanese test like JLPT N2/N1.\n\nJapanese has a reputation for being difficult to learn. But don’t worry. It’s not hard at all if you practice regularly.\n\nOnce you’ve mastered Hiragana, Katakana, and at least 1500 Kanji, a bright future is waiting for you.\n\nAre you thinking, “which foreign language is highly paid for in India?”\n\nYou will then be glad to know that Japanese is also ranked as one of the highest paying foreign language jobs.\n\nBesides, the Indian Government is already planning to incorporate Japanese into the secondary school curriculum, which will further increase demand for the language in the future.\n\nAnime, Nintendo, Sudoku, karaoke, sushi, manga, martial arts, Sony PlayStation, origami, Hello Kitty, and more – think about how many products from Japan enrich our daily lives.\n\nIf you are into anything robotic, Japanese is worth learning.\n\n5. Mandarin Chinese (普通话 / Pǔtōnghuà)\n\nWith more than 20.70% of speakers (considering the Chinese population), Mandarin is the world’s most widely spoken native tongue.\n\nOne in every five people in the world speaks Chinese. It might take time, but Mandarin is the language of the future.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean Mandarin is among the three most popular tongues among Indians, as it comes from a different language root.\n\nBut considering its career prospects, especially with China’s role in the global economy.\n\nThen, learning Mandarin will conveniently open doors for Mandarin speakers in the business world.\n\nThe fact that the number of people learning Mandarin in India is less makes them even more ideal for career-minded individuals.\n\nThus, having this skill can give you great job and business opportunities in India and worldwide. Another good thing about learning Chinese is that most prefer German, French, or Spanish to Chinese due to its complexity.\n\nThat’s why it is beneficial if you don’t want to face too much competition in the future. Therefore, Mandarin plays a vital role in the export and import industry.\n\nJobs requiring Chinese are in demand and accepted everywhere. And this is why the HSK test is gaining popularity.\n\n6. Korean (한국어 / Hangugeo)\n\nProbably something “Korean” is already present in your home—from LG, Samsung, Hyundai, etc. The Indian market is one of the most prominent destinations for Korean export products and services.\n\nThere is an enormous impact on the Korean bilateral relationship with India. From all indications, this trend will continue for many more years.\n\nKorean companies operate in almost every sector, i.e., Information Technology, business research, consumer electronics, R&D, life sciences, media, automobiles, tourism, construction industry, trading, finance, services, etc.\n\nThe scope of the Korean language as a career is awe-inspiring.\n\nMost people are learning Korean in India because of K-Pop, K-Dramas, and K-Movies.\n\nMany young people worldwide are fascinated by K-pop artists such as Big Bang, BTS, Girls Generation, and more. The Hallyu (Korean Wave) has become a truly worldwide phenomenon appealing and entertaining to all ages.\n\nAll of these accelerated people’s interest in studying Korean.\n\nAlthough, like Japanese, Korean appears to be not such a popular language to many Indians.\n\nIt is the main reason there are not many Korean learning centers in India.\n\nWhether you plan to study in South Korea or give your career a boost, you should aim for at least Level V of the TOPIK exam.\n\nWhatever reason you have for picking up Korean, you won’t regret it.\n\n7. Arabic (عربى / Al-‘Arabiyyah)\n\nIf you are one of those simpletons who think Arabic is the language of Muslims.\n\nAs if Non-Muslims don’t speak Arabic. You must be missing out on great opportunities.\n\nArabic is becoming an influential language in India and outside to operate an international business trying to break into foreign markets.\n\nMost of the Arabic-speaking economies are very rich and are developing at a fast pace.\n\nWe are talking about the language of more than 25 countries.\n\nWith the Middle East a hotbed of economic wealth and business opportunities—from oil and gas to tourism/travel and more business transactions, Arabic per Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, UAE, Qatar, Egypt, Iraq, and more, plays a critical role in the global scheme of things.\n\nSo, this fact alone makes Arabic one of the most important languages on the planet.\n\nYour Arabic will open you to opportunities in a region with a growth rate of 120% in the last five years.\n\nThe sectors like IT, Publishing, Aviation, Education, Finance & Banking, Hospitality & Tourism, business, and industries in India are looking for people who speak Arabic.\n\nAs the Middle East continues to accelerate in development, it has also attracted substantial investment opportunities.\n\nJob opportunities in the Middle East and other parts of the world are another career motivator why many Indians want to learn the Arabic language in India.\n\n8. Russian (русский / Rússkiy)\n\nWhy learn Russian in India of all choices?\n\nRussian is among the six official languages of the UNO and is also widely used on the internet and commonly spoken in 26 countries.\n\nWith over 150 million native speakers in Russia, Ukraine, and neighboring countries, It is Eurasia’s most geographically widespread language and the largest native language in Europe.\n\nSuppose you’re interested in Travel and Tourism as an Indian businessperson. In that case, Kerala and Goa are well-known destinations for Russian tourists that bring millions of dollars to the Indian economy annually.\n\nAnd as the trend continues, it becomes clearer that India will need a more Russian-proficient workforce to cater to the continuous influx of Russian-speaking tourists.\n\nBesides, most Indians view Russia positively as a friend of India.\n\nYou can use your Russian skills to help people learn more in coaching classes about traveling to Russia, working, or doing business over there.\n\nBy learning Russian, you can explore many engineering, Science & Technology, Oil & Gas, and defense sectors.\n\nOnce upon a time, Russian was one of India’s most popular foreign languages.\n\nEventually, it became less popular after the breakdown of the USSR.\n\nA loss of interest accompanied the decline of Russia’s superpower status. Lately, the Russian Government has introduced several measures to remedy the situation.\n\nWell, only time will tell.\n\n9. Portuguese (Português)\n\nWhile you might think Portugal when you think Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese is the official language of Brazil.\n\nWith more than 250 million speakers worldwide, Portuguese is the sixth most extensively spoken globally, making it one of the top 10 major foreign languages to learn in India.\n\nPortuguese ruled Goa from 1510 to 1961.\n\nGoa is the best place to learn Portuguese in India thanks to Portuguese-speaking locals, and many Lusophone activities, including the screening of Portuguese films, cultural programs, music concerts, events, seminars, and many more.\n\nFor Indians, the career prospects in Portuguese are glaring.\n\nMany Indian companies, like Allegis, IBM, Amazon, Accenture, etc., are looking for people proficient in Portuguese.\n\nThe demand for Portuguese language specialists in MNC is on the rise and valuable in various industries like Finance, Technology, Accounts, Export-Import, Technical Support, IT/ITES, Tourism, and Education.\n\nThere is also the scope for impressive expansion of business and trade relations between India and Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking countries).\n\nAlthough Spanish remains a priority for most Indian learners, the demand for Portuguese is rising as well.\n\nIt is because Portuguese is the official language in Brazil, which is an emerging economy.\n\nBesides, the tongue shares a similar linguistic structure with Spanish, making learning more relevant.\n\nSo, if you choose to learn one of these languages, you can study the other.\n\n10. Italian (Italiano)\n\nYou may have the universe if I may have Italy.\n\nGiuseppe Verdi\n\nDo you want to learn Italian in India?\n\nWell, I certainly do.\n\nI’ve always wanted to learn Italian, but somehow, I could never start.\n\nFinally, I have added to my bucket list, with a target to achieve conversational fluency by the end of 2024.\n\nThe fascinating culture, delicious cuisine, exhilarating history, melodic accents, and notable historic places happen to be my reasons.\n\nItalian is one of the languages most studied for culture and pleasure because of its extraordinary richness and strength.\n\nThe Creator made Italy by designs from Michelangelo.\n\nMark Twain\n\nThe Italian language holds immense importance. A recent study by KPMG has shown that “Made in Italy” is the third most recognized brand globally.\n\nBesides, Italy is one of the world’s wealthiest countries, with its economy ranking 8th overall.\n\nFamous Italian MNCs like Fiat, Diesel, Gucci, Pinnacle, Bennetton, Marconi, and Lloyd operate in India. These companies are actively looking for Italian speakers.\n\nIf you work in construction machinery, robotics, graphic design, culinary arts, interior design, furniture design, manufacturing tools, shipbuilding, space engineering, fashion, and transportation equipment. Then, you will find Italian as career asset at the top of their resume.\n\nThanks to globalization, outsourcing, and offshore, you will find plenty of new job openings in plenty of MNC, IT, KPO and BPO, and KPO.\n\nWhile Italian pronunciation is tricky, It is not a difficult language to master.\n\nIt will surprise you that Romance languages like Spanish and French share more than 70% of lexical resemblance with Italian.\n\nIt is why it is encouraging Indians to study Italian.\n\nPass higher-level Italian language proficiency tests like CELI or CILS if you already know Spanish or French.\n\nHow much time is needed to learn?\n\nHow much time is required to learn a language will depend on three things.\n\nThe language difficulty, How you are studying, and the proficiency you want to achieve.\n\nLower Advanced levels like B2 in European Languages or JLPT N2 / TOPIK V / HSK V in the East Asian tongues will take anywhere between 2 to 4 years.\n\nOut of Top 10 foreign languages mentioned in this list, Mandarin Chinese is probably the most difficult language to learn for Indians.\n\nAnd “which is the easiest foreign language to learn in India” or for English speakers?\n\nScandinavian languages like Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish are easiest for Indians and English-speaking people.\n\nThe most quoted research of FSI studies confirms the same.\n\nSince these languages are not on this list, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian would be the three simplest languages to learn about Indians.\n\nSpanish, Italian, Portuguese — 2 Years.\n\nGerman, French, Russian — 3 years.\n\nMandarin, Korean, Japanese, Arabic — 4 years.\n\nThe duration is based on the assumption that you will remain devout, on average, 15 hours per week. The target is at least a lower Advanced level. Take the term only as a reference since it depends on several factors, including methods for learning language, effort, teacher, learning style, and your own natural learning ability.\n\nConclusion (Final Words)\n\nKnowing what language to learn is an important decision that only you can make.\n\nIt depends on what you feel is right, what you want, and your plans for the future.\n\nAll the foreign languages listed here are beneficial, provided you commit time and resources to learn them. Once done, you will unquestionably find it helpful.\n\nWhich foreign language to learn is a too subjective topic and harder to answer. Mastering a new language takes time and patience.\n\nI want to suggest you choose as per your future objective, job market, and interest. You can also learn the language you like.\n\nWhen I am talking about ‘finding the reason.’ I’m referring to an overarching goal that drives you. Lack of purpose and motivation is the primary reason for language learning failure.\n\nThe purpose or goal is the best way to become motivated enough to learn a language. You will also enjoy the learning process.\n\nDon’t believe everything you hear. There are tons of language learning myths. Read, think, pay attention, and choose the one that suits you.\n\nWhich Foreign Language do you want to learn?\n\nLet us know in the comments what your first pick is! If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask!"
