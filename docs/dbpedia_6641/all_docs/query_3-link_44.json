        "text": "Click any of the questions below to reveal Rick’s responses.\n\nYou were a teacher for a long time. Why did you leave the classroom?\n\nThat was a hard decision. I love teaching. I love working with kids. For many years, I taught full-time and wrote a book a year in the Tres Navarre mystery series.\n\nWhen I sold the Percy Jackson series to Disney Book Group, I realized that I’d now have to write two books a year to keep up with my deadlines — one adult book, and one children’s book. I just didn’t think I’d be able to keep up that pace and do a good job in the classroom, so I made the reluctant decision to leave teaching.\n\nThe good part is, I still get to work with kids as a children’s author. Hopefully, I’ll be able to get more kids interested in reading mythology with my books than I ever did as a teacher.\n\nDid you students know you wrote novels, and what did they think about that?\n\nWe never talked about it much in the classroom, but most of them were aware that I wrote books. I suppose they thought it was cool, but they had a lot of other stuff to think about, being in middle school. Homework, peer pressure, who likes whom — all these tend to take priority over what their teacher does.\n\nThey would often say, \"Wow, you write books? Can I be a character?\" And I did frequently use names of former students for my characters, but the kids were always surprised how long it took to get a name into print. If I meet a student in middle school, he/she will probably be in high school by the time the book is actually written and in the bookstores.\n\nMy favorite comment from a student: I assigned a five-page paper, and he rolled his eyes and said, \"Mr. Riordan, just because you write books doesn’t mean we have to.\" I laughed, but he still had to write the essay.\n\nAnother thing about my books and my students: When I first started writing adult mysteries, it never occurred to me that my middle school students would ask if they could read them. I always told them no — wait until you’re older. The adult books really aren’t appropriate for younger readers. Of course, many of the kids took that as a challenge and immediately went to the bookstore. I could always tell when a kid had read one of my Tres Navarre books because he would come to class with a funny light in his eyes, like, \"Wow, Mr. Riordan, I didn’t know you were such a rebel.\" I’m glad I have the Percy Jackson series to recommend to kids now, so I don’t have that dilemma anymore.\n\nWhere did you get the idea for Percy Jackson?\n\nMy son Haley asked me to tell him some bedtime stories about the Greek gods and heroes. I had taught Greek myths for many years at the middle school level, so I was glad to comply. When I ran out of myths, he was disappointed and asked me if I could make up something new with the same characters.\n\nI thought about it for a few minutes. Then I remembered a creative writing project I used to do with my sixth graders — I would let them create their own demigod hero, the son or daughter of any god they wanted, and have them describe a Greek-style quest for that hero. Off the top of my head, I made up Percy Jackson and told Haley all about his quest to recover Zeus’ lightning bolt in modern day America. It took about three nights to tell the whole story, and when I was done, Haley told me I should write it out as a book.\n\nI had a lot to do already, but I somehow found the time to write the first Percy Jackson book over the next year. I just really enjoyed writing it. The story was such fun, and so different from my adult fiction, that I found myself spending a lot of time on it. Now, I’m sure glad I did!\n\nDid you share the percy Jackson novel with any of your students before it was published?\n\nYes. Once my son heard the manuscript and said it was great, I wanted to be sure it would interest older kids — the middle school ages that I taught. I picked a few of my sixth, seventh and eighth graders and asked them if they’d be willing to \"test drive\" the novel. I was nervous! I’m used to showing my work to adults, but I had no idea if kids would like Percy. I finally understood what it must be like for them, turning in an essay to me and waiting to get their grades back!\n\nFortunately, the kids really liked it. They had some good suggestions, too. They helped me pick the best title for the book. They also had some good ideas on how Percy should act if he had ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). One student helped me refine the way Percy’s sword, Anaklusmos, worked.\n\nI’m very glad I showed the novel to kids first. After all, that’s who it’s written for.\n\nDid you always know you wanted to be a writer? How did you get started?\n\nI wrote a lot of short stories when I was young, and even sent a few in (to get rejected). My very first rejection note was from Isaac Asimov Science Fiction Magazine in 1978.\n\nI was never serious about writing in college. I focused most of my creative energy on music, and was lead singer in a folk rock band, if you can believe it.\n\nAfter college, I became a teacher, and was quite happy with the idea of doing that the rest of my life. However, I read a lot of mystery books in my spare time, and when my wife and I moved to San Francisco, I started missing Texas.\n\nI decided, on a lark, that I would try writing a hard-boiled private eye novel set in my hometown of San Antonio. Ten months later, Big Red Tequila was finished.\n\nThe strange thing is, I had a feeling that Big Red Tequila was going to get published. It just felt different than anything else I’d ever written, because the novel had practically forced me to write it. The idea took me by the throat and wouldn’t let me go until the manuscript was done.\n\nI tell aspiring writers that you have to find what you MUST write. When you find it, you will know, because the subject matter won’t let you go. It’s not enough to write simply because you think it would be neat to be published. You have to be compelled to write. If you’re not, nothing else that you do matters.\n\nFor me, that meant getting away from home for a while and learning to appreciate what I knew, before I could follow the old axiom, \"Write about what you know.\"\n\nPercy Jackson felt the same way Big Red Tequila did. Percy was a character who just insisted on springing to life.\n\nHow did you get published for the first time?\n\nThe time I spent waiting to get published was mercifully brief compared to some. I’ll be the first to admit I was lucky. However, the process I went through was the same as it is for many writers.\n\nOnce I had a completed manuscript, I queried agents. Many said no. One said yes. The only advantage I had at this stage was that a Bay Area creative writing teacher/author had done a line edit for me. She really helped me clean up the final draft, and then let me use her name in my query letter, \"So-and-so, author of _____, suggested I contact you.\" Any foot in the door is good. Even if the agent doesn’t know the author, she knows that someone in the business has endorsed your work. For this reason, I do think it can be helpful to pay someone for a line edit, if you have someone reputable in your area. A good place to look for freelance editors would be writing institutes at your local colleges.\n\nOnce I had an agent, she began shopping the manuscript around. Many publishers said no, all for different reasons. Some loved the story and disliked the characters. Some loved the characters and disliked the story. There didn’t seem to be any consensus. Finally, however, we got an offer from Bantam Doubleday Dell, and the series was published.\n\nI finished the manuscript for Big Red Tequila just before my thirtieth birthday, June, 1994. It was published in June of 1997. So from first query letter to pub date took three years. About a year of that was after I’d signed the contract and Bantam was preparing the book for publication.\n\nAny advice for young people who want to be writers?\n\nI started writing seriously when I was in eighth grade. I had an English teacher who encouraged me to submit my work for publication.\n\nI became a middle school English teacher largely because of the impact Mrs. Pabst had on me so many years ago, and I love having the chance to encourage kids to write the way I was encouraged. That’s one of the reasons I was not anxious to leave the classroom to pursue full-time writing.\n\nThe first thing a young writer needs is a mentor who believes in his or her talent. So don’t be afraid to ask for help! Find a teacher you respect. Correspond with authors. You will find that a polite email will often get a response.\n\nSecondly, read a lot! Read everything you can get your hands on. You will learn the craft of writing by immersing yourself in the voices, styles, and structures of writers who have gone before you.\n\nThirdly, write every day! Keep a journal. Jot down interesting stories you heard. Write descriptions of people you see. It doesn’t really matter what you write, but you must keep up practice. Writing is like a sport — you only get better if you practice. If you don’t keep at it, the writing muscles atrophy.\n\nFinally, don’t get discouraged! Rejection is a part of writing, and it hurts. The trick is to keep at it. Wallpaper your room with rejection notes, if you want, but don’t give up.\n\nAre your adult mysteries appropriate for young readers?\n\nNo, they’re not designed for kids. They have adult situations, language, etc. They aren’t any worse than a typical R-rated movie, but I do not recommend them for readers under 17. I’m not sure younger readers would enjoy them anyway. They are very different from Percy Jackson.\n\nThe Lightning Thief deals with magic and the Greek gods. Are you worried about censorship?\n\nThese stories are part of our collective heritage. I certainly don’t see the harm in learning mythology. In fact, I think you have to know myths to understand where our modern culture came from. It’s part of being an educated member of society.\n\nThe Lightning Thief explores Greek mythology in a modern setting, but it does so as a humorous work of fantasy. I’m certainly not interested in changing or contradicting anyone’s religious beliefs.\n\nMy goal is to get kids interested in learning more about mythology. If censors want to challenge Percy Jackson on the grounds that it portrays the Greek gods as real, they’ll have to censor a good portion of the English curriculum in every state. Greek mythology is studied extensively from grades 1-8, not to mention the Iliad and the Odyssey in the upper grades. English literature draws heavily on Greek mythology. It always has — from Chaucer all the way to modern novels. Percy Jackson is part of that tradition. I hope it makes kids want to read — that’s the most important thing!\n\nAs with any book, I would encourage parents to read Percy Jackson and decide for themselves whether it’s right for their children. That takes time, I know, but it’s the only way to make an informed decision.\n\nHow is writing a children's book different than writing and adult book?\n\nWhen I was writing Percy Jackson, I didn’t find it much different than writing an adult Tres Navarre novel. I think kids want the same thing from a book that adults want — a fast-paced story, characters worth caring about, humor, surprises and mystery. A good book always keeps you asking questions, and makes you keep turning pages so you can find out the answers.\n\nI didn’t simplify anything to write The Lightning Thief. I didn’t worry about vocabulary or sentence length or book length or any of that. Of course, I tend to write in short, snappy sentences anyway, but I think it would be a mistake to \"write down\" to kids. They hate that. They want to be treated like intelligent and sophisticated readers, and who can blame them? I made sure the content was appropriate for young readers — after all, my own son was the first reader — but as far as the writing style, I hope Percy Jackson will be just as enjoyable for adults as it is for kids.\n\nI did my best to keep the book interesting. I taught reading for many years, and I know that kids get bored with long descriptions that go on for pages and pages. They get bored with books that don’t seem to have a clear plot. I don’t think adult readers are much different. If anything, writing a children’s book made me a better adult writer, because I forced myself to tighten up my storytelling.\n\nWhy did you choose to make Percy Jackson have ADHD and dyslexia?\n\nWhen I was writing Percy Jackson, my own son was in the process of being tested for learning differences. He was having trouble reading, and some trouble focusing in the classroom. The teachers were wondering about ADHD and dyslexia. He was frustrated about learning to read, and we had to explain to him that the testing was designed to help the teachers help him, not to make him feel bad.\n\nAs a teacher, I’ve worked with lots of kids who have learning differences. I’ve participated in testing evaluations and made modifications in my classroom. But somehow, it’s different when your child is going through the process. Eventually, my son was enrolled in the Scottish Rite program, which caters to children with reading difficulties like dyslexia. This helped a lot, but it wasn't an easy path.\n\nWhile this was happening, I did a lot of reading about dyslexia and ADHD. I especially liked the books Keeping a Head in School and Driven to Distraction. I was surprised to learn that ADHD and dyslexia frequently go together. The books also confirmed something I already knew: that dyslexic/ADHD kids are creative, \"outside-the-box\" thinkers. They have to be, because they don’t see or solve problems the same way other kids do. In school, unfortunately, they are sometimes written off as lazy, unmotivated, rude, or even stupid. They aren’t. If they can get through their rough school years, they often go on to become very successful adults. Employers love them, because they come up with original, fresh ideas. Making Percy ADHD/dyslexic was my way of honoring the potential of all the kids I’ve known who have those conditions. It’s not a bad thing to be different. Sometimes, it’s the mark of being very, very talented. That’s what Percy discovers about himself in The Lightning Thief.\n\nAs a nice 'happy ending,' my son got a master's degree in higher education and now works in the accessibility office of a local university, because he wants to make sure he can help other young people with learning differences get the accommodations they need to succeed. I'm very proud of him!\n\nNow that you're writing a children's series, will you continue to write adult books too?\n\nRight now the children’s books are keeping me very busy! Never say never, but I have no immediate plans to return to adult mysteries.\n\nWhy do you think people, and children especially, are so drawn to fantasy stories?\n\nYoung readers especially like to escape reality and slip into a fantasy world. It’s easier to read about people doing amazing things like casting spells and riding dragons that about people doing mundane things like going to school. Kids already know that life. It’s nice to pretend you are someone else once in a while.\n\nHave you ever been to Greece or Italy, or are you planning to travel there?\n\nYes, I’ve been to both Italy and Greece, but only after I finished the Percy Jackson series, which is ironic. One doesn’t need to travel there, however, to appreciate the stories from mythology. Those are quite universal.\n\nCare for the environment pops up in the Lightning Thief. Do you have any other messages for young adult readers?\n\nI don’t consciously put messages in the books, because my job is telling a good story, not preaching. However, I do pick up on themes from Greek mythology that still resonate in the modern world, and certainly man’s relationship to nature is one of those. I’ve always been fascinated by the god Pan, and his reported death in ancient times. It seemed a very relevant theme for modern readers.\n\nDo you see any of yourself in Percy Jackson?\n\nPercy has my sense of humor. Like him, I was not always a good student in school. Percy is also based on many students I have taught in the past, and partly on my son’s own struggle with ADHD/dyslexia."
