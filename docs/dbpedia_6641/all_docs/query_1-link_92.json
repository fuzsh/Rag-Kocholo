        "text": "Time Magazine, Monk and me\n\nIn February 1964, I was a 21-year-old physics student, about to get my bachelor’s degree. But for about a year, I had also served as the jazz critic for the prominent Dutch weekly Vrij Nederland, sort of a cross between The New Republic and New York Magazine.\n\nOn Saturday, February 15, Thelonious Monk was going to give a midnight concert at the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, his second visit to Holland after his two concerts in 1961. (The April 1961 concert is easy to find, but the second one, from May, is only available on the Dutch Jazz Archive CD Jackie-ing in the series Jazz at the Concertgebouw. I was one of the producers, and I also wrote the text in the booklet.)\n\nI later learned that Time Magazine had planned, and completed, a cover story on Thelonious Monk for late November 1963, but the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, in Dallas, Texas, inevitably forced the magazine to postpone it. It was rescheduled for the issue of February 28, 1964, and Time Magazine being the super-proud and super-rich publication that it was, the editors decided the cover story should be updated with news of Monk's current European tour. Therefore, I understand, Time correspondents all over Europe were instructed to cover his concerts and, if possible, to interview Monk.\n\nThe Dutch Time correspondent, Friso Endt, a well-known and respected news reporter who apparently didn't feel confident writing about jazz, asked me if I would do the job for him. I naturally said yes.\n\nI was told that an interview had been arranged for Saturday afternoon at the Amsterdam Krasnapolsky Hotel, so at the appointed time of 3.00 p.m., I entered a large, slightly sleazy hotel suite. I saw Monk sitting on a large couch, with his wife Nellie close by. He was being interviewed, believe it or not, for a hospital radio station, an extremely small-time endeavour. How they had managed to get access to Thelonious Monk is still a mystery to me. The interviewer, his recorder running, was a total amateur who asked the most trivial, stereotypical questions.\n\nNellie Monk whispered to me that I should wait until the radio interviewer was finished, so I patiently sat down. The man took another ten minutes, and by the time he was finished Monk, still sitting on the couch, had fallen asleep — understandable under the circumstances. In a soft voice, Nellie Monk suggested that we should let her husband get his rest, and I could only agree, so I left.\n\nWhat to do after this fiasco? The only thing I could think of was writing a factual report of what happened. I decided to include Monk's single interesting response to the stupid questions from the radio man. And so it happened that the cover story on Thelonious Monk in the U.S.A. edition of Time Magazine of February 28, 1964 contained, on page 87 (page 45 in the Atlantic edition), my contribution. It ran just four short lines, plus one word, in printed form:\n\nInterview on an Amsterdam radio station last week: \"Who has had the greatest influence on your playing, Mr. Monk?\" \"Well, me, of course.\"\n\nIt became the most famous and most often quoted part of the entire article.\n\nIf I remember correctly, my fee was something like 150 guilders, about 50 dollars at the time. For 23 words of copy, this must have been my best paid gig ever.\n\nBert Vuijsje"
