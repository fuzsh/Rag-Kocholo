        "text": "TIME Magazine does a great job in relation to the furniture that is being used in the publication. The one the thing that I noticed was that the publication is consistent and that would have to be the one thing that I noticed as I was analyzing the furniture of the publication.\n\nThe cover:\n\nIn the terms of the nameplate the publication always uses the same size and the nameplate is always located in the center of the page. The nameplate seems to change colors most of time but usually it will always be in red.\n\nTOC:\n\nThe table of contents gives a brief preview in what the rest of the magazine will look like. The typefaces that are used in the table of contents are the same type that are used as department or section headers. The one thing that I did notice was that each section has its own column. What I mean by that is that each section has the department and what each department is going to be about. Also, I noticed that this helps a lot with all the white space that it has on the table of contents instead of making things looking crammed the publication does a good job by making sure things are the same.\n\nAlso for this section I noticed that there always a picture in the center of the page. Also I noticed that the name is tucked in the top left hand corner in white. I think the publication did that to draw attention to an a cover story.\n\nOn the Record\n\nWith this section, magazine does several things to let the reader know which section they are in. On the left page called The Record, it is kind of like an introduction to the newsier section of the publication. For on the Record the publication places the section label inside the margin at the top left. Also, in this section a lot of treatment is being done by letting the reader know that this section is more like an infographic. In this section instead of just text and photos this section has a lot of illustrations and numbers to represent the content that is being presented like the examples below. This style of the page leads to the next section of the magazine called the brief.\n\nThe Brief:\n\nThe one thing that is dominate in every issue would have to be is that there is photo in the department front of the page. The one that separates the department front from how it looked in the table of contents is that it is bigger and bolder helping to draw attention to which section of the magazine the reader is going to read next.\n\nAlso on the opening spread of the department front the photo credits are located in inside the photo. This does not draw to much attention but it gives the reader a que in what they will expect on the next. In this case this would have to be in which the words are bold, a photo is full bleed and the the teasers for the section are located at the bottom of the page. For the this section, for label, the same style that was applied on the table of contents is located at the top of the page.\n\nFor the news briefs it is located in one column. Also I noticed that to separate certain sections the color red is used to separate some of the content that is used. A final thing thing that I noticed was that with the letter t in the it seems to create an arrow. That seems to be continued through out the publication.\n\nThe View:\n\nThis section breaks the mold in how this section is treated. The one thing that it does differently is the front if the department. Instead of having a full bleed image, it has text which is a quote.\n\nThe features:\n\nThe features in the issue seem to be politics and technology. Each story or topic is located at the top left hand corner.\n\nBylines,Quotes, Cutliine and Captions\n\nTo make the bylines stand out the publication makes the bylines a different color.\n\nI think the magazine does this as a way to separate the byline from the body copy. For the captions the one thing that I noticed is that the captions are always in italics . The quotes are either in red, in italics , in black or the quotation marks will be in red. An example in what a caption might look like is located below. Also sometimes the captions will take place of the folios and the page number. Finally, for cutlines the words are usually in italics.\n\nDropcaps, Dingbats, jump elements and icons/graphics\n\nIn the publication the magazine does a good job in how it is trying to display the drop-caps. As I was looking through the publication, I noticed that with the features in the story there is a drop-caps of the first letter of the first sentence.\n\nIn relation to the jump elements on the page the publication does this by having a triangle box that is not that close to the text. To keep up with the consistency the dingbats are only located for the long feature stories and the dingbats are always red. Finally for the jump elements, they are not really used in the publication. When using icons and graphics the magazine does several things. The one thing that it does is that the graphics are created with TIME’s color palate of red, black and gray. I have some examples of those below.\n\nFurniture conclusion:\n\nTIME uses the same style in how it wants it publication to look like. From the department fronts to the quotes, its furniture makes the publication unique. Also to keep up with the consistency the dates and the folios are always in the same place. The date is on lower corner on the left page. The page number is located on the lower right hand page. One issue is that the publication has a hard time explaining which section is the features because there no indication where the feature story starts. Also its uses a photo as from of furniture to let the reader know what section they are in. Finally, TIME magazine does a good job with it’s furniture because they make it simple."
