        "text": "Top 50 media outlets\n\n1\n\nCNN\n\nSince its inception in 1980, CNN has become the most-watched news channel in the world, reaching 212 countries and 347 million households. It is one of the most visited news sites. It has the distinction of being the first television channel in history to serve 24-hour news - a staple feature now of many prominent news outlets and a cultural phenomenon in its own right.\n\nWith over 200 million unique monthly visitors, CNN's digital presence has proven impressive since it launched in 1995, often achieving more visits than purely online news outlets. In recent years, it has become known for its stinging criticism of former President Trump and is seen by many as foundational to creating the phrase “fake news.”\n\n2\n\nBBC News\n\nBBC stands for British Broadcasting Corporation. It is the benchmark of British news reporting and broadcast services. It is an institution informing our understanding of world events and becoming one of the most respected news organizations in the world. Covering domestic and international news, it has a vast network of correspondents and bureaus worldwide and is famous for its commitment to journalistic integrity and impartiality.\n\nIts ever-expanding global reach (it's one of the fastest-growing top ten websites in the US this year) makes it a trusted source of information for millions of viewers, readers, and listeners around the globe who watch BBC television, visit the website, and tune in via radio.\n\nMaximize impact with media coverage\n\nWe’re an award-winning PR agency experienced in getting clients noticed\n\nPartner up\n\n3\n\nThe New York Times\n\nSlap bang, in the middle of Manhattan, is the most significant news website in the US. Founded in 1851, the New York Times (or NYTimes for short) has become one of the world’s most popular and engaging broadsheets, offering news, general interest articles, social commentary, and lifestyle stories.\n\nAlong the way, it has picked up 132 Pulitzer Prizes (think the ‘Medal of Honour’ award, but for journalism), maintains a healthy daily online circulation, and has a more prominent Twitter presence than most in its field. It also leads regarding the number of subscribers, offering a great example of a successful subscription model.\n\nIt recently added ‘The Athletic’ to its portfolio and has its site set on achieving 15 million more subscribers by 2027. Few doubt its ability to do this.\n\n4\n\nReuters Group\n\nOnce at the epicenter of London’s Fleet Street, a street made famous by being the home of the British print and newspaper industry, Reuter's long history dates back to 1851 and resulted in being bought by a Canadian company in 2008, when it was then made into Thomson Reuters.\n\nToday, it's the second biggest news agency in the world, employing 2500 journalists in about 200 locations. Its operations are enormous, and almost every outlet uses Thomson Reuters for news material due to its physical presence in nearly one hundred countries, making it a reliable source for breaking news.\n\nIn total, its readership sits around the 40 million mark.\n\n5\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nIt cost Jeff Bezos $250 million to buy the Washington Post in 2013. It isn’t hard to see why he’d want to. Considered a staple of quality journalism in the U.S., it is one of the most-read sites in the world for news and has 73 Pulitzer Prizes to back this up.\n\nThe Washington Post remains one of the top media outlets for breaking news and general interest stories. Held in high regard by many, it broke the story of the ‘Watergate Scandal,’ which led to a sitting U.S. president's first (and only) resignation. It’ll no doubt have more world firsts in the future.\n\n6\n\nAl Jazeera\n\nFounded by the Qatari government as an alternative to Western-dominated news media, Al Jazeera was considered the first independent Arabic news channel when it began in 1996. Several other firsts would follow, including being the first English-language news channel in the Middle East and one of the first global High Definition (HD) television networks.\n\nA global brand was born when Al Jazeera English was launched, and it was voted the world's most influential media network and the fifth most influential brand in the world, finishing only behind Apple, Google, IKEA, and Starbucks!\n\nWith a strong reputation for quality news reporting, it has invested in expanding its reach into new channels and evolving digital content to provide what its audience wants - quality, in-depth reporting that goes beyond traditional media.\n\n7\n\nThe Guardian\n\nThe Guardian has over 1 million digital subscribers and a print circulation higher than most daily newspapers in the UK. Well-known for its news, political coverage, and opinion pieces, its global presence has increased recently, notably in the U.S. and Australia. This, combined with its diverse readership, makes it a well-respected quality news provider.\n\nThe award-winning newspaper has a unique ownership structure, owned by a Trust to ensure journalistic independence, and profits are reinvested into independent journalism. This puts it in a unique position and gives it a distinct voice in the media landscape.\n\n8\n\nAssociated Press (AP)\n\nWith its headquarters in New York, the Associated Press (AP) is a global news outlet that has been at the forefront of breaking big news stories since its inception in 1846. It is one of the oldest and most revered agencies. It operates 235 news desks in 94 countries, and a staggering four billion read, listen, or watch its news daily.\n\nThey are the proud owner of 58 Pulitzers (35 for photography). The company has over 16 million followers on Twitter and 2.1 million YouTube subscribers, and they send news to over 8,500 subscribers in over 100 countries worldwide.\n\nAs well as its newswire, it also has a radio service and a news text service.\n\n9\n\nNBC\n\nA popular broadcaster, the news organization makes content for television, radio, and online platforms. It is dotted in many cities throughout the U.S. It serves as the flagship network of NBC Entertainment, part of the Comcast group.\n\nFounded in 1926, NBC is viewed as one of the ‘big three’ American networks due to its age and influence on mainstream news. It was also the first network to provide news in color.\n\nBusiness, world news, technology, and health are its main categories, and it covers these extensively on its social media accounts, with regular Tweets offering real-time business news. Their website has an automatic in-browser video player enabling you to watch live while you’re on their homepage.\n\n10\n\nFox News\n\nFox News began its life in 1996 and was designed to be the right-wing equivalent of CNN, quickly gaining a reputation for its unapologetic conservative stance. It has since acted as the prototype for right-wing news outlets and the benchmark to follow.\n\nHighlights include being the country's most-watched cable TV news channel, paving the way for the growth of its radio and online divisions. These, along with its TV news, are powerful mediums with combined audiences of billions.\n\nLowlights must include the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit when Dominion claimed that Fox spread falsehoods about the machines being rigged against then-president Donald Trump. Fox was ordered to pay $787.5 million and admit what they said was false.\n\n11\n\nABC News\n\nABC News is the highly regarded news division within the more extensive ABC network that is part of The Walt Disney Company. It has a long history of delivering news to the American public and began its journey in 1945.\n\nOver the years, it has been the proud recipient of numerous journalistic awards, including Emmy Awards and Peabody Awards, the latter of which it won for its coverage of the events of 9/11.\n\nThe station has many popular programs and a solid online and social media presence to boost viewership and engagement.\n\n12\n\nBloomberg\n\nBloomberg was formed in 1990 to provide deep financial news, industry analysis, and investing analysis to Bloomberg subscribers. It started with a lean team of six.\n\nToday, it is an international news financial news service with over 2500 reporters spread worldwide. They also can boast 17.4M monthly digital viewers, 1.6M U.S audio listeners, and 2.53M podcast listens. Currently, they reach 433 million television households.\n\n13\n\nCBS News\n\nCBS has a storied history, dating back to its beginnings in 1927. It is known as a television news pioneer, attracting older viewers who have trusted it for decades and younger ones who are more likely to rely on its digital platforms and streaming services.\n\nCbsnews.com is one of the fastest online news sites of 2023, according to Similarweb, with 60.1 million visits, up 44% from the previous. According to Press Gazette’s monthly ranking of global online traffic, CBS News was the world’s fastest-growing English-language news website in June 2023.\n\nPlan for your media outreach today\n\nHarness the premier outlets needed for your brand's sustained growth\n\nConnect now\n\n14\n\nNPR (National Public Radio)\n\nLike the BBC, NPR’s origins lie more on the public broadcasting side than in commercial broadcasting, and Congress set it up in much the same way as the BBC. It acts as a radio syndicator, producing and licensing shows for over 1,000 radio and television stations throughout the U.S.\n\nWith NPR, there is a strong emphasis on informative storytelling and news over ‘extra’ topics of interest such as sports or entertainment.\n\nNPR differs from some of its bigger rivals, often providing the news and news analysis rather than allowing it to be used as a launching point for people’s opinions. As the role of smaller or local newspapers has declined, NPR is seen as an indispensable service by many.\n\n15\n\nPolitico\n\nFounded by ex-Washington Post editors who left their old employer in 2006, Politico managed to insert itself into the U.S. political reporting scene. After establishing itself as a key player there, it expanded into Europe.\n\nPolitico has gained a reputation for exerting influence over political journalism and public debate, and this has spread out to similar publications that have adjusted their structure and tone to match its award-winning coverage and style. Much like its founders left the Washington Post to form Politico, some ex-employees of Politico went on to form Axios and Punchbowl News.\n\nEasily accessible on mobile devices, its email newsletters provide readers with timely and in-depth political updates.\n\n16\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, known as WSJ, has a grand reputation for rigorous journalism and an integrity-first approach to its coverage, with regular fact checks undertaken on its reporting. It offers insightful analysis and comprehensive coverage of global financial markets, business, and geopolitical stories.\n\nIt offers the option to listen to the news with a button and receive morning and evening news updates via its newsletter subscription.\n\nNumerous rewards have been bestowed upon it for its coverage of globally significant events. It is often said the WSJ is the choice of economists and business leaders, highlighting its credibility. Some of the content is behind a paywall.\n\n17\n\nTIME Magazine\n\nTIME is one of the world’s most essential and influential weekly magazines. Established in 1923 by Briton Hadden and Henry Luce, it is renowned for its distinctive red-bordered covers, often featuring prominent political and cultural figures, from world leaders, entertainers, and scientists to pivotal moments in world history.\n\nAlthough it began in print, it adapted in the digital era and now has a strong digital presence (it removed its paywall in 2023).TIME remains a solid and recognizable brand that offers detailed insights into the issues of our time.\n\nIts “Person of the Year” edition, which names the person who’s exerted the most influence on the year (good or bad), is highly anticipated.\n\n18\n\nUSA Today\n\nUSA Today is part of the USA Today Network, a group of media outlets owned by the Gannet Company. Founded in 1982, it was notable for its layout and unusual format. It contained colorful graphics and ‘nuggets’ of information over in-depth stories designed to make it more accessible and engaging for readers. Though it was mocked at the time, this style would later be copied by others.\n\nWith around 2 million online subscribers and a daily readership of around 2.6 million, it has the largest newspaper circulation in America.\n\n19\n\nCNBC\n\nPreviously the Consumer News and Business Channel, this cable business news channel and its website provide in-depth business news to its devoted audience through interviews, live stock market news, and investment analysis.\n\nIt is one of the big three business news channels, the other two being Fox Business and Bloomberg. It also has Asian and European bases too. It offers a subscription service called CNBC Pro, which provides financial data for professionals and investors.\n\n20\n\nHuffPost\n\nA very popular news outlet featuring breaking news, discussion, and politics. HuffPost (formerly The Huffington Post) is a more left-leaning outlet that has expanded worldwide, with editions in Canada, the UK, France, Spain, and more.\n\nIt often caters to smaller communities in its content and is known for cooky blog post titles (‘Funniest Tweets From Women’). Known for ‘clickable’ headlines, UGC, and opinion posts, it’s made a marked impact on digital journalism.\n\n21\n\nThe Economist\n\nThis British weekly has a robust subscriber base of around 1.1 million. Across social media, it reaches 35 million. The outlet is famous for data journalism.\n\nFounded in 1843, it soon morphed from a political protest publication to cover current events, politics, and commerce before including opinion columns, art critiques, and satirical cartoons (which continue to this day).\n\nPrinted in a distinguished A4 paper size, it is one of the most recognized and respected brands on magazine shelves.\n\n22\n\nThe Independent\n\nLaunched in 1986, The Independent was seen as a breath of fresh air compared to others in the British press. Named because of its independent stance, its tagline was \"It is. Are you?”\n\nIn 2016, it became the first national newspaper in the UK to go digital only - capitalizing on the growth of online readership and news consumption. This has worked. It enjoys a monthly audience of over 21.4 million, growing as we speak.\n\n23\n\nBuzzFeed\n\nReaching millions every week with various topics, including politics, entertainment, and DIY, it has become a staple in the news coverage world. It was initially a well-known hit for its online quizzes and quirky listicles (“10 Important Life Lessons You Can Learn From Cats”).\n\nThe BuzzFeed brand is strengthened through its native advertising revenue streams, meaning the reader is never far away from a topic of interest. The brand caters to a mainly younger and left-leaning crowd.\n\nThe outlet has been criticized for bias and the level of trustworthiness of its news, with critics pointing to its publishing of several untrue stories. It has also faced accusations of plagiarism, and some of its hiring practices also faced scrutiny. Despite this, it is still highly profitable.\n\n24\n\nThe Atlantic\n\nFounded in 1857 in Boston as “The Atlantic Monthly” - only dropping the ‘Monthly’ in 2007, the publication offered its commentary on topics such as the abolition of slavery (one of its original owners was a crucial figure in the abolitionist movement) and other political issues of the day.\n\nThe news brand features in-depth commentary, long-form articles, and essays. In 2019, its content was put behind a paywall. The Atlantic has also ventured into film, producing a full-length documentary called ‘White Noise,’ a film about three alt-right activists. Its stance can be described as center-left.\n\n25\n\nForbes\n\nForbes is a popular and highly regarded business magazine covering finance/business news and issues. The focus is international. For over a century now, it has been widely seen as an inspirational publication, and appearing in Forbes is seen as the pinnacle for organizations or individuals.\n\nIts annual rankings of ‘influential’ and ‘wealthiest’ people are a talking point for many. Across all of its platforms, it reaches a staggering 150 million people.\n\nWant to be featured in outlets like this?\n\nWe’ve got clients coverage in the biggest publications\n\nFind out more\n\n26\n\nThe Daily Beast\n\nThe Daily Beast\" is an American news site that features news, politics, and pop culture stories. Founded in 2008, it has been described as a ”high-end tabloid.” Its layout is somewhat brash, using cartoons and striking abstract images to draw people in.\n\nContent-wise, it covers stories not necessarily given the airtime in more mainstream news, winning several awards for its journalism over the years and attracting over 1 million visitors daily to its site.\n\n27\n\nVox\n\nA later arrival, Vox was officially launched in 2014 by Ezra Klein, Melissa Bell, and Matthew Yglesias. Vox’s signature style is its explanatory journalism - it aims to clarify issues and break them down so they are more easily understood by the reader, giving more context to the discussion points and letting them make up their mind—a different approach to a lot of news outlets.\n\nIt has around 20 million monthly visitors.\n\n28\n\nThe Intercept\n\nThis online publication, launched in 2014, was founded by Glenn Greenwald, Jeremy Scahill, and Laura Poitras and funded by eBay co-founder Pierre Omidyar through his First Look Media company.\n\nIts primary focus is investigative journalism and exposing the wrongdoings of powerful entities, notably in security, tech, and politics, and how they intercept civil liberties. It led the way by being the first to report on documents disclosed by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nKnown for its progressive stance, it operates as a non-profit, relying on donations and sponsors to sustain itself.\n\n29\n\nSalon.com\n\nSalon.com is a U.S. news and opinion website created in 1995 by David Talbot, who wanted to test the power of the web and created Salon.com - a digital-only magazine. In 1996, TIME magazine named it their favorite website of the year.\n\nSalon.com also covers arts and culture. Opinion pieces and reviews also feature heavily, as do regular criticisms of conservative policies. The publication has faced numerous challenges, including experimenting with different revenue streams - with less than mixed results. Its subscription model fell flat, and it has since gone back to the advertising model. It has never been a profitable entity, however. In 2018, it launched a beta program allowing customers to opt out of advertising.\n\nWhile some of its opinion pieces have been quite polarizing, it maintains a distinctive voice and a dedicated readership in the digital sphere.\n\n30\n\nNational Geographic\n\nKnown for its yellow-bordered cover, National Geographic is one of the most recognized magazines in the world. Initially set up as a scholarly publication in 1888 by the National Geographic Society, an organization set up just nine months prior by explorers and intellectuals, its chief aim was to educate and inform people about geographical and scientific knowledge while promoting the preservation of the world’s natural resources. The magazine acted as the mouthpiece for this.\n\nIt is otherwise well known for its in-depth reports on nature and science and outstanding photography, notably of natural images. The magazine is available in over forty languages and has received 25 National Magazine Awards.\n\nIt also developed the National Geographic TV channel. In recent years, it has given Walt Disney a controlling interest in the company.\n\n31\n\nSlate\n\nSlate is known for its witty and entertaining writing, presenting analytical perspectives on news stories and cultural events. It has been characterized as being left-leaning in terms of its editorial stance. However, it regularly plays devil's advocate with its views, encouraging counter-argument, a style coined “Slate-pitch.”\n\nIt has experimented with many monetization techniques over the years but settled on a metered paywall for international visitors and also provides ‘Slate Plus,’ where it offers extra content, extended podcasts, and other benefits to members.\n\nIt has also ventured into podcasts with its ‘Gabfest’ series (Political Gabfest, Cultural Gabfest), which have proved very popular.\n\n32\n\nThe Telegraph\n\nThe Telegraph was founded in 1855 by Colonel Arthur B. Sleigh as the Daily Telegraph and Courier. Traditionally seen as a conservative broadsheet, it covers all topics, from business, finance, sport, and politics - to domestic and international affairs.\n\nLike many broadsheets contending with a slump in newspaper sales, it successfully moved to a solid digital presence. In 1994, it became the first online newspaper in Europe. While some content is behind a paywall, some are freely accessible.\n\nIt has a daily circulation of around 320,000 and is a famous paper.\n\n33\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald began publication in 1831, making it Australia’s oldest newspaper. It provides a mix of local, national, and international news spanning various areas, such as current affairs, politics, sports, and lifestyle.\n\nIt has received awards for journalism, including the prestigious Australian Walkley Awards, and exerts a strong influence on public discourse in the country. Part of the Nine Entertainment Co, a vast media conglomerate in the Australian media landscape.\n\nIt has about 808,000 weekly readers and attracted over 8 million to all its platforms combined between 2022-23.\n\n34\n\nThe Globe and Mail\n\nWith an audience reach of over 6 million both in print and digital formats, The Globe and Mail is one of Canada’s most widely read newspapers, influencing public opinion and discourse in its native Canada. Woodbridge owns it, the investment arm of the Thomson family, a hugely wealthy Canadian family.\n\nLike other newspapers, it provides content through its website and mobile app, offering various subscription offers for readers, with its website having won an Online Journalism Award. Its \"Report on Business\" section (ROB for short) focuses on financial and economic news and is very popular, reaching an estimated audience of 1.5 million.\n\n35\n\nThe Times of India\n\nIndia’s most widely circulated English daily newspaper has a daily circulation of over 2.5 million copies, laying claim to being the most widely read English-language paper in the world. At 184 years old, it is also one of the oldest. Bennett, Coleman & Co Ltd are the owners.\n\nSeen as pro-business by many, it has won numerous awards over the years. Still, it has received criticism for accepting payments from organizations and people to write up positive coverage about them.\n\nIn a 2021 survey, the Reuters Institute rated it the most trusted media news brand among English-speaking online news users in the country.\n\n36\n\nSouth China Morning Post\n\nThe paper is a leading English-speaking outlet based in Hong Kong. Created in 1903 by Tse Tsan-tai, it has maintained its position as Hong Kong’s premier newspaper since British rule.\n\nNow owned by Chinese tech giant Alibaba, concerns have been raised about its independence and subtle promotion of Chinese interests. There was talk of its website being shut down, but after much protest, it remained in existence. It is not, however, accessible from Mainland China.\n\nIts circulation has been relatively constant over the years at over 100,000. A survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong named it the most credible newspaper in Hong Kong.\n\n37\n\nThe Financial Times\n\nThis prominent London-based international daily covers business, financial, and economic matters. Widely revered by business people and politicians, it has a solid online presence with over 1 million subscribers worldwide, helped by its international editions, including in mainland Europe, the US, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific.\n\nUniversally known by its initials - FT, the paper was first published in 1888 as the London Financial Guide. In 1893, it began using its distinctive light pink paper, which became a trademark feature and is still used today.\n\nThe paper is known for its editorial independence and socially liberal perspective and has won numerous awards for its reporting. In 2012, it received criticism for an interview it did with Putin, although many praised it for its line of questioning and insights offered into the Russian President.\n\n38\n\nThe New Yorker\n\nWith its stylish black-and-white layout and unique written and stylistic features, The New Yorker features a wide array of content, from commentary to criticism and cartoons.\n\nIt was founded in 1925 by husband and wife team Harold Ross and Jane Grant - Jane worked as a reporter for the New York Times. Initially designed to be a humor magazine, it soon expanded into serious journalism.\n\nIt is famous for its cartoons spread throughout and its strict copyediting and fact-checking processes. It has won many awards and hosts an annual festival in New York that includes talks, interviews, and performances.\n\n39\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nSouthern California’s prize-winning newspaper (it counts 40 Pullitzers to its name) has existed for over 140 years.\n\nAfter a difficult beginning to the 21st century, it was acquired by billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, who helped rejuvenate it. In recent years, its focus has shifted away from an international stance to mainly focus on Southern California and the issues and stories that impact that area.\n\nIt is the largest American daily outside the East Coast and the sixth largest overall. It has a daily print circulation of about 140,000 and 550,000 online subscribers.\n\n40\n\nChicago Tribune\n\nAccuracy, integrity, and ethics are highly regarded in the Chicago Tribune. Still printed daily and owned by the Tribune Publishing group, this newspaper has been around since 1847 and is one of the oldest in the USA.\n\nThe Tribune is the most significant news source in the Midwest and the top source of news and information in the Chicago area. It had the seventh-highest circulation of all newspapers last year in the U.S. at around 105,000. Web traffic has also risen this year for this news veteran.\n\nIn 2009, to stay relevant, it was published in tabloid-style format for newsstands and commuter station sales. Readers rejected this, and less than two years later, it continued its life as a broadsheet, which it does today.\n\n41\n\nMiami Herald\n\nBased in Miami-Dade County, Florida, The Miami Herald is owned and operated by The McClatchy Company.\n\nFounded in 1903, it is rated fifth in daily circulation. Throughout its long history, it has been showered with 24 Pulitzers. Its coverage of environmental change on the Florida coast has been notable in the face of climate change denial rhetoric in the state.\n\nIt is the largest American daily outside the East Coast and the sixth largest overall. It has a daily print circulation of about 140,000 and 550,000 online subscribers.\n\n42\n\nDallas Morning News\n\nThis daily newspaper was founded in October 1885 by Alfred Horation Belo and has served the Dallas-Fort Worth area since. Circulation is approximately 65,000, and it is in the country’s top 20. It has won 9 Pulitzers and an overseas Press Club award for reporting and photography.\n\nIt has also expanded into audio, with readers and listeners able to do so via podcast.
