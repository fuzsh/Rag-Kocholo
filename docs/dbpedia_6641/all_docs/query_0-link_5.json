        "text": "Great is the influence of famed newsmag Time, whose 100th birthday is an occasion for celebration, sober reflection.\n\nOf import today in the news world is its punchy prose, portmanteau words, neologisms like \"televangelist\" and \"socialite\" (not so successful were \"cinemactor\" and \"radiaorator\"), its missing conjunctions, its adjectival \"false titles\" still common in journalism: \"Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay,\" \"Billionaire investor Carl Icahn.\"\n\nLess imitated, now, are the \"inverted\" sentences (this one, for instance) which were long fodder for satirists.\n\n\"That horrible, snide, corkscrew English!\" says Katharine Hepburn, the heiress in \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940), when she learns that a magazine called Spy will be invading her society wedding.\n\nLuce language\n\nSpy was a stand-in for all of the publications of magazine king Henry Luce, whose Time, Life and Fortune set the tone for popular journalism from the 1930s onward. The Luce character, called Sidney Kidd in the movie, is the thorn in the side of reporter Jimmy Stewart. \"No mean Machiavelli is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd,\" grumbles Stewart.\n\nEventually, there was a real Spy magazine. Satirists Kurt Andersen and E. Graydon Carter were so enamored of the idea that they created an actual monthly that chronicled New York high life from 1986 to 1998, in Luce-flavored language. Donald Trump, famously, was \"short-fingered vulgarian Donald Trump.\"\n\nThis way of writing had its own neologism. \"Timestyle.\"\n\nTo coin a phrase\n\n\"It was just a lot of fun for people to read,\" said David E. Sumner, who with Samir Husni co-authored the second edition of \"The Magazine Century: American Magazines since 1900\" (\"Authored\" — as opposed to wrote — is classic Timespeak).\n\n\"Some of Time's words became part of the language: like 'tycoon,' 'pundit,' 'male chauvinist,' \" Sumner said.\n\nBut the chief legacy of Time, to newsrooms, was brevity.\n\nIf not the soul of wit, it was at least the soul of circulation numbers. By 1927, the magazine was reaching 175,000 readers. \"Circulation increased very rapidly during the Twenties, which was a prosperous time, of course,\" said Matthew Pressman, an assistant professor of journalism at Seton Hall University. \"It did very, very well.\"\n\nTime was called Time for two reasons.\n\nOne, it brought you the latest, up-to-the-minute news. Two, it saved you time. Everything was a \"quick read.\"\n\nShort and sweet\n\nSome characteristic items from the first issue:\n\n\"General Isaac R. Sherwood, 87, representing the 9th district of Ohio in the 68th congress, is the oldest man ever to be elected to the House or Senate.\" (\"Political Notes\").\n\n\"Preparations are under way for the erection, in Milan, of Italy's first skyscraper. 'Reserve for me an apartment on the top floor!' said Mussolini.\" (\"Foreign News\").\n\n\"Recently a doctor grafted a portion of a pig's eye on the eyeball of a blind boy, Alfred Lemonowicz, of Paterson N.J. According to reports the operation was partly successful — the young boy is able to see slightly. At any rate, the attendant publicity has secured the young man a contract to appear in vaudeville with the pig.\" (\"Medicine\").\n\nThe first man on the cover of Time was Republican leader Joseph Gurney Cannon (Luce was a staunch Republican). Time, which launched March 3, 1923, was something new under the sun.\n\n\"It was brief, concise,\" Sumner said. \"The longest article in this issue was half a page. Luce kind of imagined this guy on the subway, riding to work. He wanted to create something where he could get the gist of the news in just an hour. That was revolutionary.\"\n\nChanging with the times\n\nMagazines — and civilization generally — were very different in the pre-Time era.\n\nThe tempo was slower. The readership was more highbrow. Magazines were aimed at a small, educated audience who would read them at leisure at the club or in the study. Articles were long, pictures few.\n\nBut the 1920s — not called The Roaring Twenties for nothing — changed all that. It was a decade of speed and scramble, of climbers, go-getters and Gatsbys who were too busy hustling to attend to the life of the mind.\n\nOn Feb. 5, 1922, a new magazine appeared. Reader's Digest condensed the great books of the past and present into bite-size nuggets that would enable you to hold your own in any conversation. Time magazine followed a year later.\n\n\"We reached the conclusion that most people were not well informed and that something should be done,\" Luce declared.\n\nTime magazine wasn't for lowbrows, like the gutter press. It wasn't for highbrows, like most periodicals of the day. It was for an entirely new kind of person — one that the 1920s culture of upstarts had created. The \"middlebrow.\" The term was coined by critic Dwight Macdonald, a former Time writer.\n\n\"As smoking gives us something to do with our hands when we aren't using them, 'Time' gives us something to do with our minds when we aren't thinking,\" Macdonald wrote years later.\n\nPutting it in reverse\n\nPunchiness, conciseness, were hallmarks of Time from the get-go. But there was little, in that first issue 100 years ago, to suggest how peculiar its prose was to become. \"Said Mussolini\" — rather than \"Mussolini said\" — was the only ominous foretaste.\n\n\"Timestyle,\" in its full glory, seems to have been mostly the brainchild of Briton Hadden, co-founder with Henry Luce of the magazine and — according to some — the real brains of the operation.\n\nThe two had been fellow students at Hotchkiss and Yale: Luce dogged and determined, Hadden a top scholar and bon vivant. Hadden had studied the classics. He discovered in Virgil and Homer all he needed to know about newswriting. \"Of arms and the man I sing\" (\"Aeneid\"). \"Wine-dark sea\" (\"Odyssey\"). Jumping Jupiter! It was all Timestyle!\n\nHadden died prematurely, at age 31, in 1929. But his distinctive prose found its way not only into many of the Luce publications (Life, Fortune, Sports Illustrated) and their competitors (Newsweek, Look), but also into the \"March of Time\" newsreels, produced by Luce, that were seen by millions in movie theaters. The classic movie \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) contains a wickedly accurate parody of a Luce newsreel.\n\n\"For forty years appeared in Kane newsprint no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand,\" the narrator intones. \"No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce. Often support, then denounce.\"\n\nMethod in the madness\n\nIn fact, there was news-logic — not just eccentricity — behind the idea of putting the predicate first, the subject second.\n\nThe idea was to start with the action, the most exciting part, and then tell you who's doing it. It was a reversal of the old newspaper formula. \"What\" first — followed by \"who,\" \"when,\" \"where\" and \"why.\"\n\nAnd Luce had a great deal to do with putting the \"why\" in the story as well, Pressman says.\n\n\"They were going to analyze the news at the same time they were giving it to you,\" he said. \"In newspapers of the 1920s and '30s, the style was to say who said and did what. Time was explaining why they said or did that. Addressing the 'why' questions didn't become commonplace in newspaper journalism until the '60s and beyond.\"\n\nBattle of the brows\n\nGood or bad, Luce's innovations did not sit well with the more staid, or sophisticated.\n\nLuce had an ongoing feud with Harold Ross, editor of The New Yorker — a magazine whose cozy urbanity and 15-page pieces on the Northern Paper Wasp were the exact opposite of everything Time magazine stood for. The New Yorker was \"not for the little old lady in Dubuque,\" Ross famously said. Time magazine was.\n\n\"They were just fighting for a different audience,\" Sumner said. \"A middlebrow versus a highbrow audience.\"\n\nIn 1934, Luce's Fortune magazine printed a snide piece on Ross. On Nov. 20, 1936, The New Yorker responded with one of its most celebrated profiles. \"Time...Fortune...Life...Luce\" was characteristically long, and was written — of course — in Timestyle.\n\n\"Ambitious, gimlet-eyed Baby Tycoon Henry Robinson Luce, co-founder of 'Time,' promulgator of 'Fortune,' potent in associated radio & cinema ventures,\" was skewered unmercifully by staff writer Wolcott Gibbs.\n\n\"Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind,\" Gibbs wrote. \"Where it all will end, knows God!\"\n\nSetting the standard\n\nIn the decades that followed, Time slowly began to unkink its prose. It became a touchstone, an institution. To be on its cover was the goal of every person of ambition, from Walter P. Chryslerto Hitler to Bruce Springsteen. Its Man of the Year (later Person of the Year) was an honor only slightly less coveted than the Nobel Prize. At its peak, from the 1970s to the 1990s, Time's circulation was above 4 million.\n\nThese days, when the internet is king, and print is the poor relation, Time's subscription figures are not so rosy: around 1.6 million. But its innovations, now, have become routine — in all news, on all platforms.\n\nThe use of \"false titles\" or \"news handles\" (\"Controversial billionaire George Soros\"), the punchy prose, the news analysis, the breaking down of stories into bite-size pieces — with as many facts, figures and illustrations as possible — are all from the Time playbook.\n\nEvery editor who has ever said to a reporter \"write tight\" is — consciously or unconsciously — following in the steps of gimlet-eyed Baby Tycoon Henry Robinson Luce. The legacy of Time magazine is vast.\n\nOr say rather: \"Vast is the legacy of Time magazine.\"\n\n\"It wasn't just the writing style,\" Pressman said. \"It was the emphasis on giving people the news in a concise and engaging way. The analysis, the opinionated style, was widely imitated.\""
