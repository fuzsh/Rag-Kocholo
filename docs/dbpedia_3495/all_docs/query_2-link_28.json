It also allows fans and viewers to meet other people who have been the inspiration behind the album, such as a cancer patient named Pete in Costa Rica and Moore's friend as they travel through Iceland.\n\nThe documentary is an effort to give fans a better understanding of the thought and emotions that it took to create the singer's third studio album.\n\n\"I never knew that purposely taking a break from music, would bring me back to the core of why I fell in love with it in the first place,\" Moore captioned a recent photo he posted on Instagram. \"We never intended to make a documentary about these travels or the Slowheart record.\""
