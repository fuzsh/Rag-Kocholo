        "text": "Eight years grinding in Nashville in close proximity to all kinds of fried delicacies might break a weaker-willed man. But Moore had both the drive and physical discipline to stay healthyand only professional hungry. Now, he may be one of the most visibly muscular artists in country music. To learn some of his diet and fitness secrets, Mens Health paid Moore a visit at his home in Nashville.\n\nIm doing a lot of functional workouts, Moore says, summarizing his exercise ethos. I'm trying to do workouts that arent necessarily going to get me super bulky, but to stay lean and fit. For that reason, Moore says, he never lifts super heavy weights, instead focusing on sets with high reps.\n\nIncredibly, Moore has never had a trainer. He says he just works out and then listens to his body. He says he always exercises alone. I dont like listening to anybody telling me how to work out, he says, grinning. Thats probably the main reason.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStill, Moores routine could just as easily be torn from the pages of Men's Health.\n\nHis workouts include everything from kettlebell swings to barbell thrusters to ring pull-ups variations on hollow body holds. Each exercise offers enough variability that Moore can hit multiple muscle groups at once, working core, back, shoulders, and arms. Hell then isolate the legsstandard box squat, an essential, he says.\n\nFunctional workouts also entail rock climbing (he wears the same pants when he works out too; and no, theyre not jeans), surfing (he has a faint scar on his face from a gnarly collision with a coral reef), and skateboarding.\n\nMoore says he played basketball throughout high school and that his training and preparation for the sport translated into his career. To have the stamina to go do 150 shows in a year is super taxingmentally, physically, all of it. For me, its kind of a completion on: how ready can I be?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat mental component, Moore says, may be the most challenging. Here, he stays healthy through meditation, prayer, and consistencymaking sure hes getting enough sleep and maintaining a proper diet, which, when golden fast food arches drag by his tour bus, can be difficult; there is not shortage of great, greasy food along the southern tour belt.\n\nTo have the stamina to go do 150 shows in a year is super taxingmentally, physically, all of it. For me, its kind of a completion on: how ready can I be?\n\nMoore says hell actually lose weight on the road, when he cant meal prep. Running wild on stage, hell burn off far more calories than hes taking in. Thats why its so important to eat healthy and consistent at homeso he can afford to lean down a bit.\n\nConsistency means eggs, avocados, tomatoes, fruits, vegetables for breakfast every single morning. He eats a two course luncha prepped meal from Eat Well, a Nashville food service, and then grilled chicken.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Moore is no nutrition puritan and he finds ways to indulge in some fudge popsand a little white container he keeps in the fridge. But he cant tell us whats in it. I might not be able to get through Canada again, he says, laughing."
