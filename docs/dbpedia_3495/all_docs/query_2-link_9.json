        "text": "There is something in the water in South Georgia that is turning good, Southern boys into mega country music artists. Rhett Akins came first in the '90s, followed recently by Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean.\n\nYou can now add Kip Moore to that list.\n\nBut there's something different about Moore than all the rest, and Athens can find out just what that is Saturday night when he plays the Georgia Theater.\n\nMoore topped the charts last year with his hit single, the catchy \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck,\" and most recently had a top five hit with his second single, \"Beer Money.\"\n\nBut being a country singer wasn't something that he grew up knowing he wanted to do.\n\nLike a lot of young men from South Georgia, Moore went to college to play sports. He played basketball in Alabama at Wallace State Community College before transferring to Valdosta State University, just a small drive down Interstate 75 from his hometown of Tifton. While at VSU, Moore played golf, but in the meantime was making a name for himself performing around town at places such as the Mellow Mushroom.\n\n\"I got down to Valdosta State, and my junior year is when I started doing the bar band circuit, and that's what paid for my housing,\" Moore said.\n\nAfter leaving Valdosta, Moore did something your typical country artist wouldn't do - he moved to Hawaii and lived in a hut, alone on the beach.\n\nUsed to playing covers in Valdosta bars, Moore tried his hand at writing his own songs while living in the hut.\n\nBeing alone in Hawaii, Moore said, helped bring out his creativity and hone his songwriting.\n\n\"I've always been a little bit introverted to a sense,\" he said. \"(I was) completely isolated from everything else and outside every single night, and you've got nothing but your thoughts, and I think without having any outside distractions, it was clear to me what I wanted to do with my life and that I wouldn't be happy if I wasn't doing music.\"\n\nMoore eventually ditched the hut and headed off to Nashville to kick off a songwriting career. He haunted the local music scene there for a few years, eventually catching the eye of an industry insider.\n\nBefore long, Kip Moore was MCA Nashville's newest recording artist.\n\nMoore released one minor hit before releasing \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck\" in late 2011. After creeping up the charts, the song became No. 1 in June.\n\nHe released his first album, \"Up All Night,\" in April, co-writing all 11 songs on the album.\n\nWhile he is currently touring and getting ready to head out on the road with Brantley Gilbert, he is recording songs for his next album, which should see release in late 2013.\n\nMoore said a new album will help fans get to know him better.\n\n\"I think it's going to connect the dots,\" he said. \"I think right now they are still in that discovery stage of what I do and who I am, and the next album, they'll say, 'That's Kip.' I don't think I write just to write. I think a lot of times when you listen to lyrics, you can tell people are just going for the hit song. I think when you dial in with what this record really is, and when people see the next one, that they will really feel it in their gut.\"\n\nWhile staying true to himself, Moore knows he has to have that special touch to make a song a hit, which he proved adept at on \"Up All Night.\" His newest single, \"Hey Pretty Girl,\" is already climbing the charts.\n\n\"I have tried my best to just write what I feel, and luckily I've learned to hone in on my craft,\" he said. \"Sometimes it's one of those unexplainable things. I've been listening to the records I love for so long and studying why I love them, and I think there's a way to stay true to what you do and still meet commercial (needs). I don't know how I do it, to be honest. I think I've been able to stay real ... to what I do, and it still fits into that commercial realm.\"\n\nSince becoming one of country's hottest new stars, Moore has had a chance to go back to his hometown, where he found his experience of the place had changed.\n\n\"As a kid, there were no outlets for me, no outlets for teens, so all I could think about was getting out and experiencing life. It was hard as a kid, but what was great about coming back to it, I finally got to be quiet and not have to do anything. That town is so relaxing, I could just go back and go fishing.\"\n\nThe experiences that Moore endured since leaving South Georgia, moving to Hawaii, Nashville and now as a touring artist helped shape who he is as a songwriter.\n\nGrowing up in South Georgia, Moore said, you live in a bubble of what's going on around there, but when you leave, you experience different things and other people's lives.\n\n\"My writing has changed because I've had more experiences to write about, and I think this next record is going to be completely different than the one that came out last year,\" he said.\n\nOne song that he has already recorded for the album, \"New York City,\" touches on that feeling a little.\n\n\"As amazing as that town is,\" he said, \"I can remember we played a sold-out show at a historic place called The Bowery Ballroom, and it was the most energized night. Seeing how alive (the city) is, but there's just something about that city that can make you feel so alone at the end of the day. I remember looking out of my hotel room window, and it kind of makes you miss home and the people you care about and your family.\""
