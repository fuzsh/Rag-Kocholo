        "text": "Multi-platinum singer/songwriter Kip Moore will join Dan + Shay at the Red River Valley Fair on Friday, July 7. Tickets for the show are currently on sale at redrivervalleyfair.com.\n\nTickets start at $35 plus applicable fees and include your gate admission to the Fair on July 7. A brand-new addition this year is the Grand Champion Experience! A limited number of these VIP tickets will be available for $199. VIP Experience includes early entry, elevated seating near the stage, a private and climate-controlled restroom, a private cash bar, catered food, and exclusive access to the parking lot closest to the Grandstand and Red River Valley Fair merchandise items!\n\nAbout Kip Moore\n\nFor the past couple of years, Kip Moore has spent most of his time on the road, building one of country music’s most loyal audiences show by show and plotting what would become his sophomore album, Wild Ones. He was a road warrior, living out of a tour bus with his bandmates and playing more than 200 shows per year. For a songwriter who’d grown up in a quiet pocket of southern Georgia, performing to crowds across the world — crowds that knew every word to his best-selling debut album, Up All Night — felt like a dream come true.\n\nKip Moore is anticipating the release of his new album, Damn Love, next month. The 13-song collection, which Kip co-produced with Jaren Johnston, is set for release on April 28th.\n\n“I’m super eager about getting new music out to fans,” says Kip. “I think that all writers and artists are always eager about that. It always feels like too long of a wait in-between records, but then I think it also serves its purpose in time for you to really gather where your head’s been at the last year or two of touring.”\n\nThe Georgia-born songsmith has a history of entrancing audiences around the world with sold-out headlining shows in Australia, South Africa, the U.K., and Europe and a slot at Bonnaroo all slated for 2023. Moore holds on to passion in the persistent anthem, “Heart on Fire,” while “Another Night In Knoxville” captures the magnetic draw of the stage – a sweeping ‘70s-rock ballad that soundtracks a long-cherished memory. Meanwhile, the refreshing “Kinda Bar” conjures magic from a roadside tavern, and a comforting sense of clarity arrives with gentle instant classics, “Some Things” and “One Heartbeat” (featuring Ashley McBryde)."
