        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nI am still shocked we are getting new Kip Moore music.\n\nThe reason I say is because I recall Kip Moore saying he was taking a break from music in general.\n\nIntrigued to hear this nonetheless.\n\nNo. He's just taking a break from touring. He finished an album in the latter portion of 2016 and will have it out some time this year.\n\nOh ok! Must've misread the info.\n\nMy bad! I will always say this about Kip Moore, he's an acquired taste. Yoe either have it or not. For me I have always got his appeal but honestly outside of his debut single none of the other songs he's released has really made me all that motivated to purchase his albums. They've all been rather middle of the road.\n\nI will always check out his new lead singles though.\n\nPost by matty005 on\n\nNo. He's just taking a break from touring.

They've all been rather middle of the road.\n\nI will always check out his new lead singles though.\n\nThat's not what an acquired taste means. An acquired taste means it takes a while for you to like something. Not you have it or not. :)\n\nI can't wait to hear this! I LOVED his last CD (though I didn't care for his EP a few months ago) and still listen to \"Girl Of The Summer,\" quite a bit.\n\nPost by myeverything on\n\nNo. He's just taking a break from touring. He finished an album in the latter portion of 2016 and will have it out some time this year.\n\nFor me I have always got his appeal but honestly outside of his debut single none of the other songs he's released has really made me all that motivated to purchase his albums. They've all been rather middle of the road.\n\nThat's because his team decides to put out the most ridiculous singles the majority of the time. 95% of his album tracks sound nothing like \"Truck\" or \"Beer Money\" - they're FAR superior. (Unless you're referring to Mary.. I don't classify that one in the same category I would the previous mentioned songs).\n\nHeard this last night from a friend who sent it to me. I will say this: Is it a smash that's gonna go #1? Absolutely not. Will it finally break his rough streak at country radio and at least get him solidly back into the Top 20? One can certainly hope so, I know I do! I think it's more radio-friendly than \"Young Love\" and \"Dirt Road,\" that is for sure.\n\nLooking forward to hearing more new music from Kip and to see where this takes him next. Side note: He's playing some of the same festivals as Keith this summer. I've told both of them in person numerous times that they need to tour together. 3 years ago what does Kip say? \"Oh, you mean Toby Keith?\" (which ended up happening by the way) - but ANYWAYS... maybe this is the year for that pair up and I will die. lol.\n\nPost by LBTrocks on\n\nOkay, I can't really bring myself to dislike this simply for the fact that he mentioned Montana. lol, I was born and raised there.\n\nAnyway, I actually really do like this song. It has a great melody and I love the guitar and production. His voice is still like nails on a chalkboard to me though, so for that reason I might have to listen to this more sparingly, but this is probably my favorite single of his to date.\n\nPost by onebuffalo on\n\nLove it! According to Country Aircheck, 5 stations have already added it bringing the total to 7! That's obviously not a lot but given the situation and that it doesn't even go for adds for another 2 weeks is rather promising!! Come on, Kip!!!\n\nPicking up more stations and spins:\n\nSAM HUNT Body Like A Back Road 100 2297\n\nZAC BROWN BAND My Old Man 73 1254\n\nKIP MOORE More Girls Like You 4 40\n\nRASCAL FLATTS Yours If You Want It 3 36\n\nFLORIDA GEORGIA LINE God, Your Mama, And Me 2 33\n\nPost by .indulgecountry on\n\nThis sounds like another single that'll come and go with little impact just like his last two. Not seeing this as the hit he needs to re-establish himself and get back to the success he was having during his debut era. I've never really been into this guy, but I feel like the signs are there that he could be a whole lot better off right now with some stronger single choices."
