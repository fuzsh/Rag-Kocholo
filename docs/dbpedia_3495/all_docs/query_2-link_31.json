He tours the world headlining his own shows, earning acclaim, and a fierce following as an all-in performer in each setting. The Georgia native has won 3 American Country Awards, 1 CMT Award, and was the 2014 Country Music Association New Artist of the Year Award winner.\n\nTICKET PRICES:\n\nPit – $62.00;\n\nTerrace Box – $60.00;\n\nPremium Reserved – $52.00;\n\nReserved – $42.00;\n\nLawn – $32.00\n\nCorbette Jackson\n\nThe experiences we face throughout our lives, in many cases, can determine who we become. They not only shape our character, they guide us to our destiny. This is the case for singer-songwriter Corbette Jackson. His life journey consists of a series of events that collided to form the reason he creates fearlessly and the way he embraces and performs music.\n\nSweetland Amphitheatre’s 2021 concert season would not be possible without our amazing sponsors which include Kia, LaGrange Grocery, Vaughn Express, Mallory Agency, ETI, Emory Healthcare, City of LaGrange, Troup County, J.
