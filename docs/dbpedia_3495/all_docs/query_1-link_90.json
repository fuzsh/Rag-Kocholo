        "text": "Biography\n\nKip Moore was born in Tifton, Georgia. He began playing guitar while attending Wallace State Community College in Hanceville, Alabama, and made his first public performance at a Mellow Mushroom restaurant in Valdosta, Georgia. After college, he moved to a \"little hut\" in Hawaii, where he also took up backpacking and surfing. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2004, where songwriter and producer Brett James helped him sign a publishing deal.\n\nMusical career\n\nHe spent eight years in Nashville before signing a record deal with MCA Nashville. His debut single, \"Mary Was the Marrying Kind\", peaked at number 45 on the country singles charts published by Billboard.\n\nOn September 27, 2011, he released his second single, \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck\". The song was followed by the release of his debut album Up All Night in April 2012. Moore co-wrote every song on the album, and Brett James produced it. A month later, \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck\" hit number 1 on the Billboard country charts. \"Beer Money\" was the album's second single, followed by \"Hey Pretty Girl\". These songs also reached the country Top 5.\n\nMoore co-wrote two tracks on Thompson Square's self-titled debut album which was released in February 2011: \"All the Way\" and \"Let's Fight\", the latter of which was their debut single. He also co-wrote James Wesley's 2012 single \"Walking Contradiction\". He also co-wrote Frankie Ballard's 2016 single \"Cigarette\".\n\nWild Ones (2013–2016)\n\nIn October 2013, Moore announced his fifth single, \"Young Love\". It charted at number 22 on the Country Airplay in March 2014. After it underperformed, it was followed by \"Dirt Road\", which failed to make Top 40. Moore then decided to \"scrap\" his second album and compose new material. Moore then released \"I'm to Blame\", the lead single to his 2015 album, Wild Ones.\n\nSlowheart (2017–present)\n\nOn February 10, 2017, Moore released \"More Girls Like You\" as the lead single from a then-unannounced forthcoming album.\n\nOn June 21, 2017, Moore announced the album's title, Slowheart, and its release date of September 8, 2017.\n\nSingles\n\nA \"Young Love\" did not enter the Hot 100, but peaked at number 4 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which acts as a 25-song extension of the Hot 100.\n\nB \"Running for You\" did not enter the Hot 100, but peaked at number 11 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which acts as a 25-song extension of the Hot 100."
