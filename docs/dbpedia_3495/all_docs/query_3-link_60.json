Beginning with his auspicious debut in 2012, Moore has since released five critically acclaimed albums and penned over a dozen chart-topping singles, including the multi-platinum hits “Something’ ‘Bout a Truck,” “Hey Pretty Girl,” “Beer Money,” and “More Girls Like You.” With over 1 billion streams and 2.5 million monthly listeners, he’s performed sold-out headline shows in stadiums around the world including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, The U.K., Europe, and the U.S., leading to a nomination for CMA’s International Artist Achievement Award. His most recent album Damn Love was praised by Holler as “the best album of Kip Moore’s career” while earning further acclaim from Billboard, Music Row, and American Songwriter. Moore also appeared on Good Morning America to perform the album’s lead single and title track."
