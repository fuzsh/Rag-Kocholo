        "meta_description": "Listen to The CountryLine Songwriter Series with Kip Moore from CountryLine Songwriter Series. 'The CountryLine Songwriter Series', is where you'll hear from some of the most successful artists and songwriters working in Nashville today. Country music is all about storytelling and this is where you'll discover the stories from the people themselves of how they managed to find their way into such a competitive industry and rise to the top. What motivates and inspires them and what they've learnt along the way.Born and raised in Tifton, Georgia, Kip Moore was the son of a golfer and a painter. He spent most of his school years playing sports, in fact he attended University on a golf scholarship but was soon lured away by music. He got his first gig at a local restaurant and after graduating he decided to live in Hawaii for a spell before heading to Nashville in 2004. Earning a pay check as a manager at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Moore chipped away at music, starting to earn a reputation in song writing circles and placing songs with Jake Owen and Thompson Square. In 2008, Creative Artist Agency's Marc Dennis brought Moore to the attention of Joe Fisher at Universal Group Nashville, who paired him with songwriter Brett James, James then wound up producing Moore's 2012 debut album, “Up All Night”.First came the single \"Mary Was the Marrying Kind”, which went to 45 on Billboard's Country chart, but the song that launched Moore's career was \"Something' 'Bout A Truck”, a single released in September 2011, over the next few months, it climbed to number one and went double-platinum. In the wake of its success, Moore released “Up All Night”, in April 2012 and the next two singles were also Top Ten hits: \"Beer Money\" and “Hey Pretty Girl\".The first sign of Moore's second album arrived in October 2013, when he released \"Young Love”. This peaked at 26, which wound up better than his next single, \"Dirt Road”, which flopped on the charts. As a result of this he and his label decided to scrap the planned second album and write and record a brand-new record. The album “Wild Ones”, came in August 2015. This was followed by his third album “Slowheart”, in September of 2017. This album included the huge hit singles \"More Girls Like You\" and \"Last Shot”.Late in 2019, he released \"She's Mine”. the first single from his fourth album, “Wild World”. A relatively inward-looking record, it peaked at 5 on the Country Albums chart.In March of 2022 Kip returned to the UK and Ireland to perform at the C2C festival and spoke with Stuart Banford.CountryLine brings country music to the world through our radio stations, a TV show that reaches 90 million homes, countless interviews with massive stars and great live sessions. Download the CountryLine app to experience all this in one place:·     Live shows from the biggest names in country·     Interviews with our favourite artists·     News and gossip direct from music city itself·     Movies; TV shows·     Access to country music’s legends and the stars of tomorrow",
