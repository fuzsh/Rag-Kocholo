        "text": "Kip Moore- why didn’t I hear his fabulous voice earlier!? (I’ve gotten behind on the country music scene! ) He co-wrote two tracks on Thompson Square’s self-titled debut album which was released in February 2011: All the Way and Let’s Fight, the latter of which was their debut single. Moore (now aged 34) hit Nashville in 2004. He was born in Tifton, GA (near the Florida line) to a golf pro father and a creative/musical mother (who played the organ in church). He was the youngest boy in large family. “You had to make your own fun, for sure. I had a lot of time for daydreaming. It was a great town, but I dreamed about getting out. I do enjoy going back now.”\n\nBeer Money\n\nHe [his father] would play a lot of Jackson Browne, Willie Nelson, Bob Seger, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen. As early as I can remember, I always gravitated toward lyrics. Even when I hadn’t lived enough to understand them, they still shaped me. -Moore on his early musical influences\n\nCrazy One More Time\n\nMoore isn’t flashy, but the subtle frame he creates for his blue-collar portraits make the images seem that much more real. It also suggests he’s confident in his songs and his performance. Which he ought to be. -Tom Rowland (Billboard Country Monitor)\n\nDirt Road (Official Music Video)\n\nFor years, I have been searching for the missing link between blue-collar rock and country music. This year, I think I have heard it. His name is Kip Moore. There is fiery, urgent intensity in his voice. His lyrics vibrate with conviction and true grit. The melodies have gripping, heart-in-throat passion… This man just might be the hillbilly Springsteen. -Journalist/historian Robert K. Oermann (Music Row)\n\nHeart’s Desire\n\nI didn’t know a whole lot about the world of songwriting. I just did it for my own enjoyment.\n\nHey Pretty Girl (Official Music Video)\n\nI am drawn to the real-life experiences between a woman and a man. I try to sing about the way it is, but yet at the same time, what you can hope for between a couple. I don’t intend to paint a picture of what it’s really not.\n\nSomething Bout A Truck"
