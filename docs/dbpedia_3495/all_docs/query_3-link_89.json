        "text": "Moore fights to keep writing fresh; songs cross genres and generations\n\nKip Moore, pictured here playing Blossom Music Center last June, had his first headlining gig in Cleveland at Playhouse Square's Connor Palace Saturday, Nov. 29, 2014. It won't be Moore's last. Photo by Chuck Yarborough/Plain Dealer\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio- When it comes to country-rock singer/songwriter Kip Moore, there seems to be two kinds of people. The first group thinks he has the goods to become the next pop-country music superstar like Kenny Chesney. The second group has never heard of him.\n\nThe first group turned out Saturday night at Playhouse Square's Connor Palace to hear and cheer Moore whose debut album, \"Up All Night,\" was the No. 1 seller for a male artist in 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe first single from that album, \"Something 'Bout a Truck,\" went an impressive platinum right out of the gate. Born in Georgia, the 34-year-old Moore moved to Nashville in 2004.\n\nBut despite those Southern roots, Moore told the Plain Dealer's Chuck Yarborough recently that he grew up listening to his father's Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen albums.\n\nThat Midwestern, blue-collar sensibility and more importantly listen-ability informs Moore's writing and was in clear evidence Saturday night as the performer got the eager audience quickly in his corner and on their feet playing the popular songs from his debut album, such as \"Crazy One More Time\" and \"Mary Was the Marrying Kind.\"\n\nMoore, wearing a sleeveless black Felder T-shirt and signature backwards trucker cap was feeling nostalgic on this last night of a 32-city tour. He took time to tell the near capacity crowd at the Connor Palace about his early career in Nashville.\n\n\"In the beginning there was this producer who had plans for me,\" he told the crowd. \"But he wanted me to do some things differently. He said my music was too aggressive and he wanted to clean me up. He said I dressed like a bum. Well that didn't work out,\" he said before tearing into a honky tonk rocker called \"Reckless.\"\n\nMoore's gravelly vocals register somewhere between Springsteen and Mellencamp. He played his new song \"Dirt Road\" while teasing the audience, saying he didn't think Cleveland had any.\n\nMoore had the classic rock star appeal: The girls wanted to be with him and the guys wanted to be him. He also slowed down the tempo with several songs like the sentimental ballad \"Everything But You.\"\n\nSaturday night was Moore's first headlining show in Cleveland and from the audience's attendance and keen, laser-like attention it's pretty clear it won't be his last.\n\nSinger/songwriter Charlie Worsham and his band opened for Moore. In the course of a 25-minute set he pulled out all the stops, proving himself a master showman and first rate electric guitarist.\n\nHe engaged the audience saying that Ohio fans of mainstream country music were among the best in the nation.\n\n\"Anybody here from Rootstown?\" he asked the crowd. \"I think that's not far from here. Last year we played a place in Rootstown called The Dusty Armadillo and the people there knew words to all my songs, even the ones that weren't played on the radio. That made me want to cry, I was so grateful.\"\n\nHe then wowed the crowd with an impromptu, abbreviated rendition of \"Hang on Sloopy\" as a tribute to the Ohio State victory over Michigan earlier in the day. The Buckeye fans in the crowd, meaning pretty much everyone, went crazy.\n\nImpressive electric guitarist Clara Dunn and her band opened the show with a high-energy, half hour set that left the audience poised for a full evening of anthemic, radio-ready country rock.\n\nNo one left disappointed. In the end, everyone wanted Moore."
