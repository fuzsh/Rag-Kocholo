        "text": "Kip Christian Moore is an American country music singer-songwriter originally from Nashville, Tennessee who has been active as a musician since 2008.\n\nKip Moore's career in music didn't always seem as destined as other artists. He worked as a store manager for Abercrombie & Fitch for four years whilst quietly working on his own music and sound before he obtained a record deal with MCA Nashville. However after this initial struggle, the country star continued to score success on the US Country Charts. 'Mary Was the Marrying Kind' was his first appearance at #45 and this was seen as testing the waters as the follow-up 'Something' 'Bout a Truck' topped the chart upon its release in September 2011.\n\nHis debut album 'Up All Night' was released in April 2012 and peaked at #3 on the Country chart and #6 on the US Billboard. It has sold over 300,000 copies thanks to hit singles such as 'Beer Money' and 'Hey Pretty Girl'. He was awarded with three nominations in 2012 from the American Country Awards including New Artist of the Year, Single by a New Artist and Video by a New Artist.\n\nKip is currently working on a follow-up album to his successful debut. He has released two preceding singles to date, the first entitled 'Young Love' peaked on the Country chart at #26 whilst 'Dirt Road' reached #35. The album is currently untitled but is expected in 2015.\n\nRead more\n\nKip Moore is awesome to see live. He has just as much fun performing his country music as the audience does hearing it. I enjoyed him singing “Reckless.” It was so upbeat it made me want to strut my stuff! His raspy voice fits in with the rebellious content of the song and it just works. Kip's smile is just gorgeous and he was doing it the whole, I could look at that face all day. His good looks definitely don't hurt or take away from the music they are a huge plus. I went with my mother and we had a great time. We sat back and had a couple of beers, which just go great at this type of concert.\n\nKip engaged the crowd and everyone seemed really into it. We could have some rowdy fun and not have to worry about crazies like some of the rock concerts that I've been to before. People are always down on him because he sings a lot about beer, trucks, and girls but it's his lax subjects and raw talent that allow for his concerts to be such a good time. You won't go in expecting some deep emotional experience but you will have lots of dancing, clapping hands, and your face will be hurting from smiling by the end of it. My only complaint is that he does spend a lot of time at the microphone, it would be nice to see him move around some more!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nMy partner and I love Kip Moore and we saw him on his acoustic tour in May. It was so good we got tickets for the full band tour straight away, and I got tickets for my parents too as a surprise- the whole family are fans. We were not disappointed! He is absolutely amazing live, would definitely see him again if I had the opportunity. The only downside this time was that the venue wasn’t quite so suitable for us. Firstly it was quite awkward to get to from where we live and the only other options were just too far, but secondly there were no seated tickets available and my mum struggles to stand for that period of time. It didn’t stop her having a good time, but we have our fingers crossed that he comes to Bristol one day! I was looking forward to seeing Jillian Jacqueline again because she was really good as support the first time around, but unfortunately they didn’t seem to have the sound quite right for her this time. She was brilliant on the acoustic tour but this time she was a bit too loud and distorted to be able to fully appreciate her beautiful voice.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nWith his raspy, gruff vocal and incredible skill with his guitar, you could imagine Kip Moore being able to captivate an arena completely solo. However tonight he is supported by a masterful supporting band who aid the frontman in recreating music from his acclaimed debut 'Up All Night'.\n\nThe audience is instantly captivated by Moore's stage presence and are ready to cheer, sing and applaud at all the right moments. For the first two numbers Kip seems transfixed within his musical zone yet as the crowd roar in appreciation for the opening bars of 'Drive Me Crazy' the singer reveals a broad smile. He performs his hit note perfect with that recognisable vocal raspiness that adds great texture to his album.\n\nHe thanks the crowds sincerely and explains just how much passion he has for his music and for performing live. This is apparent throughout the gig, a poignant rendition of 'Don't Look Back in Anger' by Oasis gives the room a combined opinion that Kip Moore is a star very much on the rise.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThe Kip Moore concert at Innsbrook After Hours in Glen Allen on May 20 was fantastic. Kip is a superb performer. His stage presence is out of this world. He is so energetic and I love how he tells about his songwriting. So honest and thankful to be doing what he loves. I have been to eleven of his concerts and believe me, he never disappoints. He is obviously very appreciative of his fans as we are him. At all of these concerts he has stayed to sign autographs. Kip and his band, the Slow Hearts, have been my favorite since 2012 when he performed at the annual fair in a small town in Southwest Virginia. If you get the opportunity to see him live, you must!!! You will be glad you did. And you will want to go to Moore shows.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nIf you’ve never seen Kip then you are missing out! This is my third time seeing him, but first real headlining full band show (Previously at Buckeye Country Fest and acoustic show at Bosom Buddies) and I cannot say enough good things! First was the VIP, and his acoustic with Q&A was the best I’ve seen! He played a long time and he was hilarious as well! For the show he was on fire the whole time. Whether belting out the old popular ones like Somethin’ ‘Bout a Truck or playing his amazing new Guitar Man he has you captivated the whole time! He makes the audience truly feel part of the show. I hope to see many more Kip shows whenever I can possibly make it! And that includes going again tonight for back to back!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nIf you like music, all kinds of music, GO SEE KIP MOORE!! He puts on a fantastic, energizing, boot stomping, people singing, show!!!\n\nThe only 2 things I didn't care for-and he probably had no control over, was that there's no age limit. It should have been 21&up. There were waaaayyy to many kids in there pushing into everybody & the place was PACKED so it was annoying. Also, the tank top I bought had 2015 on it not 2017!! But I didn't catch the mistake til i was in the car. It was nice & tucked under on the display.\n\nBut he himself was once again, awesome. It was my 3rd kip show & I intend on being at every one in the future when he visits jersey. Thanks for the music Kip.:)\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThe show was amazing. I love the shows with seats however most of the time we spent standing and dancing around to the music because the vibe he gives out is amazing and unmatched by anyone I’ve ever seen in concert before. He then gave us multiple speeches about his experiences and then just gave out a very positive vibe. He is my favorite artist out there because his shows aren’t really planned out. He played for 2 hours straight. (9:00-11:30pm). All in all that was one of my favorite shows by him.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nAs much as I love Kip, his music, his songs, I was slightly disappointed by the lack of personal touch that this concert had. I saw him in concert last time he was in NY, and throughly enjoyed it. This time it felt rushed.\n\nThey didn't come on stage right away. Then, they rushed off. No talking. No stories. No personal touch.\n\nI missed that.\n\nIt won't deter me from going to see him again next time. But I'm hoping for better.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
