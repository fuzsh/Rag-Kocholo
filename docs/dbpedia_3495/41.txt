Arguably one of country music’s most unique and underrated artists, Kip Moore was born on this day in 1980 in Tifton, Georgia. He scored his first and only #1 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs Chart back in 2012 with “Somethin’ ‘Bout a Truck.”

In honor of another trip around the sun, let’s take a look at five songs of his that should’ve been added to your playlist, yesterday.

Payin’ Hard

We’ll start with the deepest cut out of the five. This song encapsulates the feeling of putting something off until a later time until one day there is no later time and dealing with the regret of that. Moore details how the song is written with his late father in mind in an interview with Taste of Country back in 2020.

Lipstick

On a much lighter note, Lipstick is an upbeat love song that Moore recorded to detail some of his favorite shows that he and the band have played throughout the years. With over twenty cities, states, or areas mentioned, there’s a good chance you might even hear about your hometown in the song.

Janie Blu

If you’re going strictly off of the music itself,, Janie Blu could be heard as a beautifully painted love song. It’s only when you listen to the lyrics you realize what he is describing is actually quite the opposite. Here’s Moore’s live at The Ryman version with Ashley McBryde:

Guitar Man

Kip shows off his vulnerable side on “Guitar Man” and gives us a peek behind the curtain of what life was like when he first got into the industry. It also happens to be quite the crowd favorite to close his shows out.

Everything But You

Last but certainly not least, a love song with a little bit of loss sprinkled in. Moore explains that he finally has all he’s ever wanted and dreamed of, but there is still just one thing missing. Disclaimer: Not liable for any 3 am drunk texts to your ex after listening to this song.
