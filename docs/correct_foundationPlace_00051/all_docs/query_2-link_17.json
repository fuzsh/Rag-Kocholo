        "text": "So, it has been a crazy week with very little PMP study occurring. I think a read a couple pages of Rita's book. It is bound to be like this on a regular basis. This was the first week of the new semester at school, and I think I got off on the right track; I have a few responses to get done this weekend, but they will wait until the evening. At work, I made some substantial progress on some documentation.\n\nThe wife has clinical duty on Saturday's for the next few weeks, so it is a perfect time for me to study. I started by taking my daily supplements (B-Complex 100, CDP Choline, and some Piracetem) and eating an adequate breakfast. Then, I decided that I will begin by watching some of the CBT Nuggets videos for the PMP. I will follow up by reading the corresponding chapters from Rita's and Kim's books.\n\nI kicked on the first video and decided that I needed to stop and write this post. The facilitator explains what a project is... and then he says that you can define many things as projects (true) but then takes the idea of getting to work in the morning as a project (false). The scenario that he describes does illustrate some common themes of project management, but getting to work in the morning is [usually] routine. Something like this is procedural and would be considered operational in nature, and not a project.\n\nSo, what is a project?\n\nThe PMI PMBOK 4th edition says that \"a project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.\" Since driving to work is usually done several times each week and is not unique, it does not qualify. However, developing and implementing a plan to install [or upgrade] a system, like Exchange, is a project, because you won't routinely be doing this for the same stakeholders. The regular maintenance and daily operations of the system are not a project. In fact, if a standardized process is created for installing desktop systems is created, these new systems will not be projects, rather they will be operational procedures. Creating the process is a project, however.\n\nIf I find another good point, I will stop by and provide another update.\n\n2024 Renew: [ ] AZ-204 [ ] AZ-305 [ ] AZ-400 [ ] AZ-500 [ ] Vault Assoc.\n\n2024 New: [X] AWS SAP [ ] CKA [ ] Terraform Auth/Ops Pro\n\n0 ·\n\nN2,\n\nI'll be honest with you...Project Management would have been something I would have never bothered with 10 years. However...9 years is when I got into ERP work and I saw all the PM methodology that took place. This was when IBM was really starting to get strong on the services side, and I was like \"Man, I really like this s--t...\" However, I didn't want to put in any work, so it went to the wayside....until I came to my new job. That by itself didn't do it for me...though it would be part of a number of catalysts that would make me want to put in some work. Between my readings and participation on TE, seeing a number of colleagues call themselves \"project managers\" yet can't spell process groups, or even \"lessons learned...\" I just thought to myself \"I can do this s--t, and not even that, I can do this s--t better.\"\n\nIn any event, you sound like you're working your way up on your own path...every man's path is different and sounds likes yours will be one that will take you to where you want to go/where you need to be. Things have fallen into place for me to finally get into the PMP...I'm hoping to knock out these Skillsoft courses so that I can get my 35 hours....then I have to tally up my project management work and make sure I have my 4500 hours (which I'm sure I do) across the process groups. That I think is the easy part, but I want to knock out the education requirement first.\n\nOne last note...I was very proud to see your name in the PMI registry with your CAPM and RMP certs...your name was the only one I could think of to see who should I look up. I'm kinda glad that thing exists so that people can't fake the funk. Here's hoping to my name ending up there.\n\n0 ·\n\n@Erp\n\nThe term Project Manager has been whored out beyond belief. It disgust me when I see a \"PM\" manage contracts solely or just do scheduling. I knew of one who literally did updates from a Excel sheet on a shared drive and provide a monthly update meeting, that was it!\n\nI stuck with the CAPM because I can honestly say that is the level I am at. Can I pass the PMP, no question about it, I could blow it away now. I have been reading project management material for over 6 months and I nailed the RMP when I took the exam. I just don't think I could be an effective PM unless I learned under someone who has skills in that area. Until I am AT LEAST managing the iron triangle I refuse to sit for the PMP. Like you mentioned earlier though we all have different experiences and goals. Paths that will lead us to where we want to go and I know you will get there. I just don't feel like it makes sense for me to get the PMP. The RMP made a lot of sense for me. My mentor at my last job taught me a lot about risk and how to manage it. I will be going back to the same company to work with him in a new role, but still focusing on the same principals. One of these days I would love to transition into a PM or BA role, but for now my path is service management, which is fine with me. You know the old saying, \"management is management is management\".\n\nBTW I agree about the register, it's a great tool to use. Thanks for the kind words I appreciate the support. You and PF will be in there soon enough!\n\n0 ·"
