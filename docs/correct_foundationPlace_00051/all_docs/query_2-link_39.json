        "text": "I know this blog platform has become the source of technology advice, lessons learned and general guidance for many professionals around the world. As such, I don’t often write about non-technology topics or share my personal journey, but I am hoping you will be understanding after reading of the tragedy and sorrow in my family this last week and the hope we have for our future.\n\nOn the morning of Monday 4-14-14 God brought an angel into our lives and family, Carson Isaiah Young. Carson brought joy, hope, happiness and a new level of love to all of us.\n\nOn the morning of Monday 4-4-16, Jesus carried him home to be with Him forever. My wife Stephanie, six year old daughter Jade, and almost five year old son Addison, appreciate all your thoughts and prayers as we walk through what’s next on our journey. We don’t know why things happen the way they do, but we are fully trusting our heavenly Father as He weaves a beautiful tapestry through our lives.\n\nOur family has a peace that surpasses all understanding, and we pray the same for you and your loved ones through whatever life brings your way.\n\nWhen peace, like a river, attendeth my way\n\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll;\n\nWhatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,\n\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.\n\nThis song tells the story of Horatio Spafford who wrote the words to this inspiring hymn. He was not new to tragedy in his life. He had lost his only son to an illness and lost all of his real estate investments in the Great Chicago Fire. In 1873, his family was going to sail to Europe for a much-needed vacation. He was delayed by business but sent his wife and four daughters on ahead. The ship sank in 12 minutes. His wife was among the survivors. His four daughters were not.\n\nHe immediately set sail to bring his wife home and while sailing near the place of the shipwreck he wrote this inspiring hymn. This video provides a wonderful recap of the story while listening to the hymn.\n\nIn loving memory of our precious baby boy, who loved our times as a family at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, we want to honor him with a generous donation to the foundation.\n\nThe aquarium is in the process of building a new Ocean Education and Leadership Center, and we have a unique opportunity to have a plaque dedicated in his name.\n\nOur family vacations at the aquarium once a year and this will be a special way for Dane, Stephanie, Jade and Addison to remember his innocence as a fun-loving child who adored the sea."
