Lecture Notes In Computer Sciences, , 9099–9999.\n\nAbstract: Nowadays we can perform business transactions with remote servers interconnected to Internet using our personal devices. These transactions can also be possible without any infrastructure in pure ad-hoc networks. In both cases, interacting parts are often unknown, therefore, they require some mechanism to establish ad-hoc trust relationships and perform secure transactions. Operating systems for mobile platforms support secure communication and authentication, but this support is based on hierarchical PKI. For wireless communications, they use the (in)secure protocol WEP. This paper presents a WCE security enhanced architecture allowing secure transactions, mutual authentication, and access control based on dynamic management of the trusted certificate list. We have successfully implemented our own CSP to support the new certificate management and data ciphering.\n\nKeywords:\n\nDíaz-Sánchez, D., Marín-Lopez, A., & Almenárez-Mendoza, F. (2006).

Springer Berlin Heidelberg.\n\nAbstract: Increasing efforts are placed on security solutions for nomadic users. Solutions based on smart cards offer physical and logical portability, robustness, low cost, and high security. Nevertheless, such solutions concentrate only on offering the cryptographical capabilities of the smart card, together with key and user certificate storage. Advanced trust management and access control are not addressed. In this article, we propose a scheme to include trust management and attribute certificates for authorization in two widely used cryptographic APIs: Microsoft CryptoAPI and RSA labs PKCS#11.\n\nKeywords:\n\nDíaz-Sánchez, D., Marín, A., & Alménarez, F.

Springer Berlin Heidelberg.\n\nAbstract: Mobile devices of new generation are able to connect to multiple networks and to constitute new infrastructureless networks. These dynamic environments require new security paradigms and automatic mechanisms to minimize user intervention. Our goal is the definition of a new concept of distance that considers the current domain constraints and the user preferences. This paper addresses some of the problems of these complex environments by using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) techniques. We also propose collaborative mechanisms for automatic environment marking. Based on these ideas we have developed PervsIM, a decision mechanism that selects the most appropriate network or peer to interact with. Besides we have defined an embedded access control module which ensures that PervsIM decisions are followed by all applications. Furthermore, several simulation results and implementation details outline how these results can be incorporated in today’s mobile devices.\n\nKeywords:"
