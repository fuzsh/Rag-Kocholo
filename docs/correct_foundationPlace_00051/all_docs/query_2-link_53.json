        "text": "Related Papers\n\nCloud computing has become the buzz word of the IT industry. Executives have been told it is the way to cut spending on IT. But what is all the hype about? Should we all be jumping onto the &quot;cloud&quot; bandwagon or is the cloud full of holes? This paper looks at the current literature on cloud computing to try to answer these and other questions for the IT executive, the typical manager or the layperson.\n\nDownload\n\nPsycEXTRA Dataset\n\nDownload\n\nIn spite of its potential impact on current business world, cloud computing technology still offers fertile and untapped research opportunities. We conduct a systematic literature reviews for the purpose of identifying research gaps in cloud computing literature. It included 188 referred journal and conference articles. Each article was studied carefully to understand its general theme and then extract a pattern to which the article can be classified. Our review efforts led to the identification of four cloud computing general areas: (1) benefits and risks, (2) adoption, (3) outcomes, and (4) its current state from technological and research perspectives. The study is concluded by introducing a number of research questions that need to be empirically and theoretically investigated. This review provides a reference source and classification for IS researchers interested in cloud computing, and identifies research gaps in the literature.\n\nDownload\n\nCloud computing is the latest effort in delivering computing resources as a service. It represents a shift away from computing as a product that is purchased, to computing as a service that is delivered to consumers over the internet from large-scale data centres – or “clouds”. “Cloud” computing – a relatively recent term, builds on decades of research in virtualization, distributed computing, utility computing, and more recently networking, web and software services. It implies a service oriented architecture, reduced information technology overhead for the end-user, great flexibility, reduced total cost of ownership, ondemand services and many other things. Whilst cloud computing is gaining growing popularity in the IT industry, academia appeared to be lagging behind the rapid developments in this field. This paper is the first systematic review of peer-reviewed academic research published in this field, and aims to provide an overview of the swiftly developing advances in the tec...\n\nDownload\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS & TECHNOLOGY, 2005\n\nCloud computing is an emerging model of â€œcomputing as utilityâ€ to provide convenient, on demand access to shared pool of resources. In this paper, this grooming technology is presented in terms of its basic characteristics, services provided, models, and why cloud computing is a widely accepted in business and software enterprises.\n\nDownload"
