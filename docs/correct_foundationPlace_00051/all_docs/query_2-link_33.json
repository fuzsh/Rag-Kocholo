If these two processes do not have all that the match is successful, then use the grade of service of acquiescence, also is the minimum grade of service generally.Application program port numbers/called number and grade of service correspondence table can also can be downloaded from the registers kernel network server by the administrator hand configuration.\n\nThe present invention requires the signaling system on the base station to keep two tabulations: grade of service and 802.16 medium access control (MAC) service quality (QOS) parameter correspondence table, grade of service and core net QoS parameter correspondence table.802.16 stipulated multiple QoS parameter in the agreement, when the class of service parameter that air station sends is received in the base station, inquiry service grade and 802.16 medium access control QoS parameter correspondence table, obtain the MAC QoS parameter, insert in DSA-REQ (a kind of message that defines in the 802.16-2004 agreement) administrative messag, initiate the wireless connections request to the MAC layer.After wireless connections were set up successfully, the base station signaling system was mapped as the QOS parameter of resource reservation process need to the grade of service according to the grade of service and core net QoS parameter correspondence table, initiates the resource reservation process to core net.\n\nFor core net, requirement is the wired network that the service quality guarantee system is arranged, and only provides the service quality of wireless access network to guarantee in 802.16 agreements.In order to guarantee the service quality on the core net, core net need be moved multiprotocol label switching (Multiprotocol Label Switching) and resource reservation agreements such as (Resource Reservation Protocol).Core net also will comprise aaa server, to realize that the service quality that the user proposes is carried out authentication and rate.\n\nTechnical scheme\n\nThe method for ensuring service quality of voice communication in the broadband wireless MAN: it is characterized in that utilizing the class-of-service ability of 802.16 Radio Transmission Technologys to realize the voice communication of different service quality; Utilize signaling system to finish call proceeding; The user can the specified services grade when using service, does not show the user under the situation of specified services grade that the air station signaling system can be according to the application program port and the called number mapping grade of service; MAC QoS parameter and core net QoS parameter can be shone upon according to the class of service parameter that air station sends in the base station, initiate wireless connections foundation and core network resource reservation process, enjoy different service quality according to the difference of the grade of service to realize different callings.\n\nThe method for ensuring service quality of voice communication in a kind of broadband wireless MAN, Access Network adopts the broadband wireless MAN based on 802.16 agreements, core net adopts the cable network with service quality guarantee system based on IPv6, utilize the signaling system that designs voluntarily to guarantee the foundation of voice communication, the user can be when using service the specified services grade, signaling system by air station SS end is sent to the base station BS signaling system to class of service parameter, if the user does not have the specified services grade, the air station signaling system is according to the port numbers or telephone number type (the urgent call class of application program that the user uses, the ordinary call class, special calling class etc.) search the default service grade of service this time, initiate service request according to the selected grade of service to the base station signaling system, the base station signaling system is searched the grade of service and 802.16 media access control MAC service quality QOS parameter correspondence table and the grade of service and core net QoS parameter correspondence table according to the class of service parameter that air station sends, obtain the 802.16MAC QoS parameter of this grade of service correspondence, the base station is initiated dynamic service flow according to these QoS parameters to air station and is added request DSA-REQ, set up the radio channel of corresponding with service quality, initiate the core network resource reservation process according to the core net QoS parameter of finding to core net, the data channel that once has service quality to guarantee is set up and is finished.\n\nThe signaling system that the present invention needs a cover to design is voluntarily supported, this cover signaling protocol comprises processes such as authentication, mandate, charging, resource reservation, encryption, can improve the fail safe and the reliability of voice communication under the radio packet network environment, and guarantee the service quality of voice communication.Method step comprises: after the mobile platform started, need be by the authentication of authentication and authorization charging server, and its current address is registered to registrar; When a Mobile Origination during to the audio call of another travelling carriage, at first need authentication by the base station, obtain the address and the PKI of called mobile station then from registrar, the user can specify the grade of service of service this time, the grade of service of voice communication is encapsulated into to be connected to set up with safety information sends to network in the signaling message, network node is reserved enough wired and Radio Resources, and finally call request is transmitted to called mobile station, thereby realize two voice communications between the travelling carriage.\n\nWireless and the wire link with respective service quality is set up according to the grade of service and 802.16 media access control MAC service quality QOS parameter correspondence table and the grade of service and the core net QoS parameter correspondence table of self maintained in the base station,\n\nThe method for ensuring service quality of voice communication in the described broadband wireless MAN, wherein, the air station signaling system need be kept an application program port numbers/called number and grade of service correspondence table, and this table can also can be downloaded from the registers kernel network server by the administrator hand configuration; The base station signaling system need be safeguarded two tables, grade of service and 802.16 media access control MAC service quality QOS parameter correspondence table, grade of service and core net QoS parameter correspondence table."
