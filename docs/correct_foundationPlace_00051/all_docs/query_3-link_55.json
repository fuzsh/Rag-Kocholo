        "text": "Bachelors of Science in Computer Science The foundation of my education, studies began early with four computer science courses in the freshman year alone. Always believing not in learning individual languages but rather building the complex thinking and problem solving skills needed to accomplish a goal. Senior year consisted of a full year course, Senior Design where as a team my group and I built a new class scheduling web application which is still used today. Hoboken, New Jersey, USA\n\nLead Software Engineer (Java Performance) Architect leading the design and implementation of Dynatrace DCRUM (Data Center Real User Monitoring). Instrumenting business critical branch applications to provide real user experience monitoring and quick fault domain isolation across the various application tiers. Managing the IBM ITCAM Synthetic Monitoring infrastructure, I was also tasked with migrating event logic from IBM Omnibus to BMC BPPM. Writing of custom scripts in shell and python in order to manipulate the data that would be mapped to tokens as well as provide additional functionality not found within the applications. During critical events, I have provided fault domain and deep dive analysis using the various Application Performance Monitoring toolsets we have at our disposal. Columbus, Ohio, USA | https://www.pnc.com\n\nIT Associate Analyst At the start of my career, I had the opportunity to join Schering-Plough's leadership rotational program. This program gave me exposure to various departments within Information Technology such as Messaging, Collaboration, Workstation Engineering, Client Computing Services and Data Storage and Backup. During the early stages of the merger with Merck I had the chance to take a position with the Enterprise Monitoring Services team. This is where I learned not only the skills needed to excel within the Application Performance Monitoring space but also that I greatly enjoyed working in this area. I designed and implemented architectural changes to the Dynatrace DCRUM monitoring solution and worked with application teams regularly showing how APM benefited the company.
