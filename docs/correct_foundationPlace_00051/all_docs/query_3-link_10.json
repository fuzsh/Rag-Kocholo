        "text": "MQTT Quality of Service (QoS) is an agreement between the message sender and receiver that defines the level of delivery guarantee for a specific message. Here’s Part 6 of MQTT Essentials, where we will look deeper at the different Quality of Service (QoS) levels in MQTT. If you are looking to understand MQTT Topics, Wildcards, & Best Practices, check out Part 5 of the series. Else, let’s dive in.\n\nWhat is Quality of Service (QoS) in MQTT?\n\nMQTT provides three levels of QoS:\n\nAt most once (QoS 0)\n\nAt least once (QoS 1)\n\nExactly once (QoS 2)\n\nHow to Examine Message Delivery in MQTT?\n\nWhen discussing QoS in MQTT, it’s important to consider message delivery from the publishing client to the broker and from the broker to the subscribing client. These two aspects of message delivery have subtle differences.\n\nThe client that publishes a message to the broker defines the QoS level for the message during transmission. The broker then transmits the message to subscribing clients using the QoS level defined by each subscribing client during the subscription process. If the subscribing client defines a lower QoS level than the publishing client, the broker will transmit the message with the lower QoS level.\n\nUnderstanding how message delivery works in MQTT sets the foundation for appreciating the significance of Quality of Service (QoS) levels in ensuring reliable communication between the publishing client, broker, and subscribing client.\n\nWhy is Quality of Service (QoS) Important?\n\nQuality of Service (QoS) is crucial in MQTT due to its role in providing the client with the ability to select a service level that aligns with both the network reliability and the application’s requirements. MQTT’s inherent capability to handle message re-transmission and ensure delivery, even in unreliable network conditions, makes QoS essential for facilitating seamless communication in such challenging environments. By offering different QoS levels, MQTT empowers clients to optimize their network usage and achieve the desired balance between reliability and efficiency.\n\nNow that we understand the significance of Quality of Service (QoS) in MQTT, let’s delve into the inner workings of QoS and explore how it operates to ensure reliable message delivery in varying network conditions.\n\nHow does QoS 0 work in MQTT?\n\nAt the lowest level, QoS 0 in MQTT offers a best-effort delivery mechanism where the sender does not expect an acknowledgment or guarantee of message delivery. This means that the recipient does not acknowledge receiving the message, and the sender does not store or re-transmit it. QoS 0, commonly called “fire and forget,” functions akin to the underlying TCP protocol, where the message is sent without further follow-up or confirmation.\n\nQuality of Service level 0: delivery at most once\n\nHow does QoS 1 work in MQTT?\n\nIn QoS 1 of MQTT, the focus is on ensuring message delivery at least once to the receiver. When a message is published with QoS 1, the sender keeps a copy of the message until it receives a PUBACK packet from the receiver, confirming the successful receipt. If the sender doesn’t receive the PUBACK packet within a reasonable time frame, it re-transmits the message to ensure its delivery.\n\nQuality of Service level 1: delivery at least once\n\nUpon receiving the message, the receiver can process it immediately. For example, if the receiver is an MQTT broker, it distributes the message to all subscribing clients and responds with a PUBACK packet to acknowledge the receipt of the message.\n\nMQTT PUBACK packet\n\nIt’s important to note that in QoS 1, if the publishing client sends the same message again, it sets a duplicate (DUP) flag. However, this flag is used for internal purposes and is not processed by the broker or client. Regardless of the DUP flag, the receiver still sends a PUBACK packet to acknowledge the receipt of the message, ensuring the sender is aware of the successful delivery.\n\nThis approach of QoS 1 strikes a balance between reliability and efficiency, guaranteeing that the message reaches the receiver at least once while allowing for potential duplicates to be handled appropriately.\n\nHow does QoS 2 work in MQTT?\n\nQoS 2 offers the highest level of service in MQTT, ensuring that each message is delivered exactly once to the intended recipients. To achieve this, QoS 2 involves a four-part handshake between the sender and receiver.\n\nMQTT Quality of Service level 2: delivery exactly once\n\nWhen a receiver gets a QoS 2 PUBLISH packet from a sender, it processes the publish message accordingly and replies to the sender with a PUBREC packet that acknowledges the PUBLISH packet. If the sender does not get a PUBREC packet from the receiver, it sends the PUBLISH packet again with a duplicate (DUP) flag until it receives an acknowledgment.\n\nMQTT PUBREC Packet\n\nOnce the sender receives a PUBREC packet from the receiver, the sender can safely discard the initial PUBLISH packet. The sender stores the PUBREC packet from the receiver and responds with a PUBREL packet, the receiver discards all stored states and replies with a PUBCOMP packet.\n\nMQTT PUBREL Packet\n\nAfter the receiver gets the PUBREL packet, it can discard all stored states and answer with a PUBCOMP packet (the same is true when the sender receives the PUBCOMP). Until the receiver completes processing and sends the PUBCOMP packet back to the sender, the receiver stores a reference to the packet identifier of the original PUBLISH packet. This step is important to avoid processing the message a second time.\n\nAfter the sender receives the PUBCOMP packet, the packet identifier of the published message becomes available for reuse.\n\nMQTT PUBCOMP Packet\n\nWhen the QoS 2 flow is complete, both parties are sure that the message is delivered and the sender has confirmation of the delivery.\n\nIf a packet gets lost along the way, the sender is responsible to retransmit the message within a reasonable amount of time. This is equally true if the sender is an MQTT client or an MQTT broker. The recipient has the responsibility to respond to each command message accordingly.\n\nWhat are the Key Considerations for QoS in MQTT?\n\nWhile understanding QoS in MQTT, there are several important aspects to keep in mind:\n\nDowngrade of QoS\n\nThe QoS levels defined by the sender and receiver can differ. The client sending the message to the broker defines the QoS level, while the broker uses the QoS defined by the receiver during subscription. For example, if the sender uses QoS 2 and the receiver subscribes with QoS 1, the broker delivers the message to the receiver with QoS 1. This can result in multiple deliveries of the same message to the receiver.\n\nPacket identifiers are unique per client\n\nPacket identifiers used for QoS 1 and 2 are unique between a specific client and a broker within an interaction. However, they are not unique across all clients. Once a flow is complete, the packet identifier becomes available for reuse. This is why the packet identifier does not need to exceed 65535 , as it is unrealistic for a client to send more messages than that without completing an interaction\n\nWhat are the Best Practices While Using MQTT Quality of Service (QoS) 0,1, & 2?\n\nWe are often asked for advice about how to choose the correct QoS level. Selecting the appropriate QoS level depends on your specific use case. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:\n\nUse QoS 0 when:\n\nYou have a completely or mostly stable connection between sender and receiver. A classic use case for QoS 0 is connecting a test client or a front end application to an MQTT broker over a wired connection.\n\nYou don’t mind if a few messages are lost occasionally. The loss of some messages can be acceptable if the data is not that important or when data is sent at short intervals\n\nYou don’t need message queuing. Messages are only queued for disconnected clients if they have QoS 1 or 2 and a persistent session.\n\nUse QoS 1 when:\n\nYou need to get every message and your use case can handle duplicates. QoS level 1 is the most frequently used service level because it guarantees the message arrives at least once but allows for multiple deliveries. Of course, your application must tolerate duplicates and be able to process them accordingly.\n\nYou can’t bear the overhead of QoS 2. QoS 1 delivers messages much faster than QoS 2.\n\nUse QoS 2 when:\n\nIt is critical to your application to receive all messages exactly once. This is often the case if a duplicate delivery can harm application users or subscribing clients. Be aware of the overhead and that the QoS 2 interaction takes more time to complete.\n\nQueuing of QoS 1 and 2 messages\n\nAll messages sent with QoS 1 and 2 are queued for offline clients until the client is available again. However, this queuing is only possible if the client has a persistent session.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat’s the end of Part 6 of our MQTT Essentials series. We hope that you find this information useful. In the next article, we cover a subject that is closely associated with Quality of Service levels: persistent sessions in MQTT."
