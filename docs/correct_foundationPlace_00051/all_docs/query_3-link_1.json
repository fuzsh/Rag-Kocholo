        "text": "Software giant CA has announced a definitive agreement to acquire network performance management vendor NetQoS for US$200m (AU$232m).\n\nCA products and technology group executive vice president Ajei Gopal said that NetQoS adds network flow monitoring, unified communications management and response time analytic network solutions to CA's service assurance and delivery platform.\n\n\"With NetQoS, CA will further strengthen its ability to help enterprise IT organisations and service providers deliver cost-effective IT and business services,” she said.\n\nNetQoS chief executive Joel Trammell said that customers would benefit from CA’s development capabilities, salesforce and global customer support infrastructure.\n\nCA hopes to integrate its CA eHealth Network Performance Manager, and Spectrum Infrastructure Manager with the NetQoS Performance Centre, and link transaction views of the infrastructure, to both its Wily Application Performance Management package and the NetQoS Performance Centre.\n\n\"A 360-degree view of applications will provide customers with both an outside-in and inside-out perspective of their business and IT services,\" said CA in a company statement.\n\nWhen the takeover closes, Trammell will join CA as senior vice president and general manager, and NetQoS chief technology officer Cathy Fulton will become CA senior vice president for software engineering.\n\nNetQoS will operate as an independent entity within CA’s Infrastructure Management and Automation business unit initially reporting to Gopal. CA anticipates no job losses.\n\nCA hopes the takeover will complete by the end of the year pending regulatory approvals."
