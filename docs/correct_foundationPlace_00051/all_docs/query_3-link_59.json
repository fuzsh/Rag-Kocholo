I had two readings, one from a Cosmic Tribe tarot cards, another from the Goddess deck.\n\nMy first question – if I was going to implement a focus for my work, what should it be? Challenge card: Art. I should find the art thread underneath my work. My focus shouldn’t be on a cause, organization or topic but on what I bring to the activities/initiatives. Action card: Strength. clarity of vision. art & creativity at my core. need to start saying no. Overview card: 10 of Swords. sometimes stuck and don’t know how to exit. Need to build team that can leave in charge and move on.\n\nMy second question – how should I further engage young people. Challenge card: Six of Stave. create excitement or buzz. figure out how to excite. Action card: Eight of Pintacles about growing things. Plant seed & lay foundation. empower. Overview card: Wisdom card toot own horn a bit so kids can find me. Define what want to pass along & hang out my shingle."
