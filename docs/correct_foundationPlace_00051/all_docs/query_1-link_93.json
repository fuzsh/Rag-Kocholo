undercover writer working for the Australian Broadcasting Corp. gained access to the personal data, including birth certificate information, telephone numbers, and ATM card numbers, of many Australian customers. The writer was allegedly able to find the infor- mation for sale by outsourcers in India. The country's National Association of Software and Service Companies has asked for details of the breach and has begun compiling a reg- istry of workers hired in Indian call centers as a result of this and other recent data security concerns. India currently employs about 350,000 workers in the BPO sector. I Firefox Loses Share The Mozilla Foundation's Firefox Web browser lost market share in July for the first time in several months, according to Web site monitoring company NetApplications.com. Microsoft's Internet Explorer regained share, going from 86.56% of the market in June to 87.2% in July; Firefox' s share dropped from 8.71% in June to 8.07% in July. NetApplica- tions.com has said that Firefox would likely earn acceptance in the business market if it was able to gain 10% of the market. Since the first of this year, Firefox had been gaining between 0.5% and 1% share a month. I Profitable Second Quarter For Dell Dell reported its earnings for the second quarter were up 32% over last year, totaling $1.02 billion. Likewise, its revenue was up 15% over Q2 2004 at $13.4 billion. Dell, the No. 1 computer maker in the United States, said its second-quarter figures were bolstered by sales of its mobility products, storage systems, software and peripherals, and enhanced services. The company reports shipping 9.1 million computer systems in Q2, including 2.7 million portable products. Dell expects Q3 revenue to total between $14.1 and $14.5 billion, with back-to- school sales, corporate customers, and continued growth in overseas markets providing a boost. I Investor Asks Time Warner To Split Carl Icahn, a billionaire investor with holdings in Time Warner, urged the company to separate its cable and content businesses and repurchase $20 billion in shares. While Time Warner has done a good job managing the busi- ness, Icahn says, the company has not enhanced shareholder value in the company. Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons will reportedly meet with Icahn to discuss his views. Icahn works with several hedge funds, including Franklin Mutual Advisors, JANA Partners, and SAC Capital Advisors. Together they own more than 120 million Time Warner shares. I Study Links Customer Satisfaction, Business Success According to researchers at the University of Michigan and ForeSee Results, there's one attribute many people may not think of when pondering the success of Google and Yahoo!: Customer satisfaction at those companies is extremely high. Both companies have nearly doubled their revenues and earned high ratings (Google an 82 and Yahoo! an 80) on the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index). Contrast that to MSN and AOL, which have both had minimal growth lately and scored 75 and 71, respectively, on the index. The ACSI also ranked satisfaction in the PC category: Apple scored an 81, followed by Dell with a 74. I HP SMB Executive To Leave Kevin Gilroy, HP's senior vice president and general manager of worldwide SMB operations, will leave the company at the end of next month. An HP spokesperson said Gilroy's posi- tion has been cut in the company's reorganiza- tion plans, and Todd Bradley, the executive vice president of the company's Personal Systems Group, will take over Gilroy's SMB marketing duties. Sources close to HP report that the com- pany plans to phase out its Customer Solutions Group, which Gilroy's position was part of, and move those sales and marketing responsibilities to individual product units. I New E-filing System For Patent Office The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office plans to implement a new Web-based e-filing system that it will begin beta testing at the end of the year. Most applicants submit their forms via traditional mail, which makes the Patent Office the \"largest recipient of overnight mail in the world,\" says Deputy Commissioner for Patent Operations Margaret Focarino. Currently, less than 2% of patent filings come via the old e-filing system, which is a cumber- some, complicated process. With the new, simpler system, users would enter their infor- mation in a Web-based Patent Office database and save it on the office's server. I Ex-WorldCom CFO Sentenced Scott Sullivan, the former CFO of WorldCom, was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the company's account- ing scandal that involved misstatements meant to boost the company's share price. Last year, Sullivan pleaded guilty to several charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors who were trying to prosecute WorldCom's former CEO Bernard Ebbers. In July, Ebbers was sentenced to 25 years in jail. Several other former WorldCom executives have also recently been sentenced, bringing an end to the scandal. WorldCom now operates as MCI, which emerged from bankruptcy last year and is now merging with Verizon Communications. I Technology Trade Association Seeks Higher H-1B Limit Following the U.S. Citizenship and Immigra- tion Services' announcement this month that the limit for H-1B visas has been met for next year, the largest high-tech trade group in the United States, the AeA, said it was seeking reform of the current immigration laws. The AeA's Senior Vice President for Domestic Policy John Palafoutas said in a statement, \"We should keep the world's best and brightest here in the U.S. to help strengthen our economy.\" The H-1B cap Congress set for next year is 65,000, with 6,800 reserved for Singapore and Chile. I Fastest Worm Ever Detected Researchers discovered the Zotob worm, which takes advantage of recently found flaws in Windows. Trend Micro claims the Zotob worm can infect Windows computers faster than any previously discovered worm. It copies itself into the Windows SYSTEM folder and prevents the user from getting help at online antivirus Web sites. It can also connect to an IRC server, potentially giving hackers control over a system. The worm infected systems at ABC, CNN, and The New York Times, among other companies. Microsoft had issued fixes for the worm earlier but companies hadn't implemented them. I HP Wants To Enter Superwide-Format Printing Market HP announced a deal to purchase Scitex Vision, a company that specializes in super- wide digital printers. The deal is expected to cost HP about $230 million and will need to be approved by shareholders and regulators. HP sees wide-format signage as a huge growth opportunity, possibly doubling in the next five years. Scitex' s current lineup includes printers that can handle sizes up to 16 feet for printing items such as billboards and banners; HP's current largest printers can only handle sizes up to 5 feet. Israel-based Scitex Vision has a presence in 75 countries and subsidiaries in five countries, including the United States.

Barcodes are literally everywhere, and that means there's still a demand for equipment to read them. Picking the right device for a specific application is not neces- sarily a simple task. All the major vendors offer devices suited for different applications. A low-cost wired scanner wouldn't work in a warehouse situation. At the same time, you probably don't need a ruggedized handheld device for a point-of-sale solution. Choosing a vendor often in- volves more than just selecting a piece of hardware. Selecting a package solution that includes both hardware and software is fre- quently the best approach, espe- cially for the smaller business that doesn't have the expertise to build from scratch. POSmicro is a supplier of hard- ware and software for the small to medium- sized enterprise market. \"We cater to the small to medium business and offer a total solu- tion,\" says Mario Giampieri, CEO of POSmicro. \"Some of our cus- tomers do use a hardware scanner along with a product like Micro- soft Access to track their invento- ry, but most of them don't have the skill or desire or time to do it themselves,\" says Giampieri. The Microsoft Retail Man- agement System Store Opera- tions is a comprehensive software package offering POS, inventory, payments, and ordering. It's only sold through Microsoft Certified Partners such as POSmicro with the staff experience to both install the hardware and software and provide service after the sale. Barcode Basics Reading and interpreting a barcode works basically the same way regardless of the device. At the simplest level, Buying Tips you use a light source and a sen- sor to tell the difference between the lines and the spaces. The accuracy of the reader depends in large part on the sensitivity of the sensor and the intensity of the light source. More sensitive sensors cost more money. Most people are familiar with the traditional barcode of vertical lines of varying width. The Uni- versal Product Code has been in use since 1973 in the United States and Canada. UPC-A uses a series of 12 digits to encode a manufacturer and a specific prod- uct from that manufacturer. UPC- E uses the same technique but only eight characters and is suit- able for labeling small packages. The 128 code uses a similar lin- ear technique to encode all 128 ASCII characters and is the basis of the UCC/EAN-128 (Euro- pean Article Numbering-Uniform Code Council) standard. There's also a newer 2D form of the bar- code and the stacked barcode standard, which is a combination of both. Symbol Technologies defined the PDF 417 code that uses the two-dimensional stacked technique to store up to 1,800 printable ASCII characters in a symbol and is used on FedEx shipping labels. Once the scanner has read and interpreted the barcode, it must send it on to the computer for pro- cessing. This is done in one of several ways. The first method is something called a keyboard wedge. With this technique the keyboard plugs into the scanner and then the scanner into the computer. When you scan an item, it looks to the software like you typed the UPC into the com- puter manually. Wireless is a whole different ballgame. At this point the wire- less devices are being used most- ly for inventory purposes in a warehouse situation. For this application the most common device uses 802.11b, just like a wireless computer connection. In fact, it actually is a computer and Know where the scanner will be used. If it will be a multipurpose device, you will want to spend a little more to get the right product for the job. Understand the types of barcodes you will need to scan. Some scanners only read the 1 D Linear codes, so make sure you understand your needs. Consider using an integrator for big projects. There are many good sys- tems integrators out there that know the hardware and software to get your project going and provide service after the sale. communicates with a host ma- chine using TCP/IP. A number of vendors offer Bluetooth-based wireless scanners primarily for the POS envi- ronment. Bluetooth has a maximum range of 10 meters, or a little over 33 feet. While that's more than enough range for most checkout stands, it could be too much if you have more than one, depending on the vendor. Symbol Technologies Symbol Technologies is the market leader for hand- held scanning devices and sells different models for dif- ferent applications. When you begin the search for a barcode scanning device, it's important to understand the re- quirements for the device's use. The operating environment will determine if you'll need a rug- gedized unit or not. It will also drive the need for a hands-free or handheld device. Symbol Technologies makes a scanner for almost every applica- tion conceivable. It especially excels in ruggedized devices. When your business depends on the accuracy of your inventory, you want a reliable data gathering Snapshot Symbol Technologies LS3408-FZ: $538; LS3408-ER: $760; LS2208: $240 Solid products built to last that won't become obsolete when new barcode standards are released www.Processor.com/Symbol device that that won't become obsolete with the next wave of barcode standards. The Symbol LS3408 series are corded devices that perform very well reading standard ID barcodes in harsh environments. A wireless model, LS3478, is also available. For milder environments there's the LS2208 for ID codes. MetroLogic MetroLogic's Voyager product family includes a number of dif- ferent models designed to address specific market segments from point-of-sale to inventory to com- mercial and warehouse applica- tions. The VoyagerCG products Snapshot Metrologic Instruments VoyagerBT: $740, $778 if upgraded with memory chip; VoyagerCG: $450 Variety of products to meet the needs of different applications; Metrologic's new Bluetooth devices provide another method of connecting wirelessly www.Processor.com/Metrologic deliver a high performance laser scanning device for either a hand- held or hands-free environment.

The VoyagerBT series adds Bluetooth vl.l connectivity to a ID scanner. \"We have seen a higher than expected interest in our Bluetooth devices,\" says Mark Schmidt, senior vice presi- dent of marketing for MetroLogic. \"Bluetooth is not without issues such as interference and security. It's pretty obvious if you think about it that cords are the No. 1 failure item for a typical handheld scanner, so a wireless solution really makes sense,\" says Schmidt.

August 26, 2005 Processor.com Cisco's Acquisition Binge What's In It For SMEs? by Bruce Gain • • • Cisco has been busy lately spending its billions in cash reserves to add networking IP and know-how to its already stupen- dous IP war chest. Some of the companies Cisco has recently bought include FineGround Net- works, M.I. Secure, Vihana, Top- spin Communications, Sipura Technology, and Airespace. But what, if anything, will Cisco's buying binge mean for the small to medium-sized enterprise? According to some analysts, Cisco's track record of catering to the needs of the SME is less than stellar. Boosting its presence as the world's largest Is Nokia Cisco's Next Buyout Target? An article earlier this month in the British newspaper The Business stating that Cisco was mulling buying the world's largest hand- set maker Nokia fueled numerous media reports— and Nokia's share price. However, Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers reportedly negated the possibility of such a large merger. Many analysts shared his negative view of the possibility. One analyst said, \"It would make little sense for Cisco to acquire an OEM busi- ness that is struggling to maintain profits and keep a technology lead in what is becoming a low- margin sector.\" t networking solutions pro- vider by buying smaller companies will certain- ly not diminish its SME offerings and services. However, many do not foresee a great difference in the wake. \"The thing about gobbling companies up means that you have to integrate management tool sets. There are also a lot of arguments in- ternally within or- ganizations among people who think that their stuff is best,\" says James Governor, an analyst for RedMonk. \"A lot of the best peo- ple then leave. . . . The world does not begin and end with Cisco.\" More Than Plugging Holes However, the fact remains that Cisco is the largest network solu- tions provider and has the widest breadth of options for security applications, says Jeff Wilson, an analyst for Infonetics Research. \"Cisco is a really strong vendor when it comes to security, and a lot of people outside of the securi- ty world do not realize how much money they make with their core security products,\" Wilson says. \"They are already the No. 1 play- er for VPN and firewall software and hardware with over 30% of the revenue in that market.\" Establishing itself as the leader for SMEs, as well as large enter- prises involved both acquisitions and internal development, Wilson says. \"Security was not a core competency of Cisco about five years ago, and it is starting to be now. Anywhere in security you are going to have a lot of small S>n« 9 companies developing technology and IP that is really designed for acquisition,\" Wilson says. \"There is so much going on in security that you have to fill holes, and some of those holes you fill with internal development and some make sense financially to just pick people up. A lot of those acquisitions are also not going to be standalone products but will be part of a Cisco product line.\" But for the SME, these acquisi- tions will still not have a tremen- dous effect, Wilson says. \"With Cisco and the SME, over time functionality trickles down into the SME's product category after it has already been built into the enterprise products,\" Wilson says. \"Once the pricing makes sense, it then sort of trickles down into the SME space. They don't drive a lot of devel- opment, and a lot of its products are not opti- mized for SME use.\" Cisco's $16 Billion Buyout Budget Cisco's ability to add IP and products to its different business groups through ac- quisition has been made possible by the company's gi-gan- tesque amount of cash on hand. According to Carmi Levy, an analyst for Info-Tech Research Group, the sum total of Cisco's \"fairly large wad of cash\" is over $16 billion. {Disclaimer: Info-Tech analysts write a regular column for Processor.) \"Rather than choosing to sit on it, Cisco is instead aggressively pursuing a two-track strategy by first strengthening its core net- working products by acquiring Recent Cisco Acquisitions Page 9 known security firms with prov- en technology and expanding its influence into new areas that allow it to leverage its core strengths in previously untapped markets,\" Levy says. \"Four areas of note include Internet telephony equipment, optical networking, storage, and wireless.\" M.I. Secure and FineGround stick out among the spate of Cisco's recent acquisitions be- cause these companies should help Cisco's drive to tighten the security of its core networking products, Levy says. \"It's no secret that Cisco has had a bad year, with its routers experiencing a series of embarrassing vulnerabilities,\" Levy says. \"The company's response to these issues has also come under scrutiny — it has either been too slow, too draconian, or both. In any case, its previously unshakable rep- utation as the absolutely trustwor- thy provider of Tier 1 networking equipment has been shaken.\" These two acquisitions should thus bolster its technology — and reputation — in this area and give it increased flexibility to develop connectivity options with a great- er degree of scalability, Levy says. \"SMEs clearly fall into this target zone, and I see them deriv- ing benefit from a broader range of products and services in the not-too-distant future as a result of these acquisitions,\" Levy says. \"In any market a resurgence by the dominant player often stimu- lates competitors to follow suit, so this can only be good news for SMEs, who will enjoy increased selection, competitive pricing, and response — both from Cisco, as well as from other vendors.\" Cisco has been busy buying companies late- ly. While the buyouts have ranged in magni- tude, they all add intel- lectual property and know-how to help fur- ther secure Cisco's position as the world's largest networking solutions providers.

Despite a recent scuffle with a researcher at the Black Hat con- ference over intellectual property issues and security concerns, ana- lysts note that Cisco's network security reputation is nearly untar- nished. \"Cisco makes network equipment that works, and they're very quick in issuing patches if there's a concern,\" says Forrester Cisco Products & Services Specialized For The SME Cisco 2800 Series Routers • Powered by Cisco IOS software • Supports the company's self-defending network with advanced security services and management capabilities • Web-based router and security device manager is preinstalled • Supports Layer 2 switching with Power over Ethernet • Enhanced network analysis and traffic management tools Cisco 800 Series • Powered by Cisco IOS software • Designed for small offices or teleworker sites as part of an enterprise network • Advanced quality of service features that prioritize voice, video, and data applications • Integrated security services Linksys To Cisco Trade-Up Program • Provides scalability for SMEs with lower-cost Linksys systems by offering investment protection of up to 100% of the purchase price of Linksys products Processor.com Research analyst Laura Koetzle. \"They do what they have to do to make a system work.\" Finance Plan In addition to taking a look at network equipment, SMEs may want to consider Cisco's services as well, says Ed Daly, the compa- ny 's director of customer advo- cacy. He notes that a number of services have been expanded or tailored for smaller enterprises. In particular, Cisco has been trying to draw more SMEs to its financing plans, which it be- lieves can support data centers through flexible leasing options, long-term payments, and inte- gration of equipment with man- aged services. \"The need for security and scal- ability is acute at many smaller enterprises, but some can't afford to build the kind of infrastructure they want,\" says Daly. \"That's why we've broadened our financ- ing plans, so companies can miti- gate immediate capital expenses or work within a limited budget.\" Daly recommends that SMEs work with Cisco to come up with the kind of financing they'd like to have and talk to the company about its general programs or leasing through one of its chan- nel partners. Another useful service for SME customers is the company's Small Business Network Designer, which assists companies in creating a scalable network. Cisco sends the SME an extensive questionnaire, and after examining the results, the company creates a network design with recommendations about topology, products, and installation. Similarly, Cisco also features a product advisor section on its Web site, which can narrow down networking products based on features and business require- ments. If more than one product is August 26, 2005 rep has, and no new reps will be hired. \"We've been really working to supplement our channel with partners that specialize in ways to make us a better vendor for the SME,\" says Alexander. \"From a products and services SMEs may consider Cisco's services as well, says Ed Daly, the company's director of customer advocacy. He notes that a number of services have been tailored for smaller enterprises. appropriate for a data center, they're compared on a feature-by- feature basis, so IT departments can fine-tune their requirements. Channel Surfing A major change that has just begun and has yet to play out fully is Cisco's reorganization of its account representatives. Al- though the company won't give details on how a revamp might change its operations, it's likely that SMEs are going to have to get cozier with channel partners in the future. Over the past six months in particular, Cisco has been broad- ening its channel partners and bringing on more that are geared toward SME needs, possibly in preparation for changes to its account rep structure. Some ana- lysts are predicting that Cisco's reorganization will cut down the number of accounts that each perspective, we feel this will benefit our customers.\" In other words, the bad news is that unless you're one of the most important accounts in a rep's ter- ritory, it' s probable that there will be more contact with channel partners than Cisco reps. But the good news is that since the com- pany is bringing on partners at a rapid pace, it's easier than ever to find a local partner that clicks with your business. As Cisco's SME initiatives begin to blossom more fully, look to the company for some competitive pricing, SME-specific deals, and strategic services, Alexander says. Products that were once bound for larger enterprises will also be examined to see how they fit into SME plans. He says, \"We see a lot of opportunity to broaden product lines but also to help SMEs in terms of ease of deployment, inte- gration, and functionality.\" Monitor www.Processor.com/SD Starting at $229 Acer AL1 91 2B Flat Panel LCD 19-inch Flat Panel LCD 1280x 1024 Resolution 16ms Response Time iSmarterDeals.com the world's smartest shopping 39120 Argonaut Way, Suite 324 Fremont, CA 94538 Phone:(510)938-0978 Fax: (510)217-4118 Monitor Accessory www.Processor.com/Ophit DVI, VGA, S-Video, Video image signal to DVI signal •Input: 1 VGA, 1DVI, 1 S-VIDEO, 1 VIDEO » Output : 1 DVI ► Compatible with DVI standard » Power Supply : DC +12V, Power Consumption: 9W max » OSD control for various Input Signal » Supports SXGA, XGA, VGA OPHIT 1265 N.

Alan Gahtan, an IT lawyer at Gahtan Law Office in Ontario, Canada, has a wealth of information for his North American clients who are interested in saving money. \"If you can't afford a lawyer, there are two important things worth doing: Closely review and try to have removed provisions which make you liable, such as indemnities, and look through the contract and request mutuality. For exam- ple if a limitation of liability protects the other party, why not make it mutual so that it also protects you? In many cases asking for mutuality makes the other side reconsider whether a particular provision should be included in the contract.\" Gahtan offers another important sugges- tion. \"If there is a problem, make sure you Going It Alone Sometimes it makes sense not to hire a lawyer. This is especially true when it comes to writing contracts between a company and its vendors. If you decide to go it alone, here are a few useful suggestions: • Closely review and remove provisions that make you liable. • Look through the contract and request mutuality. For example, if a limitation of lia- bility protects the other party, make it mutu- al so that it also protects you. • Make sure you have a way out of a prob- lem. At the very least, make sure you can easily walk away from the contract if the other party is not delivering as promised. have a way out; while you may not be look- ing for the addition of strong liability provi- sions, at least make sure you can easily walk away from the contract if the other party is not delivering as promised. If you are a customer, watch out for provisions which require you to pay early termination fees if you need to terminate for the suppli- er' s lack of performance.\" It's important to keep contracts on topic. Gahtan says, \"With respect to relevancy, it's probably better to try and get a copy of a contract which is specific to your need rather than trying to adapt a very different type of contract. There are many sources of contract forms available on the Internet at low or no cost.\" He says if SMEs intend to involve a lawyer, they should ask the lawyer whether it would be more cost efficient to provide a draft contract for review or whether it would be better to allow the lawyer to adapt one of the precedents she may have. In many cases, Gahtan says, it ends up costing more to review and correct a contract drafted by a client than it would for an experienced lawyer with good precedents to generate a new contract for a particular transaction. Sometimes It Is In keeping with controlling costs when you do need to hire a lawyer, a good way to hold down costs is to find a lawyer you can rely on, says Karen D. Powell, partner at Petrillo & Powell, a Washington, D.C.,- based law firm. \"Have them draft standard agreements for your company to use, such as a purchase order, services agreement, and technology license. The standard form can be used for future transactions without too much variation.\" Powell says if you use the same law- yer who prepared the forms, there will be clear savings, as those forms are most often recycled on other transactions. She warns, however, \"Keep in mind that if you use a different lawyer, they will most likely gener- ate their own text and you will end up pay- ing twice.\" Powell suggests getting into an arrangement where you can call your lawyer and, in a quick conversation, run through the risks and options of a proposed transaction. If the lawyer is business savvy, Powell says, she can give enough guidance in a short 15 minute call to allow a company to write up a complete transaction on its own. Page 11 Powell also says keeping the same lawyer will pay off in the end. \"You need to invest time in educating the lawyer about your busi- ness, and you need to stick with the lawyer. If you prefer to shop around for counsel each time you need legal help in the hopes of negotiating down fees, you're going to end up paying more over the long haul.\" If it's writing up contracts that avoid potential future problems or advice to SMEs on corporate decisions, lawyers can prevent costly litigation cases before they arise. But it's ultimately up to each SME to weigh the costs between hiring a lawyer and modify- ing or drafting its own contracts. Top 10 Mistakes Made When Hiring A Lawyer Hiring a lawyer is an exhaustive process. People often complain about the relationship with their lawyer. Most issues can be overcome, however, if you avoid the following mistakes when hiring a lawyer: 1. Not checking a lawyer's area of expertise. Many lawyers do not know the nuances in other areas of the law. If you need a contract lawyer, do not hire a divorce attorney. 2. Not reviewing all fees in advance. There is no reason to complain about steep charges if you neglected to check costs upfront. 3. Choosing a lawyer because she is supportive. Realize the difference between a lawyer who is sympathetic and one who can win a case or handle business affairs. Do not mistake support for expertise. 4. Not discussing availability. Make sure you discuss how much time you require and have a lawyer who is able to make that time commitment. 5. Hiring the first attorney you find. Be sure to get the names of several lawyers, preferably through referrals, and then make a sound choice. 6. Not meeting in person. Emails and phone calls don't fully cut it. The relationship with a lawyer is one of the most important in business life. 7. Not doing homework. Do not hire a lawyer without checking her background. Talking to some- one who has worked with the lawyer is always good. 8. Getting passed around. Make sure a lawyer will handle matters and not pass you off to some- one else. 9. Doing someone a favor. Decline offers or recommendations of credible lawyers from a friend, if the reason is simply to help the friend. 10. Not being prepared. Do not show up unprepared for meetings, especially when time is money.

Or your car could yell for help if it were being stolen? Even better, what if a small to medium- sized enterprise's network could defend itself from intruders or information thieves? According to a CSI/FBI Com- puter Crime and Security survey, information theft is a costly security breach for U.S. organiza- tions, resulting in an average of $204,000 in losses per incident this year to businesses. To combat that, Cisco devel- oped a package it calls the Self- Defending Network. The SDN provides systems-based solutions that let SMEs use their infra- structure in new ways to reduce windows of vulnerability, mini- mize the impact of attacks, and improve overall infrastructure availability and reliability. It also helps create autonomous systems that can quickly react to an out- break with little human interven- tion, making it easier to get the rapid response required to thwart the latest forms of misuse, Cisco says. \"An SDN proactively identifies and counters security attacks such as worm and virus outbreaks, theft of information, denial of ser- vice, and application abuse,\" explains Amy Hughes of Cisco. \"It repels both known and new threats.\" All devices in an SDN collabo- rate to provide end-to-end defense in depth. \"An SDN is built on integrated solutions, such as intel- ligent routers and switches that provide multiple security capabil- ities, and purpose built security appliances,\" she continues. Eventually, an SME will be able to make SDN an integral part of the company's Application Oriented Network; see the \"Linking To AON\" sidebar for more information on AONs. Self-Defending Network Components The SDN consists of three com- ponents: the Trust and Iden- tity System, the Secure Connec- tivity System, and the Threat Defense System. Each component has a separate role. Trust and Identity System. The first line of defense in a net- work infrastructure is to deter- mine who or what is accessing the network, the state of the accessing device, and what its resource priv- ileges and rights are. The Trust and Identity System inhibits theft of information by helping to ensure that only trusted users and trusted devices can connect to an organization's network and that trusted users and resources can retrieve only the information they are allowed to access. Secure Connectivity System. Every SME values privacy. Users expect that their phone and com- puter communications are private and not accessible by unautho- as desktops and servers. It can detect, identify, and block suspi- cious behavior anywhere on the network. These systems work in three ways. The first phase, Integrated Security, incorporates security solutions in network elements such as switches and routers. The second phase, Collaborative Security, involves building links between network security ele- ments and extending the network presence out onto endpoints that connect into a network. The latest phase of SDN introduces ATD (Adaptive Threat Defense) capa- bilities that enhance the ability of a network to respond to threats based on a new set of Anti-X technologies. \"Cisco's SDN solution provides firewalling, intrusion prevention, VPN, identity management, secu- rized individuals. Through VPNs, the Secure Connectivity System thwarts theft of data, video, and VoIP by protecting the integrity and confidentiality of information traveling over public and private networks. Threat Defense System. Be- cause networks must be resistant to both external and internal attacks, the Threat Defense Sys- tem guards against malicious activity targeted at endpoints such Components Of The Cisco Self-Defending Network Each of the three security disciplines has a specific purpose as they work together to identify and prevent data theft. Privacy 1 Protection 1 Control Secure Connectivity System Secure transport of applications across numerous network environments Threat Defense Security System Collaboration of security and network intelligence services to minimize impact of both known and unknown threats Trust & Identity Management System Contextual identity required for entitlement and trust Management, Monitoring, \\m] 1 ZZ ana Analysis rity agent software for PCs and servers, security management and monitoring, as well as a comprehensive range of services to ensure a successful security deployment,\" Hughes says. The Way It Was It used to be that SMEs felt they could build firewalls or other defenses around their cor- porate networks. That works for networks that stay at home. However, it is the networks that moved — on the road, to workers' laptops, and onto CDs that are installed and removed several times a day at different work locations. Under the new scheme, fire- walls will have an essential role in protecting networks against out- siders and a valuable role within the network. Firewalls restrict access between network groups, creating \"islands\" of security within the network. Today, most network adminis- trators fear that their networks are so complex and so far-flung that there is no one way to keep them secure. This leads to the concept of defense in depth, or proactive defense. But given the type of vulnerabilities and attacks that have accompanied our ever- changing networks, Cisco Sys- tems decided SMEs are better off using adaptive solutions. A common theme with all of these systems is that they employ adaptive as well as proactive defenses. Taking this observation August 26, 2005 a step further, Cisco says the defenses to guard a system of this nature tend to be built into every functional block. These adaptive defenses are active at all times, perform unobtrusively, minimize propagation of at- tacks, and respond fast to as-yet unknown attacks. These intrusions can come from hackers or industrial spies trying to penetrate an SME's external network defenses. Other bold data thieves may simply walk into your building and steal informa- tion using their own or another computer. Employees, perhaps motivated by revenge or anticipat- ing a move to a new job with a competitor, also steal data. The CSI/FBI study says that employ- ees are responsible for 70% of unauthorized access to informa- tion systems and more than 95% of intrusions that result in finan- cial losses. Trust No One To prevent such theft, the SDN offers a security paradigm based on explicit trust rather than im- plicit trust. No longer can all employees be considered trusted users on a network. An SME needs to establish and adhere to a formal organizational security policy or set of policies, including challenging the user to validate that he is trusted. The solution is to have securi- ty that reacts automatically to suspicious network behavior. Such a system has to be integrat- ed into all aspects of the net- work, so the network and its managers can proactively recog- nize suspicious activity, identify if the threat is real, and react appropriately and quickly to the theft attempt. With the SDN strategy, SMEs can use their existing investments in routing, switching, wireless, and security platforms to deploy a self- defending network. Linking To AON Security is critical to the AON (Application Oriented Network), which is the foundation for Cisco's network-embedded products and solutions. The idea is to converge intelligent networking with applica- tion infrastructure based on either service-oriented or traditional architectures. While the big selling points of AON are features, event-based messaging, and optimized deliv- ery, small to midsized enterprises are more interested in its real- time visibility and heightened security. For example, the com- pany recently introduced technol- ogy such as the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance to utilize deep packet inspection. This lets administrators make security decisions using application layer information. Because AON pro- vides integration across all layers, managers gain real-time visibility into the network. And they benefit from distributed policy enforce- ment, which is enabled in the network platform. Eventually, AON and SDN will transition to new architectures such as SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), the company says.

With the potential to lower costs, improve productivity, and consolidate management, Cisco's VoIP efforts offer a future that transcends the replacement of traditional PBX systems. The Cisco Vision VoIP isn't just a niche market for Cisco. According to Julie O'Brien, Cisco's senior marketing manager for IP communications, the SME market for VoIP and related technology is a \"critical market for Cisco.\" CEO John Chambers has pledged $2 billion in IP communication efforts across Cisco's partners and sales channels. For Cisco, IP communica- tions transcends VoIP. Instead, Cisco foresees virtualized offices revolving around unified messag- ing and communication. Whether it's email, voicemail, fax, video, or voice, Cisco wants to provide the sys- tems that will enable SMEs to com pete effectively. The Technology Behind The Talk To back up its vision of IP communications, Cisco has developed several systems that are targeted directly at the SME. The heart of this is Cisco's AVVID (Architecture for Voice, Video, and Integrated Data). AVVID is the underlying technology that powers Cisco's IPCC (IP Contact Center) Express Edition. AVVID is a mature system architecture that Cisco has developed to deliver enhanced security, QoS, and redun- dancy for its IP communication systems. AVVID inte- grates with existing legacy TDM-based systems, easing migration paths. IPCC Express Edition Cisco is directly targeting the SME market with the IPCC Express Edition. According to Cisco, the IPCC Express Edition offers three key benefits: increased call The Market Opening One of the reasons O'Brien is bullish on Cisco's prospects with SMEs is the upcoming end of life for many traditional PBX systems. As these systems come up for replacement, Cisco believes that IP-based communication systems offer advantages that will be hard for SMEs to ignore. SMEs face two primary issues that Cisco believes will drive them to IP-based communication systems: lack of resources and competitive pressures. Resources. Whether the SME is migrating from a tradi- tional PBX system or just beginning to deploy voice sys- tems at new facilities, VoIP systems can help minimize redundant systems. Instead of deploying duplicate infra- structure for voice and data, VoIP can help reduce capital expenses and minimize personnel costs. Security efforts can be focused on this converged network, also reducing costs. Competitive pressures. IP-based communication sys- tems can also help SMEs provide a more professional appearance than that offered by many PBX systems. From ACD (automatic call distribution) to CRM integration, Cisco's systems can help an SME appear to be larger than its true size. Efficient call direction and management can also dramatically reduce personnel costs, as well as maxi- mize customer satisfaction. The goal for Cisco is to provide the tools and technolo- gy that give SMEs the ability to provide highly respon- sive services and customized communications at an affordable cost. .01010110. ,,0101010001110 1010101000/ 1101010C 1101001' 010C ,010* 10101 01010 11010: lOlOlA \"101010: \\1010iJ Cisco's 7970 Series phones can display multiple data sources on its crisp LCD display. center productivity, lower implementation costs, and improved customer service. IPCC Express Edition isn't a low-end solution with limit- ed features. It includes important ACD features such as conditional routing, wait-time messages, and call-in-queue notification combined with strong reporting features and IVR (interactive voice response) functionality in a single- server solution. In addition, the Enhanced and Premium versions of IPCC Express Edition add additional features: priority queuing, skills-based call routing, desktop integration for CRM inte- gration, silent monitoring, and coaching. Cisco hopes that the \"out-of-the-box\" functionality of IPCC Express Edition will encourage SMEs that lack the technical staff required for more complex deployments. The ability to integrate IPCC Express Edition with CRM and company database systems can provide call agents with the ability to personalize customer interaction while simul- taneously routing calls to appropriately trained agents. The Future: A Virtual Office Cisco foresees a future where communication isn't tied to locality. Depending on the type of interaction required, a call (or videoconference) could be routed to any location suitably equipped. With its 7920 Wireless IP Phone, Cisco extends IP communications throughout the office. With the 7970 series of LCD-equipped desk phones, companies can customize the data displayed from a variety of sources that may be relevant to the call. Cisco also sees a strong demand for affordable, easy to manage videoconferencing and has targeted its PC-based VT Advantage and VT Camera at this market. The VT Camera is a USB device attached to your PC, and VT Advantage is the software component installed on your desktop. Once integrated with your Cisco phone, you'll be able to conduct video calls and conferences as easily as voice calls.
