The Internet of Medical Things plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of its products in the healthcare field. While Internet of Things takes together many fields, but our emphasis is on IOT’s work impact in the area of healthcare. This paper consists of a cross-review of all those carefully chosen papers with some latest research material and articles combined. This review should help researchers consider previous applications, problems, challenges and threats in the healthcare field. This paper also includes an overview of the IoMT design and how cloud storage technology supports healthcare applications. We assume that this review can be helpful to researchers and professionals in the area, allowing them to appreciate the immense possibility of IoT in the medical world.\n\n1 Introduction Throughout developed countries the health system is evolving rapidly, with a significant increase in the life expectancy in the twentieths century [1]. The health systems of these countries are also getting pressured by the increase in the chronic illnesses S. Kumar · A. K. Arora · P. Gupta · B. S.

Kumar et al.\n\nof the citizens [2]. Indeed, life expectancy in developed countries in the twentieth century has increased by about 30 years. The number of older adults is therefore increasingly increasing [1]. In fact, the proliferation of chronic disorders has placed a lot of strain on healthcare services across the world because of a shortage of resources [2]. In fact, IoMT incorporates both the functionality and protection of conventional medical equipment with modern Internet of Things (IoT) advanced, popular, and portable technology. Besides being perfectly robust to deal with a wide range of diseases requiring myriad inspection requirements, it also has the ability to tackle the problem of diseases that persists for a longer period of time by being able to handle several systems configured for a variety of individuals. Indeed, IoMT also offers a solution to other issues such as systematic real-time monitoring of patients in their everyday lives, as opposed to telemedicine online programs that focus solely on home care [2]. IoMT is not only a connection between a vast number of personal medical instruments but often amongst medical equipment and the ones who supply health experts, or commercial firms. IoMT’s growth is largely attributed to the expanded usage and creation of wired and portable medical tools, taking with them both innovative technologies and numerous challenges [3]. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), sometimes described as Healthcare IoT, refers to medical device collection as well as software linked via networks. Many healthcare professionals use IoMT software to optimize diagnosis, control illnesses, reduce delays, enhance customer service, administer medications and eliminate prices. Market research indicates that the IoT healthcare market would be expected to hit $117 billion until 2020 [1, 4]. In this paper we will review some of the most important points in the field of IoMT. Papers reviewed are themselves review papers in different subsets of IoMT. This paper consists of a crux review of all those carefully selected papers with some new content by some recent papers as well.\n\n2 Applications of IoT in Healthcare The main factors of deaths of women between the ages of 20 and 59 is breast cancer, impacting 2.1 million females per year According to WHO, in the year 2018, it was recorded that 627,000 people died from breast cancer—about 15% of all women’s cancer deaths discussed in [5]. This can be reduced by getting effective care and proper disease treatment. Various artificial intelligence models act as an useful feature in the application of technology to that of the Internet of Medical Issues (IoMT) which can be used to further detect and treat malignant cells in breast cancer. IoT has made life more convenient than ever. With advancement in the IoT sector, care for patients is increasing, healthcare is becoming cheap, outcomes of patients have improved, any type of disease can be detected in real time, one’s life quality has improved and user end experience is improving. One’s main aim to sustain in this world is health and long lives, that too is achieved by this sector. It is also used to efficiently monitor most of the diseases and its prevention. Any sudden drop in the health of patients will show an automatic alert to different healthcare officials,\n\nA Review of Applications, Security and Challenges of Internet …\n\n3\n\nFig. 1 Applications of IoMT\n\nsaving resources of other IoT based devices [6, 7]. Every patient’s medication is immediately imitated to the family members [8]. In the IoT sector, one of the most crucial factors that help IoT to grow is User Experience (UX). It provides simplicity, affordability and easy to use devices with the least amount of instructions needed to explain the working of the device [9]. With this, it also becomes easy for doctors to keep a record of many patients in a single place [10]. Time and energy consumption of doctors reduces [11]. Strong and healthy diets recommended by dieticians or any medical diet based Machine learning/Artificial Intelligence model helps the patient to prevent themselves from further disease, and also it improves the well being. But, medical professionals fail to thoroughly grasp the reasoning of the patient-dietitian for the recommended method [12]. The application areas can be broadly categorized as shown in Fig. 1.\n\n2.1 Smart-Medical Technology This includes smart medical equipment and kits that are currently being deployed. These are currently used by paramedics to provide immediate help to patients who\n\n4\n\nS. Kumar et al.\n\nare in urgent need of medical care and assistance. One example is the use of medical drones to perform such a task [13]. Medical drones were originally introduced to respond to emergencies related to patients suffering from cardiac arrests [14], since these drones are the fastest to arrive at the emergency scene. The drones would be directed to fly to specific destinations, which saves time and as such, saves lives since paramedics might end up stuck in traffic, and may not be able to respond as quickly as needed. This encourages the reliance on smart medical robots [15] to perform surgical operations within a hospital setting. Virtual/Augmented Reality and Artificial-Intelligence (AI)-based medical technologies were also employed for various medical purposes. AI-based medical technologies are also being used that ensure a higher accuracy rate [16]. These models include biochemical interactions [17], such as IBM Watson and Gene Network Sciences (GNS) Healthcare AI systems [18] used to search for the right cancer treatment [19].\n\n2.2 Ingestible Cameras These are cutting-edge and cost-effective capsules that can be swallowed (in-vivo/invitro) by a patient to provide internal-organ real-time visual monitoring for early detection of chronic diseases and cancer [20]. Many ingestible devices were presented including Swallow-able data recorder capsule medical device [21], ingestible endoscopic optical scanning device for endoscopy [22], and ingestible hydrogel device [23]. Ingestible devices rely on an X-ray or camera capsule, a tracking/recording system and the diagnostics toolkit for evaluation.\n\n2.3 Real-Time Patient Monitoring (RTPM) This is a new evolving trend among the new generation, including millennials, due to their heavy reliance on smart devices as a key part of their daily lives [24]. In fact, RTPM is used to ensure a real-time, cost-effective remote consistent monitoring depending on the sensors linked to the patient’s body, either through a homecare telehealth system [25, 26] or telecare monitoring systems [27, 28]. This may include monitoring fitness level, glucose level, respiration rate, and heart rate, etc. Many new RTPM trends are now available including, Apple Watch app that monitors depression, Apple’s Research Kit and Parkinson’s disease and ADAMM intelligence Asthma Monitoring [29, 30].\n\nA Review of Applications, Security and Challenges of Internet …\n\n5\n\n2.4 Cardiovascular Health Monitoring Systems These systems use heart rate and pulse wave velocity of the patient. It can help in early peripheral arterial disease (PAD) recognition by measuring Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) with the help of Body Cardio Scale. For example—(Nokia, Helsinki, Finland) [31].\n\n2.5 Skin Condition Monitoring Systems These systems determine the wounded circumference and healing progress. Authors in [32] proposed to make a forum for mobile telemedicine with the help of smartphone. They tested the platform’s viability as well as usability based on simulating testing by 10 experts, who used the experimental mobile app to remotely inspect a diabetic foot. This platform can remotely classify wounds as well as the amputation risks with an accuracy of 89% on average.\n\n2.6 IoMT Device as a Movement Detector These devices are for the immobile patients. It has become important for these groups of people to trace their movements. And that is why smart watches and sensors are mounted on the patient’s clothes, bed, or body to track their activities. It will also assist in monitoring involuntary gestures and provide deeper insight into effective medical control. Data collected from these devices is protected from end to end, granting patients more protection.\n\n3 IoT Healthcare Security and Privacy Efficient approaches have been demonstrated in home telemedicine system [33] to minimize overloading of healthcare services and to decrease the cost of healthcare. As so many IoT components wirelessly transmit and receive data which puts IoMT at risk of security breaches of the wireless sensor network (WSN) [34]. IoMT solutions also provide software for running, tracking, and managing these. Application risks that include authentication and authorization breaches, along with the general protection and functionality of the program, there is also concern [35]. Because of the vulnerability of all the medical systems, it has become important to handle in a heterogeneous fashion. Many of the MTs which are linked with the internet that ensures reliability. Hence, we require a versatile layered architecture. The five-layer\n\n6\n\nS. Kumar et al.\n\nFig. 2 Layer-wise security issues\n\nIoT model mentioned in [36, 37] presents a layered architecture that provides unique functionality for each layer. Layers are as follows: 1. Perception Layer: Here all the data that includes body temperature, heart rate, etc. which utilizes the physical devices like sensors and transmits the data to the network i.e. network layer. 2. Network Layer: This layer searches and delivers the content and routes the content from the source to the destination with the use of network addressing. 3. Middleware: This layer manages the processing and retrieval of data that is retrieved from the perception layer instruments i.e. sensors, the detection of resources and the management of access to apps. 4. Application Layer: With the help of this layer all the users link to IoMT devices through a middleware layer. 5. Business Layer: It controls the market rationale of healthcare providers and manages the life-cycle of the company operation, including tracking, controlling and improving business processes. These layers and the issues are summarized in Fig. 2\n\n3.1 Perception Layer Issues 1. Side Channel: Attackers can use a variety of side-channel methods, for example, Analysis of pacing and resource usage and help to track the electromagnetic (EM) activity across medical instruments for the extraction of data [38].\n\nA Review of Applications, Security and Challenges of Internet …\n\n7\n\n2. Tag Cloning: Here the attacker uses the data obtained through an effective side channel attack or it duplicates the data through the existing tag [39]. 3. Tampering the devices: As the sensors can be amenable, hence, any attacker can physically interfere with sensors and incompletely or fully interrupt or control the performance. Attackers can connect to these IoMT devices in order to disable the medical system containing a USB port [40]. Also, the attackers may also interfere with computers by making use of certain software bugs to install malicious software, which gives the attacker the ownership over the particular device [41]. 4. Tracking Sensors: Utilizing insecure tools, attackers can be comfortable with patient positions or GPS data spoof [42]. Vulnerabilities in cellular network signaling system No. 7 (SS7) can compromise MT [43].\n\n3.2 Network Layer Issues 1. Eavesdropping: Attackers identify and decrypt the necessary equipment with which they can effectively capture details sent by all the hardware devices. 2. Replay: In this, the attacker replays the authentication message that has previously been shared among legal users. For example, OneTouch Ping insulin pump is considered susceptible as it is in need of safe contact procedure [44]. 3. Man-in-the-Middle: An unauthorized party can get into data using a backdoor and replay and change the communications of legal parties [45]. 4. Rogue access: Here, a fake portal is established within the wireless network which scopes to enable legal access to the system and, in turn, to intercept data [46]. 5. Denial of Service (DoS): Here, the attack disrupts the availability of medical equipment and their services by flooding the network with service requirements. Distributed DoS (DDoS) is a more sensitive variant of DoS that needs several nodes well into the floods, rendering this harder and harder to find. In 2016, largescale DDoS attacks using IoT instruments were successful due to the wide-scale deployment of IoT devices. 6. Sinkhole: In such type of attack, a malicious node draws traffic by providing higher connection efficiency (e.g. ads for fake routes).\n\n3.3 Middleware Layer Issues 1. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Here, the attack is popular in RESTful IoT networks. The CSRF tricks the end user into taking action on a compromised program without the consent of the consumer. According to the HP survey of many IoT ventures, 60% of all cloud-connected IoT systems have cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and client hijacking vulnerabilities [47]. 2. Session Hijacking: It is also growing in RESTful IoT based systems. In this intruder, the session and data access may be taken over\n\n8\n\nS. Kumar et al.\n\n3. Cross-site scripting (XSS): XSS also exploits RESTful IoT programs by adding side scripts to circumvent site page access restrictions.\n\n3.4 Applicatsion Layer Issues 1. SQL injection: The SQL injection intrusion occurs anytime an attacker intends to access a client-linked backend database by inserting a malformed SQL code. 2. Efficient SQL injection attacks may negotiate confidential health details or change vital information [48]. 3. Account hijacking: The intruder can steal the identity by intercepting a packet while the user authenticates it. 4. Ransomware: Ransomware encrypts confidential information and requests a large fee for recovery. The danger begins with a single device, and afterwards spreads to the whole network. Attackers can encrypt personal details, such as patient records, and hold the decryption key in exchange for money. 5. Brute force: This is simply attempting to infer inputs including passwords by checking all potential combos [37].\n\n3.5 Business Layer Issues 1. Disclosure of information: Unauthorized access to private details such as health reports breaches the security of the IoMT program. Approximately 38% of accidents to healthcare were of this kind in 2015 [49]. 2. Deception: Attacks such as man-in-the-centre and sinkhole will contribute to knowledge manipulation. About 58% of health organizations don’t have a system in place to correct such erroneous information [50]. 3. Disruption: Disruption of correct protocol or exposure to vital information decreases the consistency of the system and may lead to life-threatening effects [51]. 4. Usurpation: Unauthorized exposure to other parts of the network by attacks, like replay, malware injection and sinkhole, impacts the health of medical equipment [52]. SYN Flooding Attacks or “half-open” attacks mostly threaten high-capacity IoMT systems as they rely on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) infrastructure to interact (i.e. email/web servers) [53]. The purpose of this attack is to trigger a medical system to crash by draining the memory buffer of the e-Healthcare system and render unsafe links accessible for further attacks. Black Nurse Attacks are highly successful low bandwidth (15–18 Mbit/s) ICMP attacks targeting high load Central Processing Unit (CPU) firewalls via denial of service attacks [52]. Birthday Attacks are often attributed to users depending on faulty hashing algorithms, where two separate passwords that have the same hash. This vulnerability can be abused easily to\n\nA Review of Applications, Security and Challenges of Internet …\n\n9\n\nobtain unauthorized access to any medical system. A suggested combination of hash functions was presented at [54]. However, frameworks with Stable Hash Algorithms (e.g. SHA-3 and SHA-512) remain the best protection against these attacks. There are several other security issues that are discussed in [55] which are given as follows: 5.\n\n6. 7. 8. 9. 10.\n\n11. 12. 13.\n\nAuthentication: IoT authentication is very difficult, since heterogeneous network authentication is involved. Items (sensors) have to be detected and authenticated prior to entering the network. It needs a global unique identification token for each individual in the network. Confidentiality: To be certain that unauthorized users cannot access health data. Confidential communications should be kept private from the eavesdroppers. Self-Sustaining: When a remote patient (RPMN) medical system fails then the other healthcare systems must be able to provide a minimum level of protection. Fault Tolerance: The system should come up with applicable security providers with the functionality in the event of computer failure or breach. Flexibility: The device should be flexible enough to defend the network even if any IoT nodes are compromised. Data Freshness: Recent (fresh) data must be available to Remote Patient Monsitoring networks to operate efficiently with nodes. Of example, the most recent ECG readings are required to evaluate the heart functioning of every patient Consultant. Anonymity: A lot of patients want their identity to remain anonymous inside RPMS. Liability: Remote Patient Monitoring systems should establish liability for any abuse, failure, theft or unusual event. Trust: Users or patients need guarantees to prevent any personal and medical information theft in Remote Patient Monitoring systems.\n\n4 Security Measures IoMT suffers from different issues and challenges such as the lack of security and privacy measures, in addition to the necessary training and awareness. We’re going to review the existing security solutions which are discussed in [56]. The solutions are classified as cryptographic and non-cryptographic. As there is a rise of digital healthcare v4.0 era, exhibiting a trade-off between the security level and the system performance for IoMT act as a major security measure. We’re providing a security solution, which is divided into five different layers to detect and prevent attacks, in addition to reducing the damage of these known attacks and preserving the patients’ privacy. The devices are capable of constantly tracking the patient’s health in realtime, offering them physical flexibility and mobility. This includes monitoring fitness level, glucose level, respiration rate, and heart rate, etc. Hence, there is no need to keep them in hospitals. The main issue is that many IoMT devices are prone and vulnerable to cyber-attacks simply because medical devices are either poorly secured\n\n10\n\nS. Kumar et al. Availabilit Techniques\n\nTechnical Training\n\nHoneypots\n\nAuthorization\n\nTechnical MultiFactor Authentication\n\nRaising Awareness\n\nMultiFactor Ident. & Verification\n\nSecurity Measures\n\nNonTechnical Raising the Education Level\n\nFig. 3 Security Measures\n\nagainst potential adversaries or not secure at all. This is the main challenge that IoMT faces i.e. preserving the patient’s privacy without degrading the security level. No development in this field would hinder the wider deployment of IoMT. Overcoming the rising security issues and challenges is a challenging task. However, mitigating them can be achieved by implementing multiple security measures, some being technical and some non-technical (refer Fig. 3). 1. Non-Technical Security Measures: Theses measures include training of the staff and also securing the medical information of the patients. These measures can be applied according to the need. Training the medical and IT staff could be accomplished in three different ways: a. Raising Awareness: It is mandatory to aware the staff, especially the IT staff as they can know and identify an occurring attack from a normal network. It helps them to find the possibility to assess the likelihood and impact of a risk. Once risk is identified, it is also essential to explain how to mitigate it and use the right security measures to deal with any threat and reduce its risk. For this, we need to spread technical awareness. b. Technical Training: Besides raising awareness, people should know how to mitigate the risks and handle the attacks. It is equally important to start training the medical staff and employees of the IT department, right after the teaching phase. This includes 7 phases: • Identification Phase where the IT is capable of identifying a suspicious behaviour from an abnormal behaviour. • Confirmation Phase that is based on the ability to confirm that an attack is occurring. • Classification Phase that is based on the ability to identify the type of the occurring attack.\n\nA Review of Applications, Security and Challenges of Internet …\n\n11\n\n• Reaction or Responsive Phase is based on the ability of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) to quickly react to a given attack using the right security defensive measures and prevent an attack from escalating. • Containment Phase is based on containing the attack incident and overcoming it. • Investigation Phase is the implementation of forensic evidence where an investigation process takes place to identify the cause of the attack, its impact and damage. • Enhancement Phase is based on learning from the lessons of previous attacks. c. Raising the Education Level: Education is a must in the IT department. This is based on teaching and educating cyber-security and IT staff the necessary techniques to classify each attack and what it targets like confidentiality, integrity and authentication. 2. Technical Security Measures: We discuss here the technical security measures that should be put in place to ensure an end-to-end secure IoMT system. a. Multi-Factor Identification and Verification: To prevent any possible unauthorized access to IoMT systems, it is necessary to ensure a robust identification and verification mechanism. The best solution is to have a biometric system. There is also a need for a database system to store the identities. There are several biometric techniques to achieve this, which is further divided into physical and behavioural techniques. • Physical Biometric Techniques: A biometric that is based on a physical trait of an individual. This includes facial recognition, retina scan, or iris scan. – Facial Recognition: Facial identification is the method of recognizing or confirming a person’s identity through his or her features. It records, analyzes and contrasts trends which are focused on the facial features of the individual. The facial recognition process is an important phase in identifying and finding human faces in photographs and recordings. – Iris Scan: Iris detection or iris scanning is the practice of making a highcontrast image of a person’s iris utilizing visible and near-infrared illumination.Thanks to its capacity to obtain precise and correct measurements, proven to be important for both recognition and verification purposes. – Retina Scan: A check for retinal identification is focused on examination of the area of the blood vessels behind the human eye. This has proved to be a very accurate and reliable test. • Behavioral Biometric Technique: Behavioral biometric technique that can be used for both identification and verification phases is the hand geometry. Techniques of behavioral biometric authentication include keystroke\n\n12\n\nS. Kumar et al.\n\nanalysis, gait identification, speech ID, and features of mouse use, signature identification and cognitive biometrics. Generally, the precision of the biometric modality is determined on the basis of reciprocal errors consisting of both the false acceptance rate (FAR) as well as the false rejection rate (FRR). b. Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques: Authentication is classified as the first line of defense that authenticates the source and destination alike. In fact, authentication can be a single-factor authentication that only relies on a password as the only security measure, which is not preferable. It can also be a two-factor authentication that relies on another security measure aside from the password in order to access a given system. Finally, it can be a multifactor authentication where a third security mechanism is required in order to access a system. Therefore, authentication plays a key role in providing security for the accessible resources on a given network. c. Authorization Techniques: An assigned authorization must be based on offering the least privilege. Hence, the Role Based Access Control i.e. the RBAC model is adopted. The model offers the least privilege for a given medical staff or employee to perform a given task with the least permissions and functionalities to accomplish a specific task. T-Role-Based Access: It is mainly designed for cloud computing environments, especially where medical data is stored [57]. T-RBAC also stands for Temporal Role Based Access Control, and can be spatio-temporal [58], intelligent, and generalized. It is also capable of validating any needed access permission for any medical user according to the assigned role and tasks. d. Availability Techniques: Maintaining of servers is a must for easy flow of data. Maintaining the server’s availability requires the implementation of computational devices that act as backup devices, along with verified backup and Emergency Response Plans (ERP) in case of any sudden system failure. Against Jamming: Jamming is the intentional intrusion, obstruction or interfering with licensed wireless communications. In static networks much jamming identification and countermeasure is planned and tested. The issue of ant jamming is more difficult in a mobile network system where jammers can switch and trigger jammer detection and localization algorithms to malfunction. e. Honeypots: Honeypot systems are really useful when it comes to detecting attackers, their targets, tools and used methods. A honeypot is a networkattached device set up as a decoy for preventing, deflecting, or researching intrusion attempts to obtain unauthorized access to information systems.\n\n5 IoMT Design Two design approaches are defined in order to cope effectively with the challenges of reliability, validity, stability, modeling, testing, robustness and validation of IoMT.\n\nA Review of Applications, Security and Challenges of Internet …\n\n13\n\n5.1 Model-Based Development We addressed contributions dealing with all facets of medical cyber-physical systems (CPS) and, more precisely, physiological models, since robust systems models have increased functionality and health. With the help of networking digital models, physiological modeling can easily be extended to amalgamate various IoMT devices [3]. In order to design a model of hybrid systems, first one should have a basic knowledge on continuous simulation systems modeling. Continuous simulation can be defined as a computer model of a physical system that continuously tracks system response based on a set of equations typically involving differential equations. Then, the modeling can further be used in discrete-time systems using a fault-tolerance approach [59]. This is the foundation for many more developed versions of continuous time, discrete time or mixed structures.\n\n5.2 Service Layer Based IoMT Design There is another unexplored approach based on service layer, where the design of IoMT systems is considered from a service oriented perspective. The quality-ofservice (QoS) specifications, methods and templates are the key focus of the literature utilizing a service-oriented method to the architecture of IoMT. Subtle network controllers are then used to assure the required IoMT QoS on a large scale, combining all patient and clinical facilities [60]. Generally, there is different perspective from which QoS requirements of (Cyber-Physical Systems) CPS are well-developed: 1. Net Qos Criteria for CPS [61] 2. The QoS management architecture of both CPS application as well as the CPS framework [62]. 3. The UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a focused QoS modeling for CPS [63]. Still on the issue of QoS management, QoS-enhancing middleware by considering resource managers and network resources has been created [64]. 4. A system has been developed to ensure sufficient QoS by network resource management [65]. Numerous model-based design approaches have been suggested for the efficient development of service-oriented cyber-physical systems: software research and design languages have been used for designing architectures [66], including the expansion of the OWL-S to enable the advancement of service-based CPS prototypes [67]. Another subject of interest to IoMTbased applications is the implementation of suitable middleware, which provides a degree of complexity to system management by providing a standardized framework for linked artifacts. The service-oriented middleware design has been described utilizing either minimal-level C structures [68] or high-level XML definition for entity incorporation into huge-scale IPv6 networks [69].\n\n14\n\nS. Kumar et al.\n\n6 Role of Cloud in IoT Healthcare Systems The use of cloud technology in healthcare systems to store medical records is discussed in [70], which also reviews that cloud can be counted as a complete sector. With the help of cloud technology, we came to know how a huge database could provide various insights for health data analysis and determine patterns in various types of diseases, which is considered in [71]. Every work considered above provides valuable understanding in the cloud technology field. But there are few articles that discuss all of the prospects of cloud in healthcare systems based on wide body-area networks and the Internet of Things. In this section, we can fill this gap by presenting recent works regarding healthcare systems based on cloud technology. The use of cloud in IoMT can be broadly categorized into three categories as shown in Fig. 4.\n\n6.1 Cloud for Healthcare In recent years, after various researches has provided numerous insight of the benefits of cloud storage technology in healthcare applications, we came to know that the benefits that can be provided by cloud storage technologies are derived from mainly three services in healthcare sector: 14. Software as a Service (SaaS)—provides online software to healthcare providers that will enable them to work with health data or perform other relevant tasks. 15. Platform as a Service (PaaS)—provides tools for virtualization, networking, database management, and more. 16. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)—provides the physical (hardware) infrastructure for storage, servers, and more [72].\n\nHealthcare\n\nSaaS, PaaS, IaaS\n\nBig Data\n\nVolume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Value\n\nData Process.\n\nComputational offloading, Machine learning\n\nFig. 4 Role of Could in IoMT\n\nA Review of Applications, Security and Challenges of Internet …\n\n15\n\n6.2 Big Data Management We can generally characterize the big data by its 5 V’s. Where, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nVolume— amount of data generated. Velocity—speed at which it produces data. Variety—general variation of data types Veracity—confusion about the types of data can be added later Value—valuable information that can be obtained from the huge information collection.\n\nVarious cloud-based technologies for WBAN-based systems are considered in [72, 73]. Such three services discussed above are used in the WBAN systems to build the cloud module. SaaS delivers software applications that allow only authorised persons or organizations to work with health data, while virtualization and database management tools are delivered by SaaS, and the hardware and required infrastructure is delivered by PaaS. The system is mainly used to build and store health records and to allow health practitioners, through virtualization and data management tools, to review the status of their patient as required. The only work that a patient has to do is to set up a profile, set up control over who can gain access to their data, and determines if continuous, on-demand or periodic monitoring is what they want. The benefits of big data management with cloud technology are obvious. It allows nearly unlimited storage space, provides many valuable resources and allows patient and doctor accessibility. This allows patient’s greater power over their own healthcare and at the same time helps physicians to offer greater effective services without even having to physically visit their patient in person. In addition, comprehensive data management systems designed to meet all 5 big data characteristics would allow for data mining, machine learning, and other types of deep analysis. By discovering previously identified patterns or trends in patient development over an illness, this may lead to new medical findings.\n\n6.3 Data Processing and Analytics Out of numerous types of data processing that can be achieved with cloud technology, computational offloading and machine learning are the most important ones. Computational offloading can be of great benefit to the complex sensor nodes like those measuring ECG data, BP (blood pressure), or fall-detection accelerometers. The use of cloud computing in [74] is to process complicated raw data in order to return pertinent results to the patient’s sensing device. It is a great idea, as it permits sophisticated sensors to use the computing power of the cloud, while also allowing the patient to easily see their tests and send them to a doctor if required. Computational data-processing offloading is discussed in [75] to evaluate ECG structure and assess whether the shape is consistent with CHF. This test is too difficult to carry out on a\n\n16\n\nS. Kumar et al.\n\nwearable computer, and is therefore a prime case of cloud technology’s usefulness in data processing. Some work has also been done on comparing machine learning algorithms. Deep neural networks (DNNs) in [76] were contrasted with gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms for prediction of stroke. With 87.3% accuracy, DNNs performed the best while the gradient boosting decision trees and logistic regression algorithms were close in accuracy of 86.8% and 86.6% respectively. The worst is the SVM, with an accuracy of just 83.9%. This is considered in [72] which indicate that DNNs are well suited for predictive tasks but they will need to run on cloud storage systems due to the complexity of the algorithm. Because of these advantages, in IoT healthcare systems computational offloading is important to make sure that even the most complex physiological parameters can be tracked, allowing the patient to have the highest possible quality of healthcare.\n\n7 Sensors and Wearable Hardware Medical devices may be described as an instrument, computer, machine, contraceptive, implement, implant, apparatus, reagent for in vitro use or other related article, including a part or accessory intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or intended to affect the structure or function of the human or other animal body. The IoMT is a group of several devices connected with each other to form a smart network. This may include smart body sensors, linked surgical instruments and scopes, or networked contact between patient and doctor in the medical field. Devices discussed in [72] which are built in the domain of IoMT are: 1. Wearable Devices: In a smart healthcare system, the most basic component is a network of wireless sensors which automatically and continuously measures physiological signal measurements and performs bounded data processing. Any Vital signs in the body such as variation in heart rate, conductance in skin, blood pressure, rate of respiration, blood glucose, saturation of oxygen, and other health-related signals can be detected and comprehended using apt sensors that could be mounted over clothes or straight on the body. These include wearable devices such as smart watches which allow patients to be monitored accurately, continuously, in real-time. Devices include: • • • •\n\nLocation sensors: monitoring patient’s position. Body temperature Measurement Sensors: measures the body temperature. Blood pressure sensors: continuously check patients’blood pressure. Biometric sensors: they are used as a security measure for authorizing access (e.g., thumbprint, hair, hand, etc.). • monitoring sensors: continuously check heart rate with the help of ECG and PPG. • Respiratory sensors: track and measure respiration of patients.\n\nA Review of Applications, Security and Challenges of Internet …\n\n17\n\n• Sensors based on activity: tracks regular physical activities such as exercise, sleep etc. using gyroscope sensors. • Muscle movement motion sensors: check the conditions of the movement of the muscles. • Trackers: logs all fitness activities. • Glucose sensors: logs the levels of glucose. • ECG sensors: checks on the heart’s electric and muscular activity. • Pulse oximeters: measure the pulse rate and oxygen level. • Accelerating sensors: Record the patient’s recovery. • Drug pumps: administer the drug to the patient’s body in a set volume. 2. Implantable Devices: Those instruments work inside the body of the patient. Present instruments shall include: • Swallowable video capsule: recreates the digestive tract from the inside of the person. • Embedded Cardiac: gathers information and transmits information through a radio channel to neighbouring omnipresent networks. • Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (often known as ICD): the ICD is a battery-powered device that is placed beneath the skin to keep track of the heart rhythm. 3. Ambient Devices: These apps detect the ambient environment of the patient to track habits of behaviour, quality of sleep, access to the toilet, etc. and send clinicians warnings when suspicious trends are detected. These devices are supposed to make the rooms smarter and healthier for chronic patients. Ambient sensors will include: • • • •\n\nMotion sensors: the sensing of people’s motions in a place. Room temperature sensors: measure the temperature of the room. Pressure sensors: monitor the quantity of water, ice and air. Door sensors: door sensors i.e. open and close for the Alzheimer’s patients or for the avoidance of infections. • Vibration sensors: Sense body vibrations of patients on sheets. • Daylight Sensors: Measure the ambient light to continuously change the lighting areas in the house. 4. Stationary Devices: This category refers to instruments that are constant with the customer, but not usually. These include: Imaging devices: Generate vivid pictures of the body’s interior for scientific research and operation, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-rays [72].\n\n18\n\nS. Kumar et al.\n\n8 Concerns, Challenges and Risks IoMT-related concerns as stated in [56] can be classified into four key categories, one of them is raised by the IoMT users and is related to the security, privacy, trust and accuracy issues. 1. Security Concerns: Due to the reliance of IoMT devices on the use of open wireless communications, these devices are prone to various wireless/network attacks. In fact, an attacker can eavesdrop and intercept incoming and outgoing data and information due to the lack of security measures that most IoMT devices either suffer from by design, or due to weak security authentication measures that can be easily bypassed by a skilled attacker. Another security issue is the ability to gain unauthorized access, without being detected, due to the inability to detect and prevent such attacks. This would result in gaining an elevated privilege, injecting malicious codes, or infecting devices with malware. Moreover, IoMT devices, when hijacked by terrorists, could be used as a mean for targeted assassination. Moreover, IoMT devices can have a negative effect on the psychological state of patients, since these can potentially scare patients, causing them to suffer from a heart-attack due to being surrounded by machines instead of humans. To mitigate the main IoMT security concerns, protection against passive and active attacks is a must. 2. Privacy Concerns: Passive attacks such as traffic analysis leads to privacy issues since it would be possible to gather and disclose information about patients’ identity, in addition to sensitive and confidential information. This is a massive threat for patients since the attacker is capable of identifying persons medical conditions, which can be harmful for the patient. Most of these real-case attacks led to a breach of patients’ privacy either through the leakage, or through the disclosure of sensitive information. Privacy is more than ensuring the secrecy of sensitive and private medical information. It also entails the need for anonymity, non-linkability, and non-observability. Anonymity: a patient should not be identifiable; passive attacks can see what do, but not what you do. Non-Linkability: Items of Interest (IoI) such as subjects, messages, events, actions not to be disclosed by passive attacks. Non-Observability: It should not be noticeable whether the message was exchanged between sender/receiver. 3. Trust Concerns: Trust of the users can be breached once their personal information is disclosed. Also, it can be a threat to their lives as their personal medical information will be with the hackers. 4. Accuracy Concerns: Mal-functionality of the device is what leads to Accuracy concerns. These concern related incidents resulted in having more than 1400 patients being partially or permanently injured, where reports of malfunction revealed that more than 8061 malfunctions have occurred within thirteen years (2000–2013). These incidents indicate the lack of accuracy and precision in the\n\nA Review of Applications, Security and Challenges of Internet …\n\n19\n\noperations being led by medical robots, along with the false diagnosis of patients, and wrong medical prescriptions. IoMT challenges emerged as soon as the integration of medical devices into IoT systems started. One major challenge is the lack of standardization. In [77], authors discussed in detail the main IoMT challenges. The issue of standardization is essential to having different medical devices operating together, and for vendors to adopt the right security measures to protect them from being hacked. This would lead to higher protection, efficiency, scalability, consistency, and effectiveness [56]. The deployment of IoMT systems into the healthcare domain is associated with a number of risks which are listed as follows: 1. Disclosure of Personal Information can seriously affect patient’s medical conditions, as well as the hospital’s reputation. 2. Data Falsification can result into having the transmitted data from any medical device altered and modified, which would result into a higher drug dosage or wrong medical description that can lead to further medical complications 3. Whistle-blowers are based on unsatisfied or rogue medical employees leaking medical details and information about the hospital or patients by either being bribed, or part of an organized crime activity, risking patients’ privacy and lives. 4. Lack of Training among nurses and doctors can result in risking patients’ lives with permanent disabilities or the loss of life. 5. Accuracy is still a debatable issue and is still responsible for inaccuracies in the medical operations conducted by specialized robots. This can also seriously affect patients’ lives and lead to disabilities or fatalities.\n\n9 Conclusion In this paper, we presented an outline of IoT technologies, problems and usage of cloud computing in healthcare. The most important areas of use have been addressed and a variety of study advantages have been identified for usage. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices have the ability to produce data in large amounts that can then be integrated with AI. Thankfully, current IoT solutions have an interface for collecting information from different devices and can provide a fairly simple way to use IoT data in AI or ML models. We just need to increase the precision and accuracy of the existing models. Given its benefits, IoMT is vulnerable to a range of threats, concerns and problems that are directed specifically at the safety of patients and the security, quality and provision of healthcare services. Hence, it is important to ensure a high degree of reliability, privacy, trust and consistency. A series of research issues have been identified, that are projected to become major trends in research in the coming years. We assume that this review can be helpful to researchers and professionals in the area, allowing them to appreciate the immense possibility of IoT in the medical world.\n\n20\n\nS.

The services of healthcare are more expensive than ever, global population is aging and the counting of chronic diseases are on a growth. What the developers are approaching is a world where general healthcare would become out of reach to most of the humans [1]. While technology can’t prevent the people from ageing or remove chronic disorders at one time, but at least it can make healthcare simpler on a pocket in regards of availability and accessibility. A modern technology, known as the Internet of Things (IoT) has a large applicability in various sectors covering the sector of healthcare. The whole application and services of this technology in the field of healthcare is a hope because it permits medical centers to function more competently and patients to gain superior healthcare. There are numerous related works that covered different aspects of Internet of Health Things (IoHT). IoT technology in the field of healthcare is geared towards enhancing the lives of patients and enables a better way of life by using wearable linked gadgets of IoT [2]. The concept of IoHT gadgets as well as smart gadgets of IoT contains huge ability not only for hospitals, but also, for the self-care of people. Patients that may be frequently monitored by IoT gadgets needs detailed tracing of medical reports and this kind of approach uses sensors to collect precise clinical records to provide recommendations and also, use cloud storage to gather and record the clinical details. Due to this, the conventional idea of medical professionals visiting hospitals to check the patient’s vital symptoms is replaced by a substitute provisioning a continuous automatic way of data. The target of this concept is to introduce the readers with a detailed evaluation of this concept and IoT sensors applied in gadgets of health monitoring [3]. As, it is found that, in the healthcare sector, IoT technology provides a numerous advantage, including being capable to invigilate patients more closely and using information for analytics. When it occurs to IoT for medical gadget combination, the concentration is moved towards the user end like blood pressure cuffs, glucose meters and other gadgets constructed to store details of patient’s crucial symptoms. This allows healthcare professionals to automatically gather data and give recommendations. But, unluckily, medical industries often do not focus on the security threats of linking these gadgets to the Internet [4]. There is a chance that a zero day corrupt in a healthcare gadget can be used to harm or even kill someone without being identified. And it is clear that, IoT gadgets are significant for health applications as they gather crucial medical information of patients, thus, the security of IoHT is prominent for the systems of healthcare because gadgets of IoT are threatened by multiple vulnerabilities of security [5]. The chapter is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes IoT enabled technology in healthcare with a model for future systems, including topologies, applications and Services of IoHT. Section 3 presents the classes such as ambient assisted\n\nIoT Enabled Technology in Secured Healthcare: Applications, Challenges …\n\n27\n\nliving, remote healthcare monitoring, wearable gadgets, solutions for healthcare using smartphones along with different challenges of IoHT. Section 4 explains the security requirements and challenges in IoHT along with various technologies to revolutionize the Services of Healthcare in IoT. Section 5 shows the future research direction in the field of IoHT followed by Conclusion in Sect. 6.\n\n2 IoT Enabled Technology in Healthcare A necessary part of human’s life is “Healthcare”. Undoubtedly, an approach is needed to overcome the strain on systems of healthcare needed to supply high-quality observations of the patients who are in danger. IoT technology has been broadly recognized as an efficient approach to reduce the stress on modern systems of healthcare [6]. It stays a comparatively modern area of research, as well as its efficient usage for healthcare, in a field in its prime stage. IoT technology as well as its propriety for modern systems of healthcare is illustrated under this section of chapter. Also, various pioneering researches towards improving systems of IoHT are explored. With the motive of directing the forthcoming growth of these systems [7], a common as well as standardized protocol for forthcoming end-to-end systems of IoHT constructing on the periodic themes are described. This technology has become an industry-agnostic jargon to delineate how the technology has recently been installed in various fields, including the area of healthcare, as well as developing the manner in which business is helmed. The manner in which stakeholders recently communicate with and will continue to streamline the procedures aggregated in frontline works of healthcare has developed by IoT technology. It is a system of physical gadgets that uses connectivity to allow the transmission and swapping of information. But it is not necessary that these gadgets are the complicated for technological developments. However, they perform streamline mechanisms as well as allow staff of healthcare to finish the actions in a timely way. Organizations that are professional in the field of healthcare or technology tend to heavily invest in IoT technology [8]. In existing time period, most of the technological gadgets come with some type of associativity, from wearables namely, Bluetooth or bio-sensors to X-ray systems with Wi-Fi. Those gadgets which are IoT powered, supply sensitive information that help health practitioners execute their tasks [9]. The IoT in the area of healthcare simplifies the crucial operations or jobs to make better patients’ results, as well as reduces some of the pressure of health professionals. Jobs namely, treatment improvement observation, remote patient invigilating, and also, the housing of vaccines are all abilities of gadgets of medical combined with the IoT [10].\n\n28\n\nS. Goyal et al.\n\n2.1 Introduction to IoHT The existing technology in the area of healthcare and a standard practice of medicine gets improved with the systems of IoT. Practitioners reach is extending within a vantage. The different-different data gathered from huge sets of actual world circumstances develops both the size as well as the precision of the medical data. The accuracy of healthcare supply is also enhanced by consolidating more debasing technologies in the networks of healthcare [11]. The employment of IoT in the field of healthcare such as the corporations, personal healthcare and healthcare payment applications, have been heavily grown across several particular use cases of IoT. While, at the same time, other use cases of IoHT are picking up speed and the linked healthcare actuality is speeding up, even if obstacles stay. Also, some of the applications of IoT in the field of healthcare are shown in Fig. 1. • Care: IoT Technology enables practitioners of healthcare to apply their knowledge as well as training in a superior manner to figure out and resolve complications. It supports them to optimize better information and machineries that in turn empowers more accurate and fast tasks. IoT permits in the specialized enhancement of healthcare practitioners because they practically perform their skills rather than contributing time on administrative actions. • Gadgets: Even existing gadgets are developing in their efficiency, accuracy and also, utility, they still supply fewer advantages and features that an IoT system provides. IoT has the capability to unscrew current technologies and direct the humans towards a better healthcare as well as medical gadget solutions. IoT efforts and stows the spaces between the manner we provide healthcare and the machineries by constructing a system instead of creating just weapons. Then, it finds faults and exposes patterns and traceless components in systems of healthcare and recommends developments.\n\nFig. 1 IoT applications in healthcare\n\nIoT Enabled Technology in Secured Healthcare: Applications, Challenges …\n\n29\n\n• Medical Information Dissemination: The dissemination of precise and recent data to patients’ lefts as one of the most defying considerations of medical care, thus, in the field of healthcare, this is one of the most important innovations in the applications of IoT. Gadgets of IoT not only enhance health in the day-to-day lives of humans, but also, support specialist practices. IoT system take care of health out of conveniences such as hospitals and also, permit intrusive care into the home, office or social space. They support as well as allow individuals cater to their own health and permit suppliers of healthcare to provide superior care to patients. • Research: There is a deficiency of sensitive real-world data in the sources that are used by the existing medical research. Most of the time, it uses remaining, monitored surroundings and step forward for medical investigation. Here, IoT technology uncovers paths to an ocean of crucial information and data through explication, real-time field information and also, testing. The data can be provided by the IoT that is far better to general analytics through making usage of equipment’s that are able for executing efficient research. As an outcome, IoT supports in the field of healthcare by delivering more practical as well as efficient data which generates superior solutions and disclosure of problems that were unknown in the past, that’s why in the area of healthcare, research is one of the most prominent applications of IoT. • Emergency Care: The emergency support facilities have always had the issue of suffering from finite sources and getting disassociated with the root service. In the sector of healthcare, this problem is solved by the enhanced automation as well as analytics of IoT. A case of emergency can be explored from a far distance or rather miles away. The professionals get access to the profiles of patient way before their arrival because of which they can provide necessary care to the patient on time. In this manner, linked losses are decreased, and emergency healthcare is developed. Apart from these applications, most of the verges of IoT in the sector of healthcare revolved around the advancement of care as such with remote invigilating and telemonitoring as major applications in wider scope of telemedicine. A second area where many verges are present is tracing, invigilating and handling of assets, through RFID as well as IoT [12]. This is implemented on the stage of medical gadgets and assets of healthcare, the people stage and, also the non-medical asset stage for example, hospital constructing assets. But these use cases and deployments are just the starting and, at the same period, are away from omnipresent [13]. More developed and unified techniques within the scope of the digital modification of healthcare are beginning to be used with respect to the health information facets where IoT plays a role of rising approach [14], as it does in particular sectors namely, personal healthcare, smart pills, robotics, smart home care and even, RTHS (real-time health systems).\n\n30\n\n2.1.1\n\nS. Goyal et al.\n\nApplications and Services of IoHT\n\nThe healthcare systems based on the technology of IoT can be used in a various number of sectors such as health care for pediatric as well as old aged patients, the inspection of eternal illness, and the supervision of personal fitness and health as well. To understand this concept in detail, the chapter widely groups this section in two facets that are, applications and services where applications are further categorized into two classes: single-condition applications and clustered-condition applications [15]. An application of single-condition implies a particular disease or illness or weakness while on the other side, an application of clustered-condition refers to a number of circumstances or disorders together as a whole. Further, in facilities of IoT, applications of IoT deserve more significance. It can be observed that facilities are used to enhance applications, so that these applications are straightly used by consumers as well as patients. Thus, applications are user-concentrated while, services are developer-concentrated [16]. In this part, several devices, wearable systems, and other healthcare gadgets recently present in the industry are also included. These systems can be considered as IoT innovations that can generate several solutions for healthcare. Figure 2 shows the application of IoHT. This categorization can be simply developed by adding further services with different characteristics and various applications including both single-condition as well as clustered-condition applications. There is no general description of IoT services in the reference of the healthcare sector. But there may be some conditions in which a service cannot be differentiated from a specific approach. This chapter introduces that an IoHT services is by some mediums common in behavior and has the capability of constructing a section for a collection of approaches or applic"
