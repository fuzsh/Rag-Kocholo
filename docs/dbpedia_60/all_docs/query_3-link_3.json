        "text": "Thomas Marsland offered me an opportunity to provide an early review of his new book, link below! My Amazon feedback; I'm including it here, as I was more than pleased with how he took such a joyless topic and breathed life into it. \"I am not one to blow smoke and told him I'd give genuine feedback... Tom takes a topic as dry as the desert & and gives it life as lush as an oasis. Ok, that might be over the top, but you really can't understand how well Tom has woven in enough personality, so you can truly enjoy reading about this incredibly rigid material. He dissects the Risk Management Framework in a way that facilitates easy digestion and retainment of the material. As an Adjunct Professor of Cybersecurity curriculum, I would absolutely adopt this as required text for several of my courses. Seriously, Tom \"break[s] down the framework into easy-to-understand topics...\" He doesn't, \"go into every detail, or provide every possible way you could implement the framework...\" So it gets to the weeds, just not deep in them. I don't know if this will go live with graphics, attachments, or templates (not that it needs them) but there are no images currently in the text (just for those visual learners). But I assure you, Tom nailed it. The right info with just enough detail.\" https://lnkd.in/eJxu_da6\n\n7\n\n1 Comment\n\nWhat tools do you know of that allow building SSVC decision trees at scale? Do any exist? I believe some vendors in the risk based vuln mgmt sector can utilize rules to build some level of decision tree.. But I'm not sure how deep that goes. - Does anyone know tools that help with this? - If you are currently doing SSVC, what technology are you using to accomplish it across hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities with and without CVE's? #VulnerabilityManagement #SSVC #Security #CVSS #CVE\n\n15\n\n17 Comments\n\nNot cyber security but this rule will affect a broad spectrum of businesses (U.S. and non-U.S. entities including LLCs, corporations, and entities formed under state or tribal laws) and require them to begin filing reports on their beneficial owners to FinCEN. Businesses that fall under this new rule are corporations, LLCs, or other similar entities that are created by filing with the secretary of state or other similar agency with 20 or fewer full-time employees and less than $5 million in gross receipts or sales as reflected in the previous year’s federal tax returns. It was enacted in 2020. Any thoughts? Comments?\n\n4\n\nThe introduction of the Healthcare Cybersecurity Act (S. 4697) marks a pivotal step towards bolstering the cybersecurity defenses of healthcare entities. Following the February breach of Change Healthcare, which exposed millions of medical records and disrupted nationwide reimbursements, this bipartisan initiative highlights the urgent need for stronger protections. I see this as a necessary step to ensure not only patient data safety but also to earn back patient loyalty – this will require serious time and effort. For too long companies have been pushing the envelope on integrating tech, without the balancing act of assessing risk. By fostering collaboration between HHS and CISA, and establishing a dedicated liaison, the bill aims to enhance response times and leverage resources effectively. This legislation is poised to safeguard sensitive patient data, ensuring healthcare providers can maintain operational integrity and improve patient outcomes amidst rising cyber threats. #CyberThreats #Healthcare #PatientData #Cybersecurity\n\n14\n\nAt Data Connectors Dallas on Thursday, May 16, 2024, at 1:30 PM, dive deep into the practicalities of risk assessments with me as we explore \"How to Operationalize Your Risk Assessments.\" With new SEC regulations reshaping the landscape, understanding how to effectively implement risk assessment processes within your organization is more critical than ever. This session will offer step-by-step guidance on converting risk assessments from a theoretical exercise into a practical tool that drives business outcomes. We will tackle the complexities of meeting and exceeding the latest SEC disclosure requirements and provide actionable insights into operationalizing your risk assessments. Learn how to tailor your risk assessment strategy to fit the unique needs of your organization, ensuring that every component of your risk management is as robust as it is relevant. By the end of this session, you will be equipped with the knowledge to empower your team with essential insights and tools that not only comply with regulations but also pave the way for informed decision-making and enhanced organizational resilience. #cybersecurity #risk #events\n\n2\n\n1 Comment\n\nJoin me on August 1, 2024, at 11:00am PDT for the launch of our GRC Maturity Model series. This webinar stems from my extensive conversations with CISOs and my realization that the GRC field lacked a clear path to understanding organizational maturity and advocating for necessary changes. Hyperproof’s GRC Maturity Model, which I developed based on over three decades of experience and in-depth research, represents my best effort for enhancing your organization’s governance, risk, and compliance efforts. During this event, we will discuss: * The essential elements of the GRC Maturity Model * Why this model is crucial for your organization * Practical insights into implementing the GRC Maturity Model My approach has always been practical and implementation-focused. Mature GRC programs provide companies with competitive edges like market expansion, better certification processes, and minimized regulatory risks. However, relying solely on hiring the right talent or using ideal tools is not a sustainable strategy. With regulatory landscapes evolving rapidly, especially post-Loper-Bright in the US and continuous changes in the EU, it's vital to have a comprehensive GRC strategy. Join me to learn how adopting a mature GRC model can position your business for success in a complex regulatory environment. #GRC #webinar #event\n\n11\n\n1 Comment\n\nDon’t just remediate, but investigate! Good takeaway here is to not only patch, but to roll IR especially if you had a public facing vulnerability in your environment. \"After gaining access, the team promptly informed the organization's trusted agents of the unpatched device, but the organization took over two weeks to apply the available patch,\" CISA's report reads. \"Additionally, the organization did not perform a thorough investigation of the affected servers, which would have turned up IOCs and should have led to a full incident response.” https://lnkd.in/dM-Z67dD\n\n10\n\n1 Comment\n\nThis is so important. I tell my teams all the time, don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. It doesn’t mean don’t strive for quality. It doesn’t mean do anything mediocre, and it doesn’t mean do everything most of the way there. It means that good is relative, and rarely do we need perfect, but we should strive for excellence. Rarely anything is green/red like most organizations measure. Life just isn’t a set of tasks that are done or not. We’ll never have every program at a 5 in the CMMI. Some never should be. Stop measuring everything with the same stick.\n\n21\n\n1 Comment\n\nBill 194, Strengthening Cyber Security and Building Trust in the Public Sector Act. Not far after the introduction of Financial Process Integrity and Disclosure Act by the then Senators Mike Oxley (a republican), and Paul Sabarnes (a Democrat), SOX became the go-to for audit control, and financial integrity validations. The two most important of this Act were sections 302 and 404. SOX did not only help traded or listed organizations, but also provided jobs to many in form of consulting, and Subject Matter expertise. Canada would later introduced C-SOX (Bill 198) as a \"younger brother\" of SOX. Now a new dawn has arrived in Ontario. Welcome Bill 194! Ontario weighs into the responsible use of AI and protection of information within the custody of public entities and municipalities. Ontario is taking steps to ensure a responsible use of AI in public entities, and the disclosure of attacks, breaches and data leaks by the Heads of Agencies and organizations. Bill 194, Strengthening Cyber Security and Building Trust in the Public Sector Act, 2024 is, perhaps the most recent update to the federal PIPEDA. This is definitely not a bad bill from the accounts of ensuring reaponsibilities by the relevant stakeholders. More to come...\n\nOn June 18, 2024, the SEC charged R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (RRD) for failing to maintain adequate internal accounting controls and disclosure controls. These charges violate Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RRD settled with a $2.125M civil penalty due to inadequate policies that led to a ransomware attack, resulting in data encryption, data exfiltration, and business disruptions. Two SEC Commissioners dissented about the SEC's approach. This action is the second time the SEC has used Section 13(b)(2)(B) to fault a company after a cyberattack. The first action against SolarWinds Corporation is under litigation in the Southern District of New York. The SEC's broad interpretation of its jurisdiction is being challenged. Two Commissioners criticized the SEC’s use of Section 13(b)(2)(B) to enforce cybersecurity policies. They argue that the SEC is overreaching by using unrelated statutes to mandate cybersecurity controls. The criticisms are like those against the FTC's use of Section 5 of the FTC Act to require cybersecurity measures not explicitly covered by the statute. The SEC's actions have significant ramifications for companies dealing with cybersecurity breaches. The broad interpretation suggests that companies' information systems are assets, and unauthorized access could lead to SEC violations. This interpretation may regulate public companies' cybersecurity practices. The dissenters argue that internal accounting controls should not extend to broader administrative controls. The SolarWinds case challenges the SEC's interpretation of its jurisdiction under Section 13(b)(2)(B). The outcome may influence whether the SEC can penalize companies victimized by cybercrime. #cybersecurity #SEC #regulation\n\n12\n\n4 Comments\n\nThis is the kind of effort we need to really tackle vulnerability management with a proper effort around accurate prioritizations. This effort is aimed at bringing “Common Platform Enumeration, Common Vulnerability Scoring System, Common Weakness Enumeration, and Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to CVEs” together, including a pass through an SSVC decision tree. I am beyond excited to see such an effort and yet I remain concerned that without the required support and adoption by our vendors, this will merely represent another data point we cannot easily normalize with our tools. #VulnerabilityManagement #Security #BlueTeam\n\n15\n\n🚀 More Exciting updates coming out of FedRAMP: Your Feedback Matters! 🚀 FedRAMP is taking a significant step forward with the launch of a new initiative to refine its authorization process, focusing on security and customer experience.

Earlier this month, I had a conversation with the CTO of a large organization (100,000+ employees), who shared something that left me scratching my head.... When I proposed the idea of security / risk teams being involved early on to provide input into business decisions, the CTO quickly responded with \"We make decisions based on prioritizing business outcomes, n͟o͟t͟ what the security / risk teams want us to do\". While I agree that business outcomes ought to be maximized on the surface, the CTO's framing insinuated that security and risk were mutually exclusive from business outcomes—this is the part that made me uneasy. As I was thinking about how to reconcile these thoughts, I recently learned of the 𝘪𝘯𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘪𝘲𝘶𝘦, a counterintuitive problem-solving approach practiced by many successful leaders, most notably Charlie Munger. Instead of just focusing on how to achieve success (positive business outcomes), the inversion technique involves considering how to avoid failures (negative business outcomes). Some key 𝘣𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘧𝘪𝘵𝘴 of the inversion technique: - overcome cognitive biases - minimize surprises / disruptions (risk!) - improve decision-making - increase resilience Notice how using the inversion technique likely will drive the implementation of security controls, but the framing is one of business outcomes (not security... or compliance). So, here's an 𝘦𝘲𝘶𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 that may help:\n\n56\n\n4 Comments\n\nLaunch day. It took months to get to this point, but the nist csf 2.0 template has finally released. ‍ This launch demonstrated why iterative building in public is so cool.
