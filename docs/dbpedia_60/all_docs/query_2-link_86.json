        "text": "Zoe (she/her) received her B.S. from New York University in Neural Science in 2003 and subsequently did her Ph.D. in the lab of Danny Winder at Vanderbilt University (2009) studying noradrenergic modulation of glutamatergic signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Zoe then completed a post-doc with Mark Wightman at UNC learning in vivo and ex vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and spent a year in the Stuber lab at UNC learning optogenetic and behavioral techniques. The McElligott Lab officially launched in the fall of 2015 at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies and the Department of Psychiatry.\n\nAway from the lab Zoe likes spending time with her family (husband, Tom, children Georgia and Raphael) and all the animals on her crazy farm! She enjoys spinning yarn, knitting, cooking, dancing, and traveling to new places and obtaining new cultural experiences. Fun fact: Zoe loves singing karaoke!\n\nEmail: Zoemce@email.unc.edu\n\nTwitter: @nanopharmNC\n\nTony (he/him) joined the McElligott lab as a post-doc in February 2021. He received his B.S. in Biology from Warren Wilson College in 2012. After graduating, he worked as a research technician at East Tennessee State University for two years in the lab of Dr. Donald Hoover. He received his Ph.D. in Pharmacology from Emory University in the lab of Dr. Ellen Hess in 2021. His dissertation work investigated the mechanism of action of muscarinic receptor antagonists in mouse models of inherited dystonias. Tony is currently studying how central noradrenergic signaling modulates opioid abuse and withdrawal. Tony is originally from Louisville, KY. Outside of lab he enjoys hiking with his dogs, baking, and watching soccer.\n\nEmail: Anthony_downs@med.unc.edu\n\nTwitter: @TDowns404\n\nAlly (she/her) joined the McElligott Lab as a post-doc in September 2021. She received her B.S. from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2011 where she majored in Biology. After graduating, she worked as a research technician and lab manager for Dr. Bob Datta at Harvard Medical School, where she studied neural circuits that underlie olfactory processing, which are particularly important for social behavior in mice. She received her Ph.D. in Biology from the School of Biological Sciences at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Under the guidance of her graduate mentor Dr. Stephen Shea, she studied a neural circuit that supports the integration of multisensory social cues used to direct maternal behavior in mice. Ally is interested in motivated behavior and is focused on understanding how noradrenergic signaling influences neuroplastic changes in reward circuitry during opioid withdrawal. In her free time, Ally enjoys exploring the outdoors by hiking and running with her dog, Brady, going on culinary adventures, and cozying up with her cat, Sean (if he will allow it). She is also an advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM and volunteers her time to educational outreach activities.\n\nEmail: Anowlan@email.unc.edu\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anowlan/ Twitter: @anowlan\n\nSarah (she/her) received her Bachelor’s degree in Biology from UNC Chapel Hill in 2015. Following graduation, she worked as a research technician in the laboratories of Dr. Robert Tarran and Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg at UNC and Duke University, respectively. She worked on several projects, including developing a high-throughput screening assay to measure e-liquid toxicity and processing umbilical cord blood/tissue to extract and culture mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for clinical trials. In 2017, Sarah began her Ph.D. in Dr. Brian McCool’s laboratory at Wake Forest University. Her dissertation work incorporated optogenetics and whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology to understand how chronic intermittent ethanol exposure dysregulates cholinergic neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala. Sarah recently joined the McElligott lab as a postdoc in August 2022. She is excited to expand her electrophysiology knowledge and gain behavioral experience to dissect how the dysregulation of neuromodulators promotes the progression of alcohol use disorders. In her spare time, Sarah enjoys hiking, gardening, and playing with her dogs, Rudy and Stella.\n\nEmail: Sizer@email.unc.edu\n\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-sizer Twitter: @sarah_sizer\n\nMadigan (she/her) graduated from Vanderbilt University with a BA in Neuroscience and Psychology in 2018. She worked at the University of Pennsylvania for one year before moving to NC to begin her graduate studies in the Fall of 2019. Madigan's thesis work investigates the changes to inhibitory signaling in the BNST caused by opioid exposure and withdrawal. Madigan is from Woodstock, GA and comes from a large family with four siblings. Outside of lab, she loves to hike with her dog and husband, explore local distilleries, and go skiing in the winter.

He worked on feeding behaviors, pain, and endogenous opioid systems as a technician in the Al-Hasani and McCall labs at Washington University in St. Louis before joining the McElligott lab as a PhD student in the Pharmacology curriculum in the spring of 2021. Gray is interested in neural biology underlying consumption of different foods and substances of abuse. He plans to use pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to study the neural basis of consummatory behaviors during his time in the McElligott lab. Gray is from St. Louis, Missouri and enjoys disc golf, weight lifting, video games, biking, and watching sports.\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gray-gereau-635079234/\n\nSara (she/her) graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2020 with BAs in Psychology and Neuroscience. While at Vanderbilt, she worked in the Winder Lab, where she focused on endocannabinoid signaling in the insula-to-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) circuit in the context of alcohol and stress. She moved to UNC for graduate school and joined the McElligott Lab in April 2021. Her thesis work focuses on exploring the effects of alcohol on tonic and synaptic excitatory transmission in the BNST. In her free time, Sara enjoys skulking around town, game nights with her friends (or lab), and spending time with her partner and their menagerie.\n\nEmail: conleysy@email.unc.edu\n\nMitchell (He/Him) received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in Cognitive Science. After graduation, he worked in the research lab of Dr. Herr at the EPA’s Neurotoxicology Division on chemical testing, and with the Duke Behavioral Core on drug discovery. At UNC, Mitchell jointly joined the McElligott and Shih lab to work on the functional and behavioral effects of synthetic opiates in animal models. In his off time, Mitchell enjoys playing games, running, hunting ghosts, and cooking.\n\nEmail: mlhuff@unc.edu\n\nAlex Brown (he/him) joined the McElligott Lab as a graduate student in April 2024. Alex graduated from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine in 2017 where he majored in Neuroscience. Before attending UNC, Alex worked as a technician and lab manager at many different labs, starting under Dr. Kyle Smith at Dartmouth College, where he studied the role of the nucleus accumbens on sign tracking behavior in rats. Subsequently, he moved to MIT to work under Dr. Kay Tye studying the neural basis of compulsive alcohol drinking in mice. Most recently, he worked at Vanderbilt University as the Lab Manager of Dr. Cody Siciliano's lab from its inception in 2019 until leaving to attend UNC in 2023. There, he studied developed a model for tracking mice’s progression through a drinking task that resulted in different drinking phenotypes to explore how compulsive drinking arises. Alex is interested in the individual differences underlying compulsive alcohol drinking and how the progression from casual to compulsive drinking can be altered. Outside of the lab, Alex has two cats (Lewiston and Moxie) who he loves dearly and also enjoys spending weekends exploring new restaurants, breweries, and stores with his partner. Additionally, he's a huge geek and enjoys board/card games, video games, and socializing with friends.\n\nEmail: alexbrwn@unc.edu\n\nTwitter: alexbrwn1\n\nShannon (she/her) joined the McElligott Lab as a graduate student in April 2024.
