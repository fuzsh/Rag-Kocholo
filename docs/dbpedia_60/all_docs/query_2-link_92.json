He told me he was originally from Midland, Mich., but he graduated from Calvin College. This was the first time we started freaking out. The nearby passengers heard our commotion over the strange coincidence. If that wasn’t strange enough, we found out we had many mutual friends and were even at some of the same events throughout the past four to five years. The craziest part is that we were both RAs—on the same floor (2nd VanDellen)—just four years apart!\n\n“The rest of the flight was spent telling hilarious RA stories. We stopped every so often and relished in the fact that these coincidences are beautiful, and we’ll remember it forever.”"
