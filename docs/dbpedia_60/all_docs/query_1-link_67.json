        "text": "Happy National Lighthouse Day! Did you know that the Cape Canaveral Lighthouse is one of the most unique and interesting lighthouses in United States military history? It was built a few years after the American Civil War in 1868. In the 1890s, it was disassembled, moved, and reconstructed about a mile inland from the shoreline. Despite dimming the light during World War II, German U-boats still successfully sunk six Allied ships off the Cape Canaveral shores. Aircraft from Naval Air Station (NAS) Banana River conducting bombing practice runs near the lighthouse during World War II. Following the war, Cape Canaveral became the Joint Long Range Proving Grounds. Beginning in 1950, the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force tested missiles here along the Eastern Range. The Cape Canaveral Lighthouse was part of the backdrop to thousands of space and missile launches over the last 74 years! Today, the Cape Canaveral Lighthouse is one of only a few lighthouses officially owned by the U.S. Space Force. It sits on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station - the World's Premier Gateway to Space! It remains a guiding light to our travelers of the sea and space. This is where history is launched! Here's more info on the Cape Canaveral Lighthouse - https://lnkd.in/gzViBNm9.

What does this holiday have to do with the World's Premier Gateway to Space? Keep reading to find out. It will surprise you! Beginning in 1956, four Atlas ICBM launch complexes (LC-11, 12, 13, 14) were built along (what became) ICBM Road. Construction included the installation of a Pad Warning Light at each launch pad. These were traffic lights! More specifically, Crouse-Hinds Type TSP-443 Dt. Fourway Signals. They operated in a similar manner as a traffic light - green meant safe, yellow denoted caution, and red signified danger. These represent one of countless historical examples of existing technology repurposed for launch activity on the Cape! These images from our reference collection show these traffic lights in use during historic Atlas launches. We even found them in original engineering drawings! The original Pad Warning Light from LC-13 was donated to our museum earlier this year. What a fantastic tangible connection to our early Atlas launches! More on these historic launch complexes here - https://lnkd.in/edvJRPnn #museum #museums #history #space #rockets #launch #missiles #warninglight #trafficlight #InternationalTrafficLightDay #TrafficLightDay #capecanaveral #spacecoast #artifacts #archives #LoveFL #FollowRupert\n\nLast week we hosted two talented artists for several days at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Museum. They were tasked by the Secretary of the Air Force Art Program, headquartered in the Pentagon, to create art around the upcoming Crew 9 mission! This milestone mission will include the first U.S. Space Force Guardian, Col Nick Hague, to be launched into space! Our team really enjoyed spending time with these exceptional artists and were very impressed to see them in their element. We are eager to see what they create! Documenting the experiences of warfighters through art is a tradition that dates back well before the creation of the United States. It was a way to record information for posterity in the days before cameras and other technology. The Department of the Air Force Art Program began in 1950 - coincidentally, the same year launches commenced at Cape Canaveral. Since then, artists have documented Air Force personnel, equipment, locations, and activities. Today, they have expanded to capture the essence, culture, life, and milestones of the U.S. Space Force! We are honored to play a role in this long tradition. Semper Supra!

Besides the triple-digit feels-like atmosphere, we had a blast! Check out that X-37B mock-up! Wow! We added some SCAPE suit photo ops to the mix. Rupert loved it! Our Cape Canaveral Lighthouse team offered tours to all attendees. Many top performing Airmen and Guardians, along with DoD civilians, received awards for their amazing work. Welcome to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the World's Premier Gateway to Space. This is where history is launched!
