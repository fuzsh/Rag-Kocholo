        "text": "Lylamae Johnita VandenBerg was born June 12, 1933 on the family farm in Lyon County, Iowa to John and Frieda (Bruns) Meinerts. She was one of nine siblings and knew the value of hard work from an early age, helping her Dad with farm chores and daily milking of the cows. In 1941, she moved with her family to a farm south of Luverne, Minnesota. She attended country school through the eighth grade. She then attended Luverne High School where she graduated in 1950. Lylamae married James VandenBerg in 1955 and made their home in Windom, Minnesota, where Jim worked at Schweitzer’s for 20 years. The couple built their first home in town. They worked on that house for many months together building it from the ground up. Ten years later, Lylamae decided she needed the country and the young family bought a farm outside of Windom. She planted vegetable gardens, milked cows and gathered eggs from the chickens. Five years passed and Jim was offered a job as master electrician at Campbell Soup Co. They purchased a farm near Worthington, Minnesota. Lylamae’s most valued job was being a stay at home Mother so she could raise their children and be home when they were home. She also worked as custodian at the American Reformed Church in Worthington. Lylamae later decided to purchase a property in town to fix up and rent. She worked on it laying carpet, plaster and sheetrock, painting, plumbing and anything that needed to be done. She was determined to figure things out on her own. When she finished that house, she continued the process and took on more properties. Jim preceded her in death in 2002 and Lylamae then decided to move back to Luverne. On Thursday, May 11, 2017, Lylamae passed away at the Dougherty Hospice House in Sioux Falls, South Dakota at the age of 83 years, 10 months and 29 days.\n\nLylamae was a member of the First Baptist Church in Luverne. She taught herself piano at a young age and enjoyed playing for church and others throughout the years. From a young age, Lylamae was a go-getter. She loved working with her hands and seeing hard work turn into something beautiful. She was an amazing cook and loved to serve her family and others. She also loved the color of the dirt after hoeing it by hand, the best sweetcorn ears to sell on the side of the road, the finished project at a house, the playing of a difficult hymn, and the fresh vegetables and fruits canned and ready for a long winter. She was a very talented seamstress and did upholstery work and ceramics. Through the years she crocheted many baby blankets, caps and prayer shawls which she donated. Lylamae cherished being a Mom and loved spending time with her family and friends. Above all else, Lylamae loved the Lord and serving others.\n\nLylamae is remembered by her children, Merle VandenBerg of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Darwin VandenBerg of Sioux Falls, Steven (Laura) VandenBerg of Sioux Falls, and Shirlene (Daryl) Kruse of Worthington; two grandchildren, Justin and Dalton Kruse of Worthington; siblings, John (Linda) Meinerts of Owatonna, Minnesota, George (Sharon) Meinerts of Luverne, Louise Wylie of Chandler, Arizona, Carl Meinerts of Springtown, Texas, and Allan (Evonne) Meinerts of Luverne; sister-in-law, Martha Meinerts of Lakeville, Minnesota; and many nieces, nephews and relatives. She was preceded in death by her parents; and her siblings, Lowell Meinerts, Enola Kortlever, and Claryce Phillips."
