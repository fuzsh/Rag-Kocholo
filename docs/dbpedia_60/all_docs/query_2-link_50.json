From 2015 to 2020, Greitens was an assistant professor of political science at the University of Missouri and co-director of the University's Institute for Korean Studies. Her work on China and North Korea has appeared in academic journals and edited volumes in English, Chinese and Korean, as well as in major media outlets.

Between 2005 and 2009, Slick served as a special assistant to the president and the senior director for intelligence programs and reform on the staff of the National Security Council, and previously was previously director for intelligence programs at the NSC. While serving at the White House, Slick participated in efforts to restructure and reform the intelligence community informed by recommendations of the commissions charged with investigating the 9/11 attacks and the flawed pre-war analysis of Iraq's unconventional weapons programs. These efforts included a series of executive orders on U.S. intelligence issued in August 2004, key provisions in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the administration's responses to recommendations by the \"WMD Commission,\" as well as significant amendments to Executive Order 12333 that were approved by President George W. Bush in 2008. Jeremi Suri holds the Mack Brown Distinguished Chair for Leadership in Global Affairs at The University of Texas at Austin.

Zoltan Feher is an America in the World Consortium Predoctoral Fellow at the Clements Center for National Security at The University of Texas at Austin; a Hans J. Morgenthau Fellow with the Notre Dame International Security Center at the University of Notre Dame; and a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in International Relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.

He holds a Master of Arts in political science and a Master of Arts in American history from Eötvös Loránd University (Budapest), a law degree (J.D.) from Pázmány Catholic University (Budapest), and a Master in Public Administration from Harvard University. His dissertation, The Sources of American Conduct: U.S. Strategy, China's Rise, and International Order, examines U.S. strategy vis-à-vis China in the early post-Cold War period, focusing on how and why the United States ended up facilitating China's rise. His theory has implications for understanding why established great powers often help the emergence of rising states that may over time become peer competitors.

She earned her Ph.D. from Stanford University in Russian and East European history, and  has spent considerable time living and conducting research in Eastern Europe.
