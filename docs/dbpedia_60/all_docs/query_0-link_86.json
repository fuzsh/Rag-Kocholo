        "text": "With the advent of personal computers, mathematicians and PC team up with each other in the scientific sphere, wherein one sheds light on the significance of the other. However, hitherto PC rarely appears in publications to meet with a fair share of identification, and even its unique contribution has only been flirted with. For this underrepresented minority case in academia, Shalosh B. Ekhad is duly credited with his remarks \"the computer helps so much and so often\" in sociocultural paradigms. With the pull of academic accession, this article examines the perduring dark story of the Zeilberger-Ekhad theorem with extensive visualizations. This scientometrical case study is expected to provide a unique opportunity to re-scrutinize the whole story, discourage bias in later accounts that may appear, and uncover some unfolded motivations in human-machine cooperation scenarios.\n\nRecent studies have shown that macroscopic patterns of continuity and change over the course of centuries can be detected through the analysis of time series extracted from massive textual corpora. Similar data-driven approaches have already revolutionised the natural sciences, and are widely believed to hold similar potential for the humanities and social sciences, driven by the mass-digitisation projects that are currently under way, and coupled with the ever-increasing number of documents which are \"born digital\". As such, new interactive tools are required to discover and extract macroscopic patterns from these vast quantities of textual data. Here we present History Playground, an interactive web-based tool for discovering trends in massive textual corpora. The tool makes use of scalable algorithms to first extract trends from textual corpora, before making them available for real-time search and discovery, presenting users with an interface to explore the data. Included in the tool are algorithms for standardization, regression, change-point detection in the relative frequencies of ngrams, multi-term indices and comparison of trends across different corpora."
