He has now been appointed director of the Bureau's European‑Mid East Division and is in charge of maintenance and construction at Navy installations throughout the European and Mediterranean areas.\n\nThe Boothes have a son, Thomas, 13, in high school in London, and a daughter, Lorraine, who graduated from Western Washington College in Bellingham last June. She now plans to get an MS from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. Allen, their oldest son, is married and has a son, 2. Allen is a lieutenant in the Civil Engineer Corps, U.S.N., and is assistant resident officer‑in-charge of construction for a NASA project at Seal Beach, Calif.\n\nGEORGE LANGSNER, assistant state highway engineer in administration for the State of California in Sacramento, has been promoted to deputy state highway engineer. He has been with the Division of Highways since 1931.\n\n1933\n\nJOHN R. PIERCE, MS '34, PhD '36, executive director of research in the communications principles and communications systems divisions of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, is co‑recipient of the Arnold Air Society's General Hoyt S. Vandenberg Award for 1963. This is the first time the award has been given. Pierce was cited for his \"contributions to space age research and development in the field of communications\" Ð including Telstar.\n\n1934\n\nWILLIAM BOLLAY, MS, PhD '36, construction engineer and founder of the Aerophysics Development Corporation in Santa Barbara, is back in Santa Barbara after a year as visiting professor of astronautics at MIT. Under his guidance, 60 graduate students carried out the preliminary design of a new equatorial weather satellite system. Because of the novel features of the system, the U.S. Weather Bureau requested Bill and five of his students to make a special presentation of the idea to the chief of the Weather Bureau and the weather satellite leaders of NASA, in July.\n\n1941\n\nROBERT E. RUNDLE, PhD, professor of chemistry at Iowa State University, died on October 9 at Iowa Methodist Hospital in Des Moines, after suffering a stroke.\n\nHe had been at Iowa State since 1941 and was a senior chemist in the Atomic Energy Commission's Ames Laboratory. He was known for his work on the structure of starches, uranium, and other heavy elements.\n\nCAPTAIN DONALD C. CAMPBELL, USN, is the new commanding officer and director of the US Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory in San Francisco. He has been in the Navy since 1941, and was director of the Laboratory Management Division of the Bureau of Ships prior to the new appointment. The Campbells have four children: Laure, 17; Bruce, 14; John, 6 1/2; and Wayne, 4.\n\nEBERHARDT RECHTIN, PhD '50, assistant director of the Deep Space Instrumentation facility at JPL, was co‑recipient of a $5,000 NASA award last summer for his work in space communications systems. Walter K. Victor, chief of the JPL Telecommunications Division, shared the award with Rechtin for a series of electronic devices which has revolutionized the field of deep space communications. Starting in 1953, when JPL was working on the Corporal and Sergeant missiles for the U.S. Army, the two men developed a radio guidance system that was immune to enemy interference.\n\n1947\n\nCOL. CHARLES M. DUKE, MS, chief of supply and logistics for the Army's First Corps Group in Korea, has been named District Engineer Commissioner in Washington, D.C., by President Kennedy. The Dukes have one son, Charles, 18, who attends the Valley Forge Military Academy, and a daughter, Allyson, 13, in high school.\n\n1948\n\nGEORGE L. HUMPHREY, MS, is now, acting chairman of the department of chemistry at West Virginia University in, Morgantown. The Humphreys have three children: Denton, 13; Lynn, 9; and Alita, 7.\n\nKEITH W. HENDERSON, member of the research laboratory of Lockheed Missiles and Space Company in Palo Alto, is now chapter president of the Peninsula Chapter of the California Society of Professional Engineers. He has served for the past four years successively as secretary, second vice, president, and for two terms, first vice president.\n\n1951\n\nFREDERICK T. RALL, JR., MS, is at MIT for a year, studying management on an Alfred P, Sloan Fellowship. He is chief of the aerodynamics branch of the B‑70 engineering office of the Aeronautical Systems Division of the Air Force Systems Command at Wright‑Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.\n\nARTHUR B. LEAK, MS, research project supervisor of the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University, died on May 24 at the National Institutes of Health Cancer Clinic. He was 34.\n\nLeak had been an aeronautical engineer and staff member of the laboratory at Silver Spring since 1957 and was credited with several significant contributions to the dynamics analysis and missile systems development effort for the Navy. His early research at the laboratory helped unravel some of the problems of missile launching aerodynamics. His theoretical research and analysis pointed the way to more effective use of warheads destined for a submarine air defense.\n\nLeak was working toward his PhD at the University of Maryland when he became ill. He is survived by his wife.\n\nGEORGE C. DACEY, PhD, has been named executive director of the telephone and power division of Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J. He has been on leave from the Laboratories since 1961 to serve as vice president of research at the Sandia Corporation. The Daceys have three children Ð Donna, John, and Sarah.\n\n1952\n\nMARTIN GOLDSMITH, MS, PhD '55, currently on loan to the Air Force's Project Forecast, has been appointed staff engineer in the engineering division of Aerospace Corporation's El Segundo technical operations. He has been with the corporation since 1961. Before joining Aerospace, he spent six years as a specialist in propulsion applications in the RAND Corporation's aeroastronautics department. Prior to this, he was associated with JPL. The Goldsmiths and their son live in Malibu.\n\n1954\n\nHOWARD L. CROSWHITE is now section supervisor for the engineering and research staff of the Ford Motor Company's transmission and chassis division in Dearborn, Mich. He has been with the company since 1954.
