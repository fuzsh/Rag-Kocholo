        "text": "Seventy years ago this week, as the Truman administration was defining its approach to the Cold War, Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg coined a phrase and proclaimed a principle: âpolitics stops at the waterâs edge.â Vandenberg acknowledged that Americans had âearnest, honest, even vehementâ differences on foreign policy. But, he wrote, âso long as we can keep partisan politics out of foreign affairs, it is entirely obvious that we shall speak with infinitely greater authority abroad.â\n\nFollowing the most divisive presidential campaign in our countryâs modern history, calls for bipartisanship may seem old-fashioned and naïve. But a bipartisan approach to foreign policy is achievable and remains essential for our security at home and stability around the globe.\n\nThe world does not pose its challenges in neat four- or eight-year increments; they span the course of administrations and election cycles. Thus, to be effective, Americaâs foreign policy should be consistentâsometimes over the course of decadesâregardless of which party occupies the White House. Our global adversaries have long-term strategies, and America must be able to make long-term commitments to protect our interests.\n\nWe know from our own careers that achieving consensus is hard. The parties have important differences that cannot be papered over. But even in recent memory, Democrats and Republicans have joined to enable our most important national security and foreign policy achievementsâcontaining Communism, expanding NATO, decimating al Qaeda, promoting democracy, fighting HIV/AIDs and the Ebola virus, achieving arms control agreements, and combatting narco-terrorists in Colombia.\n\nNot every bipartisan policy has been successful, yet virtually every successful foreign policy initiative has been bipartisan. Where our policies have not succeededâin stabilizing Iraq, preventing a nuclear-armed North Korea, or in stopping atrocities in Syriaâthey have lacked a sustained approach carried across administrations or supported by both parties.\n\nTodayâs polarized debatesâwhether over Russian hacking or trade with Chinaâmay suggest to some that realistic ground for bipartisan foreign policies has slipped away. But our own recent work suggests that a starting point from which to build renewed bipartisanship is actually one of the worldâs thorniest crises: the chaos across the Middle East.\n\nWe recently spent 18 months working with Republican and Democratic former officials, and regional stakeholders, on a strategy for the long task of building a more stable Middle East, from Syria and Iraq to Yemen, Libya and elsewhere. Across the Middle East, the challenges of civil war, violent extremism and humanitarian crises are rooted in states where governments and institutions are unresponsive to their peopleâs needs, thus breeding corruption, poverty, public discontent and the breakdown of security.\n\nThese âfragileâ states are a global challenge. Theyâre prone to violent conflictsâwhether from sectarian warfare, extremist groups, or regional rivalsâwith tragic results, including the rise of ISIS and the humanitarian crisis in Syria. They arenât limited to the Middle Eastâs bordersâyou can count South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Haiti among them. And globally, fragile statesâ civil wars have spewed terrorist attacks, threatened political cohesion and uprooted the bulk of the worldâs 65 million displaced persons.\n\nExperience shows that problems abroad, if left unattended, all too often come home to America. The United States cannot fix every fragile state; it must pragmatically choose those spots where the threat is the greatest and the possibility of reducing that danger is the most realistic. In those states, a policy of helping local people strengthen their institutionsâmaking them more resilient and able to manage future shocks peacefullyâis far cheaper than dealing with the wars and refugee flows that will erupt otherwise.\n\nA bipartisan foreign policy for the Middle East would recognize that American leadership is still critical to mobilizing the international help required for these states. It would use every tool in the toolbox: security, diplomatic and development assistance, support for democratic institutions, plus private-sector investment. It would push for a more efficient, effective global relief effort for the worldâs record refugee population, focusing on offering these populations opportunities for self-sufficient futures. It would acknowledge that any major U.S. ground force deployment should be avoided unless it is a national security imperative. And it would require a long, patient investment with a partner country, ready for the years of persistent support required to build strong and inclusive institutions.\n\nAfter prolonged wars in and around the Middle East, Americans understandably have grown wary of major military deployments and nation-building. A bipartisan approach to the Middle East would begin by insisting that the bulk of the vision, effort, and resources must come from the people of the region. Only when a country is making the tough decisions that will build its own stability can U.S. support become a good national security investment for Americans.\n\nIn 1947, Americans were similarly exhausted by World War II and eager to rebuild at homeâa yearning that Sen. Vandenberg, a lifelong skeptic on foreign affairs, understood fully. But through the fog of the early Cold War, Vandenberg and his contemporaries saw clearly that only bipartisan dialogue and unity on our policies abroad would guide our nation safely through. Seventy years later, neither our domestic divisions, nor our challenges from abroad, are worse than those we have overcome before. It is vital that we give a bipartisan approach a try."
