        "text": "Dr. Jonathan Visick has been on the Biology faculty at North Central College since 2000. He teaches introductory biology, non-majors' biology, genetics and bioinformatics. His research lab studies the functions of PCM, a protein-repair enzyme that recognizes isoaspartyl damage to proteins, in the bacterium Escherichia coli.\n\nDr. Visick began working with PCM as a post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Steven Clarke at UCLA. Previously, as a graduate student in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington, he studied the regulation of insecticidal protein synthesis by Bacillus thuringiensis. His undergraduate studies in microbiology were completed at Brigham Young University.\n\nMore than 50 North Central students have been research collaborators with Dr. Visick. Their efforts were funded by an AREA grant from the National Institutes of Health from 2008 to 2012. Dr. Visick has co-authored a bioinformatics textbook with Dr. Caroline St. Clair. He has also taught at the University of Puget Sound and Whitman College and was an HHMI-funded visiting scholar at Lewis and Clark College in 2010.\n\nDownload CV\n\nSelected Scholarship\n\nSelected Publications:\n\nVandenBerg, K.
