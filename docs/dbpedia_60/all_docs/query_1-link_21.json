        "text": "University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Administration and Policy\n\nAnn Arbor, Michigan, Weill Hall\n\nTuesday, April 23, 16:00\n\nThank you very much, Dean Watkins-Hayes, for that warm introduction. Thanks to you and the Ford School for welcoming me here today to deliver this year’s Vandenberg Lecture. I’m so honored to be asked to follow in the long line of distinguished colleagues as well as for the opportunity to come back to my home state of Michigan.\n\nBefore I offer my perspective on Ukraine and our efforts there, I want to recognize a couple additional people at the top. I want to thank Hank Meijer, who I enjoyed meeting earlier today, and the Meijer family for their support of the Vandenberg lecture series. I fondly recall receiving a congratulatory letter from his son, Representative Peter Meijer when I was confirmed as Ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nAnd I’d like to thank my fellow Ambassador and colleague in today’s discussion – Ambassador Susan D. Page. I’ve read all she has done and know she has been active in responding to some of our most pressing conflicts in the world. I look forward to our conversation today.\n\nReaching back into my past a bit further, I’d also like to recognize Steve Biegun, former Deputy Secretary of State and my former boss at the State Department, for his support to Ukraine and the cause of freedom and for reaching out me for this lecture.\n\nIt is a real honor for me to be here at the Ford School. I am deeply touched to follow in the footsteps of previous speakers for the Arthur Vandenberg Lecture — Ambassador Julie Smith, Secretary Tony Blinken, Administrator Samantha Power, CIA Director Bill Burns, and Special Representative for Ukraine’s Economic Recovery Penny Pritzker, who are all my current colleagues. But also, I happen to be from Grand Rapids.\n\nAnd more specifically, from East Grand Rapids, which is the proud home of the 38th President of the United States. This fact is emblazoned on every sign into our city, and growing up it always filled me with pride that this small but lovely town was the home to a President. And not just any president, but one widely known for his honesty and his decency. He took on the presidency at a particularly divisive moment in American history, in the wake of the resignation of Richard Nixon. And President Ford took decisions, including the pardoning of the former president, which were hard and highly controversial at the time – and which many believe cost him the presidential race of 1976. But with time and space, I think the consensus on that fateful decision is that it was the right one for the country.\n\nWhat I want to talk to you about today is the importance of America using this incredible soft and hard power we have as the the leader of the free world – a powerful country whose policy is based on ideals and values – to make the decisions that history will judge as the right ones. And to make those momentous decisions – putting country ahead of everything and everyone else – is what you are all here to consider as you prepare to take up leadership roles in whatever area you choose.\n\nAnd I want to use our time together to talk about those moments, and how Ukraine – and what we do in response to Russia’s invasion – is such a moment happening right now.\n\nToday we face the greatest threat to European peace and security since World War II. President Biden has been clear about the stakes from day one. “If we don’t stop Putin, it will endanger the freedom of everyone almost everywhere. Putin will keep going, and would-be aggressors everywhere will be emboldened to try to take what they can by force.”\n\nMake no mistake, the outcome of Russia’s aggression – its full-scale invasion of a country of 40 million people – will have enormous repercussions in Europe and around the world.\n\nAnd what should we do? It’s clear and simple. We need to act. We must act. And we must do it now. There is not a second to lose. We need to do whatever is necessary to ensure that this unforgivable war – which has cost over one hundred thousand lives and over $500 billion in damage – is a strategic defeat for Putin.\n\nHow do we do it? We need to be fast and we need to work together – Democrats and Republicans – to achieve our shared national security interest in a Europe “whole, free, and at peace,” a longstanding bipartisan policy which has helped to secure peace and prosperity for the U.S. and Europe for 75 years. Our Congress’s vote on Saturday, in response to President Biden’s request, was proof that we can work together to achieve our common security goals. And here I want to thank Speaker Johnson and Leader Jefferies for the leadership role they played at a pivotal moment for Ukraine and U.S. leadership. The vote last Saturday was an absolutely necessary achievement to support our national security.\n\nIt is now on us all to maintain this positive momentum and do what is necessary to defeat Russia. The Senate is now voting on the bill. The President has said he will sign it into law immediately.\n\nI often tell my team in Ukraine that we are working at the speed of war. What does “speed” mean in the Ukraine context? You know, it can sometimes take just three minutes after Russia launches a missile before it reaches Kyiv. We can’t be afraid to act. Ukrainians aren’t afraid to act. In a crisis, you have to act.\n\nAmbassador Rahm Emanuel, back when he was chief of staff for President Obama facing the realities of the worst financial crisis since the great depression, famously said, “Never let a serious crisis go to waste.”\n\nIf there’s one thing I want you to take from our conversation today, it is that crisis demands action, and it demands innovation. And as practitioners of public policy who may find themselves in government, you will be called upon to act, and it is essential that you respond. And it is equally essential you respond based on our values. And that you understand that time is a resource – no action is action. And late action is action.\n\nTo put a finer point on it, I want to quote Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy –\n\n“When you attack us, you’ll look us in the eyes, because you’ll see our faces, not our backs.”\n\nWe are facing a decisive moment in Ukraine. Let me repeat this: the moment is decisive. Why is Congress’s passing of the legislation so critical? Because Ukraine has not had any significant security assistance from us since December. Ukraine is losing territory, losing its energy grid, and losing its most precious asset – its people.\n\nThis is a deliberate plan by Russia to try to wait us out.\n\nMy team and I spent a lot of time in bomb shelters as missiles and drones are launched at the capital and the rest of the country. Every day, cities and towns across Ukraine are subject to missile and drone attacks by Russia.\n\nTake a moment and imagine that statement transposed on the map of the United States. Missiles and drones being sent by Canada or Mexico to cities across our nation – New York, Washington DC, Detroit, Grand Rapids.\n\nRussia has launched thousands of missiles and drones at Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion two years ago, causing a half trillion dollars in damages, killing thousands of civilians, including over 500 children – 500 children – and displaced over 18 million people, with 10 million still displaced today. Those numbers continue to grow. The scenario the Government of Ukraine faces comes quickly into focus – from President Zelenskyy to the chief of the local fire and emergency services department – public servants are not lacking in reasons to act.\n\nSo we need to act. This is why it is so important that Congress has passed the Ukraine supplemental.\n\nEvery day that we and our partners fail to act, it costs lives and it costs territory. And it costs our ability to achieve a vital foreign policy interest of the United States – to stop Russia from seizing a country of 40 million people by force.\n\nWhy does the outcome of Russia’s war in Ukraine matter to us all? This may be obvious to you here at the Ford School, but I know it’s not obvious to all Americans.\n\nI get it. My family is here. They support me unconditionally, but I hear many friends ask – where is this going? When will it end? Can Ukraine win?\n\nHere’s what I say: What’s at stake is not just Ukraine. It’s Europe. It’s the international system we helped build in the wake of World War II’s unimaginable violence and hardship, which cost over 50 million lives, including thousands of Americans, and an estimated over $1 trillion in damages around the world. Furthermore, the horror of the Holocaust made clear what can happen if others don’t act. I firmly believe the statement attributed by some to Edmund Burke,\n\n“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine exemplifies Russia’s effort to pull apart, piece by piece, the security structures that have been the foundation of Transatlantic stability and prosperity for 75 years. When people ask me if this could be a “forever war” my response is that this is a “now war,” that means giving weapons to Ukraine so that our sons and daughters are not called upon to fight the wars our forefathers fought for a Europe “whole, free, and at peace.”\n\nRussia is violating the UN Charter and trying to take by force a country of 40 million, sending missiles and drones to leave millions of people in the cold and dark.\n\nIt is taking over the largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, to threaten a nuclear accident – all to achieve one man’s goals. Russia uses disinformation and cyber attacks to disrupt democratic societies – including ours – in an attempt to do what Russia does best: divide people, destroy things, create chaos. It does not know how to build because it is not a country based on values – instead it is based solely on one thing – power.\n\nWe all know Russia won’t stop with Ukraine.\n\nEmboldened by more territorial conquest, Russia will keep going, keep invading, keep trying to undermine values and institutions that make a strong democracy until we have to send our own men and women somewhere with boots on the ground to stop them. As President Biden has said, we can’t let the bully win.\n\nA Europe “whole, free, and at peace” has meant the most prosperous and stable era in U.S. history. It has been a longstanding bipartisan goal. It is a strategic national interest. It must stay that way. Europe is our largest trading partner and our essential strategic security partner in the days to come. It is with the nations of\n\nEurope that we are joining forces to tackle the problems of today: the Middle East crisis. Global warming. Cyber threats. Iran. North Korea. I know my friend, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith, spoke to you last year about the importance of NATO. It is the world’s premier security alliance.\n\nOur commitment to NATO and Article V is ironclad – an attack on one is an attack on all. September 11, the only time NATO has invoked Article V, is the perfect example of why we need it. We need our Allies, and we need our friends. The only way we can prevail in these big global challenges is together with Allies and partners.\n\nThat means the unity of the U.S. and Europe and the strength of NATO is vital to our national security and prosperity.\n\nLet’s get more into what exactly is happening in Ukraine.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The United States and others responded immediately with sanctions on Russia, with support to Allies on NATO’s eastern flank, and with help to Ukraine to defend itself.\n\nAnalysts and world leaders uniformly predicted Kyiv would fall in days and the Russian invasion would succeed in capturing the country.\n\nBut that didn’t happen. Why?\n\nBecause the Ukrainians stood and fought, with our help.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy’s decision to stay and fight was a pivotal moment. And our decision to lead the free world in supporting Ukraine’s fight for freedom, together with 50 partners, was a decisive point in history. But this is one act of many of millions of people – in Ukraine and around the world – seeing the barbarity in Russia’s actions, working together to respond to this naked and illegal use of force by a nuclear power.\n\nAnd the history of this attempted change of Europe’s borders by force has not been completely written.\n\nWhat happens next will show whether the decision to stand and fight, and our decision to support that fight with others around the world was one that ends in a way that protects the people of Ukraine and the values of the United States and other democratic countries around the world. We are at the equivalent of half time. The home team is behind, but with grit and determination – and support – the home team can and will win.\n\nAnd it is this stark reality that I want to convey. One day, you may face this moment – a moment when everything is on the line and you have to make a hard but necessary decision. Gerald Ford faced it. Joe Biden faced it. Mike Johnson faced it. Volodymyr Zelenskyy faced it. What will you do?\n\nIn late May 2022, I took up my role as U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and arrived in Kyiv with a small group of courageous colleagues at one of the darkest moments of the war. Our Embassy had reopened 11 days before. There were just 10 diplomats. 10 diplomats using words and action.\n\nThe Ukrainians were, as some say, “bleeding out” in Donbas; we had not yet given them sophisticated weapons. But Secretary Blinken’s brave and smart decision to put our diplomatic mission back in Kyiv – even while the war raged on – meant my team and I could give a first-hand view of the situation – and we really did. Raising our voices internally, together with others, to lead and shape the policy discussions. During the summer we gave Ukraine HIMARS and it turned the tide of the war at that moment and propelled this significant counteroffensive in the fall of 2022 which liberated large swaths of territory and villages in the east and the south.\n\nThis counteroffensive resulted in Ukraine taking back 50% of the territory Russia had taken since February 24, 2022.\n\nOf course, we know that this war did not start in 2022, it started in 2014, when Ukraine’s decision to move closer to the European Union resulted in Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea and its occupation of part of eastern Ukraine, called the Donbas, two of Ukraine’s most strategically and economically important geographical spaces.\n\nAs I started with my team in the spring of 2022, we had a chance to see how close the Russians came to capturing Kyiv – a necessary step to overtake the whole country.\n\nMy first visit outside the capital was to Hostomel, the airfield on the northern suburbs of Kyiv that was the location of one of the first and historically will be one of the most decisive battles of the war.\n\nSeizing this airfield would give Russia control over the sky above the capital and provide a landing zone to stream in additional forces and equipment. It was key to Russia’s goal to take the capital and seize the seat of power by killing, capturing, or causing the elected President to flee.\n\nThe Ukrainians knew the stakes, too. After a tough fight, the Ukrainians lost control of the airfield – but only briefly.\n\nThe Ukrainian soldiers there did not give up. And, in fact, they were strengthened by waves of volunteers.\n\nUkrainians left their homes, picked up arms, and joined their military in fighting for Hostomel. The Ukrainians fought on, against the odds but with persistence and determination, and eventually recaptured the airport. They took action, and by doing so, had a pivotal impact on the course of the war.\n\nRussian transports, loaded with troops, had to turn around. The miles-long convoy of Russia’s military was not able to drive to Kyiv, as in addition to stopping Russia from taking the airport closest to Kyiv, other brave people – military and civilian – blew up the bridges that led to the capitol.\n\nThis was a brave and bold decision to do what it takes to survive. And finally the people who lived in the suburbs of the capitol also banded together to fight the Russians who were coming in at night by foot.\n\nThis is a war where Russia has sought to extinguish an entire people for simply seeking to choose their own future. The battle for Mariupol in 2022, a thriving port city on the Sea of Azov, lasted three months with a lot of brave people who stayed and fought to try to protect the city. There, Russia completely destroyed a city of some 400,000 Ukrainians.\n\nMany Ukrainian cities are now globally known for the mass graves Russia left behind: Bucha, Izyum, Lyman.\n\nFlash forward to today – the war is still going on over two years later. And we are at the most decisive moment of the war since the battle for Kyiv.\n\nIn March alone, Russia has escalated its attacks on the energy grid, killed 600 civilians, and caused over $1 billion in damage.\n\nOn April 11, Russia attacked the Thermal Power Plant that supplies the Kyiv region with half of its power, continued attacks on Ukraine’s second largest city – Kharkiv, and struck energy and port infrastructure in an attempt to stop Ukraine’s exports which are critical to its economy.\n\nRecently I traveled to the vibrant city of Dnipro in the East of Ukraine, where I visited a famous hospital that treats many of the soldiers coming from the frontlines. There, I met Myhailo – a soldier who had been badly wounded just the day before.\n\nI told him we were with him. And he had a message for me: “Thank you to President Biden and the people of America for supporting us.” I choked up, as did the room. Despite his injury, he was nothing but positivity and gratitude. What does this say about Ukraine and Ukrainians?\n\nLook at Ukraine’s history, and you’ll learn all about the unbreakable Ukrainian spirit.\n\nAs Russia tried to assert its will over the future of the country in 2014, Ukrainians around the country rose up to say “No!” This began the Revolution of Dignity and a months-long protest, which resulted in then President Viktor Yanukovich fleeing to Moscow.\n\nIn this protest, over 100 Ukrainian protesters – civilians from across the country – lost their lives when they were shot by Yanukovich’s riot police. The actions and lives of these protestors are now enshrined in a memorial on the Maidan, the central square in Kyiv where the movement took place, and they are known as the “Heavenly 100.”\n\nUkrainians don’t refer to this time as the Maidan protest – it’s called the Revolution of Dignity. That’s really all you need to know about Ukrainians.\n\nThey are fighters, and they come together to do so when they see their chosen future at risk.\n\nAs the Revolution of Dignity spread, Russia then invaded Crimea and occupied Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region in 2014. What followed has been 10 years of slow, grinding war along an eastern front. Ukraine lost over 8,000 people even before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\nBut the discussions of territory and borders belie what this is really about: Ukrainians insistence that their future is theirs to decide, and will be a Euro-Atlantic one. The future they are striving for is one where their country and their children will be a part of the Transatlantic family of nations – that means in the EU and in NATO.\n\nOver ¾ [three quarters] of Ukrainians support joining NATO, and the majority of Ukrainians have favorability toward the United States.\n\nWhen you speak to Ukrainians today – almost no matter what age – and they talk about the future, they always begin their sentence with, “After the victory…”. Ukrainians are positive there will be a victory. They cannot and will not accept anything less.\n\nKeep in mind – Ukraine is fighting a war on many fronts:\n\nClearly, they are fighting a kinetic war with Russia.\n\nLess obvious but more important in some ways is Ukraine’s war against institutions of its post-Soviet past, most notably corruption, a weak judiciary, and weak regulatory bodies. A lack of real checks and balances on power. All these legacies are areas that Ukraine seeks to change and overcome to move toward its Euro-Atlantic future.\n\nAverage Ukrainians want clean government and reform. They value independent institutions. They want a system that is transparent, fair, and doesn’t just favor the connected few.\n\nWe are with Ukraine in this, as strong democracies and economies are based on strong institutions and rule of law. It is critical for Ukraine’s strategic goals as well as to attract the private sector investment it needs for its recovery.\n\nThere are three other important lines of effort we are working on with Ukraine: Justice Sector reform, decentralization, and anti-corruption.\n\nOn justice sector reform, we are supporting Ukraine’s establishment of independent and reform just sector institutions to empower people to feel they have a fair trial as well as to empower businesses to have confidence to invest in Ukraine. We are also supporting independent regulatory bodies and corporate governance that meets international standards – all critical to attracting the private sector.\n\nThrough USAID, we’re supporting Ukraine’s decentralization reforms with millions of dollars in assistance to ultimately strengthen local government and institutions so that they are more accountable and inclusive. Our programs have provided emergency supplies to cities and towns across the country as well as hands-on capacity building training to local governments.\n\nAnd Ukraine is making incredible strides in good governance by turning to technology. For example, there’s now a popular app created by the government with support from us that citizens can use to take care of any civic duty from registering their car to registering to vote. It’s called “Diia” which means “action.” This app is also helping people fix their homes that were damaged by missiles and drones in a way that removes any chance for corruption. It’s simply remarkable.\n\nUkraine will not stand still, and Ukrainians do not quit or back down. History has shown us that.\n\nIn an existential war to decide its own future, Ukraine is also rewriting the future – the future of how trade may work. The future of how we will use technology for national defense. The future of our alliances, principal among them, NATO.\n\nUkraine has achieved extraordinary success.\n\nWith our support, and that of Ukraine’s allies and partners, Ukraine has not only survived Russia’s brutal onslaught and recaptured 50 percent of its territory taken by Russia since February 2022, Ukraine also has eliminated Russia’s dominance of the Black Sea and opened the Black Sea Humanitarian Corridor.\n\nIn just eight months, over 1,400 ships and over 40 million tons of grain and other cargo has been sent to global markets, stabilizing the price of grain and feeding the world.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces have integrated new weapons systems, like the U.S. Patriot, to protect cities, saving lives and billions of dollars in damages. The $75 billion in overall U.S. assistance is half of that given by our European allies. Other nations, including Europe, are doing their part.\n\nBeyond the battlefield, the United States is taking concrete steps to constrain the Kremlin’s ability to continue its war and threaten others.\n\nWe and our partners have announced the world’s most sweeping and severe set of sanctions ever imposed. Since February 2022, the Departments of State and Treasury have designated over 4,000 entities and individuals in response to the Kremlin’s war effort. And we continue to add and update to this list.\n\nTogether with our NATO Allies, we have strengthened NATO’s Eastern flank, adding troops to Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia as well as to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.\n\nCritically, we have welcomed Finland and Sweden as NATO Allies, strengthening the Alliance with its 31st and 32nd members.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford put it well when he said, “A great nation cannot abandon its responsibilities. Responsibilities abandoned today return as more acute crises tomorrow.”\n\nBut a nation and its government in the end are made up of people. Everyday people like you and me. It’s about what we decide when the moment comes. When we are called to act.\n\nYou will face such moments in your own lives. And you will have the choice of what to do.\n\nWhat you do in that moment will matter. And it could matter in ways even larger than you realize. It could change the world.\n\nAs you go forward from this wonderful opportunity of learning at one of our country’s greatest public universities, I urge you to draw inspiration and encouragement from the events of the world today.\n\nThe future is not set – it will be set at some point, and how it is set will be up to all of you.\n\nHave courage.\n\nBe guided by your values.\n\nAnd most of all, act.\n\nThis is what will maintain America as a leader of free world. And ensure the opportunities we have enable at home and abroad, persist for our children and beyond.\n\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions at the end."
