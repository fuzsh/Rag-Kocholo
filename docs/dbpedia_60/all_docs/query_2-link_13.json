Officially reopened in 2015 after extensive upgrading, the MEIS laboratory under his charge, is now part of the UK National Ion Beam Centre, funded by EPSRC to provide analytical support to the UK research community.\n\nAfter obtaining his Ir. degree in Applied Physics from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, he moved to the UK to undertake postgraduate research in the Department of Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Salford, obtaining his PhD in 1979. Following an Adjunct Lectureship in Physics at the University of Arhus (DK) and a 6-year Senior Scientific Officer post in the Department of Chemistry at UMIST, he returned to the University of Salford as Lecturer in Electronic and Electrical Engineering, was later promoted Senior Lecturer and after moving to Physics, to Reader in Physics in 2000. In 2003 he became Professor of Ion Beam Physics at Salford where, from 2003 to 2007, he was also Head of Physics."
