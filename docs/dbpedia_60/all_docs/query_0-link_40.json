HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 2d Session 104-887 _______________________________________________________________________ SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES--COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE _______ January 2, 1997.--Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union and ordered to be printed _______________________________________________________________________ Mr. Walker, from the Committee on Science, submitted the following R E P O R T HISTORY OF THE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE The Committee on Science has its roots in the intense reaction to the Soviet launch of Sputnik on October 4, 1957. Early in 1958 Speaker Sam Rayburn convened the House of Representatives, and the first order of the day was a resolution offered by Majority Leader John McCormack of Massachusetts. It read, ``Resolved that there is hereby created a Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration . . . '' The Select Committee performed its tasks with both speed and skill by writing the Space Act creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and chartering the permanent House Committee on Science and Astronautics, now known as the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, with a jurisdiction comprising both science and space. The Science and Astronautics Committee became the first standing Committee to be established in the House of Representatives since 1946. It was also the first time since 1892 that the House and Senate had acted to create standing Committees in an entirely new area. The Committee officially came into being on January 3, 1959, and on its 20th Anniversary the Honorable Charles Mosher said, the Committee ``was born of an extraordinary House-Senate joint leadership initiative, a determination to maintain American preeminence in science and technology, . . . '' The formal jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Astronautics included outer space, both exploration and control, astronautical research and development, scientific research and development, science scholarships, and legislation relating to scientific agencies, especially the National Bureau of Standards, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Council and the National Science Foundation. The Committee retained this jurisdiction from 1959 until the end of the 93rd Congress in 1974. While the Committee's original emphasis in 1959 was almost exclusively astronautics, over this 15-year period the emphasis and workload expanded to encompass scientific research and development in general. In 1974, a Select Committee on Committees, after extensive study, recommended several changes to the organization of the House in H. Res. 988, including expanding the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Astronautics, and changing its name to the Committee on Science and Technology. To the general realm of scientific research and development was added energy, environmental, atmospheric, and civil aviation R&D, and also jurisdiction over the National Weather Service. In addition to these legislative functions, the Committee on Science and Technology was assigned a ``special oversight'' function, giving it the exclusive responsibility among all Congressional standing Committees to review and study, on a continuing basis, all laws, programs and government activities involving federal nonmilitary research and development. In 1977, with the abolition of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, the Committee was further assigned jurisdiction over civilian nuclear research and development thereby rounding out its jurisdiction for all civilian energy R&D. A Committee's jurisdiction gives it both a mandate and a focus. It is, however, the Committee's Chairman that gives it a unique character. The Committee on Science and Technology has had the good fortune to have had five very talented and distinctly different Chairmen, each very creative in his own way in directing the Committee's activities. Congressman Overton Brooks was the Science and Astronautics Committee's first Chairman, and was a tireless worker on the Committee's behalf for the 2\\1/2\\ years he served as Chairman. When Brooks convened the first meeting of the new Committee in January of 1959, Committee Member Ken Hechler recalled, ``There was a sense of destiny, a tingle of realization that every member was embarking on a voyage of discovery, to learn about the unknown, to point powerful telescopes toward the cosmos and unlock secrets of the universe, and to take part in a great experiment.'' With that spirit the Committee began its work. Brooks worked to develop closer ties between the Congress and the scientific community. On February 2, 1959, opening the first official hearing of the new Committee Chairman Brooks said, ``Although perhaps the principal focus of the hearings for the next several days will be on astronautics, it is important to recognize that this Committee is concerned with scientific research across the board.'' And so, from the beginning, the Committee was concerned with the scope of its vision. Overton Brooks died of a heart attack in September of 1961, and the chairmanship of the Committee was assumed by Congressman George Miller of California. Miller, a civil engineer, was unique among Members of Congress who rarely come to the legislature with a technical or scientific background. He had a deep interest in science, and his influence was clearly apparent in the broadening of the charter of the National Science Foundation and the establishment of the Office of Technology Assessment. He pioneered in building strong relationships with leaders of science in other nations. This work developed the focus for a new Subcommittee established during his chairmanship, known as the Subcommittee on Science, Research and Development. Just a few months before Miller became Chairman, President John F. Kennedy announced to a joint session of Congress the national commitment to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth before the end of the decade. Thus, during Miller's 11-year tenure as Chairman, the Committee directed its main efforts toward the development of the space program. Chairman Miller was not reelected in the election of 1972, so in January of 1973, Olin E. Teague of Texas took over the helm of the Committee. Teague, a man of directness and determination, was a highly decorated hero of the second World War. He was a long-standing Member of Congress and Chairman of the Veterans Committee before taking over the chairmanship of the Science and Technology Committee. Throughout the 1960's and early 1970's, Teague chaired the Science Committee's Manned Space Flight Subcommittee, and in that capacity firmly directed the efforts to send a man to the moon. As Chairman of the Committee, Teague placed heavy emphasis on educating the Congress and the public on the practical value of space. He also prodded NASA to focus on the industrial and human applications of the space program. One of Teague's first decisions as Chairman was to set up a Subcommittee on Energy. During his six-year leadership of the Committee, energy research and development became a major part of the Committee's responsibilities. In 1976, Chairman Teague saw the fruition of three years of intensive Committee work to establish a permanent presence for science in the White House. The Office of Science and Technology Policy was established with a Director who would also serve as the President's Science Advisor. Throughout his leadership, he voiced constant concern that the complicated technical issues the Committee considered be expressed in clear and simple terms so that Members of Congress, as well as the general public, would understand the issues. After six years as Chairman, Teague retired from the Committee and the Congress due to serious health problems. He was succeeded by Don Fuqua, a Representative from northern Florida. Fuqua became Chairman on January 24, 1979, at the beginning of the 96th Congress and was the youngest Member to succeed to the Committee's chairmanship. Don Fuqua came to the Congress after two terms in the Florida State Legislature and was, at age 29, the youngest Democrat in Congress when he was elected in 1962. Fuqua's experience on the Committee dated back to the first day of his Congressional service. Since 1963, he had served as a member of the Committee's Manned Space Flight Subcommittee. When Olin Teague became Chairman of the Committee in 1973, Fuqua took Teague's place as Chairman of the Subcommittee. As the Subcommittee Chairman he was responsible for major development decisions on the Space Shuttle and the successful Apollo-Soyuz link-up in space between American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts. Later, the Subcommittee's responsibility was expanded to cover all other NASA activities and was renamed the Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. As Chairman of the Committee, Fuqua's leadership could be seen in the expansion of Committee activities to include technological innovation, science and math education, materials policy, robotics, technical manpower, and nuclear waste disposal. He worked to strengthen the Committee's ties with the scientific and technical communities to assure that the Committee was kept abreast of current developments, and could better plan for the future. During the 99th Congress, the Science and Technology Committee, under Fuqua's chairmanship, carried out two activities of special note. The first was the initiation of a study of the nation's science policy encompassing the 40-year period between the end of the second World War and the present. The intent was to identify strengths and weaknesses in our nation's science network. At the end of the 99th Congress, Chairman Fuqua issued a personal compilation of essays and recommendations on American science and science policy issues in the form of a Chairman's Report. The second activity was a direct outgrowth of the Space Shuttle ``Challenger'' accident of January 28, 1986. As part of the Committee's jurisdictional responsibility over all the NASA programs and policies, a steering group of Committee members, headed by Congressman Robert Roe, the Ranking Majority Member, conducted an intensive investigation of the Shuttle accident. The Committee's purpose and responsibility were not only the specific concern for the safe and effective functioning of the Space Shuttle program, but the larger objective of insuring that NASA, as the nation's civilian space agency, maintain organizational and programmatic excellence across the board. Chairman Fuqua announced his retirement from the House of Representatives at the termination of the 99th Congress. He served 24 years on the Committee on Science and Technology and 8 years as its Chairman. Congressman Robert A. Roe of New Jersey, a long-time member of the Committee, became its new Chairman at the beginning of the 100th Congress. With this fifth Chairman, the Committee was once again presided over by an individual with professional technical expertise. Congressman Roe was trained as an engineer and brought that broad knowledge and understanding to bear on the Committee's issues from the first day of his tenure. Congressman Roe's first official act as Chairman was to request a change in the Committee's name from the Committee on Science and Technology to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. This change was designed not only to reflect the Committee's broad space jurisdiction, but also to convey the importance of space exploration and development to the nation's future. In the 100th Congress, under Chairman Roe's stewardship, the Committee kept close scrutiny over NASA's efforts to redesign and reestablish the space shuttle program. The successful launch of the Shuttle Discovery in September, 1988 marked America's return to space after 32 months without launch capability. The vulnerability of having the nation's launch capability concentrated singularly in the Space Shuttle, and the rapid increase of foreign competition in commercial space activities, precipitated strong Committee action to help ensure the competitive posture of the nation's emerging commercial launch industry. Chairman Roe's leadership to stabilize and direct the nation's space program led to the Committee's first phase of multi-year authorizations for research and development programs with the advent of three year funding levels for the Space Station. Within the national movement to improve America's technological competitiveness, Chairman Roe headed the Committee's initiative to expand and redefine the mission of the National Bureau of Standards in order for it to aid American industry in meeting global technological challenges. The Science Committee has a long tradition of alerting the Congress and the nation to new scientific and technological opportunities that have potential to create dramatic economic or societal change. Among these have been recombinant DNA research and supercomputer technology. In the 100th Congress, members of the Committee included the new breakthroughs in superconductivity research in this category. Several long-term efforts of the Committee came to fruition during the 101st Congress. As the community of space-faring nations expanded, and as space exploration and development moved toward potential commercialization in some areas, the need arose for legal certainty concerning intellectual property rights in space. Legislation long advocated by the Science Committee defining the ownership of inventions in outer space became public law during this Congress. Continuing the Committee's interest long range energy research programs for renewable and alternative energy sources, a national hydrogen research and development program was established to lead to economic production of hydrogen from renewable resources its use as an alternative fuel. At the end of the 101st Congress, the House Democratic Caucus voted Representative Roe Chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee to fill the vacancy in that Committee's Chairmanship. Congressman Roe, who served as Chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for the 100th and the 101st Congresses, brought a leadership style of high energy and strong enthusiasm to the Committee. He was known for his tenacious commitment to understanding an issue down to its smallest detail. The hallmark of Representative Roe's four-year tenure as Chairman was his articulation of science, space, and technology as the well-spring for generating the new wealth for America's future economic growth and long-term security. At the beginning of the 102nd Congress in January, 1991, Representative George E. Brown, Jr. of southern California became the sixth Chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. He was the third Chairman, among the six, to bring scientific or technical experience to the position. Trained in industrial physics, Brown worked as a civil engineer for many years before entering politics. Elected to the Congress in 1962, Brown has been a member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee since 1965. During his more than two decade tenure on the Committee before becoming its Chairman, he chaired Subcommittees on the environment, on research and technology, and on transportation and aviation R&D. Whether from his insightful leadership as a Subcommittee Chairman or from the solitary summit of a futurist, Brown brought a visionary perspective to the Committee's dialogue by routinely presenting ideas far ahead of the mainstream agenda. George Brown talked about conservation and renewable energy sources, technology transfer, sustainable development, environmental degradation, and an agency devoted to civilian technology when there were few listeners and fewer converts. He tenaciously stuck to these beliefs and time has proven his wisdom and clairvoyance. Consistent with his long-held conviction that the nation needed a coherent technology policy, Brown's first action as Chairman was to create a separate Subcommittee for technology and competitiveness issues. During his initial year as Chairman, Brown developed an extensive technology initiative which was endorsed by the House of Representatives in the final days of the 102nd Congress. The work articulated Brown's concept of a partnership between the public and private sectors to improve the nation's competitiveness. The culmination of the 102nd Congress saw Brown's persistent efforts to redirect our national energy agenda come to fruition. The first broad energy policy legislation enacted in over a decade included a strong focus on conservation, renewable energy sources, and the expanded use of non-petroleum fuels, especially in motor vehicles. In Brown's continuing concern to demonstrate the practical application of advances in science and technology, he instituted the first international video-conferenced meetings in the U.S. Congress. In March of 1992, members of the Science Committee exchanged ideas on science and technology via satellite with counterparts from the Commonwealth of Independent States. This pilot program in the House of Representatives resulted in a decision to establish permanent in-house capacity for video-conferencing for the House. As a final activity in the 102nd Congress, Brown issued a Chairman's Report on the federally funded research enterprise. The work will serve as the starting point for a comprehensive review and revision of federal science policy currently in the planning stage. The 1994 Congressional elections turned over control of the Congress to the Republican party. The House Republican Conference acted to change the official name of the Committee from the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, to the Committee on Science. Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania became the Science Committee's first Republican Chairman, and the seventh Committee Chairman. Walker had served on the Science Committee since his election to Congress in 1976, and had been the Ranking Member since 1989. Chairman Walker acted to streamline the Subcommittee structure from five to four Subcommittees: Basic Research, Energy and Environment, Space and Aeronautics, and Technology. This action reflected the new Congress' mandate to increase efficiency and cut expenses, and also reflected Walker's personal desire to refocus the Committee's work. Due to the reduction in the number of Subcommittees and a sharper focus on the issues, the number of hearings was reduced, while the number of measures passed by the House and signed into law increased. Chairman Walker chose to use the Full Committee venue to hold hearings exploring the role of science and technology in the future. The first hearing, ``Is Today's Science Policy Preparing Us for the Future?'' served as the basis for much of the Committee's work during the 104th Congress. For the first time in recent Science Committee history, every agency under the Committee's jurisdiction was authorized. To preserve and enhance the core federal role of creating new knowledge for the future, the Science Committee sought to prioritize basic research policies. In order to do so, the Committee took strong, unprecedented action by applying six criteria to civilian R&D: (1) Federal R&D efforts should focus on long-term, non- commercial R&D, leaving economic feasibility and commercialization to the marketplace. (2) All R&D programs should be relevant and tightly focused to the agencies' missions. (3) Government-owned laboratories should confine their in- house research to areas in which their technical expertise and facilities have no peer and should contract out other research to industry, private research foundations and universities (4) The Federal Government should not fund research in areas that are receiving, or should reasonably be expected to obtain, funding from the private sector. (5) Revolutionary ideas and pioneering capabilities that make possible the impossible should be pursued within controlled, performance-based funding levels. (6) Federal R&D funding should not be carried out beyond demonstration of technical feasibility. Significant additional private investment should be required for economic feasibility, commercial development, production and marketing. The authorization bills produced by the Science Committee reflected those standards, thereby protecting basic research and emphasizing the importance of science as a national issue. As an indication of the Science Committee's growing influence, the recommendations and basic science programs were prioritized accordingly. During the 104th Congress, the Science Committee's oversight efforts were focused on exploring ways to make government more efficient; improve management of taxpayer resources; expose waste, fraud and abuse; and give the United States the technological edge into the 21st Century. Chapter I--Legislative Activities of the Committee on Science During the 104th Congress, 83 bills were referred to the Committee on Science. Committee interests were incorporated at the conference stage on 4 measures; 16 legislative reports were filed in the House; 9 measures passed the House; 8 measures were incorporated into an omnibus authorization bill which passed the House; and 4 measures were enacted. Background and summary of legislation Many of the United States' economic advances of the new millennium will be rooted in the research and development performed in our laboratories today. Our nation's future well- being, therefore, becomes dependent on the continuous transfer of basic science and technology from our laboratories in the United States, including our federal laboratories, to the private sector to create commercial goods and services. Successful technology transfer results in the creation of innovative products or processes becoming available to meet or induce market demand. Congress has long tried to encourage transfer to the private sector of unclassified technology created in our federal laboratories. This is eminently logical since federal laboratories are considered one of our nation's greatest assets; yet, they are also a largely untapped resource of technical expertise. The United States has over 700 federal laboratories, employing one of six scientists in the nation and occupying one-fifth of the country's lab and equipment capabilities. It is, therefore, important to our future economic well-being to make the ideas and resources of our federal laboratory scientists available to United States companies for commercialization opportunities. By permitting effective collaboration between our federal laboratories and private industry, new technologies and industrial innovation can be effectively commercialized and brought into the broader economy, thus enhancing our nation's ability to compete in the global marketplace. To help further this goal, Congress first enacted the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-480). The Stevenson- Wydler Act required federal laboratories to take an active role in technical cooperation and established technology transfer offices at all major federal laboratories. That landmark legislation expanded considerably with the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-502) and the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-189). The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 allowed a government-owned, government-operated (GOGO) laboratory staffed by federal employees to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with industry, universities, and others. The CRADA mechanism allows a laboratory and an industrial company to negotiate patent rights and royalties before they conduct joint research, giving the company patent protection for any inventions and products that result from the collaboration. This patent protection provides an incentive for the companies to invest in turning laboratory ideas into commercial products. Furthermore, if a federal laboratory negotiates the payment of royalties as part of a CRADA arrangement, the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 provides that part of those royalties are shared with the federal inventor as a reward for his or her work and as an incentive to them and others to report and assist in the transfer of potentially valuable inventions. A CRADA also provides a federal laboratory with valuable insights into the needs and priorities of industry, and with the expertise available only in industry, that enhances a laboratory's ability to accomplish its mission. The National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, included as Section 3131 et seq. of the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (P.L. 101-189), extended the CRADA authority to a government-owned, contractor- operated (GOCO) laboratory such as the Department of Energy laboratories. It also protected information and innovations, brought into and created through a CRADA, from disclosure. Since the inception in 1986 of the CRADA legislation, over 2,000 agreements have been signed, resulting in the transfer of technology, knowledge, and expertise back and forth between our federal laboratories and the private sector. Under current law, the work done under a CRADA must not detract from the mission responsibilities of a federal laboratory. The federal laboratory may accept funds, personnel, services, and property from the private sector partner and may provide personnel, services, and property in return, but the labs are expressly prohibited from providing direct funding to their collaborating partners. Despite the success of the CRADA legislation, there are existing impediments to private companies entering into CRADAs. The law was originally designed to provide a great deal of flexibility in the negotiation of intellectual property rights to both the private sector partner and the federal laboratory; however, it provides little guidance to either party on the adequacy of those rights a private sector partner should receive in a CRADA. Agencies are given broad discretion in the determination of intellectual property rights under CRADA legislation. This has often resulted in laborious negotiations of patent rights for certain laboratories and their partners each time they discuss a new CRADA. With options ranging from assigning the company full patent title to providing the company with only a nonexclusive license for a narrow field of use, both sides must undergo this negotiation on the range of intellectual property rights for each CRADA. This uncertainty of intellectual property rights, coupled with the time and effort required in negotiation, may now be hindering collaboration by the private sector with federal laboratories. This, in essence, has become a barrier to technology transfer. Companies are reluctant to enter into CRADAs, or equally important, to commit substantial investments to commercialize CRADA inventions, unless they have some assurance they will control important intellectual property rights. H.R. 2196, the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995, seeks to enhance the possibility of commercialization of technology and industrial innovation in the United States by providing assurances that sufficient rights to intellectual property will be granted to the private sector partner with a federal laboratory. The Act guarantees to the private sector partner the option, at minimum, of selecting an exclusive license in a field of use for a new invention created in a CRADA. The company would then have the right to use the new invention in exchange for reasonable compensation to the laboratory. In addition, H.R. 2196 addresses concerns about government rights to an invention created in a CRADA. It provides that the Federal Government will retain minimum statutory rights to use the technology for its own purposes. It provides limited government ``march-in-rights'' if there is a public necessity that requires compulsory licensing of the technology. H.R. 2196 also provides enhanced financial incentives and rewards to federal laboratory scientists for new technology that results in marketable products, to be paid for from the income the laboratories receive for the commercialized technology. Legislative history Congresswoman Constance A. Morella of Maryland introduced H.R. 2196 on August 4, 1995. The bill was originally cosponsored by Congressmen Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, George E. Brown, Jr., of California, and John S. Tanner of Tennessee. Senator John D. Rockefeller, IV, of West Virginia introduced the Senate companion bill, S. 1164, on August 10, 1995. On June 27, 1995, the House Science Committee's Technology and Basic Research Subcommittees held a joint hearing on technology transfer and our federal laboratories, with a focus on the draft text of H.R. 2196. The testimony from the June hearing supplemented the hearing record already established in the previous Congress on the bill text. On September 20, 1994, in the 103rd Congress, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee's Technology, Environment, and Aviation Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 3590, the Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 1993, which led to further refinements in the bill. On October 18, 1995, the Technology Subcommittee unanimously reported H.R. 2196 favorably to the Full Committee, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The amendment incorporated certain provisions affecting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), among others, which were approved by the House Science Committee, on June 28, 1995, as part of H.R. 1870, the American Technology Advancement Act of 1995. The amendment provisions were passed by the House on October 12, 1995, in Title VI of H.R. 2405, the Omnibus Civilian Science Authorization Act of 1995. On October 25, 1995, the Science Committee considered H.R. 2196, as amended by the Subcommittee. The Committee accepted certain additional amendments to the bill and ordered H.R. 2196 reported to the House without objection by voice vote. On December 7, 1995, H.R. 2196 was reported to the House (amended) by the House Committee on Science Report Number 104-390. It was placed on Union Calendar Number 197 on December 7, 1995. On December 7, 1995, H.R. 2196 was called up by the House under suspension of the Rules and passed by voice vote. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on December 13, 1995. On February 7, 1996, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation discharged by Unanimous Consent and laid the measure before the Senate. S.1194 passed the Senate (amended) by voice vote on February 7, 1996. (Senate Report 104-194) On February 27, 1996, the motion that the House suspend the rules and agree to the Senate amendments, was agreed to by voice vote. On March 7, 1996, the President signed the bill which became P.L. 104-113. Background, summary, and legislative history On June 10, 1996, Mr. Bliley introduced H.R. 3604, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996. On June 10, 1996, the bill was referred to the House Committee on Commerce. On June 11, 1996, the Commerce Committee marked-up the bill and ordered the measure reported (amended) by a vote of 42--0 (Report No. 104-632 (Part I)). On June 24, 1996, the bill was referred to the House Committee on Science sequentially, for a period ending not later than July 24, 1996. On June 25, 1996, the measure passed the House (amended) under suspension of rules by voice vote. The amendment included a new Title VI: Drinking Water Research Authorization, which included the drinking water related provisions of Title V of H.R. 3322. S. 1316, Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995, the Senate Companion to H.R. 3604, was taken-up in lieu of H.R. 3604. On October 12, 1996, S. 1316 was introduced by Senator Kempthorne and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. On October 24, 1995, the Committee ordered the measure reported (amended) (Report No. 104-169). On November 29, 1995, S. 1316 passed the Senate (amended) by Yea-Nay Vote: 99--0 (Record Vote No: 588). On July 17, 1996, the House struck all after the enacting clause and substituted the language of H.R. 3604; passed the measure by voice vote; insisted upon its amendment; requested conference; and the Speaker appointed conferees: from the Committee on Commerce for consideration of the Senate bill and the House amendment (except for Title V), and modifications committed to conference; as additional conferees from the Committee on Science (Walker, Rohrabacher, and Roemer), for the consideration of that portion of section 3 that adds a new section 1478 and sections 23, 25(f), and 28(f) of the Senate bill, and that portion of section 308 that adds a new section 1452(n) and section 402 and Title VI of the House amendment, and modifications committed to conference; and as additional conferees from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for the consideration of that portion of section 3 that adds a new section 1471(c) and sections 9, 17, 22(d), 25(a), 25(g), 28(a), 28(e), 28(h), and 28(i) of the Senate bill, and Title V of the House amendment and modifications committed to conference. On July 18, 1996, the Senate disagreed to the House amendment by unanimous consent; agreed to the request for conference; and appointed conferees. On August 1, 1996, Conference Report H. Rept. 104-741 was filed. Title VI was modified and became Title II of the Conference Report. Title II, Drinking Water Research, authorizes $26,593,000 annually to be appropriated for drinking water research for FY 1997 through 2003; directs the Administrator to develop a strategic plan for drinking water research activities throughout EPA, integrate the plan into ongoing EPA planning activities, and review all EPA drinking water research to ensure the research is of high quality and does not duplicate any other research being conducted by EPA. A section added in conference from the Senate bill authorizes the Administrator of EPA to reestablish a partnership between the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Research Laboratory and the National Center for Ground Water Research to conduct research, training, and technology transfer for ground water quality protection and restoration. On August 2, 1996, the House agreed to the Conference Report by yea-nay vote: 392--30 (Record Vote No: 399); the Senate agreed to the conference report by yea-nay vote: 98--0 (Record Vote No: 263); the measure was cleared for the White House and presented to the President. On August 6, 1996, the President signed the measure (P.L. 104-182). Background and summary of legislation The Committee participated in the House-Senate Conference on H.R. 3230, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. Messrs. Walker, Sensenbrenner, and Mrs. Harman were appointed conferees for Sections 203, Dual-Use Technology Programs; 211, Space Launch Modernization; 245, Amendments to Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research; and 247, National Oceanographic Partnership Act, of the House bill, and sections 211, Space Launch Modernization; 251-252, National Oceanographic Partnership Act; and 1044, Prohibition on Collection and Release of Detailed Satellite Imagery Relating to Israel and Other Countries and Areas, of the Senate amendment. All three Members signed the conference report. The language of Section 247 of the House bill, National Oceanographic Partnership Act, was similar to Section 453 of H.R. 3322, Omnibus Civilian Science Authorization Act of 1996, as passed by the Committee on Science. Minor changes were made to reconcile the House and Senate versions of this provision. Legislative history H.R. 3230 was introduced on April 15, 1996, and passed by the House on May 15, 1996. The Senate passed S. 1745 on July 10, 1996, and requested a conference. The conference report cleared the House on August 1, the Senate on September 10, and the President signed the legislation on September 23, 1996 (P.L. 104-201). Background and summary of legislation The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty established specific principles and rules for protection of the Antarctic environment from human activities. Specifically, the Protocol addresses the protection of flora and fauna, imposes strict limits on the discharge of pollutants, and requires environmental impact assessments of planned governmental and non-governmental activities. The Protocol also forbids prospecting or development of Antarctic mineral resources, but excludes scientific research. A particularly important aspect of the Protocol is its reinforcement of the status of Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. Antarctica is recognized as a unique scientific laboratory of enormous value to the international community. Preservation of the unique environment is intrinsic to its value for scientific purposes, and the Environmental Protocol is intended to help ensure that the pristine environment of the continent is preserved. The Protocol was signed by the United States in October of 1991 and was approved by the Senate in October 1992. The United States must enact legislation in order to ratify the protocol. The protocol, however, is not self-executing. In order for the Protocol to be fully effective and enforceable, all 26 of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties must ratify the Protocol. Of the 26 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties only 20 have ratified the Protocol, leaving the United States, Russia, Japan, India, Belgium, and Finland to complete action. H.R. 3060 provides the necessary legislative authority for the United States to implement the Protocol. Legislative history H.R. 3060 was introduced by Chairman Walker and 19 other original cosponsors on March 12, 1996. It was referred to the Committee on Science and to the Committees on International Relations, and Resources for those provisions under their jurisdiction. On April 18, 1996, the Full Committee held a hearing to review the bill. Witnesses included: Ms. Eileen Claussen, Assistant Secretary of State, Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, U.S. Department of State; Dr. Neal Lane, Director, National Science Foundation; Ms. Kathryn S. Fuller, President, World Wildlife Fund; and Dr. Robert H. Rutford, Program of Geosciences, University of Texas at Dallas. All witnesses were supportive of legislation to implement the Protocol. The Full Committee met to mark up the legislation on April 24, 1996. A quorum being present, H.R. 3060 was approved, without amendment, by voice vote, and ordered reported. The Committee filed House Report 104-593, Part 1, on May 23, 1996. Also on May 23, 1996, the Committees on International Relations and Resources discharged H.R. 3060 from further consideration. A related measure was introduced in the Senate by Senator John Kerry (D-MA) on March 26, 1996 (S. 1645). It was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. No Senate hearings were held on the measure this Congress. Hearings were held in the previous Congress. The Full Committee met to mark up the legislation on June 6, 1996. S. 1645 was approved by the Committee and ordered reported, unamended. The Committee filed Senate Report 104-332 on July 24, 1996. On June 10, 1996, H.R. 3060 was called up by the House under Suspension of the Rules and passed by a recorded vote of Yeas--352 to Nays--4. H.R. 3060 was received in the Senate on June 11, 1996. On September 4, 1996, the Senate called up H.R. 3060 and inserted the text of S. 1645 as amended. H.R. 3060, as amended, passed the Senate by unanimous consent. On September 10, 1996, H.R. 3060, as amended by the Senate, was called up by the House under Suspension of the Rules, and passed by voice vote. H.R. 3060 was presented to the President for signature on September 20, 1996. On October 2, 1996, the President signed H.R. 3060 into law (P.L. 104-227). Background, summary, and legislative history On May 16, 1996, Chairwoman Morella introduced H.R. 3438, the Federal Aviation Administration--Research, Engineering, and Development Authorization and Management Reform Act of 1996. Its major provisions were subsequently incorporated into Title VII of H.R. 3322, the Omnibus Civilian Science Authorization Act of 1996. The Full Committee met to mark up a Committee print for H.R. 3322 on April 24, 1996. After adopting five amendments, a quorum being present, the Full Committee approved the Committee print, as amended, by a recorded vote of yeas--24 to nays--19, and ordered it reported. A motion was then adopted to prepare a clean bill for introduction in the House, and that the measure be deemed reported by the Committee. The Committee filed House Report 104-550, Part 1, on May 1, 1996. On May 6, 1996, the Committees on Resources, Transportation and Infrastructure, and National Security discharged H.R. 3322 from further consideration. On May 7, 1996, the Committee on Rules granted an open rule, adopting H. Res. 427. On May 9, 1996, the House passed the rule. H.R. 3322 was called up by the House under an open rule on May 29, 1996, with the Committee Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. It was considered on May 29 and 30, 1996, and passed the House, with amendments, by voice vote, on May 30, 1996. H.R. 3322 was received in the Senate on June 3, 1996, and referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The Senate took no formal action on this legislation. Title VII of H.R. 3322 (as passed by the House) was added to H.R. 3539 (Title VI/Title XI of the Conference Report), The Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996. Title XI of the Conference Report is the FAA Research, Engineering, and Development (RD&E) Management Reform Act of 1996. Title XI authorizes $208 million for FAA research and development activities in Fiscal Year (FY) 1997--an increase of $21 million over the FY 1996 appropriated level. The language in Title XI was modified in Conference to increase the authorization for aviation security research by just over $21 million. This increase should allow the FAA to step-up its efforts to develop effective anti-terrorism technologies for U.S. airports. The title further directs the FAA research advisory committee to annually review the FAA research and development funding allocations and requires the Administrator of the FAA to consider the advisory committee's advice in establishing its annual funding priorities. Title XI streamlines the requirements of the National Aviation Research Plans and shortens the time-frame the plans must cover from 15 to 5 years. On May 29, 1996, Mr. Shuster introduced H.R. 3539, the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996. The bill was called up by House Under Suspension of Rules on September 10, 1996. An Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute was passed which included a new Title VI, the Federal Aviation Administration-- Research, Engineering, and Development Authorization and Management Reform Act of 1996. Title VI is identical to Title VII of H.R. 3322 as passed by the House on May 30, 1996. The House passed H.R. 3539 (amended) by recorded vote 398--17 (Record Vote No: 411) on September 11, 1996. The bill was received in the Senate on September 12, 1996. On September 18, 1996, the measure was laid before the Senate by Unanimous Consent and the Senate struck all after the enacting clause and substituted the language of S. 1994 (amended). That day, the Senate passed H.R. 3539 in lieu of S. 1994 by yea-nay vote: 99--0 (Record Vote No. 293). The Senate then insisted upon its amendment and requested a conference. On September 19, 1996, the Senate appointed conferees. On September 24, 1996, the House disagreed to the Senate amendment by Unanimous Consent; agreed to conference; and the Speaker appointed conferees from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for consideration of the House bill and the Senate amendment and modifications committed to conference; and the Speaker appointed additional conferees-- from the Committee on Rules for consideration of section 675 of the Senate bill, and modifications committed to conference; from the Committee on Science (Walker, Morella, and Brown (CA)) for consideration of sections 601--05 of the House bill and section 103 of the Senate amendment, and modifications committed to conference; and for consideration of section 501 of the Senate amendment and modifications committed to conference (Walker, Sensenbrenner, and Brown (CA)); and from the Committee on Ways and Means for consideration of section 501 of the House bill and sections 417, 906, and 1001 of the Senate amendment and modifications committed to conference. On September 26, 1996, Conference report H. Rept. 104-848 was filed. Title VI of H.R. 3539 became Title XI of the Conference Report with an amendment. On September 27, 1996, the House agreed to Conference Report by yea-nay vote: 218--198 (Record Vote No: 446). On October 1, 1996, the conference report was considered in Senate. On October 3, 1996 cloture on the Conference Report was invoked by yea-nay vote: 66--31 (Record Vote No: 304); the Senate agreed to the Conference Report by yea-nay vote: 92--2 (Record Vote No: 306); and the bill was cleared for the White House. On October 9, 1996, the President signed the measure (P.L. 104-264). Background and summary of legislation Hydrogen, as a gas or in liquid form, is an attractive source of energy because it combusts to water vapor and nitrogen oxide, leaving almost none of the pollutants associated with fossil fuels. There are several methods of producing hydrogen from water and other renewables, however, basic research is still needed to overcome many technical barriers. In a chemical reaction known as electrolysis, an enormous amount of energy is required to separate hydrogen from water molecules and to cool the gas enough to liquefy it. Equipment needed to store and burn liquid hydrogen is costly and heavy. At present, oil, natural gas and ethanol are less costly to produce. But recent technological breakthroughs, especially in the development of solar cells, may soon provide an inexpensive source of electricity to power electrolysis, which will make hydrogen cost competitive with fossil fuels. In 1989, Congress passed the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989, P.L. 101- 218, to foster greater efficiency in the use of available energy supplies and greater use of renewable energy technologies. The Act directed the Secretary of Energy to: pursue cost competitive use of renewable energy technologies without the need of federal financial incentives; establish long-term federal research goals and multi-year funding goals; undertake initiatives to improve the ability of the private sector to commercialize in the near term renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies; and foster collaborative research and development efforts involving the private sector through government support of a program of joint ventures. The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989 authorized a number of energy research and development programs, including hydrogen. In fact, P.L. 101-218 required a separate, autonomous hydrogen program be established and delineated in the budget. Hydrogen activities, however, were loosely administered by the Department of Energy and hydrogen research and development was never given the priority and programmatic self-sufficiency which Congress intended. A coordinated federal program for hydrogen research, development, and demonstration was established by passage of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Program Act of 1990, P.L. 101-566. The Act set forth guidelines to carry out a federal program with the goal of resolving critical technical issues necessary for the development of hydrogen technologies. The funding authorization for the Act expired in FY 1994. A supplemental legislative initiative for hydrogen research, development, and demonstration was included in Section 2026 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, P.L. 102-486. The provisions reinforced the five-year program on renewable hydrogen energy contained in P.L. 101-566 and required collaborative projects with industry to test and evaluate the production of hydrogen from a renewable energy source and to assess the feasibility of modifying existing natural gas pipelines to transport hydrogen and natural gas mixtures. H.R. 655, the Hydrogen Future Act of 1995, continues to support a hydrogen research program by focusing the program on basic research and development. It establishes a coordinated basic research, development and demonstration program at DOE. Legislative history H.R. 655 was introduced by Chairman Walker on January 24, 1995, and referred solely to the Committee on Science. On February 1, 1995, the Full Committee held a hearing to review the bill. Witnesses included: the Honorable Christine A. Ervin, Assistant Secretary, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy; Dr. Alan C. Lloyd, Chief Scientist, South Coast Air Quality Management District; Mr. Edward Trlica, President, Energy Partners, Inc.; and, Dr. Robert H. Williams, Senior Research Scientist, Center for Energy and Environmental Studies, Princeton University. Comments and criticisms were received on the bill. The Full Committee met to mark up the legislation on February 10, 1995. Mr. Walker offered an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute, which was adopted by unanimous consent. This amendment incorporated suggestions made by the witnesses at the hearing. After adopting eleven amendments to the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute, a quorum being present, the Full Committee approved H.R. 655, as amended, by voice vote, and ordered the bill reported. The Committee filed House Report 104-95 on March 30, 1995. On May 1, 1995, the Committee on Rules granted an open rule, adopting H. Res. 136. On May 2, 1995, the House passed the rule and passed the bill, with amendments, by voice vote. H.R. 655 was received in the Senate on May 3, 1995, and was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources' Subcommittee on Energy Research and Development. On March 20, 1996, the Subcommittee on Energy Research and Development held a hearing on the bill. The Full Committee marked up the bill on September 12, 1996 and ordered it reported, with an amendment, by voice vote (no subcommittee markup was held). On September 13, 1996, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported H.R. 655, with an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute (no legislative report was filed by the Senate on this measure). H.R. 4138, the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996, was introduced by Chairman Walker on September 24, 1996, and referred solely to the Committee on Science for consideration. H.R. 4138 incorporates some changes made to the earlier bill (H.R. 655) to accommodate interests of Members of the Senate. H.R. 4138 was called up under Suspension of the Rules on September 26, 1996 and passed by voice vote. The bill was received in the Senate on September 27, 1996, and on September 28, 1996 passed by unanimous consent. H.R. 4138 was presented to the President on September 30, 1996, for signature. On October 9, 1996, the President signed H.R. 4138 into law (P.L. 104-271). Background and summary of legislation The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (P.L. 94-168), as amended by the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act (P.L. 100-418), was enacted in order to set forth the policy of the United States to convert to the metric system. Section 3 of that Act requires that each federal agency use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants and other business related activities, unless that use is likely to cause significant cost or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units. Currently, many federal agencies are requiring as a condition of obtaining federal construction contracts that all bidders must agree to use products measured in round metric units. This standard is known as ``hard-metric.'' This can require retooling, substantial capitalization costs, and other expensive production changes for some suppliers to physically change the size of the product. This ``hard-metric'' conversion requirement has sometimes been imposed without appropriate regard to whether the method is impractical or likely to cause significant costs or a loss of markets to United States firms. Some United States businesses that manufacture basic construction products suffer harm by being forced to convert to hard-metric production, or by being foreclosed from effectively bidding on federally financed projects. Hard-metric conversion requirements may place domestic producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign producers; may reduce the number of companies that may compete for contracts with the Federal Government; and may force manufactures to maintain double inventories of similar but incompatible products. The hard-metric conversion requirement has also unnecessarily raised the cost to the Federal Government of some lighting and concrete masonry products and there is a consensus that relief is in order for these industries. While the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 currently provides an exception to metric usage when impractical or when it will cause economic inefficiencies, there is a need for ombudsmen and procedures to ensure the effective implementation of this exception for afflicted industries. The changes made by this Act will advance the goals of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 while eliminating significant problems in its implementation. While estimates of savings vary, analysis of several projects indicates that hard metric conversion can cost 15-20% more to implement than ``soft metric'' conversion. Soft metric simply requires that building materials be measured in metric units instead of being manufactured in round metric dimensions. Legislative history H.R. 2779 was introduced by Congressman Cox on December 15, 1995, and referred to the Committee on Science. On May 16, 1996, the Subcommittee on Technology held a hearing entitled, ``Proposed Amendments to the Metric Conversion Act,'' to review H.R. 2779, the Savings in Construction Act. The witnesses discussed the need for flexibility in construction metrication by using ``soft metric'' versus ``hard metric'' measurements, especially where there are cases of adverse economic impact and barriers to competition. Witnesses testified regarding the need for the bill and their concerns with its implementation. Presenting testimony at the hearing were: the Honorable Christopher Cox (R-CA); Mr. William Fabbri, Vice-President and General Manager of Lightolier; Mr. Rod Lee, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Lithonia Lighting; Mr. Norbert Rappl, President of Comac Building Supply; Mr. Donald Emich, President of Binkley & Ober; Mr. Randall Pence, Director of Government Relations for the National Concrete and Masonry Association (NCMA); Mr. Mark Bohannon, Counsel for Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce; Mr. William Brenner, Director of the Construction Metrication Council; Mr. Tom Cunningham, Senior Project Manager at R.M. Schoemaker; Mr. David Wright, Vice President of United Masonry Inc. of Virginia; and Ms. Lorelle Young, President of the U.S. Metric Association. (See Committee Publication 104-50) The Subcommittee convened to mark up H.R. 2779 on June 19, 1996. An Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute was offered as the markup vehicle, which was adopted by voice vote. The amendment provides specific relief for the concrete masonry and lighting industries in the interpretation of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. In addition, it provides a mechanism, through the appointment of an ombudsman in each executive branch agency, for other afflicted industries to gain such relief in the future. Subsequently in Subcommittee, an amendment to the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute was offered, and adopted by voice vote, that clarified a definition in Section 3 of the bill with respect to hard versus soft metric. The Subcommittee passed H.R. 2779, as amended, by voice vote and ordered the bill reported, by voice vote, to the Full Committee for further consideration. The Full Committee met to mark up H.R. 2779 on June 26, 1996. The only amendment offered was a manager's amendment by Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Morella to make technical corrections. This amendment was adopted by voice vote. H.R. 2779, the Savings in Construction Act of 1996, was then passed, as amended, by voice vote, and ordered reported, by voice vote, to the Full House for consideration (House Report 104-639). On July 23, 1996, the House passed H.R. 2779 by voice vote. On July 24, 1996, the Senate received H.R. 2779 and referred it to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on July 29, 1996. It passed the Senate with an amendment on September 28, 1996. The House agreed to the Senate amendment under suspension of the rules on September 28, 1996, and presented it to the President on September 30, 1996. On October 11, 1996, the President signed H.R 2779 into law. (P.L. 104-289). Summary of the legislation and legislative history On March 29, 1996, Mr. LaTourette introduced H.R. 3217, the National Invasive Species Act of 1996. The bill amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to mandate: (1) regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species into the Great Lakes through ballast water; and (2) voluntary guidelines to prevent such introduction and spread in U.S. waters by ballast water and other vessel operations. The bill authorizes mandatory regulations if guideline compliance is inadequate; provides for enforcement through revocation of clearance and civil and criminal penalties; encourages negotiations with foreign governments to develop and implement an international program for preventing such introduction and spread in North American waters; and mandates studies of Lake Champlain, the Chesapeake Bay, San Francisco Bay, Honolulu Harbor, Prince William Sound, and other waters. H.R. 3217 also requires annual grants for six years for aquatic nuisance species prevention and control research in the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. It establishes a clearinghouse of national data on ballasting practices and compliance with guidelines under the bill, and mandates a ballast water management program for the Navy's seagoing fleet to limit the risk of invasion by nonindigenous species from ballast water. The bill further requires: (1) a ballast water management program to demonstrate technologies and practices to prevent aquatic nonindigenous species from being introduced into and spread through ballast water in U.S. waters; and (2) that the installation and construction of those technologies and practices be performed in a U.S. shipyard or ship repair facility. It also modifies: (1) the composition and research priorities of the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force; and (2) zebra mussel demonstration program requirements. The measure requires the Task Force to encourage (including through financial assistance) the development and use of regional coordination panels and similar entities in regions other than the Great Lakes; provides for interstate (in addition to existing State) aquatic nuisance species management plans, allowing Indian tribes as well as States to participate; and authorizes appropriations. The bill was referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and to the Committee on Resources. On September 12, 1996, the Transportation Committee ordered the bill reported (amended) by voice vote (Report No: 104-815 (Part I)). On September 20, 1996, the measure was sequentially referred to the Committee on Science. The Committee on Transportation agreed to changes recommended by the Committee on Science to ensure that: (1) authorization contained within the bill were consistent with authorizations passed by the House in H.R. 3322; (2) the measure did not earmark funds within the jurisdiction of the Science Committee to specific research institutions; and (3) all research funding authorized by the measure within the jurisdiction of the Science Committee is peer reviewed. On September 24, 1996, the Committee on Resources and the Committee on Science were discharged from further consideration of the bill; the measures was called up by the House under Suspension of Rules; and passed the House (amended--including Science Committee recommended changes) by voice vote. On September 25, 1996, the bill was received in the Senate and referred to Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. On September 28, 1996, Mr. LaTourette introduced H.R. 4283, the National Invasive Species Act of 1996. H.R. 4283 is the text of H.R. 3217 amended to take into account changes requested by the Senate. On September 28, 1996, H.R. 4283 was called up by the House by Unanimous Consent and passed the House by voice vote. On September 30, 1996, the bill was received in the Senate. On October 3, 1996, the Senate passed the bill by Unanimous Consent, and it was cleared for the White House. The President signed H.R. 4283 on October 26, 1996 (P.L. 104-332). Chapter II--Other Legislative Activities of the Committee on Science Background and summary of legislation The Risk Assessment and Cost/Benefit Analysis legislation was drafted in response to the need to develop clear and consistent guidelines on the conduct of risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for programs throughout the Federal Government which regulate and otherwise manage risks to human health, safety and the environment. The legislation seeks to ensure that these assessments and analyses are formulated using the best science available. The cost of regulation runs in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Federal regulatory costs are too often out of proportion to the problems that the regulations are designed to address, requiring expenditures of substantial economic resources on reductions in risk which are hypothetical. Federal risk assessment, characterization and communication has often been biased and based on a series of hypothetical assumptions which are designed to overstate the risks. In many contexts, federal agencies explicitly state that their risk assessment process is designed to produce estimates that ``err on the side of safety'' because of scientific uncertainties, and to ensure that the broadest range of the public is covered. It is generally believed that the ``upper bound estimates'' are highly improbable and differ from the most plausible level of risk by many orders of magnitude. Moreover, the practice of only calculating upper bound or worst case estimates of risk inappropriately collapses scientific findings with a preconceived policy judgment or bias. The perceived overstatement of risk is a serious concern among the regulated community. Many argue there should be ``best estimates'' or estimates of expected value in addition to upper-bound estimates to provide a more realistic benchmark. Some federal provisions require consideration of the costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives, although the specific language authorizing such consideration differs greatly among statutes. While these resulting regulatory decisions are judicially reviewable, the general standards of review is for courts to be deferential to federal agencies concerning the analysis of factual issues. Moreover, many federal statutes prohibit, or do not explicitly authorize, consideration of costs and benefits for determining regulatory requirements. The Reagan Administration issued Executive Order 12291 in order to encourage agencies to at least try to assess the costs and benefits of regulatory options where statutes did not otherwise compel such an assessment. As an executive order, the assessments were not judicially reviewable. The Clinton Administration has replaced Executive Order 12291 with Executive Order 12866 which, more or less, continues the requirements of 12291. Many advocate giving more prominence to the consideration of the relationship between costs and benefits and setting regulatory priorities to both save money and increase protection by focusing resources on the greatest risk reduction opportunities. Major purposes of the bill include: 1. To present the public and executive branch with the most scientifically objective and unbiased information concerning the nature and magnitude of health, safety, and environmental risks in order to provide for sound regulatory decisions and to educate federal, state and local decision makers and the public. 2. To provide for full consideration and relevant data and potential methodologies used to assess, communicate and characterize health, safety, and environmental risk. 3. To require an explanation of significant choices in the risk assessment process which will allow for better peer review and public understanding. 4. To improve consistency within the executive branch in preparing risk assessments and risk characterizations through, among other methods, further research in the risk assessment methodology. 5. To undertake for every major rule designed to protect health, safety and the environment an analysis of the costs and benefits of that regulatory action. 6. To establish a certification process by the head of each agency promulgating rules designed to protect health, safety and the environment that such regulations are based on objective and unbiased scientific and economic evaluation, and that the incremental risk reduction or other benefits will be likely to justify, and be reasonably related to, the incremental costs incurred by state, local, tribal governments, and the Federal Government and other public and private entities. 7. To establish a certification process that no regulatory or non-regulatory alternative considered by the agency, or proposed to the agency, would be more likely to achieve a substantially equivalent reduction in risk in a more cost- effective manner. 8. To establish an independent and external peer review program of risk assessments used to formulate those regulations. 9. To clarify that judicial review of this legislation shall be pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. To establish that for any risk assessment, risk characterization, cost benefit analysis, or peer review program, prepared by, or on behalf of, any federal agency, that the head of each agency shall prioritize threats to human health, safety and the environment according to the seriousness of the risk and to achieve the greatest reduction in risk, given the resources available to address those risks. Legislative history In the 103rd Congress, Chairman Walker was an original cosponsor of H.R. 2910, the Risk Communication Act of 1993, introduced by Representative Carlos Moorhead (R-CA) on August 6, 1993. In the 104th Congress, H.R. 2910 became Title III-- Risk Assessment and Cost Benefit Analysis for New Regulations introduced as part of H.R. 9, the ``Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995'' by Representatives Bill Archer (R- TX), Tom Delay (R-TX), Jim Saxton (R-NJ), Linda Smith (R-WA) and Billy Tauzin (R-LA), on January 4, 1995. Title III of H.R. 9 was referred to the Committee on Science, and to the Committees on Commerce and Government Reform and Oversight for those provisions under their jurisdiction. H.R. 9 was also referred to the Committees on Budget, Judiciary, Rules, Small Business, and Ways and Means for other titles and sections under their jurisdiction. On January 31, 1995, the Full Committee held the first of two hearings on Title III of H.R. 9. The first hearing focused on the views of the private sector and witnesses included: Dr. Jerry J. Jasinowski, President, National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), representing the Alliance for Reasonable Regulation; Dr. John Graham, Professor of Policy and Decision Sciences, Harvard Center for Risk Analysis; Mr. Gordon Garner, Executive Director, Louisville and Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District; Mr. Sam Kazman, General Counsel, Competitive Enterprise Institute; and Mr. Scott Holman, President/CEO, Bay Cast, Inc. Witnesses were supportive of the bill. On February 3, 1995, the Full Committee held the second hearing on Title III of H.R. 9. Testimony was received from Members of Congress, the Administration, and academia, regulatory and other public policy institutes and included: Congressman John Mica (R-FL); Congressman Dick Zimmer (R-NJ); the Honorable Jack Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the White House; Dr. Lynn Goldman, Assistant Administrator, Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Mr. Keith Collins, Acting Chief Economist, Department of Agriculture; Mr. William Schultz, Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Food and Drug Administration; Dr. Thomas A. Burke, Associate Professor of Health Policy and Management, John Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health; Dr. Paul R. Portney, Vice President, Resources for the Future; Mr. Thomas O. McGarity, University of Texas School of Law; Mr. Terry F. Yosie, Senior Vice President, E. Bruce Harrison Company; The Honorable Don Ritter, former Representative from the 15th district, Pennsylvania, Chairman, National Environmental Policy Institute; and Mr. Thorne Auchter, former Assistant Secretary of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. EPA Assistant Administrator Dr. Lynn Goldman testified that the Administration believes the bill would create delays and make government less efficient. The Full Committee met to mark up Title III of H.R. 9 on February 8, 1995. Chairman Walker offered an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute, which was adopted. The amendment incorporated suggestions made by witnesses at the hearings. After adopting twelve amendments to the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute, a quorum being present, the Full Committee approved Title III of H.R. 9, as amended, by voice vote, and ordered the bill reported. The Committee filed House Report 104-33 (Part II) on February 15, 1995. House Report 104-33 (Part I) was filed by the Commerce Committee, also on February 15, 1995. H.R. 1022, the Risk Assessment and Cost Benefit Act of 1995, was introduced by Chairman Walker on February 23, 1995. It was a compromise bill introduced following the filing of House reports by the Science and Commerce Committees. H.R. 1022 was referred to the Committee on Science, and to the Committees on Commerce and Government Reform and Oversight for those provisions under their jurisdiction. On February 24, 1995, the Rules Committee granted, by a recorded vote, Yeas--9, Nays--3, a modified open rule providing for two hours of debate and a ten hour time limit on amendments by adopting H. Res. 96 and reported it to the House. On February 27, 1995, the Committee on Rules discharged Committees of jurisdiction from further consideration of H.R. 1022. H.R. 1022 was called up by the House on February 27, 1996, and the House passed the rule. General debate and amendments were considered on February 27 and 28, 1995. On February 28, 1995, the House agreed to amendments adopted by the Committee of the Whole and defeated a motion to recommit, with instructions, by a recorded vote, Yeas--174, Nays--250. The House then passed H.R. 1022, amended, by a recorded vote, Yeas--286, Nays--141. Pursuant to the provisions of H. Res. 101, the House incorporated the text of this measure, as passed by the House, into H.R. 9. H.R. 9 was called up by the House by rule on March 3, 1995. At that time, the House struck all after Section 1 and inserted in lieu thereof the provisions of a text composed of 4 divisions: (1) H.R. 830; (2) H.R. 925; (3) H.R. 926; and (4) H.R. 1022, as each bill was passed by the House. A motion to recommit with instructions was defeated by a recorded vote, Yeas--180, Nays--239. The House passed H.R. 9, as amended, on March 3, 1995 by a recorded vote, Yeas--277, Nays--141. H.R. 9 was received in the Senate on March 9, 1995, and referred to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. The Senate took no formal action on H.R. 9. Provisions of H.R. 9 and H.R. 1022 were incorporated into H.R. 2586, to provide for a temporary increase in the public debt limit. H.R. 2586 was introduced by Representative Bill Archer on November 7, 1995, and referred to the Ways and Means Committee. The Ways and Means Committee held a markup on November 7, 1995, and ordered the bill reported, as amended. House Report 104-325 was filed by the Ways and Means Committee on November 7, 1995. On November 9, 1995, the House passed H. Res. 258, the rule under which H.R. 2586 was considered by a recorded vote, Yeas--220, Nays--200, and passed the bill, H.R. 2586, by a recorded vote, Yeas--227, Nays--194. Also on November 9, 1995, the Senate passed H.R. 2586, as amended, by a recorded vote, Yeas--49, Nays--47. On November 10, 1995, the House agreed to the Senate amendment, clearing the measure for the President by a recorded vote, Yeas--219, Nays--185. The President vetoed H.R. 2586 on November 10, 1995. Background and summary of legislation The National Sea Grant College Program Act was passed in 1966 to increase understanding of marine resources in order to improve their management, utilization and conservation. In 1970, Sea Grant was transferred from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to the newly-created National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The National Sea Grant College Program, one of two extramural ocean research programs within OAR, accounts for roughly 20 percent of OAR's annual expenditure. Authorization for the National Sea Grant College Program expired at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 1995. The Committee amended H.R. 1175, the Marine Resources Revitalization Act of 1995, to make it consistent with the provisions of H.R. 1815, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Act Authorization of 1995. H.R. 1815 was incorporated into H.R. 2405, the Omnibus Civilian Science Authorization Act of 1995. H.R. 1175, as amended by the Science Committee, amended Public Law 89-454 to provide for the reauthorization of the National Sea Grant College Program Act (33 U.S.C. 1121 et seq.) for FY 1996, terminated low-priority elements of the program, and made certain improvements to refocus the program on scientific research. The core Sea Grant Program was funded at $49 million in FY 1995. Of that total, $2.9 million was used for administration of the national program. An additional $1.5 million was appropriated for oyster disease research and $2.8 million for zebra mussel research, which is authorized under a separate statute. The Administration requested $49.4 million for the Sea Grant Program for FY 1996 and recommended no funding for the Sea Grant zebra mussel and oyster disease programs. Through amendments to H.R. 1175, the Committee refocused the Sea Grant program exclusively on scientific research and authorized $34.5 million for this purpose along with an additional $1.5 million for administration of the national program for FY 1996. H.R. 1175, as passed by the Science Committee, eliminated the Dean John Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship Program and the Sea Grant International Program. The bill refocused the Sea Grant program on scientific research by refocusing the definition of ``fields related to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources on science.'' The bill also banned the use of federal Sea Grant funds for lobbying activities, and restricted future funding for institutions which receive appropriations earmarks. Legislative history On February 21, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on NOAA's FY 1996 budget. Testifying on NOAA's budget before the Subcommittee was Dr. James Baker, Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, Department of Commerce, and Administrator of NOAA. Dr. Baker indicated the Administration's support for funding Sea Grant at $49 million for FY 1996. Mr. Young introduced H.R. 1175 on March 8, 1995. It was referred to the Committee on Resources and reported, as amended, on May 16, 1995. H.R. 1175 was then referred to the Committee on Science on May 17, 1995. The full Science Committee held a markup of H.R. 1175 on June 28, 1995, and adopted an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute offered by Mr. Walker to incorporate the Sea Grant-related provisions of H.R. 1815, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1995, into H.R. 1175. The substitute authorized appropriations of $36 million for FY 1996 for the National Sea Grant College Program. H.R. 1175, as amended, was ordered reported by voice vote to the full House for consideration. On July 11, 1995 the measure was reported to the House and placed on the Union Calendar. The provisions of H.R. 1175, as amended by the Committee on Science, were incorporated into Title IV of H.R. 2405, the Omnibus Civilian Science Authorization Act of 1995. H.R. 2405 passed the House on October 12, 1995. Prior to passage, the House adopted a Weldon (PA) amendment which increased the authorization level for the Sea Grant Program in H.R. 2405 from $36 million to $53 million for FY 1996. No other changes were made to the Sea Grant provisions of H.R. 2405. The Senate took no action on H.R. 2405 during the 104th Congress. Committee Publication Number 104-10 and H. Rept. 104-123 (Part II). Background and summary of legislation H.R. 1601 gives the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) the authority to proceed on its current, baseline International Space Station development plan, extending from Fiscal Year 1996 through assembly complete in Fiscal Year 2002. It authorizes a total of $13,141,000,000 not to exceed $2,121,000,000 in any one fiscal year. The authorization is conditioned upon each year's success, meaning NASA must stay on budget and on time for the legislation to remain effective. The Space Station program has been redesigned a number of times since its inception in 1984 as the Space Station Freedom program, and was first funded in the Fiscal Year 1985 budget cycle. In early 1993, President Clinton ordered NASA to redesign the Freedom program again, ultimately resulting in the Alpha design announced in September of that year. The cost of the Space Station has increased from $8 billion, as proposed in 1984, to $30 billion prior to the final redesign. Most of that nearly 4 to 1 cost growth can be attributed to redesigns and fiscal stretch-outs called for by actions taken by the Congress. The 1993 redesign was aimed at cost reduction while at the same time limiting the annual total to $2.1 billion. This along with a total authorization of $13,141,000,000 is a significant savings over earlier designs and projections. The redesigned Space Station will offer more laboratory space and more power than any of the previous designs. The President has spared the Space Station from NASA's significant budget cuts and touted it as the highest national priority in space today. Legislative history H.R. 1601 was introduced on May 10, 1995, by Chairman Robert S. Walker and Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. It was referred solely to the Committee on Science and its Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics. The Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics held a hearing on the overall budget of NASA on February 13, 1995, reviewing testimony from NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin. On March 16, 1995, the Subcommittee held another hearing that examined, in detail, NASA program budgets with testimony from non-agency witnesses including a Space Station panel. Witnesses on that panel included: Mr. Richard H. Kohrs, Director, Center for International Aerospace Cooperation; Mr. Norman R. Parmet, Chairman of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel; Dr. Hans Mark, Professor of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin; Dr. Maxime A. Faget, founder of Space Industries, Inc.; and Ms. Lori Garver, Executive Director of the National Space Society. During these hearings, witnesses expressed strong support for the Space Station program. In addition, the Subcommittee sponsored a NASA program review of the Space Station on February 16, 1995, for the benefit of Subcommittee Members and their staffs. On June 7, 1995, the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics completed its consideration of H.R. 1601, as amended, and reported it to the Full Committee for consideration. On June 28, 1995, the Full Committee approved H.R. 1601, as amended, by the Yeas and Nays: 34--8, and it was reported to the House (H. Rept. 104-210). On September 21, 1995, the Rules Committee adopted H. Res. 228, an open rule, and reported H.R. 1601 to the House. On September 27, 1995, the Rule passed the House. A Committee Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute was considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. On September 28, 1995 the House agreed to amendments adopted by the Committee of the Whole and H.R. 1601 passed the House, as amended, by voice vote. On October 10, 1995, H.R. 1601 was received in the Senate and referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The Senate took no formal action on this legislation, however the Space Station was authorized at the budget request level in Fiscal Year 1996 by S. 1048, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996. Background and summary of legislation The Department of Commerce was established on March 4, 1913.
