Returning to Columbia, he taught in the English department while getting his master’s from GSAS in 1950 in English and comparative literature and completing course requirements for a Ph.D. By then, he was teaching courses with field work in sociology and political science at the School of Engineering and writing science and mathematics texts for elementary and junior high school students. In 1955, the Engineering School asked him to oversee its efforts to spot promising elementary and secondary science students, including girls, and enlist them for advanced training at the school to help them rise to the college level. Joining the Engineering Dean’s Office, he developed the Science Honors Program, which garnered the attention and support of the National Science Foundation. Barr became assistant dean of the faculty of the Engineering School in 1959, and the foundation asked him to administer its entire Cooperative College-School Program. He did so beginning in 1963, continuing until he became headmaster at the Dalton School the following year.\n\nBarr, a traditionalist in academic matters, took a no-nonsense approach that rated good conduct as a virtue. He expressed his views on education not only at the schools he headed but also in national forums. His sometimes stormy tenure at Dalton ended in 1974 with his departure after disputes with the trustees over budget priorities and his disciplinarian approach to substance abuse. The next year, he became headmaster at Hackley School in Tarrytown, N.Y., where he soon dismissed more than two dozen students for disruptive conduct and poor academic performance. This time, he had parents and trustees in his corner. He also upgraded the curriculum, adding foreign languages and bolstering academic subjects and the arts.

He is survived by his sons, Christopher J. ’75, William P. ’71, Hilary B.T. ’74 and Stephen M. ’74; and eight grandchildren.\n\nFrancis Martin Jr., Reno, Nev., on December 23, 2003.

In 1996, he was named professor emeritus. Early in his academic career, Mohr studied and wrote about science. Across many years, readers of the San Juan Star will have seen his reviews of Puerto Rican and Caribbean literature and also his columns, which had a broad range: social, historical, and political topics; illogical government policies; nonsensical political positions; and the peculiarities of society. Long before the English department had the resources to begin its doctoral program in the “Language and Literature of the English-speaking Caribbean,” Mohr was eagerly researching and teaching in these fields.
