        "text": "The Worst Generation is a term referring to twelve infamous pirates who emerged immediately before the beginning of the Summit War of Marineford. They consist of the eleven super rookies present at the Sabaody Archipelago just before said war, and the then-Warlord Blackbeard, who gained the title following his victory over Ace during the Duel on Banaro Island.[2] They are notorious for the bold actions they committed against the World Government and have bounties of over 100,000,000.[1]\n\nAs most of the major conflicts that have occurred after the Summit War revolve around them, they are regarded as \"problem children\" who appeared between the end of the Golden Age of Pirates and the beginning of the New Age.[2]\n\nOverview[]\n\nBefore they became known as the \"Worst Generation\", the eleven Supernovas were the top rookie pirates from nine different crews who all chose one of the seven routes along the Grand Line. They are made up of captains of said crews, as well as two other crewmates, whose bounties are all above the threshold of 100,000,000. Each of them comes from one of all five seas— the East Blue, West Blue, South Blue, North Blue, the Grand Line itself and even the White Sea. A common trait they all possess is that they have caught the attention of the World Government and have survived many ordeals that have wiped out most other pirate crews during their voyage in the Grand Line. Though they are all on par with each other as far as threat level is concerned, they represent different views on piracy.\n\nWith the exception of the Straw Hat Pirates, most Supernovas attempted to avoid the paths of the World Nobles. Coincidentally, all the Supernovas arrived on the Sabaody Archipelago at the same time which caused a series of issues for the Marines. In addition, all of them, with the exception of the Straw Hat Pirates and the Heart Pirates, entered the New World almost simultaneously. Marshall D. Teach, on the other hand, was already in the New World by the time the rookies were making preparations.\n\nThe Supernovas are notable for posing the greatest threat to the balance of the Three Great Powers. Two of the Supernovas, Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar D. Water Law, were responsible for the defeat of three Warlords of the Sea (two by Luffy alone and one through the captains' cooperation), the Straw Hat Pirates have declared open war against the World Government (with Luffy in specific, successfully invading, attacking and escaping from all three of the World Government's main strongholds), and all of the Supernovas but Jewelry Bonney and Urouge have conspired against the Four Emperors. Luffy and Teach have usurped the positions of Emperors Kaidou and Whitebeard respectively, while Law and Eustass Kid additionally defeated Big Mom. According to Shakuyaku, one of the Supernovas could potentially be responsible for inspiring a whole new generation of pirates,[1] a comment that is made true when it was revealed that Luffy inspired Bartolomeo to become an infamous pirate in his own right. According to Morgans, he firmly believes that one of the members of the Worst Generation will become the next Pirate King.[3]\n\nOf the twelve pirates, all but two (Zoro and Killer) are captains of their respective pirate crews and only one (Zoro) is not a Devil Fruit user (Killer's fruit did not grant any powers, only robbed him of his abilities to swim and express negative feelings). The relationship between the pirate captains usually depends on the situation they happen to find each other in. This can range from casual talk to starting a fight. It seems all members carry a certain level of respect for each other due to their shared status, even if they happen to be fighting for different sides. In fact, most of them have formed pirate alliances to achieve a common goal, although there have been several cases of confrontations among members as well.\n\nMembers[]\n\nSee also the associated category: Worst Generation.\n\nMembers\n\nMonkey D.

The actions of Kid in the South Blue, Law in the North Blue, and Bege in the West Blue were well-known even in the Grand Line around five years ago.[41]\n\nIn the case of Bege, he became extremely infamous as a mafia leader who brought down rival gangs by solely killing their leaders, and later moved on to do the same thing as a pirate.[42] Kid and his partner Killer became extremely infamous for the large numbers of civilian casualties they caused during their expeditions.[43] Bonney also achieved infamy for attacking children and elderly civilians, although that was likely attributed to general ignorance of her abilities.\n\nLaw in particular joined the Donquixote Pirates when he was only 10, gaining prior experience as a result. After defecting from the crew, he would soon found the Heart Pirates. Drake too was part of a different pirate crew commanded by his father, Diez Barrels, but he was able to escape his influence and join the Marines at 19 years old. Drake later publicly defected from the organization to become a pirate, though in reality was operating undercover as the captain of the Secret Special Force SWORD.[44]\n\nEast Blue Saga[]\n\nTwo years ago, the young pirate from the East Blue, Monkey D. Luffy, began his own journey to find the One Piece and become the next Pirate King. The first person he recruited into his crew on his travels was Roronoa Zoro, the infamous bounty hunter who had his own dream to become the strongest swordsman in the world. After defeating Arlong and his crew, Luffy earned his first bounty and finally made a name for himself as a notorious pirate. Around this time, Jewelry Bonney also set out from the Sorbet Kingdom and attained a bounty and reputation of her own as well.\n\nAt some point after that, Marshall D. Teach, who had been a longtime member of the Whitebeard Pirates, defected to form his own crew following his murder of his crewmate Thatch, prompting his former commander, Portgas D. Ace to go after him in revenge. At some point, he attacked Drum Island, ironically liberating it from its tyrannical ruler, Wapol.\n\nArabasta and Sky Island Sagas[]\n\nUpon entering the Grand Line, Luffy and his crew came at odds with the criminal organization known as Baroque Works, who attempted to take over the Arabasta Kingdom. After defeating its leader and member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Crocodile, Luffy's bounty grew even higher than before, to a total of 100 million. Zoro also gained his first bounty for besting Crocodile's top henchman, Daz Bonez.\n\nThe Straw Hat crew then reached Jaya, where they encountered Teach and his crew, though they didn't fight. After a scuffle with Bellamy, Teach inspired Luffy to continue chasing his dreams. However, upon learning of Luffy's new bounty, he then decided to capture Luffy and present him to the World Government in order to join the Seven Warlords of the Sea, but was stopped by the Knock Up Stream destroying his raft.\n\nWater 7 Saga[]\n\nWhen the Straw Hats came to Water 7, they ended up fighting against CP9, who kidnapped their crewmate Nico Robin. After defeating them all and getting her back, all members of the crew had gained official bounties, with Luffy and Zoro's bounties increasing to well over 100 million, thus making them official Supernovas.\n\nMeanwhile, Ace finally catches up with Teach at Banaro Island and they duel it out, with Teach coming out as the victor. He then turned Ace in to the World Government and gained membership into the Seven Warlords.\n\nSummit War Saga[]\n\nSabaody Archipelago Arc[]\n\nAll of the Worst Generation's members (save for Teach) were present on the Sabaody Archipelago at the same time, and were noted by Shakuyaku for their distinction of being the only rookie pirates there with bounties over 100,000,000.[1] At first, they all did their best not to attract the attention of the Marines due to their Headquarters being so close to Sabaody, though Kid and Killer began brawling it out with Apoo and Urouge respectively. However, Luffy proceeded to unleash chaos by punching the World Noble Saint Charlos, causing Marine Admiral Kizaru and a large Marine platoon to be sent to retaliate.[45]\n\nLuffy, Law and Kid fought with the Marines outside the Human Auctioning House and then went their separate ways with their crews, promising to meet again in the New World. Afterwards, the Straw Hats fought and defeated a Pacifista, while Kid and Law fought together to defeat another one. Upon arriving, Kizaru encountered and battled Hawkins, Drake, Urouge, and Apoo, all of whom he defeated. Before he could capture or kill any of them, he was summoned to confront the Straw Hats.[46] Meanwhile, Bonney and Bege managed to defeat the Marines chasing them.\n\nKizaru was able to easily best the Straw Hat Pirates, but was intercepted by Gold Roger's first mate, Silvers Rayleigh before he could end them. Then the Warlord Bartholomew Kuma unexpectedly arrives and transports each of the Straw Hats off the island, including Luffy and Zoro.[47] The other Supernovas managed to shake off the Marines and escape from Sabaody.\n\nImpel Down Arc[]\n\nWith help from the Warlord, Boa Hancock, Luffy broke into the great prison of Impel Down to rescue his brother, Ace, from execution. Luffy's break-in caused great chaos, which enabled the Warlord, Blackbeard to invade the prison with his crew to recruit prisoners from the most dangerous level, Level 6, as part of his plot. During this, they both ended up meeting each-other again, where Luffy learned of the other's identity.\n\nMarineford Arc[]\n\nLuffy was unable to rescue Ace before the latter was taken to Marineford to be executed, but managed to escape from Impel Down with a horde of escaped prisoners and head to Marine Headquarters. There, with the assistance of the Whitebeard Pirates, Luffy succeeded in freeing Ace, though Ace was unfortunately killed by Marine Admiral Akainu, which resulted in Luffy suffering a mental breakdown. Soon after Ace's death, the Blackbeard Pirates arrived with the new members they had recruited from Level 6. Together, they killed Whitebeard and enabled Blackbeard to steal the deceased Emperor's ability through unknown means. As Blackbeard proceeded to unleash chaos on the battlefield, Luffy's allies worked to get him off Marineford. Fortunately for them, Law and his crew, the Heart Pirates, arrived in their submarine to take Luffy away. Once they did so, the Emperor Shanks arrived to put an end to the war, allowing the Marines, Blackbeard Pirates, Whitebeard Pirates and Heart Pirates to all retreat in peace.\n\nAll of the Supernovas that were not involved in the conflict, save for Zoro, watched the war from the video broadcast on Sabaody until the transmission was cut off,[48] at which point they traveled to Marineford and watched from afar on their ships.[49]\n\nPost-War Arc[]\n\nFollowing the great war, most of the Supernovas and their crews headed to the New World. The main exception was Law, who opted to wait a little longer. The Kid, Drake, and Hawkins Pirates began subjugating islands and other pirates they came across, while Apoo, Bege, and Urouge had encounters with the area's otherworldly forces of nature. Bonney and her crew ended up being captured by the Blackbeard Pirates, but Blackbeard was forced to leave her when a Marine battleship captained by Akainu arrived. Akainu proceeded to capture Bonney.\n\nAfter recovering from his wounds and mental breakdown, Luffy sent a message to his crew by ringing the Ox Bell on Marineford, telling them that they would reunite and head to the New World in two years.[50] He would then travel to Rusukaina to train with Rayleigh to utilize Haki while Zoro trained with Dracule Mihawk on Kuraigana Island.\n\nDuring the Timeskip[]\n\nAs Luffy and Zoro continued to train in their respective locations, all the other Supernovas became even more infamous in the New World.\n\nBlackbeard was considered the top candidate to replace Whitebeard among the Four Emperors following the latter's death, and he would do so in a year after conquering much of his old captain's territory and thoroughly defeating the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates in the Payback War.[51]\n\nAfter finally entering the New World, Law would make a name for himself primarily through his involvement in instigating the Rocky Port Incident.[52] He would then join the ranks of the Seven Warlords after sending 100 pirate hearts to Marine Headquarters as part of his master plan to bring down both the Warlord Donquixote Doflamingo and Kaidou of the Four Emperors.[53] Meanwhile, Bonney managed to escape capture by the Marines, and has appeared to lay low since then.[54]\n\nThe other Supernovas became involved with the Four Emperors in various manners. Kid and Killer launched attacks against both the Big Mom Pirates and Red Hair Pirates, with Kid losing one of his arms in a battle with the latter.[55] Bege, Apoo, and Urouge each invaded Big Mom's territory, and Bege joined the Big Mom Pirates while the other two were defeated.[56] Drake joined the Beasts Pirates after invading one of Kaidou's favorite islands,[57] and quickly rose up the ranks to become a member of the crew's Tobiroppo;[58] Apoo also secretly joined the Beasts Pirates as an informant.[59]\n\nDue to the actions of the Supernovas and Blackbeard in the timespan between the events of Sabaody and now, their group became recognized as the \"Worst Generation\".\n\nFish-Man Island Saga[]\n\nAfter two years had passed since the Summit War, Luffy and his crew were finally ready to reunite at Sabaoady as planned. Zoro was the first to arrive with help from Perona, while Luffy was the last to arrive with help from Hancock and her crew. After meeting again at the Thousand Sunny, they then resumed their journey to Fish-Man Island, where Luffy and Zoro demonstrated their new skills by defeating Hody Jones and Hyouzou, and then finally made it to the New World.\n\nDressrosa Saga[]\n\nPunk Hazard Arc[]\n\nShortly after arriving at the New World, they ended up on the quarantined island of Punk Hazard. Law was there as well at the time, working with the mad scientist Caesar Clown. Upon encountering the Straw Hats, Law proposed an alliance to Luffy with the intention of defeating Kaidou.[60] To do so, he plotted to destroy the production of Artificial Devil Fruits known as SMILE that the Warlord Donquixote Doflamingo was supplying Kaidou with. The first step was to stop the production of SAD, the main ingredient in these fruits which Caesar produced on Punk Hazard. Luffy agreed to this proposal, and Law gave him the directive to capture Caesar to use as a pawn against Doflamingo while he destroyed the SAD production. The new allies managed to succeed, despite encountering resistance from Donquixote Pirates officers Vergo and Monet whom had been stationed as operatives in the laboratory by Doflamingo, as well as dealing with the release of a new weapon of mass destruction by Caesar. Once Caesar was captured, Law contacted Doflamingo and gave him the ultimatum to step down from the Warlords if he wished to regain Caesar, his lone resource for producing SAD.[61]\n\nAt the same time those events were happening, the Kid Pirates, Hawkins Pirates, and On Air Pirates met to form an alliance for the purpose of defeating Shanks.[62] Although their meeting nearly ended in a quick failure, the trio were able to reach an agreement and their alliance was formed.[63][64]\n\nDressrosa Arc[]\n\nWith Doflamingo seemingly having obeyed Law's ultimatum by leaving the Warlords, the Straw Hat-Heart alliance headed to Dressrosa, with the intention of covertly infiltrating and destroying the SMILE production factory while Law met with Doflamingo to return Caesar to him. Their alliance and actions on Punk Hazard had attracted the attention of Marine Headquarters, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki sent Admiral Fujitora to address the situation. However, after reaching Dressrosa and meeting with Doflamingo to fulfill the deal, Law discovered that Doflamingo had never left the Warlords, having used his connections in the World Government to trick him and the entire public. Fujitora arrived to assist Doflamingo, and stripped Law of his Warlord title for allying with the Straw Hats. Law managed to keep Caesar out of Doflamingo's clutches by transporting him into the custody of a faction of the Straw Hats. They took him to Zou, while being pursued by Bege and the Big Mom Pirates, who also came to take custody of Caesar. In his ensuing battle with Doflamingo, Law stated that he had ended his alliance with the Straw Hats, revealing that his intention was not to take down Kaidou but rather to ensure the Emperor would kill Doflamingo, in order to take revenge on the Warlord for murdering his mentor Corazon.\n\nDoflamingo proceeded to defeat and capture Law, and Luffy and Zoro led an invasion on Doflamingo's palace to save their ally. Upon rescuing Law and finding out that he had ended their alliance, Luffy refused to accept its dissolution. Doflamingo used his strings to create a \"Birdcage\" cutting off all escape from Dressrosa, commissioning a reward on Luffy, Law, and their subordinates for anyone around them to capture them. However, Luffy, Law, and Zoro led a charge against the Donquixote Pirates with the aid of pirates and other warriors that Luffy had met in the Corrida Colosseum. After an arduous conflict, this band of allies managed to defeat Doflamingo and his crew, with a portion of them destroying the SMILE Factory in the process. This turn of events netted the Straw Hat-Heart alliance even greater infamy across the world, and Fujitora and the Marines were ordered to arrest them. However, with the help of the allies they had made, the alliance was able to escape from Dressrosa. Most of these allies would then go on to one-sidedly swear themselves to Luffy, thus forming the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.\n\nMeanwhile, Apoo had joined the Kid-Hawkins-On Air Alliance as an agent for Kaidou, and directed the Emperor to the three crews' meeting place. Upon arriving there from the sky, Kaidou pressed Kid and Hawkins' crews into his service. Hawkins willingly agreed, but Kid and Killer put up a fight. They were eventually defeated, with Kid and Killer being imprisoned in Wano Country. Killer was able to ensure his captain and crew's continued survival, by eating a failed SMILE and acting as an assassin for Kaidou's ally, Orochi, under the disguise of \"Kamazo the Manslayer\", while publicly known as a serial killer. Hawkins quickly rose to the position of Shinuchi in the Beasts Pirates.\n\nWhole Cake Island Saga[]\n\nZou Arc[]\n\nCapone Bege and his crew arrived on Zou with a contingent of Big Mom Pirates to capture Caesar and Sanji, who were there with a portion of the Straw Hats, in order to bring the latter to an arranged marriage with Big Mom's daughter Charlotte Pudding.\n\nTwo days later, the rest of the Straw Hat-Heart alliance arrived at Zou. There, they formed the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance with the forces of the Mink Tribe that resided there, as well as with a group of samurai serving the Kouzuki Family, whom they had worked with from Punk Hazard to Zou, in order to attack and bring down Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates, who were occupying the samurai's home of Wano Country.\n\nWhole Cake Island Arc[]\n\nLuffy took a portion of his crew, as well as a few allies, to Whole Cake Island in order to free Sanji from the Big Mom Pirates. At the same time, Bege was plotting an elaborate attempt to assassinate Big Mom during Sanji and Pudding's wedding ceremony. After Luffy's group reunited with Sanji, they met with the Fire Tank Pirates in the hopes of forming an alliance, as they wished to invade the wedding to rescue Sanji's family members from an assassination plot by Big Mom. The alliance infiltrated the wedding ceremony, and although they successfully freed Sanji's family, the attempt on Big Mom's life was a failure. However, the alliance was able to escape from the wedding venue through a stroke of sheer luck when the castle it was located atop of tipped over after an explosion.\n\nAlthough Bege and Luffy immediately ended their alliance following their escape, their crews proceeded to continue working together when Bege's wife, Chiffon assisted Sanji in making a wedding cake to satisfy Big Mom's murderous craving. As his crew worked to escape from Totto Land, Luffy fought and managed to defeat the powerful Sweet Commander Charlotte Katakuri. Bege became involved in getting the cake to Big Mom, and once the cake was brought to her, both the Straw Hats and Fire Tank Pirates managed to escape from Big Mom's territory.\n\nLevely Arc[]\n\nLuffy received the majority of the coverage on the affairs that occurred in Totto Land, with the news portraying him as effectively going toe-to-toe with Big Mom and handing her a defeat. As a result, his bounty increased by 1,000,000,000 and the media began referring to him as the \"Fifth Emperor\". Meanwhile, Bege's bounty increased by only 50,000,000.\n\nWhen the quadrennial Levely took place, Bonney donned the identity of Connie, the queen dowager of the Sorbet Kingdom, and infiltrated Mary Geoise for a currently unknown purpose.\n\nWano Country Saga[]\n\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\n\nOne Piece: Stampede[]\n\nTwo years ago, when Teach entered Level 6 and initiated his \"recruitment\", there was actually one more prisoner who passed. But seeing that it was Douglas Bullet, Teach decided to leave him alone while taking the rest with him.\n\nIn the present day, the crews of the Worst Generation (except the Blackbeard Pirates) all took part in the Pirates Festival. While the others prepared for the main event, Law infiltrated the Festival Pirates lair after sending his crew away, where he came close to the truth of the Festival, before being beaten by Douglas Bullet. After escaping and getting help from the Straw Hats, they discovered Buena Festa's secret plan.\n\nBack at the Festival the other pirates participated in the treasure race, however, after Buggy discovered the secret of the treasure, the event came to a sudden end, thanks to Bullet. Zoro went with the Straw Hats in order to escape, but ended up facing Issho, who came along with the fleet of Marine ships that was raiding Delta Island. Meanwhile, the remaining members of the Worst Generation fought Bullet, but were defeated after he revealed his Devil Fruit ability.\n\nLuffy later recovered, and stubbornly went after Bullet, teaming up with Law, Smoker, Boa Hancock, Buggy and Sabo, with Rob Lucci and Crocodile supporting them. Together, Luffy managed to defeat Bullet and claimed the treasure in the process, an Eternal Pose to Laugh Tale, which he promptly destroyed, claiming that he doesn't need it. He then joined his crew, where together with the Worst Generation, and with help of Sabo and Ann, escaped the Marine's encirclement of the island.\n\nConcludes non-canon section.\n\n\"Gang\" Bege's Oh My Family[]\n\nBege decided to look for Lola, on Chiffon's behest. On reaching Dressrosa, not only did they find her, but also the twins' father, Pound. As they escaped Dressrosa while being pursued by the Marines, Lola was married to Gotti on the Fire Tank Pirates' ship, much to Bege and his family and crew's joy.\n\nWano Country Arc[]\n\nAt Wano, Luffy's group reunited with their comrades and initiated preparations for an invasion against the Beasts Pirates on the day of the Fire Festival. However, the allies were not able to stay out of sight, and had run-ins and conflicts with Hawkins, now a Headliner of the Beasts Pirates, multiple times. Luffy clashed with Kaidou, after mistakenly thinking that the Emperor killed his crew, but was defeated and then jailed at the Udon Prisoner Mine, where he was put to slave work alongside Kid.\n\nWhile the allies prepared themselves for the upcoming fight, Drake and Hawkins were sent on various missions around the country, trying to uncover the enemy's plan. At one point, Zoro dueled against Killer, who was now under the name \"Kamazo\", when he was sent to kill a little girl on Orochi's order. Following his defeat, Killer was sent to the Prisoner Mine, where Luffy successfully engineered a prisoner's revolt against the wardens. Once the Beasts Pirates had been defeated, Kid and Killer set off on their own, having no desire to ally with pirates ever again. Meanwhile, Law clashed with Hawkins and was captured due to the latter holding his crew hostage, however, Drake later freed Law, allowing him to defeat Hawkins and reunite with the alliance. For the upcoming raid, Luffy was able to learn and train his advanced Busoshoku Haki while Zoro agreed with Kouzuki Hiyori's plea to return his Shusui in exchange for Enma, Kouzuki Oden's former sword. Also, during the events at Wano, Gecko Moria attacked the Blackbeard Pirates base, on Hachinosu, with Teach opting merely to talk with and offer Moria a chance to become his subordinate. Later, when the news of the Warlords' abolishment was released, Teach immediately set sail in order to claim something.[65]\n\nOn the day of the Fire Festival, the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance set sail for Onigashima to launch their assault. While battling a small Beasts Pirates fleet sent to stop them, the Kid Pirates joined them; though they had intended to attack the Beasts Pirates on their own, they ultimately ended up moving right alongside the other factions as reluctant allies. After infiltrating Onigashima, the alliance launched their assault, with Apoo joining the Beasts Pirates in their counterattack. During the fighting, Drake's status as an undercover agent was exposed by Queen, Who's Who, and Hawkins, forcing Drake to defect to the alliance's side after Luffy agreed to it. Together, Drake and Zoro teamed up against and eventually defeated Apoo, though the Longarm Tribesman soon rose again and persistently fought back. With Zoro deciding to head to where Kaidou was, Drake agreed to stay behind and hold off Apoo and other Beasts Pirates.\n\nDrake ended up chasing Apoo all the way to the Cave Chamber inside Kaidou's castle, where the Roar of the Sea offered the Red Flag an alliance to take out the winner of the war, though Drake refused and attacked him. Due to Yamato's sudden interruption, Apoo chased after him with Drake also in his pursuit. However, when two CP0 agents showed up in their path, Apoo antagonized them by taking their pictures. With the threat of their presence being exposed and being aware of Drake's identity, the agents attacked the pirates, who then reluctantly teamed up to face the World Government agents. The agents, however, came out victorious, with Drake lying down unconscious as Apoo fled from the battle.\n\nLuffy, Zoro, Kid, Killer, and Law eventually made it up to the roof of Kaidou's fortress, where they confronted Kaidou and Big Mom. As the battle commenced, it soon became clear that as long as the two Emperor's fought together, the younger pirates would eventually lose, as such, the Worst Generation pirates successfully pulled off a strategy to separate them, with Kid and Killer volunteering to pursue Linlin (which led to them meeting Hawkins in the way). Law and Zoro retreated downstairs to tend to their wounds, while Luffy stayed behind to fight Kaidou alone. Luffy eventually lost to Kaidou and was sent sinking into the sea, though he was fortunately picked up by the Heart Pirates, who were still in their submarine. Kid and Law decided to fight Big Mom together, while Killer and Hawkins faced each other.\n\nAs Killer fought Hawkins, the latter revealed that the last of his straw dolls was actually linked to Kid's life, leaving the Massacre Soldier unable to attack him. Taking advantage of this, Hawkins inflicted self-harm upon himself while redirecting all damage to Kid, however, Killer was able to cleverly circumvent this shield by cutting of Hawkins' left arm (which didn't affect Kid who no longer had said arm) and extracting his captain's doll before finishing off the Magician. Meanwhile, after being administered with a special drug from the Mink Tribe and recovering, Zoro faced King in battle. Eventually, Zoro became able to control Enma's unwieldy nature and, thanks to his newfound strength, was able to bypass King's defenses and cut him down.\n\nKid and Law used their last ounce of strength to face off against Big Mom, who held the upper hand for most of their battle. Through sheer determination, reluctant cooperation and clever use of their awakenings, the two captains managed to put Big Mom in a precarious position, with the intent of blasting her down into Wano's depths. Big Mom attempted one last ditch move in order to absorb their lifespan as well as their nearby crewmembers', but it ended up ineffective against the two, who went on to declare the end of her reign as she was finally launched off Onigashima to her defeat. This resulted in Kid and Law's crews celebrating their captain's seemingly impossible feat. Exhausted by the effort they put into finishing Big Mom off, Kid and Law deposited their hopes on Luffy to do the same to Kaidou.\n\nLuffy eventually made it back to the Skull Dome thanks to Momonosuke, where he once again fought Kaidou by himself. At one point, their fight was interrupted by Guernica of CPO (who Drake had failed to stop) restraining Luffy from completing his attack, thus aiding Kaidou in becoming victorious. However, though Luffy was thought dead by Kaidou and everyone else, his Devil Fruit then awakened. Dubbing his new form \"Gear 5\", Luffy used his newfound abilities to drag Kaidou back outside and engage him in a fourth and final battle. Eventually, Luffy managed to defeat Kaidou with his Gomu Gomu no Bajrang Gun, punching Kaidou deep under Wano into the same magma chamber Big Mom fell into.\n\nWith both Emperors defeated, the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance was victorious. Meanwhile, Hawkins and Drake, both in critical states, met up once more in the castle's basement, with Hawkins revealing to Drake some truths about his fortune-telling before collapsing. Seven days later, after Apoo let intel of the conflict leak outside Wano, Luffy, Law, and Kid all got issued enormous bounties of 3,000,000,000, with the former being recognized as a new Emperor of the Sea. Zoro was also granted a respectable increase to his bounty, with his head now being worth 1,111,000,000. Luffy and Law also had their alliance officially disbanded, having met their own original objective.\n\nAfter the Levely, with the release of the news that the World Government was abolishing the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Teach ordered his crew to set sail, planning to attack Amazon Lily to find and kill Boa Hancock and acquire from her the Mero Mero no Mi before the Marines could take it. Upon reaching Amazon Lily, Teach knocked aside the Marine ships and invaded the island with some of his subordinates, so the Marines sent S-Hawk to fight Teach and his crew. Teach managed to hold off the small Pacifista and capture Hancock after she had petrified most of the Marines and his crew. Koby tried to negotiate Hancock's release so she could restore those who had been petrified but Teach refused to trust Hancock. Before Teach could kill her though, Silvers Rayleigh arrived and intimidated Teach into sparing Hancock and leaving Amazon Lily, allowing everyone to be unpetrified.\n\nFinal Saga[]\n\nEgghead Arc[]\n\nDrake eventually left Wano and traveled to the Marine GS General Hospital so he could finish recovering from his injuries.[66]\n\nWhen the Kid Pirates arrived at their island of choice, Elbaf,[67] Shanks quickly defeated both Kid and Killer, while Dorry and Brogy destroyed the Victoria Punk, sinking the Kid Pirates.[68]\n\nFollowing the confrontation on Amazon Lily, the Blackbeard Pirates captured Koby. A few days later, they ambushed the Heart Pirates near Winner Island in an attempt to steal their Road Poneglyph copies. Teach and Law fought for a winner-take-all battle over the copies. As a result, the Heart Pirates were completely defeated in the ensuing battle and their pirate ship, Polar Tang, was destroyed. However, Law escaped from Blackbeard's grasps with the help from his remaining crew mate, Bepo by swimming to the ocean.\n\nAt some point post-Levely, Bonney received a new bounty on her head of 320,000,000 and headed to Egghead in order to confront Dr. Vegapunk, but the ship she was sailing on was destroyed by the Mecha-Shark. Fortunately for Bonney, she was rescued by Luffy while the Straw Hat Pirates approached the island, with both ending up at Egghead's shores. From there on, Luffy and Bonney decided to explore the island together with Chopper and Jinbe, eventually finding the original Dr. Vegapunk in a scrapyard. After getting to know the scientist, Luffy agreed to Vegapunk's request to be taken off the island.\n\nAfter CP0 began to invade Egghead, the Straw Hat Pirates and Bonney retreated into Vegapunk's laboratory, but not before Luffy had a tussle with his old enemy Rob Lucci, and easily won. Eventually, the Straw Hat Pirates captured the CP0 agents, but ended up having to work with them when one of Vegapunk's satellite's, York, went rogue. Meanwhile, Bonney remained resolute in going after Vegapunk for his work on her father, before eventually stumbling on Kuma's memory bubble using the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi.\n\nLater, the Straw Hat Pirates, Bonney, Vegapunk, and Lucci reunited, where York was subdued and contacted the Five Elders against her will. After coming up with an escape plan for the incoming Marine siege, Luffy and Bonney left the laboratory to assist in the moving of the Thousand Sunny, but because of Kizaru's interference, Bonney fell off the Labophase while Luffy took him on. Meanwhile, Lucci attempted to assassinate Vegapunk, but was stopped by Zoro, who went on to fight him outside the lab. While Luffy and Zoro fought their battles, Bonney evaded the Marines at the Fabriophase with the aid of Vegapunk and some of the Straw Hats.\n\nEventually, this group came face to face with Saint Jaygarcia Saturn. Luffy, who had managed to incapacitate Kizaru for the time being, fell down in exhaustion near this encounter. Saturn had managed to take ahold of Bonney and was ready to have her executed at the spot, but Kuma suddenly arrived at the island and protected her from Saturn. The group then attempted to escape with Kuma and Bonney, but thanks to Kizaru, they were placed in line of fire of the Pacifistas. Fortunately for them, Bonney was able to shift the fire to the Marines after learning that she had full authority over her father's clones. Kuma and Bonney were then carried away by Franky and Atlas to make their escape while a recovered Luffy hung back to deal with Saturn.\n\nBecause of Vegapunk's broadcast after his murder by Kizaru, the remaining Elders were all teleported to Egghead while the Giant Warrior Pirates arrived to assist Luffy and his crew escape. Escorted by Dorry and Brogy, Luffy made his way to the giants' ship while pursued by Topman Warcury and Shepherd Ju Peter as Bonney's group confronted Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro at the rendezvous point.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nEiichiro Oda drew ten of the Supernovas (excluding Zoro) after the two-year timeskip for a promotional poster.\n\nOda has admitted in an interview for Grand Countdown that the Supernovas introduced during the Sabaody Archipelago were a late minute addition to the series, born out of a feeling that the arc lacked interesting characters.
