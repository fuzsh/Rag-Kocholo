        "text": "The plural of fish is usually fish.\n\nWhen referring to more than one species of fish, especially in a scientific context, you can use fishes as the plural.\n\nThe zodiac sign Pisces is also often referred to as fishes.\n\nHere’s a tip: Want to make sure your writing shines? Grammarly can check your spelling and save you from grammar and punctuation mistakes. It even proofreads your text, so your work is extra polished wherever you write.\n\nYour writing, at its best\n\nGrammarly helps you communicate confidently\n\nOne of the most memorable quotes from the movie The Godfather is: “It’s a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.” In Mario Puzo’s novel The Godfather, which is the basis for the movie, that line is a bit different: “The fish means that Luca Brasi is sleeping on the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “It’s an old Sicilian message.” But the movie version brings up an interesting question—isn’t fish the plural of fish? And, therefore, isn’t fishes incorrect?\n\nWhen to use fish vs. fishes\n\nThe most common plural form of fish is indeed fish. However, under certain circumstances, you can use fishes as the plural form of fish. If you, for example, see two trout swimming together, you could say that you’re looking at fish. However, if the two trout were joined by a salmon, you could describe them as fish or fishes. Fish can refer to multiple fish, especially when they are all the same species of fish. Fishes, however, usually refers to multiple species of fish, especially in scientific contexts.\n\nOther uses of fishes\n\nThe Godfather quote is one famous example of the word fishes. Another is the zodiac sign of Pisces, which is sometimes referred to as fishes. You can also say that someone fishes as a hobby, but that’s just a form of the verb “to fish.” Finally, there’s the saying “if fishes were wishes, we’d all cast nets,” which is commonly attributed to Frank Herbert, author of the Dune series.\n\nExamples\n\nNew research suggests that fish can recognize human faces, putting to bed a previous theory that only animals with large brains, like primates, can accomplish such a complex task.\n\nCBC\n\nFurthermore, the Mediterranean diet, which includes plenty of fish, has been linked with a lower risk of depression and dementia.\n\nScientific American\n\nMore than 1,600 fish have died in a Somerset river polluted with slurry, the Environment Agency has said.\n\nBBC\n\nDeep-sea hatchetfishes and dragonfishes use light-producing organs called photophores on their bellies for camouflage; the photophore patterns on their bellies mimic light streaming down from the surface and render the fishes effectively invisible to predators that might be looking up.\n\nLiveScience\n\nElsewhere on the reef, small cleaner-fishes make their living by plucking parasites and algae from a variety of so-called client fishes who line up to wait their turn.\n\nThe New York Times"
