The 17th cent. English forms tanque and tanke appear to be taken from the Portuguese; tanck, tank, on the other hand, with Italian tancho (Varthema 1510), may have been from Gujarati tānkh. As to the English use in senses 1b, 2, it is not clear whether this came from Anglo-Indian usage, or was immediately related to Portuguese tanque. It could scarcely arise out of earlier English or Scots stank ‘pond, fish-pond, stagnant pool, ditch’, since this never in sense approached that of tank.\n\nMeaning & use\n\nQuotations\n\nHide all quotations\n\nContents\n\nEarlier version\n\ntank, n.¹ in OED Second Edition (1989)\n\n1.a.i.\n\nIn India, A pool or lake, or an artificial reservoir or cistern, used for purposes of irrigation, and as a storage-place for drinking-water.\n\nTancks or couered ponds of water, fild by the beneficiall raines, for the vse and drink of Trauellers.\n\nT.
