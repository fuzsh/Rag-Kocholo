Dating Information

For the purposes of dating various releases, the following information should be noted:

1) Tower Records label text:

In 1967, the text at the bottom of Tower Record labels read: "Mfd. in U.S.A."

This changed in approximately July 1968 to read: "Mfd. by Capitol Records, Inc, a subsidiary of Capitol Industries, Inc. U.S.A."

2) West Coast / East Coast issues:

In the 1960s, Tower Records used multiple pressing plants for the production of records. Rainbo Records in Los Angeles pressed Tower records for distribution to outlets in the western part of the United States. These are referred to as West Coast issues. Capital Records in Scranton, Pennsylvania pressed Tower records for distribution to outlets in the eastern part of the United States. These are referred to as East Coast issues. Both plants pressed records simultaneously so they are both considered first issues.

3) Harvest Records label text:

In the early 1970s, the text around the bottom edge of Harvest Records labels started at the 8 o'clock position and read: "Mfd. by Capitol Records, Inc., a subsidiary of Capitol Industries, Inc., U.S.A. - R Capitol Marca Reg - U.S. Pat. No. 2,631,859."

This changed in approximately 1974-1975, when it started at the 10 o'clock position and read: "Mfd. by Capitol Records, Inc., a subsidiary of Capitol Industries-EMI, Inc., U.S.A. - Capitol Marca Reg. - All rights reserved. Unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws."

4) Capitol Records Starline reissues:

In November 1981, Capitol Records began issuing singles on the Starline label. These issues had the catalog numbers changed to a 6000 number. The first Capitol Starline issues were on a blue Starline label.

The second series of Capitol Starline releases had the catalog numbers prefixed by an A.

The third series of Capitol Starline releases had the catalog number prefixed by an X.

In July 1983, Capitol Starline releases were issued with a black label with a rainbow ring around the edge.

In the summer of 1988, Capitol Starline releases were issued with a solid purple label.
