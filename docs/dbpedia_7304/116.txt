I USE GOLDMINE RECORDS AS A GUIDE FOR GRADING:

Still Sealed - SS

Mint - M - Perfect, never played, possibly still sealed.

Near Mint - NM - Nearly perfect. No obvious signs of wear, no more than the most minor defects, such as almost invisible ring wear, or other signs of slight handling. LP Jacket should have no creases, folds, seam splits, or cut-out holes.

Very Good Plus - VG+ or Excellent- Shows some signs that it was played, and handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. May show slight signs of wear, scuffs, or very light scratches that didn't affect the listening. Slight warps that do not affect the sound. Label may have some ring wear, or discoloration. Picture sleeves & LP inner sleeves may have slight ring wear,lightly turned-up corners, or a slight seam split. Jacket may have slight signs of wear, and may have a cut-hole.

Very Good -VG - Same as VG+, and may have surface noise, groove wear will be noticeable, and scratches that affect the sound. Labels may have writing, tape, or stickers.

Good Plus - G+ -Good - G- Will play without skipping and have significant surface noise, visible scratches, and groove wear. Jacket will have seam splits at the bottom, or the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear, or other defects.

I will grade all records honestly, and to the best of my ability. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. If you are not satisfied with a purchase please email me first to work it out before leaving negative feedback. Thank you so much.
