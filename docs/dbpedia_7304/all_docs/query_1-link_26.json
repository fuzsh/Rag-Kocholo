        "text": "Echoes - The Best Of Pink Floyd\n\nSeptember 29th, 2001\n\nIt all started in 1966, amid the psychedelic explosion then sweeping swinging London. In small, smoky clubs like the UFO and the Roadhouse, Syd Barrett, Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Rick Wright and David Gilmour galvanized the vibrant British rock scene with their extended free-form instrumentals and surreal pop songs -- all performed to the accompaniment of bobbing blobs of multi-colored liquid lights. Perhaps even more than Cream and Jimi Hendrix, the quartet known as Pink Floyd were psychedelia personified.\n\nTwenty-two albums later, 160 million in records sales and sold out tours to an estimated 25 million fans, Pink Floyd are arguable the greatest rock band of all time. No other band has relentlessly tinkered with electronics and all manner of special effects to push pop formats to their outer limits. At the same time they have wrestled with lyrical themes and concepts of such massive scale that their music has taken on an almost classical, operatic quality, in both sound and words.\n\nFrom the classic concept albums of 'Dark Side Of The Moon' and 'Wish You Were Here' to the progressive cult favorite, 'The Wall' (3rd best selling album of all time), Pink Floyd's lyrics made icons out of LSD, pigs, Power stations and brick walls while their music riddled with secret messages and wild imagery, reached mythic proportions.\n\nNow, Capitol Records is proud to release 'Echoes - The Best Of Pink Floyd' on November 6th, which under the band's active participation, is the first and only compilation to span the bands entire 35-year career.
