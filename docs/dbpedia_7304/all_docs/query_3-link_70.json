Fisher Theatre.\n\nYou will be blown away by this limited dark room 5.1 surround-sound music experience in Sedona’s best sound system, the Mary D. Fisher Theatre. This is a no-visuals sonic experience, reminiscent of the lost art of listening to music in the dark with the most amazing surround-sound 5.1 music this side of the solar system.\n\nThe recording is presented by Mraz, who received the Discus Award, 5.1 Category in 2001 Communicator Surround Award in 2002; Aurora Surround Award in 2005 and was a 2005 Grammy nominee for surround sound. A college professor at Citrus College, Glendale, and Pasadena College, both in California, Mraz taught classes in music production, audio engineering and broadcast technology for over 15 years.\n\nHe offers educational presentations via the Fair Use Doctrine of the U.S. Copyright Statute. Under the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is permissible to use portions of a copywritten work for purposes such as commentary, criticism and education.\n\nThe program is limited to a maximum seating of 40 for each night.\n\nTickets are $20. For tickets and more information, call (928) 282-1177. Both the theatre and film festival office are located at 2030 W. SR 89A in West Sedona. For more information, visitSedonaFilmFestival.org."
