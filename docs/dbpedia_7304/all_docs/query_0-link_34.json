        "text": "To mark the rerelease of 14 Pink Floyd studio albums, a 30-foot inflatable pig was flown on Monday over London’s Battersea Power station, replicating an image made famous as the cover to the 1977 album Animals.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, organizers used a replica of the original vinyl pig, which has been in storage for 35 years but was discovered to be leaky. During the original photo shoot, the pig broke free and floated into the flight path for Heathrow Airport. It was later found in a farmer’s field.\n\nAnother pig is hovering over the iconic Capitol Records building in Los Angeles.\n\nUnder the banner Why Pink Floyd?, EMI begins a marketing blitz today that will roll out additional DVDs, Blu-Ray discs, SACDs, iPhone apps and a new single-album Best Of collection.\n\nIn addition to reissuing classic albums, the label is also making available full “experience editions,” offering diehard fans the opportunity to immerse themselves in a deeper way with additional related content.\n\nStorm Thorgerson, the band’s longtime art director, supervised the visual design for the project, which includes new booklets and DVD menus, while archivist Lana Topham oversaw the restoration of many films.\n\nSee below for additional releases\n\nSeptember 26, 2011\n\n• The Dark Side of the Moon: 6-disc “immersion” box set and 2-disc “experience” versions, vinyl LP, digital editions\n\n• 14 studio albums digitally remastered, available as single purchases or box set\n\nNovember 6, 2011\n\n• Wish You Were Here 5-disc “immersion” box set and 2-disc “experience” version with bonus material from the band’s 1974 Wembley concert (including a 20-minute version of “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”), vinyl LP, digital editions\n\n• A Foot In The Door: The Best of Pink Floyd album\n\nFebruary 27, 2012\n\n• The Wall: “immersion” and “experience” editions, vinyl LP, digital release"
