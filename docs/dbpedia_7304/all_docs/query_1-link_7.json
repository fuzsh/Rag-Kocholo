        "text": "Pink Floyd\n\nUnited States\n\nVinyl Singles Discography\n\nby Vernon Fitch\n\n© copyright Vernon Fitch / The Pink Floyd Archives\n\nThis is a discography of 7 inch vinyl singles that have been released in the United States by Pink Floyd.\n\nAny comments, corrections or additions to this discography are appreciated.\n\nDating Information\n\nFor the purposes of dating various releases, the following information should be noted:\n\n1) Tower Records label text:\n\nIn 1967, the text at the bottom of Tower Record labels read: \"Mfd. in U.S.A.\"\n\nThis changed in approximately July 1968 to read: \"Mfd. by Capitol Records, Inc, a subsidiary of Capitol Industries, Inc. U.S.A.\"\n\n2) West Coast / East Coast issues:\n\nIn the 1960s, Tower Records used multiple pressing plants for the production of records. Rainbo Records in Los Angeles pressed Tower records for distribution to outlets in the western part of the United States. These are referred to as West Coast issues. Capital Records in Scranton, Pennsylvania pressed Tower records for distribution to outlets in the eastern part of the United States. These are referred to as East Coast issues. Both plants pressed records simultaneously so they are both considered first issues.\n\n3) Harvest Records label text:\n\nIn the early 1970s, the text around the bottom edge of Harvest Records labels started at the 8 o'clock position and read: \"Mfd. by Capitol Records, Inc., a subsidiary of Capitol Industries, Inc., U.S.A. - R Capitol Marca Reg - U.S. Pat. No. 2,631,859.\"\n\nThis changed in approximately 1974-1975, when it started at the 10 o'clock position and read: \"Mfd. by Capitol Records, Inc., a subsidiary of Capitol Industries-EMI, Inc., U.S.A. - Capitol Marca Reg. - All rights reserved. Unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws.\"\n\n4) Capitol Records Starline reissues:\n\nIn November 1981, Capitol Records began issuing singles on the Starline label. These issues had the catalog numbers changed to a 6000 number. The first Capitol Starline issues were on a blue Starline label.\n\nThe second series of Capitol Starline releases had the catalog numbers prefixed by an A.\n\nThe third series of Capitol Starline releases had the catalog number prefixed by an X.\n\nIn July 1983, Capitol Starline releases were issued with a black label with a rainbow ring around the edge.\n\nIn the summer of 1988, Capitol Starline releases were issued with a solid purple label.\n\nQuick Click Guide\n\n[Pink Floyd]\n\n[The Pink Floyd Discographies Page]\n\n[Reference Directory] [Pink Floyd Archives home page]\n\nSingles\n\nPink Floyd\n\nArnold Layne / Candy and a Currant Bun\n\nTower Records West Coast issue Tower Records East Coast issue\n\nSee Emily Play / The Scarecrow\n\nTower Records West Coast issue Tower Records East Coast issue\n\nFlaming / The Gnome\n\nTower Records West Coast issue Tower Records East Coast issue\n\nIt Would Be So Nice / Julia Dream See Emily Play / The Scarecrow (Tower Records promo reissue) Let There Be More Light / Remember a Day Zabriskie Point - Controversy Radio Spots (MGM promo) One of These Days / Fearless\n\nCapitol Records promo issue Capitol Records issue\n\nFree Four / Stay\n\nCapitol Records promo issue Capitol Records issue\n\nMoney (mono) / Money (stereo)\n\nHarvest Records promo #1 Harvest Records promo #2\n\nMoney / Any Colour You Like\n\nHarvest Records 1st issue Harvest Records 2nd issue Harvest Records 3rd issue Harvest Records 4th issue Capitol Records / Starline 5th issue Capitol Records / Starline 6th issue Capitol Records / Starline 7th issue Capitol Records / Starline 8th issue Capitol Records / Starline 9th issue Capitol Records / Starline 10th issue\n\nTime / Breathe / Us & Them / Money (Harvest Records promo EP) Us & Them (mono) / Us & Them (stereo) Us & Them / Time\n\nHarvest Records 1st issue Harvest Records 2nd issue\n\n\"Pink Floyd\" - Original Radio Spot Announcements / Revised Radio Spot Announcements Stamping Ground radio spots\n\nAtlas Films issue Fine Films issue\n\nHave a Cigar (mono) / Have a Cigar (stereo) (Columbia Records promo) Have a Cigar / Welcome to the Machine Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) / Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)\n\nColumbia Records promo #1 Columbia Records promo #2\n\nAnother Brick in the Wall (Part II) / One of My Turns\n\nColumbia Records 1st issue Columbia Records 2nd issue Columbia Records 3rd issue Columbia Records 4th issue Columbia Records 5th issue Columbia Records-Hall of Fame 6th issue Columbia Records-Collectables 7th issue\n\nRun Like Hell / Run Like Hell (Columbia Records promo) Run Like Hell / Don't Leave Me Now Comfortably Numb (short version) / Comfortably Numb (long version)\n\nColumbia Records promo #1 Columbia Records promo #2\n\nComfortably Numb / Hey You Run Like Hell / Comfortably Numb\n\nColumbia Records 1st issue Columbia Records 2nd issue Columbia Records Hall of Fame 3rd issue Columbia Records 4th issue Columbia Records Collectables 5th issue\n\nWhen the Tigers Broke Free / When the Tigers Broke Free (Columbia Records promo) When the Tigers Broke Free / Bring the Boys Back Home\n\nColumbia Records 1st issue Columbia Records 2nd issue\n\nNot Now John (obscured version) / Not Now John (obscured version)\n\nColumbia Records promo #1 Columbia Records promo #2\n\nNot Now John (obscured version) / The Hero's Return-Parts I and II Learning to Fly (edit) / Learning to Fly (edit) (Columbia Records promo) Learning to Fly (edit) / Terminal Frost On the Turning Away / On the Turning Away (Columbia Records promo) On the Turning Away / Run Like Hell (live version) Take It Back / Astronomy Domine (live) Money (edit) / Time (edit) (jukebox single) Wish You Were Here / Have a Cigar (jukebox single) Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) (live) / Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) (live) (promo single) Pink Floyd-The Wall Singles Box Set (2011 Record Store Day box set) See Emily Play / The Scarecrow (2013 Record Store Day single) Arnold Layne / - (2020 Record Store Day single) Hey Hey Rise Up / A Great Day for Freedom\n\nPink Floyd\n\nArnold Layne title sleeve\n\n(West Coast issue)\n\nSongs: Arnold Layne / Candy and a Currant Bun (West Coast issue)\n\nPicture/Title Sleeve: Title sleeve.\n\nRecord Company: Tower Records\n\nCatalog Number: Tower 333\n\nMatrix Information: (side 1 / side 2)\n\n1) X-61273 T-333 R-953 / X-61274 T-333 R-954 (both written)\n\nPressing Plant: Rainbo Records, Los Angeles, California\n\nRelease Date: April 24, 1967 (A promo copy was found with a date-received stamp of \"APR 29 REC\" put on the PS by a radio station.)\n\nRelease Information: Issued both with, and without, a title sleeve.
