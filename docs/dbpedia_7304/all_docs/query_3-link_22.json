        "text": "WELCOME TO THE 25th YEAR OF BRAIN DAMAGE, YOUR PINK FLOYD, NICK MASON, DAVID GILMOUR AND ROGER WATERS NEWS RESOURCE!\n\nLast year was busy, with things such as the deluxe box set marking the 50th anniversary of The Dark Side Of The Moon, with a new remaster of the album, coupled with a number of other things including books and the Wembley 1974 TDSOTM recording. Some of the elements (including the official book) have also been released separately - full details here. There's also the extremely lovely limited edition, UV printed crystal clear 2LP vinyl edition of TDSOTM...\n\nA long hoped for reissue of Richard Wright's Wet Dream, remixed by Steven Wilson with a new stereo AND surround mix, is out now, and absolutely superb, really bringing a forgotten gem back to life and it sounds better than ever. Also, the Atmos mix of Pink Floyd's Animals is now out and sounds incredible!\n\nSadly, the European dates for the Nick Mason's Saucerful Of Secrets 2024 Set The Controls tour have come to their end. The gigs revealed a band in even better form than the 2022/23 shows which managed to exceed everyone's hopes and expectations! Our sincerest hopes are that they continue. Don't forget that there's the live recording from London's Roundhouse on Blu-ray, DVD/2CD, and 2LP which is really excellent.\n\nDavid Gilmour's new album, Luck and Strange, has now been announced and is being released on September 6th in a variety of formats, and a selection of coloured vinyls. A limited number of concert dates have also been announced - see all the confirmed David Gilmour concert dates here!\n\nFinally, Roger Waters read three extracts from his memoirs in October 2023 at the London Palladium, so it might not be too long before that is published...he's also working on his new album based around The Bar - we'll let you know as soon as we get all the info!\n\nHOW TO HELP THE SITE: If you want to contribute anything - such as concert reviews, articles or pictures - we'd love to hear from you; please email us.\n\nA sincere note of thanks to those who use our affiliate links to Ticketmaster.com, Ticketmaster.co.uk, Seetickets.com, Eventim UK, the various Amazon stores (as an Amazon Associate we earn commission from qualifying purchases); iTunes; Zavvi.com; HMV.com; and to those kind souls who make a Paypal donation toward running costs.\n\nAll these give much-needed help with things such as site hosting fees, and we really appreciate it.
