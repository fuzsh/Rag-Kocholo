        "text": "Since the beginning of humanity, sound has been one of the most important instruments for communication. For much of history, music was an ideal method of telling stories and sharing info about news and important feats. Today, music continues to be one of the most used mediums for discussing many topics, including the law and the legal profession.\n\nLawyers, judges, and courtrooms often capture the attention of audiences. The world of law has been reflected endlessly in entertainment media. The legal industry serves as an inspiration for great works of art and culture, including books, theater, paintings, movies, television, and even comics. Each of these works offers a unique perspective on society’s perception of what happens in the life of a lawyer, examination of a witness, or trial in court.\n\nMusic is no exception in the entertainment world. It offers commentary on many aspects of life, including the law. Further, music is one of the most personal creative mediums for many artists and listeners alike. In each note and phrase, we can find feelings, emotions, and even personal anecdotes that the artist seeks to share with the listener. In turn, music often generates a unique connection for the listener.\n\nThe legal world has inspired artists across various genres to create unforgettable songs about the law that tell great stories of lawyers, judges, trials, witnesses, and courts.

However, music is without a doubt a great companion, wherever you are: commuting, at home, or in the office.\n\nMaybe these songs will help you get inspiration, relax, or concentrate on that pleading you have to file. Maybe one of these tracks will appear in your next lawyer commercial. Or maybe these sounds will just be pure entertainment for you. Regardless, it is always nice to see that out of all of the things an artist could write/sing about, people out there think your profession is worth it."
