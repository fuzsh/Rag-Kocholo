        "text": "by Vernon Fitch\n\n© copyright Vernon Fitch / The Pink Floyd Archives\n\nTower Records was a subsidiary of Capitol Records in the United States that released Pink Floyd records between the years 1967 and 1969. There were a total of twenty seven different Pink Floyd records released on Tower Records (this figure is based on alternate label variations. If you count cover variations, there are more).\n\nThe following is a discography of all the Tower Records releases. Any comments, corrections or additions to this discography are appreciated.\n\nRelease and Dating Information\n\nAlbum Label Variations: There are a number of distinct Tower Records album labels.\n\nIn 1967 and 1968, Tower albums were issued on a brown Tower Records label.\n\nSometime in 1969, prior to the release of the album, More, album labels were changed to a striped Tower label, with with alternate strips of blue, green, purple and orange.\n\nThere are numerous variations of both the brown Tower labels and the striped Tower labels, with the song titles, composer and ASCAP credits differing between the issues (see the label descriptions in the discography for the differences). Counterfeit Tower Singles: The use of basic black print for the Tower picture sleeves and labels have made the Tower singles very susceptible to counterfeiting. This is particularily true for the singles with white Tower promotional labels. It is known that the Arnold Layne and See Emily Play white promotional label singles and sleeves have been counterfeited. However, it can be very difficult to spot a counterfeit. Specific information about known counterfeit pressings has been added to this discography where appropriate. Cover Slick Numbers: On most of the first three Pink Floyd albums, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, and More, a very small number can be found at the bottom of the back cover in the lower right corner. These numbers are the \"designated numbers\" for the particular album slick, and indicate which printer was used by the record company to print that specific album cover slick.\n\nA cover with no number on it can be assumed to indicate the original printer used by Capitol Records, as there are no issues with a number 1 on them. Known numbers 2 through 21 indicate that different printing factories were used. It is unknown which printers belong to each number. However, of the three Capitol Records pressing plants operating in the United States at the time, cover numbers 2 and 3 are usually found with pressings from the Scranton, Pennsylvania record plant, number 4 is usually found on pressings from the Jacksonville, Illinois record plant, and numbers 5 and 6 are usually found with pressings from the Los Angeles, California record plant.\n\nKeep in mind that these \"designation numbers\" do not indicate order of release. Many cover slick printing factories were used simultaneously, and it is possible that any pressing could be put with any record cover number depending on the record company's inventory at the time.\n\nThe covers numbers indicated in this discography are only numbers that have been verified for a particular pressing. It is more than likely that other cover numbers will be found for those same pressings. Label text:\n\nIn 1967 and early 1968, the text at the bottom edge of Tower Record labels read:\n\n\"Mfd. in U.S.A.\"\n\nIn August 1968, the text on Tower labels was changed to read:\n\n\"Manufactured in the U.S.A. by Capitol Records, Inc.\"\n\nIn approximately mid-1969, the text on Tower labels was changed to read:\n\n\"Mfd. by Capitol Records, Inc, a subsidiary of Capitol Industries, Inc. U.S.A.\"Matrix Information: Matrix information is the letters and numbers etched into the vinyl near the label in the runoff groove at the end of each side of a record.\n\nMatrix information may show:\n\nCatalog number.\n\nLacquer number.\n\nRecord pressing plant.\n\nThe engineer who cut the lacquer.\n\nThe matrix information listed in this discography are not intended to be complete listings. They are known matrix numbers only. Record Pressing Plants: When the first Pink Floyd records were issued in the United States in 1967, Capitol Records were pressing records in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in Los Angeles, California, and in Jacksonville, Illinois.\n\nThe particular plant that was used to press a certain album is indicated by the following symbols in the matrix of the record:\n\nA machine stamped triangle with the initials IAM indicates that the record was pressed at the Scranton, Pennsylvania plant.\n\nA star (*) indicates that the record was pressed at the Los Angeles, California plant.\n\nAn 0, either stamped or hand written, indicates that the record was pressed at the Jacksonville, Illinois plant.\n\nQuick Click Guide\n\n[Albums] [Singles] [Samplers] [8 track tapes] [Cassettes]\n\n[The Pink Floyd Discographies Page]\n\n[Reference Directory] [Pink Floyd Archives home page]\n\nTower Releases\n\nSingles\n\nArnold Layne / Candy and a Currant Bun\n\nTower Records West Coast issue Tower Records East Coast issue\n\nSee Emily Play / The Scarecrow\n\nTower Records West Coast issue Tower Records East Coast issue\n\nFlaming / The Gnome\n\nTower Records West Coast issue Tower Records East Coast issue\n\nIt Would Be So Nice / Julia Dream See Emily Play / The Scarecrow (Tower Records promo reissue) Let There Be More Light / Remember a Day\n\nAlbums\n\nPink Floyd (aka Piper at the Gates of Dawn)\n\nTower Records 1st issue\n\nWest Coast mono 1st issue West Coast stereo 1st issue East Coast mono 1st issue East Coast stereo 1st issue\n\nTower Records 2nd issue Tower Records 3rd issue Tower Records 4th issue\n\nA Saucerful of Secrets\n\nTower Records 1st issue\n\nTower Records West Coast 1st issue Tower Records East Coast 1st issue\n\nTower Records 2nd issue\n\nTower Records West Coast 2nd issue Tower Records East Coast 2nd issue\n\nTower Records 3rd issue Tower Records 4th issue (Record Club)\n\nMore\n\nTower Records 1st issue\n\nTower Records West Coast issue promo Tower Records West Coast issue Tower Records East Coast issue\n\nTower Records 2nd issue Tower Records 3rd issue\n\nSamplers\n\nTower Demonstration Album for September Underground (1st issue) Underground (2nd issue)\n\nCassettes\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn A Saucerful of Secrets More Underground Sampler\n\n8 Track Tapes\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn A Saucerful of Secrets More Underground Sampler\n\nTower Records Singles\n\nArnold Layne title sleeve\n\n(West Coast issue)\n\nSongs: Arnold Layne / Candy and a Currant Bun (West Coast issue)\n\nPicture/Title Sleeve: Title sleeve.\n\nRecord Company: Tower Records\n\nCatalog Number: Tower 333\n\nMatrix Information: (side 1 / side 2)\n\n1) X-61273 T-333 R-953 / X-61274 T-333 R-954 (both written)\n\nPressing Plant: Rainbo Records, Los Angeles, California\n\nRelease Date: April 24, 1967 (A promo copy was found with a date-received stamp of \"APR 29 REC\" put on the PS by a radio station.)\n\nRelease Information: Issued both with, and without, a title sleeve.
