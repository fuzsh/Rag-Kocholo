        "text": "Morrissey has just announced a brief tour of the United States and Canada this fall! The announcement follows Morrissey’s recent four-date residency in Las Vegas, Nevada. The trek will take the English singer/songwriter across the US south and East Coast as well as Ontario, Canada. As of this posting, it doesn’t look like any supporting acts have been announced other than Morrissey’s band.\n\nAccording to Morrissey’s longtime guitarist Jesse Tobias, this tour is going to be something particularly special for fans.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\n“There is currently something happening, a finesse and ferocity coming from Morrissey and the band that is unparalleled to anything I’ve seen in my tenure as Morrissey’s guitarist for over 21 years,” said Tobias in a press release for the tour.\n\nThe Morrissey 2024 Tour will kick off on October 31 in Houston, Texas at 713 Music Hall. Pending any additional tour dates that could be added in the coming weeks, the trek should come to an end on November 23 in Waukegan, Illinois at the Genesee Theatre.\n\nTickets to the Morrissey 2024 Tour will be available on Ticketmaster and a presale event is currently underway. General on-sale will begin on Friday, August 9 at 10:00 am local.\n\nIf you didn’t get the chance to get a code or tickets during the presale event, you might have some luck on Stubhub. We recommend Stubhub for after-sale tickets, especially for tour dates that have since been sold out. If you can’t find tickets to your preferred tour date on Ticketmaster, give Stubhub a try.\n\nGet your tickets ASAP before they’re totally gone! This is a pretty short tour that will likely sell out quickly. And who knows when Morrissey will hit the States again?\n\nOctober 31 – Houston, TX – 713 Music Hall\n\nNovember 2 – Dallas, TX – Music Hall at Fair Park\n\nNovember 4 – Little Rock, AR – Robinson Center\n\nNovember 6 – Birmingham, AL – Alabama Theatre\n\nNovember 7 – Knoxville, TN – Tennessee Theatre\n\nNovember 9 – Durham, NC – Durham Performing Arts Center\n\nNovember 12 – Baltimore, MD – The Lyric Baltimore\n\nNovember 13 – Newark, NJ – Performing Arts Center\n\nNovember 15 – Atlantic City, NJ – Ocean Resort\n\nNovember 16 – Rochester, NY – Kodak Center\n\nNovember 19 – Niagara Falls, ON – Fallsview Resort\n\nNovember 20 – Flint, MI – Capitol Theater\n\nNovember 22 – Indianapolis, IN – Murat Theatre\n\nNovember 23 – Waukegan, IL – Genesee Theatre\n\nPhoto by Jim Dyson\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission."
