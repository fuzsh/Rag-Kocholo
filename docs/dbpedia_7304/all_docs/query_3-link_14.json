        "text": "I think it was May 1987 when it was announced that Pink Floyd was releasing a new album and following up with a tour that September. It was a big deal as I remember. My older sibling bought a pair of tickets for us to see 'em at their 2nd Toronto show for that 9th month on the calendar. So I got to see Gilmour & company early on with the 'Waters-less' version of Pink Floyd. They actually started their tour in Ottawa a few days before.\n\nIn those days, I had a job at Toronto Airport & me and my coworkers of the day knew that they rented an Air Canada hangar to practice for their upcoming tour. In late August/early September, they held a concert at said hangar for VIP types. Me and my colleagues drove out to the hangar. Security didn't let us in because we didn't have a VIP pass but we were allowed to see their concert at a distance with the hangar doors open. We went out there just in time to see 'em do their last three songs. The same last three that they did in concert when I saw 'em at Exhibition Stadium in Toronto a few weeks later. I remember \"One Slip\" and \"Run Like Hell\" were played. I cannot remember the third tune.\n\nBy way of concidence, I ended up meeting Roger Waters & his entourage (August 1987) briefly at Toronto Airport. They were in town for that Radio KAOS tour. Waters's British passport was as thick as a novella and I learned then his first name was George. lol Nice chap. I didn't bring up the fact about his former bandmates being 'nearby.' I assumed he already knew that.\n\nSo, I saw the second Toronto show with my older siblilng and we came away impressed. During the show, there was a brief (15 min?) intermission and the 2nd half commenced with the start of \"Wish You Were Here\" which to me was worth the price of admission alone. The $40 (Canadian) price tag for a DSOTM sweater didn't impress me, tho. lol I saw four dudes walking together after the show wearing those sweaters over their t-shirts. I did the math in my head.\n\nI thought \"Learning To Fly\" was a great first single. The video was shot in Western Canada (I think Alberta) & the performance part had to have been shot at that Air Canada hangar. I like AMLOR overall but I do prefer Division Bell in regards to their work without Waters.\n\nPlus, all that sparring between Waters & Gilmour in the media was often in the news. I think Waters tried to deflate the Waters-less Pink Floyd. Anyways, they were news back in 1987.\n\nI’ve never tried this, but has anyone ever made a 10 track album with five tolerable songs from The Final Cut interspersed with the five best songs from AMLOR?\n\nGreat recollections Sean! Thanks so much for posting this.\n\nI was a teenager then, a big PF fan, and too young to have seen the Wall or Animals shows. I had thought that PF was done for, so I was hugely excited to learn they were releasing a new album and going on tour. It was very much like a dream come true.\n\nI listened to the album a lot and enjoyed it, but even from the very first single it didn’t really sound like a classic PF album to me. I didn’t think it was in the same category as their DSOTM through The Wall material. It was an enjoyable record, but didn’t really seem like a real PF album to me.\n\nThat was less because Waters wasn’t there and more solely based on the way it sounded. At the time, I knew who he was, but didn’t totally understand his significance to the band. And he seemed like a jerk, so I didn’t really care about his absence. But to me, the sound of PF was very much creative, artsy, unique material, which AMLOR didn’t have. I thought of PF albums as having long segments of music that all blended together into a continuous piece of music. AMLOR, on the other hand, just sounded like a collection of individual songs, like any other band would do. And some of the sound effects, spoken word parts, etc., did seem very much (even to a teenager) like they were trying to sound like PF rather than simply trying to make a great album.\n\nBut I never thought of it as being a “Gilmour solo album.” I never heard that description applied to it until decades later. Not saying it’s inaccurate, but in my memory that was a revisionist label.\n\nI loved it, but I liked KAOS more at the time. I saw the tours for both and they were both great. KAOS was a more intimate indoor gig, and felt more 'Floydian' to me, but the AMLOR tour was amazing too. I was just happy to have both albums and to see both bands for the first time. My mates and I accepted it as a Pink Floyd LP, but if it hadn't been as great as it was we might have felt differently I think. It wasn't an insult to their legacy by any means. Didn't really like Division Bell, but a lot of that was down to the lyrics and vocal delivery. I like that album a lot more now than I did at the time. I think of Final Cut differently to anything that came after it. That's the one I'd reach for now before the other three - I think it's exquisite.\n\nThat was a really weird time for me. I was still listening to a lot of punk and hardcore, but I had also started listening to a lot of classic rock. Hendrix, Zeppelin, and Floyd were really big for me at that time. I truly don’t remember whether I thought that MLOR was “legit” Floyd, but I did buy it. I don’t remember it that well, though (other than “Learning to Fly”), so I don’t think I listened to it a whole lot. I know a lot of fans think The Wall and The Final Cut are too Waters-heavy, but I like that. The Final Cut is still my favorite Floyd album. God knows why I bought a Floyd record without him (and did not buy his solo records), but I liked it ok. These days I find the Watersless era pretty questionable, but I’m still not sure that I would categorically say that it’s not Pink Floyd.\n\nbut it got released in the 80's so how can it be expected to sound like something from the 70's. No one complains that Piper or DSOTM sound too 60's or 70's lol Why should David Nick quit when they put all their efforts into PF just because one member quit and failed with a petty lawsuit.\n\nThis whole thing Roger is PF is so silly when people say David and Nick should of gave up. They put a lot of their own money up to front the 87 leg of the new era and tour because they did not know how successful they would be. Nick put one of his Ferrari's up as collateral so when people say it was a cash grab tour it really wasn't.\n\nYet Another Movie is such a Floydian song very eerie and atmospheric"
