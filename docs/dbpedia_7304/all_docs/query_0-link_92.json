        "text": "It's a fine Friday morning here and time for the next poll in our series, as promised! I'll usually be taking a week or so between polls, but \"The Wall\" poll seemed to have run its course, so here we are.\n\nAs usual, the rules: this poll is designed for people familiar with the album in question and with at least some familiarity with some of their other catalog (for comparison purposes). If the poll doesn't interest you, please kindly move on to a thread that does. Please simply consider how YOU would rate the album in question, in comparison with the rest of the Floyd's discography! And as always, a shout-out to member mrjinks for creating all the groundwork for this series.\n\nSo, how do YOU rate this album?\n\nAlbum history: \"Ummagumma is the fourth album by the English rock band Pink Floyd. It is a double album and was released on 25 October 1969 by Harvest Records in the UK and by Capitol Records internationally. The first disc consists of live recordings from concerts at Mothers Club in Birmingham and the College of Commerce in Manchester that contained part of their normal set list of the time, while the second contains solo compositions by each member of the band recorded at the Abbey Road Studios.[6][7] The artwork was designed by regular Floyd collaborators Hipgnosis and features a number of pictures of the band combined to give a Droste effect.\"\n\nTracklist:\n\n1-1 Astronomy Domine 8:32\n\n1-2 Careful With That Axe, Eugene 8:49\n\n1-3 Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun 9:27\n\n1-4 A Saucerful Of Secrets 12:48\n\n2-1 Sysyphus (Parts 1-4) 13:28\n\n2-2 Grantchester Meadows 7:26\n\n2-3 Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together In A Cave And Grooving With A Pict 4:59\n\n2-4 The Narrow Way (Parts 1-3) 12:17\n\n2-5 The Grand Vizier's Garden Party (Parts 1-3) 8:46\n\nPrevious polls:\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Currently 441 people have voted, with an average of 4.27.\n\nThe Wall. Currently 723 (wow!) people have voted, with an average of 3.98.\n\nCLEARLY one of their best works and essential for these reasons:\n\n1. The Big One: The live album. This is the only official Pink Floyd live album featuring the entire classic lineup that was released contemporaneously, and it showcases the Floyd in their old-school incarnation as an experimental avant garde art rock band. It's miles away from the carefully calculated and enhanced performances of the post-Dark Side era - this is just four hip British stoners letting it rip, but still maintaining a careful framework in their chaos. At least two of the four cuts are considered the definitive versions of these compositions (Saucerful and Axe).\n\n2. The Waters and Gilmour sections of the solo disc are essential IMHO. \"Grantchester Meadows\" is easily the most beautiful of the Floyd's pastoral folk tunes. \"The Narrow Way\" is beautifully played, sonically impressive, and the jungle section is actually quite humorous, and probably intended that way.\n\n3. The Wright and Mason sections aren't really that bad. I've given several listens to \"Sysyphus\" lately and it holds up better than I remembered. Mason's portion is easily the least impressive offering but I give him points for effort, and for not turning it into a John Bonham type drum solo.\n\nConclusion: If you're at all interested in how we got from Piper to Dark Side, Ummagumma is an essential stop on the highway. This is, after all, the album that brought the Floyd to the attention of American FM radio stations. It's an unpolished adventurous experiment issued during an era where unpolished adventure was a necessary career move. If you're only casually interested in the Floyd, then it's perhaps less important, so I wouldn't argue with anyone who passes on it. But for a deeper understanding of this important band, it's necessary.\n\nMore is your favorite PF album? I love More but have to be in the mood for it."
