        "text": "It was already released on Picnic — A Breath of Fresh Air but not outside the UK or Germany\n\nLike many 'gotcha' contract fulfillment compilations by other bands, while perhaps good enough for the casual listener many longtime fans find Works baffling and not very enjoyable. Plus, it turns out Capitol goofed and pulled quadrophonic fold-down tapes for the songs from Dark Side instead of proper stereo mixes\n\nNot previously unreleased - but its previous release (on a Harvest Label sampler album from circa 1970) was unauthorized by the band from what I've read (plus it was a limited release anyway) - apparently its appearance on Works was authorized by the band. I'd say that's a valid reason for the Works compilation to exist - to get that song (re)released. Of course a better reason for Works to exist would be if it included more rarities than just that one.\n\nTo recycle what I said in a previous thread, Works was aimed at the punters who bought The Wall and wanted to explore the back catalog; how else to explain its cover of an anonymous Joe defacing the side of a battleship to show his love for his favorite group?\n\nAlso, the can of pink paint on the back cover (which says Dark Side was released in February; sorry, it was March); that's classy...NOT!\n\nWhat's inside? Well, there are some essential Floyd tracks (\"One of These Days\", \"Arnold Layne\", \"See Emily Play\", \"Set the Controls...\", \"Free Four\") plus some rarities (\"Embryo\", Dark Side quad mixes) and \"Several Species...\" instead of something fromAtom Heart Mother like \"If\" or \"Fat Old Sun\".\n\nEssential? Only for \"Embryo\" so don't spend too much on it.\n\nThe studio version of \"Embryo\" has been subsequently re-released on Dramatis/ation; however, the version of \"One of These Days\" with the Dark Side heart beat from \"Speak to Me\" overlaid on it is still unique to this comp.\n\nWhat are the differences between the quad Dark Side tracks and the regular stereo?\n\nI have to admit to kind of liking Works. It is a very weird compilation to be sure, but I actually enjoy some of the alternate mixes, like the heartbeat of DSOTM going into “One of these Days”. If they would have replaced “Several Species...” with “ Grantchester Meadows” I think it would have have made a decent sampler of the Harvest Years.\n\nI bought this on cassette in '85, just as I began my Floyd obsession. I hadn't heard a lot of the songs yet (though some were vaguely familiar, somehow). It turned me on to the pre Dark-Side stuff. I loved it then, and it still has a place in my heart all these years later. So much that I recently picked up a CD copy of it. And found a vinyl copy maybe 4 years ago. The cross-fades are great, and the different mixes are cool. So whatever the point was, it worked for me.\n\nI'd take it over A Collection of Great Dance Songs anyday!\n\nI had just got into Floyd my freshman year in HS and had The Wall, DSOTM, and got The Final Cut (which I like very much) when it was released. I was slowly chipping away at the back catalog (Meddle, WYWH, and Animals) when Works was released. I picked it up and was blown away by the two Syd Barret tracks, and really liked Embryo, Free Four, and Controls which were all new to me. Don't understand why Several Species, a non-musical Waters solo track, was included. A better early selection would have enhanced the collection.\n\nThe version of One Of These Days is also unique in that it has Speak To Me mixed into the wind sound in the intro. Thought that was a cool touch. Maybe Roger Waters did too, since he put One Of These Days in place of On The Run when he played side one of Dark Side on his last tour?\n\nThey're summed to stereo from quad, so the mixes are a bit wonky, but the guitars are mixed differently, and the backing vocals are much more prominent.\n\nI'd recommend listening to the quad mix of Dark Side if you've got access to a multichannel player because it's superb. (Not so keen on the 5,1)\n\nThe band themselves didn't do much to disabuse people of this notion by their policy of playing a maximum one or maybe two songs from before Dark Side, in all of their live shows from '74 onwards...\n\nGood observation. I was about to call it a contractual counterpoint to A Collection.. but that one overlaps.\n\nI have two older brothers that influenced my taste a lot when I was about 12. The one that is 10 years older than me gave this CD to my oldest (12 years older) for christmas around 1990-1992 just as I was getting into Pink Floyd. I borrowed it and that was my introduction to the early stuff. By then I basically knew The Wall and Delicate Sound Of Thunder.\n\nIt makes little sense \"on paper\" but when I played it again a few years ago I was surprised how much I enjoyed listening to it. Not GREAT but enjoyable in its own way.\n\nWere I to include \"Fearless\" and \"Brain Damage/Eclipse\" in a Pink Floyd compilation album, I would keep the Works cross-fade intact — but the Quad-encoded mixes don't work for me, I'd rather have the proper Chris Thomas stereo versions in their place. The phase-y, indistinct mock stereo versions of \"Arnold Layne\" and \"See Emily Play\" are also not to my liking\n\nThere was a track-list of songs that were considered for Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd from the mock-ups James Guthrie made while he was compiling it, and while \"Fearless\", \"Brain Damage\", and \"Eclipse\" all made the long list, \"Several Species...\", \"Free Four\", and \"Embryo\" notably did not"
