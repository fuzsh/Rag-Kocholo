The gallery are advertising that Storm will be in attendance on 13th December, but we are finding it hard to imagine that Storm would want to undertake such a long trip. Interestingly enough though, Guy Pratt will be in town with his ‘My Bass And Other Animals’ show that weekend, and if Storm does manage to make it, we’re betting those two meet up! If we get further news about Storm’s appearance we will be sure to let you know.\n\nPink Floyd Gets The Boot!

To a standing ovation, Gilmour dedicated a toast to Rick. David said “I’m going to dedicate this to my old friend and colleague Richard Wright who died a couple of weeks ago with whom I’ve worked for 40 odd years. “There’s all sorts of music I won’t be able to play without him which is a source of great sadness for me,”David added . “One of the last things he wanted to do was play a big outdoor festival such as Glastonbury which we were unable to do”. “Anyway, as I say he deserves this just as much as I do. You could say that he worked in the position of second fiddle to the pushier chaps at the front, but his work was vitally important to our entire career.”\n\nLive In Gdansk Enters Billboard Top 200 David’s Live In Gdansk is selling strongly around the world.

The rights to albums including Animals, The Wall, A Momentary Lapse Of Reason and The Division Bell are held under contract by EMI but are coming up for review. EMI, which has rights to the group’s earlier work up to and including the 1975 album Wish You Were Here, is understood to have an agreement to match any rival offer. But a rights deal is complicated by divisions that grew up within the group, which now has three different managers.

We are not sure how widespread this problem is, but our advice is if you have any trouble at all with playing the DVD’s, return them to the point of purchase.

Fortunately, in Tony’s case he was able to play the DVD’s.\n\nLive In Gdansk: The Movie With the release of David Gilmour’s ‘Live In Gdansk’ concert (on CD/DVD & Vinyl) the movie of the same name has just screened in the USA.

During the ceremony Reinfeldt sang ‘We don’t need no education’, capping his one-line performance with an emphatic ‘Yeah’. “If the Prime Minister decides to sing for the people of Sweden I wish he would least choose to sing lyrics that did not proclaim our lack of a need for education,” union chairwoman Metta Fjelkner said in a statement. The head of the National Union of Teachers added that the Prime Minister should try to make up for his anti-educational crooning by singing something positive about “a profession he calls the most important in the country.” We here at AFG think this sounds sort of familiar!\n\nSyd Barrett Was Not Mentally Ill Claims His Sister In an extraordinary interview with NME, Syd Barrett’s sister Rosemary Breen has claimed that Syd was “Never mentally ill. He was assessed by quite a few psychiatrists over the years and they always said he’s unusual but there is no illness”. She said he “never wanted fame” and withdrew from the music scene because of “a combination of too much LSD and a very eccentric creative brain”. “If you’re very tired and put a load of acid into the mix you’ve got chaos haven’t you? It was all very nasty but it was inevitable. When you put those factors together you are going to have an explosion aren’t you?” “Fame was the last thing he wanted and he never understood it. He never needed it because from the moment he was a child he was surrounded by people who adored him.” Rosemary also added that after returning to Cambridge permanently in 1981 Syd showed no interest in Pink Floyd at all. She said: “He just tried to put that whole thing away. If anyone called him Syd he wouldn’t answer (his real name was Roger). He wasn’t Syd because Syd was Pink Floyd. He wasn’t being clever by being reclusive, he was just being himself. The full interview can be read in the NME edition dated Aug 27.\n\nPink Floyd Receive Polar Music Prize Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf presented the Polar Music Prize to Nick Mason & Roger Waters (on behalf of Pink Floyd) at a gala ceremony held at the Stockholm Concert Hall on 26 August.

Roger paid tribute to his 96-year old mother. “If there is any humanity and empathy in my work, which I think there is, I would owe it to her,” he said.\n\nRoger & Nick To Collect Polar Music Prize In Person Roger Waters & Nick Mason will attend the Polar Music Prize ceremony and accept the prize from His Majesty King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.

The legendary 14 Hour Technicolour Dream footage that has been the holy grail of Floyd collectors for over 40 years looks like finally appearing.

These interviews won’t be included in the version which is intended for television broadcast at a later date. The bonus Floyd performances are\n\n1) Astronomy Domine – Queen Elizabeth Hall, 14 May 1967 (We think that this version is NOT from the Queen Elizabeth Hall performance, AD was not performed at that show.
