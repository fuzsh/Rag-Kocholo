        "text": "For December 31, 2020, Maryhope, my partner in radio and my partner in love, and I remotely recorded some radio shows for WMPG-FM Community Radio out of Portland, Maine and WMPG.org. Maryhope and I covered several shows at WMPG for New Year’s Eve a few years before (when it was on a Sunday night) in an eight-and-a-half hour marathon show to ring in the new year. We had a blast, until the DJ with the first show of the New Year (the one who would replace us after our special New Year’s broadcast) overslept, because he thought, since it was a holiday, he didn’t have to go in (cue the eye roll). Other than that, we had a an incredible time ringing in the New Year in the place we had first met many years before, and we certainly do make some amazing radio together!\n\nIn thinking about our fun time with that New Year’s Eve at WMPG, Maryhope had the excellent idea of ringing in 2021 at WMPG too! But, when Covid-19 hit in March 2020, WMPG has been broadcasting remotely ever since. First, they were airing recently-archived shows (WMPG keeps archives of their shows for five weeks on WMPG.org), and then just about everyone started recording shows remotely from home. That’s when Maryhope and I joined in, submitting shows to air whenever there was an open spot in the schedule.\n\nMaryhope started airing her wonderful new badass retro show, PURPLE MONKEY DISHWASHER, eventually getting her old slot back, 9:00 – 11:00pm on Sundays, with me contributing a STUCK IN THE 80s spotlight!! You can find the archives of her past five shows at wmpg.org/show/sun2100/. And I resurrected our old radio show, STUCK IN THE 80s, for some new shows and rebroadcast some old ones as well. It was a lot of fun bringing the show back after a few years!\n\nBut, when Maryhope mentioned doing some shows for WMPG to air on New Year’s Eve 2020 and early New Year’s Day 2021 (she recorded somewhere in the vicinity of four shows, and I did a couple), at the time, I didn’t realize I would be writing about one of the shows I did a few months later.\n\nThe show I’m referring to was a fill-in show for the WMPG Station Manager, Jim Rand, and his longtime Thursday afternoon Punk show, LAND OF THE LOST. But, in my 25 years at WMPG, I learned a long time ago, that if you’re subbing for a show, you don’t always have to play what is normally played on that particular show. Those hosts “encourage” you to play what they normally play, but it’s not usually required.\n\nMy show that New Year’s Eve afternoon (from 3:00 – 5:00pm Eastern time) was called 1979. That’s it; that’s the title. It was the year I fell in love with music, and I wanted to highlight that. I lovingly put together two hours of kickass music in a multitude of genres that included no less than Rock, Punk, Disco, Soul, Alternative (before it was called that), Rap, Country, New Wave, Ska….and Pop Muzik, which was also the song I started the show off with, by Robin Scott (better known as M, and one of my all-time favorite songs).\n\nThat first set of my 1979 show was admittedly one of THE BEST sets I have ever done in the 36 years I’ve been a DJ. After “Pop Muzik,” I played “Dance This Mess Around” by The B-52’s, “Grinding Halt” by The Cure, “Do The Dog” by The Specials, Madness and “One Step Beyond…,” plus “Tears Of A Clown” by my friend, Dave Wakeling, and The English Beat, and “Train In Vain” by The Clash.\n\nIn total, I played 30 full songs, a playlist that included songs from Blondie, Led Zeppelin, The Ramones, the Electric Light Orchestra, the Buzzcocks, Fleetwood Mac, The Jacksons, Nick Lowe, Sister Sledge and David Bowie. I also played part of “Rapper’s Delight” by The Sugarhill Gang, in a special mix I put together with “Good Times” by Chic, and I played a comedy bit from Robin Williams’ brilliant 1979 comedy album, REALITY…WHAT A CONCEPT.\n\nI was pretty proud of the show. I still am. Maryhope loved it too, and I even got a piece of fan mail from a WMPG listener about my 1979 program, less than an hour into the show, with the email subject line to WMPG titled, “Today’s fabulous selection from 1979!”\n\nThe email read, “Today doing laundry and plugged in my old boombox! I searched for a station, WMPG, came in crystal clear!! What a fabulous selection of ’79 music!! The English Beat, the Clash, Blondie, and the Ramones, to name a few! I am mighty impressed with your choices today!! I grew up listening and have a few of the above artists’ albums!! Thank you for going back in time…”\n\nWell, not long after the start of 2021, Maryhope and I were still talking about that show. I think I told her that I could do a 1979 show for a year. And, I believe she said something along the lines of, “Well, why don’t you?” I hadn’t planned on doing another show, to be honest, and was going to just submit the occasional STUCK IN THE 80s until Covid was finally behind us, and everything was back to the old normal. Or maybe I thought I didn’t have time to work on a weekly show. Of course, Maryhope was right. She also reminded me, much to my surprise, that I had been talking about doing a 1979 show for years.\n\nSo, with a request to see if there were any open slots on the WMPG schedule right now, I sent an email to Jessica Lockhart, the Program Director for WMPG, who has been with the station longer than I’ve been with the station, and who has been doing some absolutely incredible work scheduling all of these remote radio shows from everyone, and helping to keep WMPG on the air all this time.\n\nThere was an open slot from Saturday nights 11:00pm to 1:00am Sunday mornings, and I snagged it right away. I slightly reworked my New Year’s Eve show, and on January 23, 2021, WMPG aired the first installment of my new radio show, 1979 – THIS AIN’T JUST DISCO.\n\n“This Ain’t Just Disco” is paraphrased, of course, in a line from “Life During Wartime,” a Talking Heads song from their 1979 album, FEAR OF MUSIC (“This ain’t no party / this ain’t no disco…”). And, “This Ain’t Just Disco” fits perfectly because Disco was EVERYWHERE in 1979. You couldn’t escape it. Even non-Disco artists like Rod Stewart, Wings and Kiss had big Disco hits in 1979. And Blondie’s “Heart Of Glass” united Punk and Disco fans alike. No easy trick.\n\nAnd the more I thought about subsequent 1979 shows, I thought of a tagline that is 1979% accurate: “Songs from the year I fell in love with music, and songs from 1979 I fell in love with later on.” And, for two hours every week, it’s a fun combination of songs that wouldn’t normally go together in (almost) any radio playlist. Six shows in, I didn’t repeat a single artist (except a medley of “Hot Stuff” and “Bad Girls” by Donna Summer in the debut show). Seven shows in, I hadn’t repeated a single song. That’s not so bad! AND, as an added bonus, like I’m doing for Maryhope’s show, she is doing a PURPLE MONKEY DISHWASHER 70s spotlight for each of my shows! Pretty damn bleeping cool!!!\n\nFor Show No. 7, which aired at a special time Sunday, March 7th into International Women’s Day, March 8, 2021 (and was rebroadcasted in my normal Saturday night slot on March 13, 2021), I celebrated International Women’s Day 2021 with a show featuring all female artists. One of those artists is the aforementioned late, great Donna Summer, from Boston, MA. Donna Summer was not only the “Queen of Disco,” she was the Queen of 1979. Donna Summer RULED 1979.\n\nOn the first BILLBOARD Hot 100 chart of 1979, she was still in the Top 40 with her No. 1 cover of “MacArthur Park,” and two weeks later, she was back in the Top 40 with “Heaven Knows,” which peaked at No. 4. She was only out of the Top 40 for one week in 1979.\n\nThe No. 1 songs “Hot Stuff” and “Bad Girls” followed in the Summer of 1979, plus “Dim All The Lights” (also from the No. 1 BAD GIRLS album) reached No. 2 in November, and her duet with Barbra Streisand, “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),” moved into No. 1 the following week, which was also the week her new single, “On The Radio” (and the title track of her greatest hits album) was released. And Donna Summer was STILL in the Top 10 of the BILLBOARD Hot 100 the last week of 1979! Phew! Holy cats!\n\n“On The Radio” was played on my International Women’s Day show. It’s also one of my favorite “radio” songs, and before I proudly owned the double greatest hits album it’s named after, I proudly owned the single. The history is fuzzy on this, but ON THE RADIO: GREATEST HITS VOLUMES I & II may have actually been the first album I ever owned (though not the first album I ever bought with my own money — that was 1981’s GREATEST HITS by Queen).\n\nThe single for “On The Radio” debuted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in the first half of January 1980, and within two weeks, was already in the Top 40. Three weeks later, it was already in the Top 10, and headed for No. 1. Unfortunately, there was a lot of competition at the top of the chart in the early months of the new decade, and other songs had plans for No. 1, notably Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” and Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick In The Wall (Part 2).” The best “On The Radio” could settle for is two weeks at No. 5 (for two weeks) in March 1980.\n\nStill, “On The Radio” ended up as one of the biggest hits of 1980, and Donna Summer had another big year, reaching No. 3 with “The Wanderer,” the title song from her new album (and a new label for her, Donna was the first artist signed to the brand-new Geffen Records, founded by David Geffen, who had co-created Asylum Records back in 1971).\n\nDonna Summer made four song appearances in the first seven shows of 1979 — THIS AIN’T JUST DISCO, and I KNOW she’ll make some more, especially with Show No. 10 (airing Saturday, April 3, 2021) devoted to the short-lived but popular labels Casablanca (Donna Summer’s first label), and RSO Records (responsible for the huge SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and GREASE soundtracks).\n\nI’m not how long the show will be on. Like I said, I could prolly do the show for a year, though, honestly, I’d happily give it up to bring WMPG back to its normal schedule, because that would mean that Covid-19 is behind us, which, after a year already, is already a year too long.\n\nFor now, though, I’m enjoying the show and putting together new shows every week! One of the best parts of doing this show is discovering new-to-me music that is 42 years old! Kickass. You can find the archives of the show at wmpg.org/show/sat2300/. And that is where you will find me, Maryhope’s PURPLE MONKEY DISHWASHER 70s SPOTLIGHT, and where you will find Donna Summer…“On The Radio.”\n\nHey everyone! Thanks so much for being patient with me, as I’ve taken an unexpected (but quite enjoyable) absence from the bloggy thing since the end of July. There’s been work stuff, home stuff, I had a fun time attending concerts featuring Blondie, the 80s Retro Futura Tour (including Howard Jones, Modern English, Men Without Hats, Paul Young, Katrina of Katrina And The Waves, and The English Beat!), and most recently, seeing the wonderful Colin Hay in beautiful Rockland, Maine.\n\nI’ve also been spending a lot of quality time with the incredible and awesome Hope, my superfriend, sassy radio co-host and writing hero, which included a swim in the cold Atlantic Ocean here in Maine that changed me forever. There’s a lot more to say, and I will, in a post coming soon that will be about Hope and that swim in the ocean and much more! And Hope comes up again later in this post, so stay tuned!!\n\nWhen I started my tribute to my radio hero, Casey Kasem, back on June 1, school was in session and Summer was weeks away. Well, it’s now September 9, 2017, school is back in session and Fall is less than two weeks away. I’ve had fun bringing you this tribute to Casey (who passed away in June 2014 at the age of 82), and wanted to make sure (1) you all didn’t think I would hold out on the Number One song of this tribute, and (2) that I get this in ASAFP, because what’s a Top 40 countdown without a Number One song?\n\nMuch like AMERICAN TOP 40, this post will be full of nerdy chart facts and then some, but first, I wanted to recap the songs I’ve posted in this series so far. These songs (which include five (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s), are ranked at the positions they peaked at on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 (with peak year), and though they do not represent a definitive Top 40 list for me, but I love all of them, and hope you’ve enjoyed reading about them!\n\n40.

DANCING IN THE DARK – BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (1984)\n\nThroughout this series, I’ve been mentioned how many songs peaked at each position between 1979 and 1989. It’s only fitting that songs which reached No. 1 would have the highest number of songs hitting the apex of the BILLBOARD Hot 100. For this post, I am only counting the songs that reached No. 1 between January 1980 and December 1989, and for that 80s time period, 232 songs went all the way to No. 1. Let’s get nerdy now (if you’re not already there), with some chart feats about No. 1 songs during the 80s and the BILLBOARD Hot 100:\n\nFOUR (REAL) ONE-HIT WONDERS reached No. 1 during the 80s – Bobby McFerrin (“Don’t Worry, Be Happy”), the second-chance single, “When I’m With You” by Sheriff, Jan Hammer’s “Miami Vice Theme,” and Vangelis (“Chariots Of Fire (Titles)”), though the composer did reach the chart separately twice in the early 80s as part of the duo Jon & Vangelis, with Jon Anderson of Yes.\n\nMOST WEEKS SPENT AT NO. 1 IN THE 80s (27); MOST NO. 1 SONGS FROM ONE ALBUM (5); MOST NO. 1 SONGS IN THE 80s (9) – Michael Jackson. The King Of Pop reached No. 1 in the 80s with “Rock With You” (1980; 4 weeks at No. 1), “Billie Jean” (1983; 7 weeks), “Beat It” (1983; 3 weeks), “Say Say Say,” with Paul McCartney (1983 / 1984; 6 weeks), “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You,” with Siedah Garrett (1987; 1 week), “Bad” (1987; 2 weeks), “The Way You Make Me Feel” (1988; 1 week), “Man In The Mirror” (1988; 2 weeks); “Dirty Diana” (1988; 1 week).\n\nMOST NO. 1 SONGS IN THE 80s (if you’re NOT Michael Jackson): Madonna (7), Phil Collins (7 solo hits), Whitney Houston (7), George Michael (6 solo hits, which includes “Careless Whisper”), Daryl Hall & John Oates (5), Lionel Richie (5).\n\nNO. 1 WITH MOST WEEKS SPENT ON THE HOT 100 – 40 – “Red Red Wine” – UB40. It spent 25 weeks on the Hot 100, including a week at No. 1 in 1988, and had charted for 15 weeks in its first chart run in 1984.\n\nMOST CONFIGURATIONS AT NO. 1 – PAUL McCARTNEY, with Wings (“Coming Up (Live At Glasgow),” 1980), with Stevie Wonder (“Ebony And Ivory,” 1982), and with Michael Jackson (“Say Say Say,” 1983 / 1984).\n\nNO. 1 WITH MOST WEEKS SPENT IN THE TOP 10 OF THE HOT 100 (15) – “Physical – OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN (1981 / 1982), and “Eye Of The Tiger” – SURVIVOR (1982). SUPER NERDY FUN FACT: the song which spent the most weeks in the Top 10 in the 80s didn’t even reach No. 1 – “Hurts So Good” by John Mellencamp spent 16 weeks in the Top 10, with four of those weeks in the runner-up spot.\n\nMOST WEEKS SPENT AT NO. 1 IN THE 80s (10) – “Physical” by Olivia Newton-John (1981 / 1982). While it’s more commonplace on the Hot 100 these days, the biggest song of the 1980s would be the only song to spend at least 10 weeks at No. 1 on the chart for next 10 years. In 1992, Boyz II Men spent a then-record 13 weeks at No. 1 with “End Of The Road.” Two No. 1 songs later, Whitney Houston would break that record with “I Will Always Love You,” which spent its 14th and final week on top in late February 1993. The current record is 16 weeks at No. 1.\n\nIn the most recent tabulation of the Greatest Of All Time Hot 100 songs for BILLBOARD’s legendary singles chart, many songs from the 80s were represented, and are currently ranked as follows:\n\n08. “Physical” – OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN (1981 / 1982; 10 weeks at No. 1)\n\n15. “Bette Davis Eyes” – KIM CARNES (1981; 9 weeks)\n\n16. “Endless Love” – DIANA ROSS & LIONEL RICHIE (1981; 9 weeks)\n\n24. “Eye Of The Tiger” – SURVIVOR (1982; 6 weeks)\n\n29. “Every Breath You Take” – THE POLICE (1983; 8 weeks)\n\n31. “Flashdance…What A Feeling” – IRENE CARA (1983; 6 weeks)\n\n40. “Another One Bites The Dust” – QUEEN (1980; 3 weeks)\n\n41. “Say Say Say” – PAUL McCARTNEY & MICHAEL JACKSON (1983 / 1984; 6 weeks)\n\n54. “Call Me” – BLONDIE (1980; 6 weeks)\n\n57. “Lady” – KENNY ROGERS (1980; 6 weeks)\n\n63. “Centerfold” – THE J. GEILS BAND (1982; 6 weeks)\n\n64. “(Just Like) Starting Over” – JOHN LENNON (1980 / 1981; 5 weeks)\n\n68. “I Love Rock ’N Roll” – JOAN JETT & THE BLACKHEARTS (1982; 7 weeks)\n\n73. “Ebony And Ivory” – PAUL McCARTNEY & STEVIE WONDER (1982; 7 weeks)\n\n75. “That’s What Friends Are For” – DIONNE & FRIENDS (1986; 4 weeks)\n\n77. “Upside Down” – DIANA ROSS (1980; 4 weeks)\n\n83. “Billie Jean” – MICHAEL JACKSON (1983; 7 weeks)\n\n86. “Abracadabra” – THE STEVE MILLER BAND (1982; 2 weeks)\n\n89. “Say You, Say Me” – LIONEL RICHIE (1985 / 1986; 4 weeks)\n\n91. “All Night Long (All Night)” – LIONEL RICHIE (1983; 4 weeks)\n\n95. “Waiting For A Girl Like You” – FOREIGNER (1981 / 1982; 10 weeks at No. 2; still tied for a record for spending the most weeks peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100)\n\n98. “Hurts So Good” – JOHN MELLENCAMP (1982; 4 weeks at No. 2)\n\nSo, for now, the 80s represent more than a fifth of the greatest hits to grace the BILLBOARD HOT 100. Pretty damn cool. I know it won’t always be like that, and I always wonder why some huge hits like Prince’s “When Doves Cry” (No. 1 for 1984) or Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick In The Wall” (No. 2 for 1980) aren’t up there, but songs these days tend to stay atop the Hot 100 (and the chart as a whole) a lot longer than they did back in the day, but honestly, I’m grateful for the songs that are still there.\n\nWhen I was preparing for this hefty blog post (prolly my second-longest, save for the Prince tribute post in April 2016), I was going through the list of No. 1 songs, and there are some songs I’ve already featured as a “song of the day” (Tears For Fears’ “Everybody Wants To Rule The World” comes to mind, and has often as of late), and there are many others I love.\n\nBut, I concede that there are some real stinkers in there, too: Will To Power’s awful covers medley of “Baby, I Love Your Way” and “Freebird” (subtitled “Freebaby,” which is just heinous)?! How in THE HELL did that get to go to No. 1 and “I Don’t Want Your Love” by Duran Duran stops at No. 4, and U2’s “Desire” stops at No. 3?! For the love of all things holy! And though I admit enjoying the movie MANNEQUIN, “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” by Starship?! Are you kidding me?! Even Grace Slick denounced that piece of shit. While the go-to “worst song of the 80s” award is usually 1985’s “We Built This City,” I can tolerate that way more over “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now.” Yes, I’m THAT guy.\n\nIf I was going for my absolute favorite No. 1 song of the 80s, there’s no competition. It’s “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” by Simple Minds. It’s also my all-time favorite song. But it’s a post I want to save for another time. So, I thought it would be fun to bring in Hope, my writing hero, who, unlike yours truly, doesn’t obsess and write about nerdy chart facts or Top 40 hits, let alone ones that hit No. 1. I thought it would be cool to have her choose the song for this post.\n\nOn August 11, 2017, Hope was kind enough to send me her list of her picks for No. 1 songs from the 80s, many of which have been already mentioned in this post! One of those songs, and a song that is almost universally loved (like “Let’s Dance” by David Bowie, “Time After Time” by Cyndi Lauper, or the aforementioned Tears For Fears, Prince and Simple Minds gems) is “Abracadabra” by The Steve Miller Band.\n\nHope had included “Abracadabra” under the category of “Situational” No. 1 songs. For Hope, “Abracadabra” was popular during the Summer after her high school graduation (“the glamorous Summer in The Hamptons!”), and she loves the line, “black panties with an angel’s face.” Who wouldn’t love that line?! It’s awesome (much like Hope herself)!\n\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin native Steve Miller formed his Psychedelic Rock / Blues Rock band in San Francisco back in 1966. Since his first two albums were released in 1968, through to his 1988 Jazz album, BORN 2 B BLUE, Steve Miller had been on Capitol Records, and he had some huge albums in the 70s.\n\nAfter 1981’s CIRCLE OF LOVE album (with the sweet Top 40 hit and criminally-forgotten gem, “Heart Like A Wheel”) failed to become his fourth consecutive platinum album here in America (though it was certified Gold), Steve was undeterred, got to work, and released the ABRACADABRA album in mid-June 1982.\n\nOf the album, ROLLING STONE said, “The essence of good magic is deception, and with the release of this album, Steve Miller has earned the right to twirl his wand and shout, ‘Abracadabra!’”\n\nWell, Steve thought so too, but Capitol wasn’t so sure. The song inspired by Diana Ross (whom Steve met on a Pop music TV show in the 60s) told THE HOWARD STERN SHOW in 2016 that Capitol Records didn’t see a hit with the song “Abracadabra”:\n\n“Capitol didn’t believe in [“Abracadabra”] and didn’t want to release it. I had a different deal with Phonogram in Europe. When it came out in Europe, I cancelled my American tour because it was Number One everywhere in the world, except the States.” Once again, the record label got it wrong.\n\nWell, after seeing the success of “Abracadabra” overseas, Capitol gave in and released it in the U.S., a month before the ABRACADABRA album was released. “Abracadabra” debuted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in late May 1982 at No. 75, and took just four weeks to debut within the Top 40.\n\nThe next few weeks were a steady climb, and by late July 1982, “Abracadabra” had become Steve Miller’s first Top 10 hit in five years, to the month. With John Mellencamp’s “Hurts So Good” camped out at No. 2, and Survivor’s “Eye Of The Tiger” camped out at No. 1, “Abracadabra” was stuck at No. 3 for four weeks before it could work its magic on reaching No. 1.\n\nIn early September 1982, after 15 weeks on the chart, “Abracadabra” finally hit No. 1 on the BILLBOARD Hot 100, giving Steve Miller his third No. 1 U.S. single overall, and his first No. 1 single since 1976’s “Rock’n Me” spent a week on top. The No. 1 run of “Abracadabra” was just as quick as “Rock’n Me,” and his first No. 1 song, 1974’s “The Joker,” which also spent a lone week at No. 1.\n\nThe following week, Chicago’s “Hard To Say I’m Sorry” snuck into the No. 1 position when no one was looking and stayed there for two weeks. “Abracadabra” dropped to No. 3 (behind previous No. 1, “Eye Of The Tiger”). But, in a magical chart feat, “Abracadabra” moved back up to No. 2 the next week, and by the end of September, “Abracadabra” reclaimed the No. 1 spot for one more week, before John Mellencamp’s little ditty about “Jack And Diane” started its four-week run at No. 1. “Abracadabra” stayed on the Hot 100 until mid-Novemer 1982, and left the chart after nearly half a year. It finished the year at No. 9 here in America.\n\nAround the globe, “Abracadabra” worked its magic on the singles charts of many countries, reaching No. 1 in Switzerland (six weeks), Sweden (four weeks), Australia and Canada (two weeks), and Austria, No. 2 in the U.K., Germany and Ireland, No. 4 in Norway, No. 8 in New Zealand, and No. 26 in the Netherlands.\n\n“Abracadabra” was the last song The Steve Miller Band placed inside of the Top 40 of the BILLBOARD Hot 100, though they charted several more times through 1993, including the brilliant but oddly-underrated “I Want To Make The World Turn Around” from 1986.\n\nSteve Miller continues to tour today, and in 2016, he was inducted as a solo artist into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, where he had some not so nice things to say about the whole thing, calling the Hall a “private boys’ club full of fucking gangsters and crooks,” and vowing to make it better.\n\nHe suggested taking the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame nominating committee, replace every one of them and start over. I hope it works out, because Devo, from Akron, Ohio (less than an hour south of Cleveland, where the Hall is based), should have been inducted years ago, much like the incomparable Cyndi Lauper, who has taken on Blues, Standards, Folk, Dance and Country music in the past 15 years, not to mention writing a book, winning a Tony Award and co-founding the True Colors Fund, which works to end homelessness among LGBT youth, and even testified before Maine Senator Susan Collins in 2015 about this very subject.\n\nAs for me and Hope and many others for “Abracadabra,” it’s one of those infectious songs that deserved to go to No. 1, and 35 years later, it still holds up. At least the five-minute, eleven-second album version. When the single was released, I bought it, but was instantly pissed it wasn’t the long version! Sure, it’s only a minute and change difference, but if you hear the single version vs. the album version, you can tell the single version is a bit sped up, and the kick-ass instrumental that closes out the rest of the song isn’t there. That’s even why I chose the video link below. It’s not a link to the actual video, but to the album version. You know, all these years later, I’m still impressed that sped up, edited single version got the song to No. 1. Maybe that was magic too.\n\nSpeaking of magic, Hope inspired me recently to start training for a 5K using the Couch To 5K app (C25K); we’re both training for it, and finishing Week 5 of 8 this weekend! Hope and I haven’t run a proper 5K in our adult lives, and the last time I ran the equivalent of a 5K was in high school during Cross Country, where I lettered my senior year. Holy cats, that was 33 years ago!\n\nBut, you know what? Maybe it’s not magic after all that’s got us training for our first 5K ever – and in our early 50s! Maybe you just need to believe. Just like Steve Miller believed he had a hit with “Abracadabra,” even as his longtime record label disagreed – and he was right! It’s one of THE BEST songs of the 80s and of all-time. And I believe getting through this 5K (and other aspects of my life) will happen with belief over magic, though I have to say, when it happens, it will feel pretty damn magical and then some…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKCV8gzSlYw\n\nOn June 15, 2014, Casey Kasem, host of the longtime countdown program, AMERICAN TOP 40, passed away at the age of 82. From my first blog post (and prolly some more inbetween then and now), I explained how, in 1979, I was a geeky, lanky and somewhat lost 12-year-old living in Central Maine, had a few friends and not a lot of interest in much of anything, but at some point early that year, I discovered AMERICAN TOP 40, and was glued to it every weekend. Not only could I hear the 40 biggest songs in the country every week, but also Casey’s cool trivia and facts about the songs and the artists, a trait I treasure to this day. For me, the show was No. 1 with a bullet. And still is (thanks to the re-airing of broadcasts of AT40 on iHeart Radio).\n\nIn honor of my radio hero, Casey Kasem, for the entire month of June (and now through July), I will be highlighting a song each day (some days will have two songs!) that peaked in the Top 40 of the BILLBOARD Hot 100 (including five (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s), and with every blog post, just like on AMERICAN TOP 40, the hits will get bigger with each post. On June 1, 2017, I featured a song that peaked at No. 40. Sometime here in July, I’ll feature a “song of the day” that went all the way to No. 1.\n\nAs Casey used to say on AT40, “And on we go!”\n\nNearly 80 songs found a home at the No. 9 position of the BILLBOARD Hot 100 between 1979 and 1989, and many of them seemed to be split up into categories, like the (real) one-hit wonders – Gary Numan, Buckner & Garcia, Ollie & Jerry and Oran “Juice” Jones.\n\nThen you had the first big Top 10 hits (or first big Top 10 solo hits) by established artists – “Let My Love Open The Door” by Pete Townshend, “Touch Of Grey” by The Grateful Dead, “Hit Me With Your Best Shot” by Pat Benatar, “Trouble” by Lindsey Buckingham, “Don’t Shed A Tear” by Paul Carrack, “Lovin’ Every Minute Of It” by Loverboy, “Rush Hour” by Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go’s, “Be Near Me” by ABC and “Burning Down The House” by Talking Heads.\n\nA few second-chance singles reached No. 9 as well – In 1982, Steve Winwood’s original version of “Valerie” stalled at No. 70, while a remix on the CHRONICLE hits compilation in 1987 propelled the song to No. 9. The Pointer Sisters’ No. 30 hit from 1982, “I’m So Excited,” re-entered the chart in 1984 with a new mix and a new chart peak. Ben E. King’s iconic No. 4 hit from 1961,“Stand By Me,” re-entered the chart in 1986 thanks to the brilliant film of the same name, and charted in the Top 10 for the second time, 25 years apart.\n\nPlus, you also had No. 9 hits from well-known artists that have been mostly forgotten for whatever reason (though not by me), like “Walking Away” by Information Society, “Room To Move” by Animotion, “We’re Ready” by Boston, “Love Will Save The Day” by Whitney Houston, “Love Will Conquer All” by Lionel Richie, “I Know What I Like” by Huey Lewis & The News, “Love You Down” by Ready For The World and “Let’s Go!” by Wang Chung (who could forget that one?!).\n\nAnd, there were the big Top 10 comeback hits (“The Doctor” by The Doobie Brothers, “Your Wildest Dreams” by The Moody Blues, “You Got It” by the late, great Roy Orbison), and folks who had more than one No. 9 hit – Sheena Easton, Dan Fogelberg, Barry Manilow, John Mellencamp and The Motels, all with two No. 9 hits, while both Bruce Springsteen and Journey had three each.\n\nIn the Summer of 1987, I was two years removed from high school and DJing wedding receptions, and spinning tunes and showing music videos to crowds of up to 600 teenagers and young adults at a chem-free night club in Waterville, Maine (called Studio 2). That’s where I met Michael, one of my future best friends, who somehow conned me into giving him my 45 of “Burning Down The House” either the night I met him or the next time I saw him. Clever bastard.\n\nThere’s not a whole lot of nightclubbing to be had by youngsters here in Central Maine, even less so now. I met Michael on a Wednesday, when Studio 2 was trying out a mid-week night, trying to duplicate their popular Saturday night dance excursions for the area youth.\n\nThough the Wednesday experiment didn’t work, I’m forever grateful to have met Michael that night. He came down with a crowd from Pittsfield, about 20 miles north of Waterville, and they wanted to hear Alternative music. Well, by the Summer of 1987, my knowledge of “Alternative music” consisted of select songs by Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Clash, Talking Heads and R.E.M., and maybe The Cult and a couple others, but that was about it.\n\nFrom that moment on, Michael and I became close friends (he was just out of high school), and he started his 30-year (so far) tutelage of music I never even knew about. And some of those bands and singers (Robyn Hitchcock especially), Michael has influenced and inflicted more music on me than anyone, and while I still love most of the Top 40 music I grew up with, I am a HUGE fan of Alt-Dance and Alt-Rock today, mostly thanks to Michael.\n\nR.E.M. was one of those bands that did have a Top 40 hit in 1987, and I had no idea prior to “The One I Love” and its parent album, DOCUMENT, that they had been together since 1980 and had already released four critically-acclaimed, full-length albums and an EP, but through Michael’s amazing music collection, I was introduced to all of it. When I went back to college in 1990 (or College 2.0 if you prefer), Michael made me a mix tape (when there was still such a thing) of R.E.M. songs up through 1990. I still have it!\n\nFormed in Athens, GA in 1980, R.E.M. – consisting of singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Mills and drummer Bill Berry – were critical darlings in their first several years, and had some success on BILLBOARD’s album chart – their first four albums were certified Gold – but on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 singles chart, they couldn’t chart any higher than No. 78.\n\nBut somehow, with DOCUMENT (their last album for I.R.S. Records), they broke out beyond the critical praise of music journalists and college programmers and landed into the realm of commercial radio, and garnered a shit-ton more fans, yours truly included.\n\nPart of the success of DOCUMENT is most likely attributed to Scott Litt, who worked with R.E.M. for the first time, and he produced the album. He would also go on to produce their next five albums (the first five R.E.M. albums for Warner Bros.), and all five albums did incredibly well.\n\nThe album was universally hailed as a great achievement. ROLLING STONE’s David Fricke called the album R.E.M.’s “finest album to date” and how DOCUMENT is “a vibrant summary of past tangents and current strengths, [it] is the sound of R.E.M. on the move, the roar of a band that prides itself on the measure of achievement and the element of surprise. The end of rock & roll as R.E.M. knows it is a long way off.”\n\nPitchfork said of the album on DOCUMENT’s 25th Anniversary in 2012: “If 1985’s FABLES OF THE RECONSTRUCTION was R.E.M.’s most self-consciously Southern record to date and 1986’s LIFES RICH PAGEANT their most overtly political, DOCUMENT maintained both their regional self-definition as well as their indirect social engagement.”\n\nThe first single from DOCUMENT, “The One I Love,” was released in August 1987, a month before the album. The song was oft-mistaken for a love song (and maybe still is, I’m not sure). It even might have been featured as one of Casey’s “Long Distance Dedications.” But, the song is just the opposite. Michael Stipe has said “The One I Love” is about “using people over and over. It’s deceptive because it could be a love song until the line, ‘A simple prop to occupy my time’.”\n\nWell, deceptive or not, something worked. “The One I Love” debuted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in mid-September 1987 at No. 84. The following week, it had already surpassed the three previous R.E.M. singles to reach the Hot 100. A month after its debut, it shot into the Top 40.\n\nTwo weeks after its Top 40 debut, it won the Sales award for that week. And in early December 1987, the first Top 40 hit for R.E.M. became their first Top 10 hit, as “The One I Love” spent a week at No. 9. In an interview that appeared in ROLLING STONE a couple of days before, Michael Stipe half-jokingly spoke of the song’s oft-misinterpretation: “I’ve always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It’s probably better that they just think it’s a love song at this point.”\n\n“The One I Love” stayed on the Hot 100 for 20 weeks, spending their last week on the chart in late January 1988, the same week follow-up single, “It’s The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)” made its debut. Both songs helped propel the DOCUMENT album, and it was the band’s first album to be certified Platinum, and wouldn’t be their last.\n\nAround the globe, “The One I Love” reached No. 5 in Ireland, No. 6 in New Zealand, No. 14 in Canada, No. 16 in the U.K., and No. 2 on BILLBOARD’s Mainstream Rock chart. Once BILLBOARD got their Modern Rock chart going September 1988, R.E.M. was the first band to have two No. 1 songs on that chart – “Orange Crush” (eight weeks at No. 1) and “Stand” (two weeks).\n\nAfter R.E.M. left I.R.S. for Warner Bros., the band’s success exploded from there. They would go on to have two No. 1 albums – 1991’s OUT OF TIME and 1994’s MONSTER, two No. 2 albums – the brilliant AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE from 1992 and 1996’s NEW ADVENTURES IN HI-FI, a No. 3 album, 1998’s UP, eight more Top 40 hits (led by 1991’s “Losing My Religion”), and an incredible contract with Warner Bros. that gave them quite a ride for awhile.\n\nR.E.M. broke up in 2011 after more than 30 years of putting out amazing music. Though I sadly never got to see the band perform, in March 2007, I was 10 feet in front of Peter Buck at a show in Cambridge, MA at T.T. The Bear’s, when he was part of Robyn Hitchcock & The Venus 3 (I was also standing next to Amanda Palmer of The Dresden Dolls, though I think Michael – who was a huge fan of her and her band – had to point her out to me).\n\nRobyn & Peter & the rest of The Venus 3 played some Venus 3 originals, covers by The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, and some of Robyn’s songs, both solo and with The Soft Boys. It was an incredible show. That’s attributed to Michael, for introducing me to Robyn Hitchcock from the start of our friendship.\n\nI also got to meet Mike Mills when he came for a signing at Record Store Day at the Bull Moose in Scarborough, Maine in 2014. Bull Moose’s Chris Brown was the inspiration for Record Store Day (also founded in 2007), and I believe the inspiration for getting Mike Mills to come to the store that day. In the brief moment I met him, Mike was very cool and really down to earth, and he was kind enough to sign a GREEN 25th Anniversary CD for a WMPG auction, and for me, he signed the 4-album set Mike was promoting, R.E.M.’s UNPLUGGED: THE COMPLETE 1991 AND 2001 SESSIONS. So, I got to see half of R.E.M., in a sorta roundabout way.\n\nIt’s funny, “The One I Love” is NOT the R.E.M. song I love the most. I actually can’t choose a favorite. But, if I could choose more than one, that distinction would go to “Laughing” (from 1983’s MURMUR), the 1981 Hib-Tone version of “Radio Free Europe,” “Cuyahoga” and “I Believe” (from my favorite 80s R.E.M. album, 1986’s LIFES RICH PAGEANT), “Can’t Get There From Here” (from 1985’s FABLES OF THE RECONSTRUCTION, and an old popular saying here in Maine), “Near Wild Heaven” and “Belong” (from 1991’s OUT OF TIME), “At My Most Beautiful” (from 1998’s UP), the original 1992 version and the 1999 orchestral version of “Man On The Moon,” and “Nightswimming” (from my favorite 90s R.E.M. album, 1992’s AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE).\n\nBut, “The One I Love” will always be the R.E.M. song that I loved FIRST, and, with Michael’s help, made me love the band’s music forever…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7oQEPfe-O8\n\nOn June 15, 2014, Casey Kasem, host of the longtime countdown program, AMERICAN TOP 40, passed away at the age of 82. From my first blog post (and prolly some more inbetween then and now), I explained how, in 1979, I was a geeky, lanky and somewhat lost 12-year-old living in Central Maine, had a few friends and not a lot of interest in much of anything, but at some point early that year, I discovered AMERICAN TOP 40, and was glued to it every weekend. Not only could I hear the 40 biggest songs in the country every week, but also Casey’s cool trivia and facts about the songs and the artists, a trait I treasure to this day. For me, the show was No. 1 with a bullet. And still is (thanks to the re-airing of broadcasts of AT40 on iHeart Radio).\n\nIn honor of my radio hero, Casey Kasem, for the entire month of June (and now through July), I will be highlighting a song each day (some days will have two songs!) that peaked in the Top 40 of the BILLBOARD Hot 100 (including five (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s), and with every blog post, just like on AMERICAN TOP 40, the hits will get bigger with each post. On June 1, 2017, I featured a song that peaked at No. 40. Sometime here in July, I’ll feature a “song of the day” that went all the way to No. 1.\n\nAs Casey used to say on AT40, “And on we go!”\n\nYou know, as unlucky as the stigma for being unlucky the number 13 has had as long as I’ve known it, the No. 13 position on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 is something altogether different, or, lucky. No. 13 has been the home (or treasure trove, if you prefer) to many great classics, like “Money” by Pink Floyd, Queen’s “Somebody To Love,” “Because The Night” by the Patti Smith Group, “Different Drum” by The Stone Poneys featuring Linda Ronstadt, “Radar Love” by Golden Earring, “Takin’ It To The Streets” by The Doobie Brothers, Santana’s “Oye Como Va,” “Roundabout” by Yes, “Let’s Talk About Sex” by Salt-N-Pepa, “Walking In Memphis by Marc Cohn, “Danke Schoen” by Wayne Newton (featured prominently in the John Hughes classic, FERRIS BUELLER’S DAY OFF), “Here Comes My Baby” by The Tremeloes (which my pal Dave Wakeling and The English Beat will be covering on their upcoming album!), “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine (Anymore)” by The Walker Brothers (which was featured in the brilliant but barely-seen 2012 Steve Carell film, SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD), and one of the first singles I ever owned, “Theme From CLOSE ENCOUNTERS” by John Williams.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1989, there were nearly 60 singles that reached lucky No. 13, and it was a popular number for Bob Seger, who had two hits stop there, as did Kenny Rogers, Elton John and Natalie Cole. Van Halen had three songs reach No. 13 – “Right Where Ya Started,” and two from the album, 1984: “Panama” and the highly underrated “I’ll Wait.” Speaking of Van Halen, in 1983, future / former Van Halen lead singer, Sammy Hagar, reached No. 13 with his first Top 40 hit (and biggest solo hit), “Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy.”\n\nSome of my 80s favorites stopped at No. 13 too, like “Shadows Of The Night” by Pat Benatar, “All Over The World” by Electric Light Orchestra (from XANADU), “Back In The High Life Again” by Steve Winwood,” “One Night Love Affair” by Bryan Adams and “Don’t Come Around Here No More” by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers.\n\nNo. 13 must have been a favorite of mine for blog posts as well, as I’ve featured seven of them – “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” by Band Aid, “People Are People” by Depeche Mode, “Waiting On A Friend” by The Rolling Stones, “Where The Streets Have No Name” by U2, plus two of the three (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s that reached No. 13 – M|A|R|R|S (“Pump Up The Volume”) and Frida (“I Know There’s Something Going On”), and one song released in 1989, but peaked at No. 13 in March 1990 – “No Myth” by Michael Penn.\n\nAnother song that reached No. 13 on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in the 80s came out of Italy, by way of Northern Ireland. In the late 70s, Jimmy McShane (of Derry, Northern Ireland) was attending a stage school in London, learning how to dance and sing, when he was hired as a stage dancer and backing singer for English singer and musician, Dee D. Jackson. He toured around Europe with Dee D. and her band, and upon a visit to Italy, he fell in love with Italy’s underground dance scene, and the country itself, and ended up moving to Milan in 1984.\n\nIn Milan, he learned the Italian language, and in 1984, met up with Maurizio Bassi, who was a music producer and a musician. Together, they decided to form the New Wave / Dance band, Baltimora, with Jimmy McShane as the singer and the face of the band.\n\nIn early September 1985, they released their debut album, LIVING IN THE BACKGROUND, along with the first single from the album, “Tarzan Boy.” The catchy song about being free and doing whatever you want in the jungle, without the hustle and bustle of living in the city, took about a month and a half to find its way to the BILLBOARD Hot 100, but did find it in mid-October 1985, when it debuted at No. 80.\n\n“Tarzan Boy” steadily moved up the chart at first, but lost its chart “bullet” (for sales and airplay) in its sixth chart week, and stalled at No. 62 for three weeks. By early December 1985, “Tarzan Boy” had regained its bullet and started moving back up the Hot 100, reaching the Top 40 in mid-January 1986.\n\nBy March 1, 1986, “Tarzan Boy” had been on the chart for 20 weeks (longer than some No. 1 songs), and spent a week at No. 13. “Tarzan Boy” spent half a year on the survey and finished the year at No. 73.\n\nAround the globe, “Tarzan Boy” was a massive hit, reaching No. 1 in Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands and Spain, and the Top 10 in the U.K., Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the BILLBOARD Dance chart.\n\nDespite the success of “Tarzan Boy,” Baltimora had a hard time duplicating that success for its other singles and second album, 1987’s SURVIVOR IN LOVE. Following “Tarzan Boy,” the title track from their debut album, LIVING IN THE BACKGROUND, peaked at No. 87 on the Hot 100, and a few other singles reached the Top 40 singles chart in Italy, but nothing more. Baltimora broke up after the record label (in this case, Manhattan) dropped them.\n\nFast forward to 1993, and a new remix of “Tarzan Boy” was used in a Cool Mint Listerine commercial (with animation by future film giant, Pixar). Well, it didn’t stop there. “Tarzan Boy” was also featured that year in the film, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES III, and the combination of the two sent “Tarzan Boy” back onto the BILLBOARD Hot 100, re-entering the chart in late March 1993.\n\n“Tarzan Boy” climbed as high as No. 51 and spent 12 additional weeks on the Hot 100, and a total of 38 weeks combined. With new hits by Duran Duran, R.E.M., Madonna, INXS, New Order and Boy George’s Pet Shop Boys-produced theme to THE CRYING GAME, the 80s were still sticking around in 1993. But it was pretty cool to hear “Tarzan Boy” on the radio again.\n\nSadly, the following year, Jimmy McShane, the face of Baltimora, was diagnosed with AIDS while in Milan in 1994. A few months later, he returned to his hometown of Derry, Northern Ireland, the place where his family had shunned him many years before for being gay. He died in Derry in late March 1995 at the young age of 37. And, despite his family’s earlier stance towards Jimmy’s homosexuality, after his death, a family spokesperson said, “He faced his illness with courage and died with great dignity.”\n\nThe legacy of Jimmy and “Tarzan Boy” live on today, and the song continues to be covered by other artists and has appeared in films, like Seth MacFarlane’s 2014 film, A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST. And, “Tarzan Boy” is still heard on the radio today, as it should, because, who wouldn’t want to dance around to a fun, catchy song about being free and roaming around the jungle, removed from that city life?\n\n“Jungle life, I’m far away from nowhere / On my own like Tarzan Boy / Hide and seek, I play along while rushing ‘cross the forest / Monkey business on a sunny afternoon…”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r0n9Dv6XnY\n\nOn the day I graduated from high school in June 1985, if you had asked me who Kate Bush was, I wouldn’t have had any friggin’ idea. Thankfully, that all changed a few months later when I heard “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)” (from her brilliant 1985 album, HOUNDS OF LOVE).\n\nBy 1985, England’s Kate Bush had been releasing music since 1978, when, at the age of 19, her first album, THE KICK INSIDE, went Platinum and her first single, “Wuthering Heights,” spent four weeks at No. 1 in the U.K. (Kate was the first female recording artist to reach No. 1 on the U.K. singles chart with a self-written song).\n\n“Wuthering Heights” was based on the last 10 minutes of the 1967 BBC miniseries, which was based on the 1847 novel by Emily Brontë (who Kate Bush shares a birthday with – July 30th). Kate was discovered by Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour in the mid-70s, when she was just 16, and helped her record her demo tapes (and paid for them). EMI Records suggested Kate wait until she was 19 to release her first album, and the wait proved to be a smart move. Though not a success here in America (she sadly never really was), THE KICK INSIDE and “Wuthering Heights” were both huge global hits. Even Pat Benatar covered “Wuthering Heights” on her second album, 1980’s CRIMES OF PASSION.\n\nFast forward to September 1985, and 27-year-old Kate Bush had released her fifth album, the masterpiece HOUNDS OF LOVE. The acclaim for the album was almost universal, and here in the U.S., it became her highest-charting album, reaching No. 30 on BILLBOARD’s album chart. The original ROLLING STONE review for HOUNDS OF LOVE wasn’t impressive (“There’s no arguing that Bush is extraordinarily talented, but as with Jonathan Richman, rock’s other eternal kid, her vision will seem silly to those who believe children should be seen and not heard.” Ouch on both accounts; both Kate and Jonathan are awesome!!). However, THE ROLLING STONE ALBUM GUIDE later reversed that review, giving HOUNDS OF LOVE four out of five stars.\n\nThe first single from HOUNDS OF LOVE, “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God),” was released in early August 1985, more than a month before the album was released. EMI was reluctant to release a single with the use of “God” in the title, and wanted to release another song from the album, “Cloudbusting,” as the first single.\n\nEMI (and others along the way) misinterpreted the lyrics to the song, and why Kate named it the way she did. As she explained in a 1992 interview, “I was trying to say that, really, a man and a woman can’t understand each other because we are a man and a woman. And if we could actually swap each other’s roles, if we could actually be in each other’s place for a while, I think we’d both be very surprised! [she laughs]\n\n“And I think it would lead to a greater understanding. And really the only way I could think it could be done was either… you know, I thought a deal with the devil, you know. And I thought, ‘well, no, why not a deal with God!’ You know, because in a way it’s so much more powerful the whole idea of asking God to make a deal with you. You see, for me it is still called ‘Deal With God,’ that was its title. But we were told that if we kept this title that it would not be played in any of the religious countries, Italy wouldn’t play it, France wouldn’t play it, and Australia wouldn’t play it! Ireland wouldn’t play it, and that generally we might get it blacked purely because it had God in the title.”\n\nBut, Kate was persistent and persuaded the suits at EMI to release “Running Up That Hill” as the first single, since it was the first song written for the album. So, there was a compromise – on HOUNDS OF LOVE, the song’s title is listed in full as “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God),” and the single is just listed as “Running Up That Hill.”\n\nThe response in Kate’s U.K. homeland for “Running Up That Hill” was positive and immediate, and it debuted all the way up at No. 9 on the U.K. singles chart, on its way to a No. 3 peak, her second-highest charting U.K. hit, and her biggest U.K. hit released during the 80s.\n\n“Running Up That Hill” was a global success as well, reaching the Top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland, the Top 20 in Canada, and the Top 30 in Austria, France and New Zealand.\n\nOver here in the U.S., “Running Up That Hill” debuted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in early September 1985 at No. 95, and on this date in 1985 (10.19), it was still climbing the Hot 100. It reached the Top 40 two months after its Hot 100 debut, on its way to a No. 30 peak (like parent album, HOUNDS OF LOVE) in late November 1985, and would stay on the chart until mid-January 1986. It stayed on the Hot 100 for a total of 20 weeks, which is a longer chart stay than some songs that went to No. 1.\n\n“Running Up That Hill” was also one of those rare hits that appealed to both Dance and Rock fans, and reached No. 13 on BILLBOARD’s Dance chart and No. 34 on BILLBOARD’s Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nThe wonderful legacy of “Running Up That Hill” has continued for more than 30 years, and has been covered numerous times, including a 2003 cover by a Dutch Symphonic Metal band, Within Temptation, but my favorite cover version has to be the 2003 version by the London Alt-Rock band, Placebo. It’s one of the best 80s covers I’ve ever heard. In 2006, Placebo’s downbeat version was described by Q magazine as “sound[ing] more like a pact with the Devil’ than the original ‘deal with God’.” I love that. That version has also appeared on several TV shows and films.\n\nWhen EMI Records celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1997, HOUNDS OF LOVE was featured as part of their “EMI First Centenary” series, replete with B-sides and remixes. I was so excited to find this shortly after its release, and, it’s a disc I treasure dearly to this day. In fact, HOUNDS OF LOVE is one of my all-time favorite albums of any decade. And, from the first time I heard “Running Up That Hill,” I can safely say there’s been a thunder in my heart for Kate Bush ever since…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM\n\nOne of the first things I learned about WMPG community radio in Portland, Maine when I started my little 80s radio program, STUCK IN THE 80s, there in 1996 was the Begathon. WMPG gets approximately 1/3 of its funding from the University of Southern Maine, approximately 1/3 from underwriting, and approximately 1/3 from listener donations. A large chunk of the latter comes from the Begathon. What started out as a 2-week pledge drive in which volunteer radio hosts would “beg” to raise money for the station is now split up into two 1-week pledge drives, one in the Spring and one in the Fall. It’s come a long way since my first Begathon in the Fall of 1996. My very last Begathon for WMPG will be on Sunday, 9.25.2016.\n\nThe 80s gave us a bunch of songs titled “Call Me,” from the likes of Throwing Muses (off of their self-titled 1986 debut album), the Brooklyn Funk band Skyy (1981; No. 26, BILLBOARD Hot 100, No. 1 BILLBOARD R&B, No. 3 BILLBOARD Dance), Styx’s Dennis DeYoung (1986: No. 54 Hot 100), and Go West (from their self-titled 1985 debut album; No. 54 Hot 100, No. 7 Ireland, No. 10 New Zealand, No. 12 U.K. and Australia).\n\nYet, with all the songs named “Call Me,” no song was greater in the 80s (or prolly for all time) than Blondie’s “Call Me” (from the Richard Gere film, AMERICAN GIGOLO).\n\nBlondie had just debuted on the Hot 100 in early February 1980 with “The Hardest Part,” the second single from their 1979 album, EAT TO THE BEAT, but the week “Call Me” debuted on the chart (at No. 80), “The Hardest Part” stalled at No. 84. If it had been released a little earlier, maybe the chart run for “The Hardest Part” wouldn’t have been so hard. But, “Call Me” overshadowed it and then some. “Call Me” was so huge, it also outlasted the third and final single from EAT TO THE BEAT, the brilliant “Atomic,” which peaked at No. 39 while “Call Me” was still in the Top 30. “Atomic” sadly fell of the chart a couple weeks later.\n\n“Call Me,” produced by the amazing Giorgio Moroder and co-written with Debbie Harry, blasted onto the Top 40 within four weeks, and after 10 weeks, it reached No. 1 (after waiting four weeks for Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick In The Wall” to fall from No. 1). “Call Me” would spend six weeks at No. 1 in April / May 1980, spent nearly half a year on the chart, was certified Gold, and would go on to become the biggest American hit of that year.\n\nOn BILLBOARD’s Dance chart, “Call Me” spent four weeks at No. 2, and in 2015, it ranked at No. 54 on BILLBOARD’s Greatest All Time Hot 100 Singles list (and the eighth-biggest from the 80s; Olivia Newton-John’s 1981 / 1982 monster hit, “Physical,” the biggest song of the 80s, ranks at No. 8 on the entire list).\n\nAround the world, fans rang up the theme from AMERICAN GIGOLO in a big way, reaching No. 1 in Canada (four weeks) and the U.K. (one week), plus Top 10 rankings in Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Holland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland.\n\nI’ve always loved “Call Me” and love playing it around Begathon time (and will again). If I had to rank my favorite Blondie songs ever, I would say “Call Me” comes in at No. 5, a list led by “Dreaming” and “Atomic” (both from EAT TO THE BEAT), “Rapture” (from AUTOAMERICAN) and “Heart Of Glass” (from PARALLEL LINES).\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of Debbie Harry and Blondie, I remain forever grateful to my dear friend Shawn in New York, who, around this time in 2013, took me to see X and Blondie perform on the same bill at one of the last performances at the famed Roseland Ballroom (just outside of Times Square).\n\nAs I’m sure I’ve mentioned here (and as I’m sure I’ll mention again), when Debbie Harry appeared on stage, our school boy crushes for Debbie (who is a year older than my mother) came roaring back. She was sensational (as were the rest of Blondie and X). A concert I’ll never ever forget. And, on the off-chance Debbie is reading this, Maine (which includes yours truly) would still love to have you and the band come up here. Lots of great venues than there were just three years ago. So, if you’re interested, well, you know what to do…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH3Q_CZy968\n\nIn my last blog post from earlier today (9.17.2016), I talked about the English Progressive Rock band, Supertramp, and the departure of one of the band’s founders and co-frontmen, Roger Hodgson, in 1983. In 1984, Roger joined the club of nearly 500 artists who reached the BILLBOARD Hot 100 just one time. He did it with his moderate hit, “Had A Dream (Sleeping With The Enemy).”\n\nWell, that inspired today’s “song of the day.” After Roger’s departure from the band (who, at that point, had been situated out of Los Angeles for several years), Supertramp concentrated on their next album, BROTHER WHERE YOU BOUND, an album the band’s frontman, keyboardist and vocalist (and now sole writer) Rick Davies wanted to make since their last album, 1982’s …FAMOUS LAST WORDS…\n\nRick Davies wanted to get the band back to a more Progressive Rock sound than in previous efforts. A demo for the album’s title track was recorded for the last album, but differences between Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies prevented it from being on the album. For the new album, Supertramp recruited Thin Lizzy’s rhythm guitarist Scott Gorham and Pink Floyd’s legendary David Gilmour on the guitar solos. The song “Brother Where You Bound” wound up being 16-and-a-half minutes long.\n\nIn a 2012 piece about the album on the web ‘zine PROG SPHERE, it states that the title track “is a prime example of ‘crossover’ prog at its very best, and as such highly recommended to anyone but those prog fans who think that ‘pop’ is inevitably a bad word.\n\nSpeaking of “pop,” one song out of the six songs on BROTHER WHERE YOU BOUND, “Cannonball” (the album’s opening track), did manage to reach the BILLBOARD Hot 100. “Cannonball” debuted on the Hot 100 four months after the departure of Roger Hodgson’s lone solo hit, “Had A Dream.”\n\n“Cannonball” was well-received at first, reaching the Top 40 in just three weeks. But, unlike a cannonball, it slowed down after reaching the Top 40, and spent its second of two weeks at No. 28 on July 13th, 1985, the day of Live Aid. It dropped off after 12 short weeks, and to date, is the last song Supertramp has charted on the Hot 100. “Cannonball” did, however, return the band to BILLBOARD’s Mainstream Rock chart (No. 4), and even placed them on BILLBOARD’s Dance chart (No. 9), no easy trick.\n\nI love many songs by Supertramp, but prolly strangely enough to some, “Cannonball” remains my favorite song by them (or the seven-minute, 42-second album version anyway). I just love it. There are so many elements and layers to the song, and such great instrumentation. Rick Davies wrote and sang the song entirely in the chord of G minor. Now, I’m no musician, but it sounds like something that’s not normally done, at least not in 1985. He said in an interview, “I did it simply to see if it could be done.”\n\nAfter “Cannonball” and BROTHER WHERE YOU BOUND, the biggest noise Supertramp would make was on BILLBOARD’s Dance chart, where their song “I’m Begging You” (from their 1987 album, FREE AS A BIRD) would spend a week at No. 1 in January 1988, wedged inbetween Whitney Houston’s “So Emotional” and Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.” It sounded more like should have come out 1978 as opposed to 1988, but maybe that’s just me.\n\nSupertramp released two studio albums and four live albums after FREE AS A BIRD, but apart from a popular 2005 compilation, Supertramp never achieved international success again. They are still together, and were to have a 25-date European tour in 2015, but Rick Davies was sadly diagnosed with multiple myleoma (a cancer of plasma cells). I’m sure the band and fans around the world (including yours truly) are holding out hope for the recovery of Rick Davies.\n\nRick Davies, now 72, has sang lead on not only my favorite Supertramp song, but also great songs like their first hit, “Bloody Well Right” (No. 35, 1974), “My Kind Of Lady” (No. 31, 1983) and “Goodbye Stranger” (No. 15, 1979).\n\nWhen “Cannonball” was released, the song’s lyrics (like “I’m washing my hands on you / How could you be so untrue”) were, contrary to belief, not about Roger Hodgson, but instead (according to a French radio interview) a “less than perfect” concert promoter Rick Davies wouldn’t name.\n\n“Cannonball” may not have been Supertramp’s biggest or best hit, but it was released during the best year of my youth (a year of a lot of great music), and I still dig it (and still dig driving to it) to this day…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvfoyXfcwVU"
