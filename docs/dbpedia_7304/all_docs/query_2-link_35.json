        "text": "A number of years ago a poser posted the following :\n\n\"Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon holds the record for the most weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and is currently certified 15x Platinum (for sales of 15 million copies) by the Recording Industry Association of America, which is an impressive feat.\n\nBecause the RIAA does not automatically distribute gold and platinum awards (labels need to submit for them, at a cost), total sales for most albums are not truly represented by RIAA's tally.\n\nThe last time The Dark Side of the Moon was certified was in 1998 (19 years ago!), and the reason it hasn't reached 16x platinum isn't because it hasn't sold enough copies. On average, Dark Side still manages to sell 10,000 copies a week in the United States (roughly a half-million copies a year). In 2013, Soundscan had reported 9.5 million copies of Dark Side sold since 1991 when Soundscan started. In 1991, the album was certified 12x platinum.\n\n12 million (sales from 1973-1991)\n\n+ 9.5 million (sales from 1991-2013)\n\n+ 1.5 million (estimated sales since 2013)\n\n= 23 million.\n\nThis would place the album much higher on the list of top-selling LPs of all time.\n\nDoes anybody know the reason why it has been so long since The Dark Side of the Moon has been re-certified? Are they waiting for sales to surpass Thriller so they can surprise everyone and claim the title of best-selling album of all time?\"\n\nI can explain. In 2013, the distribution to Pink Floyd's catalog switched for a couple of years to Warner Music Group after the demise of EMI (as EMI sold the distribution of Pink Floyd's catalog to Warner Music Group) and then in 2015 Pink Floyd created Pink Floyd Records which is now distributed by Sony Music for all countries bar Europe where it remains Warner Music Group.\n\nIf I am an estimating person, I say Dark Side of the Moon's US sales are now in the 23-30 million bracket in the States as it has not been certified since 1998. Wish You Were Here's sales are now up as are Animals, The Wall and The Division Bell as all of aforementioned (especially Dark Side, Wish, Wall and Division all got box sets released in the last ten years). Am I right or wrong.\n\nI tend to think this kind of marketing doesn't matter. The album wouldn't see any more or any less if people knew others have bought it. People just buy it or they don't. And for the most part albums don't sell. It's a streamers world and album buyers are just living in it. So why spend the money for the certification? At this point the only people in the position to pay for the certification is Pink Floyd themselves. If they were still with Capitol or EMI, the label would likely have paid for it, as it boasts their credibility with getting new artists."
