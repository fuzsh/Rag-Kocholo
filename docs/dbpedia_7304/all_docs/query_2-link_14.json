Matter of fact, it's all dark.\"\n\nPink Floyd was an English Progressive Rock group consisting of guitarist/vocalist Syd Barrett (left during the recording of their second album, deceased), guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour (replaced Barrett), bassist/vocalist/lyricist Roger Waters (left to go solo after The Final Cut), keyboardist/vocalist Rick Wright (deceased), and drummer Nick Mason.\n\nTheir lyrics and their music changed drastically as the years went on. The band started in psychedelic rock and whimsical lyrics about childhood before heading towards more experimental progressive rock pieces. By the time of Meddle, they began to tone down the experimentalness and Epic Rocking, refining their signature sound and hitting the big time. The lyrics also began to become more weighty, mostly revolving around themes of isolation, death, insanity, and criticisms of modern society. The theme of isolation and society began to become more visible as Waters took more control of the band, and the band gained success with a series of complex Progressive Rock albums. Near the end of Waters' tenure with the band the music became heavier, more conventional and the lyrics became very personal. After Waters left, the rest of the band did a U-Turn and returned to their experimental sound; switching the lyrics to arguably focus on Gilmour's personal life instead.\n\nTheir guitarist, David Gilmour is widely considered one of the best rock guitarists ever, for his melodic solos and mastery of tone and vibrato; as well as his voice, which he sometimes uses to complement his guitar (singing either in unison or harmony with it). Roger Waters' lyrics are also held in high regard for their high quotient of satirical humour and general quotability, as are his strong basslines and his highly dramatic vocals. Keyboardist Rick Wright is the band's acknowledged \"secret weapon\" for his backing vocals (and occasional lead vocals) and jazz-influenced keyboard textures, which became a key component of the band's sound. Nick Mason...er, was the drummer. Mason gets very little (though not none at all) in the way of writing credits[1], vocal parts[2], or overall notice, but he ironically is the only member to have played on every Floyd record (Gilmour wasn't there for the first and Wright didn't play on The Final Cut). According to biographer Nicholas Schaffner, however, Mason was responsible for many of the band's signature sound effects.\n\nThe band's studio album discography is as follows:[]\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)\n\nA Saucerful of Secrets (1968)\n\nSoundtrack from the Film More (1969) *\n\nUmmagumma (1969)\n\nAtom Heart Mother (1970)\n\nMeddle (1971)\n\nObscured by Clouds (1972) *\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon (1973)\n\nWish You Were Here (1975)\n\nAnimals (1977)\n\nThe Wall (1979)\n\nThe Final Cut (1983)\n\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987)\n\nThe Division Bell (1994)\n\n(* ) Most fans also include More and Obscured by Clouds - soundtracks to two seldom seen French hippie films (films that are remembered solely because Pink Floyd did their soundtracks) - as a part of their studio album discography. It's actually pretty hard to find a few who don't, but those might get a little more frequent after Wiki/Wikipedia decided to remove them from the band's main discography and place them in a \"soundtracks section\".\n\nThe soundtrack to Zabriskie Point (1970) is also sometimes considered for inclusion [3] [4]\n\nThe 1992 box set Shine On, which collected and remastered their albums from Saucerful to Lapse, also had an extra disc named The Early Singles, which for the first time collected (in mono) their non-album singles and BSides that had previously been scattered around various compilations like Relics and Works.\n\nThe band has announced an expansive reissue of expanded versions of their albums for late 2011 and early 2012. The fans went wild.\n\nPink Floyd provides examples of:[]\n\nAlbum Title Drop: First, \"Brain Damage\":\n\nAnd if your head explodes with dark forbodings too\n\nI'll see you on the dark side of the moon\n\nThen, \"One Slip\":\n\nIt seems to take no time at all\n\nA momentary lapse of reason\n\nThat binds a life to a life\n\nAnd finally, \"High Hopes\":\n\nOur thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary\n\nThe ringing of the division bell had begun\n\nArtist Disillusionment: Two separate examples:\n\nSyd Barrett, while perfectly happy performing and being recognised in underground clubs, found wider fame, larger audiences and TV appearances harder to handle. He wanted to put a brake on their rise to fame, but the rest of the group disagreed, and it was impossible. Already a fan of psychedelic drugs, Syd began to take refuge in them, the whole thing eventually leading to his Creator Breakdown.\n\nRoger Waters suffered from the band’s mainstream success following Dark Side of the Moon, especially during the 1977 In The Flesh tour. The audiences became much bigger, and a lot noisier – the old psychedelic fans tended to keep quiet during the numbers, but the mainstream fans often spent the whole gig baying for \"Money\". The culmination of this came on the final show on 6 July 1977 in Montreal, where Waters stopped during \"Pigs on the Wing (Part II)\" to deliver this blistering tirade, and at the end spat in the face of a particularly disruptive fan he'd been irritated by (the incident and his subsequent thought about building a wall between himself and the audience inspired The Wall). The resulting crowd surges and heavier crowd control techniques also made their mark: the bursting door, riot police and dog patrols portrayed during the \"In the Flesh?\" concert sequence in The Wall were all based on things he had witnessed while they toured stadiums in the US. Other negative issues were driven to the surface, including his disgust at the greedy bureaucrats who ran the record industry (particularly explicit in \"Welcome to the Machine\" and \"Have a Cigar\"), his anger at the leaders who send men (like his father) to die in wars, and despair at society in general. Ultimately, it drove him to leave Pink Floyd. He’s now much less unhappy working a solo career and playing to more specialised audiences.\n\nAuthor Appeal: There's a moderately well known joke about the eras of the band. There are 3 eras of Pink Floyd, the Syd Barrett Era, The Roger Waters era and the David Gilmour era. There are 3 main motifs for each era:\n\nSyd\n\nI rather enjoy rock and volume.\n\nI rather enjoy taking drugs.\n\nListen your milk! DO YOU GET IT!? If a translations of the preasing aboutside your bed! That's what I'm talking grammar, then up! That to urink to place little, where Kauderwelsch still in determined by the middle in the language the translation firemen HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nRoger Waters\n\nMy father died in WW2 and I'm still a bit angry about that.\n\nThe Who ended all their rock operas with a rebirth of fascism, so I'll just do that in mine.\n\nMy goodness, Syd did enjoy his drugs.\n\nDavid Gilmour\n\nIf I don't do what Roger did, the gravy train will come to a screaming bloody halt.\n\nIf I don't do what Roger did, it will be beyond my musical capacity.\n\nHoly chickenpickin' son of an ass, did Syd like drugs!\n\nThe conclusion to this little thing-a-ma-diddley? David should be given a gold watch and a CD of African rhythms, Roger should be given a puppy, and it's far too late to give Syd anything.\n\nAuthor Tract: The Final Cut gets pretty Anvilicious at times, making Waters' anti-war, anti-authoritarian views pretty clear. Invoked to a lesser extent in Animals and The Wall as well. However, the popularity of the latter two albums suggests that many listeners find them to be examples of Some Anvils Need to Be Dropped and Tropes Are Not Bad.\n\nThe Band Minus the Face: An Averted Trope twice. Whether the leader is Syd Barrett, Roger Waters or David Gilmour, the records just keep selling. Indeed, as noted above, the only member to stay with the band the whole time is Nick Mason, who listeners are least likely to remember. It probably helped that the band set out not to have a \"face.\"\n\nTrue, yet amazingly so. Mason's drum intro to Time is iconic, to say the least, yet most listeners who are not drummers probably do not know the guys' name.\n\nBlack Sheep Hit: \"Money\", \"Another Brick in the Wall (Pt. 2)\" and \"Learning to Fly\", their best known songs and biggest pop hits, are totally unrepresentative of the band's sound.\n\nThe Blank: The interior art of Wish You Were Here depicted a faceless man in the desert dressed in business attire and hawking Pink Floyd records.\n\nBook Ends: Dark Side of the Moon(a heartbeat), Wish You Were Here (\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\"), Animals (\"Pigs on the Wing\"), The Wall (the coda of \"Outside the Wall\" segues into the opening of \"In The Flesh?\" and there's a faintly audible voice saying \"Isn't this where we came in?\" broken up between the end of the last song and the beginning of the first).\n\nBoxed Set: Three of them - 1992's Shine On (which is mentioned below in greater detail in Greatest Hits Album), 2008's Oh, By the Way (which collects all of the band's studio albums, which are housed in elaborate CD-sized facsimiles of the original vinyl packaging) and 2011's Why Pink Floyd? Discovery edition set.\n\nBunny Ears Lawyer: Syd. After being chucked from Pink Floyd, his two solo albums showed that - even after having gone crazy - he was still a capable, witty songwriter. The band themselves were very worried about continuing without Syd, as he had been writing almost all of the band's songs at that point. Waters and Gilmour helped produce Syd's first album and Gilmour and Wright his last, wanting to help their friend.\n\nOne suggestion was that David would tour and record with the band, while Syd would keep writing their songs and sing on the albums, like Brian Wilson's relationship with The Beach Boys around the same time. The idea failed after Syd infamously taunted them with the unlearnable \"Have You Got It, Yet?\". Waters noted that at the time Syd was kicked out of the band, \"he was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him.\"\n\nCareful with That Axe: Trope Namer.\n\nCluster F-Bomb: \"Not Now John.\"\n\nConcept Album: Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, The Final Cut, to some extent The Division Bell.\n\nControl Freak: Roger Waters. If David Gilmour is to be believed, his control-freak mode kicked in around 1977's Animals. It Got Worse with The Wall, which was almost entirely his writing, and culminated in The Final Cut, which infamously had something to the effect of \"Written by Roger Waters; performed by Pink Floyd\" printed in the liner notes. Then he left the band and instigated a series of lawsuits involving who had the right to use the Animals pig and whether the rest of the band had the right to use the name \"Pink Floyd.\"\n\nBy a different standpoint, the other members of Pink Floyd, not inclined as natural writers, fell into writer's block, drug addictions, power struggles, marital conflicts and the distractions of fame not long after The Dark Side Of The Moon was a smash. By Wish You Were Here the band signed a multi-million dollar contract with Columbia Records in the US (they felt DSOTM and their earlier work were poorly promoted by their previous American label), and the pressure was on to deliver albums and tour. Roger, in a sense, took over creative control to keep things together. He also had a hard time reconciling his fame with his Socialistic viewpoints, and could not relate to the material pursuits of his colleagues. He was growing increasingly impatient with his bandmates' lack of input, Creative Differences, their battles for writing and production credits for what little they did contribute compared to Waters, and it didn't help when the internal conflicts worsened while the band's managers squandered the band's money and The Wall was make-or-break and due out in a short period of time. Roger, perhaps, came down too hard on Gilmour, Wright and Mason in order to keep the internal drama from, er, dismantling The Wall, but they would arguably have been at a standstill in 1974 without his iron fist.\n\nCreator Breakdown: Syd Barrett, referenced in the song \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". In a truly ironic coincidence, he actually showed up at its recording session, more insane than his former bandmates had ever remembered.\n\nMore a case of It Got Worse. He had become obese over the years, shaved off his hair and eyebrows and become even more secluded. He had to leave the studio when both Waters and Richard Wright broke down in tears.\n\nThe whole band while making Wish You Were Here. Not only were they trying to follow up a massive hit album, Roger and Nick were both going through divorces.\n\nDarker and Edgier: The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nAnd it just got darker and edgier from there, until Waters' departure from the band. Then it became Lighter and Softer (lyrically, at least, though later songs like \"Sorrow\" can be pretty dark too).\n\nDemoted to Extra: This happened twice. The first was with Syd Barrett when his erratic behavior jeopardized the band and David Gilmour was brought in. He only appears on three songs on A Saucerful of Secrets[5]. The second time was when Waters actually fired Rick Wright during the sessions for The Wall, but was brought back as a touring keyboardist.\n\nDissonant Serenity: Well, many songs, but in particular \"Speak To Me\" (\"I've always been mad, I know I've been mad...\")\n\nAlso The Wall, which can be seen as Roger Waters' own Creator Breakdown.\n\nDistinct Double Album: One of the discs of Ummagumma is studio, one is live. Also, The Wall.\n\nWould The Wall count though? It's still the same story.\n\nDo Not Call Me Paul: Barrett, later in life, refused to answer to \"Syd,\" preferring to be addressed by his birth name, Roger.\n\nDystopia: Animals (which is kinda based in another dystopia) and The Wall.\n\nEpic Rocking: Lots of it, starting with \"Interstellar Overdrive\", culminating in epics like the 23 minute \"Echoes\" and the 25 minute \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", although the latter is split into two parts.\n\nAlso notable is the album Animals, which has two parts of a short song (\"Pigs on the Wing\") as Book Ends to three very long songs (\"Dogs\", \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\" and \"Sheep\").\n\nEven the Guys Want Him: David Gilmour. No, seriously. Why do you think he's cited as a common cause of Stupid Sexy Flanders?\n\nFun fact: Gilmour was very briefly a male model in his pre-Floyd days.\n\nSyd also qualified:\n\nPeter Jenner: Syd was a handsome boy, he was beautiful and one more part of the tragedy is that he became such a fat slob, he became ugly. He was true flower power. He came out in this outrageous gear, he had this permanent, which cost 20 pounds at the time, and he looked like a beautiful woman, all this Thea Porter stuff. He had a lovely girlfriend, Lindsay, she was the spitting image of Syd.\n\nEverything's Better with Cows: The cover of Atom Heart Mother.\n\nExactly What It Says on the Tin: \"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict\".\n\nThe Faceless: The mere fact that anyone aside from die-hard fans know who any of the band members are is a development as recent as 1987. Before then, they were one of the most famous bands that the average rock fan couldn't name or identify the members in a picture if they tried. This was aided by their show-stealing lighting and stage effects, and abetted by them staying off the record covers from Atom Heart Mother on. Legendarily, the band would go into the common area of arenas for a drink during intermission and no one ever recognized one of them.\n\nFace Heel Turn: After Syd Barrett lost his mind and left the band, the band became a lot more angsty and proggy than they had been in the Syd Era, mainly due to Roger Water's anger over his father's death as well as his grief over the 'death' of the Syd he knew. This is where The Wall came from.\n\nFading Into the Next Song: All of Pink Floyd's songs from Dark Side of the Moon to The Final Cut. Okay, there are some that are isolated on those albums (Usually where the A side of the LP ended), but the technique is dominant.\n\nFor Doom the Bell Tolls: \"High Hopes\".\n\nFour More Measures: \"Time\", noted for its overly long intro section.\n\nFun with Acronyms: \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\".\n\nGarfunkel: Nick Mason is kinda this. Of course, he's the only member of the band to be in the group continuously since its founding. But his songwriting contribution has always been minimal (only two are solely credited to him; and one, DSOTM's \"Speak to Me\", wasn't even by him, Roger just gave it to him), though many of the band's trademark sound effects have been his ideas. Mason also wrote - without the aid of a ghost writer - Inside Out, the definitive official autobiography of the band.\n\nGetting Crap Past the Radar: In \"Money,\" David Gilmour blatantly says \"bullshit,\" yet the word remained uncensored on most radio stations, until the FCC started cracking down on broadcasters after Janet Jackson's \"Wardrobe Malfunction\".\n\nGratuitous Japanese: The Japanese release of Meddle changed the track name of \"One of These Days\" to 吹けよ風、呼べよ嵐 (fuke yo kaze, yobe yo arashi), or \"Blow, Wind! Call Forth, Storm!\"\n\nGratuitous Panning: \"Interstellar Overdrive,\" dear God, \"Interstellar Overdrive\".\n\nGreatest Hits Album: Six of them:\n\nRelics (1971): contains largely Syd-era material and non-album singles like \"See Emily Play\". Also, its the only album in print which contains the studio version of fan favorite \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\".\n\nA Collection of Great Dance Songs (1981): The band's first real greatest hits album. Contains only six songs. Infamously, one of them is a rerecorded version of \"Money\" with David Gilmour playing every instrument except for the saxophone (which is played by Dick Parry, as on the original recording). \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" and \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)\" are represented by edits. It sold decently, but even the band hates it now.\n\nWorks (1983): A cash in by the band's former label Capitol Records on the then-upcoming release of The Final Cut. It contains a perplexing tracklist of pre-Wish You Were Here material and the compilation rarity \"Embryo\".\n\nShine On (1992): A box set, the idea of which was that the band's \"greatest hits\" were actually whole albums. Consisted of A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and - for collector's bait - a CD containing all of the band's 1967-1969 singles. That exclusive CD, The Early Singles is still the only place to find such rarities as \"Point Me at the Sky\" and \"It Would Be So Nice\" on CD (most of the others can be found on either Relics or the 2007 re-release of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn).\n\nEchoes: The Best of Pink Floyd (2001). A 2-disc compilation that was intended to be \"definitive\" as far as Pink Floyd greatest hits albums go. Features a reasonable career-spanning tracklist for the first time, but caused some controversy for some rather unorthodox edits of some songs (notably \"Marooned\", which is morphed into Album Filler). However, the songs in the compilation were edited in a way so that they seamlessly flow into the next song, even though many of the songs are decades apart (1973's \"Money\" turns into 1994's \"Keep Talking\" and 1987's \"Learning to Fly\" morphs into 1967's \"Arnold Layne\"). Its the band's fifth best selling album.\n\nA Foot in the Door: The Best of Pink Floyd (2011). A single disc collection that will accompany the 2011 reissue of their discography.\n\nGrand Finale: High Hopes, the last song on The Division Bell, and the last Pink Floyd song ever written, is said to be an autobiography of the bands history.\n\nGuest Star Party Member: When it came time to record \"Have a Cigar\", Roger Waters had blown his voice recording \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" and David Gilmour declined to sing, so the group recruited folk singer Roy Harper to sing lead.\n\nThe only other song with vocals by a Guest Star Party Member being Clare Torry's vocals on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\n\nRoger Waters: Alan [Parsons] suggested Clare Torry. I've no idea whose idea it was to have someone wailing on it. Clare came into the studio one day, and we said, \"There's no lyrics. It's about dying — have a bit of a sing on that, girl.\" I think she only did one take. And we all said, \"Wow, that's that done. Here's your sixty quid.\"\n\nHeartbeat Soundtrack: Several times on Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nI Am the Band: In 1983, Roger Waters quit the band and declared that Pink Floyd had disbanded. When Gilmour/Mason/Wright disagreed, he sued over the rights to the Pink Floyd name, ultimately losing and eventually regretted suing the other members.\n\nIt Got Worse: The band's misfortunes piled on to the point of absurdity.\n\nKilled Mid-Sentence: In \"The Final Cut\", the line that goes \"And if I'm in I'll tell you what's behind the wall\" has a gunshot going off after \"I'll tell you\", suggesting that whoever was trying to say this line was shot.\n\nLarge Ham: From Animals onward, Roger took control and most of the songs were performed by him. Usually with extreme bombast.\n\nLaughing Mad: \"Brain Damage\" has some of this in the background.\n\nList Song: \"Eclipse\" and \"What Shall We Do Now?\", as well as the final part of \"Dogs\".\n\nLimited Special Collectors Ultimate Edition: Too many to count. It seems like they've released every possible thing you could ever want to have by these guys, (let alone the ENTIRE EMI library) but the newest re-release is just too much. For Dark Side Of The Moon alone, in the immersion edition, you'll get 3 cd's, 2 DVD's, 1 Blu-ray disk, big-ass 40-page booklet, a photo booklet, an art print, 5 \"collectible cards,\" a replica ticket and backstage pass to a DSOTM show, a scarf, 3 \"designer\" marbles, 9 special coasters, and a credits booklet. That's justthe first one being released.\n\nLong Runner Lineup: The classic lineup of David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Richard Wright and Nick Mason lasted from 1968 to 1979, ending when Roger Waters fired Richard Wright during the recording of The Wall. Keyboard duties on The Final Cut were filled by Oscar-nominated composer Michael Kamen. Wright returned to the band in 1986, after Waters had quit the band - and this three piece line-up (with Waters' bass and singing filled by hired musicians) also lasted 10 years.\n\nLong Title: \"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict\".\n\nMagical Native American: In the video for \"Learning To Fly\".\n\nMahjong: The band members were supposedly fond of this game. A Pillow of Winds refers to one of the many possible hands in it.\n\nMan On Fire: The cover of Wish You Were Here has a picture of two businessmen shaking hands with one of them on fire, which is a visual metaphor for being burned in the music industry.\n\nMeaningful Background Event: Someone apparently blows up an airplane in the background of \"On The Run\". In some stage shows, a model airplane would fly across the stage and explode at the end of the song.\n\nMessy Pigs: \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\". Honorable mention to the inflatable pigs they employed on the album cover image for Animals and in concerts thereafter, especially since the cover model broke free from its moorings during shooting and drifted across flight paths, and one of the prop pigs exploded on tour. [6]\n\nMind Screw: \"Echoes\", particularly the line \"I am you and what I see is me\"\n\nMoney Song: \"Money\".\n\nThe Movie: Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii and Pink Floyd: The Wall.\n\nMythology Gag: \"By the way, which one's Pink?\" was a real question by a music agent.\n\nNon-indicative Title: The 1981 compilation album A Collection of Great Dance Songs, which consists of six songs which, much like everything else in Floyd's catalogue, are impossible to dance to. The album cover lampshades the title, featuring a waltzing couple immobilized by guy wires.\n\nOne-Woman Wail: \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\n\nPanty Thief: \"Arnold Layne\".\n\nPast in The Rearview Mirror: \"Two Suns in the Sunset\".\n\nPrecision F-Strike: Besides the \"bullshit\" in \"Money\", \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\" has \"You fucked up old hag!\"\n\nThere are only two songs with serious expletives in The Wall: one occurs in \"Nobody Home\" (\"I've got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from\") and the other in \"The Trial\" (\"You little shit...\" and \"Go on, Judge! Shit on 'im!\")\n\nThe demo for \"The Show Must Go On\" had one in there, plus a few more verses.\n\n\"Lost For Words\" from The Division Bell has an f-bomb at the end.\n\nLet's not forget the early B-side \"Candy and a Currant Bun,\" in which the line \"Please, just fuck with me\" is rumoured to have been inserted as a Take That at the label for censoring the original title of the song (\"Let's Roll Another One\", an obvious drug reference).\n\nPretty Boy: David Gilmour in Floyd's heyday. Though in the '80s he gained a pot belly and eventually didn't age very well.\n\nIronically, horse-faced Roger Waters aged with more grace. He now eerily resembles a certain actor...\n\nWhat about Syd? He was gorgeous back in the day! He was, literally a live-action, real-life Bishounen.\n\nPut on a Bus: Syd Barrett, after the sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets and Richard Wright, during the sessions for The Wall.\n\nThe Bus Came Back: Barrett's two 1970 solo albums, which - despite his less than perfect mental state - contained some very good songs. Unfortunately by 1972, he'd completely lost even his ability to write a cracking song and back on the bus he went.\n\nRichard Wright also came back (though not as an official member, for legal reasons, until 1994) when he was rehired by Gilmour and Mason during the sessions for A Momentary Lapse of Reason. He had apparently been fired due to a combination excessive cocaine use (referenced in \"Nobody Home\") and a fight with Roger over his refusal to cut his vacation short after the album turned out to be behind schedule.\n\nAccording to Mason's book, Syd's departure from the band was actually a literal inversion: the rest of the band were in the tour bus on their way to a gig in Southampton, knew that Syd would probably just stand on stage and stare at the audience for the entire show, and when someone in the van asked if they should pick him up, the response was \"No, fuck it, let's not bother.\"\n\nThe Quiet One: Rick Wright, as noted by his fellow band members, who also credits him for forming much of the band's sound picture.\n\nRavens and Crows: In the middle of Echoes and later in Poles Apart, the latter also crosses over into a Circus of Fear.\n\nThe bird sounds in Echoes are actually an electric guitar plugged into a wah pedal the wrong way.\n\nReclusive Artist: Syd Barrett.\n\nRefrain From Assuming: It's called \"Brain Damage\", not \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". Similarly, \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\" is not \"We Don't Need No Education\" and \"Learning to Fly\" is not \"Tongue Tied And Twisted\".\n\nSampling: The TV broadcasts used in certain songs on The Wall. The \"radio bridge\" between \"Have a Cigar\" and the title track on Wish You Were Here. The gunnery and motorbike sounds on Atom Heart Mother. The Russian voice with the Morse code on \"Astronomy Domine\". The British Telecom advert (featuring the synthetic voice of Stephen Hawking) in \"Keep Talking\" (it also provided the title).\n\nSanity Slippage Song: Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall are both sanity slippage albums.\n\nShine On You Crazy Diamond was about (the late) Syd Barret's general craziness, before he left. He showed by sheer accident while the rest of the band was recording the song, and no one recognized him. He was more crazy than when he left, and he was pretty damn crazy and stoned out of his balls when he was in the band to begin with.\n\nScatting: \"The Great Gig In The Sky\", \"A Saucerful of Secrets\", \"Atom Heart Mother\", \"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict\", \"Pow R Toc H\"...\n\nThere's also \"Corrosion in the Pink Room\", an experimental track from their Dork Age.\n\nShout-Out: There's a pretty blatant one in \"Let There Be More Light\" from A Saucerful of Secrets.\n\nThe outer lock rolled slowly back, the servicemen were heard to sigh.\n\nFor there revealed in flowing robes was Lucy in the sky.\n\nThe bass-only bridge of \"One of These Days\" includes a quote from the Doctor Who theme.\n\nThe inflatable pig from the Animals album cover is floating above Battersea Power Station - converted into humanity's last museum - for the film Children of Men.\n\nTowards the end of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI - X)\", the melody of the first line of \"See Emily Play\" is played during the keyboard outtro.\n\nTwo comic book characters: Dan Dare in \"Astronomy Domine\" and Doctor Strange in \"Cymbaline\".\n\nSiamese Twin Songs: \"Brain Damage\" and \"Eclipse\".\n\nSlasher Smile: Roger Waters. Along with other Ax Crazy antics.\n\nSo What Do We Do Now?: Pretty much the state of mind of the band just before and during the early sessions for Wish You Were Here.\n\nDavid Gilmour: It was a very difficult period I have to say. All your childhood dreams had been sort of realized and we had the biggest selling records in the world and all the things you got into it for. The girls and the money and the fame and all that stuff [...E]verything had sort of come our way and you had to reassess what you were in it for thereafter, and it was a pretty confusing and sort of empty time for a while.\n\nSoprano and Gravel: David Gilmour sings in an instantly recognizable soft tenor. While Roger Waters does complement this pretty well in harmony, his voice is more nasal and often has a less melodic approach. The same could be said for their tendencies as songwriters - Waters-era Floyd's anger and angst versus Gilmour-era mellowness.\n\nA more extreme example would be Dave's tenor versus Roger's screaming.\n\nSpoken Word in Music + Sound FX Tropes: The band were famous in their heyday for frequently integrating spoken word bits and sound effects into their music. Great examples of these would be Dark Side of the Moon - boasting spoken parts obtained by interviewing people associated with the band or working in the studio, the heartbeat Book Ends, \"On the Run\" and the collage at the start of \"Money\" -, the mechanic effects from \"Welcome to the Machine\", the radio tuning of \"Wish You Were Here\", the Psalm 23 parody from \"Sheep\" and The Wall, which takes Dark Side's effects and spoken word bits and just runs all the way with them - evil schoolmasters, enthusiastic groupies, Stuka dive-bombers, helicopters, airport announcements, skidding tires, crowd chanting, ambient noises, and more.\n\nThe band also had the tendency to indulge in a sort of musical form of Prop Recycling by reusing sound effects and other bits on their albums, almost as a Continuity Nod. For example, aside from the Book Ends, the submarine \"ping\" from \"Echoes\" shows up in \"Hey You\", the \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" scream is re-used in \"Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2\", \"Run Like Hell\" and \"Two Suns in the Sunset\", the distorted whale-noise from \"Echoes\" is used in \"Is There Anybody Out There?\", and probably the most extreme example, The Final Cut cannibalizes sound effects from Meddle, Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall.\n\nAnd tying that into the He Also Did entry in the Trivia tab - that approaching helicopter sound at the start of \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\"? Reused in Kate Bush's song \"Experiment IV\". Supposedly, her engineers just couldn't duplicate the overwhelming sound so she just borrowed the actual original effect from Roger.\n\nStep Up to the Microphone: Richard Wright sings many songs, and Nick Mason has two B-sides.\n\nTake That: Waters took shots at his former bandmates in his 1986 song, \"Towers of Faith\":\n\nHe said, \"I see you, you thief!\"\n\nThis land is my land\n\nAnd this sand is my sand\n\nAnd this band is my band\n\nAnd again, with a merchandise t-shirt sold at all his solo gigs (started during Waters' Radio KAOS tours), directing a famous line from \"Have a Cigar\" against the resurrected Floyd: - \"Oh, by the way, which one's Pink?\".\n\nHe also took shots at producer Bob Ezrin (who produced The Wall and A Momentary Lapse of Reason at the time) in his 1992 song, \"Too Much Rope\":\n\nEach man has his price Bob\n\nAnd yours was pretty low\n\nHe ALSO took shots at a British composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, whom he accused of ripping-off some early Floyd melodies, in song \"It's A Miracle\" (same album as \"Too Much Rope\", coincidentally?)\n\nWe cower in our bunkers with our fingers in our ears,\n\nAs Lloyd Webber's awful stuff runs on for years and years and years,\n\nAn earthquake strikes the theatre, but the operetta lingers,\n\nAnd then the piano lid falls and it breaks his fucking fingers.\n\nIt's a miracle...\n\nThe Sun reported that Waters had over 150 rolls of toilet paper with Gilmour's face printed on every sheet. Waters would deny this, but admitted that it was a great idea.\n\nDavid Gilmour also took a shot of his own at Roger Waters in the song \"You Know I'm Right\" from his solo album About Face and \"Lost For Words\" from Division Bell:\n\nSo I open my door to my enemies\n\nAnd I ask could we wipe the slate clean\n\nBut they tell me to please go fuck myself\n\nYou know you just can't win\n\nThe Final Cut, directed at England in general for its involvement in The Falklands War.\n\nIn the song \"Not Now John\", from that same album, Waters expressed his displeasure with Alan Parker, who directed the movie version of The Wall:\n\nNot now, John, I've gotta get on with the film show\n\nHollywood awaits at the end of the rainbow\n\nWho cares what it's about as long as the kids go\n\nRoger said that the cover of Atom Heart Mother and the final, underwater-themed lyrics of \"Echoes\" were meant as Take Thats against the space rock image they'd been associated with.\n\nEven Syd managed to squeeze in a couple. \"Jugband Blues\" has been interpreted as his way of \"thanking\" his band mates for kicking him out of the group. Also, the unreleased \"Vegetable Man\" could have been his view on the music industry; the title of the song referring to musicians being molded into mindless hit-making machines....eight years before the rest of the band tackled the subject with \"Welcome To The Machine\" and \"Have A Cigar\".\n\n\"Bob Dylan Blues\", too. Damn, Syd.\n\n\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\" takes shots at Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Thatcher is the subject of several more Take Thats on The Final Cut.\n\nTextless Album Cover: Most of them. The Wall and The Final Cut got titles in later prints.\n\nUncommon Time: \"Money\", \"Mother\", \"Two Suns in the Sunset\" and parts of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\".\n\nUr Example: On The Run's fast, manipulated synth loop is amazingly similar to the trademark sounds of House Music and Trance.\n\nAlso, it's very surprising how much of Syd Barrett's era sounds like punk (like, even more so than The Who), in spite of preceding it by almost a decade.\n\n\"The Villain Sucks\" Song: \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\". \"Villains\" because they're the ones popularly thought to be manipulating everything bad in the Animals album, and \"sucks song\" because unlike the thinly veiled satire of \"Dogs\" and \"Sheep\", \"Pigs\" pulls out the stops and outright insults the subjects from the start of and throughout the song.\n\nThe first two characters in the first two verses are ambiguous - it's usually assumed that the \"bus stop rat bag\" in the second verse is Margaret Thatcher, then just rising to power. Only the third verse clearly states who its specifically skewering - infamous British moral campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Some American viewers missed this reference and thought they were talking about the White House.\n\nVocal Evolution: Roger Waters' vocals became higher-pitched and nasal as time went on.\n\nNot to mention Waters' penchant for scream-singing, which carried on with gusto into his first solo albums.\n\nVocal Range Exceeded: \"Welcome to the Machine\", where one line required trickery to achieve the right pitch.\n\nDavid Gilmour: It was a line I just couldn't reach so we dropped the tape down half a semitone.\n\nWent to the Great X In the Sky: \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" is the 5th track on the 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nWord Salad Title: As with many bands of the time period, the name simply makes no sense whatsoever. The band's name was taken from two obscure American bluesmen - Pink Anderson and Floyd Council - who Syd Barrett had albums from in his record collection, taking the name only when the band found out they were sharing a bill with another band called The Tea Set, which was the band's name at the time. Barrett basically blurted out the new name and it seemed trippy enough that it stuck.\n\nWriter Revolt: Most of Wish You Were Here was inspired by the record label's pressure on a follow-up... which led to the scathing songs \"Have a Cigar\" and \"Welcome to the Machine\".\n\nWriting Around Trademarks: After Waters left, he retained the rights to the famous Pink Floyd Pig. The band just added testicles to it to distinguish it.\n\nMore so to not pay Roger royalties. Especially good timing as it was pointed out to Gilmour in an interview that by singing Waters' song live, he was paying royalties to Waters, which he could use to finance his lawyers to sue Gilmour and Mason.\n\nThe Delicate Sound of Thunder video did include a credit to Waters for the \"Original Pig Concept.\"\n\nThey put balls on my pig. Fuck 'em."
