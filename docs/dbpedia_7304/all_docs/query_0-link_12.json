The Early Years 1965-1972, a 27-disc box set featuring unreleased demos, TV appearances and more than 20 unreleased songs will hit stores on Nov. 11. Collected in 7 individual book-style packages, the set will bundle more than 15 hours of video, including rare BBC Sessions, live concert performances, interviews and 3 feature films: The Committee, More and La Vallée (Obscured by Clouds).\n\nPink Floyd’s First Four Albums Are Being Reissued on Vinyl\n\nPreviously unheard tracks in the bundle include 1967’s “Vegetable Man” and “In the Beechwoods,” which have been remixed for the release, as well as remixed and updated versions of the music from the film Zabriskie Point. A 2-CD highlights package, The Early Years — CRE/ATION, will be released on Nov. 11 as well through Pink Floyd Records; each box will also be released separately in 2017 with the exception of the bonus disc CONTINU/ATION, a CD/DVD/Blu-Ray collection that includes a disc of early BBC Radio session, the audio tracks from The Committee film, the band’s live soundtrack to the 1969 NASA moon landings and other extras.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nAlso included in the set will be collectable memorabilia and 7″ singles in replica sleeves of the songs: “Arnold Layne” with “Candy a Currant Bun,” “See Emily Play” with “The Scarecrow,” “Apples and Oranges” with “Paintbox,” “It Would Be So Nice” with “Julia Dream” and “Point Me At The Sky” with “Careful With That Axe, Eugene.” Other items in the set: an unreleased 1967 concert in Stockholm, recently discovered Capitol Records studio sessions, a restored promo clip of Point Me At The Sky, unreleased tracks from the More sessions, the first performance of Atom Heart Mother on the BBC featuring a choir and orchestra and new 5.1 audio mixes of Live at Pompeii.\n\nFollowing the death of keyboardist Richard Wright in 2008, Pink Floyd released what was labeled their final album, 2014’s mostly instrumental The Endless River."
