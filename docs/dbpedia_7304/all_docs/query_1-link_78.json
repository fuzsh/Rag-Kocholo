        "text": "Pink Floyd prevailed Thursday in a legal brawl with its label when a British judge ordered EMI to stop selling individual downloads of the acid-inspired group's songs without permission.\n\nThe artists behind The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, and other top sellers claimed its decade-old contract with EMI required the band's music to be sold as an entire album, not as single tracks in which EMI has permitted iTunes to distribute.\n\nHigh Court of Justice Judge Andrew Morritt of London agreed, ruling the 1999 agreement with EMI was crafted to \"preserve the artistic integrity of the albums.\"\n\nPink Floyd said its musical craft surrounding concept albums was being misrepresented when sold in singles. EMI claimed the contract allowed digital sales of Pink Floyd music, even one song at a time.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon turned 37 years old on Wednesday. Wired's Underwire blog declared it \"Earth's reigning concept album.\"\n\nPhoto: wonderferret/Flickr\n\nSee Also:\n\nPink Floyd, EMI Brawl Over iTunes Royalties\n\nPink Floyd's Dark Side Eclipses Concept Album Classics\n\nMay 12, 1967: Pink Floyd Astounds With 'Sound in the Round'\n\nPink Floyd's 'Echoes' = 2001's Space Baby?\n\nRIP: Pink Floyd's Richard Wright\n\nPink Floyd Wins A Polar!
