        "text": "“Hey You,” guess what? Pink Floyd is releasing its first album in 20 years.\n\nIn a sign that the band has adapted to the times, singer and guitarist David Gilmour’s wife dropped the news on Twitter over the weekend.\n\nSee video: Former Journey Frontman Steve Perry Performs for First Time in 19 Years (Video)\n\nThe album is called “The Endless River,” and should be getting released in October, Polly Samson (pictured above alongside Gilmour) wrote on Saturday.\n\nShe described it as “Rick Wright’s swansong and very beautiful.”\n\nWright was the band’s keyboardist and a founding member. He died of cancer in 2008.\n\nAlso read: Katy Perry Launches New Label, Metamorphosis Music, With Capitol Records\n\nAccording to Durga McBroom-Hudson, a singer who toured with Pink Floyd in previous decades and posted a photo on Facebook of herself working on “Endless River” in studio with Gilmour, the album is based on earlier recordings dating back to sessions for the band’s last studio album, “The Division Bell.”\n\n“David and Nick [Mason] have gone in and done a lot more since then,” McBroom-Hudson wrote. “It was originally to be a completely instrumental recording, but I came in last December and sang on a few tracks. David then expanded on my backing vocals and has done a lead on at least one of them.”"
