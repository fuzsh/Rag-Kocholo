        "text": "Text - Tower Records:\n\nIn 1967 and early 1968, the text at the bottom edge of Tower Records labels read:\n\n\"Mfd. in U.S.A.\"\n\nIn August 1968, the text on Tower Records labels was changed to read:\n\n\"Manufactured in the U.S.A. by Capitol Records, Inc.\"\n\nIn approximately mid-1969, the text on Tower Records labels was changed to read:\n\n\"Mfd. by Capitol Records, Inc, a subsidiary of Capitol Industries, Inc. U.S.A.\"\n\nLacquer or cutting. The codes used by Columbia Records for their lacquers are the letters A through L*, excluding the letter I:\n\nA=1\n\nB=2\n\nC=3\n\nD=4\n\nE=5\n\nF=6\n\nG=7\n\nH=8\n\nJ=9\n\nK=10\n\nL=11\n\nAfter L, the letters are doubled: AA through AL would be 12 through 22, BA through BL would be 23 through 33, and so on.\n\n* Letters M and N were brought into use in the 1980s.\n\nNote: It is important to note that these letters do not necessarily indicate which pressings were made first (a 1A record is not necessarily an earlier pressing than a 1E record). Columbia Records would often cut six (or more) lacquers at the same time for Pink Floyd, due to the high demand for their records. Multiple lacquers would be cut and sent to various pressing plants so that they could have more than one plant pressing the records at the same time. And if a part was blown in processing, the next higher number would then be used, so even a first pressing run could have numbers higher than 1 or 2.\n\nThe coding of the lacquers with letters allowed the lacquers to be assigned to different pressing plants. For example (and this varied over the years), A and B lacquers were sent to the Santa Maria, California pressing plant, C and D lacquers were sent to the Terra Haute, Indiana pressing plant, E and F laquers were sent to the Pitman, New Jersey pressing plant, and G and H were sent to the the Carrollton, Georgia plant. Thus a record with a 1A in the matrix could easily have been pressed at the same time as a record with a 1B in the matrix. They were just pressed at different pressing plants.\n\nSome of the Columbia mastering engineers, and their [matrix signatures] are:\n\nChet Bennett [Chet or CB in a circle]\n\nBarry Griffin [Barry]\n\nAnna Pate [Anna]\n\nExample - Columbia Records: The matrix information, AL 33453-2A, found on one side of a particular pressing of Wish You Were Here indicates:\n\nAL is a prefix code used by Columbia Records. (AL was used for side 1 of the album, while BL was used for side 2.)\n\n33453 is the mastering job number (as well as the catalog number).\n\nThe 2A shows both the tape used (2), and the cutting (A). In this instance, the lacquer was cut using a second tape (perhaps a slightly different mix or equalization than tape #1), and it is the \"A\" cutting made from that tape."
