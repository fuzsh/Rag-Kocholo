        "text": "2003-07-03 05:57:28\n\nI understand that the EMI ones marked 1992/1994 are the best quality... I would like to replace some of my 1997 Columbia versions with these if possible. I have a few questions:\n\n1) Are they still being made? I find them once in a while, but the 1997 Columbia remasters are far more common.\n\n2) Dark Side of the Moon doesn't even seem to have a 1997 version, just a dateless \"Capitol\" version and of course the shitty new hybrid release. Was there ever an EMI version of this disc at all? When did this Capitol one come out, anyway?\n\n3) Any of them besides DSoM (and of course Division Bell, it is too new) NOT come out on a 1992/1994 EMI release?\n\n4) If I try to just track down the boxset for convenience, which discs are in it?\n\nThank you and goodnight!\n\np.s.

When I bought it I didn't even know it was the best Floyd remaster.\n\nI was starting my Floyd collection back then, and I didn't have any of the CDs in the set, so it looked like a nice deal for me.\n\nBut yeah, that's definitely for hardcore fans only.\n\nQuote\n\nMaybe the next media standard at 96kHz & 32 bits could be worth it\n\nWell, I have the The Dark Side of The Moon SACD. :B\n\nRegards;\n\nRoberto.\n\nGet up-to-date binaries of Lame, AAC, Vorbis and much more at RareWares:\n\nhttp://www.rarewares.org\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #5 – 2003-07-03 07:07:06\n\nIf you already own the 1997 Columbia remasters, there is no need to upgrade; they use the same digital transfers as the 1992/1994 EMI releases - and so, for that matter, do the 1992/1994 Capitol discs - which were in turn licensed to Columbia for their 1997 reissues (... and which have since reverted to EMI). You can find the complete, annotated Pink Floyd discography - for every country and pressing imaginable - here, but I'll try to briefly answer your other queries.\n\n1) ALL this Pink Floyd discs you'll find, post 1992/1994, use the same masters, the 1992 round of which were prepared in anticipation of the Shine On boxed set, and the 1994 round of which finished out the remaining titles. They've not been remastered since, save for the new SACD version of Dark Side of the Moon.\n\n2) Dark Side of the Moon was mastered for Shine On in 1992, and that pressing is dated as such. Earlier CD versions had artwork with the prism outlined in white (example A) while the remastered version shaded the prism (example B).\n\nA B\n\n3) All of their proper albums through 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason were reissued as part of the 1992/1994 campaign. 1988's Delicate Sound of Thunder was not reissued in this campaign, nor were A Great Collection of Dance Songs or Works (both of which had been previously available on earlier CD pressings), since they were compilation albums.\n\n4) The Shine On box set contains the following albums:\n\nA Saucerful of Secrets\n\nMeddle\n\nDark Side of the Moon\n\nWish You Were Here\n\nAnimals\n\nThe Wall\n\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason\n\nIn addition, Shine On included a bonus disc entitled The Early Singles, which contained the following songs: Arnold Layne, Candy and a Currant Bun, See Emily Play, The Scarecrow, Apples and Oranges, Paintbox, It Would Be So Nice, Julia Dream, Point Me at the Sky, and Careful With That Axe, Eugene\n\nHope this helps.\n\n- M.\n\nEdit: Forgot to turn off emoticons, so they turned \"(example B)\" into a sunglasses smilie. Fixed.\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #6 – 2003-07-03 07:07:37\n\nQuote\n\nIf we all had such connections like Roberto's ...\n\nI have no connections! I was just extremely lucky to find it on sale at a CD shop in the duty free zone of Johannesburgh's airport, when I was on my way to China. (to visit my brother)\n\nAnd I got it at the \"deal\" price of 197 dollars.\n\nQuote\n\nWasn't your brother a member of the parliament?

The date: january of 1991, and week later I buyed my second cd, The Delicate Sound Of Thunder (Live) (Double CD) (48 US$)\n\nThe dates are stored in a database for my cd and minidiscs with the prices and other data.\n\nMPC: --quality 10 --xlevel (v. 1.15s) (archive/transcoding)\n\nMP3: LAME 3.96.1 --preset standard (daily listening/portable)\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #8 – 2003-07-03 08:42:00\n\nThanks for the info...\n\nLooks like Dark Side and all the others in that box are indeed available on their own, which is nice (since i have half of them already).\n\nIt is also nice to know that the EMI release of Dark Side has the opaque prism on the front instead of the clear one. I wonder why here in Canada all I can ever find is the old crappy Capitol release? Worst case I'll just grab one off ebay for $15 (there are lots).\n\nAs far as the 1997 vs the 1992 versions go, they are a bit different from my own experience. \"Welcome to the Machine\" on the 1992 release has a bunch of sound effects and talking at the end which are abreviated on the 1997 version. They might be from the same masters, but they were edited differently at the very least.\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #9 – 2003-07-03 08:56:47\n\nQuote\n\nAs far as the 1997 vs the 1992 versions go, they are a bit different from my own experience. \"Welcome to the Machine\" on the 1992 release has a bunch of sound effects and talking at the end which are abreviated on the 1997 version.

Good to know... the Floyd have a long history of re-editing their work for various formats (the linked version of \"Pigs on the Wing, parts 1 & 2\" from the 8-track release springs to mind), but I was unaware of any major variations in \"Welcome to the Machine.\"\n\n- M.\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #10 – 2003-07-03 17:51:40\n\nQuote\n\nJebus wrote:\n\n3) Any of them besides DSoM (and of course Division Bell, it is too new) NOT come out on a 1992/1994 EMI release?\n\nQuote\n\nM wrote:\n\nAll of their proper albums through 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason were reissued as part of the 1992/1994 campaign.\n\nOh. Hrmm. I was going to tell Jebus that as well as the two he mentioned already (DSoT/TDB), \"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\" isn't available separately as a 1992/94 remaster either - at least I've never seen it (I know it's included in the Shine On set though). In numerous stores I've checked out in Germany and the UK (I even looked in Italy when I was on a short visit ), I have only ever seen the original 1987 release.\n\nLooking at the page you linked, it seems I'm right actually - the only two CD releases of the album listed there are the original release and a 1997 anniversary release.

Yes, the 1997 anniversary releases on Columbia were all based on the Shine On masters (1992), and subsequent mixes to fill in the gaps. All were prepared by EMI, and the early albums (Piper at the Gates of Dawn through Dark Side of the Moon) were licensed to Capitol in the US, while the later albums (Wish You Were Here through A Momentary Lapse of Reason) were licensed to Columbia. However, I did miss one yesterday: Relics was remastered in 1995, and licensed to Capitol in the US... and until the 2-CD release of Echoes a year or two ago it was the only Pink Floyd compilation to have received such treatment.\n\n- M.\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #12 – 2003-07-03 19:14:03\n\nHere's a quick guide, if you want to know which pressings to seek out. These catalog numbers refer to the U.S. pressings, so in order to obtain a complete set of the Shine On/EMI 1992/1994 (and 1995) remasters you will need the following:\n\nRelics - Capitol CDP 7243 8 35603 2 5 (small album cover on spine)\n\nPiper at the Gates of Dawn - Capitol CDP 0777 7 46384 2 5 (small album cover on spine)\n\nA Saucerful of Secrets - Capitol CDP 0777 7 46383 2 6 (spine text all lowercase; no mini-cover)\n\nMusic from the Film More - Capitol CDP 0777 7 46386 2 3 (small album cover on spine)\n\nUmmagumma (live album) - Capitol CDP 0777 7 31213 2 8 (small album cover on spine)\n\nUmmagumma (studio album) - Capitol CDP 0777 7 31214 2 8 (small album cover on spine)\n\nAtom Heart Mother - Capitol CDP 0777 7 46381 2 8 (small album cover on spine)\n\nMeddle - Capitol CDP 0777 7 46034 2 3 (spine is plain green with white text; no mini-cover)\n\nObscured by Clouds - Capitol CDP 0777 7 46385 2 4 (small album cover on spine)\n\nDark Side of the Moon - Capitol CDP 0777 7 46001 2 5 (prism bands wrap spine; no mini-cover)\n\nWish You Were Here - Columbia CK 68522 (small album cover on spine)\n\nAnimals - Columbia CK 68521 (spine text similar to cover text; no mini-cover)\n\nThe Wall - Columbia CK 68519 (spine text similar to cover text; no mini-cover)\n\nThe Final Cut - Columbia CK 68517 (spine text similar to cover text; no mini-cover)\n\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason - Columbia CK 68518 (spine text similar to cover text; no mini-cover)\n\nEarly Singles - Columbia CK 53181; from the Shine On box set (digipack)\n\nHope this helps clear up any confusion.\n\n- M.\n\nEdit: Fixed a mis-spelling (\"remsters\" instead of \"remasters\"). Oops.\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #13 – 2003-07-03 19:25:44\n\nI have two versions of The Dark Side Of The Moon: EMI 20 Years remaster and Capitol 30 Years SACD, plus some of the tracks on Echos.\n\nI do not like quality of SACD version since there are some audible distortions here and there (I don't have SACD player so can play Audio CD part only), EMI remasters sounds fantastic, however remasters on Echos sound even better. So in terms of Pink Floyd sound quality stuff, Echos wins - the best PF quality I've heard.\n\nIf I were to re-release & remaster disks I would go DVD-Audio/DTS 24/96 (or 24/192) way, as Queen did, the only downside is that I can't rip these disks and play in car.\n\nI don't know where the guys from Japan get their remasters, but for me they sound better then original EMI disks... though difference is minute.\n\nMy endian is bigger than yours.\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #14 – 2003-07-03 23:29:35\n\nVery interesting information M.\n\nI happen to be one of the people who owns the Mobile Fidelity Ultradisk II (\"Original Master Recording\") version, and I've been quite happy with it, though I'm no Floyd Fanatic. To my ear, this version sounds somewhat more LP-ish than does the Capitol remaster.\n\nWhether this is because of Mobile Fidelity's transfer or equalization procedures, I am unsure.\n\nAll I know for sure is that Sinatra comes in just a little clearer at the very very end\n\nEDIT: I believe I have found a flaw in your catalog, however\n\nMy general-release version of DSoM has both the (original) Transparent Prism cover AND is remastered (CD has a topographic-style map with an overlayed prism printed on it in grey outline).\n\nThe CD states: \"Manufactured by Capitiol Records, Inc. ...

Here's the story: Hipgnosis was in the process of tweaking all the Floyd art for the reissue campaign (which is why several covers across the series have subtle differences in color, configuration, and design from the original sleeves) and decided the Dark Side plain transparent prism needed an overhaul. So barely a year and a half after the album was remastered, the same digital remaster was re-released with a new copyright date, allowable since the artwork (and therefore the configuration) had changed. That is the \"new artwork\" version, which - if one is currently seeking a copy of the album - would be the simplest to locate. Don't know whether yours would be any more valuable to a collector since it has artwork closer to the original album, but the disc itself contains the same digital master as the 1994 version.\n\n- M.\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #16 – 2003-07-04 03:33:20\n\nWoohoo!!!

Sound is terrible but \"Made In Canada\" proudly shines on the back of CDs.\n\nIf you have any HMV store in town, then you can go there and order editions you like, however they couldn't order any PF discs from Europe Otherwise you can always grab Japanese editions which are in paper cases but cost like 40$...\n\nMy endian is bigger than yours.\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #22 – 2003-07-05 19:35:06\n\nGday...\n\nall music.. til 86. shall be on vinyl..!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nand... floyd must be on vinyl.\n\n(in general: creative and quality rock..\n\ndied with the CD..)\n\nPink Floyd remasters\n\nReply #23 – 2003-07-05 19:44:53\n\nNow that was a helpful and informed post. :B\n\nGet up-to-date binaries of Lame, AAC, Vorbis and much more at RareWares:\n\nhttp://www.rarewares.org"
