        "text": "A favorite memory of mine from Junior High / early High School days (around 1973-74) is an art teacher who liked to put on music while the class was working on their projects. That same teacher was still doing it in the late 1990s when my own kids were that same age. He brought in his music on homemade cassette tapes, dubbed from his record player at home. The sound quality was not that great, but he made it work, and the music really did enhance our various painting and graphic arts creations. Alice Cooper. Led Zeppelin. The Rolling Stones. Chicago. But most of all, and most popular with us students, was this psychedelic-sounding collection called The Dark Side of the Moon by a band called Pink Floyd.\n\nWhen I started college in 1977, I would frequently visit a place called the “listening lounge” in the student union building. There, they had a number of comfortable lounge chairs set up with record players behind a barrier behind them. One of the staff would actually do the placing of the albums on the turntables for you, and you could listen to any album in the collection on headphones in the lounge. I decided one day to check out what The Dark Side of the Moon sounded like on headphones, and to satisfy my curiosity about why the album continued to be hyped so much, 4-5 years after its release. It was a life-changing experience! The far-better sound quality of the vinyl with headphones made Pink Floyd’s masterpiece really come alive.\n\nIn March of 1983, I was the owner of a music store in a small town. That store only lasted about one more year beyond that, for a whole host of reasons, but during that time I repaired and sold musical instruments, sold records and tapes, taught piano lessons, and tuned pianos. I also subscribed to Billboard magazine – the real, official one that was printed on newspaper stock and was actually almost as big as a daily paper. Issues were published weekly, and I clearly remember the one that arrived the week of March 1 of 1983: a full-page ad was taken out by Capitol (EMI) Records, consisting almost entirely of just the prism being struck by a laser against a black background, just as was the album cover for the then-10 year old release. The ad’s only text, in small white print near the bottom, said something like this:\n\nOn March 1, 1973, Pink Floyd released The Dark Side of the Moon, which entered the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart the following week.\n\nIt never left.\n\nThe main gist of the ad was in pointing out what was, then, already a world record: Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon had been on the charts continuously for 10 years. That uninterrupted streak would continue for another 5 years. But even with the occasional drop-off, Dark Side would reappear frequently on the Top 200, and would eventually become one of the best-selling albums of all time. It has, overall, outsold one of Pink Floyd’s later masterpieces, The Wall, in spite of the fact that The Wall was the number one album of 1980, briefly (1980-1983) the number one album of all time (to that point), and the simple fact that Dark Side was never the number one album of any year (it was #11 for both 1973 and 1974).\n\nToday is the 50th Anniversary of the release of Pink Floyd’s magnum opus. Debate all you want about what Pink Floyd album is next best, or what album is your personal favorite (my personal favorite is actually The Wall): not only is Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon one of the best-selling albums of all time, but it is clearly one of the best albums ever recorded, period. It was a real career-launcher for the members of the band, even though 5 of the 7 previous albums have since gone either gold (More, Atom Heart Mother, Obscured By Clouds) or platinum (Ummagumma, Meddle). None of those achievements occurred until after Dark Side had gone platinum itself.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is a concept album featuring several “big life concepts”, which is arguably part of its appeal and staying power. Songs about birth, death, relationships, Money, Time, and mental health issues make up most of its 43 minute running time. Two of those concepts are capitalized as the actual names of songs found inside. Though only 2 songs were released as singles (“Money,” “Us And Them”), every song on the album has enjoyed a great deal of airplay on classic rock radio. There are likely more t-shirts emblazoned with the album’s artwork than any other album cover from any band.\n\nNot only the band, but also the album’s engineer/producer enjoyed a huge career boost with this album. Four years earlier, Alan Parsons was a part of the production team at Apple Records, putting together The Beatles’ Abbey Road album. In 1972-73, he engineered the recording of Dark Side and even suggested singer Claire Torry to do the wordless vocals in “The Great Gig In The Sky”. Torry later appeared on a couple of albums by The Alan Parsons Project, as Parsons then launched his own musical career off of the success of The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nAs a band, Pink Floyd had already seen its share of ups and downs before this album, and would continue its roller coaster afterwards. A song on Dark Side (“Brain Damage”) is an homage to founding member Syd Barrett, who left the band 5 years earlier due to a mental breakdown. Pink Floyd would later devote an entire album to that same subject (Wish You Were Here, 1975). Roger Waters, bassist and chief lyricist of the band, would use an altercation with a fan during their tour in support of Animals (1977) as inspiration for The Wall (1979), but then leave the band just 4 years later. Pink Floyd carried on with guitarist David Gilmour, but the 2008 death of keyboardist Richard Wright put the final nail in the coffin for the band.\n\nBut along the way, Pink Floyd’s lasting legacy is this now-50 year old album. It is estimated that 1 in 14 people has or has had a copy of this album in some format or another. If you’re one of them, give it a spin tonight. If you don’t already have a copy, it’s available on various streaming services. It’s also still “in print” – you can buy a copy nearly anywhere, any format (except 8-track) including on vinyl. It’s an experience as much as it is a great album. Happy Birthday, Dark Side!"
