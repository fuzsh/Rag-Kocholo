        "text": "1st off I have a question:\n\nWhy did Capitol acquire the US rights to only part of their Columbia catalog (WYWH, Animals, Wall, & Collection Of Dance Songs). Why did they get it in the first place and why did they only get these albums? I know EMI has the UK rights but this doesn't make sense to me.\n\nAlso, what CD issues (non-gold) do you like of the Floyd catalog: Wish You Were Here-Final Cut. I like the 1997 Columbia anniversay editions a lot. I've heard the Capitol 1994/2000 remasters but I like these better and I'm glad I have them since they are out of print. The original issues of these CD's did nothing for me. I was wondering what everyone else thought?\n\nI know a lot of you are into 1st pressings of CD's and I came across this website which gives a lot of info on Floyd releases.\n\nourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/PFArchives/discTOC.htm\n\nThis is an issue that has always confused me, too. In fact, I was going to post pretty much the exact same question last night after looking at the pinkfloydcd.com site, but I was too tired.\n\nSo help us both out on this Capitol/Columbia issue. Which albums are owned by Capitol? Which albums are owned by Columbia? Which albums are owned by Pink Floyd themselves? And what label did each album debut on?\n\nYes, Columbia their US label from 1975-2000(?). I remember the Live Wall album coming out in 2000 right around the time Capitol reissued the CD's in question using the 1994 UK remasters so I always wondered what the hell was going on. WYWH, Animals, Wall, and Dance Songs all originally came out on the Columbia label but are now reissued by Capitol- but Final Cut, Momentary, the live albums, and Division Bell all remain on Columbia. I don't get it.\n\nNope, this CD actually got reissued in the US by Capitol in 2000 using the 1994 UK remaster (unless you have a UK pressing). I guess they used the 1994 copyright date because that's when it was remastered. Columbia remastered this CD in 1997 as part of the band's 30th Anniversary campaign and then Captiol took over the rights in 2000 issuing their own different remaster from 1994 (25 Anniversary masters?). The UK Floyd catalog was remastered in 1993-1995. Confusing isn't it?\n\nI think that Columbia (US and Canada) had a 25 year distribution agreement for Floyd albums starting with \"Wish You Were Here\" in 1975. EMI retained the rights for the UK and the rest of the world. This agreement is in place for all Floyd albums up to 1983's \"The Final Cut.\" I don't know if the same thing happens with the \"Gilmour Floyd\" albums that began with \"A Momentary Lapse...\" in 1987.\n\nSo I think that as each Columbia album passes outside of the 25 year period, the rights revert back to EMI. The process of changing over the distribution of each particular album (and whether the same mastering is used) can be pretty confusing. I can't remember where I read this, but I'm pretty sure this is how it goes. Any corrections welcome.\n\nI would like to know if Pink Floyd actually own the master tapes starting with the 1974-75 record deal they signed with Columbia and EMI. They were coming off of the biggest album in the world at that time (Dark Side) and they must have had a lot of negotiating power. Does anybody know the answer to that?\n\nJohn\n\nVancouver BC\n\nI think you are close but these Capitol reissues came out all at once around 2000. It might have just been a 25 year deal 1975-2000 or some kind of copyright thing where it expired in 2000 and reverted the rights back to Capitol/EMI.\n\nThen perhaps Brad and bartels it more comes down to the fact that we are all running different equipment.\n\nWill you guys do a test with me? If so, turn up the volume on your systems, as loud as you would enjoy your system for comfort, but still reasonably loud. Then take your two pressings and play them and let us know what you observe. Just compare say Comfortably Numb or another rocking tune."
