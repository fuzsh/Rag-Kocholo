discs weren't commercially issued until the mid-1980s, the order in which Pink Floyd albums were released on CDs varied considerably from their original release order. The very first Pink Floyd compact discs to be released in the United States were Wish You Were Here in June 1983, The Final Cut in August 1983, Dark Side of the Moon in August 1984, and The Wall in late 1984. These early CD issues were all made in Japan for export to the U.S. market.Bar Codes: Bar codes are a group of vertical lines found on the back cover of some CDs that are used for scanning purposes. By passing a CD with a bar code over a scanner, the scanner can read information about the CD instantly. The information in bar codes begins with the vendor code (first 4 digits), the catalog number, a format code (\"1\" for LPs, \"2\" for CDs, \"4\" for cassette tapes), and sometimes there is a final digit that is the barcode checksum. In recent years, there has been a trend towards using the entire bar code number as the catalog number of the CD. DIDP & DIDX Identification Codes: DIDP, which stands for Digital IDentification Project, is an identification code created by by Sony Records to track thier compact disc manufacturing. Each album manufactured by Sony will have a DIDP number on the disc. DIDX, which stands for Digital IDentification eXternal, is a Sony Records identification code that was used to track the manufacturing of compact discs by Sony for other companies. Each album manufactured by Sony for another company, such as the early Dark Side of the Moon compact discs that were manufactured at Sony's DADC plant for EMI Records, will have a DIDX number on the disc. Label Codes: Label codes are the 4 digit numbers that are found on the labels of some CDs. These label codes are designated by the IFPI to indicate the company that owns the rights to the property on the CD.\n\nSome of the registered labels codes are:\n\nLC 0148 - Capitol Records\n\nLC 0149 - CBS Records\n\nLC 0162 - Columbia Records\n\nLC 0542 - EMI Records\n\nLC 1305 - Harvest Records\n\nLC 1331 - EMIDisc Records\n\nLongbox Packaging: In the late 1980s and early 1990s, CDs were often released in a longbox to help record shops display CDs in deep bins made for vinyl record albums. These longboxes were a 12 inch long by 6 inch wide cardboard box inside which was the CD in a jewel case. The jewel cased CDs inside the longboxes were either 1) not sealed, 2) were sealed only with a dogbone sticker across the top of the case, or 3) were sealed in shrink wrap. In the early 1990s, a yellow/red diamond sticker was placed on the outside of the longbox to indicate to vendors that the CD inside was sealed in shrink wrap. The longbox was discontinued in April 1993, although the special led edition of PULSE was issued in a longbox in June 1995. Manufacturing Dates (EMI / Capitol Records):\n\n1984 - The first EMI / Capitol Records Pink Floyd compact disc that was released in the U.S. was Dark Side of the Moon. It was manufactured for the U.S. market in Japan. This CD has black labels and \"Made in Japan\" is designated on the label and cover.\n\n1984-1985 - In September 1984, Capitol Records began using the Sony DADC plant in Terre Haute, Indiana to manufacture CDs (prior to starting up their own manufacturing facilities in Jacksonville, Illinois). Two of the first CDs that were produced at this plant were the first U.S. manufactured issues of Dark Side of the Moon, and Meddle.\n\n1985-1987 - Since CD manufacturing plants in the U.S. were still limited, many CDs sold in the U.S. at this time were imported from foreign pressing plants. Some original releases of Pink Floyd compact discs by EMI in the U.S. were manufactured / mastered for the U.S. market by the following plants:\n\nNimbus, Monmouth, U.K. (Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets)\n\nPhilips Dupont Optical (PDO), Hanover, West Germany (Ummagumma)\n\nVictor Company of Japan (JVC) (More, Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, Obscured by Clouds)\n\nBMG Sonopress, West Germany (Obscured by Clouds)\n\n1986 - In late 1986, Philips DuPont Optical or \"PDO\" of West Germany opened a CD pressing plant in Kings Mt., North Carolina. PDO pressed copies of Dark Side of the Moon were made at this plant in late 1986 / early 1987. Also used to press Pink Floyd CDs (Works) at this time was Shape Optimedia, Inc. in Biddeford, Maine.\n\n1987 - EMI began producing CDs for the U.S. market at its plant in Jacksonville, Illinois [Capitol Jax IL], which had been a vinyl pressing plant since 1964. CDs were made at the JAX plant from \"production molds\" that were originally sent to JAX from Hollywood, California until 1988 when they moved the process of creating the production molds to JAX. The CDs were created by using the production molds in Toshiba injection molding machines. Most of the Capitol /EMI compact discs released in the U.S. during the late 1980s and 1990s were pressed at this plant.\n\n1987 - 1988 - During this period, the mastering of some CDs (Ummagumma) was done by Discovery Systems, Inc., a company that had been founded by Jeffrey M. Wilkins in 1985 in Dublin, Ohio. Discovery Systems, Inc. used a manufacturing process that had been developed by U.S. Philips Corp. and DiscoVision Associates. By 1989, the Discovery Systems, Inc. ceased to exist and became Metatec, Inc.\n\n2004 - In March, 2004, EMI announced that it was going to cease producing its own CDs and DVDs. Cinram International, a Canadian company, would take over the production of CDs and DVDs for all EMI companies previously supplied by the Jacksonville, Illinois, plant, which would be closed. Cinram produces CDs and DVDs for EMI out of its plant in Richmond, Indiana.\n\n2007 - EMI was purchased by Terra Firma in August 2007.\n\n2009 - Cinram International began closing its Richmond, Indiana CD pressing plant in April 2009, with the final shutdown happening in August 2009. Cinram filed for bankruptcy in the United States in July 2012.\n\n2010 - EMI began having its U.S. Pink Floyd CDs pressed at the Sony Records pressing plant in Pitman, New Jersey. The Pitman plant was later shut down in March 2011.\n\n2011 - In January 2011, Pink Floyd signed a five year exclusive global agreement with EMI to market and distribute its catalog. In February 2011, Citigroup aquired EMI's recorded music division when EMI defaulted on its loans. Citigropup then sold the division to Universal Music Group (parent company is Vivendi) in November 2011.\n\n2011-2012 - EMI has its U.S. Pink Floyd CDs pressed by either Sony DADC in Mexico, or by Sony DADC in Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\nManufacturing Dates (CBS / Sony Records):\n\n1983 - The first Pink Floyd Columbia CDs released in the U.S. were made in Japan by CBS / Sony Corporation. These included the original issues of Wish You Were Here, The Final Cut, and The Wall.\n\n1984-1985 - The very first compact disc manufacturing plant built in the U.S. was the Digital Audio Disc Corporation [Sony DADC IN] plant in Terre Haute, Indiana, which broke ground on May 2, 1983. However, CD production at the plant did not officially begin until September 21, 1984. (In September and October 1984, production capacity at DADC Terre Haute was approximately 300,000 discs a month, although this figure includes all CDs produced, not just Pink Floyd albums.) The earliest U.S. pressings of Meddle, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, The Final Cut, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason were done by Digital Audio Disc Corp. Sony Corporation of America purchased the Digital Audio Disc Corporation from its affiliate CBS/Sony on November 29, 1985. According to Brad Zuercher, who worked at the plant from May 1986 through 1988, DADC had 26 moulding machines (each machine would use one stamper at a time), and each stamper could last up to 7 days and could make up to 50,000 CDs before replacement. In 1988, the DADC plant in Terre Haute, Indiana began using twin-cavity molds to increase production by producing two CDs at the same time using different stampers. DADC is now part of Sony Disc Manufacturing (SDM).\n\n1985-1987 - In addition to manufacturing CDs at the Terre Haute, Indiana plant during this period, Columbia Records also used Nippon Columbia (Denon) and the Victor Company of Japan (JVC) to manufacture discs for the U.S. market.\n\n1988 - Columbia Records began producing CDs at its Pitman, New Jersey plant, which was an old CBS Records plant (it had been producing LPs since 1960) retrofitted to make CDs.\n\n1988 - In 1988, the CBS Records Group, including Columbia Records, was acquired by Sony.\n\n1995 - In spring 1995, Nimbus opened a CD manufacturing plant in Sunnyvale, California. Nimbus / CA pressed some Pink Floyd CDs beginning in 1997, including P-U-L-S-E (1997 edition), The Division Bell, Animals (1997 edition), The Final Cut (1997 edition), and Is There Anybody Out There? - The Wall Live 1980-81 (2000).\n\n1998 - In June 1998, Nimbus CD International Inc. merged with Technicolor, when it was bought by Carlton Communications plc, the parent company of Technicolor.\n\n2011 - Sony Records closed its pressing plant in Pitman, New Jersey on March 31, 2011. The majority of Sony's U.S. CD manufacturing was moved to its plant in Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\nMatrix Information: Matrix information is the letters and numbers printed on a compact disc in the mirror band close to the center hole of the CD. Matrix information may be printed to be read from the top side (label side) of the CD, while other matrix information may be printed to be read from the bottom side of the CD. In some instances, matrix information is printed on both the top and bottom sides of the disc, with the bottom side matrix information being the mastering information, and the top side matrix information being the pressing information. In other instances, both the mastering and pressing information is printed on the same side of the disc.\n\nThe following matrix band information can be found on many compact discs:\n\nCatalog number - The identifying number given to the release by the record company. Manufacturer - On some CDs, on the plastic hub around the center hole (not on the shiny part of the disc), there is imprinted information about the disc manufacturer. (In this discography, this information is indicated in brackets.)\n\nExamples of manufaturing information stamped on the plastic hubs:\n\n[MANUFACTURED BY CBS / SONY] - CBS / Sony Records, Tokyo, Japan (hub first used in 1983)\n\n[Made in USA - Digital Audio Disc Corp.] - Sony's Digital Audio Disc Corp., Terre Haute, Indiana (hub first used in 1984)\n\n[CSR COMPACT DISC] - CBS / Sony Records, Tokyo, Japan (hub first used in apx. 1985/1986)\n\n[CMU P] - Columbia Records, Pitman, New Jersey (hub first used in 1988)\n\n[IFPI xxxx] - SID codes - the numbers following IFPI indicate different manufacturing plants (first put on CDs in 1994)\n\n[NIMBUS/CA] - Nimbus U.S.A., Sunnyvale, California (hub first used in 1997)\n\n[TECHNICOLOR/CA] - Technicolor, Camarillo, California (hub first used in 1998)\n\nManufacturer's Work Order Number - This often is in the form of the scan code that can only be read by a special scanner. Mastering Information - On some CDs there are three numbers separated by dashes, such as 2-2-1. These numbers refer to the father, the mother, and the stamper. In the example given, 2-2-1, the first 2 indicates that the CD was made from the second father, the second 2 indicates that the CD was made from the second mother made from the second father, and the third number, 1, means that the CD was made using the first stamper made from the second mother (The stamper is what is installed in the mold machine). Pressing Plant - Pressing plant information is often found in the matrix, either as a part of the SID Code or as an abbreviation. For example, the letters \"JAX\" found in the matrix indicate that the CD was made at the EMI pressing plant located in Jacksonville, Illinois. Selection Source Master - On some CDs, the selection source master is designated by information such as \"RE2.\" In the example given, \"RE2\" indicates that the selection source master is at revision level 2. SID Codes - On many CDs, there are two Source Identification Codes (SID Code) in the matrix band. The SID Code, which was introduced in April 1994, consists of the letters IFPI (which stands for the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry), followed by 4 or 5 additional characters. There are two different SID Codes found on CDs:\n\nMastering Code - The first SID Code in the matrix band is the \"Mastering Code.\" The Mastering Code begins with \"IFPI\" followed by a sequence of digits beginning with the letter L, followed by two numbers that indicate the pressing plant, and then 1 or 2 additional digits that indicate the Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) that cut the glass master. The Mastering Code is put on the CD at the time the glass master of the CD is cut by the LBR, and it appears on all subsequent pressings of the CD sourced from that specific glass master. Mould Code - The second SID Code on a CD is the \"Mould Code.\" The Mould Code begins with \"ifpi\" followed by two digits that indicate the specific pressing plant that pressed the disc, and two additional digits that indicate the unique mould or stamper that pressed the CD.\n\nSID Mould Codes, which indicate where a CD was stamped or pressed, include:\n\n14 - EMI Compact Disc pressing plant, Greenbridge, Swindon, England\n\n15 - EMI Compact Disc BV pressing plant, Uden, Netherlands\n\n16 - EMI Compact Disc pressing plant, Jacksonville, Illinois\n\n38 - Zomax Optical pressing plant, Plymouth, Minnesota\n\n45 - Sony Records pressing plant, Japan\n\n50 - Sony Records DADC pressing plant, Terre Haute, Indiana\n\n51 - Sony Records DADC pressing plant, Terre Haute, Indiana\n\n61 - Cinram International, Richmond, Indiana\n\n72 - Sony Records pressing plant, Pitman, New Jersey\n\n80 - Cinram International, Canada\n\n94 - Sony DADC Austria AG\n\n1T - Technicolor Records pressing plant, California\n\n2T - Nimbus Records pressing plant, Sunnyvale, California\n\nAAH - MediaMotion Manufacturing BV, Uden, Netherlands\n\nAKN - Sony DADC, Mexico\n\nNote: The matrix information listed in this discography is not intended to be complete listings. This is known matrix information only. Matrix information from multiple copies is listed if known.\n\nTotal Time: The total time for each CD is provided in minutes and seconds. Total time readings can vary by a second or two depending on the CD player or software program used to do the readings.Track Peak Levels: The peak volume levels for every song on a CD have been noted in this discography. These peak volume levels were read using EAC software, and are measured as percentages, with the maximum possible peak level being 100%. It is useful to use peak level readings to compare CDs, because CDs that have different peak levels reveal that the CDs were made from different masterings (and, therefore, sound different).TTR: At the very end of the album Dark Side of the Moon, a very, very short and quiet snippet of a portion of the Beatles song, Ticket to Ride, can be heard. It is believed that this is on the master tape. When the first compact discs were made, this snippet was cut off. In this discography, this is indicated by \"No TTR\" in the mastering section of the entry. U.S. Compact Discs Made for Export: In the mid-1980s, some U.S. pressing plants were contracted to produce CDs for the Canadian market. Instances of early U.S. pressings that were made for export to Canada say \"Made in the U.S.A.\" on the label, but have Canadian information on the booklet or cover. U.S. pressed CDs made for the Canadian market include Wish You Were Here (\"Imported and Distributed by CBS Records Canada Ltd\" on insert - pressed by DADC), The Final Cut (\"Printed in/Imprime au Canada\" on back cover - pressed by DADC), and A Momentary Lapse of Reason (\"Imported and Distributed by CBS Records Canada Ltd.\" on back cover - pressed by DADC).\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn CD & longbox\n\nEMI Records 1st issue\n\nTitle: The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (EMI Records 1st issue)\n\nRecord Company: EMI Records\n\nCatalog Number: CDP 7 46384 2\n\nBar Codes:\n\nCD Cover: 0 77774 63842 5\n\nLongbox: 0 7777-46384-2\n\nMatrix Information:\n\n1) Top: CDP 7 46384 2 : MASTERED BY NIMBUS\n\nPressing Plant: Nimbus Records, Monmouth, U.K.\n\nProduction Mastering / Revision Level: EMI / Nimbus mastering - EMI revision level 0\n\nRelease Date: January 23, 1987\n\nRelease Information: Original U.S. release.
