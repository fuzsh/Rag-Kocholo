Tower Records was a subsidiary of Capitol Records in the United States that released Pink Floyd records between the years 1967 and 1969. There were a total of twenty seven different Pink Floyd records released on Tower Records (this figure is based on alternate label variations. If you count cover variations, there are more).

The following is a discography of all the Tower Records releases. Any comments, corrections or additions to this discography are appreciated.

Release and Dating Information

Album Label Variations: There are a number of distinct Tower Records album labels.

In 1967 and 1968, Tower albums were issued on a brown Tower Records label.

Sometime in 1969, prior to the release of the album, More, album labels were changed to a striped Tower label, with with alternate strips of blue, green, purple and orange.

There are numerous variations of both the brown Tower labels and the striped Tower labels, with the song titles, composer and ASCAP credits differing between the issues (see the label descriptions in the discography for the differences). Counterfeit Tower Singles: The use of basic black print for the Tower picture sleeves and labels have made the Tower singles very susceptible to counterfeiting. This is particularily true for the singles with white Tower promotional labels. It is known that the Arnold Layne and See Emily Play white promotional label singles and sleeves have been counterfeited. However, it can be very difficult to spot a counterfeit. Specific information about known counterfeit pressings has been added to this discography where appropriate. Cover Slick Numbers: On most of the first three Pink Floyd albums, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, and More, a very small number can be found at the bottom of the back cover in the lower right corner. These numbers are the "designated numbers" for the particular album slick, and indicate which printer was used by the record company to print that specific album cover slick.

A cover with no number on it can be assumed to indicate the original printer used by Capitol Records, as there are no issues with a number 1 on them. Known numbers 2 through 21 indicate that different printing factories were used. It is unknown which printers belong to each number. However, of the three Capitol Records pressing plants operating in the United States at the time, cover numbers 2 and 3 are usually found with pressings from the Scranton, Pennsylvania record plant, number 4 is usually found on pressings from the Jacksonville, Illinois record plant, and numbers 5 and 6 are usually found with pressings from the Los Angeles, California record plant.

Keep in mind that these "designation numbers" do not indicate order of release. Many cover slick printing factories were used simultaneously, and it is possible that any pressing could be put with any record cover number depending on the record company's inventory at the time.

The covers numbers indicated in this discography are only numbers that have been verified for a particular pressing. It is more than likely that other cover numbers will be found for those same pressings. Label text:

In 1967 and early 1968, the text at the bottom edge of Tower Record labels read:

"Mfd. in U.S.A."

In August 1968, the text on Tower labels was changed to read:

"Manufactured in the U.S.A. by Capitol Records, Inc."

In approximately mid-1969, the text on Tower labels was changed to read:

"Mfd. by Capitol Records, Inc, a subsidiary of Capitol Industries, Inc. U.S.A."Matrix Information: Matrix information is the letters and numbers etched into the vinyl near the label in the runoff groove at the end of each side of a record.

Matrix information may show:

Catalog number.

Lacquer number.

Record pressing plant.

The engineer who cut the lacquer.

The matrix information listed in this discography are not intended to be complete listings. They are known matrix numbers only. Record Pressing Plants: When the first Pink Floyd records were issued in the United States in 1967, Capitol Records were pressing records in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in Los Angeles, California, and in Jacksonville, Illinois.

The particular plant that was used to press a certain album is indicated by the following symbols in the matrix of the record:

A machine stamped triangle with the initials IAM indicates that the record was pressed at the Scranton, Pennsylvania plant.

A star (*) indicates that the record was pressed at the Los Angeles, California plant.

An 0, either stamped or hand written, indicates that the record was pressed at the Jacksonville, Illinois plant.
