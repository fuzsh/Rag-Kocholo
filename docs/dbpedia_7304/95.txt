Capitol Records is celebrating its 75th anniversary this month, and in honor of the milestone, the company is launching a series of music, book and film projects saluting the various artists who have recorded for the label. One highlight of the initiative is a year-long vinyl reissue campaign called The Capitol Records 75th Anniversary Collection, which will begin this month and will feature the re-release of vinyl versions of 75 selected albums.

Among the Capitol albums that will be reissued are The Beatles‘ Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Revolver and Meet The Beatles; Pink Floyd‘s The Dark Side of the Moon; John Lennon‘s Imagine; George Harrison‘s All Things Must Pass; Wings‘ Band on the Run; Ringo Starr‘s Ringo; Steve Miller Band‘s Fly Like an Eagle; Grand Funk Railroad‘s We’re an American Band; Bob Seger‘s Night Moves; Heart‘s 1985 self-titled effort; and The Band‘s eponymous and Music from Big Pink albums.

The list of vinyl reissues was chosen by an advisory board featuring noted music journalists, authors and artists and includes popular and influential albums, as well as noteworthy lesser-known releases. The 75th Anniversary Collection LPs will be sold at various music retailers throughout 2017.

Other releases planned for the celebration include a deluxe book of photos and essays titled 75 Years of Capitol Records that will be published on December 15, and a documentary series premiering in fall 2017 that will feature episodes offering in-depth profiles of specific Capitol artists.

The 75th anniversary celebration will official launch on November 15, a Capitol Records star will be unveiled on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of the famous Capitol Tower. That same day will be officially declared Capitol Records Day in Los Angeles.
