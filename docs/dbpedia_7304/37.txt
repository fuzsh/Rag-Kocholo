According to legend the design of this building is meant to represent a stack of records. Inside the lobby is an astounding array of gold records, spanning the entire history of rock and roll and the amazing roster of recording artists that have been represented on the Capitol label.

Capitol Records was the first record company based on the West Coast, and has promoted such acts as The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, Frank Sinatra, Bob Seger, Duran Duran, Bonnie Raitt, Robbie Robertson, Steve Miller, Linda Ronstadt and Tina Turner.

The mural facing the parking lot is a beautiful photo op. Capitol has promotional events for their artists at this location regularly.

The former president of Capitol Records, Alan Livingston had the idea of having the light on top of the building send out a signal in Morse code. The word chosen for this secret message was “Hollywood.” When the building opened in 1956, Samuel Morse’s granddaughter Leila Morse had the honor of turning the light on.

In 1992 it was changed to read “Capitol 50” in honor of the label’s fiftieth anniversary. Prior to an album release by Katy Perry, it was changed to “Katy Perry. Prism. October 22, 2013.” It’s unlikely anyone noticed the change. It has since returned to spelling “Hollywood.”
