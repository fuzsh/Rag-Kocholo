        "text": "The contrast of two recent events has drawn me to significant reflection over the past few weeks.\n\nIn August, I went to the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., my alma mater, for the dedication of a new barracks named in honor of General Benjamin O. Davis Jr., the only black cadet in his Class of 1936, the fourth in West Point’s history.\n\nDrawn to flight, General Davis would become a Tuskegee Airman and ultimately the first black Air Force officer to attain the rank of three stars; President Bill Clinton awarded him a fourth star later in life.\n\nBut at West Point, he was shunned. I noted the barracks honor with some irony — as a cadet, General Davis lived alone; no one would share his room. It saddens me to think that the honor and tradition of the academy that I love was set against then-cadet Davis.\n\nThe Davis Barracks dedication was a stark contrast to the riots in Charlottesville, Va., a roiling and tragic disgrace that unfolded barely one week before.\n\nAs a student of history, I recognize that each American generation, in its own way, has grappled with the stain of slavery and racism traced to the deep roots of our country. Yet we are inspired to see the courage shown by so many, like General Davis, to rise above those long and dark chapters, to build and improve our country despite its transgressions. Their lives demonstrated “all men are created equal” even before their society affirmed it. I rejoiced in West Point’s celebration of General Davis’s amazing life.\n\nTo honor these ideas, the Michelin Corporate Foundation has joined other donors to support the International African American Museum, which will be built at Gadsden’s Wharf in Charleston, the very place where hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans entered our country after the largest forced migration in human history. The museum has been embraced by South Carolina, which I hope played some role in the Lilly Endowment’s substantial gift of $10 million that was announced just recently. Michelin is proud to stand with them on this project.\n\nIn a time when communities are scrutinizing monuments and historical markers, I’m encouraged that this museum will present an accurate record and also celebrate those who suffered, who overcame extraordinary persecution, and who offered extraordinary contributions to the fabric of our culture.\n\nA bedrock principle in our culture at Michelin is respect for people — that is, respect for all people. As the largest private employer in South Carolina, I believe Michelin also bears a responsibility for advancing a public discussion about respect for people. In our plants and our offices, and even beyond, we can help our neighbors identify with the themes of diversity and inclusion by helping them understand the real struggles and histories of people who may look different, but share many of the same aspirations.\n\nHistory matters. People forget the diverse journeys of those who brought us to our current place and time. A greater and lasting good lies in using these symbols to teach our children — and perhaps to remind ourselves — the truth about our history instead of purging it.\n\nPete Selleck is chairman and president of Michelin North America, based in Greenville, S.C. Michelin, a global leader in sustainable mobility, employs more than 9,400 across 14 sites in South Carolina."
