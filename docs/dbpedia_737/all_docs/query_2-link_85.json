        "text": "The U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York named its newest cadet barracks after Air Force General Benjamin Oliver Davis Jr, whom graduated from West Point in 1936 with a commission as a second lieutenant of infantry. He later transferred to the Army Air Corps where he served as a Tuskegee Airman.\n\nDavis was the only black cadet at the academy in 1932.\n\nDespite being silenced during his four years at West Point, where no cadets, faculty or staff members befriended or spoke to him except on an official basis, he persevered to become the fourth African-American to graduate from West Point, ranking 35th in his class of 276.\n\nDavis continually faced segregation and discrimination throughout his career. He became the first officer to graduate from the Army Air Corps’ all-black flight training program, the Tuskegee Airmen. He was instrumental in developing the integration plan for the U.S. Air Force.\n\nDavis retired a three-star general in 1970. He was awarded a fourth star in 1998 by President Bill Clinton he died in 2002.\n\nUSMA paid homage to Davis’ legacy with the dedication of the newest, most innovative and eco-friendly barracks. U.S. Military Academy superintendent, Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr., along with West Point cadets, staff and faculty, and members of Davis’ family, cut the ribbon to the barracks that stands tall above the rest.\n\n“General Benjamin O. Davis Jr. exemplifies the West Point values of Duty, Honor and Country, and he exemplifies what it means to be a leader of character,” Caslen remarked. “We dedicate this new cadet barracks that bears his name, etched in stone, as a perpetual reminder of his incredible legacy and example that will inspire all future leaders of character that pass through West Point’s gates.”\n\nThe Davis Barracks was dedicated August 18. It is six stories tall, houses 650 cadets and has a granite exterior to match the Cadet Chapel looming on a hillside above.\n\n“He was determined to endure any ordeal; his perserverance showed how the spirit is not broken easily, choosing what was right,” declared Cadet Netteange Monaus. “He did not let his circumstances poison him; rather he turned the insults into fuel, bringing about change, and is forever carved into eternity.”\n\nOakland Post\n\nBy Emil Guillermo\n\nRemember Oakland five years ago when Kamala Harris invoked her Asian mother and announced a run for the presidency.\n\nAnd then came Iowa. She wasn’t ready.\n\nShe’s ready now.\n\nOn Monday, Joe Biden, still isolated with Covid, spoke via speaker phone to his campaign staff that early evening to tell them the truth behind his decision.\n\n“I know it’s hard because you’ve poured your heart and soul into me,” Biden told the campaigners who won him the nomination and then the presidency in 2020. But it wasn’t to be in 2024. “I think we made the right decision,” the president said.\n\nThe decision to withdraw came Sunday when Biden released a letter on social media with the shocking and historical news.\n\n“The name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn’t changed at all,” the president said.\n\nThat was essentially the passing of the torch, the flame. Or the passing of “duende”? That’s what Boston Globe columnist George Frazier, one of those who inspired the column form in me, might have called it.\n\nDuende is that charismatic allure that a world class performer has, that makes you constantly want to watch their every move. For a politician to possess it is pure gold.\n\nBiden had it throughout his long political and legislative career. And now, as he steps aside, and allows Harris, his Veep, to step forward, it was clear. She had it too. Duende. And much more of it than anyone ever thought.\n\nHarris addressed the cheering crowd, but was still aware of Biden’s presence. “We love Joe and Jill, we really do,” said Harris.\n\n“It’s mutual,” said Biden cutting in via speaker phone, almost like the Asian Filipino meaning of “duende,” which I’ve known as a spirit in the house, sometimes a helpful, loving one.\n\n“I knew you were still there,” Harris said looking up with a laugh. “You’re not going anywhere, Joe.”\n\n“I’m watching you kid, I love you,” Biden said.\n\n“I love you too,” Harris said, as the crowd cheered and clapped.\n\nThat made it official. The torch had been passed.\n\nGOP’S RESPONSE\n\nFor the most part Republicans heads’ are still spinning by Harris “duende express.” Some continue to “other” her by mispronouncing her name. It’s KAH-ma-la. Not kah-MAH-la.\n\nOr they’ve just relied on GOP racist rhetoric. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn) called her a “100 percent DEI hire,” a phrase intended to damn “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.” But Harris who has distinguished herself as a local district attorney, a state attorney general, a U.S. Senator and a U.S. vice president, has the resume any White male could envy.\n\nA more subtle approach was used by Sen. Tom Cotton (R.-Ark) Tuesday, who, in a TV interview, kept referring to Harris as a “San Francisco liberal.”\n\nCorrection. She’s really more of an Oakland liberal.\n\nI’m in exile now, but I’ve been writing columns as a “San Francisco liberal” for decades. One of my topics was District Attorney Kamala Harris. I always chided her for not going after White attacks on Asian Americans back in the day.\n\nI never spoke with Harris directly. But once at a fund-raiser our eyes met. We chose the diplomatic option and walked the other way.\n\nNow she’s on the verge of history and the duende is palpable.\n\nOakland Post\n\nBy Emil Guillermo\n\nIn corners of America dominated by MAGA disinformation, the concept of identity politics is vilified.\n\nIt goes hand in hand with the anti-DEI wave that’s trying to snuff out the modern civil rights movement.\n\nHere comes the good news.\n\nSo, you thought the dismantling of DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs in higher ed and corporate America meant diversity as a value in America is dead.\n\nThink again.\n\nKamala (as Harris says, “rhymes with mama-la”) just woke America back up.\n\nThe Zoom call as a mass fundraising tool is alive and well.\n\nThe frenzy began after the two big kickoff Zoom conference calls last week — Black women (90,000 attendees/$1.5 million raised, followed by Black men (232,000 attendees/$1.3 million raised).\n\nThis week, Asian American Filipinos got theirs on a teleconference that featured Filipino Americans like Alameda’s Rob Bonta, the California Attorney General.\n\nIt came one day after “White Dudes for Kamala” on Monday drew 200,000 participants, including actor Jeff Bridges who declared “I’m White, I’m a dude, and I’m for Harris.”\n\nThe “White Dudes” raised more than $4 million, a slightly larger amount than the call last week with more than 200,000 White women that raised $3.5 million\n\nOther recent Zoom calls included South Asian women (10,000 attendees/ $285,000 raised) and Latino Women (5,000 attendees/$110,000 raised).\n\nThe record haul after just one week of the campaign (over $200 million in all) shows grassroots America is falling hard for Kamala Harris.\n\nThe surge signals a revival of identity politics too often tamped down by Trump’s divisive MAGA beliefs.\n\nThe best put-down a GOP commentator on CNN could muster was to decry it all as the “Democrat obsession with racial segregation.”\n\nTypical response. It’s not segregation to bring disparate people together in coalition. That’s a celebration of diversity’s strength.\n\nNEW CALIFORNIA MEDIA\n\nIn the late ‘’90s and into the new millennium, I was part of a consortium of ethnic media organizations led by Sandy Close and the Pacific News Service that chronicled the rise of a New America. We started with California where minorities were already a majority, launching a television show called “NCM: New California Media.”\n\nAs host and executive producer, NCM was one of the first “Meet the Press”-style panel programs in any medium that included Asian, Latino, Black, Indian and LGBTQ journalists who covered us like we mattered.\n\nIt’s how I met the Oakland Post’s Tom Berkley and his daughter, Gail Berkley. The late Chauncey Bailey was a regular and my friend. Even Van Jones, long before he was with CNN, appeared on the program.\n\nWe covered politics for sure. But there was never one politician who could excite and harness the energy of all the various communities at once.\n\nGov. Pete Wilson? The recalled Gray Davis? Cruz Bustamante? Ah-nuld?\n\nThere was no one.\n\nBut there is now.\n\nThe future we anticipated and hoped for nearly 25 years ago has finally arrived in Kamala Harris.\n\nIs the Trump/Vance reaction weird? No, they’re just used to snuffing out diversity in favor of preserving their dwindling majority — like trying to dam up the natural flow of America.\n\nHarris has released our natural flow of diversity.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nEmil Guillermo is a journalist and commentator.
