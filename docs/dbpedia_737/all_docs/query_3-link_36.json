        "text": "âIn the rich tapestry of American history, the inspiring saga of the countryâs first two Black generals remains a lesser-known gem, hidden in the shadows of time. These trailblazers, courageous leaders, and unyielding advocates rose above adversity with the unwavering spirit of justice burning in their hearts. Their story serves as an enduring beacon of hope, a reminder that the path to equality and justice is not without challenges, but it is one worth traversing.â\n\nâBen Crump, Black Americaâs Attorney General\n\nâMelville traces his family's history to ensure their groundbreaking achievements are not forgotten.â\n\nâArlington Magazine\n\n\"Documenting unsparingly the opposition they had to overcome due solely to the color of their skin, Melville recounts [his family's] stories with deep emotion, sympathetic with their struggles and angry with the system that made these humans invisible.â\n\nâBooklist\n\nâThe book Black America needs in this moment. This American story is rooted in family, loyalty, heart, and excellence. Dougâs family is representative of our own families . . . rooted in the consistent legacies of connection, disruption, and love in ways we can all be proud of.â\n\nâEboni K. Williams, journalist, attorney, and author of Pretty Powerful\n\nâFor centuries, Black peopleâs contributions to American history have been overlookedâincluding their contributions to US military prowess. As Black Americans, our stories have power. And itâs long past time to reclaim that power.â\n\nâCharlamagne Tha God, New York Times bestselling author of Black Privilege\n\nâInvisible Generals is not Black history, nor military history, but American history. The militaryâs first two Black generals paved the way for so many not just in our military but for all Americansâyet they have been invisible for so long. This book will educate and inspire Americans to honor these heroes for their selfless contributions toward moving our nation forward.â\n\nâBRIGADIER GENERAL (RET.) LEON JOHNSON, former national president of Tuskegee Airmen, Inc."
