        "text": "The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) established the Air Force Academy Distinguished Service Award (DSA) in February 1999. Each year, the USAFA DSA is presented by the Superintendent to a military person, civilian, or group, whose contributions have had a distinct impact on the morale or well-being of the Air Force Academy. Any individual or group who has contributed significantly and directly to the morale or well-being of the Academy through the generous donation of time, resources, or influence is eligible.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\nAward selection is based on an individual’s or group’s accomplishments, which can be described as having had a long-term, positive effect on the morale or well-being of the Academy. Former military and civilian employees are eligible upon termination of employment from the Air Force Academy. However, the USAFA DSA is intended to recognize those individuals who contribute not as part of their official duty but through their personal generosity and dedication to the institution. Personnel currently assigned to the Academy can be considered for the award so long as their contributions were performed outside of their official duties.\n\nYear Recipient 2021 Colonel (Retired) Robert Munson 2020 Lieutenant Colonel (Ret) Garry W.

Each year the award is presented by the Superintendent and AOG to an active duty USAFA graduate whose airmanship contributions are of such significance as to set them apart from their contemporaries. Each major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency (FOA)–to include National Guard and the Reserve, and direct reporting unit (DRU) may submit one nomination for the award. Retired or separated graduates may be considered and should be nominated by corporate, civilian, government, or other organizations, as appropriate.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\nAward selection is based on airmanship contributions that are of such significance as to set the performer apart from their contemporaries. The definition of airmanship includes feats of aircrew members, as well as exceptional contributions with respect to design, production, or testing of an aerospace vehicle or its subsystems. Nominations will fall into one of the following categories:\n\nAn individual heroic act.\n\nSustained superior performance over a period of time. In this category, nominations may cover a broad spectrum ranging from crewmembers of an aerospace vehicle mission to an engineer or manager associated with the development of an aerospace vehicle.\n\nPast Jabara Award Winners:\n\n*Received Posthumously\n\n**Died Subsequently\n\nYear Recipient Description 2021 Maj Cameron Dilts, ’10 CV-22B Pilot, Iraq 2020 Capt Alexander E.
