While working at the Pentagon, Davis created the Air Force Demonstration Squadron, known as the Thunderbirds in 1953. Davis was inducted into the prestigious International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum in 1996.\n\nIn addition to Brigadier General Davis, the men and women featured in the \"Breaking Barriers\" exhibit include:\n\nVernice Armour: The first Black American woman naval aviator and first female combat aviator in the United States Marine Corps;\n\nJames Herman Banning and his mechanic, Thomas Cox Allen: The first Black Americans to fly across the United States on Oct. 9, 1932;\n\nGuion Stewart Bluford Jr.: The first Black American to travel to space on Aug. 30, 1983;\n\nJanet Harmon Bragg: The first Black American woman to earn a commercial pilot's license in 1942;\n\nWilla Beatrice Brown: The first Black American woman to earn a pilot's license within the United States and the first Black American officer in the Civil Air Patrol;\n\nEugene Jacques \"James\" Bullard: Flew for France during World War I as the first Black American military pilot;\n\nElizabeth \"Bessie\" Coleman: The first Black American woman and first Indigenous American to receive a pilot's license on June 15, 1921;\n\nMae Carol Jemison: The first Black American woman to travel into space on Sept. 12, 1992;\n\nLloyd W. \"Fig\" Newton: The first Black American pilot in the United States Air Force Demonstration Squadron known as the Thunderbirds; and\n\nWilliam Jenifer Powell: A pioneering advocate of Black aviation in the United States.\n\nThe exhibit and animatronic of Davis are located in the museum's World War II Gallery, which proudly displays a P-51 Mustang painted in the Tuskegee Airmen's distinctive \"Red Tail\" Squadrondesign to honor the United States Air Force's first all-Black American squadron."
