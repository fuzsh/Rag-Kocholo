        "text": "We need to collate more of these stories. Many photos have descriptions that say: Black nurses in World War 2 (as an example). We need to enrich our military history with much more detail about who was where and when - with names and their history, just like Lilian Bader below. I would encourage any family who has a story of a family member who served to make sure the story is celebrated and stored for our children and their children‚Äôs children. If you have a photo with a name but little else there are plenty of people who can help fill the gaps. Here are just a few: Sandra Patterson who collates the history of Caribbean soldiers - We Shall Tell Their Story. Kiran Sahota telling the stories of Indian women‚Äôs contributions to the world wars. National Army Museum who can help with research. Imperial War Museums, not to mention the regimental museums. Please, if you have a photo or a story of a family member who served and their service is not fully documented then why not get started so they can be remembered this year on Remembrance Sunday. I will absolutely help where I can. #SalutingOurSisters #BlackHistoryMonth #BlackHistory #IndianWomenatWar #militaryhistory #britisharmy\n\nFive interesting facts about about General Benjamin O.

We were good friends at Eton, and he used to boast about one day commanding his father's old regiment. I laughed, calling him a dreamer. Well, he made it to Colonel and got his wish, inviting me to Windsor for lunch with his regiment. It was an eye-opening experience to see my mate Johnny as a Colonel, with tall guardsmen saluting him just as he had promised. I noticed the soldiers staring at me suspiciously. After a terrible lunch with the officers, including a stunning blonde female officer kicking me under the table, I asked Johnny why his men looked ready to slit my throat. He laughed and explained, \"The Queen wants Black officers in her guards regiment, and they think you're the new Black officer.\" We both broke out laughing, and I felt proud of my friend. Let's look at the British Army's diversity. As of 2023, about 48% of minority personnel in the UK Regular Forces were Black. However, racism remains an issue. The 2020 BBC documentary \"Racism in the Ranks\" highlighted frequent racial discrimination. Only 0.4% of senior officers are Black, indicating systemic issues. The British Army has implemented the 2023 Race Action Plan, but progress is debated. Efforts to improve diversity and combat racism continue, but challenges remain. #BritishArmy #ScotsGuards #EtonCollege #Diversity #Inclusion #BlackOfficers #RacismInTheRanks #MilitaryLeadership\n\nLegislation requiring Maryland's governor to annually proclaim March 9 as 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion Day is under consideration. This battalion is notable for being a predominantly black and multi-ethnic unit, that sorted 18 million letters for U.S. troops in WWII. Efforts to bring recognition to this group have been largely led by retired Colonel Edna Cummings and retired Master Sergeant Elizabeth Anne Helm-Frazier. In addition to this, there are plans to erect a monument at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to commemorate the battalion's service. Furthermore, the article notes a forthcoming Broadway musical, a Netflix movie, and many other state and local proclamations focusing on the battalion's history. As Black women heroes are celebrated this month, what are your thoughts on the importance of such recognition, and how might it impact perceptions and understanding of history? Lastly, the potential for March 9 to become 6888th Day nationwide is also proposed, further amplifying the reach of this commemorative act. https://ow.ly/nlFh50QPuCE\n\nBlack veterans have played a significant role in shaping the trajectory of American history since the nation's inception. Their contributions have been profound and multifaceted, influencing military campaigns, civil rights movements, and societal progress. Understanding the historical numbers of Black soldiers provides a glimpse into the magnitude of their impact. The legacy of Black veterans continued to evolve throughout the 20th century after serving in both the American Revolutionary War and the Civil War. In World War I, over 350,000 Black soldiers served in segregated units, demonstrating valor and resilience in the face of adversity. World War II marked another significant milestone, as over 1.2 million Black soldiers served in various capacities, including the famed Tuskegee Airmen and the 761st Tank Battalion. Their contributions helped secure victory overseas and fueled the momentum for civil rights back home. Today, Black veterans serve honorably in the armed forces, contributing to the nation's defense while advocating for equality and justice. Their enduring legacy serves as a reminder of the invaluable role they have played and continue to play in shaping America's history and identity. ‚ÄúYour New Dawn Awaits‚Äù Available 24/7 for Help üì≤ 702-595-2995 www.firstdawnrecovery.com #firstdawnrecovery #veteranrecovery #veteranrehabilitation #rehabilitationcenter #mentalhealth #veteranmentalhealth #lasvegasrecoverycenter #lasvegasrecovery"
