The TV gods giveth and taketh, and all the new series we're getting means we have to make room by saying farewell to some of our old favorites. Whether they've naturally run their courses and are leaving on their own terms or they're the victim of bad ratings and budget cuts, it's never easy to watch them go. There are several landmark series ending in 2022, including black-ish, This Is Us, and The Walking Dead, and plenty more that were unexpectedly canceled, like Westworld, DC's Legends of Tomorrow, and Legacies.

Here are the shows ending in 2022.

Amphibia is a refreshing cartoon that's been praised by critics for its storyline, animation, and more. The series centers around Anne (voiced by Brenda Song, who is right at home on Disney Channel) and her friends' adventures who are separated after being transported to the titular world. There's impressive character development and lessons throughout all three seasons, and it's something children and adults alike can enjoy. Much to the dismay of its fans, the series was canceled after the third season aired in May 2022.

Annaleigh Ashford and Thomas Middleditch starred in this Chuck Lorre comedy about a therapist in need of a kidney and the woman who offers to give him hers.

Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) will complete his transition to Saul Goodman in the final season of Better Call Saul, the prequel series to Breaking Bad. The final season will be split into two halves (meaning it is possible that the show's ending could even be pushed to 2023, pending AMC's release schedule). Burning questions will be answered â€” primarily what happens to Rhea Seahorn's Kim Wexler, and whether this excellent piece of television will finally get the Emmy Awards it deserves.

black-ish came to an end after eight season and dozens of awards and nominations. The series, from creator Kenya Barris, stars Tracee Ellis Ross and Anthony Anderson as the parents of a Black family living in an affluent, mostly white neighborhood. The warm-hearted comedy has tackled sensitive issues, including class, colorism, the reappropriation of the N-word, white feminism, the rise of white nationalism during and after the 2016 presidential election, and more. The series has spawned two spin-offs: grown-ish on Freeform and the prequel mixed-ish, which ran on ABC for two seasons.

After six seasons, CBS's embattled legal drama Bull is finally coming to an end on May 26. The show made headlines in 2018 when The New York Times reported on an alleged $9.5 million settlement paid to actress Eliza Dushku; Dushku was written off the show after she accused star Michael Weatherly of sexual harassment in a series of comments caught on tape. Weatherly apologized, and CBS later defended its decision to renew the show, saying that Weatherly was a "father" who "wanted to make it better," and pointing to Bull's continued popularity. "It's a show that does very well," CBS Entertainment President Kelly Kahl said at the time. "Michael is loved by our audience, and even after these allegations came out, people continued to watch." While initially a big hit for the network, the show's ratings have dwindled in recent years. In January, Weatherly announced he was departing "to pursue new creative challenges," and CBS confirmed the show was ending.

The CW's reboot of the beloved witchy drama introduced three new and much more diverse sisters as the Charmed ones, and even mirrored the original series by killing off one sister after season three and introducing a mysterious replacement.

The quirkiest entry in the Arrowverse was canceled in the spring of 2022 after seven seasons. In years past, The CW has been very gracious in allowing long-running shows enough time and notice to wrap stories up in a satisfying manner, but Legends of Tomorrow ended with a big cliffhanger, as the producers were anticipating a renewal. It's a big letdown for fans and a sad way to see this delightful and ambitious show say goodbye.

We're already mourning Dead to Me, which is ending with the show's third and final season, expected to be released in 2022. The dark dramedy stars Christina Applegate as foul-mouthed widow Jen and Linda Cardellini as her best friend, Judy, who accidentally killed Jen's husband in a hit-and-run. The show became a favorite binge thanks to Applegate and Cardellini's magnetic performances, as well as its jaw-dropping cliffhangers, outrageous twists, and madcap sense of humor.

How to watch: Showtime

This Showtime series gave a fresh take on history as seen through the eyes of the women in The White House as well as their impact on politics, with Viola Davis as Michelle Obama, Michelle Pfeiffer as Betty Ford, and Gillian Anderson as Eleanor Roosevelt.

How to watch: HBO Max

HBO Max canceled this series about Cucu Castelli (Olivia Goncalves), who narrates her youth in the 1980s as a young immigrant to America, after just one season, stating that "Live-action kids and family programming will not be part of our programming focus in the immediate future, and as a result, we've had to make the very difficult decision to end Gordita Chronicles at HBO Max."

How to watch: AMC+

This inventive dark comedy followed a put-upon sitcom wife (Annie Murphy) outside her life on the TV show, bouncing back and forth between multi-camera and single-camera formats as she dreamed of a better life (and killing her husband). The format proved to be too much for critics, who didn't think the show pulled off the concept well. A second and final season will air in 2022.

How to watch: The CW

The CW's Legends of the Hidden Temple was a grown-up take on the adorably cheesy late-'90s game show that saw kids answering trivia questions and competing in physical challenges to win cool prizes like boomboxes and trips to NASA's Space Camp. The reboot, however, attempted to appeal to nostalgic adults instead of adventurous kids; this time, full-grown adults compete for much bigger cash prizes on an outdoor "jungle" set. The show didn't make it to a second season.

Hulu's spin-off of the YA film Love, Simon will end in June of 2022 after three seasons.

He reaches out to Simon (Nick Robinson), who helps him through his turbulent journey to coming out. In the second season, Victor is out of the closet but has to deal with the fallout of who he kept his secret from and why. Here's to hoping the third season brings Victor some peace and long-lasting self-actualization.

NBC's decision in June 2021 to cancel Manifest after three seasons was met with an outcry from fans who were afraid they would never find out how Flight 828 went down, or what really happened to everyone on that doomed airplane. But after Manifest spent weeks leading Netflix's Top 10 Rankings, Netflix announced on Aug. 28 it would pick up the show for a 20-episode fourth and final season. The season will be released as a Netflix exclusive in multiple parts (meaning there's a chance fans might not get the final episodes until after 2022). Hopefully, the Flight 828 passengers get a happy ending, too.

"We have enjoyed a good partnership with HBO Max and are working closely to find a new opportunity for Minx, so current, and new viewers, can continue this journey with us," Lionsgate said in a statement.

Some beloved sitcom properties of yesteryear shouldn't be touched, but showrunner Tracey Wigfield made something relevant, fun, and nostalgic with her Saved by the Bell revival on Peacock. Anchored by an all-star comedic performance from Josie Totah, the series felt fresh for a teen audience of today without alienating fans of the original series who could appreciate the new take's self-awareness and meta-jokes. Peacock canceled the series after two seasons.

Space Force had all of the ingredients to make a great comedy: an all-star cast including Steve Carell and John Malkovich, the creative genius mind of The Office (U.S.) creator Greg Daniels, and a Netflix budget.

The series ended after three seasons, with creator Abi Morgan saying "It was always the plan and in fact I don't think I'm saying anything out of turn here, the BBC would have loved us to have gone on really.

HBO canceled the show after its first six-episode season, most likely due to low ratings.

The show is a spin-off of the network's Nancy Drew series, in which Tom Swift (Tian Richards) made an appearance in Season 2. However, the ratings were so low on this show, it was an easy decision to kill it halfway through Season 1, especially during The CW's TV series canceling bender this year.
