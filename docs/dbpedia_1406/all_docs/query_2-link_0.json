It was created in 1947 by Canadian director Fletcher Markle, who came to CBS from the CBC. It premiered on November 7, 1948, and ended on September 29, 1958, with a total of 467 episodes over the course of 10 seasons.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 29, 1947, Fletcher Markle launched the 60-minute CBS Radio series with an adaptation of Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano. Broadcast on Tuesdays opposite Fibber McGee and Molly and The Bob Hope Show at 9:30 pm Eastern Time, the radio series continued until July 27, 1948, showcasing such adaptations as Dodsworth, Pride and Prejudice, The Red Badge of Courage and Ah, Wilderness. Top performers were heard on this series, including John Garfield, Walter Huston, Mercedes McCambridge, Burgess Meredith and Robert Mitchum.\n\nCBS Radio received a Peabody Award for Studio One in 1947, citing Markle's choice of material and the authenticity of his adaptations \"in a production, which at its best, is distinguished for its taste, restraint, and radio craftsmanship\".[1]\n\nMove to television\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1948, Markle transitioned from radio to television. Sponsored by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the television series was seen on CBS (which Westinghouse later owned between 1995 and 2000), from 1948 through 1958, under several variant titles: Studio One Summer Theatre, Studio One in Hollywood, Summer Theatre, Westinghouse Studio One and Westinghouse Summer Theatre. It was telecast in black-and-white only.\n\nOffering a wide range of dramas, Studio One received Emmy nominations every year from 1950 to 1958. The series staged some notable and memorable teleplays among its 467 episodes. Some created such an impact, they were adapted into theatrical films. William Templeton's 1953 adaptation of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, starring Eddie Albert as Winston Smith, led to the 1956 feature-film version with Edmond O'Brien in the principal role. Reginald Rose's drama \"Twelve Angry Men\", about the conflicts of jurors deciding a murder case, originated on Studio One on September 20, 1954; and the 1957 motion picture remake with Henry Fonda was nominated for three Academy Awards. Sal Mineo had the title role in the January 2, 1956, episode of Reginald Rose's \"Dino\", and he reprised the role for the film Dino (1957).\n\nIn 1954, \"Crime at Blossoms\", scripted by Jerome Ross, was given an Edgar Award for Best Episode in a TV Series. Nathaniel Hawthorne's granddaughter received a plaque in recognition of her grandfather's writing achievements during the April 3, 1950, telecast of The Scarlet Letter. \"The Night America Trembled\"[2] was Studio One's September 9, 1957, top-rated television recreation of Orson Welles' October 30, 1938, radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds. The cast included Alexander Scourby, Ed Asner (credited as Edward Asner) and Vincent Gardenia; James Coburn (credited as Jim Coburn), Warren Beatty and Warren Oates all made their television debuts in bit parts. John Astin appeared uncredited as a reporter.\n\nAnother notable presentation was an adaptation in 1952 of a medieval mystery play about the Nativity of Jesus, \"The Nativity\", based on the Chester and York Mystery Plays of the 14th and 15th centuries, reworked into Elizabethan English. With musical accompaniment by the Robert Shaw Chorale, and presented during the Christmas season of 1952, it was one of the few medieval mystery plays telecast on commercial network television. The cast included Thomas Hardie Chalmers, Miriam Wolfe, Hurd Hatfield and Paul Tripp.[3]\n\nDuring the 1953 presentation \"Dry Run\", whole sections of a submarine were built inside the studio, and the entire cast was nearly electrocuted when water that was being used for special effects got very close to power cables.[4]\n\nWorthington Miner, Martin Manulis and others produced. As the official commercial spokeswoman for Westinghouse, Betty Furness became strongly identified with the Westinghouse products she advertised and demonstrated during the commercial breaks, and she was also seen as an actress in eight Studio One dramas. The show's musical directors were Milton C. Anderson, who also created music for Playhouse 90, and Eugene Cines. The show's musical orchestra was also directed in several episodes during the 1950s by Alfredo Antonini.[citation needed]\n\nThe show's run ended when Westinghouse switched its sponsorship to the Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, which premiered in 1958.[5] The series finished at number 24 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1950–1951 season.[6][self-published source]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nLost episode\n\n[edit]\n\nFor years, the second half of the original TV production of \"Twelve Angry Men\" was considered lost. However, in 2003, Joseph Consentino, a researcher-producer for The History Channel, discovered a complete kinescope of the Studio One production in the home of the late New York defense attorney (and later judge) Samuel Leibowitz. Consentino was researching a History Channel documentary about Leibowitz, and the discovery was announced by the Museum of Television & Radio (now The Paley Center for Media).[7]\n\nMany Studio One episodes are available for viewing at the Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles, and some are available through Amazon Prime Video.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Result Emmy Award Category Recipient 1950 Nominated Best Kinescope Show\n\n–\n\n1951 Best Dramatic Show\n\n–\n\n1952 Won\n\n–\n\n1953 Nominated\n\n–\n\n1954\n\n–\n\n1955 Best Individual Program of the Year\n\n–\n\nBest Dramatic Show\n\n–\n\nWon Best Written Dramatic Material Reginald Rose (For \"Twelve Angry Men\") Best Direction Franklin J.
