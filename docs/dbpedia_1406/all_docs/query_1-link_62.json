        "text": "Shipyard Games, a Finnish developer best known for the mobile game Go City, has quietly closed after a seven-year run.\n\nPer PocketGamer, the studio had previously disclosed the news back in May through its Discord. At the time, co-founder/CEO Andreas Wedenberg called it a \"critical\" situation, saying the company had run out of money and that its current investor had ended support.\n\nThe investor, Supercell, put a $2.9 million minority stake into the Helsinki developer back in 2017. At the time, Shipyard had only been a few months old, and it's unclear when or why Supercell put its wallet away.\n\nShipyard's most recent (and final) release was Wizards & Kingdoms Go, which Wedenberg acknowledged really only had \"1-2 weeks\" worth of content in its early state. With the studio gone, the game will receive no more updates and eventually go offline.\n\n\"We sincerely appreciate so much all of your help. [...] We are very sorry we could not finish the game you all deserve,\" he concluded, \"but unfortunately often dreams need money to become true, and we ran out of it.\""
