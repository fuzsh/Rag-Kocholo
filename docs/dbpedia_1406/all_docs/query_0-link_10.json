        "text": "‘The Mindy Project’\n\nMindy Kaling's critically acclaimed but low-rated series may not return for season four on Fox, with sources telling THR the network has passed on bringing it back, and that studio Universal Television is in talks with Hulu for a multiple season renewal. For Hulu, the Mindy acquisition comes as the streaming service has been bulking up on original scripted programming with pricey buys from the major studios.\n\n‘Full House’\n\nOn April 20, John Stamos announced on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that a revival of the beloved ABC family sitcom Full House would be making its way to Netflix. The sequel, titled Fuller House, will run for 13 episodes and feature original cast members Candace Cameron-Bure,Jodie Sweetin andAndrea Barber. Stamos will produce the series, premiering sometime in 2016, and reprise his role as Uncle Jesse in guest cameos (former cast mates Bob Saget, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Dave Coulier and Lori Loughlin are still in talks of joining).\n\n‘Coach’\n\nEighteen years after Coach left the airwaves in 1997, the Barry Kemp-created show is returning with Craig T. Nelson as the lead. Kemp will also return to write and exec produce the NBC sequel. The revival has been in the works for months, but a premiere date for the series has not yet been determined.\n\n‘The X-Files’\n\nAfter months of rumors, X-Files fans are finally getting their wish: Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are returning to TV and to their original network, FOX. Both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson will reprise their roles and series creator and executive producer Chris Carter is also returning for a limited 6-part run. Production on the series starts this summer, with a premiere date to be announced at a later date.\n\n‘Veronica Mars’\n\nThe fans of Veronica Mars took less than 24 hours to raise $2 million for a film continuation of the high school noir on Kickstarter.com. The film is targeting a summer 2014 release, and the campaign's success has stirred speculation that other dead TV shows might be revived in such a way.\n\n‘The Flintstones’\n\nFred and Wilma are etched in stone in the pop culture psyche, though their show was unceremoniously pulled from the air in 1966 after six seasons. But the theatrical release of the spy spoof The Man Called Flintstone later that year reinvigorated the prehistoric brand’s popularity and helped pave the way for dozens of TV series, made-for-TV movies and feature films.\n\n‘Dallas’\n\nThe iconic primetime soap ran for an impressive 14 seasons and 357 episodes (plus several made-for-TV movies and a reunion special). Twenty-one years after the show signed off, it was revived by TNT in 2012 for a series featuring original stars Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray and Larry Hagman alongside a new castmembers Josh Henderson and Jesse Metcalfe. Hagman (J.R. Ewing) died in November 2012, and his character will be given a sendoff during the show's second season.\n\n‘Doctor Who’\n\nAn enduring part of pop culture in Britain and beyond, Doctor Who ran for 26 seasons from 1963-89. After cancellation, it was kept alive in book and made-for-TV movie form. It finally returned as a full-fledged series in 2005 under the auspices of Russell T Davies. To date, 11 actors have played the Doctor, the time traveling alien at the center of the show’s action.\n\n‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar's Buffy Summers is so resilient that the character managed to be resurrected from the dead multiple times during her seven seasons on TV. So its fitting that after the successful show from Joss Whedon ended, its story was continued in the form of an official comic book, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight.\n\n‘Baywatch’\n\nTV viewers almost got just one season to ogle the babes and hunks of Baywatch. With the show canceled after its first 13 episodes, star David Hasselhoff managed to revive it for syndication, during which it helped introduce the world to the likes of Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra. The Baywatch team called it quits for good in 2001 after 11 seasons.\n\n‘7th Heaven’\n\nIt wasn’t quite time for this drama to move to the afterlife. Though CW execs had announced 7th Heaven would end with its season 10 finale in 2006, the episode received such high ratings (pulling 7 million viewers) that it was renewed for another season. But ratings for season 11 tanked, and the Camden family’s story ended for good in May 2007.\n\n‘Arrested Development’\n\nRich in critical acclaim but poor in viewership, Fox killed Arrested Development after an abbreviated third season. But the show developed a devoted fan base on DVD. Talk of a movie starring the Bluths was bandied about for years, until it was announced the show would indeed return for a fourth season in 2013, this time on Netflix.\n\n‘Family Guy’\n\nThe Griffin family had a crisis on its hands when their show was put on ice after season three. But strong DVD sales as well as the following it cultivated thanks to Adult Swim reruns led Fox to rethink the decision and bring the show back in 2004.\n\n‘The Killing’\n\nNot so fast — The Killing wasn’t killed off after all, even though AMC declined to renew the series for a third season in 2012. A deal was hammered out in which AMC would share the cost of production of Netflix. AMC will air episodes first, with Netflix allowed to stream them afterward.\n\n‘Jericho’\n\nCBS was willing to let Jericho go after a low-rated first season. But a fan outcry saw the network inundated with mail, phone calls and packages of nuts, all urging it to keep the post-apocalyptic show. (The nuts were a reference to the season finale, in which a character yells “nuts!” in response for a call for the town of Jericho to surrender.) That passion convinced CBS to give the show a second chance and to order seven new episodes of the series. The reprieve was short-lived, and it was soon canceled again for good.\n\n‘Entourage’\n\nVincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) and the boys left HBO’s airwave in 2011 after eight seasons. The finale saw big changes for the characters, including marriage, retirement and multimillion-dollar deals (and not for whom you’d expect). The show’s creators teased its big-screen potential even before it was off the air, and a film version officially received the greenlight in January 2013.\n\n\"We had very strong female characters, but we want the guys to get back to just being guys,” executive producer Mark Wahlberg said of the project. “Everyone wants to see them get nuts again.\"\n\n‘Community’\n\n#SixSeasonsAndAMovie seemed to be a far-fetched goal after the cult comedy was canceled by NBC following its fifth season, but high viewership on Hulu’s streaming services and a fervent social media campaign by loyal fans inspired Yahoo Screen to pick up the show for 13 new episodes set to air online in fall 2014. Thanks to Sony Pictures and their “community” of fans, Dan Harmon and Joel McHale can check season 6 off their back-to-school shopping lists."
