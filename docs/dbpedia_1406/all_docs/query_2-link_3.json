        "text": "This live dramatic series featured original stories and adaptations of novels, plays, etc., during its eight-year run. During the first year, the show was sponsored by the Actor's Equity Association, and featured adaptations of Broadway plays and musicals. Bert Lytell, the former President of the Association, acted as host. During the second season, an agreement was made with the Book-of-the-Month Club, and the plays were adaptations of current novels. Starting in the third season, the television plays were adaptations of plays, novels, dramas, etc., by known and unknown authors. The title of the show was changed to \"Repertory Theatre\" (1949) for episodes 1.29 to 1.31 and \"Arena Theatre\" (1949) for episodes 1.32 to 1.38. Effective with episode 1.39, the original title was used. Starting with the fourth season, this show alternated weekly with \"The Goodyear Theatre\" (1951); starting in the eighth season, this program alternated with \"The Goodyear Theatre\" (1951) and \"The ALCOA Hour\" (1955).\n\nAn anthology series hosted by Betty Furness in the first season, and Desi Arnaz in the second. Stories came from several genres, often based on fact. A two part episode was spun off as the popular show The Untouchables (1959).\n\nThe award winning bing play of Mary Chase came to television in 1958. It tells the story of Elwood P. Dowd (Art Carney), a personable chap who drinks a little, and befriends a \"pookah\", a six foot rabbit he calls \"Harvey\". Unfortunately, his sister and main caregiver Veta Louise Simmons formation Lorne, and her spinster daughter Myrtle Mae, have had Elwood's condition negatively affect their social lives. Elwood's engaging personality with its one flaw creates problems for those around him. So his sister, thinking it is in his best interests, seeks a cure for her brother's problem. But nothing is ever that simple."
