I remember when ITV first became available on satellite, when testing you would see colour bars with a black bar accross the middle with the William Road ident. So there must be switching and distribution facilities along there. So Stephen St. TCR, BT Tower, William Road and of course up to 1993 Thames Euston, all within close proximity.\n\nIf you continue walking up Tottenham Court Road and cross over Euston Road and keep going up Hampstead Road you will find about two turnings up on the left hand side William Road.

Wonder what ITV would have looked like if Thames had retained the franchise and Granada had lost their's.\n\nI think LE wise itv would have had more variety, but it would have been all the poorer without Granada and dare I say no CS. The ideal solutionwould have been if all the franchise holders had not lost their licences.\n\nI think Thames and LWT were talking to each other early 90s to form a shared playout and news service , should they both have won the 1991 round ?\n\nIn the end it happened with Carlton, but quite honestly it would have happened if either Thames or LWT (or both) had lost their franchise(s)\n\nInteresting that Carlton improved local regional programming but could not match Thames in terms of programming for the ITV network.

If the lunchtime presenter is sitting at the large desk for the national news, she remains at the same desk to do the five minute London news although the backdrop changes. Apart from the two desks and the platforms they are mounted on, the studio is entirely green. Presenters aren't allowed to wear items of green clothing. When a presenter is interviewing someone who is appearing o a \"tv screen\", that is illusion, they are in fact looking at the wall. They may be able to see the interviewee on a monitor out of shot of the cameras."
