        "text": "Columbia Ranch (name circa 1960)\n\nCurrently: Warner Ranch\n\nLocation: corner of Hollywood Way and Oak Street, Burbank, California\n\n(the Columbia Ranch is grouped with the studios here in Section 1 because it also contained soundstages and because of its location in Burbank)\n\nthe Ranch started in 1934, as a 40 acre plot purchased by Harry Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures Corporation.\n\n\"Over the years, Columbia Pictures sold off much of its 80-acre Burbank ranch to developers. Columbia's ranch had acted as the studio's backlot since 1935, with its scenery of grassy park and fountain, Old West street (destroyed by fire in 1970), and facades of city buildings, townhouses and suburban homes (including the Bewitched house).\"\n\na 1957 aerial photo \"shows the single soundstage Columbia built at the ranch. Later, in the late 1950s, a second stage was built right next to it. Also, you can make out Columbia's special effects water tank with its sky backing almost dead center. Up to right where there's a semi-circular backing was the spot the lamasery set was built for Frank Capra's LOST HORIZON. Today that portion of the lot has a large drugstore and a parking lot. Many year ago Columbia sold off a portion of the lot to a developer.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"The real street used in the Blondie movies was right near CBS Studios. I took some photos when I was there last year. One of the houses was later recreated at the Columbia/Warner ranch...which later became the I Dream of Jeannie house.\" - Anthony\n\n\"The (new) \"re-created\" Blondie house at the Columbia Ranch from the early 1940s was indeed used for the exterior on Jeannie, as well as Mr.Wilson's house on Dennis, and the Anderson house on Father Knows Best, during the 1950s/60s. It's still standing, has most likely been used for numerous other TV shows and movies, as well as commercials throughout the decades.\" - Mark J. C.\n\n\"[In Bewitched,] I seem to remember the Kravitzes front house exterior being the house that would later become (or by 1970/71 was already) the Partridges' house [but in the episode \"Mary the Good Fairy,\"] there's a closeup of Gladys Kravitz gasping as she sees the police picking up Mary. and Mrs. Kravitz is [standing instead on the front porch of] the Donna [Reed] house (and also Dennis Mitchell's house).\" - Mark J. C.\n\n\"I think they used a different exterior for the Kravitz house in that two-parter as the former house suffered some damage in a backlot fire.\" - Anthony\n\nin 1970, three successive fires (in January, April and August) destroyed half the lot\n\nin mid-1971, became a combined Columbia and Warner ranch\n\n1990 - Columbia left, and ranch became The Warner Ranch\n\n\"all of the houses on the Warner Ranch are now complete structures. I don't think there are any \"facades\" left. Some of the \"facades\" have been enclosed within the past decade to protect the sets from water damage.\" - William F., Jr.\n\nFather Knows Best\n\nDennis the Menace\n\nThe Donna Reed Show\n\nHazel\n\nThe Hathaways\n\nThe Farmers Daughter\n\nOur Man Higgins\n\nGidget\n\nBewitched\n\nI Dream of Jeannie\n\nThe Flying Nun (Convent set)\n\nThe Monkees\n\nRoute 66\n\nThe Partridge Family - exteriors AND interiors (on soundstages at ranch)\n\nCamp Runamuck\n\nHere Come the Brides\n\nThe Wackiest Ship in the Army\n\nFantasy Island\n\nEight is Enough\n\nColumbia Ranch / Warner Ranch History Websites:\n\nThe Unofficial Columbia Ranch Site\n\n1164 Morning Glory Circle: Warner Bros.

Cahuenga, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California\n\nbegan in 1915 as Metro Pictures back lot #3\n\nstudios constructed (as Equity Studios) in 1946...built primarily as a rental lot leasing space to independent producers\n\nrenamed Motion Picture Center Studios in January, 1947\n\n1953 - leased by Desilu Studios\n\n1956 - renamed to Desilu-Cahuenga Studios\n\n1967 - sold to Gulf & Western (Paramount)\n\n1969 - sold to Cinema General Studios\n\n1974 - Television Center Studios\n\n\"At one point, it was used as Lambert's Van & Storage, with only three of the nine sound stages occupied by a production company, Television Center Studios.\"\n\n1984 - Ren-Mar Studios\n\n2010 - Red Studios\n\nthere was no backlot, but some houses across the street on Lillian Way were used for occasional exterior filming (including as \"Thelma Lou's\" house on The Andy Griffith Show)\n\n\"Old Desilu production schedule reports reveal that The Andy Griffith Show reserved Desilu-Cahuenga's Stage 1 and 2 for Thursday through Wednesday shoots (with weekends off) for each of the 249 episodes they produced.\"\n\n\"It seems that Desilu-Cahuenga has always been a tough lot to \"visit\". I, too, had a similar opportunity in the late 60's and took advantage of an open gate on the north end of the lot. A large flatbed truck had just entered the lot and no one was standing by to close and lock the gate. I took advantage of the situation and walked in, making a quick left at the first studio door. I believe this was the old I Love Lucy stage but I'm not positive. Inside, they were shooting some interiors of Gomer Pyle USMC. Jim Nabors was sitting in one of those typical high chairs off to the side of where they were shooting some close-ups of Frank Sutton sitting behind his desk. The script girl was feedsing him the lines. When they stopped to re-set and load I started up a conversation with Jim Nabors....what a nice guy. Very pleasent and asked no questions about who I was. I guess he figured that if was in there it must be okay! After about 15 or 20 minutes of watching the action I went back out onto the lot and went to the next studio which was under the same roof as the Gomer studio. I recognized the set as that being from That Girl. No one was there so I just looked around taking it all in. After that I went to another stage at the other end and there was the set for a show that only ran for a season or two called Good Morning World, about two L.A. disc jockeys that did a morning wake-up radio show. Desilu was a very secure facility and I felt real lucky to have the chance to see it from the inside. Getting out was easy. I just walked out through the front gate. The guards wished me a good afternoon!\" - Mark B.\n\nproductions ceased on this lot for several years in the 1970's, during which time some soundstages were used for furniture storage, and at least one was used as a tennis court. In 1981's \"The Andy Griffith Show Book,\" Andy Griffith recalled a visit to the lot during this time period:\n\n\"I was going to tell you a sad thing. Over on the corner of Cahuenga, near Melrose, there was a small studio. It's no longer a studio anymore. Part of it is indoor tennis courts and part of it is a huge warehouse for furniture that these big trucks haul to various points. I was over that way a year or two ago, and I just decided I would stop and see what was going on. So I went and looked onstage - stages one and two - that's where we spent 8 years - and they were storing furniture there. This whole studio, I understand, was built during the war, with inferior equipment. They were constantly digging up pipes for leaks. The roofs leaked. Don [Knotts] and I used to do scenes when it rained, and it would often rain in between us. Anyway, there were nine stages on that little lot, and for ten or fifteen years almost all of the comedy that came out of this town came out of that little studio. About 1970 a lot of shows went off the air or were cancelled. I had an aborted show that year [Headmaster] and we moved to Warner Brothers. Mayberry moved to Warner Brothers too.

All but the first one were knocked down. Then right behind the remaining glass stage, a large enclosed stage building containing stages 2,3 & 4 was built. Stage 2 had a higher roof. Still does. Stage 2 opens into stage 3. So when stages 2 & 3 are combined, it makes a stage approximately 32,532 sq. feet. Back when RKO owned the lot, the largest stage was stage 15. It was over 33,000 sq.feet The stage could be flooded. When Desilu bought the RKO Pathe lot, they divided 15 into two stages.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"On December 12, 1964, producer Gene Roddenberry filmed his first \"Star Trek\" pilot \"The Cage\" at Stages 14, 15, and 16 at Desilu in Culver City. They went over and it took 12 days to shoot it, just a few days outside the normal range for filming a 50 minute pilot film. The following year in 1965, the network that he was trying to sell it to for a television series, NBC Television, rejected the pilot. A second pilot script was written, along with two others \"Mudd's Women\" and \"The Omega Glory\", but Roddenberry went with \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" to film as the second pilot with filming starting on Monday, July 19th, 1965. The pilot shoot would wrap 8 days later on July 27th, 1965. Filming was once again at Desilu at Culver on Stages 15 and 16 and by spring of 1966, the pilot sold to NBC.\" - Daniel R.\n\n\"I read somewhere that the second pilot for STAR TREK was shot on stage 15 at Desilu-Culver. It seems there was a nest of hornets up in the rafters that the production disturbed. Several people were stung including Shatner.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"Just about all the original sound stages at RKO Pathe had internal sound-proofed doors that opened up so two, even three stages could become one. Stages 2,3 & 4 were all interconnected. Stage 2 had a higher roof for filming scenes simulated inside a theater. Stage 2 was the theater stage while stage 3 had the auditorium seats. Paramount had the same setup with stages 6 & 7. MGM had the biggest theater stage which was combined 5 & 6. Stage 6 had a clearance of 80 feet making it the highest stage of all the major studios. At the old Vitagraph Studio in East Hollywood (later home to KABC TV), there was the Vitaphone Stage used for the WB film 42nd STREET. It was first used for THE JAZZ SINGER. Part of it, the higher section, still exists.\" - Richard P.\n\nThe stage used for at least one of the Star Trek pilots: \"The DeMille stage was built at the end off 1926 for the film, King of Kings (1927). It was later soundproofed by Pathe after DeMille left the lot in 1929. So people still referred to it as a 'silent era' stage...[The stage] still exists and is the largest one on the lot.\" - Marc W.\n\n\"William Shatner described the Culver stages as being in extremely poor condition. He also talked about the sets being very limited in how they could be filmed as they were built for specific shots instead of the walls being able to be moved around easily. When they [Star Trek] were moved to Gower parts of them were rebuilt to be easier to use.\" - William F., Jr.\n\n\"The Culver Stages and the 40A backlot were indeed shabby with paint peeling off the walls and the old dirty soundproofing in the stages, but it was heaven for me as it was 'dripping' of history.\" - Marc W.\n\n1967 - sold to Gulf & Western Industries / Paramount Studios\n\n1968 - sold to Perfect Film & Chemical\n\n1969 - sold to Toronto-based OSF Industries, Ltd. and called Beverly Hills Studios\n\n1970 - renamed Culver City Studios\n\n1976 - \"40 Acres\" backlot sold to developers\n\n1977 - became Laird International Studios, a rental facility\n\n1986 - studios sold to Grant Tinker and Gannett Company\n\n1991 - sold to Sony Corporation\n\n2004 - sold to PCCP Studio City Los Angeles\n\nStudio Stages: Guestward Ho!\n\nMiami Undercover\n\nThe Untouchables (stages 2, 3, 4 and 16)\n\nThe Real McCoys (stage 14)\n\nMission: Impossible\n\nBatman (2, 3 & 16)\n\nStar Trek (first two pilots used sound stages 14, 15 and 16)\n\n\"40 Acres\" Back Lot: The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (occasional use)\n\nThe Adventures of Jim Bowie\n\nU.S. Marshal\n\nYancy Derringer\n\nThe Texan\n\nMan With A Camera\n\nWindow on Main Street\n\nHarrigan and Son\n\nThe Barbara Stanwyck Show\n\nThe Andy Griffith Show (\"Mayberry\")\n\nThe Untouchables\n\nThe Real McCoys (McCoy farm set)\n\nGomer Pyle, USMC (quonset huts)\n\nHogan's Heroes (\"Stalag 13\")\n\nAdventures of Superman (1951-52) (syndicated series)\n\nThe Green Hornet\n\nMission: Impossible (first season used backlot)\n\nI Spy (at least one episode)\n\nBatman (occasional exteriors on backlot)\n\nStar Trek (occasional backlot use in first season)\n\nBonanza (a few episodes)\n\nLand of the Giants (one episode)\n\nMayberry R.F.D.

Times\n\nlast major film studio still headquartered in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles\n\n\"The first silent stage built on what is today the Paramount lot is Stage 1. Then came Stage 2. Stage 3 was converted into wardrobe. So when they later built the small 'test' stage they named it Stage 3. Then came Stage 4 and what is today Stage 17. I guess when it was Brunton is was called Stage 5. All the silent stages were to the right. I believe the next silent stages constructed were 8 and 9. Stage 10 and the adjacent stage that became the scoring stage were built as silent stages. The first built-from-the-ground-up sound stages were 11, 12, 13 & 14. Then came 15 which was a tin stage built over 'A' tank. It was later soundproofed. Stages 16 and 18 were the last two sound stages built on the lot.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"Stage 7 was built around 1929. It was built as their 'theater' stage where part of it was much higher to handle the various curtains and scenery that could be lifted up just like in a real theater. MGM had a similar stage as did UA (Goldwyn) in Hollywood. Warner Brothers had one on the Prospect lot. They called it the Vitaphone theater stage.\" - Richard P.\n\nregarding the famous \"Bronson Gate,\" Paramount's original main entrance : \"Ah yes, the scene [in \"Sunset Boulevard\"] where the guard challenges \"Max\" when he wants to drive Miss Desmond onto the lot to see Mr. DeMille, who is shooting on stage 18.... that would be the Bronson Avenue gate...I love that scene. \"Jones, remind your friend that without me ther would be no Paramount Studios.\" Ah, the golden days.....\" - Daniel R.\n\n\"A lot of changes were made to stage 18 after they filmed SUNSET BLVD. on it. At one point they uncovered the basement so that they could attain greater height for filming the huge courtyard set in REAR WINDOW. The stage door we see DeMille come out of is no longer at that spot. It was moved when Paramount added a freight elevator outside the stage.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"Paramount had five stages that interconnected. They were 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. The first three made up the fist purposeful built sound stages on the lot. In fact, right after construction was finished they burned to the ground. Paramount quickly rebuilt them. All four stages had sound monitor booths on a second story where the sound mixer could look down onto the stage. Later, stages 12 and 14 were combined. After Stage 15 was built over what had been 'A' tank on the lot, Paramount installed doors that could be opened so all four stages made up a single huge stage. DeMille filmed some of the largest sets for THE TEN COMMANDMENTS on those combined stages. SAMSON and DELILAH used 14 and 15 combined for the huge temple set. And ELEPHANT WALK was filmed on combined 14 and 15.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"Bonanza worked many scenes [on mock exterior sets] at Paramount, where the Ponderosa stood proud on a rather narrow stage.\" - Randall R.\n\n\"The Paramount [backlot exterior] western street was constructed long before BONANZA. I believe original sections of it first went up for the Alan Ladd western, WHISPERING SMITH in 1948. It was added onto over the years. The western street was used for GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL (1957) as well as LAST TRAIN FROM GUN HILL (1959). For that feature, Paramount installed about a quarter mile of train track so they could film a Baldwin steam engine No. 22 pulling several vintage coaches through the western street...The Paramount western street was used for ONE EYED JACKS (released in 1961 - filmed starting in 1959). In fact, for that film, the sky drop for 'B' Tank was used to extend the horizon.... In 1979, the entire western street sets were demolished to make way for a large studio parking lot.\" - Richard P.\n\nregarding the above-mentioned locomotive: \"Paramount owned the engine and cars. They purchased No. 22 back in 1937. Paramount also owned No. 18, another Virginia & Truckee steam locomotive. Both engines were sold to the State of Nevada in 1974.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"The mountain [backdrop] was over on the west end right up next to what had been RKO and later Desilu. It was not by the tank. In some photos taken I see building constructed over the tank, but in others, the tank is open such as it was in the Above Los Angeles aerial taken in 1976. In 1980 after the western street was removed, the tank was in use.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"'B' Tank went up back in the 1940s...It's called 'B' tank because 'A' tank was where stage 15 stands. Originally 'A' tank was an open outdoor tank. Then it was covered over with a huge tin shed structure that was not soundproofed. Soon after, the stage was soundproofed. It connects with adjacent stage 14 which was originally two stages, the first of four originally built for sound on the lot. Later on, the wall seperating the two stages was torn down. Right after stages 11, 12, 13 and 14 were finished, they burned to the ground forcing Paramount to film their first sound movie at night on their silent stages as well as in the cramped silent 'test stage' which was once used by Roy Pomeroy to split the Red Sea for DeMille's original silent version of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. When 'B' tank isn't being used, Paramount uses it as a parking lot.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"[In THE TEN COMMANDMENTS], The parting of the Red Sea was accomplished by filming water in 'B' tank using a special dump systems. The footage was combined optically with shots of actors walking through the empty sea floor. Those shots could have been filmed inside combined 14 and 15. Not sure.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"New York street was built very early on possibly when the studio was the Brunton Studio. Early photos I've seen of the lot show a lot of exteriors sets. Over the years, buildings went up around where the New York street was located. Then in 1983 a huge fire completely destroyed it. The current New York Street built in the exact same area is a state-of-the-art exterior set.\" - Richard P.\n\nlot grew over years and eventually absorbed old RKO Hollywood lot (see Desilu-Gower)\n\n\"The small European village [used in Star Trek and Hogan's Heroes] was right behind the Nickodell Restaurant and catty-cornered to the KHJ broadcast building on Melrose. The restaurant was leveled to make way for more parking on the Paramount lot. Also removed [in 1979] were the European village and the western street used in BONANZA.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"At Paramount, according to their website, stages 4, 8, 16 and 24 have pits. Stage 24 used to be Stage 2 when it was Desilu and before that RKO. [Stage 3] was used for audience sitcoms. Still is.\" - Richard P.\n\n\"Here's Lucy was shot on stage 25 (Lucy's dressing room was/is attached). This is the same stage where The Lucy Show, Cheers, Bosom Buddies, and Frasier were shot. Here's Lucy only shot their first 2 seasons at Paramount. They then moved to Universal. It became too difficult for Lucy to continue shooting at her old studio.\" - William F., Jr.\n\nToday: \"There is such a mix of old and new - the 'public' area by the company store / snackbar is a nice area to relax and unwind, then you have the original writer's buildings still there inside the Bronson Gate (both, of course, seen in Sunset Blvd)- then there is the famous gate itself. They have bought the land in front of it, closed off the street immediately in front of the gate and made a lovely courtyard with trees and a fountain. Then into the future with a new and state of the art 'screening room' theatre.\" - Larry W.\n\n\"RKO/Desilu was the entire western 1/4 of the lot. The lot was originally 2 studios, with a massive backlot between them. Eventually Paramount replaced the backlot with stages and office buildings. The oldest part of the former Desilu lot is the buildings at Lucy Park. It originally had arches but they were demolished due to structural problems. Too bad they did not rebuild them since they are what made the building stand out in the TV shows that shot there.\" - William F., Jr.\n\n\"Paramount never built stages on what was the RKO and later Desilu lot. All they did was knock down the wall that separated Paramount from what had been Desilu. All the sound stages on the Gower Street side were built by RKO. The very last stages to be constructed went up sometime in the late 1930s. They are the stages that run along Melrose Ave. The corner stage on Melrose and Gower used to have an antenna mounted above the globe on the roof. Those stages were built as 11, 12 & 14. They're renumbered as 19, 20 & 21. Paramount hasn't built a soundstage since Stage 18 went up which was eons ago. They did lose Stage 10 when the Bing Crosby Building was demolished a couple of years ago. Also gone was the scoring stage.

The street was constructed during the Spring and early Summer of 1964 and saw action in this episode in the first week of August...As backlot shooting fell out of favor, the streets which were located here were torn down. They survived into the 80's.\" - Chris S.\n\n\"Samuel Goldwyn suffered a number of fires that destroyed a number of it's stages. Some were never rebuilt and the land they sat on was eventually sold (like the backlot property)\" - William F., Jr.\n\n\"The first of the two worst fires at Goldwyn occurred right before filming of PORGY AND BESS was to commence. It burned down enormous Stage 8, then the largest stage on the lot. Goldwyn built two smaller stages on that site. The second fire took out all the stages behind the offices that front Santa Monica Blvd. This occurred in May of 1974. The fire started on stage 5 where the TV series SIGMUND AND THE SEA MONSTER was being taped. It quickly spread to adjoining stages. Destroyed were stages 1 through 5. Later, four new stages were built. The only original stages left on that lot from the 'golden days' are 6 and 7. Many years ago Stage 6 was subdivided, turning its interior into dubbing, ADR and Foley stages. Stage 7, the former Goldwyn scoring stage where GONE WITH THE WIND was scored is now a shooting stage. It was dismantled as a scoring stage shortly after the fire took out five stages in 1974. Stages 5 & 6 were once stages 8 & 9, built right after stage 8 burned to the ground. They went up around late 1959. [Steve McQueen] was on the lot in 1974 when the stages caught fire and helped fireman put it out.
