        "text": "The Cosby Show, American television situation comedy that ranked as the most popular family comedy (i.e., about family issues and aimed at a family audience) of the 1980s. As the keystone of Thursday-night television for eight seasons (1984–92) on NBC, the show was credited with reviving the sitcom genre and raising the network’s ratings.\n\nInspired by a Bill Cosby stand-up comedy segment about child rearing, NBC producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner created an instant hit with this domestic comedy series. The show was filmed in front of a studio audience and focused on the daily happenings and familial interactions of the upper-middle-class Huxtable family in their brownstone home in Brooklyn, New York. Cosby starred as obstetrician and paterfamilias Cliff, whose wife, Clair (played by Phylicia Rashad), balances an equally successful legal career. Together they counsel, admonish, and frequently outmaneuver their five children, who, early in the show, were 20-something Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf), teenagers Denise (Lisa Bonet) and Theo (Malcolm-Jamal Warner), preteen Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe), and young Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam). Grandparents Anna and Russell Huxtable (Clarice Taylor and Earle Hyman) frequently appeared, and the irresistible Olivia (Raven-Symoné, who later starred in the Disney Channel’s That’s So Raven, 2003–07) was eventually introduced as Cliff and Clair’s five-year-old step-grandchild.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nThe show’s most revered yet hotly debated aspect was its attempt to combat stereotypes about African American families. Because of the Huxtables’ high-income professions, strong nuclear family, and mixed-racial peer group, TV Guide deemed them “the most atypical Black family in television history.” But The Cosby Show not only reinvented the African American television family (frequently featuring prominent Black artists, jazz musicians, and actors in the process). It also established a successful formula for family-centred comedy in general. Moreover, Cosby was one of the first stand-up comedians to become a sitcom star.\n\nThe Cosby Show was one of only two American shows to top the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive seasons. It received the People’s Choice Award for favourite comedy program every year of its run except 1991 as well as three Golden Globes, 6 of the 29 Emmy Awards for which it was nominated, and more than 40 other awards. It produced a spin-off program, A Different World (1987–93), set at a historically Black college and initially focusing on Bonet’s Denise character."
