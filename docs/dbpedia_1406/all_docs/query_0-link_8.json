The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\n\n- Viewership: 14.6 million\n\n- Rating: 9.2%\n\n- Share: 22%\n\n- Date: Feb. 6, 2014\n\nAfter 22 years on the air, comedian Jay Leno signed off from \"The Tonight Show\" in 2014 with a star-studded finale featuring President Barack Obama and a return visit from his first guest, Billy Crystal. It was the second time Leno had said goodbye after Conan O'Brien's brief stint in 2009. Much of the show's celebrity guests and festivities were kept secret from Leno until the show aired.\n\nThe show was nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series category 10 times between 1993 and 2005, winning the award in 1995. The famed 1992 finale of his predecessor, Johnny Carson, also appears on this list.\n\n#51. Dynasty\n\n- Viewership: 14.7 million\n\n- Rating: 10.8%\n\n- Share: 17%\n\n- Date: May 11, 1989\n\n\"Dynasty\" was the iconic guilty pleasure primetime soap opera of the 1980s that revolved around the wealthy Carrington family. Oil baron Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) had fallen in love with his secretary Krystle (Linda Evans), causing all kinds of great TV drama when Blake's infamous ex-wife, Alexis (Joan Collins), shows up.\n\nThe opulent soap opera was in the Nielsen top 10 for most of its nine-year run, reaching #1 in 1984, but ultimately sliding in popularity by the time the network canceled it in 1989. \"Dynasty\" was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Drama series every year from 1981 to 1986, winning in 1984. The series earned 24 Emmy Award nominations, winning Outstanding Costumes for a Series in 1984. It also inspired a CW reboot in 2017.\n\n#50. Kate & Allie\n\n- Viewership: 14.9 million\n\n- Rating: 11.9%\n\n- Share: 20%\n\n- Date: May 22, 1989\n\nIn the hit 1980s sitcom \"Kate & Allie,\" best friends and fellow divorcees Kate McArdle (Susan Saint James) and Allie Lowell (Jane Curtin) move in together in New York City.\n\nInitially greenlit for six episodes as a midseason replacement in 1985, the female-driven series was quickly picked up for five more seasons, earning an Emmy Award for Curtin and a nomination for Saint James, along with Golden Globes nominations for the series. The finale, aired in May 1989, drew nearly 15 million viewers.\n\n#49. In the Heat of the Night\n\n- Viewership: 15.0 million\n\n- Rating: 10.9%\n\n- Share: 17%\n\n- Date: May 16, 1995\n\nTV legend Carroll O'Connor starred in the tension-filled dramatic TV series \"In the Heat of the Night\" (based on the Oscar-winning 1967 film and 1965 novel of the same name) as Chief Bill Gillespie, a small-town police chief in the American South, who later becomes sheriff of the county. As he tries to solve crimes and catch criminals with detective Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins), Gillespie must navigate tricky small-town politics where racial tensions run high.\n\nO'Connor, reportedly disappointed with the writing, would often rewrite his scripts to the chagrin of the production staff. The series ran from 1988 to 1995, sometimes competing with \"Golden Girls\" and \"Major Dad\" in ratings.\n\n#48. Married... with Children\n\n- Viewership: 15.2 million\n\n- Rating: 10.0%\n\n- Share: 16%\n\n- Date: May 5, 1997\n\nThe classic dysfunctional family sitcom \"Married...with Children\" premiered on the then-newly launched Fox network in 1987 to rave reviews. Starring Ed O'Neill as the hapless family patriarch, Al Bundy, Katey Sagal as gold-digger Peggy, a young Christina Applegate as dim-witted Kelly, and David Faustino as intelligent, but awkward Bud, the series was originally titled \"Not the Cosbys.\"\n\nAfter a viewer-led advertiser boycott in 1989, the series increased in ratings as more people became curious about the show's controversial storylines. O'Neill, who now stars on the hit show \"Modern Family,\" has been said to have made telephone calls to fans in character during the show's heyday, but only on the condition they call him collect, in line with Al Bundy's cheapskate nature.\n\n#47. Perfect Strangers\n\n- Viewership: 15.8 million\n\n- Rating: 11.8%\n\n- Share: 16%\n\n- Date: Aug. 6, 1993\n\nCreated by the producers of \"Laverne & Shirley\" and \"Mork & Mindy,\" buddy comedy \"Perfect Strangers\" starred Bronson Pinchot as naive Balki Bartokomous, a sheepherder from Greece who travels to the U.S. to find his cousin, the high-strung Larry Appleton (Mark Linn-Baker). The pair end up sharing Larry's apartment despite their differences, often getting into situations in which only the well-meaning but aloof Balki can get them out.\n\nThe series ran from 1986 to 1993, anchoring the newly created ABC \"TGIF\" lineup and inspiring the popular spinoff \"Family Matters.\"\n\n#46. NYPD Blue\n\n- Viewership: 16.1 million\n\n- Rating: 10.4%\n\n- Share: 17%\n\n- Date: March 1, 2005\n\nThe critically acclaimed, gritty police procedural drama \"NYPD Blue\" was nominated for an Emmy Award 84 times and won 20. The series, which debuted in 1993, aired its final episode in March 2005, making it the longest-running primetime one-hour drama series on ABC until \"Grey's Anatomy\" surpassed it in 2016.\n\nThe original ensemble cast included David Caruso, Dennis Franz, and James McDaniel, who played detectives at the 15th Police Precinct in Manhattan. Before \"NYPD Blue,\" some of the stars had an affiliation with co-creator Steven Bochco from his previous highly acclaimed series, \"Hill Street Blues.\"\n\n#45. Miami Vice\n\n- Viewership: 16.1 million\n\n- Rating: 11.0%\n\n- Share: 21%\n\n- Date: June 28, 1989\n\nNoted for its colorful men's fashion and innovative use of popular music at the time—including jazzy, synthesizer tunes from composer Jan Hammer—the groundbreaking police drama \"Miami Vice\" focused on the Miami Police Department's vice squad as it worked to end prostitution and drug trafficking.\n\nThe series ran for five seasons from 1984 to 1990, greatly influencing popular culture, music, and fashion. The partnership of Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs led to Outstanding Actor awards for both stars of the show, Don Johnson and Edward James Olmos, and inspired a film of the same name starring Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell in 2006.\n\n#44. ER\n\n- Viewership: 16.4 million\n\n- Rating: 10.4%\n\n- Share: 17%\n\n- Date: April 2, 2009\n\n\"ER\" aired from 1994 until 2009: It was the longest-running primetime medical drama in U.S. television history until it \"Grey's Anatomy\" surpassed it in 2019. Created by novelist and medical doctor Michael Crichton (\"Jurassic Park\"), the series followed the lives of the doctors and staff at the fictional County General Hospital in Chicago.\n\nCrichton based the screenplay—written in 1974 but put on hold while collaborating with Steven Spielberg on \"Jurassic Park\"—on his experiences as a resident physician in a busy hospital emergency room. The series was nominated for 375 industry awards and won 116, including a Peabody Award and several Emmy Awards. The series also launched or amplified the TV and film careers of stars such as Noah Wyle, George Clooney, Julianna Margulies, Parminder Nagra, Mekhi Phifer, and Maura Tierney, among others.\n\n#43. The Oprah Winfrey Show\n\n- Viewership: 16.4 million\n\n- Rating: 11.5%\n\n- Share: N/A\n\n- Date: May 25, 2011\n\nAfter 25 years on the air, the history-making \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" signed off with a farewell by its namesake to her audience in 150 countries: \"You and this show have been the greatest love of my life.\"\n\nThe two-part finale by the media icon featured appearances by Aretha Franklin, Tom Cruise, Stevie Wonder, Beyoncé, Tom Hanks, and Madonna, bringing in the highest ratings for the program in 17 years. \"Oprah\" remains the highest-rated daytime talk show in American television history, leading the way for spinoffs like \"Dr. Phil\" and \"Dr. Oz.\"\n\nYou may also like: Most popular TV shows on Max this week\n\n#42. Murder, She Wrote\n\n- Viewership: 16.5 million\n\n- Rating: 12.3%\n\n- Share: 21%\n\n- Date: May 19, 1996\n\nFor 12 seasons, Angela Lansbury was a mystery writer and detective Jessica Fletcher on the highly successful crime drama series \"Murder, She Wrote.\" A staple in the Sunday night lineup for CBS, the show garnered 26 million viewers per week until the network moved it to a new time slot for its last two seasons.\n\nFollowing the finale in 1996, the series inspired four TV movies, a video game, and a spinoff book series. Lansbury holds the record for having the most Golden Globe and Emmy nominations and wins for an actress in a television drama series.\n\n#41. Roseanne\n\n- Viewership: 16.6 million\n\n- Rating: 11.6%\n\n- Share: 19%\n\n- Date: May 20, 1997\n\nThe popular 1990s sitcom \"Roseanne\" was named for its star, comedian Roseanne Barr, who had been seen on \"The Tonight Show\" by show co-creators Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner (\"The Cosby Show\"). Popular from the start, the show was one of the first to focus on a blue-collar American family with two parents (Barr and John Goodman) working outside the home. Barr and Laurie Metcalf (\"Lady Bird\"), who played her sister on the show, both won Emmy Awards for their performances. The series took home a Golden Globe, as did Goodman.\n\nA 2018 reboot of the series with the original cast premiered with a whopping 18.2 million viewers but ended in controversy after two months when a racist Twitter comment by Barr prompted ABC to nix the show. However, ABC then spun off the reboot to a Barr-free series called \"The Conners,\" which is in its fifth season and counting.\n\n#40. Beverly Hills, 90210\n\n- Viewership: 16.8 million\n\n- Rating: 11.9%\n\n- Share: 21%\n\n- Date: May 17, 2000\n\nFor teens in the 1990s, \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" was the must-see guilty pleasure primetime drama of the era. Produced by the prolific TV writer-producer Aaron Spelling (known for \"Charlie's Angels\" and \"Dynasty\"), the series ran for 10 seasons—his longest-running—and spawned the spinoffs \"Melrose Place\" and \"Models Inc.\"\n\nThe soapy series focused on the trials and tribulations of high school friends in the upscale community of Beverly Hills. It starred Shannen Doherty, Jason Priestley, Luke Perry, Jennie Garth, Brian Austin Green, and Tori Spelling.\n\n#39. Murphy Brown\n\n- Viewership: 17.5 million\n\n- Rating: 12.3%\n\n- Share: 19%\n\n- Date: May 18, 1998\n\n\"Murphy Brown\" was a hugely popular workplace comedy about a Washington-based TV news reporter played by Candice Bergen. The series ran for 10 seasons and won 18 Emmy Awards, including five wins for Bergen, a record for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series. The fact that Bergen's title character—a 40-something working woman—decided to have a baby on her own in the middle of the series sparked a controversy with conservatives at the time but boosted the show's ratings.\n\nIn the final season in 1998, Murphy Brown's battle with breast cancer led to a 30% increase in women getting mammograms that year. In the finale, Brown meets God for an interview while under anesthesia.\n\n#38. Major Dad\n\n- Viewership: 17.9 million\n\n- Rating: 12.6%\n\n- Share: 20%\n\n- Date: April 16, 1993\n\n\"Major Dad\" ran from 1989 to 1993. It featured conservative Marine Major John \"Mac\" MacGillis (Gerald McRaney) and pacifist reporter Polly Cooper (Shanna Reed), who fall for each other in an unlikely romance. At home, MacGillis becomes dad to Cooper's three daughters. The popular family show received nominations for several awards, but the network canceled it in 1993 after four seasons.\n\nYou may also like: Iconic quotes from '60s TV shows\n\n#37. Jake and the Fatman\n\n- Viewership: 18.1 million\n\n- Rating: 12.9%\n\n- Share: 20%\n\n- Date: May 6, 1992\n\nDistrict Attorney J.L. \"Fatman\" McCabe (William Conrad) worked to solve cases with his laid-back investigator Jake Styles (Joe Penny) for five seasons on \"Jake and the Fatman,\" a crime drama that spawned the spinoff \"Diagnosis: Murder.\" Jake is framed for murder in the series finale in 1992.\n\n#36. The Facts of Life\n\n- Viewership: 18.2 million\n\n- Rating: 13.2%\n\n- Share: 29%\n\n- Date: May 7, 1988\n\nIn one of the longest-running sitcoms of the 1980s, \"The Facts of Life\" (a spinoff of \"Diff'rent Strokes\") focused on Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae), a housemother at a private all-girls boarding school and the girls who attend. The series enjoyed its highest ratings, particularly with teens, in season three. By season seven (when George Clooney became a regular cast member), the show helped to bolster the new series \"The Golden Girls.\"\n\nThe two-part series finale of \"The Facts of Life\" showed the school becoming co-ed, with new students Mayim Bialik (\"The Big Bang Theory\") and Seth Green appearing as guest stars.\n\n#35. The Big Bang Theory\n\n- Viewership: 18.5 million\n\n- Rating: 12.2%\n\n- Share: 22%\n\n- Date: May 16, 2019\n\nWhen you're the longest-running multicamera comedy in TV history, there's a lot of pressure to give fans a satisfying finale—and \"The Big Bang Theory\" managed to do just that. The second half of the two-episode finale is the highest-rated episode of all 12 seasons, according to IMDb, with 9.5 out of 10 stars.\n\nThe episode tugged at viewers' heartstrings from the start: with a montage of clips from the show's 12-season run. Then, it turned its attention to none other than Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons), of course. After he and Amy (Mayim Bialik) win the Nobel Prize in Physics, they both struggle with the media attention that comes with it. Penny (Kaley Cuoco) eventually convinces Sheldon to accept change in a very special way: by riding the elevator that's finally been fixed after 16 years, giving closure to the show's longest-running joke.\n\nThe second part of the season finale sees Amy, Sheldon, Penny, Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Howard (Simon Helberg), Bernadette (Melissa Rauch), and Raj (Kunal Nayyar) flying to Sweden for the Nobel Prize award ceremony. After a series of events in which Sheldon disappoints his friends and regresses socially, he gets a stern talking-to from Amy. Then, on the fly, he decides to discard the acceptance speech he wrote as a child and instead acknowledges Amy and his friends.\n\nIn the series' final moments, the gang shares one last meal in Apartment 4A as an acoustic version of \"The Big Bang Theory\" theme song plays.\n\n#34. Will & Grace\n\n- Viewership: 18.6 million\n\n- Rating: 12.9%\n\n- Share: 20%\n\n- Date: May 18, 2006\n\nThe beloved \"Will & Grace\" was revived in 2017 at NBC to critical acclaim, after its original series finale left fans largely dissatisfied and wanting more.\n\nThe ninth season's premiere episode brought in 10.2 million viewers and shows Will Truman (Eric McCormack) and Grace Adler (Debra Messing) fast-forwarded 11 years into the future to reveal what happened after their falling out. Friends of the former TV roommates and fan favorites Karen (Megan Mullally) and Jack (Sean Hayes) have largely remained unchanged. The beloved show earned 16 Emmy Awards and ran for eight seasons in its original run.\n\n#33. Matlock\n\n- Viewership: 18.7 million\n\n- Rating: 13.2%\n\n- Share: 20%\n\n- Date: May 7, 1995\n\n\"Matlock\" starred TV legend Andy Griffith in the title role as criminal defense attorney Ben Matlock. Full of folksy charm, the gray-suit-clad, hot-dog-eating Matlock was known for finding overlooked evidence to discover the real murderer and exonerate his wrongly accused client in a dramatic showdown in court. The series ran for six seasons, was briefly canceled in 1992, then quickly picked up again for three more until its series finale in 1995.\n\n#32. Designing Women\n\n- Viewership: 18.8 million\n\n- Rating: 14.2%\n\n- Share: 22%\n\n- Date: May 24, 1993\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning series \"Designing Women\" was once saved from cancellation by fans who wrote an estimated 50,000 letters in support of the show. The much-lauded sitcom, created by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, focused on four smart, feisty women (Dixie Carter, Delta Burke, Jean Smart, and Annie Potts) who work together in an interior design firm in Atlanta. In the unique series finale in 1993, each of the women imagines themselves as Scarlett O'Hara from \"Gone with the Wind.\"\n\n#30. Bonanza\n\n- Viewership: 19.3 million\n\n- Rating: N/A\n\n- Share: N/A\n\n- Date: Jan. 16, 1973\n\nFrom 1959 to 1973, \"Bonanza\" became a fixture in American life. The classic Western—the second-longest-running in TV history (behind \"Gunsmoke\")—was about the adventures of Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene) and his sons (Pernell Roberts, Dan Blocker, Michael Landon) living on the Ponderosa in Nevada. Author Mark Twain would have been the Cartwrights' neighbor in the 1860s while he worked at the local newspaper, the Territorial Enterprise.\n\nAfter enjoying #1 ratings from 1964 to 1967, the show was suddenly canceled in November 1972 (after the death of Blocker). It led to a finale in January 1973 that Greene said \"went out with a whimper\" rather than a bang since there was little notice for the cast and crew.\n\n#30. Game of Thrones\n\n- Viewership: 19.3 million\n\n- Rating: N/A\n\n- Share: N/A\n\n- Date: May 19, 2019\n\nThe last episode of \"Game of Thrones\" may not have been a satisfying series finale, but it was certainly a highly watched one. It's a unique entry among the top 50 in that the viewership numbers include streaming: The initial airing drew 13.6 million viewers, but replays on streaming brought that number to 19.3 million. But it's an understatement to say that it disappointed: The series finale, titled \"The Iron Throne,\" only has a four-star rating on IMDb, the lowest of any in the series' eight-year run.\n\nOf course, there was a lot riding on the ending of \"Game of Thrones\": Why did Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) suddenly descend into madness and murder thousands of people? Will Arya (Maisie Williams) seek revenge? Can Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) truly see the future?\n\nUltimately, the last episode left fans with more questions than answers—perhaps that was by design with the many \"Game of Thrones\" spinoffs to come. One 2022 Collider article called the \"Game of Thrones\" series finale \"still inexcusable\"; an immediate response to the 2019 episode from Vox said it \"betrayed the show's core themes\"; and even Maisie Williams said she rewatched the series in 2022 and admitted, \"It definitely fell off at the end.\"\n\n#29. Knots Landing\n\n- Viewership: 19.6 million\n\n- Rating: 13.9%\n\n- Share: 22%\n\n- Date: May 13, 1993\n\n\"Knots Landing,\" a spinoff of the popular primetime '80s soap \"Dallas,\" became one of the longest-running primetime dramas after \"Gunsmoke\" and \"Bonanza.\" Stars of the ensemble cast included Ted Shackelford as Gary Ewing, along with Alec Baldwin, Nicollette Sheridan, Kim Lankford, James Houghton, and Joan Van Ark, who all live in an exclusive cul-de-sac in Southern California where manipulation, drama, and romance are always front and center. After 14 seasons on the air, the series signed off in 1993.\n\n#28. Mad About You\n\n- Viewership: 19.8 million\n\n- Rating: 13.6%\n\n- Share: 20%\n\n- Date: May 24, 1999\n\nPaul Reiser and Helen Hunt starred in \"Mad About You,\" a beloved, sometimes-underrated sitcom about a newly married couple living in New York City. The series ran from 1992 to 1999, when it slipped in ratings. The finale was a flash forward about 22 years in the future, showing the couple's baby daughter all grown up and explaining what happened to her parents through comedic skits.\n\nHunt's role almost went to Teri Hatcher (\"Desperate Housewives\"), but it was Hunt and Reiser's chemistry that made the show work. Two decades later, the show returned for a limited run on Spectrum's On Demand platform. In the reboot, the Buchmans say goodbye to Mabel as she heads off to college a few blocks away. The reboot's season premiere was written by Reiser and directed by Hunt.\n\nYou may also like: Best 'Star Trek' episodes\n\n#27. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n\n- Viewership: 19.9 million\n\n- Rating: 13.1%\n\n- Share: 22%\n\n- Date: May 20, 1996\n\nThe viewers saved the 1990s favorite sitcom \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" from getting canceled after season four, bringing it back for two more seasons before the network canceled it for good in 1996. The series, which catapulted Will Smith into fame, showed the upper-class, quirky Banks family living, laughing, dancing, and loving as they take in their street-smart cousin Will, who hails from Philadelphia.\n\nThe heartbreaking series finale was a real goodbye—as Will is left alone in the empty house to reflect on all the memories as the family prepares to move away. Fun fact: the cab driver in the iconic opening credits was executive producer Quincy Jones. The series reboot, now called \"Bel-Air,\" was reimagined with more dramatic flair in 2022. Peacock ordered two seasons based on the popularity of a fan-made trailer by Morgan Cooper and the resulting pitch to studio execs.\n\n#26. Who's the Boss?\n\n- Viewership: 20.5 million\n\n- Rating: 12.7%\n\n- Share: 24%\n\n- Date: April 25, 1992\n\nOne of the most popular sitcoms of the 1980s was \"Who's the Boss?\" starring Tony Danza as Tony Micelli, a former baseball player forced to retire due to a shoulder injury. Alyssa Milano played Danza's daughter Samantha, while Judith Light co-starred as Angela Bower, an advertising executive with whom they live as Micelli works as her live-in housekeeper. Frank Sinatra made a guest appearance on the show in 1989.\n\nIts one-hour series finale aired in April 1992, along with the series finales of \"Growing Pains\" and \"MacGyver.\"\n\n#25. Quantum Leap\n\n- Viewership: 20.6 million\n\n- Rating: 13.7%\n\n- Share: 23%\n\n- Date: May 5, 1993\n\nIn the early '90s cult favorite sci-fi series \"Quantum Leap,\" physicist Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) finds himself trapped in time. He temporarily takes the place of other people to correct historical events. In the 1993 series finale, Beckett leaps through space-time back to his own birth to learn that he is in charge of his destinations and is doing them to \"make the world a better place,\" choosing never to return home.\n\nThe series was nominated for and won a number of awards, particularly for its cinematography and editing. A 2022 revival features Raymond Lee as Dr. Ben Song, who follows in Sam's footsteps hoping to solve the mystery of his whereabouts.\n\n#24. The Wonder Years\n\n- Viewership: 21.0 million\n\n- Rating: 13.9%\n\n- Share: 23%\n\n- Date: May 12, 1993\n\nInspired by \"A Christmas Story,\" and one of the most popular shows of the 1980s, \"The Wonder Years\" was a coming-of-age show in which Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) recalls through voice-over and flashbacks what it was like growing up during the radical 1960s and '70s. Daniel Stern, Dan Lauria, Danica McKellar, and Alley Mills rounded out the ensemble. Savage, who at the time was a big star from the film, \"A Princess Bride,\" became the youngest actor to be nominated for an Emmy Award as a Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, helping the series win for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1988.\n\nFans were disappointed when the network canceled the series after six seasons and when the finale didn't show Kevin and Winnie (McKellar) ending up together as a couple. A 2021 remake now follows a Black family in 1968 Montgomery, Alabama.\n\n#23. The Mary Tyler Moore Show\n\n- Viewership: 21.2 million\n\n- Rating: 16.5%\n\n- Share: 28%\n\n- Date: March 19, 1977\n\nIn one of the most famous and unforgettable sign-offs in television history, Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) turned off the lights on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" in 1977 after seven seasons. The episode won an Emmy Award and inspired numerous other series finales as \"the gold standard.\" Moore starred as the perky, intelligent, and independent news producer who befriends coworkers (Ed Asner, Betty White) and neighbors (Valerie Harper, Cloris Leachman).\n\nA groundbreaking and critically acclaimed series for its writing and treatment of controversial issues of the day, \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" held the record for the most Emmy Awards with 29 until \"Frasier\" broke that record in 2002.\n\n#22.

Macy.\n\nThe series earned 15 Emmy Awards and gave then-former lawyer David E. Kelley (\"Big Little Lies\") his start in writing and producing television.

The series ran for six years as the lead-in to ABC's \"Monday Night Football,\" though its seventh season was shortened when it disappeared for four months from the schedule, followed by a finale and a previously unaired episode in May 1992.\n\nAnderson told TV Guide, \"the only reason it went off the air was that everybody was ready to move on. I was physically exhausted and had no life.\"\n\n#19.
