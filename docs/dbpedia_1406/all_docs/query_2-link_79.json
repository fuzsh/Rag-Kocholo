        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Seven days of rioting on the streets of Britain has prompted one of the country’s top production companies to email staff to condemn the unrest and signpost welfare support.\n\nStudio Lambert, the production company behind The Traitors and Squid Game: The Challenge, described the disorder as “deeply affecting” in the memo to employees.\n\nViolence has broken out across the UK after the fatal stabbing of three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport last week.\n\nThe unrest was initially fuelled by social media misinformation that the suspected assailant, Cardiff-born Axel Rudakubana, was an asylum seeker.\n\nAnger has continued to be whipped up online, not least by X/Twitter owner Elon Musk, who has been critical of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and claimed that Britain is on the brink of civil war.\n\nSigned by founder Stephen Lambert and his top team, the Studio Lambert email said: “I would like to address the deeply affecting events taking place across the UK in recent days.\n\n“The violence, vandalism and discrimination we have witnessed is shocking and a stark reminder of the continuing challenges we face in building an inclusive society.”\n\nStudio Lambert’s intervention is thought to be one of the first of its kind from a major player in the UK television industry amid reports that rioting will continue on Wednesday.\n\nThe All3Media-owned production company said it stood “against all forms of discrimination, racism and violence” and wants to create a working environment free from “violence or abuse from any people.”\n\nStudio Lambert reminded employees of its anti-harassment and bullying policy. The company also signposted “assistance” resources, including counseling.\n\n“If there is anything you need to feel safer, please let us know. If you would prefer to work from home and not travel this week, for example, please discuss with your line manager,” added the email, which was also signed by chief creative officer Tim Harcourt."
