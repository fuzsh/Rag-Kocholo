        "text": "Studio location at TV Tower at Trocadéro provides perfect real-world backdrop for next-gen visual effects\n\nIn May 2023, Channel Nine acquired the rights to Paris 2024 and to all Olympics through Brisbane 2032, giving its production team only 18 months to figure out a plan of attack. Today, the Australian over-the-air broadcaster has a team of 150 in Paris and 300 at home, delivering for viewers and innovating with an XR studio that makes its set in the Trocadéro TV tower seem much larger than it is.\n\n“It has been a short runway for us,” says Alex Rolls, head of creative and innovation, Channel Nine, “but we’re pleased with how it has come together.”\n\nPlanning for an Olympics typically takes years, especially for a major onsite presence. And a commitment to such a presence is very much part of the Channel Nine ethos.\n\n“We have a fundamental belief in a commitment to be onsite for all our major events,” says Rolls. “There’s a lot of broadcasters in the world who are pushing feeds downstream, but we have to be here.”\n\nThe decision to be onsite led to the next challenge: bringing Paris home to viewers in Australia. Brent Williams, director, sport, Channel Nine, met with the IOC and discussed the possibility of being located in the Trocadéro TV tower, with windows overlooking the Eiffel Tower.\n\n“It was the quickest decision we made, because we wanted that incredible view,” says Rolls. “We’re very thankful for that.”\n\nWith the location nailed down, Channel Nine turned to resolve a key production conundrum: how to give the 8-sq.-meter studio a scale that matches the massive (and long) event. That’s where relationships with other rightsholders came in handy.\n\n“I’ve been very interested in getting us into the extended-reality space,” says Rolls. “Brent, our CTO John Brandon, and I jumped on a plane and went to England to meet with an old mate of mine: John Murphy is creative director at the BBC and has been a pioneer in the space. We went up to Manchester and saw their virtual studios in action. By the time we were on the plane home to Australia, we were committed to it.”\n\nWith the decision to bring XR to the Games, the next question was whom to work with on ensuring that the virtual studio looked great, camera moves were smooth and realistic, and more. Channel Nine has been working with AE Live for a few years now, and its reputation for creating big, virtual-set extensions all around the world made it a natural fit.\n\n“I’m very proud of the partnership and what we’ve done with them, as well as with Jago Design, a company also based in London,” says Rolls. “Fundamentally, the look of the Games is very much done in-house with our own design team led by Reg Squires, and we’re delighted with how it has all come together.”\n\nSome interesting philosophical questions for anyone embracing the XR environment are what exactly are you trying to portray in the environment, what is the emotional response you want from viewers, and how can you ensure that the talent will be comfortable working in it? All big questions, and Rolls says that Channel Nine began with a few goals, including a vibe focused on the Games and a nod to Paris and its rich history in fashion and art.\n\n“We became very interested in 1950s Parisian posters and the classic style,” he explains. “We’ve replicated that and reimagined it so that combining it with our real studio gives us a nice balance between the nod to Paris’s history and the slickness that you can do with virtual-set extensions and being modern.”\n\nThe XR set also had to augment the storytelling that the presenters talk about. “It’s a cliché, but storytelling is a huge part of what we do at Nine,” says Rolls. “We invest a lot of money in it, a lot of time in it, and it was obviously a leap of faith for our presentation team to come here and be introduced to virtual studios and set extensions for the first time ever and at the biggest sporting event in the world.”\n\nThat meant walking through the whole XR environment and becoming confident it was going to work properly.\n\n“The feedback has been fantastic, and it has been amazing,” says Rolls. “At the moment, I don’t think we could be happier, really. This is the first time an Australian broadcaster has gone into this space with a virtual-set extension to this level. I’ll just finish by saying, as far as we are aware, it’s the longest distance that a remote production is traveling because all of our presentation team is here. But the key personnel and the engine hub are in Sydney, with the executive producers and the directors putting the show together [there]. That’s a challenge that our CTO John Brandon has had to wrestle with from day one.”\n\nRobotic cameras also are controlled from Australia, but latency has not been an issue. One thing that was an issue was getting the robotic arm from the ground up to the Channel Nine studio in the TV tower.\n\n“It was too heavy and couldn’t fit in the lift, so we had the hire a crane,” Rolls explains. “But having the robotic camera here gives us a consistency of movement within the studio because its motion is controlled [by the production team in Australia]. Having a camera do moves that are slick and look good and are polished has been a relief to the production team because it gives you certainty of output.”\n\nAnother challenge facing anyone taking a studio presenter team into the world of XR is to make sure the talent is comfortable. That was a two-step process: first, helping the talent see how XR is used by other well-known presenters around the world and they are comfortable with it and, second, making sure the studio facility had all the kinks ironed out by the time the talent arrived onsite.\n\n“We wanted them to walk into the studio and have everything work the way it was supposed to,” adds Rolls.\n\nSome virtual sets extend the set behind the talent or to the sides, but Channel Nine is using it to extend the set to the front of the talent, give them a new environment to move in, and a place to augment what they are discussing with player data, imagery, and medal tables.\n\n“We are augmenting the presentation by putting up information about the athletes or information about when the event is,” Rolls says. “We’re using countdown clocks a lot. They pop up in the virtual space, which allows the presenters to keep talking as they do. We are augmenting it by having a countdown clock to say that the next Australian superstar is on in 36 minutes so that viewers stay up. That’s our job: to get the Australian audience to stay awake through the night. From the viewing figures we are seeing, they are staying up.”\n\nChannel Nine has 160 personnel in Paris, including 30 commentators and 50 reporters working in 30 prebooked mixed-zone spaces. Meanwhile, back home, there are 300 working on the show as well as 20 off-tube commentators. The result is two free-to-air channels running 24 hours a day with curated and live coverage as well as the streaming of every sport through Stan Sport.\n\nAs for Channel Nine’s presence at venues, swimming is huge in Australia, so an onsite presence was very important last week. Now the attention turns to athletics.\n\n“We want our talent here,” says Rolls, “because they can go and speak to the athletes straight afterwards and bring that immediate reaction to viewers.”\n\nThe great news for Channel Nine is that, despite some tricky time-zone differences, viewers are tuning in. “We’ve gotten behind the Paris Games,” he adds, “and we can see Australia has gotten behind it, with the viewing figures that we’re getting. We’re exceeding expectations, and we’re delighted.”"
