        "text": "Apple’s latest installment in its “The Underdogs” ad series, titled “The Underdogs: OOO,” was recently pulled from circulation following significant backlash from viewers and the Thai government. The ad, which was a ten-minute comedy thriller set in Thailand, aimed to showcase the adventures of a group of colleagues trying to secure a business order.\n\nDepictions Under Fire\n\nThe ad faced immediate criticism for its portrayal of Thailand, with viewers and officials accusing Apple of depicting the country as backward and failing to capture its modern vibrancy. Social media platforms were abuzz with negative reactions, and prominent Thai politicians, including the head of the country’s tourism committee, Sattra Saipan, publicly condemned the ad. Saipan urged Thai citizens to boycott Apple products in response to the perceived insensitivity.\n\nApple’s Swift Response\n\nIn light of the backlash, Apple swiftly removed the video and issued a rare public apology. “Our intent was to celebrate the country’s optimism and culture,” Apple stated. “We apologize for not fully capturing the vibrancy of Thailand today.” Despite the controversy, the video remains available on some unofficial platforms.\n\nA Pattern of Missteps\n\nThis incident marks Apple’s third advertising blunder in less than a year. Earlier, the company faced backlash for its iPad Pro “Crush” ad, which was criticized by artists for being insensitive and potentially disturbing. The ad depicted various items being crushed to highlight the product’s features but was perceived as an allegory for technology stifling creativity. Additionally, Apple’s environmental efforts ad during the iPhone 15 event was deemed awkward and repetitive by viewers.\n\nDespite the missteps, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin offered a reconciliatory note, emphasizing the positive intentions behind Apple’s business endeavors in Thailand. As Apple navigates these challenges, it remains to be seen how the company will adjust its marketing strategies to better resonate with global audiences."
