        "text": "If all the world’s a stage, as Shakespeare wrote, then AD100 designer Pamela Shamshiri and her client Jana Bezdek have conjured the ultimate set piece, a sumptuous, seductive Greenwich Village brownstone reimagined to court the muse of theater—and of life. Brimming with dazzling decorative flourishes, the house feels like a corrective to the current vogue for hushed, monochromatic interiors that find luxury in abstention. It’s a place where extraordinary furnishings, alluring colors, and rapturous artworks coalesce in a domestic temple of beauty dedicated to the goddesses of magic, mystery, and creative invention.\n\n“I see the house as an extension of my life in the theater and my love for the performing arts,” says Bezdek, a cofounder of FourthWall Theatrical, a boutique production company that specializes in original musical theater and female-driven stories. Part pied-à-terre—Bezdek and her family are based in Los Angeles—and part workshop, the dwelling serves multiple functions as a place for read-throughs, cast meetings, and gatherings of every sort. In fact, the house was christened with a performance and fundraiser for FourthWall’s latest production, The Lonely Few, which The New York Times lauded as an “achingly romantic, softly sexy, genuinely rocking new musical.”\n\n“We wanted to tap into the history of the West Village as a crucible of bohemian culture, a place where people came to dream and create,” Bezdek says of the inspiration behind her happily eccentric, more-is-more decor. Shamshiri underscores the design’s homage to the avant-garde subculture that flourished in the Village in the early decades of the 20th century. “We looked at people like the Dada artist Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, who walked the streets of the Village with a birdcage on her head. Also Mina Loy, the pioneering poet and painter, and the arts patron Mabel Dodge Luhan. These were radical women who flouted convention and made their lives into art,” Shamshiri offers.\n\nThe designer’s free-spirited embrace of theatrical wonder manifests almost immediately upon entry into the parlor, which is wrapped in a mural by Dairo Vargas, a Colombian-born, London-based artist who infuses classical Renaissance and Baroque pastoral painting with a jolt of psychedelic abstraction. “The mural is a work of genius. It has such depth, color, and richness. I get lost in it,” Bezdek muses. The parlor’s heady mix of furnishings—encompassing signature pieces by Osvaldo Borsani, Mattia Bonetti, Piero Portaluppi, Paul Frankl, and Marc Du Plantier—likewise strikes a note of genre-bending, time-traveling originality, simultaneously traditional and unorthodox. In the garden-level conservatory, where Bezdek hosts her colleagues for meetings around a custom Martino Gamper table, a compelling mural by Italian artist Roberto Ruspoli pays tribute to the deities of theater in a composition that nods to the work of Jean Cocteau and Picasso.\n\nThe decorative drama takes a moody, mystical turn in the parlor lounge adjacent to the main parlor, which Bezdek has dubbed the séance room. Wrapped in paneling lacquered in a dark reddish-brown color, the space demonstrates the influence of Studio Shamshiri’s work at the Maison de la Luz hotel in New Orleans, another project steeped in witchy magic. Here, the atmosphere is buoyed by animal motifs, illuminated zodiac signs of gilded glass set within the millwork, towering moiré curtains, and an imposing Carlo Bugatti throne chair. “Jana wanted the lounge to be a dreamy, liminal space, full of possibilities and strange, metaphysical energy,” Shamshiri notes.\n\nIn contrast to the abstruse beauty of the séance room, the primary bedroom and bath, which the homeowner calls the goddess suite, are all lightness and elegance, a pale-hued sanctuary that casts a spell of serenity tinged with decadence. “It’s meant to be very soft and flattering, a super-feminine space that’s unabashedly indulgent,” Shamshiri says of the luxe accommodations. The home’s recurring zodiac motif appears once again as a plaster bas-relief on the ceiling of the lushly appointed bath lounge, which features a Maison Leleu upholstered daybed, a stunning Osvaldo Borsani bar cabinet, a Gio Ponti chandelier, and an ivory mohair rug. A provocative freestanding shower enclosure (think peekaboo box) and a custom super-glam mirrored vanity amplify the hedonistic vibe. “This is the most elevated bathroom I’ve ever seen, a real showstopper,” the homeowner avows.\n\nSurveying her domain, Bezdek repeatedly acknowledges her gratitude for her designer’s incisive eye and generous spirit: “This house is full of poetry and delight. Pam has an incredible ability to slip inside your skin and make you feel truly special. She’s a sorceress.” Shamshiri, for her part, returns the compliment: “You can’t make a house like this without an inspired client willing to take a wild ride. This was something Jana and I made together.”\n\nThis story appears in AD’s September issue. Never miss a story when you subscribe to AD."
