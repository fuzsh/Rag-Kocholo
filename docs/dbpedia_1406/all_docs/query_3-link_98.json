        "text": "Did you try to give the full path of the command that is running in the pre- or post-build event command?\n\nI was getting the 9009 error due to a xcopy post-build event command in Visual Studio 2008.\n\nThe command \"xcopy.exe /Y C:\\projectpath\\project.config C:\\compilepath\\\" exited with code 9009.\n\nBut in my case it was also intermittent. That is, the error message persists until a restart of the computer, and disappears after a restart of the computer. It is back after some remotely related issue I am yet to discover.\n\nHowever, in my case providing the command with its full path solved the issue:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\xcopy.exe /Y C:\\projectpath\\project.config C:\\compilepath\\\n\nInstead of just:\n\nxcopy.exe /Y C:\\projectpath\\project.config C:\\compilepath\\\n\nIf I do not have the full path, it runs for a while after a restart, and then stops.\n\nAlso as mentioned on the comments to this post, if there are spaces in full path, then one needs quotation marks around the command. E.g.\n\n\"C:\\The folder with spaces\\ABCDEF\\xcopy.exe\" /Y C:\\projectpath\\project.config C:\\compilepath\\\n\nNote that this example with regards to spaces is not tested."
