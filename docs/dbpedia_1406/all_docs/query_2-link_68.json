        "text": "Stephen A. Smith is riled up. Sort of. During a mid-July call from his New Jersey home, the conversation turns to labels and he’s suddenly yelling into the receiver: “I’m not a podcaster! I just happen to be doing a podcast.” The combative orator of ESPN morning flagship First Take and, yes, his eponymous podcast leans into his persona, but also sheds it just as quickly. “I’m sorry, could you hold on? My daughter’s giving me an ugly look,” he says, his tone changing as he turns his attention to one of his two children. “Daddy just has to finish this.”\n\nThen he’s back to his thunderous monologue, the kind that has helped propel Smith to the upper echelon of sports media. His 2019 contract extension with ESPN made him the highest-paid talent in network history. And while his salary has since been eclipsed by Troy Aikman, Joe Buck and Pat McAfee, that could change again with his current renegotiation — which, reports suggest, might approach $100 million over five more years. The 57-year-old Queens native and frequent controversy magnet wants to be top dog. But he’s equally keen on the idea of not being “the sports guy” forever.\n\nYour ESPN contract expires in July 2025. Are you comfortable with the public discourse around your renegotiation?\n\nEverybody and their grandmother knows! Only a fool would speak about their contract during negotiations, but there’s only so many times you can say “no comment.” When I feel the need to speak on it is when I think of what people have missed. When I got fired [ESPN let Smith go in 2009 before rehiring him in 2011], everybody knew that I failed in the ratings. As they chronicled it, I blew my career. When I came back, I realized there are rules. I played by them and I won. That’s how you go to the negotiating table.\n\nWhat does “playing by the rules” mean to you?\n\nWalt Disney doesn’t play. Whatever you do, you are representing the mouse. Under those standards, this little snot nose, peanut head, Black kid from New York City became number one doing things their way and doing things my way. And I don’t feel like I’m working for the man. In broadcasting, originally, it was just about being riveting enough to stand out. I was oblivious to the importance of revenue and ratings. My attitude was “my popularity is my popularity.” Now I know that when ESPN is making money, I’m a big part of it. And if Disney or ESPN are losing money, it ain’t because of me.\n\nI’ve heard of you referred to as a “company man,” something that seems rare at any conglomerate today. Do you agree with the label?\n\nPeople who feel that way are full of shit. They all answer to somebody. You think you can go on YouTube and just do what you want to? This notion that somebody goes out there and doesn’t have to answer to anybody’s a flat-out lie. I’m not trying to throw any shade — I’m a fan and I’m an admirer of his — but when Joe Rogan got himself into trouble years ago, he was number one by a mile in the podcast stratosphere. So why was he in trouble? He had somebody to answer to. If you’re paid with someone else’s money, so do you. No individual is bigger than a conglomerate. The only person that is free is the person that ain’t getting paid.\n\nWhat’s your take on the likely demise of Inside the NBA? That’s a lot of legacy broadcasting talent who are about to be free agents.\n\nI’m not worried about them. They can have a platform anytime they want to. Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, Shaquille O’Neal and Ernie Johnson are treasures in the industry. I can’t imagine the NBA going on without them. If it does, it needs to be because it’s their choice. If TNT indeed is not a part of the NBA package [the NBA rejected TNT’s contract renewal], why in God’s name would somebody else not grab all of them?\n\nCan a sportscaster or analyst be as relevant on streaming?\n\nCertainly. That’s the direction that it’s going. What people are confused about is they think linear is dying. Watching on a TV, as opposed to a smartphone, is a different matter than linear content. Linear content’s not going to go away because advertisers won’t let it. They want organization, structure, intros and outros. If you don’t have that ability, it’s not going to work for you.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on athletes turned pundits?\n\nThere’s a few of them that, when they open their mouths, don’t know what the hell they’re talking about. Just a few. Those people should do their research more. Outside of that, I’ve got no problem with it.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times last year, you said that you’d welcome a reprieve from engaging in a contentious format on TV every day. Do you want less arguing in your life?\n\nIt’s not a matter of wanting less. I love First Take. I hope to do it for years to come, if things could be worked out. My issue is not First Take. It’s about being limited to First Take. There’s a lot that I can do. I know how to interview, host television shows, expand my horizons beyond the world of sports. I wouldn’t mind doing something similar to Bill Maher or John Oliver or The Daily Show. If I can do my debate show in the morning and then do other things, I’d be very happy with it.\n\nAre you putting that desire out there? There are noticeably zero Black hosts in late night.\n\nThere’s a lot that I don’t have to tell people. For me, the opportunities are there. I’m at Disney because I know they’ve got a plethora of things that I could be doing. When you work for a place like that, you leave your options open. Outside of that, I do let people know that I’m not interested in being pigeonholed in sports.\n\nDid you enjoy subbing on Jimmy Kimmel Live?\n\nI was nervous as hell, but it was one of the most fulfilling experiences. They told me I was going to have to make people laugh for a few minutes, and I was scared to death. Next thing you know, I’m talking for 18 minutes.\n\nWho do you never want to interview again — and who is still on your list?\n\nIf you have something to say, I’ll interview you. I don’t care who you are — whether you’re the president of the United States or a Ku Klux Klan member. I can interview anybody. I would love to interview Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, 50 Cent, Jay-Z. I’m probably going to call Bill O’Reilly soon.\n\nThat group really runs the gamut — and some of them feed into the narrative that you are cozy with conservatives. What’s your take on that?\n\nI don’t care. I’m a registered independent. I have voted Democrat most of the time, but sometimes I haven’t been happy about it. I don’t like the idea of anybody telling me that just because I’m Black, this is what I should do. I am a centrist that leans left. I’m fiscally conservative. I love capitalism! But it doesn’t mean that I’m completely opposed to certain entitlement programs that uplift communities. But they’ll label me this way because I’m friends with Sean Hannity. I’m not friends with him because of his politics. I’m friends with him because when I was fired, he went on a mission to help me resurrect my career.\n\nStill, you realize that it’s challenging for a lot of people to understand why somebody who doesn’t agree with a Hannity would be friends with a Hannity.\n\nWhen people look at me on Fox News and want to denigrate me, I’m like, “Didn’t you see me on NewsNation 30 minutes earlier, agreeing with Chris Cuomo?” They choose not to see that because they want to feed their narrative. That’s children’s games. I’m a grown-up. I don’t believe for one second that because someone disagrees with me that they’re a no-good bastard — or, if you are a conservative and you happen to be Black, that it makes you a sellout. That’s weak. Let’s be substantive.\n\nLet’s go in the opposite direction. Stephen A., how do you relax?\n\nPlaying pool, going to the movies and spending time with the people I love. Because I have love in my life, I’m not in search of it. I’m good.\n\nAll right, before I let you go, what’s your current relationship with hockey?\n\nNot a damn thing. (Laughs.) But I’ve got a lot of admiration for [NHL commissioner] Gary Bettman. And my interest is piqued after being there for game seven [of the Stanley Cup Finals]. I need to pay more attention, because I enjoyed it significantly more than I thought I would."
