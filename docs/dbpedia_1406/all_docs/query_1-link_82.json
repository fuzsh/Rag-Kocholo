        "text": "An Olympic athlete has shown off an unusual condition dubbed ‘shotputter hand’, developed as a result of competing in the track and field event.\n\nRyan Crouser was appearing on the US-based TODAY show when he revealed the difference between his throwing and non-throwing hand.\n\nHolding up both hands, the studio guests were visibly shocked by the discrepancies in size.\n\nExplaining the difference, Crouser said: “Shot put hand and non-shot put hand. So you can see, the right is quite a bit bigger.”\n\nThe shotput for the men’s event comes in at a whopping 7.26kg and given Crouser has been competing for over 10 years, it’s no surprise the weighty ball has taken its toll.\n\nThe Oregan-born athlete continued: “It just takes a beating.\n\n“Push on the fingertips. It just doesn’t move. So 16 pounds going almost 40 miles an hour off the fingertips, you get strong fingertips.\"\n\nHis trusty hands have served him well, with Crouser becoming the first-ever shotputter - man or woman - to win three consecutive Olympic golds.\n\nRead more...

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nFirst topping the podium at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, Crouser returned to defend his crown in Tokyo five years later.\n\nHe continued his form at this year’s Games, taking gold almost one full metre clear of his nearest competitor and countryman Joe Kovacs.\n\nAnd on his latest achievement, Crouser commented: \"I appreciate this one the most.”\n\nBut the 31-year-old isn’t done there, with Crouser having set his sights on returning for the LA Olympics in four years.\n\nOn the prospect of competing at a home Games, Crouser said: “That would be the dream as an Olympian to retire at Olympics on home soil.\n\n\"For me it would be the fourth. That would be a dream come true, so I'm trying to hang on until then.\"\n\nIt will be 32 years since the US last hosted the Summer Olympics by the time athletes descend on California in 2028.\n\nBut unusually for the modern Olympics, the athletics programme is set to come in the first week of the Games.\n\nIt’s because SoFi Stadium, which is hosting the Games’ opening ceremony is also the venue for the swimming competition, which usually dominates the Olympics’ first week."
