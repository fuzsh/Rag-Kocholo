        "text": "After watching every episode I can I was so disappointed it became a nightly ritual for me to watch. I feel it has in many ways helped me on my journey with the lord, and my relationship as well, I use to think it was no use furthering my relationship cause I felt unworthy and undeserving of his love because of everything he has done for all us especially for me, but this show has given me scripture and knowledge of where to find my lord especially when I need him most. So I thank each and everyone of you who pay it forward cause I have watched this show and I have helped with what I can and hopefully continue to contribute as much as I can I look at it as offering for the lord so we all may bring our lost brother or sister out there closer to God, I will pray everyday for the one left out of the 99 may we find you and bring you home whoever you are, and remember god loves you unconditionally without a shadow of a doubt no matter what itâs never to late to come to the lord no matter what you have done you will be forgiven, and if you do start your journey with the lord remember you work your own salvation out with the lord he will guide you where you need to be and it doesnât happen overnight so donât get discouraged and always stay persistent even when you forget stay persistent start your new day and repent daily even if you feel unworthy he will help you. Thanks Dallas for all you do I appreciate your good works in the lord\n\nI watched the first season marathon style while stuck at home after my sonâs surgery. He would wander in the living room and end up staying a while, asking questions, laughing, and (hereâs the kicker) not looking at his phone! The last 2 episodes he stayed for the entirety of the episodes. He asked questions that could only be answered by starting over - which we did! This gave us a wonderful opportunity to not just share the gospel story, but explore the humanity of Jesus, discuss the history of the time, and answer all of his questions about the âflash backsâ to the Old Testament. My son doesnât sit through ANY show - even major motion pictures unless we are at a movie theater. The fact that this series had him fully engaged to the point of asking questions and talking about it with me after is HUGE!! I am struck by how any license taken with the backstories or the characters personalities never veered from the biblical script - it just filled in the blank. I was expecting some deviation as weâve seen so many times in Bible movies and mini series of the past. You only ENHANCED the biblical script and didnât change it in any way. I am downloading the app to watch season 2. I am 100% behind you and this movement, and I am diligently praying God uses this to mount a spiritual revolution calling people to Christ and deepening the faith of believers everywhere. God bless you and the work of your hands!!\n\nI love this show so much. Itâs changed my life. My relationship with God has become so strong. Now, I continually want to please him. He is my Light and my Salvation. Thank you to Dallas Jenkins for listening to the call and following the leading of the Holy Spirit in this project. It has brought so many of us closer to our God, and renewed our focus on the Almighty. Reading my Bible is more enjoyable now, and I can understand things in a way I didnât before. This show is great at bringing out the humanity and struggles of the disciples, as well as that of Yeshua/Jesusâ¦ being that He was God, but in a very human body. Everyone is so relatable and I see my own life in some of the stories, like Mary of Magdala, Nathanial, and even Nicodemus in some ways. There isnât an episode that doesnât choke me up, and itâs the same no matter how many times I watch. Iâve watched this series about 6 or 7 times now, and I will continue to watch when I need to put my focus back on God and less on the problems of life. What I love most about this show is that itâs the most Messianic version of Jesus that there has ever been. Jesus was a Jew and so many forget that, especially those that have made Jesus films in the past. This is the most middle eastern depiction of Jesus and His disciples that had ever been made. I appreciate how much time and effort that Dallas and His crew put in to get this all right. Thank you all again for your work. Itâs been amazing!!!"
