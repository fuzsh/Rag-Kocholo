        "text": "The Office\n\nAmerican television series\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 20, 2024, 2:09 AM ET (USA Today)\n\n'The Dealership,' a parody of 'The Office,' rockets Chevy dealer to social media stardom\n\nThe Office, popular American television situation comedy series following the daily lives of a group of employees working at the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network from 2005 to 2013. Although The Office received mostly middling ratings while it was on the air, peaking in its fifth season with an average of roughly nine million live and same-day viewers per episode, it later became a streaming-era sensation. The show helped launch the careers of actors Steve Carell, John Krasinski, and Mindy Kaling, among others.\n\nThe Office is a mock documentary, or mockumentary, that aimed to portray “in a realistic style some ordinary American office workers trapped in a confined space with their immature, inappropriate, bizarre, or deluded coworkers and one horribly overconfident supervisor,” according to the casting call distributed for the series’ pilot episode. In order to further its appearance as a documentary, the show was shot with a single-camera setup without a studio audience or laugh track, and reality television veteran cinematographer Randall Einhorn was credited with creating this look. The main action of the show is supplemented by talking-head interviews, or “confessionals,” in which characters speak directly to the camera.\n\nCast and characters\n\nIn casting the show, the creative team sought actors who were believable as everyday people and were not well known from their previous work. Actor Steve Carell stars as Michael Scott, the hapless and incompetent regional manager whose desperate loneliness and need for love fuel misguided attempts to manage his employees and connect with others. Scott’s second-in-command, assistant to the regional manager Dwight Schrute, played by Rainn Wilson, is a beet farmer, sci-fi nerd, and volunteer sheriff’s deputy who takes any excuse to go on a power trip at work.\n\nEarly seasons of the show foreground a burgeoning romance between salesperson Jim Halpert and receptionist Pam Beesly, played by actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer, respectively. Although Jim often plays elaborate practical jokes on Dwight, sometimes with Pam’s help, both he and Pam primarily serve as comedic “straight men” whose relative normalcy heightens the absurdity of the characters around them.\n\nAn ensemble comedy, the cast also features a number of actors known for their improvisational comedy expertise, such as Angela Kinsey as uptight head accountant Angela Martin, Oscar Nuñez as know-it-all accountant Oscar Martinez, Kate Flannery as chaotic supplier relations representative Meredith Palmer, and Craig Robinson as blunt warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin. Other cast members include Brian Baumgartner as bumbling accountant Kevin Malone, Leslie David Baker as disgruntled salesperson Stanley Hudson, and Phyllis Smith, who was working for the show’s casting director at the time and for whom the role of soft-spoken salesperson Phyllis Lapin was created in response to her line readings during auditions. Three cast members served double duty as writers (and eventually producers) for the series in addition to playing beloved characters; they include B.J. Novak as self-involved temporary worker Ryan Howard, Mindy Kaling as gossipy customer service representative Kelly Kapoor, and Paul Lieberstein as beleaguered human resources manager Toby Flenderson. Later seasons introduced series regular Ed Helms as insecure and status-obsessed salesperson Andy Bernard.\n\nOrigin and cultural context\n\nProducers Ben Silverman and Greg Daniels based The Office on the British situation comedy of the same name created by actors Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Gervais and Merchant joined the American production along with Howard Klein as the first season’s executive producers. The pilot episode is nearly a shot-by-shot remake of the British source material. After an underwhelming and short first season, Daniels decided to diverge from the bleak tone of the British series by making Michael Scott more likable than his British counterpart, David Brent (played by Gervais), allowing the American show to develop its own comedic voice.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nBeyond the talent and artistry of the show’s cast and creative team, some critics and members of the show’s production team attribute the show’s success to a confluence of cultural factors present in the mid-to-late 2000s. The Office arrived at NBC right when the most popular situation comedies of the 1990s, including Friends (1994–2004) and Frasier (1993–2004), were wrapping up, and it seemed to audiences that there was nothing new or exciting on network television. The Office, by subverting the aesthetics of reality television during a time when reality television was gaining prominence in the U.S. and applying them to a scripted comedy, was something truly novel in this cultural climate.\n\nAdditionally, there may have been something particular about Michael Scott that spoke to the concerns and preoccupations of many American viewers at the time of the show’s premiere. In Andy Greene’s book The Office: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sitcom of the 2000s (2020), television critic Rob Sheffield described Michael Scott as “the archetypal TV figure of that decade” because of his similarity to then president George W. Bush. The Office began airing during the last years of Bush’s presidency, and as one of the show’s writers, Aaron Shure, noted in Greene’s book, “because Bush was president,” a seemingly clueless boss like Scott spoke to a question that “was sort of [in] the zeitgeist of ‘What does it mean when the people in charge are incompetent?’ ”\n\nLegacy\n\nThroughout its run, The Office garnered significant critical acclaim, with 42 Emmy Award nominations and five wins, nine Golden Globe Award nominations and one win, a Peabody Award win, and several nominations and wins for both Screen Actors Guild Awards and Writers Guild of America Awards. The show’s popularity has only grown since its final episode aired in 2013. According to Nielsen Media Research, Americans streamed more than 57 billion minutes of The Office in 2020, making it, by far, the most-streamed television show of that year."
