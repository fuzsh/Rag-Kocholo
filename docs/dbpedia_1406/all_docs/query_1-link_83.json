I don’t want to be ‘the story’.\n\n\"I don’t want to be interviewing someone and for them to say to me, ‘I’m so sorry’.”\n\nI look forward to seeing Trisha back doing what she does best next week.\n\nIT’S DEEP FEELINGS FOR INDIA\n\nQUEEN Charlotte’s India Amarteifio has won another leading role.\n\nThe actress, who rose to fame in the Bridgerton prequel, will be joined by Maxton Hall’s Damian Hardung in the coming-of-age drama Into The Deep Blue.\n\nIt follows friends Fiona and Nick, who cross paths at a group therapy session for people have who have struggled with loss.\n\nA weekend trip together sees deeper feelings start to brew.\n\nIt marks India’s first role since the success of the Netflix hit.\n\nBut despite the huge popularity, it is not due for a second series.\n\nShow creator Shomda Rhimes is instead working on the fourth series of Bridgerton, which follows Benedict and will start filming later this year.\n\nSIMON IN NEW LOOK ORDER\n\nTHINGS are looking a little less traditional for Simon Bird and his on-screen son Harry Connor as they return for a second run of Everything Else Burns.\n\nThey have swapped their smart suits for bright orange trackies for the new series.\n\nDespite protests from dad David, Harry’s character Aaron tries to drag their religious sect The Order into the modern day.\n\nThe Channel 4 series follows the God-fearing Lewis family, who are part of a puritanical Christian sect.\n\nThe six new episodes are expected to air next year.\n\nKate O'Flynn returns as mum Fiona and Amy James-Kelly is daughter Rachel.\n\nNew cast members include Fleabag’s Sian Clifford.\n\nANDREW AND A SET OF KNIVES\n\nANDREW SCOTT is used to being the hot priest – but the Fleabag actor seems to have met his match with Josh O'Connor while filming their new Knives Out movie.\n\nHe chatted to Josh, who was in religious robes for the latest murder mystery instalment from Netflix.\n\nIt also features Glenn Close, Kerry Washington, and Cailee Spaeny.\n\nThe third film in the franchise, which follows Daniel Craig as private investigator Benoit Blanc – “the world’s greatest detective” – will be called Wake Up Dead Man.\n\nIt follows the success of 2019 film Knives Out, and its 2022 follow-up Glass Onion.\n\nAndrew, dressed in a checked shirt, joked with Josh as they filmed in Epping Forest, Essex, alongside No Country For Old Men actor Josh Brolin, who was also in priest robes.\n\nBut they probably won’t be laughing for long, as filmmakers revealed the storyline will be Benoit’s most dangerous case yet.\n\nThe film will hit screens in 2025.\n\nSCOTT’S ACROSS TO BEAR\n\nCELEBRITY Race Across The World is designed to test the navigational skills and endurance of competitors.\n\nBut for Scott and his then-fiancé Sam, taking part in the BBC One show was more a test of their relationship.\n\nThe series starts off in northern Brazil next Wednesday and Scott, whose wedding was in June, said: “Before we get married, everyone says the holiday test is you know you could be with somebody if you go on holiday with them.\n\n\"This is like that – times a thousand.\n\n“Not that I have any doubts Sam is the one for me, but there will be times in this, I imagine, when it will get stressful.\n\n“We’ll struggle without our dog, talking to family, and EastEnders.\n\n\"We watch that every night, so that’s going to be a struggle, not knowing what’s going on.\n\n\"We’re a good team I think. Well, we’ll find out.”"
