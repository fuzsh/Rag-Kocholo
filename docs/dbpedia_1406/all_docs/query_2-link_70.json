        "text": "Peloton will hold events at both Peloton Studios New York (PSNY) and Peloton Studios London (PSL) focused on Tread pace targets. Peloton shared the news via the @PelotonStudios Instagram Stories:\n\nJoin us for a behind the scenes look at one of our newest Peloton Tread features: Pace Targets. You’ll get to hear from the team behind the feature and learn how to incorporate it into your training routine.\n\nThe Tread Pace Targets event in New York will take place on Thursday, August 15th from 5:00pm – 6:00pm ET.\n\nThe Tread Pace Targets event in London will be on Friday, August 16 at 4:30-6:00pm local time.\n\nThese events are free, but do require a RSVP to save your spot and make sure you get in.\n\nThe event will cover the following topics: pace targets and how they work; how members can use pace targets to improve their fitness; how Peloton produces classes specifically for pace targets; how to find those classes on the Tread; and finally, a demonstration with a “special guest.” Though not confirmed, the special guest is likely a Peloton instructor.\n\nPace targets are a new addition to the Peloton platform, having only been unveiled earlier this summer. The feature is only available on the Tread and Tread+. Rather than cueing a specific speed, the instructor indicates an effort level. Those effort levels are automatically mapped out and displayed to speed ranges on the Tread based on the difficulty level selected by the member. If you’re unfamiliar with Peloton’s pace target levels, you can find a comprehensive overview via our guide.\n\nWe shared a couple of weeks ago that Peloton plans to bring pace targets to walking classes as well.\n\nAgain, pace target classes are currently only available on Tread/Tread+ devices; they are not available within the app or web browser, and can be somewhat difficult to find. We have a complete list of pace target classes available on our site.\n\nYou can find more details and sign up for the event on the respective: London event and New York event\n\nSupport the site! Enjoy the news & guides we provide? Help us keep bringing you the news. Pelo Buddy is completely free, but you can help support the site with a one-time or monthly donation that will go to our writers, editors, and more. Find out more details here."
