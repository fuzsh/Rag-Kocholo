        "text": "The BBC is currently facing a dilemma – what does the corporation do with all its archive footage of Huw Edwards, who this week pleaded guilty to three charges of making indecent images of children?\n\nNot only did the former BBC News presenter announce the Queen’s death in 2022, but he also presided over the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, 2012 London Olympics and 2014 Commonwealth Games, and the weddings of Prince William and Prince Harry, as well as many other seminal moments in recent British history.\n\n“News is a matter of public record,” one BBC executive told The Times of the predicament this week. “What a nightmare.”\n\nOne staffer told the publication that the BBC can’t take down news clips of Edwards because they are “considered social history”, but added that they “can take down documentaries and other content that doesn’t relate to news”.\n\nArchive footage of Edwards reporting on many huge events has already appeared in numerous documentaries over the years – most recently in Channel 4’s The Rise and Fall of Boris Johnson, which at the time of writing is available to watch on the broadcaster’s website.\n\nHere, we have compiled a list of all the programmes that have already used archive footage of the disgraced presenter, as well as TV shows and films where he has appeared in a cameo role.\n\nThe most notable examples of his cameos include in the 2012 Bond film Skyfall, in which he can be seen reading a fictional news bulletin about MI6 being plunged into crisis. He also appeared in a 2006 episode of Doctor Who, about a girl who can make people disappear, which has been removed from iPlayer.\n\nArchive appearances\n\n1997: The Enormous Election with Dennis Pennis\n\n2002: Timeshift\n\n2003: Who Wants to Steal a Million?\n\n2004: Who Killed Kirsty MacColl?\n\n2004: Old Big ’Ead: A Tribute to Brian Clough\n\n2006: To Kill a Burglar: The Tony Martin Story\n\n2006: Time Trumpet (two episodes)\n\n2007: Taking Liberties\n\n2007: The Funny Side of the News\n\n2008: Heroes Unmasked\n\n2008: Beautiful People\n\n2009: Mars: A Horizon Guide\n\n2010: Five Days that Changed Britain\n\n2012: The Final Frontier?
