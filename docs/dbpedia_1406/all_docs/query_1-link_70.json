        "text": "THE STUDIO where Dance Moms: The New Era was filmed has quietly closed their doors without warning ahead of the show's series premiere, The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal.\n\nStudio Bleu Dance Center, the hub of the highly anticipated Dance Moms reboot, left customers stunned after abruptly canceling future classes with no explanation.\n\nDevoted Dance Moms fans are familiar with the Ashburn, Virginia, dance studio and teacher Glo Hampton, the star of the new Hulu series, which debuted on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, despite the studio's appearance on TV with its packed classes and dozens of dancers eager to be selected for Glo's super elite dance team, in reality, that's not its reputation.\n\nGoogle has the studio listed as \"permanently closed,\" as neighboring businesses confirmed that they haven't been operating for \"at least a month.\"\n\nThe U.S. Sun called the studio, but received no answer and could not reach the owner, Kimberly Rishi, via phone or email.\n\nANGRY CUSTOMERS\n\nSpeculation had been circulating for weeks on social media about what happened to the popular dance studio after suddenly closing up shop.\n\nSome fans suspected in an online thread that the move was to boost show ratings due to its timing with the series premiere.\n\nOthers suggested that an upgrade to a bigger studio is in the works, but there is no record that that is the case.\n\nThe closure has yet to be addressed on Studio Bleu's social media accounts, as their latest Facebook post is dated June 30.\n\nTheir website states that summer camps don't conclude until August 9.\n\n\"Wow… and to think Studio Bleu used to be one of the most popular dance studios on the East Coast… they claimed to have thousands of students at one point,\" one shocked social media user wrote in another online thread.\n\nAnother user, who claimed her daughter was a student at the studio, added, \"It's a very sad ending for my daughter. This all came to a head right before nationals but our dancers kept it together to support one another.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another Dance Mom, Dana Thompson, revealed she and her daughter Kennedy left the school before things went south for Studio Bleu.\n\nDana first mentioned the duo wasn't returning to the studio in a TikTok video she posted on their joint page last month.\n\nShe explained her decision exclusively to The U.S. Sun via email, \"We left the studio in May after Kennedy auditioned and was accepted to a program at a different studio more aligned with her future goals.\n\n\"When we left in May, the studio was still in business and teachers and students were preparing for Nationals. We have not been involved with the studio since then,\" Dana said.\n\nTEACHERS UNITE\n\nStudio Bleu teachers were also left scrambling to look for work after the school's unexpected close, just weeks after their students competed in the National Talent Competition in early May.\n\nHowever, former Studio Bleu customers revealed in an online thread that two of the school's teachers opened their own studio, Rise, nearby and brought many of their former colleagues and students with them.\n\nThe U.S. Sun can exclusively confirm a few teachers who recently taught at Studio Bleu are listed on the class schedule on Rise's website.\n\nOn top of that, former Studio Bleu dance instructor Renee Henderson ranted about the downfall of the beloved dance studio in a lengthy Facebook post on July 3.\n\n'CRUMBLED INTO PIECES'\n\n\"In the last few weeks, my second home and my children’s second home has crumbled into pieces,\" Renee wrote.\n\nShe also revealed that the building had been listed for rent and lashed out at the owner, Kimberly, over her handling of the studio's apparent downward spiral.\n\n\"Three weeks ago, Studio Bleu’s building was unexpectedly listed for rent...We hadn’t been treated with the respect we deserved in a long time.\n\n\"We continued there to give the students stability, love, and training. We tried to encourage the owner to make changes. She wouldn’t listen.\"\n\nThe U.S. Sun can confirm that Studio Bleu was listed for rent on several real estate websites earlier this year, but the listings are no longer advertised.\n\nRenee noted that she resigned from her position at Studio Bleu and was seeking opportunities elsewhere.\n\nShe again shared her heartbreak over the situation in another post weeks later, writing, \"Our dance home was recently destroyed and lifelong friends are now scattered.\"\n\nThe U.S. Sun reached out to Renee for a comment but has not heard back.\n\nA NEW ERA\n\nDance Moms: A New Era is a spin-off from the original Lifetime series Dance Moms, which documented Abby Lee Dance Company owner and instructor Abby Lee Miller's harsh teaching style for her elite competition team.\n\nIt also showcased the battles between the students' mothers, who went to great lengths to get their kids on top."
