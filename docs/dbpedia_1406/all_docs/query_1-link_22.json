        "text": "The hit series 9-1-1 was canceled by Fox after its sixth season, with the network citing rising costs — that high-quality cast full of big-name actors doesn't come cheap, nor do the show's high production values. Fortunately for you, though, 9-1-1 lives on after being picked up by ABC for Season 7. And while the new season of 9-1-1 was delayed by the dual actors and writers strikes in 2023, the wait for new episodes has finally come to an end.\n\nOperator: 9-1-1. What's your emergency?\n\nCaller: Help! I need details about the hit drama 9-1-1!\n\nOperator: Stand by. Help is on the way.\n\nShowcasing the lives of the emergency workers who come to the rescue of those in crisis each week, 9-1-1 quickly became a popular procedural drama on Fox, and it's off to a big start on ABC. It's no surprise, as the highly rated show was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Tim Minear and stars big names like Angela Bassett, Peter Krause, Aisha Hinds, and Jennifer Love Hewitt.\n\nWith the new season finally here, we'll try to answer your questions, such as when 9-1-1 Season 7 premiered, who is in Season 7 of 9-1-1, and where you can watch new and old episodes of the series.\n\n9-1-1 Season 7 latest news\n\nDon't worry about eating that week-old supermarket sushi or going on a budget Groupon cruise, because the best first responders in the business aren't going anywhere. On April 2, ABC renewed 9-1-1 for Season 8, just a few weeks after the series made its network debut on ABC.\n\n9-1-1 Season 7 premiere date\n\nLike most scripted shows on the fall slate, the new season of 9-1-1 was delayed by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, but the new season premiered on March 14 at 8/7c. New episodes of 9-1-1 air Thursdays at 8/7c, followed by Season 20 of Grey's Anatomy.\n\n9-1-1 Season 7 trailers\n\nBobby and Athena were whistling some Celine Dion in the premiere, which promised a titanic problem. The new full-length trailer for 9-1-1 Season 7, released at the end of February, gives us our best look at the highly touted cruise ship disaster that kicks off the season. And things do NOT look good. Terrorists, bombs, and a creeping waterline make this particular emergency look like one of the show's biggest yet.\n\nAt the end of January, ABC dropped the first teaser for 9-1-1 Season 7, a 30-second spot, and it promises us big action — about half of the teaser is spent focused on a capsizing cruise ship: the same cruise ship that Angela Bassett and Peter Krause's characters took a vacation on at the end of Season 6.\n\nWhy did 9-1-1 move over to ABC for Season 7?\n\nDespite being Fox's most-watched and one of its highest-rated programs (The Masked Singer beat it by mere percentage points last season) for the last several years, the network canceled 9-1-1 after six seasons on May 1, 2023. Why? The same reason anyone makes this kind of decision: money. At an estimated $9-10 million per episode thanks to its veteran cast of well-known actors and pricey special effects, 9-1-1 simply became too rich for Fox.\n\nFor ABC, the move made more sense. 20th Century Fox TV, the studio that makes 9-1-1, is no longer owned by Fox; it was acquired by ABC parent company Disney in the big Disney-Fox deal in 2019, a few seasons into 9-1-1's run. By airing 9-1-1 on ABC, Disney now has complete ownership over the series and can keep all the money for the corporation instead of sharing profits with an outside studio. 9-1-1 spin-off 9-1-1: Lone Star will continue to air on Fox, even though it's also made by 20th Century Fox TV.\n\nBack in May, Oliver Stark, who plays the firefighter Evan \"Buck\" Buckley, spoke with Variety about the network switch for 9-1-1. Stark mentioned the cast and crew did not hear about the change until a couple of hours before the official press release was sent out.\n\nOne of the most exciting parts of the interview was when Stark talked about 9-1-1 having potential crossovers with ABC shows, since 9-1-1 and 9-1-1: Lone Star crossovers are now \"extremely unlikely,\" as they are on different networks. When speaking of the network changing to ABC, Stark said to Variety, \"I don't know, maybe it even opens us up to possible other crossover with ABC procedurals. Maybe we end up on The Rookie.\"\n\nWhat is 9-1-1 Season 7 about?\n\nAt the end of Season 6, we saw Bobby and Athena go on a much-needed vacation by embarking on a cruise. And now we know that cruise did not go well. There is also the matter of Maddie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Chimney's (Kenneth Choi) upcoming vows, which may call for a wedding episode in Season 7. For more on Season 7, read our preview from the set of 9-1-1, in which the cast and creators discuss the Madney wedding, the biggest disaster the show has ever done, and much more.\n\nWho will be in 9-1-1 Season 7?\n\nCurrently, there have been no announcements of cast shake-ups for Season 7 of 9-1-1, so we expect all the main cast to return for the season.\n\n9-1-1 Season 7 main cast:\n\nPeter Krause as Bobby Nash\n\nAngela Bassett as Athena Grant Nash\n\nOliver Stark as Evan \"Buck\" Buckley\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt as Maddie Buckley\n\nKenneth Choi as Howard \"Chimney\" Han\n\nAisha Hinds as Henrietta \"Hen\" Wilson\n\nCorinne Massiah as May Grant\n\nRyan Guzman as Eddie Díaz\n\nGavin McHugh as Christopher Díaz\n\nHas 9-1-1 been renewed for Season 8?\n\nIt sure has. On April 2, ABC ordered Season 8 of 9-1-1, Variety reported, following strong ratings for the Season 7 premiere. There are no details about the upcoming eighth season yet.\n\nWhere can I watch 9-1-1?\n\nSeason 7 of 9-1-1 airs Thursdays at 8/7c on ABC, and you can stream new episodes on Hulu the next day. To catch up on the first six seasons, or rewatch it and binge it from the beginning, you can also use Hulu to stream all the current episodes available.\n\nSeason 7 premiered Thursday, March 14 at 8/7c."
