You can use the .attr() function to set the src and the .text() to get the url as follows:

$( document ).ready( function(){ let url = $('#sample').text(); if(url) $('#myImg').attr('src', url); } );

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <textarea id="sample">https://tvorbawebu.net/eshopserver/uploads/thumbnail/Pentair-Led-Pool-Lights.jpg</textarea> <div class="viewimage"><img alt="" id="myImg" src=""></div>
