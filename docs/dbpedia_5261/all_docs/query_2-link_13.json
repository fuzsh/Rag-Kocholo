        "text": "Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading: Spotify Technology — Shares surged 12% after the music streaming company posted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Gross margin and operating income also surpassed expectations. Analysts said they remain cautiously optimistic despite softness in monthly active user counts, pointing to strong margin performance and the company's focus on premium subscribers and bundles. United Parcel Service — The package delivery company plunged around 12%, hitting a new 52-week low, after posting a miss on both top and bottom lines in the second quarter. UPS reported $1.79 in earnings per share on $21.80 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had estimated $1.99 in earnings per share and revenue of $22.18 billion. Shares were also headed for their worst day on record. MSCI — The stock popped 7.9% after the company reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street's estimates. MSCI posted earnings of $3.64 per share, excluding items, on revenue of $707.9 million. This is above the $3.55 in earnings per share on $696.4 million in revenue that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting. Pentair — The water treatment company moved 9% higher, putting the stock on pace for a record close. Pentair beat expectations for the second quarter, posting earnings of $1.22 per share, excluding items, compared to the FactSet consensus estimate of $1.14 per share. Revenue also topped estimates. Additionally, Pentair raised its guidance for the full year. NXP Semiconductors — Shares plummeted more than 7% after the company missed earnings estimates for the second quarter. NXP Semiconductors posted adjusted earnings of $3.20 per share, which was below the LSEG consensus estimate of $3.21 per share. However, revenue of $3.13 billion was in line with estimates. Crown Holdings — The stock advanced nearly 9% after the packaging company's second-quarter earnings beat. Crown posted earnings of $1.81 per share, which beat the FactSet consensus estimate of $1.59 per share. While the company's $3.04 billion in revenue just missed the consensus estimate of $3.06 billion, Crown raised its full-year guidance, topping expectations. Danaher — Shares rose 5.3% after the company reported earnings of $1.72 per share, excluding items, on $5.74 billion in revenue. That is above the FactSet consensus estimates of $1.57 per share on revenue of $5.59 billion. CEO Rainer Blair said in a statement that the company was \"particularly pleased with the sustained positive momentum in our bioprocessing business and with strong performance at Cepheid, which we believe gained market share in molecular testing again this quarter.\" Inter Parfums — The stock jumped nearly 9% after the fragrance manufacturer posted record net sales for the second quarter. The company also reaffirmed its full-year earnings and revenue, noting that sell-in continues to grow more slowly than sell-out. Comcast — Shares moved more than 2% lower after the company reported mixed results. Despite posting adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share that beat the LSEG consensus estimate of $1.12 per share, revenue for the second quarter of $29.69 billion came in below the expected $30.02 billion. Zions Bancorporation — Shares popped more than 6% on the back of second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street forecasts. The regional bank earned $1.28 per share, above the consensus estimate of $1.10 a share from analysts polled by LSEG. General Motors — Shares of the auto giant slid more than 6% after the firm said it is again slowing its plans for all-electric vehicles by further delaying a second U.S. electric truck plant and the Buick brand's first EV. The six-month delay in retooling the electric truck plant in Michigan also means GM will not achieve a prior target of having North American production capacity of one million EVs by 2025. GE Aerospace — The stock spiked more than 5% after the aerospace company's second-quarter earnings beat expectations for the second quarter. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share on $9.09 billion in revenue. According to LSEG estimates, analysts had expected earnings of 99 cents per share on $8.46 billion in revenue. Sherwin-Williams — Shares advanced nearly 7% after the company posted an earnings beat for the second quarter. Sherwin-Williams reported earnings of $3.70 per share, excluding items, above the $3.49 per share that analysts polled by FactSet were expecting. Revenue, however, came in below expectations at $6.27 billion compared to the FactSet consensus estimate of $6.33 billion. The company also slightly raised its full-year earnings guidance and expects low-single-digit revenue growth for both the third quarter and the full year. Lockheed Martin — The stock gained more than 5% after the defense company surpassed earnings and revenue expectations. Lockheed Martin also raised its earnings and revenue forecast for the full year. — CNBC's Alex Harring, Yun Li and Hakyung Kim contributed reporting.
