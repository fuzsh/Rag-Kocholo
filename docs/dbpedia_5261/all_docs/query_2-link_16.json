        "text": "Hi this is Craig with Quality Water Treatment also known as Craig the water guy. I hope you do great today. Today, I want to go over the replacement product Calcite Limestone.\n\nCalcite limestone is used in PH neutralizers also known as calcite filters. If you don't already have one let me tell you what calcite pH neutralizers do and what they're used for.\n\nGenerally they're installed at either well water applications or surface water applications. There's a lot of Wells out there and a lot of surface water where the pH balances below 7.0. Based on the pH scale 7.0 is neutral and below 7.0 is acidic.\n\nYou don't want to run acidic water through the plummet your hole because it's highly corrosive and it will eat up your plumbing and cause leaking over a period of time. If you have galvanized plumbing it'll cause red staining from the galvanized being blood out from the acidic water. If you have copper plumbing or any sort of copper or brass fittings within your PEC system it will bleed out the copper and the brass.\n\nThe copper would actually bleed out a bluish green color around your drains. Of course, that is also going to cause getting it leaking over a period of time while plumbing.\n\nSo it's very important not just for the aspect of saving your plumbing but for the aspect of health drink into water of course you don't want to drink water with a lot of copper and or galvanized lead heavy metal stuff like that in your water. So you can eliminate all those issues by raising the ph and protect your home and your investment.\n\nThe way the calcite Filter Works is you plummet it after your pressure tank so the water runs through the calcite filter. As soon as that water contacts the calcite the media inside that tank it'll automatically raise the ph to 7.0 to 7.1 which is at the neutral stage it regulates itself. So once it gets neutral it will not go any higher than that it stops dissolving, okay.\n\nFor the average family of four for household use only you will go through one 50 pound bag here every six months. If you're irrigated with it of course you're gonna use more. The best way to check it is if you have an opaque tank, beat it at, you could put a flashlight or some sort of light up against the tank, you can actually see the levels, the shadows inside the tank. Once the tank is 50% full you'll take exactly one 50 pounds okay.\n\nBut rule of thumb is a family of four household use solely, you are going to take a one 50 pound bag every six months, okay. So when you're adding the calcite it is very easy to do. You simply put your system in bypass or turn the water off to put it into a backwash mode manually and that will release the pressure off the tank and your plumbing.\n\nAt that point you disconnect the tank for the bypass valve of your plumbing. Pull the tank away a little bit, use your hands and unscrew the control valve from the tank. You're going to use a small hose and stick it in your tank and siphon some water out of the tank, okay. So you have room to add the calcite without overflowing water all over the place.\n\nAnd then inside the tank you're going to see a distributor tune of a PVC pipe in the center of that tank. What you're going to do is use some sort of cap or what I'll do in most cases is I'll use tape and I'll put a small amount of tape over the top of that distributor tube. And then I'll use a funnel of some sort and I'll set it over the top of the tag and over the top of that tube and I'll add my calcite to where I have anywhere from 10 to 12 inches of what we call free bore which is the route between the calcite and the top of the tank.\n\nIt's very important not to go more than 10 or 12 inches, you always want to leave that room. And the reason why you want to leave that room is because when the system goes to backwash itself automatically it has to be able to lift that calcite up and turn it over.\n\nIf you don't leave that room then of course it won't be able to move right and then you have problems. So make sure you leave 10 to 12 inches and don't add any more than that.\n\nWhen you're done adding your calcite you basically just unplug this center to the distributor tube. Clean the threads off on the tank itself with some water. Take a control valve stick it back on the tank screw it on you'll have to hand tighten, it hook it back to your plumbing open your bypass valve up slowly let the tank refill with water and then do an automatic regeneration to let the do calcite clean itself out because it will be kind of dusty you want to get the fines out of it.\n\nIt's a pretty simple process, so if you have any questions or you need to find this product you can visit our website at qualitywatertreatment.com. The manufacturer of this particular calcite is Imerys. We carry sometimes, we ship other brands as well depending on what our suppliers have but they all do the same thing, okay.So don't be alarmed if you get a bag of calcite that doesn't say Imerys on it, it's the same product it's just different manufacturer okay.\n\nYou can also reach out to us on our toll free number on our website or shoot us an email or use our live chat if you have any questions. Thank you very much and have a great day!"
