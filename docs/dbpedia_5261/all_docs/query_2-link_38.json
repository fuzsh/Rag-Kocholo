Read more describing the unit say 5 yr warranty when in fact the warranty is broken into two portions, 3yr for the system as a whole, and a further 2yrs on the cell. Wish I had read the fine print. After 3 years 3 months the timer stopped keeping time and contact was made with the manufacturer asking them to consider a replacement on good will. Pentair agreed, so I cant fault them in that respect. While the system has been good, the failure of the timer so soon is a big let down. If I have to keep buying replacement OEM timers at $300 ea and electricians to replace the timer $270, it works out to be quite an expensive buy. I think if there are others available to you, look at them before considering the Pentair\n\nGreat White II Pool CleanerI purchased the Great White II Pool Cleaner about a month ago, and it has exceeded my expectations!

Read moret, the more chance it will have of cleaning all areas of the pool. For our pool, it DOES travel to both shallow and deep ends - people that claim otherwise simply do not have it setup correctly, or need to add a length of hose or two. I made a complete torture test video of it for my youtube channel, where it cleaned what was weeks of heavy leaves and massive debris, after our previous cleaner died.
