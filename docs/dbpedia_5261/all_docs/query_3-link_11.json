        "text": "LONDON --Pentair plc (NYSE: PNR), a leader in helping the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, life’s most essential resource, and Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) are excited to announce a new collaboration to sustainably deliver great-tasting, high-quality drinking water while reducing the need for single-use plastic water bottles for the millions of travelers that visit and fly through the MSP international hub each year. MSP, owned and operated by the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC), is the 19th busiest airport in North America by passenger traffic.\n\nPentair is the first partner in MSP’s new strategic partnership program which aims to collaborate with businesses and community organizations to enhance the passenger experience and drive innovation. As the Official Water Sponsor of MSP, Pentair is working to help the airport promote sustainability through the installation of 10 HOPE Hydration HydroStations. The cutting-edge HydroStations are the first water refill stations of their kind at any airport worldwide, dispensing free, chilled, and filtered water while providing an interactive experience to users. Through the HydroStations, Pentair and MSP will be educating travelers about water-related issues and the positive environmental impact they can make by bringing and filling a reusable water bottle while traveling.\n\nEach of the HydroStations feature filtration technology by Everpure from Pentair Water Solutions, providing MSP employees and travelers with a free, great-tasting and more sustainable alternative to single-use plastic water bottles.\n\n“Pentair aims to create a better world for people and the planet through smart, sustainable water solutions,” said Adrian Chiu, EVP and President, Pentair Water Solutions. “Our Everpure filtration technology is a leader in the foodservice industry, and we are excited to bring our filtration expertise to MSP in support of their efforts to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable practices by providing travelers with free, filtered water at the HydroStations.”\n\nIt is estimated that the current network of 80 water bottle refill stations at MSP reduce the need for approximately 600 pounds* of single-use plastic bottles every day. Using integrated IoT technology, the HydroStations at MSP track real-time impact data associated with the elimination of single-use plastics including plastic and carbon emissions savings, which will be displayed on each HydroStation.\n\n“Our goal is to make it easy for passengers and our airport community to choose reusable options over single-use options,” said Brian Ryks, CEO of the MAC. “We’re excited about this strategic partnership because it shines a brighter spotlight on ways to reduce waste and support sustainable practices that go well beyond the airport.”\n\n“Our mission is to encourage people to Refill, not Landfill; we are excited to showcase the HOPE HydroStation at MSP, one of the world's leading sustainable airports, powered by Pentair's advanced Everpure filtration technology. This is a major step for us together towards building a more sustainable future everywhere,” said Jorge Richardson, HOPE Hydration CEO and Founder. “As frequent travelers, we understand the need for great hydration solutions in airports, and we are thrilled to help travelers make a positive environmental impact.”\n\nFor more information, visit Pentair.com/mspairport.\n\n*Assuming 20 oz plastic bottle with a weight of 14.7 oz.\n\nABOUT PENTAIR PLC\n\nAt Pentair, we help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, life’s most essential resource.
