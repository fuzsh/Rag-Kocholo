Revalia claims to be the successor of an Estonian ancient county, Revalia (or Revala in Estonian), which was also located in the today Harju region.

History

Early Era

Before the official independence, the now King Sander II started Revalia as a successor to the Ancient County of Revalia, which existed 800 years ago. The Revalian Kingdom claimed the whole ancient county of Revalia, which is the modern-day Harju county in the Republic of Estonia. The now King Sander II wasn't aware of micronationalism then, so the Revalian Kingdom existed mostly on papers.

Independence

The Revalian Kingdom was established because of many purposes; the now King Sander II had just found out about the micronational community and an organisation called ÜSSA was looking for an activity. Then he, who was himself a part of ÜSSA, offered the organisation to merge into the Revalian Kingdom. The ÜSSA Council accepted and the Revalian Kingdom was officially established on 19 September 2020 AD in Tallinn, Snelli Park, in which the manifest of the Revalian Kingdom was first declared. The kingdom declared itself independent from Estonia. The founding fathers of the kingdom were ÜSSA Councilmembers. Today, ÜSSA serves as the Secret Services of the Revalian Kingdom.

Regency Era

After Revalia was declared independent, the now King Sander II was elected the Prime Minister. He also served as the Head of State, in the title of regent. During the now King Sander II's regency, Revalia made big diplomatic developments; signed treaties with many prestigious nations. Proper government institutions were established. On the 14th of March, the Constitution is passed in the Parliament and goes into effect.

Sander II's Reign

On 27 April, Sander II declared himself the King Sander II of Revalia with the total support of the parliament, his cabinet and the Royal Privy Council. Having consulted with his ministers, he appointed Prince Paul as his successor to the position of Prime Minister.

Short Rebellion

On 27 April, when Sander II had just ascended the Throne, His Royal Highness, Prince Indrek, started a short rebellion, stating that Sander II's ascension was unlawful. Prince Indrek gathered a small unarmed force to take over the Royal Palace, but the Trumpetburgh garrison and the 1st Infantry Division, under the command of Colonel Minni of Reemle, managed to defeat the prince's forces. Prince Indrek then apologised and Sander II accepted his apology. No court trial was ever held.

Assassination Attempt

On 25 February 2022, during an extraordinary meeting of the cabinet, an unknown communist terrorist attempted to assassinate King Sander II with a lethal weapon. The attempt failed, because the terrorist was quickly disarmed and later executed by the Police and Border Guard Services.

The legend says that the "Old Man of Lake Ülemiste" (Estonian: Ülemiste vanake) lives in the lake. When anyone meets him, he always asks: "Is Tallinn ready yet?". If the other person answers "Yes, the city is ready.", then the old man will send the lake waters out to cover the city of Tallinn. In this way, if anyone meets this old man, they should answer: "No, the city is not ready. There is a lot of work to do still." In this way the city can be saved.
