        "text": "This article presents the construction of a research topic and the results to date of a study that is part of a current debate in the field of Information Science, involving the delimitation of its core subject matter: information – in its varied concepts – or the document – in its materiality, as part of the institutional order and engenderer of social effects (Frohmann). This study, of a theoretical-conceptual nature, tests the concept/hypothesis of the mode of accreditation and social distribution of knowledge (savoir), grounded in Pierre Nora’s distinction between memory societies and history societies. It analyzes the constitution, functioning and imaginary representations of writing, as a landmark and pillar of historical – or archive – societies, and lays the foundations of the document in processes of legitimation, authority and regimes of truth. This study looks for for the bases for the persistence of the document in the dominant processes of accreditation and social distribution of knowledge (savoir) – and power – in the western world, and thus contributes to enriching this important discussion within the field. It also demonstrates the progress made in research through the theoretical-conceptual contributions of the French school of discourse analysis, which restores the material and historical dimension of meaning, dispelling the illusion of the transparency of language – the basis of the information effect (evidence) and the founding myth of the information field.\n\nThe paper offers a comparative insight into ancient administrative cultures. Using a comparative approach to documentation from three distinct periods of the history of Egypt and the Ancient Near East, from the Iron Age Near East, through Late Antiquity to the early Islamic period, we show how data derived from ancient administrative documents can be juxtaposed, despite their different linguistic and historical backgrounds, in order to highlight aspects of the material that do not necessarily attract attention when a more strictly synchronic approach is adopted. From a methodological point of view, we will use selected text corpora (clay tablets and papyri) for case studies that throw light on the overarching historical questions we wish to address. The two main topics are the importance of the written word in administrative contexts (contributions by Lucian Reinfandt, Heather D. Baker and Sven Tost), and the degree to which central governments mobilized the societal surplus of labour and produce through direct administrative interference at the source, or, indirectly through processes that systematically “outsourced” the task of resource extraction, thereby easing the burden placed on the central government’s administrative resources (contributions by Michael Jursa and Bernhard Palme).\n\nThis paper concerns information dissemination in the Livland province of the Russian Empire at the turn of the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, when its rulers sent their orders to the provincial capital, Riga, by horse post. In Riga they were translated into German, and the ancient network of information dissemination used by the Lutheran Church was engaged. The orders of both the Empire and provincial rulers were delivered to Lutheran pastors, who announced this information to their parishes from the pulpit, speaking in Latvian or Estonian so as to be understood by local peasants (serfs), and allowed the texts to circulate around the manors of the parish. The infrastructure of the information network, its maintenance and threats, the speed of information distribution, information safety and security, and the fight against the delivery of false information are all topics of consideration. It is then concluded that information technology has changed drastically throughout time, but the problems it confronts remain quite similar. KEYWORDS Livland; information dissemination; information security; horse post; perlustration; fake information The progress of civilisation has always been and still is based on the transmission and distribution of information. In the beginning, methods of direct exchange were used, profiting from the recent development of human language. The establishing of communities larger than families created the necessity for the dissemination of information shared by the entire community-behavioural standards, religious beliefs, problems of defence, educational information, or important news. The exchange of information in writing was essential for the emergence of larger states; for them, the speed of information distribution in the entire state became important, especially for delivery of orders from officialdom. The information distribution system that Cyrus II of Persia created for his empire in the sixth century BC is widely recognised as the best of the ancient period. This was a multi-node system that transferred messages from one node to another by couriers on horseback, who each relayed information between two nodes. A rather similar multi-node system-horse post-was developed later in many countries. The present paper considers the system for dissemination and distribution of official information in Livland, now part of Latvia and Estonia; the system that was based on the horse post network functioned well before the appearance of newspapers or other modern means of communication, and it continued to work in later periods. The system informed all people, including peasants (serfs), about the official decisions of the rulers.\n\nThe first known official visitation of parish churches took place in the diocese of Vilnius in 1522, when Bishop John of the Lithuanian Dukes administered the see. Clearly this period witnessed an increase in requirements within the Grand Duchy to inspect documents issued to clerics, lay people and parish churches and engross them in the diocesan record, not just in private notary rolls. There were several reasons for the recording of copies: parchments perished in fires, were destroyed by thieves and assailants, some were used as collateral for financial loans, and so on. Such requirements to engross charters and documents in a central record were included in the 1528 Vilnius Diocesan Statutes, attributed to Bishop John. They are reflected not only in the first known diocesan cartulary (Liber IIb) of 1522 and the Chapter Cartulary (Liber I) from the same decade but also in separate notarial copies, confirmatory acts made at the bishop’s or local priest’s behest, and in books of the Lithuanian Metrica (usually after the monarch confirmed a charter). As the importance of documentation grew, the need also arose to forge texts or recreate lost documents. As an example of this process, it may be worth examining a Losk parish emolument from 9 July 1489, which survives in the original 1489 parchment and two different notarial copies from 1522 and 1524."
