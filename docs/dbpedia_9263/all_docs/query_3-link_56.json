He said that the works of these two both easier and clearer.

Hofmeyr: Partita africana: Hartbreeekrivier, mm.1-6 stimuli which interest me. I try to stay faithful to that response, and do not interrogate myself as to whether it is permissible or fashionable or politically correct to do so. Such questions lead, at best, to a tendency to want to be “acceptable”, and, at worst, to political expediency. Both options seem to me to compromise artistic integrity. For that reason, and because I regard any form of nationalism as potentially harmful, I do not subscribe to the frenzy for “Africanisation” that has inundated South African culture, but there is always the risk that works which include African elements may be seen as jumping on this bandwagon.’ 3 This pragmatic attitude has ensured that Hofmeyr’s output maintains a distinct sense of integrity, irrespective of the political milieu in which it is heard. Delegates at the EPTA conference in Oslo could judge this for themselves, based on a complete performance of his Piano Sonata. Hofmeyr’s Piano Sonata had an interesting premiere that perhaps links it to the conference theme in another way. The work was first performed in March 2012 on the main concourse of Cape Town Central Train Station as part of the public arts festival Infecting the City. The festival aims to engage with the general public in novel ways by curating performances in public spaces. So, in a sense, this music has been music for the ‘folk’ – the common man – from its very first performance. It certainly presents a different window into the influence of folk music on the art music of our time. South African pianist Justin Krawitz joins Fig.4 H.
