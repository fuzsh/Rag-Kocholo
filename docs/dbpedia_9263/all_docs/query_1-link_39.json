        "text": "This paper analyzes the condition of open-air markets in Poland, with particular emphasis on Kraków. The authors note that there are a declining number of open-air markets. The size of the markets is also shrinking and there are a decreasing number of stands. Similarly, survey respondents demonstrate less interest in openair markets as a shopping destination and significantly increased interest in shopping centers (malls), discount stores, supermarkets, and hypermarkets. However, open-air markets have many supporters: in particular, older people appreciate open-air markets, and not only because of the availability of fresh products at a relatively low price. They also appreciate such markets as meeting places. Open-air markets in CEE cities have always played an important commercial role and been witness to the history of these cities. For this reason and also because of the important function they play as unique public spaces, they should be protected and should receive special tre...\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the dimensions and consequences of the fast life through the issues that the agricultural producers and the fresh food market are facing in the urban environment. What is more, it initiates to examine the possibility of the Fresh Food Market being a medium for strengthening the relationship between diverse communities through the alternately sequence of various mix use proposals as to alter the public’s need to spend more time at the Market . With the support of the analysis, the goal is to deliver a clear understanding of the role of the markets in historical and contemporary context, re-establish the relationship, value and meaning of the economic, environmental and social frame of the Fresh Food Market, present a clearer relationship with the city by revitalizing public urban spaces in order to transform it into a central meeting point. Markets are vital elements of a city’s environment, with greater importance than only consumerism and by encouraging and supporting local farmers and production we automatically make positive impact on the environment but also we enhance the local agricultural economy, community health and our quality of life as well. The New establishment of the Fresh Food Market aims to encourage local small business (café, restaurants, bars) to shop locally but most importantly to be informed on why such actions are important to all parties involved (farmers, owners, consumers, environment) and how they could all benefit from such transactions. Such an exchange can establish a stronger relationship between producers and owners but also to minimize the demand for food import, which automatically places us on a lower position on the global food chain. What is more with global competition, industrial food chains and the related health concerns along with the global environmental concerns, markets can contribute to decrease the negative impacts both on public health, local economy and environment. These and other aspects will be further analysed as to understand why a market is not just a market but that behind a banal name underlies a place of bigger symbolism with general contribution to our society. The current farmers issue has proved to be only the pretext to what might be a general problem of the urban reality that Nicosia faces nowadays.\n\nOpen-air markets are traditionally associated with the landscape of Polish towns and cities. In the beginning, they were in the very centre of the city – most often in the market around which the lives of the locals and the newcomers concentrated. With the development of urban areas, open-air markets were moved out of the city centre. They were transformed, though for a long time, also after the Second World War, they were the place of trade primarily in agricultural and craft products. During the People’s Republic of Poland, citizens were given the opportunity to buy goods not available in stores. Open-air market places gained a new meaning at the beginning of the socio-political transformation after 1989. They became the places of flourishing small businesses and were less and less associated with the sale of agricultural products and more and more with diverse assortments such as any groceries, clothing, chemicals and cosmetics. At present, in the period of the global economy, wh..."
