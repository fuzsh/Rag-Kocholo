        "text": "Home\n\nEurope\n\nEstonia\n\nVÃµsu\n\nVÃµsu is a village in Haljala parish, LÃ¤Ã¤ne-Viru County in northeastern Estonia. It has 507 inhabitants (January 1, 2005). Until the local government reform of 2017, VÃµsu belonged to the Vihula Rural Municipality, the main town and administrative seat of which was VÃµsu.\n\nLocation\n\nVÃµsu is located on the southern shore of KÃ¤smu Bay. A sandy beach about one and a half kilometers long leads into the shallow Baltic Sea at this point. The village is surrounded by pine, spruce and fir forests. Lake KÃ¤smu is located near VÃµsu. To the east of the VÃµsu River there used to be Lake ÃllikjÃ¤rv, which was drained in 1886 for the construction of a manor house. Today the site is overgrown with forests.\n\nResort\n\nDue to its ideal location on the Baltic Sea and its good climate, VÃµsu became a well-known resort and seaside resort of the upper class of the Russian Empire in the second half of the 19th century. Visitors came from St. Petersburg, Moscow and even from the Crimea to enjoy the summer freshness. They had about 200 summer houses built at that time. In the summer, the number of guests in the resort went into the thousands.\n\nOnly with the First World War and the independence of Estonia from Russia in 1918 did VÃµsu lose its importance for Russian summer tourism. Today, VÃµsu is again a popular excursion and holiday destination for Estonians and has a good tourist infrastructure by Estonian standards.\n\nHistory\n\nAncient times\n\nIn ancient times, the area around the village belonged to Revala Parish in the north-west of Virumaa. 13. in the century, the coastal plain was apparently uninhabited.\n\nLate Middle Ages and Tsarist times\n\nIt is first mentioned in (am Strande Woso) 3. dated April 1510. Namely, from the mouth to the mouth of the river, the entire area belonged to Palmse Manor. The owner of Palmse Manor at that time was the Nunnery of St. Michael (Mihkli) in Tallinn. 3. in a treaty signed in April 1510, Abbess Elisabeth Brince exchanged Palmse Manor for Nabala Manor and Bertram Junge became the owner of Palmse Manor. In the said contract, the object of transfer is indicated as \"families on the beach of the shoot\". This is the first mention of the scion.\n\n1677. in the year the areas of Palmse Manor came into the possession of the von der Pahlen.\n\n1700. at the beginning of the years, five families from Prussia came to live on the Bush â refugees from the Black Plague. From Baron von der Pahlen of Palmse, they bought land and established farms at the eastern end of the present site, near the river. The names of farms and families are as follows: Reinu-Randmann, Uuetoa-Vogt, Simuna-Licholm, Village tip-Lillemann, Madise-Treimann. The descendants of these families have long considered themselves Estonians by nationality.\n\n1777. in the year the owner of Palmse opened the Inn Hotel de Baltique. There was no current Main Street (Mere Street), and the tavern and its surroundings became the center of the settlement. A means of transport could be rented from the tavern, which was a carriage, Runi or Saab applied after a horse. When cars appeared, an omnibus stop was located at the tavern.\n\nThe trade took place at the tavern. At the tavern under the Pines, the nearby farmers sold farm products directly from their carts. There was a market. There was also a post office near the inn. The mail was delivered by horse-drawn vehicle, sorted and delivered to the addressee. Later, a fire-fighting spray shed was added, and when smuggling was very much underway, a customs post was opened to declare goods coming across the sea. It also organized the activities of the rand Knights to capture the smugglers.\n\nIn the year 1780, there is a mention of the brick building of Palmse Manor. However, stones were produced for the manor itself. 1868. the modern Brickworks with Hoffmann furnaces and a gabled brick Press began work in, and roof tiles were also produced.\n\nSince 1872, the village has been called palmse Manor. The manor was located opposite the brick factory at that time, across the road. There was also a butter factory. Old maps show a lake located in this area-Noble Lake, which was located east of the river. The drainage from there took place through the Jaanioja, which flowed into the Gulf of Finland near the village of Koolimae Hill. The lake was opened for expansion in 1886. discharged into the sea in, its rugged bottom was ditched and turned into farmland. To date, the fields are forested, and only a rather sharp eye catches the traces of former drainage ditches.\n\nFrom 1895 to 1904, the former brickworks was further improved and began to produce 1-2 million bricks per year.\n\nIn the days of the stone factory, the railway was built on a pier by the sea. Along it, bricks were transported in wagons for conveyance to ships waiting at sea. Bricks with the imprinted name PALMS were transported by ships to Russia, Finland, Sweden and Germany. Next to the stone factory, the table factory also delivered. The stone factory's high stone chimney top was stacked as a lace decoration. The chimney slender and beautiful and shone far out to sea. Fishermen and sailors also set the course when the factory was no longer working. The stone factory chimney was demolished in 2007.\n\nAs a summer resort, the opening of the St. PetersburgâPaldiski railway (Baltic railway) in 1870 gave a special impetus to its development. in. Now, in addition to domestic bathing suits, vacationers arrived from Russian cities. They were brought to the railway station by horse-drawn vehicle. The magnets were a beautiful pine forest rich in mushrooms and berries, white beach sand, clean and warm sea water, a river rich in Trout and crayfish, and a kind coastal people. In connection with the abolition of serfdom, the Barons reoriented. They began to sell land. Von der Pahlen, the landlord of Palmse, also mapped the forest area on the site, the main street of the current site (Mere t) towards Kommu. Divided the area into cottage plots, put them up for sale in 1880-1910. The size and location of the plot purchased for the scion, of course, depended on the thickness of the wallet. Logs for the construction of the house became Pines grown on its plot. 1901. the agreement (kontraht) for the purchase of land between von der Pahlen and Herman isop, the landlord of Palmse, has survived to this day. Rakvere notary E. Hunnius 22. a counter affidavit confirmed in June 1901 reveals that H. Isop bought a plot of land in Reute Heath on the offshoot Beach, the size of which is 801 square villages for 279 rubles and 50 kopecks as real property. In today's terms, means that 3,646 m2 of land was purchased from the estate for around 5,500 euros (2017. year currency). Similarly, Merea, Kungla, hope, Vambola, Ranna, Laine, Vabaduse, Kalev, Viru, Eha and Posti streets were inhabited. Since then, the place has been known as a summer resort. In 1893 a post office was established in the village, in 1907 A Society of farmers was founded, in 1910 its own bank was established, in 1912 a Volunteer Fire Brigade Society was founded, several bakers worked, a cafe was opened. There was also a joinery shop, a piltmaker, a watchmaker, several tailors, shoemakers, woodworkers, Potters and masons. 1911. in the year the post house was moved from the former offshoot Centre to the corner of Post and Mere streets. The Telegraph also came there, and a second bus stop was opened. Thus, a new offshoot Center developed. Until World War I, vysu was visited mainly by tourists from Moscow and St. Petersburg, for example, Jakob Hurt, a clergyman and public figure who lived in St. Petersburg, has spent the summer in Vysu on a couple of occasions. There was also a transport connection with Tallinn, both by land and by water. Between 1910 and 1929, the line Tallinn-Kaberneeme-Tsitre-Lohmu-oursu ratasaurik kungla travelled 2 times a week.\n\n20. at the beginning of the century, a summer rental of a three - to eight-room apartment cost forty to one hundred rubles (approx.800-2000 euros in 2017. year currency). There were also several boarding houses on the site, the best known of which was by local entrepreneur and property owner Eduard Langsepp in 1908. \"Langsepa pension\" opened in the year, where, among other things, water treatments were offered. It was also located on the beach, and also E. In the bath house owned by langsepp, mud baths and other health water baths can be taken in addition to warm sea baths. In addition, small bathhouses had also been built, because the ethical standards of that time considered it a shame to show yourself in a bathing suit on the beach. Doctors have once noted that the dry and clean air, temperature and warm sea water of the shoot are supposed to have a healing effect. Before World War I, there were around 3,000 summer residents. After the first World War, the number of holidaymakers decreased several times, starting to rise again only in the 1930s.\n\nPre-World War II period\n\nHaving grown out of a traditional coastal village, where, in addition to the sea and farming, the brick factory of Palmse Manor also allowed service, the identity of the summer resort became dominant in the case of the offshoot. However, it has been badly battered by interruptions and cultural changes. If in the case of Komandmu, World War I meant only a temporary shock, then in the case of Khutsu, World War I irretrievably ruined the whole life of the past â in particular, having been the summer resort of the Russian intelligentsia, it was deprived of a large number of its former vacationers. However, thanks to its proximity to Tallinn, the village fared better than many Eastern summer resorts that never regained their former glory (Sillamae, Sea village, Smolka, etc.).\n\nBy the early days of the Republic of Estonia, the offshoot had become a unique and well-organized small settlement. If before World War I the visitors to the village were mainly German and Russian nobles and the Estonian people did not get much access to the village due to poor traffic conditions and lack of money, the situation changed in 1920. by the beginning of the years, where the first permanent visitors of the shoot emerged among Estonians. In addition to rental apartments, there were 1923. three boarding houses with a total of 32 rooms were opened for the year. Ed was considered better. Langsepale and V. Thomson's. 1923. in the summer, it was possible to choose a ratasaurik kungla leaving Tallinn twice a week or a rental car (three times a week from the current Viru Square stop), a post field leaving Rakvere or a bus every day for driving to Vysu. The 37-km journey from Rakvere to Vysu, which accommodates almost 35 people, took 1 hour and 45 minutes (nowadays it takes less than 30 minutes to complete the same journey).\n\n1930. in the year ratasaurulaev stopped the kungla line trips, but by that time there was already a regular bus service between Tallinn and Vysu, on the Route TallinnâValgejeeâVysuâLohmu, at first under the leadership of Volbrecht tats bus company, later already by Motor Ltd. 1930. by the middle of the year, the bus was travelling from Puddle to Tallinn and Tapa three times a week and to Rakvere on all days of the week.\n\nIn addition to the restaurant Nordala, which was operating in the Old Inn building at the time, a number of new catering and entertainment venues were opened in the village. One of the first opened in 1929. in May, the restaurant Upsala Rakvere restaurateur Albert Ups. There were also three tennis courts and a bowling alley. Rowing and sailing boats and sea kayaks were rented to water sports enthusiasts.\n\nA strong impetus was given to the development of the towns in 1922. the National Building Loans Act, 1930, passed in. there were 550 permanent residents living on the Bush in, there were 160 residential houses, 60 of them cottages. Cottages on the Bushes were built not only by locals, but also by summer residents themselves. The engine and direction of the local economy were mainly summer residents. For example, by the end of April 1938, 75% of the cottages had been rented out, with rental prices ranging from 50 to 200 kroons. 1930. at the end of the years, the average monthly income in Estonia was 60 kroons (for comparison, in 2017 the average income in Estonia was 1221 euros). Food supplies were provided to vacationers by residents of nearby villages and several shops. 1930. in the years, 5 mixed stores, 3 meat Karns, 2 bakeries were open all year round in the Bush. Market days were held twice a week. Next to the townspeople's summer residence, the village also became an important service centre in the nearby area. In the Bush, tailors and seamstresses could sew clothes, order furniture and caskets from joiners, and shoemakers could make and repair shoes according to size. A fine mechanic of the offshoot improved timepieces and made more complex metalwork. A doctor and midwife lived on the Bush, a pharmacy worked.\n\nBefore World War II, Karl August heige (1893-1942) was one of the biggest employers in the area.\n\nThe table factory he owned was located in the old Palmse brick building neighborhood. The sawmill was powered by steam, boards and sleepers were produced from logs, which were scattered not only by cars, but also by ships. The table factory with the stored material was destroyed in 1940. a fire in August. Karl Heige himself was deported to Siberia in 1941 and died in 1942 in the Sverdlovsk region.\n\nIn December 1930, the building of the school burned to the ground. In addition to the school equipment, the property of the headmaster was also destroyed and the damage was estimated at 11,000 kroons. The building was insured in the insurance company \"Eesti Lloyd\" for 10,000 kr. Already in 1932, a new school building was opened, where the school still operates today.\n\nIts popularity as a summer resort grew shortly before World War II. In 1939, for the summer season, Rakvere restaurateur Evald Laks Vysul opened a beach cafe, on the upper floor of which, in addition to other rooms, there were also 10 rooms for renting out to vacationers. To date, the building has been completely destroyed. By the end of the war, the site had become the 5th largest. resort in Estonia. Contemporaries of that time describe how the main street of the summer shoot, Mere Street, seems to be something like Tallinn's Harju or Tartu's Knightly Street, where the annual summer visitors ' acquaintance parade takes place.\n\nThe development of the offshoot also did not go unnoticed and without support from the state. 1939. in the summer of that year, the Institute of Nature Conservation and tourism, which was located at the then Ministry of social affairs, granted a grant of 1,000 kroons for the renovation of the Summer Resort. Of this amount, a new swimming bridge was built with 500 kroons and the old boat bridge was repaired. For 200 kroons, amusement products were made for adults and children. 300 kroons left to clean up the beach.\n\nInfrastructure"
