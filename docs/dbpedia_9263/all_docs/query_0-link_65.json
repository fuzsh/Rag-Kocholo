        "text": "Republication from Norway today\n\nViking swords in Wikimedia commons\n\n.\n\nScandinavia is an archeological hotspot when it comes to Viking discoveries.\n\nBut there’s another Northern European area that has been especially important for Viking finds, too: the Baltic region – and Estonia in particular.\n\nEstonia’s trove of Viking sword fragments\n\nA hoard of sword fragments was found in late autumn of 2018 and it continues to be the largest Viking discovery in Estonia.\n\nAlong with swords, a few spearheads were found, too. Everything has been dated to the mid-900s AD.\n\nThe find spans across two archeological sites, located just 80 meters from one another, on the coast of Northern Estonia. This territory was known in ancient times as Revala. Today, the region is home to Estonia’s capital city, Tallinn.\n\nThought to be grave markers, the unearthed swords are broken into pieces for a reason. A burial custom during this time was putting broken or otherwise unusable weapons (along with other personal items) into graves or placing them as grave markers.\n\nContinue reading\n\n© Periklis Deligiannis 2012-today, All rights reserved\n\nAll images, maps, diagramms etc within this website remain the property of the respective copyright holder.\n\nAll visual and text materials included herein are protected by either implied or statutory copyright and are reproduced either with the permission of the copyright holder or under terms of fair use as defined under current international copyright law.\n\nAll visual materials used in this website without clearance were obtained from public sources through public means and were believed to be in the public domain or available for inclusion via the fair use doctrine at the time of editing"
