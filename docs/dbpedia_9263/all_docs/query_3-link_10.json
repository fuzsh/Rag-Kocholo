        "text": "Estonia - Europe\n\nEstonia facts and history in brief\n\nTallinn\n\nTallinn\n\nExcerpted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nLocation of Tallinn.\n\nTallinn is the capital and largest city of Estonia.\n\nIt occupies a surface of 159.2 km² (61.5 sq mi) in which 406,341 inhabitants live.\n\nIt is situated on the northern coast of the country, on the banks of the Gulf of Finland, 80 km (50 mi) south of Helsinki.\n\nHistorical names\n\nIn 1154 a town called Qlwn or Qalaven (possible derivations of Kalevan or Kolyvan) was put on the world map of the Almoravid by cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi who described it as a small town like a large castle among the towns of Astlanda.\n\nIt has been suggested that the Quwri in Astlanda may have denoted the predecessor town of today's Tallinn.\n\nThe earliest names of Tallinn include Kolyvan (Russian: ????????) known from East Slavic chronicles, the name possibly deriving from the Estonian mythical hero Kalev.\n\nUp to the 13th century the Scandinavians and Henry of Livonia in his chronicle called the town Lindanisa: Lyndanisse in Danish, Lindanäs in Swedish, also mentioned as Ledenets in Old East Slavic.\n\nAccording to some theories the named derived from mythical Linda, the wife of Kalev and the mother of Kalevipoeg, who in an Estonian legend carried rocks to her husband's grave that formed the Toompea hill.\n\nIt has been also suggested that in the context the meaning of linda in the archaic Estonian language, that is similar to lidna in Votic, had the same meaning as linna or linn later on meaning a castle or town in English.\n\nAccording to the suggestion nisa would have had the same meaning as niemi (meaning peninsula in English) in an old Finnish form of the name Kesoniemi.\n\nOther than Kesoniemi known ancient historical names of Tallinn in Finnish include Rääveli.\n\nAfter the Danish conquest in 1219 the town became known in the German, Swedish and Danish languages as Reval (Latin: Revalia).\n\nThe name originated from (Latin) Revelia (Estonian) Revala or Rävala, the adjacent ancient name of the surrounding Estonian county.\n\nModern name\n\nThe origin of the name \"Tallinn(a)\" is certain to be Estonian, although the original meaning of the name is debated.\n\nIt is usually thought to be derived from \"Taani-linn(a)\" (meaning \"Danish-castle/town\"; Latin: Castrum Danorum) after the Danes built the castle in place of the Estonian stronghold at Lindanisse.\n\nHowever, it could also have come from \"tali-linna\" (\"winter-castle/town\"), or \"talu-linna\" (\"house/farmstead-castle/town\").\n\nThe element -linna, like Germanic -burg and Slavic -grad / -gorod, originally meant \"fortress\" but is used as a suffix in the formation of town names.\n\nThe previously used official German name Reval was replaced after Estonia became independent in 19181920.\n\nAt first both forms Tallinna and Tallinn were used.\n\nThe United States Board on Geographic Names adopted the form Tallinn between June 1923 and June 1927.\n\nThe form Tallinna appearing in modern times in Estonian denotes the genitive case of the name, as in Tallinna Reisisadam (Port of Tallinn).\n\nOther variations of modern spellings include Tallinna in Finnish language and Та́ллин in Russian.\n\nA form Tallin deriving from the Romanisation of Russian spelling of the name Та́ллин was also used internationally during the era Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first traces of human settlement found in Tallinn's city centre by archeologists are about 5000 years old.\n\nThe comb ceramic pottery found on the site dates to about 3000 BC and corded ware pottery c. 2500 BC.\n\nIn 1050 the first fortress was built on Tallinn Toompea.\n\nAs an important port for trade between Russia and Scandinavia, it became a target for the expansion of the Teutonic Knights and the Kingdom of Denmark during the period of Northern Crusades in the beginning of the 13th century when Christianity was forcibly imposed on the local population.\n\nDanish rule of Tallinn and Northern Estonia started in 1219.\n\nIn 1285 the city became the northernmost member of the Hanseatic League  a mercantile and military alliance of German-dominated cities in Northern Europe.\n\nThe Danes sold Tallinn along with their other land possessions in northern Estonia to the Teutonic Knights in 1346.\n\nMedieval Tallinn enjoyed a strategic position at the crossroads of trade between Western and Northern Europe and Russia.\n\nThe city, with a population of 8,000, was very well fortified with city walls and 66 defence towers.\n\nA weather vane, the figure of an old warrior called Old Thomas, was put on top of the spire of the Tallinn's Town Hall in 1530 that became the symbol for the city.\n\nWith the start of the Protestant Reformation the German influence became even stronger as the city was converted to Lutheranism.\n\nIn 1561 Tallinn politically became a dominion of Sweden.\n\nDuring the Great Northern War the Swedish troops based in Tallinn capitulated to Imperial Russia in 1710, but the local self-government institutions (Magistracy of Reval and Chivalry of Estonia) retained their cultural and economical autonomy within Imperial Russia as the Duchy of Estonia.\n\nThe Magistracy of Reval was abolished in 1889.\n\nThe 19th century brought industrialization of the city and the port kept its importance.\n\nDuring the last decades of the century Russification measures became stronger.\n\nOn 24 February 1918, the Independence Manifesto was proclaimed in Tallinn, followed by Imperial German occupation and a war of independence with Russia.\n\nOn 2 February 1920, the Tartu Peace Treaty was signed with Soviet Russia, wherein Russia acknowledged the independence of the Estonian Republic.\n\nTallinn became the capital of an independent Estonia.\n\nAfter World War II started, Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1940, and later occupied by Nazi Germany from 194144.\n\nAfter Nazi retreat in 1944, it was occupied by the USSR again.\n\nAfter annexation into the Soviet Union, Tallinn became the capital of the Estonian SSR.\n\nDuring the 1980 Summer Olympics, the sailing, then known as yachting events were held at Pirita, north-east of central Tallinn.\n\nMany buildings, like the hotel \"Olümpia\", the new Main Post Office building, and the Regatta Center, were built for the Olympics.\n\nIn August 1991 an independent democratic Estonian state was re-established and a period of quick development to a modern European capital ensued.\n\nTallinn became the capital of a de facto independent country once again on August 20, 1991.\n\nTallinn has historically consisted of three parts:\n\n* The Toompea (Domberg) or \"Cathedral Hill\", which was the seat of the central authority: first the Danish captains, then the komturs of the Teutonic Order, and Swedish and Russian governors.\n\nIt was until 1877 a separate town (Dom zu Reval), the residence of the aristocracy; it is today the seat of the Estonian government and many embassies and residencies.\n\n* The Old Town, which is the old Hanseatic town, the \"city of the citizens\", was not administratively united with Cathedral Hill until the late 19th century.\n\nIt was the centre of the medieval trade on which it grew prosperous.\n\n* The Estonian town forms a crescent to the south of the Old Town, where the Estonians came to settle.\n\nIt was not until the mid-19th century that ethnic Estonians replaced the local Baltic Germans as the majority amongst the residents of Tallinn.\n\nHistorically, the city has been attacked, sacked, razed and pillaged on numerous occasions.\n\nAlthough extensively bombed by Soviet air forces during the latter stages of World War II, much of the medieval Old Town still retains its charm.\n\nThe Tallinn Old Town (including Toompea) became a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site in 1997.\n\nAt the end of the 15th century a new 159 m high Gothic spire was built for St. Olaf's Church.\n\nBetween 1549 and 1625 it was the tallest church in the world.\n\nAfter several fires and following rebuilding, its overall height is now 123 m.\n\nTallinn\n\nFlag Coat of arms\n\nTallinn Coordinates: 59°26'14?N 24°44'43?E\n\nCountry: Estonia\n\nCounty: Harju County\n\nFirst appeared on map: 1154\n\nGovernment: - Mayor Edgar Savisaar (November 2009)\n\nArea:\n\n- Total 159.2 km² (61.5 sq mi)\n\nPopulation: (Nov 1, 2009)\n\n- Total 406,341\n\n- Density 2,549.4/km² (6,492.8/sq mi)\n\nTime zone: EET (UTC+2)\n\n- Summer (DST) EEST (UTC+3)\n\nWebsite: www.tallinn.ee\n\nPhotos courtesy: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - Many thanks - Editor - Click for an enlargement.\n\nSt. Catherine's Passage Viru Gate, entrance\n\nto the Old Town.
