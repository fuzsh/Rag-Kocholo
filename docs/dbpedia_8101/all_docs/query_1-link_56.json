        "text": "All You Need To Know About Penile Cancer; Signs&Symptoms (must read)\n\nCancer Research UK said 95% of penile cancers develop from slow growing squamous cell carcinomas so catching penile cancer early is key to recovery, yet many men don’t know the sings to look out for.\n\nWhile most men know all about prostate and testicular cancer symptoms, many people don’t have the same awareness penile cancer.\n\nSigns and symptoms of penile cancer\n\nYou should be aware of any abnormalities or signs of penile cancer, including:\n\n1. A growth or sore on the penis that doesn’t heal within four weeks\n\n2. Bleeding from the penis or from under the foreskin\n\n3. A foul smelling discharge\n\n4.

Men who carry the human papilloma virus (HPV)\n\n2. Age is also a risk factor for cancer of the penis – it’s more common in men over 60\n\n3.

They’ll also examine your penis for signs of penile cancer.\n\nIf they suspect penile cancer, they may refer you to a specialist – usually a urologist.\n\nThe specialist will ask about your symptoms, they may also take a blood test and carry out a biopsy.\n\nHow is penile cancer treated?\n\nIn cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS), where only the skin cells of the penis are affected, patients will be treated using chemotherapy cream or laser surgery.\n\nThe main treatments for more advanced penile cancer are:\n\n1. Surgery\n\n2. Radiotherapy\n\n3. Chemotherapy\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWow!Checkout The i.Con Smart Condom: It Tracks Your Performance And Detects STDs\n\nIn what seems like the ‘world’s first smart condom’ a company in the UK has designed the “i.Con”— which uses nano chip technology to measure performance and detect STIs.\n\nThe i.Con device uses a nano-chip and sensors to catalog numerous variables during sex — including duration of intercourse, calories burnt, the “average velocity” and the total number of thrusts per session and then relay the information to a smartphone app via Bluetooth.\n\nOnce the user is done doing the deed, the data from their session is loaded onto their phone — either through the i.Con app or micro-USB port. The Smart Condom also tells you how you stack up to other people from around the world.\n\nAccording to British Condoms, “All data will be kept anonymous but users will have the option to share their recent data with friends, or, indeed, the world. You will be able to anonymously access stats that you can compare with i.Con users worldwide.”\n\nAnd if you want to charge it up, just use the micro USB port on the device, that you can plug into your computer or mains.\n\nHowever, despite the name, the device is not actually a condom. Rather, it’s a ring that will sit over a condom at the base, which you can use over and over again.\n\nThe i.Con smart condom is described as a wearable, micro-USB charged condom ring that can provide six to eight hours of “live” usage.\n\nIt will also log other info pertaining to one’s health, such as calories burned and average skin temperature. British Condoms also claims that the i.Con can work as an STI indicator, thanks to its “antibodies filter” — which alerts the user when proteins or antigens, typically found in STIs, are detected.\n\nAccording to industry reports, each device is made from synthetic rubber and contains a waterproof carbon fiber unit, which holds the nano-chip and sensors.\n\nThe manufacturers say it will be made in one size, with a band adjustment feature. “It is extremely comfortable, water resistant and lightweight, you won’t even know it’s there ensuring maximum pleasure and, peace of mind.”\n\nIn the product’s description on the British Condoms website, the company asks:\n\n“Have you ever wondered how many calories you’re burning during intercourse?”\n\n“How many thrusts? Speed of your thrusts? The duration of your sessions? Frequency? How many different positions you use in the period of a week, month or year? Ever wondered how you stack up to other people from around the world? Welcome to the future of wearable technology in the bedroom.”\n\nThe i.Con is currently in the final stages of testing before its release later this year. Though it’s unclear when the product will be fully ready, the manufacturers say it is currently available for preorder.\n\nBritish Condoms said the project brought new meaning to the term “wearable tech” – and that nearly 100,000 people have pre-registered for the product.\n\nAccording to Adam Leverson, lead engineer on the i.Con project: “Not only have we innovated the world’s first smart condom ring that’ll measure pretty much every aspect of performance in the bedroom, but now I’m pleased to confirm that it will also have built-in indicators to alert the users to any potential STIs present.”\n\n↧\n\n250,000 Kebbi State Farmers To Be Made Millionaires By Year End With Rice Farming\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has revealed that no less than 250,000 Kebbi farmers will be made millionaires by the end of 2017.\n\nThis was disclosed by the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele when he visited the WACOT Rice Factory in Argungu on Thursday. Addressing the farmers, Emefiele said:\n\n“I was told by a permanent secretary that 88,000 millionaires had been created through rice and agricultural revolution. I am assuring you that by the end of this year, 200,000 to 250,000 farmer millionaires will be created through the revolution.”\n\nEmefiele lauded WACOT Limited for the feat, adding that the mill will save the country substantial amount of foreign exchange that would have gone into rice importation. He also assured the farmers that government will continue to do everything to ensure that their products are sold.\n\nEmefiele also commended the Emir of Argungu, Alhaji Sama’ila Mere, for providing land for the company and for his desire to stimulate the agricultural revolution in the country.\n\nThe CBN boss also called on other royal fathers to emulate the monarch’s desire to drive the agricultural revolution in the country.\n\nIn the same vein, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Audu Ogbeh, applauded the focus of the Kebbi State government on Agriculture, and expressed optimism that farmers in the state, will soon receive national recognition.\n\nHe, however, underscored the need for other states in the country to use the agricultural best practices of Kebbi as a benchmark, while embracing farming as a sustainable means of wealth creation, promotion of food sufficiency and economic development in the country.\n\nHe added that for the country to have lasting security, there must be a concerted effort by all tiers of government to tackle the twin issues of food security and unemployment, as youth unemployment could be a time bomb for the country.\n\nChief Ogbeh stated that the Federal Government will continue to encourage and support organizations such as WACOT, in its efforts to enhance and stabilize food production in the country. He commended WACOT for having faith in Kebbi State and Nigeria.\n\nGovernor Bagudu also commended the management of WACOT for locating the mill in his State and for completing it within a short period.\n\nBagudu said, “what WACOT has done shows that Nigeria has friends and a friend in need is a friend indeed”, adding that WACOT is investing in Kebbi because the state has created the enabling environment for business to thrive.\n\nAccording to the Governor, once the WACOT Mill starts full operation, a large part of the rice cultivated in the State will be processed within the state, instead of being taken elsewhere for milling. He also used the opportunity to reiterate the fact that Kebbi state is endowed with massive arable land, fit for production of rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, groundnut etc.\n\nThe rice processing mill with a 120,000 metric tonne capacity was established in Argungu, Kebbi State by WACOT Rice Limited, a member of the TGI Group as part of national efforts to boost food security and employment.\n\nThe rice mill is part of WACOT’s expansion plan, which targets a capacity increase with additional rice plants to overall 500,000 metric tonnes in the next years.\n\nLocated in Argungu Local Government Area, along the Argungu-Sokoto road, the rice processing plant is the first rice mill to be conceptualized, executed and to be commissioned during the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Work started on the Mill in February 2016 and is scheduled to be formally commissioned in May, 2017.\n\nWACOT’s Chief Executive Officer, Rahul Savara, disclosed that the rice factory would generate 3,500 jobs and engage the services of 6,000 farmers.\n\nHe said that the rice factory was capable of producing 120 tonnes of rice daily, adding it could also generate one megawatt of electricity. He commended the state government and other stakeholders for partnering with WACOT Rice Factory.\n\n↧\n\nNew Discovery Says: Avoid Eating These 4 Leftovers At All Cost If You Love Your Health\n\nLeftovers are easy to reheat and can be consumed quickly. However, reheating meals is not so harmless.\n\nAccording to experts, there are some foods which should never be reheated if you want to protect your health.\n\nThere are foods that can be reheated multiple times, but also foods that should never be warmed up again. Consuming some reheated leftovers can serious harm your health, so make sure to avoid the 4 following leftovers:\n\nVEGETABLES\n\nStoring vegetables improperly or reheating them is not only dangerous – it can even be fatal! According to the Center for Food Safety, leftover vegetables should always be stored at -4 C. If you plan on storing them for longer, freeze them. Spinach, beets, lettuce and celery contain high levels of nitrates which can accumulate if the vegetables are exposed to room temperature and cause numerous problems. According to studies, nitrate can cause methemoglobinemia in children, a rare blood disorder which causes symptoms such as seizures, shortness of breath and fatigue.\n\nVEGETABLE OIL\n\nReheating meals made with vegetable oils is highly dangerous and has been linked with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer. According to recent studies, reheating polyunsaturated oils that contain linoleic acid (sunflower oil, canola and corn oil) releases 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE), a toxin derived from fatty acids which can harm your health. This toxic compound has been linked to heart disease, liver problems, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and some types of cancer. Vegetable oils are meant to be used only one time, and should never be heated to the point of releasing smoke.\n\nCHICKEN\n\nChicken meat contains a lot of protein, so when it’s heated for a second time, its composition alters to a more dangerous one. Reheating cold chicken meat is allowed only if the inside of the meat is very hot. This is particularly important if you’re using a microwave, which sometimes doesn’t heat meals evenly. Also, you should know that chicken meat can be consumed for up to 2 days, and not a second more.\n\nRICE\n\nRice should be stored properly if you want to stay healthy. The Food Standard Agency says that uncooked rice contains spores of harmful bacteria which can survive the first cooking process.\n\nIf the rice is then stored at room temperature, these spores will multiply and cause numerous digestive problems. The spores can even survive the reheating, which is why experts recommend eating all the rice you’ve cooked at once.\n\nIf there are leftovers, freeze them instead of keeping the rice in your fridge until tomorrow.\n\n↧\n\nBeauty Of The Day: Meet This Nigerian Mother & Her Adorable Quadruplets Who Are All Boys(Beautiful Photos)\n\nHere are pictures of a Nigerian woman, her quadruplets who are all boys and her daughter.

She is regarded as one of the most popular actress in Kannywood and a good role model as she appears to be highly cultured and well dressed.\n\nEARLY LIFE AND BACKGROUND\n\nBorn in Libreville, Republic of Gabon, Hadiza Aliyu is the daughter of Malam Aliyu who is an elder statesman. On her father’s side, Hadiza is of Gabonese descent, and on her mother’s side, she is of Fulani ancestry. Hadiza Aliyu attended primary and secondary schools in her birth country were she wrote her A Level examination with an aspirations to become a lawyer and later chose Law as her favourite degree course. She started her University year as a student, but had to dropped out of school due to some issues that trailed her studies. Her education was halted then and that gave her the opportunity to attend a diploma program in French Language and later became a French language teacher in a private school.\n\nWhen askedas an actress in Kannywood what are some of the challenges she has faced with, she replies;\n\nEverything one intends to do in life, definitely you must come across little challenge, like I earlier said, the greatest challenge I faced was the language barrier. I had to learn the language that is not mine entirely and it wasn’t an easy task. At that time, the only language I could speak when I came into Nigeria was Fulani and French. Asides that there have really not been any tiring challenges, unless if you count the stress that comes with being an actress. But then in life nothing good comes easy.\n\nCAREER AND LIFE\n\nHadiza Aliyu moved to Kaduna, Nigeria upon developing interest to join Kannywood with her cousin. She then met with Ali Nuhu and sought for his assistance in launching her acting career where she first featured in Artabu movie in 2009.\n\nHadiza Gabon lights up a picture whenever she comes across either as a lead or supporting actress in some of those critically acclaimed Kannywood (as the movie industry up North is called) movies. The large Kannywood crowd cheer at her whenever her name appears on a movie credit line. Ask for the natural beauty and magnetic star that has proved that she is good at what she is doing and fingers will point to the Kannywood shinning star Hadiza Aliyu who is popular as Hadiza Gabon.\n\nShe Was Born and raised in Gabon to a father who is a Gabonese and a Fulani mum who is from Mubi in Adamawa State, Hadiza whose close friends describe as genial, well mannered, cultured and good dressed, had her early education in Gabon where she studied and was awarded a diploma in French.\n\nHadiza joined Kannywood not too long after she arrived Nigeria. She had a chance encounter with top Kannywood actor Ali Nuhu who encouraged her to give acting a shot after the actress who described Ali Nuhu as her ‘brother, mentor and adviser,’ had sought his assistance to launch out as an actress. With the help and guidance of Ali Nuhu and later Aminu Sherrif whom she named as one of her mentors, Hadiza got her break in Kannywood as one of the leading ladies in the urban telling Zaman Take.\n\nShe rode on the back of the success of that movie and a few others after it to become a darling of the movie crowd. “Everything worked out for me as planned. No one harassed me and no one ask me for anything before I was given a role. Meanwhile, I have heard all sorts before I joined Kannywood. But all the negative things I heard about Kannywood turned out to be untrue”, She says she said Greatly adored and admired by fans and regarded by fans as one of Kannywood’s hottest actresses, Hadiza’s parents never objected to her following her dream. Hadiza disclosed that her parents gave her all the support and were pleased with her decision to pursue a career in acting.\n\n“They supported me wholeheartedly and I am happy and more relaxed here because Gabon shares a lot of things in common with Nigeria. The only difference is that we speak mainly French in Gabon. I feel at home here and I thank God for how easily I was accepted by the people in Kannywood and my fans,” ahe enthused. Star of Yar Maye, Akrizzana, Bada Ba Rai, Basaja, Daga Ni Sai Ke, Umarni n Uwa, Wata Tafi Wata, and Ziyadat, Hadiza says she has lost count of the number of movies she has featured in.\n\nBut she picked ‘Ban sani Ba’ and ‘Wasila’ as her most memorable movie run. “They are the first set of movies I took part in.\n\nI recall that I was very scared on those sets and that was because I was still learning to speak Hausa then”, she said. But did Hadiza follow her dream because of the financial reward? “No” she snapped. “Money is secondary even though it is necessary. But it’s the fulfillment I get and the joy that I followed my dream that comes first for me. Besides, acting is my passion. Money is good, I mean I get paid and I am comfortable and I can pay my bills. But it is not the basic reason I am in it. I am just passionate about acting. I am happy in it and I am happy that I was fortunate to gain the confidence of top directors and producers in Kannywood”.\n\nHadiza was asked if she is in any relationship and the star of Daina Kuka, Dare Daya, Farar Saka and Fatake n Dare would do anything to parry the question. “I like my privacy a lot and would not want to begin to talk about that aspect of my life here. But I know where you are headed and all I will say is that Allah’s time is the best,” she offers. But is she pained when some fans get beyond just the usual admiration? She smiles and replies:“Ha, no. I don’t get pained and that is because I have devised a subtle way to keep them in check. I have received some very outrageous proposals from people who think actresses are cheap or don’t know what they want in life or that we can do anything for money. Sometimes they see you playing a wayward girl and they think you are wayward in real life.\n\nAWARDS AND ENDORSEMENTS\n\nWon 2013Kwankwasiyya AwardKwankwasiyya Award presented by His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Kano State, Eng.

God blessed me with a lot of talents.”\n\nShe adds that though her Lagos-based father, who she describes as a ‘big and well successful businessman’ inspired her to study Accounting, neither he nor her (Adunni’s) mum has any problem with her love for show business.\n\n“My father supports me 100 per cent. My mum is very proud of me. Americans don’t care about this kind of thing. They support their children in whatever they choose to do. So, I have no problem building a dream in the entertainment industry. The fact is that I have never been a copycat. I am not looking for the fastest way to limelight. Rather, I want to express myself. My ambition is to be recognised worldwide. But I want to be known for what I have done. I want to be successful through hard work.”\n\nPERSONALLY SPEAKING ON HER BACKGROUND IN AN INTERVIEW:\n\nCan you tell us about your background?\n\nMy father is from Lagos, Badagry, my mum is from Kentucky. I had my primary school education at Chrisland, Opebi and my secondary at Comprehensive school in Sango-Ota. Afterwards I traveled back to the states where I studied accounting at the University of Kentucky before I came back to Nigeria. I didn’t come back right away, it was like 10-11 years afterwards, but before then I had started my career in the entertainment industry as a model and an actress. So, I would say I have been in the entertainment industry for 10 years.\n\nWhat year did you finish from Kentucky?\n\nI finished in 2008 because along the line, I got pregnant so I had to take a break from school but I got back to school as soon as I had rested well and able to resume classes.\n\nCAREER AND LIFE\n\nWhile she was in America, she dabbled into modelling and made it as far as America’s Next Top Model. She made her debut into the Nigerian movie industry around 2013 when she started uploading her skits online. Her first movie is You or I produced by Saheed Balogun.\n\nHer video skit, Date Gone Bad, released on Youtube about 10 days ago, has attracted so much attention that it has recorded over 100,000 hits.\n\nThat sounds very cool for an actress to entrench herself in aiming the Nigeria’s star-studded movie industry.\n\nAdunni who is very surprised at the turnout of the comedy skit says “I must say I am shocked at the kind of attention the skit has got,” “I knew it would be good, but I did not imagine it would get up to this level.”\n\nAdunni first attracted attention when she featured in Saidi Balogun’s movie, You or I, Fred Idika’s Behind the Cloud (a TV series), Dereck Obasi’s Babatunde Diaries and a new film by Desmond Elliot – Rosemary Roses. Besides, the graduate of Accounting from the University of Kentucky, USA, also featured in Sound Sultan’s music video, Kokose, while she did same for Ice Prince last September.\n\nWhile Adunni says she does not give attention to men when they make suggestive moves to her – say, on location – she enthuses that everyone welcomes her at work. But when asked emphatically if men have been making all kinds of advances to her, she says, “Obviously!”\n\nSpeaking on how she became fluent in Yoruba, Adunni explains that from day one, she has always been a fan of culture.\n\n“I believe you must embrace who you are. I don’t understand why anybody will want to say, ‘I try to run away from who I am’. You have to be yourself. You have to be proud of yourself. That is why I want to speak Yoruba at every opportunity I have – even when I am in the US.”\n\nSPEAKING ABOUT HERSELF AND CAREER:\n\nYou have two kids and fans have wondered about your relationship status.\n\nI don’t hide because it’s a part of me and I don’t think there’s any need to lie or make myself look good but I have never been married. I was with my ex, my children’s father Michael Boyd, for eight years and things did not work out and I just let it go and that has been three years ago.\n\nKnowing about the ups and downs in the Nigerian movie industry, how do you intend to cope?\n\nWhere in the world would you go and not see things having its own ups and downs? It’s not all going be a bed of roses, there are bound to be challenges here and there. But I always say this as well, I don’t see anything as a challenge, I always see it as part of life. You go through things whether good or bad to achieve whatever you want to achieve in life. So if something is not working out at that moment, you just have to make another way. Make it work and make it better and you keep moving.\n\nWhich Nigerian movie did you first feature in?\n\nActually, my first movie in Nollywood was a Yoruba movie produced by Saheed Balogun, You or I. At that time I had not relocated to Nigeria. I actually flew in to shoot the movie and when I was done shooting I went back.\n\nWhat were the challenges you faced at the start of your career?\n\nTo be honest I don’t see anything as \"ups and downs,\" I just see it as part of life. But if you want me to mention, maybe the accessibility to contacts of producers or directors because things of that nature, it can be tough, at least for a “new comer”. Still, I think when you work and do your job well you won’t need to look for anybody, people will look for you.\n\nDid you at any point think you would feature in Yoruba movies?\n\nI do both Yoruba and English movies but I do more of English. Out of 40 movies that I have featured in, I think Yoruba has actually been three or four . Early this year, I worked with Toyin Aimakhu on her movie Iya Ibadan and it was a great experience. Last year in Ekiti state, I also worked with daddy Jide Kosoko.\n\nAside acting, is there any other thing you are involved in?\n\nYes, I am a model and that’s my 24/7 job, which is going to be there forever. I have little things that I do by the side as well. I still work with my father once in a while. He is a business man and the CEO of Westman Nigeria Limited. I just contribute my quota by helping him set up appointments with clients and gain new clients as well for the company.\n\nShe also disclosed why she lived with her baby daddy without getting married to him and why she is still a single mum.\n\nAdunni Ade said: “I have said this, it’s not something I want to hide, it’s a part of me and I don’t think there’s any need to lie, or make myself look good or whatever, but I have never been married. I was with my ex, Michael Boyd, who is my children’s father for eight years, and things did not work out and I just let it go and that has been three years ago.” The light-skinned actress further disclosed that she is a sucker of love and that is why it takes her time before she gets into any relationship.\n\nAdunni continued: “I’m a sucker for love, I love hard, that is why I take my time before diving into any relationship with the person I will love. I will do whatever I can in a relationship to make it work because I just don’t get involved with people anyhow. If the chemistry or connection is not there, then you would never find me there. But in my heart, if I feel like I have a connection with that person, I’d try and take it as far as I can and if I know it’s not going to work, I’d end it quick. But I am a big fan of love, Love is good. There is still some love out there even though people try to deny and say there is no more love; there is still love.”\n\nOn her source of motivation, Adunni disclosed that her two children inspire a lot. She added that there is nothing shameful about being a single mother and ready to face whatever music the society attaches to it.\n\nAduni and Kids\n\nSOURCES: stargist.com,naij.com,mycelebrityandi.com,takemetonaija.com\n\n↧\n\nThe Eko Atlantic Project, 2017 update photos and What to know\n\nEko Atlantic, officially Nigeria International Commerce city, also known as Eko Atlantic City, or the initials E.A.C. and E.A., is a planned city of Lagos State, Nigeria, being constructed on land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean.Upon completion, the new peninsula, which is still under development is anticipating at least 250,000 residents and a daily flow of 150,000 commuters. The development will also have a positive environmental impact, as it will help in stopping the erosion of Lagos State's coastline.\n\nThe city adjoins Victoria Island district of Lagos city and the Phase 1 area of Lekki, to the north, while the entire Western, eastern and southern borders is a coastline. Eko Atlantic is expected to rise as the next generation of property on the African continent; having a total of 10 districts, spread across a land area of approximately 10 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi), the city will satisfy needs for financial, commercial, residential and tourist accommodations, with a state of the art high tech infrastructure in line with modern and environmental standards.\n\nEko Atlantic development is being carried out as a Public–private partnership, with private companies and investors providing the funding, whilst Lagos State Government is a strategic partner, with the support of the Federal Government. The Contractors are China Communications Construction Group, a company that works in the field of marine dredging and landfill operation. Consultants are Royal Haskoning (traffic and transport expertise) and ar+h Architects. South Energyx Nigeria Ltd. a subsidiary of the Chagoury group was specifically created to undertake the development. Testing of the sea defence system took place at the DHI Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark, where models were successfully tested for one-in-a-hundred-year ocean surges, and one-in-120-year, one-in-150-year and one-in-1,000-year storms.\n\nSEE ALL PHOTOS:\n\nEko Atlantic City, one of the world’s most advanced new cities being built adjacent to the Victoria Island in Lagos, has made significant progress in its infrastructural development (for phases I and II) as it has completed 14 bridge structures in just two years. The bridges, built to international standards, within phases one and two, extend to over five million square metres representing half of the entire planned city development. Work on the bridge project commenced in December 2014 when the first bridge deck was cast and the last bridge project completed on schedule in December 2016. Phases I and II of the city, which is divided into eight districts (Harbour Lights, Business Districts, Eko Drive, Marina, Ocean Front, Down Town, Eko Energy Estate and Avenues), is planned for mixed-use with commercial, residential, entertainment and leisure activities to make the city a 24/7 lively environment. With the new bridges, all the districts are now accessible by road. The bridge works have enabled all major avenues to overpass the canal system running through the spine of the project. All the bridges are between 2-8 lanes. For instance, Bridge 7 comprises a six-lane carriageway and is located on Avenue 1, thus defining the western boundary of the Business District, the commercial heartland of the city. Spanning 52 metres overall in three sections, Bridge 7 is typical of the design utilised throughout all bridges and comprises a reinforced concrete cast in-situ deck with concrete piers and abutments. The last bridge was deliberately constructed to overpass the canal entrance to the South West Marina, defining the marine access to the Atlantic Ocean. Mr. David Frame, Managing Director of South Energyx Nigeria Limited (SENL), a subsidiary of the Chagoury Group said, “We are fully committed to ensuring that the project is completed on schedule. With the successful completion of all the bridges, all the major avenues within Phase 1 and 2 of the city are now fully interconnected, with the comprehensive road network of the city defined and all zones accessible.” It would be recalled that the city in November last year unveiled the first of the Eko Pearl Towers, a residential building in its Marina District. The commissioning of the tower which was done by the Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, came some months after the commissioning of the city’s Eko Boulevard, Nigeria’s first eight-lane city road.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n6 Ways Red Wine Can Be Beneficial To Your Health (must read)\n\nUnknown to many, red wine has several health benefits. Red wine consumption goes beyond casual drinking and/or for the purpose of intoxication.\n\nYou can include red wine in your dinner, either as a sauce or complimentary ingredient, and still reap its benefits.\n\nHere are six ways red wine can be beneficial to your health.\n\n1. Slows ageing\n\nRed wine is rich in resveratrol, a compound found on the skin of red grapes.\n\nA new study, led by researchers at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute, has found evidence that resveratrol can protect neural connections in the brain and muscle fibres from the adverse effects of ageing.\n\n2. Protects the heart\n\nThe antioxidants found in red wine help to keep the blood vessels flexible and also aid in reducing bad cholesterol.\n\n3. Reduces risk of breast cancer\n\nChemicals found in the seeds of red grapes reduce oestrogen levels in pre-menopausal women which help prevent breast cancer.\n\n4. Protects the skin from sun\n\nResearch has shown that red wine contains compounds which aid in protecting the skin from sun damage and also promotes the skin from firmness.\n\n5.

He's been doing great ever since\n\nEARLY LIFE AND BACKGROUND\n\nSadiq Sani Sadiq was born in Unguwar Gangare, in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. He did his primary school in Gangare, while he had my secondary school education in Jos. From there he went to School of Continuous Education, University of Jos, where he had his diploma in journalism before venturing into film acting.\n\nSPEAKS MORE ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND:\n\nWhat was the attraction for you to join the Hausa movie industry?\n\n\"To be honest I started nursing the ambition of becoming a film star since my secondary school days. So, it is the interest I have in the profession that gave me the push to join the Hausa movie industry. Again, I have a friend with whom we schooled together; he is now a director called Bello Muhammad Bello. He has been recording films since when we were in school, that also influenced me to a great extent. And when I started I realised that it is much more than just interest; it is actually something through which I can earn a living and even take care of my dependants.\"\n\nCAREER AND LIFE\n\nWithin the shortest possible time, Sadiq, also known as Gambo Uban-Tani, created a niche for himself and registered his name among the A-list stars in Kannywood, which earned him HENNA-BALL awards as Kannywood's BEST ACTOR 2012. In this chat with AL-AMIN CIROMA, the Kannywood Hero spoke about his journey in the Hausa film genre and his achievements so far.\n\nAt least, he has featured in about 50 films that have been released into the market.\n\nIn an interview he mention out of the films he's starred in the one he loves most is ‘Yan Uwan Juna’.\n\n\"The reason why I like that film is because I appeared as Hassan and Hussain, a double role. We were born twins. One is physically challenged and calm, very simple. The other is able-bodied, quick to temper and troublesome. I have never acted like that in my entire career.\"He says.\n\nHis first film is called ‘Nas’; the second which was an English film is called ‘Beats of Pain’ which he did under Lenscope Media Company in Jos. The film series aired on television. There are also ‘Masarufi’, ‘Haraba’, ‘Su’al’, ‘Haula’, ‘Sarki’, ‘Ga Zara Ga Wata’, ‘Maryam Diyana’, ‘Yan Uwan Juna’, ‘Dan Marayan Zaki’, ‘Adamsy’, ‘Hadarin Gabas’.\n\nSPEAKS MORE ABOUT HIMSELF AND THE INDUSTRY:\n\nWhat are the challenges you are facing as an actor?\n\n\"Challenges are a reality of life, no matter what endeavour you are into. I have faced so many challenges in filmmaking; the one I cannot easily forget is the one that led to my incarceration. What actually happened was that, at a time I was trying to find my footing in the Hausa film industry, I was involved in a controversy while I was living in Kaduna. Some people recorded a song in which they defamed the Governor of Sokoto State, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko. Initially they alleged that the song was done by Adam A. Zango. And that time we were sitting inside Adam A. Zango’s company known as Zango Movietone, when some security operatives came looking for him (Adam A. Zango) and didn’t find him, but they met, Zahradeen A. Sani, Hamza M. Adam and Hafsat Suleiman (a female radio journalist based in Kaduna) and myself. They arrested and took us all to a police station, before they took us to court. Eventually, they took us to prison where we spent days before we were freed.\n\nI had to endure a lot of abuse and maltreatment but in the end, with tenacity and perseverance as well as loyalty, I am now a force to reckon with.\"\n\nSome say Hausa actors are promoting immorality instead of addressing them. What is your take on this?\n\n\"Well, you know it has to do with perception. People perceive things differently. You don’t just label allegations against people. What I want to say is, if truly you are morally sound, and educated in both modern and religious knowledge, you will understand. I want people to take Indian, American, Ghanaian films or even those from the south and compare them with Hausa films and see if really Hausa films are promoting immorality. Take 20 houses in Nigeria, you will find like 10 watching one of those films I mentioned earlier. So ask them, which films are promoting immorality.\n\nI want our viewers to appreciate the fact that all the Hausa movies they see us do are being built on our attitude, culture and religion. They should understand that what we are doing is to identify a trend, develop it into a story and pass a message to the viewers so that we can collectively address that trend. If I appear in a film as a cheat or an addict, that does not mean I am into those negative habits. No, what it means is that I am trying to pass a message to the viewers to know the ills associated with such acts. I may therefore behave as a cheat or an addict, but that is where it ends. So if you are from a good home, and you watch those acts, you will move further away from such vices. Same thing if you are from a bad home. So people should know that we are enlightening the people not exposing them to immoral acts. We are actually discouraging not promoting immorality.\"\n\nSadiq Sani Sadiq, got married to Murja Shema, the younger sister of the Governor of Katsina State, Shehu Shema in 2013.\n\nThe three-week wedding ceremony which stated on March 2 was extravagant witnessing a football and a polo match. The entire members of the Kannywood industry stool still for the event. At the wedding fatiha (ceremony), the brother of the bride and Governor of Katsina State, Shehu Shema, prayed for the bride and groom and wished them a happy married life.\n\nThe groom, popularly called Dan Marayan Zaki, a role he played in what is at the moment the most expensive movie ever produced in the Kannywood, said his marriage will not stop him from acting.\n\n“My wife likes what I am doing; and she is not complaining,” he told PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nThe actor told his fans to expect a lot more from him.\n\nSadiq, who came to limelight recently, got the lead role in movies like the Danmarayan Zaki, a film that featured Kannywood big actors and actresses.\n\nHe also featured in one of the best selling movies of Kannywood, Wani Gari. According to a movie marketer, Wani Gari is the Hausa movie with the highest number of sales in a long while.\n\nSadiq and Wife\n\nSOURCES: premiumtimesng.com,diddigi.blogspot.com.ng,takemetonaija.com\n\n↧\n\nTop Ten Beautiful & Sexiest Young Nollywood Actresses 2017\n\nHello readers, T.I.N Magazine brings to you something different this time.

It is not possible to mention all of them.\n\nWe look at the ten of them, hoping that their combined story and tragedy would stir something in you, if not to make you want to die for Nigeria but to make you want to live for Nigeria and live honourably.\n\n1. Stella Adadevoh\n\nNigerian much-acclaimed victory over Ebola in 2014 is synonymous with the name Stella Adadevoh. She was the physician who treated Patrick Sawyer, the infamous Liberian who brought Ebola into Nigeria. She diagnosed him with Ebola and isolated him, a move that is credited to have saved Nigeria from the scourge.\n\nMr Sawyer fought to be discharged from the First Consultant Hospital. Dr Adadevoh stood her ground and overcame pressure to release him from the Liberian government headed by the Liberian Ambassador to Nigeria. The BBC reports that Sawyer desired to leave the hospital for his pastor’s church where he hoped for a ‘miracle cure’.\n\nIn the process of restraining the rogue patient, Adadevoh was infected with the deadly disease. She died on August 19th, 2014 and was mourned and honoured by the whole nation. In late October, 2014 the World Health Organisation declared Nigeria Ebola-free and Dr Adadevoh’s profile as a martyr was engraved in the minds of Nigerians.\n\nBorn Ameyo Stella Shade Adadevoh on 27th October 1958, the physician got her degrees from the universities of Lagos (MBBS) and London (endocrinology). She is a posthumous recipient of more than twenty awards including the Number One Humanitarian Everyone Should Know About (2014) by the international Medical Corps.\n\nThe story of Adadevoh echoes that of many Nigerians who came, lived and quietly died for their motherland.\n\n2. Lt-Colonel Muhammed Abu Ali\n\nLieutenant Colonel Muhammed Abu Ali died fighting Boko Haram in November 2016. He was the commanding officer of 272 Tank Battalion. Regarded as the bravest officer in Nigeria’s ten years fight against Boko Haram, the officer was, alongside four of his men, killed in an insurgent ambush in Mallam Fatori, Borno State.\n\nBefore his death, Lieutenant Colonel Abu Ali was recognised by the Chief of Army Staff for ‘courage, bravery and exceptional performance’ in 2015. At death, the army described him as a ‘hero of our time’ and gave him a burial with full military rites at the National Cemetery Abuja.\n\nBorn on August 15, 1980, in Lagos of Kogi parents, Abu Ali was commissioned from the Nigerian Defence Academy in 2003. Mourning him are his wife, kids and 170 million Nigerians. The army ably captured the stature of his efforts in their statement declaring that the colonel paid ‘the ultimate price so that millions can sleep on their beds in peace’.\n\n3. Ken Saro Wiwa\n\nKen Saro-Wiwa was born Kenule Beeson Tsaro-Wiwa on the 10th of October 1941 in Bori. He graduated from the University of Ibadan where he studied English. He was a playwright, a TV producer and novelist (he published Soza Boy: A Novel in Rotten English in 1985). He had short stints lecturing in the universities of Nsukka and Lagos. Wiwa also held various offices under the military administration of Old Rivers State.\n\nIn 1990, Saro-Wiwa became a vocal voice for his native Ogoni people, decrying years of negligence in Ogoniland that left their community in environmental ruin. Saro-Wiwa was an influential member of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) which fought to limit oil exploration in the area, repair the destruction caused by oil exploration and give the host community a substantial amount of oil proceeds.\n\nIn 1993, Shell suspended operations in Ogoni which infuriated the Nigeria junta led by Dictator Sani Abacha. Saro-Wiwa was arrested variously for his campaigns. In 1995 he was, along with eight other leaders of MOSOP, arrested for the last time. They were tried for the murder of four Ogoni chiefs sympathetic to Shell.\n\nIn a tribunal trial believed to be a travesty of judicial process which saw the defence counsel resigning in protest of the overt bias of the tribunal and the admittance of witnesses believed to have been bribed to testify falsely, the Ogoni Nine as Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-accused were tagged, were found guilty and sentenced to death.\n\nSaro-Wiwa was hanged in Port Harcourt by executioners imported from Sokoto. ‘Lord take my soul, but the struggle continues’ were his last words. The resultant international outcry cost Nigeria her Commonwealth seat and energised the opponents of the regime, both within and outside Nigeria.\n\nNearly twenty-two years after his death, the issues Saro-Wiwa fought for have defiled conclusion.\n\n4. Sam Okwaraji\n\nA popular myth told among little children, but surprisingly still mouthed by adults, narrates that Sam Okwaraji died while playing against India after scoring the sole goal for Nigeria to win the match Nigeria lost 99-1. People resort to myths when the comprehension of reality fails them. This myth, at least, confirms the legendary status of Okparaji.\n\nSamuel Sochukwuma Okwaraji was born on May 9, 1964, in Imo Sate. He was an intellectual footballer, something rare, if not impossible today. He was a lawyer with a Master’s degree from the University of Rome. He won silver in the 1988 nations cup in Morocco and was part of the squad at the 1988 Olympic in South Korea.\n\nIt is believed that while playing for Green Eagles (now Super Eagles) he paid his flight tickets to and from without asking for refunds from the football authority. There is also a record of a famous outburst with his club manager in which he says: ‘You or your club cannot stop me from representing my country… I am going to represent my country whether you like it or not’.\n\nHe died playing in Italy 1990 World Cup Qualifier against Angola on August 12, 1989. Tests revealed he died of cardiac failure. Twenty-two years after his death, Okwaraji was honoured with his bust built in front of the now neglected national stadium Surulere, Lagos.\n\n5. Fela Anikulapo Kuti\n\nA surprise appearance here.\n\nFela Kuti was not actually killed in the line of duty to Fatherland. He died of aids. But by the time of this death, he had been on the painful end of clashes with the brutal military governments of Nigeria of the previous two decades.\n\nBorn on 15 October, 1938 as Olufela Olusegun Olutodun Ransome-Kuti. His mother Mrs Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti was one of the earliest female activists in Nigeria. Fela went to London in 1958 to study medicine which he abandoned for music. he returned to Nigeria in 1963 having participated in numerous jazz and highlife bands.\n\nHe founded the Kalatuta Republic a community that includes his home and studio. In 1977, Fela released the Album Zombie which mocked the military government headed by Obasanjo. The military retaliated. More than a thousand soldiers raided Kalatuta Republic, beat up Fela and molested his mother who was his neigbour. They destroyed his studio and built down the republic. A few days later, Fela’s mother died.\n\nTo protest his mother’s death, Fela sent her coffin to Dodan Barrack, headquarters of the military rulers. He wrote the song ‘Coffin for head of state’. Fela moved to Ghana where he was banned for instigating an uprising during a live performance.\n\nFela formed a political party Movement of the People (MOP) to ‘mop clean’ Nigeria. He presented himself for president in the 1979 elections. His party was not registered and his candidacy disallowed.\n\nHe continued his crusade via his songs against the ruling establishment under President Shagari. He was arrested and jailed in 1984 by the government of Buhari. He was released after Babangida overthrew Buhari. Fela continued his activism, into the 1990s broadening it to include fight against apartheid and the politics of bias in what he termed the disunited United Nations.\n\nThe government of Abacha arrested him, charged him with murder and imprisoned him.\n\nWhen Fela left prison, he seemed to have been drained of his will to fight for justice. His public appearances waned and he stopped singing. Fela was battling HIV. He had outlived four military rulers and a civilian oligarchy but in 1997, Fela fell to aids.\n\nFela’s unflattering personal lifestyle does not detract from the fact that he lived most of his life fighting for the good of Nigerians, facing powerful forces knowing that death was not the worst they can do to him. They might kill him, but they couldn’t stiffen his voice which echoes to this date.\n\n6. Kudirat Abiola\n\nAlhaja Kudirat Abiola was born Kudirat Adeyemi in Zaria in 1951. She was assassinated on June 9th, 1995 under the brutal regime of Sani Abacha. Married to the winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 election, MKO Abiola, Kudirat has been addressed as the first lady Nigeria never had.\n\nSergeant Rogers has confessed to leading her murder gang, working on the orders of Major Hamza Al-Mustapha who acted for Abacha. In 2012, after fourteen years in the dock, Al-Mustapha, and co-accused Shofolayan, was found guilty and sentenced to death for his role in the killing. He was however released in 2013 in what many believe was part of Jonathan’s tactics to appease the north restless over his governance.\n\nKudirat left seven children behind.\n\nThe courage, and the tenacity, with which Mrs Abiola fought for democracy and justice in Nigeria’s darkest period since the civil war is arguably unmatched. When, on that sad day, her Mercedes Benz was overtaken along Ibadan-Lagos Expressway and six men with machine guns opened fire on her, they thought they have ended her life.\n\nKudirat lives on. She remains a giant reminder of a history of holding government accountable in the face of grave consequences. A history this generation follows half-heartily.\n\n7. Enenche Akogwu\n\nAkogwu was killed on the 20th of January, 2012 while covering the aftermath of a series of bombings and killings by Boko Haram in the city that left nearly 200 people dead. Enenche was born on 30th March 1980 in Benue State. He graduated from Benue State University in 2004. He was an award-winning cameraman and journalist for Channels TV.\n\nEnenche was described by Kayode Akintemi, Channels general manager of operations, as a ‘hardworking journalist who travelled to some of the most dangerous places in Northern Nigeria to get stories.’\n\nNigerian democracy is hampered by ethno-religious sentiments, misinformation and a stark lack of education. Journalists like Eneche, who risk their lives to hold the light of information against the darkness hovering around our democracy and eventually lose their lives, deserve more approbation than we have paid them.\n\n8. Murtala Muhammed\n\nMurtala was assassinated on 13th February 1976 six months after assuming the head of state of Nigeria. He was a popular leader having overthrown the rudderless government of Gowon whose only claim to achievement was keeping Nigeria one, a task he accomplished with more than a million deaths from the secessionist side.\n\nMurtala put Nigeria on the path of modernism. He created 7 more states bringing the states to 19, abolished ‘north’ ‘south’ etc attached to the names of states (eg North Central State), picked Abuja as the site of the new capital city, generally restored the confidence of the people to governance and made a strong commitment to restore civilian rule in 1979.\n\nMurtala Ramat Muhammed was born on November 8, 1938, in Kano. He was commissioned in the army in 1961 and fought in Congo. Murtala humble posture meant he moved around without a convoy of bodyguards something improbable for commissioners and impossible for governors today. He was easily assassinated by Lt-Col. Dimka in a counter-coup.\n\nOne dent on Murtala’s profile is his role in the Asaba Massacre during the Civil War. But he was a hero who, even his detractors cannot deny, died for Nigeria.\n\n9. Dora Akunyili\n\nDora Akunyili is synonyms with NAFDAG’s fight against drug counterfeit in Nigeria. She was the director of the National Agency for Food Drug Administration and control between 2001 and 2008, spearheading the battle against fake drug and unsafe food in Nigeria with little regards to her personal safety. Before heading NAFDAC Nigerians took chalk for tablets and companies packaged food with Stone Age caution.\n\nDora Akunyili’s home is laden with scores of awards, given both in Nigeria and abroad.\n\nIn 2008, Dora Akunyili became minister of Information and communication. She laughed the rebrand Nigeria project of which the slogan ‘Good People, Great Nation’ is used to this day. In late 2009, Nigeria passed through a period of dire political crisis. Yar’adua was ill in foreign hospital but the vice Goodluck Jonathan was denied power because of the failure of Yar’adua to hand over power via the national assembly.\n\nDora Akunyili moved for the resolution in the cabinet, breaking a silence thick with political peril. Nigerians keyed into the resolution and eventually, the National assembly triggered a doctrine of necessity and Jonathan became acting president.\n\nWhile Professor Akunyili fought for Nigeria, she was having a private battle with cancer. In 2014, heavily emaciated and bony from her illness, Dora Akunyili joined other Nigerians as a delegate in the Nigerian National Conference seeking to dialogue a way forward in a country burdened by insecurity and ethno-religious sentiments not seen since the return of democracy in 1999.\n\nDora Akunyili did not survive the end of the conference; she died on the 7th of June 2014. Born in 14 July, 1954 in Markurdi, Benue State, Professor Akunyili is from Nanka in Anambra. Married to JC Akunyili, they have six children together. But she left behind millions of other children whom her courage and integrity mothered.\n\n10. Dele Giwa\n\nEvery 19th of October, since 1986, a section of the media publishes articles lauding the life of Dele Giwa. They usually end with the question: Who killed Dele Giwa?\n\nDele Giwa was born Sumonu Ayodele Giwa in March 16, 1947 in Ile-Ife. Dele giwa studied in Obafemi Awolowo University Ife in Nigeria, Brooklyn College and Fordham University in the United States. A worked for four years in the New York Times newspaper. He returned to Nigeria and teamed up with Ray Ekpu, Yakubu Mohammed and Dan Agbese to found Newswatch Magazine.\n\nThrough this Magazine, Dele Giwa and his colleagues wrote articles that the governments of Buhari and later Babangida were uncomfortable with. The State Security Service questioned Dele Giwa in the few days leading to his death and accused him of various treasonable offences including abetting the overthrow of the government.\n\nOn Sunday 19 October 1986, Giwa received a letter reportedly titled ‘From the C-in-C’. Giwa is widely quoted saying ‘This must be from the president’. The ‘president’ being Babangida. Colonel Halilu Akilu, director of the Military intelligence and Lt-Col Ajibiola Tunde Togun, deputy director of the SSS are accused of his death.\n\nThe legendary lawyer Gani Fawehinmi, convinced that Babangida got Dele Giwa killed, fought to bring Akilu and Togun to justice, as a private prosecutor. His efforts were frustrated by both the police and the judiciary.\n\nThe last flash of hope that justice might be served for Dele Giwa came during the Oputa Panel Judicial commission but Babangida, Akilu and Togun all got injunctions barring them from appearing before the panel. ‘In the interest of peace’, Justice Oputa declined to challenge the injunctions.\n\nNo one is certain why Dele Giwa was killed. Some have pointed to Dele Giwa having information to Grace Okon a supposed drug pusher with connections to Mrs Babangida; others believe he was a voice against Babangida’s desire to remain in power for life; others, still, theorise that Giwa was the symbol of military intimidation of the press.\n\nThe motive for the assassination of Dele Giwa might outlive this century, but it is clear that whatever he was killed for, he was doing for Nigeria. Dele Giwa was a martyr.\n\nOther notable names: MKO Abiola, Tunde Oladepo, Shehu Yar’adua, Bayo Ohu, Christopher Okigbo, Bola Ige etc\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWhy FG Banned Imports Of Packaged Tomato Past To Nigeria\n\nThe Federal Government has banned the importation of packaged tomato paste, powder or concentrate, and increased the tariff on the importation of tomato concentrate among others from 5% to 50 % in order to revive the tomato sector.\n\nThis was made known by the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment in a document titled: “Implementation of the Tomato Sector Policy.”\n\nThe document which was signed by the Director, Industry Development of the ministry, Mr. Adewale Bakare, stated that such action would revive the sector, create jobs and preserve foreign exchange.\n\nIt reads:\n\n“As you are aware, government has over time engaged tomato industry stakeholders on ways to deepen the industry and particularly, encourage the use of locally produced tomato fruits across the value chain.\n\n“It is in that regard that I am directed to bring to your notice the decision of the government towards boosting production and attracting investments into the tomato sector.\n\n“These include classification of greenhouse equipment as agricultural equipment to attract zero percent import duty. Ban on the importation of tomato paste, powder or concentrate put up for retailing and others. Ban on tomato prepared or preserved by vinegar or acetic acid and others.\n\n“Increase in the tariff on the tomato concentrate and other concentrates (HS Code 2002.90.11.000) from five percent to fifty percent and additional levy of $1,500 per metric tons with the objective of increasing the current tariff from five percent to fifty percent (35% +5%+10%) and an additional levy of US$1,500 metric ton.\n\n“Restriction on the importation of tomato concentrates to the seaports to address abuse of ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation scheme (ETLS) and inclusion of tomato production and processing in the list of industries eligible for investment incentives administered by the Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC).”\n\nAccording to the Ministry, the foregoing measures which are situated within the overall roadmap for the development of the industry, are expected to create jobs, save foreign exchange and create capacity for export of tomato concentrate and paste to ECOWAS sub –region and beyond.\n\nLast week, the Tomato Union of Nigeria (TUN) had sought the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in aiding access to raw materials through its foreign exchange policy.\n\nWorried about their inability to access triple concentrates needed to produce tomato paste, spokesman for the Union and Managing Director, Sonia Foods Industries Limited, Nnamdi Nnodebe, said the present forex policy continues to encourage smuggling of inferior tomato paste brands through the borders.\n\nNnodebe said the only way to save the industry is for CBN to either remove tomato paste triple concentrate from the FX policy restrictions or provide the raw materials in question to the industry.\n\nThe TUN stressed that if the local producers of tomato paste get the raw materials directly from CBN, it would save the industry from collapse and also help the government avoid creating more job losses.\n\n“It is no more profitable to produce locally hence the closures. How do you expect producers of tomato paste in Nigeria to compete with their foreign counterparts that have uninterrupted power supply, good roads and distribution network, subsidized loans from their governments. The major material used by the local brands, triple concentrate, has been taken away through this Forex policy,” Nnodebe lamented.\n\nTomato Paste Triple Concentrate is a crucial ingredient used to process consumer products such as packs of tomato paste, ketchup, sauces, among others.\n\n↧\n\nTop Ten Richest People In Nigeria 2017 (Forbes)\n\nSo its 2017 and we all know a lot has happened top our economy within the last 12 months.

She is a trained digital filmmaker at the New York Film Academy. She is a gifted Writer, with several intriguing screenplays to her credit: including 'Fatal Imagination', 'Being Mrs Elliott', 'The First Lady' and 'Wives on Strike'.\n\nEARLY LIFE AND BACKGROUND\n\nNigeria actress Omoni Oboli, was born in Benin City, Edo state, hails from Mosogar in Delta State, She had her secondary school education at Delta Steel Company Technical High School (DSC THS) Between 1989 and 1994 and went on to study at University of Benin where she holds a Bachelors degree in Foreign Languages (majoring in French, Language).\n\nIn 1996, while in University she produced her First movie. She is an award winning Actress, Movie producer and script writer. Omoli Oboli got married to her Husband Nnamdi Oboli on October 28, 2000.\n\nSPEAKING IN INTERVIEW ABOUT GROWING UP:\n\nWhat was growing up like for you?\n\nIt was fun and carefree, because there was a lot of love in the home I grew up in with my mum and sister. I lived in the then Delta Steel Company (DSC) complex, which was a haven where I got a great education and lived a pleasant lifestyle even though we weren’t rich. The memories of growing up were mostly pleasant for me. DSC is not the same as it was then anymore.\n\nYou studied French Language, what prompted your becoming an actress?\n\nI think your question should be the other way round. Many people who knew me back then are still wondering why I chose French, because what I was known for was acting and directing and writing plays in the church in school plays and in the French club where I was the head of all those clubs back then in my secondary school. Acting started even before my primary school at the age of 3. I have always known acting and wanted to do it as long as I can remember so the prompting was really to study French which I felt didn’t just come naturally with me because you had to study it to know it well or live in a French country to properly communicate in it. So I studied French with my eye fully on acting.\n\nDo you sometimes regret the years that you took a break from movies?\n\nNot really. Considering what I got from the years I left, I wouldn’t trade my education, husband and my children for anything. Every other thing can wait but these blessings do not wait for you. It’s the grace of God, and I’m grateful to Him for giving me the wisdom to grab them when I had the chance. No regrets for me there, but just gratefulness!\n\nCAREER AND LIFE\n\nOmoni began her formal movie career with her first movie role in ‘Bitter Encounter’, 1996, where she played a secretary. Her next was ‘Shame’. She then went on to play the lead female character in three major movies; ‘Not My Will,’ ‘Destined To Die’ and ‘Another Campus Tale.’\n\nAfter enjoying a brief but interesting and fulfilling career in 1996, Omoni left the movie industry to complete her university education. She got married immediately after school and didn’t return to the industry till a decade later.\n\nSince her return to the industry, Omoni has fast risen to the top, playing a number of lead and supporting roles in major movies. She brings – dignity, poise, class, smooth delivery, and extreme professionalism to the varied roles she’s played. She is a gifted screenwriter, with several intriguing screenplays to her credit. These including the current blockbuster movie, 'Wives On Strike'. In June 2007, The Rivals, a movie she co-produced with her friend, won the coveted prize for Best International Drama at the New York International Independent Film & Video Festival. It was the first Nigerian film to be premiered since the festival’s inception in 2003. The movie was given a 3 star rating out of 4 by the festival’s judges.\n\nOmoni has shot into prominence as the class act of Nollywood because of her professional demeanor and strong work ethics. Playing lead roles in wave making, blockbuster movies like ‘The Figurine,’ ‘Anchor Baby’, ‘Being Mrs Elliott’, and the soon to be released movies, ‘Feathered Dreams,’ and Mo Abudu’s ‘Fifty’ has set her apart as one who knows how to choose good screenplays. She has also set the bar higher by being the first actress from Nollywood to bag such international awards as Best Actress in two international festivals in the same year (2010) that are not organized by Nigerians or Africans. This she did at the Harlem international film festival and the Los Angeles Movie Awards for her lead role in the movie, ‘Anchor Baby’.\n\nOmoni starred in the movie Okafor's law, which premiered on March 24, 2017. However the movie premiere was cancelled due to an injunction by the court; Omoni is currently being accused of copyright infringement by Jude Idada, he claims to have written the storyline behind Okafor's law. Several attempts were made to reach Omoni before the premiere date, but she feigned ignorance. The movie was set to be released in cinemas, March 31st. The court case against Omoni shed light on the theft of intellectual property in Nigeria.\n\nSPEAKING ABOUT HER LIFE AND CAREER:\n\nTell us about your first onscreen experience?\n\nI was a ‘waka pass’ in my first experience. I played a secretary in one movie and Liz Benson‘s maid in another movie, ‘Shame‘. For me, any role was better than no role. I was too excited to be in the movies to worry about what role I played, and I was protected then by the producers and actors who saw my talent and were all too willing to give me the chance I needed to get ahead in the industry. I remember Opa Williams always making sure that I was okay and that I wasn’t being harassed by anyone. Those early days were just fun and goofing around for me. I was just passionate about being in the movies and when Fidelis Duker gave me the lead role in two of his movies, ‘Not my Will‘ and ‘Destined to Die‘, I was elated. This opened the door for Hilda Dokubo to give me the lead in her own production, ‘Another campus tale‘. I wonder where those movies are now? I would love to have a copy myself.\n\nHow did you meet your husband and what’s your love story?\n\nI met him when I first started acting in Lagos in 1996, but just for about a few minutes. He later found me four years later in my final year and we started dating. He proposed to me two weeks into our relationship and the rest is history. There’s a great love story there somewhere. (Laughs) He must have rocked my world to the point of me saying yes, because I was just 21 years old! Many felt I was too young, but I thank God that their opinion didn’t sway my decision.\n\nOwing to her passion to make a change, Omoni Oboli has set up a charity organisation, Omoni Oboli Foundation, www.omoniobolifoundation.com, to use her celebrity status to bring well needed relief to the plight of the less privileged women and children in the society. The foundation has been able to embark on several projects. These include:\n\nThe feeding of street children in Lagos and giving them a fun filled day with gifts\n\nFeeding and giving over two hundred poor and disadvantaged children at Delta Steel Complex, Aladja, a fun day with practical gifts.\n\nBroadening the mindset of the less privileged children by taking the children of Ecole Divine Nursery Primary and Secondary School to a milk factory to see how it is made and packaged.\n\nThis is just to mention a few, with plans to do much more, as their needs are endless.\n\nAWARDS AND ENDORSEMENTS\n\nIn 2010 she won the award for Best Actress - Narrative Feature at the Los Angeles Movie Awards, and the award for Best Actress at the Harlem International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2014, Omoni won Big Screen Actress of the Year award, at the 2014 ELOY Awards, for her movie Being Mrs Elliott.

Whenever I was alone, I sometimes imitated one of the actors I was familiar with at that time, mostly Ali Nuhu – the way he danced or his acting style.\n\nI never thought I would be this successful in just a short time. But thanks to my determination and willingness to commit my everything in to it and now I am going places. Any time I watch Ali Nuhu in any film I see a talent and a star. He has always been my idol.\"\n\nCAREER AND LIFE\n\nNuhu Abdullahi is unarguably one the most promising Kannywood actor today.\n\nAt 26, Nuhu has produced and acted in some of Kannywood’s blockbusters, like Baya da Kura this year.

And that was the beginning\"\n\nPT: One film that made your personality known in Hausa film was Kanin Miji. How did you feel about that role you played?\n\nAbdullahi: Kanin Miji is my favourite film so far. I love the film because of the lesson it was portraying. You know it was about a culture that is practiced in the north where one can play with the wife of his elder brother without definite demarcation. In my own case in the film, I became too close to my elder brother’s wife which did not go well with him which later turned out to be something else. It happens in the north and the dangers of that is what the film portrays.\n\nIt was indeed a marvellous film that is dear to my heart because of the message.\n\nPT: Which one Kannywood actress would you want to say is your favourite?\n\nAbdullahi: Fati Washa is always my favourite and I wouldn’t even regret it if I said I love her. She is incredibly a wonderful person to me, she has always been nice to me and I mean it, I can do anything to make her happy, calm and very respectful.\n\nPT: Why Fati Washa among all?\n\nAbdullahi: Like I told you, I cannot explain why, all I know is I have a passionate regards for her and I appreciate her any day. I also have good friends like Rahama Sadau and others.\n\nPT: Would you want her as a wife?\n\nAbdullahi: Yes, if that happens I wouldn’t mind. When somebody is nice to you it is only fair that you reciprocate same to that person.\n\nNuhu and Ali on set\n\nSOURCES: sunnewsonline.com,premiumtimesng.com,takemetonaija.com\n\n↧"
