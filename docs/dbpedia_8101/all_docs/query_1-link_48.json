        "text": "Nations come into existence through different means, and the nature of germination greatly influences and shapes the future progress, problems, challenges, successes, and unity of these nations. Some countries, like England, were established through geographic isolation, while others, like the United State of America and Australia, came into existence through emigration, and that means, displacing the native nations. The progression for the countries in this latter group is the gradual culmination of thought, thereby through concerted ideation, thinking themselves into nationhood. For some other countries, they come into existence through the collapse and withering away of old kingdoms and empires. In this regard, Italy, France, notably comes to mind. Other countries enter existence by means of peace treaties, and others, like most of the African nations, through the design and machination of colonialism. Nigeria, a country in the present-day West Africa came into existence by the march of the 20th century colonialism. But the deeper analysis will trace the advent of Nigeria, like many other African countries, to the 1884-5 Berlin conference which begun the scramble of Africa. What this so-called scramble spelt for Africa was the possession and dominance of the people, kingdoms and territories by foreign powers and blocs that only collapsed her original boundaries and integrating them into new entities once referred by Wole Soyinka as nation spaces. For Nigeria, it all began with a different Northern and Southern protectorate administered separately by Britain until 1914 arrived, accompanied by Lord Lugard and Flora Shaw, hence the amalgamation of the protectorates and the birth of a new country, Nigeria. The most populous black nation, clearly, came into being by a compulsive conglomeration of diverse people without regards for their consent, whose characteristics, ideologies, philosophies, cultures and religions were incompatible, but who by the interests of the colonial masters were gathered into a unit, and made a country. This book, driven by a dedicated ambition to address the foundational problems of Nigeria before prescribing solutions, recognizes the emanation of these problems from the very outset and formulation of the country. Today, the challenges facing the country is hydra headed and complex, ranging from economic inequality, social injustice and flowing into nepotism, corruption and political lackluster. This book contends to establish how virtually all the thematic problems of Nigeria has the imprints of the first original issue: lack of consensual definition of what Nigeria is or should be for the people, an absence of agreement by the people of what the country should be for the people. In the face of its sweltering problems and cantankerous history which, at one time featured a 30-month war, the country continues to exist as a unit, betraying a seeming resolve to remain in existence as one body. But this continued existence has not been one without challenges, and have in times neared implosion, inciting urgent needs for discourse over the future and definition of the country. Chinua Achebe (1983) opined that “Nigeria is not a great country, it is one of the most corrupt, insensitive, inefficient places under the sun, it is dirty, callous, noisy, ostentatious, dishonest and vulgar; in short it is one of the most unpleasant places on earth.” Such angry view is the opinion of the literary icon towards the country and in the same book, The Trouble with Nigeria, Achebe summarized that the problem with Nigeria is squarely and primarily the failure of leadership. However, opening his last book, Achebe narrated that the problem with Africa, which Nigeria is prominently among, started in 1884-5. “The rain that beat Africa”, Achebe wrote, using rain as a metaphor for problem and challenges, “began four to five hundred years ago, from the ‘discovery’ of Africa by Europe, through the transatlantic slave trade, to the Berlin Conference of 1885.” Agreement to Achebe’s diagnosis finds support in many scholars and texts which one of them is Walter Rodney who wrote the famous How Europe Underdeveloped Africa. Yet regardless of this argument and much of the validity and veracity that attends and characterize it, Africa, and Nigeria, has throughout the span of its contemporary existence come upon defining moments that provided the opportunity to shape its destiny, to chart a new course, to develop a path, to build itself and to define what it is and what it should be. For Nigeria, whose independence came October 1st 1960, the opportunity immediately came to define itself, to shape her path and operational structure. With coups coming in January 1966 and its consequent counter coups, Nigeria followed a totally and initially unconceived direction; yet in its abrasiveness, these experiences when closely studied, proved to have in the grand scheme, provided opportunities in the end of it all, to once again form and build a country. Some of these opportunities appeared at the end of the Civil War that lasted between 1967-1970, which its end was a great opportunity to make good of Nigeria; another chance surfaced once again in 1980 when Shehu Shagari’s civilian government was sworn-in, bringing the halftime of the military junta. It flopped, the government, as the country remained blighted by the same problems persecuting her from its birth. When 1999 arrived, finally sweeping away the military, ushering the current democratic dispensation, avenue for Nigerian greatness appeared again, but till now, keeps flickering and dwindling into oblivion. Nigeria today stands in a myriad of problems, making the country a hotbed of contentious issues, dragging the reputation of the nation down in the comity of nations. The over 250 ethnic sects lumped into a whole in Nigeria continues to suffer the progressive ambitions of Nigeria as no clear formula has been found and adequately applied to rescue the nation from the malady of nepotism stemming from the mindless favouritism of leaders at the helm. Often times, this attitude sacrifices competence and meritocracy at the altar of mediocrity. Once, Quota System and Federal Character were promulgated as principles to answer the question of ethnic complexities and equal representation, but leaders continue to flout it, and when respected, is greatly influenced by party politics to a point of maddening abuse and insult of the masses sense and understanding of pertinent quality. In mainstream parlance, Nigerians call this: square pegs in round holes. This often give rise to a total disinterest and belief in the government by the people. The average Nigerian believes that the government lacks the political will to drive the country towards sustainable development. Evidence of this abounds, just as many challenges beset the country, dragging and slow-pedaling the little spark and charge of resolve towards greatness. By the behavourial disposition of federal governance, a section of the country strongly believe it is being marginalized and classified as second grade citizens in their own country, while another quarter believes it is their right and inheritance to rule Nigeria. The South Eastern Igbo people, who were the opposition to the Nigerian force in the Civil War of 1960, a war entered into because of their secessionist ambition, remain till today, with the same secessionist inclinations. Marginalization remains the popular question enlivening the separatist proclivity and the extreme apologists of these understanding has since long formed unions like the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, and most recently, actively, the Independent People of Biafra, IPOB. Injustice pervades the country, still, and divides itself into folds: economic, social and security. There exists in Nigeria an unfair balance and distribution of resources, occasioning a wide and widening class gap. There is social injustice with some citizen, in enormous impunity, living above the law. The executive arm of government often disobeys court orders, for example against Col Dasuki who is detained for arms fund embezzlement scandal, mocking the setting of separation of power while the legislature remain lulled in sleep by inane party politics. The elite bourgeois and the leaders secure themselves with state resources, employing the best hands in the police and military, protecting themselves from the insecurity their incompetence created, leaving the masses embroiled in deep insecurity. Kidnapping is rife in the country and insurgency through powerful sects like Boko Haram, claim a large chunk of the country’s territory. With every rising dawn, it appears Nigeria is stuck and eternally devoid of redemption. Is that true, this book asks, seeking to offer solutions but not without first, diving into the depths and bottoms of Nigeria’s intricate problems. By suggesting that the state and religion should be separated, hence making Nigeria a full secular country, this book aims to establish the background for further development geared towards progressivism. Yet it is not without factoring the ingrained and deeper fusion of religion into the fabric of a vast demography of Nigeria."
