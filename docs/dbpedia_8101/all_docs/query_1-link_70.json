        "text": "Nwachukwu Egbunike\n\nThe sea of the nation’s polity has never been calm. With the ripples generated by Boko Haram and Islamic banking, Nigeria’s shores have been violently assaulted. In the midst of this President Goodluck Jonathan released a press statement on his intention to send a Bill to the National Assembly to amend the constitutional tenure provisions for elected public servants. This of course has widened the ruckus in the public square, with many for and against.\n\nA note on the president’s Facebook page runs thus:\n\n“President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is to send a Constitution amendment Bill to the National Assembly that will that will provide a single tenure for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Governors of the 36 states of the Federation. In the envisaged Bill, the tenure of members of the National and State Assemblies will also be a little more than four years, although lawmakers will still be eligible for re-election as their constituencies may determine.”\n\nGoodluck’s Goodwill?\n\nThe president insists that this proposed amendment is not self-serving but\n\n“is borne out of a patriotic zeal, after a painstaking study and belief that the constitutionally guaranteed two terms for Presidents and Governors is not helping the focus of Governance and institutionalization of democracy at this stage of our development. A longer term for lawmakers would also help to stabilize the polity.”\n\nHe went ahead to note that the bile that flows from elections spills with much distaste. The effect of political violence is staggering and the cost is becoming too much for the country to afford every four years. In what shows Goodluck’s goodwill like no other is his insistence that:\n\n“If the proposed amendment is accepted by the National Assembly, the President assures that he will not in any way be a beneficiary.”\n\nNo sooner had this pronouncement was dispersed, the motley of opposition sounded loud and clear. The answer was a deafening no! Mr Goodluck once again was forced to clarify his stance and this time he said that it was not his idea rather a position adopted by political parties while he was still the vice president.\n\nFree to Speak and to Oppose\n\nMr Jonathan is angry that the upheaval against the proposed amendment is a thrust to deny him his freedom of speech. However, our president seems to have forgotten that democracy is about ‘you talk your own, I talk my own’. No one possess a divine monopoly to wisdom, even amidst the cacophony of nonsense, sense can be drawn out.\n\nOur president is also startled that a few consultations he had made with some people seem not to have pacified the crowd. It is trite to remind Mr Goodluck that Nigerians elected him, they voted for him on his personal merit and not because his was the mast carrier of the PDP. As such, while the opposition parties can afford to play politics with the tenure wahala, ordinary Nigerians want a better life and they are getting impatient.\n\nWhere does this stand within the ‘fresh air’ we were promised? Electricity is still an illusion; our roads are littered with treacherous craters; the life of the common Nigerian is worth less than a kobo; people are buttered like cows in the name of God. This is certainly not the deal we expected. Also is it not proper that those who voted should have a say in the length of our elected people?\n\nThe issue of tinkering with the tenure of the president and governors obviously drew the ire of Nigerians. Memories of former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s ‘third term’ agenda are rather fresh. The nation was almost thrown on a war path by the perceived overt ambition of Mr Obasanjo to stay more than his due in Aso Rock. The battle ranged not only in the media but also between followers of Obasanjo and Akitu Abubakar, his vice president. The plot was squashed in the Senate and the rest as they say is history.\n\nAs such it no surprise, the angst against Jonathans proposition. Nigerians, to put it bluntly, are cynical of their leaders. They have been betrayed a thousand times that they would not take the word of any political leader for anything. As such, no matter the public relations intervention that Mr Jonathan may adopt, the court of public opinion may never accept his proposal nor admit his good intentions.\n\nHow can they? Mr Jonathan is barely three months in office and is already flying the flag of not having enough time. With the myriad of kasala, what makes him think that any human being would be able to solve all of them even if he is granted a twenty-year-tenure? The issue at stake is not about time but the courage to do more and talk less. Besides, government is a continuum; Mr Jonathan should not expect to solve all our problems during his reign.\n\nThis tenure elongation tastes like a retirement plan. It seems to put to flesh the position of most that Mr Jonathan has no rudder. This insinuation was partly confirmed with the composition of his federal cabinet. The assembly of people there paints a portrait of a settlement team – save Mrs Okonjo Iwela and Professor Bath Nnaji – the others inspire no confidence.\n\nSomeone has to remind our dear president to fix his attention on the four year period that we have granted him. If he still wants any other confirmation that it not a matter of time but guts, he should sneak more often into Lagos. Babatunde Fashola created this transformation in only four years. There one sees, smells and tastes a real transformation agenda.\n\nMr Jonathan must realise that he is totally on his own on insisting that he would not benefit from the largess of a single term. I stand to be corrected, but many of his colleagues will jump at it. For one, it would be a looting jamboree. If the horrid stench of corruption has upturned this much, just imagine an interrupted single term? Heaven help us!\n\nNonetheless, let us wait for the National Assembly, though I do not expect much from them. Their incestuous romance with the executive is an open secret. And since they would be direct beneficiaries it would take a saintly courage for them to reject this offer. However, no matter what happens, Mr Jonathan should realise that he is stretching his good luck with Nigerians too far. The man whose house is on fire does not chase rats!\n\nNwachukwu Egbunike\n\nA reputation once broken may possibly be repaired, but the world will always keep their eyes on the spot where the crack was. – Joseph Hall\n\nMallam Nassir El-Rufai, former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory was a recent guest of the State Security Service (SSS). Within minutes of his unsolicited ‘invitation’ the blogosphere buzzed with detailed tweets of his detention. While I empathise with the former minister on his ordeal, however I do not understand his cry of martyrdom.\n\nSince it has become politically correct to make an open disclosure, I wish to state that I have no personal or professional connection with the PDP or the government of the day. Besides, I know that this post will draw the ire of many; nonetheless, every commentator runs that risk. For one, I ‘was’ once an admirer of Mr El-Rufai. In the days of the ‘cabal’ El-Rufai was the gadfly of late Yar’Adua’s administration. His work as Minister of the FCT stands the test of time, that no minister till date has supersede or replicated. However, the former minister’s silence during the post election violence in the North has diminished his moral authority. Mr Rufai has thus assumed the garment of a partisan politician and has such exhausted the neutral principal stand which he once enjoyed.\n\nThe ‘certified ruffle of feathers’ really caused some constipation with his two articles, ‘Jonathan’s Tough Choices’ and ‘What Nigerians Pay the FG’. Granted that a democracy needs a strong opposition but in my view El-Rufai’s CPC cannot fill that vacuum. For one, is that CPC has deepened the stereotype of they against us which is Nigeria’s greatest headache.\n\nEl-Rufai cannot therefore take a grandstand of the one who has done no evil. By the way, we have not forgotten that he was one of those who hoisted Yar’Adua and Goodluck on Nigeria. Though he recanted when he fell off the good books of the government, we cannot just forget that in a hurry or pretend that it never happened.\n\nI am particularly perplexed that for one who allowed these words to flow from his pen: “But we all need to use a fresh lens when looking at Nigeria. Backroom deals in which political elites negotiate the fate of Nigeria’s 150 million people are a relic of the past – or they should be. The North-South power rotation, or ‘zoning’ arrangement, that pretends to offer stability to Nigeria’s ethnically diverse population has morphed into a convenient justification for self-centered politicians” has now assumed the same stance.\n\nWhile no one can deny Mr El-Rufai his constitutional privilege of free speech, I think it’s high time to remind him that those who seek equity should do so with clean hands. Just a question: if El-Rufai’s CPC had been declared the winner of the presidential elections, would he mount the dais and trumpet to the world that the elections were neither free nor fair? I insist that Mr Rufai’s silence after the inferno that almost burnt down some parts of this country is his greatest undoing. It will take a lot of rebranding for our former minister to morph back to a statesman which he so much craves for. How does he convince us that his intentions are purely selfless and not spiced with the hues of selfish politics? The martyr’s chant of Mr Rufai is mere prattle.\n\nNwachukwu Egbunike\n\nWhen in heaven’s name will the Lagos/Ibadan Expressway be fixed? This is a rather sad question, for the mere fact that one needs not remind government of her responsibilities. But in our clime it one has no option but to speak out or suffer the tragedy of disgust.\n\nLate last year, in November, a friend was strangled by the noose called Lagos/Ibadan Expressway. Last month I skipped a premature embrace with my ancestors. With the trailer gone amok, I would have ended up under it’s belly. The month before I jumped harm on that open morgue; there was a great fire in front of Mountain of Fire. This was not from on high, rather it sprouted out from a violent kiss from two petrol tankers. Guess what, the inferno was intense – I wonder how hell’s would be? Lives were lost and cars were burnt. I was lucky that I only spent three hours before entering Lagos. I cannot count how many accidents I have witnessed. Other people who have the sad fortune of transversing that road in search of their daily garri, I bet, have worse tales.\n\nBut what do we get: is a curious billboard asking motorist to be patient. Blah, blah, blah! Another picture of the president adorns that pit, smiling and waving. Talk unending about concessioning:\n\nThe Federal Executive Council on Wednesday awarded Messrs Bi-Courtney Consortium the right to manage the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway under a 25-year concessioning arrangement valued at N89.5bn. Bi-Courtney, which is chaired by the Presidential Adviser on Legal Matters, Dr. Wale Babalakin, is also handling the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos Terminal 1 project under a Build, Operate and Transfer arrangement. The consortium is expected to upgrade the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway to international standard with full control of access.\n\nThis was in 2009 and up till now, nothing has been done. Bi-Courtney in the typical Pilate manner has absolved itself of any blame. It matters nothing if it took them three years to do so:\n\nWORK on the complete reconstruction and modernisation of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is set to begin, the concessionaire, Bi-Courtney Highway Services Limited, has said.\n\nWhile speaking with the reporters, Bi-Courtney’s Head of Communications and Media Relations, Mr. Dipo Kehinde, explained that the delay could in no way be blamed on the company, and was due largely to the bureaucracy of having its design approved as required by the terms of the concession.\n\nHe said the concession is on Design-Build-Operate-Transfer (DBOT) basis, adding that the company needed to get its design approved by the Federal Ministry of Works before work could begin, and the approval was only given on May 10 because of frequent changes of Ministers.\n\nReally? Why then did it take them so long to say so? Why continue in a deception while people die? It’s very easy to get depressed in this country. How can a firm take responsibility of a project and then push the burden else where?\n\nIf it’s not their fault, then all rests on the federal government. President Goodluck Jonathan should please do something. Things cannot just continue this way. In point 20 of your inaugural address you promised Nigerians happiness:\n\nWe must grow the economy, create jobs, and generate enduring happiness for our people.\n\nSir, we are not happy. You can change this gall and pavement of death into a road of transformation. Whatever the case, please do it fast, our patience is running out!\n\nNwachukwu Egbunike\n\nWhat is the worst of woes that wait on age?\n\nWhat stamps the wrinkle deeper on the bow?\n\nTo view each loved one blotted from life’s page\n\nAnd to be alone on earth as I am now.\n\n– Lord Byron, English poet/writer (Vanguard Book of Quotations; no 213)\n\nBeyond the glamour of having your name protruding like an over sized and over ripped mango on that piece of print lies the pain of birth. All who write – or pretend to do so – it matters not if fiction, fabrication, fact or fantasy, have savoured this pitchy pod. Though people with no end adore the pages filled with your ink, yet many will never penetrate the agony that garnish those pieces.\n\nIt’s not a matter of painting the globe in gloomy gurgle. Every writer has encountered this feeling of being just ‘on your own’. This changes not whether commissioned or not. Who cares if you gatecrash or just aspire to be a noisemaker and then get noticed? What lies always behind the madness to write is that you have to do it ALONE.\n\nWhen you scribble as a hobby you may never encounter this bitter reality. But no sooner you get swallowed up by the caress of vanity which people’s praises produce then you have just strolled into a first class train to purgatory. By the way, those who sing your admiration most times hardly ever read past the first paragraph. When they are gracious enough, they scan through the middle and then fast forward to the last paragraph.\n\nWhen you have been commissioned, either by an agent or by the purse of your employer, with an excruciating timeframe to deliver, then you have arrived. Though your keyboard bears the punches from your fingers, it can never produce the story for you. Soon you realise that writing is not as easy as it looks. And you have no reason to envy those who make ‘masterpieces,’ ‘page tuners,’ ‘worthy additions to the growing library in this field’ or so numerous book review over used expressions.\n\nYou have a thousand thoughts, the plot and sequence of your essay flows in chaos within your mind. You scavenge books and writings of other writers. Like the madmen/women’s work you consult, you have a burden to stand by the truth. Or at least try to gain a larger perspective that is no prisoner to your whims. What many never realise is that a writer is a reader. The more he reads, the better he becomes.\n\nBack to those fluid views bouncing forth in your brain. They never impersonate lady logic, it’s your shackle to fill the spaces and make sense out of nonsense. You would very much love to throw this back on someone else. But where do you find that another who will fully appreciate your agony? Is it your editor, who roars like a starved lion? Or your publisher whose interest lies solely on the coins that will drop from your work? Don’t dare ask your family, they appreciate your fame but may never understand your plight. Your colleagues, you may find some solace, but never expect a solution. For they have their own sack loaded with similar wahala (sorrow).\n\nSoon you will have to accept that you act weirdly. People soon avoid you; they have suffered the pain of your irritation once and do not intend to go through it again. Is it not true that no sooner you are possessed by the agwu (spirit) that plagues your trade, you lose reason? How many times have you been aloof though surrounded by people? Have they not tried to chatter while you prefer peace?\n\nAll of a sudden it clicks, the jigsaw falls in place and you rush to spew it out before it gets lost. That phrase that holds the key to your bread out of nowhere appears and insolently shams innocence. Your keyboard again suffers the revenge of your zeal; you knock and kick it to submission. And then the breaks are applied again – certainly not by you – but by the agwu that rules your pen. There is a block that has shut down all light. It is reinforced and it swings you back into bitter gloom.\n\nIf you write in Naija, then you have an edge. Your challenges will certainly be legion, so also your dexterity. You have to time your output with the differentials of electric power and dry-cell battery of your notebook. Not even the constancy of your generator can power full confidence because diesel or petrol can overnight turn into gold.\n\nDelusions of grandeur; who cares that you are a writer? The noise decibel in your neighbourhood is not about to tide down. The sources increase day by day as the pitch tones higher from the factories. They know no vacation especially the prayer industries. The elements you will soon notice have made a pact with your enemies; the rains will either flood your home or the sun scourge out the remaining particles in your head.\n\nTake not the human right ranting from the West serious. They may declare the Internet a human right, that will only apply across the Atlantic. Down under, it remains a privilege. You will certainly pay a ton for your modem but you will remain the slave of the ISP’s who will only treat you as dung, never mind their condescending ‘sir’ or ‘ma’. With the whizzing waft of corruption, the fear of your safety to the open hypocrisy of the trustees of our commonwealth, you gain an insight that a Creative Writing degree in Harvard will never grant you.\n\nBut write you must, failure of which means losing your humanity. Writing: the only antidote that keeps you sane, the exclusive outlet for your passions and the only sphere where you reign as a sovereign. For your words waters the world and greens the field. There are two options write or suffer the silence of insanity. This is the writer’s realm: which may never attract but keeps him addicted to his trade.\n\n“I will mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy (emphasis mine). Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.” – Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWhile Obama bombed Osama, my internet went wacko. As such I was not able to react to the newest global media overload, the death of US and world’s prime terrorist, Osama Bin Laden. While the hype or ‘celebration’ of Osama’s bombing continues, this quote from a friend’s wall on Facebook got me thinking.\n\nObviously the death of Osama is good news. A man who sent thousands to a premature embrace with their forefathers is certainly noting less than evil. No justification can stand to morph his heinous crimes into a palatable event. That said, the manner of US’s capture raises enough questions, I have no intention to go into that either. Besides, though Osama is gone, that does not necessarily translate into a ‘safer’ world. I stand to be corrected, but my guts tell me that soon more Osama’s will arise and they will have one single mission, to avenge his death.\n\nBesides, I live in a volatile country, where religion has been used as an excuse to kill, main and destroy. I only pray that Osama’s death evokes no contrary reaction, down under. It had happened before, so this is no mere exaggeration, a comic drawn in Holland did nothing there, only for it to reverberate into a fountain of blood in Naija.\n\nBack to Martin Luther King’s quote, is it right to celebrate Osama’s death? Something similar happened here in Naija, when General Abacha died, the whole nation erupted in wild jubilation. I was still an undergraduate and there was an instantaneous all night party on campus as soon as Abacha’s death was confirmed. This of course is a pointer, to those who inflict pain on others, forgetting that someday they will be equally pay retribution. Osama certainly deserved the death he got. Our planet also has been spared the stench of darkness. However, methinks we are gradually losing our humanity by gloating over the death of another man!\n\nNB: I admire reader’s reactions and comments. However, let’s be civil and rational, avoiding foul language. Besides it’s only my ‘opinion’.\n\nA few hours ago, HRH Prince Williams, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine “Kate” (nee Middleton), Duchess of Cambridge, were declared husband and wife by the Archbishop of Canterbury at the Westminster Abbey. On behalf of my household, I wish the Prince and Princess a blissful married life, devoid of the pitfalls that have characterized the British blue blood.\n\nNonetheless, I cannot but renew the invitation, I made in November last year, that the royals spend their honeymoon down here in Obudu Cattle Ranch, Calabar, Nigeria. Besides, it’s only proper that they will have a presidential company in Obudu, since our Goodluck Jonathan is currently doing a retreat there. Besides, some African advise on how to stay together is certainly necessary in other to guarantee the global wish of a happily there after union.\n\nI am also certain that our First Dame, must have presented my open letter to Willy and Katy. Since she’s leading a high-powered delegation of African First Ladies to the wedding. I just hope that she kept her mouth shot and took no umbrella! However, presented below is the said invitation and I hope you will gladly consider it:\n\nHoneymoon in Obudu for William and Kate?\n\nTo the Imperial Prince William and Princess (to be) Kate,\n\nWarm compliments on the announcement of your royal engagement. As a citizen of the commonwealth and one of your ancestors’ former docile subjects, it is with inexpressible joy that I salute you. I wish to propose a change of plans – on behalf of many concerned Nigerians – to have your post-nuptial vacation in Nigeria’s Obudu Cattle Ranch.\n\nIt is sad enough that you proposed to Kate in a holiday in Kenya, last October. Obama is from Kenya; his first visit was to Ghana. Enough, Nigerians can stand no longer this snobbery! Consequently to complete the African cycle, it is inevitable that you honeymoon in the continent’s most populous nation. Your majesty, we will raise a ‘mammoth’ crowd to persuade you to come to Naija. Already plans have reached an ‘advanced stage’, in the collection of a billion signatures that will dwarf Daniel Kanu’s Youths Earnestly Ask for Abacha million man march in March.\n\nDo not mind those who are already peddling bad luck for you and your bride. Haven’t you heard that we have Goodluck and Patience in abundance in Nigeria? Besides our religious leaders do not curse, they only bless. As such I assure you more prayers down here than the gaffe of that cockney Bishop. If you need guarantees for a long married life, am sure you will get many spiritual realities in Nigeria.\n\nWhy must you come to Obudu? That’s really does not require an answer. I’ll rather you ask why wouldn’t you come? You see, we love life. According to the epistle of the apostle of rebranding, we are good people, great nation. We also love to celebrate. It does not matter if it’s a wedding or a funeral. The main thing is that it’s an opportunity to enjoy.\n\nAsk your granny – Elizabeth – and she will testify to our hospitality. We spent a stingy 3 billion naira in 2003 for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM); I can assure you that if you come to Obudu in 2011, that sum will be tripled. I don’t understand why the consensus northern president should have allowed the Queen of England and Head of the Commonwealth to rid in an ordinary BMW. This time around we will place an order for a custom-built Rolls-Royce; fitted with oye-pumping air-conditioner and resistant to any rocket-launcher. In our country, we do not fear any economic recession according to the professor of CBN. Unlike your clan, who are constantly crying about taxpayers’ maintaining jobless royals, here we gladly maintain a surplus political class.\n\nThe reasons are not farfetched. A committee of highly intelligent ministers has to be set up and most probably chaired by the First Dame. The organisation really requires a lot of work and as such special advisers, assistant special bag-carriers, senior minor assistants have to be appointed. Then they all have to be inaugurated in Abuja. This entails a great ‘national sacrifice’ to leave their posh homes and camp like school boys in Hilton or Sheraton. Afterwards, the law breakers in the halls of sham have to exercise their over-nose function. This means that some oil has to seep to avoid unnecessary friction. Then the plan proper begins.\n\nWhat are your favourite colours? This is absolutely essential, because aso ebi has to be made. Don’t even think that because you’ll have a royal reception after the wedding in England will stop us from hosting one. We will show you how to party. If you need an advance insight, check up what Turai did for her daughters. That’s the Nigerian style. If your prime minister thinks that a mere one-day bank holiday is impressive enough, then wait till you come around. We will have a week-long work free day to settle Christians, Moslems and traditionalists.\n\nSecurity has to be provided. Don’t mind those ‘disgruntled elements’ who peddle falsehood about Nigeria. We are the safest place in the world. You see, kidnapping and the militancy is just a passing phase. The security vote for the Obudu vacation will be in pounds sterling. Since our gap-toothed general will in charge of security, you have nothing to fear.\n\nAlso be ready for an unending litany of ‘courtesy calls’ from the governors, their wives, local government chairmen and councillors. And as a royalty, you also have to teach Kate how to rub shoulders with our ‘traditional rulers’. By the way, don’t be surprised if you receive plenty titles, it is part of our ‘federal character’. All the prominent chiefs from the six geo-political zones have to ‘rotate’ their visits in order ensure the survival of our ‘nascent democracy’.\n\nI could continue but for the fact that since this is a mere proposal, you don’t honestly think that I will put all my plans in ink. I don’t want my ideas to be hijacked by some powerful people and ‘rebranded’ as theirs. So as soon the mobilisation fees – see attached – rests in my account, I will intimate you of the comprehensive plans.\n\nFor now, good-bye.\n\nNwachukwu Egbunike\n\nNwachukwu Egbunike outlines his day at the Polling Unit in Agbowo, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Photo credits: Damisi Pikuda.\n\n10:05am\n\nI walked to the polling station near my neighborhood. There were seven officials present. A lady accredits me in less than a minute. She took my Voters Card, and went through their list. Ticks against my name and picture; then hands it over to the second official who assigns a number to me.The third official (standing) inflicts an indelible blue ink on my left thumb and tells me to come back by 12:00 noon to vote. Behind these three INEC staff, were two police officers (male and female) and another guy, sharing the same bench with them.\n\nOn the left is a cubicle that is not so closed to induce suspicion and not so open to assure privacy of voters. Just in front of this white cubicle, is the ‘Voters Bag’. The officials are sheltered under a fairly large canopy.\n\nI cracked jokes with the officials but frankly there were quite courteous and I left the polling station in less than a minute after my arrival. All is quiet and serene.\n\n11.57 am\n\nI went back to my Pulling Unit (PU), long queues already. Voting is yet to start. There are two separate lines; one for men and another for women. I think the reason is obvious, this neighborhood is thickly Muslim.\n\n12.05 pm\n\n“Pretending” reading a novel because I can’t in this world concentrate. The noise around is amazing, people talking about many things to each other. I can’t understand much, since they speak in Yoruba. However, a guy around me helps by translating.\n\n12.10\n\nA Catholic Priest arrives to vote. He walks and takes his place in the long line behind. What an example!\n\n12.12 pm\n\nA fellow – I doubt if he is an official, explains the voting procedure. The people are quite attentive.\n\n12:16 pm\n\nINEC staff addresses crowd. Seems the elections are about to commence. He says, ‘no campaigning, no bribery.’ The crowd are inpatient, they shout him down. No need explaining the procedure to them again, someone has already done so, besides they voted last week.\n\n12.20 pm\n\nThe male policeman goes down the queue and calls out the Catholic Priest to join the group of the elderly already seated under the INEC canopy. Surprisingly nobody protests although majority there are Muslims.Methinks both – the priest for not assuming a place of honor without being called to it, and the crowd, for respecting one who is not of their faith – deserves commendation.\n\n12:30 pm\n\nAn agadi ‘elderly’ woman, she should be above 70 and bent over by arthritis just finished voting. She is lead out by two young women, probably her grandchildren.\n\n12:45 pm\n\nThe Assistant Presiding Officer (Polls Clerk) alerts the two policemen about two suspicious looking young guys. The policemen take the lead and confront the two fellows. Overheard the o/c telling the guys that, ‘no discussion or persuasion during voting’.\n\n12.50 pm\n\nAn umbrella sprouts before me. Two guys who had not been there when I came, arrive and said that they had been on the queue. I asked from the elderly man standing before me and he confirmed their claims. However I am grateful for the shade of this branded umbrella of a beer ad – “one people, one beer!” Other umbrella’s carry are marked with different logos, like the one in the picture below.\n\n1:10 pm\n\nIt’s my turn and I move up to the INEC canopy. I am given the ballot paper and move into the cubicle to ‘press my thumb’. Prior to that, I asked the INEC staff, to identify a lady standing nearby, she was wearing a branded shirt but I could not read the prints. He responds that’s she is from Transition Monitoring Group (TMG).\n\nI cast my vote and then had a chat with the TMG madam.\n\n4.45 pm\n\nReturn to the PU, collation of results in progress.\n\n4.47 pm\n\nPresiding Clerk dismantles the cubicle used by voters to thumbing their ballot papers.\n\n4.48 pm\n\nParty agents sign Result Sheet. ANPP signs first, followed by that of PDP and others do likewise.\n\n4.50 pm\n\nPresiding officer signs and stamps Result Sheet in the presence of all – party agents, election observers, police, civil defense corp and some voters.\n\n4.52 pm\n\nPresiding officer gives duplicate of signed forms to party agents, election observers and policewoman. Afterwards TMG staff leaves, the party agents follow suit.\n\n5.00 pm\n\nINEC officials and police also depart.\n\nSOME INFORMATION ON THE RESULT SHEET\n\nNo of voters in register: 690\n\nAccredited Voters: 255\n\nNo in queue before voting commenced: 245\n\nNo of ballot papers: 600\n\nNo of total valid votes (sum total of all parties) 245\n\nELECTION RESULTS\n\nParty No of Votes\n\nACN 26\n\nANPP 2\n\nAPS 1\n\nCPC 67\n\nPDC 2\n\nPDP 144\n\nPPP 1\n\nSDMP 1\n\nNwachukwu Egbunike\n\nThis is no time to sit on the fence, no time to tarry. The Nigerian elections finally kicked off last Saturday after a break and quench pre-flight. Despite all that has been said about Jega and INEC, last weekend parliamentary polls confirmed what has been tagged the Nigerian revolution through the ballot box. Many of us who stood up for Jega’s integrity and competence have been vindicated.\n\nWhat is as clear as daylight was that the parliamentary polls last weekend were the most credible election Nigeria has ever witnessed. For too long we have chanted that June 12, 1993 elections was Naija’s best. With a ting of latent sadness that perhaps we may never witness such clean and clear polls again. However, Jega’s INEC stood up to the test and has taken a clear lead in showing us that things can be done right. That it was better to postpone rather than endorse a fraud.\n\nThe presidential and governorship elections will take place soon; that is no news. However, the stakes are high for Nigerians will once again line up in support of candidates that they hope will deliver.\n\nThe oft-mouthed cliché, that Africa needs strong institutions not strong men, will form the basis for my voting. The four tenancy contenders of Aso Rock are Goodluck, Buhari, Ribadu and Shekarau.\n\nI must admit that I do not have much respect for parties because Nigeria politics lacks ideological hues. For as much as the PDP has dominated power and with their perceived atrocities over the years, I cannot spot any difference between them and the rest. ACN is practically a one-man business. The CPC came into limelight no sooner than Buhari adopted it. ANPP has always been an AGIP party.\n\nAs Nigeria Decides, I’ll vote for those who have translated their promises from mere words to deeds – irrespective party affiliation. My vote will go therefore, not to those who verbalize the ideal but have done nothing to concertize it. Those who have given me the courage to hope again. This is my take as Nigeria Decides!"
