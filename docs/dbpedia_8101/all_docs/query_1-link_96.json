        "text": "The United States Department of Justice has alleged that billions of naira stolen from the Presidential Amnesty Programme by a former head of the office, Mr. Kingsley Kuku, were transferred to bank accounts in the United States where they were laundered and used to purchase airplanes to start Air Peace as well as luxury homes and vehicles.\n\nKuku served as Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta Affairs and was Chairman of the Presidential Amnesty Office under President Goodluck Jonathan, who served from 2010-2015.\n\nAir Peace, which was launched in 2013, is Nigeria’s largest carrier with a fleet size of about 23 airplanes. The revelation by the US DOJ clearly poses multiple challenges and risks for the airline if the US government successfully prosecutes the charges of money laundering in court.\n\nTHEWILL can report exclusively that the US DOJ which has been conducting a discreet investigation into Kuku and Air Peace, according to our sources with knowledge of development, formally wrote to the Nigerian government under the Treaty for Mutual Legal Assistance between both countries and asked for the transfer of the case files of investigations conducted on Mr. Kuku, who coincidentally was deported from the United States last year by the Department of Homeland Security over immigration fraud, Allen Onyema, the airlines’ CEO, Prince Chibudom Nwuche, a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, who allegedly laundered at least $8m from the Amnesty programme and other individuals and companies linked to Onyema.\n\n￼\n\nPrince Chibudom Nwuche\n\nThe United States government describes Mr. Onyema as Kuku’s business partner, who laundered at least $44m through US bank accounts.\n\nThe DOJ in another letter about three weeks ago asked Nigeria for bank account records of “Air Peace Limited, Ifechukwu Allen Athan Onyema, Tarere Vivenne Kuku alias Nnamani Chika Vivienne, All Times Peace Media, Every Child Limited, Foundation of Ethnic Harmony in Nigeria and Allen Onyema and Company, Global Spectrum Energy Services Plc” amongst others.\n\n“Records should be for the period between April 1, 2010, and the present…” the DOJ said in the letter seen by THEWILL.\n\nIn November last year, the United States DOJ in a statement announced Mr. Onyema’s indictment and charge for bank fraud and money laundering for moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes.\n\nIt also said the airline’s Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, was charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme.\n\n“Onyema allegedly leveraged his status as a prominent business leader and airline executive while using falsified documents to commit fraud,” said U.S. Attorney Byung J. “BJay” Pak. “We will diligently protect the integrity our banking system from being corrupted by criminals, even when they disguise themselves in a cloak of international business.”\n\nRobert J. Murphy, the Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Atlanta Field Division commented on the indictment, “Allen Onyema’s status as a wealthy businessman turned out to be a fraud. He corrupted the U.S. banking system, but his trail of deceit and trickery came to a skidding halt. DEA would like to thank the many law enforcement partners and the subsequent prosecution by the U.S. Attorney’s Office who aided in making this investigation a success.”\n\n“This case is a prime example of why IRS-CI seeks to partner and leverage its expertise in an effort to thwart those seeking to exploit our nation’s financial system,” said Thomas J. Holloman, IRS-Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta Field Office.\n\n“With the importance of our banking system to the movement of money around the world, those attempting to use intricate schemes to commit bank fraud through the use of falsified documents and other means should know that the odds are now heavily stacked against them as law enforcement is combining its talents to protect the sanctity and integrity of the nation’s financial system.”\n\n“Onyema setup various innocent sounding multi-million dollar asset purchases which were nothing more than alleged fronts for his scam,” said acting Special Agent in Charge Robert Hammer, who oversees HSI operations in Georgia and Alabama. “I’m proud to be part of a team of law enforcement agencies that come together to identify and attack criminals that attempt to profit from the exploitation of our nation’s financial systems.”\n\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Pak, the indictment, and other information presented in court: Onyema, is the founder and Chairman of several organizations that purport to promote peace across Nigeria, including the Foundation for Ethnic Harmony, International Center for Non-Violence and Peace Development, and All-Time Peace Media Communications Limited.\n\nIt said beginning in 2010, Onyema began travelling frequently to Atlanta, where he opened several personal and business bank accounts. Between 2010 and 2018, over $44.9 million was allegedly transferred into his Atlanta-based accounts from foreign sources.\n\nIn years following the founding of Air Peace, he traveled to the United States and purchased multiple airplanes for the airline. However, over $3 million of the funds used to purchase the aircraft allegedly came from bank accounts for Foundation for Ethnic Harmony, International Center for Non-Violence and Peace Development, All-Time Peace Media Communications Limited, and Every Child Limited.\n\nBeginning in approximately May 2016, Onyema, together with Eghagha, allegedly used a series of export letters of credit to cause banks to transfer more than $20 million into Atlanta-based bank accounts controlled by Onyema. The letters of credit were purportedly to fund the purchase of five separate Boeing 737 passenger planes by Air Peace. The letters were supported by documents such as purchase agreements, bills of sale, and appraisals proving that Air Peace was purchasing the aircraft from Springfield Aviation Company LLC, a business registered in Georgia.\n\nHowever, the supporting documents were fake — Springfield Aviation Company LLC, which is owned by Onyema and managed by a person with no connection to the aviation business, never owned the aircraft, and the company that allegedly drafted the appraisals did not exist. Eghagha allegedly participated in this scheme as well, directing the Springfield Aviation manager to sign and send false documents to banks and even using the manager’s identity to further the fraud. After Onyema received the money in the United States, he allegedly laundered over $16 million of the proceeds of the fraud by transferring it to other accounts, the DOJ said.\n\n“Allen Ifechukwu Athan Onyema, 56, of Lagos, Nigeria, and Ejiroghene Eghagha, 37, of Lagos, Nigeria, were indicted on November 19, 2019, on one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, three counts of bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit credit application fraud, and three counts of credit application fraud. Additionally, Onyema was charged with 27 counts of money laundering, and Eghagha was charged with one count of aggravated identity theft.”\n\nSource: The WILL\n\nSays, “I fought and won Nigeria’s case against P&ID despite frustrations”\n\nJust as Nigeria secured a landmark victory in its pursuit to overturn a $10 billion judgement awarded against it in a case against Process and Industrial Developments (P&ID), a former attorney general and commissioner for justice in Lagos State, Olasupo Shasore SAN, has denied working against the country on the case.\n\nIt was gathered that the case will either go back to arbitration based on the new evidence or both parties will now settle out of court.\n\nIt will be recalled that on January 31, 2017, a tribunal ruled that Nigeria should pay P&ID $6.6 billion as damages, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest at 7 percent.\n\nThe current outstanding amount is estimated at $10 billion. The Federal Government had approached the court to establish that the contract was awarded on illegal terms.\n\nNigeria’s lawyers told the court in July that P&ID officials paid bribes to get the contract.\n\nP&ID reportedly entered a gas supply and processing agreement with Nigeria in 2010.\n\nIn a statement entitled; “Allegations in the P&ID v FRN Case, which he personally signed and made available to journalists, Olasupo Shasore said that “in the last 24 hours, I have been urged to break my deliberate silence about the efforts of the Federal Government of Nigeria to find recourse against the arbitral award procured by P&ID based on a corrupt and fraudulent contract.\n\n“My choice of silence has been the result of my own\n\nhigh sense of responsibility as well as my commitment to the professional duty, which I undertook in representing the Federal Government in this case.\n\n“I am relieved that the corrupt and fraudulent foundation of this case is affirmed in the recent ruling, though I am disappointed that part of the case made for that result was a case against me based on demonstrably false statements, unfounded innuendoes and spiteful personal attacks on my professional conduct and reputation.”\n\nShasore stated that he was instructed in the matter and accepted the instructions on behalf of his firm and to the\n\nknowledge of his partners in late 2012 and that he made every effort to defend and vindicate his client\n\nat every stage with very few tools and with minimal support from within the government itself.\n\nThe accomplished legal practitioner explained that he represented Nigeria up until the liability stage in the arbitration, saying that he did not represent Nigeria in the damages stage of the arbitration, which he said meant that he was not involved when the huge sum of damages were awarded against the country.\n\nHe added that the complete records will show the series of steps that he took to defend Nigeria and the several results, which he said he secured in that effort at various stages.\n\n“None of these is consistent with the unfounded allegations that I failed to present the best available defense.\n\n“With very little or no cooperation from relevant government officials at the time, I filed a jurisdiction objection that potentially could and should indeed have terminated the case in favour of Nigeria because it was clear to us from the beginning that the contract was a scheme against Nigeria.\n\n“When the then Nigerian officials failed to supply documents or any witness to defend their case, I fought liability by enlisting the support of the legal adviser of NNPC who gave evidence to the best of his knowledge when everyone else with knowledge, refused to do so.\n\n“I instructed the UK firm of Stephenson Harwood a respected international arbitration team and a\n\nleading Barrister to attempt to set aside the award on liability in England.\n\n“We overcame numerous hurdles and faced a hostile tribunal, which relied on the testimony of a principal witness who had died before the hearing and whose testimony should have been discounted. It is on record that I fought hard for the tribunal to dispense with that evidence,” the statement read.\n\nShasore revealed that he was happy that the “falsity of that testimony has now been recorded in the High Court in England.”\n\nThe ex-AG said further that this was the ground on which he took the matter to the Federal High Court in Nigeria, which he said was the proper seat of the arbitration and successfully obtained an order setting aside the liability\n\naward.\n\nHe said in the statement that there was no basis to proceed to the damages hearing since the liability had already been set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n“Indeed, Nigeria continues to rely on this order in\n\nthe proceedings in the United States. In addition, I obtained an injunction restraining the parties and the tribunal from proceeding with the arbitration.\n\n“Much issue has been made about the legal fees paid. This was payment to two law firms and not exceptional or unusual in the context of such a dispute.\n\n“In fact, in order to extract the best possible case for Nigeria, it was from these fees that expenses were paid to ensure attendance at hearings and meetings in the UK by witnesses for Nigeria,” he said.\n\nWhile saying that even though he reserved the right to respond to “further falsehoods against me as they are published,” he said that he was however a truly patriotic Nigerian, and remained willing and committed to assisting Nigeria “in the numerous stages still required to successfully defend this dispute.”\n\n“My commitment and professional integrity to always act in the best interest of Nigeria, who has been victimized by fraud and corruption, remains unshaken,” he said.\n\nBy Tope Fasua\n\nLast Sunday 31st of August, Daily Trust published a scathing article from one of her columnists, Ilyasu Gadu.\n\nI needn’t repeat the title of that famous article on the personality of Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, but suffice to say that the article wasn’t very flattering of the Chief, who himself had had many terrible things to say about everyone depending on what side of the divide he finds himself at each point in time.\n\nChief Femi is a handful.\n\nI recall when he boasted of having used Igbo women aplenty, including the wife of an Igbo icon.\n\nThe next thing, he was getting married to an Igbo woman, and suddenly became an avatar for Biafra.\n\nI think people like him should be very used to trouble because they stoke a lot of it.\n\nIt is even a wonder that he would be shaken by the current problem, which he precipitated with his brutal put-down of a correspondent of Daily Trust.\n\nI hear he is suing Daily Trust for N6 billion and if it is true, he is just baiting more trouble for himself.\n\nI can tell him he will come off with a bloodier nose.\n\nMy concern is not about Chief Femi though.\n\nIt is about the reaction to the article by reading public, especially netizens (young people who read the news, and live their lives, on the internet).\n\nDaily Trust had initially published the article without attribution, but any discerning mind would have been able to tell that it could not be an editorial.\n\nEven after the article was updated and attributed to Ilyasu Gadu, many shared same and captioned it “Daily Trust Hit Back”.\n\nMany of my friends from Southern Nigeria buttressed their points by claiming that the Cross River State reporter must have been commissioned by Daily Trust to ask the ‘embarrassing’ question.\n\nIt was just too bad that a certain Ilyasu wrote the article.\n\nTo some, the ‘north’ had spoken.\n\nSuddenly Fani-Kayode became a symbol of Southern Nigeria’s struggles.\n\nThey (the north) were out to get him – through Daily Trust.\n\nThe situation escalated after he apologized in a video.\n\n‘Why can’t they forgive him?’, they asked.\n\nEven when I tried to explain to some, that the article could have been sent days before Femi apologized, some had already made up their minds.\n\nThat the article was syndicated and published at least by The Cable, was of no interest to these Nigerians.\n\nI was shocked at the reactions and the thought processes of many young people.\n\nI argued for a bit with a good friend who tried to make me understand that it was an APC vs PDP affair.\n\nFemi has been critical of Buhari, and so Daily Trust must have been commissioned to embarrass him by APC – after all Daily Trust is a ‘northern newspaper’.\n\nNow this is where I get off the bus.\n\nI think many people in southern Nigeria unwittingly give whatever power they have left, over to the mythical united north where anybody that speaks must have consulted the whole north and therefore represents them.\n\nI tried to convince someone recently that even the Northern Elders Forum does not represent everyone from the north of Nigeria, just as Afenifere or Ohaneze Ndigbo do not represent everyone from the South West or South East respectively.\n\nI think this idea of attributing too much cohesion and importance to any statement from the north has unfortunately been transmitted to younger generations.\n\nI propose however, a situation where young Nigerians see everybody rather than this us versus them.\n\nThe north, just as the south, has people with disparate opinions, and indeed people with caustic pens.\n\nNo specific attribute is any particular people’s preserve.\n\nThe north has accomplished as well as up-and-coming intellectuals that you may denigrate at your own risk.\n\nThe north is full of human beings with their failings and doubts, just as the south.\n\nNo culture is perfect, and so we will see flaws in the cultures of the north, as well as the south of Nigeria.\n\nIn truth, geographically, there is nowhere to draw a boundary between north and south.\n\nInstead, the two broad regions flow into each other.\n\nThe other day a friend said Nigeria should be shared into two, using Rivers Niger and Benue as boundary.\n\nI looked at the map online and realized that most of Adamawa, Taraba, Kogi, Kebbi and Kwara States with all their multitudes of nation and tribes, were south of Rivers Niger and Benue.\n\nI wrote in support of Daily Trust as I am part of the team even though not a permanent staff of the organization.\n\nI may have written this before but a time like this makes one repeat the story. I started writing for the group while a banker sometimes in 2003/4.\n\nI was encouraged to so do by the then GM Finance, Mallam Shehu.\n\nWhen I went for my Masters in the UK in 2005/6 they called me that they will be commencing a new brand called Sunday Trust and offered me a column.\n\nI was initially afraid of being unable to keep up with a weekly column but I took the challenge.\n\nI have hardly missed a column since then.\n\nDaily Trust also offered to pay me a token even though I didn’t ask.\n\nIt was then N16,000 per month, reviewed after some years to N25,000 per month, and then N40,000 per month and I think later N50,000.\n\nOf late, they let columnists know that these payments must reduce because of the effects of COVID.\n\nEveryone agreed with the Management.\n\nI also write widely for some newspapers and magazines, but none of them have offered me a dime.\n\nI have also never had to call Daily Trust for one day, asking for the payment.\n\nThey fulfill their obligations to me, like clockwork.\n\nI know many newspapers in Nigeria who don’t believe in paying columnists even though they make tons of money from adverts.\n\nThey usually claim to have ‘given you a platform’.\n\nThis reminds one of the troubles that our journalists go through.\n\nMany are corrupt because their publishers claim to have ‘given them a platform’ to make money.\n\nThey never get paid sometimes for years.\n\nThey become desperate.\n\nWith the standard that Daily Trust has shown me, I believe this newspaper will do better than many of its peers.\n\nMedia Trust Group I believe has more integrity than most.\n\nOf course, no organization is perfect.\n\nSo Daily Trust will certainly have its failings.\n\nI think it is high time for those who have deliberately ignored this newspaper’s meteoric rise and standards, to sit up and take notice.\n\nEven though I have been called names in the past because of my relationship with DT, I am proud to associate with the brand.\n\nThey have not let me down.\n\nIs DT in the pockets of Buhari?\n\nWell, I don’t know, but I doubt.\n\nI recall when their office was raided by Buhari’s DSS with many computers confiscated.\n\nNo sitting government raids a newspaper that it has in its pockets.\n\nI must also say that when I was too gung-ho about Buhari pre-2015, some of the people who knew him too well within DT cautioned me in a friendly manner, even though they didn’t expatiate on why the concept of a Buhari Messianism was fatally flawed.\n\nI wish Fani-Kayode the best with his suit.\n\nBut I have seen so many personal opinions about many people in many newspapers.\n\nI should think the opinion piece writer bears the primary liability while the newspaper could be joined in a suit.\n\nWell, like Yorubas say ‘taa ba fa gburu, gburu a fa’gbo’.\n\nIn other words, Femi is tugging at what may be bigger than his gargantuan ego.\n\nProphet Emmanuel Omale, who claims to be the spiritual guide of the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, has sued First City Monument Bank Plc for N5bn.\n\nIn the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2020, Omale, who is the General Overseer, Divine Hand of God Prophetic Ministry, said FCMB falsely reported to the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit that N570m was paid into his church account.\n\nHe said the allegations led to accusations that the money was used in purchasing a house in Dubai for Magu.\n\nThe statement of claim read in part, “Sometime on or about the 6th day of July 2020 the former acting Chairman of the EFCC, Mr. Ibrahim Magu, was arrested and summoned to the Presidential Villa, Abuja, to appear before the Presidential Investigation Committee on the Alleged Mismanagement of the EFCC, Federal Government Recovered Assets and Finances From May 2015 to May 2020.\n\n“That one of the key allegations levelled at the Presidential Investigation Committee against Mr. Ibrahim Magu, was that the 2nd Claimant (Prophet Omale) fraudulently and corruptly purchased a real estate property for Mr. Ibrahim Magu in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates with the said sum of N573, 228, 04 allegedly credited as an inflow into the 1st Claimant’s (church’s) Corporate Current Account No: 1486743019 in the year 2016.”The claimant stated that due to the investigation and negative media reports, his family was exposed to public ridicule and their spiritual calling was insulted.\n\nThe cleric noted that he and his wife Deborah Omale appeared before a Presidential Investigation Committee at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on August 10, 11, and 12, 2020.\n\nHe said they were grilled for hours on their alleged roles in respect of the sum of N573m used in fraudulently and corruptly purchasing a real estate property for Magu in Dubai.\n\nHe said they all denied the allegations of fraud, adding that he never bought any property for Magu when grilled by the panel.\n\nHe added that they were accompanied by their lead Senior Counsel, Gordy Uche (SAN), and a team of four senior lawyers who were paid N15million naira to appear and represent them for three days.\n\nOmale said the presidential panel in the course of its hearing also invited the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of FCMB, Adam Nuru, who appeared before the committee and testified.\n\n“That Mr. Adam Nuru in his testimony informed the Presidential Investigation Committee that the said N573M was credited to the bank account of the 1st claimant (church) in error and that the error was not discovered by the defendant for over four years,” the cleric said.\n\nOmale said they paid the law firm of Gordy Uche (SAN) & Co., the sum of N75m to institute the suit against FCMB and attached a copy of the receipt for the said professional fees to the statement of claim.\n\nHe said in all, he had lost N180.5m due to payment of legal fees and personal losses.\n\nOmale, therefore, sought a declaration of the court that the FCMB negligently breached the fiduciary duty of care it owes the claimants by its false automated report to the NFIU of a suspicious credit inflow of N573m into the church account.\n\nThe statement of claim further read, “The sum of N5,000,000, 000.00 (Five Billion Naira) being exemplary, aggravated, special and general damages against the defendant for the negligent breach of its fiduciary duty of care to the claimants by its false automated report to the NFIU of a suspicious credit inflow of N573, 228, 040. 41 into the 1st claimant’s corporate current account number1486743019 with the defendant, which has occasioned grave damages to the claimants.”"
