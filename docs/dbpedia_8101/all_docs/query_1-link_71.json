        "text": "By Eric Elezuo\n\nBillionaire business man, Femi Otedola, has added yet another feather to his crown of grace with the recent appointment as a Non Executive Director by FBN Holdings, the parent company of one of Nigeria’s leading financial inclusion banks, FirstBank of Nigeria Plc. The appointment was formalised during the 11th Annual General Meeting of the company.\n\nThe appointment, which took effect on August 14, 2023, subject to the shareholders’ approval, was contained in a corporate filing signed by the Holdings’ acting secretary, Mr. Adewale Arogundade.\n\nHis appointment, according to the bank is based on his reputation as a “dyed-in-the-wool and visionary entrepreneur whose energy is directed at transforming enterprises and putting them on the path of growth”.\n\nPart of the statement described Otedola as “A strong leader with a track record of achievements in business and always aiming to make things better and adding value in areas where pioneers have trod.\n\nIt added: “He was thrust into the public’s consciousness with his foray into the downstream sector of the oil industry when he started Zenon Petroleum and Gas Limited.\n\n“Zenon disrupted and redefined the standards in the sector, and to ensure that his very high standards are met, he also invested in storage, shipping, insurance brokerage and port agency and petroleum retail outlets building a formidable, value-driven presence along the downstream value chain.\n\n“In his quest to grow his foothold in the sector, he initiated the purchase of majority shareholding in the then African Petroleum Plc in May 2007 and joined the board as chairman of the board on 25 May 2007.”\n\nIn December 2021, Otedola became the single largest shareholder after acquiring 7.57 percent of the issued shares capital of FBNH, a position he maintained till July 2023.\n\nThe son of a prolific politician, who rose to become the governor of Lagos State, the Geregu Power Plc Chairman, simply addressed as Femi Otedola (CON), is a focused and determined man, a man, who made his choice from day one, and has refused to be derailed. He has carved a niche for himself in the prolific world of entrepreneurship.\n\nBorn on November 4, 1962, in Ibadan to the family of the late Sir Michael Otedola, a former governor of Lagos State, Otedola is a definition of everything good, positive and encouraging. He has lived his 60 years representing the very essence of living, affecting lives as a philanthropist, developing careers and manpower as a businessman, industrialists and entrepreneur, and raising biological children, who has stood their own in the society. There is hardly anywhere this tall, handsome phenomenon of a personality can be faulted.\n\nThe billionaire businessman started his education at the University of Lagos Staff School before attending Olivet Baptist High School.\n\nA former chairman of Forte Oil Plc, the Chancellor of St Augustine University, Epe, Lagos, is the founder of Zenon Petroleum and Gas Ltd, and the owner of a number of other businesses across shipping, real estate and finance. He has recently invested in power generation as part of the liberalisation of the sector in Nigeria.\n\nKnown for never settling for less; known for his abhorrence to mediocrity, the Geregu Power Plc chairman, scored yet another top as he chose his 60th birthday to fulfill a lifelong ambition of cruising on the most expensive boat in the world, the Christina Onassis. It has been reported that while growing up, Otedola’s childhood fantasy has remained to cruise the yacht made exclusively for the best of the best in the society. The yacht, owned by late Greek billionaire, Aristotle Onassis. is presently housing Otedola and his close and dear family members as they transverse exclusively across the most beautiful islands and shores the universe is known with.\n\nOtedola heard about Onassis, the Greek Shipping guru, at the age of 13, and adopted him as his role model. It was therefore with nostalgia that he looked forward to the day he would cruise his. So, his 60th birthday presented a veritable opportunity to fulfill this objective, the amount of Pounds splashed notwithstanding.\n\nLIFE AND TIMES OF FEMI OTEDOLA\n\nThe man, who has homes in Lagos, Abuja, Dubai, London and New York City has a much impressive existence since he set out to take the bull by the horns in the field of enterprise. This is as chronicled by wikipedia. In 2003, having identified an opportunity in the fuel retail market, Otedola secured the finance to set up Zenon Petroleum and Gas Ltd, a petroleum products marketing and distribution company.\n\nAs owner and chairman of Zenon, in 2004 he invested N15 billion in downstream infrastructure development and acquired storage depots at Ibafon, Apapa as well as four cargo vessels, amounting to a combined total storage capacity of 147,000 metric tonnes. The same year he acquired a fleet of 100 DAF fuel-tanker trucks for N1.4 billion.\n\nBy 2005, Zenon controlled a major share of the Nigerian diesel market, supplying fuel to most of the major manufacturers in the country including Dangote Group, Cadbury, Coca-Cola, Nigerian Breweries, MTN, Unilever, Nestle and Guinness.\n\nIn March 2007, it was announced that ten banks had approved a syndicated loan of US$1.5 billion (N193.5 billion) to Zenon as working capital to build the largest premium motor spirit storage facility in Africa. Later that year Zenon acquired a 28.7 per cent stake in African Petroleum, one of Nigeria’s largest fuel marketers. Zenon also invested across the financial sector, becoming the largest shareholder in a number of Nigerian banks including Zenith Bank and United Bank for Africa (UBA). As well as diesel, Zenon also became an important player in the kerosene market.\n\nIn 2012, Zenon was among a number of companies named in a report into an alleged fuel subsidy scam. According to the report Zenon owed the government $1.4 million. It was further reported that Farouk Lawan, the Nigerian legislator who compiled the report, had apparently been filmed collecting $500,000 of a supposed total sum of $3 million from Femi Otedola to remove Zenon from the list. It subsequently emerged that Otedola had previously reported Lawan’s harassment and demands for bribes to the State Security Services, who had orchestrated a sting operation. Lawan was charged with corruption in February 2013.\n\nIn 2007, Otedola was appointed chairman and chief executive of Africa Petroleum through the acquisition of a controlling stake in the business. In December that year he personally acquired a further 29.3 per cent of the company for N40 billion. A merger of this personal holding with Zenon’s brought Otedola’s total stake to 55.3 per cent.\n\nFollowing Otedola’s entry into the company African Petroleum’s share price rose sharply, increasing the market capitalisation from N36 billion to N217 billion in six months. In 2008, in response to public concerns over the availability and pricing of kerosene, African Petroleum launched an initiative to saturate the market and sell fuel at N50 per litre from more than 500 service stations across Nigeria.\n\nIn March 2009, Otedola became the second Nigerian after Aliko Dangote to appear on the Forbes list of dollar-denominated billionaires, with an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion. In October 2009, Otedola announced a move to upgrade African Petroleum’s liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage terminals in Lagos, Kano and Port Harcourt. Difficult economic conditions caused by the slump in world oil prices and credit squeeze of 2008–09 led African Petroleum to record a loss in 2009.\n\nIn December 2010, African Petroleum rebranded, changing its name to Forte Oil PLC. Otedola carried out a restructuring of the business, focusing on technology and improved corporate governance. Forte Oil returned to profit in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, as part of the Federal Government’s push to liberalise Nigeria’s ailing power sector, Otedola financed 57% of Forte Oil subsidiary Amperion Ltd, which acquired the 414 MW Geregu Power Plant for $132 million.\n\nForte’s improved financial position and diversification into power generation resulted in a 1,321 per cent rise in its share price during 2013. The first half of 2014 saw the company’s pre-tax profit more than double year-on-year to 4.19 billion naira ($25.7 million). Revenue growth for the whole year was 33 per cent. In November 2014, Otedola returned to the Forbes rich list having dropped off it following the fall in share price during 2009.\n\nIn September 2015 Forte Oil sold 17 per cent of its equity to Swiss commodity trader Mercuria Energy Group, giving Forte access to global commodity markets. The deal was thought to have given Otedola an estimated $200 million. In 2019, Femi Otedola sold Forte Oil Plc and announced plans to change focus from oil to power with his company, Geregu Power Plc.\n\nIn 1994, Otedola established CentreForce Ltd, specialising in finance, investments and trading. Otedola is also the owner of Swift Insurance.\n\nOtedola is Chief Executive and President of SeaForce Shipping Company Ltd and was at one point Nigeria’s largest ship owner after extending control over the distribution of diesel products. One of his ships, a flat bottomed bunker vessel with a storage capacity of 16,000 metric tonnes, was the first of its kind in Africa.\n\nIn January 2006, Otedola was appointed a non-executive director of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc, a multi-sectoral conglomerate established in 2004 by then-President Olusegun Obasanjo to respond to market opportunities requiring heavy capital investment in Nigeria and across sub-Saharan Africa. He held this post until February 2011.\n\nOtedola has made a number of real estate investments, including a N2.3 billion acquisition in February 2007 by Zenon of Stallion House in Victoria Island in Lagos, from the Federal Government. The following month he was appointed chairman of the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja and tasked with driving its expansion and upgrade to a seven star facility. He is the owner of FO Properties Ltd. Otedola has been reported to be a financier of the People’s Democratic Party and is said to have contributed N100 million to President Obasanjo’s re-election expenses in 2003. He has served as a member of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Council (NIPC) since 2004, and the same year was appointed to a committee tasked with developing commercial relations with South Africa. In 2011, Femi Otedola was appointed by President Goodluck Jonathan to Nigeria’s National Economic Management Team.\n\nIn 2020, Forte Oil rebranded to Adrova PLC.\n\nCurrently, as at October 2021, he was announced as the single largest shareholder (5.07%) of First bank PLC.\n\nHis philanthropic gestures have remained a reference point to other wealthy individuals. He is known to have made several donations to the Michael Otedola University Scholarship Scheme, which was established in 1985 to give underprivileged students in Lagos State access to higher education. In 2005 Zenon donated N200 million to the scheme’s fund. Since its inception the scheme has benefited more than 1,000 students.\n\nIn 2005, Otedola made a N300 million personal donation to the completion of the National Ecumenical Centre; Nigeria’s primary place of Christian worship, in Abuja. In 2007 he was among a group of donors who gave N200 million to the State Security Trust Fund in a drive to reduce crime in Lagos State. Later that year he donated N100 million to the Otedola College of Primary Education in Noforija, Epe. In 2008 he donated N80 million to the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Port Harcourt. He also promised and fulfilled his pledge of 25,000 dollars to the Super Eagles in the match against Algeria in the 2019 AFCON.\n\nIn September, 2022, Otedola was appointed as a member of the National Peace Committee (NPC), headed by former Head of State, Abdulsalam Abubakar, ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nIt is not an understate to say that Otedola is highly blessed of God with wisdom and entrepreneurial skills to make the desired change in the everchanging business world.\n\nAn unrepentant dotting father, husband and family man, Otedola is married to Nana, and has three daughters and one son. They are Tolani, a singer, Florence Ifeoluwa and Elizabeth Temi, and a son, Fewa. Florence Otedola, aka DJ Cuppy, is a Disc Jockey and music producer, as well as a tourism ambassador for Nigeria while Temi is an actress, a style blogger and aspiring designer.\n\nCongratulations sir on this new phase of achievement\n\nBy Eric Elezuo\n\nSome call him highly philosophical, some call him the entrepreneur with a difference while a lot of others refer to him as the czar of real estate. But one thing is certain, the splendid octogenarian, Aare Kola Oyefeso, the Aare Gbo Gbo Gbo of Remoland, is many things combined in one package.\n\nHis trajectory in the world of business, social impact and human relations culminated in the show of class that was exhibited at the prestigious Harbour Point Event Centre, where the who’s who in the industrialisation, real estate and general merchandise gathered to celebrate his entry into the world of the octogenarians. It was his 80th birthday.\n\nA writer of no mean repute, Aare Oyefeso was born on July 7, 1944, and has remained instrumental to the development of the nation and economic growth of various sectors, with special emphasised to his primary field of realtor.\n\nHe is the president of KOKTO Group and the Balogun of Ode Remo, in his native Ogun State, Aare Oyefeso is a social figure of note, who has held the presidential position of the influential Lagos County Club, leaving behind a trail of development, administrative stability and extreme welfare measures for members and sympathizers of the club. He is presently a member of the Board of Trustees of the Club, contributing quota after quota to its general wellbeing.\n\nHe has often and on been celebrated for a leadership characteristics that has been second to none as well as for unwavering dedication and commitment to building human and physical structures that can stand the test of time, and lending long helping hand in the area of philanthropy, generosity and excellence.\n\nApart from various work of philanthropy and helping in building the entrepreneurial fabrics of the Nigerian economy, Aare Oyefeso is an ardent writer, and is credited with many books, journals and articles including Unraveling the Puzzles of Earthly Life, which is in four parts, The Musing of a Quester, which he said is to “wake us to our chief mission in this world: to call a spade by its appropriate name by reminding us, we are not in the world to climb a social tree or to merely eat, drink, procreate, then die and be cremated, or lowered into the soil for all manners of maggots and insects to feast on our lifeless bodies.\n\n“In effect, this book would make sense only to those who are brazen, or dissatisfied with the shadow show of the labyrinth world,” he announced.\n\nOyefeso has dedicated his life to discussing the transient nature of life, and the need to prepare for whatever the afterlife holds.\n\nIn one of his writings, he stated that “First and foremost as a mystic, I must remind us of the inevitability of death. It is designed by the Creator Himself as a relief for the soul when our body has become enervated by disease, old age, accident or other mishaps that have made the soul conducive to inhabit the physical body any longer.\n\n“This happens when our allotted time is over in this world. The individual time varies and it is determined by the Creator Himself according to the karma and purpose that brought us into the world in the first instance.”\n\nLooking trim, smart and alert at 80, Aare Oyefeso was treated to love from all and sundry, and he confirmed his happiness amo g friends and well wishers with classic displays of dance steps, friendly banners and enjoyment of good food and beverages. It is worth noting that Aare Oyefeso is not in the habit of taking alcohol. In an interview he granted seven years, he noted that he quit alcohol over 27 years then, which in essence means he left some 34 years old.\n\nAare Oyefeso is married, and blessed with children, who are presentstanding on their own, and replicating a legacy of improved living, love for one another and dedication to the course of living a good and impactful life while still here on earth.\n\nFrom all of us, we wish the Balogun of Ode Remo a happy birthday, and many more years on planet earth.\n\nBy Eric Elezuo\n\nIt was a gathering of champions at the weekend when seasoned and accomplished journalist, administrator and politician, Aremo Olusegun Osoba, proved his networking and networth prowess.\n\nThe Convention Hall of the Eko Hotels and Suites was the venue, and it quickly became a beehive of activities with the calibre of celebrities, nobles and dignitaries that turned up in their numbers to honour a man, who many have described as a completely detribalised Nigerian. The event was the launch of his newest titles; My Life in the Public Eye, to commemorate his 85th Birthday. He was born on July 15, 1936.\n\nOsoba has been verily honoured in many quarters for his steadfastness in the field of journalism, humanity and public relations, and so it was not a surprise when the big wigs, the creme de la creme of the society turned from every corner of the earth to give honour to whom honour is due.\n\nOn the roll call of A-list attendees to the event are former President Olusegun Obasanjo, the Vice President of Nigeria, Senator Kashim Shettima; Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun; former Foreign Affairs Minister, Prince Bolaji Akinyemi; Chief Alex Duduyemi, former Delta State governor, Mr. James Ibori, former governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babatunde Fashola; Otunba Niyi Adebanjo, Ondo State governor, Mr. Lucky Aiyedatiwa, Senator Florence Ita-Giwa, Chairman, Ovation Media Group, Aare Dele Momodu, former Sec Gen of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku; CEO, Bison, Prince Bisi Olatilo; Oba Otudeko, Senator Uba Sani, Sir Kesington Adebutu, Olori Ladun Sijuade, Chief Sunny Kuku, Lady Maiden Ibru, Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, Senator Ope Bamidele, Chairman, ThisDay/Arise News, Chief Nduka Obaigbena; President, Dangote Industries Limited, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Erelu Abiola Dosunmu among a host of very many other important dignitaries.\n\nAccomplished pen-man, who attended Methodist Boys High School, it was not a coincidence that the event of the day fell exactly on the 60th anniversary of his foray into journalism.\n\nAt 85, Osoba’s strides speak volumes, and go before him. These as much were captured by all the speeches and remarks by notable individuals at the book presentation including Vice President Shettima, Fashola and Dapo Abiodun.\n\nIt could be recalled that during one his birthdays in the past, former Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida recognized him as detribalised, suave, urbane, cerebral, seasoned and profoundly accomplished.\n\n“Chief Segun Osoba remains one of Nigeria’s detribalised and essentially cosmopolitan octogenarians, suave, urbane, cerebral, seasoned and profoundly accomplished journalist who cut his professional teeth at a time when technology was still a huge challenge,” Babangida had written.\n\nWhile wishing Osoba the best, he noted that “your sun has just begun to shine. You remain to me as one of the most patriotic Nigerians I have come across in my sojourn in life”.\n\nNo doubt one of the finest journalists Nigeria has ever produced, Chief Olusegun Osoba, was the Editor and Managing Director of government-owned Daily Times Nigeria Ltd under Babangida’s regime. He had bitter experiences like his compatriots.\n\nOsoba revealed that Babangida sacked him three times while Abacha made attempts on his life three times due to his alignment with NADECO.\n\nOsoba said in parts, “I will call him by his name. Three times Babangida sacked me. Three times he re-instated me. At last, he converted my sack to resignation. Three times Abacha wanted to kill me. I was in hiding for one year,” he said.\n\nThat explained how dangerously he pursued his duties, and even at the risk of his own life, he never backed down. He is a believer in the truth, and as Governor Abiodun has described him in more than one forum, a role model to every lover of truth.\n\nIn his opening lines of an article titled Osoba’s Metamorphosis, in celebration of Osoba’s 80th birthday, Mr. Babatunde Jose, an ally and contemporary in journalism, said, “Having read Chief Olusegun Osoba’s book; Battlelines: Adventures in Journalism and Politics, and my personal life journey with the author, my take away from the book is that it is a story of an unending adventure with fate. A man whose resilience, hard work, perseverance and belief in himself and service to God and man has paved the path for a successful life in what we could describe as the cauldron called the Nigerian post-colonial state.\n\n“Born during the colonial era of the early constitutional development in Nigeria; precisely 1939, during the governor generalship of Sir Bernard Bourdillon 1935-1943 who laid the groundwork for the constitutional proposals which his successor Sir Arthur Richards (Lord Milverton) later submitted in 1944 and which became the Richard’s Constitution. He succeeded in convincing the Northern Emirs of the advisability of coming to join with the southerners in the Legislative Council of the country.”\n\nMr. Jose further added: “What we are witnessing today is a schism in the political class; a crack in the political pot and a return to primitivism, parochial and primordial tendencies. In all these however, Olusegun Osoba stands out as one political animal who has cut a distinct persona for himself and a different breed from the hubris of ‘come and chop’ political class; a collective of brigands and ruthless socio-economic barracudas, hell bent on robbing the national coffers of all that it contain.\n\n“His sojourn in journalism started during the time of his adopted uncle and godfather, late Alhaji Babatunde Jose. Being a good student of human philosophy, Osoba would imbibe the salient qualities of his mentor to rise and shine above his peers. Despite his apogee in journalism, he was not only cool headed but worked hard to maintain his comportment. This is attested to in the wide network of his associates, particularly in his youthful, clubbing and rascally days. He never lost focus and at the back of his mind was always the dictum: Remember the son of whom you are.\n\n“As it was in journalism, so had it been in politics. Having worked closely with the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, the man with a mission, Osoba had no choice but to pitch his tent with the progressive elements of Nigerian politics. It worked and has continued to work for him.\n\n“In all these however, one trait that has been discernible in Osoba’s personality is his contentment in life.”\n\nTo Dele Momodu, he is the grandfather of journalism.\n\n“He was as dynamic in politics as he had been in journalism. I was not very surprised by his conquests and giant strides. His suaveness and impeccability were such that his successes were assured in whatever he touched,”said Momodu.\n\nIt is with deep of respect that we raise a toast to grand Commander of Nigerian journalism as he clock 85years today.\n\nCongratulations sir!"
