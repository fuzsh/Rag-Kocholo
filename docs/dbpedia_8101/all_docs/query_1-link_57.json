We shall also do well to inform you of upcoming Esq. Seminars.\n\nThose terrible weeks in their camp by Human Rights Watch\n\nSummary\n\nBoko Haram, Nigeria’s homegrown Islamist insurgency, whose name in Hausa roughly translates as “Western education is forbidden,” has abducted at least 500 women and girls from northern Nigerian since 2009 and has perpetrated numerous human rights abuses against them in captivity. The April 14, 2014 abduction of 276 girls from a secondary school in Chibok, a rural town in Borno State, focused a much-needed spotlight on this increasing scourge.\n\nWhile much has been written about Boko Haram and the horrific threat it poses, very little is known about the abuses endured by women and girls in captivity. Such victims are obviously hard to find. This report, based on field research, including interviews with victims and witnesses of abduction, documents the abduction of women and girls by Boko Haram, highlighting the harrowing experiences of some of the abducted women and girls. There remain many more women and girls in captivity whose stories have not yet been told.\n\nFrom June through August 2014, Human Rights Watch interviewed 30 individuals who were abducted by Boko Haram between April 2013 and April 2014, and 16 others who witnessed the abductions. The victims, including 12 students of the Chibok School who escaped from Boko Haram custody after they were abducted, provided further details of the abuses they endured. The women and girls described how they were abducted from their homes and villages while working on the farms, fetching water, or attending school. The victims were held in eight different Boko Haram camps that they believed to be in the\n\n518-square-kilometer Sambisa Forest Reserve and around the Gwoza hills for periods ranging from two days to three months. They saw scores of other women and children, but were unable to ascertain if some, or all, had also been abducted or if they were family members of the insurgents. The women and children ranged from infancy to 65 years old. The Gwoza hills, which form a natural barrier between Nigeria and Cameroon, overlook Sambisa forest to the north and runs from Pulka town, 80 miles south east of Maiduguri, Borno State into Cameroon’s Far North region.\n\nThe women and girls told Human Rights Watch that for refusing to convert to Islam, they and many others they saw in the camps were subjected to physical and psychological abuse; forced labor; forced participation in military operations, including carrying ammunition or luring men into ambush; forced marriage to their captors; and sexual abuse, including rape. In addition, they were made to cook, clean, and perform other household chores. Others served as porters, carrying the loot stolen by the insurgents from villages and towns they had attacked. While some of the women and girls seemed to have been taken arbitrarily, the majority appeared to have been targeted for abduction because they were students, Christians, or both.\n\nThe Victims\n\nMost of the abductions documented in this report took place in the predominantly Christian area of southern Borno State, and all but one of the victims interviewed by Human Rights Watch were Christian. The victims appear to have been targeted either because of their presumed religious affiliation or for attending western-styled schools. Some of the victims were threatened with death if they refused to convert to Islam. One young woman held in a camp near Gwoza described how combatants placed a noose around her neck and threatened her with death until she renounced her religion; others were repeatedly threatened with whipping, beating, or death unless they converted to Islam, stopped attending school, and complied with Islamic dressing rules, such as wearing veils or the hijab.\n\nWhen one of the victims, a 15-year-old girl, complained to a Boko Haram commander that she and the other abducted girls were too young for marriage, he pointed at his 5-year-old daughter, and said: “If she got married last year, and is just waiting till puberty for its consummation, how can you at your age be too young to marry?”\n\nWomen and girls interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that some Boko Haram commanders appeared to make some effort to protect them from sexual violence. However, Human Rights Watch documented eight cases of sexual violence perpetrated by Boko Haram combatants; most cases of rape occurred after the victims were forced to marry. Social workers who have worked with some of the victims in Borno and Adamawa states told Human Rights Watch that the rape of women and girls abducted by Boko Haram has been underreported because of a culture of silence, stigma, and shame around sexual abuse in Nigeria’s conservative North.\n\nThe increase in the number of abductions since mid-2013 appears to mark a change of strategy by Boko Haram. From 2009 through early 2013, the group did not appear to target women and girls specifically. Instead, it primarily launched assaults against those it considered part of an unjust and corrupt system: members of the security services, politicians, civil servants, and other symbols of authority. By early 2012 schools and students became increasingly targeted for attacks, worsening already dire education indices in the Northeast, which has the lowest primary and secondary school net attendance ratio in the country.\n\nFrom 2009 to early 2013, according to Human Rights Watch’s research and monitoring of abuses, Boko Haram abducted individual women and girls from their homes or from the street during attacks on their communities. These abductions took place most often in Boko Haram’s then-strongholds of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, or Damaturu, the capital of neighboring Yobe State. In most of the documented cases, married women were abducted as punishment for not supporting the group’s ideology, while unmarried women and girls were taken as brides after insurgents hastily offered a dowry to the families, who feared to resist.\n\nThe abduction of 276 schoolgirls from in Chibok is the biggest single incident of abduction by Boko Haram at time of writing. The relative ease with which it carried out the Chibok abductions appears to have emboldened Boko Haram to carry out more abductions elsewhere.\n\nVideos released by Boko Haram’s leaders in January and May 2013 suggest three key motives for the initial abductions: to retaliate against the government for its alleged detention of family members, including the wives of the group’s leaders; to punish students for attending Western schools; and to forcefully convert Christian women and girls to Islam. Some of the victims and analysts interviewed by Human Rights Watch have suggested women and girls are also being used for tactical reasons, such as to lure security forces to an ambush, force payment of a ransom, or for a prisoner exchange.\n\nResidents of villages and towns ravaged by Boko Haram attacks during which women and girls were abducted complained about inadequate government response to prevent attacks and protect victims, often in imminent danger, and to provide adequate medical and psychological support for victims.\n\nMany of the victims and witnesses who spoke to Human Rights Watch recounted instances when the security forces had been overwhelmed because insufficient troops had been deployed to a given town or because they appeared to have run out of ammunition during the course of an attack. Others described how members of their community had informed authorities about impending attacks, but were met with a feeble response.\n\nMany of the victims and their family members expressed the ongoing anguish resulting from their ordeal, including deep fears of re-abduction, sleeplessness, and frustration for insufficient support from the government. However, of the victims interviewed, only the Chibok students who escaped from Boko Haram captivity had received limited counseling and medical care. None of the other victims of abduction or other violations, all from desperately poor families, had received or were aware of any government supported mental health or medical care. The federal and state funds, set up with support from international agencies and foreign governments in the wake of the high-profile Chibok abductions, have targeted the escaped Chibok girls but appear not to have widely benefitted the many other victims of Boko Haram abuses.\n\nThe abuses against women and girls documented in this report occurred against the backdrop of a dramatic increase in the pace and intensity of Boko Haram’s attacks against civilian targets from mid-2013, after the federal government imposed a state of emergency in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe states. Based on credible media reports and field investigations, Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 4,000 civilians have been killed in over 192 attacks since May 2013 in northeast Nigeria and in the federal capital, Abuja. At least 2,053 civilians were killed by Boko Haram in the first half of 2014.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has previously documented the widespread abuses carried out by the Nigerian security forces in responding to the attacks by Boko Haram. Since 2009, security forces have used excessive force, burned homes, engaged in physical abuse, “disappeared” victims, and extra-judicially killed those suspected of supporting Boko Haram.\n\nFew members of the security forces implicated in serious violations of humanitarian and human rights law, including violations against girls and women, have been prosecuted. To ensure accountability, Nigerian authorities should investigate and prosecute, based on international fair trial standards, those who committed serious crimes in violation of national and international law during the conflict, including members of Boko Haram, security forces, and pro-government vigilante groups. In addition, the government should provide adequate measures to protect schools and the right to education, and ensure access to medical and mental health services to victims of abduction and other violence. The government should also ensure that hospitals and clinics treating civilian victims are equipped with medical supplies to treat survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.\n\nThe international community should encourage and support transparent investigations and prosecution of perpetrators of human rights abuses by Boko Haram as well as violations by government security forces and allied groups, and should assist the Nigerian government to provide protection for schools as well as physical and mental health care to all victims of abductions and other violations perpetrated by Boko Haram.\n\nThe Nigerian government and the international community should ensure that women participate fully in all national and international efforts to maintain and promote peace and security in Nigeria. The Nigerian government failed to include women in its delegations to Paris Summit on Security in Nigeria in May 2013 and the London Ministerial on security in Nigeria in June 2014. Participants at both meetings committed to civilian protection and human rights and to the prevention of sexual violence in conflict. Human Rights Watch urges the Nigerian government to comply with its National Action Plan for the Implementation of UNSCR 1325 and other related resolutions in Nigeria, which commits the government to take special measures to include women at all levels of peace processes.\n\nHuman Rights Watch urges Boko Haram to comply with the principles of international humanitarian and human rights law and to end immediately the killing, maiming, rape, and abduction of Nigeria’s civilian population including students, which has suffered greatly over the past five years.\n\nSource- www.hrw.org\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF CONTESTING GOVERNORSHIP ELECTIONS\n\nCross-section of Nigerian Governor Forum (From vangaurdngr.com)\n\nThis is the second post in a\n\nseries of articles informing about the requirements for contesting elections in\n\nNigeria. Last time, I wrote on the requirements for contesting presidential elections in Nigeria, while this post will be treating the constitutional\n\nrequirements for contesting Governorship elections in Nigeria.\n\nThe position of a State of\n\nGovernor is provided for by the Constitution in Section 176. It provides that –\n\nthere shall be for each State of the Federation a Governor and the Governor\n\nshall be the Don Dada Chief Executive of that State. The only persons\n\nqualified to be Governors are- Citizens of Nigeria by birth; persons who have\n\nattained the age of 35 years; members of a political party & sponsored by\n\nthat party; and such candidate that has been educated to at least School\n\nCertificate Level or its equivalent.\n\nIt should also be noted that the\n\nfollowing persons are not qualified for election to the position of the\n\nGovernor-\n\nPersons who have voluntarily\n\nacquired the citizenship of another country;\n\nHe has elected to the position 2\n\nprevious times;\n\nA lunatic or person of unsound\n\nmind;\n\nPersons under a death sentence;\n\nPersons who have been convicted\n\nand sentenced for an offence involving dishonesty within the past 10 years of\n\nthe election or has contravened the Code of Conduct;\n\nAn undischarged bankrupt;\n\nPersons employed in public\n\nservice;\n\nMember of a secret society;\n\nPersons who have been indicted\n\nfor embezzlement or fraud; and\n\nPersons who presented a forged\n\ncertificate to INEC.\n\nIt is the duty of INEC to appoint\n\nthe date for the elections though such elections must be held on a date not\n\nearlier than 60 days and not later than 30 days before the expiration of the\n\nterm of office of the last holder of the office. Section 178 states that a candidate\n\nfor the Governorship elections shall be deemed to have been duly elected where,\n\nbeing the only candidate nominated for the election –\n\nHe has a majority of YES votes\n\nover NO votes cast at the election; and\n\nHe has not less than one-quarter\n\nof the votes cast at the election in each of at least two –thirds of all the\n\nlocal government areas in the State, but where the only candidate fails to be\n\nelected in accordance with this provision of the law, then there shall be fresh\n\nnominations.\n\nWhere there are 2 or more\n\ncandidates, one will be deemed duly elected if –\n\nHe has the highest number of\n\nvotes cast at the election; and\n\nHe has not less than one –quarter\n\nof all votes cast in each of at least two-thirds of all the local government\n\nareas in the State.\n\nIf no candidate is elected by\n\nvirtue of the foregoing provisions, there shall be a second election at which\n\nthe only candidates shall be – the candidate who secured the highest number of\n\nvotes and one among the remaining candidates who secured majority of votes in\n\nthe highest number of local govt areas.\n\nSection 185 states that the\n\nGovernor shall not begin to perform the functions of office until he has\n\ndeclared his assets/liabilities and subscribed to the oath of allegiance and\n\nOath of office.\n\nAdedunmade Onibokun, Esq.\n\n@adedunmade\n\ndunmadeo@yahoo.com\n\n#OPINION #BRINGBACKOURGIRLS: TO WHAT EXACTLY?! by Chika Maduakolam\n\nCredit- Google\n\nAs I am prone to do with my opinion pieces, I state a disclaimer; these are simply ramblings of an overworked lawyer who gets her brain fried under the hot Lagos sun daily. Permit me to exercise my inherent right of freedom of expression.\n\nHaving gotten that out of the way, I will dive straight in; this piece is not to remind us about the length of time the abducted Chibok girls have been gone, neither is it about how well or not the Nigerian government has performed or even about all the humanitarian and human rights activists’ efforts that have been contributed towards ensuring their freedom by various organisations. Far from it, I have an impression that we have all been inundated with the on-goings of all the above;\n\nThis piece is simply an avenue to air out a gnawing train of thought that has made this writer have stray thoughts one time too many- We all clamor for our girls to be brought back altruistically and nobly, however, I would like to ask a question many of us do not think is important: Bring back our girls to what exactly?!!!!\n\nCredit – amnestyinternational.org\n\nBefore I have the crowd calling for my head, take a minute and think:\n\nIt will be agreed, myself being female, that the predicament of women is somewhat fragile in the society, this has nothing to do with the strength or mental acuity of women; it is a simple fact of being! Bearing this in mind, we have a group of young girls, unprotected, impressionable, young in soul and mind in an environment such as a terrorist camp; it can only be imagined the extent of horror to which they are prone to; rape, slavery, mistreatment and all sorts of inhumane treatment. Some of them will be pregnant, some of them will have their once innocent souls ripped out, replaced by hardened minds and spirits that have been molded different either through false doctrines or untold psychological hardship!\n\nThe girls who were taken away, I assure you, are not the same girls who are to be brought back.\n\nNow, stating the stark reality before us as a nation: We are simply not equipped to handle this situation! What institution has been set up to provide the requisite psychological, physiological and mental support that these girls require? What schools will these girls attend when they return to us; a school that will nurture them, cocoon them, recalibrate their minds, a school that we will all admit we need because their impression of what a school was before they were taken, I assure you, is not the same impression they have now!! What medical help and assistance is on ground to provide healthcare to these girls? Who will stitch those who have been sore, who will give the requisite medication if they arise to treat any ailments, what tests will be carried out to ensure that the good health of these ladies have not been compromised?\n\nMost importantly, to cut my ramblings short; to what society are you bringing them back to? I am sorry to say but as much as I am Nigerian, I do not have the requisite faith in Nigerians to say we can shoulder the necessary responsibility of providing a supportive society to cushion the effects of the trauma these girls must have been through; our society is prone to creating stigmas and labels, this is not to say we are not empathic people, we just have not learnt to be any better; if your son says he has found a wife who was a victim of the chibok kidnap ,would the average Nigerian parent embrace his decision? The community to which these girls will return, will they treat them like outcasts? What of the children of these girls for those who are pregnant or are mothers, will they be embraced wholly? Will the very relatives of these girls be patient and empathetic enough to accommodate any of the girls who have been radicalized bearing in mind that only time can heal deep wounds?\n\nI could go on and on but I believe enough is contained here to foster a train of thought as to the structural aid we need to rehabilitate these girls and indeed, rehabilitation is what is required. To not be a doomsayer, I will attempt to voice out a solution I harbor in mind no matter how implausible it may seem: If we cannot provide the requisite structure to restore these girls, can we at least agree that we should invest in moving these girls to an environment where this can be provided? I already foresee the unpleasant reactions to this piece. Nonetheless, the truth is the truth!! We have cried #BRINGBACKOURGIRLS, let’s begin to also cry, more importantly: #RESTOREOURGIRLS!!\n\nYoung Lawyer Shares What She Wished She Knew Before Law School by Victoria Pynchon\n\nI started law school a decade ago. At the time, the post 9-11 economy was on a major decline and law schools across the country were seeing a huge surge in the number of applicants. Hundreds of thousands of college grads were seeking a J.D. and I was one of them.\n\nLike many people before me, I hated law school. I remember reading Scott Turow’sOne L: The Turbulent True Story of a First Year at Harvard Law School. I could relate. But I was not at Harvard, and my law school’s name alone was not going to open up doors for me. Still, it all turned out well.\n\nDo I regret going down my chosen path? Not at all. But would I change things if I had the opportunity? Absolutely!. If I could go back in time, I’d give the following advice to myself and to all law students, at Harvard or elsewhere.\n\nPlay Nice With Your Classmates – One Day They Will Be Your Opposing Counsel\n\nThe cut-throat atmosphere of many law schools brings out the worst in people. This is unfortunate but understandable. You’re constantly stressed. You’re worried about the attrition rate. You’re worried about passing the bar. You’re worried about getting a job.\n\nIt’s very easy to start seeing your classmates as enemies and treat them accordingly. But this is a big mistake. Be nice to your classmates because one day they will become your colleagues, referral sources, and even opposing counsel. Being nice in law school will help guard your reputation and will pay off in spades long after you graduate.\n\nDiscover Your Lawyering Personality\n\nTake all the classes that pique your interest. Take advantage of internships and summer associate positions to discover what type of law practice fits your personality best.\n\nYou may think that I’m crazy to say this. You may be thinking that law grads should consider themselves lucky to get any legal job in this economy.\n\nBut realize that most lawyers who hate their job feel that way because it does not suit their personality. Trust me, I am speaking from experience.\n\nMy first job out of law school involved many administrative hearings and depositions. I was in an adversarial position day in and out, and I hated stepping into a court room knowing that someone would win and someone would lose.\n\nClearly, I neglected my lawyering personality, which is geared more towards transactional law and counseling clients. It was only when I switched to a position that optimized my personality, that I finally started to enjoy practicing law.\n\nStay true to your lawyering personality and look for a job that best suits it. Doing this may just put you in a small minority of lawyers who actually love what they do.\n\nFill Your Rolodex\n\nWith so much competition for legal jobs these days, how do you guarantee one after you finish law school? Start seeking job opportunities while you’re in law school.\n\nA great perk of being a law student is your ability to join many local and national bar associations for free.\n\nTake advantage of this and attend bar association events in practice areas that interest you. It’s a great way to meet local attorneys and it will give you an advantage when searching for a summer associate or an attorney position later on.\n\nReach out to attorneys you admire and ask them for an informational interview or lunch. This may seem daunting, but trust me, most attorneys love to talk about themselves and their practices.\n\nAnd they’ll likely pick up the lunch tab – a great bonus for a starving law student.\n\nLook for a Mentor\n\nYou should realize that successful professionals aren’t born that way. They got to be at the top of their game because they had a mentor. Someone who believed in them. Groomed them. Pushed them to be better.\n\nLook for a mentor in your summer associate position, a local bar association, or other local attorneys. Having a good relationship with a mentor is invaluable to your long term success.\n\nNurture it by meeting with them regularly and asking lots of questions. Then listen and follow their lead.\n\nGet High Teched\n\nLawyers are creatures of habit.

This post is a first in a series of articles informing about the\n\nconstitutional requirements for contesting elections in Nigeria, here we shall\n\nbe talking about the office of the President of the Federal Republic of\n\nNigeria.\n\nThe Constitution provides for the\n\nlaw regarding eligibility into the position of the President and other electoral\n\npositions such as the position of the Governor, Senators and members of the\n\nNational and State Assemblies. Section 130 of the 1999 Constitution says that “there\n\nshall be for the Federation, a President” and such “President shall be the Head\n\nof State, the Chief Executive of the Federation and Commander- In –Chief of the\n\nArmed Forces of the Federation”.\n\nQualification to the position of\n\nthe President is provided for in Section 131, which states that – A person\n\nshall be qualified for election to the office of President if –\n\nhe is a citizen of Nigeria by\n\nbirth;\n\nhe has attained the age of forty –\n\nyears.\n\nhe is a member of a political\n\nparty and is sponsored by that political party; and\n\nhe has been educated up to at\n\nleast School Certificate level or its equivalent.\n\nThere have been comments on the\n\nage qualification of the President, some believe that the age qualification\n\nshould either be reduced to 35 or totally removed from the qualifications for\n\nthe position of the President, do you agree? Other also comment that\n\nIndependent candidates who are not members of political parties should also be\n\neligible for candidacy.\n\nIt is the duty of INEC to appoint\n\na date for election into the office of the President and the elections must\n\nhold on a date not earlier than sixty days and not later than thirty days\n\nbefore the expiration of the term of office of the last holder of that office\n\nas provided in Section 132.\n\nA candidate for an election to\n\nthe office of President shall be deemed to have been duly elected to such\n\noffice where, being the only candidate nominated for the election –\n\nhe has a majority of YES votes\n\nover NO votes cast at the election; and\n\nhe has not less than one –\n\nquarter of the votes cast at the election in each of at least two-thirds of all\n\nthe States in the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, but\n\nwhere the only candidate fails to be elected in accordance with this section,\n\nthen there shall be fresh nominations. (section 133)\n\nSection 136 provides that if the\n\nperson elected as President dies before taking the Oath of Allegiance and oath\n\nof office, or is for any reason is unable to be sworn in, the person elected as\n\nhis Vice-President shall be sworn in as President. However, when both die\n\nbefore the inauguration of the National Assembly, INEC will have to conduct\n\nfresh elections.\n\nAs stated in the Constitution,\n\nthe following people are disqualified from seeking elections into the office of\n\nthe President-\n\npersons who have voluntarily\n\nacquired the citizenship of another country other than Nigeria\n\nhe has been previously elected as\n\nPresident twice\n\nhe is under a death sentence\n\nimposed by a competent court of law or tribunal\n\nwithin 10 years before elections,\n\nhe has been found guilty and sentenced of a crime involving dishonesty or\n\ncontravention of the code of conduct.\n\nhe is an undischarged bankrupt\n\nhe is employed into the civil or public\n\nservice of the Federation or of any State, he has not resigned or retired from\n\nthe employment.\n\nhe is a member of any secret\n\nsociety\n\nhe has been indicted for\n\nembezzlement or fraud by a Judicial Commission of Inquiry or an Administrative\n\nPanel of Inquiry.\n\nhe has presented a forged\n\ncertificate to INEC\n\nhe has been adjudged a lunatic or\n\nperson of unsound mind.\n\nThe position of the President is a very sensitive one as such person is the leader of the nation, he determines a lot about policy development and execution and as such must be a person with a heart to serve and the drive to move the nation forward. Everyone who is eligible to vote in the coming election is urged to vote wisely and not sell their votes.\n\nAdedunmade Onibokun, Esq\n\n@adedunmade\n\nAdedunmade is a lawyer who\n\npractices in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nPROFILE:- CHIEF WOLE OLANIPEKUN, OFR, SAN, FCIArb\n\nChief Oluwole Oladapo Olanipekun, SAN was born on 18th\n\nNovember, 1951 at Ikere-Ekiti.

Because when it comes to legal consumers, it seems that love at first sight really does exist.\n\nFindLaw’s 2014 U.S. Consumer Legal Needs Surveyasked respondents how many attorneys they contacted or seriously considered before making a selection, and the answer was astonishing: 72% replied, “one.” Either legal consumers are extremely open to positive first impressions, or they’re doing an excellent job of finding legal representation that matches their needs. (To be honest, it’s probably a bit of both.)\n\nIt begs the question: What are you doing to ensure that you are “The One” consumers are looking for? In a romantic context, advice for finding a good match would go something like: put yourself out there, be yourself and focus on the other person. Obviously, dating and legal marketing aren’t exactly analogous, but there’s something to be said about those tips:\n\nPutting yourself out there is about being in the right place at the right time. For law firms, it means having a well-designed website, strongsocial media presence, and enough activity to ensure you get noticed in relevant circles and search results.\n\nWith that done, the advice of, “Just be yourself” is the easiest of all. Legal consumers desire resolution of their cases. By presenting yourexpertise and practice areas in a clear manner, you’ll help potential clients understand who you are, and how you can help.\n\nFocusing on the other person makes them feel like they’re being heard and eventually leads to trust. Use the right language online to highlight your empathy, understanding and ability to advocate for your clients.\n\nRemember that none of these tips are about beating the system. Good attorney/client relationships aren’t built on manipulation. And legal marketing isn’t about playing the field. It’s about finding the right match. After all, a client who views your firm as “The One” can have a positive impact on your business for years to come.\n\nThink about that number again: Nearly three out of four legal consumers select the first attorney they contact. Clearly online tools and old-fashioned word-of-mouth referrals can have a huge influence over your potential clients. Make sure you’re using them to your advantage. By focusing on meeting the right clients and presenting your best self online and in-person, you’ll up your odds of becoming “The One.”\n\nSource – http://www.lawyermarketing.com\n\nINSURBODINATE BEHAVIOUR IN THE MILITARY\n\nCredits – sunnewsonline.com\n\nThis is the 3rd\n\narticle in a series of posts relating to offences under the Nigerian Armed\n\nForces Act, the first was an article on the law on “Mutiny\n\nunder the Armed Forces Act” while the second was about “Disorderly\n\nbehaviour among Soldiers/Service men”.\n\nIf you have\n\never lived in a military barracks, attended a military school or know a thing or\n\ntwo about the military, you will know the rule that the chain of command is\n\nunbreakable and anyone who breaks it, gets broken, lol. The chain of command or\n\nrespect to seniority is sacred and it’s a big deal. Now imagine if a service\n\nman strikes his superior officer, wow, make we just talk say him own don end\n\nsuch soldier will definitely be\n\ndisciplined.\n\nI attended a military\n\nhigh school, Nigerian navy to be precise and I remember a day I was beating for\n\nno reason by a senior student, I was so sure I didn’t deserve the treatment I\n\ngot and angrily walked off to report the senior student to one of the military\n\nofficers on deck. The military officer listened and asked me to go call the wicked\n\nsenior, he berated the senior for beating me for no apparent reason and asked\n\nme to give the said senior 6 strokes from a horse whip. Oboy, did I gladly lash\n\nthe senior’s buttocks. After acting out my vengeance, the military officer asked\n\nthe senior to get up and said “this boy could come and report you to me because\n\nyou did not beat him well enough, now take him away”. Immediately I\n\nheard those words, I knew it was time to draw up a will and last testament, I was\n\ndefinitely going to die, the senior student just looked and said “follow me” as\n\nhe walked off to the senior dormitory.\n\nI didn’t die\n\nthat day, obviously, else I won’t be typing this article many years after but\n\nlet’s just say, I have never forgotten that experience and I doubt if I ever\n\nwill. If my secondary school could be that devoted to the chain of command\n\nwithout minding if a senior student had killed me that day, imagine what it\n\nmust mean to actually strike a superior officer in the military, serious\n\ngbege i am sure.\n\nImagine a\n\nscenario where a Major barks orders at a Sergeant to carry out a directive,\n\nonly for the Sergeant to slap the Major because the Major is his younger\n\ncousin. Obviously, that will happen only in a Nollywood movie because Insubordinate\n\nbehaviour is completely frowned upon by the military; Section 54 of the Armed\n\nForces Act states that-\n\n“Any person subject to service law\n\nwho strikes or otherwise uses violence to, or offers violence to, his superior\n\nofficer; or uses threatening or insubordinate language to his superior officer,\n\nis guilty of an offence under this section and liable, on conviction by a court\n\n– martial, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or any less\n\npunishment provided by the Act”.\n\nIt states further in subsection 2\n\nthat a person convicted for the offence stated above shall only be liable to be\n\nimprisoned for no more than two years if the offence was committed on active\n\nservice or involved the striking or other use of violence, to the superior\n\nofficer exercising authority as such. A superior officer means an officer, a\n\nwarrant officer or its equivalent in rank, non – commissioned officer subject\n\nto service law under the Act of superior rank, and includes an officer, a\n\nwarrant officer or its equivalent rank,or non – commissioned officer so subject\n\nof equal rank but greater seniority while exercising authority as that person’s\n\nsuperior.\n\nAdedunmade Onibokun\n\n@adedunmade"
