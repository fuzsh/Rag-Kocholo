        "text": "The Federal Government on Friday directed the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council of the University of Lagos, Wale Babalakin, and Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe to recuse themselves from official duties, pending the outcome of the Special Visitation Panel set up by the President.\n\nThe information was announced in a press statement signed by the Federal Ministry of Education spokesman, Ben Goong.\n\n“Government also directs the Senate of the University of Lagos to immediately convene to nominate an acting Vice-Chancellor from amongst its members for confirmation by the Governing Council,” the statement added.\n\nBabalakin’s Governing Council had, on August 12, sacked Ogundipe as Vice-Chancellor over alleged financial misappropriation and misconduct.\n\nOgundipe, however, rejected the Council’s decision, saying the University’s due process had not been followed.\n\nThe University’s Senate, alumni, and labour unions also put out statements saying the due process had not been followed.\n\nBut Babalakin, in several media reactions, insisted that due process had been complied with in terminating Ogundipe’s appointment.\n\nThe Presidential Panel, made up of seven members, is expected to determine whether the required steps were taken by the Council in sacking Ogundipe.\n\nThey are also expected “to make appropriate recommendations including sanctions for all those found culpable” in the investigation, which is expected to last for two weeks.\n\nThe panel will be inaugurated by the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, on August 26.\n\nMembers of the panel include Professor Tukur Sa’ad (Chairman), Barrister Victor Onuoha, Professor Ikenna Onyido, Professor Ekanem Braide, Professor Adamu K. Usman, Chief Jimoh Bankole and Barrister Grace Ekanem (Secretary).\n\nSource: Channels TV"
