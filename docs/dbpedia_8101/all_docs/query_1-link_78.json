Idachaba, while testifying before the Senate Panel probing the invasion of the National Assembly by the police, had said on Monday that he saw Mark’s security detail firing tear-gas with insistence that none of the policemen under his division fired a canister of tear-gas, but Mark’s detail during the episode.
