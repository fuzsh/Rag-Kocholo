        "text": "About Us\n\nPublished since 1996, OVATION International was born in London, United Kingdom. It was conceptualized by the Publisher, Chief Dele Momodu, a tried and tested journalist and high-profile Editor who was driven into exile by the General Sani Abacha Government in Nigeria.s The magazine was a child of circumstance because rather than take the short route of eking a living through engaging in menial jobs, Momodu decided to stick to his area of core competence: Journalism. His desire was to publish an African magazine for Africans and create a forum where the real picture of Africa would be presented to the world."
