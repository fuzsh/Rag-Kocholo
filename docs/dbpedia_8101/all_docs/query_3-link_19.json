        "text": "The Government College Ibadan Old Boys Association have committed over N500 million to the development of the school.\n\nWale Babalakin, Chairman of GCIOBA said that the Old Boys Association of GCI would also partner with the state government to return boarding system to the school.\n\nBabalakin while speaking at the grand finale of events marking 90th anniversary of the school said the idea of a GCI as a day school without boarding system was an antithesis.\n\nOn his part, the Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde has promised to make the Government College Ibadan (GCI) the poster school in Nigeria, adding that his government is intent on restoring the lost glory of education in Oyo State.\n\nWhile promising to reclaim the lost glory of the education sector in Oyo State by collaborating with different stakeholders to uplift the sector, Makinde said the State would soon advertise for the recruitment of teachers.\n\nHe stated that his administration would continue to place great importance on the future of the children of Oyo State.\n\nMakinde commended the Government College Ibadan Old Boys Association (GCIOBA) for their contributions towards reclaiming the glory of the historic school, especially the renovation of the old hostels of the school, among others, promising to partner with them to make GCI the poster school of Nigeria.\n\nThe Governor also expressed his readiness to collaborate with stakeholders in the education sector to deliver qualitative education, noting that everyone has to come to the table on the policies put in place by the State Government, because the government and the Governor could not do it alone.\n\nThe Governor maintained that it had been a challenge for Government to drive its free qualitative education policy because there were corrupt elements trying to frustrate Government.\n\nHe insisted, however, that he would not relent in delivering free qualitative education to all students in the State.\n\nThe Governor explained that he had sent out fact-finding emissaries to some schools in the State, which discovered that the free textbooks provided by the State were not being distributed to students in some schools, noting that he had already given a directive that the books must reach every student.\n\n“Actually, this brings it down to where we are in the area of education in Oyo State. During my electioneering campaign, I promised the good people of Oyo State free and qualitative education but I knew that the government cannot do it alone. I am happy with the latest developments in GCI and want to promise that the government of Oyo State will partner with you.\n\nA statement by Taiwo Adisa, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Makinde, said “We will soon advertise vacancy to recruit teachers. If the PTA teachers are good enough and have the prerequisite qualifications, they will be employed. But the bottom-line is that the future of our children is at stake here. If we are saying that government is providing certain things and we cannot have value for those things, then it is a big problem and that is what we are faced with right now.\n\n“I am saying boldly here that education is one of the pillars on which this administration is resting on. It is only when we give knowledge to our people; that are when they can take themselves out of poverty,” Governor Makinde said.\n\n“It is a big challenge and I have to come out to say this. When we came in, we scrapped the N3,000 education levy but we have been challenged by those corrupt elements within the education sector. I have heard cases where I was told certain schools were burgled because we scrapped N3, 000 but did not provide grants to schools. They said they could not employ guards to secure the school environment. If I look at that school and also look at GCI, where do you think I will put further investment?\n\n“I have also heard about situations where they came back to us and said some certain schools had only five instead of 25 teachers out of which 20 were PTA teachers. They also said they could not pay the PTA teachers because the government stopped them from collecting N3, 000 education levy. They never declared to anybody that the levy was the same as PTA levy. So, I said to the Permanent Secretary that we will give Grants to schools but there must be accountability.\n\n“I care about this mandate the people of Oyo State have given to me and I care about the promises I made to the people during my electioneering campaign. So, the challenge is out there and I want to ask that the good people within our midst have to come to the table for the educational policies we are putting in place to succeed."
