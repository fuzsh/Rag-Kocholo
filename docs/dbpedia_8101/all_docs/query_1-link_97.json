        "text": "Bola Tinubu, the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the demise of Buruji Kashamu has demonstrated that death is inevitable for every mortal.\n\nKashamu, a former senator from Ogun state, died of COVID-19 complications at a Lagos hospital on Saturday.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Tinubu said he was shocked and saddened by the passing of Kashamu whom he described as “a notable leader in the country and a true grassroots politician”.\n\nHe said the deceased worked actively to advance the political and economic fortunes of Ogun state, adding that he admired Kashamu’s doggedness even though they were never in the same political party.\n\nTinubu said Kashamu’s death has increased the “grotesque list” of important personalities that have lost their lives to COVID-19.\n\n“He fought for his convictions, for the people of Ogun State and for his country,” Tinubu said.\n\n“Senator Kashamu was also a good party man. He was unwavering in his support for his party, PDP, through all the twists and turns of his political life. His passing is a big loss to the larger political family in Nigeria.\n\n“He worked assiduously to advance the political and economic fortunes of his state. Kashamu represented, with merit, Ogun East in the 8th National Assembly and worked well for his constituents. He was a kind and generous man, a philanthropist in his own right and an astute businessman.\n\n“I admire his political doggedness and sagacity, and his steadfastness in pursuing whatever he believes in, though we were never in the same political party.\n\n“Again, Kashamu’s sudden death has demonstrated the transience of human life and rekindles the fact that death is inevitable for every mortal. As such, it behooves on us to be kind to the dead.”\n\nTinubu asked Nigerians to continue to take protective measures as the economy reopens and as they return to “a new normal in our lifestyles”.\n\n“I mourn with his family, particularly his wives, children and grandchildren. May Almighty Allah lay His hands of protection on them at this moment,” Tinubu said.\n\nHe also offered his condolences to Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun, and the people of the state.\n\nEarlier, ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo, in a condolence letter, said Kashamu’s life is a lesson for all because in his lifetime he used “the maneuver of law and politics to escape justice on alleged criminal offence in Nigeria and outside Nigeria”, but that he could not evade death.\n\nAyodele Fayose, governor of Ekiti, condemned Obasanjo’s letter, saying it was regrettable that the former president could say that about the deceased.\n\nFormer Minister of State for Education, Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi, has warned members of the Nigerian Bar Association with a sinister move to subvert the Presidency of Olumide Akpata that they will be resisted by the majority of lawyers who voted during the association’s election.\n\nGbagi, in a statement issued to the media on Sunday, questioned the motives and sincerity of those against Akpata’s emergence while also underscoring the need for reforms in the NBA.\n\nThe Ex-Minister, who is a lawyer and past Chairman of the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria, described all concerns raised before the elections as untenable, given that the contestants went ahead to participate in the exercise, and are therefore bound by its outcome.\n\nHe challenged anyone with evidence against the newly elected President, with respect to criminal breach of the law, to come forward with same.\n\n“Any attempt to truncate Akpata’s election will be resisted and strongly opposed by the majority lawyers in the country.\n\n“There are many things that need to be reformed in the NBA. For example, despite universal suffrage for all lawyers, it is sad that only lawyers who have held position as Chairman or Secretary of their local branches can contest for NBA National offices or those who were co-opted to the NBA National Executive Council.\n\n“Why are those complaining about the conduct of the last elections not championing such reforms which benefit the larger number of lawyers in Nigeria? These are the kinds of reforms we implore the incoming NBA Exco to consider.\n\n“Those who are calling for cancellation of the NBA elections are not being fair to the vast majority of lawyers who participated as voters and contestants, who are not complaining.\n\n“I understand that out of the three presidential contestants, one won, one conceded victory and one is disgruntled. So, you can tell whether the majority is dissatisfied or not.\n\n“While it is okay to advocate reforms and improvement, it is certainly not okay to call for cancellation of an exercise that has cost so many so much and widely accepted by the vast majority as reflective of their will.\n\n“As for those persons hiding under the guise of clamoring for reforms today, where were they since the inception of the NBA? Why were they not bold to clamour for those reforms before now? Is Olumide a lawyer or not?\n\n“Besides, Judges and Senior Advocates have the same basic qualification – which is the LLB and BL – as any other lawyer in the country.\n\n“It will interest anyone to note that 99 percent of lawyers in Nigeria are not SANs. The question is: did Olumide meet the constitutional qualification of the NBA to contest in the election held by the association? Was there any criminal breach of the law committed by him or any officer of the Exco therein? In my opinion, I think we should be mindful of trying to personalize the affairs of the NBA.\n\n“I have personally spoken to large groups of lawyers, and over 72 percent of them who are not SANs feel strongly concerned about the sentiment held by those in the minority, and consider same an insult, as though that office is meant for those who perceive themselves as being at the top of the coveted legal profession.\n\n“The laws of the NBA are clear. We are looking to see any such document violated by the Olumide-led NBA and if there is none, my strong advice to fellow colleagues in the legal profession is that they sheathe their swords and support Olumide to succeed.\n\n“I call on all SANs, most of whom are my acquaintances, friends and brothers to rally support for the Olumide-led NBA as no man will take a bulldozer to pull down his own house, no matter the issues therein.\n\n“A great opportunity to show love to all lawyers within the legal profession has presented itself, and it must be used under the new leadership to bring discipline, purposefulness, and a rebirth of the NBA,” Gbagi said.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, has agreed with its partners to settle all outstanding issues surrounding the development of Oil Mining Lease, OML 130.\n\nKennie Obateru, spokesman for the NNPC disclosed in a statement on Saturday in Abuja.\n\nThe partners are China National Offshore Oil Company, CNOOC, and South Atlantic Petroleum, SAPETROL.\n\nMr Obateru said the move was in line with the effort to meet the target of revving up production to three million barrels per day.\n\nHe said it would also unlock gas revenues to the tune of about 225 million dollars in the short term and 510 million dollars in the long run for the country.\n\nHe quoted the NNPC Group Managing Director, Malam Mele Kyari, as saying at the signing of Head of Terms, HoT, agreement with the partners that the deal was part of the Corporation’s Production Sharing Contract, PSC, Dispute Resolution and Renewal Strategy of 2017.\n\nMr Kyari said that the resolution was aimed at securing out of court settlement of all disputes around the 1993 Production Sharing Contracts, PSC, and agreeing on terms for their renewal.\n\nHe explained that the dispute arose from recognition of certain cost and discordant interpretation of the fiscal terms of the PSC by NNPC and the contractor parties.\n\n“With the resolution and signing of HoT, apart from unlocking over 225 million dollars of gas revenues, it will also enable settlement of renewal fees.\n\n“It will create conducive environment to further development of OML 130 with associated benefits to the federation.\n\n“We are doing this with every other partner in the PSC dispute, we believe that we can close this engagement and conversation with all of you.\n\n“The HoT will clearly enable us to proceed and have a full settlement, and this will benefit all of us,” Kyari said\n\nHe commended CNOOC and SAPETROL for their understanding while expressing delight that the HoT would facilitate the conclusion of all renewal issues.\n\nAlso, managing director of CNOOC, Xie Vincent Wensheng, said the agreement had opened a new chapter in his company’s relationship with NNPC, stressing that it had provided a win-win situation for all parties.\n\nOn his part, Managing Director of SAPETROL, Mr Toyin Adenuga, said the resolution of the dispute was a very important step toward further development of OML 130 and other new fields as the terms were now clearly spelt out.\n\nThe execution of the HoT signals the resolution of a tax dispute that arose from the 2.3 billion dollars acquisition of a 45 per cent stake in OML 130 by CNNOC from SAPETRO in 2006.\n\nThe OML 130 consists of the Akpo and Egina Fields which have been producing since 2009 and 2018 respectively.\n\nIt is operated by Total Upstream Nigeria Ltd which holds 24 per cent stake, while Petrobras Oil and Gas BV and SAPETRO hold 16 per cent and 15 per cent stakes respectively.\n\nHon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairman/CEO, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), mourns Dr Dapo Williams.\n\nShe described the death of Dr Dapo Williams, a UK-based Nigerian, as an irreparable loss to his family, Nigeria and the UK communities.\n\nDabiri-Erewa stated this in a condolence message signed by Abdur-Rahman Balogun, Head, Media, Public Relations and Protocols Unit of NiDCOM on Sunday in Abuja .\n\nShe added that Dr Williams, was a quintessential gentleman, a worthy patriot and highly respected leader in the UK Nigerian Diaspora community as well as in Nigeria.\n\nThe NiDCOM boss said that the late Williams was a worthy agent of change in all facets of life and humanity and pioneer Chairman of Nigerian Think Tank Group (NTTG).\n\n“A selfless man , who always puts the needs of others before his.\n\n“He was on the frontline of mobilising support from Nigerians in Diaspora to assist government efforts in battling Covid-19 pandemic as a member of the Nigerian Diaspora Covid-19 Eradication support group,” she said.\n\nDabiri-Erewa prayed to God to give his family and friends the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss and grant him eternal rest.\n\n“Until his death, Dapo Williams was a real estate practitioner with over 30 years of experience in the Building Maintenance Industry and a highly respected community leader in the United Kingdom.\n\n“He was also an expert in the Oil and Gas, Automobile Products Retailing, Construction, Education, Employment, Legal Advice and Guidance Industry Sectors.\n\n“Dr Williams was also the Chair of Forecourt Petroleum Product retailing outfit in Kent and member of the institute of Directors (IoD) in London and Kent.\n\n“With his death, the Nigerian Community in London has been thrown into deep mourning and an indescribable sense of loss as the news of his passage was announced .\n\n“A generous and kind-hearted man, Dr Williams, popularly known as DW was loved and respected by many who met and knew him. He was humble, modest , lively and down to earth.\n\n“He was the Patron of many UK-Nigerian Community Projects and President of many socio-political organisations.\n\n“He supported many community initiatives and organisations including the Nigerian Events Awards UK, Gathering of Africa’s Best (GAB Award) and Uncelebrated Nigerians Awards.\n\n“He was a dedicated APC-UK member and a founding member of the Buhari Campaign Organisation in the UK.\n\n“He was conferred with the title of Otunba Fiwagboye and Otunba Tayese and he has been awarded several community and professional awards”.\n\nAll road constructions and network leading to Apapa, the nation’s port city, will be completed by October, Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has assured.\n\nHe said the traffic being experienced in the axis will be cleared once the projects are completed.\n\nSanwo-Olu spoke with reporters after a tour of Apapa and all the network of roads and bridges connecting its environs.\n\nThe Governor visited the Costain bridge, Alaka bridge, Ijora bridge, Marine bridge, Liverpool, Lilipond, Mile 2 etc.\n\nHe said there was need to overhaul the entire Apapa system to improve journey time in and out.\n\nHe said the port authority is building another port in Lekki in collaboration with Lagos State Government, which will be ready in two years to ease the pressure in Apapa.\n\nRead Also: Apapa traffic: Need for stakeholders’ commitment\n\nHe said the government is also in discussion with stakeholders and some private owners to create proper holding bay and with the call system get trucks out of the way and free the roads for easy movement.\n\nHe assured the government, will in a methodical order, develop the whole of Apapa to make it more attractive than it was.\n\n“We are working with various stakeholders and we need to sit together to understand what their challenges are and how best to address the challenges.\n\n“As a government we have a commitment and a sense of responsibility to our people and we must bring about an operation in efficiency system where we do not continue to experience this permanent gridlock that is typical of Apapa and also to be able to regenerate the improvement of the roads and bring proper life back to Apapa,” Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nAll governorship aspirants that lost at the primary of the All Progressives Congress(APC) have pledged to work for re-election of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu.\n\nAkeredolu won the APC primary with a wide margin of 2,458 votes while his closet rival Chief Olusola Oke got 262 votes.\n\nThe former aspirants made the pledge in Akure at a meeting of the APC Advisory Council presided over by National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu, who was represented by former APC National Vice Chairman, South West, Chief Pius Akinyelure.\n\nAmong those that attended the meeting were: Chief Oke, Chief Segun Abraham, Hon Isaac Kekemeke, Hon B.I Idowu, Chief Bode Summonu, Gen. Funso Oyemgyin, Bankole Oluwajana and Tayo Oluwatuyi amongst others.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, Kekemeke said they all decided to work for the success of the party at the October 10 governorship polls.\n\nKekemeke said they would deliver massive votes for Akeredolu’s re-election.\n\n“We have resolved that we have no other party than the APC. We have no other candidate than Akeredolu.\n\n“We have decided to bury our differences and work for the victory of our party.\n\n“What you are going to see form today is a bigger party. A reengineered APC.\n\n“All internal cleavages in our party have been put to rest. It is our party and we have one candidate.\n\n“We are ready. We are united and we have resolved it work together in unison.”\n\nA Senior aide to the First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari, on Saturday denied reports that she was ill.\n\nA section of the media had reported that following the illness Aisha was flown to Dubai, United Arab Emirates , for treatment.\n\nThe nature of her purported illness was not disclosed but the reports seemed to suggest that the First Lady’s alleged ill-health might have been caused by her visit to the widow of the former Oyo State, Mrs Florence Ajimobi, in Lagos, over a week ago.\n\nContacted by phone Saturday, Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity (Office of the First Lady), Aliyu Abdullahi, said there was no danger or emergency to the health condition of the First Lady.\n\nAbdullahi said though he had not been in the State House for a while because work has been skeletal around there for a while, he was sure that the wife of the President was in no health crisis.\n\nRead Also: Aisha Buhari’s actions informed by love for Nigeria – Spokesman\n\nHe said he could not affirm or deny that she might have traveled out of the country, he said he knew the First Lady was not ill and was not in any health emergency condition.\n\nHe also debunked trending reports that she suffered a crisis after visiting Mrs Ajimobi.\n\nHis words: “I have not been around in the State House because the office has been operating skeletal operations since COVID-19 started and I didn’t get any information, but I was assured she is fine.\n\n“Other than that, I don’t know because I’ve not been around in the office.\n\n“There’s no danger, no emergency, no sickness, people just want to peddle fake news. I’m telling you, no emergency, no sickness.\n\n“I’m not confirming or denying the travel, but what I know is that she’s not sick or any emergency because she went to Lagos to see Mrs Ajimobi and something happened there, there’s nothing like that”, he said."
