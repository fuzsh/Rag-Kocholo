        "text": "A former Vice Chancellor of University of Lagos (UNILAG), Oyewusi Ibidapo-Obe, has died of complications arising from the Coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\nThe former University don passed away on Sunday, January 3.\n\nThis was confirmed by the Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities (ASUU) UNILAG branch, Dele Ashiru.\n\nHe said the late professor had been receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Lagos State for about 10 days before he was pronounced dead on Sunday evening.\n\nAccording to him, “Yes, Prof. Ibidapo-Obe is dead. He died today (Sunday) from COVID-19-related complications. The late professor’s family has properly briefed us.”\n\nUntil his death, Ibidapo-Obe was the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council, First Technical University in Ibadan.\n\nAlso, confirming his death, the Registrar and Secretary to the Council of First Technical University, Olayinka Balogun, in a statement, said: “With heavy heart, and submission to the will of God I write to inform Council members of the transition to glory of Professor Oye Ibidapo-Obe, the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council, First Technical University, Ibadan which occurred today 03/01/2021.\n\n“I pray for the repose of the soul of the departed.”\n\nBorn on July 5 1949 and married to Olusola and had four children, Ibidapo-Obe was also former President of the Nigeria Academy of Science.\n\nHe attended Ilesa Grammar School and Igbobi College from 1962 to 1968 and University of Lagos between 1968 and 1971.\n\nThe former vice chancellor was awarded a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc. Hons) degree in Mathematics in the First Class Division by University of Lagos in 1971; a Master’s of Mathematics (M. Maths) degree in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science in 1973 and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Civil Engineering with specialisation in Applied Mechanics/Systems in 1976 both from University of Waterloo, Ontario in Canada.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday ordered the immediate dissolution of the Wale Babalakin-led Governing Council, University of Lagos.\n\nThis was coming as the Buhari administration gave reasons for the reinstatement of the suspended university’s Vice Chancellor, Toyin Ogundipe.\n\nThough Babalakin and some members of the council have since tendered their resignation letters, the latest decision of to Federal Government was in fulfilment of the recommendation of a Special Visitation Panel set up by the President Buhari to resolve the crisis rocking the institution following the controversial removal of Ogundipe.\n\n“President Muhammadu Buhari, and Visitor to University of Lagos has approved the Report of the Special Visitation Panel to University of Lagos.\n\n“The highlights of the findings and recommendations approved by Mr. President are as follows:\n\n“The removal of Professor Oluwatoyin T. Ogundipe as the Vice Chancellor did not follow due process.\n\n“The Vice Chancellor was not granted an opportunity to defend himself on the allegations upon which his removal was based. He should accordingly be re-instated.\n\n“All allegations made against the Vice Chancellor and the management of the University before and after the Constitution of the Special Visitation Panel should be referred to regular Visitation Panel for thorough investigation and necessary recommendations.\n\n“The process adopted by the Council in the appointment of Professor Omololu Soyombo as Acting Vice Chancellor of the university was inconsistent with the provisions of the law relating to the appointment of an Acting Vice Chancellor.\n\n“The Governing Council should be dissolved.\n\n“Mr. President after careful review of the report has approved all the recommendations of the panel.\n\n“Accordingly, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe is hereby reinstated as the Vice Chancellor of University of Lagos.\n\n“The Governing Council of University of Lagos Chaired by Dr. B. O. Babalakin is hereby dissolved,” said a statement by the Director, Press and Public Relations, Ministry of Education, Ben-Bem Goong.\n\nIt would be recalled that Ogundipe was accused of financial impropriety and gross misconduct. He was removed controversially at a council meeting which took place at the headquarters of the National Universities Commission (NUC) in Abuja.\n\nA Member of the Legislative Assembly (Edmonton-South West), Kelechi Kaycee Madu, has been appointed as Minister of Justice and Solicitor General in Alberta, Canada.\n\nPremier Jason Kenney on Tuesday elevated Madu to the justice portfolio from Municipal Affairs in a cabinet shuffle that saw Calgary-Elbow MLA Doug Schweitzer moved from justice to an economic portfolio.\n\nKenney said the appointment of Madu made a powerful statement at a time when Albertans have grown more sensitive to racial prejudice.\n\n“[Madu] is a man who has experienced racial prejudice firsthand and can bring that sensitivity to this important role. I’m excited to have him in that position,” Kenney said.\n\nThe premier described Madu as the first Black Canadian to occupy either provincial or federal justice positions of the justice minister, attorney general or solicitor general.\n\nReacting to his new appointment, Madu expressed gratitude to everyone and promised to uphold fairness and justice.\n\n“Thank you, everyone, for all the well wishes. I am beyond humbled to accept my new role as Minister of Justice and Solicitor General – where I will pursue fairness, equality, and justice for all with every ounce of strength I have,” he said.\n\nMadu was born and raised in Imo State, South-eastern Nigeria. He graduated from University of Lagos with a law degree in 2001. He and his wife moved to Canada in 2005. They are blessed with three children.\n\nMadu, who has practised law in both Nigeria and Alberta, was first elected as an MLA in the April 2019 general election.\n\nGoverning Council of University of Lagos Tuesday endorsed and confirmed the election of Folasade Ogunsola as the new Acting Vice Chancellor of the 58-year-old institution.\n\nThe new vice chancellor is a Professor of Medical Microbiology and had served as the Provost of College of Medicine, University of Lagos.\n\nShe was the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Development Services) of the institution until her election as the Acting Vice Chancellor on Monday.\n\nThe council, led by its Interim Chairman, John Momoh, ratified the appointment at a virtual meeting of the members of the council.\n\nOgunsola’s ratification took place ahead of tomorrow’s inauguration of a Visitation Panel to probe the affairs of the university from 2017 till date.\n\nThe panel is expected to be inaugurated by the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nIt would be recalled that Ogunsola was elected on Monday by the Senate following President Muhammadu Buhari’s intervention, who directed that the then embattled Vice Chancellor, Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, and the former university’s Pro-Chancellor, Wale Babalakin, should step aside for the seven-man panel to review the situation accordingly.\n\nEmbattled Vice Chancellor of University of Lagos, Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, Friday withdrew the lawsuit filed at the National Industrial Court to challenge his sacking by the Wale Babalakin-led Governing Council.\n\nOgundipe had filed an action at the National Industrial Court in Suit No: NICN/LA/D18/2020 dated August 14, where he joined University of Lagos, Council, Senate, Wale Babalakin, Registrar, and Acting Vice Chancellor appointed by the Council, Theophilus Soyombo, as defendants in the suit.\n\nThe embattled vice chancellor, in a statement by a member of his legal team, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN, said he was no longer going ahead with the legal process which he initiated at the National Industrial Court.\n\nAccording to him, “Contrary to the falsehood being peddled by mischief makers, the National Industrial Court has never sat or conduct any proceedings in respect of the court case filed by the Vice Chancellor of University of Lagos, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe.\n\n“No court proceedings ever took place at all and so no decision or ruling has been rendered by the court.\n\n“Indeed, upon detailed consultation with all stakeholders and his supporters in and outside the university, Professor Ogundipe directed his lawyer’s to file a notice of discontinuance of the suit and this has been done on August 21, 2020.\n\n“This is to defer to the authority of the President as the Visitor of the university as Professor Ogundipe has enough time to challenge his purported removal.\n\n“This falsehood is being spread to malign the court and blackmail the judiciary by enemies of the rule of law and due process.\n\n“The general public is therefore advised to discountenance these mindless fabrications as the handiwork of those who are afraid of subjecting their illegal acts to the true test of probity and to be wary of fake news being peddled in place of truth, especially as they relate to deliberate manipulation of court proceedings.\n\n“There was no time that the court sat to fix any date for the case.”"
