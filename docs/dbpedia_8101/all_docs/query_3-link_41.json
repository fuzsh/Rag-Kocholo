        "text": "In response to public outcry regarding the chaotic traffic situation on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, the Federal Government has taken the decision to temporarily suspend further work on the ongoing reconstruction.\n\nThe move aims to alleviate the potential gridlock anticipated during the upcoming Eid-el-Kabir celebration, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by Mrs Olukorede Kesha, the Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, the suspension is a result of several factors, including heavy traffic flow on the Lagos-Shagamu route in recent days, adverse weather conditions, the forthcoming Eid Kabir festivities, and advice from the traffic management team responsible for handling project-related traffic issues.\n\nTo ensure ease of travel during the Eid holiday and minimize the inconvenience caused by traffic congestion at this critical time, construction activities on the significant and busy Lagos-Ibadan highway will be put on hold from Tuesday, June 27, until Sunday, July 2, 2023.\n\nTravelers are urged to cooperate with the Traffic Management Team deployed on the highway to ensure smooth traffic flow.\n\nWith an expenditure of over N315 billion so far, the reconstruction of the 127-kilometer Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is a project of paramount importance.\n\nOriginally commissioned in 1978 by the military government of Olusegun Obasanjo, the road underwent reconstruction under the contract awarded in 2013 during the administration of Goodluck Jonathan, with a budget of N315 billion.\n\nThe Federal Government has approved approximately N240 billion for the reconstruction, out of the total contract value.\n\nThe Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, which links Lagos, Ogun, and Oyo states, serves as a vital transportation route connecting various regions of the country.\n\nInitially, the Federal Government entered into a concession agreement with Bi-Courtney, led by Wale Babalakin, for the rebuilding and management of the road over a 25-year period.\n\nHowever, after the company failed to make progress, the contract was terminated on November 19, 2012.\n\nSubsequently, in July 2013, the Goodluck Jonathan administration commenced the reconstruction and awarded the project to Julius Berger Nigeria and Reynolds Construction Company Nigeria at a cost of N167 billion, with a completion period of four years.\n\nThe ongoing reconstruction focuses on two sections of the expressway: Section I, stretching from Lagos to Sagamu Interchange, and Section II, from Sagamu Interchange to Ibadan.\n\nThe initial concession agreement with Bi-Courtney outlined plans to expand the lanes from Lagos to Sagamu to 10, followed by six lanes from Sagamu to Ibadan.\n\nAdditionally, the agreement included the construction of trailer parks and five interchanges, among other developments.\n\nDespite the projected completion date of 2017, subsequent delays pushed the deadline to the end of 2018 and then early 2019.\n\nHowever, the completion period was further extended to 2021, and in order to meet this revised timeline, the Federal Government granted Julius Berger’s request to close the Berger-Kara section of the road for reconstruction.\n\nIn 2018, the Federal Executive Council approved over N64 billion for additional work on Section I of the Lagos-Sagamu interchange of the expressway project.\n\nThis allocation covered over 43.6 kilometers, including pedestrian bridges and toll plazas, to accommodate the evolving nature of the road.\n\nTransportation sector experts have criticized the Federal Government for unnecessary delays and a lack of effective transport management strategies, which have caused considerable hardship for citizens.\n\nMr. Kayode Opeifa, a former Commissioner for Transportation in Lagos State, highlighted the failure of the Federal Government and its contractor, Julius Berger Plc, to engage local stakeholders, such as state governments, residents’ associations, and transport unions, as the primary reason for the ongoing suffering experienced by individuals along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway."
