        "text": "Kofoworola, one of the children of the late inventor, activist and lecturer, Prof. Ayodele Awojobi, talks about his father’s life and academic feats with GBENGA ADENIJI\n\nPlease briefly tell us about yourself.\n\nI am Kofoworola Awojobi. I practise as a medical doctor. I am the third of the five children of Prof. Ayodele Awojobi’s nuclear family.\n\nCan you recall some of the memories of your growing up with your father?\n\nMy father was homely. He was a quiet person. There was some warmth that emanated from him and all the children shared the mutual feeling. Despite being a quiet person, there was that affection that radiated from him to people around. On the intellectual side, he was always telling us to be studious. He often told us to ‘condense’ our school notes so that we could read up the topics easily during the period of examination. I recall that ‘condense’ was the word he used when advising us to make our school notes compact.\n\nDid he spend time with his family?\n\nMy father took time out to take us out as a family. I remember that we used to patronise some five star hotels to eat breakfast. The waiters already knew our seven-seater table and would usher us in whenever we visited any of the hotels. Sometimes, we could go to the hotels to eat lunch or dinner. He also took us to the Lagos bar beach and lagoon club. We would play games while he whiled away the time with some of his colleagues from the University of Lagos. We also visited relations in the family car.\n\nWhy didn’t you study engineering like your father?\n\nMy father did not influence any of us to make certain career choices. I lost him before it was time to make up my mind on the course to study. Hence, I ended up choosing the course I wanted to study myself. Two of my siblings however studied engineering. One studied mechanical engineering while the other read chemical engineering.\n\nWhat was his method of disciplining any of his children who misbehaved?\n\nI cannot remember anytime my father used either the cane or the whip on any of us. He could use a slipper to show he was annoyed about what any of us did, but he did not use the cane or the whip. He did not also make use of corporal punishment.\n\nWhat kind of preferential treatment did you enjoy in school by virtue of your father’s academic prowess?\n\nI did not enjoy any preferential treatment when I was in the university because of my father’s academic prowess as you put it. The only thing I ‘enjoyed’ as a student was the reaction that people always showed whenever I introduced myself followed by an enquiry Iike, ‘Are you related to Prof. Ayodele Awojobi?’ It happened many times when I was in school. There was really no preferential treatment. Rather than that, there was pressure on me to exhibit the traits of a genius my father was known for.\n\nDid your father show any expectation that his children should exhibit his academic brilliance while in school?\n\nIf my father had any expectation regarding his children exhibiting his academic brilliance, it was in the area of ensuring that we studied hard. He was always asking us to condense our school notes so that we could do well in examinations. His idea of condensing our school notes was to highlight the key points in any topic to readable form. He bought us some exercise books for that purpose. There was no formal arrangement to ensure that I did well in school, it was assumed that I would get by academically without undue stress. I did not feel any challenges in school because my father was a genius. I would not say I felt pressured in school for having an intellectually famous father. I think I was able to handle things well while I was a student.\n\nWere you motivated personally to surpass his academic feats while studying?\n\nI did not go out of my way to study. I recall that I hated reading as a child. I would delay reading till when examinations approached. But I knew that whenever I thought of his brilliance I used to arrogantly tell myself that I could match it. I did well in Mathematics and other calculation subjects and my elder brother always told me that I could do well.\n\nBeyond that, I think everybody is a potential academic genius. Everybody is a potential Prof. Ayodele Awojobi once helped with the right milieu conducive to learning. My father was a bookworm. My father’s uncle told us that he liked reading even as child. Everybody is a potential Albert Einstein given the proper foundation from childhood.\n\nWhat was the reaction of his family when he took to activism?\n\nThere was no need for reaction of any sort because it was a progression of events; things were just unfolding. My father was close to Chief Obafemi Awolowo. He loved the late sage. In fact, Chief Awolowo wrote the foreword to many of my father’s academic publications. So, we knew they had an affiliation. My father also loved the Lateef Jakande education policy. He felt government had no reason not to provide for the people. As an educator, he wanted a system that worked because he was a beneficiary of such a system. Thus, it was a natural course for him to desire good governance. It was not that he woke up one day and took to activism.\n\nTell us about his celebrated conversion of the steering wheel of a vehicle from right-hand to left-hand drive.\n\nI recall that it was an army-green Opel Rekord. The vehicle’s steering wheel was initially a right-hand drive. He thought of converting the steering wheel to a left-hand drive since the country had switched to the left-hand traffic drive at that time. Being a mechanical engineer, he saw the need to do the conversion and it became something that was celebrated in the newspapers. I remember that the vehicle was a family car and I noticed that its steering had become a left-hand drive when he was taking us out in it after the conversion. The second was the Autonov 1 which is an army-type vehicle bought through one of his friends. He fused accelerator, gear, clutch and other vehicle parts in it to generate another steering wheel at the vehicle’s back side. It was an interesting invention. There was a central revolving chair he attached to the vehicle such that one could be driving in an opposite direction and revolved the chair to another side to continue driving in that direction. I recall that he drove us in it on UNILAG campus and people came out to see it. It was very noisy and slow whenever he drove it.\n\nYour father had many nicknames including ‘Dead Easy.’ Did he tell you why he was so named?\n\nHe loved teaching people not only his students but anybody who had contact with him. Teaching was something he really enjoyed doing. He also liked making topics on engineering simpler. He would simplify formulae so that all students could understand what he was explaining. So, after his explanation of any topic or having solved any mathematical problems, he would say ‘Dead Easy.’ That was to capture how simple the topic was. It was from there that his students and many others started calling him ‘Dead Easy.’ Each time he was walking on campus and students shouted ‘Dead Easy,’ we would know that our father was the one passing.\n\nHow did he tackle disagreements with his wife?\n\nAs an intellectual man that he was, he found ways to wriggle his ways out of any disagreements. From the distance that we observed as children, he had a way of calming situations. He was a gentle and calm man.\n\nWhat ideals have you imbibed from him?\n\nI have learnt his thoughtful ways. He would prefer quality solutions to problems. I have imbibed this from him. Also, his calm nature is another ideal I have learnt.\n\nHow did he relax?\n\nMy father enjoyed stretching out on his bed or a chair reading the newspapers. He could take garri Ijebu. Whoever prepared the garri must also ensure that a bit of lime juice was added with ice cubes. At times, he could be reciting lines from famous plays like that of William Shakespeare’s. He could also sing some old tunes. He was a literary and debating pupil while in the secondary school. He was also active in the drama class.\n\nHow did he like to dress?\n\nWhen going to work, he wore dark or light coloured suit. Sometimes, he could complement his dressing with a bow tie. That was how he always dressed to the office. For social events, he liked wearing buba and sokoto with an agbada to match (native attire).\n\nWhat was his favourite meal?\n\nLike I said earlier, he liked taking garri ijebu. He would prefer it to be soaked with lime juice or milk. He liked to say, ‘Go and make me my garri,’ whenever he was at home. He also liked bokoto (cow leg).\n\nHow sociable was he?\n\nMy father never went out of his way to socialise. He was sociable in a private way. He socialised by engaging in intellectual discourse with his friends with some jokes. That was the kind of man he was.\n\nHow close were you to him?\n\nHe was a kind and quiet father. I was like his right-hand man among his children may be because I was very playful. I would be the last person to sleep and whenever he was coming home late, he was sure I would be awake to open the door for him.\n\nWas he involved in any sports?\n\nYes, when he was young, he was involved in badminton, table tennis and athletics.\n\nWhat was his normal daily schedule?\n\nWhen we were young, he would drive us to school. He would leave home before 7pm to go to school. He often returned home late.\n\nHow did he die?\n\nHe had a protracted illness. He was managed by some doctors before his death. I would not say I know the exact cause of his death. Perhaps, I am talking as a medical doctor. If someone dies, there is an exact medical cause of the death traceable to a chain of events which one can put together to say, ‘this is the primary cause of the death and this is the secondary cause of the death.’ I cannot really say the exact cause of his death because I was young then.\n\nWhere were you when he died?\n\nI was at home when he breathed his last. We are coping as a family after his death. But it was tough for a while especially as my mother took up the role of the breadwinner after his death. It was not long after she retired as a nurse that the incident occurred.\n\nWhere is your mum now?\n\nShe is in Lagos.\n\nHow has his name opened doors for you?\n\nMy father’s name has not opened any doors for me. His name will open doors if I go out of my way to announce that I am one of his children. By nature, I am conservative. I have never gone to anybody to use his name to seek favours.\n\nAre there plans by his family to organise a memorial event 30 years after his demise?\n\nAs a nuclear family, I do not think there are plans to organise any memorial event to commemorate 30 years of my father’s death. I think each of us is busy with individual struggles. If we are all relaxed, have time and the wherewithal, we could have planned for it. We are too busy looking for money to pay the school fees of our children. Is this not an irony? My salary probably cannot pay the tuition of a child per term.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I studied Law at the University of llorin and earned a Master’s degree in Law at the University of Ibadan. I hail from Ilorin in Kwara State. I am married and have children. I am best described as an actor and a lawyer.\n\nDidn’t your father encourage you to study Acting instead of Law since you seem to enjoy the former?\n\nI have always wanted to be a lawyer. My father always told us when we were young that he would support us on any career choices we made. Since I decided I was going to study Law, he was very supportive. He gave me all the needed support and encouragement. My passion for acting started when I kept seeing him on television while I was young. At a point, I felt like acting too. When he noticed my interest in acting, he did not discourage me. Rather, he encouraged my interest in the two careers. My father did not force any career on any of his children. He left us to study the courses we showed interest in and have capacity for. I must also say that he influenced me indirectly as an actor because if I had not enjoyed his acting style while I was growing up, there was no way I could have showed interest in acting.\n\nHow do you feel each time you feature in a movie with him?\n\nThe father-son relationship ends the moment we are on set. We instantly become professional colleagues and have to creatively interpret our roles. That notwithstanding, I always have the confidence that whenever I am on location with him, the movie being produced at that time cannot be less qualitative. This is because of his experience as an actor and the fact that I learn from him. Whenever we are on set, it is a different thing because acting is make-believe and we have to make the audience have a feel of reality. It is no more a father-son relationship but purely on professional basis. We have featured together in many movies. I recall that I played the role of a thief who robbed him in one of the films we acted in together. We featured together in movies such as Alade Owala, Jelili and Sonto Alapata among many others.\n\nWere you opportune to receive tutelage under Ojo Ladipo (Baba Mero) who was your father’s boss and mentor?\n\nI was not opportune to be trained by him. I was extremely young when he died.\n\nHow many wives does your father have?\n\nMy father has two wives.\n\nSome people believe that his family is large. What is your view about this?\n\nGod will continue to enlarge our family coast. My father is blessed with both male and female children who continually make him proud in their chosen careers. I guess you are aware that a Yoruba adage says, A kin ka omo fun olomo. (one does not count the number of children a man has). So, I will not want to say the exact number of my father’s children. But I can tell you that he has about 12 children who are graduates.\n\nHow does he handle misunderstanding with his wives?\n\nIt is only my father that can answer that question.\n\nHow does he relax if he is not on location?\n\nMy father stays with his family at home. He does not like going out if there is no genuine reason to do so. I remember when I was still staying with him, he was always indoors whenever he had no movie shooting to do. He would take us out in his car to visit some places as a family.\n\nWhere were the places he used to take his family to for relaxation?\n\nHe used to take us to Amusement Park in Lagos during Christmas celebrations. We would ride horses and have a great fun. I remember that vividly. He would ensure we enjoyed ourselves to satisfaction. We had almost everything we wanted anytime he took us out.\n\nWhat is his favourite meal?\n\nHe likes amala and bush meat. During the outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease in Nigeria, I called him and he started laughing because he already knew what I wanted to say. I told him to be careful eating bush meat with its link with the virus.\n\nDid he visit you while you were in the university?\n\nYes, he visited me when I was in the university many times. I always felt on top of the world each time he visited. It was always a wonderful time for me on campus because many people who recognised him also expressed curiosity to know who he came to see.\n\nWhen they discovered that he came to visit you, did colleagues and lecturers alike give you preferential treatment?\n\nThere was no preferential treatment extended to me by classmates or lecturers on account of who my father is. If anything, my father’s visits only gave me recognition in school. My lecturers were strict and besides, there are regulations set by the school authorities for all students. I did my first movie when I was in part-one, hence my father’s visit further boosted my profile and popularity as a student.\n\nWhat kind of father is he?\n\nMy father is a highly principled and approachable man. He is a very wonderful man. He whistles to call my mother or to get her attention. They have maintained that method before I was born. If anyone of us tries to imitate him by whistling, my mother will know and will not answer. I think it is because she is familiar with his style of whistling to her.\n\nHow did he punish any of his children who misbehaved?\n\nHe neither used the cane nor the whip on any of us. We always tried not to offend him. We were often sober and remorseful whenever he expressed disappointment over any wrongdoing or told us not to talk to him for the moment. My mother was the one who used the cane.\n\nWho are his friends?\n\nHe has many friends. They cut across all disciplines but there are no politicians among his friends. There are some of his friends that they have been together since his childhood days.\n\nWhy are there no politicians among them?\n\n(Laughs) I really do not know.\n\nWhat kind of songs does he listen to?\n\nMy father enjoys the songs of Ayinde Barrister, Ayinla Omowura, Yusuf Olatunji and Fela.\n\nWhat is his preferred mode of dressing?\n\nHe dresses based on the occasion he is attending. But most times, he wears native attire.\n\nWhat ideals have your father taught you?\n\nThe first and major one is to be good to people regardless of their status, religion or ethnic leanings. He always says it pays to be good to fellow human beings. I have imbibed this and I try to be good to anybody I encounter in my daily interactions. He has also taught me patience and honesty. These are the core values I appreciate in him and do thank him for instilling them in me. I am also trying to make sure those close to me exhibit same to people around them.\n\nSince your father has two wives as you said earlier, are you also going to take after him in that regard?\n\nI don’t think so.\n\nWhy don’t you think so?\n\nIt is not my wish.\n\nHow has your father’s name assisted you when people know you are related to him?\n\nThere are several of such instances. He is a very good man. Even before I started acting, people often identified thus, ‘’Omo oga Bello niyen o’’ (That is the son of Oga Bello) I get special attention in many areas. When he was young, he was nicknamed Oba because they said he has traits of a leader. If anybody calls him by the appellation, he will know that the person must have known him from childhood.\n\nWhat is his favourite drink?\n\nMy father neither drinks nor smokes.\n\nWhat kind of car does he like?\n\nHe likes to ride any brand of Toyota.\n\nHow sociable is he?\n\nWhen one considers the nature of what he does, he should have no reason not to go out and socialise. But he always tries to select the kind of social gatherings he attends. He also tries to enjoy himself in moderation whenever the need arises. He is not the kind of person one finds at every social event except it is vital for him to attend.\n\nWhat image do you think your father has been able to make in Nollywood?\n\nTo the glory of God, he has been able to distinguish himself in the industry. When he celebrated his 50 years on stage, there were accolades from people and colleagues who have interacted with him.\n\nHow do you feel being his son?\n\nI feel proud and honoured. It is my prayer that people will speak positive things about me more than they speak about my father.\n\nAre there things you think people expect from you as his son?\n\nThere are some people who think that having served my father, they should reap the gains from me. I try to be diplomatic in my approach. The ones that I can handle I do and those that I cannot, I stay away from.\n\nWhat pieces of advice does he constantly give you?\n\nMost times, he always tells me to remain respectful as I have been. My father appreciates the fact that I am respectful but he constantly reminds me to remain so. He also advises me to be tolerant of people and be honest in whatever I do. I do not forget any of them. I continually remember them daily.\n\nDid he tell you how he came about the nickname, Oga Bello?\n\nHe did not tell me because I did not ask him. It is an appellation which I think he earned on stage.\n\nWhich of his movies do you like most and why do you like it?\n\nI like the movie, Emi Abata, which he produced about 10 years ago. In Yoruba, Emi Abata literally means ‘For the sake of someone.’ For example, one can say because of Bello, we give Femi the opportunity to do this thing. I featured in that movie too. I like the movie so much because it also mirrors my own experiences in life because I am enjoying my father’s goodwill.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I am the first child of (the late) Otunba Adeniran Ogunsanya.\n\nHow was growing up with your dad?\n\nGrowing up in our house was a marvelous experience. So many great men came to our house; Adegoke Adelabu, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sam Mbadiwe, (the late Chief Obafemi) Awolowo, and so on. That shows you how they were at that time. They were not enemies because they belonged to different political parties. Also, my dad was full of jokes and he liked to laugh a lot. We used to joke together and we were always laughing in the car. Today, we still laugh at his jokes when we remember something funny he said at one time or the other that had come to pass.\n\nHow does it feel to be the daughter of such a famous man?\n\nThe man himself, without the greatness, was such a wonderful person. I will always be grateful to God for him. I say to people, if I would come in another life, I would like to return as my father’s daughter.\n\nWhat are some of the values you learnt from him?\n\nOne of the values is to love people and treat them as equals. When we were children, we weren’t allowed to call our maids or house helps who were older than us by their names. We called them Mr., Brother, or Sisi something. We gave them respect. It’s just the general belief that human beings should be treated well and respected. In other words, respect begets respect.\n\nWhat kind of father was he?\n\nHe was a friend, he was a listener. For me, he was both my mother and father. I came back from England with him in 1953. When I was a little girl; he was just wonderful to me. At a stage he used to plait my hair. Even when I had my kids, he would help me, he would carry them and sing for them whenever they cried. He was a good father and he was a very humane human being. He also believed in God, he was very active within his church. I’ve been blessed so much to have had a father like him. And he was a father to all. He loved people genuinely. He loved politics, and he was a very consistent politician.\n\nWhat made him different from today’s politicians?\n\nI think most of the politicians during his time were special people. Though they were in different parties, they still related with one other. When it came to the (political) battlefield, each person would fight for his own cause. But, it’s not like today. People were not as hungry and as greedy as they are today. They were different, they fought for independence, and they served their country. They had a genuine concern for the welfare of their communities and constituencies. Of course, there are still people like that, but you know the majority were that way during my father’s time. Also, they had ideologies. I still think that, whatever faults they might have had, they were better politicians than the ones of today.\n\nWhat were his views about national politics?\n\nMany people describe my dad as a detribalised Nigerian. Tribe didn’t matter to him at any stage in his life. In his early days, he had his primary school education in Calabar (Hope Waddel), and he spoke fluent Efik. He believed in the oneness of Nigeria. I remember my father being excited at the thought of any inter-tribal marriage. He wanted to see more of it because he believed in a one Nigeria. He wasn’t a bitter person. He once told me that whenever he flew into Enugu, he always felt like he was going home, and that he was touched by the warmth he always received. If someone who was from the West felt like that, then indeed he was a true Nigerian.\n\nDad wasn’t a greedy man. He didn’t think much about the accumulation of wealth; it didn’t matter to him. He believed in helping people and he wasn’t a showy person. Dad connected with the masses. He used to stop and park his car if he saw young boys playing football. He loved football. He wasn’t controversial and didn’t make himself controversial. He was humble, he was a very brilliant lawyer and politician, and he tried to be very efficient. Dad was a minister in the First Republic, then he became a pioneer commissioner in Lagos State. He was Attorney-General, he also became the commissioner for education. Being the commissioner for education was one job I think he enjoyed thoroughly.\n\nWould you say your dad’s name has opened doors for you?\n\nMy dad did so well and left a lot of goodwill. So, it would be callous of me to say that it doesn’t rub off on me. Certainly it does, and I have no apologies for that.\n\nDid your father influence your going into politics?\n\nYes, I can safely say that I started politics as a young girl, as a child actually, because I used to sing slogans for the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons then while riding in a van, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. In fact, I had a registration card of the Zikist National Vanguard, it was only to humour me as a child; their meetings were held weekly or fortnightly in our house on Apapa Road. I started quite early and I used to follow my dad everywhere. I think he saw the potential in me and he encouraged me; I’m glad he did. My two brothers are also interested in politics. They are in the Peoples Democratic Party. We are all interested in politics one way or the other.\n\nWhat do you think your dad would have said about you being a strong member of the All Progressives Congress, while your siblings are of the PDP?\n\nThat is democracy. God knows that I love my brothers very much. It doesn’t take anything from me. You called my brother and he told you to call me. That’s the way we are. We are not controversial and we’ve not made dad’s name controversial after death by fighting among ourselves. My dad taught us to love one another, and that no matter our differences, we should always resolve them.\n\nWhat would have been his views about the APC and the PDP?\n\nI think his views would be that they are both national parties. Then, he was always a part of national parties. But, I don’t think he would have been against my choice. What he wouldn’t have agreed with was if I had decided to change parties again now, that is, after changing parties in 2006; I think he would have thoroughly given me a good talking to, because he was a very consistent person. It was just a necessary decision I had to make in 2006. If he were around, he would have agreed with me. Most of the decisions I’ve made in politics are from what he instilled in me.\n\nWhat do you miss most about him?\n\nI miss his friendship and his being there. I miss his jokes. He had a wonderful sense of humour. I used to have some really good laughs with my dad. The day he died was a very bad day for me. He had been ill, but it was controllable. Till today, I still feel the vacuum. I think my siblings feel that way too. He was a friend and father. He wasn’t a dictator. He was somebody one could approach. I think my siblings would tell you the same thing. He was going to 79 when he died.\n\nDo you think he died fulfilled?\n\nHe was a bit disillusioned about the way Nigeria was going. He would feel really bad about the country if he were still alive today. But, let’s just pray that things get better.\n\nDid he regret not becoming the governor of Lagos State?\n\nNo, he did not regret it. But, he would have loved to be governor, and he would have made a good governor because of his performance in everything else he did during his lifetime. Later, I became quite close to Alhaji Lateef Jakande because he was a leader of the party I joined, the Social Political Party. I was going to meetings in his house. Later, some people went to my dad to tell him that he should call me to order. But, my dad replied them, ‘What are you (people) talking about? Jakande is her party’s leader. Is he supposed to come to her house? She has to go there.’ He told me not to bother about them, and he supported me. That was the kind of man my dad was.\n\nHow did he create time for his family?\n\nThere was a time earlier on, when he held party posts; he was national chairman, Nigeria Peoples Party, and during the NCNC, I think he was one of the primary House of Representatives members; he held many positions, he was chairman, the Federal Loans Board. He also had a law practice. So, he was busy. He spent a lot of time out of the house, but he found time to be with us. I remember we used to go out on Sundays when we were much younger; he would drive us around and he would buy us ice-cream. He found time during Easter and Christmas; we had holidays together abroad, my step-mum, my brothers and I.\n\nHow did he discipline his children whenever they erred?\n\nOh! I got slaps now and then, but not often, far, far apart, and when I grew up, it stopped. We began to understand each other. He had other ways of disciplining us.\n\nHow did he react whenever he was angry?\n\nMy dad never used strong language; the highest he would say was, “Silly boy! Silly girl!” Or, “foolish man! Silly man!” He didn’t use bad language, and, it wasn’t part of our upbringing.\n\nWhat was his daily routine like?\n\nWhen dad woke up, he expected everybody to be up at the same time. He had his bath early and would go to court. When he came back (from work), he could wake you up at 1 o’clock because he wanted to talk. He could stay up late working if he had a case. Each time they banned politics; he went back to his law and practised. He kept himself busy, but he loved politics.\n\nCan you describe your dad’s relationship with Azikiwe?\n\nMy dad’s relationship with Zik was a fantastic one. That’s Zik’s photograph there (pointing to the wall). We were like a family and I still feel like he’s part of my family. We are still family friends till date. It was a very close and deep relationship. I remember when I asked Zik, he said, “You know what, Ade, I don’t really know what I did to deserve your father, but I thank God for your father.” When Zik went to Zungeru, where he was born, and he was honoured there, my dad couldn’t go; he (Zik) wrote a letter, a part read, “With your absence there, I felt alone in a crowd.” That was how close they were. My dad first met Zik when my dad was a student in King’s College. I think Zik came to give a talk in the school and my dad had the honour of introducing him. I think that was where the friendship started and it continued until they both passed. My dad had a pen name, which was Gaius Marcus Politicos.\n\nWhat role did your dad play when there was an alleged friction between Azikiwe and Awolowo?\n\nMy dad still called Awolowo, ‘Bra mi’, meaning, brother. Awolowo was at my wedding. My dad had great respect for Awolowo and Awolowo also had respect for him, maybe because of his consistency and forthrightness, but they were in different political parties. At one time, they were together in the United Progressive Grand Alliance; UPGA was an alliance of the Action Group and the NCNC at the time, but it was for a short period.\n\nWhat kind of books did your dad read?\n\nMy dad was widely read. Of course, he read a lot of law books. He was always buying books. He was also a Pan-Africanist.\n\nAside from Zik and the others you mentioned, who were your dad’s closest friends?\n\nOne of his closest friends was T.O.S Benson. He was more like a brother. He was from Ikorodu too. Dad also had a childhood friend called Mr. Shoga. There was also Edward Sankey. Dad had many friends all over the country.\n\nHow sociable was he?\n\nHe went to many parties, he was a function-goer, but he didn’t drink and he didn’t smoke. He had a good itinerary of functions to go to almost every weekend and there were commitments for one reason or the other. But he wasn’t a social person that would go in front of the band and dance.\n\nWhat were his likes and dislikes?\n\nDad loved beautiful women, and that says it all. My dad loved good food, and he loved dressing well. He took his time about his dressing and his appearance. He wasn’t over-elaborate, but he liked to dress well. He didn’t like loud, vulgar people. Some people are loud that it borders on vulgarity. He believed that if you did something wrong you should own up to it. He liked fun-loving and outspoken people. He was a total democrat as far as I am concerned. He loved Kings College. He was President of Kings College for a very long time and he just took delight in the school. If it were possible, he would have dressed me up like a boy and sent me there (laughs). But all his grandchildren, at least the older ones, went to Kings College, and that was a delight for him.\n\nWhat kind of music did he like?\n\nMy dad loved the music of Fela Anikulapo Kuti and Hurbert Ogunde. Fela used to make him laugh. He also liked Ambrose Campbell and Tunde Nightingale; there were one or two songs of Ebenezer Obey that he liked. And in my family, we also had great affection for Sunny Ade. My dad also liked listening to oldies, such as Frank Sinatra.\n\nWhat was his favourite meal?\n\nHe liked eba with vegetable or egusi soup. He also liked eko. He always ate light meals at night.\n\nHow was his relationship with your mum and step-mum?\n\nLet me explain it this way, my mum and dad parted ways when I was a child. But you could never say a word against my mum to my dad, and you could never say a word to my mum against my dad. That helped me a lot because it took away a lot of problems. They still looked out for each other, communicated with each other. He also loved my step-mother very much. My dad had good relationships with women. He wasn’t someone who ill-treated women. He believed that he should cater for his women and he did that. And that is something that is lacking in many men today. An elderly lady told me recently that my dad was supposed to marry her, but he didn’t, that she refused him. But, she said he was never nasty or aggressive towards her. She said she had a friend in him till the day he died; and that when he died, it hurt her very much because he was very cordial. That touched me.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He speaks about his father’s career with GBENGA ADENIJI\n\nPlease give a brief profile of yourself.\n\nI am Babajide Awoyinfa. I work with the News Agency of Nigeria. I am the first son of Mr. and Mrs Mike and Olubukola Awoyinfa. I studied Political Science at the Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State. I have two brothers who are twins.\n\nDid your father influence you to choose journalism?\n\nWhen I graduated, it was hard for me to get a job. I was at home for about a year. I enjoy reading and writing like my father. At a point, I applied to the NAN and I was invited for an interview. I passed the written test and oral interview. I must add that my father’s influence played no role in my getting employment at NAN. It was a job I got based on merit. I proved that I am capable of writing without leaning on my father’s journalism popularity.\n\nDid your father persuade his children on their career choices?\n\nNo, my father did not influence the career choice of any of his children. For instance, Taiwo is an information technology expert while Kehinde is an engineer. On my own part, I chose journalism because I have a passion for it. Like I said earlier, I like reading and writing. These hobbies must have played a key role in my choosing journalism.\n\nYour father is a notable name in Nigerian journalism, what kind of person is he at home?\n\nMy father is a calm man. He is also a shy person. He does not like facing the crowd. His best method of communicating is through writing. He is also a man that likes to keep to himself. He is current and tries to keep abreast of recent happenings.\n\nCan you recall the places he took his family to for relaxation when you were growing up?\n\nYes, he used to take us to Whispering Palms, Lagos. We would have fun as a family; discussing and savouring every moment. We were always out to watch movies. But now that we are grown-ups, we do not have the luxury of such picnic. All the children are now busy trying to be on their own.\n\nHow does he relax?\n\nMy father does not relax. Whenever he is at home, he puts on his laptop and starts working on the headlines for the paper’s next edition. He will be thinking on the new angles to introduce to the editor to keep the paper ahead. When he was with The Sun newspapers as its managing director, he hardly slept. Even now, if he is not on Instagram, he will be on Twitter, Facebook or BlackBerry messenger. He is not an old school man. He belongs to the new school because he always updates himself. There is no question on anything that he will not show knowledge of; music, fashion, politics etc. He knows so much than us when it comes to music despite our deep knowledge of it. There was a day he came to me and said he just listened to the music of a Nigerian dancehall singer, Patoranking (Patrick Okorie) and that the musician would go far. I was shocked and asked him how he knew the singer. He told me that he listens carefully to his songs.\n\nWhat part of his job do you find challenging?\n\nThe part I find challenging is his dedication to the writing of biographies despite his busy nature. He, with his late friend, Dimgba Igwe, had written a number of biographies for some prominent Nigerians. I hope to have the strength and skills to do same in future.\n\nIs he encouraging you to continue with journalism?\n\nYes, he is. In fact, he told me to earn a master’s degree to augment my first degree. He also told me that to succeed on the job I must be passionate about it. My father said the passion would eventually assist me to make headway in it.\n\nWhat special treatment did you enjoy in school because of who he is?\n\nWhen I was in the university, he was the MD of The Sun newspapers. I was popular among friends who often requested me to buy them lunch or pay for things they bought. They thought my father was a rich man not knowing that he was just struggling. To them, he was one of the top earners in Nigeria and I must let them enjoy part of his wealth. I ended up acceding to a few requests which I could handle on my own. His popularity did not earn me any special recognition from my lecturers. I faced my studies well.\n\nDid he visit you while you were in the university?\n\nHe never had time. It was on the day of my convocation ceremony that he visited. He was very busy throughout my university days. Even that day, no one knew it was him. He likes privacy. He does not like to announce himself anywhere he goes to. That day, only few people knew he was the one and immediately he exchanged pleasantries with them, he withdrew to his quiet nature.\n\nWhat kind of music does he listen to?\n\nHe listens to all kinds of music. He listens to reggae, rock, rhythm and blues, juju, hip-hop and so on. He can wake up late in the night and listen to any of the songs. He also knows the lyrics of all the songs he listens to. His family is also aware of his love for music.\n\nHow did he react to the news of the death of his friend, Dimgba Igwe?\n\nThe day he lost his twin brother (that’s how we refer to the late Igwe) was a very sad day. We were in the UK to attend the graduation of one of my brothers. We were going for a picnic in the morning of that fateful day when I heard my father shouting, “What happened, what did you say?’’ on the telephone. He was talking to somebody in Nigeria. I rushed out and asked him what happened. He only said, “I don’t know what happened. Dimgba is dead.’’ We had to call the person back and she told us to call somebody in our house because someone had just died. We called a cousin of mine who was at home and asked him what happened at home. He said there was no problem. We told him not to end the call and go to Dimgba’s home nearby to find out what happened. He later told us that Dimgba was dead. The shock was too much for my mother to bear. She started crying while my father was just saying, “My pillar is gone. I am finished.” Everybody was just shouting and we were cautioned not to invite the police into the neighbourhood with our noise. My family was wrapped in grief. Since I was born, that day was the saddest moment of my life because we lost somebody who was dear to my family. My father did not cry but he was really sad that day. I have never seen him cry.\n\nWhat is his normal schedule?\n\nHe wakes up at 6am to prepare for work and returns around 8pm. When he gets home, he resumes reading and writing.\n\nWhat comes to your mind about him each time you read his column?\n\nThe headline he casts for his column draws attention. He has a knack for casting good headlines. He also starts his column in a very dramatic way. He does it in a way that even a layman will understand what he is saying. He carries everybody along in his column because he treats contemporary issues. He writes like a preacher. I never get bored reading his column. I laugh each time I read him because his style is great. I am trying to emulate him because what I do now is purely reporting.\n\nWhat is his favourite meal or drink?\n\nMy father likes Semovita and okro soup. He also enjoys red wine but he stopped drinking a year ago. Sometimes, he can take a little to help him sleep but he does not take beer.\n\nHow does he like to dress?\n\nHe dresses like a typical Yoruba man. He wears native attire but also likes English dresses.\n\nWho are his friends?\n\nMy father has no friend again. He lost his best friend recently. He told me that my mother and his children are now his best friends. He was very close to Dimgba Igwe that it would be hard for anybody to replace him. Their relationship was so deep that we were suspecting if what they had was more than friendship. They were very fond of each other. They would sit in a corner in each other’s house depending on who was visiting the other to talk. Nobody can understand Awoyinfa like Dimgba Igwe did. We are however happy that the two of them broke ethnic barriers to be intimate. It is something I think Nigerians should emulate. It will further progress our nation.\n\nIs he into any sports?\n\nYes, he used to jog from his house to the bus-stop every morning. Everybody in the area knew him especially as he always wore a Chelsea or Nigerian jersey while jogging on the street. But since his ‘twin brother’ died, he started jogging within the compound of his house. They used to jog together until the unfortunate incident caused by a hit-and-run driver. He does not want to jog outside so that people will not pity him when they see him jogging alone. My father blamed himself when the driver knocked down his friend that he could have saved him if he were around. We had to tell him that Dimgba Igwe’s family also wanted to save his life too like he wished. Hence, he should stop blaming himself or thinking he could have saved him if he were around at that time.\n\nWhat are the ideals you have learnt from him?\n\nMy father is a very calm man and I have imbibed that too. He is also very honest. My father can never cheat anybody. I have learnt that from him too.\n\nHow sociable is he?\n\nHe has a bad social life. He knows that himself. The things that keep him sociable are the social media.\n\nHow does he handle disagreements with his wife?\n\nI have never seen them disagree. My father has never laid a hand on his wife. He once called us to say that we should never beat any woman no matter the provocation. We have learnt a great deal from that advice. My mother is very agile and occasionally if she is upset, my father knows how to calm her down. They are compatible and that is the reason we live as a happy family.\n\nHow has his name helped you?\n\nI get opportunities when people know he is my father. A boss of mine once told me that he learnt so much when he worked with my father. I was so happy with that testimony but I don’t allow the respect and love people have for him to get into my head.\n\nHow comfortable is he?\n\nHe is comfortable in his own way. He is neither rich nor poor though some may think he is a wealthy man. The little he has he invests on our education. He can deny himself anything to see that his children achieve their educational dreams. There was a time one of my brothers told him he would like to take groundnuts to the UK when going back to continue his studies. My father drove out to buy it and I was surprised that his children sent him on an errand and he went. But that is my father, one cannot predict him when it comes to what he can do to show his love for his children.\n\nHow did he discipline any of his children who misbehaved?\n\nMy father verbally corrected us whenever we did something wrong while growing up. There was a time I did something wrong. He expressed his disappointment through verbal outburst. That day, I wished he had beaten me because his words were harsher than the cane. My mother was the one who used the cane when we did wrong.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He talks about the kind of life his father leads off stage and outside the classroom with GBENGA ADENIJI\n\nPlease give a brief profile of yourself.\n\nI am Adetoyese Oyewo, a graduate of Geography from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State. I am the third son of Dr. Adekola and Mrs. Olajumoke Oyewo. I am a professional photographer and property merchant.\n\nWhat memory of your growing up with your father can you recall?\n\nWe are five boys and it was fun growing up with my dad. My father is a very kind man and he always puts his family first. If I should start narrating the kind of fun we had when we were young, I am sure that I would make volumes of books on it. There were times we went to the farm with him. Also, there were times we had to wait till late in the night for him to return from rehearsals so that we could eat from the leftovers of his meals. We would gather in the night to pray before going to bed. It is hard to be with him and not laugh. He is fun to be with. He is also my friend and not just my father.\n\nWhere were the places he took his family to for relaxation while you were young?\n\nWhenever my father wants to relax, there is only one place he goes to; it is his hometown, Oba Ile in Osun State. That was where he often took us to for relaxation while we were growing up. My father is not a rich man hence he does not have the luxury of taking us abroad for holidays. But at his villa (Oba Ile), we would drink from the same calabash; eat a mountain of pounded yam sitting on bare floor. At times, he could decide to drive us to the zoo in OAU to see the animals.\n\nYour father is a lecturer and actor; did he encourage any of his children to follow in his footsteps in terms of career choice?\n\nYes, he did encourage his children to follow in his footsteps. Being a lecturer and actor, some of his children also pursued careers that are related to his disciplines. For instance, some of his children are into researching, acting, photography and production. These are disciplines that are connected to his chosen fields.\n\nWhich of the movies he featured in is your favourite and why?\n\nHe has featured in many superb films. But I love his acting on stage. Through that, he displays his artistic prowess and unique rendition of lines. Since you want to know the movie he had featured in which I like most, I will pick Saworoide. He interpreted the role excellently. The role he played in the movie also brings a similar performance he displayed in The Gods Are Not To Blame in which he acted as King Odewale.\n\nHow does he create time for his family?\n\nMy father is someone who loves his family so much. Hence creating time for his family is quite an easy thing for him. Whenever he is not having any performance, his attention is always on his family. There were times we played football together as a family in the front of our house. My mother was also part of the team.\n\nHow did he discipline an erring child?\n\nMy father cannot stand any child that is spoilt or untrained. We were always careful not to offend him when we were growing up. We knew that it would not be a good thing for us to provoke him. He would use the cane if he should. But he always ensured that he told the child that misbehaved what he did so that he would not repeat the same thing again. Though he cares so much for us, he did not spare the rod. He is a disciplinarian. However, I see him as my good friend no matter the punishment he gave me for misbehaving. There was a day he beat me for doing something wrong. If I remember correctly I was supposed to grind corn that we wanted to use to make pap. When I was leaving home, he told me not to take the short cut home after grinding the pap because he knew that I could take the route. He warned me so that I would not throw away the corn because the path was narrow. But I thought I was smart and disobeyed him. On the way, I slipped and the ground corn in a big bowl placed on my head fell on the ground. When he discovered what happened, he beat me silly with the ground corn smeared all over my body. It was not a funny day at all.\n\nWho are your father’s friends?\n\nMy father has two major friends that I know of. The first one is actor Peter Fatomilola and the late Laide Adewale who was also an actor. Those are his closest friends even though he has many other people who are close to him.\n\nWhat is his best form of relaxation?\n\nMy father likes to relax by lying on the bed and reading. When he was younger, he would be in company with his friends drinking beer. They really enjoyed their youth.\n\nHow close are you to him?\n\nHe is my good friend. We are very close. In fact, the love between us is so strong that my brothers are aware of it. Even till now, our relationship is like that of a brother and friend not like that of a father and son.\n\nWhat kind of father is he?\n\nAdekola is the kind of father any child will wish to have. He is loving, friendly and caring. I respect him so much and respond to him with ‘Sir.’ I am very obedient to him even when he had nothing.\n\nWhat is his favourite meal?\n\nMy father likes pounded yam. He also likes taking pap and efo in the morning.\n\nWhat is his favourite drink?\n\nMy father used to drink beer but he stopped when he clocked 50 years. He replaced beer with red wine. He enjoys red wine now but occasionally, he drinks brandy. We sometimes drink together with him.\n\nWhat is his normal schedule like?\n\nHe reads after waking up and prepares for work. If there is time, he will have a chat with us before going to location if he has any performance to be part of.\n\nHow do you feel each time you watch him act?\n\nWhen he is acting, I really don’t have any special feeling. I always see him as my father and not the superstar his fans see him as. But I always appreciate his talent and what he has become with the help of his dear wife and especially God Almighty. I must confess that his focus, dream and feats are a big challenge to me and my siblings. We are constantly aware that we have to make him proud in our chosen disciplines.\n\nIn what ways would you say his name has opened doors for you?\n\nThrough his name, I have received some favours and blessings from a lot of people. But most times, I don’t let people know that he is my father except they find out themselves. The name Adekola Oyewo has worked for me a few times but I do not carry it on my head. I believe in making impact in my own little way. I do not use his name to seek favours. As his son, I always enjoyed watching plays free-of-charge in the Dramatic Arts Department of the Obafemi Awolowo University when he was lecturing there. When I was a student, there was no special treatment for me. No lecturer gave me any preferential treatment because of who my father is. OAU is a school where no special treatment is given to any student.\n\nHow sociable is he?\n\nMy father is not sociable. He only attends events which his church organises. I think this development has affected his social life. I am of the view that social events can also help him to network.\n\nWhat kind of music does he listen to?\n\nWhen it comes to music, I know that my father likes listening to the music of King Sunny Ade. He also enjoys the music of the late Sikiru Ayinde Barrister and the late Orlando Owoh. He appreciates good African music.\n\nHow does he like to dress?\n\nMy father loves to appear neat always whether he is wearing a traditional or English attire. He also likes good shoes. He puts on good shoes to match any clothes he wears.\n\nHave you ever watched him teach?\n\nI attended his classes several times. His students always enjoy his lectures too. He is a very practical lecturer.\n\nWhat is his favourite quote?\n\nHis favourite quote is “It is beyond talent.” This quote is hinged on his belief that no matter what one’s talent may be, one needs to exhibit a high level of hard work and dedication to be outstanding among one’s peers.\n\nWhat brand of car does he like?\n\nMy father used to like Mercedes Benz car but because of the state of roads in Nigeria, he now prefers Sport Utility Vehicles. He drives a SUV.\n\nHow does he settle disagreements with his wife?\n\nWhen I was growing up, I cannot recall any day I saw my parents having any arguments. They never quarrelled in front of us. They could have had disagreements but none was open to their children.\n\nWhat are the ideals he taught you?\n\nMy father is a very honest man. This is something one cannot take away from him. I have learnt this and constantly display this in my dealings with people. He also believes in hard work. I have imbibed this ideal too because I am sure that hard work and God’s grace got him to where he is today. Another thing that I have learnt from him is his humility. Humility opens doors even the ones that are shut. From him too, I have learnt not to struggle over material things because nothing lasts forever.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He talks about his father’s career and life with GBENGA ADENIJI\n\nTell us about yourself.\n\nI am Professor Segun Ogunba. I lecture in the Department of Estate Management, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State. I am the first professor in the university whose father was also a professor in the institution. I am the first son of the late Prof. Oyin Ogunba. I have an elder sister, Mrs. Titi Adegbile who is the Head, Legal Department of the Redeemed Christian Church of God.\n\nYour father was a notable figure in the Humanities with interest in African literature, how did he create time for his family in those days?\n\nAt the time he was teaching, specifically at the OAU, he was a very busy man. At a time he was the head of department, vice-dean of the faculty of arts, dean of the faculty, provost of the college of arts and education and chairman, committee of provosts and director of the cultural institute of the institution. But he still created time for his family. He had a regular routine and when he was at home, he would tell us stories about the tortoise. He also sang cultural songs to us. His PhD was on festivals. He studied the festivals of the Ondo and Ijebu people. He was not a Christian until the last hours of his life thus he used to make fun of Christian songs and changed them to cultural songs. For instance he would sing, “Ebora ge mije loru ana ni. Ebora pupa ni lori oke.” (A monster bite me last night. It was a red monster on the mountain.) Even though other members of the family are Christians, he would sing the song to our delight. He gave all of us nicknames. He had a very rich cultural background and some of his students who took his course on oral literature told us how they used to enjoy his course. Even students who did not offer his course liked to be in his class to listen to the cultural songs he would sing to his students. My father was very responsible and full of morals despite not being a Christian. He was very tolerant and quiet. He made sure he gave us adequate attention whenever he was at home.\n\nWhere were the places he took his family to for relaxation?\n\nMy father used to take us to his house in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State. He also encouraged us to visit the Staff Club in the university to play lawn tennis. He took my younger siblings and me to the club to learn the game. The club has a connotation that is it for people who drink hence our mother often discouraged us from going there. But anytime he was going to the club, he would take us along with him. There was a time he was on sabbatical at the University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom. He took his family along. I did one year primary school there. I was about four years old at that time. I recall that he took us canoeing. We travelled to and from the UK on the sea. It was in 1972.\n\nWas he the one who encouraged you to be in the academia?\n\nMy father gave his children freehand regarding career choices. But we actually like the life of lecturing. At least three of us are lecturers. My elder sister is a lawyer but also has interest in lecturing. My father had six children but one died sometime ago. We are five now. I am the second child and the first son.\n\nHow did he relax at home?\n\nHe liked singing and would thrill us with cultural songs. He enjoyed listening to the British Broadcasting Corporation any time he was at home.\n\nDid you have the opportunity of attending his lectures?\n\nYes, I attended his classes many times. Like I said earlier, many students who were not taking his course often attended his classes because they were lively and engaging. He would narrate several festivals and other oral traditions.\n\nWere you treated specially while in the university because of your father’s popularity?\n\nCertainly. Even my being in OAU now was partly because of his influence. There were many applications when I applied to teach in the university and I think his name assisted me too.\n\nWhy did you choose a different career path?\n\nWhen I was at the Federal Government College, Odogbolu, Ogun State, my favourite subjects were Economics and Geography. When it was time to enter the university, I chose Estate Management even though I didn’t know what it was all about then. I got the admission immediately. I also did well in Literature-in-English but Economics was my favourite subject.\n\nWhat was his favourite meal?\n\nHe was a very traditional man. His favourite meal was eba, amala and so on.\n\nHow did he like to dress?\n\nHe dressed traditionally. He loved wearing native dresses. It was hard to see him in English dresses. He had suits but he never wore them. He could put them on only during convocation ceremonies but it was rare to see him wear English dresses without a major reason.\n\nHow did he discipline any erring child?\n\nHe did not use the cane. It was my mother, who was also a lecturer, that used the cane. If we offended him, he would tell us to ‘go to the corner’, raise up our hands and close our eyes. That was how he corrected us and sometimes there could be verbal corrections.\n\nWhich are the ones you enjoy reading among the many books your father wrote?\n\nMy father’s major works were on Wole Soyinka. He worked with Soyinka at the University of Lagos in the sixties. People believe Soyinka’s writing is complex but my father tried to simplify his works in his publications on Soyinka.\n\nWho were your father’s friends?\n\nI hope I can remember their names. I recall that some of them usually visited him at home. They included Profs.Biodun Jeyifo, Ropo Sekoni, Wole Soyinka and Chima Anyadike among others. I remember one day that Soyinka came to our house and my elder sister told him, “I have read all your books.’’ Soyinka smiled and replied her, “Even your father has not despite writing books on my works.’’\n\nWhat was his favourite drink?\n\nHe used to take beer moderately. I never saw him drunk. He used to tell us that beer has medicinal qualities but should not be taken in excess. He loved to take a bottle daily. He used to drink it with some of his friends in the Staff Club at the ‘Elders’ Corner’ either in OAU or the University of Ibadan.\n\nWhat ideals did you learn from him?\n\nI learnt honesty. My father was a very honest man. He never compromised on honesty which was surprising because he was an atheist until few hours before his death. He took his responsibility as a parent seriously. There were times he had to borrow to make sure that he met our basic needs. He was very morally upright. I have learnt all these from him.\n\nHow has his name helped you?\n\nHis name helped me to get some vacation jobs when I was still in the university. I also got some jobs through his name before I started lecturing. Some people after knowing I am his child would exclaim, “So you are his son, he was a good man.’’ He helped many students. When I was at Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, there was a particular lady who told me that my father was her external supervisor. She said her supervisor actually wanted her to fail. She said her supervisor told my father that she deserved to fail but my father refused. There were three occasions like that where his former students told me the same thing.\n\nHow did he die?\n\nHe had a stroke. When he retired from the OAU, he became a contract professor in the Department of English, Ogun State University (now Olabisi Onabanjo University). He actually started lecturing at UNILAG and UI. When professors retire, they can still take teaching contracts renewable yearly. When he got to the institution, he was really stressed there because of the jobs he handled. He had a high blood pressure which he was managing for 40 years. He took tablets everyday for 40 years. He was seriously overworked while in the institution. Many people did not even know that he had stroke. He was living alone while in the university and he had a stroke overnight. We once planned to get him a driver and a domestic servant but he refused. He said we could do all that later, saying he could cater for himself at that time. It was the next day that somebody came to visit him and called him. He was trying to reply the person from inside the room when the person heard a loud sound like someone falling from the bed. It was the person who alerted the people around who broke the door and found him on the floor. He was taken to the Ogun State University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Ogun State. That was where he passed on.\n\nWas there pressure on his children to excel academically while schooling being children of a professor?\n\nEvery one of us has a master’s degree. Two others apart from myself are on their PhDs. Our parents ensured that we were educated in the best schools. We all attended Federal Government Colleges. They were the best schools then except one of us that went to Mayflower, Ikenne. The late Tai Solarin was in the school in those days. We grew up with a lot of books. My father’s library was up-to-date. We were introduced early in life to good books including encyclopedias of various kinds.\n\nWas he into any sports?\n\nHe played lawn tennis. He bought rackets for me and my younger brother who is a doctor. He taught us how to play the game. He was a prominent member of the Staff Club Lawn Tennis Club both at OAU and UI.\n\nHow close were you to him?\n\nI was closer to my mother. So I cannot say I was very close to him. But he was a very warm man. He was a very good father. He never interfered in our affairs even when we got married. He counselled me about marriage a lot.\n\nHow did he ensure peace with his wife?\n\nThere is no family without disagreements. My parents had disagreements but they settled them as they arose. They did not allow them to aggravate. They were compatible actually. My mother died 2005 while my father in 2008.\n\nHow does his family remember him every year?\n\nThere are plans to organise a memorial lecture in his honour. But for now, we have written his former department (English Studies) in OAU to institute a prize for the Best Student in Oral Literature. We intend to award a substantial amount to the deserving student and donate a library to the department in honour of our father.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I am the second son of the late Chief Frederick Rotimi Alade Williams (SAN). I am a Dutch-trained farmer.\n\nHow come you are not a lawyer like your father and some of your siblings?\n\nMy mother went into poultry farming and I was very close to my mother. She had no biological daughter, although she raised a lot of people who I consider to be my sisters and her adopted daughters. So, being very close to her, she taught me about farming, cooking, baking and sewing. Naturally, I developed a love for farming. But, it was not an easy thing for me to break the family tradition. Interestingly, unknown to most people, my father, the late Chief FRA Williams, was a third-generation lawyer. His father, the late Thomas Ekundayo Williams, was a lawyer; so also was his great-uncle, FRA Cole. My elder brother, Chief Ladi Rotimi Williams, is a fourth-generation lawyer. Two of my elder brother’s children, as well as two of my children, are lawyers. So, his children and my children are fifth-generation lawyers. But, I am a first-generation farmer (laughs). My immediate younger brother has two children who are lawyers, and my youngest brother has a daughter who is also a lawyer. So, the law tradition continues in the family.\n\nDid your father influence your siblings’ career choices?\n\nYes, I would say so, in the sense that my father was their hero, especially through all the sensational cases.\n\nCan you recollect some of the landmark cases?\n\nYes. One of them was the revenue allocation formula case, Lakanmi case, where a murder suspect was granted bail by the Supreme Court. Another one was the one which the military government was put in check by the Supreme Court. I also remember that of Chief MKO Abiola.\n\nHow was it growing up with such a famous lawyer father?\n\nHe was a loving father and just like any other good father, he tried his best and created time for us, although he was always very busy. I remember the occasions he tutored me in Geography when I didn’t do too well in the subject. We had a tremendous childhood. I grew up like any normal child of those days. I grew up used to being surrounded by law books and lawyers.\n\nWhat are the other values you learnt from your father?\n\nOur father taught us not to be proud or arrogant. He made us realise that whatever he had achieved, he achieved by dint of hard work, God’s blessing and personal effort. Dad also taught us to be modest and that one cannot claim to be anything by riding on the back of one’s father, except one achieved something by oneself for oneself. He taught us that. I’m happy today that two of my brothers are Senior Advocates of Nigeria. They have their chambers and are doing very well. I have my farm and I’m able to keep soul and body together. I also learnt honesty. He always said that honesty is always the best policy, and no matter how bad one’s situation is, it was always best to tell the truth. We were trained to be modest. We are proud of that upbringing.\n\nHow did he create time for his family?\n\nHe created time for us on Saturdays and Sundays. In those days, when we were much younger, he used to take us to church every Sunday. And during the week, when we were on holidays, we all ate together on the same table. Also, during lunch at home, he would tell us about the cases he went for in court. We would also discuss politics and current affairs.\n\nHow did he discipline his children whenever they erred?\n\nLet me put it this way, for us, after God, it was Papa. The children of nowadays talk back at their father. But, we didn’t do that. It was simply, ‘Yes, Papa; all right, Papa; I’ll do so, Papa.” We revered and loved him so much. In those days, when you say, “I’ll report you to your mummy,” we would say, “Okay, go ahead,” and one would just get one, three to six strokes of the cane. But to mention being reported to Papa was a very serious thing, because none of us wanted him to get angry with us. It wasn’t a question of fear, but of deep love and respect; we held him in such high esteem and didn’t want him to hear anything bad about us. He was deified. We only wanted him to hear good things about us. When they reported us to him, he would say, “Oh, I’m shocked and disappointed.” That was all. But whenever he said that, it made one feel really bad, because when he discussed with you, he brought you up to his level. So, one didn’t want to now fall and be a naughty boy. I think the worst he ever did to discipline us was to tell one to stand at a corner and face the wall. He never used the cane. It was Mama that used the cane regularly. Mama was a no-nonsense woman; she would discipline one appropriately if one went against her rules.\n\nHow did your dad react whenever he was angry?\n\nOne would expect him to shout, but he never did. All he would say was, “I’m disappointed in you.” That was sufficient enough to spoil one’s day and make one feel bad for days to come. He never raised his hand to beat us.\n\nWhat are his likes and dislikes?\n\nHe loved hard work, honesty, and was a man of wisdom. He was irritated by dishonesty, stupidity, and laziness. In those days he used to play lawn tennis and also took part in quite a number of novelty football matches. I remember in the Western Region when he was the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General, he played as a right fullback against the nurses of the University Teaching Hospital, Ibadan. I watched the match. I remember the nurses respected him too much to dribble him (laughs). After that, they all took a group photograph with him standing in the middle. His team won the match.\n\nWhat kind of person was your dad?\n\nHe was a very kind person. He also related with his workers and staff, not on a master-servant basis, but like one big happy family. Today, we still relate with most of his ex-workers and lawyers who served in his chambers, as brothers. That was what he had imbibed in us. He gave free lunch to his staff. Lawyers that passed through papa’s chambers liked to call themselves members of the ‘Black Table,’ because they used to sit together and have discussions at a black table (in the chambers). I designed the table in the 70s.\n\nWho were some of your dad’s contemporaries?\n\nThere were many, such as Afolabi Lardner (SAN), G.O.K Ajayi, Chief Kayode Sofola, Chief Chris Ogunbajo, the late Chief Remi Fani-Kayode, T.O.B Oki, and the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo. My dad and Awolowo were friends. Dad used to say that Awolowo was a brilliant and very thorough lawyer. Also, the very first legal partnership for law practice in Nigeria was formed by my father, the late Bode Thomas, and the late Chief Remi Fani Kayode. I think this was in the 50s.\n\nDo you remember any notable case that pitted your dad and Awolowo against each other?\n\nI cannot recollect that. I know they handled one or two cases together, not against each other; they acted for the same client. But, please note that I read agriculture and not law.\n\nWhat was his normal day like?\n\nHis normal day started at 4.30am. Then, he would have tea or coffee with Mama in their bedroom. And by quarter past five, every day, he was in the office, because the office was located in a section of the house. He washed and dressed for court in his office. In fact, during the time they had tea together, we the children used to say that was the meeting of our own ‘local supreme court,’ because if there was a decision to be taken about one of us, it was during that period they decided on it (laughs). Later in the day, he had lunch and went back to the chambers and closed by 7pm, 8pm or 8.30pm, depending on the exigencies of work. But, he never missed the 9pm news in those days. Of course, he had a big room where sometimes we the children may decide on our own to join him for dinner. By 9pm, he was on his bed, half-asleep and listening to the news. By the time, the news was over, he would be fast asleep.\n\nIt is said that your dad had a library that would surpass those in some tertiary institutions’. Is this true?\n\nYes, that is very correct. The library is still there. I was part of the team that designed the new library. By the virtue of my training, my late father often referred construction and expansion of buildings and anything technical to me. Therefore, the late Chief Wole Obikoya, Nwankwo, an architect and I designed the library. I think the library would have close to 50,000 books.\n\nAs a lawyer, he must have had a voracious appetite for reading?\n\nYes he did. Aside from law books, he read autobiographies and biographies. He read history and things about nature. He was very fond of the British encyclopaedia, but when DSTV came on scene, his best programme was comedy shows. He also liked watching National Geography, Discovery Channel, and History Channel. He particularly enjoyed reading about the Second World War. It used to fascinate him because he was a student in England at the time.\n\nHow has your dad’s name opened doors for you?\n\nMy father’s name has opened doors for me in many ways, especially among the non-Yoruba. But among the Yoruba, it does not always open doors. Let me say the non-Yoruba, like the Northerner, people of South-East and South-South, and so on, respect my father a lot.\n\nWhat was your dad’s favourite meal?\n\nHe loved rice and fresh fish stew.\n\nWhat was his favourite drink?\n\nIn his younger days, it was whiskey and soda. But when he grew older, it was diet Coke, with plenty of ice.\n\nWhat was the genesis of his famous nickname, Timi the Law?\n\nI think there was a big matter in those days, the Henry Willinks Commission. Sir Dingle Foot, the famous British lawyer, was on one side, Papa was on the other side. And of course, the late Dingle Foot had thought the case would be a walkover. But at the end of the case, my father won the case. Dingle Foot went and congratulated him and said that he didn’t realise that Africa had such a formidable advocate. And it was then, that day, that late Chief Awolowo labelled my dad Timi the Law. This happened in the late 1950s or early 1960s. I’m not so sure.\n\nWhat are some of the fond memories you have of your father?\n\nI say this with all truthfulness; he was the best friend of each of his four children. There was nothing I could not talk to him about, and I could always confide in him. And he was like that with the four of us.\n\nWhat do you think is his legacy?\n\nHe believed in the rule of law. What he always stood up for was that we should uphold the rule of law and we should not take the law into our own hands. Upholding the rule of law is the only way any society can function.\n\nHow was his relationship with your mum?\n\nThe love between them was deeper than that of Romeo and Juliet. They were very devoted to each other and they had tremendous respect for each other. No matter how interesting a discussion one might be having with our mum, the moment she heard Papa was back from court, she would say, “Excuse me, I have to go and prepare my husband’s food.” Dad was always her priority and she was always his. She wasn’t a lawyer, but her father was.\n\nWhat would you say about the controversy over his will and estate?\n\nInitially when we had disagreements, I was greatly disturbed, dismayed and very upset. But, I now later realised that there is hardly any family that doesn’t have issues, even where the father left nothing. Now, I’m grateful to God that we have largely settled our differences. Hopefully, very soon, we would all come together to sort things out. But that is largely among the three who are lawyers because they are the ones who would do out the legal drafting and work out something that would be acceptable to all. The interesting thing is that all along, it’s not like we were abusive to each other. Our children and wives are all friends, and I can go to the houses of any of my brothers anytime I choose to. It was just that because three of them are lawyers, they decided to go to court for the interpretation of certain things which was causing problems. We have now resolved that. We know what is displeasing to each one and we have resolved to come together to sort it out. Technically, in principle, it has been resolved. There are no more issues.\n\nWas there any point at which you felt your dad wouldn’t have liked that you and your siblings had a quarrel over this issue?\n\nYes, of course. We all went to my elder brother’s house. My two younger brothers came here to pick me up and we went to see our elder brother, and we were all so happy to be back together. People would always quarrel, it’s natural. Even my parents, as close as they were, they had their ups and downs, but they always resolved it. What would have been disappointing is if the quarrel became permanent and could not be resolved.\n\nWhat do you think your dad would have said about it if he were alive?\n\nI can’t say. Naturally, he would not have liked his children quarrelling. There is nothing new under the sun.\n\nWhat was your dad’s view about the legal profession in Nigeria?\n\nHe had a lot of respect for the judges. He said Nigeria had very good judges that could sit in any court in the world and still perform well. The only problem he always noted was that judges were not well remunerated. He felt judges should be given very good welfare packages. He was very proud of our judges.\n\nWould you like to share any funny incident relating to your father?\n\nI remember being present the day Papa had to appear for a case at the Benin High Court. The other side came with their lawyer. Then, Papa had glaucoma and used eye drops regularly in managing it. He argued heatedly in the court on that day. Later, the judge called for a recess. During the recess, Papa sent me to get his eye drops. By the time the judge came back to the court, he had assimilated Papa’s arguments. So, the judge became more amenable to Papa’s submissions. There and then, he gave a ruling in Papa’s favour. The other lawyer now said, “Kai, that man argued and argued, but when the judge no gree, he go put something for eye. The eye come dey show fire, fire, and judge come agree!” But it was simply the eye drop that papa used for his glaucoma.\n\nWas your dad a very sociable person?\n\nYes, he was very sociable; although, the older he grew, the more he withdrew into his law practice. However, he still attended parties. He was a very good dancer. He could dance Rock and Roll very well. He could do the Fox-trot, he could dance to highlife and juju music.\n\nDid he have any regret?\n\nI don’t think so.\n\nCan you mention the names of some renowned lawyers who passed through your dad’s chambers?\n\nLet me start by mentioning my brother’s names (laughs); Chief Ladi Rotimi Williams (SAN), Tokunbo Rotimi Williams (SAN), and Folarin Williams; they are all accomplished lawyers. And then I can mention Chief Dr. Alfred Bamidele Kasumu (SAN), Mr. Ebun Sofunde (SAN), Kole Abayomi (SAN), Dr. Wale Babalakin (SAN), Chief Mrs. Bola Williams, now Akinjide (SAN), Chief Folake Solanke, the first Nigerian to become a SAN, Jide Ogundipe, and a host of others.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I am the first son of Zeb Ejiro. I have six siblings. I am a graduate of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I studied Mass Communication. I had my primary and secondary education at a private school in Ajegunle, Lagos. I currently run my own entertainment outfit. At the same time, I’m an upcoming artiste.\n\nHow was your childhood?\n\nMy childhood was interesting but I spent part of it with my grandmother who was based in Ilorin, Kwara State. I came to Lagos in 1991 to live with my parents. Despite the challenges we faced as a family, we were able to maintain a strong bound. We didn’t allow any storm to tear us apart. While growing up, my siblings and I didn’t really know my father was popular. Sometimes, when we saw his name or face on television, it felt strange to us.\n\nHow does your father behave at home?\n\nMy father is jovial and fun to be with. He likes entertaining people with jokes, but there are times when he is really strict. Despite his financial freedom, he taught my brothers and me how to be men. He didn’t want any of us to depend on his money. I will be forever grateful to him for that because today, my siblings and I are all doing well for ourselves. He also has a listening ear; whenever any of us was passing through any challenge; he always tried to calm the situation.\n\nWhile in school did he visit you often?\n\nHe was very busy. I think the only time he visited us was during one of our inter-house sports competitions. Other times, he sent his employees to check up on us.\n\nWith his busy schedule, how does he spend time with your mother?\n\nHe enjoys staying at home with her despite his busy schedule. Whenever he decides to spend time with my mother, nothing would take him out of the house. He loves to buy her gifts. Back then we couldn’t understand why he was always buying her gifts; now we understand (smiles). My dad also likes organising parties in the house; he is a good singer and dancer.\n\nDid your siblings follow him in his profession?\n\nMy sisters didn’t probably because they are married, but we, the men, especially me, took after him. Growing up, I used to go with him to shoot movies. I still remember how he would make his casts rehearse their roles several times. My father is a perfectionist. Even though I didn’t follow him in the path of movie production, it is something I hope to do later on.\n\nDidn’t he try to influence his children on their career choices?\n\nNo, he did not. My father is not one to do that. He believes a child should be independent and make his or her decisions personally. The only thing he did was to give us guidelines on how to achieve our career goals. I’ve always loved music, thus when I told him about my passion, he supported me. But I still have a flair for writing stories. I hope to start my own production firm soon.\n\nWhat is your father’s temperament like?\n\nI won’t say my father’s temperament is 100 per cent fine. He can be nice but when he gets upset, you don’t want to be around him, though, he is quick to cool down. When he is in a jovial mood, he is fun to be with. He gets easily irritated especially if he keeps correcting you on the same mistake. Times like that he is quick to beat, my father doesn’t spare us. Some other times he corrects us verbally.\n\nWhat challenges did he face before he got his big breakthrough?\n\nSurprisingly, some months ago, I asked him the same question. He told me his journey to success was a tough one and that things weren’t rosy for him. Years backs, during the British colonial rule in Nigeria, some white men came to train Nigerians who wanted to be movie makers. He applied and was selected for the training programme. After shooting his first movie, he had serious issues with finances. He literally kept walking from one company to another in search of support until one fateful day. On that day, he went to a production house and asked one of the employees to help him make a copy of his movie. My father told me that while the man was making the copy, the manager of the company walked into the studio, saw the movie playing and fell in love with it. The next day, they asked him to come to their studio, after discussing the terms and conditions, his movie went on air. After then, things changed; he got his first breakthrough. This is not to say that he didn’t encounter other challenges, he still did. Gathering his casts all at one location was a huge challenge too because phones weren’t available then. Even bringing out the best in his casts was a challenge. Unlike now when acting has taken a new dimension.\n\nHow would you describe your parents’ marriage?\n\nThey are a beautiful couple, though when I was a child, I didn’t know much about marriage. However, with the little I saw, I admired them. Though, they encountered challenges too, my father was able to calm situations and they didn’t let them affect us.\n\nHow did he handle disagreements with your mother?\n\nHe handled disagreements well most of the time. When he needed to be patient, he was patient. My parents had to constantly forgive themselves.\n\nWhat do you admire most about your parents’ marriage?\n\nThey know how to sail through storms and my father is a lover boy, he loves to buy his wife gifts even when there is no special occasion. Sometimes, he really buys her expensive gifts.\n\nWho were the famous faces you saw at home?\n\nI saw quite a few, but the ones I can remember are Liz Benson, Saint Obi, Kate Henshaw, Ramsey Noah and some others. Most of them used to come to our house to shoot movies.\n\nHow sociable is he?\n\nMy father is one of the most sociable men I’ve seen. Whenever he is in a good mood, there is no dull moment. He keeps you laughing all the way. He is also a good actor. You also need to see him dance; he is a good dancer. He knows how to interact with any one of no matter the age difference.\n\nWhat is his favourite food?\n\nHis favourite is agbu with vegetable.\n\nWhat is his favourite drink?\n\nHe likes red wine.\n\nWhat is it you like about him?\n\nHe is a good mentor when it comes to movie production. He likes to take giant strides, he doesn’t settle for less. He is also a goal getter, one who loves to take risks.\n\nAnd what don’t you like about him?\n\nMy father can be generous to a fault; sometimes people take advantage of him. This is one character trait I don’t like in him.\n\nGrowing up, can you remember your most memorable moment with your father?\n\nWe shared so many memorable moments together, but I can still remember vividly the nights he used to bring home horror movies. I was scared watching them but he loved them. After watching them, my siblings and I would be scared of going to bed. Till today, I still enjoy watching horror movies because I think they are creative and they inspire me to write. Also, during Christmas periods, he used to take us out to eateries, buy us clothes and so much more.\n\nWhat kind of movies does he enjoy watching?\n\nHe likes watching African and American movies, basically any movie with a good storyline, but he loves watching Indian movies.\n\nWhere does he see himself in the next five years?\n\nHe hopes to be greater and to have moved to a higher level.\n\nWho does he look up to in the movie industry?\n\nI think he has many role models, but I don’t know their names. Outside the movie industry, I can say that he looks up to God a lot whenever he wants to make a movie. He doesn’t joke with his prayer time. He usually says that there is little a man can do to excel and that success is from God.\n\nHow does he get his inspiration?\n\nHe gets his inspiration majorly from God. He also uses personal encounters to write storylines, especially if it is an emotional experience. He also uses realistic, touchy scenarios that happen in our society to write his storylines. For example, one of his movies titled Good Bye Tomorrow was about a lady who contacted HIV/AIDS and died. It was a touchy movie, the movie also focused on prostitution and other factors that endanger the lives of ladies. Those are the types of issues he likes to turn into movies. He feels they would project the meaning to the society because they are experiences we live with.\n\nWhat does he say about piracy?\n\nHe is totally against piracy; he thinks the problem has negatively affected the industry. Most times, so much money goes into the production of these movies, it is so heart-breaking when one sees their movies being sold on the streets. He wishes the problem can be totally eradicated for good.\n\nDoes he have plans to open a movie academy?\n\nHe already has one running in Delta State, it is called Faba. There, he trains upcoming movie producers.\n\nWe are in the era of politics, what does he say about Nigeria and her future?\n\nHe only wishes that Nigeria’s forthcoming president would come into power to serve the people and not his interests. He says Nigeria is a good nation with great potential and that one of the things stopping us from exceling is corruption.\n\nWhat does your father say about the current Nollywood industry?\n\nHe admires what is going on in the industry. He says our movies have taken a new turn for the better. He always celebrates upcoming movie producers. At the same time, he constantly criticises movies that have no substance; he says those who are destroying the industry are doing a good job too. He said nowadays, a good number of our movies shouldn’t be aired because they have no storylines.\n\nWhat does his schedule look like?\n\nHe usually wakes up quite early to pray, and then if he has no early morning appointment, he goes out for a quick jog. When he returns home he takes his bath and breakfast. But days when he has an early morning appointment, he leaves the house quite early. My father doesn’t like arriving late to meetings. He often comes back home around 8 or 9 pm. On the days he doesn’t have to go out, he enjoys spending time with his wife.\n\nHow does he behave when he is producing a movie?\n\nMy father is a really serious person and he always wants the best. He makes his casts rehearse their roles several times even if they got it right the first time. On occasions when I join him, I get a bit upset. I’ll be like ‘but dad this is good’ and he would say, ‘no, it can be better’. He is a perfectionist. At the same time, he creates a relaxed atmosphere for his casts. He laughs with them and cracks jokes with them.\n\nIf he were not into movies what do you think he would be doing?\n\nHe loves singing and dancing, he is an entertainer. Whenever we have functions, he is the most jovial. I think he would have done something in that line (smiles).\n\nWhat does he do when he wakes and before he sleeps?\n\nI guess the first thing he does is pray. I’ve seen him several times praying quite early in the morning. And the last thing he does is before going to bed is also pray.\n\nDoes he read what people write about him in the paper?\n\nYes he does, he buys the newspapers every day. Apart from reading what was written about him, he likes to know the latest news in the industry.\n\nDoes he get upset when something bad is written about him?\n\nMy father is very good at handling criticisms; he doesn’t let things affect his emotions. He takes what he wants to hear, what will be of benefit to him and discards the rest.\n\nWhat has been his lowest moment?\n\nHis lowest moments are when he has misunderstandings with his wife, he doesn’t like it. I think that is the only thing that can weigh him down.\n\nDoes he advise you on the type of woman to marry?\n\nHe always does, he says I should be more focused on my career. He says no woman wants to marry a man who can’t provide for her. He also warns me against getting a lady pregnant before marriage. He always encourages me to make money before getting married, that way one will have respect.\n\nHow does he like to dress?\n\nMy father has a good sense of combination when it comes to clothes. Sometimes he likes to dress like a youth other times he likes to dress smart.\n\nHow does he handle female admirers?\n\nHe handles it just the way he is supposed to handle it. Being in the entertainment, he is bound to have female admirers but he knows where to draw the line. Once he is at home, he shuts off from work and focuses on his wife. She also understands the nature of his job.\n\nWhere does he see himself in future?\n\nHe hopes to go international, beyond the shores of Nigeria or even Africa.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

She talks about her father’s medical practice and life with MOTUNRAYO JOEL\n\nBriefly introduce yourself.\n\nMy name is Dolapo Famakinwa (nee Lambo). I am the last born of the Lambo family.\n\nWhere did you receive primary, secondary and tertiary education?\n\nI had my education in Ibadan, Ilorin, United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nHow was your childhood life?\n\nMy childhood was interesting, my siblings and I are blessed with great parents. They laid a very strong foundation for us and we have fond memories of our upbringing till date. Every day, I thank God that we are blessed with wonderful parents.\n\nDid your father visit you often while you were studying?\n\nI attended day schools, but my parents interacted with my school teachers. They also attended parent-teacher association meetings and they were well-informed of the school activities. They did the same for my siblings. My parents are exceptional. Their interest in our academic activities positively affected our grades.\n\nDid you follow in your father’s career footsteps?\n\nI would say yes and no for various reasons which I prefer not to talk about.\n\nWhat are the career choices of your siblings?\n\nMy siblings and I are all doing well in our various disciplines. We all have a vast combination of expertise and life experiences, which include Business/Accounting, Information Technology, Entrepreneurship and Public Health.\n\nDid your father impose any career choice on his children?\n\nNo, my father did not impose any career choice on us. He and my mother have always guided us with words of advice on our choices of career. I can proudly say that we (children) are doing excellently well because of their constant words of advice.\n\nDescribe your father’s personality at home?\n\nFor the most part, my father is quiet at home. He is a man of very few words. He is an introvert. He also writes and reads a lot.\n\nHow has his name opened doors for you?\n\nMy siblings and I are blessed to have him. He has a good name that people respect.\n\nHow do people react when they know you are his daughter?\n\nThey become more interested in me and they speak well of my father to me.\n\nWhat can you say about his childhood?\n\nIf not for the grace of God, we can do not know how he was able to overcome his life challenges from childhood. That is all I can say.\n\nWhat were the challenges he faced as a minister?\n\nMy father was the minister of health for a term. He served between 2003 and 2007 during the administration of Olusegun Obasanjo. During his tenure, we think the main challenges he faced were the lingering polio cases in the country and the deplorable state of hospitals in Nigeria. Others included managing the lack of cooperation amongst the health professionals and positioning the National Health Insurance Scheme on a firm footing for accelerated universal coverage within the shortest possible time after its launch. The other challenge was the fact that he was a technocrat, not a politician. As a minister, he worked relentlessly to ensure that his plans were clearly laid out and initiatives implemented to the best of his ability but he might not have scored 100 per cent in getting the full commitment of the civil servants who often pose as cogs in the wheel of progress. It is, however, on record and from different testimonials that there was relative peace among health professionals during his tenure.\n\nHow would you describe your parents’ marriage?\n\nTheir marriage is one I would describe as highly successful and blessed. Our parents have had an amazingly close relationship for over 44 years. Both of them have different love languages. They have had to make multiple sacrifices for each other, for the family and have remained happily married through it all. Their strong bond is a blessing to us the children.\n\nHow does he handle disagreements with your mother?\n\nLike any happily married couple, daddy handles disagreements with my mother by talking with her. He talks the issues through with her and they pray over them.\n\nDid your father advise you on the type of man to marry?\n\nMy father and mother advised each of us to be very prayerful and to decide our respective spouses based on the ‘why, ‘how’ and ‘what’ of the relationship.\n\nWho were the famous faces you saw at home while growing up?\n\nThe public faces that my siblings and I saw at home included the late Professor and Dr. (Mrs.) Adeoye Lambo; the late Professor Ransome-Kuti; and the late Chief (Mrs.) Stella Obasanjo among others.\n\nHow sociable is your father?\n\nMy father is very intentional about his social life and he is only social for specific purposes, including church activities. He does not drink alcohol and is not a smoker. He also does not attend social venues such as nightclubs, golf clubs, etc. He is quite reserved and enjoys his quiet life, watching the TV, especially news stations.\n\nWhat is his favourite food?\n\nMy father’s favorite food is Eba and to ensure that this is prepared well with no ‘lumps’, he prefers to make it himself!\n\nWhat is his favourite drink?\n\nMy father’s current favourite drink appears to be either prune juice for health benefits or water most of the time.\n\nHow is his temperament?\n\nMy father’s overall temperament is quiet, passive but watchful.\n\nWhat do you like about your father?\n\nI love my father dearly, he is a father indeed. Overall, my siblings and I love the leadership qualities that he exhibits. He is always excited about our achievements and easily pleased with our little gifts. To him, nothing is too small. He appreciates every little thing we do.\n\nWhat are the th"
