        "text": "The eagerly awaited “Town Hall Meeting” of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL) will hold today at the Marriot Hotel, GRA, Ikeja.\n\nThe hybrid summit has the theme, “Justiciability of Chapter 2 of the 1999 Constitution: Pragmatic Measures for Government’s Accountability.” Expected at the parley are judicial officers, political actors, legislators, lawyers and civil society leaders.\n\nWhile all slots for in-person attendance have been fully taken up in compliance with COVID-19 protocols, intending participants can still be a part of the summit by registering at https://tinyurl.com/nbaspidelth2022.\n\nFiery human rights activist, Mr. Femi Falana SAN is the Lead Presenter for First Plenary while Mr. Anthony Ojukwu SAN, Executive Secretary, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is the Lead Presenter for Second Plenary. The Chairman of the summit is Justice Helen Ogunwumiju of the Supreme Court.\n\nDiscussants for the First Plenary are Justice Onuoha Ogwe, Chief Judge of Abia State; Hon. Luke Onofiok, Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary; Mr. Suleiman Usman SAN, Sokoto State Attorney-General & Commissioner for Justice; Mr. Emmanuel Okorodudu, Head of Democracy and Good Governance Unit at the ECOWAS Commission, Abuja and Mr. Kolawole Oluwadare, Deputy Director, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP).\n\nThe discussants for Second Plenary include Mr. Olawale Fapohunda SAN, Ekiti State Attorney-General & Commissioner for Justice; Yemi Adamolekun, Executive Director, Enough is Enough (EiE); Ms. Cecilia Aransiola of Amnesty International; Mr. Samson Itodo of YIAGA Africa and Mr. Soji Apampa, Chief Executive at Integrity Organization. Both sessions will be moderated by ace broadcaster, Mr. Kayode Akintemi.\n\nWhile Justice Ogunwumiju will give the Chairman’s Opening Remarks, Welcome Remarks will be delivered by NBA President, Mr. Olumide Akpata; NBA-SPIDEL Chairman, Dr. Monday Ubani, and Chairman of the Planning Committee, Mr. Steve Abar. The Vote of Thanks will be delivered by NBA-SPIDEL Secretary, Dr. Princess Frank-Chukwuani.\n\nOrganised by NBA-SPIDEL, the sessions coordinator is Mr. Kunle Ajagbe. The sponsors include Babalakin & Co., Digital Rights Lawyers Initiative, Y. C. Maikyau & Co. and JB Daudu & Co.\n\nAccording to a statement by Dr. Monday Ubani, NBA-SPIDEL Chairman, “The aim of the Town Hall Meeting is to arouse the consciousness of critical institutions of government, particularly the Judiciary and Legislature, with a view to ensuring the enforcement of the basic socio-economic rights provided in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and other enabling laws for the benefit of the Nigerian people.\n\n“The Nigerian Bar Association Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL) is desirous to see Nigerians enjoy the basic socio-economic rights provided in the Nigerian Constitution as well as other enabling laws,” adding that NBA-SPIDEL has a vision to make public interest and development law a fundamental aspect of national life and development.\n\nAccording to the statement, SPIDEL which manifests NBA’s commitment to promoting the role and application of law to economic development and growth of public interest law in Nigeria, has been living up to its bidding.\n\nIn 2021, ahead of the sold-out NBA-SPIDEL yearly conference in Ibadan, Dr. Ubani had decried the delay in implementing provisions of the Constitution concerning autonomy of the judiciary.\n\n“We want a judiciary that doesn’t go behind begging the executive to give them their resources in order to carry out the basic responsibilities that the constitution has imposed on them. We want a judiciary that can deliver justice without fear or favour, its long-term effect is what we are looking at, not probably because of the short-term losses we are suffering but I tell you this, if we succeed in doing this, we would have actually sorted out a very big problem for us as a nation. The issue of administration of justice is very key,” he had said.\n\nCopyright 2022 CITY LAWYER. Please send emails to citylawyermag@gmail.com.

Despite his good old age of 85 at death, Omenife’s demise was still viewed as being too early and too soon because of his incredible and purposeful life of impact and the inexhaustible fountain of his goodness.\n\nThis brief tribute is therefore in honour of a man of many parts who throughout his earthly sojourn, as a fiery unionist, successful politician, boardroom titan and legal luminary engaged in active private practice for over 61 years, was a golden voice of the voiceless, implacable tormentor of oppressors and indefatigable defender of truth no matter whose ox is gored, and as an outstanding leader and fearless defender of the Igbo cause, at all levels, was never found wanting. Indeed, for this ubiquitous persona, to fully comb deep and exhibit all his sterling qualities and bundle of achievements is nothing but a tall order, if not a labyrinth in which it is easy to make an ingress but difficult to find one’s way out of the maze.\n\nHe was such an engaging communicator. Whenever he stood up to speak at any fora everybody listened with keen interest. In 2020, sixteen leaders of socio-cultural groups from the South and Middle Belt had dragged President Buhari to a Federal High Court in Abuja to challenge the marginalization of their regions in key appointment into the security, paramilitary and strategic agencies of government, in clear and wanton violation of the Federal Character principles, as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution, amongst other egregious abuse of office and powers, and asking for N50 Billion in compensation against the Federal government. I was drafted by the Otu alongside Mazi Unegbu to represent the Southeast in the case, an assignment that is close to my heart, and in which we are determined to deliver on our mandate.\n\nChief Ikokwu, a dogged fighter for equity and justice, was in the tick of the action, as the representative of the Southeast region in the case. I recall with deep nostalgia, Omenife’s many self sponsored trips to the FHC at Abuja, to attend the proceedings in the case, registered as E.K.Clark & 15 Ors Vs The President, Federal Republic of Nigeria & 4 Ors in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/595/2020. As aptly rendered in a tribute by Emeka Nwadioke, Esq, the Otu Oka-Iwu Head of Publicity, “ Even in his twilight, he was eagerly in the trenches, waging one battle after another” and I dare to say, with visible positive results.\n\nFor all mortal being, death is a necessary end. There is a time to be born and a time to die. High Chief Guy Ikokwu, Great Lawyer, Elder Statesman, Notable Ohaneze Ndigbo Chieftain, Fiery Activist, Past President of Otu Oka-iwu Law Society, etcetera, has finished his race and left his footprints on the sand of time. Omenife will be sorely missed. May God’s perpetual light shine upon him and may his gentle soul rest in peace. Let us all- his immediate family, relations, especially Ezezue Chuks Ikokwu, his beloved brother, Ndi Otu, etc, find solace in his exemplary life and indelible legacies and the hope of a joyous reunion on the resurrection morning.\n\nAdieu, Chief Guy Ikokwu, Omenife Oba. Ojeligbo Ozi. Kachifo\n\nChief Frank Agbedo, FIMC.\n\nChairman, Otu Oka-Iwu Public Interest Committee\n\nMore crisis has rocked the embattled Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee (LPDC), an organ of the Body of Benchers, as another ranking member, Chief Ferdinand Orbih SAN has resigned from the august body.\n\nIn a resignation letter obtained by CITY LAWYER, Orbih stated that “My resignation stems from the events that took place at the meeting of the Body of Benchers on the 22nd November 2021, wherein, the Honourable Body assumed jurisdiction over the Petition of Lucius E. Nwosu SAN. Lucius Nwosu SAN in his Petition complained about the finding of the LPDC that a prima facie case had been made against him.”\n\nCITY LAWYER recalls that the LPDC Chairman, Mr. Emmanuel Ukala SAN had sensationally resigned as Chairman of the LPDC, citing the same reason for his action.\n\nContinuing, Orbih, the fiery Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association Section on Legal Practice (NBA-SLP), said: “It is my humble view that by assuming jurisdiction over the said Petition, the Body of Benchers was in clear breach of Section 12 (7) of the Legal Practitioners Act, which provides that appeals in respect of decisions of the LPDC, can only be entertained by the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Clearly, that section did not vest on the Body of Benchers, the power to seat as an appellate body over decisions of the LPDC.”\n\nAccording to the respected senior lawyer, “The lawmaker gave the LPDC a great measure of independence because of the vital role it plays to ensure that the highest form of discipline is maintained amongst Legal Practitioners in Nigeria. That independence is obliterated when the Honourable Body brings the LPDC under its control and direction in clear violation of due process.”\n\n“In the above circumstances, my continued membership of the LPDC has become untenable, as I can no longer in good conscience serve in that committee.\n\n“I am therefore left with no other option, than to resign my membership of the LPDC. I am grateful to the Honourable Body of Benchers for the opportunity given to me, to be of service to the legal profession.”\n\nTitled “NOTICE OF RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF LEGAL PRACTITIONERS DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE” and addressed to the Secretary of the Body of Benchers, the letter was copied to the Chairman of the Body of Benchers, past Chairmen, Life Benchers and Honourable Benchers. Dated February 24, 2022 the resignation also became effective from yesterday.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this gale of resignations will affect the operations of the troubled Committee.\n\nCopyright 2022 CITY LAWYER.

Recall that Chief Gadzama, SAN was formerly admitted as a member of SLF last year after the Forum welcomed him with open arms.\n\nIt is important to state that SLF whose membership cuts across tribes and tongues in Nigeria was founded in 2006 by its pioneer Chairman, Hon. (Chief) V. U. K. Iyanam (former Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice, Akwa-Ibom State) and consists of legal practitioners who live and or practice within Surulere. SLF is one of the well-coordinated and organised lawyers’ fora in Nigeria and has been growing in leaps and bounds since its establishment.\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting, Chief Gadzama, SAN encouraged members to be united in the pursuit of the goals and objectives of SLF as the Forum can achieve a lot when in unity. He also implored them not to relent in playing their critical roles in the affairs of the Nigerian Bar Association both in Lagos State and at National level. The elder statesman was thereafter invited to coordinate the cutting of cake in celebration of members whose birthdays fall within the month of love.\n\nIn attendance with Chief J-K Gadzama, SAN was Mr. Mela Nunghe, SAN, Messrs John Unachukwu Austin Esq, former publicity Secretary of the NBA and Oluniyi Adediji Esq, Partner, J-K Gadzama LLP, Lagos Office.\n\nCopyright 2022 CITY LAWYER.

Upon receipt of the mandate I (in my capacity as the Chairman of the SLP) constituted the Legal team led by S. I. Ameh, SAN to commence the action.”\n\nOther members of the four-member legal team are Messrs Elisha Kurah SAN, Mba Ekpezu Ukweni SAN and immediate past NBA-SLP Chairman, Oluseun Abimbola SAN.\n\nOrbih told CITY LAWYER that “The Attorney-General of the Federation was on television to disclaim the controversial Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\n“However, we are aware that the RPC has been gazetted under his name. We have therefore informed the Honourable Attorney-General that a viva voce disclaimer of the RPC will not suffice in the circumstances.\n\n“The NBA Legal Committee has decided to engage the AGF and afford him an opportunity to issue a proper disclaimer through a written instrument published in the gazette. We expect this to be done by next week.\n\n“If at the end of the day this is not done, we will have no option than to carry out the mandate of the NBA to litigate the matter. Let me assure that this will not take long any more, as we have been on this matter for almost two years.”\n\nCopyright 2020 CITY LAWYER. Please send emails to citylawyermag@gmail.com.

Upon the intervention of the NBA-SARC with the Nigerian Police Force and through continued and sustained efforts, the petition was treated under the Police brutality cases. The petition by Yemi Abdulkareem’s family was found meritorious and the family was awarded the sum of 10 Million Naira by the EndSARS Lagos Judicial Panel.\n\n“The family of Yemi Abdulkareem who was awarded the damages has since sent a message extending their gratitude to the NBA-SARC for its timely assistance and intervention in the above matter.”\n\nThe statement noted that “The NBA – SARC has continually sought for the cooperation of everyone in its quest to achieve significant success in its mandate and has further reiterated that Legal Practitioners who have, or are being unjustly intimidated, harassed, humiliated, or subjected to unwarranted hardship in the course of their interaction with any security agency, are enjoined to report same to the Committee via the telephone numbers of the NBA – SARC members earlier provided.”\n\nIt recalled that the NBA-SARC, chaired by Joe-Kyari Gadzama, SAN was constituted by the NBA President, Mr. Olumide Akpata at the National Executive Council meeting of Thursday, December 16, 2021 and inaugurated on Friday, January 7, 2022.\n\nAccording to the statement: “Since then, the NBA-SARC is not resting on its oars, having continued in its relentless efforts at providing succour to legal practitioners who had been, or are being, harassed, detained and/or intimidated by security agencies across the country, especially in the course of the discharge of their professional duties to clients.\n\n“It is worthy of note, that the Gadzama-led NBA – SARC, presently comprised of legal practitioners who have solid background in relations with security agencies; and/or relevant network in interfacing with security agencies across the country has left no stone unturned in its commitment to achieving its mandates.”\n\nCopyright 2022 CITY LAWYER.

Expected at the parley are judicial officers, political actors, legislators, lawyers and civil society leaders.\n\nWhile leading human rights activist, Mr. Femi Falana SAN is the Lead Speaker, the discussants include Hon. Luke Onofiok, Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary; Mr. Anthony Ojukwu SAN, Executive Secretary, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC); Justice Kazeem Alogba, Chief Judge of Lagos State; Justice Onuoha Ogwe, Chief Judge of Abia State; Yemi Adamolekun, Executive Director, Enough is Enough (EiE), and Mr. Kolawole Oluwadare, Deputy Director, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP).\n\nAccording to a statement by Dr. Monday Ubani, NBA-SPIDEL Chairman, “The aim of the Town Hall Meeting is to arouse the consciousness of critical institutions of government, particularly the Judiciary and Legislature, with a view to ensuring the enforcement of the basic socio-economic rights provided in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and other enabling laws for the benefit of the Nigerian people.\n\n“The Nigerian Bar Association Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL) is desirous to see Nigerians enjoy the basic socio-economic rights provided in the Nigerian Constitution as well as other enabling laws,” adding that NBA-SPIDEL has a vision to make public interest and development law a fundamental aspect of national life and development.\n\nAccording to the statement, SPIDEL which manifests NBA’s commitment to promoting the role and application of law to economic development and growth of public interest law in Nigeria, has been living up to its bidding.\n\nIn 2021, ahead of the sold-out NBA-SPIDEL yearly conference in Ibadan, Dr. Ubani had decried the delay in implementing provisions of the Constitution concerning autonomy of the judiciary.\n\n“We want a judiciary that doesn’t go behind begging the executive to give them their resources in order to carry out the basic responsibilities that the constitution has imposed on them. We want a judiciary that can deliver justice without fear or favour, its long-term effect is what we are looking at, not probably because of the short-term losses we are suffering but I tell you this, if we succeed in doing this, we would have actually sorted out a very big problem for us as a nation. The issue of administration of justice is very key,” he had said.\n\nOrganised by NBA-SPIDEL with NBA President, Mr. Olumide Akpata as the Chief Host, physical attendance at the venue is limited to only 200 persons in line with COVID-19 protocols while other participants will attend virtually.\n\nTo register, click on https://tinyurl.com/nbaspidelth2022\n\nCopyright 2022 CITY LAWYER.

The procurement process was non-existent, as there was hardly any bidding for the contracts. There were no memos for expenditures. There were issues of conflict of interest in some of the contracts. There were no checks and balances. Can you imagine that N150 million was paid for the Bar Centre project without any EXCO meeting held to discuss the contract and on the ground only that it was approved by the Building Committee. Barely two weeks to the end of our tenure, another N50 million was paid on the excuse that the ‘payment is due.’ The Branch domain name renewal was effected every 6 months instead of the standard one-year renewal period. A last-minute hefty N150,000 was paid for HD presentation on the Bar Centre project.”\n\nSpeaking on the branch accounts for the year-ended May 31, 2021, its auditors, Messrs Olu Aladejebi & Co. (Chartered Accountants) wrote: “We observed that some memos that was (sic) raised/written were having the authorized persons’ on them but were not signed especially the ones for the (Bar Centre) construction.”\n\nIt also stated that “At the close of business as at May 31st 2021, the branch’s cash and cash equivalent stood at ₦220,420,065. This shows a decrease of ₦145,599,135 from last year’s figure, which is a 40% decrease over last year’s result of ₦366,019,200. This is as a result of on going construction work on Bar Centre building at Lekki.”\n\nBut another ranking Executive Committee member in the immediate past administration dismissed the probe as futile, saying that nothing would come out of it. He told CITY LAWYER that there were “no suspicious financial dealings” during their tenure, adding that payments on the Bar Centre were approved by the Building Committee chaired by Dr. Wale Babalakin SAN. He argued that it was not the role of the Executive Committee to oversight standing committees, adding that such committees had their terms of reference approved by the general meeting and also made periodic reports to the general meeting.\n\nHe dismissed alleged financial infractions relating to the website development and virtual meetings, stating that such matters were handled by the ICT Committee. He noted that all financial queries raised by members at general meetings were satisfactorily resolved, adding that while the new branch bus had “fixing” challenges, a committee was set up to resolve the debacle.\n\nOn the departure of then Legal Adviser, Mr. Harry Ukaejiofor from the Executive Committee WhatsApp platform, he argued that it was based on an attempt to “overreach himself” than a principled and persistent disagreement over the financial dealings and procedural safeguards.\n\nWhile the probe is being discussed in hushed tones among a few of the branch members who have become aware of the petition, the immediate past Branch Chairman, Mr. Yemi Akangbe is yet to speak on the matter.\n\nNBA LAGOS AGM ANNUAL REPORT\n\nCopyright 2022 CITY LAWYER.

This is the best assistance all of us stakeholders can render to the ECNBA in all sincerity.\n\n“I appreciate the ECNBA for their prompt reply which further confirms their awareness that stakeholders are watching every step they take as they proceed with the daunting task. I shall keep watching because vigilance is the price of liberty. I wish the ECNBA success.”\n\nCITY LAWYER had in an exclusive report unveiled ECNBA’s response to Ojo enquiry which many observers of NBA politics believe is targeted at the zoning of NBA offices. Some observers believe that a strict interpretation of the NBA Constitution may weed out some leading NBA presidential aspirants, leaving former NBA presidential candidate, Chief Joe-Kyari Gadzama SAN as the sole candidate.\n\nThe ECNBA has respected Bar Leader, Mr. Richard Akintunde SAN as Chairman. Other members are Ms. Mabel Ekeke (Secretary); former chairman of the board of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Prof. Chidi Odinkalu; former NBA Treasurer, Aisha Ado-Abdulahi and ICT expert, Mr. Basil Udotai.\n\nCopyright 2022 CITY LAWYER.

Find attached herewith as Annexure 3, the Resolutions passed at the 2021 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the NBA, held on the 28th day of October, 2021 at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium, Elekahia, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, which clearly shows that no resolution was made to repeal the Extant Constitution.”\n\nIn the letter titled “NOTICE OF OBJECTION TO REPEAL OF THE NIGERIAN BAR ASSOCIATION CONSTITUTION, 2015 (AS AMENDED IN 2019), Ojo argued that the NBA “duly adopted and passed the resolution to amend the Extant Constitution at the 2021 Annual General Meeting,” adding that “Contrary to the foregoing state of fact and resolutions of the AGM, it now appears that the NBA had inadvertently inserted the following into the proposed NBA Constitution 2021 which purports to now repeal the extant Constitution:\n\ni. Insertion of Sections 28 and 29 which purports to Repeal the Extant Constitution.\n\nii. Insertion of a Cover which reads: Nigeria Bar Association Constitution 2021.”\n\nThe Bar Leader stated that the process for the amendment of a Constitution “is entirely different, separate and distinct from the process for enacting a brand-new Constitution. As with the instant case, since no such notice was given to repeal the extant Constitution, the 2021 Annual General Meeting of the NBA could not have had the mandate or powers to repeal the extant NBA Constitution, especially since the AGM only had a notice to amend.”\n\nOjo said that the 2021 NBA AGM “has never purported to have repealed the 2015 Constitution, but merely amended same.” He added that “It is also trite that for the Extant Constitution to be repealed, there must be a 60 days’ Notice to such effect.”\n\nHe stated that “the crux of my objection, in precis, is on the grounds that the AGM only had notice to amend the Extant Constitution, and duly adopted and passed resolution to so amend. The present sections 28 and 29 of the proposed NBA Constitution 2021, seeks to outrightly repeal the Extant Constitution. To duly so repeal the Extant Constitution, there should have been 60 days’ notice to such effect in accordance with Section 20(1) of the Extant Constitution. This was however, not the case. Therefore, the 2021 AGM of the NBA held on the 28th day of October, 2021 at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium, Elekahia, Port Harcourt, Rivers State could not have duly adopted and passed any resolution (which it never claims to have passed) repealing the Extant Constitution.”\n\nHe prayed the CAC to reject the amendment as proposed, adding that he is “by this letter formally objecting to repeal the Extant Constitution as contained in sections 28 and 29 of the proposed NBA Constitution 2021, as same is not a true reflection of the resolutions reached at the AGM and notice to repeal, not having been circulated as mandated by the Extant Constitution.”\n\nHe urged the CAC to “uphold this objection” by refusing to register and approve the proposed “Nigerian Bar Association Constitution 2021” for failure to reflect amendments, for which proper notice had been given, duly approved and passed by the AGM.\n\nHe also urged the Commission to request the NBA to amend the cover of the proposed NBA Constitution 2021 to read as follows: “Nigerian Bar Association 2015 Constitution (as amended in 2021),” adding that that “is a true reflection of the resolution of the AGM.”\n\nOjo prayed the Commission to “further mandate the NBA to delete Sections 28 and 29 therein wrongly, unlawfully and illegally inserted into the proposed Nigerian Bar Association Constitution 2021” and “to resubmit a corrected version of its Constitution reflecting amendments, for which proper notice had been given, duly approved and passed by the AGM.”\n\nIn a “Forwarding letter” to the NBA President, Mr. Olumide Akpata also dated February 4, 2021 Ojo stated that the Public Notice “is an indication of your willingness to accommodate diverse views, comments and sincere commitment to due process.”\n\n“I greatly commend your open mindedness sir,” said Ojo, “and further to the said public notice, I now hereby forward herewith a copy of my Notice of Objection on the referenced subject to the Corporate Affairs Commission (“CAC”), as demanded in the said Public Notice.”\n\nIntimating Akpata of the kernel of his objection letter to CAC, Ojo said that it is “premised on the likelihood of innocent mistakes from the NBA National Secretariat, in the compilation of the proposed amendments to the Extant Constitution. I say so because I am well aware that the AGM only had notice to amend the Extant Constitution, and duly adopted and passed resolution to so amend. The present sections 28 and 29 of the proposed NBA Constitution 2021, seeks to outrightly repeal the Extant Constitution. Even the cover of the proposed amendment reads: Nigerian Bar Association Constitution 2021. Which further gives the semblance that the Extant Constitution has been repealed.”\n\nIt is recalled that Ojo had also petitioned the CAC against amendment of the 2015 NBA Constitution. In a petition with Ref No. CAC/IT/MIA/No.2365 dated 14 September, 2016, Ojo had argued that the 2015 Constitution (as amended), for which the endorsement of the CAC is being sought “belatedly,” did not amend or alter the subsisting 2001 NBA Constitution approved by the CAC.\n\nCITY LAWYER investigation shows that the amendment debacle may not be unconnected with the forthcoming NBA Election, especially as it affects provisions of the NBA Constitution on the zoning of offices. A frontline Bar Leader told CITY LAWYER that if the amendment sails through as currently proposed by the NBA, the zoning arrangement may start afresh instead of track back to the 2015 NBA Constitution (amended).\n\nThe citation for the proposed NBA Constitution reads: “This Constitution may be cited as the Nigerian Bar Association Constitution, 2021 and comes into effect this 28th day of October 2021 upon its adoption by the Annual General Meeting.”\n\nThe NBA leadership is yet to respond to Ojo’s objection at press time.\n\nCAC_LETTER_OJO\n\nCopyright 2022 CITY LAWYER.

To this end, I am writing to announce the constitution of the Technical Committee on Conference Planning (TCCP) for the 2022 NBA-AGC.” He added that the committee “is tasked with the responsibility of delivering a world class NBA-AGC in August 2022.”\n\nSave for his foray into NBA Lagos Branch affairs where, as a two-term Chairman, Erojikwe successfully led the Continuing Legal Education & Mentorship Committee (later Continuing Professional Development Committee) of the Branch, Erojikwe is not reckoned as your typical “Bar Man” of yore.\n\nAll that seemed to have changed especially with his role as the anchor for NBA President Olumide Akpata’s frenzied quest to lead the Bar. Erojikwe once described Akpata as a “Transformational Servant Leader and the number 1 Change Agent.” That Erojikwe and his team delivered on the task is in full public glare. CITY LAWYER investigation shows that Erojikwe has since become one of the President’s Men, a most trusted and valued aide and confidant.\n\nReckoned by many NBA watchers as the new-kid-on-the-block, Erojikwe’s performance since March 2021 as Chairman of the Governing Board of Institute of Continuing Legal Education (NBA-ICLE) has cemented his rising profile as a Bar Leader to watch. The revamped NBA-ICLE has under his leadership hosted several capacity building trainings for lawyers at zero cost, including the 16-Day Introductory Training on Energy Law and Policy For Lawyers; 8-Day Civil Litigation Training; Introduction to Intellectual Property Rights; Media and Technology Law Practice; Practical Insights into the Nigerian Tax System; Legal Aspects of Finance: Overview, Issues & Documentation, and more recently, another training on Entertainment Law (Entertainment Law Series: The media and entertainment ecosystem – A global legal perspective) delivered by a faculty from the United States law firm of Akin Gump Strauss and Feld.\n\nCITY LAWYER recalls that Erojikwe had, as Chairman of NBA Lagos Branch Continuing Professional Development Committee, anchored the NBA Section on Business Law (NBA/SBL) collaboration with the branch in setting up a Law Firm Mentorship Initiative. He was a member of NBA Lagos Branch Executive Committee and a member of the NBA National Executive Committee (NBA-NEC).\n\nAnd to think that his foray into NBA affairs essentially started with a request to help develop and implement a strategy for a new direction for NBA Lagos Branch then under the leadership of Mr. Chukwuka Ikwuazom, SAN as well as an invitation by Akpata to co-ordinate the Entertainment Law segment (tagged an ‘Evening with RMD’) of the 2016 NBA/ SBL Conference.\n\nErojikwe is a Partner in the fast rising law firm of The Law Crest (TLC). He heads the firm’s Finance and Energy Practice Group. He is admitted to practise in Nigeria and in England and Wales. He is reputed to have had “significant practice experience” in both jurisdictions.\n\nHis core areas of practice are energy and natural resources; corporate finance; project finance; public-private partnerships, and mergers and acquisitions. He has been involved in most of the firm’s energy and natural resources transactions. Recent transactions in this area include advising the borrower in a US$450 million financing in respect of a participating interest in an oil mining lease, and advising the acquirer in the acquisition of a major oil servicing company as part of an offshore takeover of the parent company. He currently leads the team advising the acquirer in a US$600 million debt restructuring and acquisition for a major oil and gas company in Nigeria.\n\nErojikwe has also done significant work in project finance and public private partnerships in Nigeria and worked on various ground breaking project finance and public private partnership initiatives when he worked as Legal Adviser to the London Borough of Barnet on Urban Regeneration Projects.\n\nA member of the Law Society of England and Wales, Erojikwe has, in the course of his career, facilitated training courses accredited by the Law Society of England and Wales which focus on infrastructure development and urban law.\n\nErojikwe obtained a bachelor’s degree in Law (LLB) from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and was admitted to the Nigerian Bar in 2000. He was also admitted as a solicitor of the senior courts of England and Wales in 2005. He holds a Master of Laws (LL. M.) degree in Corporate Finance Law from the University of Westminster. In 2020, Who is Who Legal (WWL) described him as an “excellent” lawyer who draws praise from his “wealth of experience” and “great understanding” of the energy sector.\n\nOther members of the TCCP are Ronke Adeyemi; Mustapha Imam; Olumide Babalola; Inemisit Dike (Secretary); Blessing Udofia-Poromon; Orji Uka; Ada Obinna Edozie; Rotimi Ogunyemi; Jonathan Agbo; Nta Ekpiken; and Omobayode Okelola\n\nEx-Officio members include Chief Ferdinand Orbih SAN, Chairman NBA- SLP; Mr. Ayuli Jemide, Chairman NBA – SBL; Dr. Monday Ubani, Chairman, NBA–SPIDEL; Prof. Oluyemisi Bamgbose SAN, Chairperson, NBA Women Forum, and Mr. Tobi Adebowale, Chairman, NBA Young Lawyers Forum.\n\nCopyright 2022 CITY LAWYER.

An indigene of Borno State, Hadiza is an alumna of the prestigious University of Maiduguri.\n\nMeanwhile, the chief unveiler, Sen. Kashim Shettima, while inviting Gadzama to launch some copies of the book, commended him for his humility and contributions.

IBRAHIM LAWAL, Head of Chamber, Olujinmi & Akeredolu, decries the squalid state of infrastructure at the Oyo State High Court of Justice, Ring Road, Ibadan and urges Governor Seyi Makinde to replicate the revamp of his private residence around Kolapo Isola Estate with the court premises\n\nThe Oyo State High Court of Justice, Ring Road, Ibadan, is the seat of the judiciary, the third arm of government. Apart from the fact that it hosts more than fifteen Court Rooms, the office of the Chief Judge of the State is there. The Judicial Service Commission, a body saddled with the responsibility of taking care of the appointment and welfare of judicial officers, has its office within the premises. It also houses the Probate Registry as well as the Court Registry.\n\nThis complex, arising from its centrality to the filing of judicial processes and the nature of the services it renders to the members of the public, attracts a constant stream of vehicular and human traffic. It is patently unjust for the Government to leave the whole complex in its present squalid circumstances. It has become urgent for the managers of administrative affairs in the State to address this deplorable situation.\n\nA new visitor to the Court premises may be compelled to believe that all is well, especially when he/she does not have any reason to move beyond the first Car Park. Any venture into the so called extension, the second car park, reveals putrescence. Nobody with a modicum of self-respect will attempt a revisit after the first experience. Cars, drivers, litigants and lawyers bear the unmistakable imprimatur of pervasive decadence, occasioned by perennial neglect. Construction site workers have better tales to tell. Visitors to the premises are most reluctant to repeat the unpleasant duty, if they are obliged to do so. Lawyers and litigants have sorry tales of embarrassing moments during their visits. The roads are simply impassable and messy. The Court Rooms need urgent attention. They are too hostile to the business of adjudication which requires deep intellection. They are repulsive to decency. It is unjust to have the courts in the erstwhile capital of the defunct Western Region, the most advanced in all ramifications, reduce to a huge joke.\n\nMay we appeal to the Executive arm of government to come to the aid of the judiciary as urgently as the current partisan consideration will permit. The current hardship can be mitigated by the Governor. He is a man of exquisite taste. The intervention of the State at his private residence around Kolapo Isola Estate is a pointer to the quality of job he can bring to existence. We will not be asking for too much if we demand that the Governor intervene to save the Judiciary from further mockery.\n\n* Ibrahim Lawal is the Head of Chamber, Olujinmi & Akeredolu.\n\nCopyright 2020 CITY LAWYER.
