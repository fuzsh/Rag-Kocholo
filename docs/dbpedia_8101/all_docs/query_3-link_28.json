        "text": "Aare Afe Babalola, SAN, is one of the most prominent investors in Nigeria’s education sector. I vividly recall Aare’s Emmanuel Chambers in Adamasingba, Ibadan, with relish. He was our Pro-Chancellor when I was a lecturer at the University of Lagos (UNILAG). In 2000, he was approached by the government to oversee reforms at UNILAG. At the time, he was the patron of Transparency International in Nigeria. This was an enormous request for someone who had twice declined ministerial positions. Aare agreed to the proposition. He promoted academic excellence at the University in addition to stabilizing the institution. While many Pro-Chancellors exploit their position for financial gain, Aare donated time and money to this University. I recall that he constructed a university auditorium. In addition, he did not receive any sitting fees for this assignment.\n\nThe Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD) was founded by Aare. The Afe Babalola University (ABUAD) has changed the face of education in this country and set a good precedent for other universities. Aare has been actively engaged in pubic discussion and scholarly discourse about education in Nigeria. He regularly writes, published or speaks about contemporary educational system-related issues. During the conflict between the Chairman of the governing council, Dr Wale Babalakin, SAN, and the Principal Officers of the University, which disrupted the University of Lagos (UNILAG), he was unequivocal in his position. He has written about school fees and public universities. He has argued that TETfund should finance private universities. Aare discussed the UNILAG policy that disqualified the 15-year-old with the highest 2019 UTME score. (UNILAG has a policy of not enrolling candidates younger than 16 years).\n\nAare Afe Babalola SAN donated £10 million to Kings College in 2023 to establish the Afe Babalola African Centre for Transnational Education. This fund is to establish a Centre that “will enable young Africans to access education and opportunities which they would otherwise not be able to have… The Centre will offer blended and online programmes, ensuring access to students who have had their journey to higher education disrupted by conflict, displacement, or other transitions. It will also offer post-graduate level modules which can be brought together to create professionally recognized qualifications from diplomas to Master’s degrees.”\n\nSome Nigerians have argued that Aare should have donated this money to a Nigerian university. However, I must respectfully disagree.\n\nAare has donated his time and resources to the education system in Nigeria. From Unilag to ABUAD, he has invested over 60 billion in education. As of 2011, he had given N476.8m as scholarships to brilliant students of ABUAD. His investment in the Afe Babalola Multi-system Hospital in Ado-Ekiti Ekiti State has been a significant game changer in the health sector. This hospital which also serves as a teaching hospital has achieved many notable feats. For example, the hospital had the first Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (EVAR) surgery in Nigeria and successfully conducted an open-heart surgery and kidney transplant. Aare Afe Babalola has donated to numerous organizations. For example, in 2011, he donated a building worth more than 100 million to the Nigerian Bar Association, Ado Ekiti Branch. He also contributed N100 million and 800 sacks of rice during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAare said, “My contribution to this Programme is a way of\n\nreciprocating what I benefitted from the laudable and unique External Degree\n\nProgramme of the University of London in the 1960s without which I certainly\n\nwould have ended up an unsung farmer or at best the Secretary of the Local\n\nMotor Union.” When the University of London pioneered global distance education in the nineteenth century; Aare Afe Babalola was one of these students. He studied from his home in Nigeria and graduated from the University of London with degrees in Economics and Law. Therefore, he is giving back to the institution that taught him life skills. We should always respect and honour people who can look back and support their former schools.\n\nWhile the Centre is in the UK; it will benefit African students. Professor Wendy Thomson, Vice-Chancellor of the University of London, said, “The partnership and resource made possible by this generous gift from Aare Babalola offers a timely opportunity for us to develop transnational education programmes for young Africans in collaboration with King’s College London and a network of African institutions that would not otherwise be possible.”\n\nDonating funds to a British university to benefit Africans makes a great deal of logic. Aare Afe Babalola’s donation will fund scholarships for gifted African students who would not otherwise have access to them. That is a benefit to Africans.\n\nEstablishing a centre in his name at his alma mater enables him to leave a lasting mark on his former institution. Our Universities will be better if every alumnus contributes in this way to their former schools\n\nAare has the right to donate to any organization he desires. It is his property, and he can utilize it as he sees fit.\n\nAare’s philanthropy is a benefit to humanity. Such individuals are a rare gem and a boon to society. I am pleased that he donated to an educational institution, even if it is in the UK. I honour this outstanding philanthropist, role model, and education advocate. I hope and pray that he continues to invest in education. Aare’s actions should not be discouraged but celebrated, extolled, and praised"
