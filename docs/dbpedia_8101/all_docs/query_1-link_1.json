        "text": "By Tayo Oyediji\n\nBillionaire Businessman, Wale Babalakin SAN, has scored many points, and without a doubt, ranks high among individuals who are accomplished in the legal, hospitality and construction sectors of the Nigerian economy.\n\nIn giving back to the society, he is known to have written his name in gold as his philanthropic gesture has proven to be without limits. In all his endeavours that cover legal duties and entrepreneurship, Wale Babalakin has been able to distinguish himself and proudly belongs to the class of the best.\n\nOne of his major business feats is the recent grand commissioning of the new Premium Departure Concierge by his company, Bi-Courtney Services Limited at the Murtala Mohammed Airport 2, Lagos.\n\nThe new lounge is part of Bi-Courtney Services Limited’s effort to redefine the experience of high networth individuals traveling through the facility. This milestone represents the unwavering commitment to providing unparalleled services and an unforgettable experience to the distinguished business class passengers and top-rate individuals who are on executive charter flights.\n\nWale Babalakin has proved beyond reasonable doubt that success is in his DNA. In the first place, he is an accomplished lawyer. Secondly, he is a successful businessman, who plays big in the hospitality and construction sector. And again, he is a big supporter of his Islamic faith. A worthy old student of the great school, Government College, Ibadan (GCI).\n\nDr. Wale Babalakin is the Chairman of Bi-Courtney Group of Companies. He is also a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), as well as a recipient of the Nigerian National Honour of Officer of the Federal Republic (OFR), which was bestowed on him in 2007.\n\nA chip of the old block, Babalakin is the illustrious son of the highly respected and distinguished jurist, late Justice Bola Babalakin, a former Justice of the Supreme Court. He is the founder of one of the most prestigious law firms in the country, Wale Babalakin and Co., where he retains the Principal Partner position. He might be a lawyer by training, but he is well known for his exploits as the brain behind some of the most popular construction firms in the country; Bi-Courtney Limited, Stabilini Visinoni Limited and Resort International Limited.\n\nWale Babalakin has an impressive list of business interests and achievements. After recording major successes in the development of real estate, including the proprietorship of a few high rise buildings in Abuja and Lagos, he, through his Company, Bi-Courtney Limited, applied for the concession of the Lagos Domestic Airport, the Murtala Mohammed Airport 2, after the airport was razed by fire. Nobody gave the project a chance as it was considered too cumbersome for the capacity of a private company. But he delivered. That’s the mettle he is made of.\n\nIn a country with an acknowledged huge infrastructure deficit, the company is a frontline player in Infrastructure Development and Maintenance, with a record of delivering the first major Private-Public Partnership (PPP) financed infrastructure in the Aviation Industry.\n\nWithin three years of the concession agreement however, and in the face of serious hostility and inconsistency on the part of the government, Bi-Courtney Limited completed the new domestic airport now famously known as MMA2, which has been variously described as the best airport in Nigeria today and definitely the first airport terminal to be built in Africa with private funds. It is acclaimed the most modern, functional and well-run domestic airport terminal in the sub-Sahara Africa.\n\nBi-Courtney was also the first company to win a concession agreement for the reconstruction and modernisation of Nigeria’s busiest and most important highway, the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, under a Design, Build, Operate and Transfer (DBOT) agreement.\n\nBabalakin also runs other numerous subsidiaries including Stabilini Visinoni Limited, Homan Engineering Limited, Bi-Courtney Highway Services Limited, Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited, Resort International Limited, Amalgamated Estates Limited and many others is run by Dr. Babalakin\n\nOne of his subsidiaries, Resort International Limited, is a hospitality and leisure company that is currently engaged in converting the former Federal Secretariat, Ikoyi in Lagos to luxury blocks of flats, and also the development of a 300- bed hotel at MMA2. Significantly, Babalakin’s Bi-Courtney Highways Limited won the bid for the reconstruction of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway before the Federal Government revoked the pact in November 2012.\n\nBorn in Ibadan over 60 years ago to the family of Justice Bolarinwa Oyegoke Babalakin (retired Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria) of Gbongan, Osun State and the late Mrs. Ramotu Ibironke Babalakin (who was a UK trained nurse and ran a very successful, but philanthropic medical home in Ibadan, where she was fondly referred to by all as ‘’Iya Alanu’’ interpreted as the merciful woman).\n\nBabalakin started as a young man with great intellect and potentials. His jurist father was the one who instilled discipline into him early in life and brought out the best in him. He eventually turned out an excellent young man from Government College Ibadan, had his A ’Levels at the Polytechnic Ibadan, and ended up at the University of Lagos, where he graduated top of his class in 1981.\n\nHe was subsequently called to the Nigerian Bar in 1982, and immediately proceeded to Corpus Christi College at the University of Cambridge for his LL.M and PhD as a Commonwealth Scholar. He completed his PhD in record time of three years. Babalakin inherited his intellectual prowess from his father, who himself had a double promotion twice at Oduduwa College, Ile-Ife, where he spent only four years for his secondary school education instead of six. Not surprising though, Babalakin has passed the same gene to his own children, who all graduated 1st Class/Summa Cum Laude from Ivy League Schools like University College London, University of Pennsylvania and Harvard. In equal measure or perhaps more, he inherited philanthropic nature from his mother. A true son of his father, he has ventured into diverse businesses and excelled in all.\n\nDr Babalakin started his legal career at chambers of the legendary Chief Frederick Rotimi Alade Williams, QC, SAN where he learnt directly at the feet of the late legal luminary and around the famous Black Table. Within a few years, Dr. Wale Babalakin set up his law firm, Babalakin & Co. which continues to wax strong over the last three decades as a foremost specialized multi-practice firm in Nigeria. Babalakin reached the top echelon of the legal profession and was preferred with the prestigious rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria in the year 2002. He has through Babalakin and Co., produced other SANs and legal icons in the persons of Messrs. Olawale Akoni, Chuka Agbu, Ms. Funke Aboyade, Mr. Tola Oshobi among others.\n\nHe is one of the very few senior lawyers in Nigeria who are seriously committed to building enduring institutions of legal practice.\n\nThough it has not all been a bed of roses for the prolific entrepreneur, but he has exemplified the proverbial cat with nine lives in all facets. He has severally been taken through the fiery furnace but like gold, came out brighter, never bowed to pressure.\n\nWhen he was called to the Nigerian Bar in 1982. That same year (1982), Wale Babalakin was one of only three Africans admitted into Corpus Christi College at Cambridge University for the pioneer Master of Laws Degree. Although his academic programme was sponsored by his father, he applied for the Commonwealth Scholarship. Wale Babalakin was awarded the LLM degree in 1983 and proceeded immediately with his doctoral programme. He received his PhD in 1986 on the eve of his 26th birthday.\n\nReturning to Nigeria in 1986, Dr. Babalakin joined the firm of his mentor, Chief Frederick Rotimi Williams, where he worked for one year. He established his own firm, Babalakin and Co. Apart from being a practitioner, he is also involved in the publishing of Law Reports. In 2009, the owners of Nigeria’s first privately published Law Report, Optimum Law Publishers, which commenced in 1964, assigned their rights and interest in the Law Report to Babalakin & Co.\n\nIn 2005, Dr. Wale Babalakin was appointed by the then President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, as a member of the National Political Reforms Conference where he served on the Legal Reforms Committee. He also served as the Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Sub Committee which was ultimately responsible for the drafting of the constitution. He was the Vice-Chairman of the Committee for the review of the Evidence Act. He also had the unique opportunity of serving as the Chairman of two committees of the Nigerian Bar Association, namely the Real Estate and Construction Law Committee of the Section on Business Law and the Government Practice Committee of the Section on Legal Practice. He was appointed alongside Alhaji Rilwanu Lukman as Honorary Advisers to the government of President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua.\n\nHe has served as: Pro-Chancellor and the Chairman of Council of the University of Maiduguri between 2009 and 2013. Chairman of the Committee of Pro-Chancellors of Federal Universities in Nigeria. Chairman of the Implementation Monitoring Committee of the Agreements entered into between the Federal Government of Nigeria and the various unions of the Nigerian Universities namely the Academic Staff Union of Universities in Nigeria (ASUU), SSANU, NAAT and NASU. Chairman of the Federal Government Committee to Re-negotiate the 2009 Agreement between Federal Government and the University Unions. Current Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council of the University of Lagos.\n\nHe is heavily into philanthropy. He donated an 80-bed hostel to the University of Ilorin in the name of his father, the Hon. Mr. Justice Bolarinwa Oyegoke Babalakin. He also donated an 80-bed hostel in Ibogun, Ogun State, and a 500-seater auditorium to the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic in memory of his mother, Mrs. Ramotu Ibironke Babalakin. He also sponsored the treatment of 1000 patients with various eye diseases in Aye Daade Local Government and another 4000 in Owo Local Government under the foundation set up in memory of his late mother. He has an elaborate scholarship scheme in and out of Nigeria with over 200 students in Nigeria and over 40 students abroad.\n\nDr. Babalakin is happily married to his best friend, Olugbolahan, a lawyer and the daughter of the Honourable Mr. Justice and Mrs. Y.A.O. Jinadu, and both are blessed with very lovely children.\n\nBy Eric Elezuo\n\nSome call him highly philosophical, some call him the entrepreneur with a difference while a lot of others refer to him as the czar of real estate. But one thing is certain, the splendid octogenarian, Aare Kola Oyefeso, the Aare Gbo Gbo Gbo of Remoland, is many things combined in one package.\n\nHis trajectory in the world of business, social impact and human relations culminated in the show of class that was exhibited at the prestigious Harbour Point Event Centre, where the who’s who in the industrialisation, real estate and general merchandise gathered to celebrate his entry into the world of the octogenarians. It was his 80th birthday.\n\nA writer of no mean repute, Aare Oyefeso was born on July 7, 1944, and has remained instrumental to the development of the nation and economic growth of various sectors, with special emphasised to his primary field of realtor.\n\nHe is the president of KOKTO Group and the Balogun of Ode Remo, in his native Ogun State, Aare Oyefeso is a social figure of note, who has held the presidential position of the influential Lagos County Club, leaving behind a trail of development, administrative stability and extreme welfare measures for members and sympathizers of the club. He is presently a member of the Board of Trustees of the Club, contributing quota after quota to its general wellbeing.\n\nHe has often and on been celebrated for a leadership characteristics that has been second to none as well as for unwavering dedication and commitment to building human and physical structures that can stand the test of time, and lending long helping hand in the area of philanthropy, generosity and excellence.\n\nApart from various work of philanthropy and helping in building the entrepreneurial fabrics of the Nigerian economy, Aare Oyefeso is an ardent writer, and is credited with many books, journals and articles including Unraveling the Puzzles of Earthly Life, which is in four parts, The Musing of a Quester, which he said is to “wake us to our chief mission in this world: to call a spade by its appropriate name by reminding us, we are not in the world to climb a social tree or to merely eat, drink, procreate, then die and be cremated, or lowered into the soil for all manners of maggots and insects to feast on our lifeless bodies.\n\n“In effect, this book would make sense only to those who are brazen, or dissatisfied with the shadow show of the labyrinth world,” he announced.\n\nOyefeso has dedicated his life to discussing the transient nature of life, and the need to prepare for whatever the afterlife holds.\n\nIn one of his writings, he stated that “First and foremost as a mystic, I must remind us of the inevitability of death. It is designed by the Creator Himself as a relief for the soul when our body has become enervated by disease, old age, accident or other mishaps that have made the soul conducive to inhabit the physical body any longer.\n\n“This happens when our allotted time is over in this world. The individual time varies and it is determined by the Creator Himself according to the karma and purpose that brought us into the world in the first instance.”\n\nLooking trim, smart and alert at 80, Aare Oyefeso was treated to love from all and sundry, and he confirmed his happiness amo g friends and well wishers with classic displays of dance steps, friendly banners and enjoyment of good food and beverages. It is worth noting that Aare Oyefeso is not in the habit of taking alcohol. In an interview he granted seven years, he noted that he quit alcohol over 27 years then, which in essence means he left some 34 years old.\n\nAare Oyefeso is married, and blessed with children, who are presentstanding on their own, and replicating a legacy of improved living, love for one another and dedication to the course of living a good and impactful life while still here on earth.\n\nFrom all of us, we wish the Balogun of Ode Remo a happy birthday, and many more years on planet earth.\n\nBy Eric Elezuo\n\nIt was a gathering of champions at the weekend when seasoned and accomplished journalist, administrator and politician, Aremo Olusegun Osoba, proved his networking and networth prowess.\n\nThe Convention Hall of the Eko Hotels and Suites was the venue, and it quickly became a beehive of activities with the calibre of celebrities, nobles and dignitaries that turned up in their numbers to honour a man, who many have described as a completely detribalised Nigerian. The event was the launch of his newest titles; My Life in the Public Eye, to commemorate his 85th Birthday. He was born on July 15, 1936.\n\nOsoba has been verily honoured in many quarters for his steadfastness in the field of journalism, humanity and public relations, and so it was not a surprise when the big wigs, the creme de la creme of the society turned from every corner of the earth to give honour to whom honour is due.\n\nOn the roll call of A-list attendees to the event are former President Olusegun Obasanjo, the Vice President of Nigeria, Senator Kashim Shettima; Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun; former Foreign Affairs Minister, Prince Bolaji Akinyemi; Chief Alex Duduyemi, former Delta State governor, Mr. James Ibori, former governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babatunde Fashola; Otunba Niyi Adebanjo, Ondo State governor, Mr. Lucky Aiyedatiwa, Senator Florence Ita-Giwa, Chairman, Ovation Media Group, Aare Dele Momodu, former Sec Gen of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku; CEO, Bison, Prince Bisi Olatilo; Oba Otudeko, Senator Uba Sani, Sir Kesington Adebutu, Olori Ladun Sijuade, Chief Sunny Kuku, Lady Maiden Ibru, Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, Senator Ope Bamidele, Chairman, ThisDay/Arise News, Chief Nduka Obaigbena; President, Dangote Industries Limited, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Erelu Abiola Dosunmu among a host of very many other important dignitaries.\n\nAccomplished pen-man, who attended Methodist Boys High School, it was not a coincidence that the event of the day fell exactly on the 60th anniversary of his foray into journalism.\n\nAt 85, Osoba’s strides speak volumes, and go before him. These as much were captured by all the speeches and remarks by notable individuals at the book presentation including Vice President Shettima, Fashola and Dapo Abiodun.\n\nIt could be recalled that during one his birthdays in the past, former Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida recognized him as detribalised, suave, urbane, cerebral, seasoned and profoundly accomplished.\n\n“Chief Segun Osoba remains one of Nigeria’s detribalised and essentially cosmopolitan octogenarians, suave, urbane, cerebral, seasoned and profoundly accomplished journalist who cut his professional teeth at a time when technology was still a huge challenge,” Babangida had written.\n\nWhile wishing Osoba the best, he noted that “your sun has just begun to shine. You remain to me as one of the most patriotic Nigerians I have come across in my sojourn in life”.\n\nNo doubt one of the finest journalists Nigeria has ever produced, Chief Olusegun Osoba, was the Editor and Managing Director of government-owned Daily Times Nigeria Ltd under Babangida’s regime. He had bitter experiences like his compatriots.\n\nOsoba revealed that Babangida sacked him three times while Abacha made attempts on his life three times due to his alignment with NADECO.\n\nOsoba said in parts, “I will call him by his name. Three times Babangida sacked me. Three times he re-instated me. At last, he converted my sack to resignation. Three times Abacha wanted to kill me. I was in hiding for one year,” he said.\n\nThat explained how dangerously he pursued his duties, and even at the risk of his own life, he never backed down. He is a believer in the truth, and as Governor Abiodun has described him in more than one forum, a role model to every lover of truth.\n\nIn his opening lines of an article titled Osoba’s Metamorphosis, in celebration of Osoba’s 80th birthday, Mr. Babatunde Jose, an ally and contemporary in journalism, said, “Having read Chief Olusegun Osoba’s book; Battlelines: Adventures in Journalism and Politics, and my personal life journey with the author, my take away from the book is that it is a story of an unending adventure with fate. A man whose resilience, hard work, perseverance and belief in himself and service to God and man has paved the path for a successful life in what we could describe as the cauldron called the Nigerian post-colonial state.\n\n“Born during the colonial era of the early constitutional development in Nigeria; precisely 1939, during the governor generalship of Sir Bernard Bourdillon 1935-1943 who laid the groundwork for the constitutional proposals which his successor Sir Arthur Richards (Lord Milverton) later submitted in 1944 and which became the Richard’s Constitution. He succeeded in convincing the Northern Emirs of the advisability of coming to join with the southerners in the Legislative Council of the country.”\n\nMr. Jose further added: “What we are witnessing today is a schism in the political class; a crack in the political pot and a return to primitivism, parochial and primordial tendencies. In all these however, Olusegun Osoba stands out as one political animal who has cut a distinct persona for himself and a different breed from the hubris of ‘come and chop’ political class; a collective of brigands and ruthless socio-economic barracudas, hell bent on robbing the national coffers of all that it contain.\n\n“His sojourn in journalism started during the time of his adopted uncle and godfather, late Alhaji Babatunde Jose. Being a good student of human philosophy, Osoba would imbibe the salient qualities of his mentor to rise and shine above his peers. Despite his apogee in journalism, he was not only cool headed but worked hard to maintain his comportment. This is attested to in the wide network of his associates, particularly in his youthful, clubbing and rascally days. He never lost focus and at the back of his mind was always the dictum: Remember the son of whom you are.\n\n“As it was in journalism, so had it been in politics. Having worked closely with the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, the man with a mission, Osoba had no choice but to pitch his tent with the progressive elements of Nigerian politics. It worked and has continued to work for him.\n\n“In all these however, one trait that has been discernible in Osoba’s personality is his contentment in life.”\n\nTo Dele Momodu, he is the grandfather of journalism.\n\n“He was as dynamic in politics as he had been in journalism. I was not very surprised by his conquests and giant strides. His suaveness and impeccability were such that his successes were assured in whatever he touched,”said Momodu.\n\nIt is with deep of respect that we raise a toast to grand Commander of Nigerian journalism as he clock 85years today.\n\nCongratulations sir!"
