        "text": "Imagine you are writing the biography of an enigma in the mould of Dr. Wale Babalakin, SAN, Chairman of Stabilini Visinoni Limited. Also, imagine you are producing the biopic of this intellectual who is the Chairman of Resort International Limited.\n\nCertainly, it will require a lot of effort to produce a compelling work on him, because only the deep can call to the deep, to paraphrase the words of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\nIf you are in doubt, take a cursory look at his resume: he graduated as one of the best three students from the Faculty of Law, University of Lagos, Akoka, at the age of 21; he was called to bar at the age of 22; he was one of the three Africans admitted into the Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University for the pioneer master’s degree in law, and bagged his Ph. D at 26! What can be more intimidating than this?\n\nLast Monday, July 1, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria turned 64. Expectedly, his admirers celebrated a man whose life story is a testament to perseverance, excellence, and unwavering commitment to philanthropy.\n\nDr. Babalakin’s journey from a young boy in Ibadan to a towering figure in law, business, and humanitarian efforts is inspiring. His educational path laid the foundation for his illustrious career.\n\nHis legal career is marked by his elevation to Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) in 2002 and receiving the national honour of Officer of the Federal Republic (OFR), in 2007. His legal acumen, and business prowess, established him as a formidable force in Nigeria’s professional landscape.\n\nDr. Babalakin is the Chairman of many companies and conglomerates that have given employment to hundreds of Nigerian youths. The companies include Stabilini Visinoni Limited, a leading construction firm, and Bi-Courtney Limit among others.\n\nHe took a significant risk establishing Bi-Courtney Limited, the company responsible for constructing the domestic terminal at Lagos Airport, now known as MMA2. Initially, the site was a dilapidated domestic terminal destroyed by fire in 2000. For over three years, the federal government was uncertain about how to proceed with the reconstruction.\n\nThe project that seemed to be a risky venture then, given the uncertain business environment in Nigeria and the complexities of using public funds, has since proven to be a successful model for the government. The project after completion has set a benchmark in Nigeria’s aviation industry. It meets all the standards for modern airport terminals and has consistently been recognised as the finest domestic and regional airport terminal in Nigeria.\n\nAt 64, Dr. Babalakin remains unwavering in his dedication to excellence; his profound impact on education, and compassionate philanthropy. His life’s work continues to inspire and uplift, leaving an indelible mark on Nigeria and beyond."
