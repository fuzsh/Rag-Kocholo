        "text": "Sowore Hails Success Of #EndBadGovernance Protests, Cites Three Waves Of Victories\n\nFormer presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) and the convener of the Take-It-Back movement, Omoyele Sowore, has commended the success of the 10-day #EndBadGovernance protests in Nigeria.\n\nDuring an X Space discussion titled \"#EndBadGovernance in Nigeria Protest: What Next?\" held on Saturday, Sowore highlighted the achievements of the protests, which he said were strategically planned and executed.\n\nThe convener of #RevolutionNow Movement explained that the first 10 days of the anti-bad governance protests were announced almost a month in advance, giving the movement ample time to gain momentum.\n\n\"The oppressed Nigerians succeeded before the protest, during the protest, and continue to succeed after the protest,\" he emphasized, noting that this marked three distinct waves of success.\n\n“Before the protest, we knew what we were doing despite concerns that the announcement might allow the government to sabotage it. As the saying goes, \"’Anything not properly planned is planned to fail,’ but we were prepared. We identified 15 different tactics used to try and sabotage the protests,” he said.\n\nSowore said in the South-South, they brought out former militant Asari Dokubo, who threatened that no protests would occur there.\n\nHe said, \"In Lagos and the Southwest, they distributed money street by street and threatened people with thugs. They even announced that all secret cult members had been relocated to Lagos.\n\n“In Abuja, they used heavy-handed tactics, but despite these threats, we prevailed.\n\nHe noted that the protests started strong on the first day, especially in Abuja. I must praise the participants in Abuja for their courage.”\n\nSowore said that despite initial skepticism, by the end of the day, the protests had spread, with thousands joining in Kano, Maiduguri, and other places.\n\nHe said by 4 pm, it was clear that the protests had gripped the entire nation. Those who thought it would fizzle out were surprised.\n\nHe said, \"On the second day, the military was drafted in to intimidate people. Our northern colleagues faced harassment in Sokoto and Kaduna, with arrests in Kano, but we managed to get them released in time for the protests.”\n\nHe said the army even threatened the media to prevent coverage, but this didn't discourage people. More cities, including Port Harcourt, Kano, and Yobe joined in full force. Abuja continued to erupt in different parts.\n\nAccording to Sowore, \"This was one of the most extensive protests we've seen in Nigeria in a long time, both in terms of geographic reach and the unity of the oppressed”.\n\n\"I want to keep thanking those who participated, especially those on TikTok who kept mobilizing people. Thanks also to those who protested in London, New York, and other places I haven't mentioned. In terms of reach, impact, and demography, this was a protest that spanned all generations,\" he said.\n\nHe said, in Lagos, for example, there was a judgment that restricted protests to Ojota, and in Abuja, to the MKO Abiola National Stadium.\n\n\"We see this all the time whenever there's a mass revolt—the ruling class often overreaches. One of the first casualties of these protests were those court orders. As soon as the protests began, people broke through any barriers,” he said.\n\nSowore added that in Lagos, the protests at Ojota were well attended, but there were also smaller groups in Alausa and other places. In Abuja, the court orders quickly became irrelevant.\n\nHe said a federal judge even refused to issue more orders because they were starting to sound ridiculous. Ogun State had an order, but protests still happened there, not confined to the designated areas.\n\n\"These court orders failed completely to prevent the protests. The intention was not to manage where people could exercise their rights but to prevent protests altogether,” he said.\n\nHe said that when the protests succeeded, even those at the designated areas like Ojota and the National Stadium were attacked by the police and Department of State Services.\n\nAccording to him, the judges didn't care about this, showing that these orders were not legitimate.\n\n\"As I've always said, if the law keeps breaking the people, the people will eventually break the law to free themselves,\" he added.\n\nListen to the recording here:\n\nx.com/timiblaze/stat…\n\nListen to the recording here:\n\nhttps://x.com/timiblaze/status/1824868164976488668?s=46Listen to the recording here:\n\nhttps://x.com/timiblaze/status/1824868164976488668?s=46\n\nIt’s been going on for years, maybe three, maybe more or less. Everybody expects the journey to culminate at the usual final bus stop. And true to peoples’ expectations it looks like the normal thing will definitely happen. The invitation cards are out, the wedding trousseau complete. She has made trips and trips to the fashion designers for fittings and more fittings. The cows have been paid for and a five-tiered cake ordered.\n\nHis people have chosen their own ‘aso-ebi’ and so have the bride-to-be’s friends and family. The reception take-away plates are ready and all members of the bridal train are set for rehearsal.\n\nThen comes the morning of the D-Day! The day breaks like any other day. Everybody is up at dawn, attending to the final details. Some are supervising the caterers, the bride’s brothers and uncles set up the canopies and arrange for the drinks to be iced. As early as eight o’ clock, the sun is out. The bride’s friends lay out her beautiful dress and accessories, arguing over the appropriate colour of lipstick she should wear. The make-up artist arrives with her million-naira make-up suitcases. The photographers have two cameras each hung around their necks.\n\nMore than an hour later, the bride steps out, into the gleaming white Mercedes Benz G-Wagon decorated for the occasion. It rolls out of her parents’ compound and heads for the church. She is leaving her home of over 28 years for the last time as a spinster. When she comes back, she’ll be wearing a wedding band that binds her to her heartthrob. Behind her veil, she smiles and heaves a sigh of relief.\n\nAt last, the search is over. She has a man to call her own now and is set to keep her marriage vows no matter the size or shade of thorns involved.\n\nSmiling for the cameras (both photo and video), the bride-to-be majestically walks into the church. She’s totally breathtaking as she should be. She looks around for her groom but was told he’s yet to appear. Well, and he was the one who repeatedly told her not to be late or else he’ll marry one of the choirgirls. It was a joke they’d both laughed at.\n\nThe time is already a quarter after 10 o’ clock – the appointed time for the ceremony to take off. Poor bride is trying to hide her fear. Her father gets up to inquire while the chief bridesmaid fans her friend. The officiating ministers too are getting impatient and complaining about the young men of today.\n\n11 o’ clock! The groom is yet to surface. Throwing convention to the winds, the bride lifts her veil and starts pacing up and down, her lips moving in prayer. God, where could he be? Maybe he has a huge hangover from yesterday’s bachelor’s eve party. Maybe their car broke down. God, don’t let him be ill. May be his suit or shirt got burnt when it was being ironed.\n\n11:30! The family and friends of the next couple who are getting married at noon begin to arrive. The emissary sent to the groom’s house returns, wearing a long sad face. He calls the bride’s father aside and tells him the bad news. The groom has left town under the pretext of going to gas up the car for the day’s activities. The old man’s face said it all. The bride slumped to the ground in all her sad glory.\n\nHalf the church erupts in tears in tears, cursing the groom. The end of a dream! There won’t be any marriage vows now. No till death do us part. Poor girl’s dream of living happily ever after with her prince is shattered – maybe forever. The wedding is off!\n\nIt’s a tear-inducing sad movie. It has happened to many women – may be more like it will still occur. Why do grooms bail out at the last minutes? Is it callousness or cowardice?\n\nIs it juju or mental problem? According to a friend and medical doctor, parents’ pressure sometimes causes this heart-breaking saga.\n\n“Some parents are high handed and overbearing, especially where they are rich. They are used to getting what they want and descend as low as using their own sons as pawns or business strategy.\n\nA friend of mine did the disappearing act a few years ago. His father wanted him to marry a business associate’s daughter – a kind of business merger. The marriage would have brought huge financial gains to my friend’s father but he already had a girl he wanted to marry. The girl he loved was in America and he too is an American citizen. When his father told him his plans, he protested. The old man started blackmailing him. Knowing he couldn’t win otherwise, Kay went on with the arrangement. He couldn’t tell the girl involved because she seemed to be in love with him and she would have messed up Kay’s carefully laid out plans . So, while his bachelor’s eve party was on, he took the midnight flight out to New York. It’s sad for the girl but what’s the point of living with a wife you don’t want, least of all love?\n\nBut many women think men who do it are callous. And I agree too. If a man has no intention of coming to say his own part of ‘I do’ then he should be brave enough to tell the girl instead of leading her on. Why let a girl order a bridal dress, cake and the lot when you have no intention of showing up on the wedding day? It’s pure meanness. A man who can do that is capable of killing. Some even go to the extent of abandoning a pregnant bride! Can you imagine the pain? Such men should have their necks tied to a moving ‘molue’ and dragged through the busiest road, so he can die slowly. No other punishment is good enough.\n\nAnd I can assure you that many women won’t let a man who abandons them on their wedding day go scot-free. I can’t imagine why any woman should feel anything but hatred for a man who humiliates her in such a way, in front of family and friends and even ex-boyfriends. Gosh, it’s the presence of ex-boyfriends at such scenes that is the worst. Imagine, the guy you’ve spurned and told off, having the last stupid laugh!\n\nOh, I’m sure the men will come up with different reasons why they do it. Let them. I can come up with a long list of horrible consequences of such reasons. A man who is not man enough to show up on his wedding day is an animal. He deserves nothing but painful, slow death. He should be made to pay bit by bit, until he begs for mercy. Even then, does he deserve mercy? What would you do to a man who abandons you on your wedding day?\n\nAs another August 12 quietly slipped by almost a week ago, it is worth asking: who remembered Sam Okwaraji? For most, the date holds no particular significance, but for Nigerian football enthusiasts, it marks a poignant moment in the nation’s sporting history, a day that should never be forgotten. On this date in 1989, Sam Okwaraji, a promising young footballer, collapsed on the pitch during a World Cup qualifier match against Angola at the National Stadium in Lagos and tragically lost his life. His untimely death left a void not just in Nigerian football but in the hearts of millions who had witnessed the rise of a true patriot and sportsman.\n\nSam Okwaraji was more than just a footballer; he was a symbol of dedication and selflessness. Born in Orlu, Imo State, on May 19, 1964, Okwaraji’s passion for football was evident from a young age. His talent on the pitch was matched by his intellect off it, Okwaraji was a law graduate, having earned his degree in Europe while simultaneously pursuing his football career. His commitment to the national team was unparalleled, often sacrificing his personal ambitions for the greater good of Nigerian football.\n\nOn that fateful day in August 1989, Okwaraji played his heart out for his country, just as he always did. With the Super Eagles locked in a fierce battle with Angola, Okwaraji collapsed in the 77th minute. Despite efforts to save him, he was pronounced dead shortly after, with reports indicating that he had suffered from congestive heart failure. The shocking news reverberated across Nigeria, plunging the nation into mourning. Okwaraji was only 25 years old, yet his legacy was already cemented.\n\nHowever, as the years have passed, it seems that the memory of Sam Okwaraji has begun to fade. Unlike other football legends who are celebrated annually, Okwaraji’s name is often overlooked, his contributions to Nigerian football slowly slipping into obscurity. There are no grand memorials, no national tributes, only a few die-hard fans and sports historians continue to honor his memory. The question remains: why has Nigeria forgotten Sam Okwaraji?\n\nPart of the answer lies in the nature of collective memory. In a country where political and economic challenges dominate the national discourse, the achievements and sacrifices of sportsmen and women often take a backseat. But Okwaraji’s story is one of resilience, patriotism, and an unwavering commitment to excellence, qualities that should be celebrated and emulated by future generations.\n\nIt is high time that Nigeria renews its commitment to preserving the memory of Sam Okwaraji. His name should be etched in the annals of Nigerian history alongside the greats who have shaped the nation’s identity. August 12 should not be just another day on the calendar; it should be a day of reflection, a day to honor a hero who gave his life for his country. The government, football authorities, and the public at large should come together to ensure that Okwaraji’s legacy lives on.\n\nPerhaps the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) could introduce an annual Sam Okwaraji memorial match, with proceeds going towards supporting young talents who embody his spirit. Schools could include lessons about his life and career in their curricula, teaching students about the values of dedication and patriotism. Media outlets could run features and documentaries that highlight his contributions to Nigerian football, ensuring that his story is told and retold for generations to come.\n\nIn remembering Sam Okwaraji, we are not just paying tribute to a fallen hero; we are also reaffirming our commitment to the ideals he stood for. As we move forward, let us ensure that August 12 becomes a day of national significance, a day when Nigerians of all ages come together to honor the legacy of a true patriot.\n\nAt this juncture, it is germane to opine that in a nation as culturally rich and historically significant as Nigeria, one might expect its heroes to be revered, their legacies celebrated, and their contributions etched permanently into the collective memory. Yet, time and again, Nigeria has shown a troubling tendency to forget those who have served and sacrificed for the country, leaving their stories to fade into obscurity.\n\nTake the case of Rashidi Yekini for instance, who was Nigeria’s all-time leading goal scorer and the man behind the country’s first-ever World Cup goal in 1994, is another example of this national amnesia. Despite his remarkable achievements on the international stage, Yekini’s later years were marked by illness and isolation. When he passed away in 2012, there was an outpouring of grief, but the promise to honor his legacy has largely gone unfulfilled. His death was a poignant reminder of how quickly Nigeria’s sports heroes are forgotten once they leave the spotlight.\n\nSo, as August 12 has come and gone, the question lingers: who remembered Sam Okwaraji? If the answer is not enough of us, then perhaps it is time we start.\n\nTHE President Bola Ahmed Tinubu administration likes to psychologically anesthetize Nigerians who are grieving from the hurt of its economic policies (petrol price spike, electricity tariff hike, devaluation of the naira, etc.) by saying Nigerians are only undergoing transitory pains in the service of a forthcoming permanent prosperity.\n\nI have repeatedly called this an intentional lie. I have done so from the benefit of my knowledge of the outcomes of such policies in other countries, including in Nigeria from 1986 to 1993 when Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida implemented a Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) as dictated by the World Bank and the IMF, which is similar to Tinubu’s “reforms.”\n\nI have also made recurrent references in the past to countries that have made progress precisely because they defied the economic template Tinubu is implementing now. I highlight the case of Malaysia in the late 1990s.\n\nLet’s start with SAP in Nigeria. In 1986, self-described military president Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida was persuaded by the IMF and the World Bank to “restructure and diversify” Nigeria’s economy.\n\nThe restructuring and diversification led to the removal of subsidies on petrol (all past regimes called petrol price spikes “subsidy removal”), devaluation of the naira (now it’s known by the fancy term “floating of the naira”), deregulation (that is, allowing market forces to regulate the economy while the government takes the back seat), privatization (i.e., selling off of Nigeria’s national patrimony to a few moneybags), etc.\n\nThe immediate aftereffect of this IMF-endorsed “restructuring” (Tinubu calls his “reform”) of the economy was a never-before-seen inflationary conflagration, which eroded the purchasing power of the average Nigerian. It produced widespread hardship similar to what Nigerians are going through at this moment.\n\nPetrol price spike and privatization led to job losses and a deepening of the unemployment crisis. Reduction in government spending, particularly on social services, led to declines in healthcare and education quality. Poverty rates also increased as a direct consequence of the removal of subsidies for fuel and basic services.\n\nI distinctly remember all the rhetorical maneuvers that officials of the IBB regime used to fray nerves, and they are awfully similar to what honchos of the Tinubu regime now use: it will get worse before it gets better, there is light at the end of the tunnel, there is no gain without pain, Nigeria simply can’t afford to fund subsidies, our economy would collapse if we don’t restructure the economy, the current system is unsustainable, we’ll all smile and appreciate the wisdom of this temporary sacrifice when the gains start coming, etc.\n\nBy 1993 when IBB left power, Nigeria became firmly secured in the economic toilet. Manufacturing collapsed, social unrest rose, and brain drain (which is now called “japa”) started and blossomed, and hopelessness was democratized.\n\nSomeone very close to IBB who nonetheless opposed his IMF-backed economic “restructuring” told me he asked one of IBB’s IMF/World Bank-appointed finance ministers a few years ago what happened to the “gains” they promised would replace the “pains” people underwent between 1986 and 1993?\n\nHe reported him as saying the gains didn’t materialize because the “restructuring” wasn’t implemented faithfully. Meanwhile, thousands of people died, and millions of people were destabilized because of this “restructuring.” I can bet that Tinubu and his defenders would give the same excuse when they dig Nigeria deeper into the depths of despair at the end of their “reforms.”\n\nIn a 1995 report titled “Structural Adjustment and the Spreading Crisis In Latin America,” we see the same scenario repeated throughout the developing countries of South and Central America. Everywhere subsidies were removed, currency devalued, and so-called market forces given a free reign, the result is always the same: devastation, poverty, hopelessness, death of the middle class, etc.\n\nThe report instructively noted: “Mexico is one of many cases worldwide where adjustment and the free market have not only failed to alleviate poverty, but have further polarized the country and led to disaster, economic and social. World Bank and IMF officials continued to say — right up to the current crisis — that adjustment’s attack on poverty would take time, but, after more than a dozen years of adjustment in Mexico, things have never been worse than they are today, and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There must be a point at which these institutions acknowledge that their strategy has failed and needs to be abandoned, and that a new, more democratically determined approach to the country’s development has to be taken.”\n\nBut it’s not inevitable that governments in developing countries should follow the IMF/World Bank’s ruinous prescriptions. Many countries with leaders who have guts and who care for the welfare of their people resist these institutions. And it often turns out that the only countries that are witnessing inclusive growth and development are countries that have chosen to depart from the hell-paved path created by the IMF and the World Bank.\n\nFor example, in 1997, when Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea faced economic headwinds and turned to the IMF and the World Bank for financial bailout, they were offered help with the usual conditionalities attached: budget cuts, subsidy removal, currency devaluation, etc.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed rejected the conditions. He said they would choke off economic growth, bankrupt companies, and cause massive unemployment in his country. So, he went counter to the counsel of the IMF. Instead of budget cuts, he increased government spending. Instead of currency devaluation, he defended the ringgit, Malaysia’s currency, by fixing it to the US dollar. Malaysia recovered from the economic crisis faster than its IMF-obedient neighbors.\n\nDuring “A Meeting of Minds” dialogue organized by Forbes magazine in 2009, the magazine’s chief executive officer and editor-in-chief, Steve Forbes, asked Mahathir how and why he bucked the IMF and did better than countries that slavishly obeyed it.\n\n“Fortunately, I am not a financier,” he said. “I know very little about economics, so I do things which are not quite off props. When people tell me that the right way to handle a crisis like that is to obey the IMF and the World Bank, I thought otherwise. I actually examined their prescriptions, and I found that those prescriptions would actually make matters worse, so I didn’t see why I should be following them.”\n\nI am glad Mahathir attributed his success in standing up to the IMF to his not being a financier and knowing “very little about economics.” It’s as if he was talking about Nigeria’s gaggle of slavish, brain-dead, self-impressed, IMF-controlled know-things who pass themselves off as “economic experts” and who have popularized the aggravating idiocy that subsidies are bad and must be removed because they are supposedly bad for the economy and don’t benefit the poor.\n\nNow we know the truth. We need more people who “know very little about economics” and a lot about commonsense to make economic decisions for Nigeria.\n\nThe questions people with lots of common sense and very little knowledge of “economics” should ask are, what does it profit a national economy if a government increases the cost of production for manufacturing companies through sharp spikes in the cost of petrol and electricity?\n\nWhat benefits does a country derive from a policy that causes mass pauperization, which ensures that everyday citizens can’t afford the basic things of life, not to talk of discretionary spending? Recession kicks in when people have no money to spend.\n\nHow does a country get light at the end of the tunnel when its policies trigger inflation and a once-in-a-generation cost-of-living crisis because it devalued its currency under the instruction of far-flung economic institutions notorious for instigating mass misery in developing countries and that are concerned more for “their loans, not on growth,” as Mahathir once put it? How can a country surrender its economic sovereignty to a foreign entity and tell its citizens to expect a bumper harvest in an undefined future?\n\nThe only benefit of the ongoing “economic reforms,” according to Tinubu and his officials, is that it is bringing in more money for the government. And what does the government do with the money? Fritter it away in frivolities while people starve and die.\n\nEven if the money will be used to build or renew infrastructure—we all know it won’t—if this is achieved at the expense of pauperizing the great majority of our people, it is still worthless.\n\nOnly people who are alive and healthy use infrastructure. The time to know very little economics and have lots of commonsense is now because the lofty “tomorrow” Tinubu’s IMF economic policies are promising will never come. It never came for countries that implemented similar policies.\n\nBarely 10 months after a court overturned $11 billion damages against Nigeria in the controversial Process & Industrial Developments (P&ID) deal, the federal government is facing another legal battle involving a Chinese firm, Zhongshan Fucheng Industrial Investment Co. Limited, which is seeking to enforce a $70 million arbitration award against Nigeria.\n\nBut does the federal government stand a chance of emerging as the victor in the current case?\n\nSeasoned analysts weighed the odds in what they described as a mismanaged deal in separate interviews with Weekend Trust on Friday.\n\nZhongshan recently got an order from a court in France to enforce the award following an aborted contract between the company and the Ogun State Government, which was initiated in 2007.\n\nThe order, which authorised the seizure of the three presidential jets under maintenance in France, has since been validated by a United States court, dismissing Nigeria’s sovereign immunity defence to the enforcement of the $70 million award.\n\nThe Ogun State government and Zhongshan have been at daggers drawn over the management of an export processing zone in the Gateway state.\n\nIn 2010, Zhongshan Fucheng, through its parent company, Zhuhai Zhongfu Industrial Group Co. Ltd, acquired rights to develop a free trade zone in Ogun State, Nigeria.\n\nIn 2011, Zhongshan established Zhongfu International Investment (NIG) FZE, to manage the project with the Ogun State government’s permission.\n\nIn July 2016, Zhongshan accused the Ogun State government of attempting to terminate its appointment and install a new manager for the free trade zone.\n\nZhongshan initiated an investment treaty arbitration against Nigeria under the bilateral investment treaty between China and Nigeria (China-Nigeria BIT).\n\nThe arbitrators ruled in favour of Zhongshan, awarding approximately $70 million in compensation. In January 2022, Zhongshan sought enforcement of the arbitration award.\n\nIn addition to the seizure of the presidential jets, a court of appeal in the US has authorised the Chinese company’s final charging orders over two residential properties owned by Nigeria.\n\nThe development worsens a crisis that the Nigerian government has been attempting to manage in Europe and prevent from spilling to other jurisdictions.\n\nNigeria had pleaded state immunity against the arbitration but was denied by a United Kingdom High Court judge, Sara Cockerill, who noted Nigeria’s abuse of the timeframe for appealing arbitral awards.\n\nIn the majority judgement issued by Patricia Millett and Julianna Childs, the US court held that the final arbitration award is enforceable under the New York convention since the dispute is between “persons” that share a legal commercial relationship.\n\nThe court ruled that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) arbitration exception stripped Nigeria of sovereign immunity in the arbitration award case.\n\nHowever, in the dissenting judgement, the third judge, Gregory Katsas, argued that when the New York convention was drafted, the word “persons” did not include a sovereign nation.\n\nKatsas held that the action of Ogun State cannot be attributed to Nigeria, adding that the arbitration award “arises solely out of Nigeria’s sovereign acts governed by public international law.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency had accused Zhongshan of attempting to take over Nigeria’s offshore assets through subterfuge.\n\n“The Presidency is aware of the various failed attempts by a Chinese company, Zhongshan Fucheng Industrial Investment Co. Limited, to take over offshore assets of the Federal Government of Nigeria through subterfuge.\n\n“The Federal Government is not under any contractual obligation with the company. The case in which Zhongshan is trying to use every unorthodox means to strip our offshore assets is between the company and the Ogun State Government,” a statement signed by the Special Adviser to the President on Information and Strategy, Mr. Bayo Onanuga, on Thursday read in part.\n\nAlso speaking on the development on Thursday, the Attorney-General of the Federation, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), said Nigeria has initiated both legal and diplomatic steps to ensure the release of three seized presidential aircraft in France and Switzerland.\n\nIn the statement by his spokesperson, Kamarudeen Ogundele, the Attorney-General said its efforts were grounded in the principle that the aircraft are sovereign assets, used exclusively for sovereign purposes, and therefore immune from attachment.\n\n“The Offices of the National Security Adviser and the Attorney-General of the Federation, have already set in motion both legal and diplomatic steps to ensure the discharge of the inappropriate orders against the aircrafts, which are covered by sovereign immunity,” it said.\n\nThe government also maintained that the interim orders against the aircraft were inappropriate, given their status under sovereign immunity.\n\nTrade zone dispute mismanaged – Lawyers\n\nSome lawyers have criticised the handling of the dispute with the Chinese firm that resulted in the confiscation of the country’s presidential aircraft.\n\nDayo Akinlaja (SAN) bemoaned Nigeria’s tendency to breach international agreements of this nature, urging the federal government to opt for a settlement.\n\nHe said, “If there is a dispute and one side has evinced a view for settlement, I think it is important to explore that option, irrespective of the court or arbitration panel that heard the matter.\n\n“The more reason we should opt for settlement is because they are producing what we cannot on that land mapped out for the FTZ.”\n\nIn his view, Nkem Okoro Esq, called for a thorough investigation and the prosecution of officials involved in the mishandling of the contract to show that the government of Nigeria is not complicit in the breach and to avoid soiling its image further.\n\n“The only honourable thing for the Nigerian government to do now is the payment of the sum awarded against it by the arbitration panel. At least this way, Nigeria can reassure would-be international investors of the safety of their investments in Nigeria.\n\n“Nigeria breached the agreement it had with the Chinese company; an arbitral award was made against Nigeria, and Nigeria has refused to do the most honourable thing: pay and atone for your shortcomings.\n\n“The seizure of Nigeria’s assets is a colossal and unmitigated embarrassment to the federation, already. To think that rather than paying, Nigeria will be looking for ways to defeat the award is also exacerbating the situation against the international image of Nigeria,” he said.\n\nHe said there is no doubt that Nigeria is a party in the dispute because free zones in Nigeria are managed, controlled, and administered by the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority, which is an agency of the federal government.\n\nA human rights lawyer, Nkereuwem Akpan, Esq, also called for a diplomatic approach to resolving the dispute.\n\nHe, however, cautioned that under international law, sovereign states enjoy sovereign immunity from execution, and as such, it would be improper for one state to seize the assets of another, which could lead to chaos if it leads to tit for tat.\n\nNigeria’s image, foreign investment drive at stake\n\nThe Zhongshan matter brings to mind earlier cases of P&ID arbitration ruling over Nigeria tardiness in a failed gas supply and processing contract.\n\nSimilarly, in 2019, an Irish engineering firm was awarded $9.6 billion in damages against Nigeria by a UK court over a failed gas project. The firm instructed lawyers to identify Nigerian assets worldwide that could be seized to enforce the record-breaking arbitration award.\n\nA former foreign Affairs Minister and professor of political science, Ambassador Bolaji Akinyemi, said there is a provision in international law which provides that where a nation is involved in commercial activities, its agency will not have diplomatic immunity—an exception to the general rule that states enjoy diplomatic immunity.\n\nHe said, “In this particular case, Ogun is not a sovereign state. It is Nigeria that is recognised, and so property belonging to Nigeria is now exposed to this exception to diplomatic immunity.\n\n“I don’t know who the lawyers of Ogun State were when this case came up; the last judgement we had was decided in the United States Court of Appeal. And the judges ruled by a vote of two to one that the Nigerian property does not enjoy diplomatic immunity. This is bad for our image and position internationally. It should never have been allowed to get to this stage.”\n\nCommenting on the development, Dakuku Adol Peterside, former Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), said the development raised fundamental issues worth interrogating.\n\nHe said, coming after the Dangote saga, this is one too many, and the global perception of our country is not good.\n\n“At the time we thought we are beginning to see some increase in foreign direct investment inflow, suddenly, the government is giving out false signals. We already have economic policy challenges; we have foreign exchange volatility and there is a general clout of negative perception about the strength and health of the Nigerian economy.\n\n“Right now, there are institutional weaknesses that investors are grappling with, including the fact that our judiciary doesn’t give people a lot of confidence. Added to all these challenges is the Nigeria-Ogun-Chinese company crisis. There is no way it will not significantly impact investors’ confidence.\n\n“It (the confidence) will weaken, and this is not good for us. Government needs to understand the place of signalling. Perception means a lot to investment. Investment will not go to where it is not safe,” he stated.\n\nPeterside contended that the case reeked of the untidiness that has characterised Nigeria’s international contracts.\n\nHe said states and even private companies had found ways of roping in the federal government into their untidy deals.\n\n“In the process, our national reputation has even further cheapened,” he added.\n\nOptions available for FG\n\nProf. Akinyemi urged the federal government to warn all state governors about cancelling contracts signed by their predecessors, whether the agreements involved foreign or domestic companies.\n\n“To me, it is arrogance of power on the part of the Ogun State government. Governors come in and just decide to do anything. They have ruined a lot of domestic companies whose contracts have been cancelled like that,” he added.\n\nProf. Akinyemi, who is the chairman of the National Think Tank, also admonished the federal government to approach the Chinese government and Chinese companies doing business in Nigeria.\n\n“The Chinese government should call the Chinese company and put pressure on it to settle out of court with Nigeria. That is the important proposal, so that Chinese interest in Nigeria will not be adversely affected by what is going on,” the diplomat said.\n\nOn the way forward, Peterside said Nigeria could not continue to be seen as a country whose transactions are opaque and not respectful of contracts, saying these perceptions could deter foreign investors from having anything to do with the country.\n\nPeterside, who is also a former House of Representatives member, advised that the office of the Attorney General of the federation should take a closer look at international contracts entered into by states to insulate sovereign assets from culpability.\n\nNigeria has a strong case\n\n–Agbakoba\n\nHowever, a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olisa Agbakoba (SAN), has insisted that Nigeria has a strong defence on two grounds.\n\nHe said in international law, there is a compelling reason to argue that attachment of property belonging to a sovereign state such as Nigeria is free from attachment under an order of court.\n\n“In this case, evidence that the aircraft are owned by Nigeria and are strictly used for diplomatic purposes, is in my view a good ground for Nigeria to successfully recover the aircraft from attachment.\n\n“The second strong reason would be that the attachment of the aircraft is said to be in respect of a debt owed by Ogun State, which is a wholly different political entity from the sovereign state of Nigeria. The attached aircraft would, in those circumstances, be unjustified and I think it is reasonable to presume that Nigeria has a very good chance of success,” he stated.\n\nChinese firm mulls negotiations, releases seized jet\n\nMeanwhile, Zhongshan has said it is open to negotiations with the Nigerian government over the matter. The company was quoted in a statement reported by Premium Times on Thursday that it only sought to assert its rights under international law and was confident in its case.\n\n“Zhongshan has for a long time been ready to enter serious negotiations with the federal government of Nigeria to settle this case and still awaits an indication that the government is equally willing,” the statement said.\n\nOn Friday, the Online Newspaper quoted a Zhongshan spokesperson as saying that the company had released one of the confiscated aircraft.\n\n“Zhongshan has consistently sought to act reasonably and fairly in the course of a legal dispute with Nigeria which was not of its making.\n\n“It (Zhongshan) has now been made aware that an Airbus A330, currently detained in France as a result of a French court order obtained by Zhongshan, is needed for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to travel to a scheduled meeting with President Macron of France early next week.\n\n“As a gesture of goodwill, Zhongshan has lifted the seizure of that aircraft immediately. This will allow it to be used for the President’s trip.\n\n“Zhongshan remains committed to talks with representatives of the Federal Government of Nigeria, this time serious and substantive on both sides, with a view to reaching a reasonable compromise settlement rapidly,” the official said.\n\n[DailyTrust]"
