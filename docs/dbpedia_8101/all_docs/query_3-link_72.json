        "text": "Owu people (Orile-Owu or Owu-Ipole) are agriculturalist, ancient warriors and Yoruboid-speaking people that forms a sub-set of the larger Yoruba ethnic group of West Africa, particularly Nigeria. Owu people are particularly residents of Abeokuta in Ogun state.\n\nHistorically, Owu region in the Federal Republic of Nigeria is bounded in the south by Ijebu-Igbo in Ogun State; in the east by Ife South Local Government Area; in the north by Gbongan – one of the prominent towns in Osun State and in the west by Irewole/Isokan Local Government Area. Ago-Owu in Abeokuta is where the Owus are mostly concentrated, however large Owu settlements are found throughout the Yoruba kingdom. The Yoruba kingdom extends beyond the boundaries of Nigeria into the Republic of Benin.\n\nOrile-Owu in the past was an ancient forest kingdom which is believed to be the first settlement outside Ile-Ife, the popularly acclaimed traditional homeland of the Yoruba people. Several notions about this ancient kingdom regarding its status as the cradle of all other Owu communities have led to some generated heated controversies.\n\nAmong the various Yoruba sub-ethnic groups such as Oyo, Egba, Ife, Ijebu, Ijesha, Awori, Remo, Igbomina, Ondo, Ekiti and others, Owu people are very popular especially when one count the war years of the larger Oyo Kingdom. Within the said region of old Oyo, Owu was very prominent and even ruled the waves. Owu collected tribute from the Bariba, the Borgu and had ruled over old Oyo until the reign of Sango. All this happened because they (Owu) also settled within that very region. (See Johnson’s “History of the Yorubas” p.149). Their presence in that region was indisputably powerful. Owu fought side by side with Egba in the Makun and other wars against Ado Odo and Dahomey in 1842-45. Owu contingents fought and routed Awori at Itori, Yobo, Ifo, Atan, Ota and also occupied those places till today. In his address to Owu people during the 8th Owu Day celebrations in 2007, the Olowu, Oba Adegboyega Dosunmu maintained that \"Owu people had fought wars, won battles and settled in very many places between the Niger river and the sea (Owus in Lagos State; Epe, etc.), yet their main stream had settled among the Egbas in Abeokuta BUT, THEY ARE NOT EGBAS, neither are they lJEBUS. (See Johnson’s “History of the Yorubas, p.18). Owu settlements in Ijebu and Abeokuta were not as a result of direct battles or victory over them, but mostly on friendly terms.\"\n\nOne of the distinctive socio-political difference between Owus and other Yoruba sub-tribes is that the Owus do not have an Oluwo (Ogboni Head Chief) and do not hold Ogboni assemblies. On the contrary, the Owu palace has its own culture of open deliberation where any Owu person can participate. That is why people refer to the Owus as “Owu a gbooro gbimo” meaning \"Owu the deliberative group\".\n\nOwu settlements are found throughout the Yoruba Kingdom, all of which have historical and cultural affinity to the homeland – that is Orile-Owu. In the Yoruba language, “Orile” means an ancestral home or settlement while the word “Owu” is derived from a cotton plant belonging to the genus Gossypium. This plant is called owu by the Yoruba. Therefore, “Orile-Owu” means the original settlement or site of the Owu people. The early settlers of this kingdom planted and traded in cotton. Hence, this place was called “Igbo Owu” i.e Cotton Forest.\n\nMathew Arema Okikiola Olusegun Obasanjo, Owu tribe man and Retired Army General who hails from the Olusanmi compound in Sokori, Owu Abeokuta is the only 3 term and longest in office Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He revamped the Owu National Movement now called RUOP which was originally founded by Balogun Akin Olugbade, his predecessor in the office of Balogun Owu Abeokuta. A one time leader of the Eminent Personalities group and contender for the post of Secretary General of the United Nations. He is the current Balogun Owu.\n\nThere are a lot of abandoned historical and cultural heritage resources in Orile-Owu. This attests to the heritage of the Owu people as a great kingdom in the past. Moreover, for several years that the ancient town has been in existence, settlement features such as ditches and embankments, refuse mounds, historic buildings, and pottery scatters within the ancient town (site) are yet to be fully understood especially within the context of how they reflect the antiquity of the settlement on one hand, and how they stand a good chance to investigating the connection between the homeland and outlier Owu settlements in the Yoruba region, on the other hand.\n\nOwu people of Abeokuta\n\nGeography and Climate\n\nOwu is within latitude 7°10’ and 7°15’N and longitude 4°25’E. This region is bounded in the south by Ijebu-Igbo in Ogun State; in the east by Ife South Local Government Area; in the north by Gbongan – one of the prominent towns in Osun State and in the west by Irewole/Isokan Local Government Area. The study area is situated in the tropics, where the sun is overhead almost every day of the year. The annual temperature is about 28°C. Rainfall is heavy, averaging 1300mm per annum reaching its peak between April and late September. Orile-Owu is sunny throughout the year. The relative humidity coincides with months with low rainfall – December to March (Adejobi 1997; Adejuwon 1974, Ogundele and Ebonine, 2010).In terms of accessibility, Orile-Owu is about 46km from Ibadan. There is a well- tarred motorable road from Ibadan to Orile-Owu and within the town are short footpaths, which make Orile-Owu very accessible.\n\nAbeokuta\n\nThe vegetation type in this area is a secondary forest. The vegetation has been greatly impacted by increase in human population and activities. Orile-Owu was an ancient forest kingdom with varieties of plant species. The predominant plants that exist in this locality comprise of tree species such as oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), iroko (Milicia excela), mahogany (Entadrophragma cylindricum), arere (Triplocyton scleroxylon), and teak (Tectona grandis). The area is well drained by rivers and streams including the Obalufon, Omu, Ope, Oranran, Osun and Shasha rivers. The availability of these rivers and streams has some positive impact on local agriculture and other livelihood including palm oil production (Ogundele and Ebonine, 2010). The soil is fertile thereby allowing the cultivation of various cash and subsistence crops. The availability of the essential natural resource at the site made it a suitable place for the ancient population to settle.\n\nChief Gbenga Daniel, Ota tribe man and Former Governor of Ogun State and Aare Ajibosin of Owu Kingdom with his wife. His mother was Owu from Omu Ijebu.\n\nLanguage\n\nOwu people speak North-West Yoruba (NWY) dialect of Yoruboid languages which belongs to the larger Niger-Congo language phylum. Apart from Owu people, the other areas that speak North-West Yoruba dialects include Abẹokuta, Ibadan, Ọyọ, Ogun and Lagos (Eko) areas.\n\nOgogo kulodo masquerade from Ota Awori in Ogun State\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to written sources, the establishment or founding of Owu Ipole (as Orile-Owu was formerly referred to) was shortly after the settlement of Oduduwa in Ile – Ife, therefore they said “Owu Lakoda” meaning Owu was the first to be founded after Ile – Ife is a popular saying among the Yoruba (Mabogunje,1997). It is believed from oral tradition that the Owu occupied an area directly along and below Niger River in the present country of Nigeria. Orile-Owu later expanded and became a very popular and powerful Yoruba settlement, which eventually attained the status of a kingdom of great repute. It became a force to be reckoned with within Yoruba land, particularly between the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nBy the second decade of the 19th century, Orile-Owu began to wane down as a result of food shortage, war, and consequently, insecurity of lives and properties resulting from slave raiding. Thus the settlers had to go in search of better economic opportunities, as this was important in ensuring their survival. The Owus therefore abandoned their heavily fortified city and escaped southwest in groups for safety in the face of heavy external aggression (Chief Olalere per comm., 2011).The destruction of the heavily fortified city was caused by the late 19th century intra-sub-ethnic wars. This destruction had its consequences on the people and it is believed to be the reason behind their wide dispersal all over the country. Owu settlements are found today in most Yoruba communities including Abeokuta and Lagos, and as far afield as Igbomina land in Kwara State of Nigeria. The collapse of Old Oyo (in the northern part of Yoruba land), a powerful capital of the Oyo empire in the early 19th century, coupled with the final sack of Orile-Owu in 1825 was instrumental to the demographic changes in southern Yoruba land (Ogundele and Babalola, 2007:60; Ogundele and Ebonine: 2010).\n\nPa Taiwo Michael Akinkunmi, Owu tribe man and designer of Nigeria`s National Flag\n\nIjebu and Ife war against Owu\n\nIn 1821–26, the armies of both Ijebu and the Ife attacked and devastated Owu Ipole. The Owus abandoned their heavily fortified city and escaped southwestward in groups toward Ibadan in about 1826. From these outskirts, they marched on and across Ogun River and finally arrived at Oke Ata near Abeokuta where Sodeke, an Egba authoritative leader, persuaded the gallant Owus to settle in Abeokuta about 1834. It is important to state that the present Orile Owu is the same place as Owu Ipole where the Owus from Iwo and other places resettled in the early 20th century. The people of Erunmu (founded by the older brother of an earlier Olowu from the Amororo Ruling House) were always loyal to the course of Owu Kingdom. During the Owu war, the Olowu was carried on his back (to disguise his escape) from Orile Owu (Owu Ipole) to Orile Erunmu, guarded by a combined team of his royal guards and Oba Erunmu's royal guards. After Orile Owu was devastated, the remaining Owu army retreated to defend Orile Erunmu against the allied army of Ijebu and Ife.\n\nOta and Ado-Odo\n\nOwu was a major factor in the 1842-45 war against Ota and Ado Odo. It is interesting to note that halfway through the war, Sodeke devised a way for the Egba contingent led by Ayikondu to desert the warfront (see Ajisafe, Iwe Itan Abeokuta, p.73), employing the services of his friend (the enemy), Gezo, the Dahonean war leader. As an Awori Ota King, declared in 1935, the conclusion of the war of Otal Ado Odo was led by Gbalefa, the Owu General and his Owu contingents and that is how Owu people not only conquered but occupy the now Gbalefa Peninsular.\n\nSafeguarding the Crown\n\nBefore Orile Erunmu was also devastated and razed to the ground, The Olowu and The Oluroko of Erunmu devised strategies to ensure that the royal lineages and the Crown inherited from Oduduwa was preserved. The Olowu entrusted the Owu Crown to a warrior, simply referred to as Akogun (Owu's first documented Akogun warrior. Akogun is a title similar to an army Defense Chief), Ijaola and a few of the king's closest aides. When the siege on Erunmu began, Akogun was assigned to the warfront with the hope that he could turn the tides of war while Ijaola was sent on a mandatory royal assignment to Ibadan with a message for Maye, an Ibadan warlord. Before these two Crown trustees left to carry out their respective orders, they had to entrust Oni (a skilled and specialized trader and farmer, and also the older stepbrother of Ijaola) with safeguarding of the Crown. Oni and other men entrusted with the Crown mingled with the refugees that eventually settled in Abeokuta. These men had strict instructions not to disclose the whereabout of the Crown in the absence of the Akogun and Ijaola, unless they received news of their death.\n\nThe Administration of Abeokuta\n\nIt is to be understood first and foremost that the Administration of Abeokuta is based on strict historical factors which clearly spells out areas of authority of each of the first 4 kings in Abeokuta, viz, Olowu,Agura, Osile and Alake. The largest part of the land of Ibadan through Bakatari, Odeda, Osiele to the eastern part of the old Igbo Egba is occupied mostly by Gbagura. Some of the Gbagura land which voluntarily declared their allegiance to the Alafin included Awe, Kojoku, Agerige, Aran, Fiditi, Abena, Akinmorin, Doba and Oroko. If today all these were to be added, Gbagura would be the largest Egba land. Agura is the key king over these traditionally Gbagura land.\n\nEgba Oke Ona owns the land that spreads north of Ona River and ran along the east fringes of Remoland and through Siun/Owode to Abeokuta.\n\nThe Egba forest which spreads from the southern part of Oyo through part of Oke Ogun down to the present Abeokuta ends at Oko Adagba and includes such independent towns as Ake, Ijeun, Oba, Igbein, Ijemo, Itoku, Imo, Emere, Kemta, Iro, Igbo, Erunwon, Itesi, Ikopa, Iporo and many other towns. Most all of them and their villages have zeroed-in in Abeokuta. The first Alake was installed in Abeokuta in August 1854. Today, there are ten of them: -\n\n(1) Okukenu 1854- 1862\n\n(2) Ademola I 1869 -1877\n\n(3) Oyekan 1879 -1881\n\n(4) Luwaji 1885 -1888\n\n(5) Sokalu 1891 -1898\n\n(6) Gbadebo I 1898 -1920\n\n(7) Ademola II 1920 -1962\n\n(8) Gbadebo II 1963 -1971\n\n(9) Lipede 1971- 2005\n\n(10) Okukenu (IV) 2005\n\nOWU ADMINISTRATION IN ABEOKUTA\n\n(1) Pawu April 1855 -1867\n\n(2) Adefowote 1867 -1872\n\n(3) Aderinoye 1873 -1890\n\n(4) Adepegba 1893 -1905\n\n(5) Owokokade 1906 -1918\n\n(6) DosunmuI 1918 -1924\n\n(7) Adesina 1924 -1936\n\n(8) Gbogboade 1938 -1946\n\n(9) Ajibola 1949 -1972\n\n(10) Oyegbade 1975 -1980\n\n(11) Oyelekan 1987 -1987\n\n(12) Odeleye 1993 -2003\n\n(13) DosunmuII 2005\n\nParamount Ruler of OwuKingdom, HRM. Oba Dr. Olusanya Adegboyega Dosunmu. His palace is situated in the heart of the rock city of Abeokuta, Ogun State, and indeed the Olowu of Owu, (HRM) Oba Olusanya Adegboyega Dosunmu, Amororo 2, Akobi Odua is a first class monarch and the Paramount Ruler of Owu Kingdom all over the world.\n\nOlowu Council\n\n7 groups constitute the Cabinet of the Olowu who is the paramount Ruler of Owu Kingdom. Listed below with the Olowu as Chairman constitute The Supreme Cabinet of the Olowu of Owu, which is now known as “OLOWU-IN-COUNCIL :\" The line of authority 1. Balogun 2. Olori Igbimo 3. Olori Omo-Oba 4. Olori Parakoyi 5. Oluroko of Erunmu 6. Balogun Apomu 7. Iyalode.\"\n\nOwu is ruled by Princes selected from six ruling houses: Amororo, Otileta, Ayoloye, Akinjobi, Akinoso and Lagbedu. These kings are assisted by a core of chiefs known as Ogboni and Ologun. This core of chiefs is headed by the Balogun who has under him Otun, Osi, Seriki, Aare Ago and Jagunna. Ogboni has as their head, the Akogun, Obamaja, Orunto, Oyega, Osupori and Omolasin. Olosi is the Ifa priest of the Olowu. Originally, Owu has 3 townships namely Owu, Erunmu and Apomu.\"\n\nIn the reign of Oba Odeleye (1993-2003) the number of Owu townships expanded to 22 and this eased the administration for Owu tremendously. By tradition, Olowus were selected by six kingmakers, but two more chieftaincies were added in 1964 including Balogun and Olosi.\n\nAlakosos who now assist the Oba in\n\nInterregnum\n\nIn 1855, the Owus crowned OBA Pawu as the first king Olowu of Owu of the Owus at Oke Ago-Owu, Abeokuta. Notably, there was a 21 year interregnum between the settlement of the Owu sojourners in Abeokuta and the crowning of Pawu as the first Olowu in Abeokuta. See past and present Olowu of Owu in Abeokuta. He reigned for 12 years.\n\nThe reason for the interregnum may be attributed to the deterioration of the socio-cultural bond that became evident during the journey between Orile Owu and Abeokuta. Hardship had made these Owu families insensitive to each other's welfare. The worst affected were the people of Erunmu because they were fewer. As a result of their minority status they were marginalized by other Owu indigenes. Oni the keeper of the Crown was convinced that if he revealed the Crown to a people who had grown insensitive to the needs of their brothers, he would allow despotic rule to hold sway over the townships of Owu, Erunmu and Apomu (the Owu kingdom in Abeokuta). Over the years, Akogun (the highly ranked soldier) arrived in Abeokuta, but he could neither locate Ijaola nor Ijaola's stepbrother, Oni. Also, unknown to the Olowu and Oluroko, Ijaola returned to Erunmu but had to hide on a farm settlement to escape capture. He later settled in Iwo town where there was a community of Owu refugees and began to trade in commodities and prisoners of wars. It was in the course of this trade that he re-connected with his stepbrother through another itinerant Owu merchant who was based in Abeokuta. Eventually, all arrangements were made for Ijaola to migrate to Abeokuta where he re-settled the people of Erunmu in Ita Erunmu (now called Totoro, after a tree). After Ijaola, Akogun and Oni consulted with each other, revealed the crown of Oduduwa 21 years after the Owu people first settled in Abeokuta.\n\nOwu tribe man, Dr. Wale Babalakin (Born Bolanle Olawale Babalakin) is a Nigerian businessman and a Lawyer. He is also a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and a recipient of the Nigerian national honour of Officer of the Federal Republic (OFR)[2] in 2007.\n\nOwu Tribal Mark\n\nThe larger Yoruba ethnic group are historically known to have used and still use facial tribal marks to distinguish one member of one sub-Yoruba tribe from other. It is said that Owus used a unique traditional facial mark called \"Keke Olowu\" to distinguish them from other tribal groups, especially when on war expeditions. The Keke or Gombo consists of four or five perpendicular and horizontal lines placed angularly on each cheek ; they occupy the whole space between the auricle and the cheek bone ; three small perpendiculars are also placed on the horizontal lines on both cheeks The Keke-Olowu, an Owu variation of these is like the Keke or Gombo with the lines discrete or interrupted and links each ear with the side of the cheeks. It was common prior to the later adoption of the agbaja-olowu.\n\nAbaja Olowu: The Abaja are sets of three or four parallel and horizontal lines on each cheek ; they may be single or double, each line being from half-an-inch to one inch long. The Abaja-Olowu in distinction from other abajas has 3 perpendicular etchings fitting neatly above 3 horizontal ones and are very thin and narrow in contradistinction from the very bold ones worn by other tribes. This is further accentuated with an additional 3 small horizontal etchings on the forehead called ‘keeta’.\n\nFurthermore, members of the royal families would have an additional 6 markings on the forearm with a further 3 below the navel.\n\nHRH Olowu of Owu and Jimi Agbaje\n\nOwu Day Festival (Odun Omo Olowu)\n\nThe original purpose of celebrating Omo Olowu festival is to give thanks to Olodumare (Almighty God) for supplying all needs. The annual Owu Day festival tradition started in 1999 and has attracted participation by several Owu indigenes and people from all over the world. On October 9, 2010, the Olowu of Owu Oba Dosunmu publicly declared the second weekend of the month of October as Owu's public celebration of the goodness of the Almighty God. This declaration was made to usher in the new Omo Olowu festival which is to henceforth replace the previous Owu Day Festival which incidentally had its 10th and final outing last year on the 10th day of the 10th month! The debuting Omo Olowu festival (reported in owulakoda.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/omo-olowu-festival-kicks-off) also incorporated the ancient traditional New Yam Festival which was dramatically staged by the Olowu himself, much to the delight, admiration and applause of the attendant crowd and dignitaries! The 2010 festival was attended by Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuade Olubuse II, former President of Nigeria, Balogun of Owu Olusegun Obasanjo, Chief of Staff to President Goodluck Jonathan, Chief Mike Oghiedome, former Governor and Field Commander of ECOMOG, Rtd General Tunji Olurin.\n\nBalogun Akin-Olugbade – Owu political and industrial icon who was the chief whip of Action Group, & succeeded Awolowo as the leader of the opposition in Nigeria’s first Parliament. He built a hospital & social center for the people of Abeokuta and was the Aare-Ona Kakanfo before his elevation to Balogun of Owu.\n\nSource:http://www.anistor.gr/english/enback/2013_3s_Anistoriton.pdf\n\nhttp://owulakoda.me/history-and-migrations/\n\nThe Owu War\n\nThe kingdom being now in a disorganized condition each tribal unit constituted itself an independent state. The Ifes in the east, and the Ijebus in the south formed an alliance against the Owus to the south-west of the former and north west of the latter.\n\nThe Owus (although now domiciled with the Egbas) are a family quite distinct from. Egbas or Oyos. Hardihood, stubbornness, immorality, and haughtiness are marked traits in their character, so much so that it has passed into a proverb \" A bi omg I'owu, o ni ako tabi abo ni, ewo ni jdo se omg nibe ? \" (a child is born at Owu, and you ask male or female : which will be a proper child ?) Either sex when roused by passion would sooner die than not take dire revenge. Their manners were totally different from those of the Oyos, but from the days of Sango they have been very loyal to the Alafin of Oyo.\n\nAs warriors, the Owus were hardy, brave, and courageous, they had no guns, their weapons consisting of the Agedengbe (a long heavy cutlass) with bows and arrows. Coming to close quarters with cutlass in hand was the mode of fighting characteristic of these brave people.\n\nThe cause of the war between these three families was this : —\n\nWe have already stated above that during the reign of King Abiodun, express orders were sent from Oyo to the Ooni of Ife, and the Olowu to prevent Oyos being kidnapped and sold at Apomu, the great market town where the interior and the coast people met for trade. Now, since the commencement of the revolution, and the disorganized state of the kingdom, the practice was revived. The rebellion has rendered the Central Authority powerless, but there were still some men of considerable power and influence in the land, such as Adegun the Onikoyi who was the premier provincial king, Toyejg theBal§ of Ogbomoso the Kakanfo, and Edun of Gbogun.\n\nA message similar to that sent by King Abiodun was now sent by the Onikoyi and the Kakanfo conjointly to the Olowu, and he in carrying out his orders had to chastise several towns ; hence Ikoyi Igbo, Apomu, Ikire, Irkn, He Olup^mi, Itahakun, Iseyin Odo, Iwata, Akinboto, Gbkngan, Isope, Iwara, and Jagun, were\n\ndestroyed by war, all in Ife territory.\n\nThe Ooni of Ife was highly incensed at this and declared war against Owu. The command of the war was entrusted into the hands of his commander-in-chief Singunsin. Other war-chiefs associated with him were : — Okansk, Gbogbo Olu, Wasin, Alodeloko, etc. Their first encampment was at a place called Dariagbon a farm village of one O1upona, next at Sifirin at the confluence of the Osun and Ohk rivers.\n\nThe Ifes thought they would make an easy conquest of Owu for they themselves are a brave people, and hence this war song in their peculiar dialect : —\n\nE maha ja (a) gba, Let us cut ropes,\n\nIgbekun la mu a di Our captives to bind.\n\nIf a Olowu The Olowu's If a (god of palm nut)\n\nEwa la mu a se With our corn we'll cook.\n\nThe Owns received the news that war was declared against them with great indignation. They considered themselves the power in these southern regions, and what infatuation has led the Ifes to this presumption ? With one consent they immediately marched out to meet them at this great distance. The engagement was a\n\nhand to hand fight in which the Ifes were completely routed ; their army was all but totally annihilated, only about 200 escaped to tell the tale of their dire misfortune !\n\nThe King of Iwo, in whose territory this disaster took place did not admit the survivors into his town for fear of incurring the displeasure of his formidable neighbours the Owus, whom he dreaded ar;d of whom he was jealous, but he so far sympathized with them that he advised that they should not undergo the humiliation of returning home, and he allowed them to rendezvous in a place called Adunbieiye for the purpose of recruiting their army and to try another chance, secretly hoping that fortune may favour them next time, and being ill at ease with such a formidable neighbour as the Owus.\n\nThis small army remained in this place for about 5 years, unable to return home from shame, and yet could not obtain re-inforcement adequate for the great enterprise.\n\nJust as this crisis the Owus and the Ijebu traders had a serious complication at the Apomu market. The dispute arose from the sale of alligator pepper, and it resulted in the rash expedition against Apomu by the haughty Owus ; the town was destroyed, and many Ijebu traders and residents lost their lives or their all.\n\nThe king of Iwo thereupon advised the Ifes to form an alliance with the Ijebus, who, like them, have now a grievance against Owu. When this was done, the lies at home were now willing to re-inforce their wrecked army for a conjoint attack upon Owu. The Ijebus now declared war against Owu, and crossing the Osun river, encamped at the farm of one Oso.\n\nThe Ijebus were better armed than either their allies or their foes, and indeed, than any of the interior tribes, for, being nearest to the coast, they had the advantage of obtaining guns and gun- powder from Europeans in exchange for slaves. They were remarkable marksmen. The older men with their cloths tied round their waists, and the ends left flowing behind, constituted the regular fighting column : being too old pr too heavy to run away, they were obliged to be courageous.\n\nThe Owns were mad with rage at the receipt of the news that anyone, such as the Ijebus, had presumed to declare war against them who (as they considered themselves) were the first power in these parts (southern Yoruba). They rushed out to check the progress of the Ijebus as they did that of the Ifes, and attacked them furiously cutlass in hand. But they were compelled to fall back from the steady fire of the Ijebus which did great havoc amongst them. Summoning courage, the Owns offered another obstinate battle, but they were again repulsed with a heavy slaughter, having lost in the first and second engagements about 40 of their leaders. This was the first check to their pride.\n\nThey rallied, however, and retreated to a short distance, and then again ventured upon another attack, the Ijebus advancing as they were retreating : they finally met, and once more fortune was against the Owus, and they fled precipitately to fortify their city against the expected siege.\n\nThe Ijebus with their allies the Ifes encamped to the west of the city of Owu, under a large tree called the Ogilngun, east of the town of Oje. We may here remark that although the Egba towns of Of a and Oje were about a mile and two miles respectively from Owu, yet so bitter was the animosity between them that not only did these towns refuse their aid to Owu, but rather rejoiced at its misfortunes !\n\nThe Owus fought with their accustomed bravery, and in one furious assault, routed the allies, and pursued them to Oje, Ofa, and Ibadan. The first two places were deserted in the general confusion and panic, and all sought refuge at Ibadan. Here the allies received reinforcements from the Egbas, and from the Oyo refugees from the north whose homes had been devastated by the Fulanis and who were now scattered about the provinces homeless, and without occupation. Glad to find some occupation in arms, these refugees flocked to the standard of the allies in numbers ; and thus strengthened, the war was renewed. The siege lasted about 5 years (usually reckoned as 7). The city was obstinately defended by the brave inhabitants from the walls, and from the forts built on the walls of the city. One Skkulk was an expert sharp shooter who was never known to miss his aim ; he contributed much to the defence of the town. But he was at the same time a good-natured man, kind and merciful to his enemies. Whenever he saw a young man hazarding his life too close to the forts in order to show valour, pitying his youth, he used to hail at him from the fort, and warn him as follows : — \" I give you your life for to-day, but do not venture here to-morrow or you shall die.\" And he was alw^ays as good as his word. Thus Sakulk defended the city heroically and killed many a valiant warrior.\n\nAt last, the allies held a council of war, and were determined to get rid of S^kulk on the next day. The Ijebus, who had guns were the foremost, and the whole army directed their fire and showers of darts at the fort where S^kiila was fighting, all kept shooting at that one spot, until they saw Skkiilk fall, suspending\n\nfrom the fort !\n\nOwu was now deprived of her bravest defender, and famine also began its fatal work within its walls. It was at this time the Owns began for the first time to eat those large beans called popondo (or awuje) hitherto considered unfit for food ; hence the taunting songs of the allies : —\n\nPopondo I'ara Owu nje. The Owus now live on propondo,\n\nAje f'ajaga bo 'run. That done, their necks for the yoke.\n\nUnto this day, whoever would hum this ditty within the hearing of an Owu man, must look out for an accident to his own person. For all the famine within, the besiegers could neither scale the walls, nor force the gates open, until Akinjobi the Olowu opened a gate, and escaped to Erunmu, one of the principal towns in his\n\nterritory. The chief of this place was one Oluroko who was nearly related to the Ow6ni of Ife. Oluroko protected his over- lord. The allies pursued the Olowu to this place, but Oluroko when called upon to answer for his conduct, submitted himself, and asked for pardon, showing that he could not have acted\n\notherwise and be blameless. ^ The allies saw with him, and pardon was accordingly granted him.\n\nIkija was the only Egba town which befriended the city of Owu in her straits hence after the fall of the latter town, the combined armies went to punish her for supplying Owu with provisions during the siege. Being a much smaller town, they soon made short work of it. After the destruction of Ikija,^ the allies returned to their former camp at Idi Ogungun (under the Ogiingun tree) .\n\n\"Owu was thenceforth placed under an interdict, never to be rebuilt ; and it was resolved that in future, however great might be the population of Oje — the nearest town to it — the town walls should not extend as far as the Ogungun tree, where the camp was pitched. Consequently to this day, although the land may be cultivated yet no one is allowed to build a house on it.\n\n[In the year 1873 Akinyemi one of the sons of one Bolade of Ibadan happened to build a substantial farm house at Owu. Latosisk then the Kakanfo at Ibadan ordered it to be pulled down immediately, and Akinyemi was fined besides].\n\nAfter the fall of Owu and Ikija, the army was not disbanded, but the commanders of the Ife and of the Ijebu armies returned home to give an account of the war to their respective masters, but the remnants still in the camp were continually swelled by recruits from Oyo refugees whom the Fulanis had rendered homeless.\n\nAfter a time the Ijebus in the camp invited the allies home to their country as friends ; then they broke up the camp at \" Idi Ogungun \" and withdrew to Ipara in the south.\n\nIt should be noted that the Owu war marked a definite period in Yoruba history. It was here for the first time gunpowder was used in war in this country, and it was followed by the devastation of the Egba townships and the foundation of modern Abeokuta and Ibadan, to be related in due course."
