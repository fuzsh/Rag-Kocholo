Wahab Alawiye-King has advised the 2000 newly recruited primary school teachers to familiarize themselves with all necessary public service documents that would aid them in the discharge of their duties effectively to the State Government.\n\nAt an induction ceremony organised for the newly recruited teachers at LASUBEB office in Maryland today, the Chairman underscored the indispensability of the Public Service Rules, Financial Regulations and some other service documents to the new employees, saying that the materials are important to the teachers to guide their conduct, utterances and interaction as government officials.\n\n“Get yourself acquainted with the system, get a copy of the Public Service Rules, know your rights, limitations and responsibilities. Develop yourself from time to time and be certified by the relevant professional body so that you can be globally competitive,” the LASUBEB Chairman pleaded.\n\nThe induction programme which was held simultaneously at five different centres, according to Alawiye-King, was important considering the different background of the new employees who are very fresh in the system and to avoid situations where they would ignorantly run foul of some laid down procedures in service.\n\nHe said, “This induction programme is customary for every new employee. It is meant to give you a smooth entry into the teaching Service at the basic education level.”\n\nHe congratulated the newly employed for scaling through the very rigorous selection processes and for being able to be employed among many other qualified applicants who also applied for the job.\n\nHe said he was happy to see very passionate individuals as applicants for the teaching job, stressing that the professional level which teaching has now assumed shows that qualified individuals could now be employed as teachers as against the practice in the past when people are usually persuaded to join the teaching Service.\n\nAlawiye-King also counselled the newly employed teachers on financial intelligence and management of their resources to meet their needs especially now that they have fixed sources of regular income.\n\nWhile making a presentation to the new employees, the Director-General of Lagos State Public Service Staff Development Centre, PSSDC, Dr. Senukon Ajose-Harrison challenged the teachers to think “outside the box”, broaden their horizon and be abreast of what happens in other places across the world especially as teaching is concerned.\n\n“Hone your skills to be at par with the demands of 21st-century teaching skills and let your goals be S.M.A.R.T. which is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely,” the DG stated.\n\n-CONFERENCE 57 CPS\n\nAkosile, Afonja others advocate regulated salaries for CPS, youth affairs department across local councils and loyalty among grassroots media aides\n\nFakunle Sheriff Ekundayo and Kaosarat Olaleye reports Monday, November 23, 2020.\n\nConference 57 Chief Press Secretaries(CPS) in Lagos State held her annual three days media retreat at Spicery Hotel, Jibowu in Yaba Local Council Development Area, from November 20 – 22, 2020.\n\nThis year’s media retreat theme was: Going Digital: An Essential Move in a post COVID-19 World and combating fake news.\n\nThe annual media retreat serves as an avenue for the Chief Press Secretaries {CPS} to council chairmen across the 57 local governments and council development areas to learn, interact, explore new ideas and upgrade their media status in their various job task.\n\nOne of the founding members of the association, Saheed Akanbi Ade Afonja, who is also the Senior Special Assistant on youth matters to Lagos Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and whose immense contribution towards the formation of CPS’57 cannot be over-emphasized lauded the impact of CPS in the grassroots.\n\nHe said: “I sincerely appreciate the CPS for not only being the mouthpiece of the grassroots but also keeping them abreast of salient issues.

There is no such plan. The officials of the Child Protection Unit of the Ministry were sent to visit the mother of three in order to gather information about her living condition with a view to giving necessary assistance”.\n\nThe Commissioner recalled that the attention of the Ministry was earlier drawn to a video that surfaced online about Mrs. Afusat Salami, where she narrated her deplorable living condition and called for help from philanthropists to alleviate the standard of living of her family and the newly delivered set of triplets, through a Polaris bank account number.\n\nAccording to him, “Precisely on the 5th of November, 2020, when the Ministry received information about Mrs. Salami, who resides at Owolabi Street, Oshogun, Alapere, Ketu area of the State, a team of government officials from the Child Protection Unit of the Ministry was immediately sent to visit and assured her of the intervention from the government”.\n\n“Mrs. Salami told the government officials that the COVID-19 pandemic had affected her source of livelihood, being a petty trader in a school, and the inability of her husband to meet the family’s financial obligations made her cry out for financial assistance. She was, however, advised to desist from using the children to beg for financial assistance as the government promised to support her and the family”, he added.\n\nThe Commissioner maintained that the Ministry of Youth and Social Development, saddled with the statutory responsibility of giving succour to the downtrodden, will continue to do all within its power for social protection of children and all residents of the State.\n\nOver the past few months of this year in this great citadel of learning, University of Lagos, we have gone through tick and thin. Despite the challenges from various quarters, we have been victorious and there are no limit to much victories to harvest as each day breaks. Our inbuilt features of resilience, diligence, honesty and loyalty has helped greatly in paving ways.\n\nThe recent development as regards the reinstatement of PROF OLUWATOYIN OGUNDIPE as the Vice chancellor of the first choice and nations pride university in Nigeria, University of Lagos is a welcome one and the Office of the Secretary General of the National Association of Nigerian Students(NANS) Southwest wishes to congratulate the Vice Chancellor, members of staff and students for standing against injustice and abuse of power in this prestigious institution of learning.\n\nJust trying to overcome the shock from the abrupt postponement of the yearly convocation, erstwhile Pro Chancellor, DR. WALE BABALAKIN showcased his despotic and tyrannical tendencies by organising a kangaroo process to remove a sitting Vice-Chancellor who many students testify to his fatherly care for them. This act led to unrest and acrimony within the University system which both the Staff and Students had to clamour for external and supreme intervention.\n\nWe thank the President for setting up a committee to investigate the situation and the recommendations of the Panel shows our conviction that Professor Ogundipe is indeed a quintessential scholar and an academic of excellence. His administration has changed the face of the University in many ways.\n\nThe recommendation also support our belief that Dr Babalakin did not follow the laid down process and his actions are akin to an authoritarian.\n\nWe are very pleased for the reinstatement of the wrongfully suspended Vice Chancellor, Prof. Ogundipe and the Government’s dissolving the abusive and tyrannical governing council led by Dr. Babalakin.\n\nBased on this, we are very proud to congratulate Mr VC on his reinstatement and hereby urge him to keep up with the good works he has started. Likewise, we reassure him of the students cooperation and support to ensure good rapport and relationship that would aid a swift and encouraging development in the Institution.\n\nCom GIWA YISA TEMITOPE\n\nSECRETARY GENERAL NANS SOUTHWEST\n\nThe Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt.
