        "text": "By Funsho Arogundade\n\nWhenever the list of illustrious Nigerians who have contributed to the socio-economic growth of the country is to be compiled, the name of successful lawyer and business tycoon, Dr. Wale Babalakin won’t be missing. His journey as a young son of an iconic jurist has really helped his trajectory to becoming a towering figure in law, business, and humanitarian efforts.\n\nBabalakin’s educational path laid the foundation for his illustrious career. A cursory look at his resume suffices: Babalakin graduated as one of the best three students from the Department of Law, University of Lagos at the age of 21; Called to the Bar at 22, he was one of the three Africans admitted into the Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University for the pioneer Master’s degree in Law and bagged his Ph.D at 26. His legal career is marked by his elevation to the Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) in 2002 and he received the national honor of Officer of the Federal Republic (OFR), in 2007. For the Chairman of Stabilini Visinoni Limited, Resort International Limited and Bi-Courtney Limited among others, certainly, his legal acumen and business prowess have established him as a formidable force in Nigeria’s professional landscape. His conglomerate has been a purveyor of employment to hundreds of Nigerian youths.\n\nSo on Monday 1 July when Babalakin turned 64, expectedly, his family members, friends and admirers celebrated the man whose life story is a testament to perseverance, excellence, and unwavering commitment to philanthropy. He is seen as a beacon of light to the older generation and an inspiration to the younger generation. At 64, Osun State-born Babalakin remains unwavering in his dedication to excellence, profound impact on education and compassionate philanthropy."
