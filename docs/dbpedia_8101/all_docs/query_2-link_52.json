        "text": "By Funsho Arogundade\n\nAs a daughter-in-law to the President of the biggest black nation on earth, Layal Jade Tinubu’s identity is always intertwined with her husband’s family’s public persona and career. Layal, born and raised in the Netherlands into an aristocratic family, is a trained lawyer. Of course, as a spouse to the son of a prominent figure, there is potential influence and soft power associated with her position but she is still determined to create her own path in the social-entrepreneurial world detached from her husband’s privileged background.\n\nFor many years, Layal has been a successful entrepreneur and has been running the Noella Foundation, a non-profit initiative she co-founded with her husband, Seyi Tinubu. The main mission of the foundation is to address key societal challenges that are not often spoken about through strategic partnerships and impactful initiatives, and then transform the lives of vulnerable and marginalized women, children/young adults and the elderly in specific communities and provide lasting solutions.\n\nAs part of this mission, Layal, who is also the CEO of Tots Toys, recently unveiled an impressive N40 million initiative aimed at uplifting and empowering young women in enterprise. The latest initiative tagged, “Be Empowered,” had its maiden edition on 29 June and it left a lasting impact on the beneficiaries and all those in attendance. Fourteen young female entrepreneurs were empowered with a shared sum of N40 million grant. They were also provided with various tools and opportunities they need to start, scale, and sustain their businesses."
