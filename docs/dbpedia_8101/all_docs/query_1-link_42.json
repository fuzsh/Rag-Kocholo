Thank you!\n\nAccount no: 0241907647\n\nAccount name: Union of Campus Journalists, UI\n\nBank: WEMA BANK\n\nThe Union of Campus Journalists has been in existence since 1987. A student controlled organisation fully registered by the Students’ Affairs Division University of Ibadan (U.I.) It is the chief media entity and umbrella body of press organizations registered with the union in the University of Ibadan and the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan. Affiliated to it are independent press clubs, with membership strength of over 3000 students.\n\nThe union is committed to improving the standards of campus journalism with a view to ensuring its parity with mainstream journalism. It was fashioned after the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) which is the professional body of “penpushers”. Just like NUJ, UCJ caters for the interest of Campus Journalists and promotes other intellectual activities on campus. The union is committed to entrenching intellectualism as a core idea of student."
