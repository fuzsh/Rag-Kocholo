        "text": "“Nigeria is not yet a wealthy country, but Nigeria has the hope of being a wealthy country if we engage the youth”\n\nThe above statement was made by Nigeria’s famous lawyer cum Business man; Wale Babalakin SAN during the 68th Anniversary of SIGMA club in the University of Ibadan. If the eminent SAN’s opinion were right as given, Nigeria’s treasury and financial accounts are simply not enough to keep it afloat. To him, the people, the youths are the solution to Nigeria’s financial problems.\n\nTruly, the people of Nigeria are a treasure who really are worthy to be called a nation’s wealth. But like every unidentified treasure Nigeria’s youth have been overlooked, suppressed and deprived. So, with all these forms of discouragement and many despair that has been brought to Nigerian youths, is there really hope left in this raw treasure and will it ever be mined?\n\nObviously, that is not the question, for it is already being identified by many foreign entities who also has been mining it in what Economists call “Brain Drain”. According to skilled.com “brain drain is the movement of skilled individuals from a less developed area to a more developed area”. Without any doubt, Nigerians are skilled individuals and not just skilled but also sophisticated with all that it takes to make an idea work no matter how lofty it is. Little wonder in his visit to Aso Villa on the 2nd September, 2016, Mark Zuckerberg described Nigerians as really talented and full of passion. He was quoted by Vanguard to have said: “I was highly impressed by the talent of the youths…in Yaba… I was blown away by their talents and the level of energy that I saw.” , FACEBOOK is said to have quite a number of Nigerians on its payroll.\n\nSo that is how it operates, various individuals, industries, and nations are ready to offer all that will be desired to skilled Nigerians and have them convert their skills to their own use. Thus, the value of our wealth is given up. And what we have is empty mass of metal only denoted to us by the birth certificates we can lay hold on and their origin we can trace. Consequently, we hear Nigerians boasting of people like Babs Omotowa, John Boyega, Bayo Ogunlesi and Anthony Joshua when indeed they’ve poured out and are pouring out their values to other countries apart from Nigeria in sectors that Nigeria is itself lacking in. They cannot be blamed anyway because if they insisted on Nigeria, their value may have never be detected or if detected, eventually ignored.\n\nThus, our leaders and many others who have gone ahead, have sold the bulk of what seems to be Nigeria’s true wealth: its capable people. But, yet it is not over. For the greatest gift we’ve got is not just the people, but, the increasing number of the people – the population.\n\nSo how should the potentials of the remaining 170 million Nigerians be tapped into and optimised? First and foremost, it’s time that sustainable empowerment rules the philosophies of every Nigerian home. Parent and siblings should start teaching their “littluns” to live and act in ways that empower them and equip their imaginations. The whole adventurous years of childhood should not be wasted by only being spent in schools learning the A of the B and the C which in this present age is too basic but yet one of the best things Nigeria’s education can yet offer. Many Nigerians adding value to their society including Adichie, Sefi Atta have been able to point to moments in their childhood when their enlightened parents had helped equip their young imaginations.\n\nMoreover, it also boils down to the same governmental problem and its cantankerous corruption issues. So therefore, it must be remembered that when wrong choices are being made at the polls, individual inherent value is being set for corrosion.\n\nNonetheless, any serious minded government can try its best to woo Nigerians doing exploits in diaspora, but foremost, things must be put in place here at home. Hopefully, a government will be able to achieve that feat and pull its long-gone sons home. Hopefully, it will not be the tale of the Biblical Esau who sought his birth right with tears after selling it never to find it again."
