        "text": "Lawyer and businessman, Wale Babalakin (SAN), tells TOFARATI IGE and ALEX OKERE about his career, marriage, parents and other issues\n\nHow does it feel being 60?\n\nI give God the glory. To be 60 in a country where the average lifespan of the Nigerian is less than 60, I thank God for that. I don’t feel old. But I feel that our generation has not been as fortunate or done as well as our parents’. I always try to compare what is happening to me and my generation to what happened to my father and his generation. A 60-year-old man in my father’s generation was a fulfilled man. He was a man either retired or looking forward to retirement. He was a man that had seen life through; he had achieved a lot personally, contributed to society and fully trained his children. At 60, I feel grateful to God that I am alive, I have not done too badly but I wish the nation had done better.\n\nMany believe you are one of the biggest beneficiaries of the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, with reference to the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos; the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, both concessioned to you, and the old federal secretariat building. What is your response to that?\n\nYou see, the biggest challenge in Nigeria is ignorance. All these issues you’ve mentioned can easily be verified. The facts can be ascertained. But strangely enough, nobody seems to care about the truth. What we have in Nigeria, which is sad, is propaganda rather than factual, in-depth reporting of situations. I’m happy that you have presented these issues because they enable me tell the public what happened. I will start with the Federal Secretariat. There was an advertisement in the newspapers that disused government buildings that were becoming environmental problems would be converted to good use. The old federal secretariat building in Ikoyi, Lagos was advertised; it was the most hotly contested bid that I have ever participated in because after a while, we were left with three bidders, and one of the bidders was my friend, Aliko Dangote.\n\nThe bid spanned almost two years with the government setting up at least three different committees to verify the bids. We (Bi-Courtney Group) emerged as the preferred bidder and paid for the property in accordance with the bid. I don’t know that anybody who was interested in the bid was excluded. I’m not aware that anybody who put in a bid did not have a chance to defend his bid. Post-mortem, after we’ve came up with our own ideas of converting the place to apartments, interests began and these interests were negative interests. But I don’t want to go into that now. I just want to say that there was no peculiar advantage for us (Bi-Courtney Group). We paid N7bn for the property in 2005. And at today’s cost, I want you to imagine how much the value of that money would have been today.\n\nMany are of the view that the Obasanjo administration gave you preferential treatment.\n\nObasanjo’s government gave us no preferential position on the old federal secretariat. Let me tell you about the old federal secretariat building. It was a well-conceived project. We moved to site around December, 2015. We had completed the design, totally prepared the buildings, and removed all the partitions for construction. We had also created a demo room where you could see what a two-bedroom or three-bedroom flat and a penthouse would look like. We had pre-sold half of it to the public, and one day, two years after, some people claiming to be agents of the Lagos State Government overran the place and stopped us from building. We couldn’t believe that this was happening in modern Nigeria. So, we made entreaties to the state government, but we discovered that the government’s argument was that the building ought to have been sold to the Lagos State Government and not anybody else. We saw that that argument was so mundane and irresponsible because if the Lagos State Government was interested, it should have put in a bid. If it did, then it could say it wanted some preferences because it is a government. But it didn’t participate in the bid at all for over two years but it overran the place.\n\nWe lost an unthinkable amount of money and fortunately for us, our lawyers anticipated the interference of the Lagos State Government, and had provided in the agreement that the Federal Government would be responsible for obtaining a no-objection approval from the Lagos State Government, if necessary. So, it was actually the Federal Government’s responsibility to protect us from the state government. I continue to thank the body of lawyers, Babalakin and Co; they have really supported me in my various endeavours because without that clause, today, we would have been orphans. Because of that clause, we went to arbitration against the Federal Government and we won. The arbitration also awarded us substantial damages and cleared the coast for us to resume our work.\n\nHas work resumed on the project?\n\nWe will resume work as soon as all the ancillary issues are sorted. So, the old federal secretariat was a beautiful transaction that would have initiated the urban renewal of Lagos, if not Nigeria. There are so many abandoned projects and there are so many abandoned buildings. But everybody points to the experience of the old federal secretariat and they are reluctant to participate in it. So, because of the unlawful action of the Lagos State Government, its revenue base has been short-changed, the availability of accommodation has been reduced and the environmental image of Lagos has been worsened. For every major project you stop unlawfully about 12 other good projects will refuse to come in and that is the position today. There is no single major project going on in Lagos today apart from Dangote Industries. This is because there is no enabling environment. Capital is very shy and timid; it only goes to secure places where the rules are known and where you are sure that if you put in your money and follow the rules, you are likely to get your return. But when the rules are opaque or subject to the whims and caprices of certain people, who will bring money?\n\nIs the story the same for MMA2 concessioned to your company as well?\n\nThere was a well-advertised bid for the airport and there were responses. At the end of the day, some companies emerged as the winner and we emerged as the reserved bidder. If (former) President Obasanjo had something to do with it, why didn’t we emerge as the winner? A year later, the Minister of Aviation called us and said the preferred bidder had not delivered on their commitment and told us to come in as the reserved bidder. When we came in, the design we were given by the authority was just a shed; we were told to build a shed for Nigerians as their airport. I had gone to South Africa for a meeting and South Africa was then completing its domestic airport. When I looked at it, I cried that we were going to build a shed in 2003, when South Africa had just completed a domestic terminal that looked like something out of this world in 2003. So, I came back and told the then minister, Chief Kema Chikwe, what I saw. She looked at it and was amazed. She advised me to make a presentation, we went to the whole process and our design was approved. That is the MMA2 you see today; to actualise it, we brought in South African architects and supported them with Nigerian architects. That is why 13 years after it was completed, there is no airport terminal in Nigeria that has the flow of MMA2 because it was well-thought out and designed. If we had been allowed to continue, phase two would have been completed 10 years ago and we would have had one of the best Airports in Africa.\n\nThe Federal Government revoked the concession for the Lagos-Ibadan road in 2012 on the grounds that your company violated the contract terms, with particular reference to your company’s failing to secure the needed funds for the job, amid several complaints…\n\nFor the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, again, there was a bid, there was a response to the bid and we emerged as the preferred bidder. I’m not aware of anybody who submitted a bid and didn’t receive any consideration. So, I don’t know where the complaint is coming from. But what is most sad is the picture that we were in default on the project. That story is totally false. We got approval for the project not under Obasanjo and it went to council (Federal Executive Council) under late President Umaru Yar’Adua. It was Yar’Adua that approved the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway project. We were to design, build, operate and transfer. We began the design and discovered that the current road had outlived its usefulness. It was built or completed around 1977. From Lagos to Ibadan, the plan was to have the road fenced and the fencing actually started but was not completed. There was no town on that road; you had to go outside the road to see Sagamu. But the road had been so messed up that so many towns had emerged on the road. Today, you have Ogere, Sagamu, Redeemed, NASFAT, Mowe and Isheri all on the road. We brought the best designers in the world to put it together while maintaining palliatives on the road and traffic control. Between 2009 and 2011, we had traffic controllers on the road, patching the road and putting the design together. We finished the design and submitted our inception report (with the first and second design) to the Federal Ministry of Works. It took the ministrys two years to be able to get back to us on this design. We lost two years to the ministry, with over 50 consultants that we had been paying for two years.\n\nWe thought it was time to brief former President Goodluck Jonathan; he gave us an appointment and we went with all the consultants who gave a display of what they were going to do to transform Nigeria’s infrastructure the way MMA2 transformed Nigerian aviation. The former president expressed satisfaction and told the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission to work with us and conclude the process. But a few weeks later, the project was terminated. It was a scandal. We had sunk an unthinkable amount of money in actualising that project. The project on that road included seven overhead bridges. I’m not even sure there is one overhead bridge on the one being built now. Also, our project had proper lay-bys; you didn’t have to buy petrol on the road. You had to go off the road for amount two minutes where you would find a restaurant, small hotel and all the facilities you would require. We had three of such on each side of the road. We also had a truck bay that could accommodate 12,000 trucks and was expandable because we counted the number of trucks on the road then and they were about 4,000. Now, they are about 6,000.\n\nEarly this year, the University of Lagos was enmeshed in a crisis resulting from a disagreement between you and the Vice Chancellor, with the UNILAG branch of the Academic Staff Union of the Universities accusing you of being dictatorial. What’s your reaction to that allegation?\n\nI was pro-chancellor, University of Maiduguri, Borno State, and in four years, we redeveloped the university and instituted more projects than it had done since inception. I have no personal issues at the University of Lagos, none at all. The first issue is that the press should always try and do proper fact-finding rather than relying on gossips.\n\nAre you saying you had no issue with anyone at the university?\n\nI have no issue with anybody at the University of Lagos. All I’m concerned with is that the laws of the university must be followed to the letter. And has anybody accused me of not following the laws of the university to the letter? All I have done as pro-chancellor is to follow the laws of the university to the letter and that is what I will continue to do. If you follow the laws of the university and Nigeria, you will have no problems with me. But if you think that I am going to compromise or waive those issues, I will not. I believe the noise came when the National Universities Commission postponed the convocation. The laws of the university were not followed in convening the convocation and so it was appropriately postponed. That is all.\n\nHas the crisis been resolved?\n\nThere was never a crisis. The crisis was in the media. If ASUU, the university or pro-chancellor make statements, they should be verified before they are published. I am not aware of any crisis at the University of Lagos.\n\nWhat is your story with the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria?\n\nI never owed AMCON any money and I give gratitude to my lawyers. When the airport agreement was mercilessly violated, when we were deprived of all our rights and our revenues were curtailed, our lawyers went to court and got a judgement for N132bn against the Federal Government. As soon as AMCON was created, our lawyers went to court to say that we had a judgement credit of N132bn against the Federal Government and if there was any Federal Government agency that we owed money, they should set it off. And it was approved by the courts. AMCON appealed and the Supreme Court confirmed the N132bn judgement credit in our favour and the set off. We had about N20bn to N30bn we were alleged to be owing AMCON and based on this set off, we were entitled to a credit of N100bn. That is the law today, irrespective of any propaganda of AMCON. Our company, Resort International, the owners of the old federal secretariat, paid N7bn. We borrowed N4bn for construction and pre-sold half to an entity on certain terms and conditions and used the money to build. When AMCON came, we explained to it that we didn’t have any debt, that we owed N4bn and it was even current. We have paid N1.3bn and it was a five-year loan, out of which we had done about two years and would pay the balance. But AMCON refused and took us to court. When we got to court, we counter-claimed that we didn’t have any debt, save the N2.3billion or N2.7 billion, and that the other thing AMCON was claiming was a debt was an equity investment. You can’t turn an equity investment to a debt overnight. When we got to court, AMCON got no document that we owed any money, yet it had published our names for seven years that Resort International owed. The court did the right thing and held that we owed no money, that AMCON had libelled us and that the court awarded us N3bn as damages for libel. We think the libel award was very little, but, at least, we made a statement. Today, based on Nigerian laws, we are not indebted to AMCON. Whatever you hear on the contrary is propaganda. I think AMCON wants to go on an appeal but I don’t know what the basis will be.\n\nHow do you think companies can best manage the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses?\n\nCOVID-19 is beyond everybody’s imagination. It’s not something that had been contemplated. In law, when occasions occur that could not have been within the reasonable contemplation of the parties involved, it is called ‘frustration’.\n\nCOVID-19 is a frustration. I don’t think it’s easy for the private sector to manage it. It is the government’s responsibility to assist in managing it. But today in Nigeria, government’s resources are limited because we did not save money when we had a buoyant economy.\n\nFor example, in Canada, the government said it would give everybody, irrespective of their immigration status, $1,800 to stay at home and not work.\n\nIn a particular country, the government paid 75 per cent of the salaries of workers in the private sector.\n\nMy sister is a consultant psychiatrist in Atlanta, United States. Recently, she called me in excitement that she got a cheque of $202,000 from the government for her to manage COVID-19 because she employs people and they see her tax returns. Unfortunately, if you read the Nigerian Constitution, the emphasis is not on savings but on sharing of revenue. Revenue comes from the Federation Account and we share every month.\n\nWithout saving money, we cannot be a strong nation. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I know a lot of companies that have been paying full salaries without fail. That’s only possible because they saved money.\n\nWhen the young generation gets into government, the first emphasis should be on saving money. Nigeria should be restructured in a manner that the emphasis is on how to create revenue and save money and not simply sharing money.\n\nImagine if we had $200bn in our external reserves, COVID-19 would have been a different experience.\n\nWhat are the most important qualities you think every leader should have?\n\nOne must convince oneself that one has something to give before one aspires (for leadership). If one aspires only because one wants to partake in government resources, then one would have failed from the beginning. Anyone aspiring to leadership must be ready to show a lot of selflessness. I don’t want to go into details because I have not really put my mind to it.\n\nWhat advice do you have for young professionals in terms of career development?\n\nThey must face life in phases. The first phase is to be good students of great character while in school. When they graduate, they should also take interest in what we used to call ‘civics’ in those days. It is not right to be a graduate and not know anything about your community and contribute to it. There are things they can do that would be very significant if they put their minds to it. You don’t need a lot of resources (to make an impact). The first thing you need is commitment. While watching the television recently, I saw a young boy who was in his second year in the University of Calabar. He was from a remote boundary town between Calabar (Nigeria) and Cameroon. He realised that the people of the town didn’t know anything about sanitation and they had no money. So, he created a ‘sanitiser system’. He produced soap, water to make the sanitiser without electricity. The boy and his invention were shown on television. The cost of his contraption was probably about N5,000 but he elevated a community. Now, the Commissioner of Finance (in Cross River) has said that the state government would invest in the project.\n\nIf that young man had been some other person, he would probably have said his parents were not rich and he could not do anything because he didn’t have money. Thus, one must take interest in one’s community.\n\nFor the younger ones, you must decide the political system you want and push for it. You must create alliances to push for whatever you want. Don’t just wait to be used by a godfather.\n\nCan you recall how you met your wife?\n\nA great friend of mine came to pick me up from Cambridge University (where I was schooling) to attend a function in London. While in the car, my friend and her girlfriend were talking so glowingly about a particular lady. I listened without any interest and I decided to go and look for the lady (laughs). I pretended not to have interest so I could get the information.\n\nBeyond the rosy pictures that were painted by your friends, what were the qualities that endeared you to your wife?\n\nShe is a very private person, so I wouldn’t want to discuss about her in the public. She has always avoided the media since I met her. Anytime she is mentioned in the media, it is probably because of me.\n\nSome people believe that African men are not romantic. Do you subscribe to that notion?\n\nMy wife is in the best position to answer that question.\n\nDo you often initiate romantic gestures?\n\nMy wife is the one that can define whether something is romantic or not. I may do some things with the intention of being romantic and she could find them boring.\n\nAll I want is a good marriage and I thank God I have one.\n\nWith your busy schedule, how have you been able to make time for your family?\n\nAt the end of the day, life is led in compartments. One must be able to put everything in compartments. It’s as important to be successful in your career as in your family life. It’s important to be successful in whatever one sets one’s mind to do. I thank God for where I am. I wish I could have done better in certain areas but I thank God.\n\nWhat are some of the fondest memories you have of your childhood in Ibadan (Oyo State)?\n\nGrowing up in Ibadan was very exciting. Ibadan was a beehive of activities and at the same time, a very sane environment. The core values our parents taught us in Ibadan were quite different from what I saw when I came to Lagos.\n\nI attended a private nursery school but there was a free (public) education system that produced better students than those of us who were paying fees. That was the society I grew up in.\n\nThen, I went to Government College Ibadan where there was no status. It was a leveller. One’s parents’ achievements counted for nothing in the school. What counted were being a good student, being a good sportsman, being a good member of the Cadet Unit, being a good member of the Literary and Debating Society, and being a good leader.\n\nThere was a year when students ‘bolted’ (left the school without permission) and they were caught. The first person on the list was the son of the Federal Minister of Education, yet he was suspended. And his father could not tell the principal to reverse the decision. That was the environment I grew up in where there was so much merit. I would like to see that system reflected in Nigeria.\n\nYour father was a jurist and your mother was a hospital proprietress. Such professionals are believed to be strict. Was that your experience?\n\nMy father is alive at 94 and I continue to thank him for his determination to straighten me out. To say my father was strict would be an understatement. He was very strict. But later in life, I discovered that it was beneficial because it taught me discipline, the sense of what was right and what was wrong. I remain grateful to him.\n\nYou’ve done a lot of philanthropic deeds in memory of your late mum. What do you miss most about her and what were the fundamental lessons she taught you that are still beneficial to you?\n\nMy mother was a very peculiar woman and may her soul continue to rest in peace. She was multitalented and multifaceted. Even though she ran a very successful hospital, she was also a phenomenal housewife and a mother of seven children. Yet, she combined the roles effortlessly.\n\nShe never gave up on me because I was a very unruly young boy. She always felt that I would straighten out and when I was 18, I had straightened out. She was there with me when I was most unruly, praying that I would actualise whatever I was determined to do.\n\nAlso, she was extremely generous. There was no time in our home that we didn’t have at least eight other people living with us that my parents were sponsoring in school. And they all had the same quality of education with us.\n\nThere is nothing I do that can pay her for all she did for me as a young boy and young adult. She died when I was 44 years old in 2004. I miss her dearly.\n\nYou received your PhD at 26 yet you mentioned that you were unruly till the age of 18. How did that transformation come about and what type of student were you?\n\nI was a very unruly student until, by accident, I discovered intellectual work. I remember vividly that I went to see two ladies in higher school. When I got to their room, they asked me not to disturb them as they had tests in two days. They went on to say I was one that didn’t take my work seriously. I felt insulted and I promised to return to teach them the subject the next day. So, I went to the library, studied the topic and went to teach them. They were very surprised. They said when the teacher was teaching them, they didn’t understand it that well.\n\nAfter the text the next day, the teacher started announcing the results. Usually, he started from the last person till he got to the first position. Meanwhile, I sat on the last row, near the window and was usually among the first 10 names that he always called being one of the last in the class. On that particular, he didn’t call my number till he got to the first position. Everybody in the class was surprised. They wondered how I could have passed so well.\n\nThen, we had great teachers. That particular teacher was Mr. Oyegoke. He then said I should never sit at the back again but on the first row. From then on, I started to enjoy reading. I finished my first degree at 21, went to the Nigerian Law School at 22, had my Master’s degree at 23 and PhD at 26.\n\nDid your father actively influence you to study Law?\n\nNo. My father’s position was that I should choose a career that would enable me find job satisfaction and feed myself. He made it clear to me from when I was 15 years old that I shouldn’t depend on him. He promised to give me good education but not money. But at the end of the day, he ended up giving me the two. I’m very indebted to my father.\n\nHow do you unwind?\n\nThe Lagos State I came into in 1986/1987 is different from what obtains now. There were no security challenges. Anyway, I love bboating. I would go on the boat alone for long distances.\n\nI also love engaging in debates that are designed to improve the nation and the welfare of the people. I have been threatening to farm but I have not started though I believe I would do that soon.\n\nAlso, I participate in a lot of philanthropic activities but if you ask me for specifics, I wouldn’t tell you because it is part of philanthropy not to announce whatever one does.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.
