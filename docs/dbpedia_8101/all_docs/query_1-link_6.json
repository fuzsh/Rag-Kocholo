        "text": "In an urban-culture city of Lagos, inhabited by diverse worship and faith, Ijo Orunmila Adulawo Worldwide faithful worship with songs, language, liturgy, and great testimonies, as they affirmed, there is worship in the city…\n\nI was just trying to find what important project to embark in 2017 and I remember how I have been fraternizing with Orunmila story as part of a 2006 documentary series that never saw the light of the day. Research have been carried out on different culture related topics but was abandoned due to lack of funds, the usual suspects that always come to cripple creative ideas. The traditional style of worship started coming to me for exploration in film, photographs and reportage. I quipped again, why this idea? I ran away from it and moved into the Christmas season but once again, the idea came back, now this time, very big and so important. I decided to go online for connectors and I found a Facebook account for ‘Ijo Orunmila Adulawo Worldwide’, I checked in and introduced myself with a proposal attached. A day later, I discovered a response on my mission and this gladdened my heart that something is happening so fast in the new year, as if I have all the money. No! I didn’t have a dime but the drive was just there to do it.\n\nA certain connector from the other end introduced himself as Bosun Adetayo, who handles the platform. All the way, our discussions have always been formal with all the formalities observed. The account holder on the other end gave me the assurance that I am indeed welcome to engage them and see who they are and what they represent. He assured me further, that he has spoken with the elders among the faith and they also gave their words to be of help to make my documentary film worthwhile. But a little crack observed by Bosun was simply the address on the proposal which he had gone through. He revealed to me that the proposal was actually addressed to the Mushin branch of the church while he is in Somolu parish. Then, we agreed to meet on the 7th of January 2017 which we did at No 96, Apata Street, off Oguntolu Street, Somolu. The first time I saw Bosun, I remained perplexed! Bosun is a 19 year old undergraduate in one of Nigerian Universities!\n\nThe sign post with the name and address of the church comes out bodily while also written is the branch known as ‘Solution Temple’. A bungalow building stands with a wide entrance big door to usher in the faithful. Another door is on the other end of the building. In the church you have array of plastic chairs, all facing the altar known as ‘Ijuba’ where conspicuously placed is the picture of the founder which is synonymous to all the parishes and temples of Ijo Orunmila Adulawo Worldwide. At the end of the altar are the two doors that lead to the sacristy. One observation is the two doors are separated by a wall to divide the rooms into two. One for the male pastoral team, while the other one, is for the female team made up of mostly choir members. The seating arrangement of the faithful reminds one of the Vatican 1 of the Catholic Church, where men are separated from their women in seating arrangement. Another is the hymnal board hanging on one side of the wall in the church. I was amazed not to find a shrine with blood! At the back of the church, there is a bungalow built to have the priest and household. Just like a vicarage.\n\nIt may be an illusion to some that traditional religion still holds sway in the hearts and minds of Africans. But Africans still hold their allegiance to their cultural milieu. The church of Orunmila Worldwide was founded in 1934 by the revered apostle and high priest Olorunfunmi Adebanjo Oshiga. Born in 1898, but lived and died in 1943 aged 45. His life was brief, yet he left an established faith already for the faithful. Since the demise of Olorunfunmi Oshiga, the faith has grown in numbers with countless testimonies and appreciation of the Almighty by the faithful. While some were born into the faith, others came through spiritual search for God’s presence.\n\nInteresting to know are some of the visible components that have built ‘Ijo Orunmila Adulawo. Firstly, is the Liturgical process, which is similar to Christianity. The entrance and recessional hymns and order of movement are in line with the Christian order of Orthodox churches that include the act of genuflecting at the altar known as ‘Ijuba’. The pastoral team is dressed in white apparel that symbolizes purity. Secondly, the songs of the church have familiar tunes with what is obtainable in Christianity. Scored with antiphon, refrain and chorus ensemble. Thirdly, is the adherence to Yoruba language which has given the faith the sort of international recognition it has garnered so far. The quest to know about the religion and the faithful has grown into international prominence. Fourthly are the testimonies that abound in the church among the faithful. While some give testimonies on career path and job opportunities, others give on marital breakthrough and many still come to give appreciation for finding their path through the religion. And fifthly is the presence of different generation of people that abound. A bit to someone’s dismay, will surely be to see urbane- styled young people in the faith with serious devotion to what they believe in. The faith boasts of different category and class of people who have come to see Orunmila as their intercessor to God.\n\nBosun Adetayo is a faithful of Orunmila worship in the sprawling city of Lagos. Though he is not alone in this devotion, along with his sister and their mum, they join their uncle Segun Adetayo who is the parish head of Orunmila church known as ‘Solution Temple’ in Somolu, one of the bludgeoning suburbs in the city to worship God through regular mass and programs. The Somolu temple of the church is 55years old. Confidently, Bosun says, “I am a proud member of Ijo Orunmila Adulawo. I was born into this faith and I have no regrets whatsoever being part of it.”\n\nBosun seems a teetotaler but the Sister, Ifayemisi who is in her final year in a private Secondary school is the extrovert one with so much verve to talk about her decision. Ifayemisi sees the faith as a blessing to her, her family and the world in general. “In Africa, we have enough to celebrate and thank God for. The young people should stop running away from tradition. It has been more of a blessing for me. The confidence in me has grown as a faithful and in my school, some of my teachers know where I belong and they show me love and respect. I have never being embarrassed in one way or the other by my friends and schoolmates,” she reveals.\n\nBosun and Ifayemisi’s mum, Chief [Mrs] Mojisola Adetayo, joined the church in 1995 through her husband who is now deceased. “I got married to Oluwo Olorunfunmi Adetayo in 1994. We started by coming to Ijo Orunmila Adulawo once in a while. Later, when I moved finally to his house, I completed my movement into the faith. Since then, I have continued to worship with them,” she recalls. Her husband died in 2005 and in 2007, she became worried, “I thought about my staying in the faith or leave, but to God be the Glory, I am still here and part of the faith.” In 2011, Chief [Mrs] Mojisola Adetayo, was elected as ‘Mother-of-the church.’ That also drew her very close to the faith as she narrated, “I was elated and happy. I never expected it. Though, I lost my husband early, but today, I am still in the church.”\n\nThe worship most times last less than two hours in an exciting devotion to Orunmila. Odofin Adesegun Adetayo is the parish head in Somolu. His parents were integral member of the faith and he grew in it. “I started my elementary education in Gbagada area of Lagos, before proceeding to secondary school but couldn’t pass the university matriculation examination,” he confirms. He started as Altar server [Omo Awo], before, going through two more steps, Ojubona and Aro before becoming the Odofin. Adesegun Adetayo highlighted the liturgy process of Ijo Orunmila Adulawo Worldwide. “The order of proceedings goes like this – [1] Entrance hymn to the altar hymn14, [2] The blessing of the altar [3] The song of the founder, [4] The penitential act – hymn 331, [5] Prayer by kneeling process, [6]The first hymn 302, [7]Prayer of the faithful, [8] The creed is recited- profession of the faith, [9] The first Ifa verses, [10]Songs of praise, [11]The creed, [12]The second Ifa verses, [13] Songs and thanks to God hymn 261, [14]Sermon, [15] Offering, [16]Final blessings, [17]End of the service hymn 360, [18]Recession hymn 16. In any part of the world, the order is always the same,” says Odofin Adesegun Adetayo.\n\nOn the 8th of January, 2017, Odofin Adesegun was admonishing the faithful through his sermon on the significance of love and unity in marriage. He said, “It is important for trust to be the foundation of any genuine marriage. A marriage built on lies and deceits always end up in a quagmire,” he posited while making references from ‘Gege Ope’ which is the combination of Ifa verses and testaments “Every couple has a lot to learn from each other” he continues, “and one of the components of a successful marriage is having the ‘act of companionship.’ The ability to know and manage each other’s weakness is a beautiful route to a love in the air marriage,” he affirmed.\n\nThe women in Orunmila worship are referred as ‘Apetebi’ that literally means ‘Mrs,’ ‘Ms’ or ‘Miss’ and according to Taiwo Igayemi Ifayemi, “being a woman of faith in this devotion is a special blessing for the womenfolk.” She plays an integral part in the faith. In fact, she was born into it. Taiwo Igayemi is a tailor by profession, a missionary that broadcast on radio morning and night transmission. She has attended various seminars on Ifa adulation. “I am the Choir Director at the Somolu branch. To join the choir and become a chorister is not an easy task. There is a special attention to detail. From the hymns, antiphons, chorus and refrain, everything is scored.” she affirms, as she talks about the impact of women in Orunmila worship, “Women play important role in this church. Firstly, we make the world go round. We are mothers with curious minds to guide and lead the right path. Women play major roles in winning converts for Orunmila. Our missionary work is highly commendable.”\n\nTestimonies abound from the faithful and each one of them would confirm the presence of true worship in their lives. Apetebi Aina Adegun, work with Lagos State Security and this is her sixth year as a member of the faith. “Formerly, I was a Christian,” she explains. “I was a Christ Apostolic Church member, in fact, I was an integral part of their choir. When I met my husband, we had our introduction, then one Sunday, I asked him, “don’t you go to church?” he responded, “He always do” Then I asked him, “let us go to your church” which he obliged. As we got to church of Orunmila in Somolu, I noticed this particular chant of giving praises such as ‘Eyin Odumare!’ meaning ‘Praise the Lord’ I was scared and took to my heels. I thought they meant ‘bird of Olodumare’ I ran to my mother and explained to her my observation in this strange church. My mother too was puzzled. Eventually, I got pregnant and delivered my first baby Ayeduro Adegun. The church came and performed the naming ceremony. It became difficult for Aina to accept easily the faith into her life. She explains further, “One day I thought about it, will I be staying indoors and not attend church programs? Won’t I pray to God no more? Then I started coming gradually. My husband told me with time, I will understand the faith more.” Aina’s father in law gave her the hymn book of the church and implored her to join the faith fully. “He emphatically assured me of the thoroughness of the faith that I should endeavor to participate in the praises and responsorial chants. He used to give me his tithes to pay on his behalf. This is a schemed way of making me to be punctual.”\n\nMrs Awolumate Adesua hails from Edo State. She met her husband as a traditionalist in 2012 and they dated for 2 years before being married as a couple. “We eventually got married in 2013 and we have a son named Ifamurewa. Since we got married, we have been giving beautiful testimonies to share. Serving Ifa is good and full of countless graces that I couldn’t ask for more. She recalls the time she introduced her fiancé to her family, “I told them he is a traditionalist. My family members were surprised and asked what I meant? I know even in my place in Edo State, we have so many of such traditional faith and religion, though some different from Orunmila. I am from a Christian background but I found love and joy in Orunmila worship. I was allowed to marry him, since it is a decision and path I have chosen.\n\nPresently, Chief Ifagbemi Adedotun Ifajobi is the Supreme Leader and Chief priest of Ijo Orunmila Adulawo Worldwide. In a chance encounter at the ‘New Year’ appreciation held at ‘Eji Elemere Temple, Mushin, he gave a good account of the essence of divine and true worship to God. Speaking further, “We have parishes, provinces, diocesan councils scattered all over the world. In Lagos, we have 9 to 10 parishes. In Ogun State, we have about 30 parishes. We have churches in Cotonou-Benin Republic, in Ghana likewise Porto Novo, California USA and other major cities of the world. My parents gave birth to me in this faith and I was reliably informed the church anchored the naming ceremony and ever since, I have been part of the church movement.” The high priest also lampooned the rejection of African religion and cultures, believing both western and traditional religion all work for the good. He remarks, “We know among the people of black origin, there are many lost souls. The western civilization and incursion into our culture actually tampered with many of our cherished traditions and heritage. Though they did so well by introducing western education into our society, nevertheless, they shouldn’t have made it to rubbish our culture, tradition and religion. All what God the Supreme Being gave us as gifts to relish have been tampered with by brainwashing our people. Many have been deceived that God does not answer prayers through traditional worship.”\n\nFor Omoyemi Banjo, a Mathematics student of the University of Lagos, Orunmila worship has really made her to grow in confidence and show how gullible one can be, if one continues to tag along with everyone without being conscious to know where someone belongs. She is one those many youths in the youth wing of the church and who are adhering to the tenets of Orunmila worship. Just like Bosun and Ifayemisi, Omoyemisi was born into the faith and vowed never to leave. In her words, “Orunmila gives me anything I ask for, then why should I leave?” she asked.\n\nOdofin Adetayo and High Priest Fagbemi keep giving their assurances that when you join Orunmila church, believe that whatever your problems are, you have found the solution here. Odofin Adesegun posits, “In the church of Orunmila, we do not discriminate against other faith. We give mutual respect to other faith in existence just as we expect them to do the same to us, as we promote love unity and peace in our religion which is one of our tenets. While the High Priest Fagbemi opines, “I employ and appeal to everyone, let us go back to what we know. The stakeholders in films, music and theatre have exploited our traditional worship for their career and personal gains, yet they are very far away from the worship. Our traditional worship shouldn’t be neglected because every civilization has its foundation process, as Ifa is the word and remains universal.”\n\nApetebi Taiwo Igayemi whose sonorous voice resonates the songs of worship to ecstasy shares the benefit of the devotion from her own testimony, “I have received bountiful graces from this faith. My life is a testimony. Ifa gives life. While Mrs Mojisola Adetayo says she fears no foe.” Once I say my prayers, I know God answers through Ijo Orunmila Adulawo. I advise women, maybe you are a widow, come to God of Orunmila. The church of Orunmila is the husband of widows. If you feel you are barren, come don’t be afraid. In the beginning, I also thought it was a place for sacrifice here and there with all sorts but I was wrong. Hand over your life and you will see the joy beneath. There is hope in Orunmila church.” Aina Adegun said one unique component she observed is the love that bound the faith. She continues, “In my neighbourhood where I live, once I get prepared to go to church, my neighbours make obscene gestures at me, calling me a witch. They always take to their heels. To be candid, none of my neighbours at No 54 Odunsi Street, Somolu attended the naming ceremony of my two children. They went about calling us witches. But when they started glancing at the performative rites of naming ceremony, they were astonished and started gathering. It was a marvel to behold. She also testified that some of them have started sneaking into Orunmila church through the back door seeking solutions to their problems. “Since I joined this faith, I have become one of the happiest people on earth. In the church of Orunmila, they have never asked me to bring anything living or dead for sacrifice. Six years down the line, I have no regrets whatsoever of joining this faith,” she concludes.\n\nWords Ireho Aito\n\nImages Ireho Aito\n\nPosted by ireho aito at 07:54 No comments:\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\n//e.issuu.com/embed.js\n\nPosted by ireho aito at 07:46 No comments:\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nMonday, 21 August 2017\n\nFemi Kehinde|The Kingsman\n\nFemi Kehinde|The Kingsman\n\nLauded historian, author, lawyer and politician, Hon. Femi Kehinde is one Avant garde,away from the usual ceremonies of noise, his book ‘Of Rusts and Gold: Snippets of History’ is a comprehensive account about our history, culture, education and our lost values and of course politics.\n\nWrites Aito Ireho\n\nFemi Kehinde is a rare gem. He is one of the very few distinct personalities still living on the planet earth, yet nursing that grave concerns about lack of adequate historical revelations and documentations of events that sharpened our thoughts and behavioural patterns through literature and films. How many of his generation can gather so many economists, scholars, politicians, technocrats, monarchs, different generation and class of people under one roof for a book launch? The reason he is a sheer class. Class, indeed in Femi Kehinde cannot be bought with money; rather, it comes as a grace. How many Nigerian lawmakers know about our chequered history? Or, still remember our heroes past? More so, he has thrown a challenge to our new generation of writers and historiansabout what they write for the people to read in thisjunk and blog gist’s literature era.\n\nThe 10th of July, 2017 will go down in history, as a day set aside to honour a worthy one through literature and recitations. ‘Samuel Ladoke Akintola: In the Eyes of History.’ A book written by revered historical writer, Mr Femi Kehinde at the Michael Omolayole Hall, International Conference Center, University of Ibadan. Dignitaries of different ages were in attendance. Chairman of the occasion was Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, and the roll call included special guest of honour, Oba Adedokun Abolarin, the Orangun of Oke-Ila, Osun State, publisher, Elder Akin Ogunbiyi of Akosa Publisher Ltd and Chairman of Mutual Benefits Assurance Plc. The guest speaker was Bashorun Dele Momodu, Ovation publisher and seasoned writer, while the book reviewer was Dr Festus Adedayo, Member of the board, Tribune Newspapers. Chief Richard Akinjide, SLA family members and close associates were in attendance. What a spectacle!\n\nThis is not his first book, neither his first work. Femi Kehinde, an accomplished lawyer has done it all and still exhumes ambitious adrenalin in him. My first encounter with him came at a time I started working on notable and distinguished Nigerians for my documentary series “Movers and Shakers” and my associate producer Segun Adedokun asked me to read a certain article on Vanguard online, written about one extraordinary Nigerian industrialist and Africa’s earliest entrepreneur, Sanusi Adebisi Giwa. The article was entitled, “Sanusi Adebisi Idikan- (1882 – 1938) first Ibadan notable entrepreneur and philanthropist.” I decided to go through it and I was amazed by the level of research that threw me off guard. It was indeed an articulated story.I wasn’t in a rush to read it all over as the writer’s use of English was lucid to feel and enjoy. History was placed on my table easily by the writer. Every aspect of the protagonist life and style was detailed. His odyssey and foray in commerce and business were well researched. Sanusi Adebisi’s philanthropy, his hallmark remained distinct and unrivalled. At a time getting to read about the author became a beautiful mission and at the end of the ‘masterpiece’ I saw the name and designation; Hon (Barr.) Femi Kehinde,Former Member,House of Representatives,National Assembly,Abuja, Representing, Ayedire/Iwo/Ola-Oluwa Federal Constituency, of Osun State- 1999-2003.I became so much interested in meeting him.It was looking though a very difficult mission but that eventually came to fruition when I placed a phone call to a veteran journalist and erudite writer himself, Dr. Festus Adedayo, who facilitated my meeting the ‘celeb’ of course at the moment in the city of Ibadan in Oyo State.\n\nMemorable Encounter\n\nOn the 4th of June, 2017, I met the literati, one on one at ‘Handler’ hotel in Oluyole Estate, a middle class neighbourhood in the ancient city, as he strolled in before the downpour that almost outshined our meeting in a gold traditional kaftan.Dr Festus Adedayo, Segun Adedokun, Mrs Iretiogo Bilesanmi, the granddaughter of the protagonist and her husband, Yinka were also in attendance as I took him on as a ‘talking head’ in the yet to be released documentary project. His presence is as captivating as he recounts his odyssey as a young man, educational sojourn, career path and his mission statement. One reflecting moment is, he is so passionate about the preservation of history and culture and instead of him lamenting just like many of his peers,and he has decided not to drop his passion for writing history. Rather, the ink from his pen must continue to write and celebrate our heroes. During the interview, Femi Kehinde took us on a roller coaster, telling us more about what we should know about the protagonist, Sanusi Adebisi, in a recount that looks as if he grew up with him. It was incredible!\n\nFormative Years\n\nThe Honourable was born on the 3rd of November, 1959 to Samuel and Elizabeth Kehinde. His father was a nomadic Police Officer which made him a traveling pupil in his elementary school education. He rounded up his elementary school voyage at Saint Paul’s Primary School, Gbongan in 1972. Femi Kehinde later went to Origbo Community High School, Ipetumodu, January 1973 – July, 1977, then moved to Ibadan polytechnic for his ‘A Levels Basic Studies’ between 1977 – 1978 from where he gained admission to read Law at the prestigious University of Ife renamed Obafemi Awolowo University from 1978 to 1983 and bagged an LL.B Hons Degree, though with a brief period spent at the Department of History in the same school. After his stint at Nigerian Law School, he was called to the Bar on the 16th ofAugust,1984. The Law firm, Obafemi Awolowo & Co [Barristers Solicitors] Park Lane Apapa, Lagos will be his next destination where he had a pupilage law practice between June and October, 1984, with one more firm, Fawole Babalakin and Co, Oke-Ado, Ibadan, he soldiered on to establish his law firm, Femi Kehinde&Co in October 1985 and has remained a Principal Partner.\n\n‘Of Rusts and Gold: Snippets of History’\n\nFemi Kehinde is a multitasking personality; in fact, he is a colossus to behold in literature. I was honoured when he gave me one of his autographed published works entitled ‘Of Rusts and Gold: Snippets of History’ a 2016 paperback 249 page publication, and a spectacular release that opened my eyes to know more about the historical firmaments of Yoruba cultural and political history of Nigeria as a whole. Also, included are essays on contemporary Nigerian politics, the entrepreneurial efforts and dynamism of our earliest entrepreneurs and industrialists. “I always find my way to make this work,”he says. “I go through my research thoroughly, before notifying each family of my intention and they always give me their support,” he recalls at our encounter at his Oluwalogbon Motors Chambers in Ikeja. “Chief Richard Akinjide once asked me, “how old are you?” he recalls. Chief Richard Akinjide, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria and one of Nigeria’s earliest practicing lawyers, alongside Chief Remilekun Fani-Kayode and Chief Bode Thomas, was a witness of history and a privy to some of the research compilations by the author, became astonished by the enormous dedication the writer, has given to do all these. The elderly lawyer sees Femi Kehinde as a phenomenon!\n\n‘Of Rusts and Gold: Snippets of History’ is a book that opened up our ‘lost account,’ and Femi Kehinde’s historical writing skill is like a flowing stream that found the legs of a man lost in the desert. This is abook written in precise and concise account with clear comprehension that draws the stories to the reader’s heart.\n\nMonarchs, grandeur and travails\n\nThe lawyer cum literati delves into the grandeur and travails of our monarchical systems that was accustomed with a God-like and mystified attributes. The politics of coronation and depose among monarchs in Yoruba land were exposed in a detailed account of how they happened. The Chief Bode Thomas and Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Adeniran Adeyemi II drama in, 1953 would have looked more like a fairytale to the young readers today. It was a historical account that was underreported and very difficult to find from some of our available libraries, but the writer did justice to it. The intrigues of Oni of Ife stool and Olowo of Owo mysterious double reigns and others make the book a literature classic!\n\nPolitics, Politicians and Concrete Jungle\n\nModern students of history may find it difficult to embark on such literature mission like Hon Femi Kehinde did due to lack of financial support and grants. Today, our ‘plastic’ cultures may surely not give them enough opportunities to walk on. Nigeria’s founding fathers would be so pleased with the writer for his literature voyage to unravel the road to freedom and the betrayals afterwards. From his account of history, the author deserves Man Booker or Nobel literature prize recognition. Old political actors, some gone, few still alive knew he wasn’t far from the truth in his fact findings, if they check through his examination of conscience that he revealed in the book, as most times, personal interests overshadowed national interests and to some extent, spouses got themselves involved in the “battle creek brawl.”\n\n‘Qui Bono’ Education and the decline in Statesmanship\n\nQui Bono? For whose interest? The writer seems to be asking a question and begging for answer from some political actors who derailed in their promises during electioneering campaign. It seems they keep losing their confidence as soon as they attain power and care no more about the electorate. They easily jettison the ‘consent of the governed’ according to John Locke. The free education policies of some of the old political actors have been thrown into a waste bag and it is obvious education and the legacy of the founding fathers plays no role in their stewardship. Current school reforms are nose-dived ones and making the system to be experiencing a downward trend. The author himself, being a product of western region educational policy and largesse laments the current situation being experience in the country, particularly, his home state.\n\nEarly Entrepreneurs, businessmen and writers\n\nNames such as Sanusi Adebisi, Salami Agbaje, D.O.Fagunwa, Obisesan, the Odutola brothers, Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu, Chief Theophilus Oni, Alhassan Dantata, Esan Da Rocha and others early entrepreneurs, writers, authors and educationists were given special tribute on their contribution to economic and educational development of Nigeria. When Hon. Femi Kehinde was given the commentary on Sanusi Adebisi Giwa in a forth coming documentary, the grand-daughter of the protagonist, Iretiogo Bilesanmi was also awestruck, as the historian narratives were entirely new to her. She couldn’t hide her admiration of the writer and she comments, “in fact, my father didn’t know some of these revelations, I am honoured to meet Hon Femi Kehinde, he is one unique personality.”\n\nHonourable Femi Kehinde is a quintessential gentleman who lives on Law as a profession and not politics with a vast experience in law practice spanning over 30 years. He started his political career as a grassroots politician,and at aged 27, he contested for the Local Government Councillorship in an independent election in 1987 and won. He believes in collective governance and currently vying for the top job in Osun State as the governor in 2018. A mission he says, is to impact positively on the lives of his people so that the “Living Spring will Flow Again.”\n\nPosted by ireho aito at 07:07 No comments:\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nTuesday, 8 August 2017\n\nSelma and Ake|Two Realities, Thoughtful Overcomers.\n\nSelma and Ake|Two Realities, Thoughtful Overcomers.\n\nIn 1964, Dr Martin Luther King of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] accepts his Nobel Peace Prize. Four African-American girls are shown walking down the stairs of the 16th Street Baptist Church, until an explosion kills them.From the rolling stones of Abeokuta, south western part of Nigeria is a very interesting story of a boy that later metamorphosed and turned into a global reckoning through literature.\n\nSelma is a 2014 historical drama film directed by Ava DuVernay and written by Paul Webb. It is based on the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches led by James Bevel, Hosea Williams, and Martin Luther King Jr and John Lewis.\n\nThe film stars actors David Oyelowo as King, Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B Johnson, Tim Roth as George Wallace, Carmen Egogo as Coretta Scott King and rapper and actor, Common as Bevel.\n\nIn 1964, Dr Martin Luther King of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] accepts his Nobel Peace Prize. Four African-American girls are shown walking down the stairs of the 16th Street Baptist Church, until an explosion kills them. The director of the film, Ava DuVernay had to write new Martin Luther King adlib, due to copyright infringement from Martin Luther King publishing estate. Yet, there was, well told and projected into the realities of today’s America. In Selma, Ava DuVernay proved to the world she is more than just a filmmaker, but history maker that is full of authentic accounts.\n\nHer zeal and commitment coupled with the rest of the cast and crew made Selma, the most anticipated film of modern era. Ava sweated, toiled but never screamed her brain off, rather, she was able to pull through by encouraging others not to drop or stop. Even when pundits felt the film was robbed of some of the most important awards, an opinion that went viral and almost again torn America apart, in terms of the colours of the academic judges, through that period, Ava remained a calm figure and played the role of an American mother for everyone, “you win some, you lose some, but spread the message. The awards would always come all the time.”\n\nIn Selma Alabama, Annie Lee Cooper, attempt to register to vote, but is prevented by the white registrars.\n\nKing meets president Johnson asking for federal legislation to allow black citizens to register to vote unencumbered. Johnson says he has more important projects.\n\nOne thing about Selma is the apt timing of his release. America has been going through racial upheavals in the last two years and the racial rights turned into vociferous confrontations with the killings of African-Americans by police that are supposedly whites, though, most times, lay claims to self-defense.\n\nThe film eventually won Best Picture, Best Original Song for film done by Rapper and activist Common and John Legend at the 2015 Oscars Awards in Los Angeles. Selma has proved more than success with the box office gross income records. Maybe award for the best actor and director respectively may have eluded the film, the reality has been established and the message behind the story will continue to go from one generation to the next about some group of people who defile all odds and damn the consequence of the law to fight for their rights which could only be achieved while still alive.\n\nThe politics of producing the film also reared its ugly head when production eggheads found it difficult to agree on the production director. The director only had half a dozen of film credits mostly documentaries and more of a marketing executive in the film industry, but the Sundance film best documentary film winner Ava DuVernay remain unperturbed, as she knew this was her chance. She wasoffered a budget up to 20million dollars and Selma saw the light. She was able to overcome the power play of top film executives on the film.\n\nThe film achieved what propaganda sponsored films couldn’t achieve by opening America’s eyes to the true story about America. It has also been able to reawake every race, colour or religion of their socio-political responsibilities to America.\n\nFrom the rolling stones of Abeokuta, south western part of Nigeria is a very interesting story of a boy that later metamorphosed and turned into a global reckoning through literature. The story of Ake is one of the childhood stories that replete Africa and Africans, yet, still don’t get to the public space, due to lack of proper documentation of our people, heroes, leaders, icons and many more. Cultural policies have always been adduced as the cause of the lack of respect for one another.\n\nDapoAdeniyi, a Nigerian born journalist, writer, publisher and filmmaker has given the world everything about the thespian who is a colossus in the literary world. “Professor Wole Soyinka has been a familiar father to me way back” the founder of Position magazine, a quarterly publication that celebrates the contemporary arts in Africa explains.\n\nA walk through the one storey building that houses DapoAdeniyi and his Production Company has its walls decorated with many of Wole Soyinka’s unseen pictures and archives. What closeness! One seems to ask?\n\nThe idea for this film originally started in 1988, after the much celebrated adaptation of Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart in 1986. The national television wanted to celebrate Kongi, as he is popularly known, owning to the fact that he had just won the Nobel Prize for Literature. In DapoAdeniyi’s words,“the laureate was asked to choose his writer and he recommended me to handle the story. This I did without hesitating on the project, but due to the bureaucratic bottlenecks in the system at that time, the adaption couldn’t see the light of the day.”\n\nThe writer and publisher who is also a Prince Claus Fund recipient, had gone ahead to release a critical acclaimed documentary on Wole Soyinka entitled ‘Time Voyager’, exposing the activism and public commentaries and muse of the acclaimed playwright who is known as a public intellectual.\n\nThe trailer of the epic production of Ake, the film adaptation of the world-famous childhood memoir by Wole Soyinka, the first Black winner of the Nobel Prize for literature with the same title has finally been released and has gone viral on social media with criticisms as expected coming so fast.\n\nThe film fulfills many of its pre-production promises, of producing a film that stands up to the quality and global status of the original book, with which the film now stands as a companion piece.\n\nSet in the late 1930s up to the middle of the 1940s when World War II ended, the film captures the period very well by taking us right back in time. The usual elements that illustrate this period include the “set props” among which are the period’s automobiles and locomotive railway services as well as the defining coastal architecture and other forms of visual design.\n\n“We couldn’t see the original house of the Soyinkas’ as it was long gone, revealed DapoAdeniyi.But the Nobel Laureate was able to show us where the house was situated and we decided to do the production recce for a location.”\n\nContemporary Afro- pop musician, Yinka Davies comes across as the stalwart figure of the historical Mrs. Ransome-Kuti, the leader of the Egba-Yoruba women’s riots of 1945 that stood up against poll taxation on women and eventually routed the powerful Yoruba monarch, the Alake of Egbaland.\n\nWole Soyinka is a descendant of the vocal, powerful Yoruba elite, scions of early recipients of British education dispensed by institutions administered by the Church Missionary Service (the CMS). Intellectual and educational privilege empowered the local Egba elite to rise up, mobilizing both the peasant and educated classes across the genders, against the right-wing aristocracy which amassed both commercial and political power and functioned as an oppressive instrument that was actively assisted by the colonial establishment.\n\nMrs. Ransome-Kuti who led the rebellion was both the aunt of the writer/ activist. She was also the mother of the late pop-music star FelaKuti, whose music continues in a similar fashion of activist engagement.\n\nIt is gladdening to find that Mrs. Kuti’s granddaughter and Fela’s own elder daughter (a musician and a choreographer in her own right) YeniAnikulapo-Kuti, stars in the movie, donning the costumes and the character of Mrs. Odufuwa, the pretty and fashionable wife of Wole’s uncle whom the young Wole dreamed would be his own future wife!\n\nOther prominent acts in the film are JimiSolanke, the well-known actor and longstanding friend/ associate of Soyinka. Solanke, as Pa Adatan, brings much gravitas to the production in the style of his performances in Wole Soyinka’s stage productions over the years.\n\nMrs. TaiwoAjai-Lycett, OON, . a British trained actress with commendable appearances in the 1970s ‘Hanging with Mr. Cooper’ one of Britain’s acclaimed comedy television series, features as the very outspoken Egba woman leader who leads the march on the Alake’s palace across the streets of Abeokuta and also delivers the volcanic speech denouncing all forms of taxation on the Egba womanhood.\n\nChief Festus AdegboyeOnigbinde, former National Coach of Nigeria’s Super Eagles, play as the grandfather of Fela, Rev. J. J. Ransome-Kuti, who roars back to life in Wild Christian’s moonlight tale, which is well told by no less than LanikeOnimisi-Bennett, who plays the part of Wole’s mother.\n\nOther major appearances are ToyinAbiodun (Rev I.O RansomeKuti), GbengaAjiboye (Essay, Father of Wole), Wale Adebayo (Spirit man; he also took the lead role in a former epic screenplay “Sango” produced by Femi Lasode under the aegis of the Even Ezra Studios), Hafiz Oyetoro (with the outstanding comic part of “Myself” or “Mr. Latinwo”). YemiSolade (Broda Pupa) and BayoBankole (familiar from the television sitcom Papa Ajasco).Bankole plays the role of the recalcitrant student of Abeokuta Grammar School (AGS) who leads the conspiracy to steal a fowl belonging to Mrs. Ransome-Kuti.\n\nThe children of Ake are perhaps the production’s greatest boon. All the child-actors playing Wole at different age-grades bear very fascinating and pleasant resonances of the actual Wole. Their grasp of lines is crispy and very convincing.\n\nThe film’s director, DapoAdeniyi, says ample care is taken to show that Wole grew out of a very enlightened home background but clearly with no claim to wealth. That is the reason why the set of the Soyinka home and that of the school at the St. Peter’s primary school, Ake, where his father was the headmaster, are not extravagant but simple and intense. This view, he says, is complemented by actual photographs of Wole Soyinka’s early life and of his close relatives. Besides, the lesson the director wants to pass across is that anyone can rise to significance, regardless of how humble their background may have been.\n\nEven from the trailer, there is evidence of the biased portrayal of period architecture, particularly townhouses influenced by the Brazilian masonry that swept the Southern Nigerian coastline following the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nDapoAdeniyi was asked if the Professor has seen the works and what were his comments, DapoAdeniyi opened up, “yes he has seen the film, but he warned us not to ask for his comments.”\n\nIrehoAito\n\nPictures/Backpage productions\n\nPosted by ireho aito at 04:26 No comments:\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nMoses Oghagbon| The Journey Through Argungun\n\nMoses Oghagbon| The Journey Through Argungun\n\nMoses Oghagbon is the only one who could have done it, in a seriesof exhibition suitable for thisculturally blend society with ‘plastic’s and cosmetic’s culture.’ Moses Oghagbon documents Argungun and its exciting fishing festival in attractive colours.\n\nMoses Oghagbon is the star of his time and automatically, the best among them. His ‘Argungun Series’ exhibition is on its sixth voyage as the fantastic documentary auteur has showcased the series at Lagos TerraKulture in 2013, the second and third series were held at Moorhouse Lagos in 2016 while the fourth and fifth took place at Kanta Museum, Argungun in 2017. Moses quest for originality has defined him as a force to reckon with in Nigeria and beyond. The ‘Argungun Series’ has put the forward thinking artist in a class of his own, making it his identity.In his words, “Argungun Series is an idea borne out of my tour of the Nigeria project. There is the need to encounter positive propagation and promotion of the rich culture and artistic heritage of Argungun Emirates of Kebbi, Nigeria.” His visual compilation of Argungun and the fishing festival have made him to move a step ahead of his peers, since he decided to opt out of the box.What has stood Moses out in his exhibition series is each exhibition, so far, has been staged with different artworks in all the venues. What an incredible feat! An achievement that is very rare to beat. He is a game changer, which has made him the face of Argungun in visual colours. One thing about Moses is the power of being focus.\n\nI rememberbefore my departure to Sokoto on a cold, cloudy, Wednesday morning inJuly 2009 with ‘Coach’ or ‘Oga Ibrahim,’ a senior colleague of mine while working for a production company in Lagos, on an assignment for a media and campaign promotion of a beverage brand, my Parish Priest had admonished us in his evening mass homily on Tuesday, the power of patience, courage and passion. He told us to always be prepared to ‘eat the venom first before the honey.’ We should learn to endure the test period of life but never to give up on our aspirations, because good things don’t always come easy. The Reverend Father took us through the story of Moses, regaling us with the Book of Exodus, Pharaohand Children of Israel for us to ponder. His homily was lucid and self-explanatory, I couldn’t ask for more. One good thing is to stay focus and never to be unbalanced.\n\nBy 6.am the next morning, I was at Iddo Park in Lagos with ‘Coach’ getting set for a journey to Sokoto and [3] other Northern States in Nigeria. We were ushered into a Peugeot car, a wagon to be précised and one Sokoto bred, tall man joined us, smoking his hot cigarette to chill, while four college graduates, two ladies and two guys respectively, also joined on the same mission for their National Youth Service Program in Kebbi State. The driver, an Ilorin native, Kwara State talkative, was all over the park, boasting about his conquest on women to his other colleagues which later proved to be his weakness as we drove out of Lagos.\n\nAs we sped off from the park, every one of us started calling our loved ones that we are off. But the college graduates on a mission to serve their fatherland were somehow dejected and started bemoaning their fate concerning the posting. They lacked the courage and patience to travel down Birnin-Kebbi. For them, it was helluva of a journey, but for me and ‘coach’, it was passion now putting food on our table.\n\nFunny questions were being thrown our way by the fresh graduates about the northern part of Nigeria, since they are ‘aliens’ to such trips and places. They really wanted to know about meningitis and tsetse flies. One of the ladies wanted to know how big the flies in the north are. She wanted to know about whopping cough. ‘Coach’and the ‘Sokoto’ man debunked all the false assertions, rather, they encouraged them to learn and know more about the country they dwell in. They should see the posting as a call to serve their fatherland and make tourist adventures out of Kebbi State. ‘Coach’ later asked them if they have ever heard of Argungun fishing festival from Kebbi State. They all chorused, Argungun what?!!!\n\nNigerian born painter, culture connoisseur and documentary auteur, Moses Oghagbon, is indeed a genuine artist. He delves into epic form of his vocation that looks too dangerous for his contemporaries. Moses memories of Argungun stems from the fact that he had his compulsory one year mandatory posting of the National Youth Service Scheme in Kebbi State, where one of Africa’s fishing festivals is being held annually. Argungun town and the fishing festival have both enjoyed international presence, drawing tourists, international mediaand culture purists to the town. The joy of Argungun on the face of the people and their love for what is originally theirs cannot be underestimated.\n\nMoses Oghagbon graduated from the prestigious Federal Polytechnic Yaba, Lagos State, Nigeria. This is one school that has given Africa an endless list of Art and Culture professionals. It is a school whose academic presence and records soar beyond the shores of Nigeria and Moses is one of the well horned products of the school. A walk around his studio in Ipaja end of Lagos will surely give a clue that the dude of an artist has his mind in one place. He unleashes quality collections that are not just bogus drawings, instead creations that are explanatory in style.\n\nArgungun is inhabited by the Kabawa people. It is a town by the bank of the river Rima and was said not to have been affected by the Fulani jihad. Thus, when the then Sultan of Sokoto, Mallam Dan Mu’azu, visited the place on a friendly term, the people gave him a grand reception which featured among other things, the Argungun festival. And this marked the origin of the festival which has become the most significant identity of the town.\n\nThe entire festival spans four days and features agricultural shows, bike racing archery and others. It is a seasonal festival usually celebrated between late February and early March. The ceremony is opened with a moving cultural dance and a performance by praise singers. Groups from different emirates present their dances to commemorate the festival. The Kabano which comes up on the third day is a water event of bare hand fishing with no sex discrimination. It also features activities like people rowing their canoes, water rescue techniques, as well as, men swimming with pots balanced on their heads.\n\nThe grand fishing festivity is, of course, the concluding aspect of the Argungun festival. As the name implies, it is a fishing contest. The fishing side is called ‘Matan Feda’. Rituals are made. Dignitaries, including the Sultan, take their seats after which the trumpet for the commencement of the competition is sounded. This is followed by the excitement and rush of the competitors into the small body of water in their eagerness to be winners.Fishermen, with their net gourds, drive into the water striving to catch the biggest fish of the day. Each catch is weighed and tagged in the presence of the spectators who clap and cheer the fishermen whose nerves are cooled by the soothing music of the Kalangu minstrels in canoes.\n\nAs we got to Jebba and drove over the Niger Bridge, we alerted the ‘Corps members’ of the famous River Niger and they all jumped off from their scattered sleeping postures, despite the exhaustion on their faces, due to the long journey. Gleefully, they were back to life staring at one of the longest rivers in Africa. The ‘Coach’ reminded them of Mr Bako and his family vacation nationwide traveling expedition in the famous NOEC English text way back. They were also able to see the mausoleum of Mungo Park, the white expeditioner that discovered the source of the river. But again, the driver started his phone-call endless interruptions and disturbing the journey with numerous lies and fantasies of escapades with women that has started becoming too boring for us. “A long drive still awaits us guys”, Oga Ibrahim quips and the guys moan themselves back to sleep. One of them even gush, “This country is too big to be one!”\n\nThe oneness that Argungun fishing festival brings to its people, community, tourists and the world over makes it a unique festival among all. The contest is not a do or die affair, rather, it promotes healthy rivalry, spirit of sportsmanship and unity in state-building as demonstrated by Moses Oghagbon in his many creations. In sweeping strokes, he painted the town and its festival in vivid, bold and rapid colours. In fact, the artist captured the joy, hazards, painstaking moments, sober looks of losers, happiness of winners, nets-mending contestants, crowd yelling to support their own, dance and music known for the festival, hallmark of labour, hard work, energy, beauty, emotions, reactions, moments, hues and cries of the game. The ballyhoo that characterizes the festival was captured by the great Moses whose memories of the event brought the festival closer to Nigerians on canvas.He saw just beyond a town and its historic festival, rather, Moses did a yeoman’s job by reawakening our consciousness to the great diamond of tourism, a wealth in our hands but we blindly refused to see.\n\nThe Kabawa people of Argungun Local Government Area of Kebbi State will be so proud of Moses Oghagbon for the wonderful mastery and documentation of their culture andfestival to promote cultural integration among Nigerians, Africans and the world at large.\n\nAs if the rhetoric of cultural integration really made any sense to some of my co-travelers. Not until when we got to Birnin – Kebbi, we discovered our supposedly professional driver who was full of self-elation was also very tired of the journey. His energy got dissipated so fast for a journey of a 12 hour drive to Sokoto. We were woken up from our unconscious nature when the loquacious man of the road couldn’t control his steering wheel any longer. Twice, he swerved off his lane, and then already in the dark, he wasted our time and messed up our scheduled time of getting to our destination. As for my fellow travelers…, some were seriously snoring. The driver had no choice but to concur to nature and started appealing why he wouldn’t want to go farther. “I am somehow tired o” we heard him spoke in his Ilorin accented Yoruba language. But a decision that was unacceptable for me, ‘coach’ and the Sokoto indigene. “I will get you people another vehicle that will take you to Sokoto”, he begged. “Then what about this corps members? ‘Coach’ asked. “I will take them to the nearest destination to their orientation camp site”, he explained, as he begged to be relieved of his duty.\n\nThe ‘corps members’ never got to see Argungun which was another 90 minutes’ drive to Sokoto as they found themselves in a lurch. One of them moaned behind me as they were alighting from the car, “I won’t come here again after this orientation exercise, I promised myself” he grunted.\n\nMoses Oghagbon got to Birnin – Kebbi, served in Argungun and participated in Argungun festival as a tourist. Today, his compelling visual story is a beautiful ride for anyone to embark, to see Argungun town and its fishing festival.Moses incredible composure, organised values, patience and well documented mind brought glory and colour to his doorsteps. He didn’t give up on his journey; rather, he saw to the end and finally got to his destination without musing over the stretch. He stayed focus. His effort will surely be appealing in a coffee book in the future.\n\nOnly three of us now, myself, ‘coach’ and the Sokoto man embarked on another 90 minutes’ drive to Sokoto. We drove through the famous town Argungun unnoticed, simply, because the vehicle that we later embarked on, had no headlights on! Scenarios as such were no stranger to us again, when we considered the torrid journey we just escaped from earlier. Our new driver was so brave on the road. ‘Coach’, myself and the Sokoto man asked few questions about our safety on the road with no headlight on, the driver only giggled and muttered to us in Hausa language, “walahi ba wahala, Allah kiaye”meaning ‘believe me, no problems. Journey mercies.’ We got to Sokoto BusPark about 2am the next morning!\n\nMoses Oghagbon “Argungun in Colours” the sixth edition comes up in September in the city of Kano.\n\nWords/Ireho Aito\n\nArtworks/ Moses Oghagbon\n\nPosted by ireho aito at 04:03 No comments:\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nOlder Posts Home\n\nSubscribe to: Posts (Atom)\n\nTotal Pageviews\n\n2,239\n\nAfrica Walking Magazine\n\nDon’t Keep Your Art in the Finger!\n\nFollow by Email\n\nTranslate\n\nPowered by Translate\n\nFollow by Email\n\nAfrica Walking Magazine\n\nDon’t Keep Your Art in the Finger!\n\nSearch This Blog\n\nafricawalkingmagazine\n\nFeatured post\n\nIjo Orunmila Adulawo|There is Worship in the City\n\nIn an urban-culture city of Lagos, inhabited by diverse worship and faith, Ijo Orunmila Adulawo Worldwide faithful worship with songs, …\n\nBlog Archive\n\n▼ 2017 (26)\n\n▼ August (5)\n\nIjo Orunmila Adulawo|There is Worship in the City\n\n<div data-configid=”30606249/51699931″ style=”widt…\n\nFemi Kehinde|The Kingsman\n\nSelma and Ake|Two Realities, Thoughtful Overcomers…\n\nMoses Oghagbon| The Journey Through Argungun\n\n► July (5)\n\n► June (4)\n\n► May (9)\n\n► March (3)\n\nAbout Me"
