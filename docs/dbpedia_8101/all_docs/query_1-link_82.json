        "text": "interview\n\nNigerian education sector had experienced fluctuating fortunes since independence in 1960, passing through ups and downs, recording different aspects of achievements and challenges.\n\nEducation ordinarily is seen as the pivot for success in any human endeavour. The basis of any concrete development whether in science, technology, arts, economy, communication, medicine, engineering or manufacturing is education.\n\nEven the struggle for independence was as a result of exposure to education, especially Western type, prompting the nationalists to challenge British colonialsm. Dr. Karo Igbinaka, a lecturer in the philosophy Department, Faculty of Arts, University of Lagos and also Chairman, UNILAG - ASUU, in this interview with Saturday Vanguard assessed the development of Nigerian education system in the past decades and how we came to the present situation.\n\nWithout any gainsaying, education seemed neglected, thrown to the rear as pursuit of money, materialism, fame have taken over. Government is not helping matters with its careless attitude to education and the products of our education system without employment.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nWhat is your assessment of Nigerian education so far?\n\nNew teachers, new friends, new shoes, new notebooks, and sometimes, a new school. There are surely 'new' worries on both side of the divide as children return to the classroom after a long break,Taiwo Akintunde writes about challenges of parents and school administrators as children return to the classroom this week\n\nMost teachers at Nigeria's elementary and high schools are extra busy this week. They are busy studying their new students. They will interact less with the chalk board and put their gaze on their pupils. It is not different for the pupils too. They are busy checking out their new teacher, new friend and the class where they are now.\n\nThe special visitation panel set up by the Federal Government in July to investigate the activities of University of Abuja since its establishment has described the institution as a mockery of the university system.\n\nPresenting the panel's report to the Minister of Education, Prof. Ruqayyatu Rufa'i on Friday in Abuja, the chairman of the panel, Dr Theo Osanakpo, blamed the under development of the university on poor governance system and financial impropriety.\n\nOsanakpo said the report indicated that the 2025 target set for the completion of the full master plan of the university might not be realised as only six per cent of the plan had been achieved after 24 years.\n\nHe identified ranking of unapproved programmes, admission irregularities, lack of a governance system and lack of a proper accounting procedures as major challenges facing the institution.\n\n\"He gave it for his opinion, that whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind , and do more essential service to his country than the whole race of politicians put together\". Jonathan Swift, I667-I745, in Gulliver's Travels.\n\nWho among those of us fortunate to have attended real secondary schools in the I930s to I960s can possibly forget that absolutely delightful book by Swift - one of the world's greatest master-pieces of all time; ranking with the likes of Miguel De Cervantes', I547-I6I6, Don uixote, and Mark Twain's, I835-I9I0, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\n\nAll were tales of adventure and imagination designed to inspire kids in nations where dreams don't die first. It was from Swift that we first learnt about the primacy of agriculture in human life long before Robert Malthus, I766-I834, gave mankind a lick in the backside with his epic, On Population, which reminded us of \"the perpetual struggle for room and food\".\n\neditorial\n\nThe federal government's recent approval of N2billion for the publication of journals in Nigerian universities through the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, TETFund, is a laudable step. It will boost reading and writing culture among the country's academics, especially when viewed against the preponderance of low-quality academic and professional journals flying all over the country.\n\nA nation that is aspiring to be among the world's best should not relegate education and the quest for knowledge to the basement in its scale of preference. The financing, supervising and management of the education sector should not be toyed with. Books and top-flight academic journals in the nation's higher institutions must not be in short supply.\n\nMINISTER of Education, Professor Ruqayyatu Rufa'i has commissioned the Electronic Teaching and Learning Platform at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.\n\nThe Minister assured that government was determined to provide the basic facilities that would enhance the educational system and make it globally competitive.\n\nRufa'i said that the platform would address the challenge of large classes, particularly general courses, as students can participate adequate in their lectures from a distance. She noted that the platform would complement the Virtual Library Project of the NUC with a library holding of over 16,000 academic journals for students and researchers.\n\nShe disclosed that the Nigerian Universities Electronic Teaching and Learning Platform was one of the schemes introduced by the Federal Government with the support of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) to support the universities in producing more quality graduates and research output.\n\nProfessor Rufa'i further explained that the project was an ICT-enabled interactive teaching and learning concept, which main focus was to develop 'smart' classrooms that use technology to overcome the challenges of large classes, aid modern methods of teaching and learning as well as content development using interactive tools.\n\nShe listed some of the component of the platform to include a pool of interactive whiteboards with networking capabilities; high resolution audio-visual teaching aids,; capacity development on modern methods of teaching and learning and an electronic content development and a pool of electronic clipart resources.\n\nThe Minister said as part of government's efforts toward deploying ICT in the universities, ICT resource centres were built in some federal universities which include: Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike; University of Port Harcourt; University of Benin; University of Abuja;Federal University of Technology, Minna; Federal University of Technology Owerri and University of Calabar.\n\nThe Executive Secretary, National Universities Commission (NUC) Professor Julius Okojie enjoined the students to protect the facilities from vandalisation, noting that government had invested so much to actualise the project.\n\nLAST Wednesday when unofficial sources reported that management of the Lagos State University is making plans to relocate students of the Adebola Adegunwa School of Communications (AASOC), Ojuelegba, to Topo in Badagry, where LASU Foundation Programme is run, the school and various social media have been awash with mixed reactions from students and staff.\n\nAccording to some of the students, the move became necessary as children of the rightful owner of the Adebola Adegunwa Building, where the school is housed, have shown interest in reclaiming the property.\n\nMore so, it has also been said that the move to Topo coincided with the fact that the LASU Foundation Programme being run in the building, will be rounding off by October.\n\ninterview\n\nProf. Nuhu Yakub is the Vice-Chancellor of Sokoto State University. In this interview with Mohammed Aminu, he bares his mind on the new university, challenges in the education sector and other issues. Excerpts\n\nHow would you rate the University of Abuja as at the time you left the institution?\n\nWhen I was leaving office as Vice-Chancellor of University of Abuja (UNIABUJA), not less than 62 people applied to succeed me. I am not trying to be arrogant, I excelled in Abuja and I think it was on the basis of my performance that I was given a national honour by late President Umar Musa Yar'adua. When I came in as the Vice-chancellor of UNIABUJA, it was operating on its temporary site, which was originally meant for a primary school for 16 years. And within five years of my stay there, I created a new village, structures were there, roads, buildings, I created a road network of not less than 50 kilometres. The campus moved to the permanent site on May 5, 2009."
