        "text": "A BOOK REVIEW OF ECHOES FROM THE THRONE - A BIOGRAPHY OF HRM OBA GEN. DR. OLUFEMI OLUTOYE JP OFR The biography of HRM Oba Gen. (Dr) Olufemi Olutoye OFR, JP, the Alani of Ido Ani in Ondo State is entitled ECHOES FROM THE THRONE and was written by Otunba Dr. Babatola Johnson. The review of the book was commissioned as an academic exercise to Dr. Jadesola Taiwo Babatola in preparation for its launching. The book consist of 10 Chapters and Tributes to celebrate the Kabiyesi and it is a must read for those interested in history and biographical studies, politics, leadership and governance, Nigeria Government and politics and even mentoring. The book discusses various phases of the life and achievements of Kabiyesi and his contributions to humanity and the society at large. It is worth reading. The review is a 10 page presentation on the lifetime achievements of the subject and issues surrounding his role in modern history which can serve as a source of knowledge for the advancement of human traditions and good leadership.\n\nOba mewa, Igbamewa literarily meaning \"ten kings, ten different epochs\" is a common proverb among the Yoruba people of southwestern Nigeria where Lagos State is geographically and ethnically subsumed. The proverb connotatively translates to the fact that the tenure of an incumbent ruler or office holder would be defined by its philosophy, approaches, style, achievements, pitfalls, and challenges. It is also used to reflect the historical, sociological, political, and socioeconomic dynamics that predominate the period a king or an office holder reigned. In the light of the import of this proverb, this paper presents the biographical sketch of the earthly sojourn of Oba Adeyinka Oyekan II, one of the twentieth century prominent monarchs of Lagos whose reign has been attributed as one of the longest in the history of Lagos spanning about forty decades. Specifically, the biography examines his emergence on the throne and the contributions of the reign towards the socioeconomic and political transformation of Lagos and its environs. The historical approaches to data collection (via extant literature and newspaper article especially) and interpretation are adopted.\n\nThis paper examines the concept of leadership. It focuses on the reign of Atta Ibrahim Onoruoiza, the first paramount chief of the Ebira people. The paper also analysed the contributions of the Atta in the area of infrastructural, social and manpower development of the Ebira people and Ebiraland. The methodology adopted by the paper is the use of primary sources which include oral interview and archival materials. It also made use of secondary sources such as journals and books. Findings in the paper reveal that Atta Ibrahim Onoruoiza despite the enormous challenges that besieged his reign, he was a transformational leader who developed the land but his flaws were highly exaggerated, thus, greatly misconstrued. It argues that his abdication from the throne in 1954 was not because of his non-performance as a leader, but due to the political dictates of the day and personal vendetta of the then Ebira political actors. In the final analysis, the paper humbly submits that Atta Ibrahim Onoruoiza rather than being seen as a tyrannical leader should be seen as a transformational leader.\n\nTRADITIONS AND CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING THE EKITI SENIOR OBAS (1860-1960) The organization of various kingdoms and the arrangement of the major towns in relations to the subordinate towns constituted the basis of their traditional relevance in Yorubaland prior to British occupation. This is why the status and hierarchy of natural rulers in Ekiti were based on the strength of their tradition and customs, geography and influence and interactions with their neighbour's. The coming of the British, nonetheless gave opportunities for official recognition of different categories of traditional rulers. In some instance, some towns took new identities by severing relationship with their founding fathers due to their expansion and need to break the yoke of dominance as they became politically relevant. This is because many trading centres and coastal towns with larger population began to struggle with their former overlord in order to gain political relevance and it resulted to conflict where the higher traditional authorities (Oba Alayeluwa) resides in the hinterland while their designated Trading Ambassador or Chiefs called Oloja (Chief of Trade) or Baales (Community Leaders or District Superintendents) thst resided at the coast or trading centre's got upgraded or given equal recognition by the British. The characteristics of Ekiti people prior to the advent of colonial rule was traced in the works of G.O.I. Olomola. A brief examination presupposes a trend of the historical development described Ekiti as unique in an aspect of its popular traditional beliefs attached to their solidarity and oneness from past generations. The uniqueness reverberated in Olomola’s work while observing their collaborative, cohesive and cooperative ‘solidarity’ spirit and relationship in championing their common causes and in facing common challenges in the pre-colonial era. Hence he noted ttha the most celebrated instance of the application of the ‘ethnic’ solidarity among Ekiti communities was the organization of their formidable military alliance against Ibadan imperial power. In looking at the solidarity among the Ekitis with its unique peculiarities due to the governing structure, societies and the weight of internal-communal relations, Olomola opined thus each Kingdom and city-state in Ekiti had maintained its own corporate existence, managed its own affairs in peace and in wartime as best as its leaders and citizens could utilize available human and material resources…while each kingdom pursued its own internal interests with little interference from outside… The position above did not however neglect the parameters of power relations among the major towns and subordinate towns and their traditional rulers. Indeed, Olomola drew attention to the powers of traditional rulers and their status in Ekitiland before the British colonial rule, when he noted their legend with reference to Kingdoms of Ado, Ikole, Ijero and Moba and asserted thus: Each Kingdom consisted of a major (mother) town and a few or numerous subordinate communities while each city-state comprised a main town and a couple of villages and cottages. Each Kingdom or city state was, to all intent and purposes, a territorial unit over which its Oba (ruler), for all practical purposes, was sovereign from its inception…The Oba of the mother town wore crowns and lived a life governed by protocol, while the heads of subordinate communities …wore crown lets (orikogbofo) and caps.\n\nTheophilus Owolabi Shobowale Benson, popularly known as TOS Benson, a prince from the Lasunwon Royal Family of Ikorodu, was one of the architects of modern Nigeria. A spirited nationalist, a pan–Nigerian nation builder, an inveterate antagonist of ethnic jingoism and a relentless crusader for the under–dog and the less privileged; TOS Benson made imperishable contributions to the growth and development of Nigerian politics and judiciary (law). This paper assesses the contribution of TOS Benson to the making of the Nigerian state right from September 1947 when he returned to the country from London where he had gone to read law. It points out that TOS Benson was a solid political bridgehead that held the ethnic groups in the country together and that, at the risk of incarceration and other forms of intimidation and harassment, he stood up against the colonial administration and certain policies and antics of the military junta following the incursion of the military into Nigerian pol...\n\nLeadership is one of the themes in folklore. This research sets out to look at the Igbo leadership in folklores drawing insights from Mike Ejeagha’s Omekaagụ. The concept of Igbo enwe eze had been variously discussed in the Igbo political system. While some Igbo see it as a compliment, others believe that it should be refuted. The paper seeks to ascertain whether it is really true that Igbo people do not have kings. The research adopts the descriptive survey research method in its analysis. This paper finds out that the Igbo have priests, who perform religious functions in most of its areas like Onitsha, Arọndizuọgụ but Igbo lack a general king or leader as a race. The insights drawn from Mike Ejeagha’s Omekaagụ suggest that traditionally, the Igbo have kings in each kingdom or community, who govern alongside the council of chiefs. Moreover, the process of getting a new king is through inheritance and the first son must succeed his father as king. However, contemporary reasoning has encroached or eroded some of the tenets of succession in various Igbo kingdoms. Also, the research finds out that Ofọ na Ogu are the symbol of uprightness, which a king is expected to possess."
