        "text": "According to Leo Tolstoy, “everyone thinks of changing the world but no one thinks of changing himself.” In other words, for you to change the world, you need to change yourself. Every rational human being has aspirations. We want to be extraordinary. We all want to put our footprints in the sands of time. It is true that everyone is born to lead, but not everyone becomes a leader. There are potentials embedded in every man but few are positive enough to tap into these abilities so as to make a significant impact in their generation.\n\nThe prime thing you need to change is your mentality. Your way of thinking must change. As a leader, you should have a champion’s mentality. Be optimistic about situations and challenges. Do not limit yourself; dream big. Believe you have all it takes to make a difference in your society. Think positive, assuring yourself that you will reach your altitude.\n\nBeing optimistic gives you an inner strength to face obstacles on your quest to achievement. If you think you can, you can; but if you think you can’t, you are right. This is the power of positive thinking. It makes you tap into your God-given potentials and harness them in order to reach the top. Never believe you cannot achieve. Stop thinking you cannot endure hard times. Never say never. Be optimistic; always believe you will achieve your goal at the end.\n\nA positive mentality brings about a positive attitude. Act out what you believe. Positive attitude in turn gives way to hard work, diligence, problem solving skills and other transformational abilities which will inevitably catapult you to the top. Remember, “A positive attitude gives you the fortitude to reach the high altitude of your dreams”\n\nThe height you will reach in your academic pursuit is determined by your way of thinking. What you believe is who you become. If you think you can graduate with a first class, you really can! If you think it is too late for you to graduate in flying colours, well, you are not wrong either. Your positive mentality gives you the ability to study diligently. Therefore, be optimistic about your studies. You can do it!\n\nDear reader, you have more abilities than you can ever imagine; you are innovative and extraordinary; you can make impossibilities possible; you can change the “status-quo” in your environment. All you need to exhibit a positive thinking. As an aspiring being, I want you to know that the sky is not your limit; your mentality is your limit.Anything your mind conceives, it can achieve once you believe.Right believing leads to right living. As you begin to think positively and optimistically, I heartily welcome you to a world of impossibilities being made possible.\n\n“A POSITIVE MENTALITY ORIENTS YOUR ACTIVITY TO ALTER THE STATUS-QUO IN YOUR LOCALITY."
