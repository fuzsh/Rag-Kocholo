As Dr Wale Babalakin turns 64 today, admirers celebrate a man whose life story is a testament to perseverance, excellence, and unwavering commitment to philanthropy. Babalakin’s journey from a young boy in Ibadan to a towering figure in law, business, and humanitarian efforts is nothing short of inspiring.

Born on July 1, 1960, in Ibadan, Oyo State, Dr Babalakin comes from a family deeply rooted in the legal and medical professions. His father, Justice Bolarinwa Babalakin, served with distinction on the Supreme Court of Nigeria, while his mother, Ramotu Babalakin, was a renowned hospital proprietress.

Babalakin’s educational path laid the foundation for his illustrious career. After completing his early education at Sacred Heart Private School and Government College, Ibadan, he studied at The Polytechnic, Ibadan. In 1978, he gained admission into the University of Lagos, where he graduated from the Faculty of Law in 1981. By 1982, he was called to the Nigerian Bar, and that same year, he embarked on an academic adventure at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University. There, he earned his Master of Law degree in 1983 and completed his PhD, by 1986, just before his 26th birthday.

Babalakin’s legal career is marked by his elevation to the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria in 2002 and receiving the national honour of Officer of the Federal Republic in 2007. His legal acumen and business prowess have established him as a formidable force in Nigeria’s professional landscape. His company, Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited, built and operates the second terminal of Murtala Muhammed Airport, Nigeria’s first and only privately funded airport terminal, which recently celebrated 17 years of excellent operation.

Babalakin’s influence extends beyond his legal and business achievements. He has played significant roles in academia and national committees, serving as Chairman of the Committee of Pro-Chancellors of Federal Universities in Nigeria and Chairman of the Implementation Monitoring Committee of the Agreements entered into between the Federal Government of Nigeria and the various unions of Nigerian universities, including ASUU, SSANU, NAAT, and NASU. He was also the Chairman of the Federal Government Committee to re-negotiate the 2009 Agreement between the Federal Government and the university unions and a former Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Council of the University of Lagos.

Babalakin’s philanthropic endeavours set him apart. Driven by a belief in the transformative power of education, he has dedicated significant resources to improving Nigeria’s educational system. His contributions to the University of Maiduguri as Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council are particularly noteworthy. Under his leadership, the university saw the completion of a multimillion-naira Independent Power Project, ensuring 20 hours of uninterrupted electricity – a first in Nigeria’s university system.

His philanthropy is further underscored by donations such as an 80-bed hostel to the University of Ilorin in honour of his father and a 500-seat auditorium to Moshood Abiola Polytechnic in memory of his mother. He has also provided free eye treatments and surgeries to thousands through the Ramatu Ibironke Babalakin Foundation, benefiting communities in Osun, Ondo, and Kaduna states.

Babalakin’s impact on education extends through his elaborate scholarship scheme, supporting over 200 students in Nigeria and more than 40 students abroad. His dedication to societal development earned him the Merit Award from the Ansar Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria in 2013, alongside other dignitaries, including then Lagos State Governor Babatunde Fashola (SAN).

Beyond philanthropy, Babalakin is the Chairman of Stabilini Visinoni Limited, a Nigerian construction firm. His hospitality and leisure company, Resort International Limited, received a Development Lease Agreement in 2006 to convert the former Federal Secretariat in Ikoyi, Lagos, into luxury flats, and develop a 300-bed hotel at MMA2.

At 64, Babalakin remains unwavering in his dedication to excellence, his profound impact on education, and his compassionate philanthropy. His life’s work continues to inspire and uplift, leaving an indelible mark on Nigeria and beyond.
