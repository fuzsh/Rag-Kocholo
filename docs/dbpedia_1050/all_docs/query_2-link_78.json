        "text": "Award-winning country superstar Lainey Wilson has released a music video for \"Hang Tight Honey\" alongside fellow \"Whirlwind\" album track \"4x4xU.\"\n\nGrammy-winning artist Lainey Wilson's continued surge into the August 26 release of her fifth studio album \"Whirlwind\" continues to feature simultaneous drops of career-redefining work.\n\nThe July 3 and 4 release of a music video for \"Hang Tight Honey\" alongside fellow \"Whirlwind\" album track \"4x4xU\" follow Wilson's appearances in a Super Bowl commercial and at the People's Choice Awards. It also comes on the heels of the opening of a Lower Broadway honky-tonk, two nights at Ascend Amphitheater, plus her induction into the Grand Ole Opry.\n\n\"4x4xU\" and the album \"Whirwlind\" are available at http://laineywilson.lnk.to/whirlwind.\n\nThe latter was co-written by Wilson, Jon Decious, and Aaron Raitiere, plus produced by GRAMMY-winning producer Jay Joyce. It is described via a press statement as \"a stripped-back, deeply personal, modern yet nostalgic ballad that beautifully explores the theme of finding solace within a loved one amidst life's whirlwinds.\"\n\nThe former expands Wilson past her \"Bell Bottom Country\" looks and Western flair into 60's girl group attire.\n\nOf late, the \"Heart Like A Truck\" performer has not only just played New York City's Radio City Music Hall on her \"Country's Cool Again\" tour. On June 30 at Chicago's Soldier Field, she opened for The Rolling Stones on their \"Hackney Diamonds\" tour. She joined them later to perform their 1971 hit \"Dead Flowers.\"\n\nVia an Instagram comment, Wilson noted, \"I got to hang out with rockstars of all rockstars last night,\" the country musician wrote in a caption alongside a series of photos and videos. \"@mickjagger @officialkeef @ronniewood @therollingstones - you are legendary, to say the least. What a treat, what an honor, what a night!! Wow.\"\n\nAlready in 2024, Wilson has won a Grammy for Best Country Album, a People's Choice Award for Female Country Artist of The Year, a CMT Music Award for Female Video of The Year, three ACM awards (including Entertainer of The Year) and became both an official cast member of the Grand Ole Opry and a U.S. State Department Global Music Ambassador.\n\nThose accomplishments follow making her acting debut in Season 5 of the Paramount series Yellowstone, plus, following her post-COVID-19 quarantine, platinum-selling breakout \"Things A Man Oughta Know,\" she's toured the world and achieved seven No. 1 singles.\n\nUpon receiving her ACM Entertainer of the Year Award, Wilson told The Tennessean, \"The gratitude I felt when I locked eyes with my parents is for them allowing me to dream the dreams that allowed me to achieve this goal. They're also representative of the kind of people inspiring me to believe that the sky is the limit regarding what I want to achieve next.\"\n\nWilson said she still felt like the little girl who would climb out her window and count the stars in the sky.\n\n\"I'd see planes flying over my little town of 200 people and I'd dream about being on one of those planes,\" she said. \"This year we've toured the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, but I still feel like that little girl. I really do.\""
