        "text": "well, I WILL buy it for sure, but i stumbled on a couple of tunes and why not listen first to see if i liked them. loved the first one, didnt love the second one and its not like i'm going to hear this on the radio....\n\nYou really ought to get it. I haven't made much effort to discuss it here, because it doesn't really fit in with the prevalent rock vibe of the forum, but it has been one of my favorite records of the past few years. Killer tune after killer tune - ear candy, as someone described it on page one, I believe.\n\nPut me squarely in the column of those who think Goldfrapp was at their** best with the first album, and their** output progressively worsened with each subsequent release (though there are a few tracks on each of the following two albums that I do like quite a bit).\n\nGlad to hear the positive comments so far about the new one. I can't remember exactly what the description was, but I remember reading months ago about how it was going to be different from what they** had done before and the description was positively intriguing to me. Closer to Felt Mountain than the others, but not really like that one either. \"German cabaret mixed with Felt Mountain\" or something of the sort.\n\nI know there have been some other non-Goldfrapp songs that Alison has contributed to vocally which are revered by hardcore fans, but I haven't had the opportunity to get a full accounting of the material yet. If anyone here knows of some good ones, please clue us in here. Of course, there's her vocals on the Tricky song, Pumpkin, but beyond that one.. I'm clueless as to what I should seek out.\n\n** Goldfrapp isn't \"she\" or \"Alison\" as described a few times in this thread, it's \"they\" as in Alison and Will [Gregory]! It's not a solo act, it's a musical partnership of these two people. Irks me a bit when people gloss over that part of it as if she's running the show. Well, she IS front and center when it comes to running the stage show, but as far as creating the music goes... different story. Equal partners."
